[00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.954]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:15.348]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.050]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:18.892]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:20.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:22.036]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:26.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:30.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:49.318]  Well, the globalists have destroyed every sovereign nation on earth except for a handful.
[00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.623]  And they're busy trying to complete the enslavement of the United States.
[00:00:54.363 --> 00:01:01.151]  Imagine if there were 30 plus million, they keep saying it's 11 or 20, and it's well over 20 million illegals in this country.
[00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:05.178]  And nobody's saying a lot of them don't work hard.
[00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:08.280]  Nobody's saying that these are bad people overall on average.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:21.348]  The issue is they have been brainwashed and they do vote, and I have the poll numbers right here, to take people's guns and to vote for more open borders and socialism and the end of private property rights.
[00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:23.430]  And they vote Democratic.
[00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:29.594]  And as bad as the Republicans are, they will soon be an extinct fringe party.
[00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:34.231]  I'm going to be breaking that down today, and then Katie, bar the door.
[00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:42.481]  Because if the establishment can bring in unlimited groups of people that are on the government dole, basically paying for their votes, it's game over.
[00:01:43.182 --> 00:01:47.988]  They're having illegals vote all over the country already with driver's licenses that are issued by the states.
[00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:49.370]  That's on record.
[00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.375]  And then if you're against that, you're a racist.
[00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:56.519]  Well, I can't go to Mexico and go vote down there as the illegal.
[00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.840]  I can't get free welfare.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.184]  If I show up in a Mexican hospital and try to have a baby, they're going to take the money out of me.
[00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:10.931]  And if not, they're going to throw the father, and this has happened before, in jail until the family back in El Norte pays it off.
[00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:16.310]  Mexico has some of the most draconian immigration laws in the world.
[00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.351]  Even the New York Times admits that.
[00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:23.175]  So it's totally hypocritical and the goodwill of the American people is being used here.
[00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:29.520]  It's like the goodwill of the American people was used to get Obama elected and now if you don't agree with what he's doing you're racist.
[00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.963]  This is the race politics of the Democratic Party.
[00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:37.567]  The problem is all the big Republican associations
[00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:51.833]  The Association of Manufacturing, the Association of Small Businesses, the different associations, the National Chamber of Commerce, are all pushing for this because, well, they push for the banker bailout.
[00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:53.914]  They push for gun control.
[00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:55.975]  They push for elitism.
[00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.858]  They push for getting rid of basic freedom in this country.
[00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.161]  And so you've got the Republican leadership for it, the Democratic leadership for it, all these foreign banks for it.
[00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:15.932]  All the big blue-blood Republican country club people for it, because they want a managed economy and they want to checkmate what's left of the middle class in this country.
[00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:18.072]  I mean, has NAFTA and GATT helped America?
[00:03:18.092 --> 00:03:20.473]  Did it help Mexico for that matter?
[00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:20.753]  No.
[00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:29.177]  In fact, in the last 25 years, you can look at the numbers, the top 1% has doubled its wealth.
[00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:31.438]  And they're the ones
[00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.936]  Lobbying, on average, and pushing this whole so-called liberal agenda.
[00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:39.119]  It is not a liberal agenda.
[00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.421]  And I talked about this yesterday.
[00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.506]  You're a top Nazi collaborator, George Soros, you get ADL awards.
[00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:51.134]  If you fight fascism, you're called a Nazi.
[00:03:52.429 --> 00:04:06.274]  If you're the Democratic Party, running the Ku Klux Klan until 1963, publicly, then the demographics change, whites overwhelmingly become anti-segregation and anti-racism, and so you flip and become the party of the minorities.
[00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:09.956]  This is a totally sickening joke, and it's a total hoax.
[00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:17.259]  And if Boehner and all the rest of these people are able to get what they want, this country is done.
[00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:18.837]  It is done.
[00:04:18.937 --> 00:04:36.724]  All we can do is have states secede and try to reconstitute something because, folks, if they can bring in 25, 35 million illegals, the number's more like 35 million, and then legalize them and then say we're gonna legalize the next group, oh, how dare you not legalize millions and millions of people that are here illegally.
[00:04:36.764 --> 00:04:38.645]  This is just outrageous.
[00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:41.046]  I've never heard of anything like this.
[00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:45.208]  It's the over-the-top nature of this.
[00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:48.980]  How dare you not want the TSA to stick their hands down your pants?
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.624]  How dare you not want us to have militarized police on every street corner?
[00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:56.768]  How dare you not want the IRF to be able to take money out of your bank account, no judge or jury?
[00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.412]  How dare you not want all this forced inoculation?
[00:05:00.472 --> 00:05:02.334]  I mean, it's just all over the top.
[00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:07.980]  This is the latest treason to legalize people that are here totally illegally.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.841]  What will that do?
[00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:10.676]  The facts are in.
[00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:11.956]  The studies are legion.
[00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:19.621]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:23.223]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:23.983]  Simple.
[00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:28.486]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:34.331]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:50.605]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:55.146]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:57.327]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.290]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.791]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.373]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.993]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.014]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:48.638]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.914]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:16.436]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on
[00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:22.398]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:24.379]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.959]  We are what we eat.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.621]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:34.943]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:37.504]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:07:37.744 --> 00:07:43.626]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:17.418]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.024]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:43.578]  Before I had hit refresh on DrugsReport.com about 20 minutes ago, I was intending to come in here on this live Thursday edition, already the 30th day of January 2014.
[00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:57.829]  I was intending to come in here and basically say that legalizing more than 30 million illegal aliens, it's not 11 million folks, is suicide for this country.
[00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:07.007]  And that the Republican Party is going to commit suicide, demographically, if they pass this.
[00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:08.871]  But they probably will.
[00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:33.051]  And Obama has already legalized the illegals by fiat and is letting them vote by fiat in race-based politics funded by the Ford Foundation and Carnegie Endowment in the last 60 years to create incredible increased racial animus on folks in Mexico and tell them it's a cultural duty to go to El Norte for La Reconquista or the Reconquering.
[00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:54.184]  And then you have the MSNBC crowd who will then continue the radicalization, and then tied to that racial animus that is sold and packaged, you will then have attached to it the different sacraments of ban the guns, fully open the borders, get rid of the family, the race to the bottom.
[00:09:55.305 --> 00:09:59.808]  And America will fall like California is already falling.
[00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:02.570]  That is the game plan, that is the program.
[00:10:03.993 --> 00:10:13.142]  And you have the entire Republican leadership supporting it, you have the entire corporate global leadership supporting it, because they want desperately poor people.
[00:10:14.023 --> 00:10:19.508]  And there's no economic study out there, I've got a stack of them I'm going to cover here in a moment, that doesn't say this won't drive down wages.
[00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.493]  There isn't a study out there that says this won't lower the standard of living.
[00:10:25.154 --> 00:10:27.757]  There's not a study out there that says that this will not cause
[00:10:29.226 --> 00:10:35.849]  The total, complete takeover by the Democratic Party of every institution in America.
[00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:41.411]  And then they get to have all their social engineering, everything else they're up to.
[00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:52.075]  Now remember, the Democratic Party was able to dominate the South because of Lincoln, their enemy, until the early 1960s and Eisenhower broke their back.
[00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:56.327]  People like my grandfather got elected to government in Texas.
[00:10:56.347 --> 00:10:58.729]  His father had been a mayor of a major city.
[00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:00.330]  He'd been a Democrat.
[00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.653]  My grandfather bucked it and became a Republican and a pro-civil rights act.
[00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:10.356]  That was done all across the country, in every town and city.
[00:11:11.497 --> 00:11:12.958]  You saw those actions take place.
[00:11:12.978 --> 00:11:16.821]  The Democrats, and I've read the quotes by LBJ and others, they're on air, said
[00:11:17.847 --> 00:11:24.511]  We've got to now act like we like these minorities and co-opt them, but we'll just play race politics the way we've done with poor whites.
[00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:29.554]  That's all it is, and they are master criminals at doing it.
[00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:37.559]  And the problem is, they're very unpopular, and they can be defeated, but the Republican leadership is bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.762]  There is not a Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Republican Party right now.
[00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:49.524]  Those that could be, like a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul, are under unmitigated attack and demonization.
[00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:57.188]  And as Pat Buchanan said today, we have an audio clip of this, he said, you know, Boehner will be out of speaker if he does this.
[00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:57.669]  They don't care.
[00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:58.729]  He'll get his big payoff.
[00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:01.411]  The guy plays golf with Obama constantly.
[00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:04.012]  It's all a big sick joke to these people.
[00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:16.701]  They're going to be rewarded for doing this and they've made it a matter of some type of racial pride within the polls I've got at the Lapue Research Hispanic Center.
[00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:25.951]  83% of Hispanics think it's a duty in polls conducted by Hispanic Polling Center in Spanish to take over quote America racially.
[00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:30.106]  So see, that's the racial angle and that's what's been sold.
[00:12:30.686 --> 00:12:41.731]  Well, meanwhile, the average white person is completely politically correct, hates themselves, and would feed their child into a garbage disposal unit if they were told it was something to prove that they're not a bad white person.
[00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:44.952]  And that's where all this goes.
[00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:46.733]  That's where all this happens.
[00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:49.394]  You know, the race issue at the end of the day doesn't even really mean anything.
[00:12:50.114 --> 00:12:56.277]  It's just a tribal identification like Jew versus Palestinian or
[00:12:57.751 --> 00:13:03.297]  Shiite versus Sunni, or Black Muslim against Black Christian.
[00:13:03.577 --> 00:13:05.699]  The globalists just need a dividing line.
[00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:12.587]  And this is the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that when I took U.S.
[00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:14.569]  history in high school,
[00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:23.478]  And then in college, all it was was a demonization of gringos by white professors, and that America had to be destroyed.
[00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:26.701]  Well the globalists want to destroy it and turn it into North American Union.
[00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:32.806]  It'll still have the big military, it'll still have the American flag, it just will be totally conquered politically.
[00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:40.613]  by a new racial block that will be used by the government to then basically menace the other racial blocks.
[00:13:40.973 --> 00:13:47.677]  And so we won't have a system based on liberty and freedom and due process and separation of powers and private property.
[00:13:48.177 --> 00:13:56.462]  It will be a fully big city Chicago, New York style area where you'll have regional city council people
[00:13:57.449 --> 00:13:58.030]  I don't know.
[00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:16.921]  Further socialism and wealth transfer, or you're a racist.
[00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:21.523]  Meanwhile, all the big rich people like Bloomberg and the rest of them, they're going to be exempt.
[00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:30.867]  The ultimate form of inequality, the ultimate form of discrimination, but the public hasn't been taught about real forms of discrimination and inequality.
[00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:35.748]  All they know is white is bad.
[00:14:35.928 --> 00:14:36.668]  White is evil.
[00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:37.869]  White must be eradicated.
[00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:38.749]  Prove you're good.
[00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.770]  Don't be white.
[00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.731]  Don't marry somebody white if you're white.
[00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:43.511]  Because that's racist.
[00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:45.832]  Doesn't matter if you're attracted to white people.
[00:14:45.892 --> 00:14:46.533]  That's bad.
[00:14:47.073 --> 00:14:48.874]  Show yourself as good.
[00:14:49.134 --> 00:14:53.036]  And so whites everywhere are engaged in suicide.
[00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:55.637]  And my issue is if you love somebody and care about them, that's your issue.
[00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:56.437]  I don't have a problem with it.
[00:14:56.817 --> 00:15:02.800]  The point is if it's force-fed, like trying to teach five-year-olds how to be gay, this is an agenda.
[00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.996]  And it doesn't matter how many times whites run up the white flag.
[00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:09.917]  It doesn't matter how many times we commit suicide culturally.
[00:15:10.557 --> 00:15:11.758]  It's never good enough.
[00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:16.740]  Because the globalists want everyone homogenized and no culture.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.761]  There's no black culture in this country.
[00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:24.683]  Their CIA-created hip-hop gangster culture declassified on record to destroy those people.
[00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:32.786]  Look at the great society of LBJ and what it did to blacks, from less than 10% illegitimacy to 90-plus percent.
[00:15:34.222 --> 00:15:38.203]  This isn't my opinion that Margaret Sanger said all this 90 years ago.
[00:15:38.223 --> 00:15:40.744]  It isn't my opinion LBJ said all this.
[00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:46.946]  My crew just searched LBJ talking about co-opting the N-words.
[00:15:47.586 --> 00:15:51.007]  You can pull up all his letters to members of the House and Senate.
[00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:55.136]  You can pull up the National Archive letters of Margaret Sanger, and they've done it.
[00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:58.177]  There's a reason the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are in charge.
[00:15:58.497 --> 00:16:01.899]  There's a reason Ford and Carnegie endowments are in charge.
[00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:03.539]  Because they're ruthless, folks.
[00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:20.225]  And so you're going to lose your guns, you're going to lose your private property, and while we're all busy fighting with each other over what color we are, all this is happening, the globalists are destroying every future dream we have.
[00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:22.152]  Across the board.
[00:16:22.752 --> 00:16:26.956]  And you've got Obama openly acting as a dictator and the Republican leadership doing nothing about it.
[00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:33.761]  You've got Europe being completely overrun with immigrants, who are then turned into political groups.
[00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:40.227]  I've had members of Parliament on from England, where most of the social workers are foreigners, literally taking the UK children.
[00:16:40.787 --> 00:16:41.928]  I mean, this is a plan.
[00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:42.429]  These are like
[00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:44.314]  Foreign mercenaries.
[00:16:45.115 --> 00:16:47.255]  And I'm not demonizing immigrants individually.
[00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:50.416]  The globalist CU is like a German soldier.
[00:16:51.016 --> 00:16:58.259]  A Hessian mercenary brought here in 1776 on big ships to wage war on the colonies.
[00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:01.520]  You are a political, cultural weapon.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.021]  And hey, when the minorities, or really the majority in most areas,
[00:17:06.144 --> 00:17:09.086]  And then the whites are, on average, a completely aging group.
[00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:11.588]  I mean, whites will be like 20% of the population in 30 years.
[00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.669]  And it won't matter.
[00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:14.010]  They will always be the enemy.
[00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.491]  They will always be attacked.
[00:17:16.332 --> 00:17:26.460]  Because that's how they're going to organize the majority that's, quote, minority, to then follow all the tyranny and live in squalor and have no freedom, is because it doesn't matter.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.703]  There'll always be a white piñata to slap around and attack and urinate on.
[00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:33.645]  So that's where all this is going.
[00:17:34.065 --> 00:17:34.866]  That's the attempt.
[00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:38.504]  And it is, it's all happening.
[00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:40.406]  You notice the Globals are doing everything right now.
[00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:54.794]  Because they know that the entire population is waking up to Obamacare being a scam, and waking up to the Federal Reserve being private, and they know the numbers show, quote, minorities are beginning to wake up to things and becoming more libertarian.
[00:17:55.155 --> 00:17:57.536]  If that continues another 10, 20 years, they could lose.
[00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.158]  We could actually educate all these folks.
[00:18:01.527 --> 00:18:06.874]  We could educate all the whites about the left-right paradigm, but we don't have that time.
[00:18:07.835 --> 00:18:12.661]  And so the globalists are racing right now to get their agenda through.
[00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.873]  And I'm just going to say this calmly.
[00:18:16.473 --> 00:18:21.515]  Imagine any other nation that had conservatively 25 million illegals, probably 30 plus.
[00:18:21.735 --> 00:18:22.575]  They always say 11 to 14.
[00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:25.636]  The last eight times they tried to pass this same bill.
[00:18:26.216 --> 00:18:29.757]  They did it under Bush, what, five times.
[00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:32.898]  They've done it under Obama, three or four times.
[00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:33.819]  Maybe it's nine times.
[00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:34.979]  This is the ninth try, is it?
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.840]  And I want you to think about that.
[00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:42.982]  Because the country is already collapsing economically.
[00:18:44.542 --> 00:18:55.702]  And if you legalize all these illegals, and in the last bill we saw, let them then bring their families in, we're talking about another $30 million in just a decade.
[00:18:57.483 --> 00:18:59.184]  And then it's expected.
[00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:03.187]  Food stamps, welfare, don't wear American flags on your shirt.
[00:19:03.227 --> 00:19:04.849]  That's hurtful at the San Francisco school.
[00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:07.311]  Even Hispanic kids can't wear American flags.
[00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:09.752]  I mean, this is all that we're taught.
[00:19:09.772 --> 00:19:10.913]  We're being overwritten.
[00:19:10.973 --> 00:19:25.845]  We're being totally conquered, and not by Mexico that's totally collapsed into hellhole squalor, the worst in Latin America, but by the globalists just simply using the ghost of some type of La Reconquista
[00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:30.784]  As the cultural football game.
[00:19:31.924 --> 00:19:33.664]  Again, people get into football games that don't matter.
[00:19:33.684 --> 00:19:36.725]  It's the same thing here, when that's not even what's happening.
[00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:40.726]  It is America being turned into the Maquiladores.
[00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:51.828]  It's America being turned into a giant service land collapsing wage cesspool with hyperinflation.
[00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:03.594]  With total 24-7 race baiting by the Democrats, where they're running some multi-racial cheerios ad and they said, the conservatives will hate this because there's black people.
[00:20:04.195 --> 00:20:07.076]  I mean, just constant manipulation.
[00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:08.917]  These people are the party of the Klan.
[00:20:10.404 --> 00:20:13.906]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[00:20:14.206 --> 00:20:16.007]  So you may know a few things about him.
[00:20:16.308 --> 00:20:22.552]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:28.235]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:31.117]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[00:20:31.457 --> 00:20:33.358]  Just visit GoBerky.com.

[00:20:58.713 --> 00:21:00.254]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[00:21:09.622 --> 00:21:12.204]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:21:12.464 --> 00:21:17.348]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:25.474]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:21:25.715 --> 00:21:30.038]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:34.061]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:39.903]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:21:40.143 --> 00:21:42.924]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:21:43.304 --> 00:21:48.545]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:21:48.685 --> 00:21:56.808]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:21:56.868 --> 00:21:57.048]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:22:04.611 --> 00:22:11.035]  What's making Americans sick and fat?
[00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:18.080]  It's too many GMO foods and toxins, destroying our digestive systems, causing poor digestion and suppressed immune systems.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.904]  A suppressed immune system prevents clear thinking and the ability to fight the corporate and big pharma agendas.
[00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:26.965]  Detox now with Pro-EM1 from Terragonics.
[00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:34.867]  Pro-EM1 liquid probiotic is wheat, dairy, and soy free, gluten free, and made with all non-GMO certified organic ingredients.

[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.580]  Pro-EM1 from Tarragonics.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.201]  Life's getting better.
[00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:13.206]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:20.607]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:24.748]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:30.809]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.

[00:23:40.245 --> 00:23:44.686]  We've all heard as long as we're not doing anything wrong, we don't have anything to worry about.
[00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:51.308]  But what do we do when the people that told us that become lawless and use our cell phones to violate our constitutional rights?
[00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:59.330]  Get a Privacy Case from PrivacyCase.com today and stop this high-tech iron curtain from crushing our right to privacy.

[00:24:11.365 --> 00:24:16.507]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:19.528]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:19.548 --> 00:24:27.352]  People have to admit they've been conned.
[00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:32.694]  The average healthcare price has already doubled just five months into Obamacare.
[00:24:32.714 --> 00:24:35.255]  It's set to quadruple by 2014.
[00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:37.956]  It cuts the quality of care.
[00:24:38.973 --> 00:24:40.013]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:24:40.314 --> 00:24:56.901]  On average, I've got the polls right here, I'm going to be going over them, the average quote minority who's an immigrant or has become a citizen even recently, 80 plus percent, vote for socialism, for communism, for literally taking my guns, taking your guns.
[00:24:58.361 --> 00:25:03.924]  And I'm sorry, people on average that come from China, people that come from Mexico, people that come from Eastern Europe,
[00:25:04.997 --> 00:25:08.760]  Folks that come from all over, they're not used to owning guns and they're used to the government telling them what to do.
[00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:12.943]  And man, a government's going to give them some free welfare and stuff?
[00:25:14.104 --> 00:25:17.426]  And MSNBC tells them the white Americans hate you?
[00:25:18.146 --> 00:25:19.667]  Show them, get their guns?
[00:25:20.908 --> 00:25:22.329]  And they go, the government's my friend?
[00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:23.870]  Alright, I'm with the big government now.
[00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.312]  I'm going to vote to take everything you got.
[00:25:27.333 --> 00:25:29.054]  I'm going to vote for higher taxes on you.
[00:25:30.168 --> 00:25:47.391]  And then it's a bunch of offshore criminal banks publicly militarizing the police, setting up martial law, making the presidency a dictatorship, and using outside groups to come in and get free everything and vote to take our guns, our children, everything.
[00:25:48.071 --> 00:25:50.032]  The Democrats are going to bring in a national draft, too.
[00:25:50.052 --> 00:25:53.092]  We're going to have to serve them as military slaves.
[00:25:53.112 --> 00:25:55.553]  We're going to have to supply our kids to the empire now.
[00:25:56.894 --> 00:26:02.601]  I mean, this is a sick system, folks, where you can bring people in to vote to make people slaves.
[00:26:03.602 --> 00:26:06.125]  That's why we have a Bill of Rights, so that people can't vote.
[00:26:06.805 --> 00:26:10.870]  Democracy, a pure democracy, is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:16.597]  If there were two wolves and a sheep, one was named Bob, one was Ralph, and one was Tom.
[00:26:17.904 --> 00:26:19.525]  Okay, and Tom is the sheep.
[00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.528]  The other two guys, the wolves, vote.
[00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:25.611]  And the sheep says, well, I'd like to eat some grass.
[00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:26.652]  And the wolves say, you know what?
[00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:28.453]  We're gonna veto that.
[00:26:28.493 --> 00:26:29.154]  There's two of us.
[00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:33.237]  Muttons on the list here.
[00:26:33.338 --> 00:26:33.998]  Lamb chops.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.981]  Lamb chops.
[00:26:38.542 --> 00:26:39.923]  And we're like, hey, it's democracy.
[00:26:40.464 --> 00:26:43.807]  Don't be racist, sheep, against the wolves.
[00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.991]  And this is how the globalists have always operated.
[00:26:50.011 --> 00:27:00.076]  When the Democrats were the majority in the Ku Klux Klan, they ran their political systems to oppress whites by saying, well, at least we protect you from the blacks.
[00:27:00.636 --> 00:27:05.139]  And then when the whites didn't put up with that, they said, okay, we'll be the racial politics now with the minorities.
[00:27:05.219 --> 00:27:06.239]  And it's just sick.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.581]  And by the way, all those folks on MSNBC know exactly what they're doing.
[00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:16.805]  Just like George Soros knew what he was doing when he was a teenager, running around, collaborating, ferreting out hidden Jews.
[00:27:17.765 --> 00:27:20.787]  But he's a liberal and gets awards from the Jewish groups.
[00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:23.648]  Because if you are a Nazi collaborator, you're good.
[00:27:24.249 --> 00:27:26.730]  If you fight a modern fascist takeover, you're bad.
[00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.891]  And you've just got to learn this, folks.
[00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:33.314]  You've got to learn how the mafia government works.
[00:27:34.274 --> 00:27:36.496]  So, truth is self-evident.
[00:27:36.536 --> 00:27:45.361]  That's why I was going to come on air today and say the Republicans are committing suicide and this is a public execution
[00:27:46.423 --> 00:27:47.204]  Of the Republic.
[00:27:47.444 --> 00:27:49.425]  And look at all the other stuff that accompanies this.
[00:27:50.666 --> 00:28:05.515]  What message does it send if you tell tens of millions of illegals here that are already legal, they do a few show deportations, that are already here illegal, what does it do if you say you're legal even if you're a felon?
[00:28:06.175 --> 00:28:08.076]  You come in and pledge you won't be a felon anymore.
[00:28:08.096 --> 00:28:10.778]  Kind of like John Corzine.
[00:28:12.543 --> 00:28:15.405]  But if you're deaf and walking away from the police, they'll kill you.
[00:28:15.745 --> 00:28:19.007]  That's okay, but if you're illegal aliens committing felonies, that's alright.
[00:28:19.367 --> 00:28:20.027]  Aggravated felons.
[00:28:20.988 --> 00:28:23.029]  Rapists, arsonists, you name it, they get to be legal too.
[00:28:23.409 --> 00:28:24.150]  Read the legislation.
[00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:33.916]  What's going to happen with 700 million Latin Americans, because that's the group that can get here the easiest, what's going to happen when 700 million Latin Americans hear that?
[00:28:34.716 --> 00:28:37.598]  Well, you already see a record influx of illegals pouring in.
[00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:47.034]  And man, you know, I'm tired of reading in the back of the paper where people are getting mugged and carjacked and killed on the ranches.
[00:28:47.995 --> 00:29:01.545]  I know three different people that have been deer hunting the last two years in South Texas, we're talking 50, 100 miles away from the border, who have been mugged in the dark walking to their deer stands or attacked at gunpoint.
[00:29:02.405 --> 00:29:05.547]  Even though they have a gun in their stand and robbed and pistol whipped by illegals.
[00:29:06.008 --> 00:29:07.529]  I have an article today where a university
[00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:28.386]  I'm going to cover this, is not going to allow, when they have crime alerts, they're not going to say what color the person is, because most of the people in this particular city that are seen mugging and attacking, and then they announce, the police announce, be on the lookout through the university alert system for a black male, red jacket.
[00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:31.300]  You know, driving a yellow truck.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.081]  No, no, no.
[00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.462]  You can say, a man driving a yellow truck.
[00:29:34.842 --> 00:29:35.283]  There it is.
[00:29:35.403 --> 00:29:39.145]  You students want crime alerts to avoid using racial descriptions.
[00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:40.946]  Hey, the media already does that.
[00:29:41.387 --> 00:29:43.148]  Unless it's a, what?
[00:29:43.968 --> 00:29:44.849]  Devil white.
[00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.251]  And folks, you know I've never been one of these white this, white that.
[00:29:48.591 --> 00:29:49.932]  But they're, they're forcing it.
[00:29:50.753 --> 00:29:54.075]  Literally, literally, if you're white, you're the devil.
[00:29:54.095 --> 00:29:56.797]  Unless you're John Boehner, and then you're fine.
[00:29:57.277 --> 00:29:57.898]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:57.918 --> 00:29:58.218]  Stay with us.
[00:29:59.178 --> 00:30:00.080]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.582 --> 00:30:02.165]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.185 --> 00:30:05.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:20.154]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:20.474 --> 00:30:22.315]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:23.215]  Fluoride!
[00:30:23.395 --> 00:30:24.976]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:31.638]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:31.878 --> 00:30:36.703]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:36.824 --> 00:30:42.930]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.313]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:30:45.573 --> 00:30:48.196]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:51.880]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:57.207]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:57.427 --> 00:31:02.233]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[00:31:02.533 --> 00:31:03.575]  I take it every day.
[00:31:03.715 --> 00:31:06.578]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:09.902 --> 00:31:11.543]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:15.306]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:31:15.446 --> 00:31:19.849]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:25.993]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:36.880]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.386]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:31:43.586 --> 00:32:00.542]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:05.864 --> 00:32:12.446]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:32:12.726 --> 00:32:17.568]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:32:17.748 --> 00:32:24.931]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:32:25.051 --> 00:32:30.455]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:32:30.695 --> 00:32:34.337]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:32:34.717 --> 00:32:39.220]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.664]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.

[00:32:48.126 --> 00:32:50.408]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:32:50.648 --> 00:32:55.231]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:32:55.411 --> 00:32:57.852]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:33:05.497 --> 00:33:06.538]  We're getting prepared.
[00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:07.179]  Are you?
[00:33:07.439 --> 00:33:08.539]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:33:27.023 --> 00:33:30.928]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:37.217]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:55.802 --> 00:33:58.605]  Alright, let me get to a couple clips here and then I'm going to give the number out.
[00:33:58.625 --> 00:33:59.646]  I want to talk about immigration.
[00:34:00.827 --> 00:34:10.816]  I mean, I want to talk about 30 million Americans going down to Mexico and getting given free health care, have their babies for free, and then say that Mexico belongs to the United States.
[00:34:11.497 --> 00:34:12.318]  I want to discuss that.
[00:34:12.358 --> 00:34:16.702]  I want to ask why American hospitality has been distorted to this point.
[00:34:17.102 --> 00:34:20.866]  And then we'll hear the argument, well, from Texas to California belong to Mexico.
[00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:34.604]  Well, yeah, and California belonged to the Russians at one time before that, and they're not claiming it, and Texas belonged to three other countries before Mexico even had it.
[00:34:35.645 --> 00:34:43.270]  Spain, France, I mean it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:48.374]  The truth is Mexico couldn't take over the Southwest from the Comanche.
[00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:51.358]  That's the reality of what happened.
[00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:56.086]  And so they brought in the Tennessee settlers to have a war.
[00:34:57.395 --> 00:35:01.757]  And again, I was on both sides of that.
[00:35:02.457 --> 00:35:13.883]  It's not like the movies sit there and tell you there were battles between the Native Americans and the settlers in Illinois and down into Tennessee and all across the nation.
[00:35:13.923 --> 00:35:21.786]  If you go back to the 1820s and 30s, where tens of thousands would die a week, where you'd have a hundred thousand Natives come down.
[00:35:24.597 --> 00:35:27.619]  Lead by, they were all intermarried and stuff.
[00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:29.720]  They called them at the time half-breeds.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:39.384]  I say that because the leader of one of the groups, I forget his name, was like a 6'5", huge half-breed guy.
[00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:42.766]  And they would just wipe out whole cities.
[00:35:43.406 --> 00:35:44.687]  And so that's the type of stuff that went on.
[00:35:45.207 --> 00:35:48.169]  And so I don't blame Mexico for not being able to conquer the Southwest.
[00:35:48.911 --> 00:35:53.692]  Mexico just said, all right, you guys just wiped out everybody in the Midwest.
[00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:54.532]  Come on down here.
[00:35:55.512 --> 00:35:57.033]  And so that's basically what happened.
[00:35:57.933 --> 00:36:03.734]  And of course, all the natives weren't killed, even though I had some family who was in the Trail of Tears.
[00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:05.694]  A lot of them just intermarried.
[00:36:06.134 --> 00:36:13.576]  And that's basically why most people in Texas, if they're originally from Texas, have Native American blood in them, because most people just ended up intermarrying.
[00:36:15.197 --> 00:36:25.360]  It was the warlike tribes, though, that got annihilated, like the Comanche and the Apache and folks like that, because they wouldn't give up, which I'm not knocking.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.421]  I mean, a lot of those people are my ancestors.
[00:36:27.941 --> 00:36:37.944]  The whole point is that this is the nature of cultural collisions, and the globalists are manipulating that right now.
[00:36:38.484 --> 00:36:42.485]  So just get real, everybody, about what's really happening, what's really going on here.
[00:36:44.233 --> 00:36:56.243]  Now, again, if we had 30 million illegals here who were libertarians and who didn't take welfare, we didn't have a socialist, globalist government, they were pro-gun, quite frankly, we need 30 million people.
[00:36:56.884 --> 00:36:59.986]  We've aborted 55 million blacks, Hispanics, whites.
[00:37:01.487 --> 00:37:03.289]  We've aborted the people that were already here.
[00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.672]  And so, quite frankly, you've got to have 2.1 adults for every
[00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:09.331]  We're good to go.
[00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:31.605]  Are like Paraguay.
[00:37:32.566 --> 00:37:38.548]  And before a lot of you want us to be Latin America, I suggest you go to Latin American cities.
[00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:45.432]  If you like to see sewage running down the road and naked babies running around the streets and disease and death.
[00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:46.692]  I mean, it's scary.
[00:37:46.812 --> 00:37:47.332]  It's sad.
[00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:49.053]  It's bad.
[00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:51.994]  And we're not building up those nations.
[00:37:52.035 --> 00:37:57.377]  We are de-industrializing them while they build industrial zones and pay people a dollar an hour if they're lucky.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:07.126]  So make no mistake, just like Obamacare, that minorities and Poles are wildly still in support of, this is a screw job for everybody.
[00:38:07.167 --> 00:38:12.891]  The globalists are for it, just like they were for the Iraq War, just like they're for backing Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:38:13.772 --> 00:38:15.193]  Everything they're for is bad.
[00:38:16.514 --> 00:38:20.577]  Just like they're for NAFTA and GATT and all these new TPP deals and the rest of it.
[00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:24.260]  What the globalists stand for is bad, period.
[00:38:26.178 --> 00:38:30.921]  A total free number to join us to talk about the North American Union, and really the end of America.
[00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:38.385]  If they pass this, they've already been issuing for years this North American ID, and it'll be selectively enforced.
[00:38:38.825 --> 00:38:42.067]  You won't have any rights in Mexico, but they'll have all the rights in the world up here.
[00:38:42.507 --> 00:38:43.767]  You won't have any rights in Canada.
[00:38:43.827 --> 00:38:44.988]  It's only the U.S.
[00:38:45.008 --> 00:38:46.469]  that's going to be overrun.
[00:38:48.414 --> 00:38:54.920]  And I want to get your take on this.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:54.980]  800-259-9231.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.881]  800-259-9231.
[00:38:56.021 --> 00:39:05.570]  And MSNBC and CNN tell the majority minorities over and over again, well you're going to win when you get the guns, when you take the guns.
[00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.672]  You're going to win when we bring in the socialism.
[00:39:07.692 --> 00:39:10.435]  You're going to win when you get to bring in your families.
[00:39:11.135 --> 00:39:12.717]  Oh yeah, you're going to win alright.
[00:39:12.737 --> 00:39:13.798]  You're going to have nowhere to run.
[00:39:15.213 --> 00:39:22.841]  Because America is going to look just like any other third world country in Eastern Europe or in the poorer areas of Asia.
[00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:24.562]  I mean, we're done.
[00:39:24.602 --> 00:39:31.149]  And the globalists will live in their walled off central city areas and their rural, you know, controlled zones with police everywhere.
[00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:34.052]  And then all the rest of us are going to live in abject poverty.
[00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:38.732]  Let me tell you, Americans are already working two, three jobs, eating bad food.
[00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:48.676]  I mean, I drove down to the University of Texas area yesterday because I tried to bypass some traffic, out doing some paperwork, and got stuck in traffic for an hour, going about five miles.
[00:39:49.476 --> 00:39:52.137]  And I got to look at the people of America.
[00:39:53.237 --> 00:39:55.098]  And let me tell you, people aren't looking too hot.
[00:39:56.254 --> 00:39:57.355]  People aren't looking too healthy.
[00:39:57.375 --> 00:39:58.975]  They're not looking too smart either.
[00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:01.497]  And I don't care if they're black, white, Hispanic.
[00:40:01.517 --> 00:40:02.677]  People look like they've been run over.
[00:40:03.038 --> 00:40:04.438]  Like they've been put in a microwave oven.
[00:40:04.818 --> 00:40:06.759]  Like they've been drinking toxic waste or something.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.160]  And let me tell you, they have been.
[00:40:10.461 --> 00:40:14.584]  And let me tell the population out there something they need to know as well.
[00:40:16.124 --> 00:40:18.986]  The globalists with the singularity and the population reduction
[00:40:21.024 --> 00:40:26.228]  El Norte is not going to be some Hispanic palace in some Hispanic kingdom 25-30 years from now.
[00:40:26.628 --> 00:40:30.031]  The globalists do plan to release bioweapons and reduce population.
[00:40:30.772 --> 00:40:33.193]  They do plan on bringing in martial law and world government.
[00:40:33.774 --> 00:40:35.335]  And all of us are under attack.
[00:40:35.815 --> 00:40:37.737]  All of us are being scientifically targeted.
[00:40:38.177 --> 00:40:40.399]  All of us are having poison fluoride put in our water.
[00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:44.662]  All of us are having Obamacare written by offshore ruthless crime syndicates.
[00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:49.007]  Literally hammering us.
[00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:52.089]  All of us are under New World Order conditioning.
[00:40:53.730 --> 00:41:11.260]  And it doesn't matter because even if we're all under attack, even if the reality says it's all part of a globalist game, for people put into racial politics and tribal politics, which has been real since the beginning of our species, we are primitively designed and hardwired to be tribal.
[00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:34.769]  And because we're not tribal about private property, because we're not tribal about sticking up for the underdog, because we're not tribal about standing up for the family, because we're not tribal about keeping control of government, because we're not tribal about buying local, because we're not tribal about common sense and being territorial, because we don't stick together as humans against the globalists, we're gonna lose, they're gonna win.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.441]  And I didn't finish telling this story.
[00:41:39.461 --> 00:41:41.102]  I'm going to tell this story and then give the number out.
[00:41:41.202 --> 00:41:41.943]  I'll give the number out now.
[00:41:42.043 --> 00:41:42.223]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:42.283]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:42.303 --> 00:41:42.884]  First-time callers.
[00:41:42.904 --> 00:41:44.645]  I haven't done that in a few weeks.
[00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:46.667]  First-time callers, by the way.
[00:41:46.687 --> 00:41:46.727]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:46.747 --> 00:41:49.649]  But let me tell you how we're all under attack.
[00:41:49.669 --> 00:41:52.251]  One of my good friend's daughters basically collapsed about a week and a half ago.
[00:42:07.478 --> 00:42:20.543]  They took her to Dell Children's Medical Center and they went in there and the place was packed with small children.
[00:42:22.444 --> 00:42:26.226]  And the nurses and doctors told them, yes, we've never seen something like this.
[00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:33.359]  We're seeing hundreds of children a week that are, hundreds, they're even talking about building emergency tents outside.
[00:42:33.379 --> 00:42:38.922]  They've done that before for the fake flu deal, who are coming down with type 1 diabetes.
[00:42:38.942 --> 00:42:40.803]  And they go, well, it's genetic.
[00:42:42.664 --> 00:42:44.625]  But being sick triggers it.
[00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:51.048]  And whatever virus is going around, the hospitals are all full of 2 and 3 year olds.
[00:42:57.794 --> 00:43:04.157]  And when he was telling me this, I had a little click, and I didn't say it, and he said to me, he goes, you know, I think it's the virus that is doing it.
[00:43:04.577 --> 00:43:10.900]  If they say that it's genetic and nobody in my family or my wife's family, he was saying, has ever had type 1 diabetes, why is it an epidemic?
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.021]  I don't buy that.
[00:43:12.041 --> 00:43:14.502]  And he goes, I think it's the virus.
[00:43:14.722 --> 00:43:22.766]  Well, the doctors said the virus triggered it, but they've been told in policy to not tell people that it's viral pancreatitis.
[00:43:24.744 --> 00:43:30.489]  So I called my dad, who's a smart guy and an oral surgeon and a doctor, but also a chemist, a dentist.
[00:43:31.636 --> 00:43:42.063]  And I said, Dad, isn't there some kind of disease, and it's temporary usually, in the pancreas caused by viruses, just like you can get the mumps in the face and have your face swell up?
[00:43:42.643 --> 00:43:46.046]  Because, you know, I knew this knowledge, but you forget the details.
[00:43:46.066 --> 00:43:48.247]  And he goes, yeah, that's viral pancreatitis.
[00:43:48.287 --> 00:43:49.548]  There's hundreds of types of it.
[00:43:49.928 --> 00:43:51.369]  Hundreds of known viral strains.
[00:43:51.870 --> 00:44:01.116]  Most of the time, the pancreas comes back in a few weeks to a few months, especially if they give them some of the right treatments and the right diet.
[00:44:01.976 --> 00:44:10.440]  But they don't let any of the doctors say that because Big Pharma makes too much money off of the diabetes medications.
[00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:12.762]  And I went, thank you.
[00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:17.804]  So I went online, checked it, called him back, and I said it's viral pancreatitis.
[00:44:17.824 --> 00:44:18.765]  That could be what it is.
[00:44:19.205 --> 00:44:21.186]  Well, undoubtedly it's viral pancreatitis.
[00:44:21.546 --> 00:44:26.048]  The kids get a virus, then suddenly their pancreas stops working.
[00:44:26.969 --> 00:44:30.911]  That's like saying you're susceptible to the bubonic plague.
[00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:35.390]  Genetically, so one person dies, the other doesn't.
[00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:36.211]  It doesn't matter.
[00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:39.733]  It's still the bubonic plague bacteria that's killing you.
[00:44:41.315 --> 00:44:44.797]  Just like some people are more susceptible to smallpox than others.
[00:44:44.937 --> 00:44:49.560]  It doesn't matter if you're genetically not as resistant to it, still it's the smallpox that's making you sick.
[00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:55.665]  That's why they say everything's genetic now, so they can ignore the real cause of it.
[00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:06.802]  Sure, there are some people you can shoot three or four times in the chest, and genetically their heart's so strong, it'll coagulate and the muscle's so tough it'll keep going for a while you might even live.
[00:45:07.483 --> 00:45:09.383]  Other people, you shoot them once in the heart, they'll die.
[00:45:09.403 --> 00:45:12.024]  Doesn't matter, it's the bullets going into your heart that kills you.
[00:45:12.644 --> 00:45:15.465]  This is how screwed up medicine's gotten, where they're saying everything's genetic.
[00:45:15.725 --> 00:45:16.926]  Well, of course it's genetic.
[00:45:17.677 --> 00:45:27.325]  But when you've got a doubling, tripling, quadrupling, 4,000% increase in type 1, type 2 diabetes, depending on which one you look at in Hispanics.
[00:45:28.005 --> 00:45:30.067]  A doubling in whites, a tripling in blacks.
[00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:42.276]  You don't hear any of the black or Hispanic groups talking about why are the Hispanics all getting diabetes and getting their arms and legs cut off, because they are more genetically predisposed to get viral pancreatitis.
[00:45:42.316 --> 00:45:42.897]  I looked it up.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.542]  And they can't handle as much sugar genetically as well.
[00:45:48.582 --> 00:45:49.322]  That's true again.
[00:45:49.422 --> 00:45:50.083]  Processed sugar.
[00:45:51.563 --> 00:45:53.064]  The point is, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:54.365 --> 00:45:58.147]  No one's telling them, hey, don't... They tell Hispanics, drink diet drinks.
[00:45:58.167 --> 00:45:58.747]  This is on the news.
[00:45:58.767 --> 00:46:02.349]  Of course, we knew 20 years ago that aspartame triggers diabetes.
[00:46:02.369 --> 00:46:03.130]  It's now admitted.
[00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.392]  It destroys your pancreas and makes you fat and makes you crave food.
[00:46:06.672 --> 00:46:07.853]  That was in the news again last week.
[00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:10.354]  We knew that with medical doctor Russell Blaylock here.
[00:46:11.715 --> 00:46:13.236]  They are giving people...
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.400]  You see?
[00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:16.121]  You see?
[00:46:16.481 --> 00:46:18.523]  Oh, but the Hispanics, on average, think they're winning!
[00:46:18.563 --> 00:46:19.484]  La Reconquista!
[00:46:19.725 --> 00:46:20.986]  Gonna get the gringos' guns!
[00:46:21.026 --> 00:46:21.867]  Gonna run the government!
[00:46:22.087 --> 00:46:23.388]  Gonna make the gringo the slave!
[00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.371]  That's what they're putting... Oh, really?
[00:46:26.611 --> 00:46:28.713]  How you gonna do that when both your legs are chopped off?
[00:46:29.534 --> 00:46:31.055]  And your hands are chopped off and you're dead?
[00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.632]  See, when I drive by the bus stop and see 10 Hispanics with their legs all cut off, I see that all the time now.
[00:46:36.932 --> 00:46:39.252]  See, I want to pull over and warn them because I'm a racist white person.
[00:46:39.873 --> 00:46:51.717]  Just like I want to warn them that the Gardasil shot that they're forcibly giving all girls in Mexico will destroy their uterus and their ovaries.
[00:46:51.917 --> 00:46:53.377]  It targets the ovaries on record.
[00:46:54.638 --> 00:46:56.198]  About half of them will end up being sterile.
[00:46:56.878 --> 00:47:00.119]  And they'll end up dying of complications from all the different diseases that are caused by it.
[00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.600]  That was in the news just two weeks ago.
[00:47:02.918 --> 00:47:04.800]  Young woman's ovaries destroyed by Gardasil.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.463]  Merck forgot to research effects of vaccine on female reproduction.
[00:47:08.943 --> 00:47:10.164]  Ha, yeah, they forgot.
[00:47:11.185 --> 00:47:15.869]  When the Nazis would run people down in a pit to shoot them in the back of the head, they forgot what bullets do when they shoot you.
[00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.713]  I mean, it is so... We're all under attack is what I'm telling you.
[00:47:20.626 --> 00:47:21.966]  The New World Order is the enemy.
[00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.226]  They want open borders.
[00:47:23.246 --> 00:47:24.147]  You think that's a good idea?
[00:47:24.847 --> 00:47:30.068]  They want to legalize 30 million illegals as a political army because we haven't had time to educate them yet.
[00:47:30.748 --> 00:47:33.208]  The Libertarians are taking over the Republican Party.
[00:47:34.148 --> 00:47:38.469]  The Republican Party is making inroads via the Libertarians with blacks and Hispanics and Asians.
[00:47:38.849 --> 00:47:41.050]  But we don't have time to take the Republicans over, folks.
[00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:46.951]  You've got to wake up out there as a Hispanic, and you've got to speak out to people that can't understand English.
[00:47:47.611 --> 00:47:48.571]  And you've got to warn them.
[00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:53.541]  Does Mecha and La Raza tell you not to go have abortions?
[00:47:53.581 --> 00:47:54.602]  No, they tell you to have abortions.
[00:47:55.542 --> 00:47:56.883]  Do they tell you not to take the vaccines?
[00:47:56.943 --> 00:47:58.004]  No, they tell you to take the vaccines.
[00:47:58.024 --> 00:47:59.325]  Do they tell you to take the Gardasil?
[00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:00.346]  They tell you to take the Gardasil.
[00:48:01.907 --> 00:48:03.988]  Do they tell you why you're getting diabetes?
[00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:07.010]  No.
[00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:11.153]  See, they want to attack us all, folks, while they're killing the Hispanics with one hand.
[00:48:13.315 --> 00:48:17.638]  While they're killing the Hispanics with one hand, with Gardasil and abortion and GMO and aspartame.
[00:48:18.612 --> 00:48:24.917]  They're also going to use the Hispanics as a weapon wave to come in and vote to get the guns and everything and then have us all fight with each other.
[00:48:25.197 --> 00:48:28.139]  I mean, it's time to wake up to this situation.
[00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:28.199]  800-259-9231.
[00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:29.960]  Let's start going to this clip here, though.
[00:48:34.457 --> 00:48:38.402]  Out of Pittsburgh, as employees learn, we should do this here.
[00:48:38.442 --> 00:48:40.264]  I got to tell the employees what's about to happen here.
[00:48:40.765 --> 00:48:44.429]  In Pennsylvania, a company learned that the increased health cost due to Obamacare.
[00:48:44.649 --> 00:48:46.552]  Here's that clip we're going to go to break.
[00:48:46.712 --> 00:48:47.052]  Here it is.
[00:48:47.393 --> 00:48:53.240]  Outside Simonetta Collision and Car Care, it's a frigid two degrees inside.
[00:48:54.621 --> 00:49:00.124]  Gary Simonetta's employees are getting ready for a pretty heavy meeting Gary has been dreading for months.
[00:49:00.324 --> 00:49:03.626]  What I have here is the benefit sheet from last year.
[00:49:04.327 --> 00:49:05.087]  What you were on in 2013.
[00:49:06.088 --> 00:49:09.189]  Charles Moore has handled the company's group health insurance for 19 years.
[00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:16.195]  Here is the new plan that we had to switch to that takes into account the Obamacare regulations.
[00:49:16.415 --> 00:49:38.592]  As our cameras roll, 47-year-old Dave, who's single, Judy, a 53-year-old mother of one, 39-year-old Brian, who also has one child, 48-year-old mother of two, Christy, and Jeff, who's single and 42, all find out for the first time how the Affordable Care Act will affect their medical coverage and how much they're going to pay for it.
[00:49:38.912 --> 00:49:39.653]  Jeff, there's yours.
[00:49:40.773 --> 00:49:42.975]  I just folded these up because they are private numbers for everybody.
[00:49:43.015 --> 00:49:47.637]  It's what your new monthly premium is going to be for this plan.
[00:49:47.737 --> 00:49:56.362]  Last year's 6% premium increase has now exploded five-fold to an average 32% jump and that is just for starters.
[00:49:57.043 --> 00:50:04.467]  That 32% increase includes increasing the deductible as well to try and get something modestly priced.
[00:50:04.727 --> 00:50:05.507]  Look at the numbers.
[00:50:05.747 --> 00:50:08.889]  Jeff and Dave used to have a $1,250 deductible.
[00:50:09.249 --> 00:50:13.271]  Since Obamacare went into effect, it's now jumped 60% to $2,000.
[00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:17.473]  That's nothing compared to Brian, Christy and Judy who have kids.
[00:50:17.753 --> 00:50:18.993]  They're going to pay twice that.
[00:50:19.314 --> 00:50:20.414]  Four grand.
[00:50:20.654 --> 00:50:22.615]  This was the best option we could find.
[00:50:22.995 --> 00:50:24.256]  Co-pays are up too.
[00:50:24.336 --> 00:50:28.758]  Where it used to be your primary care doctor co-pay of $20, it's now going to be $40.
[00:50:29.358 --> 00:50:37.891]  Since Obamacare went into effect, pediatric dental and vision exams are covered as a bonus for Brian, Christy and Judy, but not for Jeff and Dave.
[00:50:39.013 --> 00:50:41.396]  Generic drugs are also significantly cheaper.
[00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:44.561]  We asked each staffer what they think of their new deal.
[00:50:44.701 --> 00:50:45.622]  The deductible's terrible.
[00:50:46.062 --> 00:50:49.664]  I mean, how many people actually can come up with the deductible money if they go into an emergency?
[00:50:49.744 --> 00:50:52.126]  And that's even mainstream whitewash news, folks.
[00:50:52.546 --> 00:50:54.467]  It keeps going up every six months to a year.
[00:50:55.007 --> 00:50:57.369]  My dad has already had his insurance go up twice.
[00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:58.209]  It's more than doubled.
[00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.850]  Geraldo Rivera's has tripled.
[00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.451]  We had him on.
[00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:01.912]  I mean, just get ready.
[00:51:01.952 --> 00:51:03.232]  I hope you enjoy all this.
[00:51:03.753 --> 00:51:05.954]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[00:51:06.074 --> 00:51:06.875]  A ton of news.
[00:51:06.895 --> 00:51:08.035]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:08.055 --> 00:51:08.476]  Stay with us.

[00:52:26.334 --> 00:52:27.175]  You asked for it.

[00:52:28.456 --> 00:52:32.599]  And we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[00:52:32.799 --> 00:52:36.421]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.

[00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:41.651]  I want to hit some other news that's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:54:41.691 --> 00:54:42.952]  You can also see LeeAnn McAdoo.
[00:54:44.252 --> 00:54:49.116]  As a 50s pent-up with a Barrett .50 cal, this is what drives the feminists crazy.
[00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:52.839]  They don't want women actually armed and able to defend themselves.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:55:05.468]  They want women absolutely anti-male, anti-child, only saving themselves in a worshipful way for the state, their God, their king, their master.
[00:55:06.449 --> 00:55:09.471]  But some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:09.951 --> 00:55:14.294]  No charges filed against cop who shot 72-year-old in his own driveway.
[00:55:15.555 --> 00:55:16.935]  Connecticut gun owners revolt.
[00:55:17.336 --> 00:55:19.177]  Refuse to register firearms in magazines.
[00:55:19.537 --> 00:55:23.459]  Just 38,000 of 2.4 million magazines registered.
[00:55:23.499 --> 00:55:27.381]  The police vowed to begin SWAT teaming and purging their enemies.
[00:55:28.422 --> 00:55:28.942]  Video.
[00:55:29.002 --> 00:55:30.743]  How the globalists want to control the internet.
[00:55:30.763 --> 00:55:31.344]  Very important.
[00:55:31.784 --> 00:55:32.424]  Protester.
[00:55:32.485 --> 00:55:34.686]  Cops laughed about having license to kill.
[00:55:36.104 --> 00:55:42.368]  We're going to be covering that case of the poor homeless man whose dad was a cop being killed and beaten to death over 20 minutes.
[00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:51.354]  Well, the cops went and on record, it's on the local news, arrested a peaceful demonstration calling for justice because you don't have freedom in America.
[00:55:51.374 --> 00:55:56.218]  I mean, it's bad when Putin cracks down on selective foreign-funded rallies.
[00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:59.660]  But general demonstrations are allowed in Russia.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.641]  But here they're not.
[00:56:01.618 --> 00:56:05.121]  And the cops put him on the paddy wagon and said, when we get you back, we're going to beat your faces in.
[00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:09.804]  And reportedly, basically said, we can kill whoever we want and celebrated that young man's death.
[00:56:12.426 --> 00:56:14.528]  And a lot of cops will be like, hey, don't put cops down.
[00:56:14.548 --> 00:56:16.829]  Hey, all I know is a lot of cops are nice.
[00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:20.232]  A lot of cops are absolute psycho goons.
[00:56:21.716 --> 00:56:23.138]  And they're taking over.
[00:56:23.499 --> 00:56:25.382]  Just like we know in Mexico the cops are bad.
[00:56:25.822 --> 00:56:27.505]  Just like we know in North Korea the cops are bad.
[00:56:27.825 --> 00:56:32.092]  Stop acting like there's not a battle historically to keep police from becoming corrupt.
[00:56:33.604 --> 00:56:34.764]  And so another victory.
[00:56:34.964 --> 00:56:41.786]  It's like the Asian man that didn't speak English walking across the street and the cops say, stop, stop, stop behind him.
[00:56:41.806 --> 00:56:42.426]  He didn't hear it.
[00:56:42.926 --> 00:56:44.146]  So they beat him half to death.
[00:56:44.226 --> 00:56:48.367]  I mean, you know, I think they should have executed him and maybe his whole family just to make a point.
[00:56:48.827 --> 00:56:49.807]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:56:50.088 --> 00:56:54.188]  This is how sick all of this has gotten.
[00:56:55.129 --> 00:57:00.990]  But simply, simply amazing that the Fullerton police, the same one who had the two cops that got off,
[00:57:01.952 --> 00:57:25.974]  uh... in that uh... you know terrible terrible case of kelly thomas uh... now and from the protesters in the paddy wagons said this and regardless they arrested the peaceful protesters who were on the sidewalk that's like a case in north carolina i was reading about where they shot the hispanic man who was unarmed and killed him and then the people came out and protested so they attacked the peaceful protesters at a silent vigil i mean
[00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:29.424]  This is not really a free country anymore, folks.
[00:57:29.744 --> 00:57:32.167]  It's really frightening, the point we've gotten to.
[00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:35.271]  So that's some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[00:57:38.203 --> 00:57:43.166]  Very, very important breakdown of a government shutting down an 11-year-old's cupcake business.
[00:57:43.186 --> 00:57:44.747]  I'm going to cover that in the next hour as well.

[00:59:09.143 --> 00:59:17.206]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:17.546 --> 00:59:22.248]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:00:02.702 --> 01:00:04.643]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.804]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.693 --> 01:00:15.314]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.994 --> 01:00:16.995]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.755 --> 01:00:18.836]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.497 --> 01:00:20.297]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.078 --> 01:00:21.979]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:26.242]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.822 --> 01:00:30.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.787 --> 01:00:36.550]  More waves of massive winter cold because of global warming.
[01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:38.472]  We're going to be covering that.
[01:00:38.512 --> 01:00:41.494]  Senators try to sack NFL's non-profit status.
[01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:42.295]  That's a great idea.
[01:00:43.703 --> 01:00:47.864]  In places like Illinois, they're trying to ban kids baking cakes for bake sales.
[01:00:50.065 --> 01:00:52.046]  FAA stops drone beer deliveries.
[01:00:52.506 --> 01:00:54.647]  Amazon, don't hold your breath.
[01:00:54.687 --> 01:00:55.587]  Folks are already doing it.
[01:00:56.347 --> 01:00:58.808]  School seizes lunches from students and throws them away.
[01:00:58.848 --> 01:01:00.009]  That's all coming up.
[01:01:01.689 --> 01:01:10.052]  The big news here today, though, really, is the fact that the Republicans are about to commit suicide, not just for their party, but the country.
[01:01:10.072 --> 01:01:12.393]  Because if you legalize 30 million illegal aliens,
[01:01:14.278 --> 01:01:14.838]  What's going to happen?
[01:01:14.858 --> 01:01:16.038]  Well, 30 more million are going to come.
[01:01:16.078 --> 01:01:18.559]  I mean, no country's ever done this.
[01:01:19.659 --> 01:01:21.800]  No country has ever done this.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:24.620]  The globalists are literally, this is how they're bringing down America.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.481]  Because the immigrants get here and get all these freebies from the government.
[01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:30.582]  Well, of course, and then more are going to come.
[01:01:30.602 --> 01:01:30.962]  I mean, this is 101.
[01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:34.643]  And basically, the country's already dead, pretty much.
[01:01:34.703 --> 01:01:36.383]  But this is a nail in the coffin.
[01:01:36.743 --> 01:01:40.024]  And if they get this, the entire corporate power structure,
[01:01:41.442 --> 01:01:45.285]  The entire Republican leadership, the Democratic leadership, the offshore banks, they're all pushing it.
[01:01:46.085 --> 01:01:47.046]  Because they care about us.
[01:01:47.086 --> 01:01:49.127]  Just like they got Obamacare passed because they care about us.
[01:01:49.728 --> 01:01:53.671]  I mean, they will go to jail if we ever take the country back.
[01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:57.133]  That's why they want the country broken, divided, bankrupted.
[01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.435]  It is amazing.
[01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:01.176]  I mean, I've never heard of anything like this.
[01:02:01.216 --> 01:02:02.317]  This is just so incredible.
[01:02:02.937 --> 01:02:05.539]  Legal citizen in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:02:07.318 --> 01:02:08.338]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:02:08.598 --> 01:02:09.358]  I just want to call in.
[01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:20.780]  I'm from Indiana and pretty much the whole state, every little town, the city I live in now, Indianapolis, the big city, is pretty much infested with aliens.
[01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:25.181]  And, you know, I'm living through the nightmare myself right now.
[01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:29.422]  When I first moved to Indianapolis, there wasn't one illegal alien.
[01:02:29.522 --> 01:02:34.683]  And within the past six years, 90% of my whole area is now illegal aliens.
[01:02:35.482 --> 01:02:38.023]  I constantly have to look out my window.
[01:02:38.483 --> 01:02:47.646]  I've already had property damage, everything you can think of, that you guys in Texas and Arizona and California, that I will always watch on TV and see you guys going through.
[01:02:47.726 --> 01:02:49.307]  I go through it now every freaking day.
[01:02:50.668 --> 01:02:52.028]  Well, now wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:02:52.108 --> 01:02:58.790]  I mean, the universities are saying that they can't put out a report if there's been a mugging or a carjacking if it's a minority.
[01:02:58.931 --> 01:03:00.071]  So don't, don't, don't.
[01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:02.212]  It's white people that are committing the crime.
[01:03:02.252 --> 01:03:02.712]  Just say that.
[01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.094]  Oh yeah, well that's what the cops do.
[01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:08.016]  When I've had to call the cops numerous times, that's what happens.
[01:03:08.036 --> 01:03:09.037]  Nothing is done.
[01:03:09.618 --> 01:03:10.799]  You would not believe what I see.
[01:03:10.879 --> 01:03:11.860]  And I'm in Indiana again.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.122]  The things I see out my own window... Well, just wait until we get your guns.
[01:03:15.283 --> 01:03:17.845]  Once your guns are taken, it'll all be one big Chicago.
[01:03:18.225 --> 01:03:21.708]  We'll be like one big Mexico with 15,000 killed a year.
[01:03:22.068 --> 01:03:22.789]  It's gonna be great.
[01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:23.730]  You're not looking forward to that?
[01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:38.165]  Well, I think, Alex, what it's going to be is like the study that came out about the robots, since we're going to already, I think we've got at least 60 million illegal already, because again, every little town that I know of in this state alone, look how far we are from Mexico, is infested.
[01:03:38.445 --> 01:03:39.486]  It's got to be 60 million.
[01:03:39.826 --> 01:03:44.850]  Now, within that 30 years, that latest report, are they claiming that the robots are going to be 70% of the jobs?
[01:03:46.011 --> 01:03:47.893]  That's going to be the apocalypse right there.
[01:03:48.253 --> 01:03:49.674]  Well, all I know is this.
[01:03:51.215 --> 01:03:52.657]  You go out in the countryside,
[01:03:53.866 --> 01:04:05.261]  And the average white or black person is in a trailer watching satellite TV all day eating Walmart food with cancer and literally don't know what planets are on.
[01:04:06.403 --> 01:04:13.368]  And then you've got the illegals running around actually doing a lot of work and building stuff in the country, but they've taken over.
[01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:15.410]  In the cities it's a lot of crime and stuff.
[01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:20.194]  But my whole deal is then the immigrants have kids and then they turn into the same zombies.
[01:04:21.735 --> 01:04:26.579]  And then the problem is the immigrants vote for the Democrats who take the guns.
[01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:28.969]  I mean, I'll be quite frank.
[01:04:29.009 --> 01:04:30.730]  This country is just disease ridden.
[01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:32.710]  Across the board.
[01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:37.951]  It is truly mind boggling.
[01:04:38.931 --> 01:04:40.132]  Mind boggling.
[01:04:41.052 --> 01:04:42.012]  What you're talking about.
[01:04:42.092 --> 01:04:43.072]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:04:44.453 --> 01:04:45.833]  And this is the New World Order.
[01:04:46.113 --> 01:04:46.813]  This is what they do.
[01:04:47.433 --> 01:04:48.373]  Alright, appreciate your call.
[01:04:50.934 --> 01:04:54.015]  You know, I just want to move to Mexico and have kids for free.
[01:04:54.735 --> 01:04:55.895]  I can move down there with my wife.
[01:04:58.169 --> 01:05:02.415]  Or, you know, go to Mexico, get married again, go to Mexico, and have, like, 15 kids I've all paid for.
[01:05:03.696 --> 01:05:04.638]  Of course, that's not gonna happen.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.343]  But here, you're racist if you don't pay for them.
[01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:19.984]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:22.145]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:22.345 --> 01:05:23.026]  Fluoride!
[01:05:23.226 --> 01:05:25.027]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:25.147 --> 01:05:31.470]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:36.494]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:36.634 --> 01:05:42.758]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:45.140]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.002]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:05:48.322 --> 01:05:51.684]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:56.408]  You will find survival shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:57.248 --> 01:06:02.050]  InfoWarsLife Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.391]  I take it every day.
[01:06:03.531 --> 01:06:08.913]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:14.075]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:06:14.195 --> 01:06:16.316]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates?
[01:06:16.536 --> 01:06:17.296]  We're good to go.
[01:06:46.311 --> 01:06:46.771]  I'm good.
[01:07:09.409 --> 01:07:10.250]  The facts are in.
[01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.552]  The studies are legion.
[01:07:11.832 --> 01:07:19.201]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:22.825]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:23.586]  Simple.
[01:07:23.746 --> 01:07:28.111]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:33.917]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:07:34.177 --> 01:07:50.195]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:07:50.495 --> 01:07:54.738]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:07:55.078 --> 01:07:56.920]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:08:02.784 --> 01:08:07.047]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.529]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:14.639 --> 01:08:15.280]  Big Brother.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.981]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:17.701 --> 01:08:18.842]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:19.463 --> 01:08:20.283]  You want answers?
[01:08:21.044 --> 01:08:21.925]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.605 --> 01:08:26.228]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.788 --> 01:08:30.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:39.859]  Matt Buchanan says a push for immigration reform will spell the end of Boehner's speakership.
[01:08:41.873 --> 01:08:44.734]  It'll spell the end of this country as we know it.
[01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:48.215]  I mean, a lot of signposts show the end of this republic.
[01:08:49.155 --> 01:08:55.036]  The dictatorship in government, the out-of-control bureaucracy, the Bill of Rights Constitution butchered, the U.S.
[01:08:55.116 --> 01:08:58.697]  weighed on the list of economically free places to live and work.
[01:08:59.737 --> 01:09:04.019]  But you legalize 30 million illegals, that sends the message, come on up here, all the rest of you.
[01:09:04.559 --> 01:09:08.100]  Then you look at the voting demographics of the illegals, and I've got those numbers here.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.680]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:10.976 --> 01:09:11.777]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:11.797 --> 01:09:15.640]  We're going to go to your phone calls before I break all that down and get into all the other news.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.022]  But House GOP to Obama.
[01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:19.983]  Let's do the year of action together.
[01:09:20.664 --> 01:09:22.205]  That's the GOP leadership.
[01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:26.108]  The Ryan plan includes citizenship for illegals.
[01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:26.929]  Yeah.
[01:09:27.009 --> 01:09:27.990]  And then border security.
[01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:29.531]  What border security?
[01:09:29.551 --> 01:09:30.892]  You get here illegally, you're legal.
[01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:37.253]  Business execs are pushing GOP to pass bill because they care about us.
[01:09:37.833 --> 01:09:40.515]  Immigration officers warn amnesty would overload the system.
[01:09:40.535 --> 01:09:41.115]  That's the point.
[01:09:42.176 --> 01:09:45.297]  Senator Sessions said we should not cater to the whims of CEOs.
[01:09:45.797 --> 01:09:52.681]  Now these globalist CEOs look at their short term, extremely short term,
[01:09:54.881 --> 01:10:01.862]  Bottom line, and the overall globalist agenda, they don't, they're like grasshoppers that come eat a crop and fly off like locusts to the next.
[01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:05.423]  They're not looking at the continuity of the political system.
[01:10:06.043 --> 01:10:12.425]  I mean, if population means wealth, you would think India would be doing well, with a population as big as China's, 1.3 billion.
[01:10:12.685 --> 01:10:13.585]  They've now met China.
[01:10:14.845 --> 01:10:15.025]  No.
[01:10:16.405 --> 01:10:17.946]  It is the culture of liberty.
[01:10:18.326 --> 01:10:19.406]  If resources meant
[01:10:20.396 --> 01:10:20.656]  Wealth.
[01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.357]  You would think Africa would be wealthy.
[01:10:22.397 --> 01:10:24.659]  More resources than the other continent in the world.
[01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:30.002]  Mexico has roughly three times the raw resources that the United States has.
[01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:31.303]  It's an absolute pigpen.
[01:10:32.344 --> 01:10:33.144]  Absolute hell pit.
[01:10:33.705 --> 01:10:34.605]  Very beautiful country.
[01:10:35.426 --> 01:10:36.927]  Very nice people in many areas.
[01:10:37.047 --> 01:10:39.288]  Still, never had a real revolution.
[01:10:39.789 --> 01:10:41.410]  Never had a culture of promoting liberty.
[01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:46.373]  Again, doesn't mean America was perfect, but we had private property for the general public.
[01:10:48.985 --> 01:10:51.308]  What do you think happens to little poor farmers in Mexico?
[01:10:51.328 --> 01:10:59.737]  They've all been driven off their land, except in Chiapas, because they finally got some guns and started shooting people to try to take their land.
[01:11:01.119 --> 01:11:03.121]  And they have huge military invasions all the time.
[01:11:03.582 --> 01:11:06.205]  I've interviewed filmmakers that have been down there, very valiant people.
[01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:11.619]  And, you know, just showing the incredible tyranny they live under.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:20.141]  And, you know, I'd rather empower Mexico and build Mexico up, and 1776 Mexico, and then I wouldn't have an issue merging with Mexico.
[01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:31.423]  But it's like we have North Korea meets Freddy Krueger meets Raging Bull meets a bad acid trip in Mexico.
[01:11:32.543 --> 01:11:35.664]  What is it, like 75,000 killed in the last six years now that we know of?
[01:11:37.524 --> 01:11:40.765]  In the fake drug war, and I mean the police openly shake people down.
[01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.286]  I've been shaken down by them.
[01:11:44.987 --> 01:11:47.008]  And my family won't go to Mexico now, and I won't go.
[01:11:47.328 --> 01:11:49.729]  And my parents have been there probably a hundred times.
[01:11:50.309 --> 01:11:55.972]  My parents would go down all over southern Mexico, both sides of it, three, four times a year.
[01:11:55.992 --> 01:11:57.712]  I've been taken on there countless times in my life.
[01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:03.935]  And my parents, the last few times they went down there, it was so scary, even in traditionally safer areas, that they will not go.
[01:12:08.047 --> 01:12:13.894]  And we're told we gotta let unlimited people from this country come here and do whatever they want.
[01:12:14.194 --> 01:12:17.017]  Let me cover this article and then I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:12:17.778 --> 01:12:22.023]  Sessions warns how GOP immigration bill is bad politics, bad policy.
[01:12:22.323 --> 01:12:27.509]  He then goes over studies in this Weekly Standard article that show it drives down wages.
[01:12:27.549 --> 01:12:28.750]  You're like, well, how does it do that with a...
[01:12:29.773 --> 01:12:30.895]  With the minimum wage going up.
[01:12:31.577 --> 01:12:33.280]  Illegals that work in the black market, folks.
[01:12:34.242 --> 01:12:38.130]  And as soon as you legalize illegals, more will come, fill up the black market.
[01:12:39.312 --> 01:12:39.914]  You understand that?
[01:12:42.745 --> 01:12:46.547]  Continuing, GOP crafts plan to wreck the country, lose voters.
[01:12:46.607 --> 01:12:51.589]  And I don't usually agree with Ann Coulter, but this is the big story linked up on Drudge, and it's very accurate.
[01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:55.271]  House Republicans prepare to sell the country on immigration this week.
[01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:57.912]  Phyllis Schlafly has produced a stunning report.
[01:12:58.332 --> 01:12:59.813]  Let's get Phyllis Schlafly on about this.
[01:13:00.453 --> 01:13:02.114]  Immigration is changing the country.
[01:13:03.015 --> 01:13:08.118]  The report is still embargoed, but someone slipped me a copy and it's too important to wait.
[01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:38.399]  And that means guns and private property in the family.
[01:13:38.839 --> 01:13:44.963]  That's why they're now announcing, your kids don't belong to you, we're going to forcibly inoculate, we're going to teach five-year-olds how to masturbate in school.
[01:13:44.983 --> 01:13:46.424]  Because they've got us, folks.
[01:13:46.864 --> 01:13:55.310]  Just like when the Violence Policy Center in 2000, the front page of the Austin paper, said we don't care if Alex caught bribery at the Capitol and derails this bill this time.
[01:13:55.890 --> 01:14:01.074]  We've got your kids, and we've got the demographics, we're going to ban guns in America.
[01:14:02.964 --> 01:14:07.866]  The head of that group said they were so mad, literally, they had three bills about to pass.
[01:14:10.367 --> 01:14:19.691]  I was there with Jews in Preservation of Firearms, Jerry Peterson when he was a state senator, all of them, and they go, Alex, get out here with your camera.
[01:14:19.871 --> 01:14:21.432]  I was waiting to speak for like two hours.
[01:14:22.632 --> 01:14:26.854]  They were about to ban the shooting clubs for kids, YMCA, all of it.
[01:14:29.325 --> 01:14:38.268]  I banned the gun shows and I ran out and there was the local Democratic operative paying out like $500 a piece to each one of these guys.
[01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:46.130]  They had black guys that got up and said, we're black thugs and we're dangerous gangbangers and you better ban guns or people like us will get you.
[01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:49.971]  Using race again, like here's the scary black people ban guns.
[01:14:50.011 --> 01:14:50.932]  I mean, it was so insane.
[01:14:51.572 --> 01:14:52.512]  And I caught that on tape.
[01:14:52.532 --> 01:14:53.913]  There was a House Ethics Committee.
[01:14:53.933 --> 01:14:54.653]  They didn't indict
[01:14:55.433 --> 01:15:03.897]  The head of the committee and people involved, but they sent him a letter censuring him, and they credited that with shooting down the bills.
[01:15:03.937 --> 01:15:04.858]  That was the turning point.
[01:15:05.258 --> 01:15:09.060]  And they were in the paper, and that was 15 years ago, 14 years ago.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.041]  And they said, we don't care, Jones.
[01:15:11.961 --> 01:15:14.743]  Time is on our side, like Rolling Stone says.
[01:15:17.084 --> 01:15:17.664]  And it's sick.
[01:15:17.724 --> 01:15:23.127]  I mean, again, Mexico doesn't let any immigrants in, and when Guatemalans sneak across,
[01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:27.755]  Six months to a year, hard labor, in a slave camp.
[01:15:28.235 --> 01:15:28.816]  New York Times.
[01:15:28.836 --> 01:15:36.500]  I think the headline was, Mexico's Own Dark Immigration History.
[01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:41.003]  Or, Mexico's Own Dark Past with Immigrants, or something.
[01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:46.167]  You can pull it up, and it's like, yeah, we're not good either in America, we should have more borders, but they're bad too.
[01:15:48.188 --> 01:15:49.669]  We're bad compared to Mexico?
[01:15:52.605 --> 01:15:55.766]  Do you know what they do to the stupid party goers that go down there and drink and drive?
[01:15:56.206 --> 01:16:03.768]  You get a year in jail, they run a credit score, they run a background on your family, and if you're worth millions of dollars, it costs millions to get your kid out.
[01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:06.349]  If you're worth hundreds of thousands, it'll cost you $40,000.
[01:16:06.389 --> 01:16:10.070]  But it's like, oh, well that's Mexico.
[01:16:10.411 --> 01:16:11.131]  That's okay.
[01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:14.772]  God help us.
[01:16:14.892 --> 01:16:18.213]  And of course, it doesn't matter if you don't want to go to Mexico, because Mexico's come up here.
[01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:24.454]  And most of the Mexicans I talk to that own businesses and stuff, they're actually like, oh no, no, no, don't open the border.
[01:16:24.474 --> 01:16:25.615]  No, you're right, it's going to collapse.
[01:16:26.136 --> 01:16:28.217]  Oh, I couldn't even have a restaurant and a bar.
[01:16:28.237 --> 01:16:32.902]  I know this Mexican guy, former boxer, really nice guy, he's like 70 years old.
[01:16:34.406 --> 01:16:36.628]  Really nice fellow, gentlemanly fellow, real smart guy.
[01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:38.850]  He comes over when I go to his restaurant every once in a while.
[01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:39.751]  He's also got a bar there.
[01:16:40.571 --> 01:16:41.492]  I'll drink a beer or something.
[01:16:41.512 --> 01:16:45.256]  He's like, how about how the Mexican Mafia would shake him down and how great America is.
[01:16:45.656 --> 01:16:48.438]  Well, just get ready for it, folks, because that's where it is.
[01:16:48.779 --> 01:16:51.041]  All these Mexicans that ran up here to be away from the crime.
[01:16:51.061 --> 01:16:53.423]  It's like running from Chicago or something.
[01:16:54.223 --> 01:16:55.945]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:16:55.985 --> 01:16:57.967]  There's just some of the numbers right there.
[01:16:59.621 --> 01:17:11.972]  Where she breaks down, in all these big polls and studies, they break down that the illegals, 80 plus percent of the time, vote to take all the guns.
[01:17:13.436 --> 01:17:16.619]  Immigrants, all immigrants, have always been the bulwark of the Democratic Party.
[01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:19.681]  For one thing, recent arrivals tend to be poor and they need government assistance.
[01:17:20.141 --> 01:17:23.524]  Also, they're coming from societies that are far more left-wing than our own.
[01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:28.488]  History shows that rather than fleeing those policies, they bring their cultures with them.
[01:17:28.768 --> 01:17:33.672]  Yeah, it's like mainly white Californians have moved to Austin after collapsing their state.
[01:17:34.252 --> 01:17:35.713]  They don't know why they couldn't get a job there.
[01:17:35.733 --> 01:17:38.516]  They don't know why they can only get a job here and live better.
[01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.929]  They think it's heaven.
[01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:46.011]  But then they want to get rid of families, ban guns, ban cars in the city, harass everyone.
[01:17:46.031 --> 01:17:47.251]  I mean, it's just you can't help them.
[01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:49.752]  This is not a secret.
[01:17:49.772 --> 01:17:53.553]  For the last century, there's never been a period when a majority of immigrants weren't Democrats.
[01:17:54.874 --> 01:17:57.974]  At the current accelerated rate of immigration, 1.1 million new immigrants every year.
[01:17:57.994 --> 01:17:58.915]  That's just current.
[01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:00.355]  It's legal.
[01:18:00.795 --> 01:18:02.836]  Republicans will be a fringe party in about a decade.
[01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:04.667]  This is all in the major studies.
[01:18:04.707 --> 01:18:05.127]  They know this.
[01:18:05.527 --> 01:18:10.530]  Thanks to the endless polling, we have a pretty good idea of what most immigrants believe.
[01:18:11.531 --> 01:18:18.055]  According to Harris Poll, 81% of native-born citizens think that schools should teach students to be proud of being American.
[01:18:18.495 --> 01:18:20.016]  Only 50% of naturalized U.S.
[01:18:20.036 --> 01:18:22.617]  citizens think so, because they're taught to hate America now.
[01:18:23.878 --> 01:18:31.683]  While 67% of native-born Americans believe the Constitution is a higher legal authority than international law, only 37% of naturalized citizens agree.
[01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:34.598]  No wonder they vote 2-1 Democrat.
[01:18:35.739 --> 01:18:41.101]  The two largest immigrant groups, Hispanics and Asians, have little in common economically, culturally, or historically.
[01:18:41.442 --> 01:18:43.343]  But they overwhelmingly support big government.
[01:18:43.703 --> 01:18:45.784]  Obamacare, affirmative action, and gun control.
[01:18:47.165 --> 01:18:48.125]  Gonna kill some babies?
[01:18:48.145 --> 01:18:48.946]  Gonna take your guns.
[01:18:49.606 --> 01:19:00.230]  According to 2012 National Asian American Survey, as well as the Kaiser Foundation poll, only 40% of the general public holds a favorable opinion on Obamacare.
[01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:00.950]  42% unfavorable.
[01:19:01.271 --> 01:19:05.992]  Meanwhile, 51% of Asians have a favorable opinion of Obamacare.
[01:19:06.012 --> 01:19:07.393]  18% an unfavorable one.
[01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:12.735]  That means 82% are for it.
[01:19:13.295 --> 01:19:14.496]  Even Koreans support
[01:19:15.362 --> 01:19:17.463]  Obamacare, about 57% to 17%.
[01:19:19.244 --> 01:19:21.625]  Overall, 69% of immigrants like Obamacare.
[01:19:22.005 --> 01:19:25.246]  We're in 2010, Cooperative Congressional Election Study.
[01:19:25.807 --> 01:19:26.927]  And then it gets into the guns.
[01:19:26.947 --> 01:19:28.148]  I mean, it's just weird.
[01:19:28.208 --> 01:19:28.668]  It's over, man.
[01:19:29.048 --> 01:19:29.428]  It's over.
[01:19:31.009 --> 01:19:35.271]  I guess my goal has got to be to, I guess, I've never tried to make a bunch of money.
[01:19:35.311 --> 01:19:40.073]  I've tried to just put it into fighting the New World Order, but maybe I need to try to make money and bribe my way into Switzerland.
[01:19:41.035 --> 01:19:44.317]  That's the only place they've not let in people with no skills.
[01:19:44.797 --> 01:19:48.979]  And so they're so wealthy, they're just drowning in wealth, power, and prestige, and scientists.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.801]  Yes, I mean, I guess that's it.
[01:19:55.723 --> 01:19:58.665]  I know they're selling such racial hatred of whites, I probably can't go to Chile.
[01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:02.127]  God, I'm sorry for Western civilization.
[01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:02.687]  I'm sorry.
[01:20:03.487 --> 01:20:06.509]  Sorry for space travel and classical music.
[01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:08.070]  I apologize, I'm bad, okay?
[01:20:10.382 --> 01:20:16.264]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement.
[01:20:16.524 --> 01:20:18.304]  But only if they can detect a signal.

[01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:45.572]  Or maybe you think your law-abiding ways are too boring for them to care about you.
[01:20:46.132 --> 01:20:50.894]  Tell that to the Virginia farmer who was audited by the IRS because of her Tea Party activities.
[01:20:51.494 --> 01:20:56.896]  Or the Texas man who woke up to a SWAT team raid because of online comments he had made about his gun collection.
[01:20:57.157 --> 01:21:00.538]  No, God-fearing Americans like you are in the crosshairs.

[01:23:09.036 --> 01:23:11.618]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:11.878 --> 01:23:16.761]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:24.846]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:29.449]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:33.493]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:39.337]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:39.577 --> 01:23:42.360]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:47.904]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:48.104 --> 01:23:56.231]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:56.471]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:23:56.572 --> 01:23:59.474]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:23:59.494 --> 01:24:00.435]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:24:44.091 --> 01:24:46.792]  Look, the West has always been of two minds.
[01:24:47.933 --> 01:24:53.956]  Very altruistic, very open, wanting to empower humanity, but also very savage.
[01:24:55.076 --> 01:25:01.939]  And so, it is Western hospitality and the Western idea of lifting people up that has had our borders be so wide open.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.781]  Not just here, but in the original Europe.
[01:25:06.994 --> 01:25:10.977]  The problem is the globalist political class are creating division.
[01:25:11.298 --> 01:25:13.600]  Humans are naturally tribal or racist.
[01:25:14.761 --> 01:25:26.231]  Now if people's tribal idea is liberty and freedom and a shared common goal for human empowerment, then we could be a multi-racial cultural system.
[01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:29.654]  But the Democrats and the Socialists in Europe are cheating.
[01:25:30.728 --> 01:25:36.815]  They claim with one hand they want this empowerment, when they actually want people controlled by the state, and then fighting with each other.
[01:25:37.616 --> 01:25:39.998]  And that's why we should deport most of the illegals.
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:46.065]  We should treat the immigrants a third the way Mexico treats them.
[01:25:47.543 --> 01:25:50.264]  And if that happened, people would pull their hair out.
[01:25:50.864 --> 01:25:59.227]  So hey, don't worry those of you out there that think overrunning the country with people from all over the world, you know, could be stopped.
[01:26:00.168 --> 01:26:05.390]  Only if we reach into the minds of the people and get them to understand the globalist program.
[01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:10.372]  But the globalists want to bankrupt everyone anyways, so you have to be dependent on government regardless.
[01:26:11.972 --> 01:26:16.054]  You've got to either have a total shift in awakening, or humanity as we know it is done.
[01:26:17.776 --> 01:26:21.721]  But the third world itself is being targeted and abused and destroyed by the globalists.
[01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:24.184]  Mexico has been destroyed by NAFTA and GATT.
[01:26:24.784 --> 01:26:33.936]  They're forcing those poor people off their land at gunpoint for 30 years and forcing them up to Mexico City to live in conditions worse than the movie Soylent Green.
[01:26:34.376 --> 01:26:35.678]  My heart goes out to those people.
[01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:36.701]  I think?
[01:26:57.406 --> 01:26:58.547]  Trying to warn Hispanics.
[01:26:58.567 --> 01:26:58.947]  They're not.
[01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:04.089]  They're there to use you, just like the black leaders are a bunch of pimps over their people.
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:11.153]  And just like the white Republican leaders, using race politics themselves, are selling everybody out with open borders right now.
[01:27:11.473 --> 01:27:13.174]  Because they're all globalist pawns.
[01:27:13.514 --> 01:27:14.635]  Let's go to Ryan.
[01:27:15.555 --> 01:27:19.497]  Then we'll go to Dax, Barbara, Derek, and others.
[01:27:19.517 --> 01:27:20.557]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:27:21.358 --> 01:27:22.418]  Ryan in Kentucky.
[01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:23.059]  You're on the air.
[01:27:24.099 --> 01:27:24.880]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:25.420]  Hey, buddy.
[01:27:26.714 --> 01:27:30.776]  Yeah, well first of all, I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:27:31.617 --> 01:27:34.478]  I've got just a quick comment and then a question for you.
[01:27:35.639 --> 01:27:41.842]  First of all, I want to tell you that I do pray for you, and I pray for the Infowar, because we're all in this together.
[01:27:42.122 --> 01:27:42.422]  We are.
[01:27:43.442 --> 01:27:45.723]  We are, and it's inspired me.
[01:27:45.763 --> 01:27:48.785]  A group of us here locally, we've actually got something called the Oz Movement.
[01:27:49.594 --> 01:27:52.756]  You know, like the Wizard of Oz, who's really behind the curtain.
[01:27:52.796 --> 01:27:53.596]  That's a great idea.
[01:27:54.297 --> 01:28:05.903]  Sprinkling literature, you know, to everybody, you know, just to get them to look the right way, to quit looking towards Lord Obama, who's really behind the curtain.
[01:28:06.603 --> 01:28:13.987]  And, for example, we go up to, like, some of the hell places around here, and we'll put, like, a little pamphlet that has info war life on it.
[01:28:14.702 --> 01:28:20.494]  And it routes them to real good quality products and maybe that way it provides a little opening for them.
[01:28:20.534 --> 01:28:23.340]  And by the way, I want to plug your super male vitality.
[01:28:24.061 --> 01:28:24.622]  It works.
[01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:27.051]  And it works very well.
[01:28:27.431 --> 01:28:30.132]  So if anybody had any doubt about that, don't have any.
[01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:32.954]  It's a wonderful tool in the Infowars.
[01:28:32.994 --> 01:28:49.021]  Well listen, I used it for four months in the formulation before we even put it out, and Dr. Group says, boasts to me privately, that this is the most powerful raw liquid herbs, not from dry, in a special proprietary system of concentrating it out.
[01:28:49.882 --> 01:28:51.803]  So I would say use it responsibly.
[01:28:52.763 --> 01:28:59.710]  Believe me, believe me, it's the real deal and it's available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:00.610]  Thanks for the plug.
[01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:01.872]  What's your point on the immigration?
[01:29:03.893 --> 01:29:07.196]  Well, actually it's about the North American Union.
[01:29:07.417 --> 01:29:18.667]  First of all, for anybody out there who really honestly believes that Obama or any of them really honestly care about the average person, what I was looking for was he going to fulfill his promise
[01:29:19.307 --> 01:29:19.948]  We're good to go.
[01:29:42.105 --> 01:29:42.365]  Yes.
[01:29:42.685 --> 01:29:51.530]  And I'm wondering, is the collapsing of the dollar, is this what they're going after to bring in them?
[01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:52.771]  I appreciate your question.
[01:29:53.051 --> 01:29:54.272]  Guys, remind me if I forget.
[01:29:54.312 --> 01:29:56.453]  I'm going to answer that on the other side of this break.
[01:29:56.493 --> 01:29:57.854]  It's a very important question.
[01:29:57.954 --> 01:29:58.714]  More calls coming up.
[01:29:59.094 --> 01:30:00.035]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.896]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.916 --> 01:30:02.976]  I'll answer it straight ahead, folks.
[01:30:03.036 --> 01:30:05.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.665 --> 01:30:18.677]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:18.757 --> 01:30:26.888]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:27.148 --> 01:30:31.850]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:38.753]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:38.813 --> 01:30:45.895]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:45.995 --> 01:30:52.858]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:53.018 --> 01:30:57.364]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:57.504 --> 01:31:00.748]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:07.037]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:07.197 --> 01:31:08.879]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.364]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:31:12.625 --> 01:31:17.472]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:17.652 --> 01:31:24.843]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:31:24.963 --> 01:31:30.368]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:31:30.588 --> 01:31:34.332]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:32:09.272 --> 01:32:19.639]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:19.979 --> 01:32:21.820]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:22.720]  Fluoride.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:31.142]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:31.402 --> 01:32:34.242]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:32:34.342 --> 01:32:36.182]  And the results are on record.
[01:32:36.322 --> 01:32:42.443]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:42.644 --> 01:32:44.804]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:32:45.064 --> 01:32:47.684]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:32:47.984 --> 01:32:51.385]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:33:21.436 --> 01:33:23.577]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:24.038 --> 01:33:28.779]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.821 --> 01:33:36.442]  Okay, responding to the last caller's question and trying to hurry on to your other calls.
[01:33:37.883 --> 01:33:40.284]  It's very, very simple what's going on.
[01:33:40.764 --> 01:33:45.166]  There's different competing globalist programs of economics.
[01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:49.674]  And they're profiting and consolidating power through all of them.
[01:33:50.134 --> 01:34:00.120]  You have the IMF and the World Bank on the top of the planet, along with the XM Bank and the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, the OECD, that sets global standardization.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.101]  We're already in a corporate global government.
[01:34:02.942 --> 01:34:04.163]  They're phasing out cash.
[01:34:04.683 --> 01:34:13.989]  They're trying to get national and regional and state laws passed worldwide through continuity of government and continuity of agenda.
[01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:24.899]  To not let people be free and independent and local, and to phase out cash, and to phase out barter.
[01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:39.092]  And when you hear about the Amaro that was proposed in Money Magazine back in the 80s, 1989, and it's been promoted on CNN and things, we would then talk about the Amaro, the planned North American currency,
[01:34:40.114 --> 01:34:41.955]  And they would say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:34:41.995 --> 01:34:46.556]  Well, we weren't saying, even then, that the Amaro would end up being adopted.
[01:34:47.496 --> 01:34:54.879]  The point is, it was one of the competing ideas of regional currencies before a global currency.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.601]  But that was discussed in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[01:35:00.881 --> 01:35:09.404]  And then Lou Dobbs picked it up in the last decade and thinks, we're already under global currency with this special drawing rights
[01:35:10.834 --> 01:35:25.582]  Derivatives, credit default swaps, and scores of other synthetic financial instruments that are simply fancy accepted establishment counterfeit.
[01:35:26.683 --> 01:35:37.568]  If you go back to the Bank of England 300 years ago, they would have 10 pounds of paper money out there for every pound
[01:35:38.971 --> 01:35:39.272]  I think?
[01:35:58.268 --> 01:35:59.429]  For what they had actual metal.
[01:35:59.689 --> 01:36:05.713]  That's where checks started going back into Egypt, going back into Rome.
[01:36:06.154 --> 01:36:14.119]  You would have a piece of paper with the signet of the Lord or the Caesar saying this is redeemable for 500 cows.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:23.366]  Now let us rent your 20 ships or whatever to take this grain to Alexandria.
[01:36:24.426 --> 01:36:24.967]  Hypothetical.
[01:36:26.687 --> 01:36:27.928]  So it's a system pass barter.
[01:36:28.608 --> 01:36:35.512]  And then the Rothschilds 500 years ago in Germany, they began to get really good at having gold pawn shops everywhere.
[01:36:35.532 --> 01:36:47.980]  And then doing a form of payoff of local lords of letting them bring them gold and stuff, but checking out 10 times or more actual Rothschild paper than what was actually in the bank.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.601]  And then not making them ever pay it back.
[01:36:50.621 --> 01:36:53.403]  So it was a form of buying off government, form of bribery.
[01:36:55.267 --> 01:37:02.930]  And then you'd have runs on banks where people would try to bring their paper back and there wouldn't be enough gold or silver in there to redeem it.
[01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:15.015]  But it wouldn't matter because the local lord had already been given massive amounts of wealth from the fiat system and so he would station his guards
[01:37:16.266 --> 01:37:26.330]  Sometimes it would be brigade level, thousands of troops outside of the palaces of the banker and outside of his regional pawn shops.
[01:37:27.731 --> 01:37:29.191]  And that's what we see today.
[01:37:30.332 --> 01:37:35.173]  But they want to transcend completely the fractional reserve banking.
[01:37:35.494 --> 01:37:41.036]  So in the last 30 years, worldwide, they've stopped doing that, which let them take over.
[01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:44.654]  And they've gone to just pure counterfeit derivatives and other systems.
[01:37:45.234 --> 01:38:07.102]  Now, out of the crisis that's created, they want global cashless society, backed up with 100 trillion every few years of carbon taxes, Tobin taxes, money transfer taxes, wellhead taxes, on all human activity, paid to them to enshrine value in it.
[01:38:07.662 --> 01:38:10.203]  They're also debating whether it'll be partially gold-backed,
[01:38:11.383 --> 01:38:15.911]  It's going to be a spectrum, this is what it's going to be, because I've covered Deimos, I follow their writings.
[01:38:16.672 --> 01:38:19.536]  It's going to be a spectrum of commodities they can manipulate.
[01:38:20.077 --> 01:38:25.727]  Oil, sweet, crude, gold, silver, palladium, you name it, the whole spectrum.
[01:38:27.116 --> 01:38:33.500]  And then a spectrum of carbon and a spectrum of other indexes they can play and manipulate as well.
[01:38:33.921 --> 01:38:41.246]  And then everyone will be tied into this global digital panopticon control system and they'll tax you for every transfer.
[01:38:42.006 --> 01:38:45.368]  Again, it's the Tobin Tax for every credit under the Wellhead Tax.
[01:38:46.069 --> 01:38:49.932]  Global, regional, local, because computers can divide it all out.
[01:38:50.392 --> 01:38:51.653]  So everyone will get behind it.
[01:38:52.987 --> 01:38:57.071]  At the government level, getting their little cut of VAT sales taxes.
[01:38:57.591 --> 01:38:59.553]  It is going to be unbelievable.
[01:38:59.854 --> 01:39:08.562]  And it's going to transfer the wealth to the select corporations that write the laws that will be partially or fully exempt from the taxation aggregate model.
[01:39:13.166 --> 01:39:17.630]  It is the total form of slavery, total form of total
[01:39:19.961 --> 01:39:27.443]  Unfair weights and balances, inequality, there are not really words to describe the magnitude of the global plan.
[01:39:27.483 --> 01:39:30.663]  So they're going to bypass the North American Union currency entirely.
[01:39:31.403 --> 01:39:39.925]  They have a North American travel ID, I don't know, was it five, six, seven years old, that people that get signed on to this can travel to Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.
[01:39:39.945 --> 01:39:40.425]  back and forth.
[01:39:40.905 --> 01:39:42.466]  You'll have regional flavors.
[01:39:42.506 --> 01:39:48.187]  You'll still have dollars, you'll still have pesos, you'll still have the Canadian money, you'll still have
[01:39:49.653 --> 01:39:55.198]  But it will all be digitally demarcated in the larger system.
[01:39:55.218 --> 01:40:05.448]  Kind of like there's, last time I checked, 15 different regional Sports Illustrated magazines you can get, or video subscriptions.
[01:40:07.831 --> 01:40:09.833]  It's the same deal, but it's all Sports Illustrated.
[01:40:10.882 --> 01:40:12.864]  So everybody's looking for a chip in the arm.
[01:40:13.225 --> 01:40:15.207]  It'll be your face scan you buy and sell with.
[01:40:15.707 --> 01:40:19.111]  Everyone's looking for, you know, some Big Brother thing.
[01:40:19.151 --> 01:40:23.735]  It's already, you're already carrying it around and paying $500, $300, $200 for it, a smartphone.
[01:40:24.816 --> 01:40:27.239]  So it's already here, we're already in it, it's already going on.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.121]  It's already happening.
[01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:36.002]  You know, I told you they'd use this big drone rollout to have a freakout about drones.
[01:40:36.042 --> 01:40:40.285]  Then they would ban citizens having remote control airplanes or helicopters.
[01:40:40.745 --> 01:40:45.449]  And now as a gimmick, they were delivering beer and ice to ice fishermen.
[01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:50.653]  You know, flying the beer at 100 feet.
[01:40:53.373 --> 01:40:53.993]  Or even lower.
[01:40:54.013 --> 01:40:55.434]  The video I saw looked like 50 feet.
[01:40:56.015 --> 01:40:56.995]  Out to ice fishermen.
[01:40:57.616 --> 01:40:58.316]  Totally legal.
[01:40:58.356 --> 01:41:01.418]  There's no FAA regulation below 300 feet.
[01:41:01.498 --> 01:41:03.720]  But they're now imposing it, shutting it down.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.503]  And that article's up on InfoWars.com with Steve Watson with the video right now.
[01:41:10.524 --> 01:41:12.625]  Beer drone viral.
[01:41:12.645 --> 01:41:15.227]  Trump slapped down from government.
[01:41:16.528 --> 01:41:19.530]  Company owner finds himself on FAA blacklist.
[01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:19.790]  See?
[01:41:21.511 --> 01:41:22.812]  You got ice fishermen out there.
[01:41:26.115 --> 01:41:41.669]  I mean, look, that drone is at like 15 feet, totally safe, bringing a 12-pack of brew, with a camera, and it's a total gimmick, just to have a viral video, and then the blonde comes in to the guys and
[01:41:42.554 --> 01:41:44.915]  You know, they're all having a great time and they're ice fishing and she drinks a beer.
[01:41:45.335 --> 01:41:50.916]  And then the government comes and slaps it down, just like the girl that was baking cupcakes at home and selling it and she ended up in the paper.
[01:41:51.277 --> 01:41:56.078]  So they send basically militarized zoning people there, saying you've got to own a bakery, you can't do this.
[01:41:56.438 --> 01:41:59.099]  The idea is you can't have a garden in your backyard and sell fruit now.
[01:41:59.719 --> 01:42:01.540]  You can't have chickens in areas where you could have chickens.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.900]  This is agenda 21, the opposite of sustainability.
[01:42:06.901 --> 01:42:09.822]  And I told you, somebody will try to deliver stuff with a drone, they're going to man it.
[01:42:10.765 --> 01:42:18.551]  Government shuts down 11-year-old cupcake business, but the NFL is tax-exempt when they make billions a year.
[01:42:18.631 --> 01:42:20.953]  I mean, well of course, they're part of the mafia.
[01:42:22.314 --> 01:42:24.475]  And they put Obama in the NFL intro.
[01:42:25.356 --> 01:42:26.417]  And they say guns are bad.
[01:42:26.477 --> 01:42:27.658]  They say Obamacare is good.
[01:42:29.039 --> 01:42:30.560]  And they're a big gladiatorial diversion.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.461]  They're our new culture.
[01:42:31.961 --> 01:42:32.922]  So of course they're exempt.
[01:42:33.582 --> 01:42:40.447]  Google, Microsoft, Apple, General Electric, the top Fortune 100 are almost completely tax-exempt.
[01:42:40.807 --> 01:42:42.428]  Learn the facts, Jack!
[01:42:43.269 --> 01:42:45.571]  And they're the ones lobbying for higher taxes on the middle class.
[01:42:45.931 --> 01:42:47.312]  They're the ones lobbying for open borders.
[01:42:47.592 --> 01:42:49.914]  Gee, they're the ones lobbying for Obamacare.
[01:42:50.114 --> 01:42:53.376]  Do you think everything they do is to screw everybody?
[01:42:54.057 --> 01:42:56.338]  But oh now, be nice to the immigrants.
[01:42:56.358 --> 01:42:57.219]  They're so sweet.
[01:42:58.422 --> 01:42:59.222]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:42:59.242 --> 01:43:00.603]  Yeah, um, I just wanted to basically make a comment.
[01:43:28.567 --> 01:43:31.028]  There's basically everything you said about the illegals.
[01:43:31.448 --> 01:43:35.049]  There's way more than 12 million illegal aliens in the United States.
[01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:38.451]  There's easily 35 to 40 million, but they never want to come out.
[01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:41.372]  He was confirmed to be 31 million like a decade ago.
[01:43:42.252 --> 01:43:46.814]  Well, yeah, and I'm here in Utah, and we're just overloaded with them.
[01:43:46.854 --> 01:43:47.474]  I mean, you go out
[01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:52.354]  You go to any place and I hear more people speaking Spanish than English.
[01:43:52.374 --> 01:43:54.715]  I mean, look, there's nothing but Spanish signs everywhere.
[01:43:54.936 --> 01:43:59.339]  And my whole issue is, again, I don't even... I shouldn't even have to qualify this.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:05.844]  It's the fact that they're literally being turned into Democratic Party operatives and voting to literally make me their slave.
[01:44:06.765 --> 01:44:07.766]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:44:08.126 --> 01:44:13.771]  I mean, where in history can they bring in foreigners to then use a voting system to enslave everyone?
[01:44:15.154 --> 01:44:26.797]  They're probably never going to be another Republican president because all these red states are going to turn blue and they'll vote him in.
[01:44:26.877 --> 01:44:34.199]  Another comment I have is, it's been several years ago, they had a big rally down in Salt Lake.
[01:44:34.519 --> 01:44:39.940]  There was easily over 100,000 illegals protesting down there for their rights.
[01:44:40.595 --> 01:44:41.675]  For their citizenship.
[01:44:41.856 --> 01:44:43.076]  And it was kind of funny.
[01:44:43.816 --> 01:44:51.060]  I listen to you every day on the radio and you had the mayor of Salt Lake, Rocky Anderson.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:51.560]  Yeah.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:54.201]  You had him on the radio with you.
[01:44:54.701 --> 01:44:56.522]  He was one of the main guys leading the group.
[01:44:56.582 --> 01:44:59.143]  He was 100% in support of it.
[01:44:59.183 --> 01:45:03.365]  He led the entire group of 100,000 down Main Street there.
[01:45:03.605 --> 01:45:05.966]  And I was down there protesting against it.
[01:45:05.986 --> 01:45:09.948]  I just couldn't believe that a current mayor of the city
[01:45:10.919 --> 01:45:17.424]  I don't think he's a bad guy.
[01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:18.925]  A lot of people actually believe this is a good thing.
[01:45:19.325 --> 01:45:22.828]  The problem is that they use it as a political tool.
[01:45:23.908 --> 01:45:27.051]  It is a form of subterfuge.
[01:45:27.131 --> 01:45:28.812]  It is a form of subversion.
[01:45:30.094 --> 01:45:36.838]  And the entire power structure's behind it, so it's easy for people to get behind it, because that's the plan.
[01:45:37.579 --> 01:45:42.962]  And I'm telling you folks, they will ban the guns, they will jack the taxes up to 90%, just like France.
[01:45:43.423 --> 01:45:44.103]  This is the plan.
[01:45:44.143 --> 01:45:44.884]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:45:45.964 --> 01:45:47.565]  Let's talk to Derek in Ohio.
[01:45:47.625 --> 01:45:48.386]  Derek, you're on the air.
[01:45:49.682 --> 01:45:49.902]  Yes.
[01:45:50.202 --> 01:45:50.543]  Hola.
[01:45:50.683 --> 01:45:51.503]  Muchas gracias.
[01:45:52.084 --> 01:45:52.304]  Hello.
[01:45:52.344 --> 01:45:52.964]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:53.605 --> 01:46:06.354]  Yeah, I wanted to share that my wife and I have experience living and traveling down in South America, Latin America, specifically in Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and a little bit of time in Peru.
[01:46:07.134 --> 01:46:12.118]  And we're volunteering on organic farms and staying with friends and local people.
[01:46:12.838 --> 01:46:14.880]  And my comment also has to tie in
[01:46:15.598 --> 01:46:21.520]  With the topic of the exit plan, leaving the country, that you were talking about on Tuesday.
[01:46:22.341 --> 01:46:30.463]  And what we found was that by running from our fears, they always have a way of finding you.
[01:46:31.964 --> 01:46:34.645]  And we found a lot of good experiences down there.
[01:46:34.925 --> 01:46:36.746]  We learned a lot.
[01:46:37.746 --> 01:46:39.367]  But ultimately, what we were running from
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.303]  It's already, there's a lot of it already in place down there.
[01:46:43.343 --> 01:46:43.923]  Oh no, exactly.
[01:46:43.943 --> 01:46:45.364]  That's what I always try to explain to people.
[01:46:45.825 --> 01:46:47.667]  The whole world is under this corrupt system.
[01:46:49.508 --> 01:46:57.075]  Um, yeah, from, from, I mean, brought, you know, you travel on the, I mean, we've traveled coast to coast from Peru to Buenos Aires back.
[01:46:57.095 --> 01:47:02.721]  We've traveled across Paraguay through the Gran Chaco into Bolivia and back across
[01:47:03.422 --> 01:47:09.105]  Seeing just the corruption, bribery, the way of life with police.
[01:47:10.706 --> 01:47:12.067]  It's normal down there.
[01:47:12.507 --> 01:47:15.129]  The police and the military, they look the same.
[01:47:16.670 --> 01:47:20.972]  But they didn't have the attitude, the aggressiveness, I guess, we're seeing here.
[01:47:22.213 --> 01:47:28.056]  But it was very common to see military police through the cities with rifles outside of banks.
[01:47:28.757 --> 01:47:30.658]  Everything was peaceful.
[01:47:31.518 --> 01:47:33.680]  But all the people were used to it down there.
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:34.781]  Well, that's it.
[01:47:34.841 --> 01:47:38.545]  I mean, for people that don't know, America looks like a third world country now in every way.
[01:47:38.565 --> 01:47:40.707]  The militarized police, all of it.
[01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:42.588]  This is what it is to be slaves.
[01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:44.870]  You have Monsanto.
[01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:49.034]  Our friends in Argentina who, a small family, they're describing the same things.
[01:47:49.074 --> 01:47:55.820]  They have their own little dairy farm just for them and just selling to their friends in the town there, outside Buenos Aires.
[01:47:57.285 --> 01:48:16.322]  They described to us about how many farmers and people out in the country, the Campesinos, were getting kicked off their land and these giant monopolistic agro-business of soy, genetically modified soy, that, you know, of course, is shipped up to Europe and the United States and Canada.
[01:48:16.342 --> 01:48:17.003]  No, no, that's it.
[01:48:17.043 --> 01:48:23.209]  These global corporations are destroying the cultures down there, and so that's why you can't blame these people trying to get up here.
[01:48:23.945 --> 01:48:28.266]  My issue is, it doesn't matter, because once they get here, they're being turned into globalists.
[01:48:29.487 --> 01:48:32.788]  And so it's a total war, and it's just horrible.
[01:48:33.228 --> 01:48:35.509]  Listen, I was down there 30 years ago.
[01:48:35.749 --> 01:48:36.549]  I was about 10 years old.
[01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:37.429]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:41.170]  And we were in Cancun, and Cancun was very small then.
[01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:47.533]  And my dad was reading the brochures in English and Spanish that said, you can buy land in Mexico.
[01:48:47.673 --> 01:48:48.573]  And he's always like, well, you...
[01:48:50.041 --> 01:48:51.802]  If you're not a Mexican citizen, you can never buy land.
[01:48:51.842 --> 01:48:52.563]  He said, this is strange.
[01:48:52.583 --> 01:48:53.684]  So he went and talked to the company.
[01:48:54.644 --> 01:49:01.309]  We drove out south of there, looked at these, you know, plots of land, oceanfront, and they said, well, this is UN land.
[01:49:02.309 --> 01:49:05.051]  And we made the, you know, the natives have been moved off of this.
[01:49:06.112 --> 01:49:07.373]  They've been there for thousands of years.
[01:49:09.114 --> 01:49:16.759]  My dad went and did research and found out a decade before under UN, they had had huge gun battles down there with the Mayans and forced them off their property all over Southern Mexico.
[01:49:18.499 --> 01:49:19.720]  My dad said, well that's immoral.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:23.983]  I'm not going to buy land down here and then you pay to have a beach house put on it.
[01:49:24.843 --> 01:49:28.285]  And now we've been down there, it's all built up and beautiful and there's all these Westerners living down there.
[01:49:29.386 --> 01:49:37.951]  But literally wealthy and middle class people moved down there not even knowing the Mexicans had already been kicked off their land decades before.
[01:49:39.312 --> 01:49:42.875]  And now they won't even let the Mexicans fish in places like
[01:49:45.276 --> 01:49:48.117]  Oh, what's that island I've been to so many times off the coast there?
[01:49:50.158 --> 01:49:51.559]  No, it's off Southern Mexico.
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:53.200]  It's off Yucatan.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.101]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[01:49:55.401 --> 01:49:55.861]  Cozumel.
[01:49:56.542 --> 01:49:57.342]  And others.
[01:49:57.842 --> 01:49:59.123]  They don't let them fish there now.
[01:50:00.183 --> 01:50:01.204]  But the big trawlers can.
[01:50:01.264 --> 01:50:02.825]  It's all Agenda 21.
[01:50:04.165 --> 01:50:07.087]  And it's just, no one has a lobby.
[01:50:07.887 --> 01:50:09.028]  The people don't have a lobby.
[01:50:09.188 --> 01:50:12.970]  It's like we paid $22 billion to move General Motors to
[01:50:15.199 --> 01:50:15.562]  China.
[01:50:15.843 --> 01:50:18.280]  I mean, it's all over the top outrageous.
[01:50:19.431 --> 01:50:21.251]  We're going to go to break, come back with more calls.
[01:50:22.112 --> 01:50:26.913]  We're going to have Jakari Jackson joining us at the bottom of the hour from New Jersey at the side of the Super Bowl.
[01:50:27.593 --> 01:50:27.893]  What is it?
[01:50:27.913 --> 01:50:28.573]  Super Bowl XLVIII.
[01:50:28.593 --> 01:50:40.797]  We're going to be there with live coverage before, during and after the giant gladiatorial diversion with Jakari Jackson and Josh Owens on scene there in the Arctic blizzard that is global warming 2014.
[01:50:41.297 --> 01:50:44.618]  Please don't forget in a couple days we're going to end the yearly special.
[01:50:45.578 --> 01:50:56.444]  Or you can get five plus months free of InfoWars Nightly News and all the films at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv and your membership helps fund the operation.
[01:50:56.484 --> 01:50:59.946]  So please vote with your dollars as we try to expose what's happening.
[01:51:00.326 --> 01:51:02.107]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:02.147 --> 01:51:03.708]  I want to thank all the current members.
[01:51:04.148 --> 01:51:05.468]  If you're not a member, become one today.
[01:51:05.509 --> 01:51:08.010]  If you are a member, share your membership with folks.
[01:51:09.807 --> 01:51:12.389]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:51:12.509 --> 01:51:16.532]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:51:16.832 --> 01:51:18.053]  SilverLungs.com.
[01:51:18.233 --> 01:51:20.694]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[01:51:20.894 --> 01:51:23.696]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:51:23.896 --> 01:51:26.038]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[01:51:26.238 --> 01:51:27.999]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:51:28.139 --> 01:51:33.483]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:51:33.723 --> 01:51:37.385]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[01:51:37.526 --> 01:51:39.007]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:51:40.587 --> 01:51:48.211]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:48.311 --> 01:51:50.632]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[01:51:50.812 --> 01:51:57.435]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[01:51:57.636 --> 01:52:02.678]  More protection, more stopping power, more mobility, and it weighs less than 5 pounds.
[01:52:02.878 --> 01:52:05.359]  Get details at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:52:05.519 --> 01:52:08.701]  That's I-N-F-I-D-E-L-BodyArmor.com.
[01:52:09.421 --> 01:52:10.262]  The facts are in.
[01:52:10.442 --> 01:52:11.584]  The studies are legion.
[01:52:11.844 --> 01:52:19.212]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:52:19.372 --> 01:52:22.836]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:52:23.196 --> 01:52:23.577]  Simple.
[01:52:23.777 --> 01:52:28.142]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:52:28.482 --> 01:52:33.925]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:52:34.185 --> 01:52:50.195]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:52:50.515 --> 01:52:54.760]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.943]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:52:57.263 --> 01:53:02.570]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:07.075]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:53:07.216 --> 01:53:09.038]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:53:11.101 --> 01:53:17.768]  What if you could shift into a parallel universe right now and be the solution to any problem you're facing?
[01:53:17.788 --> 01:53:25.596]  I'm Matthew David Hurtado, CEO of RNA Drops and author of Misfit to Millions, based on my true life story.
[01:53:26.497 --> 01:53:31.002]  Four years ago, I was dying with PTSD, Lyme's disease, and virtually homeless.
[01:53:31.783 --> 01:53:38.790]  ION and the RNA Drops gave me a new life, new DNA, and the power to become a millionaire in just a few short years.
[01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:41.453]  I want to pay that forward to you.
[01:53:41.993 --> 01:53:49.541]  Get a copy of my book, Misfit to Millions, and I'll give you a free bottle of the RNA Drops, the product that saved my life.
[01:53:49.821 --> 01:53:56.566]  I've got $199 in free bonus gifts for the first 200 people that go to Misfit2Millions.com.
[01:53:56.846 --> 01:54:00.268]  That's M-I-S-F-I-T-T-O-Millions.com.
[01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:01.309]  Or call 888-550-8231.
[01:54:01.349 --> 01:54:01.549]  That's 888-550-8231.
[01:54:01.569 --> 01:54:02.330]  Take your power back!
[01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:04.311]  I can see for miles and miles and miles and
[01:54:23.532 --> 01:54:48.642]  If you think that I don't know about the little trick you play And never see you when deliberately you push things in my way Well here's a poke at you You're gonna choke on it too You're gonna lose that smile Because all the while
[01:54:49.811 --> 01:54:57.614]  Let me describe it to you this way.
[01:54:58.634 --> 01:55:05.637]  We have a very vicious criminal political system taking over our country politically in the world.
[01:55:06.417 --> 01:55:17.261]  And they're using poor, desperate immigrants worldwide, whether it's Australia, Europe, the United States, to come in as a political army and to form the new enforcer class, police, military.
[01:55:18.345 --> 01:55:18.725]  You name it.
[01:55:19.505 --> 01:55:22.206]  And that's how the globalists are engaged in a revolution against freedom.
[01:55:22.666 --> 01:55:28.187]  The answer to this is to try to wake the immigrants that are here up, because historically, you know, they vote anti-freedom.
[01:55:29.708 --> 01:55:32.669]  And at the same time, to try to block as many of them as we can.
[01:55:33.889 --> 01:55:35.069]  And it just comes down to that.
[01:55:35.089 --> 01:55:38.290]  I mean, look, we should want skilled workers, not unskilled.
[01:55:38.850 --> 01:55:40.631]  There's none of these countries take unskilled.
[01:55:40.791 --> 01:55:42.611]  Only America, to a great extent.
[01:55:43.571 --> 01:55:44.432]  And look at Switzerland.
[01:55:44.452 --> 01:55:45.852]  They only take extremely skilled,
[01:55:47.463 --> 01:55:48.948]  And look at how well Switzerland's doing.
[01:55:50.506 --> 01:55:53.889]  I mean, people aren't going to want to come here because we're becoming a third-world country.
[01:55:54.429 --> 01:55:56.831]  We're really pooping in the pool here, folks.
[01:55:57.552 --> 01:55:58.592]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[01:55:59.453 --> 01:56:01.354]  And it's a bottom-line fact.
[01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:03.136]  Now, I want to go back to your calls.
[01:56:03.156 --> 01:56:04.337]  We're going to continue into the next hour.
[01:56:04.377 --> 01:56:07.519]  Jakari Jackson is going to be joining us from New Jersey.
[01:56:07.559 --> 01:56:14.865]  They're at the site of the 48th gladiatorial castration event where men don't go out and be real men in their lives.
[01:56:15.185 --> 01:56:19.389]  They watch simulated combat and worship the men they watch on TV.
[01:56:20.762 --> 01:56:22.163]  We're going to be discussing that.
[01:56:22.183 --> 01:56:28.328]  We're going to go to Mike and Kevin and Lorraine and Carmen and Morgan and others here in a moment.
[01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:31.371]  Briefly, I was plugging PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:32.012 --> 01:56:36.175]  I cannot explain to you how important it is to support real media.
[01:56:36.575 --> 01:56:38.057]  The dinosaur media is dying.
[01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:41.480]  That's why they're trying to get all their agenda through right now.
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:42.961]  We have a chance of turning this around.
[01:56:44.062 --> 01:56:45.343]  2014 legislatively is everything.
[01:56:47.404 --> 01:56:53.809]  And we're putting on just incredible TV shows every night, and the research and the live coverage at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:53.869 --> 01:56:57.492]  If you're not using your membership, or you haven't gotten a membership, now is the time.
[01:56:57.972 --> 01:57:01.975]  You can get five plus months free right now when you sign up for a year, or it's $5.95 a month.
[01:57:02.376 --> 01:57:04.137]  Eleven people can use it simultaneously.
[01:57:04.157 --> 01:57:08.801]  And the reason I'm promoting this last segment and this segment is, I never promote it, and it's such a key part.
[01:57:10.029 --> 01:57:10.289]  I don't know.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:37.986]  To get the very highest quality nutrients and vitamins and supplements, not just that we produce, but that others have produced at the very lowest prices.
[01:57:38.606 --> 01:57:45.591]  The best water filtration systems that cut off the fluoride, the glyphosates, that annihilate the competition side by side, or I'd be selling the competition.
[01:57:46.191 --> 01:57:51.614]  All this and more at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888.
[01:57:53.275 --> 01:57:53.736]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:57:53.916 --> 01:57:58.442]  That's 888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:57:58.462 --> 01:58:12.038]  And again, we're not funded by George Soros like so many of these outlets like Media Matters and the White House funds it too and the Huffington Post.
[01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:14.739]  And MSNBC.
[01:58:14.779 --> 01:58:16.140]  We're funded by you.
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.721]  And in closing, it is essential to support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:22.661]  That's still where the majority of our audience is.
[01:58:23.302 --> 01:58:25.502]  And if you're listening, spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:58:26.062 --> 01:58:29.423]  If you're listening, support our local sponsors or become a sponsor.
[01:58:29.903 --> 01:58:31.164]  Every little bit counts.
[01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:36.505]  And that's why the show is really growing, getting picked up by a lot more affiliates, and just reaching countless people.
[01:58:36.545 --> 01:58:39.926]  And you see even the establishment media having to bemoan that fact.
[01:58:40.926 --> 01:58:43.509]  And those of you that do support us, you're the ones that are paying it forward.
[01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:44.250]  I salute you.
[01:58:44.630 --> 01:58:46.172]  Third Hour, your calls.
[01:58:46.332 --> 01:58:47.073]  A ton of news.
[01:58:47.093 --> 01:58:52.258]  Stay with us.
[01:58:52.298 --> 01:58:56.262]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.426 --> 01:59:01.067]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:59:04.988 --> 01:59:09.370]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:15.492]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:59:15.632 --> 01:59:26.396]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[01:59:50.414 --> 01:59:54.537]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:54.997 --> 01:59:55.718]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:18.722]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.363 --> 02:00:20.163]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.943 --> 02:00:21.824]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.484 --> 02:00:26.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:30.789]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.714 --> 02:00:42.435]  Don't be naive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:44.329 --> 02:00:49.313]  Racial, religious, tribal politics are used by the ruling classes all over the world.
[02:00:50.715 --> 02:00:54.578]  And the Republican Party is working with the Democrats to gut this nation once and for all.
[02:00:55.985 --> 02:01:04.652]  Absolutely gut this nation and absolutely bring in immigrant populations with no history of freedom who will be clients of the establishment to complete our journey into slavery.
[02:01:05.032 --> 02:01:07.854]  Just now breaking at Infowars.com, we'll cover it after the break.
[02:01:08.355 --> 02:01:14.359]  Chief of police harassed by feds, fired after signing pledge to uphold constitution.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.241]  Unbelievable!
[02:01:16.761 --> 02:01:24.407]  Sheriff orders Shane Harger to disband entire police department due to political affiliations.
[02:01:25.848 --> 02:01:29.349]  When all these other big police chiefs in these big cities are total Democrats.
[02:01:29.369 --> 02:01:31.770]  You know, and go speak at Obama events and stuff.
[02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:32.531]  This is incredible.
[02:01:32.551 --> 02:01:45.256]  And you can't have a mention of the Constitution at the Olympics either, or a pro-gun at the Super Bowl, or a Christian song nominated for the Oscars has been banned.
[02:01:48.798 --> 02:01:49.578]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:52.734 --> 02:01:53.434]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:53.974 --> 02:01:55.034]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:01:55.094 --> 02:01:56.595]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[02:01:56.635 --> 02:01:56.975]  Welcome.
[02:01:58.575 --> 02:02:00.075]  Alex, brother, thanks for having me.
[02:02:00.115 --> 02:02:00.656]  How you doing?
[02:02:01.576 --> 02:02:02.196]  I'm doing all right.
[02:02:02.236 --> 02:02:03.396]  What's on your mind today, my friend?
[02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:13.758]  Oh, brother, you know, I'm looking... I reread some of the cable leaks covering the NAU, and tell you what, folks need to wake up.
[02:02:14.378 --> 02:02:17.619]  As you know, Hispanics are set to surpass us in March.
[02:02:17.699 --> 02:02:18.699]  Everybody knows that.
[02:02:19.545 --> 02:02:27.987]  And I look at just the collaboration on both sides of the aisle of Republicans, Democrats, and just wanting to gut this country.
[02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:31.748]  And the last thing on my mind, sir, is I'm a gun enthusiast.
[02:02:31.988 --> 02:02:37.649]  Smith and Wesson and Ruger had been driven out of California due to the micro-stamping mandate.
[02:02:37.929 --> 02:02:44.951]  I wanted to get your thoughts on that because there's no proof, first off, that micro-stamping cuts down on crime.
[02:02:45.518 --> 02:02:51.739]  And secondly, I see it as really a backdoor mechanism to drive out gun sales in California further.
[02:02:51.839 --> 02:02:53.419]  So, if I could get your thoughts on that.
[02:02:53.519 --> 02:02:55.440]  Lastly, I do want to plug that coffee.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.280]  It's wonderful, and please keep up the fight, brother.
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:02:59.200]  God bless you.
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:02:59.981]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:00.041 --> 02:03:01.061]  Yeah, no, we covered that.
[02:03:01.081 --> 02:03:07.382]  That was like in Reuters two days ago, that Smith & Wesson, Ruger, they're leaving California.
[02:03:07.402 --> 02:03:13.403]  They're not going to sell there because they want to make you micro-stamp with the hammer, the firing pin.
[02:03:15.731 --> 02:03:19.674]  So like, then tell what gun, you know, it came from, as if thieves won't just file that off.
[02:03:20.015 --> 02:03:23.618]  And then they can make guns that don't have it illegal, and taxes on the ammunition.
[02:03:23.658 --> 02:03:28.001]  They want to ban guns, except for themselves, who all have armed bodyguards, the politicians.
[02:03:28.842 --> 02:03:30.403]  Of course criminals want to take our guns.
[02:03:30.423 --> 02:03:31.664]  We've got to just call it like it is.
[02:03:32.165 --> 02:03:37.449]  Americans have been so reasonable, so nice, that we will put up with anything that nobody else does.
[02:03:38.730 --> 02:03:40.692]  And we are a laughingstock across the world.
[02:03:41.971 --> 02:03:47.214]  There's the headline, Smith & Wesson to end most California sales due to micro-stamping resolution.
[02:03:48.315 --> 02:03:48.875]  Regulation.
[02:03:50.396 --> 02:03:54.779]  And now they're trying, they shut down the last lead smelter in the country.
[02:03:55.703 --> 02:04:00.185]  You can hardly mine gold or silver here, because there's so many regulations.
[02:04:00.625 --> 02:04:04.327]  And some regulations were reasonable, but now it's meant to shut things down.
[02:04:04.347 --> 02:04:08.389]  I mean, they're telling coal-powered plants, you can't have water vapor and carbon dioxide come out.
[02:04:08.429 --> 02:04:10.129]  They've listed carbon dioxide as toxic waste.
[02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:13.311]  Meanwhile, in China, there's nothing in the smokestack.
[02:04:13.331 --> 02:04:14.411]  Just everything comes out.
[02:04:14.972 --> 02:04:16.592]  It blows around the atmosphere to us.
[02:04:17.172 --> 02:04:18.613]  They can build three new plants a week.
[02:04:18.713 --> 02:04:20.374]  We're shutting down more than three plants a week.
[02:04:21.769 --> 02:04:23.330]  This is the shutdown of society.
[02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:34.634]  And it's just total economic tyranny where the politicians are run by foreign interests who can instantly double and triple their profits by shutting us down because they own the competition sectors.
[02:04:35.315 --> 02:04:36.355]  It's really elementary.
[02:04:37.115 --> 02:04:41.097]  Just like they can go in and say nobody in this whole area can farm on your land anymore.
[02:04:41.717 --> 02:04:42.258]  In Mexico.
[02:04:44.018 --> 02:04:45.359]  Now where's the deed to your property?
[02:04:45.399 --> 02:04:47.280]  Well, I've been here for 50 generations.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:47.720]  We don't know.
[02:04:48.849 --> 02:04:51.692]  Alright, well the army's coming in next week to burn down your house and kill you.
[02:04:52.433 --> 02:04:55.357]  Or you can take this 2,000 pesos or whatever to leave now.
[02:04:56.718 --> 02:04:59.021]  And go to, you know, for a bus ride to Mexico City.
[02:05:00.463 --> 02:05:02.405]  And then I've seen the footage, you'll never see it on our news.
[02:05:03.646 --> 02:05:05.849]  Where the armored vehicles run in to shoot everybody.
[02:05:06.349 --> 02:05:08.212]  If you don't hear La Raza talking about that.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:12.022]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:05:12.282 --> 02:05:17.146]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:05:17.406 --> 02:05:25.272]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:05:25.533 --> 02:05:29.836]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:05:30.056 --> 02:05:33.859]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:05:34.019 --> 02:05:39.721]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:05:39.961 --> 02:05:42.743]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:05:43.123 --> 02:05:48.365]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:05:48.505 --> 02:05:56.628]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:05:56.688 --> 02:05:56.868]  That's 866-229-0927.

[02:06:05.834 --> 02:06:08.577]  Buypatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[02:06:09.438 --> 02:06:12.161]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:06:12.461 --> 02:06:17.287]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:17.467 --> 02:06:24.635]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:06:24.775 --> 02:06:30.182]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:06:30.402 --> 02:06:34.146]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[02:06:39.172 --> 02:06:43.097]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power
[02:06:43.097 --> 02:06:44.377]  More outages are out in the field.
[02:06:44.618 --> 02:06:47.699]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:06:47.859 --> 02:06:50.100]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:54.941]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:06:55.121 --> 02:06:57.562]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:06:58.002 --> 02:07:05.005]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[02:07:05.205 --> 02:07:06.886]  We're getting prepared, are you?
[02:07:07.126 --> 02:07:18.232]  InfoWarsShop.com Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:07:18.312 --> 02:07:26.416]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:26.696 --> 02:07:31.401]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:07:31.581 --> 02:07:38.307]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:38.367 --> 02:07:45.454]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:45.554 --> 02:07:52.420]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:56.922]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:07:57.042 --> 02:08:00.304]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:08:00.444 --> 02:08:06.568]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[02:08:47.377 --> 02:08:48.658]  I love this song.
[02:08:48.698 --> 02:08:52.182]  I love that sweet voice.
[02:09:06.604 --> 02:09:13.317]  This music's in my ears.
[02:09:13.838 --> 02:09:14.720]  Alright, I'll stop singing.
[02:09:17.881 --> 02:09:19.741]  We're un-American, man.
[02:09:20.802 --> 02:09:22.062]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:09:22.302 --> 02:09:23.242]  to 2 p.m.
[02:09:23.282 --> 02:09:24.342]  Central, we are here.
[02:09:25.443 --> 02:09:27.983]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:09:28.363 --> 02:09:29.703]  I know I got a lot of people holding.
[02:09:29.783 --> 02:09:30.584]  I want to go to you.
[02:09:30.944 --> 02:09:36.425]  Jakari Jackson is going to be joining us from outside the Super Bowl there in New Jersey.
[02:09:36.445 --> 02:09:41.406]  We're going to have coverage of that today, tomorrow, and Sunday, right before it all kicks off.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:45.782]  And then after, we're going to have Jakari from Times Square tonight.
[02:09:45.802 --> 02:09:47.842]  He's going to go up to New York, talk to folks.
[02:09:48.023 --> 02:09:51.464]  He'll be live on the Nightly News with Darren McBrain.
[02:09:52.004 --> 02:09:55.226]  So all that and more is coming up.
[02:09:56.854 --> 02:10:02.701]  Or I guess McBrain's going to do the interview with him via Skype, and then that'll be on the news, with David Knight is actually anchoring the news.
[02:10:03.341 --> 02:10:05.143]  So all that and more coming up.
[02:10:05.484 --> 02:10:13.533]  Let me just run over some of the news that I haven't gotten to yet here as quickly.
[02:10:14.943 --> 02:10:15.964]  Quickly as we can.
[02:10:16.284 --> 02:10:18.525]  Let's just hit this first, because I mentioned it but haven't played it yet.
[02:10:19.326 --> 02:10:22.348]  This is Wasserman Schultz, who's always saying tyrannical things.
[02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:27.031]  Democrat from Florida, says the President is going to have to use his executive authority.
[02:10:27.672 --> 02:10:29.493]  So more dictatorship talk, here it is.
[02:10:30.474 --> 02:10:35.237]  There are urgent challenges that we have facing, and the President is going to use his executive authority.
[02:10:35.597 --> 02:10:43.343]  And I agree that he should use his executive authority, because if the Republicans continue to try to be obstructionists, then we've got to make progress.
[02:10:44.292 --> 02:10:59.177]  I'm sorry, that's a... My buddy Scotty one time, when he was in high school, rode his bike across the football field during halftime, and you'll never forget somebody standing up in East Texas, where you don't call it MacDonald's, you call it... MacDonald!
[02:10:59.577 --> 02:11:00.217]  MacDonald!
[02:11:01.052 --> 02:11:03.154]  And they said, lay that idiot down there!
[02:11:03.174 --> 02:11:07.157]  They actually said something else, but that's one of our favorite sayings around here.
[02:11:07.958 --> 02:11:11.641]  But, I mean, that woman looks like an absolute moron.
[02:11:12.121 --> 02:11:24.991]  You know, you've got to remember that most of these Democrats are just gutter sludge, and that, you know, they're like, we've got to ban clips, because you throw the clip or the magazine away every time you shoot it, and that'll ban the clips soon.
[02:11:25.592 --> 02:11:27.613]  There'll be no more clips left, duh!
[02:11:27.633 --> 02:11:28.574]  And, you know, Guam,
[02:11:31.067 --> 02:11:33.329]  Might flip if we put more bases on it.
[02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:34.971]  It might capsize!
[02:11:38.754 --> 02:11:43.919]  I mean, that's who the globalists want in power, is absolute sniveling morons.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:52.306]  And, you know, I'm sorry, but when you look in somebody's eyes, you can tell that Wasserman Schultz probably has about a 75 IQ.
[02:11:53.187 --> 02:11:54.888]  But she still has the cunning
[02:11:55.819 --> 02:11:57.620]  A cunning of a highwayman.
[02:11:58.281 --> 02:12:00.362]  So, look out, boys and girls.
[02:12:00.823 --> 02:12:02.684]  Wasserman Schultz is coming to get you.
[02:12:03.404 --> 02:12:04.405]  Here's some other news here.
[02:12:05.326 --> 02:12:09.209]  At a market watch, gold settles higher, volatile after Fed decision.
[02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:12.271]  Emerging market fears boost gold's investment appeal.
[02:12:14.045 --> 02:12:22.808]  And again, the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve has announced they're going to be trimming monthly $10 billion of the unlimited trillions they've been giving themselves.
[02:12:23.848 --> 02:12:26.549]  Markets and emerging currencies recover after U.S.
[02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:37.613]  growth data, growth is down, and the announcement again to trim the program by $10 billion to $65 billion per month that they give to select groups.
[02:12:39.234 --> 02:12:41.815]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[02:12:43.163 --> 02:12:55.331]  Clapper, the guy that committed felony perjury before Congress, saying the NSA doesn't spy on Americans, calls for Snowden and accomplices to return NSA documents.
[02:12:55.351 --> 02:12:56.612]  That's a funny one.
[02:12:57.033 --> 02:13:02.937]  That is a really, really, really, really funny little joke out of Hare Clapper.
[02:13:03.877 --> 02:13:11.883]  And then continuing here, vulnerable Democrats distance themselves from Obama after State of the Union speech
[02:13:13.001 --> 02:13:16.884]  Well, I mean, why are they distancing themselves?
[02:13:17.644 --> 02:13:19.025]  I guess this is out of Time Magazine.
[02:13:19.525 --> 02:13:20.426]  I mean, everything's great.
[02:13:20.486 --> 02:13:24.048]  I mean, isn't open borders popular, even though it's not?
[02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:26.530]  I mean, isn't Obamacare popular, even though it isn't?
[02:13:26.570 --> 02:13:28.171]  Isn't banning guns popular, even though it isn't?
[02:13:28.531 --> 02:13:39.299]  I mean, they're a paper tiger, but the Republican leadership is bought and paid for by the same traitorous, larcenous interest, and that's why they're doing it.
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:42.501]  Unbelievable.
[02:13:43.516 --> 02:13:45.758]  That this is all unfolding and happening.
[02:13:46.138 --> 02:13:56.246]  What we need to see is more of what Congressman Randy Weber said, saying Obama is the Commandant-in-Chief of prison America and is a lying socialist dictator.
[02:13:56.666 --> 02:13:57.006]  Yes!
[02:13:57.547 --> 02:13:57.887]  Yes!
[02:13:58.467 --> 02:13:58.808]  Yes!
[02:13:59.568 --> 02:14:00.729]  I like Randy Weber.
[02:14:00.769 --> 02:14:01.910]  Please try to get him on.
[02:14:01.930 --> 02:14:04.192]  His constituents, call him.
[02:14:04.212 --> 02:14:05.533]  Tell him to get on the show right now.
[02:14:06.997 --> 02:14:07.697]  Unbelievable.
[02:14:08.038 --> 02:14:08.478]  Here's another one.
[02:14:08.498 --> 02:14:15.922]  Republicans skeptical of Obama enacting agenda alone, but saying the Reichstag is skeptical of the new Fuhrer acting alone.
[02:14:18.243 --> 02:14:23.405]  Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder cannot explain constitutional basis for Obama's executive orders.
[02:14:23.425 --> 02:14:26.247]  Attorney General Holder couldn't explain the basis of it.
[02:14:28.581 --> 02:14:37.526]  He said, I'll be honest to you on television, I have not seen, I don't remember looking at or having seen the analysis in some time, so I'm not sure where along the spectrum that would come from.
[02:14:37.806 --> 02:14:44.809]  Perfect, just, I know nothing, I know nothing, I know nothing, nothing.
[02:14:45.630 --> 02:14:47.811]  Now they won't even debate it, they'll just say, I don't know.
[02:14:49.770 --> 02:15:01.999]  Well, it's an imperial presidency, and I mean, all Ted Cruz does is tell it like it is, and the media acts like it's a, oh my gosh, he said amnesty push will ruin hopes of retaking the Senate for Republicans.
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:04.160]  How dare you say that?
[02:15:04.761 --> 02:15:05.882]  Well, of course it will.
[02:15:06.262 --> 02:15:08.043]  They're giving him driver's licenses everywhere.
[02:15:09.304 --> 02:15:11.466]  I'll never forget an AP article like seven years ago.
[02:15:12.435 --> 02:15:17.419]  The headline was something like, bank heads make it easier for immigrants to get houses.
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:23.985]  And they said, well, we know you don't really have IDs, so we're going to give you mortgages and stuff without any proof.
[02:15:24.986 --> 02:15:30.570]  Meanwhile, folks, I've got near perfect credit, and to get a house, I have to almost get a proctology exam.
[02:15:32.172 --> 02:15:36.616]  That's what, you know, my dad had a little company, a little holding company.
[02:15:37.916 --> 02:15:45.920]  He gave me, 18 years ago, when I started up, 17 years ago, when I started my online shopping cart, when I had my first film, America's Won by Design, to try to fund my operation.
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:50.522]  He helped me set up the computer and set up the online deal and helped me out.
[02:15:51.402 --> 02:15:52.903]  He said, here, you can have this bank account.
[02:15:52.923 --> 02:15:54.143]  It's got like a thousand dollars in it.
[02:15:54.163 --> 02:15:54.984]  I haven't used it in years.
[02:15:55.004 --> 02:15:56.644]  It's a Bank of America bank account.
[02:15:58.245 --> 02:16:00.326]  And so, I went and put money in that, started using that.
[02:16:01.207 --> 02:16:04.288]  And, you know, since I've gotten rid of it, obviously,
[02:16:06.877 --> 02:16:12.902]  But I went in there to do something with it years ago.
[02:16:12.922 --> 02:16:15.044]  I think it was deposit or open another account or something.
[02:16:15.585 --> 02:16:16.806]  And I had like three forms of ID.
[02:16:16.826 --> 02:16:17.346]  It wasn't enough.
[02:16:17.366 --> 02:16:18.467]  I had to get interrogated.
[02:16:18.507 --> 02:16:20.129]  It was all... I was watching illegals.
[02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:21.790]  I mean, I know an illegal.
[02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:23.652]  Cowboy hat, dirty cowboy boots.
[02:16:23.852 --> 02:16:26.154]  Looks like a East Texan, but they're Mexican.
[02:16:26.294 --> 02:16:27.015]  Looks like a West Texan.
[02:16:27.035 --> 02:16:27.716]  Looks like a Texan.
[02:16:28.156 --> 02:16:30.338]  They're sitting there and they're sitting there cashing a check.
[02:16:30.478 --> 02:16:30.838]  No ID.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.941]  And I'm like, excuse me, he didn't show an ID.
[02:16:33.961 --> 02:16:37.082]  And they went, sir, we have policies.
[02:16:37.662 --> 02:16:42.905]  Look, being a citizen and playing by the rules means you're a schmuck in this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:44.985 --> 02:16:46.526]  You got insurance, you're going to wait an hour.
[02:16:46.966 --> 02:16:48.287]  You're an illegal, you go to the front of the line.
[02:16:48.547 --> 02:16:50.968]  Because they've been told, bring them in, bring them in, bring them in.
[02:16:50.988 --> 02:16:52.649]  We're going to be reimbursed by the government.
[02:16:53.309 --> 02:16:56.050]  But with an insurance, now you're going to pay a lot more when you got insurance.
[02:16:56.390 --> 02:16:57.471]  They're going to rape you.
[02:16:59.111 --> 02:17:00.372]  Absolutely rape you.
[02:17:01.818 --> 02:17:05.340]  Continuing here with the ongoing news blitz.
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:09.082]  Representative Paul Ryan looking at legalizing.
[02:17:09.102 --> 02:17:12.884]  That's why he's been the darling of the Republicans and trying to take over the Tea Party.
[02:17:13.184 --> 02:17:13.965]  He tried to take it over.
[02:17:14.005 --> 02:17:14.485]  He failed.
[02:17:16.086 --> 02:17:18.707]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[02:17:18.827 --> 02:17:19.067]  U.S.
[02:17:19.127 --> 02:17:21.929]  official North Korea nuclear reactor restarted.
[02:17:23.883 --> 02:17:25.625]  Iran can now build and deliver nukes.
[02:17:25.785 --> 02:17:25.965]  U.S.
[02:17:26.045 --> 02:17:29.328]  Intel reports, Times of Israel, they had nukes six years ago.
[02:17:29.788 --> 02:17:30.769]  I just want to tell you that.
[02:17:31.369 --> 02:17:32.430]  And so did Saudi Arabia.
[02:17:32.470 --> 02:17:33.531]  You notice that's now coming out.
[02:17:34.232 --> 02:17:36.874]  Experts, China boosts space warfare capabilities.
[02:17:37.614 --> 02:17:40.116]  But don't worry, the NSA is spying on the Tea Party.
[02:17:40.136 --> 02:17:40.817]  They'll keep us safe.
[02:17:41.618 --> 02:17:47.062]  Holder, new media guidelines in weeks, claims they're going to talk about their new guidelines for harassing media.
[02:17:47.122 --> 02:17:47.863]  That's in Politico.
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:58.185]  And again, remember MSNBC ridiculing Mitt Romney's family adopting a black baby and saying, you know, it doesn't belong there and all that because they're total race pimps?
[02:17:59.105 --> 02:18:06.790]  Well, now they've had to apologize for controversial tweet about conservatives and Cheerios, saying conservatives will be mad about a Cheerios ad showing a multiracial family.
[02:18:07.899 --> 02:18:10.720]  I mean, no, it's the Ku Klux Klan Democratic Party that was.
[02:18:11.361 --> 02:18:17.423]  So you learn to pose as liberals so you can abort all the blacks and Mexicans while giving them Gardasil shots.
[02:18:18.164 --> 02:18:20.325]  And the blacks and Mexicans on average love you, so it's working.
[02:18:20.965 --> 02:18:21.845]  Fine, fine.
[02:18:22.125 --> 02:18:22.506]  Kill them.
[02:18:23.346 --> 02:18:24.206]  I mean, I don't want to kill them.
[02:18:24.266 --> 02:18:26.527]  I don't want that on my soul.
[02:18:26.767 --> 02:18:31.569]  I want them to be free and own guns and own factories and build and go to space, but that's not going to happen.
[02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:32.430]  We're all just going to kill each other.
[02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:33.110]  I understand.
[02:18:33.130 --> 02:18:34.571]  I understand how it works.
[02:18:34.591 --> 02:18:35.771]  I understand I'm bad.
[02:18:36.452 --> 02:18:36.732]  I get it.
[02:18:37.574 --> 02:18:37.854]  I know.
[02:18:37.874 --> 02:18:39.014]  I understand.
[02:18:39.054 --> 02:18:39.535]  I'm informed.
[02:18:39.555 --> 02:18:40.215]  I'm a bad person.
[02:18:40.795 --> 02:18:42.735]  Let's go to some other news before I go to break and come back with your calls.
[02:18:44.036 --> 02:18:46.416]  This is at InfoWars.com by Don Salazar.
[02:18:46.737 --> 02:18:50.478]  TSA Super Bowl fans may encounter Viper teams.
[02:18:52.118 --> 02:18:55.219]  Roving armed TSA while they wave the
[02:18:56.323 --> 02:19:00.807]  Known Al Qaeda groups and Muslim Brotherhood, certified terror groups through the TSA.
[02:19:01.488 --> 02:19:06.372]  Don't worry though, you may get fingers literally in your body.
[02:19:07.153 --> 02:19:11.797]  Roving teams that will come up with guns and grope you and your wife and search everything.
[02:19:12.718 --> 02:19:13.358]  Isn't that just great?
[02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:15.319]  You can read all the details right here.
[02:19:15.759 --> 02:19:18.160]  And they're also warning of political activism.
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:33.245]  They don't want anybody grabbing the, you know, the spotlight away from an event, even if you're outside of it, you know, while they're teaching you that Gardasil shots are good, and that GMO is good, and that families are bad, and Obama's good, and taking your guns is good, and then being groped is good.
[02:19:33.265 --> 02:19:38.807]  I mean, you're not going to get in the way of America's pastime being slaves and paying thousands of dollars for the cheapest tickets.
[02:19:41.010 --> 02:19:45.354]  And yes, I did buy tickets for some of the crew, so we can cover it properly.
[02:19:45.934 --> 02:19:47.616]  But I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[02:19:47.636 --> 02:19:49.177]  Like, $1,500 or something apiece.
[02:19:49.577 --> 02:19:50.919]  This country's completely gone.
[02:19:51.659 --> 02:19:53.541]  The guy runs to his burning house for his Xbox.
[02:19:53.561 --> 02:19:55.262]  People won't run to their house for their burning kids.
[02:19:55.643 --> 02:19:56.343]  That's about right.
[02:19:57.144 --> 02:19:58.265]  You wonder why we're becoming slaves?
[02:19:58.285 --> 02:19:59.186]  Because they know we're chumps.
[02:19:59.526 --> 02:20:00.187]  They know we're done.
[02:20:00.207 --> 02:20:07.773]  All right, we're going to take your calls, and I've got a bunch of even more important news straight ahead about our government funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:20:08.093 --> 02:20:08.474]  Stay with us.

[02:21:06.234 --> 02:21:07.374]  Which side are you on?
[02:21:09.226 --> 02:21:19.533]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:21:19.833 --> 02:21:21.674]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:21:21.874 --> 02:21:22.555]  Fluoride!
[02:21:22.755 --> 02:21:24.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:21:24.656 --> 02:21:30.961]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:21:31.221 --> 02:21:35.984]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:21:36.104 --> 02:21:39.206]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:21:39.486 --> 02:21:40.327]  We're good to go.

[02:24:06.782 --> 02:24:17.569]  So cars are loud.
[02:24:35.879 --> 02:24:44.847]  They just announced they're going for the death penalty of the clear CIA Patsy, they already tried to kill once, who's pled not guilty.
[02:24:45.427 --> 02:24:49.210]  Death penalty decision approaches in marathon bombing case.
[02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:55.295]  The answer whether or not officials will call for the capital punishment of the surviving puppet.
[02:24:56.436 --> 02:25:00.239]  is due out tomorrow, but the word I just saw up on Fox is they are going to go for it.
[02:25:00.579 --> 02:25:01.580]  We'll see if that's accurate.
[02:25:02.081 --> 02:25:03.121]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:25:03.562 --> 02:25:08.065]  Carmen in Pennsylvania, you want to talk about the North American Union that we're well into.
[02:25:08.105 --> 02:25:08.445]  Go ahead.
[02:25:08.465 --> 02:25:10.667]  Hi, how are you today, Alex?
[02:25:10.727 --> 02:25:11.908]  I'm alright, thanks for calling.
[02:25:12.668 --> 02:25:13.009]  Good.
[02:25:13.029 --> 02:25:18.773]  I just want to touch on some issues that you've been talking about during today, not only the North American Union.
[02:25:18.793 --> 02:25:24.217]  I am an immigrant and I am a citizen, and I just want to let you know
[02:25:24.497 --> 02:25:34.100]  Don't get discouraged, there is a lot of Hispanics and other immigrants that are trying to fight for our country, and that are trying to do the right thing, and are waking up, and we're organizing.
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:47.925]  We're trying to reach to our councilmen, we're trying to reach to our representatives, we're trying to... Oh no, listen, I know, I know, because I mean, not just American citizens that are Hispanic, but I run into immigrants, you name it, huge amount of listeners here in Austin.
[02:25:48.785 --> 02:25:53.690]  In fact, I'd say the majority of people that come up to me, they're listeners and really care what's going on, are Hispanic folks.
[02:25:54.190 --> 02:26:00.055]  The problem is the Democratic Party gets them immediately and begins the socialist indoctrination in the schools.
[02:26:00.555 --> 02:26:07.101]  So that's my only point is, the whole power structure wants unlimited immigration to the country.
[02:26:07.281 --> 02:26:08.202]  What do you think about that?
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:11.842]  I agree with what you're saying, and we're trying to intervene.
[02:26:11.902 --> 02:26:13.323]  We're trying to wake people up.
[02:26:13.363 --> 02:26:14.564]  We're trying to unionize.
[02:26:14.584 --> 02:26:15.665]  We're trying to organize.
[02:26:16.125 --> 02:26:35.998]  It is very hard, however, and it's one of the issues that I want to bring up and ask you suggestions because, for example, we're here in Pennsylvania, white Caucasians, whenever they try to see you, they're trying to have this prejudice and these preconceived ideas, and they think that you cannot be hand-in-hand with them trying to fight for our country.
[02:26:36.198 --> 02:26:37.018]  We're good to go.
[02:26:55.784 --> 02:26:59.669]  Sure, sure.
[02:26:59.749 --> 02:27:00.630]  I mean, it's very simple.
[02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:04.354]  Just because there's people that don't like immigrants because they're immigrants.
[02:27:04.374 --> 02:27:07.977]  I mean, over in England, you hear a lot of talk about all the Slavs that are moving in.
[02:27:10.244 --> 02:27:14.589]  I mean, who do you expect to come in and replace the fact that Brits don't have kids anymore?
[02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:18.334]  So, I don't dislike Hispanics, I don't dislike Slavs, anybody.
[02:27:18.934 --> 02:27:20.476]  It's what's going on in their brains.
[02:27:21.157 --> 02:27:26.203]  So, you've got to say, hey, that's a minority of white people that don't like Hispanics, and I know that for a fact.
[02:27:27.199 --> 02:27:29.140]  I don't care if you're white, hispanic, who you are.
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.661]  We can't have unlimited if they put them on welfare.
[02:27:32.941 --> 02:27:34.602]  The country is going bankrupt.
[02:27:35.102 --> 02:27:39.984]  And they are voting overwhelmingly, democratically, and we will lose our guns.
[02:27:40.104 --> 02:27:43.245]  So, regardless, there's racists on both sides.
[02:27:44.006 --> 02:27:44.906]  That's not the issue.
[02:27:44.926 --> 02:27:50.388]  The issue is the power structure that's bad wants the open borders, and we cannot have that.
[02:27:50.468 --> 02:27:51.028]  God bless you.
[02:27:51.108 --> 02:27:52.709]  Good to hear that you're listening to the broadcast.
[02:27:53.409 --> 02:27:54.190]  Let's talk to
[02:27:56.158 --> 02:28:01.581]  Kevin in Canada, then we'll go to Atemo, I think's the name, and Laureen and Morgan.
[02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:02.442]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:28:03.462 --> 02:28:06.164]  Alex, let me give you a little bit of Canadian passion.
[02:28:07.004 --> 02:28:07.965]  Ten tours.
[02:28:09.105 --> 02:28:12.227]  Ten tours and you have people there standing and clapping.
[02:28:13.227 --> 02:28:17.570]  They should have been sitting in their seats looking at each other awkwardly, speechless.
[02:28:19.179 --> 02:28:25.242]  I almost see the American society totally degenerating to the point where... That's right.
[02:28:25.262 --> 02:28:28.183]  No military in history has made a soldier fight 10 years.
[02:28:28.623 --> 02:28:30.985]  That is the most abusive evil.
[02:28:31.505 --> 02:28:34.446]  World War II, it was one, maybe two of you re-upped.
[02:28:34.926 --> 02:28:36.787]  Audie Murphy tried to re-up and they said no.
[02:28:37.448 --> 02:28:41.970]  I mean, unbelievable that they would have people serve 10 tours.
[02:28:42.010 --> 02:28:44.251]  That is so abusive.
[02:28:44.291 --> 02:28:44.591]  Go ahead.
[02:28:45.563 --> 02:28:49.285]  In the 1900s, your population was about 76 million.
[02:28:50.006 --> 02:28:53.167]  That is now your welfare class.
[02:28:53.288 --> 02:29:00.272]  Your forefathers fought for our Republic, and you folks have squandered it to a holographic democracy.
[02:29:01.793 --> 02:29:09.777]  And what really sort of struggled me these days is that I've been watching you for about 15 years, all the way back to Waco.
[02:29:11.058 --> 02:29:14.260]  And the amount of information that you've provided me with
[02:29:14.921 --> 02:29:18.163]  has literally given me like a $10,000 education at minimum.
[02:29:19.603 --> 02:29:24.846]  But the problem I have is that I'm not the only person hearing this, yet nothing's changing.
[02:29:25.326 --> 02:29:26.487]  It's literally getting worse.
[02:29:26.587 --> 02:29:27.607]  Well, that's because we're in a war.
[02:29:27.627 --> 02:29:28.908]  The enemy's pushing, we're pushing.
[02:29:28.928 --> 02:29:30.869]  Stuff is changing, it's just not fast enough.
[02:29:30.909 --> 02:29:36.932]  But briefly, how would you describe how evil it is to say it's great to have somebody serve 10 ters?
[02:29:40.614 --> 02:29:42.555]  I think the simplest way to put it, Alex, is
[02:29:44.113 --> 02:29:45.474]  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[02:29:48.215 --> 02:29:50.256]  By the way, they call it a volunteer military.
[02:29:50.276 --> 02:29:54.799]  When you sign up, they have these automatic re-ups and things, and it's actually not true.
[02:29:55.619 --> 02:29:57.761]  He probably did volunteer, but that is just crazy.
[02:29:57.941 --> 02:29:58.621]  That is crazy.
[02:29:58.921 --> 02:29:59.822]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.322 --> 02:30:01.923]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.863 --> 02:30:05.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:10.421]  The facts are in.
[02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:11.722]  The studies are legion.
[02:30:12.002 --> 02:30:19.370]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:30:19.530 --> 02:30:22.993]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:30:23.354 --> 02:30:23.754]  Simple.
[02:30:23.914 --> 02:30:28.318]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:30:28.659 --> 02:30:31.862]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[02:30:32.062 --> 02:30:34.084]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:30:34.344 --> 02:30:39.708]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield formulation.
[02:30:39.888 --> 02:30:50.416]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:30:50.677 --> 02:30:54.900]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:57.082]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[02:31:07.371 --> 02:31:09.213]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:14.057]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:14.217 --> 02:31:15.418]  Why do we have the highest
[02:31:15.418 --> 02:31:22.544]  The highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:22.864 --> 02:31:24.546]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:24.806 --> 02:31:26.127]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:26.447 --> 02:31:30.791]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:31.111 --> 02:31:35.095]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:35.335 --> 02:31:37.677]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:37.897 --> 02:31:43.802]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[02:31:44.102 --> 02:31:46.823]  To learn more, visit InfoWarsHealth.com.

[02:32:14.951 --> 02:32:19.373]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:32:19.513 --> 02:32:25.495]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:32:25.615 --> 02:32:36.379]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[02:33:31.579 --> 02:33:35.481]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:36.182 --> 02:33:39.163]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:45.046 --> 02:33:53.511]  Folks, I actually read the article Nicole Watson put out that broke while I was on the air about an hour ago during the break, and I am speechless right now.
[02:33:55.359 --> 02:34:02.243]  I had thought that some pro-constitution police chief had been fired under federal directives and thought that was bad enough.
[02:34:02.363 --> 02:34:07.406]  I had no idea the TSA was involved and that they used it as a secret police checkpoint.
[02:34:08.447 --> 02:34:15.852]  Because we know they're data mining the NSA databases now with the TSA and they're going to use it as internal checkpoints.
[02:34:15.912 --> 02:34:19.674]  But this article I'm going to cover after Ja'kari Jackson leaves us.
[02:34:25.276 --> 02:34:27.197]  It is simply, simply amazing.
[02:34:27.397 --> 02:34:28.937]  I am, I am speechless right now.
[02:34:28.957 --> 02:34:30.978]  We're going to be covering that in about 10 minutes and then your calls.
[02:34:31.758 --> 02:34:40.480]  Jakari Jackson joins us from East Rutherford in New Jersey, across from New York, the site of a super distraction, super tyranny, 48.
[02:34:43.215 --> 02:34:55.224]  And there are now investigations going on in the Congress with two Republican senators looking to try to get rid of the NFL's tax-exempt status, billions a year.
[02:34:56.045 --> 02:34:56.946]  Unbelievable!
[02:34:58.190 --> 02:35:00.231]  As the owner, some of them make hundreds of millions a year.
[02:35:00.331 --> 02:35:06.593]  I mean, look, make your money, but I'm tired of paying billions for the sports stadiums with bond proposals and then you guys are tax-exempt.
[02:35:07.193 --> 02:35:13.895]  The minute we start making rich people pay taxes, you know, the really rich people, is the minute they'll cut taxes on the middle class and the poor people.
[02:35:15.026 --> 02:35:22.552]  But then they go with class warfare, just like race warfare, and tell poor people, hey, rich people aren't paying a lot of taxes.
[02:35:22.572 --> 02:35:25.974]  And then they raise it on somebody making a quarter mil a year.
[02:35:26.314 --> 02:35:29.056]  That's the type of person that buys stuff and has employees.
[02:35:29.397 --> 02:35:30.217]  Simply amazing.
[02:35:30.998 --> 02:35:32.899]  And then the economy basically starts shutting down.
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:38.544]  So Jakari Jackson is there in New Jersey, right in front of the Dome, where they're going to be
[02:35:39.998 --> 02:35:46.921]  Having this ridiculous event there at MetLife Stadium, and he is there to cover it.
[02:35:46.941 --> 02:35:49.142]  We're going to have a lot of man on the street interviews on the show tomorrow.
[02:35:49.643 --> 02:35:53.264]  We're going to have man on the street interviews for the nightly news.
[02:35:53.544 --> 02:35:58.046]  He's going to be asking him questions like, the Viper teams are here, are you ready for a proctology exam?
[02:35:58.727 --> 02:36:05.450]  He's going to ask him kind of Mark Dyson type questions of, well should we have a proctology exam or should we wear clear plastic clothing?
[02:36:06.010 --> 02:36:12.277]  Since Mayor Bloomberg wanted folks to wear, you know, clear plastic coats, you know, just to make sure we're not bad.
[02:36:13.138 --> 02:36:14.720]  Absolute slavery going on there.
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:21.088]  So, Jakari, what are your first observations and what are some of the things you're planning in the run-up to Sunday's game?
[02:36:22.037 --> 02:36:24.378]  Well Alex, we just got here at MetLife Stadium in New York.
[02:36:24.418 --> 02:36:26.440]  You can see the stadium behind me.
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:30.842]  And Alex, when we got here, I was very surprised because we see a bit of a police presence.
[02:36:30.882 --> 02:36:33.483]  We know the TSA Viper teams are going to be out here in the area.
[02:36:33.704 --> 02:36:37.366]  We have some police over here just right off the side of me.
[02:36:37.386 --> 02:36:39.747]  We also have helicopters flying overhead.
[02:36:40.747 --> 02:36:43.209]  And Alex, we're going to be out here not to cover the Super Bowl.
[02:36:43.229 --> 02:36:44.890]  It doesn't matter if the Broncos win.
[02:36:46.793 --> 02:36:49.736]  Or if it's the Seahawks, it's the things that you lose.
[02:36:49.756 --> 02:36:52.198]  You're going to be losing your Fourth Amendment if you come out to these games.
[02:36:52.258 --> 02:36:53.759]  You're going to be patted down, you're going to be searched.
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:57.423]  Like you said, they want you to wear clear plastic clothing out here in the state.
[02:36:57.643 --> 02:37:01.807]  Also, you can only bring a clear plastic bag, a little Ziploc baggie, for your personal effect.
[02:37:01.827 --> 02:37:08.432]  So what I'm saying, Jakari, is we should, like, seriously go, shouldn't we wear clear plastic clothing then?
[02:37:08.753 --> 02:37:12.596]  And, you know, have a cavity search, like they now do at the TSA.
[02:37:12.616 --> 02:37:13.417]  When they say yes,
[02:37:13.697 --> 02:37:14.898]  They would love to do that, Alex.
[02:37:14.938 --> 02:37:18.979]  I'm sure they absolutely would love to do that, all in the name of keeping you safe.
[02:37:19.319 --> 02:37:26.883]  Although the TSA has yet to catch a single terrorist, they will do these things in the guise of keeping you safe, even though they can't even do that.
[02:37:27.223 --> 02:37:36.367]  Meanwhile, Mayor Bloomberg, Cuomo, all these other guys, they have their bodyguards, they have their various people with concealed carry, but they don't want you, disarmed slaves, to have that same opportunity.
[02:37:36.707 --> 02:37:41.292]  But Alex, we're going to be out here, we're going to be covering the TSA aspects, the violation of your Fourth Amendment.
[02:37:41.573 --> 02:37:45.818]  We're going to see, you know, if these people know about the real topics in the world or if they only care about football.
[02:37:45.838 --> 02:37:49.262]  We're going to talk about human trafficking and other things that surround these events.
[02:37:50.458 --> 02:37:51.038]  That's right.
[02:37:51.399 --> 02:37:55.941]  Absolutely decadent Sodom and Gomorrah type situation with thousands of underage prostitutes.
[02:37:56.701 --> 02:37:57.482]  You name it.
[02:37:57.522 --> 02:38:00.163]  Just a lot of degradation going on.
[02:38:00.223 --> 02:38:08.227]  But also, the way they've made it political, where they can be tax exempt, but then they try to take tax exemption away from pro-life groups.
[02:38:08.267 --> 02:38:13.150]  So, a pro-life group can't be tax exempt, but the billionaire NFL owners can be.
[02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:14.271]  That's right, Alex.
[02:38:14.311 --> 02:38:18.095]  And you know these organizations, they pride themselves on being charity workers.
[02:38:18.335 --> 02:38:19.156]  And you'll see the commercials.
[02:38:19.176 --> 02:38:22.059]  They go out and coach a local football team.
[02:38:22.119 --> 02:38:29.046]  But what they give to local charities is peanuts compared to what they rake in is really a fraction of a fraction when you get down to it.
[02:38:29.775 --> 02:38:35.298]  Well, and again, they don't let the average company do this, or everybody could be a charity and only give 1% like the NFL.
[02:38:35.698 --> 02:38:40.061]  Or Bill Clinton spending half the millions he gets from the Haitian fund on his private jets.
[02:38:40.121 --> 02:38:41.322]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:38:41.362 --> 02:38:47.645]  Bottom line, don't give to big charities unless it's groups that have proven they're good, like the Salvation Army.
[02:38:47.705 --> 02:38:50.707]  Give to local charities, or actually give yourself.
[02:38:50.747 --> 02:38:53.389]  But notice, they don't want local charities feeding the homeless.
[02:38:53.609 --> 02:38:56.430]  They don't want little girls baking cupcakes or having lemonade stands.
[02:38:56.731 --> 02:38:58.792]  They only want big corporate events.
[02:38:59.690 --> 02:39:02.131]  That's exactly right, because you see the same behind me.
[02:39:02.171 --> 02:39:06.992]  I don't know if you can see from here, but you got the big Pepsi logos, and you got Kevin Bacon on the loudspeaker over here.
[02:39:07.292 --> 02:39:18.636]  It's definitely a big corporate event, but like you said, if you want to have a lemonade stand, if you want to feed the homeless, you know, heaven forbid you actually feed a homeless person and bring some good work and good cheer to the world.
[02:39:18.856 --> 02:39:19.856]  You can't do that, Alex.
[02:39:20.736 --> 02:39:23.297]  Now, let's war game this out a little bit politically.
[02:39:24.452 --> 02:39:32.419]  I want you to go and find a crowd of morons that are attending this and, again, say, hey, they only want you to have clear bags.
[02:39:32.459 --> 02:39:33.600]  What about clear clothes?
[02:39:34.521 --> 02:39:36.983]  And then when they joke about that and agree with it, say, yeah.
[02:39:37.904 --> 02:39:41.647]  And then say, but, you know, the government people aren't going to be wearing clear clothes.
[02:39:41.727 --> 02:39:42.228]  Oh, but I guess...
[02:39:42.788 --> 02:39:44.029]  They're better than us.
[02:39:44.069 --> 02:39:47.371]  They're not servants, they're our owners, so they don't follow the same thing.
[02:39:47.391 --> 02:39:54.414]  Did you know that the TSA lets the Al-Qaeda-connected terrorist-listed Muslim Brotherhood in without being groped?
[02:39:54.715 --> 02:39:55.975]  Did you know it's about a takeover?
[02:39:56.316 --> 02:39:59.637]  You're talking about the Muslim Brotherhood coming through the TSA checkpoints.
[02:39:59.657 --> 02:40:03.680]  When we arrived here just a few minutes ago, we asked the guy, you know, where's the tailgate party?
[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:04.360]  And he looked at us so
[02:40:06.394 --> 02:40:06.975]  The Super Bowl.
[02:40:07.275 --> 02:40:08.657]  I was like, sir, you're joking.
[02:40:08.697 --> 02:40:11.020]  People can tailgate out here at the Super Bowl.
[02:40:11.561 --> 02:40:12.161]  He said, no.
[02:40:12.402 --> 02:40:13.523]  This is for your security.
[02:40:13.703 --> 02:40:15.105]  We're going to have all these big events.
[02:40:15.125 --> 02:40:20.272]  You can have the big Pepsi dome behind me or whatever else, but you can't have people to congregate to celebrate the Super Bowl.
[02:40:21.192 --> 02:40:26.435]  Well, they already... Not that we're promoting the Super Bowl, but they don't even want you to enjoy the time you have while you're here.
[02:40:26.675 --> 02:40:29.376]  Well, listen, you're supposed to only look at their big screens, like watching TV.
[02:40:29.416 --> 02:40:31.277]  You're not supposed to have a barbecue or play with the neighbors.
[02:40:31.758 --> 02:40:36.200]  People might actually think you're supposed to go outside and play card games or play horseshoes.
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:38.741]  They might think you're actually supposed to talk to other humans.
[02:40:39.182 --> 02:40:48.327]  Look at how, in Arizona a few months ago, they had the anti-terrorism squad and anti-gang squad out videotaping everyone at the college tailgating games.
[02:40:49.247 --> 02:40:50.188]  This is what it's about.
[02:40:50.628 --> 02:40:52.150]  Congregating is criminal.
[02:40:52.690 --> 02:40:58.595]  You're only allowed to go through big gates, have your genitals grubbed, and then go in and watch a bunch of steroid heads run around.
[02:40:59.115 --> 02:40:59.696]  Uh, Jakari?
[02:40:59.996 --> 02:41:01.577]  That's exactly right, and you know, who knows?
[02:41:01.597 --> 02:41:08.583]  You know, we've seen a lot of, a lot of the shady things going on in the halftime shows, not just at the Super Bowl, but at the Grammys and all these other big events.
[02:41:08.923 --> 02:41:13.447]  So tell me, Mattel, what's going to happen here come Sunday when the halftime show comes about?
[02:41:13.887 --> 02:41:17.991]  We've seen Madonna, we've seen Beyonce, other people as well, so we'll see what happens this Sunday.
[02:41:18.635 --> 02:41:21.497]  Now what does East Rutherford look like when you drove from the airport?
[02:41:21.517 --> 02:41:22.998]  I know you just arrived there minutes ago.
[02:41:23.379 --> 02:41:25.640]  Does it look bombed out like the rest of the East Coast?
[02:41:26.621 --> 02:41:32.746]  No, I was surprised to see when we came down here, I didn't see as many big buildings as I thought we would, at least on this side.
[02:41:33.766 --> 02:41:40.291]  This side of the bridge, on the other side of your big buildings that you would associate with New York, New Jersey, the iconic structures.
[02:41:40.491 --> 02:41:44.995]  But coming down here, it didn't look too bad, but granted we only drove a relative short distance from the airport.
[02:41:45.015 --> 02:41:47.236]  Hey look, there's a whole squad of morons right there.
[02:41:47.296 --> 02:41:47.897]  Go talk to them.
[02:41:48.595 --> 02:41:49.335]  Oh, okay.
[02:41:49.375 --> 02:41:50.036]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:41:50.756 --> 02:41:51.216]  Take your time.
[02:41:51.236 --> 02:41:52.497]  There'll be more groups of people.
[02:41:53.138 --> 02:41:54.378]  Okay, I'm trying to get up here.
[02:41:54.959 --> 02:41:56.459]  You're doing a great job there, Ja'far.
[02:41:59.221 --> 02:42:00.542]  And if it breaks up, it's no problem.
[02:42:00.562 --> 02:42:01.422]  This is all live.
[02:42:01.462 --> 02:42:03.003]  This is all real, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:03.944 --> 02:42:05.404]  But we're here covering the news.
[02:42:05.745 --> 02:42:14.009]  While they're getting up there to talk to some people, we'll see if they act like a total police state and run up and act like it's bizarre for Free Association to be happening.
[02:42:14.049 --> 02:42:15.130]  Let me tell you about this article.
[02:42:16.591 --> 02:42:27.777]  They're setting up the TSA as database centers where most people will be allowed through in the future without being groped and stuff, but a lot of times you'll be pulled off the side, interrogated, or even disappeared.
[02:42:28.797 --> 02:42:38.582]  Well now there's an article on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, chief of police harassed by feds, fired after signing pledge to uphold constitution.
[02:42:39.263 --> 02:42:42.144]  And that's a great headline by Watson, but it's even worse than that.
[02:42:42.804 --> 02:42:43.665]  It's even worse than that.
[02:42:46.061 --> 02:42:51.547]  They knew who he was off the data basing, totally illegal, that they admit that CSA is using.
[02:42:52.267 --> 02:43:02.537]  To know that he was going to Sheriff Mac's event in Las Vegas, that's extremely mainline about sheriffs and police following the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:43:02.978 --> 02:43:07.222]  I mean, Sheriff Mac beat Clinton at the Supreme Court on the Brady Law.
[02:43:08.443 --> 02:43:09.905]  This would make the police upstanding.
[02:43:11.135 --> 02:43:16.337]  And boy, they get upset about the police standing up and saying, we're going to follow the American law.
[02:43:16.857 --> 02:43:18.618]  They call that political and had him fired.
[02:43:19.518 --> 02:43:23.360]  A police chief was detained, and you guys pop in any time if there's something newsworthy happening.
[02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:40.186]  A police chief was detained and harassed by federal agents while traveling to a constitutional convention before returning home to be told he was fired and ordered to disband his police department after signing a pledge to uphold the Bill of Rights.
[02:43:41.974 --> 02:43:43.655]  And I wouldn't even call it a constitutional convention.
[02:43:43.695 --> 02:43:49.099]  It was a law enforcement... I guess it was technically a constitutional convention, but not in the way you'd think.
[02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:50.980]  It was a convention on the Constitution.
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:52.921]  We should flip that because it could be misunderstood.
[02:43:54.262 --> 02:44:08.312]  Police Chief Shane Harger of the Jemez Springs, New Mexico Police Department was flying out of Albuquerque Airport last week on his way to the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association convention taking place in Vegas.
[02:44:10.126 --> 02:44:14.130]  And remember we had that police chief on, or that sheriff from Liberty, Florida?
[02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:15.451]  He read the code.
[02:44:15.491 --> 02:44:20.796]  It said if the guy's law-abiding, coming from his home or business, with a gun, he's allowed to have it.
[02:44:20.836 --> 02:44:21.716]  I'm not charging him.
[02:44:22.797 --> 02:44:24.319]  I mean, I'm not going to let him go.
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:30.024]  And they went and had a state investigation and arrested him, and he won in court.
[02:44:30.064 --> 02:44:32.906]  But they're going after police that aren't evil, folks.
[02:44:33.905 --> 02:44:37.951]  And we've got to stand with people like this guy when they do the right thing.
[02:44:38.271 --> 02:44:41.996]  Don't have to say, oh, cops, you need to act like Americans and do all this.
[02:44:42.016 --> 02:44:45.221]  And then when they don't, the system goes after them and we don't back them.
[02:44:48.001 --> 02:44:53.907]  Before passing security, Harger was approached by a TSA agent who asked the police chief to show his credentials.
[02:44:54.287 --> 02:44:59.913]  Moments later, a man claiming to be a federal agent also asked to see Harger's credentials before telling him he was a person of interest.
[02:45:00.273 --> 02:45:03.816]  The federal agent then demanded to know where Harger was traveling to and why.
[02:45:04.687 --> 02:45:14.754]  When Harger told the federal agent he was attending Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association convention, they swore an oath to that by the way, in Las Vegas he was detained for 35 minutes before finally being allowed to board the plane.
[02:45:15.034 --> 02:45:16.115]  He was in a database, folks.
[02:45:16.635 --> 02:45:19.337]  Then, when he got back off, he was fired.
[02:45:20.238 --> 02:45:31.586]  On Tuesday, January 28th, the day after his return, Harger was placed on administrative leave and ordered to the San Dovetail County, New Mexico Sheriff's, Douglas C. Wood, to disband his entire police department.
[02:45:33.117 --> 02:45:34.699]  Due to his political affiliations.
[02:45:35.179 --> 02:45:37.261]  What were his political affiliations while attending the convention?
[02:45:37.822 --> 02:45:43.587]  Harger, along with 38 other police officers, signed a declaration affirming their pledge to obey and observe the U.S.
[02:45:43.627 --> 02:45:44.328]  Constitution.
[02:45:45.129 --> 02:45:46.470]  This is like the Twilight Zone, folks.
[02:45:46.810 --> 02:45:54.217]  In addition to refusing to carry out any unconstitutional orders such as gun confiscation without constitutionally pleaded warrants.
[02:45:54.418 --> 02:45:56.500]  Violation of the Fourth Amendment without probable cause.
[02:45:57.625 --> 02:46:02.388]  Detainment and incarceration of citizens is not a probable cause, or working with any military or domestic law enforcement.
[02:46:02.789 --> 02:46:04.470]  Which is all in the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[02:46:05.631 --> 02:46:06.552]  And it just goes on.
[02:46:06.592 --> 02:46:09.073]  I've never seen anything, this is secret police.
[02:46:09.674 --> 02:46:11.655]  And they, federal global agents.
[02:46:12.356 --> 02:46:13.797]  Jokari, you're out there.
[02:46:13.917 --> 02:46:16.419]  Have we located any of the minions going in to be groped?
[02:46:16.479 --> 02:46:18.200]  Or did they all run away?
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:20.201]  They ran away from us, Alex.
[02:46:20.221 --> 02:46:24.925]  We were getting closer to the state and we lost our connection, so we're back to where we had a stable connection.
[02:46:25.325 --> 02:46:36.293]  But yes, Alex, many people are wondering how aware they are about the tyranny that goes on here, if they're aware that they're going to have to sacrifice their rights, not even for security, but just to come out here and watch a football game.
[02:46:36.313 --> 02:46:40.677]  Well, this is the TSA acting as an interrogation unit.
[02:46:40.717 --> 02:46:44.420]  You go to fly, they interrogate you, and then get you fired from your job.
[02:46:45.273 --> 02:46:47.837]  Going while you're gone and intimidating and lying about you.
[02:46:48.137 --> 02:46:49.479]  This is what the Secret Service does.
[02:46:49.559 --> 02:46:55.788]  I know two people in Austin who are managers of companies who just shot their mouths off saying Obama's a traitor, not calling for violence.
[02:46:56.208 --> 02:47:00.714]  The Secret Service went to their company heads, in one case, in New York.
[02:47:01.974 --> 02:47:06.659]  Another case at a car dealership and said you better fire them if you know what's good for you.
[02:47:07.019 --> 02:47:09.041]  That's torturous interference outside the courts.
[02:47:09.441 --> 02:47:10.102]  It's siege.
[02:47:10.482 --> 02:47:13.765]  And that's how the Nazis did for five years before they started arresting people.
[02:47:14.086 --> 02:47:15.347]  They would just go get them fired.
[02:47:15.727 --> 02:47:18.550]  I mean, this is just this is like the Tea Party being harassed.
[02:47:18.650 --> 02:47:18.970]  All of it.
[02:47:19.231 --> 02:47:20.132]  These people are criminals.
[02:47:20.948 --> 02:47:22.209]  It is definitely harassment.
[02:47:22.229 --> 02:47:28.795]  You know, when I did the man on the street a few weeks ago at the airport, you know, I asked people, you know, what's the probable cause for you to be searched at the airport?
[02:47:28.835 --> 02:47:31.117]  And they said, well, just coming to the airport is probable cause.
[02:47:31.377 --> 02:47:33.840]  Well, I said, you know, what if you go to an event like the Super Bowl?
[02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:35.001]  What's the probable cause?
[02:47:35.021 --> 02:47:35.661]  Just showing up?
[02:47:35.741 --> 02:47:40.225]  Is that a reason enough for you to be molested, to be violated, to have your rights violated?
[02:47:40.305 --> 02:47:40.846]  I don't think so.
[02:47:41.414 --> 02:47:49.623]  Meanwhile, the government publicly runs the terrorist and thinks we're so stupid, the CFR called for Obama to publicly endorse Al Qaeda this week.
[02:47:50.124 --> 02:47:51.385]  I mean, I can't believe I'm even saying this.
[02:47:51.405 --> 02:47:54.308]  In fact, I've got two articles here that I haven't covered yet dealing with this.
[02:47:54.669 --> 02:47:57.352]  Here's out of Reuters, Baghdad bombs and shootings kill at least 19.
[02:47:58.413 --> 02:48:00.594]  When I saw the name of the city, I knew it was a Shiite city.
[02:48:00.994 --> 02:48:02.435]  And at the bottom, I knew what it would say.
[02:48:02.455 --> 02:48:06.897]  An Al-Qaeda affiliated Islamic State of Iraq carried out the attacks.
[02:48:07.217 --> 02:48:09.558]  The same group that just took over Fallujah again.
[02:48:09.858 --> 02:48:14.921]  The same group our government is funding in Syria and in Libya and in...
[02:48:16.341 --> 02:48:16.622]  Egypt.
[02:48:17.202 --> 02:48:24.190]  Meanwhile, here's Israel General, says Al-Qaeda, Syrian fighters set up in Turkey and threaten Europe.
[02:48:24.250 --> 02:48:24.671]  Of course.
[02:48:25.471 --> 02:48:28.014]  I mean, literally, literally.
[02:48:29.135 --> 02:48:33.961]  Our government runs Al-Qaeda and then uses the Al-Qaeda threat to take our rights, Jakari.
[02:48:35.174 --> 02:48:42.916]  You were talking to the guy yesterday about the transhumanism, and he said, he was talking to one of his colleagues, and said, why do they keep running the same schemes over and over?
[02:48:42.936 --> 02:48:45.697]  And his colleague said to him, because people keep falling for it.
[02:48:45.937 --> 02:48:53.618]  And why not, Alex, if you can run Al-Qaeda in this location, and move them to that location, and move them to that location, and people keep falling for it, why would you change your program?
[02:48:54.479 --> 02:48:58.700]  If you can catch the Hail Mary every time, why would you change your football play?
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:48:59.820]  Well, that's right.
[02:49:01.288 --> 02:49:13.492]  But then the TSA repeatedly knows I'm coming, is waiting, smiles at me, says I better not cause problems, or asks for my autograph, or some guy gets all sexually excited, I just can't handle anymore.
[02:49:13.512 --> 02:49:16.273]  I mean, it's literally a license to harass everybody.
[02:49:17.174 --> 02:49:17.354]  Exactly.
[02:49:17.534 --> 02:49:19.995]  We saw that with Alec Baldwin and his daughter.
[02:49:20.035 --> 02:49:27.357]  You know, his five-month-old baby girl was randomly selected and, you know, screened at the airport.
[02:49:27.417 --> 02:49:28.938]  And they even knew who he was and everything.
[02:49:29.842 --> 02:49:33.185]  It's like, it's like in Atlanta, they go, ooh, Jesse Ventura, get on over here.
[02:49:33.205 --> 02:49:35.547]  And didn't it happen to Ron Paul as well?
[02:49:35.768 --> 02:49:36.048]  Yes.
[02:49:36.328 --> 02:49:37.089]  Ron Paul, Rand Paul.
[02:49:37.169 --> 02:49:42.714]  And I watched these women, literally like the South Park episode, you know, literally going, mmm, good looking.
[02:49:42.774 --> 02:49:44.435]  I mean, I want to imitate them, that's what they were doing.
[02:49:45.336 --> 02:49:47.578]  And it was like, mmm, aww, mmm.
[02:49:47.918 --> 02:49:49.420]  And he got so mad, he left the country.
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:50:03.844]  Exactly, but you know, when we flew out to the West Coast recently, we were patted down, myself and the rest of the crew, and Josh, our camera guy, was walking around filming our pat-downs, and the guy comes up to him, the TSA guy, he says, what are you doing out here?
[02:50:03.884 --> 02:50:04.824]  You can't be filming out here.
[02:50:04.864 --> 02:50:12.266]  But we knew our rights, because of the opt-out and film campaign, you can film the TSA, they just don't like you to film their checkpoints, which you should be able to do anyway.
[02:50:12.606 --> 02:50:15.007]  But, you know, Josh was not even filming the checkpoints and he came over.
[02:50:15.207 --> 02:50:15.867]  He's like, what are you doing?
[02:50:15.888 --> 02:50:16.468]  He's like, I'm filming.
[02:50:16.488 --> 02:50:18.088]  He's like, well, I don't like you filming.
[02:50:18.128 --> 02:50:20.870]  And I started filming that guy, talking to Josh, filming me.
[02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:24.891]  And it didn't turn out too well for the guy because, you know, he was on his power trip.
[02:50:25.132 --> 02:50:25.852]  That's all you have to do.
[02:50:25.872 --> 02:50:27.633]  You have to stand up to these people and just say no.
[02:50:27.653 --> 02:50:27.893]  All right.
[02:50:27.913 --> 02:50:29.013]  And you vote with your dollars.
[02:50:29.433 --> 02:50:32.635]  Hey guys, when do we have a big space for Jakari to be on with us tomorrow?
[02:50:33.535 --> 02:50:33.995]  With the guests.
[02:50:34.015 --> 02:50:37.237]  I'm going to tell Lister's now during the three-hour show when we're going to be here Friday with Jakari.
[02:50:38.325 --> 02:50:39.426]  Jakari, great job.
[02:50:39.446 --> 02:50:47.711]  I'm going to come back and take some final calls here and some final news, but I know you're going to have a lot of updates on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:50:47.731 --> 02:50:55.296]  You're going to have other reports you're putting up on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube and on the Watson Channel, and those will be up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:55.316 --> 02:51:00.058]  You'll have live coverage before, during, and after Sunday on my Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:51:00.099 --> 02:51:00.439]  Central.
[02:51:01.119 --> 02:51:09.341]  Uh, so, uh, get out there, find some groups of lemmings, start asking them about how the government runs Al-Qaeda, and, uh, about proctology exams.
[02:51:11.001 --> 02:51:12.642]  Time and time again.
[02:51:12.942 --> 02:51:15.442]  You need to come here and help us.
[02:51:15.522 --> 02:51:16.623]  We need assistance.
[02:51:16.963 --> 02:51:17.543]  Please!
[02:51:17.783 --> 02:51:21.084]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:51:21.364 --> 02:51:27.465]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:51:27.765 --> 02:51:30.086]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[02:53:17.810 --> 02:53:25.901]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:53:26.201 --> 02:53:30.906]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:53:31.086 --> 02:53:37.812]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:53:37.872 --> 02:53:44.959]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:53:45.059 --> 02:53:51.905]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:53:52.065 --> 02:53:56.428]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:53:56.548 --> 02:53:59.810]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:54:24.847 --> 02:54:38.306]  On the nightly news tonight... On the nightly news this evening... We're probably gonna have Sheriff Mack on, or this particular sheriff.
[02:54:40.259 --> 02:54:49.407]  The particular police chief who had his department shut down because he dared go to an event trying to organize police to be pro-Constitution.
[02:54:49.827 --> 02:54:57.594]  But most police get sent by the feds to the ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center meetings where they literally badmouth George Washington and the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:54:58.114 --> 02:55:02.658]  So treason is wonderful, but if you just say, hey, I'm going to uphold the Bill of Rights, you're fired.
[02:55:04.042 --> 02:55:05.603]  That is so outrageous.
[02:55:06.404 --> 02:55:09.707]  By the way, you know, Rob Doo's on vacation and some of our other crew's out.
[02:55:09.747 --> 02:55:15.612]  We hardly have enough crew to be able to even perform stuff and get our shows done when a few of our crew are out.
[02:55:16.212 --> 02:55:29.444]  That's why it's so important that people continue to fund InfoWars.com by clicking on the sponsors, by buying the high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com, by getting the InfoWarsLife.com products, because that's how we fund our operation.

[02:56:01.503 --> 02:56:04.445]  Lorraine in Indiana, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:56:09.884 --> 02:56:10.945]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:56:11.085 --> 02:56:11.765]  I'm doing alright.
[02:56:11.785 --> 02:56:27.516]  I mean, I knew they were planning to turn the TSA into like secret police checkpoints where they kind of disappear people or interrogate them for separate stuff and they have a room full of feds waiting for you to use NSA databases to harass patriots, but now it's officially happening.
[02:56:27.556 --> 02:56:28.197]  It's pretty scary.
[02:56:29.537 --> 02:56:37.243]  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre that, you know, Jakari Jackson is out there, you know, and they're harassing actual people who are U.S.
[02:56:37.263 --> 02:56:37.563]  citizens.
[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:43.603]  And yet, we can't even do anything on the borders of our own country.
[02:56:43.623 --> 02:56:49.666]  You know, these people come in and we're going to reward them with actual citizenship.
[02:56:49.926 --> 02:56:52.348]  Well, by the way, it's not even a secret, but it's not well known.
[02:56:52.368 --> 02:56:54.849]  Illegals fly without IDs.
[02:56:55.570 --> 02:56:56.350]  I've seen it all the time.
[02:56:56.370 --> 02:57:00.133]  They just walk around with a piece of paper and mumble at the people and I just let them through.
[02:57:00.593 --> 02:57:03.335]  Just like the hospitals, because it's all selectively enforced.
[02:57:03.355 --> 02:57:03.875]  You understand that?
[02:57:05.874 --> 02:57:15.320]  Well, yeah, I'm actually an immigrant and I came to this country from England and actually became a naturalized U.S.
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:15.880]  citizen.
[02:57:17.441 --> 02:57:21.324]  My family actually left England because of the
[02:57:21.932 --> 02:57:25.513]  The tyrannical type monarchy that's going on over there, right?
[02:57:26.033 --> 02:57:29.454]  And we come over here, and now we're kind of looking at the same thing.
[02:57:29.494 --> 02:57:33.975]  You know, Obama and his family are like the new royal family.
[02:57:34.475 --> 02:57:38.376]  And everybody's bowing down to him, and it's just ridiculous.
[02:57:39.656 --> 02:57:50.139]  And I just want to say that it really kind of makes me angry when people say, you know, that, oh, we shouldn't call them illegal people.
[02:57:51.178 --> 02:57:54.141]  You know, there's no such thing as an illegal person.
[02:57:54.281 --> 02:57:56.764]  Well, that's what they call us in other countries.
[02:57:56.824 --> 02:57:57.544]  It's pure bull.
[02:57:57.625 --> 02:58:03.651]  It's like, we've got to be wide open, and we've got to pay for everything, and they're going to vote to take your guns now.
[02:58:03.671 --> 02:58:06.313]  I mean, we're committing suicide.
[02:58:06.333 --> 02:58:08.395]  We've been so gullible so long.
[02:58:08.996 --> 02:58:11.097]  That that's what this is, and it's a complete joke.
[02:58:11.117 --> 02:58:19.142]  I mean, the NSA spying, the groping, telling Texas they'd have F-16s, forced-down aircraft if they tried to block the TSA.
[02:58:19.523 --> 02:58:20.223]  I mean, exactly.
[02:58:20.263 --> 02:58:26.347]  The sky is the limit of the level of abuse that they mete out against us.
[02:58:26.687 --> 02:58:31.010]  We're going to go to break, do five minutes of overdrive, and talk to Itamio, I think.
[02:58:31.130 --> 02:58:31.930]  How do I pronounce that?
[02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.631]  E-tom-you?
[02:58:33.573 --> 02:58:34.373]  I can't pronounce anything.
[02:58:34.413 --> 02:58:35.714]  North American Union News.
[02:58:36.294 --> 02:58:37.154]  Then we're going to talk to Steve.
[02:58:37.194 --> 02:58:40.335]  He wants to talk about immigrants meeting with Governor and more.
[02:58:40.735 --> 02:58:42.975]  And we got Mike in Texas, says immigrants.
[02:58:44.436 --> 02:58:46.736]  He wants to talk about police scanner drills at mall.
[02:58:47.076 --> 02:58:47.716]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:47.756 --> 02:58:48.477]  Be ready, callers.
[02:58:48.497 --> 02:58:49.437]  I'm going to go to you quickly.
[02:58:49.797 --> 02:58:54.018]  And then more coverage tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PresidentPlanet.tv.
[02:58:54.098 --> 02:58:56.959]  If you're not a member, become one now.
[02:58:57.679 --> 02:58:58.179]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:59.617 --> 02:59:02.338]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:59:02.618 --> 02:59:07.460]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:14.823]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:59:14.943 --> 02:59:20.368]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[03:00:20.752 --> 03:00:21.672]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.292 --> 03:00:25.934]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.494 --> 03:00:30.596]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.816 --> 03:00:32.837]  All right, Itamio.
[03:00:32.877 --> 03:00:34.018]  Sorry I butchered your name.
[03:00:34.458 --> 03:00:35.518]  Go ahead, you're on the air, sir.
[03:00:37.479 --> 03:00:38.139]  Itamio.
[03:00:38.440 --> 03:00:39.340]  Close enough.
[03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:41.021]  All right, you're on the air.
[03:00:41.041 --> 03:00:41.241]  Go ahead.
[03:00:42.281 --> 03:00:43.622]  I wanted to talk about how
[03:00:44.594 --> 03:00:50.897]  We don't fully understand the psychology of these so-called masters that control us.
[03:00:51.537 --> 03:00:55.519]  Because as far as they're concerned, we're no longer even human.
[03:00:56.219 --> 03:00:57.699]  We're property now.
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:04.462]  Because they've implanted us in a system of usury through interest and through debt.
[03:01:05.543 --> 03:01:07.443]  Our property is no longer ours.
[03:01:09.364 --> 03:01:13.486]  Our houses, our children, nothing is no longer yours.
[03:01:14.142 --> 03:01:16.423]  Because now you're indebted to your master.
[03:01:16.883 --> 03:01:22.106]  So therefore, all your energy and all your production now belongs to us.
[03:01:23.086 --> 03:01:23.426]  For what?
[03:01:23.606 --> 03:01:28.229]  To use for what we want to do with it and for our gain.
[03:01:28.409 --> 03:01:28.909]  No, you're right.
[03:01:28.949 --> 03:01:32.350]  They see us as animals, as cattle, and that's their public plan.
[03:01:32.390 --> 03:01:34.972]  But they did it by fraud, so it's illegitimate.
[03:01:36.873 --> 03:01:37.453]  Exactly.
[03:01:37.713 --> 03:01:42.075]  I think 90% of the problems we face right now
[03:01:42.959 --> 03:01:46.382]  Could be solved by eliminating the concept of interest.
[03:01:47.783 --> 03:01:50.044]  No, I absolutely agree with you.
[03:01:50.485 --> 03:01:58.751]  Because, you know, once you have the interest instead of a one-time payment for money, then it expands out into everything else, and then everything is based on their fraud.
[03:01:58.791 --> 03:02:00.152]  They get the world for nothing.
[03:02:00.472 --> 03:02:02.414]  We go into debt to the globalists for nothing.
[03:02:02.674 --> 03:02:03.975]  They get everything for nothing.
[03:02:06.101 --> 03:02:06.802]  Exactly.
[03:02:07.022 --> 03:02:09.403]  And look at what China's doing over there in the East Coast.
[03:02:09.543 --> 03:02:13.606]  China's bought nearly half of Manhattan for pennies on the dollar.
[03:02:13.806 --> 03:02:17.209]  America is literally a joke, and we've got to turn around now.
[03:02:17.309 --> 03:02:18.029]  Call back some other day.
[03:02:18.049 --> 03:02:18.890]  You're really well spoken.
[03:02:18.910 --> 03:02:20.271]  A fine point, sir.
[03:02:20.351 --> 03:02:21.011]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:21.832 --> 03:02:23.453]  Clark, go ahead in Arizona.
[03:02:23.493 --> 03:02:23.773]  Go ahead.
[03:02:23.793 --> 03:02:25.434]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:02:25.694 --> 03:02:27.316]  I'm down here on the Mexican border.
[03:02:28.857 --> 03:02:31.158]  Not too far from the Saguaro National Monument.
[03:02:32.379 --> 03:02:35.281]  And what they've done, they have now expanded the monument.
[03:02:35.996 --> 03:02:42.679]  And the BLM adjoining lands, claiming the whole area south of I-8 is now a national monument.
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:48.582]  Yeah, I know, and 60 miles north they put signs up telling Americans not to go into it because of the drug smuggling.
[03:02:48.842 --> 03:02:50.503]  So the border's already 60 miles up.
[03:02:51.824 --> 03:02:55.306]  When you go in there like I do, I guarantee you one thing.
[03:02:55.986 --> 03:03:03.810]  Those park rangers are going to pull you over, they're going to run your license, they're going to sit there and question you for at least an hour, and then tell you to get out.
[03:03:06.184 --> 03:03:08.265]  Well that's right, you're an American slave, scum!
[03:03:10.486 --> 03:03:15.128]  But the Mexicans are coming across this area like you would not believe, and I'm talking about the illegal ones.
[03:03:16.609 --> 03:03:33.317]  We got right smack dab in the middle of the drug cartel trail here, and we have, well, many are just looking for work, but there's a lot of them just bringing dope in, and what they'll do is they'll come into this RV park where I'm at, in hopes that somebody will call ICE, or Border Patrol,
[03:03:34.167 --> 03:03:35.688]  They can get a free ride back to Mexico.
[03:03:36.189 --> 03:03:39.791]  I know, it's all a total joke.
[03:03:39.851 --> 03:03:41.793]  It's an absolute total joke.
[03:03:41.853 --> 03:03:48.478]  Mexico is a collapsing country south of us and the answer is let Mexico collapse into us.
[03:03:48.538 --> 03:03:49.478]  What a great idea.
[03:03:49.979 --> 03:03:52.681]  Well yeah, they want to break us under Agenda 21.
[03:03:53.341 --> 03:03:54.322]  Thank you so much Clark.
[03:03:54.582 --> 03:03:55.923]  Mike in Texas, go ahead quickly.
[03:03:57.705 --> 03:04:00.266]  Hey Alex, this is Mike in Midland, Texas.
[03:04:00.386 --> 03:04:00.847]  I have a
[03:04:01.502 --> 03:04:08.484]  Digital police scanner, so I'm able to listen to the airport and you know state police and all that stuff this morning about 9 a.m.
[03:04:09.925 --> 03:04:12.826]  Dispatch was talking to some on the undercover channels.
[03:04:12.846 --> 03:04:17.908]  They were talking about having You know like role players like do you have the role players?
[03:04:17.948 --> 03:04:18.588]  Are they coming?
[03:04:18.608 --> 03:04:18.808]  Yes?
[03:04:18.848 --> 03:04:26.791]  They are and so they're planning on having a drill at the Midland Park Mall in Midland, Texas Sunday, I think around 2 p.m.
[03:04:28.394 --> 03:04:32.198]  Um, so you know, my thing is, if they've got roleplayers, what are they going to roleplay?
[03:04:32.258 --> 03:04:34.020]  You know, are they going to roleplay getting shot?
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:41.788]  You know, are they going to roleplay getting... Oh yeah, they always do that with people around to condition everyone to create the imagination that there's more shootings than there are.
[03:04:41.808 --> 03:04:43.070]  It's a psych warfare program.
[03:04:43.550 --> 03:04:46.233]  So that's in Midland, Texas at the Midland Park Mall.
[03:04:47.114 --> 03:04:48.556]  Uh, this Sunday you said?
[03:04:49.236 --> 03:04:49.637]  Yes sir.
[03:04:50.814 --> 03:04:57.583]  Well, somebody should go out there, hang around the mall that day, get some video of it, as a citizen journalist, put it on YouTube, and show the fear.
[03:04:57.623 --> 03:04:58.084]  Great point.
[03:04:58.464 --> 03:04:59.385]  Sorry to Steve and others.
[03:04:59.425 --> 03:05:00.046]  I'm out of time.
[03:05:00.086 --> 03:05:00.887]  Great job to the crew.
[03:05:01.528 --> 03:05:05.493]  7 o'clock tonight, special edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:05:05.614 --> 03:05:05.994]  Be there.
[03:05:06.355 --> 03:05:07.196]  Spread the word, folks.
[03:05:07.236 --> 03:05:07.857]  We need your help.
[03:05:10.572 --> 03:05:14.857]  Angioprim can clean blocked arteries and improve blood flow in all parts of your body.
[03:05:15.078 --> 03:05:17.060]  Angioprim is liquid oral chelation.
[03:05:17.260 --> 03:05:18.362]  It's not new science.
[03:05:18.822 --> 03:05:22.306]  50 years of research has gone into chelation and now there's Angioprim.
