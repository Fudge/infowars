[00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:07.836]  We're under attack!
[00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:08.580]  Look out!
[00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:21.400]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in McAllen, Texas, where behind me, the Department of Homeland Security is essentially putting up another giant detention center.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.401]  They're calling it an immigration holding cell.
[00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.641]  It is 55,000 square feet.
[00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:39.745]  It is separated into four different pods, and they're expected to hold up to 1,000 kids at 72-hour increments at a time and release them by bus into different parts of the country unknown.
[00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:46.489]  They have TVs set up in their giant large flat screen TVs, better than the TVs that you and I have at home.
[00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.112]  They have a health facility.
[00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:52.714]  They have a, like a DFAC, a dining facility.
[00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.176]  All this stuff is inside here right now.
[00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:57.438]  And behind me too, if you see, there's a brown bus.
[00:00:57.878 --> 00:00:59.740]  It is a giant FEMA bus.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.226]  Here comes more and more politicians out of this brand new facility in McAllen, Texas, where they've been meeting.
[00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:12.570]  And coming up with ways to help the Obama administration import poverty into our country.
[00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.076]  What's happening to our country right now is mind-blowing.
[00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:20.182]  In McAllen, Texas, I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
