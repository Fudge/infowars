[00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:12.932]  Were you thinking the elf on a shelf was just a playful way to get your kids to behave in the days leading up to Christmas?
[00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.333]  Well, think again.
[00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:20.337]  According to a digital tech professor, you're actually conditioning your kids to accept the surveillance state.
[00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:21.338]  Think about it.
[00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:33.191]  He's always watching your kids, he reports back to a higher authority, he'll dole out goodies if they behave, and if not, their name goes on the no-fly, er, the naughty list.
[00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:38.978]  Are you teaching your kids that you're the boss, or some unseen authority is the boss?
[00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:51.583]  In her recently published paper titled, Who's the Boss?, Laura Pinto says the idea of the doll reporting back to Santa each night sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures.
[00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:57.606]  It teaches kids that it's okay to be spied on and you shouldn't have any expectation of privacy.
[00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:06.649]  Now, considering the fact that children have been told for years that Santa's making a list and checking it twice, Pinto's probably just being paranoid.
[00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.031]  But this kind of conditioning behavior isn't unique to the elf on the shelf.
[00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:16.213]  We've seen blatant conditioning like this in cartoons like Disney's Shutterbug Time.
[00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:21.615]  Camera-equipped ladybugs spy on kids and then report back to a central authority.
[00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:32.102]  This introduction to the new totalitarian society is benign, though, because the snooper is just a cute little ladybug who only spies because she loves you.
[00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:40.108]  This is, of course, predictive programming to get your children to accept the coming drone surveillance state, which we warned you about in 2007.
[00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:50.195]  DARPA researchers were working on injecting computer chips into moth pupa and then hatching them into sophisticated cyborg moths, literal shutterbugs.
[00:01:51.016 --> 00:02:03.464]  Now, if you aren't aware, predictive programming is a technique that's based on planting ideas and concepts in the brains of viewers so that they'll seem normal and more easily accepted when they actually happen.
[00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:08.067]  The Vigilant Citizen took an in-depth look at iconic 80s cartoon G.I.
[00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:11.629]  Joe and found a strange case of predictive programming.
[00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:12.990]  In the first G.I.
[00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.292]  Joe episode ever aired, titled Pyramid of Darkness,
[00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:22.355]  Cobra seeks to take control of the world by shutting down the power grid of the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:25.957]  Other episode plots include the replacement of the U.S.
[00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:34.422]  dollar, confiscating citizens' gold, and the usage of mind control on civilians and MKUltra in the entertainment business.
[00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:36.063]  Cobra is real!
[00:02:36.503 --> 00:02:38.044]  You can call it whatever you want!
[00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.205]  Cobra is in control of America!
[00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:45.648]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:51.131]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:57.874]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath!
[00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:01.356]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:03.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:24.238]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
