[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:13.950]  It makes you realize that if there's even one thing we can do to keep our children and our community safe, there's just one step we can take to prevent more families from feeling what they feel after they've lost a loved one.
[00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:19.244]  In 2012, there were more blacks aborted in New York City than born.
[00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:32.671]  Which is to say, while people will march up and down the streets for high-profile slayings, many of those same people don't seem to care that the biggest scourge to their communities isn't gangs or drugs, but the right to choose.
[00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:38.275]  Equally chilling is that over 50% of aborted babies in Georgia are black.
[00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:46.802]  One of the most visible processors of abortion is Planned Parenthood, which was once known as the Birth Control League, a Margaret Sanger organization.
[00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:52.449]  Eugenics movement was once again used by the American Birth Control League.
[00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.952]  The Marcus Sangers of those days did not come out and say they were trying to eliminate black people.
[00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:02.475]  What they did say they were trying to rid society of the feeble-minded.
[00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.897]  They were trying to rid the society of the criminal.
[00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:14.382]  Well, she was successful simply because of her eugenics friends for the past 50 years had
[00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:22.264]  Whether you're pro-choice or not, please be aware that the reason Planned Parenthood buildings are so prevalent in minority neighborhoods is to kill minorities.
[00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:41.238]  No, no, no, I'm not profiting.
[00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:42.198]  I was a taxpayer.
[00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:48.942]  Do not wish to pay for those babies to be born and brought up and kill those people in Colorado.
[00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:50.663]  Go ahead and pay for that.
[00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:53.925]  Let me see you adopt one of those ugly black babies.
[00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:09.873]  In Mississippi, 72% of aborted babies are black.
[00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:14.174]  The numbers also show that more than a few white children are regularly aborted.
[00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:19.496]  It's a shame when anyone is murdered, even when the murderer happens to be your own mother.
[00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:24.577]  Many women are led to believe that their child isn't a person until it's actually born.
[00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.298]  When do you think life starts?
[00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:27.017]  Yeah.
[00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:29.039]  Well, I don't know if it's controversial.
[00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.361]  I don't know that it's really relevant to the conversation.
[00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.923]  But, I mean, for me, I'm a mother of three children.
[00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:38.626]  For me, life began when I delivered them.
[00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:44.731]  Many naysayers will tell you that the majority of Planned Parenthood's operation doesn't involve abortion.
[00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:48.654]  Well, can we get rid of the percent that does involve abortion?
[00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:54.939]  The work of Sanger is still alive and well today, with the likes of Mrs. Clinton singing her praises.
[00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:57.323]  I admire Thomas Jefferson.
[00:02:57.763 --> 00:03:03.025]  I admire his words and his leadership, and I deplore his unrepentant slaveholding.
[00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:14.550]  I admire Margaret Sanger being a pioneer in trying to empower women to have some control over their bodies, and I deplore statements that you have referenced.
[00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:19.933]  That is the way we often are when we look at flawed human beings.
[00:03:20.153 --> 00:03:22.774]  There are things that we admire and things we deplore.
[00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:30.952]  I rarely agree with Mrs. Clinton on anything, but she's right to point out that President Jefferson also treated blacks in a less than human fashion.
[00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:36.776]  He should also be known for the 1807 Act prohibiting importation of slaves.
[00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:47.846]  Yes, Jefferson was a slaveholder, but he included bold anti-slavery language in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence that was removed.
[00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:54.270]  As President on March 2nd, 1807, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.
[00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.733]  This Act took effect in 1808 and was the earliest allowed under the Constitution.
[00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:10.460]  So the next time someone demands that you give up your rights to save just one child, remind them that their pro-choice stance has killed millions since Roe v. Wade.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.002]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:14.422 --> 00:04:14.742]  You have 43%
[00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:24.430]  Of all abortions performed in this country, performed on black babies, we're only 12% of the population.
[00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:31.216]  In the state of New York in 2008, more black babies were aborted than born.
[00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:33.799]  Now, it doesn't matter what your politics is on that again.
[00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:40.465]  Those numbers, though, are very troubling when you talk about just 7% of the population.
[00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:54.688]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:57.249]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:07.296]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:15.761]  That's why we're rolling out on 100% made-in-America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.542]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:23.204]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:05:23.584 --> 00:05:24.485]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:28.247]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:33.529]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:34.269]  We're good to go.
