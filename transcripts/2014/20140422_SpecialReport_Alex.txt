[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:07.353]  Four powerful Hollywood moguls were accused of committing the sexual abuse of teenage boys in 1999.
[00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:19.720]  They include X-Men director Bryan Singer, former president of BBC Worldwide America and former head of programming for Fox, NBC and the WB Garth Ansear.
[00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:27.445]  Gary Goddard, the head of a Los Angeles design group and former president of Disney TV David Newman.
[00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:33.670]  Mr. Newman previously worked with the ringleader of the perversion, Mark Collins Rector.
[00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:43.179]  Mr. Rector is a registered sex offender that pled guilty in 2004 to luring minors across state lines for sexual acts.
[00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:47.223]  The accuser is Michael Egan, now 31 years old.
[00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:59.137]  He claims that when he was a teenager, he was given money and threatened to keep quiet about the events that took place in Hawaii and Los Angeles, or he would be eliminated, along with his family.
[00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:08.126]  However, Mr. Egan claims to have reported it to the police and subsequently the FBI in the year 2000, but no action was taken.
[00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:19.537]  Mr. Egan's lawyer, Jeff Herman, has until April 24th, 2014 to file additional charges against additional alleged perps in the state of Hawaii.
[00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:22.440]  Thursday, April 24th, is the cutoff
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.221]  We're good to go.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.283]  Sexual abuse of minors by Hollywood big shots is nothing new.
[00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:56.826]  The two Corys, Feldman and Haim, recounted how they were abused by executives.
[00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.648]  Corey Feldman says it led to Corey Haim's untimely death.
[00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:09.874]  Well-known actor Jeffrey Jones was arrested for possession of child pornography and accused of soliciting a 14-year-old boy to pose for pornographic photographs.
[00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:19.059]  Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski was hunted for years for the rape of a 13-year-old girl, eventually ending up doing time in a Swiss prison.
[00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.640]  The perversion in the British entertainment industry is just as flagrant.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.363]  BBC presenter Stuart Hall was jailed in 2013 for 14 counts of indecent assault against girls as young as nine.
[00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:45.899]  BBC radio personality Freddie Zapp was accused of sexual assault of a female and of course we all know of Jimmy Savile's unrelenting abuse of minors that spiraled out of control for years while authorities looked the other way.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.825]  There are 1 million children exploited every year in the global sex trade.
[00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:57.568]  A 32 billion dollar industry that has ties to the highest levels of government.
[00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:06.051]  The time has come to reclaim our dignity from the sick, elitist cancer that is rotting the very core of humanity.
