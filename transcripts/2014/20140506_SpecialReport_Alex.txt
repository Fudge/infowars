[00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:22.793]  We're here on 6th Street in downtown Austin, Texas on Cinco de Mayo to get people's take on not only the holiday, but how many activists use it to create racial division and artificial conflict in the nation.
[00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.075]  So what's your take on Cinco de Mayo?
[00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.333]  I think everybody ought to have Independence Day.
[00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:31.975]  It's not a real Mexican holiday, so yeah.
[00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:32.475]  It is.
[00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:34.076]  It's when we defeated the French.
[00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:35.216]  Oh, the French, yeah.
[00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:37.097]  I'm like, it's when we defeated the French.
[00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.098]  Of course it's a holiday.
[00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.199]  That's why we celebrate it.
[00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.560]  People think it's Independence Day, but it's not.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.522]  Independence Day is the 16th of September.
[00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.883]  Second of May, it's everything.
[00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:47.363]  It's good.
[00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:49.624]  You know, it's really cool.
[00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:50.565]  Beer.
[00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:51.811]  Beer.
[00:00:52.132 --> 00:00:52.372]  Beer.
[00:00:53.192 --> 00:00:54.653]  So is that how you typically celebrate it?
[00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.535]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:00:57.435 --> 00:00:58.856]  I like tacos and quesadillas.
[00:00:58.996 --> 00:00:59.737]  So, you know what I mean?
[00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:00.457]  I'm good like that.
[00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:07.202]  It seems like every year on this holiday we hear reports from school students that are sent home for wearing American flags on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:11.085]  We also, today we saw people trying to ban American flags from being shown.
[00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.206]  What's your take on that?
[00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:14.347]  It seems like there's a big assault on free speech.
[00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.729]  I don't think anybody should do that because you're in America.
[00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.770]  I'm Mexican-American, so I celebrate both.
[00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:20.832]  Fourth of July is actually one of my favorite holidays.
[00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:22.745]  I don't know why they would.
[00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:24.586]  What's the argument?
[00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:30.027]  They're suggesting that it's racist.
[00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:33.888]  We're in America, so you can wear an American flag shirt any day you like.
[00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:36.409]  Some people have been taught wrong and raised wrong.
[00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:37.169]  Raised to hate.
[00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.890]  I believe hate should be outlawed.
[00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.131]  Raised to hate people?
[00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:43.711]  That should be outlawed.
[00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:47.752]  Because if we all get along, this would be a better world.
[00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.773]  If people want to nitpick that much, they're really bored.
[00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.808]  So you think we should be able to show it on any day of the year?
[00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.209]  American flag, that is?
[00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.772]  I think you were put on this earth to do anything you want to.
[00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:02.335]  And nobody should have to tell you anything that you don't want to do.
[00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:06.258]  So if I feel like putting on an American flag, that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:12.203]  If anything, like, there should be... Okay, you know how people, like, say there should be, like, a world peace under one flag, right?
[00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:13.264]  I say screw that.
[00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:15.746]  If you want world peace, there should be no flag at all.
[00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:17.167]  Screw it.
[00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:19.829]  So you're saying it's kind of hypocritical then, correct?
[00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:25.696]  For whatever reason, whoever is telling them they can't wear that, yeah, that's super hypocritical.
[00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:28.158]  No one's gonna tell you to take off a Mexico flag shirt.
[00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:29.839]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.060]  Most people think if I do it, it's okay.
[00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:38.163]  If you do it, it's not okay if I don't like what you're doing.
[00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:42.826]  I don't think you need to bring any racial comments or any racial things into this American.
[00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:47.769]  What would you say to people who would suggest that it's racist to show an American flag on Cinco de Mayo?
[00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.430]  Get a life.
