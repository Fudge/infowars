[00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:09.604]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:11.186]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:12.728]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.933]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.998]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:47.361]  Well, my head is spinning to say the least right now with the amount of over-the-top news.
[00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:55.344]  As Obama prepares with executive orders to legalize illegals by fiat, he's already done that, halting most of the deportations.
[00:00:55.344 --> 00:01:03.048]  There are hundreds of thousands of illegals a month swamming into the Texas-Arizona-California border.
[00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:06.310]  Creating a total crisis.
[00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.492]  Here's the Reuters headline.
[00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:13.457]  Waves of immigrant minors present crisis for Obama Congress.
[00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:15.780]  They've got tens of thousands of them at a base.
[00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:27.558]  Just down in San Antonio that we've been reporting on, tens of thousands of children unaccompanied by parents or relatives have flooded across the southern U.S.
[00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:34.741]  border illegally, forcing the Obama administration and Congress to grapple with both the humanitarian crisis and a budget dilemma.
[00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.183]  Well, the answer is don't be racist.
[00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:42.465]  Legalize all 7 plus billion people that are not in the U.S.
[00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:45.226]  and bring them here and give them free tuition, free welfare.
[00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:49.253]  Does it matter if you have leprosy?
[00:01:49.253 --> 00:01:51.553]  Does it matter if you're disabled?
[00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:53.734]  Does it matter what problem you have?
[00:01:53.734 --> 00:02:08.858]  We need to bring them here, pay for everything, and go totally bankrupt and collapse so the globalists can live in Luxembourg, the Bahamas, and in Switzerland, exempt from all of this sitting on trillions.
[00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.639]  And I agree with Obama.
[00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.380]  If you have a business, you didn't build it.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.061]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise debt.
[00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:18.261]  You can keep your doctor.
[00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:19.321]  Healthcare is great.
[00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:22.042]  You know, DrudgeReport.com has a headline.
[00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:26.683]  Cancer patient with dozens of tumors denied coverage under Obamacare.
[00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:32.004]  Because it says in there you get death panels now.
[00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.205]  But it doesn't matter, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:37.065]  Obama says so.
[00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:38.986]  It's a good thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:44.474]  It's a very, very, very good thing.
[00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:52.347]  Sonoma County man battling cancer denied coverage by Anaheim Blue Cross after paying $100,000 to them.
[00:02:55.018 --> 00:03:03.200]  And if we continue here with the news, and you guys can just punch it up on screen in there, too, if you'd like that even clearer for folks.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.182]  Cancer patient, again, below that story, is it Bilderberg Conference or is it a conspiracy?
[00:03:10.182 --> 00:03:12.082]  Well, first, mainstream media said it didn't exist.
[00:03:12.082 --> 00:03:17.984]  Now they're being forced to report on it because DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, and others are covering it.
[00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:22.625]  Days after we start covering it, they're now forced to cover it.
[00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:35.991]  And then below the all-seeing eye right there, you can see world's most powerful to debate privacy and the internet.
[00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:39.813]  And reporters arrested as cloak of secrecy descends.
[00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:42.194]  That's an InfoWars.com article.
[00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:48.698]  And then Atlanta mayor rising star, means he's presidential material, that he's at Bilderberg as well.
[00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:50.719]  That's reported by local Atlanta TV.
[00:03:52.597 --> 00:03:57.162]  And then the most important article of the day, when I saw this at 6 a.m.
[00:03:57.162 --> 00:04:04.609]  this morning, I called our writers and said, can we please write an article about this and tie it into all the other articles we've written?
[00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.252]  Because now it's hit the mainstream.
[00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:13.058]  The Washington Times, with the public document, reports that Obama, hold on to your hat here,
[00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:18.412]  Now you already know this, but this is now admitted in a new document.
[00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:22.357]  Once the military prepared for war with the American people to stop civil unrest...
[00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:31.604]  And to quote, use drones, drones against the American people.
[00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:39.186]  In fact, the Washington Times headline should be, Obama readies military with drones to suppress dissent in America.
[00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:42.888]  Because you read the document that they're linked to in the article.
[00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:43.828]  Guys, I forgot to print it.
[00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:46.569]  Link through the document and print it for me.
[00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.451]  And it's all right there in the article.
[00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:58.248]  I mean the total preparation in the document for treasonous war.
[00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:03.958]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.321]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:11.984]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:15.026]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:22.591]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:26.234]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:26.454 --> 00:05:30.918]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:30.918 --> 00:05:36.904]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:40.827]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:40.827 --> 00:05:43.570]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.911]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:46.433]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:48.255]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:03.561]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:08.689]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:16.521]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:21.324]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:06:21.324 --> 00:06:25.307]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:06:25.307 --> 00:06:31.251]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.433]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:39.576]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:39.776 --> 00:06:47.962]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:02.914]  In the near future.
[00:07:02.914 --> 00:07:07.398]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:07:07.398 --> 00:07:08.619]  Security alert.
[00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.640]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.501]  Analysis.
[00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:12.242]  InfoWars.
[00:07:12.242 --> 00:07:14.343]  Building independent media operations.
[00:07:14.343 --> 00:07:19.227]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:07:19.227 --> 00:07:20.248]  Crime Directive.
[00:07:20.248 --> 00:07:21.789]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.652]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.894]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.056]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:31.717]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.538]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:36.498]  They are never going to stop.
[00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:40.520]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:47.462]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:07:47.462 --> 00:07:48.463]  Imperative.
[00:07:48.463 --> 00:07:50.523]  Deploy Prison Planet TV.
[00:07:50.523 --> 00:07:54.965]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:57.306]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:08.775]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:10.298]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.202]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:29.842]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.703]  Central.
[00:08:30.703 --> 00:08:32.084]  We're here live ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:32.084 --> 00:08:37.008]  We're live on this 29th day of May 2014 on this Thursday edition.
[00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:59.904]  Our reporters, Paul Joseph Watson, David Knight, Josh Owens, and others are on the ground in Copenhagen, Denmark for Bilderberg 2014 as the world discovers our overlords and our illegitimate rulers.
[00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:02.965]  They want us to stay focused on the puppets, the front men.
[00:09:02.965 --> 00:09:07.888]  But we're going to spotlight the real power behind the throne, the man behind the curtain,
[00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:28.682]  The men behind the curtain, the women behind the curtain, that are eugenicist, globalist, anti-human garbage, who are the progenitors, the creators of people like the Nazis and modern communism as we know it.
[00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:35.687]  They are the old oligarchs, the robber barons, the great-grandchildren of the robber barons and the British and Dutch and German royalty.
[00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.076]  And the Rothschilds.
[00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:41.080]  They are the power elite.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.906]  And they see you and I as total scum animals who have no rights and are here to be usurped by them.
[00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:48.207]  And now our labor's cheap.
[00:09:48.207 --> 00:09:49.489]  In fact, it's worthless.
[00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:50.330]  They've got robots.
[00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.631]  They've got computers.
[00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:52.932]  They say they're done with us.
[00:09:53.837 --> 00:10:12.036]  Now they're just busy slowing the economy, turning off the economy to get control of us politically, to domesticate us for the orderly reclamation or spiking, the wrecking, the demolition of humanity as we know it.
[00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:13.758]  Every statistic shows it.
[00:10:13.758 --> 00:10:14.779]  Every number shows it.
[00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:17.161]  The system isn't failed.
[00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.324]  It's designed to implode.
[00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:21.646]  But there's still good people in the system.
[00:10:21.646 --> 00:10:27.033]  There's still part of the old system that wasn't perfect, but is wonderful compared to this.
[00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:32.459]  And there's renaissance, new systems as well, that are all in competition with each other.
[00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:39.842]  The globalists worldwide have control of central banking and the issuance of fractional reserve banking.
[00:10:39.842 --> 00:10:45.426]  For every euro, for every dollar, they are able to loan out under the old system $10.
[00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:58.056]  Under derivatives of the last 50 years and other paper frauds, they are able to loan out thousands of times per dollar what they have.
[00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:02.992]  And then they hope you go bankrupt because then they get your real assets.
[00:11:02.992 --> 00:11:04.233]  They get you.
[00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:07.036]  They get your soul.
[00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:17.024]  Because we're sold out to money and to them it's literally nothing but garbage that they create out of nothing.
[00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:20.928]  In fact, there was an article on Monday I meant to cover that was so chilling.
[00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:22.329]  Will you guys reprint it for me?
[00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:23.350]  It was a headline.
[00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.852]  It was also in the Jerusalem Post, but I think the one I had was from
[00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:29.970]  I think it was Zero Hedge.
[00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.212]  It was Israel to become first cashless nation.
[00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:36.935]  And then I was reading through the article.
[00:11:36.935 --> 00:11:41.017]  There's nothing more hellish for control than cashless.
[00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:42.918]  Oh, it's very convenient.
[00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:44.139]  It's very easy.
[00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:45.560]  Oh, you just have it on your key fob.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.241]  You don't have to keep track of it.
[00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:50.523]  The problem is they're going to put fines and fees and regulations on it.
[00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:55.146]  It's going to kill the underground markets and it's going to create a nightmare system
[00:11:57.606 --> 00:12:01.689]  Of absolute total control.
[00:12:01.689 --> 00:12:02.829]  In fact, they found the headline.
[00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:03.210]  There it is.
[00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.971]  Zero Hedge.
[00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:12.135]  Government plan would transfer Israel into the world's first cashless society.
[00:12:12.135 --> 00:12:14.577]  And they're selling it like it's a wonderful thing.
[00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:17.579]  It could not be more hellish.
[00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:21.581]  That's why more and more I'm getting cash to pay for dinners.
[00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.542]  I'm getting cash to pay for bonuses.
[00:12:24.448 --> 00:12:31.055]  I mean, we need to take it out of the bank post IRS tax, the private federal reserve, so the tax is even paid on it.
[00:12:31.055 --> 00:12:41.985]  But I'm paying people in cash in some cases so that we can keep cash alive because cash is already digital.
[00:12:41.985 --> 00:12:42.646]  The new U.S.
[00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:47.311]  money has tracker numbers on it and it's got RFID they can read from a distance.
[00:12:48.786 --> 00:12:53.150]  But the elite themselves, rich families and others are hoarding gold and cash.
[00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:02.979]  It is so important to keep cash, ladies and gentlemen, because it allows the globalists that run the narcotics and all the corrupt operations to exempt themselves in the digital systems.
[00:13:02.979 --> 00:13:09.505]  I'm sure you've noticed that you never see the big banks getting busted for publicly laundering trillions of drug money every year.
[00:13:09.505 --> 00:13:13.069]  Or owning the drug aircraft as Wells Fargo has been caught doing with Wachovia.
[00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:16.517]  Because they're literally above the law.
[00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:23.221]  So, no amount of cashless society, no-your-customer garbage is there to keep us safe or stop terrorism.
[00:13:23.221 --> 00:13:34.967]  It's there to selectively shut down our society and then totally destroy their competition because only, again, the globalists will be exempt.
[00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:42.211]  You won't be exempt, so you can't exempt yourself and go to the black market or the underground economy that keeps authoritarian societies going.
[00:13:43.567 --> 00:13:46.008]  And by that, it doesn't keep the authoritarians going.
[00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:51.511]  It keeps people in an authoritarian society from being completely destroyed.
[00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:56.394]  When you have a lawless criminal government, it becomes a duty to not follow the criminal laws.
[00:13:56.394 --> 00:13:59.816]  It becomes a duty to not pay the taxes.
[00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:03.898]  It becomes a duty to not comply.
[00:14:03.898 --> 00:14:07.781]  And I've never really said, you know, don't pay the taxes.
[00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:10.022]  But when it comes to Obamacare, it's now time to not do it.
[00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:12.405]  It's a death panel.
[00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:14.326]  It's an abortion funding system.
[00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:16.748]  It's an infanticide eugenic system.
[00:14:16.748 --> 00:14:19.289]  It's kill grandma system on record.
[00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:21.890]  It's don't give cancer patients treatment.
[00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:27.013]  That's NBC News today.
[00:14:27.013 --> 00:14:28.194]  Look at this headline.
[00:14:28.194 --> 00:14:35.817]  Children as young as five labeled suspicious by Florida police as they put them in databases.
[00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:38.759]  That's out of Fusion.net, one of the big police sites.
[00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:44.116]  I mean, this country is just a total joke.
[00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:47.139]  What about listing the globalists as suspicious?
[00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:49.642]  What about listing powerful elites as suspicious?
[00:14:49.642 --> 00:14:55.629]  Oh, they don't exist, remember?
[00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:56.911]  Remember?
[00:14:56.911 --> 00:15:00.895]  There's no secret elites meeting with government officials to set policy.
[00:15:00.895 --> 00:15:01.496]  Oops!
[00:15:01.496 --> 00:15:02.197]  We exposed it.
[00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:05.405]  We've gotten the documents time and time again.
[00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:17.613]  Now Bilderberg admits they exist, that they're more powerful than Dave Us, that they are setting policy, and they've told that to major German newspapers, and you can just put it in a pipe and smoke it, and they don't care.
[00:15:17.613 --> 00:15:24.217]  Really what they're doing is acting like they don't care, and acting like they're powerful and untouchable, because they're totally scared.
[00:15:24.217 --> 00:15:25.758]  They are running scared.
[00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:30.160]  And I have the stack of Bilderberg news here in front of me.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.242]  Let me just read these headlines ahead of David Knight joining us.
[00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:42.454]  We caught video of General Petraeus going for a jog at Bilderberg 2014 on the waterfront they have completely fenced off.
[00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:51.638]  General Petraeus, CIA head and former General Petraeus was seen exiting the Marriott Hotel and jogging down the street being chased by InfoWars reporters.
[00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:54.299]  And again, our guys confirmed it was Petraeus, it was in the Bilderberg area.
[00:15:54.299 --> 00:16:00.121]  It's hard to pick up on the camera, but if you blow it up you can see that it's Petraeus.
[00:16:00.121 --> 00:16:00.781]  Continuing,
[00:16:02.622 --> 00:16:08.908]  We have a photo gallery at Infowars.com of people being arrested and other such things at Bilderberg.
[00:16:08.908 --> 00:16:14.073]  2014 protesters being arrested.
[00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.635]  The police aren't messing with you unless you cause a disturbance.
[00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:20.960]  I had some provocateur getting in our reporter's faces and they got drug off.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.142]  There's nothing being hidden though, it doesn't exist.
[00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:28.825]  The New York Times said that I literally, you know, said it was imaginary in 2008.
[00:16:49.545 --> 00:16:54.207]  Oh, from us being conspiracy theorists too, is it a criminal conspiracy?
[00:16:54.207 --> 00:17:17.616]  London Evening Standard, Ed Steers, Clear, Bilderberg Group, we've got other reports, Bilderberg at 60, Insides the World's Most Secretive Conference, that's the London Guardian, and we have all that big exclusive live feeds and more at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but here is the specific article
[00:17:18.576 --> 00:17:31.340]  If you're watching us on television, Out of the Guardian, that's a big report by Charlie Skelton, Bilderberg at 60, inside the world's most secretive conference.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:44.545]  So, massive coverage now in the foreign dinosaur press, and now even some coverage in the controlled press here in the United States.
[00:17:44.545 --> 00:17:45.465]  So that is certainly
[00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:48.703]  Some extremely positive news.
[00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:52.146]  Here's RT, the Russian news.
[00:17:52.146 --> 00:17:53.427]  NATO chief, former U.S.
[00:17:53.427 --> 00:17:59.913]  intelligence director, among Bilderberg elite, meeting right now.
[00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.715]  Zero Hedge is covering it as well.
[00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:05.758]  We have to again thank DrudgeReport.com.
[00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:09.581]  Every year, there's not a lot of coverage until Drudge picks up the list from us.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.703]  And then picks up some of the other reports we put out.
[00:18:14.703 --> 00:18:15.904]  That's the pattern it follows.
[00:18:15.904 --> 00:18:28.292]  And then a day later, it's so embarrassing to the dinosaur media that even though they ignore it, everyone's seeing live video feeds, they're seeing videos, they're seeing photos, they're seeing Bilderberg security say, yes, we're Bilderberg, you can't come in.
[00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:29.934]  They're seeing people being arrested.
[00:18:29.934 --> 00:18:35.157]  So we show the Emperor's butt naked with Drudge, Report.com, Infowars.com does.
[00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:40.081]  And then it forces the Berlin Wall, the electronic Berlin Wall, to collapse.
[00:18:41.883 --> 00:18:46.747]  Now in huge, huge, huge, huge, huge news.
[00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:50.550]  We're going to cover this when we come back.
[00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.093]  There's a story out of the Washington Times that we have up on Infowars.com.
[00:18:54.093 --> 00:18:56.955]  It's red-linked on drugs on the right-hand side.
[00:18:56.955 --> 00:19:04.161]  Inside the ring, directive outlines Obama's plan to use the military against citizens.
[00:19:04.161 --> 00:19:06.363]  That's right.
[00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:08.725]  And it's a direct link to the memo.
[00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:20.640]  In the article, and it says including drones.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.701]  So there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:24.241]  We're going to go over the document.
[00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:29.443]  We're going to go over the directive for you coming up in the next segment.
[00:19:29.443 --> 00:19:30.323]  It is a big deal.
[00:19:30.323 --> 00:19:33.364]  And I know for you it's old news, but now it's drones.
[00:19:33.364 --> 00:19:37.686]  Remember just a few years ago we were insane to say that drones would even operate, period.
[00:19:38.902 --> 00:19:42.003]  Even though they were already spying on farmers and ranchers.
[00:19:42.003 --> 00:19:47.426]  In local news, we reported on it and they had the national media and AP say that it did not exist.
[00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:50.807]  Just like Obamacare tax doesn't exist.
[00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:52.788]  Just like Hillary and Benghazi don't exist.
[00:19:52.788 --> 00:19:54.769]  Fast and Furious doesn't exist.
[00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:56.870]  Only thing that exists is what our government
[00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.370]  It tells us.
[00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.112]  Do you understand that?
[00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:02.293]  Tired of taking handfuls of vitamin pills?

[00:20:59.335 --> 00:21:02.997]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:06.819]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:13.002]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:20.386]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system.
[00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:23.208]  Which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.103]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:01.103 --> 00:23:06.227]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:06.227 --> 00:23:14.354]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:14.354 --> 00:23:18.879]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:18.879 --> 00:23:22.682]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:22.822 --> 00:23:28.787]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:28.787 --> 00:23:31.949]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:31.949 --> 00:23:37.334]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:45.340]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:24:16.737 --> 00:24:24.962]  Yes, my friends, strange days have found us.
[00:24:24.962 --> 00:24:29.065]  To destroy us.
[00:24:29.065 --> 00:24:36.450]  I don't know if I agree with that statement, that strange days will destroy us.
[00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:44.175]  There's a new article out that if you are a pessimist, you are three times more likely to have dementia,
[00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.393]  And basically get Alzheimer's.
[00:24:49.393 --> 00:25:03.883]  Being a cynic linked to triple risk of developing dementia, Finland's study finds that's in the Financial Times of London and the National Post as well.
[00:25:03.883 --> 00:25:10.688]  And the reason I start this segment with that information before I get into really bad news is I'm not being a pessimist and a defeatist.
[00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:19.775]  I'm admitting the bad in the world because I believe in good men and women standing up against it and changing it and making this a better world.
[00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:21.436]  I'm an optimist.
[00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.997]  People always say, man, you must be paranoid and scared.
[00:25:23.997 --> 00:25:26.239]  No, no, I challenge the corrupt and the evil.
[00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:28.660]  I have courage.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.102]  I don't imagine people are after me.
[00:25:31.102 --> 00:25:37.906]  I know there's always been corrupt elites where they don't even think about other people and they just want total control.
[00:25:37.906 --> 00:25:41.048]  And I'm here saying, no, that's not the way this is going to be.
[00:25:42.657 --> 00:25:45.158]  We're going to admit there's a global elite that are tyrannical.
[00:25:45.158 --> 00:25:51.799]  We're going to admit there's an agenda 21 to shut down our economy and consolidate it in the hands of a few that are exempt from the regulations.
[00:25:51.799 --> 00:26:01.742]  We're going to admit there's a move to militarize police and use the military against the American people and they're deploying armored vehicles and tanks and helicopters and drones and we're going to show the documents.
[00:26:01.742 --> 00:26:05.783]  And we're going to have a public debate about it and we're going to say no to it.
[00:26:05.783 --> 00:26:11.104]  Or even if they try to stage a false flag and use the military against us, the military is going to be so awake
[00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:18.430]  Because we've been targeting them with the truth, openly, that they're not going to go along with the narrative.
[00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.510]  That's called check.
[00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.391]  We're putting the globalists in check.
[00:26:23.391 --> 00:26:25.092]  Then it's their move next.
[00:26:25.092 --> 00:26:27.572]  And here's the article up at Infowars.com.
[00:26:27.572 --> 00:26:38.655]  I've told Adon Salazar, I've told Kurt Nemo, I've told Kit Daniels, I've told all of our writers that are here to cover this from their own angle, but to point to all our research and all of our documents.
[00:26:38.655 --> 00:26:41.076]  Because as good as this Bill Gertz article is, and it's excellent,
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.841]  And it's up at DrudgeReport.com, linked in red.
[00:26:43.841 --> 00:26:48.802]  Department of Defense Directive number 3,225.18, just now declassified, December 29, 2010.
[00:26:48.802 --> 00:26:51.503]  Defense Support for Civil Disturbances.
[00:26:51.503 --> 00:26:51.923]  Directive.
[00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:04.094]  Story's also up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:04.094 --> 00:27:05.314]  We have it mirrored and archived.
[00:27:05.314 --> 00:27:09.736]  In fact, I don't usually take mainstream media or other media's stories whole hog.
[00:27:09.736 --> 00:27:10.476]  I just link to them.
[00:27:10.476 --> 00:27:12.136]  I want the whole article linked.
[00:27:12.136 --> 00:27:15.838]  Bill Gertz's article's so important, I want the whole thing mirrored.
[00:27:15.838 --> 00:27:17.838]  It's fair use, we can put a link to them, they don't care.
[00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:21.740]  I just wanna, we should get Bill Gertz on about this if he wants to come on.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.442]  This is a big deal, and this is everything we've been telling you, because again, I'm gonna say this again, if we have a debate about this,
[00:27:28.496 --> 00:27:38.021]  And then point out, oh by the way, in the manuals, it's not just domestic war they're preparing for and civil unrest, it's with the Tea Party, returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:27:38.021 --> 00:27:40.202]  That's about half the country.
[00:27:40.202 --> 00:27:46.466]  This is treason, it's illegal, and there's a debate about it and the public learns the military is being prepared for war.
[00:27:47.932 --> 00:27:52.113]  And that the military is being prepared that the Tea Party is going to blow up federal buildings everywhere.
[00:27:52.113 --> 00:27:58.015]  Everyone when Obama's handlers blow up a federal building are going to say, who stands to gain from this?
[00:27:58.015 --> 00:28:01.015]  Let's investigate.
[00:28:01.015 --> 00:28:04.736]  See, if there's no debate, they can get away with this.
[00:28:04.736 --> 00:28:13.118]  I hammer this every week because if we don't hammer it, they're going to win.
[00:28:13.118 --> 00:28:15.439]  And by the way, if you don't start hammering it, folks,
[00:28:17.116 --> 00:28:26.762]  If enough people don't start hammering this, you want me to tell you why I'm ready to literally wash Bill Gertz's car if you wanted me to?
[00:28:26.762 --> 00:28:33.567]  If we don't get more reporters covering this, I've studied this, this is the kind of thing they'd kill me over.
[00:28:33.567 --> 00:28:36.949]  Because they know the power of beating a drum.
[00:28:36.949 --> 00:28:39.371]  I do this constantly about the globalists.
[00:28:39.371 --> 00:28:41.352]  There's a global elite, they're tax exempt.
[00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:44.174]  They're the ones wanting your guns and to raise your taxes because they're exempt.
[00:28:44.174 --> 00:28:46.436]  Warren Buffett, here's McClatchy Newspaper, here's AP.
[00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:50.518]  They're training for a military takeover and an implosion.
[00:28:50.518 --> 00:28:55.523]  They'll stage a false flag to blame on us when they do it.
[00:28:55.523 --> 00:29:00.188]  And they're afraid you're going to start going.
[00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:03.511]  Joining me, more fist banging.
[00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:05.013]  We all start pointing our finger at them.
[00:29:07.824 --> 00:29:09.705]  You know like the body snatchers point at humans and hiss?
[00:29:09.705 --> 00:29:10.906]  We should point at them and hiss.
[00:29:10.906 --> 00:29:13.047]  Because they're the people that are destroying humanity.
[00:29:13.047 --> 00:29:15.228]  Turn it back around on these body snatchers.
[00:29:15.228 --> 00:29:18.449]  We need to all point our finger and go, that's the one right there!
[00:29:18.449 --> 00:29:19.830]  They're the ones!
[00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.111]  They want to do all this in the dark?
[00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:22.831]  Ain't gonna happen, bud.
[00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:26.673]  Got your big old blue butt hanging out over the edge.
[00:29:26.673 --> 00:29:27.794]  You New World Order bluebloods.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.641]  So, it's good.
[00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:31.641]  This is getting out there.
[00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:33.622]  I need to become passe.
[00:29:33.622 --> 00:29:34.963]  I need to become overrated.
[00:29:34.963 --> 00:29:36.904]  I need to get off the vanguard.
[00:29:36.904 --> 00:29:37.944]  Get off the tip of the spear.
[00:29:37.944 --> 00:29:42.626]  I mean, I have a duty to do it, but let me tell you, I can feel the danger.
[00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:45.047]  So, please, join me at the tip of the spear.
[00:29:45.047 --> 00:29:46.188]  Please.
[00:29:46.188 --> 00:29:46.608]  Please.
[00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:47.949]  I'm selfish.
[00:29:47.949 --> 00:29:49.430]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:50.830]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.351]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:56.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:03.349]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:09.455]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[00:30:09.455 --> 00:30:13.980]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:20.548]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[00:30:20.848 --> 00:30:22.869]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[00:30:22.869 --> 00:30:34.532]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:36.552]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[00:30:36.552 --> 00:30:38.933]  When he brought me home, the bottle's super female.
[00:30:38.933 --> 00:30:42.274]  I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:44.094]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[00:30:44.094 --> 00:30:45.895]  Our relationship, all I can say is, it's a lot better now.
[00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:50.598]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:04.729]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:13.572]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:15.513]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:31:15.513 --> 00:31:17.153]  We are what we eat.
[00:31:17.153 --> 00:31:21.815]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:31:21.815 --> 00:31:26.016]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:31:26.016 --> 00:31:28.597]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:31:28.597 --> 00:31:34.499]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:37.780]  To learn more visit InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:44.843]  The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to Big Pharma.
[00:31:44.843 --> 00:31:50.605]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired and obese.

[00:31:59.992 --> 00:32:07.157]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:07.157 --> 00:32:09.499]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:09.499 --> 00:32:14.803]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:14.803 --> 00:32:19.727]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:19.947 --> 00:32:23.270]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.354]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:27.354 --> 00:32:31.679]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:41.908]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:41.908 --> 00:32:44.431]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:32:44.611 --> 00:32:52.824]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:32:52.824 --> 00:32:56.791]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:10.052 --> 00:33:16.655]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling, and believes all this, and really thinks you're a hero!
[00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:17.295]  G.I.
[00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:19.596]  Joe, Great America Hero!
[00:33:19.596 --> 00:33:20.056]  Joe!
[00:33:20.056 --> 00:33:20.797]  Joe!
[00:33:20.797 --> 00:33:22.217]  You don't work for Joe!
[00:33:22.217 --> 00:33:24.278]  Joe got taken over!
[00:33:24.278 --> 00:33:24.838]  The G.I.
[00:33:24.838 --> 00:33:28.220]  Joe command base is run by Cobra!
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.440]  You understand that?
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.623]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you, because that's your main programming template in North America.
[00:33:34.623 --> 00:33:35.983]  They're on record with that!
[00:33:35.983 --> 00:33:37.444]  That was all Pentagon directed!
[00:33:38.044 --> 00:33:39.886]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[00:33:39.886 --> 00:33:41.347]  You dress like Cobra.
[00:33:41.347 --> 00:33:43.049]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[00:33:43.049 --> 00:33:44.310]  You are Cobra.
[00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.232]  Hail Cobra!
[00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:47.993]  You wanna be little boys?
[00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:50.235]  Or you wanna really join the Republic?
[00:33:50.235 --> 00:33:55.360]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.581]  That's a bunch of bullsh**.
[00:33:56.581 --> 00:33:58.002]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:00.865]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[00:34:00.865 --> 00:34:02.587]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:11.192]  When I went through the process of becoming Press Secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:34:11.192 --> 00:34:14.134]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:34:14.134 --> 00:34:15.756]  It's run by chaos!
[00:34:15.756 --> 00:34:17.657]  It's run by Spectre!
[00:34:17.657 --> 00:34:22.220]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge Extortion.
[00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:24.136]  They run little kids.
[00:34:24.136 --> 00:34:25.378]  They run the snuff films.
[00:34:25.378 --> 00:34:26.178]  They run the drugs.
[00:34:26.178 --> 00:34:26.919]  They run it all.
[00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:31.945]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:38.211]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.334]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[00:34:40.814 --> 00:34:43.395]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:45.335]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:51.477]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[00:34:51.477 --> 00:34:52.777]  You work for Chaos.
[00:34:52.777 --> 00:34:57.858]  You work for Cobra.
[00:34:57.858 --> 00:34:58.879]  How do they get power?
[00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:03.280]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[00:35:07.622 --> 00:35:08.863]  Go f*** yourself.
[00:35:08.863 --> 00:35:09.644]  Who is COBRA?
[00:35:09.644 --> 00:35:13.468]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[00:35:13.468 --> 00:35:17.993]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[00:35:17.993 --> 00:35:20.755]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[00:35:20.755 --> 00:35:22.317]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[00:35:22.317 --> 00:35:24.139]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:25.540]  COBRA runs it all.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.022]  COBRA is real.
[00:35:27.022 --> 00:35:28.543]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:35:29.821 --> 00:35:37.927]  Cobra is in control of America, and Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:42.770]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.792]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:35:45.792 --> 00:35:47.433]  That's what Cobra would say.
[00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:49.174]  That's what Specter would say.
[00:35:49.174 --> 00:35:52.957]  That's what Goldfinger would say, because that's who those people are.
[00:35:53.637 --> 00:35:58.279]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:35:58.279 --> 00:36:03.261]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:07.863]  You will kneel before Cobra of faith and might!
[00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.851]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:36:13.851 --> 00:36:16.392]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:36:16.392 --> 00:36:19.412]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[00:36:19.412 --> 00:36:21.653]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:36:21.653 --> 00:36:28.515]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:36:28.515 --> 00:36:31.455]  I am Cobra Leader!
[00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:34.356]  Cobra Commander to you, Jones!
[00:36:34.356 --> 00:36:37.317]  Alright, who's doing the voice of Cobra Commander?
[00:36:37.317 --> 00:36:38.317]  He's really good!
[00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.131]  Cobra!
[00:36:42.131 --> 00:36:49.233]  I have friends of people that have actually seen those videos and they go, there's no way that's really you and I do Cobra for them and they just can't believe it.
[00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:52.374]  What does that say that I can actually, maybe I am Cobra?
[00:36:52.374 --> 00:36:53.655]  No, I don't think so.
[00:36:53.655 --> 00:36:59.397]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday edition.
[00:36:59.397 --> 00:37:03.418]  We have David Knight about to join us with live video feeds from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:37:03.418 --> 00:37:05.479]  We've blown Bilderberg 2014 wide open yet again.
[00:37:09.844 --> 00:37:13.486]  Now they're like, big deal, big deal having Bilderberg covered.
[00:37:13.486 --> 00:37:16.068]  Yeah, we kind of run things.
[00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:18.650]  Global government, I mean, we always admitted that.
[00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.252]  Move along, nothing to see here.
[00:37:21.252 --> 00:37:29.797]  After they tried to move heaven and earth to not have a debate about this.
[00:37:29.797 --> 00:37:33.340]  Now, I want to go back to this article and then to David Knight.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.702]  This is such a big deal by Bill Gertz.
[00:37:36.702 --> 00:37:37.923]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:50.519]  In fact, I want to post the PDF on Infowars.com under the Bill Gertz article with screenshots, and as I said, post the whole Bill Gertz article from WashingtonTimes.com on Infowars.com.
[00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:59.086]  It's that important to mirror this document that they receive and have confirmed as the Department of Defense.
[00:37:59.086 --> 00:37:59.466]  Number 3025.18.
[00:38:04.835 --> 00:38:09.878]  And it's been updated in September of 2012, now released.
[00:38:09.878 --> 00:38:10.719]  And here's the article.
[00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:17.963]  Inside the ring, directive outlines Obama's plan to use military against citizens.
[00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:19.144]  And they've got NORTHCOM.
[00:38:19.144 --> 00:38:20.985]  They're training for it constantly.
[00:38:20.985 --> 00:38:24.807]  It's in the training manual separately that we freak out about that they train.
[00:38:24.807 --> 00:38:26.188]  That's even in Forbes magazine.
[00:38:26.188 --> 00:38:28.089]  It's even in AP.
[00:38:28.089 --> 00:38:29.310]  For who?
[00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.171]  The Tea Party.
[00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:34.113]  The military doesn't train for the Russians or the Chinese.
[00:38:34.113 --> 00:38:36.515]  They train domestically.
[00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:44.179]  When they were building it, they claimed for Al-Qaeda, who the globalists publicly run and protect.
[00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:47.341]  And now they're segwaying going, you know what?
[00:38:47.341 --> 00:38:51.004]  It's actually for gun owners and veterans.
[00:38:51.004 --> 00:38:51.324]  Yep.
[00:38:53.544 --> 00:39:07.033]  The troubling aspect of the directive, reading from Bill Gertz's article, outlines presidential authority for the use of military arms and forces, including unarmed drones, in operations against domestic unrest.
[00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:09.214]  This appears to be the latest step.
[00:39:09.214 --> 00:39:10.775]  It doesn't appear it is.
[00:39:10.775 --> 00:39:12.056]  See, reporters want to be objective.
[00:39:12.056 --> 00:39:17.099]  It'd be like if, you know, if Obama is eating a T-bone steak, he's eating a T-bone steak.
[00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:20.362]  If the federal government, you know, is picking their nose, they're picking their nose.
[00:39:20.362 --> 00:39:21.442]  I mean, when they're doing this, they're doing it.
[00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:22.063]  Let's go back to the article.
[00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:23.725]  Thank you.
[00:39:23.725 --> 00:39:33.793]  This appears to be the latest step in the administration's decision to use force within the United States against its citizens, so the defense official opposed the directive.
[00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:37.876]  Speaking to Bill Gertz.
[00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:49.325]  And it goes in to say that they will use to quell civil disturbances drones under the emergency authority, military forces, armored vehicles, the full weight and power of the Department of Defense.
[00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:57.007]  Folks, this was going on under Clinton and continued under Bush, but was more covert.
[00:39:57.007 --> 00:40:00.969]  I mean, I made three films when Clinton was in office.
[00:40:00.969 --> 00:40:07.192]  Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, once Bush was in.
[00:40:07.192 --> 00:40:13.735]  And I made Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, in 2009.
[00:40:13.735 --> 00:40:16.036]  The Rise of FEMA.
[00:40:16.036 --> 00:40:20.758]  And you know, you go see Godzilla, and FEMA's the savior saving the children.
[00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:36.417]  But in the real world, boys and girls, FEMA's taking over all the land of this country, and getting ready to force relocate people, and will be over NORTHCOM and the Department of Rural Affairs that is publicly a Pentagon operation.
[00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:44.020]  Now you go look up Obama's executive order, it's to reorganize farming in this country under executive action.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.121]  And moots on the ground.
[00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:50.062]  And is deploying plainclothes military into every small town in America.
[00:40:53.393 --> 00:41:03.198]  And of course, you remember last year they quote passed a law saying we can now have the military involved domestically in PSYOPs lying to you.
[00:41:03.198 --> 00:41:07.581]  And then the first PSYOP was to have earlier this year the Undersecretary of Defense.
[00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:09.262]  He gave a press conference.
[00:41:09.262 --> 00:41:10.082]  We wrote an article about it.
[00:41:10.082 --> 00:41:11.043]  It was the cover of the magazine.
[00:41:11.043 --> 00:41:16.266]  And he came out and said because of Drudge Report we can no longer lie.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.543]  Grudge Report and other new media, we have to start telling the truth.
[00:41:20.543 --> 00:41:27.688]  And in the interest of telling the truth, we're now going to come into your towns and cities and work with all new media.
[00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:28.929]  And that means pay them money.
[00:41:28.929 --> 00:41:35.354]  In some cases, small local blogs will get $200,000 or more to sell out, and you're going to see a lot of that suddenly.
[00:41:35.354 --> 00:41:41.278]  People are going to take their 30 pieces of silver, and they're all going to attack you-know-who.
[00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:44.981]  The big lesson in the test is they'll attack Infowars, they'll attack WorldNetDaily, they'll attack Grudge.
[00:41:46.124 --> 00:41:50.586]  And, um, it's Cass Sunstein cognitive infiltration stuff.
[00:41:50.586 --> 00:41:52.067]  And we've already seen it really heat up.
[00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:56.029]  And most of them don't even hide the fact they're FBI operatives, informants, and others.
[00:41:56.029 --> 00:41:56.709]  There's the headline.
[00:41:56.709 --> 00:41:59.771]  Government promises to stop lying because of Drudge Report.
[00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:04.353]  Shows the power of real media in breaking through the electronic Berlin Wall.
[00:42:04.353 --> 00:42:05.194]  Adon Salazar.
[00:42:06.098 --> 00:42:08.099]  Alex Jones wrote that article.
[00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:25.924]  But then we go in later in the article, admit though that overall you got like 400 plus shy-op officers in the room, civilian and military, looking so depressed, shaking their heads, freaking out, crying in the press conference, asking questions.
[00:42:25.924 --> 00:42:28.865]  Like the woman goes, I'm tired of lying, no one likes me.
[00:42:28.865 --> 00:42:32.066]  And everybody's shaking their head going, honey, you don't get it.
[00:42:32.066 --> 00:42:35.847]  We're announcing we're not going to lie because we're getting ready to really lie.
[00:42:39.977 --> 00:42:41.118]  The PSYOP's on them.
[00:42:41.118 --> 00:42:44.161]  That's why, you gotta watch the hour-long press conference.
[00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:47.684]  People are shaking their heads, they're freaking out, throwing their pencils down.
[00:42:47.684 --> 00:42:50.426]  I mean, this is such treason you're seeing.
[00:42:50.426 --> 00:42:52.388]  But they're saying we come in peace.
[00:42:52.388 --> 00:42:56.431]  Oh, we're gonna go out now and not lie anymore, we're just gonna operate domestically.
[00:42:56.431 --> 00:43:04.778]  Well, the room full of people at the Pentagon knows they've been operating domestically, up one side and down the other.
[00:43:04.778 --> 00:43:05.259]  I was on 590...
[00:43:07.834 --> 00:43:27.398]  FM one morning for like two hours as a guest, and as I was walking out, I saw this fellow walk in to promote an anti-gun agenda, and I noticed how he was talking in the coffee room on his cell phone in his bearing, and I looked at him and I said, you're not just with a Bloomberg group, I said, you're an army officer, aren't you?
[00:43:27.398 --> 00:43:30.238]  I could just tell he was a Special Forces guy.
[00:43:30.238 --> 00:43:32.959]  And he looked evil, and he goes, Alex Jones.
[00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:38.415]  He's had this arrogant, you know, they feel so good because they're with the system.
[00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:41.478]  He just laughed at me in the coffee room.
[00:43:41.478 --> 00:43:45.823]  And he goes, yeah, I'm with the military.
[00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.085]  And I go, you're running a PSYOP.
[00:43:47.085 --> 00:43:49.607]  And I guess he didn't think I was recording because I wasn't.
[00:43:49.607 --> 00:43:50.989]  He just arrogantly went, yeah, we are.
[00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:52.070]  You can't stop us.
[00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.271]  And shoved past me.
[00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:54.413]  I went in the radio room.
[00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:59.747]  Before they went live, I said, this guy admits he's a PSYOP.
[00:43:59.747 --> 00:44:01.828]  And I gotta be honest, I was starting to ball up a little bit.
[00:44:01.828 --> 00:44:06.211]  I mean, I was really... What he was doing was illegal at that time.
[00:44:06.211 --> 00:44:09.312]  I don't care if they pass some law saying it's illegal, it's illegal.
[00:44:09.312 --> 00:44:11.013]  But man, here was U.S.
[00:44:11.013 --> 00:44:15.976]  Army engaged in a PSYOP against my guns.
[00:44:15.976 --> 00:44:22.220]  I mean, I just... I mean, I just really got in my craw.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.660]  I'm getting angry right now.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.941]  I'm getting chills just remembering that.
[00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:31.824]  Because now they're operating all over the place, and folks, they're coming after everything.
[00:44:31.824 --> 00:44:32.404]  And here's the deal.
[00:44:32.404 --> 00:44:34.225]  Most military people are great folks.
[00:44:34.225 --> 00:44:36.406]  That's why the military is waking up across the board over 80%.
[00:44:36.406 --> 00:44:40.588]  But I talked to her, fully awake now, because of this attempt to take over.
[00:44:40.588 --> 00:44:41.768]  The system doesn't care.
[00:44:41.768 --> 00:44:45.150]  They'll take the 10, 15%, 20% that will go along with it.
[00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.331]  They're going to promote them.
[00:44:47.331 --> 00:44:49.852]  And these people see us as the enemy, and they're coming.
[00:44:50.626 --> 00:44:51.427]  They're coming!
[00:44:51.427 --> 00:44:59.552]  And here's the Washington Times with the document that says they are prepared with the drones and everything else for war with us.
[00:44:59.552 --> 00:45:05.615]  But then what Bill Gertz won't do, because he's such a journalist, is it's already so alarmist they water down the article.
[00:45:05.615 --> 00:45:06.536]  And I get why they do that.
[00:45:06.536 --> 00:45:07.136]  That's what they do.
[00:45:07.136 --> 00:45:12.199]  I do the opposite.
[00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:12.960]  They go on.
[00:45:18.317 --> 00:45:22.040]  And, you know, basically break down the whole attack plan against us in the article.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:32.829]  What we do is we take this and then show all the old articles where it's for the Tea Party, gun owners, everybody, and point out, hey, by the way, it isn't just for domestic dissent against the general American people.
[00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:36.513]  It's specifically against folks that follow the Constitution and civil rights.
[00:45:37.403 --> 00:45:37.964]  We're the enemy.
[00:45:37.964 --> 00:45:42.208]  Because this is a foreign, illegal occupation, like the Vichy French under Hitler.
[00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:43.729]  This is real.
[00:45:43.729 --> 00:45:44.911]  This is real.
[00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:47.413]  And the Pentagon is speaking out.
[00:45:47.413 --> 00:45:53.019]  There are good people in there, guaranteed, knowing they're being spied on, and are warning Mill Gertz about it.
[00:45:53.914 --> 00:46:09.714]  So, if you're in the military, if you're in the FBI, the Secret Service, if you're in the system, I don't care what it is, you better stand up for America right now and speak out publicly or internally about this because there's a civil war going on right now by the globalists politically to take this country over.
[00:46:10.663 --> 00:46:12.704]  We've got to expose this is going on.
[00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:16.725]  We've got to expose the globalists that they are meeting in secret illegally in Copenhagen.
[00:46:16.725 --> 00:46:20.025]  We've got to admit the conspiracy theorists were right.
[00:46:20.025 --> 00:46:22.566]  We've all got to admit we're in trouble.
[00:46:22.566 --> 00:46:24.626]  And that even though it's incredible, it's happening.
[00:46:24.626 --> 00:46:25.847]  History is incredible.
[00:46:25.847 --> 00:46:27.227]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:46:27.227 --> 00:46:28.207]  And this is happening now.
[00:46:28.207 --> 00:46:29.928]  And this is an epic time to be alive.
[00:46:29.928 --> 00:46:34.309]  And it's an honor to be alive right now, being able to speak out against this and expose it.
[00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:39.171]  Now, David Knight Jones has been there for over a day now in Copenhagen, Denmark, covering Bilderberg.
[00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:43.854]  A lot has happened, and he's there to break it down with us a little bit in the next hour.
[00:46:43.854 --> 00:46:49.376]  Then Paul Watson's going to join us, and we're going to have open phones the entire second half of the transmission.
[00:46:49.376 --> 00:46:58.461]  I know you guys are also getting a lot of national, international TV coverage of what you're doing, so very effective, only 24 hours into coverage.
[00:46:58.461 --> 00:46:59.681]  Great job, David Knight.
[00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:01.743]  Give us your report.
[00:47:01.743 --> 00:47:04.464]  Well, Alex, I'm here kind of in a news box.
[00:47:06.994 --> 00:47:07.695]  You gotta love it.
[00:47:07.695 --> 00:47:08.517]  There goes his Skype.
[00:47:08.517 --> 00:47:09.920]  Well, I mean, we see what's going on here.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.323]  Bilderberg, I'm not aware of what's going on.
[00:47:11.323 --> 00:47:13.607]  I'm listening to you talking about this Bill Gertrude.
[00:47:13.607 --> 00:47:14.429]  Did it just go out?
[00:47:14.429 --> 00:47:15.010]  Can you see me now?
[00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:15.571]  No, you're good now.
[00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:15.792]  Go ahead.
[00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:17.134]  There's just a little... there's a delay.
[00:47:18.154 --> 00:47:22.397]  I was just saying, I'm not able to get on the internet here.
[00:47:22.397 --> 00:47:24.379]  We have so little connection here.
[00:47:24.379 --> 00:47:27.041]  So I was just listening to what you were saying about Bill Gertz.
[00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:30.664]  You know, people need to understand that we're coming to a real crossroads.
[00:47:30.664 --> 00:47:36.929]  They've been talking about all this stuff coming down in the time frame of 2020 to 2025.
[00:47:36.929 --> 00:47:40.852]  And they're laying the legal framework for this, they believe.
[00:47:40.852 --> 00:47:44.535]  As well as, as we've pointed out over and over again, they're training for it.
[00:47:44.535 --> 00:47:45.396]  Really hard.
[00:47:45.396 --> 00:47:46.297]  And preparing for it.
[00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:47.298]  And buying the ammunition.
[00:47:48.078 --> 00:47:51.981]  You know, it's just like that book, The Fourth Turning, by Strauss and Howe.
[00:47:51.981 --> 00:47:57.785]  They point out that although history doesn't repeat itself, it certainly does rhyme, and there's a rhythm to that rhyme.
[00:47:57.785 --> 00:47:59.946]  And we see that this is building up.
[00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:09.032]  Here at Bilderberg, the topics that they're going to be talking about are going to include the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the same thing for the Trans-Atlantic Partnership,
[00:48:09.918 --> 00:48:19.065]  They're going to start putting together the pieces of trade agreements that the Trilateral Commission has essentially been talking about doing since 1973.
[00:48:19.065 --> 00:48:29.794]  They came with the Trilateral Commission, what they did was they joined Europe, North America, and Asia, and now we see the elements, we see the actual elements that they were planning with Bilderberg.
[00:48:30.394 --> 00:48:41.382]  But, to get you up to date on what's happening here, if you turn around here, Josh, you can see they've expanded the barriers, the barricades, quite a bit since we were here last night.
[00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:45.044]  I heard Josh got assaulted, and then we have video that's about to be uploaded to that.
[00:48:45.044 --> 00:48:46.205]  We can show that in a moment.
[00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:52.865]  For the most part, the police have been extremely cordial, um, even lifting up lines for us.
[00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:57.470]  And, you know, they'll be very nice, but boy, if you cross them, they will come down on you just like any cops.
[00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:02.555]  Now, Josh was just preparing to come to this, uh, shoot, and he had the camera in his hand.
[00:49:03.175 --> 00:49:06.237]  And somebody called the police in our hotel.
[00:49:06.237 --> 00:49:09.140]  He was walking out of our hotel with a camera in his hand.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:18.226]  They called the police and Karen was filming somewhere else and she saw the police running and she didn't know they were coming for Josh and she saw them cornering Josh.
[00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:21.629]  I should let you talk to Josh and let him tell you what happened.
[00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:24.030]  Josh, why don't you tell them what happened in your own words here?
[00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.052]  Because I was filming people arriving.
[00:49:28.769 --> 00:49:46.684]  Yeah, so I was leaving the hotel and I had my camera, which I've had all day long, and the cops run up to me and say they need my ID, they need me to prove that I'm staying in the hotel because someone called the police on me because... I'm not really sure why.
[00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:48.806]  I guess because now cameras are scary.
[00:49:50.241 --> 00:49:55.682]  They're only allowed to spy on us and take all our liberties, but we can't be journalists in a major capital city.
[00:49:55.682 --> 00:50:02.164]  Please continue, though, with what they did to you, because we just showed some video of them roughing somebody else up.
[00:50:02.164 --> 00:50:07.085]  Yeah, the videos are going to be up soon, but they stopped me not far from here.
[00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:12.347]  I was coming to do this broadcast, and they detained me.
[00:50:12.347 --> 00:50:13.187]  They wouldn't let me leave.
[00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:24.181]  And I asked them, didn't they think it was more important to maybe cover what these guys are doing in this building than to detain someone who's simply walking with a camera?
[00:50:24.181 --> 00:50:27.183]  Which I've been doing all day and haven't done anything wrong.
[00:50:27.183 --> 00:50:29.665]  And they couldn't answer, obviously.
[00:50:29.665 --> 00:50:37.650]  And just earlier, separately, there was a guy right behind where we are now, this video's coming up too, who was being patted down, groped, and harassed by police.
[00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:45.533]  Because he was standing, looking at the building, and looking at all of these, um, the blockades, everything blocked off.
[00:50:45.533 --> 00:50:53.295]  Wow, what a free country, what a free society, where you look in a capital city at a major hotel with barriers being put up.
[00:50:53.295 --> 00:50:54.776]  You don't do that, slave.
[00:50:54.776 --> 00:50:56.016]  This is North Korea.
[00:50:56.016 --> 00:50:58.317]  I mean, Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:50:58.317 --> 00:50:59.478]  How dare you?
[00:50:59.478 --> 00:51:00.258]  We'll be right back.

[00:54:20.504 --> 00:54:29.410]  Imagine world leaders meeting in secret in the middle of a major city and reporters want to cover it and walk out of their own hotel with a camera.
[00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:30.491]  Why?
[00:54:30.491 --> 00:54:33.133]  Rough somebody up, call the police immediately.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:41.643]  Oh my gosh, if people want to stand across the street and stare at the world leaders arriving, let's arrest them, let's beat them up.
[00:54:41.643 --> 00:54:49.127]  And this is the same thing if it's in the US, if it's in England, if it's in Spain, if it's in Greece, this goes on.
[00:54:49.127 --> 00:54:51.688]  But then there's always a public backlash and the police back off.
[00:54:53.342 --> 00:54:57.024]  I gotta say, the police did not act like this any in England last year.
[00:54:57.024 --> 00:54:59.585]  I'd seen it in videos for more than a decade ago.
[00:54:59.585 --> 00:55:05.968]  So it's important to go out and cover this to show they're acting like this to keep societies free.
[00:55:05.968 --> 00:55:12.571]  But really out of control to see this type of behavior going on.
[00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:16.693]  Meanwhile, the globalists are working as hard as they can to destroy those police officers' lives, but they don't care.
[00:55:16.693 --> 00:55:20.795]  They've been chosen because they will attack the people.
[00:55:20.795 --> 00:55:22.496]  Josh, finishing up the points you were making.
[00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:27.882]  Right, so this actually just happened.
[00:55:27.882 --> 00:55:36.006]  We were scrambling to make sure that we got on because they were detaining me and not letting me leave.
[00:55:36.006 --> 00:55:40.868]  And right before that, I just said there was a guy right behind us here.
[00:55:40.868 --> 00:55:45.331]  He was standing there looking at the barricades and the cops came up, made him take his shoes off.
[00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:51.170]  Patted him down because apparently he was a threat for looking at these barricades.
[00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:55.491]  And I want to be clear, you're in the free speech zone right now, it looks like.
[00:55:55.491 --> 00:55:57.332]  Or off to the side of the hotel.
[00:55:57.332 --> 00:56:00.673]  So if you're just there on a city street, you're evil.
[00:56:00.673 --> 00:56:02.733]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:02.733 --> 00:56:05.434]  And then before that, another video that's being uploaded right now.
[00:56:06.346 --> 00:56:10.608]  Right behind David, right in front of the hotel, there was a guy filming.
[00:56:10.608 --> 00:56:16.550]  Cops came up, told him to give him, give them his ID and to turn around and leave.
[00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:17.530]  And he refused to do it.
[00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:20.392]  So they grabbed him and they roughed him up.
[00:56:20.392 --> 00:56:31.496]  They drug him across the street, across traffic and took him behind a screen where the elite are going into their hotel rooms.
[00:56:31.496 --> 00:56:34.337]  They took him behind a screen and it looked like they were beating him.
[00:56:35.902 --> 00:56:37.724]  Really?
[00:56:37.724 --> 00:56:38.104]  Yeah.
[00:56:38.104 --> 00:56:42.368]  Well, I'll tell you what, Josh, that's a bunch of security over there at that picnic table, isn't it?
[00:56:42.368 --> 00:56:53.919]  Maybe after the break comes, we should go over and try to interview them in North Korea, formerly Denmark, now under Nazi control, or Soviet-style oppressive control, authoritarian control.
[00:56:53.919 --> 00:56:58.943]  I mean, if you guys want, you want to go talk to the gods, or maybe they'll beat you.
[00:56:58.943 --> 00:57:00.505]  What do you want to do?
[00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.392]  Yeah, sure, let's do it.
[00:57:02.392 --> 00:57:04.653]  We're actually surrounded by police right now.
[00:57:04.653 --> 00:57:09.015]  Police are outnumbering people here, so I feel safe.
[00:57:09.015 --> 00:57:09.716]  You feel safe?
[00:57:09.716 --> 00:57:11.297]  Well, don't worry.
[00:57:11.297 --> 00:57:16.600]  Maybe they just brought that person behind the screens of Henry Kissinger to do a proctology exam.
[00:57:18.686 --> 00:57:19.827]  More than likely.
[00:57:19.827 --> 00:57:20.328]  I hope so.
[00:57:20.328 --> 00:57:27.416]  Well you know that's what the TSA is for, is to condition us to be slaves, to treat us that we have no rights, that we have no dignity.
[00:57:27.416 --> 00:57:29.458]  It's prisoner induction training.
[00:57:29.458 --> 00:57:33.983]  So what did the police, are they local Copenhagen police?
[00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.545]  What did they say to you while they were talking to you?
[00:57:37.014 --> 00:57:38.835]  Well, I asked if I could leave.
[00:57:38.835 --> 00:57:39.955]  They said no.
[00:57:39.955 --> 00:57:43.757]  They said that they needed my ID and my room key.
[00:57:43.757 --> 00:57:48.158]  And I refused to give it to them, and they said they were not going to let me go unless I gave it to them.
[00:57:48.158 --> 00:57:53.340]  So just for time's sake, because we were rushing over here to get on the air, I said, fine, I'll give you it, but I need to leave.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.961]  So I gave them my ID.
[00:57:54.961 --> 00:57:57.862]  I gave them my room key, which didn't have my number on it.
[00:57:57.862 --> 00:58:00.263]  By the way, we're showing the footage of them beating the guy right now.
[00:58:01.601 --> 00:58:06.005]  Hey, they ought to put up police screens everywhere where they can taser beat and kill you.
[00:58:06.005 --> 00:58:07.807]  We can call them murder rooms.
[00:58:07.807 --> 00:58:13.212]  Well, no, actually, loving trendy rooms.
[00:58:13.212 --> 00:58:14.793]  And then they can even have a guillotine in them.
[00:58:14.793 --> 00:58:15.314]  You know what I mean?
[00:58:15.314 --> 00:58:17.996]  Total genius.
[00:58:17.996 --> 00:58:19.458]  Oh, yeah, you can see it in the footage.
[00:58:19.458 --> 00:58:20.078]  They're beating him.
[00:58:20.078 --> 00:58:20.739]  Oh, yeah, they are.
[00:58:20.739 --> 00:58:22.140]  Oh, stomping him.
[00:58:25.074 --> 00:58:30.736]  Oh, so we have footage of the police beating people in torture rooms and trying to chase a reporter.
[00:58:30.736 --> 00:58:33.077]  That is sensational headline right there.
[00:58:33.077 --> 00:58:34.557]  That is sensational.
[00:58:34.557 --> 00:58:37.678]  A guy catches the beating and the police try to get him.
[00:58:37.678 --> 00:58:39.839]  Whoa, stay there folks, we're coming back.
[00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:41.099]  Unbelievable tyranny.

[01:00:09.894 --> 01:00:11.475]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.016]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.016 --> 01:00:17.219]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.219 --> 01:00:21.322]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.871 --> 01:00:36.036]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is sensationally disgusting and makes me physically ill.
[01:00:36.036 --> 01:00:37.858]  We're trying to be nice to the police.
[01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:41.341]  We're saying, overall, they're being nice.
[01:00:41.341 --> 01:00:48.788]  And then suddenly, they start grabbing at our reporters, going after them, trying to take their cameras, and we catch on tape.
[01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:53.871]  Them dragging a reporter with a camera behind a screen.
[01:00:53.871 --> 01:00:57.012]  You can clearly see them punching and stomping him.
[01:00:57.012 --> 01:00:59.073]  Full power.
[01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:02.654]  I mean, they are stomping the daylights out of him.
[01:01:02.654 --> 01:01:11.436]  And then, another reporter is getting footage of it, so the police try to chase him down to take him to the torture dungeon.
[01:01:11.436 --> 01:01:14.737]  I mean, this is literally, I don't even know the headline that's strong enough.
[01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.058]  Like, police take journalist,
[01:01:18.885 --> 01:01:21.166]  To secluded pens to be beaten?
[01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:28.629]  I mean, this is just, this is a major human rights scandal.
[01:01:28.629 --> 01:01:36.173]  That they got free speech pens, blacked out windows, blacked out fences, so people can't see through them.
[01:01:36.173 --> 01:01:42.155]  But there is a good eight inch gap and you can clearly see they've thrown him on the ground and they're stomping on him.
[01:01:42.155 --> 01:01:45.257]  And they take him there to torture him.
[01:01:45.257 --> 01:01:47.578]  And folks, if they get away with this precedent, it's over.
[01:01:49.065 --> 01:01:50.026]  See what Secrecy's for?
[01:01:50.026 --> 01:01:52.709]  So they can commit their crimes in the dark.
[01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.171]  Look at them stomping him.
[01:01:54.171 --> 01:01:58.976]  A full power stomping, full power hitting, and then chasing a reporter.
[01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:03.061]  If you're a radio listener, the feed's at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:02:03.061 --> 01:02:04.603]  Unbelievable!
[01:02:04.603 --> 01:02:09.068]  Josh, I guess you shot this footage, Josh Owens, Infowars.com cameraman.
[01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:12.310]  I mean, I tell you, you've only been here six months or so.
[01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:13.831]  You've already seen a lot, my friend.
[01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:19.953]  The NSA, you saw the Feds stand down with their guns pointed at you, threatening to shoot you at the Bundy Ranch.
[01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:20.734]  You were there.
[01:02:20.734 --> 01:02:22.114]  And now this.
[01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:25.495]  And you're on the front lines, my friend.
[01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:31.438]  Yeah, well, the difference here is that, well, the difference that I've noticed with the police specifically is that
[01:02:32.145 --> 01:02:35.948]  You almost get a feeling that they're just cowards.
[01:02:35.948 --> 01:02:45.715]  I mean, I'm kind of surprised that they were beating the guy in front of the hotel because they seem like wimps.
[01:02:45.715 --> 01:02:49.577]  Well, who do you think wants to beat people?
[01:02:49.577 --> 01:02:50.638]  Well, that's true, yeah.
[01:02:50.638 --> 01:02:54.641]  The small guy in high school who gets picked on goes on to be a cop who beats people up for fun.
[01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:02.724]  Well, all I know is, in bad police departments, it's either like that or the other way around.
[01:03:02.724 --> 01:03:05.847]  I mean, somebody who's tough just doesn't go around beating people up for no reason.
[01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:10.152]  Let's continue to talk about, I mean, what did you think when you were watching them?
[01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:11.854]  Clearly, it looks unmistakable.
[01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.937]  They're stomping him and hitting him.
[01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:17.441]  So I guess, you know, that keyhole didn't get closed there, Josh.
[01:03:19.124 --> 01:03:34.004]  Yeah, well it was shocking but you can see in the video there's another reporter who runs across the street to film it and they run after him and chase him and chase him across the street so he isn't filming them do it but I guess they didn't notice us standing right beside them beating him.
[01:03:34.464 --> 01:03:36.785]  He went around the corner to shoot around the fence.
[01:03:36.785 --> 01:03:41.328]  You gotta get with that reporter, that citizen journalist, and get his footage.
[01:03:41.328 --> 01:03:48.691]  I guarantee you, they're gonna try to deny they were attacking him, and I guarantee you, they've got the video, he's got the goods.
[01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:49.452]  Where is that guy?
[01:03:49.452 --> 01:03:50.732]  We need to interview him right now.
[01:03:50.732 --> 01:03:51.953]  Do you see that guy in the black jacket?
[01:03:55.302 --> 01:03:57.884]  Uh, no, but I'm sure he's over in the free speech zone.
[01:03:57.884 --> 01:04:01.108]  Listen, go to the free speech zone, try to find him in the next segment.
[01:04:01.108 --> 01:04:04.072]  Start going now, keep going live in case something happens.
[01:04:04.072 --> 01:04:06.294]  Then I want to go back and I want to talk to the police.
[01:04:06.294 --> 01:04:15.204]  I want you to go to the line and say, we want to talk to your boss about the civil rights violation that we just saw.
[01:04:16.598 --> 01:04:17.538]  Okay.
[01:04:17.538 --> 01:04:19.979]  But listen, you don't have to follow that directive.
[01:04:19.979 --> 01:04:21.540]  They may physically attack you.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.780]  But I know you're not a coward.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.961]  You and David aren't.
[01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:26.602]  So, you want to take that mission?
[01:04:26.602 --> 01:04:27.522]  Yeah, sure.
[01:04:27.522 --> 01:04:28.102]  Alright.
[01:04:28.102 --> 01:04:29.362]  Go get the witness first.
[01:04:29.362 --> 01:04:31.363]  We'll get that streamed.
[01:04:31.363 --> 01:04:32.804]  The evidence of the crime first.
[01:04:32.804 --> 01:04:35.164]  He can even hold his camera up and we can film that on air.
[01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:36.665]  We'll get the evidence of the crime out.
[01:04:37.728 --> 01:04:44.011]  Then you go to the criminal force and you say, we saw you take that person to your gulag.
[01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:45.152]  Where are they?
[01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:46.213]  Have you hurt them?
[01:04:46.213 --> 01:04:54.197]  Because this is a kidnapping force for child trafficking, murdering drug dealers that are Bilderberg, literal murderers of the earth.
[01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:55.077]  I mean, who knows?
[01:04:55.077 --> 01:04:56.698]  I mean, literally they could kill this guy.
[01:04:56.698 --> 01:04:59.560]  I mean, you know, they cover up for, you know, worse.
[01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:01.331]  I don't know what it is.
[01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:03.212]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[01:05:03.212 --> 01:05:07.335]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:08.936]  It's like I don't even exist.
[01:05:08.936 --> 01:05:10.877]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[01:05:10.877 --> 01:05:12.238]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:05:12.238 --> 01:05:14.980]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:20.403]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[01:05:20.403 --> 01:05:25.447]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[01:05:25.447 --> 01:05:28.149]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[01:05:28.149 --> 01:05:28.589]  Look it up.
[01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:35.698]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:02.756]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:06:02.756 --> 01:06:07.898]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:16.002]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:06:16.002 --> 01:06:20.543]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:24.345]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:06:24.505 --> 01:06:30.450]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:33.612]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:06:33.612 --> 01:06:38.836]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:06:38.836 --> 01:06:44.681]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage.

[01:06:47.164 --> 01:06:47.484]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:06:47.484 --> 01:06:50.387]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:06:50.387 --> 01:06:51.308]  MyPatriotsSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:03.794]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:07:03.794 --> 01:07:08.175]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:07:08.175 --> 01:07:11.836]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:07:11.836 --> 01:07:14.876]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:07:14.876 --> 01:07:22.138]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:26.322]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:07:26.322 --> 01:07:30.767]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:07:30.767 --> 01:07:36.753]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:40.677]  You're right, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:07:40.677 --> 01:07:43.440]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.781]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:46.282]  It's time to take action.
[01:07:46.282 --> 01:07:48.104]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:07:58.855 --> 01:08:04.781]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:07.504]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:30.725]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us and you weren't here in the first hour, it's just incredible.
[01:08:30.725 --> 01:08:33.766]  Obama is legalizing illegals by fiat.
[01:08:33.766 --> 01:08:36.908]  Hundreds of thousands a month are trying to pour in.
[01:08:36.908 --> 01:08:42.752]  60,000 youth alone in the last month are being held as their families completely collapse in Latin America.
[01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:46.254]  The media is saying America must accept anyone, billions of people.
[01:08:46.934 --> 01:08:49.136]  I mean, they're literally saying, or we're racist.
[01:08:49.136 --> 01:08:50.056]  That's the headline.
[01:08:50.056 --> 01:09:02.966]  Are we all racist now if we don't accept poor people with no skills, most of them who have medical issues, as the world collapses, climbing into the lifeboat, as America collapses?
[01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:03.806]  And the answer is no.
[01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:06.268]  They will take your house for property taxes.
[01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:09.130]  The IRS, you will be bankrupted.
[01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:10.671]  And they will take everything you've got.
[01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.373]  And Michelle Obama will tell you what to eat.
[01:09:13.356 --> 01:09:14.217]  She's doubled down.
[01:09:14.217 --> 01:09:15.537]  She will tell your kids what to eat.
[01:09:15.537 --> 01:09:17.178]  You will not pack school lunches.
[01:09:17.178 --> 01:09:18.079]  She is your boss.
[01:09:18.079 --> 01:09:20.981]  I mean, we've entered Twilight Zone.
[01:09:20.981 --> 01:09:29.626]  Washington scrambles to provide food housing to Dreamers under the DREAM Act, even though it hasn't passed yet, pouring across the border.
[01:09:29.626 --> 01:09:30.787]  60,000 children.
[01:09:30.787 --> 01:09:34.269]  Immigration becomes a central issue in the canter race.
[01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:35.150]  Charges fly.
[01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:39.493]  Homeland agents, quote, shouldn't target illegals at courthouses.
[01:09:39.493 --> 01:09:40.493]  That's the Washington Times.
[01:09:41.474 --> 01:09:44.376]  And the Telegraph says, is everyone in the West racist?
[01:09:44.376 --> 01:09:47.737]  Because we've only taken on more third world people than any other country.
[01:09:47.737 --> 01:09:49.038]  And the answer is yes, we're bad.
[01:09:49.038 --> 01:09:55.501]  We must let the political class have unlimited poor people to drive down wages and vote to take our guns.
[01:09:55.501 --> 01:10:10.089]  Then on Infowars.com, we have Josh Owens, Paul Joseph Watson, David Knight, and his wife, who's also a great photographer, she went along,
[01:10:11.843 --> 01:10:28.669]  Taking photos and video, and the police coming over to Josh for no reason, grabbing his camera, grabbing his ID, and then beating up protesters on video, dragging him away, and then grabbing someone else and dragging him behind the fence, and beating him.
[01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:35.291]  We can see through the fence, they're stomping and hitting him, and then chasing reporters that try to videotape it.
[01:10:35.971 --> 01:10:38.352]  And we just played that video for TV viewers.
[01:10:38.352 --> 01:10:47.136]  We're mainly a radio show, folks, but we also have video feeds, not just a document camera, not just a webcam, but a full-on TV, merging the two.
[01:10:47.136 --> 01:10:50.238]  We've been doing that for more than 10 years now, pioneering it.
[01:10:50.238 --> 01:10:59.182]  Well, now we pioneer having our reporters across the world as we're able to fund InfoWars.com and the news operation.
[01:10:59.182 --> 01:11:02.484]  I pledge to you, if we're able to get the funding, I'll have reporters in the field every week.
[01:11:03.979 --> 01:11:05.580]  I'll send them to UN meetings.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.061]  I'll send them to the Olympics to cover the police state.
[01:11:08.061 --> 01:11:10.062]  I'll send reporters to South America.
[01:11:10.062 --> 01:11:14.225]  I got combat, highly decorated vets ready to go to war zones.
[01:11:15.441 --> 01:11:24.209]  I mean, I'm building the team, and the team is awesome, and I want to thank all you, the listeners, for your support, your prayers, our affiliates, our sponsors, everyone.
[01:11:24.209 --> 01:11:36.320]  And that's why before our reporter Josh Owens updates us, we show that footage again of them beating up the protester, and he goes over and talks to the police, live on air, and asks them what's going on and what's happened.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.464]  Before we do that, I didn't talk about anything that funds us last hour.
[01:11:41.824 --> 01:11:43.585]  It is essential.
[01:11:43.585 --> 01:11:51.529]  News gathering, hardcore promotion of liberty, wearing our bias of telling the truth, and not backing down on our sleeve.
[01:11:51.529 --> 01:11:57.572]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have got to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the super high quality, pro, pure,

[01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:19.368]  And we've got not one, but two new bombshell products that will sell out, probably just for a few weeks, but at this rate, we're going to sell out in days.
[01:13:19.368 --> 01:13:20.949]  This is so popular.
[01:13:20.949 --> 01:13:25.572]  Super Female Vitality doesn't have eight herbs, it's got ten.
[01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:34.138]  The vitality, the weight loss, the working out is what people report, but what I've seen, because we've had it for months, testing with women in our families and folks in the office,
[01:13:35.051 --> 01:13:36.251]  Libido, you name it.
[01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:38.132]  Super female vitality now.
[01:13:38.132 --> 01:13:39.952]  Not just super male vitality.
[01:13:39.952 --> 01:13:42.173]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:13:42.173 --> 01:13:44.074]  And we now have the new X2.
[01:13:44.074 --> 01:13:45.954]  From 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:48.115]  The mine goes down to 12,000 feet.
[01:13:48.115 --> 01:13:50.636]  Multi-million year old iodine crystals.
[01:13:50.636 --> 01:13:51.596]  No one else has this.
[01:13:52.316 --> 01:13:53.857]  All the rest is out of seaweed.
[01:13:53.857 --> 01:13:55.418]  We still have Survival Shield.
[01:13:55.418 --> 01:13:56.599]  It's good for kids.
[01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:57.399]  It's a lower strength.
[01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:01.461]  This is super high-powered, but it's palatable compared to other major brands.
[01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:05.764]  No one else has anything like the new Survival Shield X2.
[01:14:05.764 --> 01:14:11.847]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[01:14:20.592 --> 01:14:23.594]  They were at a FEMA camp military base last week getting arrested.
[01:14:23.594 --> 01:14:36.462]  I mean we've got great reporters and we want to get even more so we've got enough depth having you know up to 10 reporters not just four or five to really have teams every week in the field not just here in Texas.
[01:14:36.462 --> 01:14:40.004]  So again we're building a real media organization not just me the old rabble rouser.
[01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:45.159]  You know, the old Godzilla and the Liberty Movement right here with my pot belly.
[01:14:45.159 --> 01:14:48.461]  That's a joke, it's Godzilla's fat, so my kid was making the joke.
[01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:49.941]  You're fat like Godzilla.
[01:14:49.941 --> 01:14:51.762]  I'm not really that fat, I've lost a lot of weight.
[01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:54.703]  The point is, is that we appreciate all your support.
[01:14:54.703 --> 01:14:55.983]  It's a win-win-win.
[01:14:55.983 --> 01:15:02.726]  Okay, let's go now to the streets of Copenhagen, Denmark with David Knight and Josh Owens.
[01:15:02.726 --> 01:15:05.867]  Recap what's happened, and you're about to go up and talk to the police.
[01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:06.327]  David Knight.
[01:15:07.617 --> 01:15:17.682]  Okay, so Alex, what we did was we came over here, we found the guy who ran across the street and shot the video, and he said that he can't see what he's got on his camera at this point.
[01:15:17.682 --> 01:15:24.605]  He said the monitor is too low, he has to take it back to his computer to take a look at it, so there's no way that we could actually shoot it.
[01:15:24.605 --> 01:15:34.731]  He wasn't sure what he got at all, so we don't have anything to show you on that, but while we're standing here, we just had somebody get run over down here at the intersection here, but
[01:15:36.052 --> 01:15:47.068]  What they told us the lady that was there said the reason that they they did this was because she said the guy was psychotic he was in Watson's face yelling at him and Watson wasn't doing anything.
[01:15:47.068 --> 01:15:48.631]  He was just standing there and
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.461]  The police came over, told him to stop several times.
[01:15:51.461 --> 01:15:52.081]  He didn't stop.
[01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:53.201]  At that point, they arrested him.
[01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:55.702]  He started resisting, and then they got really tough.
[01:15:55.702 --> 01:15:57.363]  Well, that's the way to put my foot in my mouth.
[01:15:57.363 --> 01:16:00.244]  The police may have taken him to a death camp!
[01:16:00.244 --> 01:16:04.525]  No, I mean, seriously, I see him dragging a reporter off and chasing the other reporter away.
[01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:05.485]  That was wrong.
[01:16:05.485 --> 01:16:07.966]  And then now we learn it was the guy going after Watson.
[01:16:07.966 --> 01:16:09.947]  Is that the same guy that keeps going after Watson?
[01:16:11.224 --> 01:16:11.865]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:16:11.865 --> 01:16:13.766]  He was on something.
[01:16:13.766 --> 01:16:21.552]  When I went by, he recognized me and he said something about, uh, why don't you report on the fact that DNA doesn't exist, that dinosaurs don't exist, and that sort of thing.
[01:16:21.552 --> 01:16:22.172]  Okay, okay.
[01:16:22.172 --> 01:16:23.874]  Well, I mean, that's what we said earlier.
[01:16:23.874 --> 01:16:25.055]  The police have been pretty nice.
[01:16:25.055 --> 01:16:26.636]  We're trying to be fair reporters here.
[01:16:26.636 --> 01:16:29.778]  I just see someone being drug away and beaten behind a screen.
[01:16:29.778 --> 01:16:31.740]  I still think it's wrong to beat him behind the screen.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.622]  I mean, if they're going to have to restrain him, they should do it in front of everybody.
[01:16:34.622 --> 01:16:37.024]  And then, why are they chasing the other reporter that's filming him?
[01:16:38.497 --> 01:16:39.257]  Uh, yeah, I know.
[01:16:39.257 --> 01:16:39.758]  Exactly.
[01:16:39.758 --> 01:16:50.323]  And what they did was, after that, now Josh was down here shooting front on, I was on the side of the hotel getting a side view of the people that were coming out of the limousines.
[01:16:50.323 --> 01:16:59.907]  And so they took him down there where I was, and at that point, they got him on the ground, they started doing the typical cop thing where they put the knee in the back and he's screaming, they're deliberately hurting me, and he's screaming bloody murder.
[01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:03.549]  And there was, uh, the cops started standing around him and one policewoman
[01:17:04.292 --> 01:17:08.157]  Motion to another policeman with her little finger like, get over this way because she saw me filming.
[01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:12.161]  She looked at me, saw me filming, motioned to her to get away to try to get around.
[01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:16.466]  So, they were trying to cover up what they were doing over there even too, so.
[01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:21.151]  Well, they clearly take him behind the screen and beat the hell out of him.
[01:17:22.473 --> 01:17:30.798]  I haven't seen the front on view that Josh got, so I just saw when they took him over to the side, I filmed some of that, he hasn't seen my footage yet either.
[01:17:30.798 --> 01:17:35.461]  But I'm sure that the footage that they got front on sounds a lot more sensational than that point.
[01:17:35.461 --> 01:17:39.604]  At that point they had pretty much, they'd gotten quite a few licks in on him.
[01:17:39.604 --> 01:17:43.627]  Well I'll give the police this, they have better posture than U.S.
[01:17:43.627 --> 01:17:44.367]  police.
[01:17:44.367 --> 01:17:46.429]  They all walk around like they got a broomstick up their back.
[01:17:47.648 --> 01:17:53.152]  Yeah, there hasn't been that kind of bullying that you typically expect from American police.
[01:17:53.152 --> 01:17:59.837]  And when this guy was fighting and banging around, they didn't kill him.
[01:17:59.837 --> 01:18:04.680]  Which, I remarked to Karen, I said, you know, that guy probably would have been killed in America.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.962]  Certainly in New Mexico, I think.
[01:18:06.962 --> 01:18:12.225]  Well, in New Mexico, if you say I'm a law student, I have rights, they literally rip your testicles off.
[01:18:12.225 --> 01:18:13.586]  Yeah, that's what they did, exactly.
[01:18:13.586 --> 01:18:15.888]  I mean, I'm sorry to use that graphic language, that's what they did.
[01:18:16.638 --> 01:18:20.260]  Yeah, yeah, they kicked the guy so hard that he lost the testicle.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:26.184]  We were just walking down here to see the accident and talk to this guy, and we saw they've got a Don't Tread On Me sign here.
[01:18:26.184 --> 01:18:27.525]  We hadn't seen this yet.
[01:18:27.525 --> 01:18:29.686]  And there's an InfoWars sign right down here.
[01:18:29.686 --> 01:18:32.948]  So a lot of people have recognized us.
[01:18:32.948 --> 01:18:34.630]  They were all wondering where you were.
[01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:39.613]  They're very disappointed that you weren't here this year to bullhorn the Bilderberg attendees.
[01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:43.155]  But we've got quite a few shots of people arriving.
[01:18:43.155 --> 01:18:45.236]  And you know, it's kind of like we're paparazzi.
[01:18:45.236 --> 01:18:45.697]  It's kind of...
[01:18:46.981 --> 01:18:57.609]  On one level, I felt silly doing it, but you know, we have to show people... No, no, but see, there should be paparazzi for secret world leaders so that we're aware of who's running our life.
[01:18:57.609 --> 01:19:04.214]  Instead, Edward Bernays said we're going to make Hollywood people popular in the 20s instead of people being obsessed with world leaders.
[01:19:04.214 --> 01:19:08.578]  Because people used to want to know who ran the world because people were politically involved.
[01:19:09.318 --> 01:19:11.700]  Now we're obsessed about Kim Kardashian.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.701]  Who is that in the van?
[01:19:12.701 --> 01:19:16.545]  That looks like a bunch of security people in the van, through the fence there.
[01:19:16.545 --> 01:19:18.207]  No, no, through the fence.
[01:19:18.207 --> 01:19:18.867]  Oh, through the fence.
[01:19:18.867 --> 01:19:19.788]  Yes, right here.
[01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:21.350]  Yep, that's a bunch of security people right there.
[01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:23.432]  Yeah, let's walk down towards you and see what's happening.
[01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:27.799]  Okay.
[01:19:27.799 --> 01:19:29.140]  I want to get some footage of this.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.620]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:34.962]  Do you have any idea, we were just curious, do you have any idea how many police there are here in this area?
[01:19:34.962 --> 01:19:36.122]  No idea?
[01:19:36.122 --> 01:19:36.802]  Okay.
[01:19:36.802 --> 01:19:37.863]  Okay.
[01:19:37.863 --> 01:19:40.324]  Yeah, it seems like they outnumber us.
[01:19:40.324 --> 01:19:41.564]  We've got so many.
[01:19:41.564 --> 01:19:43.565]  I guess maybe more people will show up next year.
[01:19:43.565 --> 01:19:45.346]  Ask her what she uses on her hair.
[01:19:45.346 --> 01:19:49.127]  Ask her about her hair care products.
[01:19:49.127 --> 01:19:54.629]  Do you have any idea how much is, are you being paid by the city or is this private security?
[01:19:57.278 --> 01:19:59.079]  Sprechen Sie Deutsch!
[01:19:59.079 --> 01:20:00.220]  Ein Volk, ein Reich!

[01:20:39.053 --> 01:20:46.018]  Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:22:07.336 --> 01:22:15.482]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.

[01:24:09.838 --> 01:24:13.740]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:18.402]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:24:18.402 --> 01:24:24.905]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[01:24:27.119 --> 01:24:30.841]  The taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet.
[01:24:30.841 --> 01:24:33.443]  I fell for her like a child.
[01:24:33.443 --> 01:24:35.825]  Oh, but the fire went wild.
[01:24:35.825 --> 01:24:37.706]  That's Alex Jones butchering Johnny Cash.
[01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:39.327]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:39.327 --> 01:24:50.055]  Going back to Copenhagen, Denmark, where regardless if the guy has some unorthodox views, the police grabbed him, clearly beat him up behind a fence.
[01:24:50.055 --> 01:24:51.716]  Go after another reporter covering it.
[01:24:51.716 --> 01:24:52.697]  That is a big no-no.
[01:24:54.088 --> 01:25:01.635]  And meanwhile, Watson's about to get done with Danish and RT interviews and being mobbed by the media and groupies.
[01:25:01.635 --> 01:25:06.259]  And then we will get a report from him.
[01:25:06.259 --> 01:25:09.662]  I'm told your wife got really good photos of Robert Rubin, General Petraeus.
[01:25:09.662 --> 01:25:13.285]  We'll get those up on InfoWars.com and tweet them at RealAlexJones.
[01:25:13.285 --> 01:25:20.351]  Other points you'd like to make, David Knight, before we come back and go to Watson and then segue into other news and phone calls today?
[01:25:21.462 --> 01:25:27.326]  Well, Alex, the reason that Watson is so busy doing interviews is because we're basically the only press that's here.
[01:25:27.326 --> 01:25:30.828]  The only other people that are here are Charlie Skelton and his wife.
[01:25:30.828 --> 01:25:39.854]  And other than that, there's not really any alternative media other than just independent bloggers that are here, and they're confined into the free speech zone, as they put it.
[01:25:39.854 --> 01:25:42.036]  But Charlie Skelton's wife was telling me that
[01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:53.663]  The photographer that they usually have didn't come to this event because he wanted to go to the Bilderberg Hotel itself, where they had their very first meeting 60 years ago.
[01:25:53.663 --> 01:25:56.784]  And he said that he took some pictures of the people that showed up there.
[01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:59.625]  He said there were three or four old-timers that were there.
[01:25:59.625 --> 01:26:05.007]  So they're actually going back reminiscing about when they first started plotting to take over the world.
[01:26:07.188 --> 01:26:17.807]  Folks had a gut reaction, a gut feeling to go to the original Bilderberg Hotel from 54 in Oosterbeek, Holland, and lo and behold, some of the old globalists were actually there.
[01:26:18.581 --> 01:26:19.822]  That's right.
[01:26:19.822 --> 01:26:20.162]  That's right.
[01:26:20.162 --> 01:26:21.322]  A few of them showed up.
[01:26:21.322 --> 01:26:22.663]  I'm not sure who yet.
[01:26:22.663 --> 01:26:23.704]  She hasn't found out yet.
[01:26:23.704 --> 01:26:25.104]  So we're going to talk to her later.
[01:26:25.104 --> 01:26:27.546]  She's very busy right now, as we have been.
[01:26:27.546 --> 01:26:28.966]  After about 4 p.m.
[01:26:28.966 --> 01:26:31.488]  our time, it got very busy.
[01:26:31.488 --> 01:26:33.669]  There were quite a few people coming at that point in time.
[01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:34.869]  We got here early this morning.
[01:26:34.869 --> 01:26:39.392]  We've been standing out here all day taking pictures of the people that come up.
[01:26:39.392 --> 01:26:44.054]  But in the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, is when they really started coming pretty frequently.
[01:26:44.054 --> 01:26:45.215]  So she's pretty busy.
[01:26:45.215 --> 01:26:45.915]  They're still coming in.
[01:26:47.665 --> 01:26:50.468]  Alright, well we'll get those photos up this evening on the Nightly News.
[01:26:50.468 --> 01:26:53.430]  We'll have boil-downs of all of this.
[01:26:53.430 --> 01:27:00.717]  As soon as Watson's done with the interviews, I know he's been busy the last hour, I told him that's fine, go ahead and do all those interviews to get the word out.
[01:27:00.717 --> 01:27:06.221]  We'll get an update of his take on the day's activities, then I'll go to other news and phone calls.
[01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:07.903]  But there's a lot of good news here.
[01:27:07.903 --> 01:27:08.443]  Bill Gertz
[01:27:09.204 --> 01:27:22.978]  Got the internal document from an insider at the Pentagon who was concerned, and they're reporting on the open plan to use armored vehicles, tanks, drones, to crush domestic protesting.
[01:27:22.978 --> 01:27:27.663]  In fact, it says civil unrest, and it says the Pentagon's very upset about this.
[01:27:27.663 --> 01:27:29.945]  Again, most people in the government aren't bad.
[01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:32.368]  It's that the people that run our government are bad.
[01:27:33.294 --> 01:27:40.337]  I mean, it's almost more people in the Pentagon and the military, I would say, that are more awake and more patriotic than the general public.
[01:27:40.337 --> 01:27:42.137]  I mean, undoubtedly.
[01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:45.679]  So it's like the military is our hope and our fear.
[01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:49.480]  It's just like America could help save the world or help destroy it.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.482]  I mean, it's always like that historically.
[01:27:53.482 --> 01:27:55.942]  We are the fulcrum to a great extent.
[01:27:55.942 --> 01:27:58.063]  Undoubtedly, the West is.
[01:27:58.063 --> 01:28:00.524]  And the West is not leading the world into good stuff now.
[01:28:00.524 --> 01:28:01.425]  We're leading it into bad.
[01:28:01.425 --> 01:28:02.425]  David Knight, your take on that?
[01:28:03.837 --> 01:28:07.960]  Yeah Alex, we really are standing on a knife edge, and like you said, it could go either way.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.742]  They're laying the foundation for this.
[01:28:10.742 --> 01:28:12.023]  We're trying to wake people up.
[01:28:12.023 --> 01:28:18.487]  We go to the military bases, we walk through the fake villages that they're planning on taking, and yet people are still not waking up.
[01:28:18.487 --> 01:28:25.172]  So hopefully, with the documents that have been released today, with the documents that we've shown, where they're buying massive amounts of ammunition,
[01:28:25.732 --> 01:28:32.919]  With the equipment that they're putting out and giving to the police departments and the way that they're training them essentially to shoot first.
[01:28:32.919 --> 01:28:34.841]  That's a big part of the problem in New Mexico.
[01:28:34.841 --> 01:28:38.885]  They've got a shoot first curriculum there that they're training the police on.
[01:28:38.885 --> 01:28:45.711]  And one of the police trainers there at the academy actually refused to teach that curriculum and they fired him.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.881]  Because he would not do it.
[01:28:47.881 --> 01:28:55.708]  So, there are police who are concerned about the way that they're changing the rules of engagement, the way that they're approaching and regarding the public.
[01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:59.191]  And the same thing is happening in the military, and we're seeing a convergence of those two things.
[01:28:59.191 --> 01:29:12.623]  When I was looking at the asymmetric warfare videos, one of the things that the guy said was, one of the mistakes that we made, this was a marine colonel, he said, one of the mistakes that we made when we came in, we should have combined the military with the police.
[01:29:13.436 --> 01:29:14.537]  That's what he said.
[01:29:14.537 --> 01:29:16.018]  That's what they're doing now.
[01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:19.219]  So, hopefully this Gertz thing will wake people up.
[01:29:19.219 --> 01:29:32.187]  And in those Marine Corps training videos with former generals, colonels, they're admitting it's for domestic operations and how to occupy America for a permanent government, a permanent police state.
[01:29:32.187 --> 01:29:38.591]  This is totally criminal, totally illegitimate, just like somebody robbing a bank or coming to your house at gunpoint and saying, cook me dinner.
[01:29:39.071 --> 01:29:41.434]  I mean, I mean, this is this is total tyranny.
[01:29:41.434 --> 01:29:44.398]  Dave, I'm going to come back with final comments from you.
[01:29:44.398 --> 01:29:47.462]  Dovetail it with this key document and more.
[01:29:47.462 --> 01:29:49.705]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.705 --> 01:29:51.107]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.107 --> 01:29:53.630]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:56.313]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:02.822]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:02.822 --> 01:30:05.644]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[01:30:35.199 --> 01:30:37.360]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:50.245]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:07.574]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:07.574 --> 01:31:09.916]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:09.916 --> 01:31:15.199]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:20.362]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:20.362 --> 01:31:23.404]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:23.684 --> 01:31:27.747]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:27.747 --> 01:31:32.089]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:32.089 --> 01:31:42.315]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:42.315 --> 01:31:44.837]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[01:31:45.037 --> 01:31:53.221]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:57.203]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:00.489 --> 01:32:06.675]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:32:06.675 --> 01:32:09.957]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:11.779]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:32:11.779 --> 01:32:18.125]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:24.010]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:28.112]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:28.112 --> 01:32:31.194]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:31.194 --> 01:32:39.479]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:39.479 --> 01:32:41.580]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.621]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:32:42.981 --> 01:32:51.926]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:32:51.926 --> 01:32:54.587]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:07.073]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[01:33:07.073 --> 01:33:08.614]  Government is the problem.
[01:33:11.587 --> 01:33:19.294]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:27.381]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[01:33:27.381 --> 01:33:29.482]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.482 --> 01:33:32.385]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:36.788 --> 01:33:44.451]  In my misfits way of life, a dark black past is my most valued possession.
[01:33:44.451 --> 01:33:51.433]  Painsite is always twenty-twenty, but looking back it's still a bit fuzzy.
[01:33:51.433 --> 01:33:55.355]  Speak of mutually assured destruction, nice story.
[01:33:55.355 --> 01:33:56.715]  Confiscation!
[01:33:56.715 --> 01:33:58.876]  Feeling paranoid too?
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:00.860]  Yeah, I was paranoid.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:08.404]  I thought there was a group called the Bilderberg Group 18, 19 years ago, and the media said it didn't exist even six years ago.
[01:34:08.404 --> 01:34:11.966]  New York Times does not exist.
[01:34:11.966 --> 01:34:13.686]  And after all, they wouldn't lie to you.
[01:34:13.686 --> 01:34:16.227]  I mean, you didn't build your business either.
[01:34:16.227 --> 01:34:24.171]  And Saddam had nuclear power plants enriching uranium under rose bushes in his backyard, and he ran 9-11 too.
[01:34:24.171 --> 01:34:25.872]  Not Saudi Arabia and the globalists.
[01:34:27.113 --> 01:34:33.576]  By the way, Kurt Nemo wrote a story yesterday about this, and Kurt was going to bring that back into me this morning.
[01:34:33.576 --> 01:34:34.056]  I'd asked for it.
[01:34:34.056 --> 01:34:34.976]  Will you get that from him?
[01:34:34.976 --> 01:34:37.497]  Because I want to actually give the headline out of his article.
[01:34:37.497 --> 01:34:39.458]  Thanks.
[01:34:39.458 --> 01:34:45.801]  And there was the headline, We Need to Fund Rebels in Syria to Fight Al Qaeda.
[01:34:45.801 --> 01:34:47.701]  And I saw that article.
[01:34:47.701 --> 01:34:48.342]  There it is, U.S.
[01:34:48.342 --> 01:34:52.363]  Will Train Rebels to Counter CIA's Al Qaeda Terrorists in Syria.
[01:34:52.363 --> 01:34:55.985]  And I saw his article, read where they said it, and then last night,
[01:34:57.429 --> 01:35:05.352]  I turned the television on for about 10 minutes just to check the news, and I was watching CNN with a straight face.
[01:35:05.352 --> 01:35:14.275]  They were saying, yeah, there's a big Al Qaeda threat, and we've got to do something about it, and that's why we need to invade Syria.
[01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:20.718]  And then this morning, they had Fox News on in the control room, and I saw it on the scroll, so I turned it up.
[01:35:22.248 --> 01:35:25.614]  So I know if you're watching the news, you're seeing it, and that's the new branding.
[01:35:25.614 --> 01:35:27.357]  Shucks, we gotta go into serial kinda.
[01:35:28.626 --> 01:35:35.151]  We've got to train these other rebels, because Al-Qaeda and Assad, they just kind of throw it in like, Al-Qaeda and Assad, you know.
[01:35:35.151 --> 01:35:37.432]  They're not saying Assad's with Al-Qaeda, that's too obvious.
[01:35:37.432 --> 01:35:39.874]  It's just, yeah, there's Al-Qaeda and Assad.
[01:35:39.874 --> 01:35:43.997]  Not, we've been funding for three plus years Al-Qaeda to attack Assad.
[01:35:43.997 --> 01:35:49.421]  And there was a big thing, you know, just six months ago where Rand Paul and Ted Cruz said no, we're not Al-Qaeda's air force.
[01:35:49.421 --> 01:35:58.207]  And Infowars.com led the charge, and Drug Report covered it, and we pointed out that the rebels launched the chemical attacks, and WorldNetDaily covered it, and they got caught.
[01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:06.595]  Turkey got caught launching false flags, so six months later they think you're stupid.
[01:36:06.595 --> 01:36:15.498]  And now, we need to have more boots on the ground and troops to fight Al Qaeda, which is 60 plus percent of the force.
[01:36:15.498 --> 01:36:22.740]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:27.021]  This has reached biblical level crazy town dimensions.
[01:36:28.885 --> 01:36:37.931]  David Knight, I'm going to shift gears into phone calls and a bunch of news I haven't covered yet, but I know there's a lot of other points you haven't gotten to yet, other observations from Bilderberg 2014.
[01:36:37.931 --> 01:36:43.514]  I want to hear those from you briefly, and so you can get back to getting photos and video up to InfoWars.com.
[01:36:43.514 --> 01:36:54.301]  In the next few minutes we're going to have the video for radio listeners that didn't see it earlier at InfoWars.com and the police dragging a demonstrator away to beat him up behind a screen and then trying to grab reporters that were getting footage of it.
[01:36:56.022 --> 01:37:00.747]  For me, you're there to show there's men behind the curtain.
[01:37:00.747 --> 01:37:03.390]  And to be paparazzi of the real controllers.
[01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:05.012]  They want to be in secret.
[01:37:05.012 --> 01:37:08.155]  They want us going after fake celebrities and not being informed.
[01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:08.816]  Your take on that?
[01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:11.151]  Oh, that's absolutely true, Alex.
[01:37:11.151 --> 01:37:18.197]  I mean, you know, on the one level, we're just taking pictures of these celebrities and we're trying to match them up to cards, so we've got to see which ones they are.
[01:37:18.197 --> 01:37:21.379]  But it's very important that people see that this is actually happening.
[01:37:21.379 --> 01:37:22.941]  That's why we're doing it.
[01:37:22.941 --> 01:37:25.122]  This really has consequences.
[01:37:25.122 --> 01:37:34.610]  And you know, during the break, we were, just before we went to the break, we were talking about the military and how they're using the military, training the military to come after the American people.
[01:37:35.362 --> 01:37:38.443]  We had a Danish Marine come over to us.
[01:37:38.443 --> 01:37:41.445]  He's got a 9-11 was an inside job shirt on.
[01:37:41.445 --> 01:37:45.307]  And he said he joined the Royal Marines because he wanted to make the world a better place.
[01:37:45.307 --> 01:37:50.109]  He said his very first lesson was how to poison the water and the food supply.
[01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:53.853]  And then they told him, less people is more peace.
[01:37:53.853 --> 01:37:54.694]  You know, things like that.
[01:37:54.694 --> 01:37:57.157]  So he said he got out of that, he joined the social workers.
[01:37:57.157 --> 01:38:02.222]  Then he realized that they weren't resuscitating people if they were of a certain age because it was too expensive.
[01:38:02.222 --> 01:38:04.245]  So he's seen this.
[01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:05.066]  He's had it.
[01:38:05.066 --> 01:38:06.868]  This is what's happening with a lot of veterans.
[01:38:07.268 --> 01:38:16.116]  A lot of people who were very idealistically went into the military and now, hopefully, they're seeing that our own government is training against our own people.
[01:38:16.116 --> 01:38:19.439]  How many different times and how many different ways do they have to see that?
[01:38:19.439 --> 01:38:25.564]  From the training scenarios to the weapons acquisitions to the training sites that they have.
[01:38:25.564 --> 01:38:27.525]  And now this newest released video.
[01:38:27.525 --> 01:38:29.847]  Hopefully this will wake people up.
[01:38:29.847 --> 01:38:30.628]  I don't know what it is.
[01:38:32.028 --> 01:38:41.890]  David, how did we, in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, have a lot lower taxes on the general public, and not kill old people?
[01:38:41.890 --> 01:38:52.392]  How did we raise our taxes, build a bureaucracy, and now there's no money for old people, but we had to have socialist healthcare because we love the old people, but now here's the death panels.
[01:38:52.392 --> 01:38:59.433]  The truth is, this is about lowering our standard of living by the so-called left, who are a bunch of fascists.
[01:39:00.612 --> 01:39:02.115]  And it's taking away people's choices.
[01:39:02.115 --> 01:39:09.467]  You know, we look at Bilderberg here, and the guy that I talked to last night, as he was running us out, I said, you know, they're going to be making decisions about how to run your life.
[01:39:09.467 --> 01:39:10.829]  And he goes, oh, very good.
[01:39:10.829 --> 01:39:13.193]  I hope they make good decisions and laughs at us, right?
[01:39:14.099 --> 01:39:17.040]  He's not ever going to have a say about how his life is run.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.801]  And it's that way from the large, overreaching policies down to how he spends his money.
[01:39:22.801 --> 01:39:27.841]  As these guys from Denmark were talking to us, they said they went through and they worked up with all the different taxes.
[01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:32.282]  Somebody making $100,000 gets to keep $4,000 of it.
[01:39:32.282 --> 01:39:34.663]  The rest of it, the government takes for their taxes.
[01:39:34.663 --> 01:39:38.663]  Then they decide how you're going to live, all the way down to your health care.
[01:39:38.663 --> 01:39:42.804]  And now the health care that they've had for free, now they're starting to charge these people for.
[01:39:43.066 --> 01:39:45.364]  Even though they're taking almost all of their money in taxes.
[01:39:47.867 --> 01:39:54.969]  Look at France, this year passed a 101% tax on new wealthy and middle class.
[01:39:54.969 --> 01:40:04.093]  I mean, that's the actual French headline, with a straight face, but then the top French government socialists are all exempt and have Swiss bank accounts.
[01:40:04.093 --> 01:40:12.556]  I mean, of course our taxes are going to be 100% if the elite don't have to pay taxes, because they're not under the same system.
[01:40:12.556 --> 01:40:13.456]  It's outrageous!
[01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:17.535]  And we're seeing revolts all across Europe against this.
[01:40:17.535 --> 01:40:20.460]  People understand where this is coming from to that degree.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:23.005]  They're angry about the austerity programs.
[01:40:23.005 --> 01:40:24.147]  I talked to the Italian.
[01:40:24.147 --> 01:40:26.071]  There was an Italian blogger that was here.
[01:40:27.028 --> 01:40:35.556]  They're very much aware of what happened because they've seen, just like Greece, they've seen their elected Prime Minister taken out of office and replaced by Goldman Sachs banker.
[01:40:35.556 --> 01:40:37.578]  That's why he's here covering Bilderberg.
[01:40:37.578 --> 01:40:39.640]  He knows that these people are behind it.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:47.027]  And the people in Italy and the people in Greece are sadder but wiser than most of the other people, but many of them still don't know and still don't care.
[01:40:47.027 --> 01:40:48.869]  And there's still a lot of people, he said, in Italy who
[01:40:49.449 --> 01:40:50.651]  Don't know about Bilderberg.
[01:40:50.651 --> 01:41:04.086]  They're upset about the fact that a banker was put in the place of a duly elected politician because as much as the elections are rigged and we complain about the fact that we don't have honest and enough choices,
[01:41:04.930 --> 01:41:10.996]  At least there's still the possibility if you've got elections at some point that you're going to have some input into the process.
[01:41:10.996 --> 01:41:11.917]  Something can be changed.
[01:41:11.917 --> 01:41:13.118]  There's a hope of it.
[01:41:13.118 --> 01:41:18.663]  What they're trying to do is take away even that hope that we could get back to open and honest and fair elections.
[01:41:18.663 --> 01:41:27.651]  They want to dictate it as David Rockefeller has said from meetings like this where they have a technological elite and bankers are going to replace the nation state.
[01:41:31.704 --> 01:41:32.964]  David Knight, absolutely.
[01:41:32.964 --> 01:41:35.225]  I was just thinking about what you had just said.
[01:41:35.225 --> 01:41:44.107]  I know we're going to get Paul Watson to pop in here in a little while for a brief update from him, but I'm going to cover some other news now.
[01:41:44.107 --> 01:41:56.791]  Any other things start breaking or unfolding, I know we have live feeds up at InfoWars.com that you guys are putting out separate from this radio slash TV show, but if anything starts happening important, just call us right back and we'll put you back on air.
[01:41:56.791 --> 01:41:57.231]  David Knight.
[01:41:57.978 --> 01:41:58.498]  We'll do.
[01:41:58.498 --> 01:42:01.521]  I want to get a closing comment from Josh Owens.
[01:42:01.521 --> 01:42:06.286]  Any other points he wants to make?
[01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:19.999]  Yeah, I think regardless of what the, earlier what we were talking about, which was right behind me where the cops drug the guy across, I think regardless of whether the cops were doing it because he was harassing other people or not, it doesn't give them a right to
[01:42:21.232 --> 01:42:27.263]  Grab him and, you know, drag him across the street, literally behind the curtain.
[01:42:27.263 --> 01:42:29.186]  You can see the curtain right here.
[01:42:29.186 --> 01:42:33.614]  Literally behind this, and begin beating him, regardless of what he was doing.
[01:42:34.634 --> 01:42:35.614]  It's still wrong.
[01:42:35.614 --> 01:42:40.837]  And regardless, I mean, just because I'm walking with a camera, maybe that says two things.
[01:42:40.837 --> 01:42:46.439]  Maybe it says that everyone's afraid of everything and they feel like, first off, they need to call the police.
[01:42:46.439 --> 01:42:47.399]  East Germany.
[01:42:47.399 --> 01:42:48.079]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:49.580]  East Germany.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.381]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[01:42:51.381 --> 01:42:57.083]  And it's not just over here, it's in America too.
[01:42:57.083 --> 01:42:58.844]  Is Bilderberg what you thought it would be?
[01:43:01.406 --> 01:43:03.047]  So far, yeah.
[01:43:03.047 --> 01:43:04.108]  So far, yeah.
[01:43:04.108 --> 01:43:07.470]  Actually, I do have to give the cops some credit.
[01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:10.052]  I think I was maybe bashing them a little too much earlier.
[01:43:10.052 --> 01:43:18.738]  But I do have to give them some credit for at least being polite when they beat people.
[01:43:18.738 --> 01:43:23.240]  So they would have torn that guy's genitals off as long as they were polite, it'd be okay.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:24.301]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:43:24.301 --> 01:43:26.262]  I mean, they detained me, but they were polite about it.
[01:43:26.262 --> 01:43:28.764]  So, I mean, what can I do?
[01:43:28.764 --> 01:43:29.865]  What if they wore white gloves?
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.681]  I mean, would that make it okay?
[01:43:34.681 --> 01:43:39.925]  They're generally more fit.
[01:43:39.925 --> 01:43:41.506]  Like at the airport.
[01:43:41.506 --> 01:43:42.727]  Yeah, like at the airport.
[01:43:42.727 --> 01:43:45.189]  Yeah, I think that makes everything fine.
[01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:46.150]  It's all about the illusion.
[01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:47.231]  It's all about the appearance.
[01:43:47.231 --> 01:43:55.037]  You know, they can beat someone to death, but if they're smiling while doing it... Alright, Josh Owens, we'll continue to get updates from you.
[01:43:55.037 --> 01:43:56.578]  Thank you so much.
[01:43:56.578 --> 01:43:58.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.024]  Okay, folks, I've got a bunch of news I want to hit, and I want to take your phone calls on Bilderberg, on...
[01:44:04.517 --> 01:44:14.483]  The new army document where they admit drones, armored vehicles, the military is for civil unrest and societal collapse.
[01:44:14.483 --> 01:44:19.225]  Department of Defense Directive 3025.18.
[01:44:19.225 --> 01:44:20.906]  Now the Washington Times is reporting on it.
[01:44:20.906 --> 01:44:24.008]  Good job, Washington Times.
[01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:32.913]  You can say what you want about the late owner of the Washington Times, the Reverend Kim Sung Moon or whatever his name was, but they got a lot of great writers and good reporters over there.
[01:44:33.837 --> 01:44:36.279]  Like Joe Curl and Bill Gertz and others.
[01:44:36.279 --> 01:44:38.281]  I mean, real journalism.
[01:44:38.281 --> 01:44:42.966]  I mean, you get public documents where they're preparing to use the military against the public.
[01:44:42.966 --> 01:44:45.148]  I mean, that's newsworthy.
[01:44:45.148 --> 01:44:48.351]  And causing a public debate about that is a big deal.
[01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:50.713]  And you gotta give credit for Drudge to linking to it.
[01:44:50.713 --> 01:44:54.336]  I mean, it's only a handful of news sites that continue to cover real issues.
[01:44:54.336 --> 01:44:57.880]  And then we dominate and have giant traffic.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:58.701]  Because people
[01:44:59.884 --> 01:45:01.465]  Are fundamentally interested in this.
[01:45:01.465 --> 01:45:02.966]  I'd like to hear from all of you out there.
[01:45:02.966 --> 01:45:04.207]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:45:04.207 --> 01:45:04.268]  800-259-9231.
[01:45:04.268 --> 01:45:05.488]  On this live Thursday edition.
[01:45:05.488 --> 01:45:07.210]  We've got an hour and 15 minutes left in global transmission.
[01:45:07.210 --> 01:45:07.250]  800-259-9231.
[01:45:23.544 --> 01:45:29.008]  And we're going to get a break coming up here in a few minutes and come back and start taking your phone calls.
[01:45:29.008 --> 01:45:32.330]  But let me go over some of these headlines.
[01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:38.134]  Intelligence Committee doesn't care if targets are even identified before they're assassinated, including U.S.
[01:45:38.134 --> 01:45:50.803]  Citizens, Congressional Records Show, and Washington's Blogspot breaks it down from the congressional transcript directly from the Library of Congress.
[01:45:50.803 --> 01:45:51.983]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:45:53.328 --> 01:46:06.121]  And I wanted to mention that article because in the Washington Times article, Directive outlines Obama's plan to use the military against citizens that I've got all my writers writing about right now.
[01:46:06.121 --> 01:46:09.244]  FrudgeReport.com has it linked and read on the right hand side.
[01:46:09.244 --> 01:46:12.948]  This is so important that I'm going to have three articles written.
[01:46:14.767 --> 01:46:16.107]  about this today and tomorrow.
[01:46:16.107 --> 01:46:26.830]  They can dole them out however they want from different angles because we need to put a focus on this because we're going to expand on Gertz's article and give you the rest of the story where they say it's for the Tea Party and gun owners.
[01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:27.990]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:41.234]  The military is training full speed to take over every local county and city, take over your police departments, take over your local media, take over your water treatment facilities, and arrest political dissidents for their political views.
[01:46:41.234 --> 01:46:41.394]  Okay?
[01:46:42.588 --> 01:46:44.390]  We're all on list, folks.
[01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:54.400]  I mean, this is to reason with a giant capital T. And a lot of people think you're cowards.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:58.485]  The globalists think that you're going to be intimidated by all this when the truth comes out.
[01:46:58.485 --> 01:47:04.351]  That's why I've been told the globalists are, some of them aren't concerned if I'm on air because they think I'll just scare you.
[01:47:05.968 --> 01:47:09.610]  I'm telling you this like you care your future's being robbed.
[01:47:09.610 --> 01:47:12.331]  This is totally illegal, totally illegitimate.
[01:47:12.331 --> 01:47:17.873]  We haven't done jack squat.
[01:47:17.873 --> 01:47:26.237]  We haven't done anything in this country to deserve this.
[01:47:26.237 --> 01:47:33.960]  And the people setting this up are the ones screwing over the economy, shipping in the drugs, opening up the borders, bankrupting everything.
[01:47:35.185 --> 01:47:47.048]  Going after our liberties, setting up death panels, setting up Obamacare, energy scams, funding Al-Qaeda, Fast and Furious, Benghazi.
[01:47:47.048 --> 01:47:48.129]  It happened to us, folks.
[01:47:48.129 --> 01:48:00.752]  We have an out-of-control criminal government with an intimidated Congress made up of criminals and scum and perverts and blackmailed people and some good people that speak out and are demonized, but they're rising stars.
[01:48:02.426 --> 01:48:03.747]  And it really hit me this morning.
[01:48:03.747 --> 01:48:05.048]  The lesson is tell the truth.
[01:48:05.048 --> 01:48:07.369]  Look how popular Rand Paul is telling the truth.
[01:48:07.369 --> 01:48:09.611]  Frontrunner for president.
[01:48:09.611 --> 01:48:10.711]  Runner-up Ted Cruz.
[01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:11.972]  Telling the truth.
[01:48:11.972 --> 01:48:15.354]  Probably be vice president if we get behind him.
[01:48:15.354 --> 01:48:19.157]  Doesn't mean they'll save everything, but it's a step in the right direction.
[01:48:19.157 --> 01:48:21.778]  We'll all save things together with God's help.
[01:48:21.778 --> 01:48:22.259]  Providence.
[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:33.696]  You know, during the whole nuke crisis that's been going on, Putin's been praying at a monastery for five days straight a few weeks ago, while Obama's out partying and golfing.
[01:48:33.696 --> 01:48:35.457]  Who do you think's going to have the providence of God?
[01:48:39.349 --> 01:48:56.024]  I'm not even saying Putin's a good guy, but I mean when he had his nuclear emergency doomsday plane circling for five days, when it looked like there was going to be a war until the West and Russia both backed down, he was right there on the border with it at a monastery for five days.
[01:48:56.024 --> 01:49:02.229]  In the news it said staying there and staying basically in a tower thinking about what he would do.
[01:49:03.291 --> 01:49:10.335]  I mean, even if he's a bad guy, a normal person would isolate themselves with the data and really try to figure out what to do.
[01:49:10.335 --> 01:49:22.822]  Not be out playing golf and partying and going to, you know, month four or whatever in the last year, since this time last year that Obama's been on vacation four months since last May.
[01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:24.463]  I saw an article a few days ago.
[01:49:24.463 --> 01:49:28.586]  Four months of vacation out of 12.
[01:49:28.586 --> 01:49:30.647]  I mean, I don't get two weeks of real vacation a year.
[01:49:31.607 --> 01:49:38.388]  I take days off just to do buck counting and, you know, deal with this latest diversion.
[01:49:38.388 --> 01:49:41.629]  Can you imagine taking four months off?
[01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:45.550]  I mean, it's a joke, people.
[01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:48.530]  And then meanwhile, they've got drones to kill whoever.
[01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:52.211]  They're going, oh, by the way, we'll use them in America.
[01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:54.852]  In the Department of Defense document.
[01:49:54.852 --> 01:49:58.853]  Yeah, we're going to use military drones on the American people.
[01:49:58.853 --> 01:50:00.633]  Do I get apologies from the Associated Press?
[01:50:03.404 --> 01:50:08.846]  Three years ago that ran articles saying I was a liar, Kurt Nimmo was a liar, Matt Drudge was a liar?
[01:50:08.846 --> 01:50:09.587]  No.
[01:50:09.587 --> 01:50:20.732]  Because the AP was running a Psy-Op operation to tell everybody that it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, which is really another message.
[01:50:20.732 --> 01:50:32.177]  The message is, when this all comes out, you're supposed to be kosher, or you're supposed to be trendy, you're supposed to be orthodox with the establishment, and you're supposed to say it doesn't exist.
[01:50:33.288 --> 01:50:38.170]  Just like the $5,000 per person Obama fine under Obamacare.
[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:42.472]  Just like Gibbs said, you're not supposed to admit the drum program exists, even though it publicly exists.
[01:50:42.472 --> 01:50:45.014]  Remember that clip?
[01:50:45.014 --> 01:50:50.016]  I mean, so I'm on a terrorist list because I know 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[01:50:50.016 --> 01:50:50.916]  Fine!
[01:50:50.916 --> 01:50:53.458]  Fine!
[01:50:53.458 --> 01:50:55.239]  I think the globalists have misjudged us.
[01:50:55.239 --> 01:50:56.759]  I think we're going to stand up and say none of this.
[01:50:56.759 --> 01:50:57.940]  We have the moral authority.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.160]  We have the moral high ground.

[01:52:00.313 --> 01:52:01.633]  Attention America!
[01:52:01.633 --> 01:52:09.236]  Within a little-known government document is devastating information that could cost the United States its most valuable asset.
[01:52:09.236 --> 01:52:12.637]  My name is Jeff Opdycke, former reporter for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:52:12.637 --> 01:52:21.800]  I've uncovered shocking evidence within the details of document FT-900, revealing the largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.301]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[01:52:25.301 --> 01:52:28.442]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[01:52:28.982 --> 01:52:36.328]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said an event of this nature has, quote, the potential to be catastrophic.
[01:52:36.328 --> 01:52:46.196]  Within a matter of weeks the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen in nearly a century.
[01:52:46.196 --> 01:52:49.939]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family from this government attack,

[01:54:09.675 --> 01:54:14.077]  Riders on the storm.
[01:54:14.077 --> 01:54:18.738]  Into this house we're born.
[01:54:18.738 --> 01:54:23.039]  Into this world we're thrown.
[01:54:23.039 --> 01:54:28.380]  Like a dog without a bone and actor out of love.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.921]  Riders on the storm.
[01:54:32.489 --> 01:54:36.952]  There's a killer on the road.
[01:54:36.952 --> 01:54:41.075]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[01:54:41.075 --> 01:54:45.217]  Take a long holiday.
[01:54:45.217 --> 01:54:49.420]  Let your children play.
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:55.584]  Exclusive Bilderberg Police brutally beat reporter Chase Cameraman to try to get the footage.
[01:54:55.584 --> 01:54:59.566]  Police take journalists to secluded pens to be beaten.
[01:54:59.566 --> 01:55:01.808]  They're now reporting this is happening to multiple people.
[01:55:07.418 --> 01:55:13.243]  Give that yelling screamer mouth off, and I don't think that's overall good, but you don't deserve to be taken to a secluded pen to be beaten over that.
[01:55:13.243 --> 01:55:18.447]  We're going to your phone calls right now.
[01:55:18.447 --> 01:55:23.511]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rich in Oregon.
[01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:24.392]  Rich, you're on the air.
[01:55:24.392 --> 01:55:26.694]  Welcome.
[01:55:26.694 --> 01:55:27.895]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:55:27.895 --> 01:55:28.996]  A worldwide transmission.
[01:55:28.996 --> 01:55:29.677]  How are you doing today?
[01:55:30.467 --> 01:55:31.228]  I'm doing good.
[01:55:31.228 --> 01:55:31.848]  Hey, you know what?
[01:55:31.848 --> 01:55:39.112]  There's a lot of us out here in Oregon that is tired of hearing about President Obama doing all the crazy stuff and getting away with it in our government.
[01:55:39.112 --> 01:55:43.135]  And I'm, you know, we're all with you, but there's nothing violent that needs to be done.
[01:55:43.135 --> 01:55:45.076]  It's just time for talking's over.
[01:55:45.076 --> 01:55:49.378]  People just need to stand up and push up to it.
[01:55:49.378 --> 01:55:50.879]  That's how I feel, just like this.
[01:55:50.879 --> 01:55:57.223]  What do you make of the lawlessness in the Pentagon openly training to take on the American people?
[01:55:57.223 --> 01:55:58.944]  It's the most craziest thing I've ever heard.
[01:55:59.924 --> 01:56:01.105]  I mean, you know what?
[01:56:01.105 --> 01:56:02.426]  How do they think they're going to do that?
[01:56:02.426 --> 01:56:03.446]  How many people are armed?
[01:56:03.446 --> 01:56:03.767]  You know what?
[01:56:03.767 --> 01:56:09.910]  I only know about 100 people where I live at, and everybody's tired of it.
[01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:10.751]  They're not going to do that.
[01:56:10.751 --> 01:56:12.112]  There's no way it's going to happen.
[01:56:12.112 --> 01:56:13.593]  Well, they're doing it, brother.
[01:56:13.593 --> 01:56:17.155]  They got military in every major city running checkpoints, searching cars today.
[01:56:17.155 --> 01:56:24.319]  And they're going to do it under a psyop of just slowly doing it, threatening the troops it's normal, the police it's normal.
[01:56:24.319 --> 01:56:27.902]  Then having them respond to wildfires and stuff, which they should,
[01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:41.464]  And then expanding it out to youth corps dressed up like military at events, searching people, then have the National Guard at the Kite Festival or at the UT football game here locally searching people.
[01:56:41.464 --> 01:56:48.710]  And then pretty soon there's just a military stationed everywhere and then they carry out SWAT team operations in assistance to police.
[01:56:48.710 --> 01:56:52.233]  They've been doing that for over 20 years in police uniform.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.943]  That got declassified a long time ago.
[01:56:54.943 --> 01:56:59.469]  So, sir, there's a whole covert archipelago of this happening.
[01:56:59.469 --> 01:57:03.434]  What I'm telling you, though, is they're getting ready to go operational in a big way.
[01:57:03.434 --> 01:57:05.457]  That's why there's a larger public debate about this.
[01:57:05.457 --> 01:57:06.398]  We need to have that debate.
[01:57:06.398 --> 01:57:07.860]  Thank you so much, Rich.
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.383]  Let's talk to Julio in Illinois.
[01:57:09.383 --> 01:57:10.003]  Go ahead, Julio.
[01:57:12.006 --> 01:57:13.307]  Aloha, Alex.
[01:57:13.307 --> 01:57:31.176]  Boy, oh boy, it's crazy to have been in Chantilly, Virginia in 2012 for Bilderberg, seeing people like Austin Goolsbee, who now is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, coming in or seeing Henry Kissinger, the humanitarian himself, driving into
[01:57:31.656 --> 01:57:32.737]  We're good to go.
[01:57:54.691 --> 01:58:01.496]  Klaus Klinfeld, current chairman and CEO of Alcoa, who's at Bilderberg this year.
[01:58:01.496 --> 01:58:10.502]  What a coincidence on CNBC right now they're announcing Alcoa is expanding to Indiana, same state as former Bilderberg member Mitch Daniels.
[01:58:10.502 --> 01:58:12.763]  But Alex, one name that caught my eye in this year, 2014's list,
[01:58:14.364 --> 01:58:16.984]  That's right, and of course Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, stay there.
[01:58:16.984 --> 01:58:17.945]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:17.945 --> 01:58:18.785]  Third Hour, coming up.
[01:58:18.785 --> 01:58:19.285]  Stay with us.
[01:58:19.285 --> 01:58:22.345]  We're going to continue to break down the shadow government.
[01:58:22.345 --> 01:58:23.886]  They don't want to be identified.
[01:58:23.886 --> 01:58:25.646]  We're going to identify them.
[01:58:25.646 --> 01:58:26.106]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.209 --> 01:58:50.594]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.594 --> 01:58:53.696]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:53.696 --> 01:58:59.800]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:04.323]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[01:59:04.323 --> 01:59:10.887]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[01:59:11.187 --> 01:59:13.208]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[01:59:13.208 --> 01:59:24.874]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[01:59:24.874 --> 01:59:26.895]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[01:59:26.895 --> 01:59:32.458]  When he brought me home, the bottle, Super Female, had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[01:59:32.458 --> 01:59:33.859]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[01:59:33.859 --> 01:59:36.220]  Our relationship, all I can say is, it's a lot better now.
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:40.942]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:40.942 --> 01:59:47.285]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.305 --> 02:00:10.146]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.146 --> 02:00:11.746]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.746 --> 02:00:13.267]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.267 --> 02:00:17.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.468 --> 02:00:21.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.641 --> 02:00:38.202]  Alright, going back to Julio.
[02:00:38.202 --> 02:00:43.704]  He's breaking down the mayor of Atlanta who is at Bilderberg right now.
[02:00:43.704 --> 02:00:48.286]  Obama as a senator went to Bilderberg during the campaign for that day when he disappeared.
[02:00:48.286 --> 02:00:50.487]  No one knew where he was in Virginia.
[02:00:50.487 --> 02:00:52.148]  We saw the Secret Service with him and Hillary.
[02:00:52.148 --> 02:00:52.708]  They drove through.
[02:00:52.708 --> 02:00:53.829]  It was confirmed he was inside.
[02:00:53.829 --> 02:00:59.531]  And that's when the New York Times said we were completely insane and no one was there.
[02:00:59.531 --> 02:01:01.552]  No Secret Service, no nothing.
[02:01:01.552 --> 02:01:03.573]  Again, that's how dumb they think you are.
[02:01:03.573 --> 02:01:04.834]  So Julio, finish up your point.
[02:01:06.121 --> 02:01:06.742]  Absolutely.
[02:01:06.742 --> 02:01:08.704]  So, who is this Kasim Reed?
[02:01:08.704 --> 02:01:12.327]  Obviously, he didn't go to any prestigious, elitist university.
[02:01:12.327 --> 02:01:14.469]  He graduated from Howard University.
[02:01:14.469 --> 02:01:17.933]  You know, what's in line for this man?
[02:01:17.933 --> 02:01:25.380]  I tried contacting the press office of the mayor, Kasim Reed of Atlanta, Georgia, several times this week to get them to confirm whether or not
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:26.541]  We're good to go.
[02:01:54.019 --> 02:01:57.202]  Globalist Network, to cover Bilderberg briefly.
[02:01:57.202 --> 02:01:59.645]  I tried to do it again this year.
[02:01:59.645 --> 02:02:01.107]  Hold these people accountable.
[02:02:01.107 --> 02:02:16.623]  And again, you look at Andris Rasmussen, the NATO Secretary General, or you look at one of the heads of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Daniel Esselen on the show, Alex, talked about climate change and technocracy being a topic.
[02:02:16.983 --> 02:02:17.404]  I think so.
[02:02:36.642 --> 02:02:37.623]  Take care everyone.
[02:02:37.623 --> 02:02:38.263]  Take care Alex.
[02:02:59.403 --> 02:03:00.003]  Well said.
[02:03:00.003 --> 02:03:01.605]  Yeah, Julio's a great reporter.
[02:03:01.605 --> 02:03:02.885]  I guess he's still in college.
[02:03:02.885 --> 02:03:05.107]  He's getting a journalism degree, but he does a lot of great work over the years.
[02:03:05.107 --> 02:03:06.828]  He's done some for us.
[02:03:06.828 --> 02:03:07.549]  And there he goes.
[02:03:07.549 --> 02:03:09.890]  He's confronted Al Gore and many other people.
[02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:18.737]  And anybody out there who has liberty, who loves freedom, and who knows the issues, you're more important than dinosaur media because you're independent.
[02:03:19.497 --> 02:03:27.262]  And yeah, it's good to have CNBC cover it, it's good to have The Guardian cover it, but we're forcing them to cover it by leading the way.
[02:03:27.262 --> 02:03:32.405]  That's how we got them to cover it.
[02:03:32.405 --> 02:03:40.670]  And now in the case of CNBC and others, they're kind of like, yeah, you got spies, politicians, and world leaders secretly meeting, but what's the big deal?
[02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:44.353]  But at least we're now going to start identifying these people, which is what they don't want.
[02:03:46.343 --> 02:03:48.104]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:03:48.104 --> 02:03:53.926]  I'm going to go to Shane and Mouse Link and Shane and Joe and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:55.847]  A lot of Shane's calling in today.
[02:03:55.847 --> 02:03:57.087]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:03:57.087 --> 02:03:57.167]  800-259-9231.
[02:03:57.167 --> 02:03:59.168]  And again, we've had reporters arrested.
[02:03:59.168 --> 02:04:01.689]  Drudge Report is linked to our info or story on that.
[02:04:01.689 --> 02:04:02.629]  We have now new video.
[02:04:16.236 --> 02:04:25.422]  That's higher def than what you saw as a live stream up on Infowars.com and we'll try to show some of that video coming up.
[02:04:25.422 --> 02:04:27.443]  Exclusive Bilderberg.
[02:04:27.443 --> 02:04:31.625]  Police brutally beat reporters Chase Camerman.
[02:04:31.625 --> 02:04:37.089]  Police take journalists with secluded pens to be beaten.
[02:04:37.089 --> 02:04:40.531]  Really unprecedented to see that going on.
[02:04:43.359 --> 02:04:46.842]  And then when people try to go film it, they chase them.
[02:04:46.842 --> 02:04:49.323]  And that's the bigger issue.
[02:04:49.323 --> 02:04:51.045]  We're gonna come back and break it all down.
[02:04:51.045 --> 02:04:55.628]  And I've got a report here saying that the golden age, the new golden age of journalism has begun.
[02:04:55.628 --> 02:04:56.569]  I agree.
[02:04:56.569 --> 02:04:58.050]  It's the rebirth of the media.
[02:04:58.050 --> 02:04:59.231]  We just haven't had it for a while.
[02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:01.587]  I don't know what it is.
[02:05:01.587 --> 02:05:03.468]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:05:03.468 --> 02:05:07.571]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:05:07.571 --> 02:05:09.172]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:05:09.172 --> 02:05:11.133]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:05:11.133 --> 02:05:12.494]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:05:12.494 --> 02:05:15.216]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[02:05:15.216 --> 02:05:20.639]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[02:05:20.639 --> 02:05:25.703]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:05:25.703 --> 02:05:28.405]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:05:28.405 --> 02:05:28.845]  Look it up.
[02:05:29.085 --> 02:05:35.948]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:04.591]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:04.591 --> 02:06:08.953]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:08.953 --> 02:06:12.615]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:12.615 --> 02:06:15.676]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:15.676 --> 02:06:23.220]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:26.862]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:27.062 --> 02:06:31.548]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:31.548 --> 02:06:37.536]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:37.536 --> 02:06:41.601]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:41.601 --> 02:06:44.224]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:44.224 --> 02:06:45.546]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:45.686 --> 02:06:47.068]  It's time to take action.
[02:06:47.068 --> 02:06:48.890]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:07:26.838 --> 02:07:35.440]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.581]  This is not a low-grade formula.

[02:08:15.057 --> 02:08:21.821]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:23.462]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:44.403 --> 02:08:47.644]  So don't you fool around.
[02:08:47.644 --> 02:08:54.365]  I'm gonna pull it!
[02:08:54.365 --> 02:08:57.466]  Monday through Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:57.466 --> 02:08:57.786]  11 a.m.
[02:08:57.786 --> 02:08:58.446]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:58.446 --> 02:08:59.607]  Central.
[02:08:59.607 --> 02:09:02.067]  We're here live.
[02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:08.829]  And then of course, back 7 o'clock weeknights, Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:32.005]  Man, there is so much news to cover I haven't gotten to yet and breaking, but right now, I want to go right back to your phone calls on Bilderberg, on Obama, telling the illegals he's legalizing them with executive orders and fiat, so hundreds of thousands pouring across a month, 60,000 children right now who don't even have parents, and the world says, you take our kids or you're racist.
[02:09:32.005 --> 02:09:38.729]  I wonder if I could go to Mexico and just show up myself and walk in and say, pay for everything, or have my baby, or just go dump my kid in Mexico.
[02:09:40.103 --> 02:09:42.285]  Hypothetically, pay for it!
[02:09:42.285 --> 02:09:48.130]  Racist!
[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:51.973]  It is just really getting crazy what we'll put up with.
[02:09:51.973 --> 02:10:03.162]  While the new Pentagon document is out, the Washington Times, leaked by Pentagon people that are concerned that they're training with drones and tanks to suppress the American people.
[02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:05.164]  I mean, it's total treason.
[02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:06.805]  And it's here.
[02:10:06.805 --> 02:10:07.686]  I want to go to Shane,
[02:10:09.215 --> 02:10:13.456]  I want to go to Mouselink, Shane, William, Joe, and many others.
[02:10:13.456 --> 02:10:15.037]  Let's go to Shane in North Carolina.
[02:10:15.037 --> 02:10:15.637]  You're on the air.
[02:10:15.637 --> 02:10:17.098]  Welcome.
[02:10:17.098 --> 02:10:18.278]  Hey, what's happening, man?
[02:10:18.278 --> 02:10:24.580]  I just want to let you know, first and foremost, that I'm engaging in resistance at the moment.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:27.541]  I'm in my backyard, as we speak, watering my garden.
[02:10:27.541 --> 02:10:28.901]  Oh, sir, that's racist.
[02:10:28.901 --> 02:10:30.562]  That is so racist.
[02:10:30.562 --> 02:10:33.023]  First year I've ever really gotten into it.
[02:10:33.023 --> 02:10:37.084]  I'm one of those Raleigh people who, you know, you had one of our friends on.
[02:10:38.025 --> 02:10:39.626]  You know, fluoride activists.
[02:10:39.626 --> 02:10:52.573]  You know, we're still working on them, but I just decided to move 20 minutes out of the city, get off the water grid, down the well water, got a, you know, acre of land, got chickens walking around my yard right now.
[02:10:52.573 --> 02:10:56.836]  Basically, you're a hardcore, extremist, dangerous person.
[02:10:56.836 --> 02:11:00.558]  Now, speaking of resistance, man, I've got a good suggestion for you.
[02:11:00.558 --> 02:11:04.860]  I think on your website you sell like a money belt, but do you sell a
[02:11:06.371 --> 02:11:12.314]  A money belt that has like quarters, dimes, nickels, you know, that kind of stuff, or just money clips.
[02:11:12.314 --> 02:11:23.439]  Now we do have a little money clip that's made in America that we sell at madein1776.com, but we haven't come out with a little money clip that, you know, holds coins in it, but that would be a good idea.
[02:11:23.439 --> 02:11:32.303]  Because just the other day, you know, I was at the store, I spend cash as much as possible, but just the other day I happened to have exact change on me, and I made a transaction, and I thought to myself,
[02:11:32.802 --> 02:11:33.482]  Wow!
[02:11:33.482 --> 02:11:39.244]  You know, when you have exact change, it's actually really easy to use cash.
[02:11:39.244 --> 02:11:45.327]  The big hassle a lot of establishments have with it is, you know, they have to have money on hand and they have to make change and all that.
[02:11:45.327 --> 02:11:47.247]  But you should really think about that.
[02:11:47.247 --> 02:11:50.028]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:11:50.028 --> 02:11:57.831]  I don't know if we're going to save cash ourselves doing that, but Israel's moving to try to make you go to a cashless society.
[02:11:57.831 --> 02:12:01.493]  It's such a bad idea, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:02.688 --> 02:12:03.951]  Such a horrible idea.
[02:12:03.951 --> 02:12:10.364]  And I've got some news that dovetails with that I'll be covering, because I want to get into that article here in a moment, but let's go back to calls right now.
[02:12:10.364 --> 02:12:13.250]  Mouse Link, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:13.591]  Hi Alex.
[02:12:14.746 --> 02:12:40.166]  The thing that I wanted to speak to you about that's been blowing up on my Twitter feed for the past couple of days was this Washington Post film critic Ann Hornaday, the one who said that the Santa Barbara shooting was, quote, tied to white men in Hollywood promoting escapist fantasies that revolve around vigilantism and sexual wish fulfillment.
[02:12:40.166 --> 02:12:42.448]  Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow
[02:12:43.206 --> 02:12:45.587]  Sir, everything is white male's fault.
[02:12:45.587 --> 02:12:46.408]  Didn't you know that?
[02:12:46.408 --> 02:12:48.108]  Go ahead.
[02:12:48.108 --> 02:13:05.537]  Well, and I'm one of them, I guess, so I guess I'm supposed to have that guilt coming down on my head constantly, but the thing that I had said that seemed to resonate with a lot of people was that why can't we just blame these stabbings and shootings on the people who perpetrate them, but is that not self-serving enough?
[02:13:05.537 --> 02:13:06.437]  Well, no, that's it.
[02:13:06.437 --> 02:13:12.140]  I mean, look, you need to be guilty and then politically do, whoever's accusing you of being bad, what they say.
[02:13:13.484 --> 02:13:18.025]  And so let the Washington Post, you know, say that you are the reason this happened.
[02:13:18.025 --> 02:13:20.846]  And of course I got real mad about this Sunday on the Sunday Show.
[02:13:20.846 --> 02:13:26.087]  I am sick of people blaming gun owners for what crazy people do with guns.
[02:13:26.087 --> 02:13:29.268]  The guy killed half the people with a knife.
[02:13:29.268 --> 02:13:40.191]  I guarantee you that the fathers and mothers of some of these dead young people have knives in their houses and they would say it's asinine if I said they shared guilt for having a knife.
[02:13:41.072 --> 02:13:45.116]  Half the people were killed with a knife.
[02:13:45.116 --> 02:13:53.463]  I didn't hear Mr. Martinez, that was blaming gun owners and the NRA for this, come out and blame everyone that owns knives because he knows that's asinine.
[02:13:53.463 --> 02:13:57.107]  Well, how is it any more asinine to blame guns?
[02:13:57.107 --> 02:13:57.947]  And yes, it is.
[02:13:57.947 --> 02:14:00.370]  And we need to call him on this.
[02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:02.372]  And, you know, I've mentioned the story you talk about.
[02:14:02.372 --> 02:14:04.534]  It's just, it's just incredible.
[02:14:04.534 --> 02:14:05.835]  It's totally incredible.
[02:14:07.210 --> 02:14:11.432]  But I mean, they're now saying the word girl is sexist and banned.
[02:14:11.432 --> 02:14:16.894]  They're saying the word bossy is, while being bossy, telling you not to use the word bossy.
[02:14:16.894 --> 02:14:20.375]  If they can make you not use the word bossy, they can do anything.
[02:14:20.375 --> 02:14:24.317]  They're just seeing how many orders they can get us to follow.
[02:14:24.317 --> 02:14:25.037]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:25.037 --> 02:14:25.617]  We're moving quick.
[02:14:25.617 --> 02:14:26.477]  Great calls.
[02:14:26.477 --> 02:14:28.578]  Shane, another Shane, in Pennsylvania.
[02:14:28.578 --> 02:14:30.659]  You're on the air.
[02:14:30.659 --> 02:14:35.561]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to call in and commend the InfoWars crew and David Knight and
[02:14:36.539 --> 02:14:41.142]  Josh Owens out there in at Bilderberg.
[02:14:41.142 --> 02:14:44.064]  It really shows who the real media is.
[02:14:44.064 --> 02:14:46.666]  And you got to speak for the people.
[02:14:46.666 --> 02:15:00.435]  And that's how we get the information into the mainstream and get these topics covered by mainstream news because their only purpose is to distort our reality.
[02:15:00.435 --> 02:15:03.477]  Most people know that something's wrong.
[02:15:03.477 --> 02:15:05.719]  They know that things are right in this country.
[02:15:06.483 --> 02:15:06.943]  We're good to go.
[02:15:29.804 --> 02:15:30.844]  Well, that's why we're here.
[02:15:30.844 --> 02:15:36.846]  So many people, and I appreciate your call, Shane, think I'm being a pessimist or fear-mongering.
[02:15:36.846 --> 02:15:41.348]  It's not fear-mongering if it's happening.
[02:15:41.348 --> 02:15:44.249]  Drug-resistant bugs are killing millions worldwide every year now.
[02:15:44.249 --> 02:15:46.510]  That's a big issue to worry about.
[02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:49.811]  I want to try to cause a debate about it to find ways to try to mitigate it or fix it.
[02:15:50.816 --> 02:15:53.017]  The globalists are coming for our guns.
[02:15:53.017 --> 02:16:04.884]  It's by admitting they're coming for the guns that we can have a debate about it and point out that our guns make people safer and they don't have a right to blame us individually for what someone else does.
[02:16:04.884 --> 02:16:11.828]  It's not fear-mongering to say the big corporations want to censor the internet because the rise of new journalism is causing a new golden age of journalism.
[02:16:17.987 --> 02:16:22.630]  I'm not a cynic or someone that thinks everything's doomed and we can't fix things.
[02:16:22.630 --> 02:16:26.173]  My detractors are usually, oh, you can't change it even if you're right.
[02:16:26.173 --> 02:16:27.914]  There's nothing you can do.
[02:16:27.914 --> 02:16:33.078]  Oh, sound like Igor the donkey from, um, Winnie the Pooh.
[02:16:33.078 --> 02:16:34.479]  I guess.
[02:16:34.479 --> 02:16:36.961]  Oh, Eeyore, whatever his stupid name is.
[02:16:36.961 --> 02:16:39.463]  Eeyore, it's not Eeyore, it's Eeyore?
[02:16:39.463 --> 02:16:42.625]  Eeyore, Eeyore, I guess that's the noise they make.
[02:16:42.625 --> 02:16:44.626]  Eeyore, I'll now call him Eeyore.
[02:16:44.626 --> 02:16:46.768]  The minion of Dr. Frankenstein.
[02:16:47.671 --> 02:16:50.713]  More like Renfield the Donkey.
[02:16:50.713 --> 02:16:53.194]  The Vampire Donkey Igor.
[02:16:53.194 --> 02:16:58.678]  Not of Eeyore fame, but of Igor fame.
[02:16:58.678 --> 02:17:00.059]  But here's a new study out.
[02:17:00.059 --> 02:17:01.840]  This is in the National Post.
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:05.162]  Being a cynic linked to triple risk of developing dementia.
[02:17:05.162 --> 02:17:09.004]  Finland study suggests, yeah, you decide life's all over.
[02:17:09.004 --> 02:17:10.445]  You decide you're just depressed.
[02:17:10.445 --> 02:17:11.166]  That's the way it is.
[02:17:12.099 --> 02:17:19.685]  You know, I'm just going to... Your body says, well I'm not needed, I'm just going to die.
[02:17:19.685 --> 02:17:31.394]  That's why in medicine they say praying helps, even if you don't believe in God, getting your brainwaves up, getting to that higher level, it's been proven that something's happening, is highly associated with healing and pulling through stuff.
[02:17:31.394 --> 02:17:36.258]  That's why you'll go into somebody who's bleeding to death or whatever and about to go into surgery, buck up, you're going to make it.
[02:17:37.386 --> 02:17:43.790]  You know, decide you want to live, and it's been shown statistically to massively boost your chances when you get put under to survive that surgery.
[02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:48.774]  Because your brain gets in the gear of, I'm needed for this family.
[02:17:48.774 --> 02:17:57.139]  You know, there's big studies out that I went to cover last week that old people feel absolutely alone, more and more in the West especially, totally useless.
[02:17:57.139 --> 02:18:00.662]  And it's because they've decided they're useless, their families decided they're useless.
[02:18:00.662 --> 02:18:03.924]  They didn't have a bunch of kids, so the kids don't want to come see them, or they don't have kids.
[02:18:05.285 --> 02:18:09.967]  And they want to be narcissistic and on power trips, and that's not what being old is about.
[02:18:09.967 --> 02:18:12.528]  You're supposed to be narcissistic when you're 14, not when you're 70.
[02:18:12.528 --> 02:18:15.069]  Not when you're 80.
[02:18:15.069 --> 02:18:19.891]  And that's what scientists and people are saying is, stop being on a power trip.
[02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:21.912]  Stop being narcissistic.
[02:18:21.912 --> 02:18:24.493]  Decide you're going to help people in the community.
[02:18:24.493 --> 02:18:27.434]  Go out to a soup kitchen and help homeless people when you're 80 years old.
[02:18:28.507 --> 02:18:33.371]  You're like, but I'm old, I deserve to be happy now and have time for myself.
[02:18:33.371 --> 02:18:36.533]  You're not happy until you go to the soup kitchen.
[02:18:36.533 --> 02:18:37.894]  Or paint.
[02:18:37.894 --> 02:18:44.339]  Or go visit a nursing home when you're 80, if you're not in bad shape, for people that are in bad shape.
[02:18:44.339 --> 02:18:46.881]  Take a therapy dog in to see people.
[02:18:46.881 --> 02:18:51.624]  True service is where fulfillment is, folks.
[02:18:51.624 --> 02:18:54.306]  If you're a journalist that tells the truth, that's a service.
[02:18:54.306 --> 02:18:56.628]  Doing good, we're meant to try to do good.
[02:18:57.639 --> 02:18:59.759]  And your body says, good job!
[02:18:59.759 --> 02:19:01.020]  I'm going to try to stay alive.
[02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:03.300]  I have worth to the tribe.
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.140]  I'm going to hang on.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:07.881]  They've got studies out on old women that live past 100.
[02:19:07.881 --> 02:19:09.341]  They've got big extended families.
[02:19:09.341 --> 02:19:09.961]  People love them.
[02:19:09.961 --> 02:19:10.841]  They come visit them.
[02:19:10.841 --> 02:19:12.602]  They feel like they're needed.
[02:19:12.602 --> 02:19:19.583]  And those women will hold on forever.
[02:19:19.583 --> 02:19:22.924]  My grandmother had been sick off and on for months.
[02:19:22.924 --> 02:19:23.544]  My dad's mom.
[02:19:24.568 --> 02:19:30.191]  And, uh, she knew he was coming to visit her on that Saturday when she died.
[02:19:30.191 --> 02:19:34.033]  And I had a feeling we needed to go see her, and then I ended up doing an overnight radio show and was up late.
[02:19:34.033 --> 02:19:38.695]  My dad came to the house, stood over the bed, and said, Hey, get up!
[02:19:38.695 --> 02:19:39.396]  We're going to see her!
[02:19:39.396 --> 02:19:41.977]  And I said, No, I'll come later.
[02:19:41.977 --> 02:19:42.437]  I'll come later.
[02:19:42.437 --> 02:19:44.058]  And I slept a few more hours.
[02:19:44.058 --> 02:19:48.560]  He was miles away when she died, and the preacher came and he said, It's okay, Patty.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.741]  You can turn loose.
[02:19:49.741 --> 02:19:50.441]  You don't have to wait.
[02:19:50.441 --> 02:19:52.062]  And she said, Okay.
[02:19:52.062 --> 02:19:53.123]  And turned loose and died.
[02:19:54.062 --> 02:19:56.064]  She just decided to die.
[02:19:56.064 --> 02:19:56.945]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:19:56.945 --> 02:19:58.847]  But that's what this says.
[02:19:58.847 --> 02:20:00.949]  The world will make you pessimistic.

[02:20:30.524 --> 02:20:31.644]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:31.644 --> 02:20:36.126]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.126 --> 02:20:41.848]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:41.848 --> 02:20:45.430]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:21:00.976 --> 02:21:02.837]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:21:02.837 --> 02:21:06.959]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:21:06.959 --> 02:21:08.560]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.522]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:21:10.522 --> 02:21:11.883]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:21:11.883 --> 02:21:14.624]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[02:21:14.624 --> 02:21:20.048]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[02:21:20.048 --> 02:21:25.091]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:21:25.091 --> 02:21:27.793]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:21:27.793 --> 02:21:28.233]  Look it up.
[02:21:28.453 --> 02:21:35.336]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[02:23:04.952 --> 02:23:06.995]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[02:23:06.995 --> 02:23:08.678]  You had a heart attack last year.
[02:23:08.678 --> 02:23:10.181]  Oh, I know.
[02:23:10.181 --> 02:23:12.104]  I was told no more hard labor.
[02:23:12.104 --> 02:23:13.686]  Then why are you digging?
[02:23:13.686 --> 02:23:15.549]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[02:23:15.549 --> 02:23:17.292]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[02:23:17.292 --> 02:23:18.334]  Extendovite?
[02:23:18.334 --> 02:23:19.215]  Is that a new drug?
[02:23:20.069 --> 02:23:21.430]  No, not a drug.
[02:23:21.430 --> 02:23:25.251]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[02:23:25.251 --> 02:23:25.871]  Herbal?
[02:23:25.871 --> 02:23:27.392]  How can that help?
[02:23:27.392 --> 02:23:29.893]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years.
[02:23:29.893 --> 02:23:31.974]  ExtendoVite is doing the job for me.
[02:23:31.974 --> 02:23:34.595]  Does your doctor know about ExtendoVite?
[02:23:34.595 --> 02:23:38.176]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[02:23:38.456 --> 02:23:40.217]  I feel great taking XtendoVite.
[02:23:40.217 --> 02:23:41.378]  I don't want to stop.
[02:23:41.378 --> 02:23:42.479]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[02:23:42.479 --> 02:23:42.859]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[02:24:08.530 --> 02:24:16.980]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:17.721]  We're the Renegades!
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:46.402]  And I'm here to tell you folks, the renegades are not the communists.
[02:24:46.402 --> 02:24:50.763]  Like Rage Against the Machine would tell you.
[02:24:50.763 --> 02:24:58.965]  Martin Luther King, Malcolm X was definitely a renegade.
[02:24:58.965 --> 02:25:02.766]  But then you plop communism on top of it, that's not renegade, that's establishment.
[02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:06.843]  We cannot let them push communism as trending anymore.
[02:25:06.843 --> 02:25:08.704]  I'm sick of it.
[02:25:08.704 --> 02:25:11.626]  Yeah, communism is great for George Soros because he's exempt from it.
[02:25:11.626 --> 02:25:15.948]  And he gets your money, that pig.
[02:25:15.948 --> 02:25:17.849]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California.
[02:25:17.849 --> 02:25:19.030]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.370]  Go ahead.
[02:25:21.081 --> 02:25:23.344]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[02:25:23.344 --> 02:25:36.120]  Yeah, so one thing I'm noticing in the media, just all the time really, and sorry for being jumbled here, is that there's a lot of focus on Obama, but not a whole lot of focus on Biden.
[02:25:36.975 --> 02:25:47.581]  And I see that, yeah, Obama, he takes a lot of vacations and everything, but Biden, though, Biden tends to do a lot more actual work towards advancing the New World Order.
[02:25:47.581 --> 02:25:54.585]  And I just feel that more focus should be shined on him as opposed to Obama, who's really a distracting joke.
[02:25:54.585 --> 02:25:55.346]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:55.346 --> 02:25:56.026]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:56.026 --> 02:25:58.928]  I don't manipulate people, but I will communicate.
[02:25:59.835 --> 02:26:11.863]  And if I can get conservatives and libertarians angry about the New World Order by tagging Obama onto it because he is a figurehead for them, so he deserves it.
[02:26:11.863 --> 02:26:18.228]  You know, his face is on the billboard for the company that I hate, The Globalist.
[02:26:18.228 --> 02:26:23.992]  So he's the figurehead on the ship of these pirates, so I will attack him by name and talk about him.
[02:26:24.591 --> 02:26:30.895]  But it's pretty clear Obama is just reading off teleprompters and mailing it in, like George W. Bush did.
[02:26:30.895 --> 02:26:33.176]  Bill Clinton did not mail it in.
[02:26:33.176 --> 02:26:37.679]  John F. Kennedy did not mail it in, for good or for bad.
[02:26:37.679 --> 02:26:40.221]  George Herbert Walker Bush did not mail it in.
[02:26:40.221 --> 02:26:44.864]  They actually were globalists in there, wheeling and dealing different factions.
[02:26:44.864 --> 02:26:46.445]  Nixon did not mail it in.
[02:26:46.445 --> 02:26:48.066]  Nixon was actually president.
[02:26:48.066 --> 02:26:49.827]  That's why they destroyed him.
[02:26:49.827 --> 02:26:50.607]  And that's on record.
[02:26:50.607 --> 02:26:51.588]  The establishment said that.
[02:26:52.068 --> 02:26:53.129]  I'm not defending the stuff he did.
[02:26:53.129 --> 02:26:57.592]  He was terrible, but compared to these people, he was an angel.
[02:26:57.592 --> 02:26:58.553]  So I hear what you're saying.
[02:26:58.553 --> 02:27:06.598]  No, Joe Biden is more of a president than Obama and does creep around trying to get our guns and, you know, the rest of it.
[02:27:06.598 --> 02:27:07.979]  I mean, they use Michelle Obama.
[02:27:07.979 --> 02:27:14.484]  When I say Michelle Obama is telling our kids what to eat, well, she's the figurehead, the woman on there doing it.
[02:27:14.484 --> 02:27:20.268]  But really, it's Big Agra, the GMO, Monsanto, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation actually make a lot of the money off of it.
[02:27:21.298 --> 02:27:23.999]  They actually run what your kids are fed to a great extent.
[02:27:23.999 --> 02:27:26.560]  I mean, Bill Gates is a control freak for Planned Parenthood.
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:27.980]  His dad used to run it.
[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:29.520]  Army intelligence.
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.061]  Top eugenicist.
[02:27:31.061 --> 02:27:32.681]  And you're going to eat what they say.
[02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:34.862]  Your kid's going to be sterile.
[02:27:34.862 --> 02:27:37.983]  You know, if they say they're going to shove a gun down your throat and pull the trigger, you'll do it.
[02:27:37.983 --> 02:27:38.863]  Or they'll send the, you know...
[02:27:39.807 --> 02:27:43.928]  Hi Alex, I'd like to start by thanking you for covering everything like you do and getting some assistance as well.
[02:27:43.928 --> 02:27:44.928]  But what I'd like to talk about is
[02:28:04.969 --> 02:28:07.231]  Is there anything more we can do to wake up the people?
[02:28:07.231 --> 02:28:10.493]  Because most of this stuff is pretty in the obvious.
[02:28:10.493 --> 02:28:14.235]  I just don't understand how people can be so blind and passive.
[02:28:35.449 --> 02:28:40.211]  Now that it's all out in the open, they go, yeah, we take foster kids and do medical experiments on them.
[02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:41.231]  Some died.
[02:28:41.231 --> 02:28:43.132]  Big deal.
[02:28:43.132 --> 02:28:45.192]  Yeah, we're doing them.
[02:28:45.192 --> 02:28:47.973]  What's wrong with that?
[02:28:47.973 --> 02:28:50.334]  See, I mean, we're now getting down the line.
[02:28:50.334 --> 02:28:52.995]  Yeah, we're going to get rid of internet freedom.
[02:28:52.995 --> 02:28:54.515]  Yeah, we're going to take your bank account.
[02:28:54.515 --> 02:28:57.136]  Yeah, your kid belongs to the government.
[02:28:57.136 --> 02:28:58.436]  See that SWAT team?
[02:28:58.436 --> 02:29:01.217]  Got a problem?
[02:29:01.217 --> 02:29:03.118]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:03.118 --> 02:29:03.798]  See how that works?
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:06.001]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:06.001 --> 02:29:07.643]  I mean, I just don't understand it.
[02:29:07.643 --> 02:29:11.868]  I mean, especially with the coverage out over in Belverne right now.
[02:29:11.868 --> 02:29:15.452]  With the reporter getting drugged behind the department.
[02:29:15.452 --> 02:29:17.835]  Well, maybe he needs to be drugged behind there, you know?
[02:29:17.835 --> 02:29:21.780]  Maybe he needs to be beaten and stomped out and chased out another reporter.
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:25.064]  Maybe, I mean, we need to just arrest all the media and stop complaining.
[02:29:26.754 --> 02:29:28.155]  Let them take our bank accounts.
[02:29:28.155 --> 02:29:29.135]  Let them take our kids.
[02:29:29.135 --> 02:29:30.756]  Let them give us four shots.
[02:29:30.756 --> 02:29:33.297]  The people running things are good.
[02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:34.738]  And they mean well.
[02:29:34.738 --> 02:29:40.161]  And it's mentally ill to think government ever did anything wrong or that special interests are wrong.
[02:29:40.161 --> 02:29:41.401]  Okay?
[02:29:41.401 --> 02:29:42.922]  I want to be mainstream now.
[02:29:42.922 --> 02:29:48.705]  I love Michelle Obama and I love the school lunches and I didn't build my business or my media empire.
[02:29:48.705 --> 02:29:49.065]  Okay?
[02:29:49.065 --> 02:29:49.325]  Period.
[02:29:49.685 --> 02:29:52.312]  We'll be back with Watson if we can find him.
[02:29:52.312 --> 02:29:54.739]  I know he's doing a lot of interviews right now, doing great jobs.
[02:29:54.739 --> 02:29:56.564]  We've got a special report coming up.
[02:30:00.737 --> 02:30:03.861]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:09.967]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:14.472]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[02:30:14.472 --> 02:30:21.040]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:23.361]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[02:30:23.361 --> 02:30:35.025]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[02:30:35.025 --> 02:30:37.046]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[02:30:37.046 --> 02:30:42.769]  When he brought me home, the bottle Super Female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[02:30:42.769 --> 02:30:44.609]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[02:30:44.609 --> 02:30:46.490]  Our relationship, all I can say is, it's a lot better now.
[02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:51.112]  I've just started taking super female vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:51.112 --> 02:30:58.695]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[02:30:58.695 --> 02:31:07.658]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:07.858 --> 02:31:10.181]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:10.181 --> 02:31:15.447]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:15.447 --> 02:31:20.633]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:20.633 --> 02:31:23.657]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:23.937 --> 02:31:27.998]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:27.998 --> 02:31:32.339]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:32.339 --> 02:31:42.562]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:42.562 --> 02:31:46.763]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[02:31:46.963 --> 02:31:53.494]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:53.494 --> 02:31:57.481]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:01.565 --> 02:32:02.926]  In the near future.
[02:32:02.926 --> 02:32:07.408]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:07.408 --> 02:32:08.629]  Security alert.
[02:32:08.629 --> 02:32:10.650]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:10.650 --> 02:32:11.530]  Analysis.
[02:32:11.530 --> 02:32:12.251]  InfoWars.
[02:32:12.251 --> 02:32:14.212]  Building independent media operations.
[02:32:14.212 --> 02:32:19.235]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:19.235 --> 02:32:20.275]  Crime directive.
[02:32:20.275 --> 02:32:21.816]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:21.816 --> 02:32:24.678]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:24.678 --> 02:32:27.899]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:27.899 --> 02:32:30.201]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:30.201 --> 02:32:30.941]  These people are a
[02:32:31.401 --> 02:32:36.504]  They are never going to stop.
[02:32:36.504 --> 02:32:44.828]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:32:44.828 --> 02:32:55.093]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:32:55.093 --> 02:32:57.354]  Collectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:33:02.859 --> 02:33:04.721]  We are on the march.
[02:33:04.721 --> 02:33:07.865]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:07.865 --> 02:33:15.174]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:15.174 --> 02:33:16.455]  I am so excited, folks.
[02:33:16.455 --> 02:33:22.723]  One of the most famous authors of the last hundred years is dead.
[02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:30.392]  We have been contacted by legit folks that have the recordings that nobody else has.
[02:33:30.392 --> 02:33:39.515]  And it's all vetted of this person predicting the new world order and predicting everything that's basically now happened.
[02:33:39.515 --> 02:33:43.556]  And when this gets released, because I'm going to be on the road next week, but I'm going to be doing the show.
[02:33:45.097 --> 02:33:49.179]  I almost want to be in studio when this happens or fly this guy here.
[02:33:49.179 --> 02:33:52.181]  Because it's unbelievable.
[02:33:52.181 --> 02:33:55.083]  And I don't like to count my chickens before they're hatched.
[02:33:55.083 --> 02:33:56.544]  We won't make any money off of it.
[02:33:56.544 --> 02:34:00.346]  What I'm excited about is just putting it out and people hearing this.
[02:34:00.346 --> 02:34:05.289]  Because believe me, this will be newsworthy and people aren't going to like this.
[02:34:05.289 --> 02:34:11.313]  Because this individual was never really political.
[02:34:11.313 --> 02:34:11.893]  It's bizarre.
[02:34:13.967 --> 02:34:18.589]  Uh, I'm very excited about that when this comes out.
[02:34:18.589 --> 02:34:21.910]  And if it's in God's will, it'll end up coming out.
[02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:23.490]  Uh, we got the fish directly up to the boat.
[02:34:23.490 --> 02:34:25.271]  It's a very nice fish.
[02:34:25.271 --> 02:34:27.512]  But I haven't got it fully into the boat yet.
[02:34:27.512 --> 02:34:31.193]  And I'm not, you know, back at the restaurant eating it yet, so, uh...
[02:34:32.162 --> 02:34:33.643]  This is a fish I'll definitely throw back.
[02:34:33.643 --> 02:34:35.643]  We'll show it to everybody and then throw it back.
[02:34:35.643 --> 02:34:37.484]  But very, very exciting.
[02:34:37.484 --> 02:34:39.164]  We're working on getting Paul Watson.
[02:34:39.164 --> 02:34:51.028]  You know, it's good news that Paul's been mobbed by TV, radio, RT, British News, the Denmark News, all of it.
[02:34:51.028 --> 02:34:58.231]  So I wanted to get a quick comment from Watson sometime out there via the video feeds from Bilderberg 2014.
[02:34:58.231 --> 02:35:00.572]  I want to go back to your calls as well.
[02:35:00.572 --> 02:35:01.332]  I'm going to have
[02:35:03.168 --> 02:35:09.434]  Builderberg snapshot video that Rob Dew and others put together that's about 14 minutes long.
[02:35:09.434 --> 02:35:13.397]  We're going to have this full thing posted to InfoWars.com in the next few hours.
[02:35:13.397 --> 02:35:15.820]  I want to air part of it now that kind of gives highlights.
[02:35:17.437 --> 02:35:44.124]  uh... or you know the best of builder berg for about the last six seven years last two thousand six was eight years ago so eight years ago so here's the best of builder berg's unveiling or the unmasking of builder berg in the last eight years i don't know what you call this builder berg unmask i think it's probably a good name for it uh... here's part of that for the radio and tv audience of your radio listener infowars.com forward slash show
[02:35:45.024 --> 02:35:52.970]  Uh, and you can actually watch the free feeds or if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you don't just get the free feeds during the day, you get the nighttime radio show, the films, and so much more.
[02:35:52.970 --> 02:35:56.832]  I want to thank you all for being PrisonPlanet.tv members, but here's part of this report.
[02:36:11.233 --> 02:36:16.079]  Well, now, humanity is awakening!
[02:36:27.433 --> 02:36:37.698]  On the outskirts of the National Capital today, black limousines with darkened windows converged on a hotel where private security guards imposed ironclad control.
[02:36:37.698 --> 02:36:40.519]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:36:40.519 --> 02:36:42.700]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:36:44.235 --> 02:36:45.115]  It was just scary.
[02:36:45.115 --> 02:36:48.956]  I mean, again, I've been all over the world, and I've never seen anything like this.
[02:36:48.956 --> 02:36:51.296]  It was like hours of humiliation.
[02:36:51.296 --> 02:36:52.937]  And they said, what are you here for?
[02:36:52.937 --> 02:36:58.078]  And I said, well, I'm here to, you know, cover the media, covering a political event, up top as members of parliament.
[02:36:58.078 --> 02:36:59.658]  I was answering all the questions.
[02:36:59.658 --> 02:37:00.618]  It was clear I wasn't a threat.
[02:37:00.618 --> 02:37:02.058]  It was clear I didn't have any criminal record.
[02:37:02.058 --> 02:37:03.018]  It was clear I was press.
[02:37:03.018 --> 02:37:04.879]  It was clear I was coming to interview people.
[02:37:04.879 --> 02:37:06.039]  They were gonna deny me.
[02:37:06.039 --> 02:37:09.160]  They told me earlier that I was probably gonna be denied.
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:11.420]  And then you guys showed up, and everything changed.
[02:37:12.372 --> 02:37:14.193]  They're debating the attack on Iran.
[02:37:14.193 --> 02:37:16.675]  They're talking about how to take out Hugo Chavez.
[02:37:16.675 --> 02:37:20.557]  They're talking about how to get their American Union in that destroys Canadian, U.S.
[02:37:20.557 --> 02:37:22.219]  and Mexican sovereignty.
[02:37:22.219 --> 02:37:25.441]  So we're talking about the death of Canada is what's happening in there right now.
[02:37:25.441 --> 02:37:28.663]  The death of your sovereignty is happening in there right now.
[02:37:28.663 --> 02:37:32.165]  120 of the world's most powerful men.
[02:37:32.165 --> 02:37:33.666]  Heads of state from Europe.
[02:37:33.666 --> 02:37:35.527]  High officials of the United States government.
[02:37:35.527 --> 02:37:36.548]  Treasury.
[02:37:36.548 --> 02:37:37.289]  White House.
[02:37:37.289 --> 02:37:38.149]  State.
[02:37:38.149 --> 02:37:38.790]  Defense.
[02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:40.311]  They're setting the world agenda now.
[02:37:42.076 --> 02:37:45.381]  The reason they want secrecy is because they're doing evil.
[02:37:45.381 --> 02:37:47.885]  Evil is done under the cover of darkness.
[02:37:47.885 --> 02:37:49.828]  Good works are done in sunshine.
[02:37:49.828 --> 02:37:50.710]  Right onto the sidewalk.
[02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:52.693]  Yeah, there's no implication that we aren't cooperating.
[02:37:52.693 --> 02:37:54.656]  Right onto the sidewalk instead.
[02:37:54.656 --> 02:37:55.477]  Last year, uh...
[02:37:56.627 --> 02:37:59.969]  It took me 14 and a half hours to get to Munich.
[02:37:59.969 --> 02:38:01.849]  I was pulled off a plane in Milan.
[02:38:01.849 --> 02:38:03.070]  I was pulled off a plane in Munich.
[02:38:03.070 --> 02:38:04.731]  They interrogated me for hours.
[02:38:04.731 --> 02:38:09.613]  They basically told me that they'll be keeping an eye on me 24 hours of the day.
[02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:18.097]  The little hotel where we were staying at, Gemini, out of the 20 rooms, 6 were occupied, 3 by the CIA and 3 by the German Secret Service.
[02:38:18.097 --> 02:38:24.400]  That's how serious these people are and that's how afraid they are of actually what we may be able to reveal and what we actually do reveal.
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:34.345]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here in Canada today to stand up against the Bilderberg Group that's attempting to get rid of the sovereignty of the United States.
[02:38:34.345 --> 02:38:38.106]  The truth of your world government has now been exposed.
[02:38:38.106 --> 02:38:39.467]  We know you are ruthless.
[02:38:39.467 --> 02:38:40.528]  We know you are evil.
[02:38:41.618 --> 02:38:46.460]  So what they're going to do over the next year, year and a half, is to bring the market back up to 1998-1999 levels.
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:50.802]  They're going to get all the suckers to invest whatever little money they have left over.
[02:38:50.802 --> 02:38:55.045]  And that's when they're going to make the economy bottom drop out.
[02:38:55.045 --> 02:38:56.345]  They need to destroy the economy.
[02:38:56.345 --> 02:39:02.608]  They're members of the Biblical Club who for years and years and years have been going and participating in all the conversations.
[02:39:02.608 --> 02:39:05.229]  They've always been there, always.
[02:39:05.229 --> 02:39:07.471]  Get them on both sides.
[02:39:07.471 --> 02:39:08.531]  Yeah, you crook.
[02:39:08.531 --> 02:39:09.992]  Yeah, you're going to go to jail like Ken Lay.
[02:39:14.668 --> 02:39:16.650]  Oh yeah, there's one right there.
[02:39:16.650 --> 02:39:17.751]  Hi!
[02:39:17.751 --> 02:39:18.711]  Hey, we're not your property.
[02:39:18.711 --> 02:39:20.112]  We're not your slaves.
[02:39:20.112 --> 02:39:23.015]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:39:23.015 --> 02:39:26.337]  You will and you are failing now.
[02:39:26.337 --> 02:39:29.160]  Your New World Order will fall.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:32.002]  Humanity will defeat you.
[02:39:32.002 --> 02:39:33.003]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:39:41.101 --> 02:39:45.742]  Jim, my governor, Rick Perry, it's in the front of the Dallas Morning News.
[02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:50.983]  The headline reads, Texas Governor Rick Perry to attend Bilderberg.
[02:39:50.983 --> 02:39:58.124]  What does it mean to have the governor of Texas in the Dallas Morning News just admitting he's going to Bilderberg Group?
[02:39:58.124 --> 02:40:00.525]  It means he's a potential president.
[02:40:00.525 --> 02:40:07.546]  Even as the obscure governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, lost his virginity at the Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany in 1991.
[02:40:09.321 --> 02:40:12.182]  And he's elected president the following year.
[02:40:12.182 --> 02:40:14.343]  We were at the Oritz Carlton.
[02:40:14.343 --> 02:40:17.103]  It looked like a typical, uh, Bilderberg scenario.
[02:40:17.103 --> 02:40:19.084]  They had the armed guards all around the place.
[02:40:19.084 --> 02:40:24.286]  They had platoons of, uh, uh, cops in formation waiting for the dispersement.
[02:40:24.286 --> 02:40:28.287]  They also had, uh, cops all the way around the building.
[02:40:28.287 --> 02:40:38.030]  And they had all those high-tech things where every member can, uh, hear whatever spoken in any language instantly translated into his own language.
[02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:40.672]  We're going directly into the belly of the beast.
[02:40:40.672 --> 02:40:44.697]  The hotel will be filled with at least five spy agencies.
[02:40:44.697 --> 02:40:49.802]  CIA, defense intelligence, facade, uh, European Union security.
[02:40:51.004 --> 02:40:53.306]  We're sitting here in the room.
[02:40:53.306 --> 02:40:58.950]  As the phone rings with your producer Tom Banheuser to put me on, the fire alarm goes off.
[02:40:58.950 --> 02:41:01.111]  So everybody is exiting the building.
[02:41:01.111 --> 02:41:02.252]  I know this is a setup.
[02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:04.534]  They timed it exactly when this happened.
[02:41:04.534 --> 02:41:04.994]  Open the door.
[02:41:04.994 --> 02:41:06.535]  I want to hear the fire alarm.
[02:41:06.535 --> 02:41:11.759]  We have a security guy walk up to us 30 minutes ago, about 25 minutes ago, before this happened.
[02:41:11.759 --> 02:41:12.679]  He said, what are you guys doing?
[02:41:12.679 --> 02:41:14.681]  We said, we're just walking around checking out the artwork in the hotel.
[02:41:15.201 --> 02:41:15.962]  Yeah, we got a car right behind us.
[02:41:46.889 --> 02:41:53.212]  This is some of the highlights of the last eight years of Bilderberg meetings.
[02:41:53.212 --> 02:41:54.873]  Switzerland's coming up and a lot more.
[02:41:54.873 --> 02:41:58.575]  We're going to post the full video to YouTube right now.
[02:41:58.575 --> 02:42:00.936]  Also have the whole thing on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:42:00.936 --> 02:42:01.857]  May have aired last night.
[02:42:01.857 --> 02:42:04.918]  I think we're premiering it here today, a dude was telling me.
[02:42:04.918 --> 02:42:08.480]  And then we'll have that up on Infowars.com for you.
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:15.044]  I want to take you now live to Paul Watson, who is acting like the Wasselhoff, as he's secretly known.
[02:42:17.077 --> 02:42:19.759]  That's Watson meets David Hasselhoff.
[02:42:29.005 --> 02:42:30.585]  Look how ridiculous he is.
[02:42:30.585 --> 02:42:31.626]  I like Watson.
[02:42:31.626 --> 02:42:36.087]  I was teasing him early for being gone for like two hours doing interviews, which I wanted him to do.
[02:42:36.087 --> 02:42:46.649]  I just didn't know that he'd be gone all day because, I gotta be honest, articles he writes will be more important and read more than going on RT or on Danish television or whatever else he did.
[02:42:46.649 --> 02:42:49.910]  And this show, it's just that, you know, he's our reporter.
[02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:55.671]  But it's a sign of success that the Wasselhoff has been doing good.
[02:42:55.671 --> 02:42:57.232]  So go ahead and smile again.
[02:42:57.232 --> 02:42:57.772]  Look at that.
[02:42:58.732 --> 02:43:00.373]  It's like the Grinch or something.
[02:43:00.373 --> 02:43:03.575]  All right, anyways, Watson, I always start getting dingy in the third hour.
[02:43:03.575 --> 02:43:05.036]  It's a phenomenon.
[02:43:05.036 --> 02:43:06.717]  We can't help it.
[02:43:06.717 --> 02:43:10.139]  I'm known as the Walrus Hoff by the ladies.
[02:43:10.139 --> 02:43:17.763]  No, but seriously, Watson, tell us what you think about what's been unfolding today.
[02:43:17.763 --> 02:43:21.245]  Well, we started off in the morning tracking the delegates coming in.
[02:43:21.245 --> 02:43:23.547]  It was very slow to begin with.
[02:43:23.547 --> 02:43:27.249]  So we were over in the press area next to the opposite side of the hotel.
[02:43:27.978 --> 02:43:32.619]  Then we came within this area, which is obviously directly opposite the main building.
[02:43:32.619 --> 02:43:37.641]  We weren't allowed in here at first, but later on they allowed us to be here.
[02:43:37.641 --> 02:43:44.723]  Yeah, we got the Queen of Spain, we got Petraeus, we got Peter Thiel, we got a lot of interesting individuals arriving.
[02:43:44.723 --> 02:43:53.145]  One of the most funny things was that several of them decided to go on a little jog, including David Petraeus, around Copenhagen.
[02:43:53.145 --> 02:43:54.626]  So that was quite funny to see that.
[02:43:56.218 --> 02:43:58.019]  Yeah, it's been intense.
[02:43:58.019 --> 02:44:19.729]  I went in the protest area a little bit earlier, then obviously dashing back and forth for interviews, so... And when I was here in the protest area, the Bilderberg members were up in the corridor, which is one of the main windows there going up just past the elevator, which we were in that hotel the other night, and they were stood there looking out the window, laughing at us, basically.
[02:44:20.875 --> 02:44:26.119]  On several different floors, so we're interested in them and they're very interested in us.
[02:44:26.119 --> 02:44:30.422]  Oh yes, it's so funny that we force coverage of their criminal activities.
[02:44:30.422 --> 02:44:34.765]  It's so funny that the peasants are exposing their corporate global government.
[02:44:34.765 --> 02:44:42.891]  It's so funny that Tea Party type candidates are getting elected from Europe to Africa, from Latin America to the US to Australia.
[02:44:42.891 --> 02:44:45.953]  It's so funny that we're identifying them.
[02:44:45.953 --> 02:44:48.275]  No, this is all part of their Confidence Act.
[02:44:50.385 --> 02:44:51.166]  Exactly.
[02:44:51.166 --> 02:44:53.730]  Some of them, you know, scoot away pretty quickly.
[02:44:53.730 --> 02:44:54.631]  They don't want to be seen.
[02:44:54.631 --> 02:44:57.295]  But some of them just come outside and take a good long look at us.
[02:44:57.295 --> 02:45:02.883]  And as I said, up in the window doing the same thing, so... Some of them aren't ashamed of what they're doing.
[02:45:02.883 --> 02:45:03.845]  Some of them are.
[02:45:03.845 --> 02:45:06.489]  They've still got two spotters on the roof.
[02:45:06.489 --> 02:45:06.569]  Um...
[02:45:07.867 --> 02:45:11.849]  People were saying earlier in the protest pen that they were snipers.
[02:45:11.849 --> 02:45:13.349]  I haven't seen any evidence of that.
[02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:15.070]  They've definitely got binoculars.
[02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:21.412]  They're up on both corners of the main block of the Marriott building, and they've been watching us carefully all day.
[02:45:21.412 --> 02:45:22.753]  And there are two of them now.
[02:45:22.753 --> 02:45:28.315]  There was only one earlier, even though there's absolutely nobody in the protest zone now.
[02:45:28.315 --> 02:45:29.995]  They've all gone home.
[02:45:29.995 --> 02:45:34.037]  It's literally five or six reporters just stood here.
[02:45:34.037 --> 02:45:37.138]  The protest zone looks like a concentration camp.
[02:45:38.442 --> 02:45:40.022]  It's a free speech, Pena.
[02:45:40.022 --> 02:45:41.943]  They don't actually let you get in it directly.
[02:45:41.943 --> 02:45:46.903]  You have to walk around several blocks just to get in it, so they make it difficult even to get into there.
[02:45:46.903 --> 02:45:51.704]  Well, I'm glad that folks are just ignoring that and going out and covering it as the press.
[02:45:51.704 --> 02:45:59.186]  Have you had any trouble with the police, or have they just been dragging off other reporters?
[02:45:59.186 --> 02:46:00.506]  I haven't had any trouble with them.
[02:46:00.506 --> 02:46:05.927]  There was an incident earlier where they grabbed somebody who was, to be fair, acting like a bit of a lunatic.
[02:46:07.811 --> 02:46:11.596]  Detained him they didn't arrest him because he was released soon afterwards.
[02:46:11.596 --> 02:46:25.331]  So and they also lovingly stomped on him Yeah, they were they were very rough with him He was walking around harassing people basically so mixed feelings about that.
[02:46:25.331 --> 02:46:27.294]  Yeah, you have a little bit of a satisfied look on your face
[02:46:30.496 --> 02:46:32.298]  You should have heard what he was saying about you, Alex.
[02:46:32.298 --> 02:46:33.018]  Oh, I know.
[02:46:33.018 --> 02:46:33.879]  I already heard about it.
[02:46:33.879 --> 02:46:34.740]  I love it.
[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:35.060]  I know.
[02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:37.602]  It's like, I'm like, those darn police!
[02:46:37.602 --> 02:46:39.083]  Meanwhile, he's like, Alex Jones is evil!
[02:46:39.083 --> 02:46:42.786]  The cops are like... Yeah, they didn't like hearing that.
[02:46:42.786 --> 02:46:43.907]  Well, I still don't like it.
[02:46:43.907 --> 02:46:47.570]  I still don't like the fact they chased the other reporter that was trying to get footage of it.
[02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:48.651]  Let the guy do that.
[02:46:48.651 --> 02:46:52.594]  As long as he doesn't hit anybody, he has a right to do it.
[02:46:52.594 --> 02:46:57.037]  Well, he didn't do anything that was an arrestable offense, really, or a reason to be detained.
[02:46:57.037 --> 02:46:58.899]  Once they grabbed him, he started struggling, but...
[02:46:59.531 --> 02:47:23.272]  Generally, they've they've been quite polite whether it maintain I mean, you know Bilderberg is stealing their pensions to which they don't realize so Maybe they're starting to look into it a little bit and come over to our side as is usual By the way, I was not making fun of you with a Wasselhoff thing You actually come up with the idea of a joke t-shirt as you as the Wasselhoff.
[02:47:23.272 --> 02:47:25.974]  I Think we should definitely roll with I think it'd be a big seller
[02:47:27.970 --> 02:47:31.891]  This spotter guy is still on the roof, even though there's basically nobody here.
[02:47:31.891 --> 02:47:35.832]  That's a good way to change the subject, Wasselhoff.
[02:47:35.832 --> 02:47:38.693]  It's just that I noticed him, he's peering over at us again.
[02:47:38.693 --> 02:47:41.533]  Shall we tell folks your other nickname?
[02:47:41.533 --> 02:47:42.554]  What's that, Alex?
[02:47:42.554 --> 02:47:47.075]  I'm not gonna... Me and Watson probably talk 30 minutes every morning about news.
[02:47:47.075 --> 02:47:52.176]  And 12 years, is it 13 or 14 years you've been working with me, Waddy?
[02:47:52.176 --> 02:47:53.856]  Since October 2002, so 12 years nearly now.
[02:47:56.653 --> 02:47:58.173]  Yeah, so that's why I joke around a lot with Paul.
[02:47:58.173 --> 02:47:59.134]  I shouldn't do it.
[02:47:59.134 --> 02:48:05.095]  Paul's very reserved on TV and the radio, but he's actually a wild man behind the scenes, folks.
[02:48:05.095 --> 02:48:09.376]  My reputation precedes me.
[02:48:09.376 --> 02:48:09.996]  All right, anyways.
[02:48:09.996 --> 02:48:12.117]  Hey, when are you and your wife going to come over here?
[02:48:12.117 --> 02:48:15.578]  I keep saying I'll fly you over here for a business meeting slash vacation.
[02:48:15.578 --> 02:48:17.118]  You keep having excuses.
[02:48:17.118 --> 02:48:18.178]  When it gets colder.
[02:48:18.178 --> 02:48:20.259]  If I come now, I'll shrivel up, Alex.
[02:48:20.259 --> 02:48:21.359]  It's too hot.
[02:48:21.359 --> 02:48:23.159]  Maybe October.
[02:48:23.159 --> 02:48:25.100]  He does this all the time, and then in October,
[02:48:25.885 --> 02:48:28.347]  I promise, Alex, I will come this year.
[02:48:28.347 --> 02:48:31.010]  There are more cars arriving.
[02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:35.333]  There are more attendees arriving at Bilderberg right now.
[02:48:35.333 --> 02:48:37.455]  Just pulling into the main entrance.
[02:48:37.455 --> 02:48:39.837]  Alright, well, a lot's going on.
[02:48:39.837 --> 02:48:42.660]  Man, I tell ya, did you hear about this Bill Gertz article?
[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:44.441]  I guess you know what I talked to you about this morning.
[02:48:44.441 --> 02:48:48.545]  Where he's got the army documents where they admit they're trying to take on the American people, just period.
[02:48:48.545 --> 02:48:50.787]  I mean, this is so illegal, Paul.
[02:48:52.998 --> 02:49:03.147]  No, I was too preoccupied with trying to get the live stream on InfoWars, but there are more delegates arriving pretty late now, as you can see on the video stream.
[02:49:03.147 --> 02:49:04.328]  Yeah, because it's like, what is it like?
[02:49:04.328 --> 02:49:08.792]  Is it like 8 at night over there right now?
[02:49:08.792 --> 02:49:10.954]  It's 10 to 9.
[02:49:10.954 --> 02:49:11.114]  It's 8.50.
[02:49:11.114 --> 02:49:12.816]  Yeah, wow.
[02:49:12.816 --> 02:49:17.380]  So I guess it's an hour later than it is in England, huh, Greenwich?
[02:49:17.380 --> 02:49:18.181]  Yeah, that's right, yeah.
[02:49:19.372 --> 02:49:23.575]  Alright, well listen, you've done a great job and obviously you guys should be able to take off the rest of the day now.
[02:49:23.575 --> 02:49:24.976]  I know it's a long hours.
[02:49:24.976 --> 02:49:26.657]  Get some more of the delegates arriving.
[02:49:26.657 --> 02:49:33.862]  Then see if you can creep around at night on top of any of those other buildings with a telephoto lens if you guys want to.
[02:49:33.862 --> 02:49:35.363]  You don't have to if you're tired.
[02:49:35.363 --> 02:49:37.844]  To get footage inside those rooms.
[02:49:37.844 --> 02:49:41.347]  Because they've been putting up that mesh to block out the windows.
[02:49:41.347 --> 02:49:44.689]  I've never seen them do that before.
[02:49:44.689 --> 02:49:48.772]  Yeah, they were doing something on the other side of the building as well that we saw, so...
[02:49:49.915 --> 02:49:54.739]  Well, I've actually seen it, Bohemian Grove, and I'm not joking now, and John Ronson saw this with me.
[02:49:54.739 --> 02:49:56.620]  He wrote about it in his book, Them.
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:50:05.386]  Henry Kissinger dressed in drag, bent over, doing something I can't mention on the radio, and so, you know, I mean, I guess he's getting with the times.
[02:50:05.386 --> 02:50:10.370]  We should put him on the cover of Time magazine, the transgender tipping point, led by Henry Kissinger.
[02:50:10.370 --> 02:50:12.932]  What do you think?
[02:50:12.932 --> 02:50:15.554]  I think maybe you should put it on the front of the Infowars magazine.
[02:50:16.656 --> 02:50:18.438]  I think that would be a big seller as well.
[02:50:18.438 --> 02:50:19.078]  With?
[02:50:19.078 --> 02:50:21.941]  With?
[02:50:21.941 --> 02:50:24.583]  Dianne Feinstein dresses a man on the other side.
[02:50:24.583 --> 02:50:25.604]  You want to be fair, right?
[02:50:25.604 --> 02:50:29.367]  Yeah, you don't want to be sexist about it, Alex.
[02:50:29.367 --> 02:50:29.608]  Come on.
[02:50:29.608 --> 02:50:31.910]  It's a great idea.
[02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:32.430]  All right.
[02:50:32.430 --> 02:50:34.272]  Hey, Watson, seriously, great job there.
[02:50:34.272 --> 02:50:36.114]  Great job, Bilderberg.
[02:50:36.114 --> 02:50:37.635]  2014, a lot of media coverage.
[02:50:37.635 --> 02:50:39.457]  Gotta say the dinosaur media is covering it now.
[02:50:39.457 --> 02:50:40.778]  What do you think of that, Watson?
[02:50:42.122 --> 02:50:46.825]  It was very slow yesterday, but it seems the trickle is turning into a deluge.
[02:50:46.825 --> 02:50:51.888]  I think the London Evening Standard described it as catnip for lizard-obsessed conspiracy theorists.
[02:50:51.888 --> 02:50:52.989]  They're not here, obviously.
[02:50:52.989 --> 02:50:54.710]  They know absolutely nothing about it.
[02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:57.611]  But, yeah, I was talking to Danish media... Hold on, I gotta hear about this.
[02:50:57.611 --> 02:50:59.252]  We'll do overdrive to take some calls.
[02:50:59.252 --> 02:50:59.633]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:09.523]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.

[02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:08.121]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:53:08.121 --> 02:53:11.762]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:53:11.762 --> 02:53:14.783]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:53:14.783 --> 02:53:21.925]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:53:22.285 --> 02:53:26.168]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:53:26.168 --> 02:53:30.552]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:53:30.552 --> 02:53:36.476]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:53:36.476 --> 02:53:40.519]  You're right, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:53:40.519 --> 02:53:43.101]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:53:43.101 --> 02:53:44.603]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:53:44.603 --> 02:53:45.944]  It's time to take action.
[02:53:45.944 --> 02:53:47.605]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:54:46.002 --> 02:54:50.523]  And he'll be doing more live stream reports, more YouTubes, more Twitters, more photos.

[02:55:19.974 --> 02:55:21.274]  Let's go back to Paul.
[02:55:21.274 --> 02:55:22.735]  Paul, what was the other point you were making?
[02:55:24.210 --> 02:55:26.612]  I was just talking to Danish media.
[02:55:26.612 --> 02:55:29.494]  It's a mainstream channel, quite big here, earlier.
[02:55:29.494 --> 02:55:36.839]  And this woman, this reporter, was saying that they're in regular contact with the organisers and some of the Bilderberg members.
[02:55:36.839 --> 02:55:41.743]  Made it quite apparent that they were managing the coverage with this Danish TV channel.
[02:55:41.743 --> 02:55:44.165]  So I just stress the point that, you know, they do have power.
[02:55:44.165 --> 02:55:44.945]  This is important.
[02:55:44.945 --> 02:55:47.007]  This is bigger than Davos in terms of influence.
[02:55:47.916 --> 02:55:55.059]  And, uh, she made it clear that they were working together with the Danish media to manage the coverage of this event, so I found that interesting.
[02:55:55.059 --> 02:56:03.403]  They are talking to the protesters, though, so they are trying to give it, uh, both sides a voice, but I found that interesting that she would say that.
[02:56:03.403 --> 02:56:05.123]  Any other points that you're gonna wish you'd made?
[02:56:05.123 --> 02:56:06.424]  Well, I'll let you go here in about a minute.
[02:56:07.921 --> 02:56:12.546]  No, just the photos of them looking out the windows as they're on real Alex Jones Twitter.
[02:56:12.546 --> 02:56:14.949]  I zoomed in, so you should be able to see them on there.
[02:56:14.949 --> 02:56:15.850]  Oh, great job, Paul.
[02:56:15.850 --> 02:56:18.032]  I didn't even know that, in between all the interviews and other work.
[02:56:18.032 --> 02:56:19.774]  Well, I salute you and the crew.
[02:56:19.774 --> 02:56:23.999]  You guys are definitely getting a bonus for this one, and keep doing it, Watson.
[02:56:23.999 --> 02:56:24.560]  Alright, thanks, Alex.
[02:56:25.419 --> 02:56:32.201]  Maybe while I take these calls, we can show the real Alex Jones Twitter photos, the latest ones, and show the TV viewers some of that.
[02:56:32.201 --> 02:56:34.381]  Let's jam in a call right now.
[02:56:34.381 --> 02:56:37.902]  He hadn't been holding the longest, but I gotta talk to Al-Qaeda.
[02:56:37.902 --> 02:56:39.983]  Or I should say Al-C-I-A-da.
[02:56:39.983 --> 02:56:43.203]  Hey, you're getting funded by Obama to blow up churches everywhere.
[02:56:43.203 --> 02:56:44.224]  How you doing?
[02:56:44.224 --> 02:56:45.264]  I guess I'm the real terrorist.
[02:56:45.264 --> 02:56:46.524]  I'm a tea partier.
[02:56:46.524 --> 02:56:48.065]  A proto-tea partier.
[02:56:48.065 --> 02:56:49.925]  How you doing, Al-Qaeda, in Georgia?
[02:56:50.285 --> 02:56:51.446]  I'm doing great, Alex.
[02:56:51.446 --> 02:56:56.931]  I talked to you about four years ago, and you asked if I work for the government.
[02:56:56.931 --> 02:56:59.973]  I said no, but I am definitely white al-Qaeda.
[02:56:59.973 --> 02:57:06.078]  Oh, well they have been segwaying on to the white males being the main terror threat, so I get your joke.
[02:57:06.078 --> 02:57:07.500]  Now I understand.
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:08.260]  Exactly.
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:16.887]  Now, our lovely mayor out here in Atlanta is there with Paul, and I was very glad to hear that.
[02:57:18.559 --> 02:57:19.840]  That's a joke, of course.
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:23.061]  But what I called in about was the awakening.
[02:57:23.061 --> 02:57:30.564]  The last time I talked to you, you were asking, what is it going to take for people to wake up?
[02:57:30.564 --> 02:57:40.129]  And what I told you was that it's going to take them individually being affected by our system in some way.
[02:57:40.129 --> 02:57:42.650]  Now, they're doing enough
[02:57:44.079 --> 02:57:47.581]  That sooner or later, they're gonna wake up everybody.
[02:57:47.581 --> 02:57:54.084]  And that's why they got the police state in place, so they won't have a civil war, which is an even bigger crisis to give them more power.
[02:57:54.084 --> 02:57:55.805]  And I think they've overcooked the goose.
[02:57:55.805 --> 02:57:57.346]  I don't think it's gonna work for them.
[02:57:57.346 --> 02:58:00.468]  I think their program is half-baked on a lot of levels.
[02:58:00.468 --> 02:58:02.889]  Man, everybody's already waking up.
[02:58:02.889 --> 02:58:08.432]  What's gonna happen when they just do something and everybody just... You can't hide it anymore.
[02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:15.164]  So, I don't think they have a chance.
[02:58:15.164 --> 02:58:17.767]  I think the Awakening is here, and we're gonna beat them.
[02:58:18.123 --> 02:58:19.303]  Well done!
[02:58:19.303 --> 02:58:19.883]  I agree.
[02:58:19.883 --> 02:58:28.666]  That's a good way to end the main transmission and all of our wondrous AM and FM affiliates out there that everyone should support and sponsor and support the sponsors and spread the word about.
[02:58:28.666 --> 02:58:29.886]  We're going to go to overdrive.
[02:58:29.886 --> 02:58:30.406]  Five minutes.
[02:58:30.406 --> 02:58:31.087]  It's internet only.
[02:58:31.087 --> 02:58:32.167]  Some stations carry it.
[02:58:32.167 --> 02:58:33.847]  Take a few more calls straight ahead.
[02:58:33.847 --> 02:58:38.068]  InfoWars.com forward slash show or PrismPlanet.tv to find that feed.
[02:58:38.068 --> 02:58:42.870]  And the nightly news is tonight, 7 o'clock, we'll have a roundup of all the Bill DeMark news.
[02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:44.150]  Great job to the crew.
[02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:44.790]  Thank you, Lord.
[02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:45.790]  We'll be back.
[02:58:45.790 --> 02:58:46.291]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.697 --> 02:58:51.758]  I don't know what it is.
[02:58:51.758 --> 02:58:53.639]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:58:53.639 --> 02:58:57.741]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:58:57.741 --> 02:58:59.342]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:58:59.342 --> 02:59:01.304]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:59:01.304 --> 02:59:02.665]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:59:02.665 --> 02:59:05.406]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[02:59:05.406 --> 02:59:10.830]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminator water supplies.
[02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:15.873]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:59:15.873 --> 02:59:18.575]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:59:18.575 --> 02:59:19.015]  Look it up.
[02:59:19.255 --> 02:59:26.116]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[03:00:10.498 --> 03:00:12.099]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.099 --> 03:00:13.639]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.639 --> 03:00:17.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:22.222]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.222 --> 03:00:32.105]  You know, 15 years ago I was called a kook for reading MIT documents that were public on air about them already testing brain chips on troops to augment activity but also treat PTSD, you name it.
[03:00:32.105 --> 03:00:33.285]  I was called an insane person.
[03:00:34.025 --> 03:00:39.608]  Even when I had family that said they were being microchipped with tracker chips and special forces, but that I couldn't say the name.
[03:00:39.608 --> 03:00:40.949]  People said it wasn't true.
[03:00:40.949 --> 03:00:42.290]  Now that's all admitted.
[03:00:42.290 --> 03:00:45.071]  The military is building brain chips to treat PTSD.
[03:00:45.071 --> 03:00:46.332]  That's from Defense One.
[03:00:46.332 --> 03:00:50.714]  We can punch up my computer and folks can see that for themselves.
[03:00:50.714 --> 03:00:51.394]  Here's another one.
[03:00:51.394 --> 03:00:56.177]  Biden challenges graduating Air Force Academy cadets to create a new world order.
[03:00:56.177 --> 03:00:59.839]  When they say new world order, they mean a global corporate military.
[03:00:59.839 --> 03:01:01.400]  As the cadets smoke cigars.
[03:01:02.890 --> 03:01:07.093]  I'm prepared to have their whole world destroyed by the global technocrats.
[03:01:07.093 --> 03:01:08.894]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:08.894 --> 03:01:10.795]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:01:10.795 --> 03:01:12.656]  Oh, I'm sorry, we have the clip of Biden.
[03:01:12.656 --> 03:01:17.639]  Why should I just read you the headline out of Stars and Stripes when I can play you the clip?
[03:01:17.639 --> 03:01:21.082]  Because the New York Times will say this clip doesn't exist if we don't play the clip.
[03:01:21.082 --> 03:01:21.542]  Here it is.
[03:01:21.542 --> 03:01:30.888]  I believe we, and particularly you, your class, has an incredible window of opportunity to lead in shaping
[03:01:31.897 --> 03:01:35.420]  A new world order for the 21st century.
[03:01:35.420 --> 03:01:36.562]  Out of these troubled times.
[03:01:36.562 --> 03:01:38.123]  In a way consistent.
[03:01:38.123 --> 03:01:39.204]  A new world order for marriage.
[03:01:39.204 --> 03:01:42.808]  For the American interest and the common interest.
[03:01:42.808 --> 03:01:43.869]  Oh yeah, the common interest.
[03:01:43.869 --> 03:01:44.329]  You care about it.
[03:01:44.329 --> 03:01:45.450]  Think of the possibilities.
[03:01:45.450 --> 03:01:47.092]  Death panels, yeah.
[03:01:47.092 --> 03:01:49.274]  For the first time in history.
[03:01:49.274 --> 03:01:50.635]  That's enough of him.
[03:01:50.635 --> 03:01:53.678]  Let's talk to Damien in Indiana.
[03:01:53.678 --> 03:01:54.399]  You're on the air.
[03:01:54.399 --> 03:01:55.300]  Thank you for holding.
[03:01:56.306 --> 03:02:01.415]  Hi, um, first of all, you got great taste in music from, uh, Rage Against the Machine to Jimmy Dean.
[03:02:01.415 --> 03:02:02.337]  I thought that was pretty good.
[03:02:03.551 --> 03:02:14.201]  And I feel like I've got about 45 minutes worth of stuff to talk to you about, but I do want to say that you're giving the right advice for older adults to stay active.
[03:02:14.201 --> 03:02:15.242]  That's the field I'm in.
[03:02:15.242 --> 03:02:16.083]  I'm a Ph.D.
[03:02:16.083 --> 03:02:17.064]  in that area.
[03:02:17.064 --> 03:02:20.507]  Been working with older adults for 14 years.
[03:02:20.507 --> 03:02:22.089]  Well, it's not that I'm giving good advice.
[03:02:22.089 --> 03:02:23.871]  You know, all the studies show it.
[03:02:23.871 --> 03:02:26.953]  Crabby people that have a bad attitude, your body just shuts off and you die.
[03:02:26.953 --> 03:02:28.275]  And that's what the new study says.
[03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.689]  Exactly.
[03:02:29.689 --> 03:02:37.632]  I'm also a member of Mensa, and I know you had a kind of a kook caller about two months ago or two weeks ago, but here I'll prove it.
[03:02:37.632 --> 03:02:43.574]  Your globe at the beginning of the segment, or at the beginning of your show, spins the wrong direction.
[03:02:43.574 --> 03:02:47.416]  I've noticed that myself, and we kind of like that.
[03:02:47.416 --> 03:02:58.000]  Okay, but I'm a relatively new listener, about a year or so that I've been listening, and I wanted to know if you could review how The Globalist started with this whole
[03:02:58.806 --> 03:02:59.707]  This whole idea.
[03:02:59.707 --> 03:03:07.018]  What was their... I mean, you'd have to guess at what they were thinking, but what were... Oh, they've told us.
[03:03:07.018 --> 03:03:08.320]  I mean, they've written a lot of books on it.
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:10.924]  David Rockefeller wrote one memoirs in 2004.
[03:03:10.924 --> 03:03:12.306]  They took the ideas and played them.
[03:03:13.302 --> 03:03:13.662]  We're good to go.
[03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:52.828]  And they are trying to extinct what they call morals, because they believe they're beyond good and evil, and that it's social Darwinism, and that it's their right to do anything they want, because the fact that they're dominant proves, in the scheme of evolution, that they should be in full control.
[03:03:54.139 --> 03:03:58.945]  And so, Plato said exterminate the underclasses, and that's what they want to do.
[03:03:58.945 --> 03:04:04.672]  But first they have to dumb us down, make us poor, and prove we're scum before they can kill us.
[03:04:04.672 --> 03:04:06.495]  And so, that's what's happening right now.
[03:04:07.449 --> 03:04:09.730]  Do you feel we have a certain window here?
[03:04:09.730 --> 03:04:16.132]  Because I think in two more generations, we're going to have a complete zombie population.
[03:04:16.132 --> 03:04:20.194]  No, no, I've had elites that say, I've had elites say to me, you should join us.
[03:04:20.194 --> 03:04:20.994]  That was a while back.
[03:04:20.994 --> 03:04:23.555]  I think the window's closed for me to ever do that.
[03:04:23.555 --> 03:04:28.337]  You know, these people don't want your help and you're wrong and we're right and the public wants to die.
[03:04:28.337 --> 03:04:31.138]  We tell them we're killing them and they want it.
[03:04:31.138 --> 03:04:34.919]  And so, you know, Alex, the fact that we're in control shows we should be in control.
[03:04:36.829 --> 03:04:40.953]  I just don't know why they don't just spray us with Agent Orange and get the whole thing over with.
