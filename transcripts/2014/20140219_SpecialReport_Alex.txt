[00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:03.244]  I'm down here on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin.
[00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:06.845]  We are asking students whether or not they know their Bill of Rights.
[00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:09.566]  Can either of you name any of the Bill of Rights?
[00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:13.767]  Um... Most of them.
[00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:15.947]  Not under pressure.
[00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:18.668]  Not under pressure.
[00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.009]  Do you think it might be important to know the Bill of Rights?
[00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:22.889]  Yeah.
[00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:24.450]  Why?
[00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.051]  Is it the first ten amendments to the Constitution?
[00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:29.891]  There you go.
[00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:30.635]  Yeah.
[00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:31.736]  Do you know the first one?
[00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:42.964]  The most important reason why you need to learn them is because your generation may see the last of them.
[00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:49.468]  So it's really important that you know what your rights are so that you can do something to hold on to them.
[00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.310]  Will you do that for me?
[00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:55.072]  Sir, can you name me the Bill of Rights?
[00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:57.209]  Not today, sorry.
[00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:58.169]  Not today.
[00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.612]  I guess America can wait.
[00:01:01.492 --> 00:01:03.074]  Ma'am, can you name any of the Bill of Rights?
[00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:06.536]  The Bill of Rights?
[00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880]  Uh... The right to... I'm not even going to say it.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.522]  I don't want to look stupid.
[00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:15.284]  The right to a fair and speedy trial?
[00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:17.486]  You must have been in court recently.
[00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:18.246]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.387]  I have experience with that one.
[00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:20.969]  Ma'am, can you name any of the Bill of Rights?
[00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.710]  Nope.
[00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.611]  Not trying to, you know.
[00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.919]  The right to bear arms.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.740]  The right to bear arms?
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.180]  What?
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.461]  Gentlemen, Bill of Rights, name any of them?
[00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:31.882]  Nothing.
[00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:32.602]  Go Canada.
[00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:33.982]  Go Canada?
[00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:35.943]  Okay.
[00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.244]  Do you know your Bill of Rights?
[00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:40.085]  Ma'am, Bill of Rights?
[00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.286]  The Bill of Rights?
[00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.647]  The American Bill of Rights?
[00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:46.707]  No.
[00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:47.727]  Shame on you.
[00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:48.808]  No.
[00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:50.742]  Okay, well I'll give you one.
[00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:51.302]  Which one?
[00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:52.583]  One through ten, just pick one.
[00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:53.723]  Five.
[00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:54.544]  Five.
[00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:58.326]  You have the right to not say anything if you've been incriminated.
[00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:00.007]  Zip it.
[00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.168]  Until you get a lawyer.
[00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:03.669]  Okay.
[00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.430]  Remember that.
[00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.411]  It may come in handy.
[00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:06.851]  Who knows?
[00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.612]  It could come in handy in the next twenty minutes.
[00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:09.653]  Okay.
[00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.535]  Number one, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion.
[00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:15.820]  Beautiful thing.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.841]  Yeah, it is.
[00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:18.682]  It's a beautiful thing being an American, isn't it?
[00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:19.603]  Having all these rights.
[00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:20.324]  Yeah.
[00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.686]  Well, shame on us for not knowing them, right?
[00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:24.128]  You're right.
[00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:26.470]  Okay, go revisit your rights.
[00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:28.132]  Bill of Rights.
[00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:29.613]  Name any of the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:30.975]  I have to go to class.
[00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:32.696]  Right, Bill of Rights.
[00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:35.459]  I really want to stop and talk to you, but I have to go to class right now.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.141]  Yes, very trendy.
[00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.766]  Can you guys name any of the Bill of Rights?
[00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:41.867]  You ever heard of those?
[00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:43.108]  Yes, of course.
[00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:44.910]  Love InfoWars, by the way.
[00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:48.072]  First is the freedom to speech.
[00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:50.575]  Includes freedom of religion.
[00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:57.120]  You also have the freedom against unlawful searches and seizures.
[00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:04.106]  Tenth Amendment to all rights not allotted to the federal government should be allowed the states.
[00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:08.663]  The state should have the power to legislate their own.
[00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:12.244]  Well, whoever's paying for your education, I salute them.
[00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.985]  I'm a true organic man.
[00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.605]  I'm an endangered species.
[00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:20.906]  Can you name any of the Bill of Rights?
[00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:26.188]  Can you remind me what the Bill of Rights is?
[00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:35.215]  I really don't think it's an issue for the government to have information, but at the same time, you know, is, you know... Well, how about this?
[00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:40.079]  I have the right to not have the government have my information.
[00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.300]  I have a Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.400]  Okay?
[00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:43.661]  Right.
[00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:46.884]  I have right to privacy.
[00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:52.268]  And whether or not you don't care doesn't matter to me.
[00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:53.048]  Personally,
[00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:55.273]  I don't want that in my life.
[00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:57.814]  And that's my right as an American citizen.
[00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:00.355]  So, they have no right to take that away.
[00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.836]  I mean, I can't argue with them.
[00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.557]  I mean, that's... The Bill of Rights.
[00:04:05.957 --> 00:04:07.017]  America, the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:07.837]  You can name any of them.
[00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:12.339]  Are you aware that you're paying for a college education?
[00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:19.759]  Be very aware, ladies and gentlemen, this next generation coming down the pike doesn't really know their Bill of Rights.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.549]  That means when it comes time to defend this country or defend themselves, they have no idea what to do.
