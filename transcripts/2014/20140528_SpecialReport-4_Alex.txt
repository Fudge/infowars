[00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:12.810]  The most humbling part of my job is serving as Commander-in-Chief to the world's finest military.
[00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:19.661]  And there's nothing I take more seriously than my responsibility to those who sacrifice their own safety to defend ours.
[00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:25.586]  That's why Michelle and I have made supporting veterans and military families a top priority from the start.
[00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.628]  Well, as you can see, the President's number one priority is veteran care.
[00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:37.271]  Now, a lot of people don't know this, but President Obama, back in 2007, was on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and he still is.
[00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:42.034]  I mean the specific allegations that I think were reported first by your network out of Phoenix, I believe.
[00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:45.276]  Uh, we learned about them through, uh, the reports.
[00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:49.279]  Uh, that's when we learned about them, and that's when, as I understand it, Secretary Shinseki learned about them.
[00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.143]  No, I find it hard to believe that Jake Harness as a president just now found out about this when it came out on the news.
[00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:56.045]  Hey sir, you can't come on property!
[00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:57.966]  Okay, we're just gonna get our vehicle then.
[00:00:59.087 --> 00:00:59.447]  We'll leave.
[00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:01.789]  What's that?
[00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:02.910]  We'll get our vehicle and leave then.
[00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.332]  We were just trying to- we're doing- Just stay off the property from me.
[00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:06.620]  I can't get my car?
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.883]  This has been a chaos of media.
[00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.825]  We have so much media.
[00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:15.790]  Sir, they are with InfoWars magazine, talk show.
[00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.871]  We're doing a report.
[00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.712]  That's what we're kind of saying.
[00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:21.976]  We're doing stuff on veteran suicides and how people think that they can help kind of fix it.
[00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:23.518]  That's all.
[00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:25.440]  Any media can't be done on property.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.602]  Let me get your information if you don't mind, sir.
[00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:31.297]  I just got kicked off the VA in Austin Center by police.
[00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:39.559]  And all I said I was going to do was interview a few veterans walking through the parking lot and ask them a few questions about suicide awareness with veterans.
[00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.040]  And they said I couldn't be there on property because of the scandal going on right now.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.680]  Now this says a lot about our government.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.901]  Instead of fixing the problem, they'd rather just sweep it under the mat and forget all about it.
[00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:55.082]  Today I interviewed two soldiers who gave me their accounts of mistreatment at VA clinics.
[00:01:55.402 --> 00:02:07.405]  You said while you were in the service, you were, you know, drugged quite a bit by the military, you know, excessive amounts of painkillers that would get you, you know, over time, you would be addicted to things like that.
[00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:12.586]  You know, give me a little background on that and what you experienced with the mass drugging.
[00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:20.128]  Oh, the mass drugging, one of my duty stations after Fort Campbell, pretty much
[00:02:22.034 --> 00:02:24.836]  I mean, you're in pain, they wrote you a prescription.
[00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:30.360]  You're freaking going cuckoo, or say you're feeling this way, this way, they wrote you a prescription.
[00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:34.423]  It pretty much was like, we'll write you a prescription for this, we'll write you a prescription for that.
[00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:39.927]  And there's people that I know that will attest that I was pretty much in a zombie-like state.
[00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:43.650]  They sent me to therapy when I was in Colorado.
[00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:49.835]  But the therapy they sent me to there was a civilian-run contractor, and at the civilian-run facility,
[00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:52.997]  They pretty much drug me even more and more and more.
[00:02:53.478 --> 00:02:57.121]  So that necessarily wasn't the military's fault, that was just another facility's fault.
[00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:03.987]  When I got out of the army, my friends can attest to this, I was a train wreck.
[00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:11.753]  I literally was a train wreck, a zombie, hated life, hated everything, didn't know what I was going to do, and it was just awful.
[00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:15.857]  I mean, you thought people were kind of coming after you for a bit of time there though, didn't you?
[00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:17.308]  Oh yeah, I did.
[00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:27.232]  It's normal with PTSD to have some paranoia, which I still suffer with right now, but the amount of paranoia I was having at the time when I first got out was ridiculous.
[00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:32.695]  I mean, I had friends stop talking to me because they thought that I was going nuts.
[00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:40.718]  The problem was that the medication doctors there, they were all about some pills just
[00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.651]  Here, take this.
[00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:45.858]  You know, it'll maybe make you feel better.
[00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:47.982]  It was nothing with side effects all the time.
[00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:50.027]  It drove me to do nothing but want to drink and...
[00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:52.979]  Pack on a bunch of weight and everything else.
[00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.100]  I mean, all the side effects one had over the other.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.101]  What kind of pills did they give you?
[00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.262]  Did they give you antidepressants, pain pills, things like that?
[00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:03.464]  When I first got out, they were giving me tranquilizer.
[00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:06.065]  I mean, just sedatives, basically.
[00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:11.527]  It's supposed to make you happier, but in essence, for a lot of us, it just kind of seems like it makes you more depressed.
[00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:12.988]  You weren't even seeing real doctors.
[00:04:13.048 --> 00:04:16.890]  It took me, I think, four months before I actually seen an actual psychologist.
[00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:22.434]  Um, and a counselor to help me with some of the, you know, the crap I was dealing with.
[00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:25.315]  And I got tired of it and I ended up moving from Florida to Texas.
[00:04:25.376 --> 00:04:28.737]  So, um, and San Antonio really isn't any better.
[00:04:28.858 --> 00:04:36.622]  I, I ended up going there for, um, I didn't know I had type two diabetes and I ended up going there with a blood sugar of like eight, uh, 90 something.
[00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:46.128]  So the VA in Gainesville never even called onto the fact that you had diabetes and you've gone an extended amount of time without even getting that taken care of?
[00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:46.908]  Yep.
[00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:50.854]  They told me, you know, you're like, you were like a soda pop away from a coma.
[00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:52.836]  I mean, that's a prime example.
[00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:57.058]  I mean, you could have been on a secret list like the one in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:08.681]  I mean, that's scary to know that these guys could have known or did know and decided just to kind of let that slide and just, you know, whatever, you know, sort itself out over time.
[00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:14.682]  Over the past three days, I've had the opportunity to speak with four separate whistleblowers that worked at VA clinics across the nation.
[00:05:15.222 --> 00:05:17.303]  Now, they all had something interesting to add.
[00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.604]  They made statements, racial slurs against veterans.
[00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:26.226]  One of the biggest issues with the VA care is the fact that we all know there's a rise in suicides and anxiety and depression.
[00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:32.149]  And instead of actually treating the underlying issues through new technologies,
[00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:45.765]  They just hand out pills.
[00:05:46.606 --> 00:05:52.588]  And they hand out so much medication at the VA that at the VA, pills have become a currency.
[00:05:53.308 --> 00:05:59.130]  And veterans get arrested or they get detained because it's federal property because they're just handed out these pills.
[00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.512]  I mean, I could go, I have a back problem, I could go to the VA right now and probably get a three month supply of Vicodin.
[00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:06.913]  In the private industry, that won't happen.
[00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:16.311]  And I really believe that they rely on veterans being addicted because they go to what's called the addiction clinic, where they receive funding per head.
[00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:30.741]  Is there a reason that a lot of these VA clinics, and I don't know if this trickles to you at all, but I keep getting reports from a lot of the veterans saying that when they go in and they have problems, they're being asked if they have weapons, how much ammo they have, and where they store them at.
[00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.842]  Now is that something that is a
[00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:35.283]  Across the board type question?
[00:06:53.388 --> 00:07:04.551]  Without that due process, you know, we would send them a letter basically saying that, yeah, you're not allowed to own weapons or, you know, it's against the Brady Bill or the Brady Law.
[00:07:04.732 --> 00:07:12.614]  You have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:07:12.694 --> 00:07:18.479]  Mainstream media is not going to do their job covering this story whatsoever, so it's our job here at InfoWars to get the story out.
[00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:23.743]  If you have any tips or anything like that, please email them to vets at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:24.123 --> 00:07:27.827]  And don't forget, our oath to the Constitution has no expiration date.
[00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:29.327]  The facts are in.
[00:07:29.527 --> 00:07:30.648]  The studies are legion.
[00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:38.270]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.891]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:42.651]  Simple.
[00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:47.252]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:50.773]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:53.015]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:58.661]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:09.311]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:11.453]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:12.174]  We're good to go.
