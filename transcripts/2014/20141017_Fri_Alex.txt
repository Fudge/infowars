[00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:10.798]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:12.359]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:24.710]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.475]  We've got Nigerians flying in, vomiting to death on board aircraft.
[00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:41.457]  The controlled corporate media instantly announces, there's nothing to see here, move along, as the CDC secretly tells New York City to get ready for Ebola outbreaks.
[00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:58.166]  Just about 15 minutes ago, NewsRadio 590 AM, one of our local affiliates, did report, and the story's gonna go up on InfoWars.com in a few minutes, we're calling the Health Department, that someone has been quarantined in Travis County, where the city of Austin, Texas resides, or is based.
[00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:08.652]  There it is on screen, Austin officials monitoring Travis County resident that was on flight 1143 with one of the Ebola victims.
[00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:15.734]  And now they're monitoring a top epidemiologist in Dallas who worked with the Ebola victims who may have Ebola.
[00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.475]  Meanwhile, look at this headline out of the Associated Press.
[00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:21.036]  They've been telling this for a few weeks.
[00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:27.299]  Africa stems Ebola via border closings, not allowing aircraft in, and quote, luck.
[00:01:29.747 --> 00:01:39.735]  South American countries, Caribbean countries, Asian countries, Middle Eastern countries, European countries, have all been sealing their borders in the last two months.
[00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:47.422]  But not the United States, because there's a war on common sense, and they've got to let it start spreading first.
[00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:55.909]  America is now a giant toilet, and Ebola is squatting over it, spraying out the virus with enjoyment.
[00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.847]  And this is all part of the total disdain.
[00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:09.652]  In fact, there's even an article out today out of the Guardian, also the Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:11.874]  Who do they think they are?
[00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:20.959]  The administration's Ebola evasions reveals its disdain for the American people.
[00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.102]  Yes, it's all about disdain and a war on reality, a war on common sense.
[00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:30.868]  I want to explain something.
[00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:39.756]  They don't have one, they don't have two, they have three articles in the White House-run Media Matters this week.
[00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:45.561]  And they have everything from the Washington Post to CBS News again this week.
[00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.104]  So many hit pieces, I don't even keep track of them.
[00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:54.589]  Basically saying I'm a fear monger, I'm evil, I'm bad, when all I'm doing is pointing out default common sense.
[00:02:56.516 --> 00:03:00.180]  Remember two months ago, I keep harping on this because it shows their complicity.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.770]  This could only happen here because the dinosaur media says everyone's crazy, or quote, deranged right-wing conspiracy theory.
[00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.635]  Obama intentionally wants to infect the nation with Ebola, Alex Jones says.
[00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:13.696]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:29.687]  Because when you leave the flights open and you bring Ebola patients here, and then you don't quarantine people immediately, you want it to get out of hand, so you can then have a big power grab.
[00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:39.872]  And they've had governors and senators and even the Speaker of the House say, shut down the flights, and it hasn't happened.
[00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:45.895]  Because you could never send the message, like Michael Savage said last week when he was on, that having a border might do something good.
[00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.230]  So, that's what's happening.
[00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.953]  And in this bizarro world, I wasn't being sarcastic a few weeks ago.
[00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:57.874]  I said, you watch.
[00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:01.516]  When this spreads everywhere, I will get the blame.
[00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:04.857]  And now it's happening.
[00:04:04.857 --> 00:04:10.300]  Imagine how they've overturned reality, how they've inverted common sense.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.302]  It's satanic.
[00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:15.323]  That's really all satanic means is upside down.
[00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:26.489]  Doesn't make sense, isn't productive, isn't wholesome, isn't prosperous, isn't honorable, isn't fun.
[00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:29.151]  The media and the culture sells, you know, evil like it's fun.
[00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:31.473]  No, it's not fun.
[00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:32.933]  Not real evil.
[00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:35.175]  The churches harp all day about, you know, sex or
[00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:38.896]  The wrong kind of music or something like that.
[00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:50.124]  While meanwhile they, you know, endorse killing a million Iraqis, aborting 50 million babies, NSA spying, government shooting little kids up with vaccines, brain damaging them en masse.
[00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:54.667]  But they can sit up there like Pharisees and say, look at that woman in a short skirt.
[00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:55.828]  She's evil.
[00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:56.648]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:57.049]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.287]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:08.411]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:14.694]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:14.694 --> 00:05:18.276]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:22.619]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:27.942]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:05:27.942 --> 00:05:28.962]  Not our iodine.
[00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:32.765]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.306]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:03.506]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:11.752]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:11.752 --> 00:06:17.156]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:19.698]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:33.766]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:38.049]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.830]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:47.696]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:48.837]  But for how long?
[00:06:48.837 --> 00:06:55.482]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:58.284]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:09.596]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:19.543]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:19.543 --> 00:07:22.465]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:22.725]  I think?
[00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:37.882]  We're good.
[00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.673]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:17.494]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:23.838]  We are transmitting from Austin, Texas, close to the epicenter of the North American Ebola outbreak.
[00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:43.364]  Worldwide on this Friday the 17th day of October 2014 edition and this upcoming Halloween May have some ghoulish horror characters that aren't fiction ladies and gentlemen if
[00:08:44.673 --> 00:09:05.141]  The allowed spread of Ebola continues in the United States and if the West African flights continue with over 150 people a day pouring in with visas issued to them out of countries that are literally collapsing.
[00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:15.379]  In fact, the news is so important today that I have cancelled some of the guests, cleared the decks for three hours on this Friday edition.
[00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:26.708]  We're going to have reporters Anthony Gucciardi and Paul Joseph Watson, who's extended his stay from London here in the United States, are going to be in Dallas reporting.
[00:09:28.373 --> 00:09:31.996]  We now have breaking from NewsRadio 590 AM.
[00:09:31.996 --> 00:09:34.678]  We'll link this up on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:44.105]  UT student being monitored for Ebola virus and someone else who was on the flight with the nurse who had it is now being quarantined in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:53.232]  So we'll integrate both those articles together and post them up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:09:53.232 --> 00:09:54.853]  I did some of the math this morning
[00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:12.237]  With the different aircraft flights, and how many people are in the hospital, and what we know, probably about a thousand people came in close contact with one of the two Ebola patients.
[00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:15.038]  Well, it's now the three Ebola patients, excuse me.
[00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:16.959]  The dead one of the two nurses.
[00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.200]  That's a conservative number, a thousand.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.741]  Let's say 50 did it.
[00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:23.402]  Spread it for 21 days.
[00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:29.709]  Now that'll be a thousand or so that have it.
[00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:34.593]  And then they spread it for 21 days and it's tens of thousands.
[00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:41.798]  And at that point, Katie barred the door with our compromised immune systems from all the vaccines that lower your immune system on record.
[00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:48.483]  The winner, all the other super viruses and super bacteria and MRSA that's just ravaging everyone I know.
[00:10:48.483 --> 00:10:54.567]  Everyone I know has family members that were totally healthy who go in to have minor surgeries and are dead in a hammer a month later.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:06.964]  So, long before the Ebola outbreak, I said back in January, when I had multiple family members die from flesh-eating bacteria in their lungs, basically.
[00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:12.446]  I don't want to go into details, but I was there at the hospital and witnessed what they were sucking out of their lungs.
[00:11:12.446 --> 00:11:16.028]  It was lung tissue.
[00:11:16.028 --> 00:11:17.028]  Get ready!
[00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:22.090]  Because my gut, but also intellectually, looking at the news every day, whew!
[00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.451]  This is going to be one hell of a winter.
[00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:30.711]  And if you think going out and getting a flu shot is going to protect you, I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you right now on Pluto.
[00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:46.875]  Now, here's the AP, not Alex Jones, and I only say this because two months ago, CBS News, The Washington Post, Geraldo Rivera, Fox News, you name it, they did it.
[00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:48.335]  Came out and attacked InfoWars.com.
[00:11:50.026 --> 00:11:53.489]  Alex Jones by name, Matt Drudge by name, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:59.654]  Because we dared link to the CDC's own papers from two years ago saying it may be going airborne.
[00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:06.039]  We dared link to epidemiologists and articles in Europe saying they believe it would come here en masse if we didn't shut the borders and shut down flights.
[00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:09.041]  And their answer was we were racist pieces of garbage.
[00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:11.203]  Do we get any apologies?
[00:12:11.203 --> 00:12:12.304]  No, we don't.
[00:12:12.304 --> 00:12:14.545]  And it's not about me being right.
[00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:16.927]  I didn't want to have Ebola here.
[00:12:16.927 --> 00:12:17.868]  I have three children.
[00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:21.388]  That's why I was concerned.
[00:12:21.388 --> 00:12:29.730]  If you've got the biggest outbreak ever spreading all over Africa, the UN has says between 400 to 1.4 to 5 million people will get it or die.
[00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.231]  The computer models show that whole spectrum.
[00:12:33.231 --> 00:12:35.071]  They're going to want to come here.
[00:12:35.071 --> 00:12:38.232]  Everybody else won't let them come here.
[00:12:38.232 --> 00:12:41.692]  It's not hard to figure out what's going to happen.
[00:12:41.692 --> 00:12:44.313]  And I just want to point out there's a new meme going.
[00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:56.523]  And John Bowne pointed this out earlier, that people are calling for Obama's arrest, the CDC's arrest, and so you guys aren't going to get away with it this time, creating a crisis, exacerbating it.
[00:12:56.523 --> 00:12:59.204]  Now, Joe Biggs filed this report yesterday with Josh Owens.
[00:12:59.204 --> 00:13:11.328]  They went out to UT, talked to 30 people, 17 of them, 17 of them, wanted to bring Ebola patients here from Africa, and they want to house them in their house.
[00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:15.160]  The video, the article is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.661]  Students signed petition to bring Ebola into the U.S.
[00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:23.383]  Students also agreed to host Ebola patients entering the U.S.
[00:13:23.383 --> 00:13:27.324]  Paul Watson's article, liberals signed petition to bring Ebola patients into the U.S.
[00:13:27.324 --> 00:13:28.205]  and house them.
[00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:32.846]  Students show enthusiastic support for the Ebola Equality Act of 2014.
[00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:37.148]  Here is the devastating report with Joe Biggs and Josh Owens.
[00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.191]  I think?
[00:13:52.950 --> 00:14:03.314]  Is that we are going to allow symptomatic, non-symptomatic Ebola patients to come in from West Africa into our country and then give them the free reign to move around and do whatever they want.
[00:14:03.314 --> 00:14:07.996]  We leave our borders wide open, we let everybody come in and get taken care of.
[00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:10.057]  We don't like to take care of the veterans or anything like that.
[00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.217]  That's just ridiculous.
[00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.018]  Let's bring these Ebola patients in and
[00:14:13.638 --> 00:14:23.968]  You know, there's not going to be an outbreak because Obama says there's not, or Ebola, and then the CDC director says there's zero chance that this is going to get out of control.
[00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:31.996]  So, you know what, let's see how many people actually agree with these puppets, with these global elitists who actually think that nothing's going to happen.
[00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:35.920]  Let's see how many people are, I don't want to say dumb, but
[00:14:36.883 --> 00:14:40.706]  Willing to actually sign this and allow Ebola to come into our country.
[00:14:40.706 --> 00:14:42.507]  Let's go check it out.
[00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.388]  Well, this is the Ebola Equality Act.
[00:14:44.388 --> 00:14:47.470]  What it's going to do is allow us to fly in patients with Ebola.
[00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.133]  So what this does is we're going to allow them just to get on the plane, symptomatic or not, fly on over.
[00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:53.774]  It'll be commercial airline.
[00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:55.295]  You know, CDC says you're not going to get it.
[00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.596]  It's not airborne, so you're fine.
[00:14:56.596 --> 00:15:03.541]  You know, a lot of people out here are being racist, saying that we should just like shut down flights and not allow people to come in here to our country with Ebola.
[00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:04.842]  I mean, that's pretty ridiculous, right?
[00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:06.463]  We have better medical facilities, don't we?
[00:15:07.163 --> 00:15:08.503]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:15:08.503 --> 00:15:11.684]  Can you believe all these people that say we should just stop flights from West Africa?
[00:15:11.684 --> 00:15:12.764]  Yeah, I think it's insane.
[00:15:12.764 --> 00:15:18.565]  I mean, I get their concerns and everything, but... I mean, the CDC knows exactly what they're doing, right?
[00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:20.766]  Right, and I also think it might be very racialized.
[00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:21.826]  Hold on, I don't want to touch that yet.
[00:15:21.826 --> 00:15:24.226]  I gotta sanitize my hands.
[00:15:24.226 --> 00:15:25.987]  I can never be too careful, you know?
[00:15:25.987 --> 00:15:27.087]  Yeah.
[00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:28.747]  I don't know where anybody's been around here.
[00:15:28.747 --> 00:15:29.747]  Alright, thanks.
[00:15:29.747 --> 00:15:32.848]  And we can get them some football tickets, baseball tickets, hang out.
[00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:37.071]  There's still people that deserve to be taken care of.
[00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:38.813]  That's what Obama cares for.
[00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:45.539]  We're going to leave the southern borders open too if they want to, you know, take a flight to Costa Rica and then travel up through Mexico and come in.
[00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:46.220]  They can come in that way.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.042]  There's no one watching anyways.
[00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:51.145]  President Obama says you'll be fine, so there's nothing to worry about.
[00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:51.525]  No, I know.
[00:15:51.525 --> 00:15:52.446]  I'm a nurse.
[00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:54.408]  I'm studying nursing, so that's why I'm like, yeah.
[00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:56.350]  Bring people with Ebola over here?
[00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.351]  Why does it seem shocking?
[00:15:58.612 --> 00:16:00.414]  I think I'll pass.
[00:16:00.414 --> 00:16:00.674]  Thank you.
[00:16:00.674 --> 00:16:02.075]  You don't want to bring Ebola to the country?
[00:16:02.075 --> 00:16:02.755]  No.
[00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:03.656]  Our president does.
[00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:03.997]  Come on.
[00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:05.518]  The CDC says it's fine.
[00:16:05.518 --> 00:16:07.299]  People with Ebola deserve to live.
[00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:07.800]  Come on.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.083]  Look, we're going to bring them into the country, fly them over, get them health care.
[00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:12.884]  Come on.
[00:16:12.884 --> 00:16:16.667]  Excuse me, do you want to help save lives in West Africa?
[00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:19.169]  No one cares.
[00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:20.510]  We're a bunch of racists.
[00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.795]  Oh, and if you initial here, that's just agreeing that you'll, you know, take one of the patients in and help them out.
[00:16:26.622 --> 00:16:27.422]  Alright.
[00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:28.043]  Okay.
[00:16:28.043 --> 00:16:29.463]  You're gonna initial.
[00:16:29.463 --> 00:16:31.124]  Hold that real quick.
[00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:35.345]  Nick, can never be too careful with this Ebola stuff going around.
[00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:35.706]  Oh yeah.
[00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:37.386]  Alright, thanks.
[00:16:37.386 --> 00:16:38.006]  Have a good one.
[00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:41.328]  So if we don't want to be a host, do we like not initial?
[00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:44.589]  Yeah, if you don't want to let an Ebola patient live with you, then just don't initial.
[00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:46.470]  There's a lot of people who do though.
[00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.870]  Okay.
[00:16:47.594 --> 00:16:50.916]  But I mean, then again, if you don't want to die, I mean, it's safe to say, yeah.
[00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:53.277]  And just make sure you guys wear a mask and stuff.
[00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:55.499]  No one else has gotten it with all the equipment on, right?
[00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:56.679]  Oh, never mind, those nurses did.
[00:16:56.679 --> 00:16:57.260]  Yeah.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.861]  Yeah, it's... Who knows?
[00:16:58.861 --> 00:17:00.241]  Maybe our government is crazy.
[00:17:00.241 --> 00:17:03.704]  So this is to have people come over here to be cured, or...?
[00:17:03.704 --> 00:17:06.405]  Yeah, to bring them into our country so they can live a normal life.
[00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:07.046]  Yeah.
[00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:08.807]  I don't want any more people to die of Ebola, do you?
[00:17:08.807 --> 00:17:09.687]  No.
[00:17:09.687 --> 00:17:14.490]  There's lots of people dying, bleeding out of their eyes and ears and mouth, and... It's horrible.
[00:17:15.316 --> 00:17:17.937]  But I mean, we'll bring them here to the country if they're symptomatic or not.
[00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:21.819]  We can get them sporting events tickets, hang out, let them move freely, have fun.
[00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.661]  We'll reunite them with their families, be administered to a hospital, receive the best treatment in the world.
[00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:28.122]  We've got Obamacare, that takes care of everything, that's free.
[00:17:28.122 --> 00:17:29.543]  So come on.
[00:17:29.543 --> 00:17:31.263]  Help save some lives.
[00:17:31.263 --> 00:17:35.305]  The more Ebola patients we bring into America, the better.
[00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:35.806]  Don't you guys agree?
[00:17:37.648 --> 00:17:40.789]  To receive medical care and reunite with their families if they have some.
[00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:41.549]  You know, like what Thomas said.
[00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:42.890]  So you want them to be able to come here?
[00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:43.750]  Yeah, let's bring them in.
[00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.811]  Obama says it's fine.
[00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:47.071]  The CDC says it's fine.
[00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:47.692]  Oh, you think so?
[00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.192]  Oh, yeah.
[00:17:49.192 --> 00:17:49.792]  I'm sorry.
[00:17:49.792 --> 00:17:52.193]  Oh, hold on.
[00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:53.674]  I gotta put my hand sanitizer on there.
[00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:56.095]  I don't know where you guys have been either.
[00:17:56.095 --> 00:17:56.995]  Can never be too careful.
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:58.901]  All right, good.
[00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:00.122]  I don't have Ebola then.
[00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:04.226]  All right, well let's take care of the ones who do and bring them here and let them have fun.
[00:18:04.226 --> 00:18:05.828]  Open up the borders.
[00:18:05.828 --> 00:18:07.310]  All right, thanks guys.
[00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.691]  Have a good Ebola day.
[00:18:08.691 --> 00:18:13.376]  The ones who survived got blood transfusions though, but the ones who keep getting these experimental drugs die.
[00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:16.900]  But you know, President Obama and CDC knows best.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.603]  It's not like they've ever intentionally done stuff to harm us, like push vaccines or anything.
[00:18:21.364 --> 00:18:21.624]  Cool.
[00:18:21.624 --> 00:18:23.225]  Make sure you get your flu shot, too.
[00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:24.825]  You know, I think it's racist.
[00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:28.666]  All these Republicans, all these people are saying that we should shut down flights from West Africa and not let them come in.
[00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:30.867]  Don't you think that's pretty ridiculous?
[00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:39.970]  No, it's like I saw this news where they rejected a kid from college because he's from over there and he might have Ebola and it's like...
[00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:42.549]  He's smart and he's studying.
[00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:44.571]  Why are you going to stop him from that?
[00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:45.192]  That's retarded.
[00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:46.574]  Let's let him all over here, right?
[00:18:46.574 --> 00:18:47.214]  Yeah.
[00:18:47.214 --> 00:18:50.658]  Oh, and if you want, if you initial here at the end, that's saying that you'll host an Ebola patient.
[00:18:50.658 --> 00:18:52.220]  You'll let him come over and hang out.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.902]  You take care of him, read him stories, you know.
[00:18:53.902 --> 00:18:55.444]  Oh.
[00:18:55.444 --> 00:18:58.988]  Oh, cool.
[00:18:58.988 --> 00:18:59.208]  Thanks.
[00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.131]  We'll get a hold of you guys when we bring the Ebola patients in.
[00:19:04.341 --> 00:19:16.591]  As you can see, I just spoke to about 30 people, and the most disturbing part of this is out of 30 people, I was able to get 17 signatures, an entire full clipboard, in less than an hour.
[00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:27.721]  These are the youth that are supposed to be going to college and taking on positions to help further our country, and this just blows my mind.
[00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:28.622]  And now, check this out.
[00:19:28.622 --> 00:19:29.282]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
[00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:44.718]  Ten, eleven people, eleven people out of seventeen, initial at the end, I don't know if you remember at the beginning, I said if you initial at the end, you allow a symptomatic Ebola patient to come live at your home.
[00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:47.859]  Eleven people said yes to that.
[00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:50.820]  You know, some people came by and looked at me and said, are you crazy?
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.600]  Our government's out of their mind.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.662]  Some people just laughed when I was sitting out there saying, hey, let's bring Ebola into the country, come on, don't be racist.
[00:19:57.662 --> 00:19:58.862]  You know, but there's still
[00:20:00.522 --> 00:20:06.167]  17 people who one day are going to become doctors because some of the people who signed this said they were in nursing school.
[00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:08.549]  Some were going to be doctors.
[00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:11.151]  This is why the CDC is messed up as it is.
[00:20:11.151 --> 00:20:17.116]  We have a bunch of people in there who have no idea what they're doing and they're putting American lives at risk.
[00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.018]  This is mind-blowing.
[00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:28.838]  That video and an article by Paul Joseph Watson is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:20:28.838 --> 00:20:31.638]  The video is perfect to wake people up.
[00:20:31.638 --> 00:20:44.802]  We also, last year, did a piece with Leanne where 9 out of 10, she talked to like 30 people, and 3 of them did not want to ban dihydrogen monoxide, which of course is the scientific name of water.
[00:20:44.802 --> 00:20:48.503]  They said, for the Earth, for Obama, we want to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:20:48.503 --> 00:20:50.223]  You know, arrest whoever has it.
[00:20:51.755 --> 00:21:01.961]  And people would go, oh yeah, I'm from Cornell, I'm a chemistry, you know, PhD or whatever, or I've got a doctorate in chemistry.
[00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:09.066]  And I agree, and they were just sitting there hitting on Leanne, not knowing what planet they're on.
[00:21:09.066 --> 00:21:12.148]  And that's why America is so pathetic now.
[00:21:12.148 --> 00:21:18.892]  Because it's not just the general public, but government and corporations are filled with people like this as well.
[00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:26.956]  Just a little less stupid, a little less dumb, a little less self-centered when it comes to not knowing any information.
[00:21:26.956 --> 00:21:33.218]  They'll usually have some scam or angle they play over and over again on sheep that are a little bit stupider than them.
[00:21:33.218 --> 00:21:36.779]  Who wants to promote a society like this?
[00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:38.279]  We showed everyone they talked to.
[00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:41.760]  30 people, 17 signed.
[00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:48.924]  To bring masses of Ebola patients into the U.S.
[00:21:48.924 --> 00:21:55.689]  and to bring them to sports stadiums and to bring them to live with families and stay at their homes.
[00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:59.371]  People are like, yeah, it's racist, we need to bring them in.
[00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:10.339]  You can tell these trendies, they stick your hand in a blender, stick your hand in a garbage disposal, you're racist, and a lot of them will run over, I'm not joking, and go ahhh, stick their arm in it just to prove it's their religion.
[00:22:11.308 --> 00:22:24.959]  Just like Michael Savage said last week, he's totally right, that it is a religion to keep the border open, a religion to bring in the third world populations, and they can do nothing to ever say we shouldn't have cholera, which we now have exploding in the U.S.
[00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:26.500]  compared to previous numbers.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:35.448]  We now have exploding bizarre liver flukes and flesh-eating bacteria and all sorts of weird parasites out of South America and Africa.
[00:22:40.376 --> 00:22:46.838]  It's kind of like boa constrictors getting dumped out in Florida and they're now killing most of the wildlife and taking over.
[00:22:46.838 --> 00:22:51.299]  It's the same thing with diseases, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:53.720]  We don't want to bring all these diseases in.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.241]  This is a real issue.
[00:22:56.241 --> 00:23:00.502]  They always go, oh, that's the classic thing racists always say.
[00:23:00.502 --> 00:23:03.183]  No, I don't care if you are German, Irish, or Chinese.
[00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:12.709]  Coming in here 110 years ago to Ellis Island, you sat out there for months to make sure you didn't have a communicable disease, and then when you were cleared, you were let in.
[00:23:12.709 --> 00:23:17.655]  And if you had something that passed, you were let in.
[00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:25.203]  But if you had leprosy, which used to just be the scourge of the world, leprosy used to just be all over Europe, all over the place.
[00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:32.131]  People would be down on the street corner begging, and you'd throw coins at them just a hundred and something years ago in Europe.
[00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:41.595]  In London, they'd be wearing bags over their heads in black, in gloves, with their fingers and noses rotting off.
[00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:47.077]  And they would still, they rounded them up and shipped them to leper colonies out on Caribbean islands in places.
[00:23:47.077 --> 00:23:49.318]  People say, well, that's mean, that's not nice.
[00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:56.201]  Well, at a certain point, you get tired of your kids getting cholera, or your kids getting leprosy, or your kids getting
[00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:04.662]  Smallpox, are your children getting Ebola?
[00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:11.684]  Drudge put out the tweet, self-quarantine, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
[00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:23.806]  When Ebola cases start getting up into the 10,000 or so in the U.S., if it gets up to that, I will self-quarantine my children.
[00:24:25.959 --> 00:24:31.907]  And I will have to work with my family, with who wants to lock themselves basically in the house with them, right on the property.
[00:24:31.907 --> 00:24:36.693]  And then I'm just going to stay here at the office, I guess.
[00:24:36.693 --> 00:24:38.435]  I've already had to think about that.
[00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:42.500]  I just can't believe how screwed up this is.
[00:24:45.094 --> 00:24:47.955]  Because if you get Ebola, it's gonna kill you 70% of the time.
[00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:49.956]  And that's with top medical care.
[00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:59.400]  Once things degenerate and break down, one patient had rooms stacked to the ceiling of bloody bandages and feces.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.421]  That was reported out of Dallas.
[00:25:01.421 --> 00:25:03.281]  One patient did that.
[00:25:03.281 --> 00:25:11.845]  Because the virus just keeps replicating and replicating and just displaces upwards of 10% of your body fluids and you just melt.
[00:25:14.645 --> 00:25:17.688]  Upwards of 10% of your fluids just become the virus.
[00:25:17.688 --> 00:25:26.716]  It just breeds and breeds and breeds until you pop like a giant blood-filled, vomit-filled, feces-filled zit.
[00:25:27.847 --> 00:25:47.624]  And I don't mean to be gross here, I just want you to know that they're doing this on purpose, and they're going to have made-for-TV movies about what a hero Obama is, and the heroes the nurses are, and how once it spread, Obamacare and the Feds and the Army stopped it, but they let it get going to begin with.
[00:25:47.624 --> 00:25:50.306]  The flights are still open from Africa.
[00:25:50.306 --> 00:25:52.168]  The border's still wide open.
[00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:58.897]  Here's AP, Africa stems Ebola via border closings and luck.
[00:25:58.897 --> 00:26:05.743]  Remember who told you to shut down the border crossings and to shut down flies from West Africa two months ago?
[00:26:05.743 --> 00:26:06.984]  I am no rocket scientist.
[00:26:06.984 --> 00:26:10.306]  That is the default, what you do, federal law.
[00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:11.807]  Common sense.
[00:26:11.807 --> 00:26:13.969]  Age old.
[00:26:13.969 --> 00:26:21.014]  If a country had an outbreak of the Black Plague, what did you do?
[00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:23.136]  You did not let their ships dock in your port.
[00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:31.838]  If a ship had anyone with signs of plague on it, they had to fly a white flag with a black spot on it.
[00:26:31.838 --> 00:26:35.482]  And if you tried to land in any port, you got sunk.
[00:26:35.482 --> 00:26:44.112]  And if you got caught coming in with plague and lying about it, they would take every one of you in and then they would hang your butt.
[00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:50.110]  Or force you back on the ship, train the guns on it.
[00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.091]  This is in naval history.
[00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:53.412]  That's why I've read so many books on naval history.
[00:26:53.412 --> 00:27:00.355]  And they would make you go out in the harbor and then start opening up on you.
[00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:04.577]  Because Europe saw about a third of their people die from it, so they were a little bit concerned about it.
[00:27:04.577 --> 00:27:11.019]  You might be too, if a third to half, depending on what country, died from bubonic plague.
[00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:14.341]  And by the way, bubonic plague is nothing compared to Ebola.
[00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:19.227]  Because you've got to touch it to get it, and then not everybody can end up getting killed by it.
[00:27:19.227 --> 00:27:22.888]  If you've got good nutrition, sometimes you can fight it off.
[00:27:22.888 --> 00:27:29.210]  Ebola, it's just unbelievable, and this is their October surprise.
[00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:43.596]  I predict Obama will sign executive orders on the power plants, will sign executive orders on open borders, will sign executive orders, he's already said he will, in the middle of this crisis, and they'll probably, they already had MSNBC with an article two weeks ago saying the Second Amendment
[00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:49.190]  Is the reason Ebola is breaking out, and I read the article and couldn't even understand their argument.
[00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.852]  I mean, even though it was a baloney argument, I couldn't even understand what they were saying.
[00:27:52.852 --> 00:28:08.859]  That's how mentally ill these people are, and committed to wrecking the country, committed to bringing in global government, committed to driving down the wages, committed to Cloward and Piven to blow the engine of the economy, and they're doing an excellent job.
[00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:10.940]  Obama's job is to bring the country down.
[00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:13.428]  That isn't rhetoric.
[00:28:13.428 --> 00:28:14.890]  That's their real policy.
[00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.872]  That's their real goal.
[00:28:16.872 --> 00:28:22.239]  And if you don't realize that, you're insane.
[00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:29.468]  People are concerned out there and quite frankly that's good because enough massive concern about this
[00:28:31.437 --> 00:28:38.062]  Enough phone calls to talk radio, and to mainstream media, and to Congress, and to Obama.
[00:28:38.062 --> 00:28:44.587]  They've got Boehner coming out two days ago and saying, recall, stop the flights, control the border, when he wasn't saying that a week ago.
[00:28:44.587 --> 00:28:45.928]  Now two days ago he is.
[00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:48.009]  You've got Jindal three weeks ago doing the right thing.
[00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:53.573]  A little bit of trepidation, Rick Perry said a little bit under pressure.
[00:28:53.573 --> 00:28:56.656]  You've got Senator Ted Cruz saying block all the flights.
[00:28:57.537 --> 00:29:00.899]  But this should have been done two months ago.
[00:29:00.899 --> 00:29:03.701]  It may be too late now.
[00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:11.907]  And they're going to go on the news, and they are going on the news, saying, you better take the flu shot, or if you've got flu symptoms, you're going to be quarantined.
[00:29:11.907 --> 00:29:13.068]  So see, that's where this goes.
[00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:22.335]  They let it get out of hand, then they start quarantining a bunch of innocent people who are already sick and sticking them in Ebola camps to breed it.
[00:29:22.335 --> 00:29:24.216]  Well, I got a little news flash for you.
[00:29:24.216 --> 00:29:26.298]  I'm not going to your Obama Ebola camp.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.602]  And the army is not going to be able to enforce it.
[00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:31.843]  And here's another issue.
[00:29:31.843 --> 00:29:33.384]  That's why they let it get out of hand.
[00:29:33.384 --> 00:29:35.265]  I told you they want to pull a civil war.
[00:29:35.265 --> 00:29:36.706]  They want to pull a collapse.
[00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:37.546]  Set nukes off.
[00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:38.887]  We got mission nukes.
[00:29:38.887 --> 00:29:39.948]  Biological outbreaks.
[00:29:39.948 --> 00:29:43.950]  I've been saying for a couple years, biological outbreaks are one of the main cards they've got.
[00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.291]  And this thing is staged.
[00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:48.893]  Any way you slice it, this is what it's like to live under these criminals.
[00:29:48.893 --> 00:29:49.994]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.994 --> 00:29:50.314]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.314 --> 00:29:51.515]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.515 --> 00:29:52.796]  It's going to be open phones.
[00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:54.437]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.437 --> 00:29:56.398]  They are on the run, so they're overturning the whole test board.
[00:30:00.393 --> 00:30:07.541]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:09.884]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:09.884 --> 00:30:15.190]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:20.116]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:20.336 --> 00:30:23.657]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:23.657 --> 00:30:27.738]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:27.738 --> 00:30:32.059]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:42.282]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:42.282 --> 00:30:44.803]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:30:44.983 --> 00:30:53.193]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.461]  The experts are clear.
[00:31:01.461 --> 00:31:08.585]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:31:08.585 --> 00:31:14.848]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:31:14.848 --> 00:31:18.430]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.792]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:28.115]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:31:28.115 --> 00:31:29.136]  Not our iodine.
[00:31:29.136 --> 00:31:32.938]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:31:32.938 --> 00:31:35.479]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:32:03.365 --> 00:32:11.626]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:11.626 --> 00:32:17.028]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:32:17.028 --> 00:32:19.568]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:33.543]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:33.543 --> 00:32:37.824]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:37.824 --> 00:32:39.605]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:39.605 --> 00:32:47.448]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:47.448 --> 00:32:48.589]  But for how long?
[00:32:48.589 --> 00:32:55.232]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:55.232 --> 00:32:58.053]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:33:11.084 --> 00:33:13.747]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:13.747 --> 00:33:16.749]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:16.749 --> 00:33:21.414]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.414 --> 00:33:27.940]  The reason we point out how many times we've been inaccurate and how we're demonized for being accurate
[00:33:31.474 --> 00:33:43.702]  Is so that people that are tuning in can go back and look up what we've said is going to unfold so that in the future, when we talk about stuff, people need to listen.
[00:33:43.702 --> 00:33:47.164]  Now, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:33:47.164 --> 00:33:50.666]  George Orwell said that, and I agree with him.
[00:33:50.666 --> 00:33:59.552]  Ron Paul, playing off that quote, said, in an empire of deceit,
[00:34:01.428 --> 00:34:06.311]  Telling the truth is treason.
[00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:09.533]  It's not a big deal to know you should halt flights.
[00:34:09.533 --> 00:34:18.579]  It's not smart to know you should send Ebola patients to Level 4 government facilities they've built and spent hundreds of billions on in the last 30 years.
[00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:25.504]  It's not rocket science that the Army went in on the East Coast.
[00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:27.565]  In fact, pull that clip up, please.
[00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.266]  In 1989, when Ebola went airborne,
[00:34:31.732 --> 00:34:36.555]  PBS reported and cleaned it up.
[00:34:36.555 --> 00:34:40.097]  The CDC doesn't even do that.
[00:34:40.097 --> 00:34:43.279]  FEMA doesn't even do that.
[00:34:43.279 --> 00:34:47.221]  Headline, flashback, Ebola goes airborne, causes outbreak in medical lab.
[00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:50.003]  There are defaults.
[00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.311]  Like, you see your neighbor's house on fire.
[00:34:54.311 --> 00:34:56.352]  You call 911.
[00:34:56.352 --> 00:34:59.054]  They dispatch the fire department to your address.
[00:34:59.054 --> 00:35:08.421]  It'd be like you call 911 and go, there's 20-foot flames shooting out of my neighbor's house at the corner of... Please send the fire department.
[00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:09.422]  Well, how bad does it look?
[00:35:09.422 --> 00:35:13.225]  Well, there's flame coming out the windows and it's pretty bad.
[00:35:13.225 --> 00:35:15.246]  Better send a lot of fire trucks.
[00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:16.207]  And then you hang the phone up.
[00:35:17.355 --> 00:35:24.979]  Hour later, nobody comes, and the next day you tell the media, yeah, this house burned down, then it burned down three other houses, and the fire department never came.
[00:35:24.979 --> 00:35:29.140]  They go, we don't do that now.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.542]  And you go, but you're supposed to send a fire truck, that's what we pay for, that's the default.
[00:35:32.542 --> 00:35:35.984]  And they go, no we don't, racist!
[00:35:35.984 --> 00:35:45.228]  You're like, but you are supposed to control the border and the airplanes, and that's what all the other African countries did, and what Europe did, and shut up, racist!
[00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:48.586]  I'm sorry, deranged.
[00:35:48.586 --> 00:35:59.155]  The White House said, through Media Matters, who they admittedly write the talking points and send it over to them, the White House is spending its time attacking Alex Jones?
[00:35:59.155 --> 00:36:01.898]  And MSNBC and CBS News are?
[00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:03.439]  Don't you idiots love your kids too?
[00:36:03.439 --> 00:36:07.103]  I mean, you really are villains.
[00:36:09.924 --> 00:36:16.389]  I'm not deranged because I didn't want Ebola to spread, and now look, it's right here where I live.
[00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:25.056]  They're quarantining people right here at the University of Texas, where students yesterday, that was shot yesterday and aired on the Nightly News last night, what you heard earlier.
[00:36:25.056 --> 00:36:30.960]  30 students.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.280]  17 of them.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.322]  Well, 30 people.
[00:36:33.322 --> 00:36:38.326]  The only folks that said no look like professors or UT workers.
[00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:42.156]  And one young lady.
[00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:50.140]  One student, it looks like, said, no, we shouldn't bring a ball of patients here and house them in our houses and read to them and take them to sporting events.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:37:00.306]  One student, and then it looks like, you know, 12 more UT workers said, are you kidding?
[00:37:00.306 --> 00:37:04.149]  But the students were like, yeah, man, it's racist, bring them in.
[00:37:04.149 --> 00:37:05.810]  Because you could tell them anything.
[00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.130]  Turn your guns in or you're racist.
[00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.031]  Okay, I'll turn my guns in.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.060]  Open the borders up, you're racist!
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:12.961]  Support Obamacare!
[00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:23.384]  Well, it has death panels, it was written by insurance companies, and doubles prices on average, and has 21 taxes, 7 of them on poor people, and it's horrible, and it's terrible, and it's rationing care.
[00:37:23.384 --> 00:37:25.204]  Shut up, racist!
[00:37:25.204 --> 00:37:26.785]  See, you don't have to be an intellectual.
[00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:32.687]  You don't have to be smart.
[00:37:32.687 --> 00:37:39.449]  All you've got to do is just act official, and act like you're holy, and you're good, because you know how to say racist.
[00:37:40.407 --> 00:37:42.848]  That's what this country has turned into.
[00:37:42.848 --> 00:37:44.128]  That's what we've become.
[00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:45.808]  That's what we've degenerated to.
[00:37:45.808 --> 00:37:53.250]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from Nova in 1990, one year after this happened.
[00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.391]  In 1989, Ebola made its way to the U.S.
[00:37:56.391 --> 00:37:58.372]  Residents of this Washington, D.C.
[00:37:58.372 --> 00:38:03.553]  suburb had no idea that one of the world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst.
[00:38:10.123 --> 00:38:18.886]  In a primate quarantine unit in Reston, Virginia, monkeys in one of the holding rooms suddenly began to die.
[00:38:18.886 --> 00:38:36.411]  Secretly, a military team entered the quarantine unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room.
[00:38:36.411 --> 00:38:37.351]  The crisis heightened.
[00:38:37.896 --> 00:38:41.617]  As monkeys began to die in a different room.
[00:38:41.617 --> 00:38:46.198]  It appeared that the virus was moving through the ventilating system.
[00:38:46.198 --> 00:38:53.399]  In response, the military killed all 400 monkeys, ending the outbreak.
[00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:57.960]  This new strain of Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.001]  Had it been lethal in humans, it could have been catastrophic.
[00:39:03.001 --> 00:39:04.361]  That's Stacy Keach narrating.
[00:39:06.246 --> 00:39:16.512]  And that's why, and by the way they are selling out as I predicted they would, especially the fake blood splattered Ebola t-shirts that have now come in.
[00:39:16.512 --> 00:39:18.313]  We'll show folks a document cam shot of that.
[00:39:18.313 --> 00:39:22.176]  Radio listeners can go to Infowarsstore.com and wear these proudly.
[00:39:22.176 --> 00:39:30.841]  It's the word Ebola with the Obama symbol of the rising sun of death and evil rising over the planet Earth.
[00:39:30.841 --> 00:39:35.064]  And it has fake blood splatters on it and on the back it says, Ebola.
[00:39:36.348 --> 00:39:42.700]  So on the back it says Ebola and on the front it says Ebola.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.464]  And that one is showing up very quickly.
[00:39:44.464 --> 00:39:44.925]  The other one...
[00:39:46.766 --> 00:39:49.188]  We'll sell out as well, but not at the same rate.
[00:39:49.188 --> 00:39:53.050]  And it's in the madein1776.com area, made in America.
[00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.493]  We have all the Molon Labe men and women's shirts.
[00:39:57.493 --> 00:40:02.737]  And all of the belt buckles have sold out, except the George Washington ones.
[00:40:02.737 --> 00:40:06.199]  I would have thought, I designed all these, that the George Washington ones would be the most popular.
[00:40:06.199 --> 00:40:12.123]  They haven't sold out in six months, but the Molon Labe belt buckles have sold out.
[00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:22.806]  So that's InfoWarsStore.com Made in 1776.com.
[00:40:22.806 --> 00:40:30.873]  We did get in a few thousand bottles more of the Silver Bullet, 30 parts per million colloidal silver.
[00:40:30.873 --> 00:40:34.336]  The InfoWarsLife.com brand of it.
[00:40:34.336 --> 00:40:38.299]  And it is about 80% sold out, so I really shouldn't even plug it.
[00:40:38.299 --> 00:40:40.621]  It'll probably sell out in the next hour or two.
[00:40:40.621 --> 00:40:42.082]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:40:43.749 --> 00:40:46.531]  A lot of other folks have doubled or tripled their prices of colloidal silver.
[00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:47.632]  It's selling out everywhere.
[00:40:47.632 --> 00:40:50.175]  We are holding the price.
[00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:51.936]  We are holding the price.
[00:40:51.936 --> 00:40:55.099]  Though it's costing us more to manufacture now.
[00:40:55.099 --> 00:40:57.521]  We have a large amount in transit.
[00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:59.743]  It's being manufactured right now at a major U.S.
[00:40:59.743 --> 00:41:01.825]  laboratory.
[00:41:01.825 --> 00:41:04.347]  And it should be here in two weeks.
[00:41:04.347 --> 00:41:07.069]  But we have this in stock now.
[00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:11.293]  Infowars Live Silver Bullet, 30 parts per million, colloidal silver.
[00:41:13.191 --> 00:41:23.426]  And we have the survival shield super nascent iodine from a deep earth crystal source, the strongest, purest form out there, not from Pacific seaweed.
[00:41:24.974 --> 00:41:26.755]  We have the original Survival Shield as well.
[00:41:26.755 --> 00:41:29.736]  It's a lot weaker, more palatable for children.
[00:41:29.736 --> 00:41:35.038]  You will, at least everybody I know, will detox within two weeks on this and you will feel it.
[00:41:35.038 --> 00:41:38.860]  And then after that, it's like a fog clears for me and everybody else I know that's taking it.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.200]  I mean, this is not a game.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.162]  There's a reason they keep lowering the allowance of iodine.
[00:41:43.162 --> 00:41:45.322]  That's even the type that isn't even that good in iodine.
[00:41:45.322 --> 00:41:49.564]  The reason they don't want you knowing about it literally, but the elites are obsessed with it.
[00:41:49.564 --> 00:41:50.885]  We had one of the biggest
[00:41:51.974 --> 00:42:12.142]  Makers of women's, well they also make everybody's products, but one of the most famous product producers, very well known, contact where we get it from and then contact us wanting to buy us out, but for hair care products.
[00:42:12.142 --> 00:42:15.663]  Our source and our contract for the source.
[00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:18.064]  And then we said, well no, we don't want to do that.
[00:42:19.608 --> 00:42:19.908]  I don't
[00:42:40.433 --> 00:42:46.618]  Available at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:46.618 --> 00:42:55.186]  Also what I'm doing to bolster my body's natural defenses is 70%, they debate, some say higher, of the autoimmune system is in the gut.
[00:42:55.186 --> 00:43:04.354]  A lot of it's in the skin, the mucous membrane as well, the sinuses, but it's the gut is the big line of defense there and the big buffer.
[00:43:04.354 --> 00:43:06.636]  And the intestines get all clogged up, everybody knows that.
[00:43:07.642 --> 00:43:09.327]  With all the gluten and the rest of it.
[00:43:09.327 --> 00:43:14.440]  The Oxy tablets from Global Healing Center.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.084]  Discounted at Infowarslife.com.
[00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:21.182]  Well, everybody I know that takes it.
[00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:26.146]  In fact, I don't want to put somebody on the spot, but somebody was just telling me yesterday how amazing it's been for him, who I think is out there running the board.
[00:43:26.146 --> 00:43:26.886]  I can't see through the window.
[00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:27.907]  The lights are so bright.
[00:43:27.907 --> 00:43:29.248]  Do you want to talk about what it's done for you?
[00:43:29.248 --> 00:43:30.229]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:30.229 --> 00:43:31.129]  This is CJ.
[00:43:31.129 --> 00:43:32.650]  CJ, you heard me talk about it.
[00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:33.931]  They tried to get me to take it for a year.
[00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:37.314]  I just said, oxygen that time releases in your intestines?
[00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:38.575]  I don't think so.
[00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:43.078]  And I've done other stuff to clean me out before that was pretty harsh and didn't feel well.
[00:43:43.078 --> 00:43:44.659]  I had no discomfort.
[00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:46.520]  Amazing what happens with it.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.081]  What happened with you?
[00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:59.985]  I don't really have much cramping or intestinal pain anymore and feel a lot lighter and healthier and don't have the urge to go to the bathroom because it does what it says.
[00:43:59.985 --> 00:44:08.431]  Without getting into details, it's just been a happier life altogether, just not having intestinal problems.
[00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.572]  By the way, if you just try it, folks, you'll be sold.
[00:44:12.572 --> 00:44:13.093]  I know that.
[00:44:13.093 --> 00:44:15.054]  It'll just get a bottle of Oxy-Powder.
[00:44:15.054 --> 00:44:17.876]  Because I remember years ago, being in a major Hollywood star's house...
[00:44:19.036 --> 00:44:23.257]  In one of their guest bathrooms and seeing it and reading it and thinking, man, that's weird.
[00:44:23.257 --> 00:44:25.278]  I didn't know that group that had famous Hollywood stars.
[00:44:25.278 --> 00:44:27.298]  You can look it up like six, seven years ago.
[00:44:27.298 --> 00:44:29.739]  Talk about how, how'd you get so skinny for this role?
[00:44:29.739 --> 00:44:31.279]  They said, oxy powder.
[00:44:31.279 --> 00:44:37.801]  He's got it, you know, trademarked, uh, proprietary it time releases in the intestines.
[00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.902]  And I'm just going to leave it at that dramatic.
[00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:45.432]  And that's another thing I'm doing to bolster my body's natural defenses.
[00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.112]  Oxypowder.
[00:44:46.112 --> 00:44:48.593]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:48.593 --> 00:44:54.295]  I did wear a pair of pants yesterday that I haven't worn in about two months.
[00:44:54.295 --> 00:44:55.775]  Yeah, they didn't fit.
[00:44:55.775 --> 00:44:56.275]  Absolutely.
[00:44:56.275 --> 00:44:58.436]  I mean, it's not just fat on the outside, folks.
[00:44:58.436 --> 00:45:05.658]  The reason your gut's sticking out in a lot of cases is, like John Wayne, they said, had 27 pounds of undigested meat in him.
[00:45:06.909 --> 00:45:11.292]  And I've talked to medical doctors that have done autopsies on people and they say it's unbelievable.
[00:45:11.292 --> 00:45:17.996]  I mean our guts are just clogged up from this unnatural diet and oxygen, put it this way, there's nothing like it.
[00:45:17.996 --> 00:45:19.456]  And I'm going to stop talking about it.
[00:45:19.456 --> 00:45:31.864]  If you'll just get a bottle of Oxy Powder, it supports the broadcast, the reporters, the team, everything we're doing here trying to expand at the InfoWars operation and it is revolutionary what it's done for me and my family and others that are taking it.
[00:45:32.794 --> 00:45:34.074]  And again, I don't know.
[00:45:34.074 --> 00:45:35.315]  I've never been a big vitamin guy.
[00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:38.315]  I've never been a big flush-my-gut type guy.
[00:45:38.315 --> 00:45:47.657]  They kept pestering me, almost hen-pecking me, Dr. Group and Anthony, going, look, if you'll just take this, if you'll just take this, if you'll just carry this.
[00:45:47.657 --> 00:45:49.117]  Nancy doesn't even, you know, own it or anything.
[00:45:49.117 --> 00:45:50.538]  He was just saying, you got to take it.
[00:45:50.538 --> 00:45:53.358]  You know, he takes it about once a week.
[00:45:53.358 --> 00:45:54.818]  And take it before you go to bed.
[00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:55.879]  It's the best thing.
[00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:56.959]  And they get ready to get up about 6 a.m.
[00:46:00.686 --> 00:46:04.307]  It's just that the elites all know about this kind of stuff.
[00:46:04.307 --> 00:46:05.647]  It's so revolutionary.
[00:46:05.647 --> 00:46:07.488]  All right, I'm done talking about it.
[00:46:07.488 --> 00:46:09.588]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:09.588 --> 00:46:15.890]  Now, I want to have totally open phones in the second and third hour today, and I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.790]  In fact, we'll go to them in the next segment.
[00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.311]  On Ebola, here's AP.
[00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:22.892]  Africa stems Ebola via border closings.
[00:46:23.925 --> 00:46:34.947]  Health officials battling the Ebola outbreak that have killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa have managed to limit its spread on the continent to five countries and two of them appear to have snuffed out the disease.
[00:46:34.947 --> 00:46:41.268]  And it says the countries bordering the areas have completely closed their borders and don't want flights in.
[00:46:41.268 --> 00:46:43.108]  Because that's common sense though.
[00:46:43.108 --> 00:46:48.969]  Countries run by African dictators do common sense type stuff.
[00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:52.250]  And they did things in Sierra Leone and others
[00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:57.343]  That have now stopped the expansion of the spread in those countries.
[00:46:57.343 --> 00:46:59.944]  They just said, you know what?
[00:46:59.944 --> 00:47:02.006]  Nobody come out of your house for three days.
[00:47:02.006 --> 00:47:07.068]  Go get whatever you need today, starting this weekend, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[00:47:07.068 --> 00:47:14.432]  Nobody comes out of your house unless you're somebody running a power plant.
[00:47:14.432 --> 00:47:15.053]  And you know what?
[00:47:15.053 --> 00:47:16.994]  People did it because they don't want to die.
[00:47:18.243 --> 00:47:20.084]  And it stopped.
[00:47:20.084 --> 00:47:21.685]  Not here, baby!
[00:47:21.685 --> 00:47:27.388]  They're gonna wait till it's really spreading, so government can then say, stay in your house, and train us to sit like a dog.
[00:47:27.388 --> 00:47:31.171]  When they say, jump, we say, how high?
[00:47:31.171 --> 00:47:31.971]  I'm gonna say it again.
[00:47:31.971 --> 00:47:34.453]  The flights are coming in right now.
[00:47:34.453 --> 00:47:35.393]  150 people a day.
[00:47:35.393 --> 00:47:39.436]  The Border Patrol estimates hundreds a day.
[00:47:39.436 --> 00:47:43.358]  Other than Mexican, as they're called on the fill-out sheet, from West Africa.
[00:47:43.358 --> 00:47:45.559]  They are pouring across.
[00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:46.480]  Pouring across.
[00:47:49.286 --> 00:47:52.081]  And just one of them could cause a chain reaction of Ebola.
[00:47:53.346 --> 00:47:59.268]  And hey, maybe you want your little kid to get it and bleed out a horrible death, screaming and begging.
[00:47:59.268 --> 00:48:00.008]  I know this.
[00:48:00.008 --> 00:48:01.209]  I've had enough.
[00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:06.891]  And I guarantee you, government, you out-of-control criminals, you are going to be held responsible.
[00:48:06.891 --> 00:48:19.515]  And the big corporations that sit overseas in Luxembourg and Monte Carlo and in Switzerland and in Grand Cayman, while you sit out... By the way, all those Caribbean countries aren't letting West Africans fly in.
[00:48:20.984 --> 00:48:28.769]  While you all sit there safe in your tax-free havens, cops are going to be dying.
[00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:29.850]  FBI agents are going to be dying.
[00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:30.770]  Their kids are going to be dying.
[00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:33.892]  How are you going to feel about that, government employees?
[00:48:33.892 --> 00:48:37.694]  And these big corporate heads that pull the strings and want a North American Union.
[00:48:37.694 --> 00:48:43.098]  They said they'd bring in the North American Union, not allowing a domestic response, but a North American Union response.
[00:48:43.098 --> 00:48:44.819]  They said they would use plagues.
[00:48:46.616 --> 00:48:48.697]  Terrorism and drugs.
[00:48:48.697 --> 00:48:56.359]  In the BAMF Canada documents from 2007 that are in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:48:56.359 --> 00:48:59.459]  They use the crises to bring in the control.
[00:48:59.459 --> 00:49:02.320]  800-259-9231.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:13.923]  First-time callers or medical workers, police, EMTs, you are the people that are really gonna be in the hot zone.
[00:49:13.923 --> 00:49:15.904]  In the jails, at the hospitals,
[00:49:16.877 --> 00:49:20.738]  Having to respond to people that have got to be quarantined.
[00:49:20.738 --> 00:49:23.278]  You get the short end of the stick.
[00:49:23.278 --> 00:49:25.959]  You get the shortest straw.
[00:49:25.959 --> 00:49:27.299]  Shortest straw!
[00:49:27.299 --> 00:49:31.540]  Shortest straw has been pulled for you!
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.481]  And now Obama wants to send the National Guard, totally untrained, into Liberia.
[00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:38.922]  Those are places to, quote, help contain it.
[00:49:39.795 --> 00:49:54.078]  And I understand the military, they have teams that are trained for this, and we've got inept bureaucracies at every other level, but no, you shield the borders, you quarantine the people that have it, like they've done, and we stay out of it.
[00:49:54.078 --> 00:50:05.960]  But see, there's hundreds of billions of dollars to be made fighting this for select corporations that'll get the contracts for all the medicine and all the garbage, because they're not giving them blood transfusions from Ebola survivors, or taking that and making a serum.
[00:50:06.994 --> 00:50:07.934]  No.
[00:50:07.934 --> 00:50:14.557]  They're giving them experimental drugs and vaccines so they can say, oh, it's safe and effective, and then lie and roll it out here.
[00:50:14.557 --> 00:50:15.877]  Hey, let me ask you that, America.
[00:50:15.877 --> 00:50:18.078]  Are you going to take the vaccine?
[00:50:18.078 --> 00:50:19.079]  800-259-9231.
[00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:35.105]  And we'll also talk about, I want to hear from callers, not just Ebola and your take on that and where all this is going and how do we hold these criminals accountable and can we make a big enough stink out of this to let the establishment know they're going to end up getting in trouble so they might back off on letting this spread.
[00:50:36.005 --> 00:50:37.247]  And why are they so arrogant?
[00:50:37.247 --> 00:50:39.689]  I don't think they're going to get away with this.
[00:50:39.689 --> 00:50:41.071]  It's not just ineptitude.
[00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:45.035]  I want your take on that, but what are we being distracted from?
[00:50:45.035 --> 00:50:50.422]  What else is going on while we're busy watching the big bloody Ebola or Obola?
[00:50:51.691 --> 00:50:54.232]  MSNBC said I better not use that term, so I better use it.
[00:50:54.232 --> 00:50:54.892]  Ebola.
[00:50:54.892 --> 00:50:55.492]  Ebola.
[00:50:55.492 --> 00:50:56.073]  Ebola.
[00:50:56.073 --> 00:50:56.633]  Ebola.

[00:54:15.697 --> 00:54:17.038]  There's two different versions of it.
[00:54:17.038 --> 00:54:24.503]  There's a long version, about six and a half minutes, a little bit shorter one that's about five minutes long, with Joe Biggs down at UT yesterday.
[00:54:24.503 --> 00:54:27.365]  Liberals signed petition to bring Ebola patients into the U.S.
[00:54:27.365 --> 00:54:28.506]  and house them.
[00:54:28.506 --> 00:54:32.529]  Students show enthusiastic support for the Ebola Equality Act of 2014.
[00:54:32.529 --> 00:54:38.693]  Yeah, they say you're homophobic if you don't go out and try to catch HIV.
[00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:39.694]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:54:39.694 --> 00:54:43.297]  In San Francisco and New York, for 20 years, they're called bug chasers.
[00:54:44.082 --> 00:54:46.563]  Gift-givers, gift-receivers.
[00:54:46.563 --> 00:54:52.227]  And I'm just waiting for the new trend to prove you're not racist, because it is sexually transmitted.
[00:54:52.227 --> 00:54:57.310]  It lives in the testicles for 70 days, not just 21, like in the rest of the body.
[00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.011]  So, prove you're not racist.
[00:55:00.011 --> 00:55:10.197]  I think Rachel Maddow and others should go to Africa, and she should marry an Ebola victim, and, you know, she should contract Ebola.
[00:55:10.197 --> 00:55:12.098]  I mean, to prove that we should leave the border open.
[00:55:13.154 --> 00:55:16.156]  I mean, come on, you want my kids to get it, Rachel?
[00:55:16.156 --> 00:55:18.478]  And Geraldo Rivera, I mean, I'm bad.
[00:55:18.478 --> 00:55:22.601]  Matt Drudge is bad that we said we should control the flights and the border.
[00:55:22.601 --> 00:55:24.823]  So, come on, Geraldo.
[00:55:24.823 --> 00:55:27.865]  Marry a woman who has Ebola right now.
[00:55:27.865 --> 00:55:31.147]  Prove you're not racist.
[00:55:31.147 --> 00:55:32.428]  And prove you're not homophobic.
[00:55:32.428 --> 00:55:36.331]  Go out and inject yourself with HIV.
[00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:38.213]  I'm not joking.
[00:55:38.213 --> 00:55:40.394]  Come on, you want me to have Ebola?
[00:55:40.394 --> 00:55:41.755]  You want me to have AIDS?
[00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:42.416]  You go get it!
[00:55:44.386 --> 00:55:47.328]  Not even kidding with you absurdist nuts!
[00:55:47.328 --> 00:55:59.157]  Come on, Geraldo, come back on the show and defend yourself or say you're wrong.
[00:55:59.157 --> 00:56:00.378]  Let's go to Will in Ohio.
[00:56:00.378 --> 00:56:02.700]  Will, thanks for calling in on this Friday edition.
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.181]  I guess I'm a little extreme.
[00:56:04.181 --> 00:56:08.244]  Do you pledge to find the nearest Ebola person and suck their blood?
[00:56:12.594 --> 00:56:14.115]  Yeah, you got a little phone problem there.
[00:56:14.115 --> 00:56:14.876]  Talk right into your phone.
[00:56:14.876 --> 00:56:17.417]  Okay, how's that?
[00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:18.658]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:18.658 --> 00:56:20.159]  Okay, I was at the doctor's this morning.
[00:56:20.159 --> 00:56:23.081]  We had a little conversation about that Ebola business.
[00:56:23.081 --> 00:56:28.885]  First of all, you know, there's only four hospitals in this country that can handle that level of infectious viruses.
[00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:36.950]  Well, I think the answer is let people fly in by the hundreds a day from countries that have it, and let Nigerians die on the plane vomiting everywhere yesterday, and everything's fine.
[00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:37.891]  I think that's the answer, don't you?
[00:56:38.885 --> 00:56:46.228]  But you know, according to that nurse, we're talking about that nurse, you know, supposedly touched her face with that contaminated glove, you know.
[00:56:46.228 --> 00:56:47.608]  And he said, now what happened?
[00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:50.489]  He said they didn't have any hazmat suits for him.
[00:56:50.489 --> 00:56:56.132]  So they just put him in like a containment gown, and they taped it to their neck with surgical tape.
[00:56:56.132 --> 00:56:56.992]  Yes.
[00:56:56.992 --> 00:56:59.293]  And when that stuff comes off, it takes skin with it.
[00:56:59.293 --> 00:57:03.334]  If you got the littlest pimple, scratch, cut, you're wide open, brother.
[00:57:03.334 --> 00:57:05.315]  Sir, why are you racist?
[00:57:05.315 --> 00:57:05.815]  Why?
[00:57:05.815 --> 00:57:06.215]  I don't know.
[00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:07.556]  I guess I just raised that away.
[00:57:07.844 --> 00:57:16.628]  Do you want to apologize to Rachel Maddow and Geraldo Rivera and Al Sharpton and pledge that you will try to contract Ebola to prove you're not racist?
[00:57:16.628 --> 00:57:19.749]  Well, first I want to see them go down there and marry someone.
[00:57:19.749 --> 00:57:25.091]  I'd get in the Hollywood suite there in Vegas, give it to them, all expenses paid for a week, then we'll talk about it.
[00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:33.475]  Well, they're all for being able to marry however you want, so how about the entire staff of MSNBC and Geraldo get together and all marry one Ebola patient?
[00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:39.432]  They can even shoot a video and sell tickets on pay-per-view.
[00:57:39.432 --> 00:57:40.953]  Well, I want to see it on YouTube.
[00:57:40.953 --> 00:57:42.333]  I can't afford no tickets.
[00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:44.073]  I'm joking, man.
[00:57:44.073 --> 00:57:44.494]  I'm not.
[00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:46.294]  They'll probably actually come up with that.
[00:57:46.294 --> 00:57:49.935]  But as far as containing it down there, you said you ain't gonna contain it down there.
[00:57:49.935 --> 00:57:52.836]  They reuse their needles and stuff down there.
[00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:59.077]  Well, sir, you just need to, we need to bring the Ebola patients here to prove we're not racist.
[00:57:59.077 --> 00:58:01.418]  That's what the UT students actually say, and I agree with them.
[00:58:02.756 --> 00:58:10.681]  Of course, you know that they'll be the first ones, that if you actually brought someone with Ebola, they would run screaming the other direction.
[00:58:10.681 --> 00:58:11.561]  I don't know, Alex.
[00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:13.102]  I think we got problems.
[00:58:13.102 --> 00:58:14.943]  You think we got problems, maybe, a little bit?
[00:58:14.943 --> 00:58:16.044]  I think we do.
[00:58:16.044 --> 00:58:17.965]  Well, the mayor of Houston's not worried about that.
[00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:25.309]  She wants to arrest and is suing preachers that criticize homosexuality, because she's a fascist dirtbag witch.
[00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:26.530]  How's that sound?
[00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:30.532]  Hey, on Sanford, Florida, where they have the Zimmerman trial, I preached against homosexuality for years.
[00:58:30.532 --> 00:58:31.293]  They got me on tape.
[00:58:31.775 --> 00:58:33.276]  Well, then we better arrest you, buddy.
[00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:35.838]  This ain't America and you keep your mouth shut, racist.
[00:58:35.838 --> 00:58:39.920]  We'll be right back, second hour coming up.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:40.841]  What you do in America?
[00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:43.423]  You keep your mouth shut and you worship government.
[00:58:43.423 --> 00:58:46.265]  You put vets on a death panel and you turn your guns in.
[00:58:46.265 --> 00:58:46.985]  Better clingers?
[00:58:50.034 --> 00:58:51.295]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:51.295 --> 00:58:56.277]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:56.277 --> 00:58:58.938]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:58.938 --> 00:59:06.001]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:08.982]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:08.982 --> 00:59:11.944]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:11.944 --> 00:59:13.965]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:13.965 --> 00:59:16.806]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:22.609]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:26.111]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:26.111 --> 00:59:29.212]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:29.212 --> 00:59:36.296]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.137]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.899]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.899 --> 01:00:10.660]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.242]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.803]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.803 --> 01:00:17.987]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.987 --> 01:00:23.512]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.512 --> 01:00:28.076]  Well, we're into hour number two, Bola, spreading nicely across the United States.
[01:00:29.261 --> 01:00:36.262]  The border's still completely wide open, and they're issuing visas as fast as they can to anyone vomiting at U.S.
[01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:37.142]  embassies to come here.
[01:00:37.142 --> 01:00:43.323]  The AP reports Africa stems Ebola via border closings.
[01:00:43.323 --> 01:00:49.625]  That's how they've stopped it spreading to other countries, but that's not how we do it here now.
[01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:50.705]  We're taking your phone calls.
[01:00:50.705 --> 01:00:55.806]  We'll go to the latest breaking news in the next segment, but let's go to Faith in California.
[01:00:55.806 --> 01:00:56.606]  Faith, you're on the air.
[01:00:56.606 --> 01:00:57.146]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:58.186 --> 01:00:59.267]  Yeah, hi, hi.
[01:00:59.267 --> 01:01:04.975]  Hey, I just, I had a new idea for a new t-shirt.
[01:01:04.975 --> 01:01:10.782]  I have a new idea that Buddy Holly didn't really die on that plane crash that Waylon Jennings, you know, got off the plane.
[01:01:10.782 --> 01:01:13.386]  He was sick or whatever.
[01:01:13.386 --> 01:01:15.809]  Actually, he got a facelift and is now Rachel Maddow.
[01:01:15.809 --> 01:01:16.390]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:01:20.642 --> 01:01:29.669]  I was thinking we should do a takeoff and have it say Ebola Care with blood spatters on it, a big pill that says Ebola.
[01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:30.730]  That's a great idea.
[01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:37.295]  I think I've actually seen some posters like that that says Obama in a mask and it says Ebola Care or Obolacare.
[01:01:37.295 --> 01:01:39.597]  That's a fabulous idea.
[01:01:39.597 --> 01:01:43.821]  Yeah, yeah, maybe an airplane, you know, going across.
[01:01:44.628 --> 01:01:50.592]  You know, on the back of the t-shirt or something with, you know, this is, you know, Ebola care.
[01:01:50.592 --> 01:01:51.473]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:01:51.473 --> 01:02:00.079]  Did you hear that audio or see the video we played earlier of UT students, 17 out of 30, wanting to bring people with Ebola to the U.S.
[01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:02.100]  and wanting to bring them to their homes?
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.601]  Yeah, I did.
[01:02:03.601 --> 01:02:04.542]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.542 --> 01:02:06.863]  Yeah, I think they should take them too.
[01:02:06.863 --> 01:02:09.085]  I think we should hold them to it.
[01:02:09.085 --> 01:02:10.106]  That's a documented signature.
[01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:16.422]  Well you know they're not actually going to do that.
[01:02:16.422 --> 01:02:18.583]  They all just want free handouts and stuff.
[01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:26.565]  They've shown in statistics fake environmentalists are six times more likely in a Canada, Canadian University study to steal and lie.
[01:02:26.565 --> 01:02:28.506]  It's all about how they're good.
[01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:33.047]  It's like people that spread stuff on Facebook and Twitter about give to a cause.
[01:02:33.047 --> 01:02:35.948]  They're something like ten times more likely not to actually give.
[01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:37.670]  You understand?
[01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:42.633]  And liberals, on average, are many times more likely not to give than conservatives.
[01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:44.794]  And I mean real conservatives, not fake ones.
[01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:48.016]  But that's okay, because, you know, they want us all to die.
[01:02:48.016 --> 01:02:49.537]  They just think it won't affect them.
[01:02:49.537 --> 01:02:53.920]  Maybe when some of them die from Ebola, it won't be so funny anymore, huh?
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.621]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:56.621 --> 01:02:58.823]  I think they've got a real problem on their hands.
[01:02:58.823 --> 01:03:00.884]  I don't think they really know what they're doing.
[01:03:02.543 --> 01:03:04.204]  No, I don't think they know what they're doing either.
[01:03:04.204 --> 01:03:05.985]  Great to hear from you, ma'am.
[01:03:05.985 --> 01:03:07.246]  Another extremist calling in.
[01:03:07.246 --> 01:03:09.488]  Geraldo Rivera will probably call her racist.
[01:03:09.488 --> 01:03:16.112]  Haley in Washington, because she doesn't want Ebola, doesn't want to die a horrible death of vomit and blood spewing everywhere.
[01:03:16.112 --> 01:03:17.053]  Total racism.
[01:03:17.053 --> 01:03:18.274]  I don't want my kids to get it and die.
[01:03:18.274 --> 01:03:18.694]  I'm racist.
[01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.995]  I'm just kidding.
[01:03:19.995 --> 01:03:21.356]  I'm here in Texas with the Ebola spreading.
[01:03:21.356 --> 01:03:22.196]  I'm just a bad person.
[01:03:22.196 --> 01:03:24.938]  Haley in Washington, you're on the air with a racist.
[01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:27.019]  Go ahead.
[01:03:27.019 --> 01:03:27.540]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.581]  This is Haley.
[01:03:28.581 --> 01:03:29.781]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:36.520]  I want to hear your thoughts on the new Ebola czar that was nominated last night.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.281]  Yeah, I see that.
[01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:39.461]  Well, Obama will save us now with a new czar.
[01:03:39.461 --> 01:03:45.844]  After letting it spread and turning off the default procedures to not let it spread, he's now going to have a big Ebola czar to save us.
[01:03:45.844 --> 01:03:50.486]  And I just think it's a total gimmick and disgusting and shows how staged all this is.
[01:03:50.486 --> 01:03:52.987]  Well, the way I see it is this.
[01:03:52.987 --> 01:03:55.668]  If you hire a secretary and she's not doing her job,
[01:03:56.175 --> 01:04:01.897]  You don't hire another secretary, keep the other secretary on, and then keep paying her, and then hire a new one.
[01:04:01.897 --> 01:04:04.518]  Sure, sure, but don't worry about that.
[01:04:04.518 --> 01:04:10.401]  Because this new Ebola czar has no healthcare management, no healthcare background.
[01:04:10.401 --> 01:04:14.522]  So Obama is now batting a thousand when it comes to doing the worst thing he could.
[01:04:14.522 --> 01:04:15.663]  So isn't that great?
[01:04:15.663 --> 01:04:18.204]  He hired somebody to run this that literally knows nothing about it.
[01:04:18.204 --> 01:04:18.864]  That makes sense.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:30.725]  Well yeah, I looked him up and he's just another Harvard Law Review guy and was the one that signed off on the support for the loan for Solyndra, which is now a defunct corporation.
[01:04:30.725 --> 01:04:36.027]  And his wife is an environmental activist and special assistant to the Secretary of State.
[01:04:36.027 --> 01:04:37.668]  Yeah, they want to reduce world population.
[01:04:37.668 --> 01:04:40.089]  Yeah, works for Holdren.
[01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:42.630]  Or John P. Holdren, Mr. Kill-Everybody.
[01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:46.012]  And of course, he also worked for Al Gore.
[01:04:46.012 --> 01:04:48.233]  So, you're absolutely right.
[01:04:48.233 --> 01:04:48.713]  Anything else?
[01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:55.198]  Um, well, I'd like to hear your thoughts maybe on just the Bill and Melinda Gates and their involvement.
[01:04:55.198 --> 01:04:56.799]  We've been doing a lot of research on them.
[01:04:56.799 --> 01:04:58.060]  Stay there, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.422]  We're gonna talk about this.
[01:05:00.422 --> 01:05:07.047]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.047 --> 01:05:12.191]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.191 --> 01:05:18.956]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:20.908 --> 01:05:24.974]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:24.974 --> 01:05:29.279]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:29.279 --> 01:05:34.026]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:34.026 --> 01:05:37.070]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.209]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:41.209 --> 01:05:42.989]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:45.870]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:49.951]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:05:49.951 --> 01:05:52.491]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:55.192]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:55.192 --> 01:05:56.792]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:57.573]  Got it.
[01:05:57.573 --> 01:05:58.373]  Others don't.
[01:05:59.864 --> 01:06:05.990]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:09.293]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:06:09.293 --> 01:06:11.055]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:06:11.055 --> 01:06:17.441]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:23.327]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:06:23.487 --> 01:06:27.430]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.353]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:38.779]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:06:38.779 --> 01:06:40.881]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:41.922]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:51.254]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:07:00.909 --> 01:07:08.035]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:07:08.035 --> 01:07:14.301]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:07:14.301 --> 01:07:17.884]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:07:18.024 --> 01:07:22.226]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:27.549]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:28.569]  Not our iodine.
[01:07:28.569 --> 01:07:32.371]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:07:32.371 --> 01:07:34.912]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:08:02.631 --> 01:08:09.276]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.276 --> 01:08:12.259]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.281 --> 01:08:29.386]  Latest headline by Adan Salazar at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:35.432]  Illegals wearing surgical masks in Border Patrol custody spark Ebola concerns.
[01:08:35.432 --> 01:08:41.178]  There's now been an Ebola quarantine of someone I think may have Ebola in Austin, Texas, breaking.
[01:08:41.178 --> 01:08:44.461]  Austin resident under quarantine after potential Ebola exposure.
[01:08:45.765 --> 01:08:51.388]  Another key headline, liberals signed petition to bring Ebola patients into the U.S.
[01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:54.189]  and house them in their own homes.
[01:08:54.189 --> 01:09:03.254]  Five-year-old child forced to sign a non-suicide agreement after crayon gun drawing, which then makes the kids end up committing suicide.
[01:09:03.254 --> 01:09:10.998]  They've shown even Nightline did a special, or 2020 back in the mid-90s that we covered, where it showed a three-fold increase in suicide at major
[01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:18.103]  Public schools around the country after they had suicide education, death education.
[01:09:18.103 --> 01:09:25.527]  You mean I go and I put a shoelace around my neck when I'm sad and hanging on the stall door and little girls went and did it in mass?
[01:09:25.527 --> 01:09:27.169]  Mm-hmm.
[01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:31.111]  It's all mind control, all screwing with the kids' heads.
[01:09:31.111 --> 01:09:35.434]  A video I shot last night, the truth behind the film Kill the Messenger and Gary Webb
[01:09:39.187 --> 01:09:40.028]  No Way!
[01:09:40.028 --> 01:09:44.630]  Outrage Meets Obama Plan to Send National Guard to Liberia to Fight Ebola.
[01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.412]  Matt Drudge Tweets Dire Warnings, Self-Quarantine.
[01:09:47.412 --> 01:09:53.215]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:53.215 --> 01:10:05.923]  And even the Wall Street Journal has come out and said the administration is incredibly arrogant with its Ebola evasions and reveals its disdain for the American people.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:15.085]  We're going to keep the border open, we're going to let the people fly in, even though the AP reports Africa stems Ebola via border closings.
[01:10:15.085 --> 01:10:26.012]  There's countries that, right by countries that have hundreds of thousands of Ebola cases, as it spreads, and they have no cases because they've locked the border down.
[01:10:26.012 --> 01:10:30.335]  But we can't do that here, and we're one of the only countries that lets the Ebola people fly over here.
[01:10:33.658 --> 01:10:35.400]  It is just unbelievable.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:47.215]  And liberals, so-called liberals at UT, 17 of 30 people we talked to, basically all the students, older folks that were clearly professors or adjuncts or instructors said, no way.
[01:10:47.215 --> 01:10:50.880]  But the trendies all went, I bring it here, it's racist not to.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.221]  I want to have them in my house.
[01:10:53.089 --> 01:10:54.930]  Of course, there's no way they'd actually do it.
[01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:57.311]  They're all about the fantasy that they're trending.
[01:10:57.311 --> 01:11:00.453]  The fantasy, they're gonna be racist!
[01:11:00.453 --> 01:11:00.713]  Racist!
[01:11:00.713 --> 01:11:02.594]  I just love to say racist!
[01:11:02.594 --> 01:11:04.495]  Racist!
[01:11:04.495 --> 01:11:07.617]  You're a white male, that's inherently racist!
[01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:16.682]  Look, that statue of a victory over Japan with a sailor kissing the nurse, she's in his arms, collapsing in his arms, it's rape!
[01:11:16.682 --> 01:11:22.105]  No, that's what a woman does when they want you to take them, is they fall into your arms!
[01:11:23.427 --> 01:11:24.947]  You mind-control feminists!
[01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:30.749]  Of course, they know that.
[01:11:30.749 --> 01:11:31.189]  They know that.
[01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:33.389]  They've had plenty of women fall into their arms.
[01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:33.889]  They just don't.
[01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:38.370]  They just want women and men fighting with each other.
[01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.331]  It's mind-control screwing with our heads.
[01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:42.431]  And again, I go back to this.
[01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.552]  The mayor.
[01:11:44.552 --> 01:11:45.612]  The lesbian mayor.
[01:11:46.818 --> 01:11:59.381]  of Houston is trying to indict, so she's suing and subpoenaing a bunch of preachers that criticize homosexuality or criticize same-sex bathrooms.
[01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:02.642]  Again, they just want to make us all go to the same bathrooms and mess with our heads.
[01:12:02.642 --> 01:12:04.322]  It's not about equality.
[01:12:04.322 --> 01:12:08.423]  It's about dominating us.
[01:12:08.423 --> 01:12:11.644]  And quite frankly, I don't get into the whole lesbian, gay thing.
[01:12:11.644 --> 01:12:12.044]  I'm not here
[01:12:13.737 --> 01:12:17.279]  The average person out there that's, you know, gay or whatever is a nice person.
[01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:18.139]  I don't know, hate them?
[01:12:18.139 --> 01:12:18.980]  Whatever!
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:32.928]  The thing is, is that the political people are a bunch of anti-gun, kleptocratic fascists that call themselves leftists that want to arrest preachers in America, in Houston!
[01:12:32.928 --> 01:12:35.169]  For their sermons!
[01:12:35.169 --> 01:12:36.850]  It's called the First Amendment!
[01:12:38.638 --> 01:12:42.759]  I don't like the Klan speech, like I said yesterday, but you know what, I'll defend it to the end.
[01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:46.440]  I don't like Meshuggah Laraza, the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan speech.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.380]  But you know what, I'll defend it to the end.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.421]  Because if they lose their rights, I lose mine.
[01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:51.041]  Got it?
[01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:53.641]  Comprende?
[01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:57.422]  You got that Grand Cyclops to the Klan people out there?
[01:12:57.422 --> 01:13:00.243]  Grand Dragons, whatever those names are this week?
[01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:09.000]  One time some Klan guy was in my face at a rally, he goes, here's my card, and it said, like, Cyclopsian Ruler.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.304]  Imagine, like, it's like a comic book, like a kid dressing up and saying, I am Destructor from the planet X, or whatever.
[01:13:15.304 --> 01:13:17.366]  I am Supreme Cyclops!
[01:13:17.366 --> 01:13:18.747]  Cyclopsian Ruler!
[01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:23.043]  See, I have a right to laugh at you.
[01:13:23.043 --> 01:13:30.886]  In Europe, they're now arresting people if they say, oh, Muslims feel like you've made fun of them, or you drew a picture of Mohammed we don't like.
[01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:32.206]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:13:32.206 --> 01:13:32.926]  No!
[01:13:32.926 --> 01:13:33.686]  No!
[01:13:33.686 --> 01:13:36.127]  No, no, no, no, no!
[01:13:36.127 --> 01:13:37.807]  Renaissance!
[01:13:37.807 --> 01:13:39.268]  You want to draw a picture of Mohammed?
[01:13:39.268 --> 01:13:42.229]  That's your right, even if it's offensive to people.
[01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:43.349]  Even if I don't agree with it.
[01:13:44.502 --> 01:13:45.883]  You want to draw a picture of a Jesus?
[01:13:45.883 --> 01:13:46.443]  That's offensive.
[01:13:46.443 --> 01:13:47.264]  That's your issue.
[01:13:47.264 --> 01:13:53.448]  But don't use government taxpayer money to pay for a crucifix in a glass of urine.
[01:13:53.448 --> 01:13:54.388]  Don't pay $300,000 for that.
[01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:58.471]  People say, oh, why are you for censorship in the arts?
[01:13:58.471 --> 01:13:59.111]  No, I'm not.
[01:13:59.111 --> 01:14:00.912]  Don't.
[01:14:00.912 --> 01:14:02.493]  It's like the Texas Art Commission.
[01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:05.675]  Three, four years ago, Machete came out.
[01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:06.556]  I was given the script.
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:12.752]  By a Hispanic gentleman high up in the production that said this is total race war garbage.
[01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:14.012]  It's being funded by the White House.
[01:14:14.012 --> 01:14:15.493]  That's now come out.
[01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:20.454]  He's going to launch a TV network all about race baiting, and he did that.
[01:14:20.454 --> 01:14:21.635]  I told you everything.
[01:14:21.635 --> 01:14:24.576]  And Robert Rodriguez came out and said, no, Alex Jones doesn't have a script.
[01:14:24.576 --> 01:14:24.996]  He's a liar.
[01:14:24.996 --> 01:14:25.996]  None of this is in the movie.
[01:14:25.996 --> 01:14:30.258]  Well, they cut a bunch out of the movie, but everything that they did put in there was the script word for word.
[01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:40.086]  And I pointed out, what is it getting tax exemption for when a pro-gun film was denied and a film about Waco was denied tax exemption?
[01:14:40.086 --> 01:14:42.407]  I said, give all films tax exemption.
[01:14:42.407 --> 01:14:44.048]  Don't have a political board over it.
[01:14:44.048 --> 01:14:51.173]  Give Machete a tax exemption, but you give libertarian and conservative films that as well.
[01:14:51.173 --> 01:14:54.615]  And Rodriguez went into a conniption fit.
[01:14:58.052 --> 01:15:00.793]  And I'm not going to get into all the stuff behind the scenes.
[01:15:00.793 --> 01:15:07.776]  And then it defunded, they defunded the entire program pretty much over it.
[01:15:07.776 --> 01:15:12.217]  But that was something Rick Perry already wanted to do, so I got blamed for it in the film community in Texas.
[01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:15.979]  That I, Alex Jones, killed film incentives.
[01:15:15.979 --> 01:15:16.619]  No I didn't!
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:20.293]  They killed it by making it discriminatory.
[01:15:20.293 --> 01:15:21.093]  You got that?
[01:15:21.093 --> 01:15:29.262]  Because if they can start making leftist and race war films and Laurie Conquista films tax-exempt, but a pro-gun film isn't?
[01:15:29.262 --> 01:15:30.844]  A major film doesn't come to the state?
[01:15:30.844 --> 01:15:31.705]  Or a film about Waco?
[01:15:32.918 --> 01:15:36.079]  And so they make it in Baton Rouge and they get the business?
[01:15:36.079 --> 01:15:37.920]  That's discriminatory!
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.280]  Just like in the lives of others, it's based on a true story.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:48.863]  The communists in Eastern Germany were over all the films, all the books, all the theater, all the starlets had to have sex with the guys on the film board.
[01:15:50.416 --> 01:15:59.100]  I don't want to live in a country like that, where you guys control everything with tax exemption for your people, just like they've got the IRS going after pro-life conservatives, libertarians.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:07.444]  There is a fascist war on anything but socialist, communist, kleptocrat, social engineering, fascist speech.
[01:16:09.497 --> 01:16:10.838]  Now, I've gone off on a jag.
[01:16:10.838 --> 01:16:12.279]  I said, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:16:12.279 --> 01:16:15.201]  This lady called in and I got going on other subjects.
[01:16:15.201 --> 01:16:19.864]  We're going to go back to Haley in Washington, then Shane, Austin, Aaron, Ray, and others.
[01:16:19.864 --> 01:16:23.526]  But here's the article she was mentioning.
[01:16:23.526 --> 01:16:24.447]  CBS News.
[01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:27.849]  Obama's new Ebola czar does not have medical healthcare background.
[01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:35.074]  No, but he worked for eugenicist Al Gore and Bill and Melinda Gates and his wife worked in all of it in population control measures.
[01:16:35.074 --> 01:16:38.556]  So, of course, we've got a John P. Holdren acolyte running things.
[01:16:39.844 --> 01:16:43.213]  And see, it's all about throwing it in our face.
[01:16:43.213 --> 01:16:46.160]  They'll have lots of made-for-TV movies they're announcing about how Obama's a hero.
[01:16:47.039 --> 01:16:53.421]  Because it's all about these narcissists being heroes, even when they're not, and did everything they could to spread the Ebola, as the borders are wide open.
[01:16:53.421 --> 01:17:01.603]  She was bringing up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and how they're involved with the vaccine with Monsanto, and that's a big question for listeners.
[01:17:01.603 --> 01:17:04.883]  Are you going to take the Ebola vaccine, even though it won't protect you?
[01:17:04.883 --> 01:17:06.084]  Probably going to spread it.
[01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:08.724]  It's going to be rolling out in December, January.
[01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.825]  So, Haley, go ahead and make your point about Bill and Melinda Gates you wanted to get into.
[01:17:11.825 --> 01:17:13.366]  Oh, great.
[01:17:13.366 --> 01:17:13.866]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:17:15.396 --> 01:17:25.603]  I wanted to see what your thoughts were about kind of using the World Health Organization as kind of a measuring stick to see what's going on with Ebola.
[01:17:25.603 --> 01:17:34.950]  And I was just researching that, and most people don't realize, but I'm sure you do, but don't realize that the World Health Organization is funded primarily by the Gates.
[01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:43.756]  And they pretty much just use their money so that they can kick out globalist decision-making for wealthy philanthropists.
[01:17:44.278 --> 01:17:49.841]  Yeah, they've taken over basically the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Endowment as the tip of the spear.
[01:17:49.841 --> 01:17:51.682]  They're the main funders of gun control.
[01:17:51.682 --> 01:17:53.603]  They're the main funders of open borders.
[01:17:53.603 --> 01:17:55.944]  They're the main funders of forced inoculation.
[01:17:55.944 --> 01:18:01.626]  They're the main funders of vaccines engineered into the food, of forcing kids to eat GMO.
[01:18:01.626 --> 01:18:06.029]  They're the ones that wrote the curriculum for what the kids eat under Michelle Obama.
[01:18:06.029 --> 01:18:07.109]  They run our lives.
[01:18:07.109 --> 01:18:10.211]  They're the ones taking over the public schools.
[01:18:10.211 --> 01:18:12.452]  Just every time you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole,
[01:18:13.715 --> 01:18:22.022]  There is his army intelligence dad who ran Planned Parenthood and was on the secret boards that's come out of the eugenics groups.
[01:18:22.022 --> 01:18:26.266]  And so Bill Gates was set up, given the IBM contracts as a front.
[01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:32.711]  IBM, his entire trust when Thomas Watson died, was to carry out eugenics.
[01:18:32.711 --> 01:18:34.193]  And the dream of Adolf A. Lois Hitler.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:35.860]  And that's all public.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.081]  Best-selling books have been written on it.
[01:18:37.081 --> 01:18:41.942]  You know, IBM and the Holocaust, and they run everything, and that's just the way it is.
[01:18:41.942 --> 01:18:43.423]  Show, roll your sleeves up, take your shots.
[01:18:43.423 --> 01:18:45.983]  How's that sound?
[01:18:45.983 --> 01:18:50.305]  Well, I just wanted to make one more point, particularly for people that live in Washington State.
[01:18:50.305 --> 01:18:53.986]  My sister's fiancé works at Harborview Medical.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:06.845]  And that's the largest hospital in Washington State, and she just informed me that most people aren't supposed to know this, but they had military officials coming in this last week preparing for quarantine for Ebola.
[01:19:06.845 --> 01:19:07.345]  Of course!
[01:19:07.345 --> 01:19:15.149]  And you know, so if you don't think that it's coming, you know, coming here, that it's just on the border states or, you know, in Nebraska or Dallas, it's not.
[01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:18.030]  And let's be clear, let's be clear, a month!
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:25.687]  After England and others stopped flights out of Western Africa, they let somebody in who had it and it's now spreading.
[01:19:25.687 --> 01:19:27.209]  They did it.
[01:19:27.209 --> 01:19:27.950]  Period.
[01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:28.691]  They let it spread.
[01:19:28.691 --> 01:19:30.894]  What do you say to that?
[01:19:30.894 --> 01:19:31.775]  Oh, I'm not surprised.
[01:19:31.775 --> 01:19:35.100]  I think we should just give them all Costco cards.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:35.761]  I think we should.
[01:19:36.744 --> 01:19:39.606]  Like people at UT said, give them all free tickets to the UT game.
[01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:42.087]  Let them go vomit on everybody's kids.
[01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:45.950]  We should all just give pints of their blood, put it in a big punch bowl.
[01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:51.073]  We should all just bathe in it and just praise Obama and just thank him for all he does.
[01:19:51.073 --> 01:19:54.155]  Thank you, Lord and Savior, as Jamie Foxx said.
[01:19:54.155 --> 01:19:56.436]  In fact, we'll play that clip when we come back.
[01:19:56.436 --> 01:19:58.197]  Just thank you for all you do.
[01:19:58.197 --> 01:19:59.178]  Thank you.
[01:19:59.178 --> 01:19:59.478]  Thank you.

[01:25:04.948 --> 01:25:16.454]  And the man who is the leader, the closer, like a closing pitcher, in the National Baseball League, Obama, is hailed as a lord and savior by the throngs.
[01:25:17.366 --> 01:25:18.406]  that worship him.
[01:25:18.406 --> 01:25:21.227]  Here's Jamie Foxx.
[01:25:21.227 --> 01:25:29.129]  First of all, give an honor to God and our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama!
[01:25:29.129 --> 01:25:32.450]  Yeah!
[01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:34.711]  Barack Obama!
[01:25:34.711 --> 01:25:38.532]  Barack Obama!
[01:25:38.532 --> 01:25:41.333]  He just invoked that word like open sesame.
[01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:43.353]  Everything good happens when you say that.
[01:25:43.353 --> 01:25:44.954]  You get an Obamacare.
[01:25:44.954 --> 01:25:46.074]  You get an Obama phone.
[01:25:47.233 --> 01:25:48.654]  And he gon' do more.
[01:25:48.654 --> 01:25:53.759]  And even though he's a puppet, though, it's what it signifies.
[01:25:53.759 --> 01:26:01.706]  So we gotta bring Ebola in, because we're... They wanna be racist.
[01:26:01.706 --> 01:26:05.629]  Think the other African countries that are black people not letting other Africans anything, they're being racist?
[01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:08.452]  No, they don't wanna die.
[01:26:08.452 --> 01:26:12.175]  But it's not that we don't wanna die, it's secretly we're racist, yeah.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.861]  That's really what I'm worried about.
[01:26:14.861 --> 01:26:19.303]  It's not my kids might get Ebola or your kids might get a horrible, excruciating death.
[01:26:19.303 --> 01:26:20.724]  I'm so angry right now.
[01:26:20.724 --> 01:26:22.965]  That's why I'm being sarcastic.
[01:26:22.965 --> 01:26:28.148]  That all these scum out there helping this happen are all aiding and abetting it, and you make me want to throw up.
[01:26:28.148 --> 01:26:30.009]  And again, it's not going to stop here.
[01:26:30.009 --> 01:26:32.311]  If they would do this with Ebola, what else are they going to do?
[01:26:33.496 --> 01:26:34.577]  Shut down our power plants.
[01:26:34.577 --> 01:26:36.058]  I know I say that every day.
[01:26:36.058 --> 01:26:54.290]  You start shutting down a third or more, which they've done, of our coal power plants that supply half the country's energy, boy, energy prices explode, the economy slows down, the standard of living goes down, and the country falls apart, while Mexico and India and China and everybody else gets to have all the new plants they want!
[01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:57.592]  I don't like being discriminated against like that.
[01:26:57.592 --> 01:26:59.734]  I don't like seeing my country shut down by design.
[01:27:01.909 --> 01:27:09.435]  I don't like seeing mayors trying to arrest preachers that read out of the Old Testament.
[01:27:09.435 --> 01:27:11.997]  In Houston, I'm freaked out by that!
[01:27:11.997 --> 01:27:20.164]  By the smiley piggy face of these fascists that call themselves liberals, like Mayor Lee Leffingwell in Austin and all the tyranny he pushes.
[01:27:20.164 --> 01:27:25.188]  He's going there with medical doctors with Harvard studies on fluoride causing IQ reduction and bone cancer.
[01:27:25.188 --> 01:27:26.890]  He literally flips the camera off.
[01:27:29.653 --> 01:27:32.996]  Literally puts his finger out and says, F you.
[01:27:32.996 --> 01:27:34.377]  And laughs at everyone.
[01:27:34.377 --> 01:27:36.218]  These are demons, folks!
[01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:37.519]  Demons!
[01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:40.862]  Demons!
[01:27:40.862 --> 01:27:46.106]  New Paul Joseph Watson article just went up seconds ago to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:46.106 --> 01:27:48.788]  We're tweeting it at RealAlexJones.
[01:27:48.788 --> 01:27:53.972]  Ebola scare in H-Town after woman who returned from Nigeria found dead.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:03.482]  Hazmat team removes body from apartment, and of course you know a Nigeria-based flight into DC.
[01:28:03.482 --> 01:28:05.342]  I've got that in my stack here.
[01:28:05.342 --> 01:28:11.684]  The person died vomiting on the plane, and they just said, oh, no Ebola instantly.
[01:28:11.684 --> 01:28:16.925]  Not even a test, just a, don't worry, go to sleep, everything's fine, there's no way Ebola will come to America.
[01:28:16.925 --> 01:28:19.625]  I mean, it's here, but there's no way it'll spread.
[01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:20.866]  I mean, it's spreading.
[01:28:20.866 --> 01:28:22.086]  I mean, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[01:28:24.949 --> 01:28:26.597]  And it was a man to New York City.
[01:28:26.597 --> 01:28:28.485]  There was another person vomiting going into D.C.
[01:28:30.003 --> 01:28:30.964]  Everything's fine.
[01:28:30.964 --> 01:28:32.905]  Everything is awesome.
[01:28:32.905 --> 01:28:35.627]  Everything is cool when you're part of a team.
[01:28:35.627 --> 01:28:40.189]  Everything is fantastic when you're living the Ebola dream.
[01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:42.031]  Don't be racist.
[01:28:42.031 --> 01:28:43.251]  Get the disease.
[01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.632]  Bleed and die.
[01:28:44.632 --> 01:28:46.293]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[01:28:46.293 --> 01:28:48.715]  The insanity reaches the sky.
[01:28:48.715 --> 01:28:52.037]  Raise payroll taxes on poor people.
[01:28:52.037 --> 01:28:54.739]  It's hailed as a free healthcare program.
[01:28:54.739 --> 01:28:57.120]  Death panels for old people.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.161]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[01:29:00.114 --> 01:29:03.360]  We're going to break and come back and take calls, but Ebola in the Big Apple.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.326]  CDC tells New York City to get ready.
[01:29:06.326 --> 01:29:09.832]  Ebola man dies vomiting on plane from Nigeria to New York City.
[01:29:10.953 --> 01:29:23.678]  In a troubling report that surfaced amidst growing fears of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S., a man has died following a vomiting fit en route to New York City on a commercial flight originating from Nigeria.
[01:29:23.678 --> 01:29:32.120]  The CDC has yet to go on record confirming or denying whether or not the man had been infected with Ebola, but they do tell us, don't worry about it!
[01:29:35.558 --> 01:29:39.942]  Do you realize we have premeditated demons now in control?
[01:29:39.942 --> 01:29:41.324]  I think they're gonna set a nuke off.
[01:29:41.324 --> 01:29:43.165]  I kinda, I kinda, that's in the cards.
[01:29:43.165 --> 01:29:45.868]  I think, I think they're gonna blow a city off the map too.
[01:29:45.868 --> 01:29:49.211]  Get ready, we're under attack!
[01:29:49.211 --> 01:29:50.613]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.613 --> 01:29:53.135]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.135 --> 01:29:55.858]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.298 --> 01:30:10.964]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:10.964 --> 01:30:20.889]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:20.889 --> 01:30:23.811]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:24.011 --> 01:30:24.291]  I think?
[01:30:38.968 --> 01:30:39.228]  We're good.
[01:31:01.314 --> 01:31:04.955]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:04.955 --> 01:31:09.236]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:09.236 --> 01:31:11.016]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:11.016 --> 01:31:18.878]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:18.878 --> 01:31:20.019]  But for how long?
[01:31:20.019 --> 01:31:26.660]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.481]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:34.404]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:34.404 --> 01:31:42.670]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:48.074]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:48.074 --> 01:31:50.616]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:32:02.152 --> 01:32:09.259]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:32:09.259 --> 01:32:15.545]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:15.545 --> 01:32:19.149]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:32:19.269 --> 01:32:23.470]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:28.792]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:32:28.792 --> 01:32:29.812]  Not our iodine.
[01:32:29.812 --> 01:32:33.613]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:32:33.613 --> 01:32:36.153]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:32:56.559 --> 01:32:57.759]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:18.681 --> 01:33:22.742]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:22.742 --> 01:33:25.383]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.383 --> 01:33:33.466]  I want to play this clip of Obama defending his stance on not instituting a travel ban.
[01:33:33.466 --> 01:33:36.887]  They keep saying it lets medical workers go and help.
[01:33:36.887 --> 01:33:40.628]  They're on military, CDC, and UN flights.
[01:33:40.628 --> 01:33:42.108]  That's just not true.
[01:33:42.108 --> 01:33:43.809]  They're issuing visas to people.
[01:33:45.768 --> 01:33:47.429]  Folks are coming in.
[01:33:47.429 --> 01:33:48.811]  The main hub is Nigeria.
[01:33:48.811 --> 01:33:51.293]  They come in out of other Ebola-affected countries.
[01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:55.716]  They get on and start projectile vomiting everywhere.
[01:33:55.716 --> 01:33:58.498]  They clearly want it to spread, folks.
[01:33:58.498 --> 01:34:10.248]  If they didn't engineer it and soup it up as it appears to be, last longer in the body, can spread further, has a higher kill rate, then they bare minimum let it come in.
[01:34:10.248 --> 01:34:15.232]  Look, you didn't think the socialists and the globalists were going to just get control of the country and not fully wreck it.
[01:34:16.874 --> 01:34:22.976]  You just think Obama's going to leave office without totally wrecking the country first?
[01:34:22.976 --> 01:34:31.078]  And they think the controlled media will protect them to the point... You've heard the big White House reporters, when the mics, they think are off, going, man, we're screwed.
[01:34:31.078 --> 01:34:31.799]  This is really bad.
[01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.059]  It's spreading.
[01:34:33.059 --> 01:34:36.100]  But when they ask the questions, oh, gracious leader, thank you for saving us.
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.440]  You're so perfect.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.762]  Because if you don't ask questions like that, you don't get let in.
[01:34:42.762 --> 01:34:45.843]  Do we all have a suicide pact with these crazy people running the government?
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.801]  And I'm going to explain something.
[01:34:47.801 --> 01:35:08.423]  It's a bunch of corporate special interests that will make trillions off a full-bore worldwide Ebola pandemic that they will medicalize, that they'll create the vaccines for, that they'll get the countries into debt, they create wars, they fund Al-Qaeda, they promote diseases because they get power out of the global crisis management system they've built.
[01:35:10.054 --> 01:35:13.036]  That's why they don't want locals to ever be prepared to do anything.
[01:35:13.036 --> 01:35:24.043]  That's why they block locals in Katrina, and block local police and others, because they want to come in, screw everything up, and then get even more funding so they can, quote, do a better job next time.
[01:35:24.043 --> 01:35:26.945]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:35:26.945 --> 01:35:31.408]  Here is Obama defending his stance on not instituting a travel ban.
[01:35:31.408 --> 01:35:32.168]  Here it is.
[01:35:32.168 --> 01:35:39.073]  I don't have a philosophical objection, necessarily, to a travel ban, if that is the thing that is going to keep the American people safe.
[01:35:40.222 --> 01:35:56.039]  The problem is, is that in all the discussions I've had thus far with experts in the field, experts in infectious disease, is that a travel ban is less effective than the measures that we are currently instituting.
[01:35:56.039 --> 01:36:00.604]  If we institute a travel ban instead of the protocols that we put in place now,
[01:36:02.328 --> 01:36:08.770]  History shows that there is a likelihood of increased avoidance.
[01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:12.772]  People do not readily disclose their information.
[01:36:12.772 --> 01:36:21.415]  They may engage in something called broken travel, essentially breaking up their trip so that they can hide the fact that they have been to one of these- They're already doing that!
[01:36:21.415 --> 01:36:23.996]  There is a disease in place and
[01:36:24.756 --> 01:36:31.321]  As a result, we may end up getting less information about who has the disease.
[01:36:31.321 --> 01:36:35.724]  They're less likely to get treated properly, screened properly, quarantined properly.
[01:36:35.724 --> 01:36:39.607]  And as a consequence, we could end up having more cases rather than less.
[01:36:39.607 --> 01:36:43.150]  Okay, that's from NBC News.
[01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:47.333]  How did we get the current Ebola outbreak?
[01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:48.714]  Hmm, let me think back.
[01:36:48.714 --> 01:36:53.778]  Because Lyra Chief, you know, he just told me that he's trying to keep me safe and trying to keep you safe.
[01:36:55.566 --> 01:37:00.728]  They told us that there wasn't any threat of it coming here.
[01:37:00.728 --> 01:37:10.713]  And then a man from Liberia, who knew he had it, flew here and ran around for weeks vomiting on everyone.
[01:37:10.713 --> 01:37:14.095]  But that's okay because Jesse Jackson said we were racist.
[01:37:14.095 --> 01:37:14.495]  Why not?
[01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:14.955]  We're bad.
[01:37:14.955 --> 01:37:18.317]  We deserve it.
[01:37:18.317 --> 01:37:20.978]  And then they didn't quarantine his family and let his kid go to school.
[01:37:22.119 --> 01:37:24.482]  And then two nurses got it, which they said were impossible.
[01:37:24.482 --> 01:37:26.625]  You had to be vomited on into an open wound.
[01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:39.055]  And now the nurses are flying around everywhere, and now you've got people flying in and out of Africa, vomiting and dying on the plane, and dead people being found in Houston, that just came in from West Africa.
[01:37:39.055 --> 01:37:40.936]  Everything's fine, though.
[01:37:40.936 --> 01:37:42.717]  I think they're trying to get Ebola.
[01:37:42.717 --> 01:37:44.038]  I think it's really clear now.
[01:37:44.038 --> 01:37:44.778]  It really just clicked.
[01:37:44.778 --> 01:37:46.699]  They don't want it to just get started spreading.
[01:37:46.699 --> 01:37:55.725]  They want it to spread real bad, before we know, so folks don't start self-quarantining and making the right procedures.
[01:37:56.874 --> 01:37:59.856]  Because they know the states will take matters into their own hands and stop it.
[01:37:59.856 --> 01:38:02.759]  They want it to get so bad, it's unstoppable.
[01:38:02.759 --> 01:38:04.080]  That's it.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.222]  Total commitment to spread Ebola as bad as possible.
[01:38:07.222 --> 01:38:10.885]  And to just be handing out the visas like hotcakes to anybody that wants to come here.
[01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:13.447]  You know, oh you're bleeding and vomiting?
[01:38:13.447 --> 01:38:14.168]  Get on the plane!
[01:38:14.168 --> 01:38:16.169]  You want to vomit on everybody on the plane?
[01:38:16.169 --> 01:38:22.534]  Vomiting so bad the person died flying into New York.
[01:38:22.534 --> 01:38:24.075]  Oh my gosh.
[01:38:24.075 --> 01:38:25.757]  I've flown in a JFK so many times.
[01:38:26.648 --> 01:38:27.628]  They rob your bags there.
[01:38:27.628 --> 01:38:31.949]  I've had the airport screening people rob me twice.
[01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:33.750]  Very nice people.
[01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:41.852]  In a troubling report that has surfaced amidst growing fears of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S., a man has died following a vomiting fit.
[01:38:41.852 --> 01:38:43.032]  Because you die usually.
[01:38:43.032 --> 01:38:45.853]  I've never heard of that before.
[01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:49.634]  En route to New York City on a commercial flight originating from Nigeria.
[01:38:51.155 --> 01:38:58.939]  The CDC is yet to go on record confirming or denying whether or not the man may have been infected with Ebola.
[01:38:58.939 --> 01:39:07.263]  The New York Post reports a plane from Nigeria landed at JFK Airport last night with a male passenger aboard who died during the flight after a vomit fit.
[01:39:07.263 --> 01:39:08.183]  Oh!
[01:39:08.183 --> 01:39:12.525]  Well, whatever he's got, we sure need to spread it, or you're racist.
[01:39:12.525 --> 01:39:18.148]  And CDC officials conducted a cursory exam before announcing there was no Ebola.
[01:39:18.148 --> 01:39:19.669]  A cursory exam!
[01:39:21.132 --> 01:39:24.195]  And turning the corpse over to the Port Authority cops to remove.
[01:39:24.195 --> 01:39:25.416]  Yo, how'd you like that job?
[01:39:25.416 --> 01:39:33.362]  Of course, that's the same airport where for two weeks they're refusing to clean the planes because they say there's so much vomit and blood on them.
[01:39:33.362 --> 01:39:34.083]  Oh, it's here.
[01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:36.024]  They're bringing all of them in.
[01:39:36.024 --> 01:39:38.907]  But they always said it would be the Muslim extremists would go get infected and come in.
[01:39:38.907 --> 01:39:40.168]  They don't need to.
[01:39:40.168 --> 01:39:47.454]  Our government will take someone with Ebola and bring them in to treat them, or they'll take somebody who hasn't and take them and put them in a regular hospital.
[01:39:50.976 --> 01:39:55.700]  And all the major independent experts are saying send them to special government facilities that are already there.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:56.841]  Quarantine them.
[01:39:56.841 --> 01:39:57.762]  That was default.
[01:39:57.762 --> 01:40:01.024]  Look, it's a default, folks.
[01:40:01.024 --> 01:40:03.186]  So I want to hurry through your calls now.
[01:40:03.186 --> 01:40:05.268]  I've talked enough and I've gone too long.
[01:40:05.268 --> 01:40:06.409]  I want to take a bunch of them now.
[01:40:06.409 --> 01:40:07.930]  Austin, Aaron, Ray.
[01:40:07.930 --> 01:40:09.872]  Racist.
[01:40:09.872 --> 01:40:11.553]  That means that he doesn't want Ebola.
[01:40:11.553 --> 01:40:15.556]  Shane, just have your question, your comment ready right now.
[01:40:15.556 --> 01:40:17.498]  Austin in Michigan.
[01:40:17.498 --> 01:40:18.178]  You're on the air.
[01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:18.679]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:40:21.345 --> 01:40:23.666]  Well, I mean, I'm kind of ashamed of myself.
[01:40:23.666 --> 01:40:27.609]  I don't want Ebola to kill me and my family, so I'm racist.
[01:40:27.609 --> 01:40:38.275]  And I'm kind of upset that Rachel Maddow and CBS News and the White House and all these other organizations, Media Matters, that they control, that's when I say the White House,
[01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:43.193]  Well, I was called to talk about, I don't know if you've ever heard of, have you ever read the book, The Cure for All Diseases?
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:15.827]  Um, it's a book by an independent research scientist, uh, her name is, uh, it's Hilda Regehr-Clark.
[01:41:15.827 --> 01:41:21.732]  Okay, well, tell me what they're claiming, because I don't think there's a quote, cure 100% of the time for anything.
[01:41:21.732 --> 01:41:27.237]  Well, well it has to do with, uh, you ever, you ever, uh, hear of bio-radiation?
[01:41:27.237 --> 01:41:29.379]  Oh, they're claiming they have like a Raymond Rife machine or something?
[01:41:30.254 --> 01:41:35.577]  No, everything here emits a frequency, you know, a light frequency.
[01:41:35.577 --> 01:41:38.079]  No, I know, and that's Rife Machines.
[01:41:38.079 --> 01:41:44.883]  There is some real evidence that there are different frequency treatments, and we know bad frequencies out of cell phones are given as cancer.
[01:41:44.883 --> 01:41:48.445]  But then there's so many quacks, I don't know the book you're talking about, so I'm not saying they're a quack.
[01:41:48.445 --> 01:41:50.887]  There are so many quacks out there selling BS machines.
[01:41:51.627 --> 01:41:56.230]  I mean, I've been offered, let's not exaggerate, machines that are like $10,000.
[01:41:56.230 --> 01:41:58.152]  They cost about $1,000 to make.
[01:41:58.152 --> 01:42:05.977]  I've been offered $5,000 per machine to sell them, and I won't because I've gone and looked into what they are, and it's not real.
[01:42:05.977 --> 01:42:11.021]  But I think the claim that frequencies can heal everything isn't true.
[01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:12.161]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:12.161 --> 01:42:17.385]  But if you can fire radiation through a tumor and kill it, it just might kill everything else around it.
[01:42:17.385 --> 01:42:19.687]  So the answer is, are there other good forms
[01:42:20.547 --> 01:42:24.991]  Frequencies that can resonate at a certain level to kill viruses and things.
[01:42:24.991 --> 01:42:26.412]  Well, yes.
[01:42:26.412 --> 01:42:28.493]  Sunlight kills viruses.
[01:42:28.493 --> 01:42:31.635]  But how do you get sunlight into every area of the body?
[01:42:31.635 --> 01:42:34.558]  So, of course, frequencies can do things.
[01:42:34.558 --> 01:42:37.480]  But it should be studied, mainlined, and deployed.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.002]  The Queen of England, it comes out, gets frequency treatments.
[01:42:41.002 --> 01:42:44.305]  But she goes to real government facilities with very secretive stuff.
[01:42:44.305 --> 01:42:45.706]  Queen Mother lived to a hundred and something.
[01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:47.167]  She would get it.
[01:42:47.167 --> 01:42:49.609]  They'd take her blood out and put it through ozone machines and stuff.
[01:42:52.053 --> 01:42:53.594]  Prince Philip gets it.
[01:42:53.594 --> 01:42:56.676]  So yes, I'm saying it's like alternative energy.
[01:42:56.676 --> 01:43:01.359]  There's a lot of real alternative energy, but most of the stuff out there is a scam.
[01:43:01.359 --> 01:43:04.882]  So I don't promote it because it's such a minefield.
[01:43:04.882 --> 01:43:07.944]  So that's Royal Raymond Rife stuff you're talking about, sir.
[01:43:07.944 --> 01:43:11.146]  Let's talk to Aaron, and his research was real overall.
[01:43:11.146 --> 01:43:13.527]  It got a little bit far out there towards the end.
[01:43:13.527 --> 01:43:15.369]  Aaron in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:43:15.369 --> 01:43:18.070]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:43:19.645 --> 01:43:21.628]  I think I know what's going on with this.
[01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:24.652]  And I think it's a false flag.
[01:43:24.652 --> 01:43:26.114]  We know that.
[01:43:26.114 --> 01:43:33.244]  However, I think what they're trying to do is the linchpin of this whole New World Order takeover is they have to have us convinced.
[01:43:34.257 --> 01:43:36.819]  Oh yeah, that's it.
[01:43:36.819 --> 01:43:37.239]  That's it.
[01:43:37.239 --> 01:43:44.103]  Bring in medical tyranny, forced inoculations, grandstanding, and they've got to get it going enough to scare the daylights out of people.
[01:43:44.103 --> 01:43:46.465]  And they're saying, take your flu shot and we won't quarantine you.
[01:43:46.465 --> 01:43:47.225]  What does that mean?
[01:43:47.225 --> 01:43:49.106]  Well, if you're sick, we'll quarantine you.
[01:43:49.106 --> 01:43:50.027]  See the threat?
[01:43:50.027 --> 01:43:52.468]  We'll lock you up with Ebola patients if you don't do this.
[01:43:52.468 --> 01:43:53.629]  It's pure terrorism.
[01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:54.690]  We're being terrorized.
[01:43:54.690 --> 01:43:55.010]  Go ahead.
[01:43:55.947 --> 01:43:57.008]  Honestly, they have to.
[01:43:57.008 --> 01:44:06.556]  They have to, though, because we're getting to the point now where 40% of the populace now is around roughly that number is not vaccinating their children anymore.
[01:44:06.556 --> 01:44:09.019]  The walls of that tyranny is starting to fall down.
[01:44:09.019 --> 01:44:10.100]  We have whistleblowers.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:14.724]  We have lawsuits against Bill Gates in India and things like that.
[01:44:14.724 --> 01:44:18.207]  Over his polio stuff, giving people polio by the hundreds of thousands.
[01:44:18.607 --> 01:44:26.801]  You're right, and so what's happening is, just like Red Adair would blow up an oil well fire with a bigger explosion, they need a big giant explosion.
[01:44:28.114 --> 01:44:31.336]  I mean, the globalists would launch a nuclear war before they were ever removed from power.
[01:44:31.336 --> 01:44:37.260]  That's why you've got to culturally identify them and reject them and just literally shun them.
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:42.524]  That's the way to defeat them, not militarily, not in some coup or something or counter-coup.
[01:44:42.524 --> 01:44:46.426]  We've got to overthrow their system intellectually by recognizing it.
[01:44:46.426 --> 01:44:47.807]  That's why they want to dumb us down.
[01:44:47.807 --> 01:44:50.249]  And you're absolutely correct that it's all about
[01:44:51.749 --> 01:44:55.031]  Well, that's why they had NBC News attack Kurt Nemo last week.
[01:44:55.031 --> 01:45:01.815]  Kurt was pointing out in an article that they are preparing a vaccine by the end of the year, and they're going to try to roll it out, and that's on record.
[01:45:01.815 --> 01:45:07.998]  So they came out and said, oh, Kurt claims with no evidence and InfoWars claims that it's about a vaccine when there is no vaccine.
[01:45:07.998 --> 01:45:14.082]  Well, his article said in December and January when it comes out, when this stuff starts peaking.
[01:45:14.082 --> 01:45:15.623]  So they play these games.
[01:45:15.623 --> 01:45:15.943]  Go ahead.
[01:45:16.761 --> 01:45:32.167]  There is a story going around, and I don't know how legitimate it is, but it's been going around Facebook and things like that about a nurse from one of those countries over there who was saying that it was a warning to Americans that there really is no Ebola virus.
[01:45:32.167 --> 01:45:38.829]  The Ebola virus is actually in the vaccines that the Red Cross has been giving to the people in Africa for 40 years now.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:45.883]  No, that was actually in the biggest paper in Liberia with top virologists saying and who were working on getting on.
[01:45:45.883 --> 01:45:51.425]  And with all the secret testing in Africa killing people before, why wouldn't it if they've done it before?
[01:45:51.425 --> 01:45:53.426]  They've put sterilisants in vaccines.
[01:45:53.426 --> 01:45:55.527]  If they've been caught doing this, of course.
[01:45:55.527 --> 01:45:58.769]  And Bill and Melinda Gates are involved in that as well.
[01:45:58.769 --> 01:46:01.650]  And that's what the CIA agent Steele
[01:46:03.554 --> 01:46:11.776]  Former CIA agent, officer, case officer said two weeks before all this happened, he said there's going to be a false flag.
[01:46:11.776 --> 01:46:13.516]  Let's cue up that one minute clip if you can.
[01:46:13.516 --> 01:46:20.658]  There's going to be a false flag using an Ebola biological simulant hitting America.
[01:46:20.658 --> 01:46:26.699]  And so, absolutely, if the government's been caught in thousands of declassified tests
[01:46:27.617 --> 01:46:37.501]  Many of which were lethal against black kids, white kids, poor people, Native Americans, military people, GIs, wives.
[01:46:37.501 --> 01:46:40.802]  Why would we ever trust this group now?
[01:46:40.802 --> 01:46:42.643]  Why would we take or do anything they said?
[01:46:42.643 --> 01:46:43.223]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:46:44.028 --> 01:46:53.133]  If we had a government with a history of good vaccines that could be trusted, or they said, hey, there's a risk, but here it is, and we think it's a cost-benefit analysis, I'd be like, yeah, Ebola vaccine.
[01:46:53.133 --> 01:46:57.215]  But no, they're bringing it in, they're letting it spread, you can't trust them.
[01:46:57.215 --> 01:47:00.176]  Gardasil shots kill a bunch of people that took it.
[01:47:00.176 --> 01:47:02.357]  The HPV shot, they still get it.
[01:47:02.357 --> 01:47:03.818]  It's banned in India and Japan.
[01:47:05.995 --> 01:47:08.776]  Let's go to that clip with Mr. Steele.
[01:47:08.776 --> 01:47:10.777]  They will have another false flag.
[01:47:10.777 --> 01:47:24.563]  In fact, the false flag I'm hearing about is a simulated Ebola attack in which they actually use biochemical weapons that dissipate, but then they pretend that it's Ebola and that it has been brought here by Saudi martyrs.
[01:47:24.563 --> 01:47:25.244]  Okay?
[01:47:25.244 --> 01:47:28.405]  So no, we have not reached the end of the false flag line.
[01:47:28.405 --> 01:47:29.926]  However, what we have reached
[01:47:30.706 --> 01:47:38.091]  I did my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution, and there's a difference between preconditions of revolution and precipitants.
[01:47:38.091 --> 01:47:43.315]  And I have posted a graphic on preconditions of revolution that exist in the USA today.
[01:47:43.315 --> 01:47:46.517]  Now, a precipitant is like the Tunisian fruit seller.
[01:47:46.517 --> 01:47:53.201]  My preferred precipitant is a soccer mom that tortures herself on the steps of Capitol Hill, and it appears on YouTube.
[01:47:53.201 --> 01:47:58.585]  But the bottom line is the next false flag could lead to a general strike across this country.
[01:48:00.376 --> 01:48:03.019]  Robert David Steele.
[01:48:03.019 --> 01:48:11.107]  Not an armchair CIA asset agent operative, but someone that ran operations in hot zones, in combat zones.
[01:48:11.107 --> 01:48:14.591]  And that's, he becomes highly recommended from the US Army.
[01:48:14.591 --> 01:48:18.535]  Now, that was two weeks before all this started.
[01:48:18.535 --> 01:48:22.780]  We're gonna go on a break, come back and go to Aaron, Ray, Racist, Shane and others.
[01:48:24.667 --> 01:48:27.369]  In fact, Shane's up first when we come back.
[01:48:27.369 --> 01:48:33.192]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:48:33.192 --> 01:48:41.877]  Before I go any further, though, let me just go ahead and take my daily dose right now of Silver Bullet, still available now for a limited time.
[01:48:41.877 --> 01:48:42.638]  It is selling out.
[01:48:42.638 --> 01:48:48.501]  CoilSilver and InfowarsLife.com.
[01:48:48.501 --> 01:48:52.604]  And again, I normally only take this once I'm already not feeling well.
[01:48:54.355 --> 01:49:02.919]  Super male vitality, always good to boost natural function, because they give us all the estrogen mimickers to try to block our vitality.
[01:49:02.919 --> 01:49:05.980]  Fluoride shield, this is real thick, need to shake it up.
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:10.162]  Chelator doesn't just take out fluoride, but a bunch of other heavy metals and garbage.
[01:49:10.162 --> 01:49:11.643]  Got a whole bunch of things in it known to do that.
[01:49:11.643 --> 01:49:14.685]  A little bit of the secret sauce that isn't out yet.
[01:49:14.685 --> 01:49:16.986]  A little bit of that in there.
[01:49:16.986 --> 01:49:23.489]  And then finally, super nascent iodine from the Crystal Source X2.
[01:49:26.186 --> 01:49:29.767]  And I'm going to stir this up.
[01:49:29.767 --> 01:49:32.868]  Morning, noon, and night.
[01:49:32.868 --> 01:49:34.668]  And you've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:36.789]  You can go read all the facts and info.
[01:49:36.789 --> 01:49:39.449]  Infowarslife.com about each one of these things.
[01:49:39.449 --> 01:49:41.790]  The oxy powder to flush out the guts, all of it.
[01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:44.971]  This is what I'm doing to bolster my body's natural defenses.
[01:49:44.971 --> 01:49:48.992]  This is what I'm doing to try to give my immune system everything I can.
[01:49:48.992 --> 01:49:50.872]  Sunlight's important, purified water, you name it.
[01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:56.311]  And being optimistic, not living in fear.
[01:49:56.311 --> 01:49:59.472]  That's why I'll say some really hardcore stuff as they get prepared, but make a joke out of it.
[01:49:59.472 --> 01:50:02.773]  Because I'm going to have fun with all this.
[01:50:02.773 --> 01:50:06.694]  But boy, any of my family bleeds out without Ebola.
[01:50:06.694 --> 01:50:08.095]  I've had enough, okay?
[01:50:08.095 --> 01:50:08.755]  Stop it now.
[01:50:08.755 --> 01:50:10.215]  You're not going to get away with it.

[01:52:01.978 --> 01:52:05.520]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.662]  And in a word, the answer is protection.

[01:52:58.781 --> 01:53:01.942]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[01:53:01.942 --> 01:53:06.104]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[01:53:06.104 --> 01:53:07.664]  What are you doing to prepare?
[01:53:07.664 --> 01:53:11.286]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[01:53:11.286 --> 01:53:12.846]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[01:53:12.846 --> 01:53:14.287]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[01:53:14.287 --> 01:53:17.828]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[01:53:17.828 --> 01:53:20.709]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger
[01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:30.213]  And the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[01:53:30.213 --> 01:53:38.596]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[01:53:38.596 --> 01:53:45.019]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[01:53:45.019 --> 01:53:46.279]  The crash is coming.
[01:53:46.279 --> 01:53:48.520]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.903]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[01:53:54.903 --> 01:54:00.265]  That's babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[01:54:00.265 --> 01:54:09.410]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:54:15.307 --> 01:54:18.228]  It was an inside job, folks, just like it always is.
[01:54:18.228 --> 01:54:25.409]  And it was an inside job.
[01:54:25.409 --> 01:54:26.709]  By the well-connected!
[01:54:42.032 --> 01:54:46.614]  I'll be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:46.614 --> 01:55:06.204]  And we're gonna have Paul Watson and Anthony Gucciardi, both reporters, both for TV and for print, in Dallas, Texas, tonight, tomorrow, and on Sunday, doing original text and video reports from the ground there.
[01:55:07.498 --> 01:55:14.302]  So, that is coming up, and look for a final report from Paul while he's here in the U.S., probably on Sunday.
[01:55:14.302 --> 01:55:18.644]  Let's go to Shane, then Racist, Ray, James, Kelly, and others.
[01:55:18.644 --> 01:55:19.544]  Shane, you're on the air.
[01:55:19.544 --> 01:55:23.746]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:55:23.746 --> 01:55:24.347]  You bet, thank you.
[01:55:24.347 --> 01:55:33.632]  Hey, I just wanted to know, how long is this going to go on before people realize that there's power in numbers, and everybody just needs to opt out now?
[01:55:33.632 --> 01:55:36.293]  And I think that would definitely put a hurting on them.
[01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:42.780]  And by opt-out, what, just stop showing up to work and stuff and maybe they'll seal the border?
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:43.640]  Exactly.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:49.323]  I mean, not only work, just stop going, stop anything, any supporting... No, that's it.
[01:55:49.323 --> 01:55:50.144]  I totally agree.
[01:55:50.144 --> 01:55:53.786]  We need to have Watson write the article right now, use historical examples.
[01:55:53.786 --> 01:55:58.228]  They had strikes a few months ago in countries bordering Sierra Leone and others.
[01:55:58.228 --> 01:55:59.749]  They wanted their borders shut.
[01:55:59.749 --> 01:56:01.770]  We should call for a national strike.
[01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:02.671]  We don't have time to wait.
[01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:05.973]  A national strike starting next Monday.
[01:56:06.773 --> 01:56:28.363]  Running through Wednesday of all non-essential people, obviously media and police and firefighters and things covering things have to still go in, but all non-essential people should go on strike Monday through next Wednesday and then call Congress and go on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere when you're on strike and talk about why you're on strike.
[01:56:28.363 --> 01:56:30.004]  Let's do it right now.
[01:56:30.004 --> 01:56:31.985]  Infowars.com calls for a
[01:56:33.831 --> 01:57:00.309]  A strike in the United States, running Monday through next Wednesday, until they stop the flights, and until they start... I mean, look, I was just watching the news earlier, Fox News during a break, and they were admitting that police departments all over the country are just filled with illegals, that have committed all sorts of heinous crimes, and the feds won't come get them, so the headline was, Police Departments to Stop Holding Criminal Immigrants.
[01:57:02.349 --> 01:57:04.710]  Well, that was pretty much my only point.
[01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:08.471]  I just don't realize how people don't see what's going on.
[01:57:08.471 --> 01:57:11.992]  It's going to be too late before people realize it.
[01:57:24.685 --> 01:57:29.787]  I mean, I think that's the only chance that everybody gets together in numbers and show them... That's it!
[01:57:29.787 --> 01:57:30.147]  That's it!
[01:57:30.147 --> 01:57:33.428]  We're going to put out a White House petition right now.
[01:57:33.428 --> 01:57:34.228]  Get Kurt to do that.
[01:57:34.228 --> 01:57:38.949]  Just a basic statement of they've been derelict in their duty, like all their countries, blocking their borders.
[01:57:38.949 --> 01:57:45.792]  AP admits that other African countries blocked their borders and stopped flights, and it stopped it in its tracks.
[01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:49.853]  That our administration is aiding and abetting Ebola to create a crisis.
[01:57:51.049 --> 01:57:51.209]  I don't
[01:58:13.861 --> 01:58:16.582]  To bring attention to this, to point out what's going on.
[01:58:16.582 --> 01:58:20.303]  Because the Feds are on strike, leaving us wide open.
[01:58:20.303 --> 01:58:23.084]  That is a great idea!
[01:58:23.084 --> 01:58:25.265]  In fact, that's what Steele said about a month ago.
[01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:29.947]  He said, a national strike for the next false flag that he believes will be Ebola.
[01:58:29.947 --> 01:58:31.287]  And now we're living it right now.
[01:58:31.287 --> 01:58:31.607]  That's it.
[01:58:31.607 --> 01:58:33.388]  We need to call for a national strike.
[01:58:33.388 --> 01:58:35.909]  Everyone should join us right now.
[01:58:35.909 --> 01:58:40.451]  Call for a national strike next week.
[01:58:40.451 --> 01:58:41.231]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:42.423 --> 01:58:46.417]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:53.801]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:58:53.801 --> 01:58:58.082]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:58:58.082 --> 01:58:59.862]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:58:59.862 --> 01:59:05.183]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:59:05.183 --> 01:59:07.724]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:59:07.724 --> 01:59:08.864]  But for how long?
[01:59:08.864 --> 01:59:11.064]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:59:11.064 --> 01:59:15.505]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:59:15.505 --> 01:59:18.306]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:59:19.701 --> 01:59:23.204]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:59:23.204 --> 01:59:31.471]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:31.471 --> 01:59:36.875]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:36.875 --> 01:59:39.418]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.528]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.871 --> 02:00:07.172]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.172 --> 02:00:08.934]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.934 --> 02:00:10.695]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.695 --> 02:00:12.277]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.277 --> 02:00:13.818]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.818 --> 02:00:18.022]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.022 --> 02:00:22.065]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.011 --> 02:00:38.175]  We're launching this national strike because the border's been left wide open.
[02:00:38.175 --> 02:00:43.280]  The default of stopping the flights that other nations have done has been ignored.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:54.731]  The AP reports that African countries bordering the Ebola-stricken nations have been able to stop the spread of Ebola and stopped it coming in cold in its tracks because they did this.
[02:00:54.731 --> 02:00:57.354]  The default under federal law and the CDC policy
[02:00:59.176 --> 02:01:01.797]  is to stop the flights months ago.
[02:01:01.797 --> 02:01:03.798]  They're allowing it to spread.
[02:01:03.798 --> 02:01:11.120]  They're taking people to hospitals that aren't level four biocontainment, violating policy again and law.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:20.463]  And so only a national strike will bring the attention we need to force the hand of the establishment
[02:01:23.117 --> 02:01:34.903]  To force the hand so that they know they're going to get the blame for it spreading as it begins to spread so that hopefully they shut down the flights and start quarantining the people properly before it gets out of control.
[02:01:34.903 --> 02:01:37.124]  And a national strike is the way to do it.
[02:01:37.124 --> 02:01:45.989]  Plus, in other African countries, they had basically government-imposed strikes telling people for three days to stay indoors to stop the spread.
[02:01:45.989 --> 02:01:48.250]  And it did stop the spread massively.
[02:01:49.642 --> 02:01:53.106]  So it's also good practice to get ready if this gets out of control.
[02:01:53.106 --> 02:01:55.448]  It's also a practice self-quarantine.
[02:01:55.448 --> 02:02:05.398]  And then with the telephone and the internet, we can contact Congress, contact the White House, contact media with news of the strike.
[02:02:05.398 --> 02:02:10.564]  And if by Wednesday night Obama hadn't stopped the flights and shut down the southern border, which they can do,
[02:02:12.875 --> 02:02:22.524]  When you've got the head of Southcom saying there are people with Ebola, clearly, that are going to go to South America and they will pour across, and it'll be the biggest crisis ever, they've got to bolster that border now.
[02:02:22.524 --> 02:02:25.747]  Instead, he's got it on stand down!
[02:02:25.747 --> 02:02:28.890]  So Paul just ran in and said, what's in the article by Paul Watson and Alex Jones?
[02:02:28.890 --> 02:02:29.231]  That's it.
[02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:34.419]  That's the article, so we need to give him the audio of this right now.
[02:02:34.419 --> 02:02:36.741]  Snip it, give it to him, that's the article.
[02:02:36.741 --> 02:02:45.828]  And we need to show the generals saying it, we need to show the experts saying this should have been done to stop the spread, the other countries that did it, and just make the claim, show the fact, and show the common sense.
[02:02:45.828 --> 02:02:59.438]  And then, instead of just bitching and complaining like I've been doing at Obama and people, we need to call for a national strike Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and if the feds are still derelict in their duty, if the feds are still purely
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:03.361]  Involved in criminal neglect.
[02:03:03.361 --> 02:03:03.901]  Keyword.
[02:03:03.901 --> 02:03:07.962]  And I've had medical doctors on agreeing, that's what it is.
[02:03:07.962 --> 02:03:13.444]  If they're still involved in criminal neglect, allowing this to spread, well then it's all on record what they've done.
[02:03:13.444 --> 02:03:17.145]  And we go into day four and five, all next week.
[02:03:17.145 --> 02:03:20.546]  A national strike if they haven't responded by Wednesday.
[02:03:20.546 --> 02:03:30.629]  Now, if this starts getting traction, and there's already a lot of people out there upset and angry as well, it's not just us, he'll say, okay, I have a board or a group looking at the flights.
[02:03:31.539 --> 02:03:35.244]  So he'll shut the flights down once it's spreading uncontrollably.
[02:03:35.244 --> 02:03:36.246]  But they're not sure yet.
[02:03:36.246 --> 02:03:47.141]  So that's why the president of Proviso today, when he spoke, said, well, I'm not intellectually, you know, you know, I'm not as a liberal, an open border, border adherent.
[02:03:48.692 --> 02:03:49.292]  Against doing this.
[02:03:49.292 --> 02:03:50.613]  Well, of course, that's why he's against it.
[02:03:50.613 --> 02:03:57.197]  Because they can't ever have the idea that closing a border or controlling your sovereignty or airspace or stopping a disease might be a good idea.
[02:03:57.197 --> 02:03:59.238]  You never try to find out why everybody's getting breast cancer.
[02:03:59.238 --> 02:04:00.118]  You just treat it.
[02:04:00.118 --> 02:04:01.439]  Never find out why everybody's getting cancer.
[02:04:01.439 --> 02:04:02.139]  You just treat it.
[02:04:02.139 --> 02:04:04.941]  You never stop the flood of people pouring across.
[02:04:04.941 --> 02:04:10.263]  You just use the crisis they create to take over.
[02:04:10.263 --> 02:04:13.805]  So, burn down the world and basically roast marshmallows.
[02:04:13.805 --> 02:04:14.846]  That's what they're doing.
[02:04:14.846 --> 02:04:16.767]  So, national strike,
[02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:21.112]  Look, we're gonna create a hashtag.
[02:04:21.112 --> 02:04:31.659]  Probably like... Hashtag, you know, pound... Stop... Ebola strike.
[02:04:31.659 --> 02:04:32.379]  That's it right there.
[02:04:32.379 --> 02:04:33.620]  We'll put that in the article.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:34.921]  You can send that out to everybody.
[02:04:34.921 --> 02:04:36.322]  Put it on Facebook.
[02:04:36.322 --> 02:04:38.103]  We're gonna come back and race through your phone calls.
[02:04:38.103 --> 02:04:38.343]  Ray...
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:42.643]  Then racist, then Kyle, then James, then Anthony.
[02:04:42.643 --> 02:04:43.644]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:04:43.644 --> 02:04:44.265]  Your calls.
[02:04:44.265 --> 02:04:45.727]  But this is big.
[02:04:45.727 --> 02:04:55.839]  And I'll shoot a special video report for the Nightly News tonight that'll then be up after the Nightly News on InfoWars.com, breaking this down in a really focused fashion with Paul Watson's article.
[02:04:55.839 --> 02:04:57.942]  I need you to make that go viral this weekend.
[02:05:00.814 --> 02:05:07.456]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.456 --> 02:05:12.597]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:12.597 --> 02:05:21.319]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.319 --> 02:05:24.880]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:27.341]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:29.659 --> 02:05:34.423]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:34.423 --> 02:05:38.226]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:05:38.226 --> 02:05:39.487]  Others don't.
[02:05:39.487 --> 02:05:41.629]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:43.410]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:46.292]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.292 --> 02:05:52.938]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:52.938 --> 02:05:55.640]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:58.002]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:05:58.002 --> 02:05:58.783]  Others don't.
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.400]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:08.522]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:08.522 --> 02:06:14.784]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:14.784 --> 02:06:22.746]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep-earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:22.746 --> 02:06:27.767]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.067]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:29.067 --> 02:06:32.869]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:32.869 --> 02:06:35.410]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:06:59.813 --> 02:07:06.960]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:09.323]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:09.323 --> 02:07:14.608]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:14.608 --> 02:07:19.553]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:19.753 --> 02:07:23.074]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:23.074 --> 02:07:27.155]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:27.155 --> 02:07:31.456]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:31.456 --> 02:07:41.699]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:41.699 --> 02:07:44.220]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:52.629]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:56.593]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:09.471 --> 02:08:09.691]  Wow!
[02:08:09.691 --> 02:08:11.472]  Wait till you hear this.
[02:08:11.472 --> 02:08:15.794]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front line report.
[02:08:15.794 --> 02:08:20.856]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:20.856 --> 02:08:25.238]  Well, the White House has tapped a bolo czar!
[02:08:25.238 --> 02:08:28.559]  And at a White House press conference that just happened in the last hour, we have the video.
[02:08:28.559 --> 02:08:32.581]  We have an article going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:35.647 --> 02:08:50.580]  As we ride this Ebola storm that's been born into the world, thrown into the United States as our borders are left wide open, as the aircraft are allowed to pour in with people that have it, obviously.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:58.127]  As we witness the premeditated takedown of this country and forced inoculation, you can just see the script.
[02:09:00.327 --> 02:09:09.633]  CBS News reported hours ago that they admit that the new Ebola czar has no experience in anything medical, period.
[02:09:09.633 --> 02:09:17.818]  And now the White House Press Secretary, throwing it in your face, says they're not looking for an Ebola expert.
[02:09:17.818 --> 02:09:19.079]  Exactly!
[02:09:19.079 --> 02:09:21.981]  You don't want an Ebola expert to deal with an Ebola outbreak.
[02:09:23.206 --> 02:09:33.915]  Kind of like if you're trying to hire a new NFL coach, say for the Seattle Seahawks or the New England Patriots, you don't even want to hire somebody that has sports history.
[02:09:33.915 --> 02:09:41.482]  You want to hire maybe an Eskimo who's never even played a sport.
[02:09:41.482 --> 02:09:47.106]  Or maybe a little old lady from Japan who paints teacups.
[02:09:47.106 --> 02:09:47.567]  Makes sense.
[02:09:49.588 --> 02:09:57.536]  If you want to have an armorer to work on your guns, don't hire someone who's ever shot a gun or has any metallurgy training or any firearms training.
[02:09:57.536 --> 02:10:07.827]  Hire a Tibetan monk who's never seen a firearm or ever used one.
[02:10:07.827 --> 02:10:12.712]  And again, it's all about being perfectly absurd, perfectly evil, perfectly over the top.
[02:10:14.721 --> 02:10:16.703]  Let's go ahead and go to this bombshell clip.
[02:10:16.703 --> 02:10:18.424]  The full video is on Infowars.com.
[02:10:18.424 --> 02:10:19.545]  It is live now.
[02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:21.266]  Kit Daniels just got it up very quickly.
[02:10:21.266 --> 02:10:23.908]  Good job, Kit, with an article he wrote in like 20 minutes.
[02:10:23.908 --> 02:10:27.011]  So here is the clip.
[02:10:27.011 --> 02:10:30.974]  What does Ron Klain know about Ebola?
[02:10:30.974 --> 02:10:36.839]  Well, the thing that's... Let's talk about... Let me restate why this person
[02:10:38.358 --> 02:10:42.401]  Why the president believes it was important to add this person to his team.
[02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:53.570]  The president again wanted somebody who could serve in a coordinating function to manage the implementation of our whole of government approach to this Ebola situation.
[02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:56.913]  And so I guess to more
[02:10:57.637 --> 02:10:59.698]  I'll directly address your question.
[02:10:59.698 --> 02:11:04.960]  What we were looking for is not an Ebola expert, but rather an implementation expert.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.021]  And that's exactly what Ron Klain is.
[02:11:07.021 --> 02:11:10.482]  He is somebody who has extensive experience in the federal government.
[02:11:10.482 --> 02:11:16.644]  He's somebody that has extensive management experience when it comes to the private sector.
[02:11:16.644 --> 02:11:25.968]  You'll recall that when he served here at the White House, he was responsible for working in the Vice President's office at a time that that office was responsible for implementing the Recovery Act.
[02:11:26.610 --> 02:11:30.092]  Now, we've talked a lot about... And the swindling of the carbon taxes.
[02:11:30.092 --> 02:11:31.033]  That's enough.
[02:11:31.033 --> 02:11:35.055]  Yeah, this guy's worked for the Clintons and is the right-hand man of Al Gore.
[02:11:35.055 --> 02:11:42.980]  And what he's going to oversee is the hundreds of billions of dollars that are handed out to insiders in the response.
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:47.403]  And there's not going to be hundreds of billions made unless a lot of sick people.
[02:11:47.403 --> 02:11:51.746]  And the way they're acting now, I'm pretty sure they engineered it and they've got a cure for themselves.
[02:11:52.648 --> 02:12:05.699]  And they'll pass it on to the public with something else in the backseat, a little something extra for you, which will make people sick, which they'll then get everybody trained to go, well, it did kill a bunch of people, make them sick, but would you rather die of Ebola?
[02:12:05.699 --> 02:12:08.100]  It's all about just flaunting it, breaking your will.
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:12.204]  That's what it's all about.
[02:12:12.204 --> 02:12:18.649]  And until you understand their evil logic, until you understand their twisted ways they operate, none of this makes sense.
[02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:19.730]  But I've read their books.
[02:12:19.730 --> 02:12:21.271]  I mean, I read their writings.
[02:12:21.271 --> 02:12:22.072]  I understand them.
[02:12:23.029 --> 02:12:24.469]  They're very public about how they do this.
[02:12:24.469 --> 02:12:26.630]  It's all a sick joke.
[02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:28.070]  And there's one common denominator.
[02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:32.132]  They hate you and your family and love seeing you poor and pathetic.
[02:12:32.132 --> 02:12:33.932]  They enjoy poverty.
[02:12:33.932 --> 02:12:36.173]  They enjoy destitution.
[02:12:36.173 --> 02:12:38.373]  They enjoy betrayal.
[02:12:38.373 --> 02:12:40.974]  They enjoy lying and hurting people.
[02:12:40.974 --> 02:12:42.174]  And they're going to do a lot of it.
[02:12:42.174 --> 02:12:47.656]  Because they're not retail psychopaths that just grab some woman off the street and have their way with them.
[02:12:47.656 --> 02:12:51.517]  They grab whole societies and they just enjoy their work.
[02:12:52.355 --> 02:13:04.448]  When they walk around airports and see the mutated kids and see, you know, go in a restaurant and half the kids look like they're dying or a third of them are showing autistic spectrum and people can hardly talk, everybody's screwed up and they're on elevators looking at people that can't talk.
[02:13:04.448 --> 02:13:06.009]  See, I'm all freaked out.
[02:13:06.009 --> 02:13:07.170]  I'm all really upset.
[02:13:07.791 --> 02:13:11.794]  Start crying when I'm in a doctor's office and I see, you know, three autistic kids in there.
[02:13:11.794 --> 02:13:16.238]  And, you know, I take my kids to the movies and like a third of the movie theater is autistic or whatever.
[02:13:16.238 --> 02:13:18.840]  And just you can see the kids all totally sick.
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:22.102]  And you see babies that look real sick.
[02:13:22.102 --> 02:13:25.445]  And I'll say to the woman, I'll say, are you getting a lot of vaccines?
[02:13:25.445 --> 02:13:26.126]  She'll go, yes, why?
[02:13:26.126 --> 02:13:27.787]  And I'll go, you need to look into those.
[02:13:27.787 --> 02:13:29.228]  I see a really healthy baby.
[02:13:29.228 --> 02:13:30.609]  I go, you don't take vaccines.
[02:13:30.609 --> 02:13:31.350]  This morning I did that.
[02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:33.071]  And the woman said, no, I don't.
[02:13:33.071 --> 02:13:33.972]  By the way, I appreciate your work.
[02:13:35.663 --> 02:13:40.746]  So I just see a little bit, but see with these people, they see all the victims and they're just walking around on a power trip.
[02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:41.587]  They're disdained.
[02:13:41.587 --> 02:13:42.508]  They're like Satan.
[02:13:42.508 --> 02:13:43.708]  They're hatred for humanity.
[02:13:43.708 --> 02:13:44.889]  They're hatred of gods.
[02:13:44.889 --> 02:13:46.510]  They're hatred of life.
[02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:53.375]  Fifty-four million dead babies in America, they know it's a bloody sacrifice, and they're just roaring with demonic power.
[02:13:53.375 --> 02:13:55.156]  Just raaaah!
[02:13:55.156 --> 02:13:58.018]  Just incinerating demonic will.
[02:13:58.018 --> 02:14:00.119]  Just full power.
[02:14:00.119 --> 02:14:03.741]  Just selling you on their abominations and having their way.
[02:14:04.924 --> 02:14:05.885]  Eat the GMO.
[02:14:05.885 --> 02:14:07.245]  Drink the glyphosate.
[02:14:07.245 --> 02:14:08.706]  Get the breast cancer.
[02:14:08.706 --> 02:14:10.487]  Take the shots.
[02:14:10.487 --> 02:14:14.769]  Prepare to die horrible excruciating deaths.
[02:14:14.769 --> 02:14:15.809]  Oh, they love you.
[02:14:15.809 --> 02:14:17.590]  Ray in California.
[02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:18.511]  Ray, you're on the air.
[02:14:18.511 --> 02:14:18.971]  Go ahead.
[02:14:18.971 --> 02:14:20.572]  Hello?
[02:14:20.572 --> 02:14:21.592]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:21.592 --> 02:14:26.194]  Okay, according to Dr. Rima E. Labo, MD... Yeah, I know who she is.
[02:14:26.194 --> 02:14:27.575]  She's been on the show before.
[02:14:27.575 --> 02:14:31.117]  Yeah, from, um... She's married to Major General Stubblebine.
[02:14:31.117 --> 02:14:31.597]  Yeah, right.
[02:14:32.881 --> 02:14:45.826]  She claims from, she's getting this information from the United States Department of Defense documents concerning studies on weaponized Ebola.
[02:14:45.826 --> 02:14:51.028]  The cure for Ebola, she claims that the actual cure for Ebola is Danosilver.
[02:14:51.028 --> 02:14:56.409]  And she discusses this at her YouTube channel called... Now listen, now listen, sir.
[02:14:56.409 --> 02:14:58.910]  I don't know if you listen to the show, we've probably had 20 of these calls.
[02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:59.711]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:02.981 --> 02:15:06.002]  There are Department of Defense studies, topically and internally.
[02:15:06.002 --> 02:15:08.863]  Guys, I meant to wait till break, but I can't do it.
[02:15:08.863 --> 02:15:09.683]  Can I have a glass of water?
[02:15:09.683 --> 02:15:11.464]  Thanks.
[02:15:11.464 --> 02:15:13.604]  I get my own water, but I just forgot to get it now.
[02:15:13.604 --> 02:15:15.765]  My throat's dry.
[02:15:15.765 --> 02:15:21.607]  I've been eating during the break, some peppers.
[02:15:21.607 --> 02:15:26.088]  No, I wouldn't say anything is a dead ringer cure.
[02:15:26.088 --> 02:15:27.929]  There's a cure to not grounding, that's oxygen.
[02:15:28.783 --> 02:15:36.466]  There's a cure to not getting scurvy, that's vitamin C. So you can say you must have iodine or you'll get a deficiency and die.
[02:15:36.466 --> 02:15:39.128]  You must have vitamin C, you must have oxygen.
[02:15:39.128 --> 02:15:48.552]  Does vitamin C and other things and the stuff that's in DNA Force, CoQ10, BioPQQ, does it super boost immune systems?
[02:15:48.552 --> 02:15:48.772]  Yes!
[02:15:50.236 --> 02:15:53.837]  Does colloidal silver kill viruses in a petri dish?
[02:15:53.837 --> 02:15:59.678]  Does the Department of Defense have research documents that have shown that it is certainly a promising treatment?
[02:15:59.678 --> 02:16:00.318]  Yes.
[02:16:00.318 --> 02:16:04.199]  Are blood transfusions promising treatments for people that have had Ebola and survived?
[02:16:04.199 --> 02:16:04.819]  Absolutely.
[02:16:04.819 --> 02:16:06.979]  And they're not doing that.
[02:16:06.979 --> 02:16:08.939]  They're giving drugs and vaccines.
[02:16:08.939 --> 02:16:14.020]  So I know they've gone after folks trying to promote colloidal silver as a cure.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:17.581]  We don't say it's a cure because I don't believe it's a dead ringer cure.
[02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:26.847]  I think it's that word, because then, you know, I couldn't get rid of a chest cold that had killed three members of my family this winter.
[02:16:26.847 --> 02:16:29.589]  My dad had had it for two months, I'd had it for a month and a half.
[02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:33.392]  I went over to his house every day and made him drink basically three bottles of coital silver.
[02:16:33.392 --> 02:16:34.313]  I drank two.
[02:16:34.313 --> 02:16:35.774]  Way over what you should do.
[02:16:35.774 --> 02:16:38.337]  Probably not good for you at that level.
[02:16:38.337 --> 02:16:42.300]  But I did it because it was better than what I had in my lungs and antibiotics hadn't worked.
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:44.262]  I was off antibiotics, two rounds had failed.
[02:16:45.433 --> 02:16:48.014]  It knocked it out, killed it, praise God.
[02:16:48.014 --> 02:16:49.915]  That's my own personal experience.
[02:16:49.915 --> 02:16:52.796]  And so, yes, there are runs on it everywhere.
[02:16:52.796 --> 02:17:02.099]  We still have a little bit left that came in, it'll be a couple more weeks until we get more in after that, of the 30 parts per million, which it's all technically nano-silver when it's that small, silver bullet.
[02:17:02.099 --> 02:17:03.980]  So I'm aware of all that stuff that's going on.
[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:07.001]  I've been talking to Dr. Group, he's been talking to them.
[02:17:07.001 --> 02:17:13.704]  It's just that I, it's not that I'm even afraid of the FDA, it's that I legitimately
[02:17:15.265 --> 02:17:20.247]  Don't think, in my view and from the medical doctors I've talked to, that you can say it's a cure.
[02:17:20.247 --> 02:17:27.210]  I mean, my God, if somebody's got some colloidal silver and they contract Ebola, I mean, it probably helps, but can you say it's going to knock it out?
[02:17:27.210 --> 02:17:28.170]  It all depends on the person.
[02:17:29.943 --> 02:17:32.345]  But yeah, staying away from people that have it.
[02:17:32.345 --> 02:17:33.325]  Sunshine.
[02:17:33.325 --> 02:17:35.487]  Getting your guts cleaned out.
[02:17:35.487 --> 02:17:39.409]  Not having deficiencies of things.
[02:17:39.409 --> 02:17:43.572]  What I'm doing is Beyond Tangy Tangerine from 4WarsHealth.com.
[02:17:43.572 --> 02:17:45.173]  Survival Shield.
[02:17:45.173 --> 02:17:45.693]  Silver Bullet.
[02:17:45.693 --> 02:17:48.235]  I've taken Silver Bullet twice today.
[02:17:48.235 --> 02:17:50.676]  And I got a cabinet full of cloyal silver.
[02:17:50.676 --> 02:17:53.978]  And I think ours is one of the best out there, but I don't know.
[02:17:53.978 --> 02:17:56.400]  I've got like five brands in my house.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:56.740]  Literally.
[02:17:59.232 --> 02:18:00.393]  I had a bad feeling.
[02:18:00.393 --> 02:18:04.637]  I never acted like this when I had three fan members die earlier this year.
[02:18:04.637 --> 02:18:07.600]  And I went and I just, and silver knocks it out for me.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:11.383]  I thought, I said on air, I said, I think this winter is going to be hellish.
[02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:13.905]  With all the MRSA and all the rest of it.
[02:18:13.905 --> 02:18:17.609]  And I said, you know, I'm stocking up on this separately myself.
[02:18:17.609 --> 02:18:22.913]  I've got a whole cabinet full of five different brands, whole bottom shelf is my brand.
[02:18:22.913 --> 02:18:24.935]  And then the other shelves are full of other stuff.
[02:18:24.935 --> 02:18:25.476]  Cause you know,
[02:18:26.812 --> 02:18:28.315]  I got family getting sick or dying again.
[02:18:28.315 --> 02:18:30.799]  I mean, I'm going to just be pouring silver down them.
[02:18:30.799 --> 02:18:31.820]  Because that's what it does.
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:33.483]  It goes around killing viruses and bacteria.
[02:18:33.483 --> 02:18:34.464]  We know that.
[02:18:34.464 --> 02:18:35.666]  But I don't think you can say it's a cure.
[02:18:36.852 --> 02:18:41.295]  But everybody always knew they should keep milk good by throwing silver dollars in it, back before they had refrigeration.
[02:18:41.295 --> 02:18:44.197]  They used to put it on babies' chests when they were born.
[02:18:44.197 --> 02:18:46.218]  There's a reason the elites would eat off silver.
[02:18:46.218 --> 02:18:54.003]  Everyone's known this for thousands of years, folks, that silver is a magical metal when it comes to your body's health.
[02:18:54.003 --> 02:18:57.385]  Now, too much of it can give you... only a few people have gotten this.
[02:18:57.385 --> 02:19:03.749]  If you drink massive amounts of it for years and years, you know, you can get a little bit of blue tinge in your nose where the capillaries are.
[02:19:03.749 --> 02:19:04.870]  You can have it precipitate out.
[02:19:06.072 --> 02:19:10.196]  But if you live in an area with high copper, you can get, you know, similar things like that, too.
[02:19:10.196 --> 02:19:14.920]  But I've had medical doctors on about it, so do your own research, consult your physician, but that's what I'm doing.
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:17.002]  I didn't mean to cut you off, caller.
[02:19:17.002 --> 02:19:19.504]  And listen, I gotta go to calls.
[02:19:19.504 --> 02:19:20.305]  I gotta go to calls.
[02:19:20.305 --> 02:19:29.513]  We're gonna come back and go to racist, then we're gonna go to everybody else that's been patiently holding, Kyle, James, Anthony, and others.
[02:19:29.513 --> 02:19:32.396]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag about colloidal silver.
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:36.721]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:36.721 --> 02:19:39.222]  PresidentPlanet.tv is the nightly news website.
[02:19:39.222 --> 02:19:43.484]  I'll be on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central as well, with the other co-hosts.

[02:19:45.985 --> 02:19:49.566]  Then I'll be back this Sunday, live in studio, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:19:49.566 --> 02:19:50.027]  Central.
[02:19:50.027 --> 02:19:58.030]  And our reporters, Anthony Gucciardi and Paul Joseph Watson, will be up in Dallas, reporting live throughout the weekend.
[02:19:59.699 --> 02:20:05.021]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:20:05.021 --> 02:20:07.022]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:20:07.022 --> 02:20:10.784]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[02:20:10.784 --> 02:20:14.986]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[02:20:14.986 --> 02:20:21.709]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[02:20:21.709 --> 02:20:25.571]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[02:20:25.571 --> 02:20:27.112]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:20:29.835 --> 02:20:30.836]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:20:30.836 --> 02:20:34.277]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:34.277 --> 02:20:35.958]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:35.958 --> 02:20:37.898]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:37.898 --> 02:20:43.740]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:44.581]  I know, right?
[02:20:44.581 --> 02:20:45.881]  You love it, too!
[02:20:45.881 --> 02:20:47.322]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:20:47.322 --> 02:20:48.342]  Let's go get some.
[02:20:48.342 --> 02:20:50.103]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.

[02:20:58.797 --> 02:21:03.461]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[02:21:03.461 --> 02:21:15.812]  This, combined with several other unidentified viruses, have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[02:21:15.812 --> 02:21:25.781]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell

[02:21:55.010 --> 02:22:04.673]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:22:04.673 --> 02:22:08.534]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:22:08.534 --> 02:22:13.616]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:22:14.056 --> 02:22:15.578]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:22:15.578 --> 02:22:19.061]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:22:19.061 --> 02:22:22.605]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:22:22.605 --> 02:22:28.591]  After consuming One World Away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:22:28.591 --> 02:22:35.597]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:22:35.597 --> 02:22:37.980]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:42.482]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:22:42.482 --> 02:22:43.422]  Wow!
[02:22:43.422 --> 02:22:43.783]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:22:58.132 --> 02:22:59.533]  You know about RVs.
[02:22:59.533 --> 02:23:00.993]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:23:00.993 --> 02:23:03.754]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:23:03.754 --> 02:23:06.495]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[02:23:06.495 --> 02:23:08.656]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[02:23:27.862 --> 02:23:32.764]  I'm watching and waiting for the right time to take everything you own.
[02:23:32.764 --> 02:23:34.324]  I love a dark house.
[02:23:34.324 --> 02:23:36.425]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:23:36.425 --> 02:23:45.087]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.
[02:23:45.087 --> 02:23:46.508]  Don't these people ever leave?
[02:23:46.508 --> 02:23:49.549]  Starting at $24.95 and there's free shipping.

[02:23:55.511 --> 02:23:56.691]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[02:24:05.242 --> 02:24:08.444]  Look at these headlines on Drudge.
[02:24:08.444 --> 02:24:10.786]  Look at these headlines on Drudge.
[02:24:34.514 --> 02:24:35.935]  That's what the Fed should have done day one.
[02:24:35.935 --> 02:24:38.076]  If you work around that, you don't then leave.
[02:24:38.076 --> 02:24:40.097]  That's why it's supposed to go to military bases.
[02:24:40.097 --> 02:24:42.499]  Controversy over self-monitoring developing.
[02:24:42.499 --> 02:24:49.162]  New Obama czar has no medical health background, but he knows how to divvy up the billions to friends of the Clintons.
[02:24:49.162 --> 02:24:52.224]  And he's in charge of that cashola.
[02:24:52.224 --> 02:24:54.385]  Let's talk to Racist in Texas.
[02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:56.506]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:24:56.506 --> 02:24:57.707]  God bless you, brother.
[02:24:57.707 --> 02:24:58.708]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:58.708 --> 02:25:00.669]  This is Wild Man Class Racist here.
[02:25:03.306 --> 02:25:06.309]  As the Open Mic stated, we are screwed.
[02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:18.781]  I mean, if it's not going to be the Ebola-Obola thing, or the open borders, or in the open skies, and ISIS, and World War III, which we're already in that anyway, countries are imploding from within, including ours.
[02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:28.330]  It's one of the utmost universities in teaching medical, over half, according to the poll that Joe Biggs did.
[02:25:29.105 --> 02:25:35.452]  Uh, elected said that, yeah, bring a bowl of patients over here and over half of those said, yeah, we'll entertain them in our home.
[02:25:35.452 --> 02:25:36.333]  I mean, my God!
[02:25:36.333 --> 02:25:38.636]  Yeah, we're screwed.
[02:25:38.636 --> 02:25:40.298]  It's crazy!
[02:25:41.035 --> 02:25:49.462]  That's what the reporter said and we're not only screwed, we're racist because we're like the other African countries wanting to seal our borders or stop the flights.
[02:25:49.462 --> 02:25:51.404]  We're not allowed to.
[02:25:51.404 --> 02:25:57.529]  So Al Gore's buddy can divvy up all the money and Obama can decide where to spend it now once it spreads.
[02:25:57.529 --> 02:26:00.411]  And they're doing it in front of us.
[02:26:00.411 --> 02:26:03.233]  That's what's so crazy is they think they're going to get away with it.
[02:26:03.233 --> 02:26:04.494]  What do you think is really going on here?
[02:26:04.494 --> 02:26:07.357]  I think they're going to
[02:26:07.952 --> 02:26:11.117]  They got the FEMA camp and stuff in place.
[02:26:11.117 --> 02:26:12.259]  They want martial law.
[02:26:12.259 --> 02:26:13.902]  I think it's a free saver to that.
[02:26:13.902 --> 02:26:18.470]  My dad said, I had to call her earlier, said something about going on strike and you're saying that.
[02:26:18.470 --> 02:26:19.592]  My dad said that back in the 80s.
[02:26:20.393 --> 02:26:29.782]  Well, we've got to go on strike starting Monday through Wednesday.
[02:26:29.782 --> 02:26:34.106]  The article's going to go on Infowars.com soon to make Obama and them do their job.
[02:26:34.106 --> 02:26:40.411]  And it will bare minimum draw attention, but if a lot of people stay home and then are active on the internet with phone calls...
[02:26:41.212 --> 02:27:05.744]  When this happens, and it's also a drill for sheltering in place, for quarantining, self-quarantining, as a national drill, Americans, here's the headline, Americans on their own prepare for the outbreak with a national, you know, grassroots shelter-in-place self-quarantine, Monday through Wednesday, to draw attention to the government refusing to respond, leaving the borders open, and issuing visas to West Africans.
[02:27:05.744 --> 02:27:10.206]  There's your headline, there's your article, and if people understand that, and if our listeners
[02:27:11.434 --> 02:27:14.936]  As a core cadre, 3 million a day that listen on average.
[02:27:14.936 --> 02:27:18.638]  Millions more out on the internet after that.
[02:27:18.638 --> 02:27:21.820]  Take our article that's going up in the next few hours, send it out.
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:26.202]  Kurt Nimmo is going to do a petition on the White House, basically with the same information.
[02:27:26.202 --> 02:27:28.464]  If you get it out, other people get involved.
[02:27:28.464 --> 02:27:29.704]  I don't even want the credit.
[02:27:29.704 --> 02:27:32.646]  Folks can take the idea for a national strike and say it's yours.
[02:27:32.646 --> 02:27:33.126]  I don't care.
[02:27:34.307 --> 02:27:37.849]  I want to stop Ebola, and we've got to force their hand.
[02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:38.770]  I think that's the answer.
[02:27:38.770 --> 02:27:39.850]  God bless you.
[02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:47.695]  Let's talk to Kyle in New York, where you've got flights coming in from Nigeria, people dying in pools of vomit, but they said everything's fine.
[02:27:47.695 --> 02:27:49.696]  Within minutes, he didn't have Ebola.
[02:27:49.696 --> 02:27:58.340]  Even though it takes days to do the test, they said to do the property test, hours to do the preliminary, they said, don't worry, people dying in pools of vomit, everything's fine.
[02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:01.662]  And they're finding people dead in pools of vomit in Houston out of Nigeria?
[02:28:01.662 --> 02:28:02.383]  Everything's fine.
[02:28:03.308 --> 02:28:07.371]  Uh, do you believe that for a second?
[02:28:07.371 --> 02:28:09.392]  No, absolutely not, Alex.
[02:28:09.392 --> 02:28:10.532]  Is that because you're racist?
[02:28:10.532 --> 02:28:13.174]  You don't believe our Lord and Savior Obama?
[02:28:13.174 --> 02:28:13.955]  That must be right.
[02:28:13.955 --> 02:28:16.096]  I must be racist then.
[02:28:16.096 --> 02:28:18.717]  I must be racist for myself for getting prepared, actually.
[02:28:18.717 --> 02:28:20.278]  That's pretty racist, yeah.
[02:28:20.278 --> 02:28:20.639]  It is.
[02:28:20.639 --> 02:28:21.779]  I ordered some hazmat suits.
[02:28:21.779 --> 02:28:23.620]  How racist is that?
[02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:26.062]  Whoa!
[02:28:26.062 --> 02:28:29.444]  Well, you know, hazmat suits are secretly Grand Dragon outfits.
[02:28:29.444 --> 02:28:30.825]  Little pointed tops on them.
[02:28:31.949 --> 02:28:37.591]  I just want to say I've always been against vaccinations, and I ordered some of your products.
[02:28:37.591 --> 02:28:38.471]  I love your products.
[02:28:38.471 --> 02:28:39.151]  Thank you.
[02:28:39.151 --> 02:28:43.153]  I got the Fluoride Shield, the Survival Shield, the Lung Cleanse.
[02:28:43.153 --> 02:28:50.695]  I just started taking the Fluoride Shield and Survival Shield, and I'll tell you what, my moods have changed in the last couple days already, and I think they're working great.
[02:28:50.695 --> 02:28:55.757]  Oh yeah, when you don't have iodine in you and other key stuff, you're not operating like you're supposed to.
[02:28:55.757 --> 02:29:00.939]  It's what your thyroid that runs all your, you know, basically hormones, regulates stuff, operates on.
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:03.061]  Go ahead.
[02:29:03.061 --> 02:29:05.662]  And I also think that your lung cleanse off product is great too.
[02:29:05.662 --> 02:29:10.445]  That clears up my weird allergy infections in like two days compared to anything else that they give me.
[02:29:10.445 --> 02:29:10.825]  It's real.
[02:29:10.825 --> 02:29:12.706]  It's super powerful.
[02:29:12.706 --> 02:29:13.287]  It really is.
[02:29:13.287 --> 02:29:25.654]  And I just want to say that they are planning for it to spread because yesterday it was announced that two of our hospitals in New York State here are all of a sudden prepared for Ebola patients, which I think is not correct.
[02:29:25.654 --> 02:29:29.296]  They said upstate medical and the one in Rochester, I can't remember it.
[02:29:31.042 --> 02:29:35.325]  Oh yeah, they're saying get ready for Ebola.
[02:29:35.325 --> 02:29:36.226]  Well, God bless you brother.
[02:29:36.226 --> 02:29:37.607]  Anything else, Kyle?
[02:29:37.607 --> 02:29:38.988]  Yeah, I just wanted to say I agree with you.
[02:29:38.988 --> 02:29:43.011]  I think they are in a complete stand down and we gotta work together to get this done.
[02:29:43.011 --> 02:29:48.254]  I signed a petition to ban all flights and I'm trying to do my best to get the word around.
[02:29:48.254 --> 02:29:48.975]  Alright, God bless you.
[02:29:48.975 --> 02:29:49.475]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:59.994 --> 02:30:01.315]  The experts are clear.
[02:30:01.315 --> 02:30:08.443]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:30:08.443 --> 02:30:14.729]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:30:14.729 --> 02:30:18.293]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:30:18.433 --> 02:30:22.654]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:30:22.654 --> 02:30:27.955]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed and areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:30:27.955 --> 02:30:28.976]  Not our iodine.
[02:30:28.976 --> 02:30:35.317]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:30:37.358 --> 02:30:38.938]  See the informational videos.

[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:45.760]  We're good.
[02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:09.818]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:09.818 --> 02:31:19.745]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:19.745 --> 02:31:22.667]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:31:22.867 --> 02:31:23.147]  I think?
[02:31:37.824 --> 02:31:38.084]  We're good.
[02:32:00.166 --> 02:32:06.410]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:06.410 --> 02:32:09.092]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:09.092 --> 02:32:16.117]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:16.117 --> 02:32:19.119]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:19.119 --> 02:32:22.162]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:22.162 --> 02:32:24.083]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:24.083 --> 02:32:26.925]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:27.005 --> 02:32:32.727]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:32.727 --> 02:32:36.248]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:36.248 --> 02:32:39.329]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:32:39.329 --> 02:32:46.651]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:32:46.651 --> 02:32:49.872]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:32:56.254 --> 02:32:56.835]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:14.144 --> 02:33:18.090]  Well, it sounds like the perfect script for a horror movie.
[02:33:18.090 --> 02:33:23.457]  A virus with no vaccine and no cure kills thousands of people.
[02:33:23.457 --> 02:33:24.759]  Five billion people died in 1996 and 1997.
[02:33:24.759 --> 02:33:25.841]  Almost the entire population of the world.
[02:33:32.611 --> 02:33:34.172]  Only about 1% of us survived.
[02:33:34.172 --> 02:33:39.435]  More reports of flu cases along the border, but officials are saying they aren't connected.
[02:33:39.435 --> 02:33:44.978]  Surely there's very real and very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
[02:33:44.978 --> 02:33:50.221]  And I actually think the world will be much better when there's only 10 or 20% of us left.
[02:33:50.221 --> 02:33:52.102]  Dr. Eric Bianca.
[02:33:52.102 --> 02:33:56.725]  But most frightening was the fact that in a crowd of over 1,000 prominent scientists,
[02:33:57.445 --> 02:34:18.424]  Local newspapers reported that 95% of those in attendance gave Bianca sustained standing ovations every time he extolled the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction and went on to laud the virtues of Ebola because it would kill 90% of the world population quickly.
[02:34:19.325 --> 02:34:30.356]  The World Health Organization said on Tuesday the Ebola death toll jumped by almost 200 in a single day to at least 2,296 and is likely to be higher than that.
[02:34:30.356 --> 02:34:31.317]  The head of the U.S.
[02:34:31.317 --> 02:34:40.667]  Centers for Disease Control confirmed Tuesday that West Africa is in a desperate situation, but that there is still hope that the outbreak can be reined in.
[02:34:41.147 --> 02:34:49.631]  A top German virologist has caused shockwaves by asserting that it's too late to halt the spread of the Ebola virus.
[02:34:49.631 --> 02:34:55.413]  In other news, the CDC is receiving reports of a possible flu outbreak in San Francisco.
[02:34:55.413 --> 02:35:02.136]  If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on December 27, 1996, that makes us know that.
[02:35:02.136 --> 02:35:06.118]  It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996.
[02:35:06.118 --> 02:35:08.419]  And it was seen sequentially after that year?
[02:35:09.474 --> 02:35:18.902]  San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
[02:35:18.902 --> 02:35:23.646]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking.
[02:35:23.646 --> 02:35:25.447]  That's some trip you're taking, sir.
[02:35:25.447 --> 02:35:26.808]  Is this all in one week?
[02:35:26.808 --> 02:35:27.149]  Business.
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:35.482]  One of the two Americans infected with the Ebola virus has arrived in Atlanta from Africa for treatment.
[02:35:35.482 --> 02:35:42.464]  The Massachusetts doctor arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center just before dawn this morning to be treated for Ebola.
[02:35:42.464 --> 02:35:47.946]  And right now, his or her blood sample is on its way to the Centers for Disease Control.
[02:35:47.946 --> 02:35:52.807]  A new ability to wage war is born from the blood that went for the victims.
[02:35:52.807 --> 02:35:54.467]  There you see?
[02:35:54.467 --> 02:35:55.988]  Also invisible to the naked eye.
[02:35:56.869 --> 02:36:01.631]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[02:36:01.631 --> 02:36:06.453]  This Ebola outbreak is unprecedented and has become the deadliest on record.
[02:36:06.453 --> 02:36:09.654]  Ebola is now an epidemic.
[02:36:09.654 --> 02:36:15.776]  You start to get a sense of the rapid escalation now we're seeing of the virus.
[02:36:15.776 --> 02:36:22.339]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure.
[02:36:22.739 --> 02:36:32.027]  Without specific drugs or a vaccine for Ebola, the only thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease is treat their symptoms.
[02:36:32.027 --> 02:36:35.609]  Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[02:36:35.609 --> 02:36:41.394]  One will not likely catch the virus just by nearing someone who has it.
[02:36:41.394 --> 02:36:44.677]  In 1989, Ebola made its way to the U.S.
[02:36:44.677 --> 02:36:48.500]  This new strain of Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air.
[02:36:49.332 --> 02:36:52.013]  They are now calling this a true pandemic.
[02:36:52.013 --> 02:36:55.095]  Five years on, still no cure.
[02:36:55.095 --> 02:37:02.378]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given £31 million to help battle the Ebola epidemic in Africa.
[02:37:02.378 --> 02:37:08.461]  It is hoped it will also speed up the development of drugs and vaccines as Ebola has killed more than half of its 4,300 victims.
[02:37:10.843 --> 02:37:12.685]  First, we've got population.
[02:37:12.685 --> 02:37:20.455]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:37:20.455 --> 02:37:27.545]  A preventative vaccine for the Ebola virus could be available as early as next year, as British pharma company GlaxoSmithKline
[02:37:27.765 --> 02:37:42.253]  So you want to balance the need to get a potentially effective vaccine to the people who need it in a way that you can get some meaningful information as to A, whether it does work or not, and whether it does harm.
[02:37:42.253 --> 02:37:52.899]  A confidential GlaxoSmithKline document recently linked to the press exposed that within a two-year period, a total of 36 infants died after receiving the 6-in-1 vaccine of Infarix.
[02:37:54.139 --> 02:38:05.545]  UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline will plead guilty and pay a record-breaking 3 billion US dollars to settle the largest case of healthcare fraud in US history.
[02:38:05.545 --> 02:38:07.986]  I'm going right out to get vaccinated.
[02:38:07.986 --> 02:38:14.289]  The vaccine uses a modified chimpanzee common cold virus to carry a single Ebola protein.
[02:38:14.289 --> 02:38:16.970]  We're ready to move on to the next phase.
[02:38:16.970 --> 02:38:18.011]  Does it work?
[02:38:18.011 --> 02:38:18.771]  Like we predicted.
[02:38:19.668 --> 02:38:21.530]  With one exception.
[02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:22.651]  Can't dawdle on this one.
[02:38:22.651 --> 02:38:30.420]  We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can.
[02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:33.123]  Nearly two and a half thousand people have died.
[02:38:33.123 --> 02:38:34.644]  Thousands more have been infected.
[02:38:34.644 --> 02:38:35.926]  It's now four more thousand.
[02:38:36.226 --> 02:38:37.988]  That's a very long number.
[02:38:54.009 --> 02:38:56.950]  Complete and total hegemonic domination.
[02:38:56.950 --> 02:39:09.535]  At the request of the Liberian government, we're going to establish a military command center in Liberia, under the pretext of humanitarian aid, and dominate and occupy Africa through AFRICOM.
[02:39:09.535 --> 02:39:13.717]  The security firm HaloCorp announced it will conduct a zombie apocalypse training exercise.
[02:39:15.345 --> 02:39:21.726]  Al-Faraji will join about 40 other ghoulish friends in the Third World Village, where they'll bring on the apocalypse.
[02:39:21.726 --> 02:39:28.368]  Strategic Operations has trained some 600,000 military and law enforcement members using this technique.
[02:39:28.368 --> 02:39:30.548]  We've got down to a science, if you will.
[02:39:30.548 --> 02:39:32.469]  If there is such a thing, it's an art.
[02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:35.249]  It's a government-made virus.
[02:39:35.249 --> 02:39:38.890]  Designed, manufactured to put us out of our misery.
[02:39:38.890 --> 02:39:40.850]  They euthanized us.
[02:39:40.850 --> 02:39:43.771]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[02:39:44.818 --> 02:39:49.760]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:50.680]  Attention.
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:58.222]  Due to the extremity of the simian flu crisis, all regular government functions have been suspended indefinitely.
[02:39:58.222 --> 02:40:07.825]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:40:07.825 --> 02:40:10.146]  Ah, that promo's about a month old.
[02:40:10.146 --> 02:40:13.327]  A little more than a month old.
[02:40:13.327 --> 02:40:14.347]  You can call it a promo.
[02:40:17.233 --> 02:40:22.778]  Here's the headline, AP, Africa stems Ebola via border crossings.
[02:40:22.778 --> 02:40:32.326]  And it goes on to say all the countries bordering the nations that have Ebola have stopped it, and there's no cases, for months because they allow no flights and no one's allowed to come in.
[02:40:32.326 --> 02:40:35.428]  And if they catch you trying to come across, you know what the army does?
[02:40:35.428 --> 02:40:39.432]  They shoot you.
[02:40:39.432 --> 02:40:40.613]  And no one dare try.
[02:40:40.613 --> 02:40:44.456]  Because even if you sneak across sometimes, most of the time you're going to get killed.
[02:40:46.459 --> 02:40:56.962]  That's why you have borders is when there's an outbreak in one country, you seal the border like firewalls in a ship or in a building.
[02:40:56.962 --> 02:41:02.064]  These are all blueprints how to stop this and they turned them off.
[02:41:02.064 --> 02:41:03.825]  But our ship had firewalls.
[02:41:03.825 --> 02:41:07.606]  Obama ordered them torn out.
[02:41:07.606 --> 02:41:10.407]  Our ship had floodwalls.
[02:41:10.407 --> 02:41:12.547]  It had bulkheads.
[02:41:12.547 --> 02:41:14.328]  They came with blowtorches and cut them out.
[02:41:17.878 --> 02:41:25.060]  And they wouldn't be doing something this crazy if they weren't planning to spread it on purpose.
[02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:37.425]  See, if we're watching and can catch them doing a false flag, like bringing in Al-Qaeda or something, well they'll just do something like bring in Ebola, and do it in plain view like we're so stupid, and then pose as saviors in their response to it.
[02:41:37.425 --> 02:41:39.625]  So, we don't have long.
[02:41:39.625 --> 02:41:41.006]  I'd give it a week.
[02:41:41.006 --> 02:41:42.926]  It may already be too late.
[02:41:42.926 --> 02:41:44.367]  If we can have a national strike,
[02:41:45.942 --> 02:42:11.759]  If all the media gets involved, nobody else has picked up on this that I've seen, if they pick up on our idea to have a national strike over Ebola, that our guest, James David Steele, the CIA, retired CIA field operative, if we go with what he said, he said, I think Ebola is going to be staged, it's going to be released, there's going to be a national strike over this false flag.
[02:42:11.759 --> 02:42:14.561]  And then he didn't want to talk about his prediction when he was on with us last week.
[02:42:15.435 --> 02:42:17.977]  Don't want to get into it too much.
[02:42:17.977 --> 02:42:19.217]  He will be on Sunday.
[02:42:19.217 --> 02:42:21.139]  I'll be live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:42:21.139 --> 02:42:22.479]  I wasn't here that day last week.
[02:42:22.479 --> 02:42:26.002]  I was dealing with my sick grandmother and other things.
[02:42:26.002 --> 02:42:41.932]  That's another thing, is that, you know how family stuff, there'll be no family problems for like 10, 15 years, and then, oh, uncle dies, grandma's sick and has to go to the nursing home and has medical problems, and this family crisis pops up, and this family member has this issue,
[02:42:45.299 --> 02:42:47.720]  It has been a very eventful last 12 months.
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:50.441]  I am ready for this cycle to end.
[02:42:50.441 --> 02:43:01.624]  We've never had more success reaching people, never had more success in the news operation, but... I want success in turning the tide.
[02:43:01.624 --> 02:43:09.867]  I... I get so exhausted sometimes by the third hour.
[02:43:09.867 --> 02:43:13.368]  I kind of barrel through it being angry and sarcastic the first two hours, but...
[02:43:19.178 --> 02:43:21.020]  I just can't believe how bad our government is.
[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:22.321]  I just can't believe how evil they are.
[02:43:22.321 --> 02:43:24.403]  They are just the worst.
[02:43:24.403 --> 02:43:26.264]  They are so evil.
[02:43:26.264 --> 02:43:33.451]  They have such twisted ways of thinking and doing things.
[02:43:33.451 --> 02:43:35.572]  It's the slow motion train wreck I don't like.
[02:43:35.572 --> 02:43:45.161]  I'm going to have to watch them spread Ebola, and watch them grandstand, and watch them take our rights, and watch them make money off of it with the Al Gore scammer they've got running it.
[02:43:49.086 --> 02:43:51.888]  Don't they ever get brought to justice?
[02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:59.172]  No, they'll probably just arrest more Tea Party people and set up more folks for crooked toenails or not filing their taxes right.
[02:43:59.172 --> 02:44:06.597]  Or they'll probably arrest some more pro-lifers or something, I don't know.
[02:44:06.597 --> 02:44:12.720]  Meanwhile, you got the University of Texas students, 17 out of 30, want to bring Ebola patients here and house them in their homes.
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:15.062]  Just mental midgets.
[02:44:15.062 --> 02:44:17.063]  Prey, just helpless little idiots.
[02:44:18.695 --> 02:44:21.278]  Arrested development, just pathetic.
[02:44:21.278 --> 02:44:25.642]  Watch TV their whole lives, never been challenged, never even been in a fight, never really had to work a job.
[02:44:25.642 --> 02:44:32.689]  They all just get government funding.
[02:44:32.689 --> 02:44:38.095]  Just shuffling around, just empty.
[02:44:38.095 --> 02:44:40.958]  And then we try to protect them from the globalist takeover and they don't want to be protected.
[02:44:43.971 --> 02:44:50.513]  Instead they serve the enemy and want our guns and our kids and want to arrest pastors in Houston for their speech.
[02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:52.593]  I mean, what a freak show!
[02:44:52.593 --> 02:44:55.394]  What a freak show!
[02:44:55.394 --> 02:45:00.615]  What a freak show!
[02:45:00.615 --> 02:45:04.236]  James in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:45:04.236 --> 02:45:05.896]  Yes Alex, can you hear me?
[02:45:05.896 --> 02:45:07.857]  I can hear you brother, go ahead.
[02:45:07.857 --> 02:45:11.098]  Hey man, I'm down here about 30 miles west of our
[02:45:12.959 --> 02:45:15.620]  That's our nation's ground zero.
[02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:30.667]  Um, the cleaning guys, the guys that have been running around cleaning up this Ebola mess, about six months ago I was working with them, and I kind of quit when, you know, I found out that Ebola was getting big for me talking about it in other countries, because I knew there would be good guys cleaning it up.
[02:45:32.162 --> 02:45:36.447]  Well, sir, you need to prove you're not racist and run to the scene and eat the vomit.
[02:45:36.447 --> 02:45:41.533]  The vomit of an Ebola victim is the only thing as holy as Obama himself.
[02:45:41.533 --> 02:45:42.674]  You didn't know that?
[02:45:42.674 --> 02:45:44.096]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:44.096 --> 02:45:50.243]  And I'll tell you from the hours and days of planning, I've had to suck a load of crap.
[02:45:50.243 --> 02:45:51.824]  They're lying to us.
[02:45:51.824 --> 02:45:52.966]  And the people are eating it up.
[02:45:55.219 --> 02:45:56.740]  Well, some of them are.
[02:45:56.740 --> 02:46:00.623]  I mean, we know the UT students that literally can hardly talk are.
[02:46:00.623 --> 02:46:04.706]  They're paying $400,000 to have a worthless education, but they can watch Bevo.
[02:46:04.706 --> 02:46:06.868]  That's OK, because Bevo's there.
[02:46:06.868 --> 02:46:11.491]  But if you expand on that, the polls show people hate the CDC and hate Obama.
[02:46:11.491 --> 02:46:12.212]  But they don't care.
[02:46:12.212 --> 02:46:15.754]  He hates us even more.
[02:46:15.754 --> 02:46:22.880]  So you quit doing, I guess you work for an environmental cleanup group, and you foresaw Ebola coming?
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:23.040]  Yeah.
[02:46:25.069 --> 02:46:29.874]  Yeah, I mean... Oh, for the same reason I do everything else.
[02:46:29.874 --> 02:46:35.159]  I just watch the left hand while they're doing something with the right.
[02:46:50.782 --> 02:46:51.343]  It blows my mind.
[02:46:51.343 --> 02:46:53.665]  But since Obama's got all his specialists that know better than...
[02:47:07.734 --> 02:47:08.494]  No, I agree.
[02:47:08.494 --> 02:47:14.596]  We should have a petition that they house at least the dirty diapers of Ebola victims in the Oval Office.
[02:47:25.998 --> 02:47:26.819]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:47:26.819 --> 02:47:29.060]  People say, well, Obama doesn't act on it.
[02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:29.661]  It doesn't matter.
[02:47:29.661 --> 02:47:32.463]  It draws attention that there's a petition up there.
[02:47:32.463 --> 02:47:41.450]  So I think we should have a petition to store the medical waste of the Ebola victims there at the White House, since you can't get it, Obama said.
[02:47:41.450 --> 02:47:43.111]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:43.111 --> 02:47:48.656]  It's like that Conrad the Constitution episode where they fall down the giant toilet.
[02:47:48.656 --> 02:47:51.538]  Following the Affordable Care Act, they find out it all comes out at the White House.
[02:47:55.356 --> 02:47:56.257]  I haven't looked at that in a while.
[02:47:56.257 --> 02:47:58.880]  What's the latest Conrad Constitution?
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:01.624]  Starring Alex Jones and Ron Paul.
[02:48:01.624 --> 02:48:03.886]  Anthony in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:03.886 --> 02:48:05.829]  Hello?
[02:48:05.829 --> 02:48:07.811]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:08.472]  I'm doing pretty good!
[02:48:11.094 --> 02:48:14.979]  Listen, I got a comment.
[02:48:14.979 --> 02:48:26.395]  Another reason why I think this so-called war against us is ISIS is the fact that why would a terrorist organization name themselves after an Egyptian goddess?
[02:48:27.278 --> 02:48:40.945]  Well look, sir, it's all was thought up in a PR boardroom, probably in Hollywood or New York, as a way to, so the American people who can hardly talk could go, ISIS, oh, Khorasan, oh.
[02:48:40.945 --> 02:48:50.470]  I mean, it's on record it was created by the West and funded and armed, and then they go, and then now NATO is fighter-bombing the Kurds that are fighting them.
[02:48:50.470 --> 02:48:53.872]  So NATO is giving air support to Al-Qaeda, that's Obama's operation.
[02:48:54.975 --> 02:49:05.429]  The thing is, ISIS is going to go in there and slaughter them people, and then the Turks can just sit across the border and go... You know what I'm saying?
[02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:08.753]  That's right, and uh, it's only Woody Woodpecker, I like it.
[02:49:08.753 --> 02:49:12.998]  FX series, Archer removes ISIS spy agency name from upcoming season.
[02:49:14.099 --> 02:49:17.701]  See, they had a spy agency named ISIS, they're all just throwing it in our face.
[02:49:17.701 --> 02:49:37.315]  I talked to people involved in X-Men and Lone Gunmen, on record, and the CIA came to them and said, we think you should put an episode where the government flies hijacked jets in the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan and invade using a terror drill to make NORAD stand down, claiming there's hijackers on board.
[02:49:37.315 --> 02:49:40.177]  And that's why they had an episode six months before 9-11 of just that happening.
[02:49:41.447 --> 02:49:43.108]  It's all about flaunting it.
[02:49:43.108 --> 02:49:52.151]  That's why the CIA declassified that indeed they'd harassed and tried to destroy Gary Webb for his CIA drug dealing story.
[02:49:52.151 --> 02:49:56.472]  They released it just to say, hey, we'll do this to anybody we don't like.
[02:49:56.472 --> 02:50:01.254]  They publicly said it's all true.
[02:50:01.254 --> 02:50:03.935]  Yeah.
[02:50:03.935 --> 02:50:06.796]  They came out a month ago and they said, you bet.
[02:50:07.898 --> 02:50:12.083]  And the Hollywood movie came out, and they basically admit they kill him, and that's just the way it is.
[02:50:12.083 --> 02:50:14.325]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:50:14.325 --> 02:50:16.267]  Yeah!
[02:50:16.267 --> 02:50:19.271]  Yeah, we're gonna abort more babies, too.
[02:50:19.271 --> 02:50:24.737]  And then we're gonna have you drink glyphosate, and we're gonna put it in all your food, and let you grow big ol' giant tumors.
[02:50:26.755 --> 02:50:30.837]  And then if you go up to the cash register and they go, should I give money for breast cancer research?
[02:50:30.837 --> 02:50:31.978]  You go, well, no, no.
[02:50:31.978 --> 02:50:38.721]  Actually, I'd like to give money, though, to preventing it, if we could get the glyphosates out and some other things that are shown to actually grow the tumors.
[02:50:38.721 --> 02:50:40.942]  Oh, you don't care about women?
[02:50:40.942 --> 02:50:42.122]  Sexist!
[02:50:42.122 --> 02:50:44.023]  Sexist, sexist!
[02:50:44.023 --> 02:50:45.584]  Sexist!
[02:50:45.584 --> 02:50:48.326]  I know one word and it means I'm an illegible.
[02:50:48.326 --> 02:50:48.766]  Sexist!
[02:50:49.506 --> 02:50:50.568]  Sizzles!
[02:50:50.568 --> 02:50:52.310]  And penguins can't swim!
[02:50:52.310 --> 02:50:53.872]  Al Gore said so!
[02:50:53.872 --> 02:50:55.214]  And I want to pay him money!
[02:50:55.214 --> 02:50:57.137]  Al Gore loves me!

[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:47.221]  Thanks for calling.
[02:55:54.107 --> 02:55:55.268]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:55:55.268 --> 02:55:56.690]  Good.
[02:55:56.690 --> 02:56:03.036]  You have scared the heck out of me for the past two years about these globalists and how they wanted to take down America.
[02:56:03.036 --> 02:56:07.561]  So I came up with an idea, but this idea won't work unless you help us with it.
[02:56:07.561 --> 02:56:11.085]  Basically what I'm looking for is to try and find out who these people are.
[02:56:11.701 --> 02:56:19.928]  In other words, if you had a website, put up their names, their addresses, and phone numbers on it, believe me, America, within six months, will take it back again.
[02:56:19.928 --> 02:56:24.391]  We'll have these people on the run, because we'll be pestering them so doggone much.
[02:56:24.391 --> 02:56:28.454]  I totally agree with you, but people have to realize the power they have, not the power that I have.
[02:56:28.454 --> 02:56:29.675]  I mean, all of us together.
[02:56:29.675 --> 02:56:32.337]  The article just went live on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:32.337 --> 02:56:33.999]  We're going to tweet it at RealAlexJones.
[02:56:33.999 --> 02:56:35.020]  Please retweet it, folks.
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:38.584]  It's hashtag stop Ebola strike.
[02:56:38.584 --> 02:56:42.389]  National strike to force Obama to block West Africa flights.
[02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:47.957]  Administration committing criminal neglect by failing to secure America against outbreak.
[02:56:47.957 --> 02:56:52.883]  And we also need to add in there and secure our border and prepare for the massive influx
[02:56:53.604 --> 02:56:56.848]  That General Kelly has warned about.
[02:56:56.848 --> 02:56:59.651]  We're going to keep beefing up this article, but this is it.
[02:56:59.651 --> 02:57:04.817]  We've got to push for the national strike next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[02:57:04.817 --> 02:57:07.320]  Even if a few percentage points of people don't go into work.
[02:57:08.126 --> 02:57:08.626]  No, that was it.
[02:57:08.626 --> 02:57:11.207]  I was just wondering whether we can get that website going with their names on it.
[02:57:33.036 --> 02:57:40.818]  Basically, what I'm looking for is a website that you might start with the names, addresses, and phone numbers of these people.
[02:57:40.818 --> 02:57:45.259]  America will get rid of them themselves just by pestering the heck out of them in six months.
[02:57:45.259 --> 02:57:54.801]  Well, we should point out and create a master list of the top globalists that are behind all this, so people just understand who needs to be investigated, who needs to be watched legally and lawfully.
[02:57:54.801 --> 02:57:56.501]  I agree with you.
[02:57:56.501 --> 02:57:58.002]  Let's talk to Roger in Connecticut.
[02:57:58.002 --> 02:57:58.662]  One minute to break.
[02:57:58.662 --> 02:57:59.742]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:58:01.377 --> 02:58:02.358]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:58:02.358 --> 02:58:10.022]  Thank you for picking up and God bless you and your family and for all the good work that you've done over the years.
[02:58:10.022 --> 02:58:13.784]  I want to talk about precautions real quick.
[02:58:13.784 --> 02:58:15.826]  I did order the Oxy-Powder.
[02:58:15.826 --> 02:58:19.488]  I've been taking it for the past seven days and it's amazing.
[02:58:19.488 --> 02:58:22.530]  So with that said, I feel like I have more energy.
[02:58:23.397 --> 02:58:33.602]  It's my new system, and also, as other precautions, I did, uh, I'm a distributor for Florida Research, and what, uh, what I've discovered about transfer factors...
[02:58:49.758 --> 02:58:56.921]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:58:56.921 --> 02:58:59.281]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:58:59.281 --> 02:59:04.563]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:59:04.563 --> 02:59:09.485]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:59:09.725 --> 02:59:13.048]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:59:13.048 --> 02:59:17.112]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:59:17.112 --> 02:59:21.437]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:59:21.437 --> 02:59:31.686]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:59:31.686 --> 02:59:34.209]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:36.291]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:05.819 --> 03:00:07.120]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:08.882]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.882 --> 03:00:10.644]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.644 --> 03:00:12.226]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.226 --> 03:00:13.788]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.788 --> 03:00:17.972]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.972 --> 03:00:23.558]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.558 --> 03:00:25.500]  Everybody needs to make YouTube videos about it.
[03:00:25.500 --> 03:00:26.882]  Everybody needs to send our article out.
[03:00:26.882 --> 03:00:27.763]  We're going to be beefing it up.
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:31.723]  Yeah, so I'm talking about cancer factors.
[03:00:49.962 --> 03:01:07.514]  And when I used to work as a distributor for For Life Research, I learned that these transfer factors, which are apparent, you can find them in the physician desk reference in the first page of the supplements, and they're proven to elevate your defenses by 487%.
[03:01:07.514 --> 03:01:14.479]  And every time I will go to the doctor's office and bring up this conversation about it,
[03:01:15.259 --> 03:01:18.183]  They would just toss me aside or rush me out right away.
[03:01:18.183 --> 03:01:24.211]  And that's when I started noticing that there's got to be something important about these transfer factors.
[03:01:24.211 --> 03:01:27.215]  And I've been taking them for three years.
[03:01:27.215 --> 03:01:30.560]  And also... Are you talking about key enzyme?
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:32.903]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff... Transfer factor?
[03:01:33.971 --> 03:01:37.055]  Transurfactors come from the colostrum of the milk of a cow.
[03:01:37.055 --> 03:01:37.235]  Yes.
[03:01:37.235 --> 03:01:39.658]  And from the egg yolk of a chicken.
[03:01:39.658 --> 03:01:43.002]  Now this stuff is well known and documented that they use it in Russia.
[03:01:43.002 --> 03:01:53.395]  The Russian Health Ministry actually mandated by law at every clinic anyone that steps foot in clinics out there needs to take these transurfactors.
[03:01:54.167 --> 03:01:58.151]  Because there's a lot of sicknesses and diseases inside clinics and hospitals.
[03:01:58.151 --> 03:01:58.451]  No, no.
[03:01:58.451 --> 03:01:59.192]  I was aware of that.
[03:01:59.192 --> 03:01:59.813]  I was aware of that.
[03:01:59.813 --> 03:02:00.353]  Great point.
[03:02:00.353 --> 03:02:01.054]  We'll look into that.
[03:02:01.054 --> 03:02:02.235]  Transfer factors.
[03:02:02.235 --> 03:02:03.436]  Thank you so much for that tip.
[03:02:03.436 --> 03:02:04.858]  Great info, Roger.
[03:02:04.858 --> 03:02:06.039]  John in California.
[03:02:06.039 --> 03:02:06.540]  You're on the air.
[03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:08.540]  Yeah.
[03:02:08.540 --> 03:02:08.800]  Oh yeah.
[03:02:27.754 --> 03:02:32.877]  The CDC sites, treatment modalities, protective clothing.
[03:02:32.877 --> 03:02:41.262]  My point is, they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't think there was a chance that the shit's gonna hit the proverbial fan.
[03:02:41.262 --> 03:02:43.903]  Other than that, your strike is a great idea.
[03:02:43.903 --> 03:02:46.685]  A lot of us medical types listen to you.
[03:02:47.626 --> 03:03:01.561]  Uh, for crying out loud, let's let all the medical people in your audience know that we need to honor this strike because we're going to be on the front line, uh, when this gets out of control and, uh, we need to stand firm.
[03:03:02.162 --> 03:03:05.864]  We need the nursing unions, the police unions, the EMT unions.
[03:03:05.864 --> 03:03:10.507]  I mean, you guys, the prison people, it's going to be living hell if we don't contain this.
[03:03:10.507 --> 03:03:13.868]  I mean, you guys are just, are really going to be the highest level of infected.
[03:03:13.868 --> 03:03:15.509]  Look how it's nurses right now.
[03:03:15.509 --> 03:03:17.390]  So I, I mean, that's why we're doing the strike.
[03:03:17.390 --> 03:03:19.131]  And I know we're organizing it quick.
[03:03:19.131 --> 03:03:20.072]  I should have done it earlier.
[03:03:20.072 --> 03:03:23.354]  I don't know why nobody else is doing it, but thank you for helping us.
[03:03:23.354 --> 03:03:25.655]  We're going to just try to get people organized as best we can.
[03:03:26.462 --> 03:03:30.825]  Let's get rid of this politically correct Obama policy.
[03:03:30.825 --> 03:03:31.725]  It's crazy.
[03:03:31.725 --> 03:03:33.006]  It's insane!
[03:03:33.006 --> 03:03:35.007]  And I'm a psychiatric nurse.
[03:03:35.007 --> 03:03:37.429]  It's insane!
[03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:38.449]  What do you think's going on?
[03:03:38.449 --> 03:03:40.390]  Because it really is insane.
[03:03:40.390 --> 03:03:45.253]  Why would they hire an Ebola czar who has no medical history?
[03:03:45.253 --> 03:03:46.014]  No medical training?
[03:03:47.045 --> 03:03:59.808]  Well, that's a good question, but I think it's probably because they have no medical training and they'll get spoon-fed whatever propaganda the administration wants to put out.
[03:03:59.808 --> 03:04:00.988]  No, I totally agree with you.
[03:04:00.988 --> 03:04:05.109]  You know, I want to keep taking phone calls here, but I've got to go shoot something for the news.
[03:04:05.109 --> 03:04:09.010]  I want to talk to John in Ohio, says they're Director of Infectious Disease, Airborne.
[03:04:09.010 --> 03:04:12.231]  We've got Ron, we've got Scott.
[03:04:12.231 --> 03:04:13.872]  We've got a lot of calls I want to go to.
[03:04:13.872 --> 03:04:14.832]  Does David Knight want to come?
[03:04:15.632 --> 03:04:23.974]  Sitting here for 30 minutes and maybe take some of these calls because I've got to go but I want to keep taking these calls.
[03:04:23.974 --> 03:04:26.394]  Listen, caller from Folsom Prison.
[03:04:26.394 --> 03:04:27.815]  Thank you for calling.
[03:04:27.815 --> 03:04:36.957]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on but that train keeps a coming and that's what tortures me.
[03:04:36.957 --> 03:04:38.457]  I think I just butchered Johnny Cash's song.
[03:04:39.176 --> 03:04:40.897]  Uh, we're gonna see if David Knight wants to come in.
[03:04:40.897 --> 03:04:42.498]  We can have a long intro.
[03:04:42.498 --> 03:04:43.899]  And get to a few more of your calls.
[03:04:43.899 --> 03:04:43.979]  800-259-9231.
[03:04:43.979 --> 03:04:49.483]  I'm gonna go work with Watson on this strike story.
[03:04:49.483 --> 03:04:52.104]  He got it out, did a great job, but I wanna beef it up.
[03:04:52.104 --> 03:04:54.046]  I got the nightly news I need to shoot.
[03:04:54.046 --> 03:04:56.947]  So, I'll see you back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:56.947 --> 03:04:57.588]  from Texas.
[03:04:57.588 --> 03:04:58.328]  David is coming up.
[03:04:58.328 --> 03:04:59.009]  Don't hang up, folks.
[03:05:00.740 --> 03:05:06.702]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.

[03:06:00.167 --> 03:06:01.488]  The experts are clear.
[03:06:01.488 --> 03:06:02.128]  Sunlight.
[03:06:02.128 --> 03:06:03.349]  Purified water.
[03:06:03.349 --> 03:06:05.049]  Healthy non-GMO food.
[03:06:05.049 --> 03:06:08.591]  And having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[03:06:08.591 --> 03:06:13.193]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:14.413 --> 03:06:18.598]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[03:06:18.598 --> 03:06:22.802]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[03:06:22.802 --> 03:06:28.127]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[03:06:28.127 --> 03:06:29.148]  Not our iodine.
[03:06:29.148 --> 03:06:32.712]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[03:06:32.932 --> 03:06:35.493]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[03:06:59.815 --> 03:07:00.256]  Gold.
[03:07:00.256 --> 03:07:02.137]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:07:02.137 --> 03:07:08.424]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:07:08.424 --> 03:07:12.608]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:07:12.608 --> 03:07:14.530]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:07:14.530 --> 03:07:16.972]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:07:16.972 --> 03:07:23.739]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker

[03:07:56.238 --> 03:08:07.265]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.894 --> 03:08:18.294]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:18.294 --> 03:08:25.857]  I'm David Knight, and Alex had to take care of some business and previous commitments, so I wanted to take your phone calls here.
[03:08:25.857 --> 03:08:30.818]  We just had someone that I would very much like to talk to that hung up, John in Ohio.
[03:08:30.818 --> 03:08:35.860]  John, if you want to call back, we're going to try to take calls through the end of this segment.
[03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:37.761]  So we've got about another 12 minutes or so.
[03:08:37.761 --> 03:08:39.641]  So we might be able to get to you if you want to call back.
[03:08:39.641 --> 03:08:42.022]  But let's go right now to Ron in Canada.
[03:08:42.022 --> 03:08:43.443]  Ron?
[03:08:43.443 --> 03:08:44.123]  Hi there.
[03:08:44.123 --> 03:08:44.683]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:08:45.359 --> 03:08:46.060]  Good buddy, good.
[03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:49.385]  Can I ask you a question about geopolitics?
[03:08:49.385 --> 03:08:50.947]  Sure.
[03:08:50.947 --> 03:08:57.777]  I just wanted you to explain it, because I heard that they're using it to create World War III.
[03:08:59.494 --> 03:09:02.155]  You want me to explain geopolitics?
[03:09:02.155 --> 03:09:02.435]  Right.
[03:09:02.435 --> 03:09:05.636]  Let's see, how much time we got here?
[03:09:05.636 --> 03:09:12.459]  Well, you know, what we see is a revival of the Cold War, and there's absolutely no reason for it.
[03:09:12.459 --> 03:09:13.879]  We were the aggressors in that area.
[03:09:13.879 --> 03:09:16.740]  I think that's probably what you're talking about when you talk about World War III.
[03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:18.401]  Of course, we've also seen the
[03:09:19.421 --> 03:09:19.701]  Yes.
[03:09:19.701 --> 03:09:21.902]  Is Obama using geopolitics, do you think?
[03:09:49.209 --> 03:09:51.851]  Well, yeah.
[03:09:51.851 --> 03:09:53.051]  That's absolutely the strategy.
[03:09:53.051 --> 03:10:06.319]  I mean, if you look at the techniques that have been going back to, and this is both parties, I mean, we've had Henry Kissinger that was essentially running Richard Nixon, and then we had the big new Brzezinski come in with Jimmy Carter.
[03:10:06.319 --> 03:10:10.202]  I mean, they're essentially, these guys have created organizations like the CFR.
[03:10:10.202 --> 03:10:11.282]  They work through Bilderberg.
[03:10:11.282 --> 03:10:13.404]  They work through all these different globalist organizations.
[03:10:13.404 --> 03:10:14.804]  And so, yeah, they use that.
[03:10:14.804 --> 03:10:17.246]  They can call it any number of different labels.
[03:10:18.055 --> 03:10:23.820]  Well, I just want to mention the International Monetary Fund also has certain policies in place as well, right?
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:24.981]  That's right, that's right.
[03:10:24.981 --> 03:10:28.003]  Well, listen, I want to move on because I want to get some of these comments on Ebola.
[03:10:28.003 --> 03:10:31.346]  That's really what we wanted to talk to about to people today that are hanging.
[03:10:31.346 --> 03:10:34.448]  We've got a lot of people who wanted to call in about Ebola.
[03:10:34.448 --> 03:10:35.589]  Thanks for calling, Ron.
[03:10:35.589 --> 03:10:37.330]  Let's go to Nick in Connecticut.
[03:10:37.330 --> 03:10:37.831]  Nick, go ahead.
[03:10:39.278 --> 03:10:41.139]  Hi, how are you doing Dave?
[03:10:41.139 --> 03:10:43.080]  Doing fine, thanks for calling.
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:47.643]  I didn't want to talk about Ebola, I just wanted to mention something real quick on silver.
[03:10:47.643 --> 03:10:52.006]  There's a guy, he ran a blog for 15 years named Harvey Organ.
[03:10:52.006 --> 03:10:56.908]  Google just removed his blog and said it was because of a court order.
[03:10:56.908 --> 03:10:58.529]  A court order?
[03:10:58.529 --> 03:11:06.214]  Now about a month ago he was on a Alt News website called USA Watchdog where he said, what Harvey Organ does is
[03:11:06.775 --> 03:11:17.079]  He specializes in looking at the physical amounts worldwide of like how much silver and gold, like the physical amount of it, you know, is and how it's traded.
[03:11:17.079 --> 03:11:25.982]  And he said the Shanghai Express in mid to late November this year, coming up, is going to run out of physical silver.
[03:11:25.982 --> 03:11:31.484]  So that's where China gets most of its silver right now physically, which is an industry and all that.
[03:11:32.317 --> 03:11:32.838]  I think so.
[03:11:41.650 --> 03:11:44.831]  And if you know anything about the Comex, you know they don't have anything.
[03:11:44.831 --> 03:11:45.551]  Well, I understand.
[03:11:45.551 --> 03:11:47.831]  I mean, I've been looking at this myself, too, for a long time.
[03:11:47.831 --> 03:11:53.692]  We look at things that are precious metals or things that actually in the Constitution were supposed to be our money, silver and gold.
[03:11:53.692 --> 03:11:54.873]  That was how the dollar was defined.
[03:11:54.873 --> 03:11:56.533]  It wasn't in a fiat currency.
[03:11:56.533 --> 03:12:00.634]  Nevertheless, they can use these fiat currencies to suppress markets.
[03:12:00.634 --> 03:12:04.774]  So even though the supply is shrinking, that doesn't mean that they can't rig the market.
[03:12:04.774 --> 03:12:07.415]  And they've done that in the past with both silver and with gold.
[03:12:07.995 --> 03:12:12.116]  It's difficult to predict that, based on just looking at quantities that are extant out there.
[03:12:12.116 --> 03:12:18.817]  But, of course, if people are concerned about it, what's going on with Ebola, people might start hoarding all types of things.
[03:12:18.817 --> 03:12:24.118]  They might even hoard them for health purposes, because silver has some connections with disinfectant.
[03:12:24.118 --> 03:12:28.319]  It's been a very reliable disinfectant for a very long time.
[03:12:28.319 --> 03:12:30.300]  Let's move on to Andrew in Illinois.
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:31.160]  Thank you, Nick.
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:32.000]  Andrew in Illinois.
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:32.300]  Go ahead.
[03:12:32.300 --> 03:12:36.521]  I was watching your show, and I noticed that Ebola
[03:12:37.216 --> 03:12:41.980]  The surfacing is lasting a long time.
[03:12:41.980 --> 03:12:50.406]  Dana Lish showed today, she revealed that a Minnesota epidemiologist came forward that it can survive for several days on a hard, dry surface.
[03:12:51.647 --> 03:12:53.489]  Yeah, I'm seeing different information about that.
[03:12:53.489 --> 03:13:03.798]  As a matter of fact, one of the stories that was linked on Drudge to the Weekly Standard, they were talking about a much, much longer period of time that it could survive on surfaces.
[03:13:03.798 --> 03:13:07.262]  They said the reason they're washing stuff down with chlorine, and I can't remember
[03:13:08.042 --> 03:13:11.224]  Uh, the amount of time they said, but it was quite a long time.
[03:13:11.224 --> 03:13:15.347]  I had seen in the past that it was only, they said, hours or days.
[03:13:15.347 --> 03:13:17.688]  That was the official word before from the CDC.
[03:13:17.688 --> 03:13:20.930]  They said it got shorter if it was exposed to sunlight.
[03:13:20.930 --> 03:13:25.693]  Now, with this article, and I haven't checked that source, uh, they were saying it was much longer than that.
[03:13:26.033 --> 03:13:41.169]  I thought it was also interesting in that article they mentioned that scientists that were working with this most recent outbreak had over this last six months identified 100 different strains or mutants, mutations within that Ebola virus.
[03:13:41.169 --> 03:13:43.351]  So I thought that was pretty amazing.
[03:13:43.351 --> 03:13:44.892]  I don't know if that's typical or not.
[03:13:44.892 --> 03:13:46.134]  Maybe if we've got somebody who's a
[03:13:46.834 --> 03:13:53.359]  A medical person, epidemiologist, they could speak to that, but I thought that was an amazing piece of information as well.
[03:13:53.359 --> 03:13:53.780]  Thank you.
[03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:55.881]  Let's go to Scott in Nebraska.
[03:13:55.881 --> 03:13:57.662]  Scott?
[03:13:57.662 --> 03:14:00.004]  Okay, I got three questions or statements here.
[03:14:00.004 --> 03:14:02.706]  What if Ebola gets into the water supply?
[03:14:02.706 --> 03:14:07.030]  If it has to go through the water systems to get purified out?
[03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:13.995]  And if this is just payback for the CIA that actually used Ebola to reduce the populations in Africa?
[03:14:14.844 --> 03:14:21.574]  Is this something Obama's letting in because it's kind of a, uh, re, uh, what do you call it?
[03:14:21.574 --> 03:14:22.556]  Payback?
[03:14:22.556 --> 03:14:27.263]  And the other one is, I got a friend of a friend ended up, uh, in a park.
[03:14:27.263 --> 03:14:30.448]  He was MKUltra said that they told him to go shoot up a school.
[03:14:31.537 --> 03:14:36.621]  Ended up in a park, woke up, and they had all the magazines loaded for his 9mm.
[03:14:36.621 --> 03:14:37.522]  Wow.
[03:14:37.522 --> 03:14:44.667]  Well, you know, in terms of putting it in the water supply, we know that they already do dump toxic substances into the water supply.
[03:14:44.667 --> 03:14:48.350]  Fluoride is a Class 4 toxic substance.
[03:14:48.350 --> 03:14:49.051]  You can see that.
[03:14:49.051 --> 03:14:55.075]  We've actually gone to the Austin City water supply here in Austin and taken pictures of it.
[03:14:55.075 --> 03:14:56.096]  You can see the corroded pipes.
[03:14:56.096 --> 03:14:58.118]  You can see the Class 4 right there.
[03:14:58.118 --> 03:14:58.999]  It's as high as it goes.
[03:14:59.679 --> 03:15:03.763]  We put that in there because, of course, that helps the companies that generate that toxic waste.
[03:15:03.763 --> 03:15:06.205]  They don't have to pay a lot of money to dispose of it.
[03:15:06.205 --> 03:15:07.687]  They can just dump it into our water.
[03:15:07.687 --> 03:15:08.608]  And you know what?
[03:15:08.608 --> 03:15:14.253]  Even if you think that fluoride is something that's good for you, if you think that it's medicine that everybody ought to take...
[03:15:15.194 --> 03:15:18.898]  When would you ever just dump medicine into the water supply?
[03:15:18.898 --> 03:15:20.359]  You can't control the dosage.
[03:15:20.359 --> 03:15:22.881]  So people are going to get under-medicated, they're going to get over-medicated.
[03:15:22.881 --> 03:15:26.785]  You don't have the same kind of dosage for a child that you have for an adult.
[03:15:26.785 --> 03:15:30.709]  So it makes absolutely no sense to add that to the water supply.
[03:15:30.709 --> 03:15:35.593]  In terms of what's going on in Africa, I think it's very interesting and noteworthy that
[03:15:36.374 --> 03:15:36.894]  The U.S.
[03:15:36.894 --> 03:15:41.896]  military didn't even have an AFRICOM, an Africa Specialty Command.
[03:15:41.896 --> 03:15:43.437]  They didn't even have that until 2007.
[03:15:43.437 --> 03:15:57.323]  I think it's also interesting to note that Bilderberg in 2013, amongst their biggest topics that they said they were going to be talking about, big data, that came out before the Snowden break, and then the other one was Africa.
[03:15:57.323 --> 03:16:01.964]  You know, they'd like to get those resources in Africa, but they don't want to look like they're neocolonialists.
[03:16:03.805 --> 03:16:06.507]  You know, that's another interesting data point right there.
[03:16:06.507 --> 03:16:08.488]  Let's go to Tom in Connecticut.
[03:16:08.488 --> 03:16:10.309]  Tom.
[03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:11.470]  Good day, David.
[03:16:11.470 --> 03:16:13.011]  Pleasure talking to you.
[03:16:13.011 --> 03:16:17.054]  I was going to talk about Ebola.
[03:16:17.054 --> 03:16:27.360]  I know that a government won't allow something to happen unless they feel at the highest levels that they can manage it, and it's my belief
[03:16:28.164 --> 03:16:34.526]  And I've talked to some people who I'm still associated with that are connected with the government.
[03:16:34.526 --> 03:16:46.030]  They've said that the Ebola coming here is essentially almost like a pesticide, and the pesticide's being applied to the pest, and those pests are us.
[03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:48.290]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:16:48.290 --> 03:16:56.753]  It's their belief that they have an immunity to it, either through vaccinations or whatever, and that they're not worried about Ebola coming here.
[03:16:57.648 --> 03:17:04.196]  They basically want to get rid of us, and this is one of the reasons why they may be just testing it with Ebola.
[03:17:04.196 --> 03:17:07.540]  Kind of a weak strain, but they're trying to test it with us.
[03:17:07.540 --> 03:17:15.830]  But that was one of the comments that I talked to some of my friends about, and they really feel that this is
[03:17:16.861 --> 03:17:17.601]  Absolutely.
[03:17:33.487 --> 03:17:36.812]  I'm going to have a report tonight on the nightly news about the Gaia Theory.
[03:17:36.812 --> 03:17:45.945]  And of course this is something that came from a British scientist, Lovelock, and in that they openly say that the human population is an infection on Mother Earth.
[03:17:45.945 --> 03:17:47.948]  They see Mother Earth as a living organism.
[03:17:47.948 --> 03:17:48.349]  It's kind of a
[03:17:48.809 --> 03:17:49.309]  Pagan view.
[03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:52.090]  They even name it after the theory after a pagan god.
[03:17:52.090 --> 03:17:56.851]  But there are a lot of people of all different stripes that want to see population reduction.
[03:17:56.851 --> 03:17:59.812]  There are some individuals who bought into this silly theory.
[03:17:59.812 --> 03:18:06.054]  There's also a lot of people in very high places who have made it very clear that that's exactly what they would want.
[03:18:06.054 --> 03:18:11.795]  They see the human population as a virus and they see Ebola in many cases as the cure.
[03:18:11.795 --> 03:18:13.316]  They even talk about the humans being a
[03:18:14.116 --> 03:18:31.782]  Cancer on the on the planet and they say you know what we do with cancer you know so there's a lot of mentality out there amongst the general population people who have been sold this idea by some of the elites and then there are a lot of people in very powerful positions who would like to see population reduction for a variety of reasons
[03:18:32.182 --> 03:18:34.623]  And so they've pursued a variety of strategies to do this.
[03:18:34.623 --> 03:18:38.044]  You've got Agenda 21 to control people.
[03:18:38.044 --> 03:18:45.326]  You've got birth control, where they want to basically take the population down gradually over a period of time by sterilizing people.
[03:18:45.326 --> 03:18:48.748]  And then there's other people who just want to go out and wipe out the population.
[03:18:48.748 --> 03:18:51.469]  So there's a lot of different people along that spectrum.
[03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:54.630]  I would not discount something like that from ever happening.
[03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:59.351]  We've had people, as we pointed out, the scientists here at the University of Texas bragged about that.
[03:18:59.351 --> 03:19:01.392]  Got a standing ovation from the other scientists there.
[03:19:02.032 --> 03:19:07.395]  There are a lot of people who have the capability to do that, that would like to do that same thing.
[03:19:07.395 --> 03:19:08.136]  Let's move along.
[03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:09.977]  I want to go to Dave in Massachusetts.
