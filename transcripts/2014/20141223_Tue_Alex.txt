[00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:15.811]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:17.492]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.333]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:20.794]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:22.495]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:26.737]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:31.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:37.624]  Well, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at 18,000 points.
[00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:42.307]  The GDP is the best in a decade, at least that's what the federal government is saying.
[00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:45.269]  But they're cooking the books on every front.
[00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:55.997]  The tens of trillions of dollars that have been digitally issued under QE Unlimited are the main drivers of the stock market's continued rise.
[00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.032]  And all economic indicators and facts and history show it cannot go on forever.
[00:01:04.713 --> 00:01:06.434]  Quite frankly, I don't like our fiat system.
[00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:06.994]  It's corrupt.
[00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:07.695]  It's out of control.
[00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:11.577]  But I don't want it to pop and implode.
[00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:17.001]  I would rather create parallel systems and then slowly move towards the reform.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.730]  While quietly and over time deflating the bubbles that are speculative and not free market.
[00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:35.683]  And the biggest reason isn't just the destabilization they cause historically, it's that it gives select interest control of markets.
[00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:55.442]  And then they can control culture and society unfairly and that unseen hand of fractional reserve banking and derivatives and other forms of counterfeiting that come out of it is used to create unaccountable power blocks that are truly usurpers.
[00:01:57.824 --> 00:02:00.305]  So what is the biggest threat going in 2015?
[00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:02.507]  Is it the economy imploding?
[00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:05.727]  Is it war with Russia?
[00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.649]  Is it the West funding ISIS and that getting out of control?
[00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.050]  Is it flesh-eating bacteria?
[00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.110]  Super Flues?
[00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:16.171]  Ebola?
[00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.012]  The breakdown of the borders and national sovereignty?
[00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:22.193]  The degeneration of the moral fabric?
[00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:25.374]  What is the main problem
[00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.490]  Facing humanity.
[00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.811]  I want to take a lot of phone calls in this first hour.
[00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:33.652]  But also, what is the big solution?
[00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:35.493]  Just simply put, what's the big threat?
[00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:37.214]  What are you most concerned about?
[00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:38.615]  What is the biggest issue?
[00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:40.516]  What's the biggest looming issue?
[00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:43.398]  And what can we do about it?
[00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.719]  Interspersed with all the news coming up.
[00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.080]  First-time callers in this first hour.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.962]  Then Steve Quayle joins us to talk about a host of issues.
[00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:53.603]  Civil war, police versus the people.
[00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.125]  Cyber attacks on banking.
[00:02:59.477 --> 00:03:02.260]  Sino-Soviet axis and more.
[00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:08.788]  Always interesting, always thought-provoking, always informative, always sensational.
[00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:16.396]  Steve Quayle will be joining us in the second hour of this live 23rd day Tuesday edition
[00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:19.353]  2014 only.
[00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:23.437]  What, seven days really total left in 2014.
[00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.039]  I'll be here live tomorrow.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.341]  I'll be here live on Friday.
[00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:33.086]  I'll be live, Lord willing, next Sunday because I missed some days last week.
[00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:34.708]  We are here.
[00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:36.069]  We are live.
[00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:40.033]  And I'm only going to take off one day for New Year's as well.
[00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:52.637]  I have not been taking off for vacation, but for family illnesses and other things, and for things that had to be set up with the company that are going to take us to the next level to be able to reach tens of millions more every single week.
[00:03:53.978 --> 00:04:06.065]  There's obviously so much to cover when we come back in the next segment, but I do want to take your phone calls today.
[00:04:08.454 --> 00:04:10.214]  On the subjects that I just raised.
[00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:15.256]  Please call in on those subjects because I want to have a thought-provoking discussion on these areas.
[00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:19.376]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:19.436]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:19.496 --> 00:04:22.897]  To join us on this live December 23rd worldwide broadcast.
[00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:22.957]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:39.400]  What is the big threat going into 2015?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.901]  What do you expect the globalists to pull?
[00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:45.163]  What is the most important issue out there?
[00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:46.123]  That's a lot of questions.
[00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:55.688]  I'd like to hear your answers, because some of the callers really bring up things that help my mind click and understand things better to the next level.
[00:04:55.708 --> 00:05:01.411]  And it also makes very informative, thought-provoking listening for the majority of people out there who aren't calling in.
[00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:05.893]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:06.373]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.043]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:20.026]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:29.209]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.412]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.711]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:46.832]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:48.613]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:56.517]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:56.797 --> 00:05:57.637]  But for how long?
[00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:04.200]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.382]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.475]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:20.497]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:26.921]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:29.723]  Using super oxygenation, OxyPowder,
[00:06:30.043 --> 00:06:35.308]  Available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[00:06:35.588 --> 00:06:40.612]  Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using OxyPowder with incredible success.
[00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:43.274]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:46.577]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:48.579]  And I've been able to keep it off too.
[00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.421]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:52.863]  And I'm like, I know, I guess it's this OxyPowder.
[00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:54.824]  2015 can be different.
[00:06:54.944 --> 00:06:57.807]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:06:58.127 --> 00:06:59.948]  Oxy Powder flushes it out.
[00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:03.050]  Secure your Oxy Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.313]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:34.342]  In the last limited shipment of 2014, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.

[00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:43.348]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:52.834]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality of Vitamin B12.

[00:08:14.886 --> 00:08:16.007]  We have the power!
[00:08:16.027 --> 00:08:19.448]  If you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:26.171]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:28.212]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:38.928]  It is Tuesday, December 23rd, 2014.
[00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.992]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:44.012 --> 00:08:46.173]  We'll be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:50.197]  Talk show host, author Steve Quayle is going to be
[00:08:51.687 --> 00:09:07.893]  Joining us coming up in the second hour to talk about civil war in America that the globalists are clearly pushing for, police versus the people, cyber attacks on banking, stockpiling of food and medicine, and the Sino-Soviet Axis.
[00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:13.655]  Coming up, Rand Paul plans bill to end police militarization.
[00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:20.718]  Charges expected to be filed against Mall of America protest organizers.
[00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.290]  CBS News.
[00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.533]  FBI says ISIS recruiting amid Ferguson protest.
[00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:29.354]  Well, we know that was going on.
[00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:30.254]  We documented it.
[00:09:30.755 --> 00:09:32.856]  But they go further in USA Today.
[00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:41.662]  They have a video report as well on USA Today to say the FBI claims that they're linked to Patriot groups.
[00:09:42.383 --> 00:09:43.944]  Now, I told you to look for that.
[00:09:48.939 --> 00:09:54.904]  The Pentagon training manuals, it's been in Forbes, it's been in the Washington Times, it's been in the news.
[00:09:57.606 --> 00:10:01.449]  That they believe the Tea Party will link up with Al-Qaeda, basically.
[00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:07.694]  Folks, that's like saying that Batman's gonna work with the Joker.
[00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.336]  Everyone knows
[00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:18.623]  That the Tea Party stands for gun rights, pro-life, pro-sovereignty, a lot of really good issues, basic Americana.
[00:10:19.283 --> 00:10:30.348]  But you can truly say one of the true faults, in my view, of the Tea Party, and something I've been criticized by some of the Tea Party for, is that I'm not an Islamophobe.
[00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:40.794]  I know that there's a lot of diverse groups, and that Pakistan is executing 50 radical Islamist terrorists this week.
[00:10:41.613 --> 00:10:42.494]  It's in the news this morning.
[00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.276]  In fact, they execute him today.
[00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:56.524]  Our government tried to finance radical Islamists to successfully, at first, overthrow Egypt, our closest ally after Israel, in the Middle East.
[00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:58.706]  Why would you do that?
[00:11:01.508 --> 00:11:07.573]  Our government has financed radical Islamists on record for four plus years to attack and almost take over Syria.
[00:11:10.982 --> 00:11:22.185]  Israel got one of its drones shot down yesterday over Syria, that was in the news, directing fire from the jihadis at the army of Syria.
[00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:33.389]  I'm not anti-Israel, but I am anti-Israel funding radical Wahhabi-ist jihadis to attack a country, Syria, that's done diddly-jack-squat to Israel.
[00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:48.865]  But Israel is going along with all this because it's part of a larger, globalist program to destabilize the Middle East and turn it over to radical, sex-mutilating, head-chopping, murdering scum.
[00:11:51.868 --> 00:11:55.110]  And they don't fully run them, they're just financing them.
[00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.134]  Like I said, it's like dumping a bag of black widows in your neighbor's bed.
[00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.920]  A few hours before they get home.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.442]  You don't command the Black Widows.
[00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:07.663]  You don't run the Black Widows.
[00:12:07.703 --> 00:12:09.484]  You didn't give birth to the Black Widows.
[00:12:11.025 --> 00:12:14.828]  But you sure collected them, stuck them in a bag, and dumped them in the bed.
[00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:23.013]  So you're absolutely a total capital murder accomplice if that spider bites them and they end up getting an infection and dying.
[00:12:24.932 --> 00:12:34.896]  And so, as asinine as it was, about four years ago, we began to see Army public articles by the Army War College and others.
[00:12:36.217 --> 00:12:43.380]  One scenario was preparing for war in North Carolina to take over several small towns and one medium-sized city.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.401]  It's a whole war game.
[00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:47.202]  And they said, we believe this scenario may happen.
[00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:53.325]  Well, Martians may land, too, and try to suck our brains out with melon ballers.
[00:12:54.278 --> 00:12:55.538]  Doesn't mean it's really going to happen.
[00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:03.502]  Maybe a race of aliens that look like 14-foot tall pink elephants are going to land and tell us that they love Johnny Cash.
[00:13:04.102 --> 00:13:09.444]  I mean, maybe one chance in 85 quadrillion?
[00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:14.626]  There's about as good a chance of the Tea Party
[00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:26.919]  Linking up with Al-Qaeda groups as there is a Santa Claus sleigh being pulled by 12 Easter bunnies with red noses.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.182]  It's fantasy on fantasy on fantasy.
[00:13:33.404 --> 00:13:37.687]  But there's that article and video up on Infowars.com.
[00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:43.472]  Totally sick.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:52.725]  FBI links Ferguson Anarchist to ISIS and Sovereign Citizens also linked to Islamic Terror Organization.
[00:13:54.786 --> 00:13:55.226]  That's what they do.
[00:13:55.266 --> 00:13:57.668]  They tie the Sovereign Citizen movement into the Tea Party.
[00:13:57.688 --> 00:14:06.854]  That's basically what they're doing, but you can just type into a search engine, um, Army Prepares to Fight Tea Party.
[00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:13.038]  And you'll get Forbes and The Washington Times, if you're a new listener and don't believe me,
[00:14:14.474 --> 00:14:22.380]  And in some of those training scenarios it says, we believe the Tea Party is going to link up with radical Islamists and take over U.S.
[00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:23.742]  towns and cities.
[00:14:24.222 --> 00:14:33.490]  That is the most ridiculous, over-the-top, obviously baloney-filled statement I think I've ever heard.
[00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:36.432]  There it is, FBI terror report.
[00:14:36.472 --> 00:14:40.155]  Malicious sovereign citizens, greater threat than Islamic terrorists.
[00:14:40.215 --> 00:14:41.256]  No, no, that's another one.
[00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:44.912]  That's an InfoWars story.
[00:14:45.773 --> 00:14:47.534]  It's a Washington Times and a Forbes.
[00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:52.057]  And the headline, searching the web, is... Let me give you an exact headline from memory here.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.781]  The Army Prepares to Fight the Tea Party.
[00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:01.023]  That's the headline.
[00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:07.887]  And then it's got a flag with a teapot on it with bullet holes in it.
[00:15:08.448 --> 00:15:10.129]  That was the graphic from the Washington Times.
[00:15:11.476 --> 00:15:13.998]  The one out of Forbes is just an Abrams tank.
[00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:22.263]  So that's what's going on for anybody that wants to look it up and to see that for themselves.
[00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:26.446]  That this is the big preparation that's happening.
[00:15:28.007 --> 00:15:29.148]  There's the Forbes article.
[00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:32.490]  How the US military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:41.079]  And if you go into the actual Army report that this links to, quote, dealing with nationalists and states that want to secede.
[00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:45.541]  Well, the Feds are fully captured and the states want to pull out to reconstitute the Republic.
[00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:46.961]  Oh, here comes the Army.
[00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.543]  And they set up Homeland Security to, quote, fight Al Qaeda.
[00:15:51.943 --> 00:15:54.303]  And now we're told, oh, no, it's for the veterans, it's for the gun owners.
[00:15:55.504 --> 00:16:02.106]  I want to open the phones up and ask listeners, what do you think the big issue is going to be
[00:16:04.522 --> 00:16:10.424]  Coming up in 2015, is it going to be energy prices and war with Russia?
[00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:24.748]  Is it going to be an economic collapse or hyperinflation because the Federal Reserve is still accelerating the printing presses digitally and giving it to insider banks?
[00:16:25.996 --> 00:16:32.997]  Is it going to be the North American Union and all these global treaties that are being signed by Obama that he plans to ratify by fiat?
[00:16:33.297 --> 00:16:37.698]  Will it be Obama in the next two years openly becoming a dictator?
[00:16:38.758 --> 00:16:40.839]  And by that I don't mean staying in office.
[00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:43.639]  I mean acting as an elected dictator.
[00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:46.500]  Hitler was elected and then became a dictator.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.581]  Does it matter if it's Ron Paul or does it matter if it's Jonathan Turley, a liberal?
[00:16:56.328 --> 00:17:02.291]  Constitutional lawyer, left-right center, libertarian, anybody who looks at what Obama's doing.
[00:17:03.192 --> 00:17:04.492]  Krauthammer breaks it down.
[00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:06.793]  He is becoming a dictator.
[00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:09.935]  And now he says, I'm gonna do whatever I want on any front.
[00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:11.596]  What is the big issue?
[00:17:15.518 --> 00:17:20.220]  Top constitutional experts are on record saying Obama is worse than Nixon.
[00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:25.263]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:28.355]  That's a quote from Jonathan Turley.
[00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:37.138]  Separately, report protesters are yelling at NYPD at Slain Officers Memorial.
[00:17:37.158 --> 00:17:53.185]  And it's not that the New York Police Department doesn't have some problems, but when you see the type of scum that are on Facebook and Twitter calling for killing more cops, I mean, these people... I've got one of the photos right here.
[00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:55.306]  Look at this guy, if you're a TV viewer.
[00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:05.247]  Chickapee Man Faces Charges For Putting Wings On Pigs Facebook Post.
[00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.371]  This is a new refrain being picked up.
[00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:16.133]  NYPD Cop Killer Used App To Track Police Movements Since Early December.
[00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:21.396]  De Blasio Is In Deep Trouble.
[00:18:23.257 --> 00:18:27.920]  He's like an anti-gun socialist, so I'm not going to weep for the public turning against him.
[00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:36.832]  Charges are expected to be filed against Mall of America protest organizers who took over the mall.
[00:18:37.973 --> 00:18:53.661]  My issue is, I'll fight to the death for you to be able to go out and protest and demonstrate on public property.
[00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:56.484]  Or on the side of the street.
[00:18:57.425 --> 00:19:00.828]  And if the police try to stop it, they're violating your rights and it's a terrible thing.
[00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:09.576]  But when you go take over a private mall, you could argue it's a commons because they advertise it's open to the public.
[00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:16.342]  And you go around and basically push Democratic Party propaganda.
[00:19:17.083 --> 00:19:21.006]  I think it's a gray area, but I really don't think they should charge the people
[00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:21.966]  That
[00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:48.951]  And to make the issue of police brutality and militarization about race, and not about what it is, globalization.
[00:19:49.952 --> 00:19:51.793]  I think they're misguided, but you know what?
[00:19:52.534 --> 00:19:56.457]  They've got their right to do it, and good for them getting out and demonstrating.
[00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:07.125]  It's the people that call for killing police that cross the line, because that is trying to organize violence.
[00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:07.766]  That's illegal.
[00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:12.871]  The CDC just announced flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus.
[00:20:13.091 --> 00:20:14.231]  You may not be protected.
[00:20:14.472 --> 00:20:18.854]  Whatever your lifestyle, your immune system is critical and Imudine provides your immune support.

[00:22:07.791 --> 00:22:09.631]  What disaster is so powerful?
[00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:16.315]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time.
[00:22:16.695 --> 00:22:18.796]  NASA has already set the countdown timer.
[00:22:19.096 --> 00:22:23.318]  And right now, the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:27.240]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.481]  population could perish.
[00:22:28.921 --> 00:22:31.922]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:22:32.402 --> 00:22:34.183]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:22:34.643 --> 00:22:35.884]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:22:36.284 --> 00:22:38.005]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:41.987]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?

[00:23:57.622 --> 00:23:59.503]  Alright, I'm gonna play the clip coming up.
[00:23:59.543 --> 00:23:59.843]  USA Today
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.664]  Linking the Ferguson protesters to ISIS, the FBI is, but also to Patriot groups.
[00:24:33.324 --> 00:24:34.145]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:38.968]  It's the left that thinks radical Islam is really cool and sexy.
[00:24:40.189 --> 00:24:42.490]  And everyone who's politically aware knows that.
[00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:48.955]  To try to connect it to conservatives or constitutionalists is asinine bull.
[00:24:51.431 --> 00:24:53.874]  Asinine boulder dash.
[00:24:54.495 --> 00:24:57.099]  And I for one am completely sick of it.
[00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:00.102]  Again, we're going to your phone calls in this short segment and the next.
[00:25:01.224 --> 00:25:04.188]  What do you think the next big issue is going to be?
[00:25:04.228 --> 00:25:05.530]  What are you most concerned about in 2015?
[00:25:09.901 --> 00:25:11.222]  I think it's false flags.
[00:25:12.243 --> 00:25:13.804]  Well, I'll tell you what I think in the next segment.
[00:25:13.824 --> 00:25:15.065]  Let's start hearing from you right now.
[00:25:15.486 --> 00:25:19.449]  Corey in Vermont, then Naheem, John, Jeff, Tommy, and others.
[00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:21.691]  Corey, thanks for calling from Vermont.
[00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:22.151]  Go ahead.
[00:25:23.292 --> 00:25:24.173]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:24.413]  Good.
[00:25:24.673 --> 00:25:37.684]  So, I guess my thoughts would be our real crisis is to how are we going to wake this political zombie party that they've created through, you know, all the media and all their false stuff that is
[00:25:38.317 --> 00:25:47.381]  Truly a sweep, because anybody with any knowledge or information from the public to government officials knows exactly what's going on.
[00:25:47.941 --> 00:25:52.883]  It's out there, they're starting to release information, and it's all out there to be, you know, to find.
[00:25:53.283 --> 00:26:03.668]  People are starting to write books on what you talked about ten years ago, because they know in ten years, they're going to win Pulitzer Prize, they're going to win Nobel, they're going to win prizes from this, because it's going to be like they were prophets.
[00:26:04.315 --> 00:26:08.217]  This information has been, in the last year, you can see that it's being dumped, right?
[00:26:08.357 --> 00:26:09.938]  Everything's being dumped into the media.
[00:26:10.598 --> 00:26:14.900]  They're just dumping it all out in order to, you know, further their agenda.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.003]  But how are we going to wake all these people that just can't, are so... You know, I was in the grid.
[00:26:21.043 --> 00:26:30.688]  I've been in the government's grid since I was 10 years old, up until about 30, all the way from foster homes to the federal penitentiary.
[00:26:30.728 --> 00:26:33.950]  I've been deep into the grid, so I know how it works.
[00:26:34.699 --> 00:26:38.901]  But these people are so uninformed and live in such a different reality.
[00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:40.462]  Well, I was about to say it's a paradox.
[00:26:40.842 --> 00:26:45.865]  There's never been more information available to prove global government conspiracy.
[00:26:46.785 --> 00:26:48.626]  And there's never been more people awake.
[00:26:48.826 --> 00:26:50.907]  But still, that's a large minority.
[00:26:51.328 --> 00:26:55.070]  There's a giant mass that can't find their butt with both hands.
[00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.051]  That's the time bomb.
[00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:58.371]  Imagine a depression.
[00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:00.772]  Or imagine a civil strife.
[00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:03.394]  How the average entitled
[00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:06.104]  Yuppie is going to behave.
[00:27:06.704 --> 00:27:14.152]  Because for all the police problems, at least they're in the real world interfacing with the best and worst of society.
[00:27:14.192 --> 00:27:17.056]  That's why I found they're easier to wake up than the public.
[00:27:17.176 --> 00:27:18.737]  That's why there's a paradox with the police.
[00:27:19.178 --> 00:27:20.339]  Military even easier.
[00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:23.502]  Because they've actually been there and seen the real world.
[00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:26.446]  What is going to happen with the soft public
[00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:35.154]  As this stuff begins to unravel, and there's no doubt the economy has unraveled at many levels, but they claim the stock market's at 18,000.
[00:27:35.334 --> 00:27:44.726]  Well, that's because of derivatives, and that's because of more dollars being printed, but that's the only part of the economy that's really booming.
[00:27:45.774 --> 00:28:02.760]  Everything else, on a region-by-region basis, it varies, but overall, the middle class is getting smaller, debt is getting bigger, the real economy is being removed, while a synthetic fractional reserve banking counterfeit system is being replaced.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.160]  Good to hear from you, Corey.
[00:28:04.781 --> 00:28:11.083]  Yeah, I think what happens is more information comes out, and how the establishment responds is a big issue.
[00:28:12.978 --> 00:28:23.383]  But I really see false flags, staged terror, to be blamed on liberty groups to stop us trying to take the country back peacefully, to demonize us.
[00:28:23.443 --> 00:28:24.583]  I really see that in the cards.
[00:28:25.324 --> 00:28:26.964]  But I don't know what shoe is going to drop.
[00:28:27.004 --> 00:28:28.145]  Is it going to be war with Russia?
[00:28:28.585 --> 00:28:29.285]  Regional war?
[00:28:30.046 --> 00:28:31.486]  ISIS spreading into more countries?
[00:28:32.387 --> 00:28:37.269]  Is it going to be the border completely collapsing and instead of 5 million illegals pouring across, 20 million?
[00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:39.290]  They say that'd be bigger than a
[00:28:41.138 --> 00:28:42.859]  Major terrorist attack on the economy.
[00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:44.760]  The head of Southcom's on record saying that.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:54.543]  Is it going to be something unforeseen like a banking hack attack that they say is going on right now that dwarfs whoever hacked Sony?
[00:28:55.804 --> 00:29:05.448]  There's a compression in time-space right now towards the singularity that as technology increases, as knowledge increases,
[00:29:06.997 --> 00:29:10.699]  Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink, the rhyme of the ancient mariner.
[00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:32.171]  Information and incredible discoveries and wonders are everywhere, but most people don't slow down enough from their smartphones and sports center or doing the laundry or going to the movies or going to work or changing diapers to pull back and really look at the big picture.

[00:29:47.722 --> 00:29:53.384]  And surprisingly now, Sony will release the interview.
[00:29:53.824 --> 00:29:55.524]  Looks more and more like a stunt, doesn't it?
[00:29:56.325 --> 00:29:57.425]  First they weren't, now they are.
[00:29:58.499 --> 00:30:01.486]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.428 --> 00:30:05.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:43.355]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.

[00:32:21.781 --> 00:32:29.387]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:31.869]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:38.474]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:38.634 --> 00:32:42.257]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force.
[00:32:42.637 --> 00:32:48.742]  Super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[00:32:49.023 --> 00:32:59.492]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[00:32:59.832 --> 00:33:07.459]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:33:19.645 --> 00:33:22.946]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:25.587]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.688 --> 00:33:31.849]  North Korea cannot even basically tie their shoelaces.
[00:33:32.589 --> 00:33:36.670]  It is a giant mind control collapse total government state.
[00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:41.632]  If you like hell on earth, well, move to North Korea or call for big government.
[00:33:42.392 --> 00:33:44.253]  And it will eat you out of house and home.
[00:33:45.785 --> 00:33:52.249]  The Wrap is now reporting Sony shut to announce the interview, theatrical and video on demand release.
[00:33:53.229 --> 00:33:58.933]  After national clamor to release the film despite threats, Sony finds a way to get the comedy out there.
[00:33:59.873 --> 00:34:04.516]  So they're announcing that they will come out and will release it.
[00:34:05.316 --> 00:34:10.379]  The plan is to release the film simultaneously in participating theaters and via video on demand.
[00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:15.002]  The Plaza Theater in Atlanta, the theater in Austin have now said they will distribute the film.
[00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:26.032]  You watch, that's going to be the Alamo Draft House, because their owner, who I know, has come out and said that it was the distributor of Team America that wouldn't let them re-air it, and that they're protesting that.
[00:34:26.052 --> 00:34:34.141]  I've got to get on the phone and get a hold of Tim League, because he's been on the show before, and I was in that... well, I consulted on that movie he produced, so he should come on.
[00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:51.891]  This is an issue of the First Amendment on one level, but on another level it's about them trying to pass cyber security laws to build up the cyber warfare capacity of domestic agencies that are really just using it to control the American people.
[00:34:52.592 --> 00:34:53.373]  That's on record.
[00:34:54.954 --> 00:35:00.079]  But also the fact that they're now announcing that they will have a release of it, the whole thing just reeks of hype.
[00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:03.642]  I mean, it looks like a badly made comedy.
[00:35:05.267 --> 00:35:08.729]  From folks I know that have seen it, I've talked to them, they say it's pretty bad.
[00:35:12.551 --> 00:35:17.574]  And it just shows how the establishment can still push a hoax.
[00:35:18.394 --> 00:35:26.799]  Sure, most people don't watch mainstream media, but when the mainstream media works together, they can push a major hoax out into the public.
[00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:28.440]  And that's my view of it.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.521]  I do not believe North Korea is behind it.
[00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:33.563]  North Korea's internet's down right now.
[00:35:35.336 --> 00:35:36.837]  North Korea can barely keep the lights on.
[00:35:36.857 --> 00:35:42.680]  Have you watched the state-run media parades and things with 60-year-old cars?
[00:35:43.181 --> 00:35:43.921]  They're a joke.
[00:35:44.822 --> 00:35:50.485]  Their leader is a toddling, spoiled brat who couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
[00:35:51.906 --> 00:35:54.387]  And this is why we've got to give up all of our liberties.
[00:35:56.408 --> 00:35:57.969]  It's because of North Korea.
[00:35:58.149 --> 00:36:00.310]  Give me a break.
[00:36:02.632 --> 00:36:04.153]  Alright, here's the larger question.
[00:36:05.603 --> 00:36:11.669]  What do you think the big crisis will be of 2015?
[00:36:11.729 --> 00:36:14.732]  What do you think the globalist's next move is going to be?
[00:36:15.713 --> 00:36:17.975]  We've got some Twitter comments that came in.
[00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:19.577]  Garber Inc.
[00:36:19.737 --> 00:36:25.383]  said, more disease, cyber attacks, inflation, economic disruption, large-scale false flag.
[00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:34.414]  Revolution 2015 says, I think the globalist plan is in full swing and it will keep escalating in 2015 because our resistance is growing.
[00:36:34.855 --> 00:36:35.375]  I agree with that.
[00:36:35.935 --> 00:36:43.941]  Eustace J. Smith says, major false flag attack on America in an attempt to demonize gun owners, grassroots and liberty movement.
[00:36:44.261 --> 00:36:49.105]  Let me put a star by that one because that's exactly what I think and I'm most concerned about.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:59.665]  Viruses, more street riots, stage major attacks, financial, all the above, they need a war for sure.
[00:37:00.265 --> 00:37:02.826]  Nuke and blame it on North Korea.
[00:37:04.307 --> 00:37:07.729]  And that's by Rodney Serato M on Twitter.
[00:37:08.209 --> 00:37:14.393]  You can send more of your comments there to the Twitter site RealAlexJones.
[00:37:16.072 --> 00:37:19.053]  Speaking of phone calls, let's go through your calls.
[00:37:19.093 --> 00:37:20.913]  We're going to go to Nahim and others.
[00:37:21.253 --> 00:37:23.594]  Nahim in New York, you're on the air.
[00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:24.074]  Go ahead.
[00:37:25.494 --> 00:37:26.355]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:26.635]  Good.
[00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:28.715]  Alright, good.
[00:37:28.735 --> 00:37:31.676]  First off, I'm a first-time caller and I've been listening to the show for a while.
[00:37:31.696 --> 00:37:32.656]  I think it's great.
[00:37:32.676 --> 00:37:34.977]  Speaking the truth, man, keep at it.
[00:37:35.417 --> 00:37:41.018]  But what I wanted to get at, I think the biggest issue for 2014 is the appropriation of land.
[00:37:41.038 --> 00:37:44.399]  Since this country's founding, it's been known that
[00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:50.128]  Resources and the land have been the two main things that everybody's fighting for.
[00:37:50.488 --> 00:38:05.938]  And since we're at a watershed in humanity, and America is ironically the third largest populated country in the world behind India and China, I think that all these things that are happening in the media right now is basically distracted from the bigger picture.
[00:38:06.318 --> 00:38:08.539]  What is going on with the land and who wants it?
[00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:13.142]  I think a major shift in population in the U.S.
[00:38:20.324 --> 00:38:21.325]  It's funny you say that.
[00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:25.511]  Russia is vying to take over much of the Arctic that they border.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.184]  The United States and the EU are also fighting with Russia over that.
[00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:37.031]  There are major land grabs going on with AFRICOM or AFRICON in Africa.
[00:38:37.051 --> 00:38:39.734]  The Chinese are moving in Africa as well.
[00:38:41.156 --> 00:38:43.518]  There's big battles over the undersea floor.
[00:38:44.747 --> 00:38:45.747]  Hey, how's it going, buddy?
[00:38:45.787 --> 00:38:47.488]  I'm a first-time caller as well.
[00:39:14.615 --> 00:39:19.769]  Um, I just wanted to, you know, say something on the topic of the officers that got
[00:39:20.293 --> 00:39:23.415]  That got shot for practically no reason.
[00:39:23.455 --> 00:39:24.996]  Well, they got shot for no reason.
[00:39:25.016 --> 00:39:29.179]  I mean, it was cops in a whole other jurisdiction that choked the poor black man to death.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:39.086]  So, I mean, again, if two black guys burn up a 19-year-old white girl in Mississippi, do blacks in another side of town deserve to be killed?
[00:39:39.786 --> 00:39:40.527]  Absolutely not.
[00:39:40.987 --> 00:39:42.408]  It's that same type of mindset.
[00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:44.550]  It's very dangerous.
[00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:44.890]  Go ahead.
[00:39:45.723 --> 00:39:45.983]  It is.
[00:39:46.723 --> 00:39:51.844]  And the Spokane protest, you know, that was just a pure exertion of constitutional rights.
[00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:54.205]  And there was progress that came from that.
[00:39:54.605 --> 00:39:57.726]  You know, there was, it wasn't all the craziness.
[00:39:57.766 --> 00:39:59.346]  You know, we got our point across.
[00:39:59.406 --> 00:40:00.146]  We were heard.
[00:40:00.706 --> 00:40:02.066]  Stuff was brought to the lot.
[00:40:02.587 --> 00:40:04.447]  And then we take one step forward.
[00:40:04.507 --> 00:40:05.527]  These cops get shot.
[00:40:05.547 --> 00:40:06.907]  We take three steps back.
[00:40:07.588 --> 00:40:14.169]  It's like walking out into your yard and you see a snake on the ground where you reach down and grab him on the tail and his head bites you.
[00:40:14.608 --> 00:40:15.969]  And that's exactly what this is.
[00:40:16.009 --> 00:40:18.129]  The cops are just the tail of the snake.
[00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.450]  They follow the head, and the head's the government.
[00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.891]  That's where it's all coming from.
[00:40:22.551 --> 00:40:27.093]  But people are so focused on the tail of this snake, and that's exactly what the government wants.
[00:40:27.913 --> 00:40:41.859]  It's just one more strike against their sex amendment rights, one more reason for them to throw up in their defense while we shouldn't have our guns, because some idiot that has no clue what his purpose even is, shoots two innocent men,
[00:40:42.386 --> 00:40:45.269]  They probably have children now that's going to grow up without a father.
[00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.372]  It's pretty shameful.
[00:40:50.674 --> 00:40:52.816]  Well, sir, I couldn't say it any better than that.
[00:40:53.016 --> 00:41:07.530]  It is a total dichotomy, a side-by-side example of Spokane, Washington, upwards of 500 patriots come out,
[00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:17.113]  And protest the Sheriff's Department going under federal control and demonizing constitutionalists and admitting that they're preparing for war.
[00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:46.788]  Well, folks went out and protested it, they covered it, it was in all the state's major newspapers, it was all over TV in the state, it became a national news story, the sheriff backed off, the deputies backed off, the sheriff's union came out against the sheriff, the sheriff's deputy's union, and now state reps are looking to pass laws to basically control the training curriculum that the police in that state are given.
[00:41:48.007 --> 00:41:50.928]  That's how you actually change things.
[00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:55.110]  Not going out and shooting two cops in the head.
[00:41:57.411 --> 00:42:03.934]  And this is what's being promoted because the system does not want a real dialogue.
[00:42:04.095 --> 00:42:07.416]  They want destabilization in this country.
[00:42:08.637 --> 00:42:09.957]  I appreciate your call, Tommy.
[00:42:10.017 --> 00:42:17.501]  Now the main subject today, at least for right now, is what do you think the big globalist next move is going to be?
[00:42:19.127 --> 00:42:23.809]  And I think the callers and the folks tweeting back at us are getting it right from my view.
[00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:39.134]  False flag, more wars, global destabilization, more financial milking, more signing us on to banker derivative bailouts, more dollar devaluation, but the big one is false flag.
[00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:45.496]  That will affect Americans and our basic freedoms.
[00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:48.931]  More than anything else.
[00:42:53.173 --> 00:43:05.801]  If there's a major false flag in this country, will it be blamed on Islamic State that has openly been funded and shepherded and protected by the criminals that run our federal government and other foreign governments?
[00:43:07.042 --> 00:43:13.826]  Or will they go ahead and stage something and blame it purely on domestic groups?
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:21.564]  Or they may stage a big event and claim that the Tea Party is working with Islamic State.
[00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:24.625]  We've told you that was coming.
[00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:26.406]  You now see them hyping it.
[00:43:26.627 --> 00:43:27.087]  Look out.
[00:43:28.468 --> 00:43:31.209]  And it doesn't matter if the narrative doesn't make sense.
[00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.350]  They don't care.
[00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:39.234]  They want to segue from the police state being for Al-Qaeda to being for the American people.
[00:43:39.274 --> 00:43:44.737]  We're now to that point I've warned you about for so long and you see it emerging.
[00:43:46.510 --> 00:44:00.800]  But the real reason that we as a liberty movement have so much credibility, not just Alex Jones or InfoWars.com, but you out there who've been warning people, is because it is unfortunately coming true.
[00:44:02.421 --> 00:44:04.183]  Things they denied are now admitted.
[00:44:05.023 --> 00:44:05.464]  So as
[00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:12.333]  As scary as things are, there's a lot of positive indicators and information out there.
[00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:23.522]  And it's important to pray to God, to lead God and direct us, and to have providence, to be able to expose the enemy's operations, to be able to stop these operations.
[00:44:24.263 --> 00:44:34.151]  Or if they do carry out these operations, let it be turned to good, as we pray for the dead, and may their false flag
[00:44:35.649 --> 00:44:41.452]  Disintegrate in their face and may it be revealed and blow up in their face, pun intended.
[00:44:43.413 --> 00:45:01.622]  That's one reason they've been only trying to provocateur people or let foreign terror groups attack us instead of just doing it themselves, is because the London bombing, the Boston bombing, Sandy Hook, the underwear bombing, and so many others, Al-Qaeda,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.584]  Not once, but three times, launching nerve gas attacks on Syria, to blame it on Syria.
[00:45:08.725 --> 00:45:09.466]  They got caught.
[00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:15.011]  Even our own military came out later and said, no, it's clearly Islamic radicals that are doing it.
[00:45:15.371 --> 00:45:16.612]  It's not the Syrian government.
[00:45:16.793 --> 00:45:28.463]  I mean, how obvious is it, three years ago, Obama says, my red line is, if you launch chemical weapons, knowing Syria's never done that, on the one year anniversary,
[00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:34.045]  Groups out of Saudi Arabia, it later came out, they even shot videos bragging.
[00:45:34.385 --> 00:45:35.706]  That's how uncontrolled they are.
[00:45:37.347 --> 00:45:47.195]  Yelling Allah Akbar and firing the nerve gas mortars with their Islamic radical Wahhabist Al Qaeda flags.
[00:45:50.978 --> 00:45:53.961]  So, false flags don't work too good.
[00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:58.885]  It even came out in the BBC that the
[00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:17.753]  Main military minister for Turkey got caught in a phone call and it got released and Turkey didn't deny it, talking to three top generals about, I need a false flag, we need to stay, he even used that term in Turkish, Arabic.
[00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:22.555]  We need a false flag right now.
[00:46:23.175 --> 00:46:27.856]  And he starts giving examples of the generals and they're saying, not on the telephone, we know what to do.
[00:46:30.694 --> 00:46:36.018]  The generals in the transcripts, BBC wrote about it, we wrote about it as well, they're like, stop it!
[00:46:36.298 --> 00:46:36.679]  Stop it!
[00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:38.460]  Not on the telephone!
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.141]  Don't tell us, we know what to do!
[00:46:43.644 --> 00:46:45.506]  Don't tell us, we know what to do!
[00:46:45.946 --> 00:46:46.907]  And you do know what to do!
[00:46:48.948 --> 00:46:59.376]  You'd fire a mortar at your own Turkish installation, it'd bounce off the top of the concrete armor, then you'd do a five-day barrage with giant
[00:47:00.487 --> 00:47:08.409]  artillery guns into Syria to open up a wedge to send in over 10,000 jihadis and just one offensive.
[00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:10.850]  Being trained in Turkey.
[00:47:20.332 --> 00:47:21.553]  Let's go to John in Minnesota.
[00:47:21.573 --> 00:47:22.113]  You're on the air.
[00:47:22.153 --> 00:47:22.453]  Welcome.
[00:47:24.045 --> 00:47:24.605]  Hey, Alex.
[00:47:24.866 --> 00:47:29.228]  I just want to tell you that I've been on Earth about seven days longer than you.
[00:47:29.248 --> 00:47:31.169]  I was born on January 30th, 1974.
[00:47:31.629 --> 00:47:36.892]  So I'm proud to say that I've been here just a little bit longer than you.
[00:47:37.092 --> 00:47:38.033]  You are my elder.
[00:47:38.173 --> 00:47:39.254]  I defer to you.
[00:47:40.895 --> 00:47:47.498]  And, you know, funny, but I was thinking about I was thinking about that movie, The Interview, while you were talking.
[00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:53.682]  Can you imagine how big the world has changed in mine and your lifetime?
[00:47:54.781 --> 00:47:58.602]  When it comes to, remember the opening scene of the movie Naked Gun?
[00:48:00.442 --> 00:48:00.702]  Yes.
[00:48:01.742 --> 00:48:18.506]  Do you remember how Leslie Nielsen was punching and beating up the, like, the Irani Shah or whatever, or whatever he was, and then, uh, Mohammed Gaddafi, and... I mean, 30 years later, now you put out a spoof about some world leader, and it comes to where, like,
[00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:22.474]  You lose all your privacy and you can get hacked and blah blah blah.
[00:48:22.514 --> 00:48:23.115]  It's a joke.
[00:48:23.255 --> 00:48:24.275]  Well you know what's being done.
[00:48:24.295 --> 00:48:36.124]  I mean listen, we had real terrorism, some real terrorism, in the 1960s and 70s by the Weathermen and other folks that taught Obama everything he knows.
[00:48:37.905 --> 00:48:39.866]  And they would ignore it in the press.
[00:48:40.547 --> 00:48:45.570]  Because if you give terrorists attention and you give it to their demands, they do what?
[00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:46.411]  They do it more.
[00:48:47.196 --> 00:48:56.458]  Nowadays, though, oh, a car backfired, let's shut down half the city with SWAT teams, or, oh my gosh, North Korea may get us, we better not air this movie.
[00:48:56.738 --> 00:49:01.059]  They're training us that they have to censor things to keep us safe.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:11.742]  And it's just, we being 40 years old, we actually got to see real America, whereas I think people born somewhere after 1988,
[00:49:13.874 --> 00:49:15.996]  They have not seen what real America is.
[00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:20.300]  You and I at least got to see a little bit of it and experience it, and that was great.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.304]  But, you know, I want to tell you how I stumbled upon you, if that's okay.
[00:49:24.684 --> 00:49:25.325]  Sure, go ahead, brother.
[00:49:26.546 --> 00:49:32.311]  Yeah, um, now I know you've been queasy in the past about the Bill Cooper stuff.
[00:49:32.431 --> 00:49:34.753]  People have called in and been mean to you and stuff like that.
[00:49:34.773 --> 00:49:36.895]  And Bill Cooper himself, before he died, was
[00:49:38.514 --> 00:50:06.826]  Taunting you and stuff like that, but I I came on to you because I'm I believe 9-11 was a complete CIA inside job complicit with Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and Colin Powell and Democrats and FBI you name it and those buildings could not have come down from the planes there a plane did not hit the Pentagon so when I'm list I looked for information from Bill Cooper on the day of 9-11 he went on for like 10 hours and
[00:50:08.095 --> 00:50:10.677]  And, man, was he on target, man!
[00:50:10.717 --> 00:50:16.481]  He predicted everything that's happening in 2014, and he was dead right about 9-11.
[00:50:16.521 --> 00:50:19.383]  Sure, I mean, I want to be clear about, I don't in-fight.
[00:50:20.064 --> 00:50:24.367]  I don't sit here, even when people attack me, and then attack folks back, okay?
[00:50:25.228 --> 00:50:34.875]  And that's why I've been successful, because most of the alternative media would just spend all their time fighting with each other, instead of giving analysis and news.
[00:50:36.636 --> 00:50:39.777]  I probably only heard Bill Cooper three or four times before he died.
[00:50:39.797 --> 00:50:45.380]  I didn't like his book, Behold a Pale Horse, just because I'm not into space alien stuff.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:53.163]  Other than that, he was a very interesting broadcaster, very smart guy, and I've since gone back and listened to some of his stuff and found it to be very informative.
[00:50:54.276 --> 00:50:55.917]  Um, so that's where I stand on it.
[00:50:56.057 --> 00:51:04.021]  I just don't have a dog in the fight, and I don't like having some dead guy resurrected for us to do UFC battle in a ring.
[00:51:04.621 --> 00:51:06.222]  You know, I hope he rests in peace.
[00:51:06.702 --> 00:51:07.442]  So God bless you.
[00:51:07.703 --> 00:51:08.323]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:09.229 --> 00:51:12.711]  Hey everyone, I'm having lots of fun with my new Ghost 80% AR-15.
[00:51:12.991 --> 00:51:15.232]  This baby shoots like a dream.
[00:51:15.352 --> 00:51:16.373]  Hey, thanks Guns80.com.
[00:51:16.433 --> 00:51:20.235]  You know, friends ask me all the time why I wanted a Ghost AR-15.
[00:51:20.455 --> 00:51:21.596]  That's easy.
[00:51:21.616 --> 00:51:28.660]  You see, my buddy Mark kept telling me that I'd better go to Guns80.com and get myself a Ghost AR-15 before they outlawed them.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.941]  I thought he was just paranoid, so I ignored it.
[00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:31.622]  Well, at first.
[00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:40.266]  But then I started hearing government media types talking about making guns illegal, about the president signing on to a UN treaty that could take my gun rights away.
[00:51:40.286 --> 00:51:41.747]  You know, it really bugged me.
[00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:45.749]  So I dug in, I did the research, and I realized that Mark was right all along.
[00:51:46.569 --> 00:51:50.551]  I know now that having an unregistered Ghost AR-15 is the right answer.
[00:51:51.071 --> 00:51:53.732]  I'm a proud 80% Ghost AR-15 convert.

[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.761]  I would also recommend that
[00:57:19.921 --> 00:57:26.924]  When you're with friends and family, not just this holiday, but anytime, download the InfoWars Droid and iPhone apps to their phones.
[00:57:27.324 --> 00:57:28.145]  Get them to put it on.
[00:57:28.345 --> 00:57:29.445]  Hey, put this app on.
[00:57:29.465 --> 00:57:30.506]  Hey, listen to this.

[00:57:46.893 --> 00:57:48.153]  And then Steve Quayle's coming up.
[00:57:48.253 --> 00:57:49.034]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:57:50.441 --> 00:57:52.023]  Hey Alex, Merry Christmas, brother.
[00:57:52.203 --> 00:57:52.923]  You too, my friend.
[00:57:53.984 --> 00:58:03.153]  Hey, uh, yeah, the things that I see, uh, the biggest problems America has is we're looking at, uh, things in a spiritually blind eye.
[00:58:03.493 --> 00:58:03.854]  I agree.
[00:58:03.874 --> 00:58:09.639]  People, uh, they, you know, the reason our government is like it is, is because we elected it.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.503]  It's a mirror of the modern American family household.
[00:58:14.063 --> 00:58:15.765]  Not all of them, but a majority.
[00:58:16.907 --> 00:58:23.571]  Uh, in my local, uh, county, I ran for county commissioner, and I did not get elected, but I got a lot of good talking points out there.
[00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:27.514]  And it's just amazing at how many people talk a good game.
[00:58:28.214 --> 00:58:31.156]  But when it's time to vote, they vote for their bill phone.
[00:58:31.796 --> 00:58:32.857]  They vote for their wallet.
[00:58:32.877 --> 00:58:35.959]  They don't vote from their heart like they will talk like on their front porch.
[00:58:36.699 --> 00:58:37.960]  But when it comes time to vote,
[00:58:38.522 --> 00:58:41.563]  Hey, you know, I want to vote for the guy that's gonna keep my welfare.
[00:58:41.583 --> 00:58:43.404]  I want to vote for the guy that's gonna keep... Stay there.
[00:58:43.424 --> 00:58:44.465]  I want you to finish up.
[00:58:44.505 --> 00:58:45.245]  Don't hang up, Jeff.
[00:58:45.285 --> 00:58:46.285]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:46.566 --> 00:58:46.986]  Stay with us.

[01:00:15.188 --> 01:00:19.350]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.011 --> 01:00:20.811]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:22.532]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.132 --> 01:00:26.774]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.335 --> 01:00:31.437]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:38.001]  Headline, Infowars.com, Marketing Scam.
[01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:40.322]  Sony to go ahead and roll out.
[01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:42.331]  The interview.
[01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:44.092]  Boy, you knew that was coming.
[01:00:44.152 --> 01:00:45.072]  That's how you really know.
[01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:48.155]  Simply amazing.
[01:00:48.255 --> 01:00:51.117]  Steve Quayle's coming up to cover a host of key issues.
[01:00:51.737 --> 01:00:58.062]  If you just tuned in or stations just joined us, we're asking callers, what is the big issue in 2015?
[01:00:58.382 --> 01:01:01.524]  What's the big threat to liberty so we can identify it and deal with it?
[01:01:02.505 --> 01:01:04.506]  What do you expect the globalists to pull next?
[01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:09.490]  And Jeff in Tennessee was saying, look, government is a reflection of the people.
[01:01:12.248 --> 01:01:29.374]  And even if folks talk a good game, the social engineers have set it up with their control of fractional reserve banking to where they've woven, like a cancer, into all the tissues of the body politic, their systems where it's very hard to not play ball with it.
[01:01:30.595 --> 01:01:34.196]  But if you even see now in the medium term, it's all coming to an end.
[01:01:34.276 --> 01:01:38.818]  It's designed to get you in, to give you the rings of power, like ringwraiths,
[01:01:40.066 --> 01:01:43.449]  And then you don't know that there's really a secret ring that controls them all.
[01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:49.693]  That's what the Internet and global governance and all this is, is a trap in the system's own words.
[01:01:49.733 --> 01:01:51.034]  And it's diabolical.
[01:01:52.435 --> 01:01:55.157]  It's really beyond human intelligence, the coordination of it.
[01:01:56.298 --> 01:01:59.441]  And hence, you start dealing with the fact that it's supernatural.
[01:02:01.462 --> 01:02:04.364]  And then you study the top architects of the New World Order.
[01:02:04.404 --> 01:02:08.888]  They're deeply occultic and believe that they are being directed
[01:02:09.901 --> 01:02:10.801]  by entities.
[01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:13.822]  And whether that's true or not, you can debate.
[01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:16.062]  That's your opinion.
[01:02:16.122 --> 01:02:16.882]  I have my opinion.
[01:02:17.622 --> 01:02:25.864]  The manifestation in the group collective, from a Jungian psychology view, nevertheless is real and is happening.
[01:02:26.324 --> 01:02:30.685]  So finishing up your point, Jeff, about what you think the big issue is.
[01:02:31.805 --> 01:02:35.705]  Well, the big issue coming into 2015 is people want change.
[01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:37.626]  We can have change in this country.
[01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:38.626]  We can have it peacefully.
[01:02:39.525 --> 01:02:48.653]  But we have to start at home, on a local level, your local church, being involved, being spiritual, because we are in a spiritual war.
[01:02:49.053 --> 01:02:54.097]  As far as the changing things in 2015, people's hearts have got to get right.
[01:02:54.397 --> 01:02:58.120]  They've got to come to the fact of realizing to live within their own means.
[01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:02.164]  You're not going to vote for somebody that lives outside their means if you do the same thing.
[01:03:02.964 --> 01:03:05.026]  So you're going to vote, you're going to vote just like you live.
[01:03:06.087 --> 01:03:08.509]  And the people that say they want change,
[01:03:09.264 --> 01:03:13.287]  The majority of Americans say they want it, but when it comes down to it, they don't.
[01:03:14.088 --> 01:03:24.335]  As far as the false flag stuff coming in, we're bombarded every day from all news sources, and we need to be prepared on a huge level.
[01:03:24.396 --> 01:03:26.998]  Listening to news and being bombarded with it's not a bad thing.
[01:03:27.038 --> 01:03:28.218]  You've got to be a good steward of it.
[01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:38.086]  But you have to also, with that, kind of understand in the preparedness mindset is that if you leave out the spiritual aspects, you don't have anything.
[01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:42.891]  Because I guarantee you, we are all going to die at some point.
[01:03:43.631 --> 01:03:45.352]  So spiritually, we've got to be ready for that.
[01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:49.095]  And let that grow our preparedness movement out of it.
[01:03:49.515 --> 01:03:57.900]  Let that grow our government out of it, so that spiritually, we start at home, good moms, good dads, raising good kids.
[01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:00.662]  You do that long enough, you're going to have a good government.
[01:04:00.942 --> 01:04:03.044]  And this other stuff is going to take care of itself.
[01:04:04.224 --> 01:04:06.666]  We're bombarded by the global elites constantly.
[01:04:07.307 --> 01:04:14.192]  By having a just one thing after another coming so fast that you can't focus on one thing at a time.
[01:04:15.113 --> 01:04:17.235]  And at the end of the day, you know what?
[01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:21.198]  America has been threatening ever since 9-11.
[01:04:21.738 --> 01:04:23.499]  Next year, something's going to happen.
[01:04:23.519 --> 01:04:24.780]  We're going to fundamentally change.
[01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:27.162]  And that has happened every single year.
[01:04:27.683 --> 01:04:30.585]  But you don't see it because you're living in it.
[01:04:31.005 --> 01:04:32.907]  It's slow motion, but it's moving.
[01:04:33.767 --> 01:04:37.170]  And the only way it's going to get fixed is if Americans
[01:04:37.816 --> 01:04:45.981]  People around the world put their heart and soul in Jesus Christ and learn that, you know what I say on my front porch?
[01:04:46.662 --> 01:04:50.164]  That don't mean nothing if I don't live it out in my life.
[01:04:51.884 --> 01:04:52.484]  Well said.
[01:04:52.605 --> 01:04:53.125]  Well said.
[01:04:53.165 --> 01:04:59.252]  And then people get turned away from the church because it's run by the government in many cases, spewing globalist doctrines.
[01:04:59.272 --> 01:05:05.760]  So we need to clean up our own homes, clean up our own hearts, and then clean up these churches and produce better people.
[01:05:06.041 --> 01:05:07.002]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:05:07.042 --> 01:05:07.763]  You're absolutely right.
[01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:16.407]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:05:16.647 --> 01:05:20.430]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:26.694]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:05:27.034 --> 01:05:32.838]  Using super oxygenation, OxyPowder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body.
[01:05:33.018 --> 01:05:40.945]  While you sleep with easy capsules, tens of thousands of individuals have used oxy powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[01:05:41.346 --> 01:05:46.670]  Even InfoWars Nightly News director Rob Dew has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:49.333]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[01:05:49.493 --> 01:05:50.634]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[01:05:50.794 --> 01:05:51.955]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[01:05:52.135 --> 01:05:52.576]  Seven days.
[01:05:53.677 --> 01:05:54.737]  2015 can be different.
[01:05:54.857 --> 01:05:57.800]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.901]  OxyPowder flushes it out.
[01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:03.023]  Secure your OxyPowder at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:05.125]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:15.192]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[01:06:15.512 --> 01:06:18.314]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[01:06:18.834 --> 01:06:21.636]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:21.896 --> 01:06:27.440]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.

[01:07:39.261 --> 01:07:43.282]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:48.424]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12.

[01:08:21.343 --> 01:08:22.384]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:26.645]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:30.046 --> 01:08:39.928]  Always thought-provoking, Steve Quayle is with us for the next two hours on this live Tuesday, 23rd day of December 2014, level transmission.
[01:08:42.102 --> 01:08:45.323]  And the topic with the callers, we'll go to your calls at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:50.245]  The topic is something that Steve can really comment on.
[01:08:50.845 --> 01:08:57.507]  What do you see as the biggest globalist next move in 2015 coming up?
[01:08:57.827 --> 01:09:10.131]  War with Russia, opening the borders, further Obama acting as a dictator openly, turning off more of our power plants, economic collapse, currency devaluation,
[01:09:11.485 --> 01:09:14.726]  And what are some of the positive news people think is going to come in 2015?
[01:09:17.247 --> 01:09:32.171]  Obviously Steve Quayle has talked a lot about for months that it's not really Ebola, it's an Ebola simulant that is killing people but being used to track the spread of disease and test federal control of local health authorities.
[01:09:33.852 --> 01:09:41.034]  Obama came out weeks after Steve had said that and said this is really just a test case to track something more deadly in airborne.
[01:09:43.027 --> 01:09:56.155]  All I know is, I've had a medical doctor who runs three hospitals in Missouri, on air, by name, talk about how he's talked to other doctors and naming the hospitals where they're disappearing people that have Ebola-like symptoms.
[01:09:56.815 --> 01:10:08.102]  Then Forbes writer came out and said they were in a meeting with the CDC director, with AP, Reuters, and others, before a press conference, and they agreed, in a pre-meeting, not to bring up the disappearing people.
[01:10:09.767 --> 01:10:10.987]  Fox News Sunday.
[01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:13.908]  I want to get that clip ready, just because we mentioned this last time with Steve.
[01:10:15.009 --> 01:10:16.169]  Fox News Sunday.
[01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:25.932]  Investigative journalist was on there and said that she'd called the CDC and they admitted thousands, or I think she said 1,500 or so.
[01:10:27.692 --> 01:10:28.733]  We'll play the clip in a moment.
[01:10:29.753 --> 01:10:30.573]  Play the exact clip.
[01:10:31.033 --> 01:10:31.814]  I'm going from memory.
[01:10:33.074 --> 01:10:35.635]  Of what looked like Ebola, but that they don't list it.
[01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:36.495]  There's a cover-up.
[01:10:37.622 --> 01:10:40.084]  And then I've talked to other medical doctors that say indeed it's happening.
[01:10:40.345 --> 01:10:47.071]  I'm not going to go into a whole Ebola discussion, but we went on air because we had doctors by name telling us and other doctors confirming it.
[01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:52.576]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but this is a case example of covering something up.
[01:10:54.738 --> 01:11:01.885]  This time last year, my great-uncle had died, my cousin had died, all in East Texas living near to each other.
[01:11:03.294 --> 01:11:10.916]  And then in January, my uncle died of a respiratory illness that they could never figure out what it was, and there were just deaths at all the major hospitals around the country.
[01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:16.517]  The doctors told me the worst they'd ever seen, and that the feds were basically telling them not to talk about it.
[01:11:16.857 --> 01:11:18.297]  That even came out in the news.
[01:11:18.337 --> 01:11:21.838]  So, we've got this other mystery viral illness killing kids.
[01:11:22.638 --> 01:11:25.559]  The point is, government can cover up stories.
[01:11:27.506 --> 01:11:42.697]  That's why they hate InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrugsReport.com, WorldNetDaily.com, SteveQuell.com, any site that will question outside of their narrative, or carry foreign news, or post a link to a YouTube video.
[01:11:42.957 --> 01:11:46.940]  They just don't like the fact that we are unfiltered and give a wide view.
[01:11:48.015 --> 01:11:53.541]  People go to Infowars.com all the time and they say, I see pro-government propaganda here, or I see government statements here.
[01:11:53.961 --> 01:11:55.623]  Why do you have a video of Obama talking?
[01:11:56.043 --> 01:11:57.765]  Because we're just showing you everything.
[01:11:59.747 --> 01:12:02.250]  The only agenda is we're trying to figure stuff out too.
[01:12:04.052 --> 01:12:05.613]  We don't claim to have all the answers.
[01:12:06.354 --> 01:12:09.117]  We have a bias to tell the truth, promote freedom.
[01:12:10.768 --> 01:12:12.049]  Some of us are more libertarian.
[01:12:12.069 --> 01:12:13.129]  Some of us are more conservative.
[01:12:13.509 --> 01:12:15.350]  Some of us are classical liberals.
[01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:16.450]  That doesn't matter.
[01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:20.372]  We have goodwill and don't want to live in a police state, slave state.
[01:12:21.372 --> 01:12:24.453]  So I want to talk with Steve Quill today about some of the big issues he's breaking down.
[01:12:24.933 --> 01:12:25.694]  Civil war.
[01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:26.794]  I've been harping on that.
[01:12:27.414 --> 01:12:32.296]  The war on police so that they can then twist the police against the public for a war on the public.
[01:12:32.656 --> 01:12:34.157]  This is classic divide and conquer.
[01:12:34.797 --> 01:12:35.997]  Police versus the people.
[01:12:37.358 --> 01:12:39.419]  Cyber attacks on banking.
[01:12:40.603 --> 01:12:48.673]  Sino-Soviet axis and more geopolitically what's happening from all of Steve Quayle's very interesting and informative sources.
[01:12:49.454 --> 01:12:50.756]  He joins us.
[01:12:51.537 --> 01:12:53.560]  Steve Quayle, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:57.070]  We're good to go.
[01:13:15.273 --> 01:13:16.053]  Yes, I think so.
[01:13:41.278 --> 01:13:42.239]  We're good to go.
[01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.110]  We're good to go.
[01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:15.919]  But we won't go there.
[01:14:15.939 --> 01:14:31.009]  The bottom line is the agent provocateurs, whether they're Barack Hussein Obama, whether it's Al Sharpton, whether it's Jesse Jackson, whether it's all the different people that are basically vilifying the cops.
[01:14:31.029 --> 01:14:40.756]  Now, years ago, when I went on talk radio, and you started listening to me, what, 23 years ago, I said the formula I saw in play for the last days of the Republic would be IVND.
[01:14:42.337 --> 01:14:43.178]  We're good to go.
[01:14:57.791 --> 01:14:58.151]  I think so.
[01:15:14.562 --> 01:15:18.724]  This is the full takedown of the United States, both from within and without.
[01:15:18.744 --> 01:15:19.604]  Look at the military.
[01:15:19.984 --> 01:15:21.204]  This is critical to talk to.
[01:15:21.304 --> 01:15:34.229]  We, you, I, others have covered all of the firings of our military leaders, Navy admirals, you know, anybody with combat experience.
[01:15:34.389 --> 01:15:38.251]  And then the stories in the last week, Alex, you know, there are stories coming out.
[01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:39.351]  Could our nuclear
[01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:40.391]  We're good to go.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.240]  We're good to go.
[01:16:27.534 --> 01:16:27.874]  I don't think so.
[01:16:57.503 --> 01:17:23.753]  Well, when you see the President of the United States and MSNBC and CNN openly trying to fan race war, openly trying to push, you know, kill the cops, I mean, that's so transparent that they're trying to create a major crisis so the Feds can then come in as the saviors as a smokescreen while Obama opens the borders, signs us on to derivatives like Congress just did,
[01:17:24.233 --> 01:17:28.577]  I mean, signs us on to the Pacific Partnership, waiving our sovereignty.
[01:17:28.657 --> 01:17:29.858]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:17:30.259 --> 01:17:34.362]  More is happening right now than happened in the last 20 years, Steve.
[01:17:34.662 --> 01:17:37.285]  And I only see it accelerating towards a quickening.
[01:17:37.965 --> 01:17:38.546]  Absolutely.
[01:17:39.146 --> 01:17:40.528]  Alex, it's no longer linear.
[01:17:40.988 --> 01:17:44.191]  There was a time when events, one would follow the other.
[01:17:44.211 --> 01:17:49.936]  Now it's like all of the rods going into a nuclear reactor, creating a chain reaction.
[01:17:50.036 --> 01:17:53.159]  And it doesn't matter if you're looking to the east, the west, the north, or the south.
[01:17:53.559 --> 01:17:55.000]  It's all happening at once.
[01:17:55.441 --> 01:17:58.083]  And here's what's going to happen just in the policing.
[01:17:58.423 --> 01:18:06.730]  I believe you're going to see selective areas of the country, the troublemakers, the provocateurs, Asian provocateurs are going to ratchet up.
[01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.492]  And I think the thing that's going to happen
[01:18:09.312 --> 01:18:20.217]  If you look at even Chile and some of the South American countries, Argentina and others, when policing breaks down and Marxists start to take the hold, what do you end up with?
[01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:21.658]  You end up with death squads.
[01:18:22.158 --> 01:18:26.880]  And the problem is the death squads have been mostly on the other side to date.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.541]  That's right, that's right.
[01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:33.323]  They'll use the destabilization exactly to set up the death squads and then they'll be used against us.
[01:18:33.603 --> 01:18:36.765]  They'll flip them when the Marxists take full control of the government.
[01:18:37.265 --> 01:18:37.845]  Absolutely.
[01:18:38.166 --> 01:18:49.173]  We saw the saddest day when Andrew Breitbart was murdered, followed by Tom Clancy was murdered, followed by Chris Kyle, followed by the Navy SEAL.
[01:18:49.213 --> 01:18:50.594]  Well, I don't want to get into it.
[01:18:50.734 --> 01:18:55.377]  They sent somebody here and he got stopped, and then he went back to California and killed a cop.
[01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:58.659]  So, I mean, they're really pulling the stops out right now.
[01:18:59.332 --> 01:18:59.953]  Absolutely.
[01:19:00.353 --> 01:19:13.384]  And I think this is what, again, most people have to understand, is we're at the point where now the overwhelming of the system is simply a Saul Alinsky ploy.
[01:19:13.504 --> 01:19:16.627]  Anybody that doesn't know the background on Saul Alinsky, A-L-I-N-S-K-Y,
[01:19:17.168 --> 01:19:17.708]  Break it down.
[01:19:17.748 --> 01:19:19.470]  He dedicated his book to Lucifer.
[01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:21.472]  Rules for Radicals.
[01:19:21.512 --> 01:19:27.379]  Guys, I've got one around the office, but just show a screenshot of the opening page dedicated to Lucifer, the original revolutionary.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.782]  Stay there, Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[01:19:30.082 --> 01:19:34.868]  I want to lay out, because I know you're an expert on this, how they planned this.
[01:19:34.908 --> 01:19:35.668]  And when you see it,
[01:19:36.309 --> 01:19:45.495]  Foreign megabanks using a Marxist classic takeover program, just like they financed radical Islam in the Arab Spring to take over, they mean business, folks.
[01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:50.138]  And just like they tried to overthrow Egypt to bring in mass slaughter, they want it here.
[01:19:50.178 --> 01:19:53.460]  That's why I keep harping and harping and harping and harping.
[01:19:55.071 --> 01:19:57.074]  That yeah, sure the system's got problems.
[01:19:57.715 --> 01:19:59.999]  Local system has problems, but it's not the enemy.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.984]  The globalists causing a civil war are.
[01:20:03.405 --> 01:20:05.428]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:20:05.729 --> 01:20:06.730]  Steve Quayle is our guest.

[01:21:08.752 --> 01:21:11.034]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:21:11.654 --> 01:21:14.916]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:21:15.196 --> 01:21:16.978]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:21:17.358 --> 01:21:26.364]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.

[01:22:08.402 --> 01:22:10.963]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:11.223 --> 01:22:16.085]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:16.346 --> 01:22:24.169]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:24.469 --> 01:22:28.770]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:32.811]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:38.673]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:38.913 --> 01:22:41.674]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:42.074 --> 01:22:47.215]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:24:12.819 --> 01:24:14.599]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:15.939 --> 01:24:17.260]  Steve Quayle, riding shotgun.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:17.980]  Your calls, JJ.
[01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:36.703]  Steve, Jerry, Margaret, John, your calls are all coming up with your predictions for what you think the most important issues of 2015 are, for your questions for Steve Quayle, who will continue his analysis right through to the next hour, but I want to do some calls before we get into more of it with him in the next hour.
[01:24:37.184 --> 01:24:38.725]  We're about to go right back to Steve Quayle.
[01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:43.970]  But when you watch, it doesn't mean there isn't massive police abuse.
[01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:48.314]  It doesn't mean there aren't a lot of bad departments, or asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:24:48.674 --> 01:24:52.197]  It doesn't mean that the federalization hasn't caused a lot of issues.
[01:24:53.798 --> 01:25:02.766]  There are people that either mindlessly support whatever the police do, and then that gives rise to arrogance and corruption, or they just say kill all the police.
[01:25:04.386 --> 01:25:05.547]  It's called due process.
[01:25:05.747 --> 01:25:13.572]  It's called measuring what individuals do, not what somebody in uniform does in New York versus somebody in Texas.
[01:25:15.213 --> 01:25:24.999]  But when I look at these police, anti-police protests, it's the Democratic Party, it's the Socialist Party, it's the Communist Party, it's the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:27.861]  You can see the group signs will say who's sponsoring it.
[01:25:28.121 --> 01:25:28.982]  George Soros!
[01:25:29.878 --> 01:25:31.778]  The same guy that just overthrew Ukraine.
[01:25:32.459 --> 01:25:35.880]  And it doesn't mean Russia's good either, but they're starting it.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:41.781]  It's internationalists who want to bring in this crisis, this destabilization, this cloward and pivot.
[01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.302]  And it's a communist tactic.
[01:25:44.622 --> 01:25:46.482]  Doesn't mean they're going to bring communism in.
[01:25:47.543 --> 01:25:56.725]  It's declassified that British intelligence funded Lenin to take over in 1917-1918 as part of the great game to bring down Russia.
[01:25:57.699 --> 01:26:01.042]  These globalists use communists to take over.
[01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.444]  Let's go back to Steve Quayle.
[01:26:03.465 --> 01:26:04.746]  Steve Quayle, break this down.
[01:26:05.086 --> 01:26:13.994]  Talk about Saul Alinsky, who we now know Hillary Clinton got caught writing basically worship letters to when she was in college and him advising her.
[01:26:14.535 --> 01:26:16.697]  I mean, this is truly disgusting.
[01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:20.661]  This is a guy who said he wanted to basically put farmers in forced labor camps.
[01:26:21.736 --> 01:26:27.571]  Absolutely, and you know, there is rules for radicals and then his eight levels of control.
[01:26:31.718 --> 01:26:38.764]  You and I talk about, and have ever talked about on talk radio or interviews, there is a control mechanism, the unseen hand.
[01:26:38.784 --> 01:26:40.545]  But number one, healthcare.
[01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:43.147]  These are Saul Alinsky's biggest points.
[01:26:43.647 --> 01:26:48.831]  And I tell people, if you understand the root of evil, then every single piece of legislation makes sense.
[01:26:48.851 --> 01:26:51.914]  And by the way, look at the chicken poop, and that's what they are.
[01:26:52.554 --> 01:26:58.499]  Republicans, they could have stopped this entity, the man in the slaughterhouse, at any point.
[01:26:59.079 --> 01:26:59.760]  And they didn't.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.521]  So people say, well, I just believe
[01:27:01.621 --> 01:27:02.942]  We had a great victory!
[01:27:03.242 --> 01:27:04.022]  The great victory?
[01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:04.643]  Are you kidding?
[01:27:04.863 --> 01:27:05.943]  Tell me anything that has changed.
[01:27:05.963 --> 01:27:07.364]  Well, let's go back to Saul Alinsky.
[01:27:07.784 --> 01:27:08.325]  Healthcare.
[01:27:08.385 --> 01:27:08.985]  Number one.
[01:27:09.265 --> 01:27:11.266]  Control healthcare and you control the people.
[01:27:11.606 --> 01:27:19.230]  What was the most important thing of this destroyer's principle is Obamacare.
[01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:19.831]  Poverty.
[01:27:20.351 --> 01:27:23.913]  Increase the poverty level as high as possible.
[01:27:24.353 --> 01:27:31.097]  Poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you're providing everything for them to live.
[01:27:31.717 --> 01:27:32.779]  Increase the poverty level.
[01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:37.143]  100 million people unemployed, 48, 49 million people on food stamps.
[01:27:37.283 --> 01:27:37.584]  Debt.
[01:27:38.304 --> 01:27:40.887]  Increase the debt to an unsustainable level.
[01:27:41.288 --> 01:27:44.911]  That way you're able to increase taxes and this will produce more poverty.
[01:27:45.352 --> 01:27:48.155]  Ask yourself, ladies and gentlemen, where has the middle class gone?
[01:27:48.615 --> 01:27:50.918]  To a large degree, they're destroyed.
[01:27:51.018 --> 01:27:51.739]  Gun control.
[01:27:52.586 --> 01:27:54.747]  Remove the ability to defend themselves in the government.
[01:27:54.807 --> 01:27:57.489]  That way you are able to create a police state.
[01:27:58.130 --> 01:27:58.730]  Welfare.
[01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:00.751]  Take control of every aspect of their lives.
[01:28:00.871 --> 01:28:02.192]  Food, housing, and income.
[01:28:02.212 --> 01:28:07.255]  And Alex, we've got to get to the food issue right now because that's going on as we speak.
[01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.276]  Education.
[01:28:08.536 --> 01:28:10.397]  Take control of what people read and listen to.
[01:28:10.677 --> 01:28:13.579]  Take control of what children learn in school.
[01:28:14.199 --> 01:28:15.580]  Core teaching.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:16.941]  The core curriculum.
[01:28:17.401 --> 01:28:20.703]  I remember, you know, Tom Terrific, the old day cartoons.
[01:28:21.744 --> 01:28:22.545]  We're good to go.
[01:28:37.553 --> 01:28:38.334]  I don't know.
[01:28:52.329 --> 01:28:54.550]  We're seeing it right before our very eyes.
[01:28:54.910 --> 01:29:02.373]  You and I could take any one of those subjects and talk for 24 hours straight, and that's not a boast, it just happens to be true, and deal with it.
[01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:07.075]  So what we then go to is, you know, the rules.
[01:29:07.555 --> 01:29:08.895]  Rules for radicals.
[01:29:09.315 --> 01:29:14.257]  And that's the bottom line, is it always starts with, are you ready for this?
[01:29:14.397 --> 01:29:15.838]  Community organizers.
[01:29:16.398 --> 01:29:18.719]  Number one, power is not only what you have,
[01:29:18.899 --> 01:29:23.703]  Stay there, you're reading the guru of the Democratic Party running this country for foreign globalists.
[01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:48.864]  Saul Alinsky openly how to wreck things, how to make people poor, and then how to take over society.
[01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:53.828]  This is the person that Hillary wrote to saying, you are basically my North Star.
[01:29:54.408 --> 01:29:57.051]  You are my governing, you know, director.
[01:29:57.751 --> 01:29:58.472]  Just pure evil.
[01:29:58.532 --> 01:29:59.413]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.913 --> 01:30:01.515]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.435 --> 01:30:05.118]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.378 --> 01:30:20.502]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
[01:30:20.742 --> 01:30:34.546]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:30:34.966 --> 01:30:37.767]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:38.067 --> 01:30:39.247]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:39.488 --> 01:30:43.509]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:30:43.809 --> 01:30:53.012]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.
[01:30:53.432 --> 01:30:53.792]  Secret 12.
[01:30:54.512 --> 01:30:59.774]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift and is tailor-made to boost your New Year's resolutions.
[01:31:00.174 --> 01:31:02.235]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[01:31:02.515 --> 01:31:04.936]  Secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:05.956 --> 01:31:10.198]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:10.218 --> 01:31:13.900]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.781]  To finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:31:17.021 --> 01:31:20.823]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[01:31:20.963 --> 01:31:24.645]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with Oxy-Powder.
[01:31:24.885 --> 01:31:27.226]  The next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:31:27.706 --> 01:31:30.047]  Using Super Oxygenation Oxy-Powder.
[01:31:30.347 --> 01:31:35.631]  Available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:40.915]  Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dude has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[01:31:41.235 --> 01:31:43.597]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[01:31:43.757 --> 01:31:46.899]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.901]  And I've been able to keep it off too.
[01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:50.742]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[01:31:50.762 --> 01:31:53.184]  And I'm like, I know, I guess it's this Oxy-Powder.
[01:31:53.204 --> 01:31:55.146]  2015 can be different.
[01:31:55.246 --> 01:31:58.128]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:31:58.448 --> 01:32:00.271]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.
[01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:03.375]  Secure your Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:03.655 --> 01:32:05.518]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:13.041]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:13.202 --> 01:32:17.163]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:17.463 --> 01:32:18.924]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:19.244 --> 01:32:26.827]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:32:27.107 --> 01:32:27.948]  But for how long?
[01:32:28.248 --> 01:32:34.511]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:32:34.891 --> 01:32:37.692]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:43.184]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:32:43.945 --> 01:32:50.210]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:59.357]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[01:32:59.717 --> 01:33:04.561]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:11.602 --> 01:33:13.062]  We are on the march.
[01:33:13.442 --> 01:33:15.843]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:16.603 --> 01:33:20.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.904 --> 01:33:32.906]  When you look at the planetary engineers, they know what they're doing.
[01:33:32.926 --> 01:33:33.606]  They're cold-blooded.
[01:33:35.546 --> 01:33:37.827]  And if we're unaware of their tactics, we're helpless.
[01:33:37.887 --> 01:33:40.007]  If we're aware of their tactics and can educate others,
[01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:43.611]  We can certainly protect ourselves and our families.
[01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:48.473]  Even if you were a sociopath, knowing how the world really works can make you very wealthy.
[01:33:50.254 --> 01:33:55.997]  The globalists want you dumbed down so that you can be fed on, as Christ said, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:33:57.698 --> 01:34:04.501]  And the reason I'm so dedicated and quite frankly fearless in the face of this is, I realize there's no future if we don't stand up against this.
[01:34:06.297 --> 01:34:11.679]  Going along with it, especially in the final phases of this, ensures your destruction.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:17.321]  But also, it means you've chosen to join with the New World Order.
[01:34:20.202 --> 01:34:28.365]  We're reading through Saul Alinsky, Hillary Clinton's mentor, and every Democrat I know who's an operative, I mean, they worship this guy.
[01:34:28.665 --> 01:34:32.446]  And I remember reading his book like 20 years ago, Rules for Radicals.
[01:34:32.747 --> 01:34:33.547]  It's a short little book.
[01:34:34.628 --> 01:34:40.891]  And it's so evil how they want to make people poor so they can control them and how they're going to be the ruling class engineers.
[01:34:40.952 --> 01:34:42.072]  It's just more eugenics.
[01:34:45.214 --> 01:34:52.138]  It's so evil to read what Margaret Sanger wrote about black people and using liberalism to control them and just to know the plan.
[01:34:53.178 --> 01:34:55.600]  That's why I dream of defeating these people.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.663]  And just like they want to dumb people down and motivate them to fight for tyranny, believing it's liberation,
[01:35:05.507 --> 01:35:09.189]  I mean, the weathermen and stuff, they were the ones that said, go out and just shoot a pig.
[01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:19.653]  And then that just turns the police into a bunch of paranoid paramilitary people, who'll then just feed on the general public.
[01:35:20.073 --> 01:35:25.656]  It's the way you destabilize a country, so they can then take over.
[01:35:25.736 --> 01:35:27.676]  That's a standard communist program.
[01:35:29.717 --> 01:35:31.178]  That's why it's so essential
[01:35:32.162 --> 01:35:44.553]  That everyone out there spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and these local AM and FM affiliates you're hearing us on, and that you tell friends and family about it, and that you thank the station, or become a sponsor, or support the sponsors, and let them know.
[01:35:44.874 --> 01:35:49.498]  Because we are growing, but meeting more resistance than ever.
[01:35:49.838 --> 01:35:53.321]  So we're walking forward in the storm, but it gets harder and harder.
[01:35:53.842 --> 01:35:55.624]  And we either grow or we implode.
[01:35:55.844 --> 01:35:56.785]  That's how media works.
[01:35:58.015 --> 01:35:59.997]  I need you to support us financially.
[01:36:00.458 --> 01:36:03.120]  I need you to support us by spreading the word and your prayers.
[01:36:05.663 --> 01:36:15.153]  And to support other media that stands up for the family and the Second Amendment and sovereignty, but that will expose the fact that, yes, the interest rates are rigged worldwide.
[01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:16.814]  We told you that 15 years ago.
[01:36:16.894 --> 01:36:18.136]  It's declassified last year.
[01:36:18.556 --> 01:36:20.158]  We told you the Federal Reserve was private.
[01:36:20.218 --> 01:36:20.999]  It's all admitted now.
[01:36:21.849 --> 01:36:23.690]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.491]  I've read Carol Quigley's book.
[01:36:25.591 --> 01:36:26.792]  I've read Brzezinski's books.
[01:36:27.172 --> 01:36:29.934]  I've read the non-fiction books of Aldous Huxley.
[01:36:30.874 --> 01:36:34.857]  The Doors of Perception and Brave New World Revisited.
[01:36:34.877 --> 01:36:37.678]  I mean, I've read Bertrand Russell's books.
[01:36:38.639 --> 01:36:40.580]  I know their diabolical plan.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:41.921]  We've quoted them here.
[01:36:44.758 --> 01:36:49.742]  The Club of Rome documents that Steve was reading a few months ago when he was on, where they said we're going to wage war against humanity.
[01:36:50.062 --> 01:36:51.283]  This is so cold-blooded!
[01:36:51.644 --> 01:36:54.786]  But to get us to go along with it, they have to first turn us all against each other.
[01:36:56.488 --> 01:36:57.288]  And it's so sickening.
[01:36:58.529 --> 01:37:00.351]  So today, it's more important than ever.
[01:37:00.791 --> 01:37:02.332]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:02.392 --> 01:37:03.533]  It takes a minute to sign up.
[01:37:05.315 --> 01:37:07.857]  Create a username and passcode that's original, just to the site.
[01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:13.352]  And then share your username with friends and family.
[01:37:13.372 --> 01:37:15.774]  20 people can simultaneously log on.
[01:37:17.075 --> 01:37:26.022]  And if your membership gets used and 20 people log on, you ought to thank God if you try to tune into the Nightly News one night at 7 and you can't get on, that means 20 people are using your membership.
[01:37:26.963 --> 01:37:29.725]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:30.145 --> 01:37:30.706]  Go there.
[01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:32.387]  Give it as a Christmas gift.
[01:37:33.208 --> 01:37:34.449]  Give it to friends and family.
[01:37:34.769 --> 01:37:35.710]  Give it as an e-card.
[01:37:38.123 --> 01:37:39.228]  20 people can log on.
[01:37:39.248 --> 01:37:41.616]  That's 12 cents a person per month.
[01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:47.130]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:47.890 --> 01:37:49.211]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:49.451 --> 01:37:56.914]  We've got a bunch of specials still running on the entire family of InfoWarsLife.com products that really have been life-changing for myself and others.
[01:37:57.154 --> 01:38:07.699]  Whether it's X-2 Nation Iodine, or whether it's Oxy Powder to flush out your intestines, or whether it's high-quality colloidal silver at a low price, Silver Bullet, we've got it all at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:07.899 --> 01:38:10.260]  And that's how I finance this operation.
[01:38:11.499 --> 01:38:12.840]  And I thank you all for your prayers.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:18.283]  And be sure to go over as well and check out all the amazing books and information at SteveQuayle.com.
[01:38:18.303 --> 01:38:19.963]  We'll talk about that more in the next hour.
[01:38:20.024 --> 01:38:20.764]  Steve, I'm ranting.
[01:38:21.064 --> 01:38:24.046]  I want to go to calls because they're holding with their predictions.
[01:38:24.086 --> 01:38:26.007]  I want their ideas to bounce off you.
[01:38:26.327 --> 01:38:29.889]  Then you'll be able to get back into a deep breakdown of what's happening because you're on fire today.
[01:38:29.909 --> 01:38:35.472]  But start back over with the rules for radicals from the guy that dedicates his life to Lucifer.
[01:38:36.348 --> 01:38:52.839]  That just this year, all these Hillary letters got released out of the Clinton Library with her in correspondence with him, when Life Magazine, when she was in college, was saying, here's a woman who may be first lady, to show how they groom these amoral demons.
[01:38:53.699 --> 01:38:55.841]  Break down their plan to bring down America.
[01:38:56.769 --> 01:39:13.720]  First of all, you know, the fifth principle you should appreciate more and I should appreciate more because of the assault that's been levied against you and the continual interruption of my broadcast on Talk Radio, Alex, on a shortwave where I was for two decades.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:21.525]  No one was ever taken off the air or taken off satellites more than you or I. Now here's something that people have got to understand.
[01:39:21.845 --> 01:39:24.987]  For all the shills that attack Alex, for all the shills that attack me,
[01:39:25.787 --> 01:39:29.411]  Ridicule is the man's most potent weapon.
[01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:30.972]  There is no defense.
[01:39:31.052 --> 01:39:31.933]  It's irrational.
[01:39:32.033 --> 01:39:32.834]  It's infuriating.
[01:39:32.854 --> 01:39:38.078]  It also works as creep, as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.
[01:39:38.098 --> 01:39:44.804]  Would you say, Alex Jones, that you have experienced that at an accelerated pace the last three months?
[01:39:45.004 --> 01:39:45.205]  Yes.
[01:39:45.925 --> 01:39:47.827]  Okay, now listen to this.
[01:39:48.467 --> 01:39:52.290]  A good tactic is one that your people enjoy.
[01:39:52.511 --> 01:39:55.333]  They'll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more.
[01:39:55.593 --> 01:39:58.936]  They're doing their thing, and we'll even suggest better ones.
[01:39:58.956 --> 01:40:02.058]  A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.
[01:40:02.519 --> 01:40:03.620]  Don't become old news.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.961]  So all we're seeing is
[01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:05.581]  Yes.
[01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:36.481]  I don't know.
[01:41:07.025 --> 01:41:16.868]  The purpose of the whore and all the beheadings and all the gory stuff that's gone on, all the videos on YouTube, is to frighten your opponent and get him to yield.
[01:41:17.288 --> 01:41:18.628]  And then they just come in and kill everybody.
[01:41:18.648 --> 01:41:19.429]  Well, I got news.
[01:41:19.469 --> 01:41:20.769]  They don't know about Texas.
[01:41:21.129 --> 01:41:23.290]  And I just posted a photo of my day.
[01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:24.530]  Montana's the same way.
[01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:28.331]  And it showed three, like, Western guys checking their pieces to go out.
[01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:32.833]  And, I mean, it's at a ghost town called Nevada City.
[01:41:39.039 --> 01:41:43.840]  What we have to do is expose these murderers, and we have to say, it is murder.
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:46.641]  And I'm telling you this, watch this happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:46.981 --> 01:41:50.121]  Either de Blasio will quit, or he's going to be dealt with.
[01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:54.822]  I'm not saying that, I mean, you know, the thing is, the guy should resign.
[01:41:55.202 --> 01:42:07.285]  When you lose your backing by the local police, and for the record, Alex, you probably saw the story, not one cop wants to be head of his security detail.
[01:42:08.129 --> 01:42:08.849]  Not one copy.
[01:42:08.869 --> 01:42:09.489]  Did you see that?
[01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:11.150]  Yes, I did.
[01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:15.551]  And so now what we're seeing is we're seeing divide and conquer.
[01:42:17.072 --> 01:42:19.072]  And this is my chief warning.
[01:42:19.092 --> 01:42:28.635]  The greatest issue that I have faced in the last five years is trying to get the vets to understand, the veterans, that they are the enemy.
[01:42:29.015 --> 01:42:31.436]  To try and get the average person to understand.
[01:42:31.696 --> 01:42:36.477]  Look, I've been talking about the red list, the blue list, and the green list for years, okay?
[01:42:46.324 --> 01:42:50.187]  Absolutely, and I've been told, it's been in major newspapers, that I'm on that list.
[01:42:50.768 --> 01:42:52.369]  But we certainly know who's on the list.
[01:42:52.449 --> 01:43:00.055]  It's who Media Matters attacks, run by the White House, and they've been caught actually trying to infiltrate and bring down alternative media.
[01:43:00.885 --> 01:43:01.665]  Absolutely.
[01:43:01.965 --> 01:43:07.667]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is more important than ever, and Alex, I've said this, this is no flattery.
[01:43:08.087 --> 01:43:11.048]  I love Info Wars and I love Prison Planet.
[01:43:11.148 --> 01:43:13.309]  This is a prison planet.
[01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:17.210]  If they have their ways, you know, I remember talking about population reduction.
[01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:22.292]  I one time did a whole show and I think I quoted, you know, close to a hundred of the most famous people.
[01:43:22.392 --> 01:43:23.313]  We're good to go.
[01:43:38.942 --> 01:43:42.905]  Embrace the President and his policies.
[01:43:42.925 --> 01:43:47.047]  You've just got to understand what Margaret Sanger said about black people.
[01:43:47.487 --> 01:44:02.756]  And listen, there are some amazing, and what I find interesting, Alex, the guys who are the most outspoken against the evil, and God bless every one of them, are basically people who are black athletes and black pastors standing their ground for Jesus.
[01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.397]  I put them up every time they come up.
[01:44:04.817 --> 01:44:07.359]  You know, it doesn't matter if it's like
[01:44:07.659 --> 01:44:08.199]  We're good to go.
[01:44:32.316 --> 01:44:33.156]  We're good to go.
[01:44:57.805 --> 01:45:04.648]  And yet, it's kind of, if you will, it's a mental shock, a pair of cymbals smashing the opposite sides of your head.
[01:45:04.668 --> 01:45:12.212]  You've got people that have denied God, the atheists, yet behind the scenes they're secret Luciferian worshippers.
[01:45:12.352 --> 01:45:15.754]  And the end time is coming right into perspective.
[01:45:16.014 --> 01:45:20.917]  It's no longer in the indefinite future, it's now in the present.
[01:45:21.017 --> 01:45:25.960]  And the basis of all revolution is the overthrow of existing
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:43.625]  Morality, existing national boundaries, and the globalist... Look, if you and I tell people a hundred times they want 90% of the world's population dead, and real quick, back to Ebola, as of today, according to the World Health Organization, I believe they're cheating the numbers.
[01:45:43.665 --> 01:45:45.826]  I believe it's double what they admit have died.
[01:45:45.866 --> 01:45:48.507]  They're admitting 7560 people dead.
[01:45:48.867 --> 01:45:50.387]  I believe it's closer to 50,000.
[01:45:50.707 --> 01:45:52.388]  Look at the race that it was
[01:45:52.908 --> 01:45:53.849]  Generated against.
[01:45:54.189 --> 01:46:00.872]  When I spoke about bioweapons, Project Coast, you know, I think maybe in those days you must have thought, boy, Quail's on another planet.
[01:46:01.212 --> 01:46:10.117]  But the point is, is that I was interfacing in those days with people, and I couldn't know this stuff unless the people who were involved in it told me.
[01:46:10.237 --> 01:46:16.180]  And men of conscience right now are starting, it doesn't matter if they're former KGB, and believe it or not,
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:25.318]  There are Russian agents who care as much for what's going to happen to their people as British, as U.S.
[01:46:26.295 --> 01:46:26.855]  You name it.
[01:46:27.356 --> 01:46:30.717]  People know that they're all being played for suckers.
[01:46:30.757 --> 01:46:37.821]  That's why I even say to the gang members when I'm on radio, and I'll say it to those listening today, you're being played for suckers.
[01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:40.843]  When they're done with you, they kill you.
[01:46:41.283 --> 01:46:46.646]  That is their, if you will, their rules of revolution, and that's your fate.
[01:46:47.166 --> 01:46:49.867]  Don't go with what they tell you.
[01:46:50.007 --> 01:46:51.007]  It's a lie.
[01:46:51.367 --> 01:46:59.588]  And that's, Alex, what I believe the benefit of supporting InfoWars... I mean, you know, I don't know how many total videos have you produced?
[01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:02.409]  Well, we're trying our best here, Steve.
[01:47:02.909 --> 01:47:06.150]  All I see is it's converging and it's got to be a wake-up call.
[01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:12.931]  When the president says he'll implement a UN treaty to restrict gun ownership, even if Congress doesn't pass it, he'll...
[01:47:14.355 --> 01:47:17.276]  Put our troops under NATO-UN control without congressional approval.
[01:47:17.676 --> 01:47:20.158]  He'll open the borders up without congressional approval.
[01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:22.939]  And Congress doesn't even repeal Obamacare.
[01:47:23.579 --> 01:47:25.840]  It doesn't even try to stop Obama.
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:29.542]  Because of the Republican leadership, it shows the fixes in.
[01:47:29.602 --> 01:47:32.483]  But what's going to happen as the grassroots wakes up?
[01:47:33.223 --> 01:47:35.504]  And starts replacing him with more Tea Party people.
[01:47:35.524 --> 01:47:39.245]  I mean, what is the establishment planning to do?
[01:47:39.485 --> 01:47:43.667]  I believe it will be a false flag to demonize the Liberty Movement.
[01:47:43.967 --> 01:47:45.908]  What about the FBI's latest report?
[01:47:46.928 --> 01:47:48.229]  It's in USA Today.
[01:47:48.249 --> 01:47:50.670]  It's linked up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:55.392]  And it says the FBI links Ferguson anarchists to ISIS.
[01:47:56.172 --> 01:47:59.153]  Sovereign citizens also linked to Islamic terror.
[01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:01.134]  So that's basically a Tea Party type group.
[01:48:01.974 --> 01:48:08.624]  They think we're so dumb that, as you know, in the new army training manuals, they say they're preparing for the Tea Party to join ISIS.
[01:48:09.185 --> 01:48:14.232]  I mean, Tea Party is, to use a media term, the most Islamophobic group out there.
[01:48:14.673 --> 01:48:16.756]  How do they think they're going to make this pig fly?
[01:48:17.875 --> 01:48:20.396]  First of all, they're going to set up some throwaways.
[01:48:20.416 --> 01:48:24.818]  They're going to basically set an identity up, or multiple identities.
[01:48:25.318 --> 01:48:34.002]  The shooters or the assassins will basically do the killing, and they'll take the picture of their fake Tea Party member.
[01:48:34.022 --> 01:48:35.062]  And I agree with you, Alex.
[01:48:35.282 --> 01:48:39.924]  There is no continuity of thought between ISIS and the Tea Party.
[01:48:40.404 --> 01:48:41.685]  But remember, what
[01:48:42.205 --> 01:48:42.745]  We're good to go.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:11.983]  Uh, whoever, Ron Paul stickers and everything else, you, me, whoever, you know, all the books.
[01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:20.206]  And yet, at the same time, the people that are being set up had better scream at the top of their lungs.
[01:49:20.666 --> 01:49:28.890]  They better use the courts that still exist to file RICO suits, Racketeering and Influence Corrupt Officials Act.
[01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:38.957]  Because again, the point, I say the point is, you know, Alex, we can wake up all the people, but there comes a point when it's too late, okay?
[01:49:39.498 --> 01:49:47.203]  And so, I'm telling this, I say this to men and women of wealth, you need to get behind, and I couldn't be more serious than this.
[01:49:47.223 --> 01:49:50.226]  I have, let's see, I think I've got four grandkids, Alex, okay?
[01:49:50.426 --> 01:49:56.190]  I've got five kids and four grandkids, and when I read that story on my website today, I physically wanted to puke.
[01:49:56.610 --> 01:49:58.712]  And if this doesn't infuriate, I'll use that word,
[01:49:58.712 --> 01:50:01.553]  I don't want to use a P word because too many people get upset.
[01:50:02.854 --> 01:50:16.099]  That infuriates me to such an extent to think that never would any of us, 20 years ago, even 10 years ago, think that our grandchildren, our children, if you've got young children, could be sold into sex trafficking.
[01:50:16.559 --> 01:50:24.162]  And if people think that's crazy, Syria was one country before all the revolution.
[01:50:24.283 --> 01:50:27.724]  These devils, D-E-V-I-L-S,
[01:50:28.224 --> 01:50:29.986]  We're good to go.
[01:50:49.006 --> 01:50:50.708]  Just stand up and help the people.
[01:50:50.948 --> 01:50:52.489]  Oh, I know, it's incredible.
[01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:56.012]  I've met billionaires that know about all this, and they do nothing to stop it.
[01:50:57.033 --> 01:51:01.096]  I mean, I know somebody that is friends with one of the Walmart heirs worth $40 billion.
[01:51:01.497 --> 01:51:02.718]  She lives out in West Texas.
[01:51:03.078 --> 01:51:12.206]  She lives in a farmhouse, just drives her car around, and she knows about all this stuff, but just doesn't, you know, it's... This Hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:51:53.490 --> 01:51:54.231]  I know, right?

[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:27.484]  JJ, Steve, Jerry, Margaret, John, you've been holding while Steve's been on the last 50 minutes.

[01:54:44.306 --> 01:54:49.127]  We'll talk about the real economic status from Steve Quayle's research with him coming up.
[01:54:49.207 --> 01:54:50.448]  And look, I want a good economy.
[01:54:51.308 --> 01:54:52.688]  But we're on top of a giant bubble.
[01:54:53.188 --> 01:54:57.650]  And the globalists just passed a bunch of laws so they can sign us on to new derivatives.
[01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:58.750]  That's not our debt.
[01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:00.611]  I will get to that.
[01:55:00.671 --> 01:55:01.592]  First I have a question.
[01:55:01.612 --> 01:55:05.475]  Pretty important and I think a lot of people out here are wondering the same thing.
[01:55:05.535 --> 01:55:06.256]  It's about when
[01:55:18.786 --> 01:55:21.048]  When the crap hits the fan, everyone's been preparing.
[01:55:21.088 --> 01:55:26.433]  Everyone's been stocking up food, water, arms, whatever to keep their families safe.
[01:55:26.914 --> 01:55:28.055]  What is our endgame?
[01:55:28.175 --> 01:55:29.917]  Like, do we go hide in like a...
[01:55:30.737 --> 01:55:32.898]  In our fort, our bungalow, whatever.
[01:55:33.338 --> 01:55:33.938]  What do we do?
[01:55:34.199 --> 01:55:35.619]  Well, that varies on where you are.
[01:55:35.639 --> 01:55:40.481]  Look, people 50, 60 years ago were always prepared, even if a crisis wasn't coming down the road.
[01:55:40.501 --> 01:55:45.083]  If you lived in the Midwest, you had a storm shelter because people got killed by tornadoes.
[01:55:45.804 --> 01:55:47.984]  It wasn't that you were living in fear, you were just prepared.
[01:55:48.665 --> 01:55:51.626]  So getting back to the land, having a backup plan, that's key.
[01:55:51.666 --> 01:55:53.947]  Getting your heart right is even more important in my view.
[01:55:54.227 --> 01:55:55.668]  We'll get Steve Quayle's take on that.
[01:55:56.428 --> 01:55:57.869]  But in the final equation,
[01:55:58.789 --> 01:55:59.669]  They could nuke a city.
[01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:03.391]  The globalists could, or any of these crime networks try to bring in martial law.
[01:56:03.951 --> 01:56:07.973]  They could have a huge collapse in Mexico and 20 million come across the border in one week.
[01:56:08.433 --> 01:56:09.794]  That could destabilize things.
[01:56:10.214 --> 01:56:11.875]  A world dollar devaluation.
[01:56:12.856 --> 01:56:19.319]  There's just so... It's like a cartoon where the character has a hundred plates in his hand and he's trying to balance them.
[01:56:19.379 --> 01:56:20.399]  You know they're coming down.
[01:56:20.759 --> 01:56:21.920]  Every economist says that.
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.301]  The question is, how bad will it be?
[01:56:24.401 --> 01:56:25.942]  We're trying to get people prepared.
[01:56:26.622 --> 01:56:28.003]  The elites are all getting prepared.
[01:56:28.063 --> 01:56:29.504]  The rich people are all getting prepared.
[01:56:29.884 --> 01:56:30.845]  I was just talking about that.
[01:56:31.165 --> 01:56:38.869]  All these rich people, I either know or know folks that know, have been building underground bunkers and have armed guards and are moving out to the countryside.
[01:56:38.889 --> 01:56:39.910]  I mean, that's been in the news.
[01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:42.511]  Or moving, you know, to islands in the middle of nowhere.
[01:56:42.931 --> 01:56:43.892]  What do they know?
[01:56:44.232 --> 01:56:47.874]  Steve Quayle, to try to answer his question, what do people do to get ready?
[01:56:48.462 --> 01:56:50.763]  First thing is, you said it, get right with God.
[01:56:50.843 --> 01:56:52.043]  Second thing is, pray.
[01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:52.764]  And I mean this.
[01:56:53.344 --> 01:56:55.865]  Pray for the right people to come across your path.
[01:56:55.965 --> 01:56:57.746]  No man has an island done to himself.
[01:56:58.166 --> 01:57:02.808]  Look, I was one of the founders of the PrEP movement almost 30 years ago, and I can tell you this.
[01:57:02.848 --> 01:57:11.591]  So many people have come into my life and gone, saying they believe in preparation, only to basically, you know, either betray or stab me in the back, whatever.
[01:57:11.631 --> 01:57:12.231]  But pray.
[01:57:12.591 --> 01:57:13.952]  And here's my answer to this.
[01:57:14.512 --> 01:57:21.296]  God will give you better friends than you'd ever choose for yourself if you'll seek Him first, not after the fact.
[01:57:21.336 --> 01:57:22.577]  Same thing for spouses.
[01:57:22.997 --> 01:57:28.480]  Second thing that people have got to do is they have got to get the mindset that it doesn't get better.
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:32.802]  They are preparing, in essence, for the total siege.
[01:57:33.062 --> 01:57:34.083]  Look at Argentina.
[01:57:34.123 --> 01:57:35.824]  Look at the history of the world.
[01:57:35.844 --> 01:57:37.465]  Look at the siege of Stalingrad.
[01:57:37.945 --> 01:57:39.727]  Start getting realistic.
[01:57:40.287 --> 01:57:45.332]  You know, I'll tell you this Alex, if someone, and I'm not picking on the caller, this is the best advice I can give.
[01:57:45.752 --> 01:57:49.296]  If you have to ask that question, you haven't done your homework.
[01:57:49.356 --> 01:57:50.797]  First thing though, get right with God.
[01:57:51.378 --> 01:57:58.144]  Second thing, pray, and pray and make it a matter of your chief input to find like-minded individuals.
[01:57:58.976 --> 01:58:02.097]  Well, and it's good to seek, because I can talk the talk.
[01:58:02.157 --> 01:58:10.020]  I'm so busy fighting tyranny, I've not gotten as ready as I like to, and I offensively try to fight the globalists to affect the future battle space, to change things.
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:23.605]  But the reason we all prepare is when you realize how evil the globalists are, and they're in control, and all their documents say they want to make you totally bankrupt, and bring in a global depression, to bring in a global government, we don't know the hour or the time of that.
[01:58:24.085 --> 01:58:29.307]  But every indicator is they're accelerating their timetable to meet that.
[01:58:30.107 --> 01:58:30.887]  They're behind.
[01:58:31.487 --> 01:58:31.827]  Steve?
[01:58:32.327 --> 01:58:33.528]  Yeah, I think this is critical.
[01:58:33.948 --> 01:58:40.290]  The most important thing I would tell everybody, you know, that visits my site in real time, I put up the alert section.
[01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:41.910]  It's over on the right-hand side of my page.
[01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:46.471]  Alex, the reports coming in from people in the food processing business... I want to hear this.
[01:58:46.491 --> 01:58:46.852]  Stay there.
[01:58:46.872 --> 01:58:47.492]  Thank you, caller.

[02:00:27.226 --> 02:00:31.327]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.127 --> 02:00:38.768]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, I'm going to break something down that I think is really central and really important, and I'm going to give Steve Quell's take on it.
[02:00:39.209 --> 02:00:40.629]  Right now, let's continue with your calls.
[02:00:41.963 --> 02:00:43.483]  Let's talk to Steve in Ohio.
[02:00:43.523 --> 02:00:44.303]  Thanks for holding, Steve.
[02:00:44.343 --> 02:00:45.364]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:00:46.784 --> 02:00:47.004]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:47.064 --> 02:00:47.824]  How's it going?
[02:00:48.064 --> 02:00:48.484]  Good, brother.
[02:00:49.825 --> 02:01:06.728]  Hey, as far as my take on what the globalist agenda is, I would go as far as to say that, you know, they are going to attack the Tea Party members, but also true patriots like me, yourself, veterans, and Oath Keepers alike.
[02:01:07.928 --> 02:01:10.669]  And if that doesn't work, then I believe that they'll go to a
[02:01:12.364 --> 02:01:13.805]  I think that's a great point.
[02:01:13.825 --> 02:01:16.707]  Steve Quayle, your take on that.
[02:01:16.727 --> 02:01:17.127]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:01:32.691 --> 02:01:40.875]  Well, I think he's really right, and I think the thing that most people don't realize, Alex, you and I did a whole show, I think the last show we did on the Diegel Report.
[02:01:41.375 --> 02:01:49.420]  The way you take out 200 million people, first of all, is you're going to take them out by starving them into the FEMA camps and then killing them once they get there.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:54.542]  And that's what Mao Zedong did, and David Rockefeller helped organize it, wrote an article for the New York Times about it.
[02:01:55.002 --> 02:01:57.184]  He's very proud of the 80 million plus they killed.
[02:01:57.564 --> 02:01:59.625]  That's what Lenin and Stalin did.
[02:01:59.985 --> 02:02:01.606]  This is the globalist program.
[02:02:02.677 --> 02:02:03.177]  Let's get started, Alex.
[02:02:03.217 --> 02:02:03.758]  That's the thing.
[02:02:03.778 --> 02:02:04.859]  Let me get to the food thing.
[02:02:05.219 --> 02:02:31.559]  If you just said, Steve, what's the most important thing you know at this minute, which you're basically asking me, is I have people in the food production business, the biggest food producers, emailing me, calling me, saying, we just got the biggest orders in the history of our company in MREs, bigger than anything that was put forth by the government, and they're all going, their words, not mine, into underground caves and bunkers.
[02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:32.599]  We're good to go.
[02:02:56.561 --> 02:02:57.321]  We're good to go.
[02:03:26.562 --> 02:03:28.203]  We're good to go.
[02:03:46.889 --> 02:03:48.150]  We're good to go.
[02:03:58.706 --> 02:04:00.447]  That's a true story, I can tell you his name.
[02:04:00.807 --> 02:04:04.189]  The point being, is it's starting to happen now.
[02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:07.910]  And this is the, you just ran through the historic litany of it.
[02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:10.611]  What happens when food disappears?
[02:04:10.972 --> 02:04:14.893]  Well, the next thing that, when food disappears, nutrition gets hit.
[02:04:14.933 --> 02:04:18.535]  That's why people should be buying every nutritional support product they can get.
[02:04:18.815 --> 02:04:20.916]  That's not a pitch, it's advice.
[02:04:21.336 --> 02:04:23.637]  Your calories are going to be cut.
[02:04:23.918 --> 02:04:26.799]  The nutritional goodness of what you used to be able to eat,
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:33.983]  I was about to say, I go to restaurants I've gone to for years, and now it's not real meat anymore.
[02:04:36.325 --> 02:04:39.907]  They admit meat prices are all-time highs, other things are all-time highs.
[02:04:40.327 --> 02:04:43.429]  At the same time, energy prices are going down to bankrupt Russia.
[02:04:43.769 --> 02:04:46.971]  I want to talk about that with you straight ahead, Steve Quayle.
[02:04:48.826 --> 02:04:49.626]  I'm gonna break something down.
[02:04:49.686 --> 02:04:50.967]  Really important when we come back.
[02:04:51.467 --> 02:04:53.447]  So, please listen up and stay there.
[02:04:53.887 --> 02:04:55.748]  And we're also gonna go to John in New York.
[02:04:56.628 --> 02:04:58.369]  We're gonna go to Jerry in Georgia.
[02:04:58.589 --> 02:05:00.409]  Margaret in Oklahoma.
[02:05:00.529 --> 02:05:01.849]  Lori in California.
[02:05:01.970 --> 02:05:03.510]  Linda in New York and others.

[02:05:17.222 --> 02:05:18.683]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:19.003 --> 02:05:26.587]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:06:58.753 --> 02:07:03.236]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:07:03.516 --> 02:07:04.857]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:07:04.897 --> 02:07:05.618]  You can feel it.
[02:07:08.419 --> 02:07:15.380]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:08:31.276 --> 02:08:32.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.857 --> 02:08:34.598]  See the generals in their masses.
[02:08:35.038 --> 02:08:37.479]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[02:08:38.059 --> 02:08:40.420]  Just like witches at black masses.
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:44.822]  Just like witches at black masses.
[02:08:45.002 --> 02:08:45.663]  Evil minds.
[02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:48.131]  Sorcerers of death's construction.
[02:08:48.151 --> 02:08:48.772]  In the fields.
[02:08:48.792 --> 02:08:50.033]  As the war machine keeps turning.
[02:08:50.113 --> 02:08:52.475]  Death and hatred to mankind.
[02:09:08.613 --> 02:09:15.542]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds!
[02:09:15.922 --> 02:09:25.394]  I think that says it all, ladies and gentlemen, on this Tuesday, December 23rd, 2014, worldwide broadcast.
[02:09:25.674 --> 02:09:27.176]  We'll be back live tomorrow.
[02:09:27.276 --> 02:09:27.776]  Lord willing.
[02:09:28.417 --> 02:09:50.673]  And back Friday live, we have a special rebroadcast with Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, and then William Binney, that incredible interview a month ago, where the former head of a major NSA department, number four in the overall organization, spilt his guts about the tyranny of the all-seeing panopticon system they're attempting to construct to control civilization.
[02:09:52.515 --> 02:09:54.717]  and to set us upon the path to tyranny.
[02:09:55.218 --> 02:10:00.603]  There are the forces of good and evil in this world.
[02:10:03.646 --> 02:10:06.769]  I know everybody knows that, but there's not just evil operating.
[02:10:07.509 --> 02:10:17.379]  But if good people will not recognize that there are bad people trying to get full control, trying to set up a planetary government, so there are no nations or peoples to block it,
[02:10:19.332 --> 02:10:24.095]  And that it is a worldwide unified program of bad will towards humanity.
[02:10:24.615 --> 02:10:25.516]  For total control.
[02:10:26.196 --> 02:10:27.137]  We don't have a hope or a prayer.
[02:10:29.058 --> 02:10:31.579]  Conversely, if we can be played off against each other, we don't have a prayer.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:44.327]  So when I get up here and sometimes give you worst case scenarios, it's because I'm tuning into, from research, the wish list of the technocrats and what they'd like to do.
[02:10:46.067 --> 02:10:48.808]  I have read hundreds of books written by the technocrats.
[02:10:48.828 --> 02:10:49.908]  We've quoted them here.
[02:10:50.268 --> 02:10:51.048]  We've sourced them.
[02:10:51.408 --> 02:10:53.909]  We've sourced three or four or five or more today.
[02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:57.269]  We've shown the quotes on screen for TV viewers.
[02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:59.310]  We've plugged them for radio listeners.
[02:10:59.710 --> 02:11:01.210]  So you can go check it out for yourself.
[02:11:01.710 --> 02:11:09.532]  There are people, if you study the Jacobin French Revolution, that was the opposite of ours, an Illuminati revolution, I mean, that's in the history books.
[02:11:11.257 --> 02:11:27.109]  That wanted to change the work week to nine days out of ten, wanted to change the calendar, abolish the family, and wanted to make basically devil worship the state religion, where they would be kings over a new hell world.
[02:11:29.991 --> 02:11:34.154]  These are crazy people, but they hunger for the power and the control.
[02:11:34.194 --> 02:11:38.978]  So when we get up here and break down what the globalists are doing and point out how bad it could get,
[02:11:40.635 --> 02:11:43.677]  It's because we're hoping to shake people out of their slumber.
[02:11:44.437 --> 02:11:49.320]  We're showing you a possible reality, a possible future, and one that's becoming more probable.
[02:11:50.841 --> 02:11:52.822]  Certainly, much of it is now unfolding.
[02:11:53.423 --> 02:11:58.606]  When we beat something, when you beat something, when we fight it together, then they say, oh, it never happened.
[02:11:58.966 --> 02:12:00.767]  But you notice a lot of it does end up happening.
[02:12:02.688 --> 02:12:05.010]  It is a mathematical fact that the economy will.
[02:12:07.088 --> 02:12:08.369]  Implode, one way or another.
[02:12:08.429 --> 02:12:10.449]  It's designed to, and the globalists admit that.
[02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:21.013]  But they tell the public, oh, it's just the greatest GDP ever, Dow's up 18,000, not telling us because fiat dollars are following it, not telling us because it's full of derivatives.
[02:12:21.033 --> 02:12:24.294]  It's full of fraud.
[02:12:24.314 --> 02:12:29.116]  And they get the public to buy into the fraud, believing it'll sure up your pension fund.
[02:12:29.296 --> 02:12:36.159]  They're getting ready to start taking the private pension funds to, quote, sure up the stock market, and get you to go along with it, because, oh, well, that'll secure the fraud.
[02:12:37.298 --> 02:12:41.761]  But really it won't, because areas like Greece and Spain are a few years ahead of us.
[02:12:42.162 --> 02:12:44.884]  It was designed to impoverish you.
[02:12:45.184 --> 02:12:48.747]  Steve, I want to go back to calls and break down a lot.
[02:12:51.028 --> 02:12:59.275]  I want to get into all this, but what I'm trying to get at here is the enemy's greatest tool.
[02:12:59.315 --> 02:13:02.857]  I forget who said the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:13:04.078 --> 02:13:05.539]  The globalist's greatest trick is
[02:13:06.638 --> 02:13:07.779]  Deny that stuff exists.
[02:13:07.819 --> 02:13:09.560]  Now they admit it exists but say it's good.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:19.745]  And then get people in a normalcy bias or mass Stockholm Syndrome or learned helplessness to just not believe the magnitude of what's happening.
[02:13:19.765 --> 02:13:25.188]  And the reason I've been successful and you've been successful is that we're really showing people where this road leads.
[02:13:25.488 --> 02:13:32.772]  We've been so insulated in this country from 40-something million just in Europe being killed in World War II.
[02:13:32.792 --> 02:13:33.713]  20-plus million Russians.
[02:13:33.733 --> 02:13:35.394]  20-plus million Germans.
[02:13:37.196 --> 02:13:42.258]  We are so... Most people are dead who live in the Great Depression.
[02:13:42.958 --> 02:13:55.862]  In this country, that was easy compared to other nations, where upwards of 50 million people were homeless and where 7 million people major universities believe died of malnutrition in association with starvation.
[02:13:56.382 --> 02:13:59.703]  That was when 90% lived in rural areas, most of them self-sufficient.
[02:13:59.943 --> 02:14:00.384]  Now we're 90% urban.
[02:14:02.731 --> 02:14:07.576]  Less than half of those, ten percent or about five, are self-sufficient.
[02:14:08.177 --> 02:14:14.504]  And then the great crime in the homeland security is being self-sufficient as government stockpiles food and weapons.
[02:14:14.924 --> 02:14:18.008]  Steve Quill, I want to go back to calls, but getting into this.
[02:14:18.028 --> 02:14:21.592]  Because you said something that's really critical.
[02:14:22.296 --> 02:14:36.904]  The people have got to understand that all the news right now, they're already being conditioned to accept the fact that, number one, robots are, and the whole thing with singularity and robots and everything, is designed to replace them, okay?
[02:14:37.765 --> 02:14:41.547]  I just have questions coming in on the email, well what does that mean about jobs in 2025?
[02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:42.968]  You'll be dead by 2025.
[02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:43.508]  No one's putting
[02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:57.673]  I mean, maybe you've dealt with it, but no one's putting the linkage between all of the artificial intelligence, everything that's breaking on neuroscience, everything that's breaking on the technology minority report.
[02:14:58.093 --> 02:14:58.974]  Guess what, people?
[02:14:59.034 --> 02:15:04.235]  That's exactly why the Deagle denials are irrelevant.
[02:15:04.255 --> 02:15:09.957]  That's why the RAND Corporation is behind basically telling the elite how it's going to play out.
[02:15:09.977 --> 02:15:11.258]  So I want to say one thing, Alex.
[02:15:11.838 --> 02:15:12.299]  We're good to go.
[02:15:26.816 --> 02:15:39.163]  I hate humanity because they're Luciferians, and the whole idea of creating artificially intelligent machines or artilects is to get rid of human beings.
[02:15:39.263 --> 02:15:48.648]  And in my book, I've got to say this, the most important thing I've ever written, if you've ever read anything I've written, my book Xenogenesis is so critical.
[02:15:48.728 --> 02:15:54.811]  And it's changing people, because Alex, again, you've given puzzle pieces, I've given puzzle pieces.
[02:15:55.751 --> 02:16:04.794]  And the puzzle pieces, when people finally see all the pieces fitting together, that's when they start to take note, and that's when they'll start to take action.
[02:16:05.094 --> 02:16:20.378]  And I'm telling everybody, the puzzle pieces are all together now, and that's why when we're talking about 90% extermination of the human race, that's why when we're talking about the Georgia Guidestones, look, the Georgia Guidestones is nothing more than a granite writ of execution.
[02:16:20.538 --> 02:16:25.461]  And by the way, I want to be clear here, and then go to some phone calls, but at the bottom of the hour, let's get into the robot takeover.
[02:16:25.921 --> 02:16:30.684]  We can show all the new articles admitting they've already made the decision to get rid of humans.
[02:16:30.724 --> 02:16:31.885]  We're not just obsolete.
[02:16:31.925 --> 02:16:33.526]  We're now dead weight.
[02:16:34.026 --> 02:16:35.067]  It's not us.
[02:16:35.147 --> 02:16:36.068]  It's Bill Joy.
[02:16:36.308 --> 02:16:38.309]  It is Ray Kurzweil.
[02:16:38.409 --> 02:16:39.350]  It's the UN.
[02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:42.412]  The decision has been made to get rid of us.
[02:16:43.433 --> 02:16:51.062]  And even Fortune Magazine and the London Telegraph now have headlines like I put in the film Endgame seven years ago.
[02:16:51.082 --> 02:16:57.329]  The elite have decided to kill us because they're going to merge with machines and live forever.
[02:16:57.349 --> 02:17:00.974]  Meanwhile, Stephen Hawking warns the plan is to get rid of us.
[02:17:01.474 --> 02:17:04.496]  So folks, what we're telling you is not our opinion.
[02:17:04.576 --> 02:17:26.152]  The elite that are almost in control of the planet right now, they're in control of most of it, openly say their plan is to put a high-tech grid and a spy on us, have robots replace us at all the factories where robots work on robots so there's no escape, then they're going to start releasing mega-plagues, then they're going to turn the robots loose to hunt us down.
[02:17:26.832 --> 02:17:28.433]  And this is not Terminator, folks.
[02:17:28.513 --> 02:17:29.814]  This is their real plan.
[02:17:30.335 --> 02:17:31.555]  Now, this is insane.
[02:17:31.936 --> 02:17:35.999]  If I wrote a book about my plan, this is hypothetical, to say...
[02:17:37.364 --> 02:17:39.425]  Attack FBI headquarters, which I would never do.
[02:17:39.485 --> 02:17:40.285]  Wish no harm upon them.
[02:17:40.625 --> 02:17:41.545]  Just to people like us.
[02:17:42.106 --> 02:17:47.167]  I would expect to be investigated and probably arrested if I wrote a serious book about my plan to do it.
[02:17:47.428 --> 02:17:55.130]  The globalists have all written treatises and are talking about their plan and we're watching it all unfold!
[02:17:55.410 --> 02:17:56.671]  That's what we're telling you!
[02:17:56.691 --> 02:18:02.133]  So we're trying to shake you out of your trance.
[02:18:02.593 --> 02:18:04.814]  We're trying to break the literal spell.
[02:18:05.354 --> 02:18:05.914]  Steve Quayle.
[02:18:06.681 --> 02:18:11.306]  Well, and thank you, Alex, because I don't think I can be any more impassioned than you're pleased.
[02:18:11.826 --> 02:18:17.152]  I can tell you point blank that when people finally get this, and you mentioned Bill Joy.
[02:18:17.652 --> 02:18:24.459]  For the record, I think you can listen to my broadcast, when he first came out with that treatise, it's called, Why the World Doesn't Need Us Anymore.
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:30.145]  And the point is, is that he was the head of Sun Microsystems, probably the most important
[02:18:31.391 --> 02:18:31.951]  We're good to go.
[02:18:57.461 --> 02:19:01.685]  It's a technoform of birth control.
[02:19:01.705 --> 02:19:04.768]  So, ladies and gentlemen, you can get my book Xenogenesis on my website.
[02:19:05.068 --> 02:19:06.429]  It's that important, Alex.
[02:19:07.350 --> 02:19:15.057]  That is the, if you will, cumulative effect of 24 years of writing and it's only available on my website.
[02:19:15.077 --> 02:19:17.039]  So, please, it's that critical.
[02:19:17.399 --> 02:19:20.963]  Alex, if people cannot recognize that,
[02:19:21.643 --> 02:19:24.944]  Everything else fails in comparison.
[02:19:25.304 --> 02:19:29.325]  And they're ready to initiate that now, the super soldier program.
[02:19:29.745 --> 02:19:31.405]  I did a whole show on that years ago.
[02:19:31.445 --> 02:19:32.486]  They now admit it all.
[02:19:32.666 --> 02:19:34.126]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:19:34.686 --> 02:19:39.988]  We're going to talk more about this coming up because I want to go to John and Jerry and Margaret that have been holding the longest.
[02:19:40.048 --> 02:19:43.968]  John in New York, what do you see coming up in 2015 or any questions for Steve Quayle?
[02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:49.773]  Hi, I really appreciate your show.
[02:19:49.833 --> 02:19:56.678]  It's wonderful, but obviously, as Steve Quayle said, you know, we have to be sober and realize that, you know, info isn't always enough, especially at this point.
[02:19:57.318 --> 02:20:00.020]  And Nona Collard pointed that out, the importance of spirituality.
[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:12.788]  And I just... I wanted to... I was trying to call yesterday about the police, but a good childhood friend of mine, who's a journalist, posted this about the
[02:20:13.831 --> 02:20:18.872]  Especially in Cleveland, where the Union defended these cops they were trying to fire.
[02:20:19.092 --> 02:20:23.053]  The National Federal Union defended these cops they were trying to fire.
[02:20:23.073 --> 02:20:27.815]  Then when they keep doing bad things, who gets in trouble is the local precinct.
[02:20:28.595 --> 02:20:33.136]  And so I think that's the problem, the systemic problem, that something's got to change there.
[02:20:34.935 --> 02:20:38.118]  Yeah, I want to get Steve Quill's take on that, because I've broken down how I see it.
[02:20:38.158 --> 02:20:39.379]  We know it's divide and conquer.
[02:20:39.719 --> 02:20:46.685]  Obviously the police are doing a lot of bad stuff, but when you see mainstream media pushing a war on police, what is the dialectic there?
[02:20:46.726 --> 02:20:48.127]  What's the master plan in that?
[02:20:50.174 --> 02:20:51.155]  I don't think so.
[02:21:05.251 --> 02:21:06.192]  We're good to go.
[02:21:32.265 --> 02:21:32.886]  We're good to go.
[02:21:56.547 --> 02:22:23.372]  I've been contacted a lot by some of the big factories that produce the armored cars down in San Antonio that look like Suburbans, look like normal trucks, is that the elites have been buying them like hotcakes.
[02:22:23.793 --> 02:22:25.633]  Again, what is all that about, Steve Quayle?
[02:22:26.386 --> 02:22:45.769]  Well, first of all, the idea, and by the way, I have a long-standing relationship with Texas Armoring, and you know, I've been buying their stuff and brokering their vehicles for a long time, but you'll see them on TV all the time, but the reason that it's expanding and increasing
[02:22:46.449 --> 02:22:50.353]  Is high-value targets are going to be caught in the city.
[02:22:50.413 --> 02:22:52.695]  We watched Ferguson explode before our eyes.
[02:22:52.735 --> 02:22:58.420]  And for the record, a normal automobile provides no protection against, you know, a firearm.
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:22:59.361]  Same thing.
[02:22:59.461 --> 02:23:00.041]  Look at this.
[02:23:00.121 --> 02:23:05.426]  It's being proposed that body armor be illegal to the citizens, just like firearms.
[02:23:05.826 --> 02:23:12.532]  Well, I don't know what everyone else's red line is, but you've got to know, if they want the guns that bad, ask yourself a simple question.
[02:23:12.552 --> 02:23:14.093]  Fast and furious, yes.
[02:23:14.453 --> 02:23:16.275]  Second Amendment rights, no.
[02:23:17.036 --> 02:23:19.398]  Ask yourself this, who's funding the gangs?
[02:23:19.618 --> 02:23:23.982]  Ask yourself, who's providing them with heavy weaponry?
[02:23:24.022 --> 02:23:24.682]  That's a mouthful.
[02:23:25.002 --> 02:23:28.966]  The point being, Alex, is not only is civil war planned,
[02:23:29.386 --> 02:23:38.771]  Not only is Civil War funded, not only are there foreign troops in here to mop up, quote, the patriots, whatever they want to call, but this is all being done on an accelerated basis.
[02:23:39.111 --> 02:23:45.334]  I see the current state of police assassinations as the key point.
[02:23:45.374 --> 02:23:48.456]  And by the way, you have a lot of law enforcement officers who listen to you.
[02:23:48.556 --> 02:23:49.076]  I do too.
[02:23:49.596 --> 02:23:52.758]  I remember telling them four years ago, be careful.
[02:23:52.838 --> 02:23:58.301]  There are traitors in our government that are making known where you guys work.
[02:23:58.781 --> 02:23:59.482]  We're good to go.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:19.361]  Well obviously, if there's a globalist criminal takeover, they're going to go after everybody who's good.
[02:24:19.661 --> 02:24:20.882]  And they're keeping tabs on everybody.
[02:24:20.902 --> 02:24:21.722]  They know who's moral.
[02:24:22.042 --> 02:24:23.142]  They know who won't play ball.
[02:24:23.643 --> 02:24:29.324]  But then, first they'll take them out, then they'll take out the group that helped take them out, and then they'll consolidate power.
[02:24:29.384 --> 02:24:30.544]  This always is done.
[02:24:30.985 --> 02:24:32.425]  And Steve, give me your take on this.
[02:24:32.545 --> 02:24:43.068]  Why historically, whether it's the Soviets, or the Chai Koms, or the Nazis, or any other tyranny throughout history, they always take out the good guys first, in the government,
[02:24:43.228 --> 02:24:45.229]  Then they take out those that took them out.
[02:24:46.149 --> 02:24:56.052]  Well it's easy because first of all they take out the good guys because even Jesus said we're the salt of the world and the light of the world, the salt of the earth and the light of the world, so they want Christians.
[02:24:56.072 --> 02:25:04.774]  Now look Alex, and this is critical, Christians are being murdered by the millions worldwide and not one word from the White House.
[02:25:05.354 --> 02:25:10.538]  And I'm saying this, listen, the plan of the globalists is to pit everybody against everybody.
[02:25:10.899 --> 02:25:14.581]  I get people saying, well, World War III and Albert Pike's vision isn't true.
[02:25:14.622 --> 02:25:17.424]  Well, if it isn't true, somebody thought it was true because they're following that plan.
[02:25:17.684 --> 02:25:21.887]  Just, ladies and gentlemen, do an internet search for Albert Pike, World War III.
[02:25:22.027 --> 02:25:23.148]  It'll give you the whole background.
[02:25:23.469 --> 02:25:27.672]  The point is... Well, I'll tell you what, let's get into that in the next segment, because that's something important to talk about as well.
[02:25:27.992 --> 02:25:28.893]  Right, but let's just say this.
[02:25:29.113 --> 02:25:42.320]  The reason they take out the facilitators is because they know that those people betrayed the very people that basically funded them, and they don't want the betrayal carrying through to the new government.
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:42.880]  Make sense?
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.703]  They know anybody who's a traitor will also at some point probably turn against them.
[02:25:48.043 --> 02:25:50.164]  That's the reason they kill the second group.
[02:25:51.425 --> 02:25:52.185]  With a vengeance.
[02:25:53.165 --> 02:25:54.026]  With a vengeance.
[02:25:54.867 --> 02:25:58.129]  The second round of killing is always bigger than the first.
[02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:59.210]  Absolutely.
[02:25:59.270 --> 02:26:00.832]  Once the blood starts, it doesn't stop.
[02:26:01.632 --> 02:26:04.694]  You know, and unfortunately, the blood is going to flow.
[02:26:05.135 --> 02:26:06.075]  And just look at this.
[02:26:06.476 --> 02:26:09.878]  Look at all of... This was never a problem.
[02:26:10.519 --> 02:26:13.481]  At least, you know, the terrorists supposedly coming in the country.
[02:26:13.901 --> 02:26:21.227]  Now you have the vilification of good, and you have the verification of that which is bad.
[02:26:21.707 --> 02:26:24.069]  You know, the mainstream media... I want to say this.
[02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:27.030]  Anybody that listens to them is under the mind control.
[02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:36.894]  It's just like, by the way, scopalamine, one of the drugs that's called devil's breath, along with zombie dust, which is the burundinga or burundanga, you know, a chemical.
[02:26:37.294 --> 02:26:46.398]  These things are real, and I'm beginning to think, Alex, that there's more of the chemicals, the mind-altering, psychotropic,
[02:26:46.758 --> 02:26:47.559]  We're good to go.
[02:27:10.501 --> 02:27:13.482]  Well, we know there's geoengineering going on big time.
[02:27:13.522 --> 02:27:14.462]  Let's take a phone call.
[02:27:14.742 --> 02:27:16.163]  Jerry in Georgia, thanks for holding.
[02:27:16.203 --> 02:27:16.763]  You're a trooper.
[02:27:17.043 --> 02:27:18.083]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:27:19.124 --> 02:27:19.784]  Hi, Alex.
[02:27:20.524 --> 02:27:26.746]  Both you and your guest have talked about how they brag about what they're going to do to us before they do it with predictive programming.
[02:27:26.846 --> 02:27:27.106]  Yes.
[02:27:27.566 --> 02:27:30.447]  And I think that we'll see what's going to happen.
[02:27:30.867 --> 02:27:37.809]  Just like last Thursday night on Elementary on CBS, a man walked up to a police car and shot a cop dead.
[02:27:38.610 --> 02:27:40.954]  And then two days later it happens in New York City.
[02:27:41.154 --> 02:27:44.098]  Well yeah, that's what I call basic mind control.
[02:27:44.378 --> 02:27:51.449]  They hype that enough and just show it on TV, mentally ill people will go out highly suggestible and do it on their own.
[02:27:52.608 --> 02:28:04.815]  Absolutely, and they're going to show us what they have coming down the pike and it'll be right in front of us if we watch, if we start seeing enough prime time shows showing.
[02:28:05.095 --> 02:28:11.919]  Well you notice almost every cop show, adventure show, whatever, has patriots nuking cities or blowing things up.
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.241]  They're getting everybody ready so when it happens
[02:28:14.741 --> 02:28:15.902]  Because it wasn't happening before.
[02:28:15.962 --> 02:28:19.984]  People go, oh yeah, that seems right because we've already been pre-demonized.
[02:28:20.284 --> 02:28:23.386]  That shows their pre-preparation targeting.
[02:28:24.227 --> 02:28:28.509]  They laze you with propaganda first before they drop real bombs on you.
[02:28:28.909 --> 02:28:30.010]  And that's what I see happening.
[02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:33.472]  I want the caller to be able to finish up, but Steve Quayle, your take on predictive programming.
[02:28:34.238 --> 02:28:36.700]  Well, it's not only predictive programming, okay?
[02:28:37.161 --> 02:28:47.030]  It's basically rubbing your nose, my nose, our noses, in the very fact that they are mocking us, that we're not even bright enough.
[02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:49.753]  Remember, the elite believes they're elite in the intellectual process.
[02:28:50.606 --> 02:28:52.928]  It's lesser magic in their own words.
[02:28:53.248 --> 02:28:56.090]  They need to manifest it as a model first in front of us.
[02:28:56.390 --> 02:29:00.773]  It's a metaphysical rule as well that it's like counting coup.
[02:29:01.073 --> 02:29:06.297]  Like a Native American would mock kill you two or three times in combat before they actually killed you.
[02:29:06.577 --> 02:29:13.022]  They believe it adds to the mojo to symbolically do it before they actually do it.
[02:29:13.945 --> 02:29:18.686]  Absolutely, and again, it gets back, it's truly called ritual magic, okay?
[02:29:19.146 --> 02:29:30.630]  And the reason it's ritual magic is, and I actually believe this, you know, and Alex, the reason I go to the Bible when, for instance, in the book of Hosea, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:32.930]  God doesn't want his people destroyed.
[02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:37.351]  The whole basis of prophecy is telling you what's going to be, you know, coming in the future.
[02:29:37.411 --> 02:29:38.792]  It's a warning!
[02:29:38.812 --> 02:29:39.592]  You're given the blueprint!
[02:29:40.185 --> 02:29:41.005]  You're given the blueprint.
[02:29:41.365 --> 02:29:47.647]  And so the thing is, is that ladies and gentlemen, when they lay it out, when people say, what can they do?
[02:29:48.108 --> 02:29:49.188]  Notice this.
[02:29:49.208 --> 02:29:49.588]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.628 --> 02:29:49.908]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.928 --> 02:29:50.448]  We got a break.
[02:29:50.808 --> 02:29:52.009]  We'll come right back to you, Stephen.
[02:29:52.049 --> 02:29:52.749]  Let Jerry finish.
[02:29:52.769 --> 02:29:56.310]  Then we'll go to everybody else that's patiently holding.
[02:29:56.830 --> 02:29:57.771]  So stay with us.
[02:29:58.431 --> 02:29:59.331]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:01.412]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.352 --> 02:30:05.033]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.255 --> 02:30:20.408]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
[02:30:20.628 --> 02:30:28.597]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed.
[02:30:28.797 --> 02:30:34.402]  Over the last two years, and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:30:34.842 --> 02:30:37.705]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:30:37.945 --> 02:30:39.146]  No needles, no injections.
[02:30:39.366 --> 02:30:43.410]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[02:30:43.690 --> 02:30:48.554]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12.
[02:30:49.375 --> 02:30:52.499]  Bringing you a true nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.
[02:30:53.319 --> 02:30:53.980]  Secret 12.
[02:30:54.401 --> 02:30:59.626]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift and is tailor-made to boost your New Year's resolutions.
[02:31:00.047 --> 02:31:02.129]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:31:10.049 --> 02:31:15.231]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[02:31:15.551 --> 02:31:18.353]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[02:31:18.873 --> 02:31:21.674]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:31:21.934 --> 02:31:27.476]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.
[02:31:28.137 --> 02:31:30.117]  Another thing we are celebrating is you.
[02:31:30.578 --> 02:31:35.820]  Without the valued listeners of Alex Jones and our loyal customers, we wouldn't be here today.
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:39.241]  We offer a wonderful online shopping experience.

[02:32:00.897 --> 02:32:06.505]  Thanks for believing in our dream, the original 100% American-made Diamond Gusset jean.
[02:32:09.390 --> 02:32:16.476]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[02:32:16.716 --> 02:32:20.519]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[02:32:20.659 --> 02:32:26.764]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[02:32:27.124 --> 02:32:32.929]  Using super oxygenation, OxyPowder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body.
[02:32:33.089 --> 02:32:35.010]  While you sleep with easy capsules.
[02:32:35.350 --> 02:32:41.034]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy-Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[02:32:41.434 --> 02:32:46.737]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Doo has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[02:32:47.057 --> 02:32:49.419]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[02:32:49.579 --> 02:32:50.720]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:52.021]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[02:32:52.201 --> 02:32:52.661]  Seven days.
[02:32:53.201 --> 02:32:54.822]  2015 can be different.
[02:32:54.942 --> 02:32:57.904]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[02:32:58.164 --> 02:32:59.965]  Oxy Powder flushes it out.
[02:33:00.365 --> 02:33:03.086]  Secure your Oxy Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:03.346 --> 02:33:05.207]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:33:17.714 --> 02:33:19.896]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:33:20.457 --> 02:33:22.799]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:35.252]  The devil hates humans because we are made in the image of God.
[02:33:35.492 --> 02:33:37.294]  Listen how beautiful those voices are.
[02:33:38.493 --> 02:33:44.378]  Let's listen to a few seconds of this and see why the beach wants to destroy humanity.
[02:33:57.659 --> 02:34:07.566]  There's no mountain high enough to stop me from trying to empower humanity and carry out
[02:34:24.668 --> 02:34:27.429]  All I can do to stand up for what's decent and honest.
[02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:36.494]  And that's not anything heroic, because signing on with the New World Order is like tying a millstone around your neck to quote Christ and throw yourself in the deepest ocean.
[02:34:36.814 --> 02:34:40.016]  A millstone's one of those giant stones they use to grind wheat with.
[02:34:40.036 --> 02:34:46.759]  It'd be better for you to do that than to hurt the innocents, to hurt the little children.
[02:34:48.069 --> 02:34:49.369]  The vaccines, all of it.
[02:34:49.389 --> 02:34:56.531]  This whole system is so evil, and through compartmentalization, most people who are not bad at heart are helping carry it out.
[02:34:57.291 --> 02:35:01.832]  So no matter how horrible the truth is, I'm going to give you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[02:35:03.072 --> 02:35:11.054]  And not because I'm a hero, and not because I'm perfect, but because I know how evil the globalists are.
[02:35:11.094 --> 02:35:15.675]  In other countries where they've got full control, it was even the New York Times two years ago, Paul Watson wrote about it.
[02:35:16.482 --> 02:35:17.463]  They send in U.N.
[02:35:17.503 --> 02:35:22.785]  troops into villages where people have been for a thousand years, because it's a U.N.
[02:35:22.826 --> 02:35:29.489]  carbon sink, and they're taking this land so they can mine over here, and they line them up and shoot them and burn down their houses.
[02:35:29.509 --> 02:35:33.551]  And then they have articles about, well, it's for the earth!
[02:35:34.592 --> 02:35:37.894]  See how it's just, oh yeah, we're just mowing villagers down, it's no big deal.
[02:35:39.261 --> 02:35:44.048]  But oh my gosh, the police are so racist, you know, let's have a war with them.
[02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:48.415]  And it's not that there isn't some bad stuff happening, it's that the system is choosing to do that.
[02:35:48.656 --> 02:35:50.659]  Obviously, it's a divide and conquer tactic.
[02:35:52.521 --> 02:35:54.302]  Obviously, it's a takeover program.
[02:35:55.003 --> 02:36:07.853]  And you can just see a classic communist destabilization program that I've historically researched all over the world 30, 40 times, and that I've seen on air in 20 years dozens of times.
[02:36:08.353 --> 02:36:10.455]  I mean, this is a shake-and-bake operation.
[02:36:11.576 --> 02:36:14.118]  Just like I know how to make box pancakes, folks.
[02:36:14.638 --> 02:36:16.679]  I can sit back and watch the globalists making this.
[02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:21.083]  I mean, this is a ABCD, EFG type deal.
[02:36:23.573 --> 02:36:27.815]  And I'm just sitting here with horror going, my gosh, we really were right.
[02:36:27.855 --> 02:36:28.956]  They really are doing it.
[02:36:30.076 --> 02:36:32.177]  They really are establishing planetary government.
[02:36:34.458 --> 02:36:42.362]  They really are opening the borders and saying our kids belong to the state and teaching 2 plus 2 equals 5 and saying we didn't build our businesses and geoengineering.
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:47.063]  I mean, Bill Gates is a supervillain beyond anything in a James Bond movie.
[02:36:47.703 --> 02:36:50.645]  He's involved in weather manipulation with hurricanes.
[02:36:50.665 --> 02:36:51.626]  That's mainstream news.
[02:36:52.166 --> 02:36:54.068]  He's got a fleet of aircraft messing with hurricanes.
[02:36:54.408 --> 02:36:55.809]  He's involved in chemtrailing.
[02:36:55.989 --> 02:36:57.831]  But what he's doing is classified.
[02:37:00.513 --> 02:37:03.215]  Warren Buffett, involved in every evil you can imagine.
[02:37:03.435 --> 02:37:05.957]  George Soros, involved in every evil you can imagine.
[02:37:06.537 --> 02:37:08.879]  The Rockefellers, involved in everything you can imagine.
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:10.961]  The Saudi
[02:37:12.188 --> 02:37:16.992]  Royal family, the British royal family, the Rothschilds, it's crazy!
[02:37:18.634 --> 02:37:21.536]  We're living in a science fiction dystopia.
[02:37:22.577 --> 02:37:24.799]  That they're billing as a utopia.
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:32.926]  And they have model cities where they allow some industry and some freedom, but only because people accept globalism, and then everyone looks to that.
[02:37:33.227 --> 02:37:34.268]  Austin's one of these cities.
[02:37:35.489 --> 02:37:39.052]  To then adopt all this so they'll be prosperous, but really it's like a bear trap.
[02:37:40.563 --> 02:37:41.383]  Steve Quayle's our guest.
[02:37:41.423 --> 02:37:46.744]  I want to go to Jerry and have him finish up, and then I want to get to all these callers that have been holding.
[02:37:47.104 --> 02:37:51.345]  Steve Quayle is our guest, but this is an epic time to be alive.
[02:37:51.745 --> 02:37:53.406]  Jerry, finish up your point.
[02:37:54.906 --> 02:37:55.246]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:55.306 --> 02:38:01.267]  I just wanted to say, if you watch what they put on TV, they're telling us what they've got coming.
[02:38:01.767 --> 02:38:07.808]  And in two weeks, they have a person of interest coming out where a computer virus crashes the stock market.
[02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:10.249]  How did they dovetail that?
[02:38:11.201 --> 02:38:17.786]  Filming months and months ago with what's going on today with the Sony hack and the stock market hitting record highs.
[02:38:17.806 --> 02:38:18.366]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:38:18.386 --> 02:38:20.288]  You already know what was going to happen.
[02:38:20.488 --> 02:38:25.131]  Most people get their news from entertainment, so that's where they put the programming.
[02:38:25.151 --> 02:38:25.831]  That's on record.
[02:38:25.871 --> 02:38:26.372]  Great point.
[02:38:26.832 --> 02:38:28.733]  Steve Quill, that brings up what I raised earlier.
[02:38:29.694 --> 02:38:31.095]  AP reports U.S.
[02:38:31.115 --> 02:38:35.199]  economy accelerates and helps lift down to 18,000 points.
[02:38:35.779 --> 02:38:41.243]  Derivatives in fiat dollars are what are inflating the stock market as the real economy dies.
[02:38:41.303 --> 02:38:42.905]  What's your view on the economy next year?
[02:38:43.482 --> 02:38:45.644]  Well, first of all, I think we're going to have a bank crash.
[02:38:45.684 --> 02:38:58.772]  I think the Sony hack, if people look at what's happened, the Sony hack for the first time, corporate bail has been broken and they're going to go after, and whoever is responsible is brilliant because they're going after the people that make up the corporation.
[02:38:58.792 --> 02:39:03.556]  A corporation is an artificial construct that basically protects everybody from liability.
[02:39:03.856 --> 02:39:09.400]  I think you're going to see, Alex, the takedown of some of the major global corporations this way.
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:10.760]  It's happening now.
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:13.101]  Listen, the targeting is changing.
[02:39:13.581 --> 02:39:15.282]  Some of these guys are going to be whacked.
[02:39:15.582 --> 02:39:26.925]  Just like the Grill Economist B stated, you know, back before I think there were 12 bankers and international financiers killed, murdered, assassinated, suicided.
[02:39:27.285 --> 02:39:28.745]  Now we're up to close to 40.
[02:39:28.805 --> 02:39:33.907]  But what I think people have got to recognize is that this Sony attack and hack
[02:39:34.247 --> 02:39:38.831]  And we're being told that our financial institutions are in great danger.
[02:39:38.871 --> 02:39:44.756]  We're being told that, yet people will keep their money in banks and non-interest bearing CDs.
[02:39:44.896 --> 02:39:45.977]  And again, look at this.
[02:39:46.277 --> 02:39:48.139]  Alex, I have talked to very wealthy people.
[02:39:48.559 --> 02:39:51.482]  In Montana, we have a place called the Yellowstone Club.
[02:39:51.802 --> 02:39:59.949]  The world's billionaires, the half of them that you just, or almost all of them that you just named, live up there or have one of their many houses around the world up there.
[02:40:00.229 --> 02:40:05.373]  So they don't live if Yellowstone is going to blow within 30 miles of Yellowstone.
[02:40:05.413 --> 02:40:06.333]  I'm just telling you that.
[02:40:06.834 --> 02:40:14.139]  But in all of this, the point being is that the cyber attack on the bank is coming.
[02:40:14.679 --> 02:40:17.181]  Now that it's been effective in Sony, see what's happened?
[02:40:17.561 --> 02:40:25.688]  They've already made the precedent that one of the biggest corporations in the world, the entertainment corporation of the world, is no longer safe.
[02:40:26.048 --> 02:40:30.692]  And everybody who's related to that corporation is no longer safe.
[02:40:31.032 --> 02:40:35.256]  I also believe that Hollywood has sown evil, and now they're going to reap the whirlwind.
[02:40:35.296 --> 02:40:36.957]  I think they're going to reap it.
[02:40:36.998 --> 02:40:38.399]  Now let's talk about the $18,000.
[02:40:38.459 --> 02:40:40.520]  For the record, $18,000 is 666.
[02:40:40.921 --> 02:40:44.484]  I believe the Illuminati has, at different times, they put
[02:40:44.904 --> 02:40:46.465]  We're good to go.
[02:41:08.493 --> 02:41:11.555]  You can't have a trillion dollars in student loans.
[02:41:11.615 --> 02:41:21.460]  You can't have these people unemployed and then be bringing in, you know, 18 million immigrants through the border and displacing people.
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:24.782]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have a job, you can't buy a house.
[02:41:25.062 --> 02:41:28.804]  You know where all the housing prices are, excuse me, all the housing sales are going?
[02:41:28.824 --> 02:41:31.665]  50 million people on food stamps and growing.
[02:41:31.745 --> 02:41:34.887]  Imagine soup lines with 50 million in them every day.
[02:41:35.734 --> 02:41:36.414]  It won't happen, Alex.
[02:41:36.434 --> 02:41:37.835]  They'll start to poison.
[02:41:37.895 --> 02:41:40.657]  One of the top military guys told me that the plan is deep.
[02:41:40.937 --> 02:41:48.762]  Do you remember years ago, right after 9-11, this is critical, that they were really concerned with spray planes?
[02:41:49.222 --> 02:41:49.462]  Yes.
[02:41:49.502 --> 02:41:49.942]  Remember that?
[02:41:50.182 --> 02:41:50.423]  Yes.
[02:41:50.443 --> 02:41:51.063]  Spray planes.
[02:41:51.403 --> 02:41:56.708]  I don't think people understand, and now I'm not talking biological, I'm talking chemical.
[02:41:57.089 --> 02:42:07.038]  If you have a very closed community, and you know the winds are right, you basically fly over, kind of like Goldfinger, James Bond, you just take out everybody, okay?
[02:42:07.478 --> 02:42:13.104]  So the plan is, even on the trains, some people still don't believe there are prison cars ready to set.
[02:42:13.404 --> 02:42:16.267]  The plan is to take them out to a spur line,
[02:42:16.767 --> 02:42:27.510]  And basically, it's funny, the prison cars will be in front behind the engine, and behind that are the bulldozers and the caterpillars, and they just basically spray everybody in the prison cars.
[02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:30.190]  You see, this is what they're saying they're going to do.
[02:42:30.430 --> 02:42:32.591]  This is what insiders have told me they're going to do.
[02:42:32.911 --> 02:42:35.272]  And still, people go, I don't believe that.
[02:42:35.592 --> 02:42:36.372]  So here's the deal.
[02:42:36.532 --> 02:42:40.893]  For those of you that always fall back on the don't believe that, or that anytime
[02:42:40.953 --> 02:42:41.273]  Fair point.
[02:43:10.143 --> 02:43:11.043]  Well, I know this.
[02:43:11.123 --> 02:43:19.407]  There are people running things, and it doesn't matter if it's the CIA, the FBI, Interpol, MI6, MI5.
[02:43:19.447 --> 02:43:21.908]  There are good people in all those organizations.
[02:43:21.968 --> 02:43:31.251]  In fact, per capita, there might be even more good people in them, because they are inside and somewhat decompartmentalized compared to the public, so they know what's going on.
[02:43:31.291 --> 02:43:33.192]  But it doesn't matter, because at the top,
[02:43:34.338 --> 02:43:39.762]  Of almost all those organizations are key globalists that are controlling it and controlling the narrative.
[02:43:39.782 --> 02:43:45.966]  But because there are so many good people in the system now, it's hurting the globalists because they get caught when they pull things.
[02:43:46.006 --> 02:43:49.409]  But here is the larger problem in that.
[02:43:50.069 --> 02:44:00.256]  Is that the public, on average, is so dumbed down, they don't give support to the good people inside the system that would try to tell people the truth about what's happening.
[02:44:00.336 --> 02:44:03.839]  I mean, look at all the pedophiles' candles in the British government.
[02:44:03.879 --> 02:44:06.140]  They do that to compromise people.
[02:44:06.681 --> 02:44:11.044]  Look at just all the craziness that has already come out.
[02:44:11.184 --> 02:44:13.726]  It makes my head spin.
[02:44:14.086 --> 02:44:16.087]  Lori in California, you're on the air.
[02:44:16.107 --> 02:44:16.728]  Thanks for holding.
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:18.522]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:44:18.622 --> 02:44:21.406]  I have four points I'd like to make, and I'll be really quick.
[02:44:21.746 --> 02:44:25.652]  The first is, I think that the globalists are going to hit us on all fronts.
[02:44:25.812 --> 02:44:26.894]  I don't think they're going to let up.
[02:44:27.355 --> 02:44:32.763]  I think there's going to be a lot of false flags to divert us, but they'll still keep going under the wire to attack us.
[02:44:33.503 --> 02:44:39.666]  And secondly, the northern counties in California are trying to secede from Southern California.
[02:44:40.046 --> 02:44:42.788]  I don't know if you're aware of that because they're not being represented.
[02:44:43.848 --> 02:44:54.613]  Fourthly, I'd like to remind people, thirdly and fourthly, Lung Cleanse helped me get over that viral gook that's going around in four days where it's taking my friends three weeks to a month.
[02:44:55.433 --> 02:44:59.575]  And I'd also like to remind people, prepare for their pets also.
[02:44:59.836 --> 02:45:00.436]  That's crucial.
[02:45:01.496 --> 02:45:01.857]  Thank you.
[02:45:02.138 --> 02:45:03.261]  Well thank you so much ma'am.
[02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:06.350]  Since you brought that up, I didn't know you were calling on that subject.
[02:45:06.811 --> 02:45:07.975]  We looked at...
[02:45:09.134 --> 02:45:18.703]  At Big Holes in the supplement industry, because the supplement industry is always trying to come out with some new, manipulated, changed staple to call it something new.
[02:45:20.104 --> 02:45:25.609]  And they'll change, you know, an acid or something in it and give it some new cool name with something that's already a staple.
[02:45:26.029 --> 02:45:32.395]  We went back to basics to find the most organic, powerful, concentrated, cold-pressed products
[02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:36.193]  I mean, the iodine is from deep beneath the earth, 100%.
[02:45:37.074 --> 02:45:38.876]  It's like 9999 iodine.
[02:45:38.956 --> 02:45:39.877]  No one else has that.
[02:45:40.338 --> 02:45:41.479]  Other stuff is seaweed-based.
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:44.022]  Revolutionary what it does.
[02:45:44.522 --> 02:45:44.822]  Okay?
[02:45:45.243 --> 02:45:45.683]  X2.
[02:45:45.964 --> 02:45:48.567]  Discounted right now on Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:49.347 --> 02:45:51.109]  Take the Lung Cleanse.
[02:45:52.012 --> 02:45:53.893]  Is it fourteen different?
[02:45:53.913 --> 02:45:54.373]  I forget.
[02:45:54.873 --> 02:46:03.357]  Concentrated essential oils, cold-pressed, with a bunch of fruit and botanical extracts.
[02:46:04.597 --> 02:46:13.761]  And the only problem with it is it clogs up the spray top, so you gotta wash that out every four or five times you use it, because it's not like three or four ingredients and some menthol.
[02:46:14.621 --> 02:46:22.824]  This is like super essential oil, over the top, what it does when I have a sore throat or when I'm having bad allergies.
[02:46:23.124 --> 02:46:25.185]  We have that available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:25.485 --> 02:46:30.267]  The Oxy Powder from Global Healing Center that we have discounted at InfoWarsLife.com is
[02:46:31.267 --> 02:46:36.531]  Ozonated oxygen tablets that time release in the upper and lower intestine, large and small intestine.
[02:46:37.071 --> 02:46:40.234]  All I'm going to say is sensational what it does.
[02:46:40.514 --> 02:46:41.475]  You've heard the callers.
[02:46:41.795 --> 02:46:45.858]  Rob Dew, the news director, lost 12 pounds in one week and he was already not a big guy.
[02:46:46.298 --> 02:46:48.280]  He just had 12 pounds of you know what in there.
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:51.222]  And that's one of the big causes of people having so many problems.
[02:46:51.242 --> 02:46:52.183]  The immune system boosts.
[02:46:52.623 --> 02:46:54.584]  In the new year, folks, give yourself a favor.
[02:46:55.445 --> 02:46:58.147]  As part of your news resolution, take the oxy powder.
[02:46:58.607 --> 02:47:03.149]  It's all available at Infowarslife.com, and that also helps fund the whole Infowars operation.
[02:47:03.410 --> 02:47:06.651]  Go to stevequayle.com, get his Zeno Genesis book.
[02:47:06.772 --> 02:47:07.232]  I've read it.
[02:47:07.852 --> 02:47:12.475]  Over the top, the quotes, the documents about the master plan, stevequayle.com.
[02:47:12.875 --> 02:47:15.877]  Lori, thank you so much for your call.
[02:47:16.057 --> 02:47:19.619]  Linda, in New York, you're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:47:19.639 --> 02:47:19.979]  Go ahead.
[02:47:19.999 --> 02:47:21.900]  Can you hear me?
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:22.701]  I sure can.
[02:47:22.721 --> 02:47:23.321]  Thank you for holding.
[02:47:24.324 --> 02:47:25.225]  Okay, thank you.
[02:47:25.565 --> 02:47:36.834]  I'm calling about no one's mentioning the problems with Fukushima, the radiation spreading all over the U.S., and all the leaking reactors that we probably have in the U.S.
[02:47:36.854 --> 02:47:37.494]  90% are now leaking.
[02:47:37.534 --> 02:47:38.535]  I know, used to hardly any.
[02:47:39.115 --> 02:47:40.336]  No one cares anymore.
[02:47:40.736 --> 02:47:43.539]  Like, used to, they ran the reactors a lot better.
[02:47:43.559 --> 02:47:44.479]  They don't care anymore.
[02:47:44.499 --> 02:47:47.061]  Fukushima's still melting down.
[02:47:47.542 --> 02:47:48.903]  Steve Quayle, what's going on with that?
[02:47:49.523 --> 02:47:58.037]  Well, first of all, I think Fukushima is one of the most important, the biggest stories ever covered up, and I think the caller is absolutely at the center of the target on this.
[02:47:58.157 --> 02:48:04.066]  I try and post on my website, Alex, you know, anytime something new comes out on Fukushima from E!
[02:48:04.126 --> 02:48:04.386]  News,
[02:48:05.287 --> 02:48:09.031]  All of the radiation levels that are being measured across the United States.
[02:48:09.571 --> 02:48:16.257]  You can go on a website, you know, I forget the name of it, Rattler or something like that, and get a daily briefing.
[02:48:16.277 --> 02:48:19.640]  But here's what's not being reported, as they call it.
[02:48:20.061 --> 02:48:21.002]  It's so important.
[02:48:21.402 --> 02:48:23.444]  An EMP strike is inevitable.
[02:48:23.804 --> 02:48:29.409]  When the EMP strike takes place, 124 reactors are going to go critical.
[02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:31.391]  And it's not lost on our enemies.
[02:48:31.411 --> 02:48:32.011]  We're good to go.
[02:48:56.786 --> 02:48:57.689]  We're good to go.
[02:49:08.054 --> 02:49:08.855]  We're good to go.
[02:49:31.409 --> 02:49:34.712]  The EGLE report is under way, even as you and I broadcast the tape.
[02:49:34.752 --> 02:49:37.313]  Well, let's expand on that, and then I want to get her comment on it.
[02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:40.156]  I mean, I've covered that the first couple of years, heavily.
[02:49:41.036 --> 02:49:58.109]  And it was on record that the EPA, when they were getting 15 times one isotope, 100 and something another, a thousand times another, they would just cover up the tuna full of it, cover up the other stuff, and wouldn't even warn people, and then later admitted they just, quote, rose internally what they now say is safe.
[02:49:59.019 --> 02:50:10.355]  So, that's how I started getting into iodine and then got into the purest forms of it, was to try to protect my family's thyroid from the ambient background radiation increasing.
[02:50:10.395 --> 02:50:12.338]  I mean, why would the elite in the 60s...
[02:50:13.855 --> 02:50:18.737]  Detonate over, I forget how many, it's in the documentary Trinity and Beyond with Shatner.
[02:50:18.757 --> 02:50:39.347]  I think it's 200 or more high-powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and shows film of the Pentagon trying to blow holes in our atmosphere and admitting it and then trying to blow up the Van Allen radiation belt and they said, oh we thought this might make the earth lose its atmosphere or set the atmosphere on fire but we still did it.
[02:50:39.908 --> 02:50:42.089]  Why would they make bizarre statements like this, Steve?
[02:50:45.578 --> 02:50:47.199]  Absolutely the critical point.
[02:50:47.519 --> 02:50:52.062]  The Van Allen Belt, as most people would realize, keeps deadly cosmic radiation.
[02:50:52.582 --> 02:50:59.226]  I wrote books, Alex, when I first got in the survival business about ionizing radiation, nuclear war survival.
[02:50:59.246 --> 02:51:00.347]  I didn't write the book Nuclear War Survival.
[02:51:00.387 --> 02:51:01.348]  I know you're an expert.
[02:51:01.368 --> 02:51:01.728]  Stay there.
[02:51:01.788 --> 02:51:04.650]  Come back and tell us why they wanted to blow our atmosphere up.
[02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:05.630]  I mean, it's on TV.
[02:51:05.810 --> 02:51:07.271]  We wanted to see if we could kill everyone.
[02:51:07.431 --> 02:51:08.372]  Blow the atmosphere up!

[02:51:24.088 --> 02:51:26.168]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[02:51:26.408 --> 02:51:30.949]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[02:51:39.031 --> 02:51:41.613]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:51:41.753 --> 02:51:45.757]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:51:46.057 --> 02:51:47.298]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:51:47.458 --> 02:51:49.940]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:52.922]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:51:53.142 --> 02:51:55.284]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:51:55.484 --> 02:51:57.246]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:51:57.386 --> 02:52:02.730]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:52:02.970 --> 02:52:06.633]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:52:06.774 --> 02:52:08.275]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:52:08.955 --> 02:52:14.880]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:20.684]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[02:52:20.784 --> 02:52:27.789]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[02:52:27.989 --> 02:52:37.056]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[02:52:37.216 --> 02:52:39.958]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[02:52:40.238 --> 02:52:49.565]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[02:52:49.825 --> 02:52:53.708]  One World Whey is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[02:52:53.888 --> 02:52:59.772]  We believe One World Whey is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy internal body environment.
[02:52:59.952 --> 02:53:00.233]  Call 888.

[02:53:08.243 --> 02:53:10.825]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:53:11.085 --> 02:53:15.949]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:53:16.189 --> 02:53:24.075]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:53:24.315 --> 02:53:28.639]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:53:28.839 --> 02:53:32.662]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:53:32.802 --> 02:53:38.507]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:53:38.747 --> 02:53:41.529]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:53:41.930 --> 02:53:47.134]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:53:47.294 --> 02:53:55.421]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:54:14.133 --> 02:54:16.034]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:54:16.514 --> 02:54:19.256]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:36.482 --> 02:54:42.563]  I think what I'm getting at here is whether it's GMO, cross-species, hybrids, chimeras,
[02:54:44.831 --> 02:54:49.933]  The Pentagon, I mean, on television going, we're trying to see if we can blow holes in the atmosphere.
[02:54:50.233 --> 02:54:52.153]  This may cause a global fire.
[02:54:52.173 --> 02:54:54.754]  And this has all been declassified now by the 90s.
[02:54:55.534 --> 02:54:57.175]  But before it was secret, it's their films.
[02:54:57.815 --> 02:55:01.496]  And it's top physicists going, yes, we knew it could kill everyone, but we had to do it.
[02:55:01.976 --> 02:55:05.117]  And it kind of goes to the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider.
[02:55:05.518 --> 02:55:09.539]  Well, yes, it may cause a black hole in the equations and destroy the planet.
[02:55:10.319 --> 02:55:17.761]  The Singularity, or the Strangelet, will fall to the center of the Earth and may take a few weeks till it forms the black hole level and kills everyone.
[02:55:18.662 --> 02:55:23.183]  So, this just goes to the madness of the people that are in control.
[02:55:23.903 --> 02:55:27.324]  And now they've decided we're going to merge with machines and become gods.
[02:55:27.384 --> 02:55:30.785]  The few of us that are allowed to transcend to the next level, that is.
[02:55:30.805 --> 02:55:34.646]  And then we get back to the whole 2001 Space Odyssey.
[02:55:34.986 --> 02:55:36.367]  Steve Quayle comments on that.
[02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:38.491]  Yes.
[02:55:53.031 --> 02:55:55.152]  To open interdimensional gates.
[02:56:21.584 --> 02:56:22.385]  It's open the gates.
[02:56:22.525 --> 02:56:24.948]  Jesus said that gates of hell.
[02:56:25.188 --> 02:56:31.734]  Look, a gate is either designed to keep something from, you know, keep something out or allow something in.
[02:56:32.095 --> 02:56:39.342]  So the point is, when I get, you know, contacted by physicists at CERN saying, hey, you won't believe this, but guess what we saw?
[02:56:39.882 --> 02:56:53.591]  They have a giant idol right in the middle of it, I know.
[02:56:54.311 --> 02:56:55.312]  It's beyond insanity.
[02:56:55.332 --> 02:56:57.833]  I want to jam in one final caller, sorry to the others.
[02:56:58.214 --> 02:57:00.195]  Kevin in West Virginia, go ahead.
[02:57:01.505 --> 02:57:06.591]  I was calling in because I wanted to say, wow, you guys hit on what I was going to say anyway.
[02:57:06.931 --> 02:57:16.723]  But I wanted to say, with 2015, 2016 and everything, I believe we are going to be crushed to the point that we are going to beg for a savior.
[02:57:17.208 --> 02:57:31.017]  Pointing towards all roads lead to Rome, and with the Vatican and the Luciferian telescope looking for extraterrestrial, extramentional life, meaning that we are going to be ushering in the alien savior.
[02:57:31.037 --> 02:57:35.320]  I believe that not only we are all going to be deceived, not all of us,
[02:57:36.882 --> 02:57:45.054]  I'll say this, they're certainly promoting that in the culture and the media and the Vatican has come out and said we think aliens are probably real and get ready for it.
[02:57:45.374 --> 02:57:47.758]  A lot of bizarre stuff getting pushed out there.
[02:57:48.138 --> 02:57:49.520]  Interesting points, we gotta jump.
[02:57:49.540 --> 02:57:50.461]  What do you think, Steve Quayle?
[02:57:50.982 --> 02:57:55.828]  Well, I think that the caller absolutely has got a total grasp on what's happening.
[02:57:56.188 --> 02:57:57.310]  That is the endgame.
[02:57:57.610 --> 02:57:59.052]  The Vatican's already run record.
[02:57:59.092 --> 02:58:06.000]  Tom Horne has recorded interviews with the top astronomers and the top scientists in the Vatican.
[02:58:06.601 --> 02:58:07.122]  We're good to go.
[02:58:27.054 --> 02:58:27.774]  We're out of time.
[02:58:27.794 --> 02:58:28.595]  Great job, Steve Quill.
[02:58:28.715 --> 02:58:30.435]  It's all food for thought.
[02:58:30.455 --> 02:58:31.616]  The elite believe in it.
[02:58:31.636 --> 02:58:33.036]  You can think whatever you want.
[02:58:33.056 --> 02:58:34.737]  The point is, a major time of change is here.
[02:58:34.757 --> 02:58:35.197]  God bless you all.
[02:58:35.217 --> 02:58:36.838]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:36.898 --> 02:58:37.998]  We'll be back live tomorrow.
[02:58:56.363 --> 02:58:56.890]  Great job, Craig.
[02:58:59.139 --> 02:59:02.980]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[02:59:03.740 --> 02:59:10.021]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[02:59:29.039 --> 02:59:32.561]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:32.701 --> 02:59:36.664]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:36.984 --> 02:59:38.445]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:38.765 --> 02:59:46.350]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:47.471]  But for how long?
[02:59:47.771 --> 02:59:49.772]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:59:49.972 --> 02:59:54.035]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:59:54.415 --> 02:59:55.576]  Infidel Body Armor.

[03:00:01.067 --> 03:00:03.655]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
