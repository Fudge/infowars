[00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:21.287]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:25.456]  I'm your host Rob Due, and today is Tuesday, June 24th, 2014, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:38.201]  Tonight, he was a spy who risked everything to bring down top terrorists, only to become a target himself.
[00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:41.665]  Another CIA informant gets double-crossed.
[00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:46.690]  Meanwhile, the Federal Bureau of Entrapment is now targeting preppers.
[00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:49.233]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs reports.
[00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:58.344]  And Intel is developing a kill switch for laptops that would enable the remote monitoring and disabling of your computer.
[00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.510]  A disturbing prospect given the firm's link with the NSA.
[00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.775]  All that and more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:09.538]  Technology is getting more fascinating each day.
[00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:11.339]  It's also getting a lot more creepy.
[00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:13.881]  Especially when it comes to the big companies like Intel.
[00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.083]  Well now, they've developed a kill switch for their laptops.
[00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:18.784]  And here's the article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:21.786]  Intel developing kill switch for laptops.
[00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:28.431]  It is widely acknowledged by experts that the NSA has hardware level backdoors built into Intel and AMD processors.
[00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:37.694]  Earlier this year, during a Reddit online chat session, Intel CEO Brian Krennich refused to answer a question on whether the NSA had backdoor access.
[00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:50.717]  What they developed is what they call a wireless credential exchange, wherein they create sort of a free speech zone, and if the phone leaves out of that area, it will suddenly become disabled and refuses to work.
[00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:55.497]  And this goes back to the whole kill switch thing that happened with the iPhones back in 2008.
[00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:58.018]  Here's an article out of The Telegraph.
[00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:01.019]  Apple Jobs confirms iPhone kill switch.
[00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:12.066]  Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, has confirmed there is a kill switch built into the iPhone that allows Apple to remotely delete malicious or inappropriate applications stored on the device.
[00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:16.528]  Fast forward now to 2014 in June with the Guardian article.
[00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:22.112]  Apple iPhone kill switch cuts thefts and Microsoft and Google are to follow.
[00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:25.834]  Apple's introduction of the kill switch in its iPhone software last September
[00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.171]  Yes.
[00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:48.144]  Yes.
[00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.902]  I apologize for Watson's article.
[00:03:10.102 --> 00:03:13.603]  All new Android and Windows phones will have a kill switch.
[00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:15.663]  So they're following Apple in this trend.
[00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:34.347]  Although the kill switch would ostensibly be included to discourage theft, a scenario where authorities could hijack the technology to shut down communications in a sensitive area in order to limit photo or streaming video coverage such as a demonstration or at the scene unfolding a police brutality is easily to envisage.
[00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:39.809]  And you've seen police go and do that just on their own, grab people's iPhones, erase footage.
[00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:47.491]  We've had our own reporters have footage erased off of their phones when they've gone into sensitive areas, mainly just asking questions.
[00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:51.933]  But that is what this technology is going to be used for, especially on reporters.
[00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:54.694]  They'll kill iPhones, they'll kill these video streaming devices.
[00:03:56.224 --> 00:04:01.469]  And taking the story a little further, we have an article that appeared in September of last year.
[00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.554]  Secret 3G Intel chip gives Snoops backdoor PC access.
[00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:17.403]  The Intel Core V Pro processor contains a secret 3G chip that allows remote disabling and backdoor access to any computer, even when it's turned off.
[00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:20.886]  And they even mention that in their video proudly.
[00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:35.825]  Unlike software-only solutions that require PCs to be powered on and software agents running on a fully functional OS, a hardware-assisted approach enables PCs to be managed regardless of system state and without requiring software agents.
[00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:37.746]  The result?
[00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:44.592]  IT or IT service providers can diagnose and fix problems without a desk side visit.
[00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:51.959]  Schedule PCs to power down at night to cut energy costs and still have the ability to power them up for off hours patching.
[00:04:52.259 --> 00:05:11.080]  So while the idea for this 3G chip was probably thought up by some pot-bellied engineer in the back trying to make his job and life a lot easier, the NSA and other companies that have their roots stuck deep into these companies are going to use this same technology to access computers to either steal data or upload certain data that they want.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.840]  I think so.
[00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:35.700]  To target dissent, such as Turkey recently shut down Twitter in an attempt to cover up a political scandal.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:52.447]  I couldn't agree more with that statement and it really is scary the way this technology is being used as a double-edged sword while we use it out in the field to gather information to show you the authorities and our public servants are using it to take information away from us and limit access.
[00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:53.247]  It's really scary.
[00:05:53.627 --> 00:05:55.068]  Let's move on to some TSA news.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.663]  TSA agent arrested on cocaine trafficking charges.
[00:05:59.683 --> 00:06:01.845]  I'll also include she is a mother of four.
[00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:09.813]  A South Florida mother and Transportation Security Administration agent is facing felony charges of manufacturing and selling drugs in her home.
[00:06:10.294 --> 00:06:19.603]  Latwana Daniels, 33, was being held without bond Sunday after investigators said they uncovered 111 grams of cocaine, 39 grams of marijuana in her homestead home.
[00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:27.308]  Police also found tools for packaging cocaine along with scales, beakers and packaging materials used to cook cocaine and process it into crack cocaine.
[00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:29.309]  I find this part the most interesting.
[00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.332]  The tools were found in a closet next to her TSA uniforms.
[00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:47.882]  So obviously the TSA is trying to distance themselves from this scandal considering that they are constantly being in the news for theft, for running around shouting that they're God, assault, all kinds of charges because these people are on power trips.
[00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:49.262]  But this also has another
[00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:51.629]  You know, kind of sad aspect to it.
[00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:58.295]  Here we have a mother of four trying to make ends meet, most likely, and she turns to drugs because that is a good, easy second job to have.
[00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.999]  You can do it from your house, customers come to you, and you can make a, there's a high profit margin in it.
[00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:07.402]  So I can understand why she's selling drugs, and that's why drugs should be legal.
[00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:14.889]  So we wouldn't have things like this, nor would we have our transportation security officials going into this line of work.
[00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.150]  One final article before we go to break.
[00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:22.314]  Watchdog asked government to distribute emergency nuke pills to Canadians.
[00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:32.382]  The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has asked the government to distribute potassium iodide pills to Canadians living within 10 kilometers of nuclear power plants, highlighting lingering concerns over the 2011 Fukushima disaster.
[00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:45.948]  The CNSC is proposing the tablets be pre-distributed within the plume area of radiation of about 10 kilometers for a select portion of the population, which in the greater Toronto area means about a quarter million people.
[00:07:47.428 --> 00:07:56.811]  Energy producers present at a meeting to discuss the issue in Ottawa expressed doubts about the program, insisting that Canadians might think the pills were being forced upon them.
[00:07:56.851 --> 00:08:01.473]  Yes, obviously people don't want any help from radiation from their government.
[00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:04.074]  Especially in the form of potassium iodide.
[00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:04.614]  Right.
[00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:05.515]  We're supposed to believe that.
[00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:07.036]  They just don't want to spend the money on this.
[00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:17.342]  But that is an interesting article that watchdog groups are petitioning their government to make available these types of things like potassium iodide.
[00:08:17.702 --> 00:08:24.907]  I myself actually take the X2 survival shield and let me tell you, you can taste every drop of power.
[00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:28.009]  It almost tastes like you're mainlining seawater.
[00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:29.710]  Pretty impressive stuff.
[00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.232]  If you haven't checked it out, go check it out at the Info Wars store.
[00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:34.494]  I think we have a detox special going on right now.
[00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:41.380]  And it has given me a big boost in energy and I can definitely feel the toxins leeching out of my skin.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.304]  I practically have to wash my face three or four times a day just to get rid of the crud coming out.
[00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:52.188]  And without further ado, we'll go to break and we'll be right back with why you should not become a CIA or FBI informant.
[00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:53.710]  It's the Info Wars and Nightly News.
[00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:08.973]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:11.777]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:18.566]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:22.829]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:33.616]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:39.400]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:47.945]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:58.910]  That are incredibly powerful that no one else has as a source for their iodine from between 7 and 12,000 feet literally drilled out of the ground.
[00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.552]  You put it on a hot plate and it turns into the pure gas.
[00:10:04.752 --> 00:10:07.994]  No one else has 99.99% pure iodine.
[00:10:09.434 --> 00:10:13.236]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:15.356]  I was over 270 pounds.
[00:10:17.137 --> 00:10:26.182]  And with the iodine, exercise, and better diet, I have lost now more than 50 pounds total and I'm continuing to lose the weight.
[00:10:26.522 --> 00:10:30.665]  I have more energy, my libido, all this crap came out of my skin.
[00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:32.666]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:10:32.706 --> 00:10:34.066]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:10:34.347 --> 00:10:35.467]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:10:36.007 --> 00:10:36.688]  Nobody else.
[00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:40.769]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.970]  This is innovating.
[00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.390]  This is trailblazing.
[00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:51.133]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:10:51.353 --> 00:10:55.435]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:10:55.635 --> 00:11:00.817]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:14.483]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm your host Rob Dew.
[00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:19.165]  Now I mentioned right before we went to break on why you should not become a CIA or FBI informant.
[00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:27.510]  Well, for one reason, you're going to be setting up all kinds of people and I don't know if you want that type of dirty laundry on your soul as you go through this life.
[00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.791]  Two, they're probably going to double cross you.
[00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:32.333]  And three, they might even kill you in the end.
[00:11:32.813 --> 00:11:33.373]  You never know.
[00:11:33.613 --> 00:11:35.334]  Let's go to this Mail Online article.
[00:11:35.775 --> 00:11:40.037]  My CIA handlers cheated me out of $5 million, then set a trap to murder me.
[00:11:40.357 --> 00:11:43.219]  He was the spy who risked everything to bring down top terrorists.
[00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:43.739]  His reward?
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.101]  To become a target himself.
[00:11:47.059 --> 00:12:02.244]  It's a mouthful of a headline there, but it's about the story of Marad Storm, aka Morton Storm, who became a MI5 asset, and then he got in with the CIA, and he actually helped track down Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:12:02.604 --> 00:12:08.485]  You might remember him from the 2002 article that said terrorists dined at the Pentagon.
[00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:10.226]  There's a picture of him right there.
[00:12:10.586 --> 00:12:13.187]  He actually went to a Pentagon dinner after 9-11.
[00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:14.947]  That's how dangerous this man was.
[00:12:15.047 --> 00:12:16.508]  We had to have him in the Pentagon.
[00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:22.539]  Well, as you know, just a few years ago, we tracked him down via drone and shot him and his son.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.401]  With a missile.
[00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:28.404]  Well, Morton Storm claims he is the man who helped do that.
[00:12:29.045 --> 00:12:31.267]  And his, I guess, reward or punishment?
[00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:36.232]  Well, his reward was, one, he didn't get any of the money that was promised him, the $5 million.
[00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:38.293]  They said, no, they need him to go do more.
[00:12:38.694 --> 00:12:48.383]  And in the end, he talks about how he felt like he was double-crossed, and even had a source come up to him and say, hey, when you were down there with Al-Qaeda, they were planning on taking you out with them.
[00:12:49.537 --> 00:12:52.320]  So it just goes to show you, you gotta watch who you're doing business with.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:13:07.134]  We've covered this countless times on the Infowars Nightly News, and Alex has covered it even before that, of people getting involved with the FBI and turning people in on basically fake evidence, or going out with money and trying to buy people to turn them into terrorists.
[00:13:07.434 --> 00:13:09.416]  And with that, we go to this report by Joe Biggs.
[00:13:13.104 --> 00:13:15.928]  Right now we really don't have a lot of domestic terrorists.
[00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.890]  So the FBI is getting bored.
[00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:20.273]  So they're creating bad guys to go after.
[00:13:20.313 --> 00:13:30.306]  It's like Batman and Gotham City running out of the Joker, Two-Face, and then finding someone else and pissing them off and getting them to go out so he has someone to fight.
[00:13:30.446 --> 00:13:31.928]  That's all the FBI is doing right now.
[00:13:32.128 --> 00:13:35.970]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.591]  The FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans.
[00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:43.993]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:13:44.253 --> 00:13:49.696]  The more curious cases are the remaining 17 for which the federal government has taken credit.
[00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.082]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:13:53.522 --> 00:13:58.244]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:13:58.564 --> 00:14:00.045]  Right now we have the case in Florida.
[00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:03.146]  Marty Winters is a 55-year-old prepper.
[00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:06.808]  It's usually the good family right down the street that you know to.
[00:14:06.828 --> 00:14:11.510]  They go to church every day, hard-working Americans who pay their bills, and really all they're doing is they're just trying to prepare
[00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.990]  In case something bad happens, what's wrong with that?
[00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:20.471]  You know, the way our government's going right now, the way our economy is, it looks like that is a possibility that, you know, everything could collapse.
[00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:22.392]  So what's wrong with being prepared?
[00:14:22.532 --> 00:14:39.115]  Our government wants us to be prepared for a worst-case scenario by forcing us to buy Obamacare, but we as Americans can't prepare, we can't go out and buy MREs, we can't have, you know, water purification devices and stored water, guns and ammunition, just to be on the safe side.
[00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:39.975]  And this man
[00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:57.700]  Had an FBI agent infiltrate his River Otter Prepper group and say that he had 50 AK-47s buried across his properties, he had a house that was booby-trapped, that he would catch on fire, and when a federal agent showed up, it would kill him.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:04.104]  Now, after the search warrant was given, they went in and found five legally registered guns in a safe.
[00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:08.708]  No huge weapons cache that the FBI informant who was embedded in there said that he had.
[00:15:08.968 --> 00:15:13.171]  And there were no homes out of the properties that he owned that were rigged to blow up.
[00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:17.734]  You know, it wasn't this huge elaborate scheme that the FBI made it out to be.
[00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:26.141]  You know, they just wanted to go after a guy who was a prepper who wants to preach and, you know, a friendly neighbor guy and demonize this man.
[00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:27.542]  This is the new normal.
[00:15:27.642 --> 00:15:33.667]  I mean, in a sense, when, you know, you mentioned Kwasi Nafis, for example, the man who tried to detonate a bomb at the Federal Reserve Building.
[00:15:33.687 --> 00:15:35.528]  You know, here was a guy who had nothing.
[00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:36.930]  He never had access to any weapons.
[00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.492]  He never had any contact with Al-Qaeda or a terrorist organization.
[00:15:39.632 --> 00:15:47.278]  It was actually an undercover agent who provided everything he needed, provided the bomb, provided the transportation, provided the money, and that allowed him to commit this crime.
[00:15:47.358 --> 00:15:55.005]  What we're seeing more and more in these sting operations is people who are on the fringes, who are desperate, sometimes mentally ill, and they're the ones being caught in these sting operations.
[00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:59.788]  Well, as you can see, the FBI obviously doesn't have our best interests in mind at all.
[00:15:59.848 --> 00:16:05.092]  You know, they have funded almost every single domestic terrorist incident in America.
[00:16:05.232 --> 00:16:12.338]  Underwear bomber, 93 at the Twin Towers or the World Trade Center, when the car bomb went in and blew up and killed some people and injured a lot more.
[00:16:12.418 --> 00:16:21.105]  They have a history of taking these people and taking their simple, small idea that was never going to turn into anything and then give them the money and the weapons to pull it off.
[00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:38.726]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:16:38.846 --> 00:16:41.088]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:49.553]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:16:49.854 --> 00:17:05.164]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:05.884]  I don't know.
[00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:40.550]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.293]  Today I'd like to talk about the war on women.
[00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:48.237]  You've experienced and heard about the benefits of super male vitality.
[00:17:48.758 --> 00:17:51.240]  Now, the new formula has arrived.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.504]  Introducing the new super female vitality.
[00:17:55.804 --> 00:18:03.872]  I have specifically designed this formula to help the body naturally regulate itself without the use of artificial hormones.
[00:18:04.272 --> 00:18:07.575]  Key ingredients chosen from the highest quality sources.
[00:18:07.976 --> 00:18:15.002]  Each of these ingredients works synergistically with the female body in order to maximize overall vitality.
[00:18:15.202 --> 00:18:22.109]  You've heard the reviews and the feedback on how the original super male vitality has revitalized relationships.
[00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:27.574]  Now, both the man and the woman can have the revitalization in their own bodies.
[00:18:27.714 --> 00:18:28.255]  We're good to go.
[00:18:46.448 --> 00:18:49.231]  Welcome back to the Infowars Nightly News, I'm your host Rob Dew.
[00:18:49.671 --> 00:19:03.566]  We are joined by Kit Daniels, one of our writers slash reporters who just recently got back from the South Texas border, and he's going to describe a myriad of things that should really get you concerned about what's going on down there, and it's not about a border crisis.
[00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:06.189]  This is literally a border stand down.
[00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.111]  The Border Patrol is letting people just
[00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:12.253]  Well, my observation about the border is that we don't have one anymore.
[00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:33.689]  You'd think that Brownsville, Texas, which is a border city in South Texas, would be crawling with Border Patrol agents right now.
[00:19:34.249 --> 00:19:35.349]  But that wasn't the case at all.
[00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:39.970]  When we arrived down there, we first stopped in downtown Brownsville near the International Bridge.
[00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.372]  And no exaggeration, there was hardly any Border Patrol agents stationed.
[00:19:45.512 --> 00:19:46.612]  We hardly saw any trucks.
[00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:49.212]  And we stayed there for about, maybe a little bit over an hour.
[00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:55.314]  And yet we only saw maybe one Border Patrol truck drive by every like 15 minutes or so.
[00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.415]  And this is a planned invasion too.
[00:19:57.735 --> 00:20:03.639]  We've got the Fed biz ops where they're looking to transport at least 60,000 children that just came out in January.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.583]  And Jay Johnson was coming down to the border to talk.
[00:20:09.623 --> 00:20:11.004]  He stopped in San Antonio.
[00:20:11.064 --> 00:20:12.705]  We sent our reporters there and they ran.
[00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:13.326]  They scattered.
[00:20:13.366 --> 00:20:18.289]  They were afraid to just answer basic questions like, if you knew about this, why are you acting like you didn't know about it?
[00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:19.390]  And it's a big crisis.
[00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.911]  When it's not a crisis, it's something you guys planned from the beginning.
[00:20:22.272 --> 00:20:25.194]  What's key to understand is that our immigration
[00:20:25.794 --> 00:20:26.635]  I think so.
[00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:51.044]  So taxpayers are subsidizing the transportation, the importation of illegals into America.
[00:20:52.144 --> 00:21:01.166]  And the Border Patrol is, and not just the Border Patrol, the Obama administration is saying, well, we'll just give them a court date for their immigration status.
[00:21:01.306 --> 00:21:02.706]  And they're going to show up, right?
[00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:03.446]  Absolutely not.
[00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:04.827]  It's an honor system.
[00:21:05.067 --> 00:21:05.547]  It's crazy.
[00:21:05.587 --> 00:21:06.467]  And there's no address.
[00:21:06.507 --> 00:21:08.148]  You can't track these people down after that.
[00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:09.768]  There's no, like if I get a warrant.
[00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:11.509]  Well, it's got my address on it.
[00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:12.489]  They know where to come get me.
[00:21:13.069 --> 00:21:16.211]  But no, not in the case of these illegals that they're shipping all over the country.
[00:21:16.311 --> 00:21:17.292]  They don't even know where they're going.
[00:21:17.432 --> 00:21:23.035]  They're just shipping them to a city and just hoping that, well, if they have a crime, if they have a record, eh, maybe we'll catch them again.
[00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:28.657]  And it is rare for Border Patrol to do an internal roundup of illegal immigrants inside America.
[00:21:29.138 --> 00:21:36.982]  It's far more common for city cops, such as in Austin, to do a warrant roundup for parking tickets than it is for Border Patrol to go out and say,
[00:21:37.782 --> 00:21:39.484]  Hey, we're looking for this illegal alien.
[00:21:39.504 --> 00:21:40.605]  He never showed up for his court date.
[00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.568]  And you can't do this in any other country in the world.
[00:21:43.588 --> 00:21:49.755]  You just can't walk in, be given a bus ticket to wherever you want to go, be given food, be given shelter, be given clothing.
[00:21:50.215 --> 00:21:52.978]  That doesn't happen anywhere else in this entire world.
[00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:53.719]  It doesn't happen.
[00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:58.361]  It's incredible that they're acting like we're bad because we want to say no to it.
[00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:01.223]  You know, the Obama administration saying, oh, how do you not want to help these people?
[00:22:01.263 --> 00:22:02.023]  It's not about that.
[00:22:02.403 --> 00:22:07.486]  It's about that this isn't allowed anywhere and it's because it leads to a total degeneration of all laws.
[00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:17.851]  Yeah, and what's even more incredible is that Mexico back in 2011 eased their immigration laws to allow people from Guatemala to enter the jungle borders of southern Mexico.
[00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:24.855]  Because Mexico said, well, we'll just let the United States handle the situation because they're going to go to El Norte anyway.
[00:22:25.015 --> 00:22:27.477]  They're not going to go to, they're not going to stay in Mexico.
[00:22:27.497 --> 00:22:31.259]  Right, because Mexico's failed and people are getting killed over the drug war.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.481]  Yeah, they were like, well, let's just let the U.S.
[00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:34.241]  deal with it.
[00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:47.831]  So now we're seeing little kids getting their arms and legs cut off because they're joining, they're jumping on these so-called death trains, which is little freight trains, to make the perilous 1,500 mile journey up north.
[00:22:48.496 --> 00:23:00.999]  Yeah, if people don't know this, every stop, every time the train stops, drugs, drug gangs, just regular gangs get on and say, look, pay me your cut, pay me $100 or we're going to kill you, or we're going to throw you off the train.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.820]  And it happens all the time.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.980]  And it's just disgusting.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.481]  It's disgusting for the poor kids that have to go through this.
[00:23:07.281 --> 00:23:09.181]  I'm sorry that their country's gone.
[00:23:09.442 --> 00:23:13.363]  Their country, you know, Central America, Mexico, it's gone.
[00:23:13.403 --> 00:23:14.343]  They've totally collapsed.
[00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:16.708]  It's not our fault that this happened.
[00:23:17.009 --> 00:23:18.352]  We don't have to take care of these people.
[00:23:18.712 --> 00:23:25.607]  Well, it is the fault of the CIA for making Latin America, South America, Central America as bad as it is.
[00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:26.468]  Oh, that's true.
[00:23:27.358 --> 00:23:28.338]  So you got that right.
[00:23:28.378 --> 00:23:29.659]  They put in their own dictators.
[00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:30.879]  They give them loans.
[00:23:30.919 --> 00:23:33.200]  The World Bank will give them loans that they can't pay back.
[00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:35.201]  And then they want to come in and take everything over.
[00:23:35.241 --> 00:23:37.542]  And all this is done through a puppet head that they do put in.
[00:23:37.802 --> 00:23:39.563]  But it's not the fault of the American people.
[00:23:39.663 --> 00:23:40.563]  No, absolutely not.
[00:23:40.724 --> 00:23:42.564]  But it is fault of the American government to an extent.
[00:23:43.044 --> 00:23:46.046]  But the American government is going to use it to its advantage by
[00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:54.931]  With this de facto amnesty that the Obama administration is putting forth with selective enforcement immigration laws and telling border patrol to stand down.
[00:23:54.951 --> 00:24:00.075]  Hey, don't go after these criminals, don't go after illegal aliens, don't go after drug traffickers.
[00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:08.079]  And they're going to get teens that are 16, 17 years old, bring them in, give them free stuff, give them literature that says, hey, you guys got to vote down guns.
[00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:09.419]  Guns were bad in your country, too.
[00:24:09.879 --> 00:24:12.080]  See all the violence that happened in your country because of guns?
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:20.243]  And so then they're going to vote to take our guns, they're going to vote for more welfare, and the system that we have that's already crumbling is just going to implode into nothingness.
[00:24:20.263 --> 00:24:26.185]  Yeah, there was a Gallup poll that came out recently that said that illegal aliens are eight times more likely to identify with Democrats than Republicans.
[00:24:26.345 --> 00:24:27.246]  Now, why do you think that is?
[00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:29.468]  Because that's where they came from.
[00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:33.012]  It's totally, totally ridiculous and disgusting.
[00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:34.053]  Now, tell me about this.
[00:24:34.093 --> 00:24:40.321]  Yesterday you guys called us and you got pulled over twice by two different, I think one was a state trooper and one was a city police officer.
[00:24:41.022 --> 00:24:44.266]  So they have time to come pull you guys over for being journalists.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.361]  But they're not going after the illegals.
[00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:47.882]  It's amazing.
[00:24:47.942 --> 00:24:50.783]  Or they're not even going after the Border Patrol for letting the illegals come in.
[00:24:50.803 --> 00:24:54.825]  I mean, how come nobody gets arrested, but reporters get harassed continuously?
[00:24:55.326 --> 00:25:01.989]  Well, we started out in Brownsville, Texas, and we drove about 50, 60 miles up Highway 281, which hugs the Mexican border.
[00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.190]  It's a very dangerous area.
[00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.873]  One of the troopers that stopped us even said that there's a lot of kidnappings and other violent crime going on.
[00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:14.683]  But the whole, for the entire hour, about the hour that we drove, we only saw one border patrol agent.
[00:25:15.044 --> 00:25:18.086]  And he was just pulled over on the side of the shoulder of the highway.
[00:25:18.106 --> 00:25:19.207]  Probably eating his lunch.
[00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:20.448]  Yeah, or making a phone call.
[00:25:21.148 --> 00:25:24.771]  It wasn't like we saw him out in the badlands where we went.
[00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:32.757]  But we did see probably every several hundred yards, we started seeing state troopers continuously.
[00:25:33.888 --> 00:25:43.932]  So, the state of Texas and the city governments and the counties are having to use their resources to seal the border, in effect, but there's just not enough people.
[00:25:44.732 --> 00:25:50.035]  There was an article that came out in 2011, they said they need 500,000 troops.
[00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:55.117]  Customs, the Customs Office said, we're going to need 500,000 troops to seal the border.
[00:25:55.857 --> 00:25:58.058]  And there's no way there's enough there right now, at all.
[00:25:58.118 --> 00:26:00.599]  And Border Patrol's not doing anything, but Border Patrol's bringing them in.
[00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:13.026]  Now, there are really good agents in Border Patrol that are trying to do their best, and they're trying to do their jobs, but they're being stonewalled by Border Patrol management to lay off, to quit going after these people.
[00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:18.949]  But the Border Patrol management's getting their policies from upstairs, or closer to the White House.
[00:26:20.219 --> 00:26:25.822]  So it's very critical to point that out, so we don't throw all Border Patrol agents under the bus.
[00:26:25.842 --> 00:26:31.284]  There really are some that are doing their best to do their jobs, but unfortunately a lot of them are now looking for new jobs.
[00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:32.865]  Well, and it's always like this.
[00:26:32.905 --> 00:26:39.629]  The low-level guys are always doing their job, they're doing what they're supposed to, and they're hamstrung by different policies or procedures.
[00:26:40.769 --> 00:26:43.391]  Uh, institutionalized thinking that comes in from the top.
[00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:46.274]  And it's just really, it's really scary what's going on down there.
[00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:51.178]  And this only started this year and we're already up to 50,000 just children coming in.
[00:26:51.578 --> 00:26:53.440]  We're even bigger than that.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.141]  It's 90,000 now.
[00:26:54.161 --> 00:26:54.561]  It's 90,000?
[00:26:55.622 --> 00:26:57.123]  That's just ridiculous.
[00:26:57.143 --> 00:26:59.685]  We're barely halfway through the year at this point.
[00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:01.287]  I do understand why people want to come here.
[00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:05.750]  This is the greatest country in the world, even though we're going downhill fast.
[00:27:06.707 --> 00:27:12.368]  We developed a system where people could, through hard work, through dedication, through honesty, make money.
[00:27:12.728 --> 00:27:19.210]  And it's sad that we've left all that behind to giant corporations who just use us as slave labor, essentially.
[00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.671]  And it's important to realize the federal government really doesn't care that much about these people.
[00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:24.911]  They're using them as a voting base.
[00:27:25.451 --> 00:27:26.891]  They're using them to stay in power.
[00:27:26.932 --> 00:27:27.912]  It's all about the government.
[00:27:27.952 --> 00:27:28.772]  It's not about the people.
[00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:30.794]  Yeah, and it's just disgusting.
[00:27:30.814 --> 00:27:34.497]  You have people like Jay Johnson who run from reporters who just have questions.
[00:27:34.537 --> 00:27:38.721]  Like, this is supposed to be the head of Homeland Security and he's treating reporters.
[00:27:38.762 --> 00:27:40.523]  They detained our reporters for hours.
[00:27:40.563 --> 00:27:41.584]  They erased their footage.
[00:27:42.485 --> 00:27:43.706]  They're being treated as terrorists.
[00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:47.550]  It's totally criminal the way these people are acting, yet we're treated as we're criminals.
[00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:49.272]  Kit, thanks a lot for going down on the border.
[00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:50.093]  Really appreciate it.
[00:27:51.397 --> 00:27:55.359]  This is a war that we're fighting where the only winners are going to be a bloated federal government.
[00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:57.540]  They're going to get voted in more power.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.501]  They're going to get voted more taxes.
[00:27:59.921 --> 00:28:02.363]  And they're going to take your guns away and they're going to take your rights away.
[00:28:03.263 --> 00:28:04.804]  And it all starts at the border.
[00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:10.967]  We have to have our border closed and allow for a normal progression of immigrants coming in.
[00:28:11.647 --> 00:28:14.249]  Because, yes, this is the greatest country in the world.
[00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:17.410]  And it's a shame that we can't let everybody in all at once.
[00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.271]  But we can.
[00:28:18.491 --> 00:28:20.152]  It's just our society will
[00:28:21.152 --> 00:28:22.312]  It will implode.
[00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:28.755]  There's counties down there that have spent all their yearly budget already just on trying to house the immigrants that are coming in.
[00:28:29.355 --> 00:28:37.998]  It's a total mismanagement of any kind of border that we have down there in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and in California.

[00:28:55.068 --> 00:29:03.716]  This is a planned false flag attack on our border right now to bring in just a wave of people who have nothing else to do but look for a free handout.
[00:29:04.097 --> 00:29:05.758]  And we can't operate like that as a country.
[00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:07.520]  No country can operate like that.
[00:29:08.181 --> 00:29:10.363]  And with that, we'll see you tomorrow night at 7 p.m.
