[00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:21.198]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.258 --> 00:00:25.327]  It is Friday, February 28, 2014, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:26.329]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:36.590]  Tonight, the TSA detains a libertarian blogger after seeing Bitcoin in his bag.
[00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.635]  And a Mexican holiday trumps the Bill of Rights in a t-shirt case that has reached federal court.
[00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:52.682]  Then, tension in the Ukraine builds as Russia moves into position for a possible military strike.
[00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:55.945]  All that, plus- Info wars!
[00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:58.527]  Info wars!
[00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:04.904]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:15.033]  Russian President Vladimir Putin stoked concerns that Moscow might begin using its military might to sway the outcome of the three-month standoff in the Ukraine.
[00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:27.881]  They have already ordered snap combat drills near the border involving 150,000 troops and nearly 900 tanks, as well as Air Force drills training pilots to attack enemy forces.
[00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:33.304]  It seems like a clear indicator that Russia is preparing to invade the Ukraine.
[00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:46.708]  And now the interim government that set up in the Ukraine after the violent coup that took place this week is calling on the United States and Britain to intervene militarily after unidentified soldiers stormed an airport in Crimea.
[00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:54.551]  The troops there, they made no apparent attempt to interfere with the running of the airport or trying to take over any key infrastructure.
[00:01:55.111 --> 00:02:03.798]  In fact, they were content with just strolling up and down the car park at a leisurely place, apparently deliberately for the benefit of television cameras.
[00:02:04.178 --> 00:02:11.404]  But today, Russia has admitted that it has moved troops into the Ukraine to protect Black Sea Fleet's positions.
[00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:17.629]  Now, Ukraine, of course, this interim government, is accusing Russia of staging an armed invasion.
[00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.292]  Crimea is along Ukraine's peninsula and it has very strong ties to Russia.
[00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:30.235]  The population there is nearly 60% ethnic Russian and it's very pro-Russian as a whole.
[00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:45.422]  So just on the heels of Russian troops moving into Crimea, Russian lawmakers are now proposing two bills that would simplify both the annexation of new territories into the Russian Federation and the process of granting Russian citizens
[00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:46.182]  I think?
[00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:26.064]  Now given the latest developments including Russia's recent military buildup and Sevastopol's city council handing power to a Russian citizen Monday evening, while more than a thousand protesters were outside chanting Russia, Russia, it's highly unlikely that Moscow will be giving up Crimea without a fight.
[00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:35.651]  But clearly indicating just how involved and what a central role the US played in the overthrow of their democratically elected government there.
[00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:42.177]  Ukraine's new interim prime minister is a former banker who met with both John McCain
[00:03:42.777 --> 00:03:48.743]  And Victoria Nuland, weeks before Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych, had even fled Kiev.
[00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:51.905]  So they were planning this weeks in advance.
[00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:55.489]  Now back in December, around the same time that top U.S.
[00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.331]  diplomat Victoria Nuland announced that the U.S.
[00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:08.901]  had invested $5 billion to help Ukrainians achieve a new form of government, Senator John McCain met with Svoboda party leader Oleg Tyanabok
[00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:16.370]  And they shared the same stage at an event during which McCain gave the United States blessing for the opposition revolt.
[00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:26.924]  As recently as three weeks ago, Nuland met with both Tiana Bak and Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who is now Ukraine's interim prime minister.
[00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:42.840]  And in a leaked phone conversation that we played on InfoWars.com, again, Nuland was caught red-handed scheming to install Yatsenyuk in the government before President Viktor Yanukovych had even fled Kiev.
[00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:50.228]  So we can definitely see the New World Order banks or motives going on there to set up this EU puppet government.
[00:04:50.888 --> 00:05:02.831]  Now Yatsenyuk's history as a banker makes him the perfect candidate to help assume this role of technocrat and give over, you know, sell the Ukraine into the IMF debt slavery.
[00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:07.512]  And according to Zero Hedge, they report today, it's already begun.
[00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:12.654]  The annexation of the country's banking system by a benevolent Europe is complete.
[00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:26.282]  Ukraine's National Bank has imposed temporary limits to withdraw money from foreign currency deposits to sums equivalent to no more than what would amount to about $1,500 a day, also known as capital controls.
[00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:33.886]  Now, Ukraine's currency is crashing at a record pace, and so they'll limit the amount of foreign currency in circulation.
[00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:42.331]  The people there are, of course, able to withdraw as much of the country's currency as they wish, because the country can just print up as much as they want to.
[00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:57.402]  So, in summary, first the banks are going to abdicate their control to a pro-European central bank, and now the citizens face the first of many capital controls, which will simply aggravate the fund outflow even more.
[00:05:57.422 --> 00:06:08.651]  It's going to lead to an even faster drop in foreign reserves, and then they report that we will see inflation and a counter-coup, much like we saw happen in Egypt.
[00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:16.534]  Now today on the Alex Jones Show, Joel Skousen came on and he offered an alternative angle to what's happening in the Ukraine.
[00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:18.775]  I highly recommend you check that out.
[00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:25.698]  What he had to say was that the Russians aren't just so innocent as we might seem, that they might have a little bit more
[00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:50.437]  Going on it might not be as simple as just the EU and Soros in there But perhaps the Russians manufactured this crisis as well as well Sent some fake Ukrainians in to take over this actual authentic Ukrainian uprising because no doubt the people there are well and truly tired of being controlled by Russian corruption
[00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:58.226]  So I definitely highly recommend that you check out that interview with Joel Skousen today on the Alex Jones Show if you're interested in what's going on in the Ukraine.
[00:06:58.246 --> 00:06:59.648]  It gives a different angle.
[00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:02.651]  It's complicated, very complicated.
[00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.694]  So that's a really, really good interview.
[00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:10.741]  But now for a bit of hilarity coming out of our own country and our bumbling
[00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:11.962]  TSA.
[00:07:12.523 --> 00:07:26.601]  A liberal blogger was detained by the TSA after he had opted out of a body scanner and the official word for why they were detaining him, the TSA agent said, we saw Bitcoin in your bag and we need to check it.
[00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:33.588]  Well, anyone who is living under a rock, Bitcoin is a virtual currency.
[00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:36.391]  It does not exist in physical form.
[00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:51.285]  So this man, Barker, he's a co-founder of Bitcoin Not Bombs, and he says that it must have been either clothing or promotional lapel pins for his Bitcoin Not Bombs in his bag that prompted the curiosity from the TSA screeners.
[00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:57.550]  Barker says, obviously the TSA has been trained, although poorly, to look for Bitcoin.
[00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:04.814]  When they saw all the metal lapel pins in my bag, they probably thought they hit the jackpot on a stockpile of coins.
[00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:11.318]  Whatever training they had, it probably included that stock photo of brass tokens that everyone uses.
[00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:18.403]  My evasiveness only quickened their bloodlust as they imagined a big bust and possibly
[00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:22.666]  A free pizza and soda in the break room.
[00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:33.312]  So apparently in addition to catching terrorists, the TSA is also trying to stop virtual money laundering there in the airport.
[00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:39.376]  But in true Dick Johnston wonderkind fashion, another TSA moment.
[00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:47.962]  A woman reported that a TSA agent in Phoenix didn't think her Washington, D.C.-issued driver's license was valid for flight.
[00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:57.268]  According to the woman, an agent with the TSA took a look at her DC license and began to shake her head and said, I don't know if we can accept these.
[00:08:57.528 --> 00:08:58.529]  Do you have a U.S.
[00:08:58.609 --> 00:08:59.210]  passport?
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.262]  The issue here is that the district is not a state.
[00:09:04.662 --> 00:09:10.026]  The TSA requires a state-issued ID in order to fly.
[00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:14.088]  Everyone, the entire population of D.C.
[00:09:14.468 --> 00:09:16.630]  has to use their D.C.
[00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.291]  driver's licenses to fly.
[00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:20.012]  So that's incredible.
[00:09:20.052 --> 00:09:27.836]  Now, while I do think that this is hilarious because it means that all of our D.C.-based politicians are going to be put on the no-fly list,
[00:09:29.017 --> 00:09:34.302]  These are the brainiacs that are being trained to harass you while you travel.
[00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:37.386]  So, that's amazing.
[00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:40.409]  Can't wait for my next trip out of the country.
[00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:52.341]  Now, in California, a federal court has denied the First Amendment, saying a school has the right to suppress the First Amendment in the name of safety.
[00:09:52.981 --> 00:10:00.647]  During the Mexican Cinco de Mayo holiday, students wearing American flag t-shirts were asked to turn them inside out.
[00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:14.497]  They took that case to court and the court said that fears of racial violence by students outraged over the American flag displayed on these t-shirts outweighed the right guaranteed by the Constitution.
[00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:27.101]  One of the judges there said, our role is not to second-guess the decision to have a Cinco de Mayo celebration, and whether that would be offensive, or the precautions put in place to avoid violence.
[00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:37.943]  The racial issues unrelated to the Bill of Rights made it reasonable for school officials to proceed as though the threat of a potentially violent disturbance was real.
[00:10:38.403 --> 00:10:41.684]  So just the threat of violence, potential violence,
[00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:42.985]  I think so.
[00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:06.082]  So what do you all think about that ruling?
[00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:07.243]  Do you think that that was right?
[00:11:07.263 --> 00:11:11.466]  Do you think they should never have had a Cinco de Mayo party in the first place?
[00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:15.268]  Do you think these kids should have been allowed to wear their American flag t-shirt?
[00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:22.272]  Do you think that the court needed to get involved and the school is right to say that safety trumps the Bill of Rights?
[00:11:23.373 --> 00:11:30.538]  If you have an opinion on that, and I'm sure you do, please leave your comments below this video on YouTube and let's get a discussion going.
[00:11:31.517 --> 00:11:37.891]  Now, coming up after the break, John Bowne and I took to the streets of 6th Street, Austin.
[00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:39.174]  It's a notoriously
[00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:49.154]  Lined with bar after bar, and we met up with some really amazing American geniuses out there.
[00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:57.315]  Same kind that we meet on our average man on the street, but these folks had been partaking in the truth serum.
[00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:05.697]  So we went out there to find out if there is indeed any hope for America, and hilarity ensued.
[00:12:06.357 --> 00:12:07.857]  So stick around, that's coming right up.
[00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:22.139]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:29.587]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:32.870]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.892]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:12:35.132 --> 00:12:39.696]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:12:39.776 --> 00:12:42.558]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:48.483]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:52.147]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:12:52.347 --> 00:12:57.391]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[00:14:28.257 --> 00:14:29.818]  Special assignment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:30.398 --> 00:14:31.659]  Looking for the true patriots.
[00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:33.500]  Is the knowledge still alive and well?
[00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.963]  In the party scene on 6th Street in Austin, Texas.
[00:14:38.283 --> 00:14:41.125]  Can you name all seven continents of the Earth?
[00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:43.167]  Of the Earth?
[00:14:43.747 --> 00:14:53.073]  So there's Asia, Africa, South America, North America, Europe, Antarctica,
[00:14:55.447 --> 00:14:57.709]  South... no, wait.
[00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.372]  Oh yeah, Australia's my continent, is it?
[00:15:01.712 --> 00:15:03.394]  Asia?
[00:15:03.854 --> 00:15:04.515]  America?
[00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:06.577]  South America?
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:10.940]  Japan?
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.721]  Hong Kong?
[00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:13.383]  You know, Canada?
[00:15:13.403 --> 00:15:15.124]  You know, Africa?
[00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:16.365]  Three of the Bill of Rights?
[00:15:19.948 --> 00:15:22.591]  That would be... Man, you are picking a hard night for me.
[00:15:23.902 --> 00:15:25.403]  Can you name the vice president?
[00:15:26.604 --> 00:15:27.064]  Dick Cheney?
[00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:28.205]  John Boehner.
[00:15:29.827 --> 00:15:34.270]  Was John Adams allergic to the peanuts on Air Force One?
[00:15:35.531 --> 00:15:35.871]  Yes.
[00:15:36.712 --> 00:15:36.972]  Yes.
[00:15:38.013 --> 00:15:38.413]  He was.
[00:15:38.473 --> 00:15:39.574]  I think that's how he died.
[00:15:39.594 --> 00:15:40.114]  Really?
[00:15:40.415 --> 00:15:41.215]  Yeah, the peanuts.
[00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:41.936]  That's tragic.
[00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:44.174]  It is.
[00:15:44.895 --> 00:15:48.356]  Somebody should have been on board making sure, you know, eating the peanuts before he did.
[00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:50.037]  Man, may I could do?
[00:15:50.858 --> 00:15:51.278]  Hot!
[00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:54.120]  Everybody knows that!
[00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:57.802]  You remember when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
[00:15:59.883 --> 00:15:57.802]  1941?
[00:16:00.123 --> 00:16:03.665]  The journey to find some red-blooded Americans continues.
[00:16:04.545 --> 00:16:06.646]  When we fought Hitler, what war was that?
[00:16:06.987 --> 00:16:07.747]  World War II.
[00:16:08.988 --> 00:16:09.728]  Thank you very much.
[00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:10.669]  You're a true patriot.
[00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:12.009]  Of course I am.
[00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.710]  I'm an American.
[00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:12.990]  Are you?
[00:16:15.468 --> 00:16:20.321]  John Adams, was he allergic to the peanuts on Air Force One?
[00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:22.166]  No.
[00:16:22.908 --> 00:16:23.209]  No?
[00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:23.570]  No.
[00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:29.042]  You finished, but no, that's not my understanding of how he died.
[00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:40.171]  Well, we've had some very interesting responses out here mingling with the drunk and brainless, but the jury is still out on whether or not there is any hope for humanity.

[00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:53.802]  Info Wars!
[00:17:10.686 --> 00:17:16.273]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:17:16.473 --> 00:17:23.701]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:27.065]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:29.006]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:17:29.247 --> 00:17:33.810]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.672]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:42.597]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:46.240]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.483]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:17:51.683 --> 00:17:54.726]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:54.926 --> 00:18:00.790]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.871]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.643]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:18:24.763 --> 00:18:30.767]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:41.754]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[00:19:21.735 --> 00:19:23.380]  Well, what's going on in the Ukraine?
[00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:26.568]  Certainly the State Department is playing a very dangerous game.
[00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:37.620]  We had Victoria Nuland place a call on an unsecured line to the Ukrainian ambassador in the midst of all this unrest and made very, very provocative statements.
[00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:44.044]  As Dr. Petchenik said, it was just out there to taunt the Russians, to taunt the Europeans.
[00:19:44.524 --> 00:19:51.848]  We also see bankers who are now moving in for the kill, offering $35 billion to the Ukraine country, trying to get them on the hook.
[00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:55.867]  But do the Ukrainian people really understand that?
[00:19:55.887 --> 00:19:59.068]  Do the American people understand what's going on with the Federal Reserve?
[00:19:59.088 --> 00:20:02.650]  Do most of the Americans really understand how the bankers are controlling this country?
[00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:09.132]  Well, there is one organization I wanted to talk to, and that was the Ukraine Gun Owners Association.
[00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:14.234]  Because on their site, in English, they do understand that the crux of the issue
[00:20:14.794 --> 00:20:15.174]  I think so.
[00:20:36.044 --> 00:20:42.586]  Something recognizing the inherent right of the people to keep and bear arms, to see that right recognized by their government.
[00:20:42.606 --> 00:20:48.547]  We're going to see what the status of that is, see what the status of firearms in the Ukraine are, and talk to him about the recent troubles.
[00:20:50.548 --> 00:20:56.989]  Tell me what the current legal status is of the right to keep and bear arms and what practical obstacles are.
[00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:01.551]  You were just telling me as we were talking off the air that there's an embargo of European arms.
[00:21:04.065 --> 00:21:10.430]  Tell me, please, what are the statuses of legal possession of arms in Ukraine now?
[00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:15.954]  And how does this position apply to a large number of European arms manufacturers?
[00:21:16.014 --> 00:21:18.336]  Good afternoon, first of all.
[00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:19.036]  Look, in Ukraine
[00:21:27.126 --> 00:21:30.629]  There is no law concerning weapons in Ukraine at all.
[00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:52.340]  All the weapons, all the heavy weapons in the Ukraine, there is only concerning internal affairs and internal laws, which we have in Ukraine, in local situations.
[00:22:07.257 --> 00:22:12.001]  Accordingly, at any time the Ministry of Internal Affairs can change the rules of the game.
[00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:13.582]  That is, no one can forbid them to do so.
[00:22:13.602 --> 00:22:18.767]  Today we can wake up and find out that the magazines in our rifles should have a maximum capacity of 10 rounds.
[00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:36.218]  Anytime we can wait for the changes from the Ministry of Internal Affairs concerning this law.
[00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:48.010]  So one day we can wake up and know that the magazines in our rifles will have only three rounds or five rounds at all.
[00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:50.031]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:22:50.071 --> 00:23:00.519]  When you say that there is no law, are you saying that there's no law that protects your right to keep arms, or are you saying there's no law that prohibits anything?
[00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:03.622]  Are you allowed to keep arms now under the current law?
[00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:32.102]  Ukraine has no law at all concerning people with weapons and weapons in general.
[00:23:33.055 --> 00:23:38.118]  So you are free to have weapons and the Ukrainian people do have firearms, is that correct?
[00:23:39.219 --> 00:23:48.584]  Am I right that Ukrainians have the right and they are free to buy this weapon and carry it and keep it?
[00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:55.468]  We can buy weapons, but the weapons that are on the list are hunting rifles and rifles.
[00:23:55.528 --> 00:23:58.189]  We do not have the right to buy pistols.
[00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:08.852]  The Ministry of Foreign and Internal Affairs allows us to buy only the shotguns and hunting carbines, except pistols and revolvers.
[00:24:20.436 --> 00:24:20.736]  I see.
[00:24:21.137 --> 00:24:31.405]  So what you're trying to do, and we've seen your English language site, and we know that what you're trying to do is to get them to establish the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
[00:24:31.905 --> 00:24:37.350]  We see that in America as a test of whether or not the government trusts the people.
[00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:45.136]  Is there a political party there that you think is going to support the right to keep and bear arms being put in the Constitution?
[00:24:46.647 --> 00:24:51.750]  What does it look like from our point of view?
[00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.532]  How can our partners help us in this situation?
[00:24:55.672 --> 00:25:02.235]  Do we have a political force in Ukraine that can help us change these laws on weapons?
[00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:18.201]  Now we have only one political force which supports our weaponry initiative and law.
[00:25:18.241 --> 00:25:19.321]  This is the Party of Freedom.
[00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:40.368]  Other forces have their waiting position, which is very unstable in the
[00:26:06.688 --> 00:26:15.591]  This time, when people were shot directly in the center of the capital of Ukraine, in the center of Europe.
[00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:23.853]  We understand that if this time we don't really demand, give us the right that someone illegally took from us, we will never be able to do it.
[00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:26.254]  And such a situation can inevitably happen.
[00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:44.536]  So, till we will wait for the moment which we will ask for somebody to change these laws concerning the weapon.
[00:26:45.517 --> 00:26:52.623]  So, if we will not do these changes, nobody will do these changes at all.
[00:26:53.344 --> 00:26:56.166]  Ukrainians have paid for their right to own arms with rivers of blood.
[00:27:08.362 --> 00:27:11.282]  Let me ask you about the conflict there.
[00:27:11.322 --> 00:27:22.985]  When we saw video pictures, most of what we saw were people fighting in the streets with improvised weapons, hand-to-hand with clubs and shields, the reports of sniper fire.
[00:27:23.706 --> 00:27:24.206]  What's your
[00:27:24.986 --> 00:27:28.088]  First of all, you are people who fight with improvised weapons, with bullets and shields.
[00:27:45.636 --> 00:27:50.280]  And we saw the use of sniper weapons from one side.
[00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:52.742]  How can you comment on this situation?
[00:27:57.764 --> 00:28:02.065]  So, the Ukrainians have quite a lot of weapons
[00:28:26.222 --> 00:28:38.585]  And by their own, but we didn't accept that the situation will go out of control.
[00:28:38.605 --> 00:28:51.808]  We didn't even expect this situation, that police will use firearms against people with improvised slugs and chutes.
[00:28:53.732 --> 00:29:09.869]  Let me ask you then, you said that basically the current status of firearms, just to clarify, because I have a little bit of issues with the translations, just to clarify, right now you predominantly just have hunting weapons that you're allowed to have, is that correct?
[00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:14.294]  And did you say that you were allowed to have pistols or not allowed to have pistols legally?
[00:29:15.939 --> 00:29:26.404]  Tell me, please, to make a conclusion, that we can own only hunting weapons, without any pistols, revolvers, etc.?
[00:29:26.424 --> 00:29:28.264]  There is a problem with that.
[00:29:28.284 --> 00:29:34.787]  Ukrainians can buy hunting rifles and hunting guns, but they can't carry pistols and revolvers with them.
[00:29:43.011 --> 00:29:58.142]  People can only buy hunting weapons and no pistols and revolvers at all.
[00:29:58.623 --> 00:30:08.270]  And movement in the city with Kalashnikovs, with the civilian version of Kalashnikov, it's not useful.
[00:30:09.264 --> 00:30:09.544]  Okay.
[00:30:09.944 --> 00:30:17.548]  Let me ask you to give us your perspective on why it's important for the people to have the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:30:18.309 --> 00:30:19.109]  Give us your plea.
[00:30:19.129 --> 00:30:26.293]  Tell us, please, what are the perspectives for people who want to own such weapons?
[00:30:27.453 --> 00:30:38.819]  Today, the attention of the entire Ukrainian arms community, and not only, we have support from Europe and, as I understand, from America,
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.223]  For now we're rather close to our law which will allow us to carry any weapon with the support of European colleagues and American also.
[00:30:45.263 --> 00:30:50.445]  We need just a little push, a little support to have this problem solved.
[00:31:08.883 --> 00:31:15.745]  Now we are very close to solving this problem, but we want people from abroad to do some things.
[00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:41.970]  First of all, we would like you to at least somehow prove to the producers that importers have taken a position that completely ignores our activities.
[00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:46.233]  They do not take part, they do not help us in the fight, not by word, not by deed.
[00:31:52.543 --> 00:32:10.286]  First, we want you to inform people that importance of the weapon, have their position with any, absolutely with no protection and help us in this situation.
[00:32:11.021 --> 00:32:14.764]  Also, we want you to inform people that this embargo, which had
[00:32:36.427 --> 00:32:45.594]  I would, of course, appeal to Barack Obama to help us get out of this situation with democracy.
[00:32:45.634 --> 00:32:52.459]  But I understand that he is not a supporter of armed violence in the population.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:11.187]  Of course, I would ask Barack Obama to help us with this problem, but now I see that he is not very fond of weapon, and also he cannot solve this problem.
[00:33:11.387 --> 00:33:16.731]  Yeah, that's kind of an understatement that Obama doesn't like the idea of citizens having arms.
[00:33:16.831 --> 00:33:18.792]  We're having to fight him for that right here.
[00:33:18.812 --> 00:33:26.357]  Today, with the fact that Barack Obama doesn't have a weapon, I want to warn all the communities.
[00:33:26.837 --> 00:33:28.298]  We will start on our own terms.
[00:33:29.185 --> 00:33:42.629]  I want to tell all the Americans that if someone will take away your weapon, in 20 years you will become Ukrainians and your power will shoot you in the middle of your city, just on the street.
[00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.470]  Yes, yes.
[00:33:55.931 --> 00:33:56.911]  We definitely believe that.
[00:33:57.512 --> 00:34:00.273]  Well, I just want to have one follow-up question.
[00:34:00.473 --> 00:34:06.016]  In your opinion, as we see pressure building up, what do you think is going to happen in the Crimea?
[00:34:06.717 --> 00:34:10.379]  Is Russia going to occupy that, split it off from the Ukraine?
[00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:11.940]  What do you think is going to happen with that?
[00:34:22.096 --> 00:34:29.738]  From now, none of the Ukrainian political powers can tell this annexation or occupation.
[00:34:46.841 --> 00:34:53.003]  This is quite an unpleasant situation.
[00:34:53.043 --> 00:35:00.446]  We also have known that Russia were involving somehow to the situation on the Maidan.
[00:35:21.106 --> 00:35:27.751]  We think that Russia has enough of her own problems.
[00:35:28.411 --> 00:35:36.037]  Russia is struggling from the separatist movements inside Russia.
[00:35:36.357 --> 00:35:39.619]  So we want Russia to solve their own problems.
[00:35:47.043 --> 00:35:51.165]  They have Siberia, which is strictly connected with China.
[00:35:51.885 --> 00:35:55.127]  They have Kuril Islands.
[00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:56.768]  They have also Ural Mountains.
[00:35:57.388 --> 00:36:02.250]  People of this area call them, not Russians, but Uralian peoples.
[00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:41.301]  Russia has a number of their own problems, the separatical things, and they also have Ural, Caucasus, or Siberia, Kurilin Islands, so it's enough problems to solve directly in Russia without taking part in the Ukrainian events.
[00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:43.942]  Yes, we feel that way about our government as well.
[00:36:43.982 --> 00:36:51.404]  We feel like they have enough problems here domestically that they don't need to get involved in every conflict around the world, but they do it anyway.
[00:36:51.424 --> 00:37:01.887]  America has the same problem, that they have a lot of conflicts in the country, but at least the government
[00:37:07.138 --> 00:37:19.407]  I hope I don't need to comment this.
[00:37:20.168 --> 00:37:20.388]  Yes.
[00:37:20.768 --> 00:37:26.893]  Well, let me ask you what you would like to say to the American people in closing about the Ukrainian revolution.
[00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:31.797]  Let me ask you, what can you say to the American people regarding... Our revolution?
[00:37:31.817 --> 00:37:35.158]  Yes, yes, our revolution and the situation as a whole.
[00:37:35.178 --> 00:37:40.620]  You know, today we're actually looking at what's left of the Soviet Union.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.521]  That part of the communist system.
[00:37:52.188 --> 00:38:04.578]  In fact, we see now how dies this part of the communist period, which we are having left from the Soviet epoch.
[00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:07.641]  Ukrainians have changed.
[00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:09.923]  They want to build a new Ukraine on their own.
[00:38:09.943 --> 00:38:17.129]  They don't need these scoundrels, thieves, these criminals who have been in power for 22 years.
[00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:24.198]  Ukrainians have changed.
[00:38:25.418 --> 00:38:35.764]  They don't want to have these criminals helping them with their rules.
[00:38:36.444 --> 00:38:38.806]  So they will build Ukraine by their own.
[00:38:41.226 --> 00:38:43.407]  I want you to know that the Ukrainians love each other.
[00:38:43.427 --> 00:38:47.950]  It doesn't matter from the south and from the north where we are, from the west and from the east.
[00:38:48.051 --> 00:38:51.573]  And mostly we love each other when we have a weapon in our hands.
[00:39:09.144 --> 00:39:23.420]  Yes, well, we wish you, we hope that you can achieve liberty and true independence, and if you've got a government that recognizes your right to protect yourself and keep and bear arms, then you will have a legitimate government.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.363]  That'll be the test to see whether you've got it.
[00:39:26.684 --> 00:39:27.965]  We wish you success in that.
[00:39:28.386 --> 00:39:29.407]  Thank you for talking to us.
[00:39:30.682 --> 00:39:31.283]  Thank you so much.
[00:39:31.303 --> 00:39:32.083]  Thank you.
[00:39:32.123 --> 00:39:32.543]  Thank you.
[00:39:32.563 --> 00:39:33.764]  Bye bye.
[00:39:33.784 --> 00:39:34.164]  Best of luck.
[00:39:34.184 --> 00:39:35.345]  Best of luck to you.
[00:39:51.496 --> 00:39:54.158]  Well, that was the Ukrainian Gun Owners Association.
[00:39:54.699 --> 00:40:03.927]  And on their site, in English, much of it is in Cyrillic, but in English, we could see many quotes about the right to keep and bear arms and the fact that if you don't have it, you're slaves.
[00:40:03.967 --> 00:40:05.648]  And you heard him say that in the interview.
[00:40:06.009 --> 00:40:06.809]  He understands that.
[00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:07.970]  That's why I wanted to talk to him.
[00:40:08.991 --> 00:40:12.075]  It's difficult to get a fix on what's going on there.
[00:40:12.115 --> 00:40:15.219]  We certainly know what's going on at the level between the U.S.
