[00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:27.827]  I'm going to tell you about a mission that I went on where the Taliban pretty much almost overran this mountain peak that we were on.
[00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:32.689]  We had maybe 16, 17 guys and they had a couple hundred.
[00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:34.390]  It was a pretty crazy time.
[00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.833]  So I'm back at my little district center, my DC, and we're heading out.
[00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:49.998]  We lived maybe a 45 minute drive away from the border only because we have to go 25 miles an hour through IED infested roads.
[00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.127]  So we get out there and get up this hill.
[00:00:54.468 --> 00:01:06.294]  When you get up this mountain, we drive up this mountain, it's mind-blowing as to how small the road is compared to how wide the MRAP is, the Humvees and all that that we have out there.
[00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:20.741]  Literally, this much of your tire is hanging off like a cliff and just rocks are falling down and you're like sitting there in the turret looking over and you're like, oh my god, I mean, I'm going to die before I even make it up here to ambush the Taliban.
[00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:24.965]  So I always hated that ride up that freaking hill.
[00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:29.408]  We get up there and we set up our firing points all up and down the mountain.
[00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:38.973]  The way the mountain ran was a hilltop and then the Pakistani mountains were right here all just surrounding us.
[00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:40.294]  So you had the north side
[00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:50.920]  It was a north-to-south run on that mountain, and we had HESCO barriers that were set up, so you only had small avenues you could go to to get to these different firing points.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:03.769]  And the Taliban knew that in previous times before this, they set up guns so they could shoot down those areas, because they know we would have to run up to get more ammo, things like that, supplies.
[00:02:05.103 --> 00:02:14.414]  So we get up there, we set in, we dig in, we start filling sandbags, get our security area set up, our perimeter, all the firing points set up, the .50 Cals, the Mark 19s, and .240 Bravos.
[00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:20.804]  And, you know, day turns to night.
[00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:27.629]  We start shooting off some flares, hoping that that'll trigger some kind of response from the Taliban, because we know they come through there.
[00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:33.513]  We know that's a huge supply route from Pakistan back into Afghanistan in this ravine across the way.
[00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:35.474]  So all night we stay up.
[00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:36.015]  We don't sleep.
[00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:39.277]  We're sitting there waiting because we think, all right, at any second these guys are going to start attacking us.
[00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:40.818]  Nothing happens.
[00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:42.680]  It's daytime.
[00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:47.082]  Morning comes through and we're like, screw it, nothing happened, let's go ahead and break everything down.
[00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:49.205]  So we start breaking down our firing points.
[00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:57.317]  As soon as the last weapon got taken down, I was standing on the back of the flatbed and people were handing up the ammo crates and the guns to me.
[00:02:57.638 --> 00:02:59.460]  As soon as that last gun got brought to my truck,
[00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:08.465]  Friggin an airburst went off right over a head and I dropped and hit the ground and I'm sitting like holding my money on my ears With my hands like this and I'm sitting like alright.
[00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:09.226]  I'm checking myself.
[00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:21.672]  I'm like alright What the hell's going on and next thing you know you just hear gunfire from freaking everywhere You know there's just things blowing there's rocks flying all over the place and people are just running around like what the hell's going on So you start throwing the guns back off the truck.
[00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:22.412]  I'm like alright, man.
[00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:23.613]  We got to get the hell out of here Let's go.
[00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:28.015]  Let's go so we get up the hill and we start dishing out the weapons and
[00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:33.060]  And it takes about five to six minutes, it seems like a lifetime to get all this set back up.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:42.043]  We get it all set up, and since I was the Staff Sergeant, I have to go around and check on the different fighting spots.
[00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:49.305]  So during this friggin' battle, I'm checking real quick to make sure everyone's set up good before I engage myself.
[00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:58.568]  So I never forget this one point where I'm at the south part of the mountain where the trucks are and all that, and I'm checking all of them in there.
[00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:10.656]  Then I have to go to the north side and I have to go through this little narrow passageway where there's HESCO barriers that are about six foot tall, full of sand, and I'm sitting here leaning against this HESCO wall.
[00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:19.309]  Like in this little divot and bullets are just whizzing by my chest and I'm doing everything I can to just like hold my breath so a bullet doesn't catch me at all.
[00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.917]  The slightest, you know, breathe, you know, breath in, my chest would expand and then end up catching one of those freaking rounds whizzing by my chest.
[00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:29.698]  So I'm sitting there like, you know, counting.
[00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:31.380]  I'm like, all right, please hurry up, reload, reload.
[00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:34.282]  Weapon stops, boom, start running up.
[00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:42.017]  You know, I get about 10-15 seconds, stop again, and I'm leaned against this wall, and there's just bullets, you can see the tracers just whizzing by.
[00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:45.400]  You know, and you're just sitting there holding on for dear life, like, what the hell's going on?
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.605]  So, I finally get up to the northern checkpoint, to where I need to be, and I'm able to start laying down suppressive fire as well.
[00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:55.648]  I mean, we're shooting out Mark 19s, we've got
[00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.771]  Chinese rockets coming in.
[00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.934]  I mean they are mortaring us.
[00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:03.377]  There's heavy weapons fire, small arms fire.
[00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:05.159]  I mean it is nuts.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.668]  RPGs are coming in all over the place and it was just completely total chaos like the apocalypse was happening.
[00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:33.058]  It was just so nuts to be sitting there and all you see are just, you know, these tracers just whizzing by you non-stop and every second you're saying things like, you know, alright, I'm doing my job, I'm shooting, I'm shooting and you know, you see something just whiz right by your face and you can feel the air sometimes of it whizzing by and you're like, oh my god, that was close.
[00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:39.583]  You know, and you can't help it not, you know, your life kind of flashes before you real quick and you're sitting there like, you know, what the hell's going on?
[00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:41.785]  Next thing you know, it's just dead silence.
[00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:45.412]  And we're just sitting there looking around, and I'm like checking myself.
[00:05:45.472 --> 00:05:48.513]  I'm like, my adrenaline's going so much, my heart's pounding.
[00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:50.093]  I'm like, I'm probably shot somewhere.
[00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:56.236]  You know, we all check each other, and it quietens down for a minute.
[00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:00.997]  Then the rocket fire starts coming in again, and we're sitting there like, all right, you know, what are we going to do?
[00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:08.680]  So we get on the radio, and we call in for a fire mission to some M777 Alpha II howitzers that are about 16, 17 miles behind us.
[00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:13.758]  So we're sitting there calling in fire missions.
[00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.200]  We've got these huge 105, 109 pound bullets coming over our head, these rounds.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.980]  And they're just raining steel down into this valley, just whizzing over our head.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.842]  And then we have the little birds, the coyotes, they start coming in and doing gun runs with the Hellfire missiles into the sides of the mountain.
[00:06:31.862 --> 00:06:36.243]  I mean, you're talking about sitting there and hearing splash.
[00:06:36.743 --> 00:06:41.404]  And you're just waiting for that artillery gun to explode and just like.
[00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:43.766]  And the whole ground is shaking.
[00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:50.928]  And you're sitting there thinking, if these guys are off one mil, one mil from that far back, that can be them taking us out.
[00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:56.730]  That's one of the scariest things to be that close, danger close to the freaking rounds coming in over your head.
[00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.032]  You could hear the overhead and then hitting the ground and just seeing the mountain explode.
[00:07:03.512 --> 00:07:07.273]  It was one of the craziest days of my life to experience that.
[00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:08.713]  It was so mind blowing.
[00:07:10.094 --> 00:07:10.294]  And, uh,
[00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:34.641]  It's just one of those things I mean we got lucky no one got hurt that day but it's just one of those you know that someone was looking out for you because that much going on that fast that intense that you know everything just turned to hell in seconds and luckily you know we were able to make it out of there you know unhurt but it was one of the craziest experiences of my life.
[00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:40.113]  And it haunts me to this day because I can still hear that explosion over my head.
[00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.794]  And I'm sitting there dropping to the truck and I'm like checking myself.
[00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:45.135]  I'm like, oh my god, am I still here?
[00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:48.396]  I just wanted to share that experience with you guys.
[00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:50.656]  I'm Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, U.S.
