[00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:04.152]  So you like seeing people carrying around guns?
[00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:05.253]  Hell yeah, dude.
[00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:05.713]  Texas.
[00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.575]  I'm not a Republican, but god damn, I love guns.
[00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:09.295]  Are you from here?
[00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:09.776]  Yeah.
[00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.177]  Texas, born and raised.
[00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.617]  I believe in guns.
[00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:17.781]  What do I think of it?
[00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:21.743]  I think it's great.
[00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:28.908]  I think the Constitution guarantees everyone the right to, you know, be at arms with conditions.
[00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:29.989]  However,
[00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:42.579]  We have to be mindful of the people who are getting these guns, and they are properly trained, and they are not mentally disturbed when they're carrying these guns.
[00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:57.107]  One thing I saw a couple of days ago, as I was leaving South By, was an armored tanker that was, it said APD on the side, and it was blue and black, and there was a police officer with the door open and a battering ram on the side of it.
[00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.129]  How the f*** are they gonna treat us like
[00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:02.016]  This is Austin.
[00:01:02.036 --> 00:01:03.839]  Nobody does anything back here.
[00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.404]  I just wanted to ask you, do you work for Blackwater?
[00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:07.644]  No.
[00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:08.245]  You don't?
[00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:08.385]  No.
[00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:10.508]  I don't even have your camera.
[00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:12.130]  Okay, just where's the hat?
[00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.234]  You don't work for Blackwater.
[00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:15.995]  Do I what?
[00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:17.956]  Do you like the fact that they're open carrying right now?
[00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:18.937]  Oh, I love it.
[00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:21.519]  I love this crazy woman that thinks she can protest.
[00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:22.479]  Yes!
[00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.180]  I love InfoWars so much.
[00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:25.822]  Alex Jones is my favorite.
[00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:26.862]  You guys are awesome.
[00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:27.463]  Where are you from?
[00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:28.804]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[00:01:28.824 --> 00:01:29.624]  I live in Houston.
[00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:30.224]  Houston?
[00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:30.845]  Right on.
[00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:31.345]  Yeah.
[00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:32.546]  Alright, Houston Freethinkers.
[00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:33.607]  Alright, cool.
[00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:34.067]  Take care.
[00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:46.771]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.333]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:59.342]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
