[00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:04.693]  This is Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:07.015]  We just got news of a state of emergency.
[00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:12.359]  This is Executive Order 1414 signed by Governor Nixon.
[00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:22.866]  And it says, Governor Nixon of the state of Missouri, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution, and it says, I hereby declare a state of emergency exists in the state of Missouri.
[00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:26.389]  And also, he's going to have the Missouri State Highway Patrol together with the St.
[00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.610]  Louis County Police Department
[00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.190]  I think so.
[00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.764]  Rubber bullets, tear gas, aiming guns at people in the crowd.
[00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:52.328]  I had a chance to speak to the police chief the last time I was here, and he said, yeah, we made some mistakes.
[00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:53.369]  We'll do some adjustments.
[00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:55.351]  It looks like they're back up to bat.
[00:00:55.731 --> 00:01:00.095]  So we'll see what happens, if those changes are going to be made, if they're going to make any difference.
[00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:03.939]  Of course, you know, we're waiting to hear what's going to happen with Officer Darren Wilson.
[00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:04.899]  Is he going to be indicted?
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.801]  We were at the courthouse earlier today.
[00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.444]  There was a protest, I guess about 50 people or so,
[00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.765]  We're out there, and you know, they just want to find out what happened to Mike.
[00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:29.031]  You know, of course we hear a lot about the violent protesters, the rioters, the looters, the people threatening to come in and burn down the city to loot and pillage and all that stuff, but you can't forget that you also have peaceful protesters, peaceful demonstrators, and they're being very much overshadowed by all this threat of violence.
[00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:30.592]  So we hear about these guys.
[00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:33.133]  Also, DHS has trucks in the vicinity.
[00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.394]  We've been told by military sources we've lost his job because of
[00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:38.355]  So stay tuned to InfoWars.com
