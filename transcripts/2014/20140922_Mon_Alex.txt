[00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:07.698]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:09.459]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.220]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.800]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.341]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.544]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:55.011]  Well, the White House says the intruders that have tried to sneak in, one dressed up like a Pokemon character, the other a veteran, a homeless veteran, did not mean any harm, but nevertheless, the Secret Service is being quoted today by the Associated Press saying, snipers, guards, fences, not enough.
[00:00:55.011 --> 00:01:03.397]  Secret Service mulls security checkpoints down the roads from the White House, or internal checkpoints on the highways, on the roads around the White House.
[00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:06.485]  In Washington D.C.
[00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:11.188]  You only see stuff like that in North Korea.
[00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:14.510]  And I guess in like Turkmenistan or something.
[00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:24.276]  Of course, you only see black uniforms and cameras and checkpoints in a country that's been taken over by criminals.
[00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:27.958]  And folks will say, but ISIS is going to strike us.
[00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.259]  I got an article here where
[00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:34.359]  They stopped a plane, pulled people off, freaked out.
[00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:47.102]  Here's the headline, InfoWars.com, Feds Swarm Plane Interrogate Passenger Over Travel Group Logo That Resembled ISIS.
[00:01:47.102 --> 00:02:00.445]  So, they will freak out over something that clearly has nothing to do with Islamic radical terrorism, while our government arms the very rebels to fight the very rebels.
[00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:13.535]  So it's the schizophrenic government where they act like they're keeping you safe by taking your liberties while publicly funding the terrorists.
[00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:17.858]  Now that doesn't mean everyone in the government obviously is involved in this.
[00:02:17.858 --> 00:02:22.781]  You've got one hand trying to do something while the other hand's creating the crisis.
[00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.963]  But it's usually the low-level people that are trying to actually go after
[00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:30.975]  Extremist, terrorist, whatever you want to call it.
[00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:37.740]  And then it's the folks on top shepherding it, protecting it, opening the door for it.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.241]  So that's coming up today.
[00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:40.802]  Also, Obama's U.N.
[00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:47.087]  ambassador admits fighting against ISIS, designed to take out Assad in Syria.
[00:02:47.087 --> 00:02:54.533]  What an amazing admission that, well, we're going to arm the good rebel group so they can take out ISIS.
[00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.094]  And then what's that rebel group want to do?
[00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:57.075]  They want to take out Assad.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.325]  So it's so over-the-top deceptive, I have trouble even unraveling it, because it's so open.
[00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.547]  It's like a giant elephant in your living room.
[00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:13.011]  You open the door, your front door, and there's a giant elephant sitting there, and you can't speak.
[00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:18.396]  But it's obvious, it's over-the-top, it's ridiculous.
[00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:27.604]  This is the absurdist-ness, the absurdist nature of this makes it really hard to even fathom
[00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.879]  How ridiculous it is.
[00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.841]  But Senator Rand Paul and others are out there exposing it, and that is certainly a good thing.
[00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.782]  So we're going to talk about that as well.
[00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:43.644]  Also, UK's Cameron shifts tack.
[00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:46.065]  That's the way it's lying.
[00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:50.687]  UK's Cameron shifts tack like he's out sailing.
[00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:57.369]  And when you change positions 180 degrees, well, that's not lying.
[00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.730]  It's changing tack.
[00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:02.466]  He's tacking!
[00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:18.172]  Oh, that sounds kind of elegant and gentlemanly, and he should be wearing a little captain hat like Judge Smails, christening the boat the Flying Wasp, the flying wagon of horse manure.
[00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:19.973]  UK's Cameron Schiff's tack.
[00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:25.075]  They had promised that if they voted to stay in the UK, they would give new powers, and
[00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:32.147]  Demonstrated those, they had listed those, that the UK would turn loose of some of its powers.
[00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.149]  Now he says, no!
[00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:39.893]  I meant more powerful England!
[00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:45.618]  I mean, just incredible, the screw job that these people will carry out.
[00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.759]  But the public is ignorant.
[00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.838]  But then what were they going to do if they didn't stay in the UK?
[00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:55.142]  The socialists were going to loot Scotland, so you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.
[00:04:55.142 --> 00:04:56.603]  That's all coming up and a lot more.
[00:04:56.603 --> 00:05:01.347]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.347 --> 00:05:07.993]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:13.138]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:14.599]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:28.170]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.943]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:38.786]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:40.007]  Others don't.
[00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:42.149]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:43.950]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.832]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:53.458]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.160]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.522]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:05:58.522 --> 00:05:59.022]  Others don't.
[00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:02.032]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:07.014]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:09.675]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:09.675 --> 00:06:16.718]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:19.719]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.760]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.681]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.522]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:33.344]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:36.826]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:39.947]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:47.250]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.471]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:07:00.517 --> 00:07:04.661]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:09.204]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:15.730]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.713]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:21.375]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.338]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:34.203]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:42.308]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:07:42.308 --> 00:07:45.970]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.

[00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:55.301]  Infowarslight.com, Infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:16.837]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:16.837 --> 00:08:22.562]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:22.562 --> 00:08:35.652]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, already the 22nd day of September 2014.
[00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:41.597]  We are coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:51.305]  All right, I'm going to open the phones up in the first two and a half hours, interspersed with masses of news.
[00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:59.190]  We're not going to screen your phone calls, but I would specifically like to hear folks call in on a news topic, like Washington Journal does on C-SPAN.
[00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.491]  We do this occasionally.
[00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:03.793]  Or to have a question or a quick comment.
[00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:11.128]  Because if I have a lot of long-winded callers, I'll become long-winded, and we'll never get to a bunch of your calls.
[00:09:11.128 --> 00:09:21.431]  And for whatever reason, and I've had this discussion probably 200 times on air in the last 15 years, only my first four or five years on air was I good at taking calls.
[00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:27.333]  Whereas now I'm better at news analysis and even reading the news on air.
[00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:33.835]  I just cannot break the habit of A, not going to calls, or B, once I go to them,
[00:09:35.373 --> 00:09:40.176]  Just letting people ramble on pointlessly.
[00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:45.440]  Every time I say it's a specific topic and you can only call in about this, we have excellent callers.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.902]  Whenever I say it's a free-for-all, some of them are good, some of them are bad.
[00:09:48.902 --> 00:09:50.303]  And hey, the show's different.
[00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:51.844]  I don't like to screen calls.
[00:09:51.844 --> 00:09:58.889]  At the same time, though, I want to make sure your phone has good audio and that you're ready with your point or your question.
[00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:02.652]  In fact, just to break the mold and do it, I'm not even going to get into the news first.
[00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:11.237]  I'm just going to go to your phone calls first with your questions and your comments to just shake the show up.
[00:10:11.237 --> 00:10:16.741]  And that doesn't mean that the show you listen to every day and the show that you love will not be here tomorrow.
[00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:24.747]  It just means that I personally like taking more phone calls occasionally and just can't seem to make myself do it.
[00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:31.332]  So in the spirit of folks being able to get in who have never been able to get in on the show, first-time callers in this first hour,
[00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:48.145]  On Ron Paul's speech exposing the fact that our government's arming ISIS in Syria and saying that it's wrong, to climate change skeptics call out marchers, hypocrisy with huge buses, piles of garbage,
[00:10:49.235 --> 00:10:55.877]  They're claiming that consumption is bad, but really they just want to guilt you into accepting social engineering and more taxes.
[00:10:55.877 --> 00:11:00.138]  Very powerful video by PJTV.
[00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:06.440]  Robert F. Kennedy loses control at climate rally when they bring up what a hypocrite he is.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:13.882]  It's like these people that get preferential treatment in Austin and New York and other social engineering hubs.
[00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:14.702]  They'll have the front
[00:11:15.697 --> 00:11:17.898]  Parking spaces aren't even for handicapped now.
[00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:20.538]  It'll be for electric cars, and no one's ever parked in them.
[00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:24.799]  Because electric cars cost too much, and the equations have been done.
[00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:38.923]  They use as much as an average subcompact of the same basic design, as much energy or more from coal power plants, mainly.
[00:11:38.923 --> 00:11:42.284]  Because you lose a lot of the electricity once you transmit it down power lines.
[00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.704]  There's a lot of issues involved.
[00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:49.921]  And it's generated by fossil fuels in most cases.
[00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:57.547]  Yes, if you have an electric car and your own hydroelectric plant down the street, then that is a very clean way to do things.
[00:11:58.564 --> 00:12:11.128]  But in most cases, it's coming from coal or it's coming from natural gas, which has a carbon footprint in the aggregate because of power loss down power lines that is massive.
[00:12:11.128 --> 00:12:13.509]  In some cases, half the power gets lost.
[00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:15.790]  So we've got that report we're going to be getting to.
[00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.471]  I mean, I love how Al Gore owns more than 15 houses.
[00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:24.440]  One of them in California is 10,000 square foot.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.928]  He has one in Tennessee that was 14,000 square feet.
[00:12:27.928 --> 00:12:30.133]  We did a report about a few years ago.
[00:12:31.192 --> 00:12:41.737]  And he wants you to live in a 220 foot coffin apartment so they can charge you more property taxes and more fines and fees.
[00:12:41.737 --> 00:12:54.282]  The answer is you have less so the government and corporate class that controls it can get more with their titles of nobility, which are the UN diplomatic immunity, the corporate loopholes and the rest of it.
[00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:55.683]  That's the big issue here.
[00:12:56.363 --> 00:13:05.206]  Is that corporate leaders that are anti-free market are re-establishing feudalism and serfdom and they're exempt from it.
[00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:08.507]  That's the real discrimination.
[00:13:08.507 --> 00:13:09.387]  We can discuss that.
[00:13:09.387 --> 00:13:15.929]  We have a medical doctor and scientist who's advised the US government, the UN, you name it.
[00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:18.070]  In fact, she's a former Clinton administration official.
[00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:20.106]  It's coming on.
[00:13:20.106 --> 00:13:30.070]  She was in a CBS News report admitting, which is already in the major studies, but I want to get a doctor on to break it down for you, that yes, your cell phones are giving you cancer.
[00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:35.252]  She'll be joining us to discuss the fact that this is a very serious issue.
[00:13:35.252 --> 00:13:37.272]  Dr. Deborah Davis.
[00:13:37.272 --> 00:13:39.653]  So that's coming up.
[00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:46.115]  UK's Cameron shifts tack on constitutional shakeup to mollify Scots.
[00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:47.136]  That's Reuters.
[00:13:47.136 --> 00:13:48.036]  Then you read the article.
[00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:56.235]  Yeah, it says he's flipping and not doing what he said he would do on more powers for Scotland.
[00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:00.476]  They used to call that lying, now they call it changing tack.
[00:14:00.476 --> 00:14:12.160]  Be like if it was your wedding night and you just made vows the rest of your life to be with this man or this woman and she walks in or he walks in to the bridal suite
[00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:22.577]  And your new wife is in bed with the bellhop going at it.
[00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:26.939]  And you say, baby, baby, you just pledged to never cheat on me.
[00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:31.501]  And she looks at you and says, I changed tack.
[00:14:31.501 --> 00:14:35.143]  That'd be a good one.
[00:14:35.143 --> 00:14:39.905]  But we've now gotten to the point just to expect betrayal.
[00:14:39.905 --> 00:14:41.506]  Oh, we'll give you more autonomy.
[00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:42.046]  Stay in the UK.
[00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:48.153]  And then, oh, sorry, now we're not going to do that.
[00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:51.374]  Snipers!
[00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:53.575]  Guards and fences, not enough.
[00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:59.577]  Secret Service now is looking at checkpoints on the roads surrounding the White House.
[00:14:59.577 --> 00:15:02.018]  Well, they already kind of have that on the roads right around it.
[00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:10.553]  And boy, let me tell you, little kids hold up their camera, take a picture of the White House from the park across the street, Secret Service runs over and gets in their face.
[00:15:10.553 --> 00:15:19.239]  It's just Secret Service, uniformed Secret Service, is just running around everywhere, and none of it has to do with so-called security.
[00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:25.163]  It's all about just selling the idea that this country should accept being a bunch of third-world serfs.
[00:15:27.267 --> 00:15:37.733]  I was reading some COINTELPRO documents this weekend from congressional hearings back in the 70s about the FBI targeting political dissent in this country and trying to shut it down.
[00:15:37.733 --> 00:15:44.997]  And their mission was to even use violence to do it if need be, but obviously that was illegal.
[00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:50.961]  So to keep it secret, so that the illusion that we were a free country would not be shattered.
[00:15:53.097 --> 00:15:54.738]  Well, now government doesn't want to go with that.
[00:15:54.738 --> 00:16:02.020]  They want to say, no, you are slaves and you better step and fetch when we say.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.661]  Now, I see the phones have been loaded ringing.
[00:16:04.661 --> 00:16:05.862]  Let me give you the number.
[00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:08.883]  First time callers, any issue you want to raise.
[00:16:08.883 --> 00:16:10.424]  I love the wildcard angle of it.
[00:16:10.424 --> 00:16:10.644]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:10.644 --> 00:16:10.764]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:10.764 --> 00:16:11.964]  Here's an interesting story.
[00:16:22.304 --> 00:16:26.609]  Drone that can turn a doorknob!
[00:16:26.609 --> 00:16:32.515]  And we showed a drone in an article for InfoWars last week that DrugsReport.com picked up.
[00:16:32.515 --> 00:16:34.237]  This story is on drugs today from Time Magazine.
[00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:41.012]  Showing the drone that they're training indoors to be able to come and open your doorknob.
[00:16:41.012 --> 00:16:56.715]  The one we showed last week flies through your window or flies along looking through your windows and they have announced it's now fitted with face scanning technology to identify faces in crowds or inside your home.
[00:16:56.715 --> 00:17:01.316]  Can you imagine what the Nazis would have done with something like this?
[00:17:03.462 --> 00:17:10.307]  We could, as a culture, demand an architecture of technology that empowers humanity.
[00:17:10.307 --> 00:17:20.134]  But instead, we're letting the social engineers decide the architecture, and it is a decidedly anti-human perspective.
[00:17:20.134 --> 00:17:32.444]  Speaking of that, there is a video titled The Singularity, Alex Jones and Ray Kurzweil Battle, that we're also going to be playing here today.
[00:17:33.709 --> 00:17:37.993]  So, we're going to be having a little discussion about the singularity and more.
[00:17:37.993 --> 00:17:43.878]  But the toll-free number to join us... The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:17:43.878 --> 00:17:43.978]  800-259-9231.
[00:17:43.978 --> 00:17:46.200]  I spent a lot of the Sunday show yesterday
[00:17:59.175 --> 00:18:03.157]  Well, playing special reports, which I do sometimes anyways, because I like them.
[00:18:03.157 --> 00:18:04.218]  They're informative, I think.
[00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:07.159]  People seem to like it as well.
[00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:17.824]  But also because I did some screaming Saturday night, some yelling, an hour-long speech I gave to the Casey Research Group, a really high-powered group down in San Antonio.
[00:18:17.824 --> 00:18:24.168]  It was an international group, but it was at the Hyatt down in San Antonio.
[00:18:27.527 --> 00:18:44.017]  But what I really focused in on in the first half of the broadcast was Rand Paul's speech last Friday, where he openly said we've given 600 tons in the last year to ISIS and that it's meant to overthrow Assad.
[00:18:44.017 --> 00:18:52.162]  Well, Samantha Powers has now come out, that's our ambassador to the UN, and said exactly that.
[00:18:52.162 --> 00:18:52.883]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:18:54.321 --> 00:19:00.503]  Our national security imperative is to go after ISIL and to degrade and destroy it over time.
[00:19:00.503 --> 00:19:07.584]  And the moderate opposition now will have greater capabilities to do that thanks to an overwhelming bipartisan vote in Congress to support that.
[00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:09.805]  But is that what the Free Syrian Army wants to do?
[00:19:09.805 --> 00:19:15.987]  I thought the Free Syrian Army was trying to fight Assad, that they've been fighting side by side in some cases with ISIS.
[00:19:15.987 --> 00:19:17.667]  Do they know that's why we're training them?
[00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:19.446]  Uh, they do.
[00:19:19.446 --> 00:19:30.033]  Uh, but, but, may I add, the training, uh, also will service these troops in the same struggle that they've been in, uh, since the beginning of this conflict against the Assad regime.
[00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:37.157]  Let me, let me note, the Free Syrian Army and other, other moderate forces have been fighting ISIL, uh, since December.
[00:19:37.157 --> 00:19:39.839]  They have pushed ISIL out of, uh, strategic areas.
[00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:45.662]  The reason that they've lost, the moderate opposition have lost territory over time, is that they have been fighting over 90%.
[00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:49.778]  of the rebels are Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:49.778 --> 00:19:52.462]  They just call them ISIL, ISIS, to confuse you.
[00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:55.126]  And I know we've harped on this, but there you go.
[00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:59.473]  You got John McCain attacking Rand Paul for saying that, then the ambassador admits it.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.720]  The human body is extraordinary.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.921]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.

[00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:18.005]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:21:18.005 --> 00:21:20.527]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:22.152]  Alright, I'm going to get Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs in here for about 10 minutes at the start of the next hour because he just walked in with this NBC local news story that I haven't seen put out on a big national platform yet.
[00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:27.157]  Police search for missing Afghan soldiers on Cape Cod.
[00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:28.559]  You heard me right on the East Coast.
[00:24:29.966 --> 00:24:36.828]  Mass National Guard says the soldiers were last seen Saturday night, but there is no threat to the public.
[00:24:36.828 --> 00:24:52.391]  How many times have the military troops of Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, blown up bases, detonated car bombs and truck bombs, launched hand grenade attacks, or killed the highest ranking general ever killed in combat?
[00:24:52.391 --> 00:24:53.892]  General Green was a two-star general?
[00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:57.473]  Remember last month?
[00:24:57.473 --> 00:24:58.613]  A month and a half ago?
[00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:04.136]  Three Afghan National Army soldiers went missing.
[00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:10.658]  The soldiers had been at Joint Base Camp Cod since September 11th.
[00:25:10.658 --> 00:25:13.399]  Brought in on September 11th.
[00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:18.320]  There's been a lot of speculation, including they may be trying to defect.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.021]  Defect to who?
[00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:22.002]  I thought they already defected to the United States.
[00:25:22.002 --> 00:25:26.443]  No reason to think they have nefarious intent, said Colonel Timothy Alban.
[00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:35.644]  National Guard says there is no threat to the public at this time because the soldiers were vetted by a wide variety of agencies before they were brought into the United States.
[00:25:35.644 --> 00:25:43.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, they have senior members of the Afghan Army blowing people up.
[00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.051]  I mean, this is just more bull!
[00:25:45.051 --> 00:25:47.833]  More 2 plus 2 equals 5!
[00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:49.074]  I'm getting really upset!
[00:25:50.316 --> 00:26:03.128]  Because let me tell you something, when they go shoot up a shopping mall, or shoot up a church, or shoot up a school, they're going to blame gun owners and say, they were able to rob a house and get guns, or able to go to a gun shop and buy them, and that's why you need to turn your guns in.
[00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.769]  I mean, it's just a matter of time.
[00:26:04.769 --> 00:26:08.172]  And I'm not saying these guys are doing that.
[00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:12.836]  I'm saying it just shows how this country is wide open.
[00:26:12.836 --> 00:26:15.539]  I'm not saying these particular soldiers are going to do that.
[00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:16.720]  But I will say I don't trust them.
[00:26:18.888 --> 00:26:21.089]  And I will say our southern borders are wide open.
[00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:25.892]  And Joe brought me another article about a terror group connected to Al Qaeda that has U.S.
[00:26:25.892 --> 00:26:29.314]  passports on record.
[00:26:29.314 --> 00:26:46.325]  By the way, Joe did a report about two months ago dealing with video and photo no one had ever seen that he took while in Afghanistan where they found a safe house filled with thousands of munitions and hand grenades and weapons with New York phone books and people they were going to kill.
[00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:49.382]  And then folks go, oh, that was probably planted.
[00:26:49.382 --> 00:26:51.183]  There's no real Muslim extremist.
[00:26:51.183 --> 00:26:53.124]  Alex, you know, you've sold out.
[00:26:53.124 --> 00:26:58.987]  You used to say everything was an inside job and staged, and, you know, now you're saying that there's a real terror threat.
[00:26:58.987 --> 00:27:02.528]  No, you never listen to my show.
[00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:06.190]  Or you listen to mainstream media put on a one-dimensional view of what I said.
[00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.211]  There are radical Islamicists.
[00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:14.614]  They're being funded and protected by criminal elements in Western governments, evidenced by ISIS right now.
[00:27:16.272 --> 00:27:28.697]  And they are being allowed to destabilize the world and attack the West, so then the power structure has a way to bring military-industrial complex takeover, that Eisenhower warned us of, to the United States and the West.
[00:27:28.697 --> 00:27:31.158]  It's very elementary.
[00:27:31.158 --> 00:27:37.421]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:27:37.421 --> 00:27:40.402]  But there are real terror groups.
[00:27:41.601 --> 00:27:43.262]  Now, should we give our liberties up because of them?
[00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:44.262]  Absolutely not!
[00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:46.484]  Statistically, it's a very low danger.
[00:27:46.484 --> 00:27:52.247]  Plus, if you start giving liberty up, people will start staging it because they get to take over.
[00:27:52.247 --> 00:27:57.890]  You have to say, no, we're a free country, we're going to keep our Bill of Rights and Constitution, we're going to have an open and free society.
[00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:05.754]  We are not going to have checkpoints a mile around the White House, because next it will be a mile around D.C.
[00:28:05.754 --> 00:28:08.616]  This is the Romanian or Soviet or Nazi model
[00:28:09.946 --> 00:28:14.768]  That you only see when, like, a foreign army is approaching the Capitol.
[00:28:14.768 --> 00:28:17.309]  This is not Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.
[00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:20.751]  NSA spying, the news saying your kids belong to the government.
[00:28:20.751 --> 00:28:21.772]  It's pure tyranny.
[00:28:21.772 --> 00:28:22.952]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:27.414]  We're going to go to break and go to Kenneth, Dan, Renee, Jesse, Mike, and others.
[00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:30.476]  And as soon as you hear one person hang up, that's your chance to call them.
[00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:31.216]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:35.421]  Because I will take a lot of calls when we come back.
[00:28:35.421 --> 00:28:38.984]  But Joe Biggs will pop in for 10 minutes to give us his take on this.
[00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:43.008]  He came in here pretty upset by this, and I know why.
[00:28:43.008 --> 00:28:51.114]  Because they were constantly being attacked inside their bases.
[00:28:51.114 --> 00:28:55.258]  Constantly by the so-called Afghan Army.
[00:28:55.258 --> 00:28:56.759]  And people could say, well, we shouldn't be over there.
[00:28:57.873 --> 00:29:00.814]  Regardless, they shouldn't be over here either.
[00:29:00.814 --> 00:29:09.459]  And there are a lot of Wahhabist, Akhani Network, Al Qaeda types who are absolute sleeper cells.
[00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:16.902]  And you know full well the government could let them come in saying they're vetted and know they're planning an attack.
[00:29:16.902 --> 00:29:19.724]  I'm not saying these guys, I'm saying hypothetically.
[00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:26.227]  And then use that attack, again, to divert all attention away from the other Obama scandals and things that are happening.
[00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.131]  They knew with Major Hassan.
[00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:33.993]  For two years, the CIA was tracking his emails back to Al-Qaeda and the planned attack.
[00:29:33.993 --> 00:29:41.197]  They declared national security on those emails, but Congress, that was able to see it, admitted that the CIA knew.
[00:29:41.197 --> 00:29:45.139]  So, again, they just wind these guys up, and then they attack.
[00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:47.059]  The question is, why?
[00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:48.100]  It's not debatable.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.501]  They're winding them up.
[00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:50.881]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:51.822]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.822 --> 00:29:53.423]  Calls are straight ahead.
[00:29:53.423 --> 00:29:56.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.343 --> 00:30:02.864]  Open your eyes.
[00:30:02.864 --> 00:30:06.287]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[00:30:06.287 --> 00:30:12.771]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:21.117]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[00:30:21.117 --> 00:30:22.178]  Open your eyes.
[00:30:22.518 --> 00:30:37.475]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by Infowars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.
[00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:45.838]  Optimize the natural power of your eyes with the latest addition to the super high quality InfoWars Live formulations, Occupower.
[00:30:45.838 --> 00:30:51.359]  Go to InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com to order Occupower.
[00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:51.860]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.280]  Occupower.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.060]  Open your eyes.
[00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:10.593]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:31:10.593 --> 00:31:20.301]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:30.866]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[00:31:30.866 --> 00:31:35.549]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:37.770]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.533]  And there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:46.219]  Instead, Oxy Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[00:31:46.219 --> 00:31:51.564]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:31:51.564 --> 00:31:57.050]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy Powder.
[00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:57.511]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:07.155]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:32:07.155 --> 00:32:10.457]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:32:10.457 --> 00:32:12.239]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:18.583]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:24.488]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:32:24.628 --> 00:32:28.589]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:31.650]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:39.952]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:32:39.952 --> 00:32:42.033]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:32:42.033 --> 00:32:43.073]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:32:43.453 --> 00:32:52.396]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:32:52.396 --> 00:32:55.056]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:59.418]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:32:59.418 --> 00:33:06.700]  So we have Ian right there.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.140]  What's his name?
[00:33:25.321 --> 00:33:27.022]  There is a war.
[00:33:27.022 --> 00:33:28.904]  It's happening now.
[00:33:28.904 --> 00:33:31.286]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:33:31.286 --> 00:33:33.848]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:33:33.848 --> 00:33:35.769]  We are the resistance.
[00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:37.431]  We are the Infowar.
[00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:44.647]  And this is Monday, the 22nd day of September 2014.
[00:33:44.647 --> 00:33:46.868]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.868 --> 00:33:50.250]  Okay, I'm going to your phone calls now, right through the full three hours.
[00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.991]  We have one guest on for 30 minutes, another guest for 10 minutes.
[00:33:52.991 --> 00:33:55.873]  But other than that, it'll be phone calls and news.
[00:33:55.873 --> 00:34:00.595]  Coming up, food shortages on Sierra Leone's final day of Ebola lockdown.
[00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:05.858]  Handouts of rice were distributed only to some families in order to stay in their homes.
[00:34:06.638 --> 00:34:10.100]  World Bank says Ebola spread may have catastrophic costs.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.901]  I think it already has.
[00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:20.767]  Also, Saul Alinsky letters have been released between Hillary Clinton and Saul Alinsky.
[00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:24.709]  Look at that creepy control freak if you're watching us on TV.
[00:34:24.709 --> 00:34:26.370]  Hillary Clinton when she was young.
[00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:32.694]  They had her in Life Magazine when she was a college student telling us then how she would be our superstar boss.
[00:34:33.857 --> 00:34:54.508]  And of course, new documents have been leaked showing the big telecom companies with the big video game makers literally being run by top anti-male feminists to put all their anti-family, anti-male messages out there as women prepare to literally wed the state.
[00:34:54.508 --> 00:34:56.509]  All run by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:34:58.103 --> 00:35:04.809]  Gloria Steinem in the 80s wrote a book and admitted that she was given the money to start that whole organization, Miss Magazine.
[00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:08.291]  It has nothing to do with empowering women.
[00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:13.856]  It's about absolutely breaking up any type of community and it's truly sickening.
[00:35:13.856 --> 00:35:15.057]  We told you this was coming.
[00:35:15.057 --> 00:35:24.385]  USA Today reports tax refunds will be cut for American Affordable Care Act recipients or Obamacare.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.584]  So, we told you that it had all sorts of little red tape in there like that, so there you go.
[00:35:31.584 --> 00:35:34.005]  Like death panels.
[00:35:34.005 --> 00:35:37.067]  The Affordable Care Act.
[00:35:37.067 --> 00:35:40.710]  What a deal.
[00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.172]  But first, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:35:43.172 --> 00:35:45.773]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[00:35:45.773 --> 00:35:47.395]  Kenneth, thanks for calling today.
[00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:47.715]  Welcome.
[00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:54.207]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute about the climate change protesters.
[00:35:54.207 --> 00:36:04.570]  You know, this is kind of amazing to me that they'll get up there with the signs and they'll talk about CO, carbon emissions and all this, but nobody wants to talk about geoengineering.
[00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.451]  Nobody wants to talk about the chemicals that are being sprayed in the air.
[00:36:08.175 --> 00:36:10.937]  And like, I'll give you an example like C-SPAN.
[00:36:10.937 --> 00:36:14.260]  They'll get up there and talk about it like they do today and nobody mentions it.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.241]  It's just like, let's just keep quiet about that.
[00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:18.002]  Let's don't say anything about that.
[00:36:18.002 --> 00:36:23.306]  We'll talk about everything else but when somebody gets on the phone and tries to say something about it, they cut them off.
[00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:26.789]  That's just amazing to me and I just wanted to get your take on that.
[00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:33.334]  They have to keep up appearances on C-SPAN and all the time I've sent YouTube clips
[00:36:34.346 --> 00:36:47.057]  That listeners have compiled, where an entire hour of phone calls will be dominated by plugs for InfoWars.com, plugs for our documentaries, people talking about the New World Order.
[00:36:47.057 --> 00:36:53.022]  They'll have a Council on Foreign Relations, their Trilateral Commission member on, and they will literally get besieged.
[00:36:54.741 --> 00:37:02.707]  By informed listeners that will start quoting the different treasonous statements back at them until they panic and shut it down.
[00:37:02.707 --> 00:37:05.589]  Because they can't stand being challenged.
[00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:17.698]  The fake environmental movement is about global zoning, population control, selective enforcement of regulations to allow only certain insider groups to operate and flourish, or feudalism.
[00:37:19.298 --> 00:37:26.449]  And exactly, they want to tax carbon dioxide as part of the life cycle, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sunshine, and water.
[00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:27.871]  Gotta have those things.
[00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:33.399]  If they can tax one of those, we know sunshine's good, we know water's good, we know oxygen's good.
[00:37:34.699 --> 00:37:45.822]  So they target carbon dioxide while they ignore all the GMO, the cross-species engineering, the geoengineering of the climate, all the things that are admitted to be going on.
[00:37:45.822 --> 00:37:47.222]  Oh, forget that!
[00:37:47.222 --> 00:37:55.284]  You are just someone that wants to kill the Earth because you won't turn control over to the UN and these select corporations.
[00:37:55.284 --> 00:37:57.185]  That's a great point and I appreciate your call.
[00:37:57.185 --> 00:38:01.066]  In fact, since he mentioned it, let's go ahead and go to a clip.
[00:38:01.066 --> 00:38:02.646]  Climate change skeptics
[00:38:04.488 --> 00:38:08.230]  Call out marchers' hypocrisies.
[00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:18.657]  And all they did was send out onto the streets PJTV to go bring up some simple questions.
[00:38:18.657 --> 00:38:20.378]  Look at how you came here on buses.
[00:38:20.378 --> 00:38:22.439]  Look at how you got garbage everywhere.
[00:38:22.439 --> 00:38:24.240]  Look how much you're consuming.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.583]  Look at how your cell phone is getting its power from coal.
[00:38:28.583 --> 00:38:33.766]  And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who we've interviewed before, by the way, literally blew up.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.741]  And just got flustered.
[00:38:36.741 --> 00:38:43.746]  It's like when I had Rothschild on, one of the main Rothschild heirs who pushes all this stuff and puts out books where polar bears can't swim for kids.
[00:38:43.746 --> 00:38:47.328]  We famously had him on promoting his book.
[00:38:47.328 --> 00:38:51.631]  And when I said, well, why are the ice caps on Mars?
[00:38:51.631 --> 00:38:52.972]  Because that was eight years ago.
[00:38:52.972 --> 00:38:56.214]  And so it was still some solar system warming.
[00:38:56.214 --> 00:38:59.175]  I said, why is its ice caps getting smaller?
[00:38:59.175 --> 00:38:59.796]  Not just ours.
[00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:03.691]  Of course, it stopped right around that time, and now they've been growing.
[00:39:03.691 --> 00:39:07.755]  And he said, well, that's because Mars is closer to the Sun than the Earth, dummy.
[00:39:07.755 --> 00:39:17.703]  And I said, no, it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, the third rock, and then Mars, and then out to the gas giants.
[00:39:17.703 --> 00:39:19.944]  And he just said, no, it's not, and laughed at me.
[00:39:19.944 --> 00:39:23.827]  Now, obviously, he knew Mars was further out.
[00:39:23.827 --> 00:39:27.851]  But it's a religion of disdain for the public's ignorance.
[00:39:28.729 --> 00:39:38.933]  And training you to just throw it in your face that we're gonna fund ISIS to fight ISIS and then change the name to ISIL to confuse people.
[00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:39.793]  So that's a great point.
[00:39:39.793 --> 00:39:42.894]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of this video.
[00:39:42.894 --> 00:39:43.434]  Here it is.
[00:39:43.434 --> 00:39:45.115]  Do you have an iPhone or an Android?
[00:39:46.704 --> 00:39:47.704]  I have a cell phone.
[00:39:47.704 --> 00:39:48.164]  You do?
[00:39:48.164 --> 00:39:53.766]  Are you concerned about the damage that the cell phone and electricity generation causes to the environment?
[00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:55.206]  Are you joking about this?
[00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:58.827]  No, I want to know if you're willing to give up your iPhone.
[00:39:58.827 --> 00:39:59.788]  No, I'm not.
[00:39:59.788 --> 00:40:00.368]  Why not?
[00:40:00.368 --> 00:40:01.688]  Doesn't it start with people like you?
[00:40:01.688 --> 00:40:03.269]  No, no, no.
[00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:12.951]  It starts by changing the laws to rationalize the marketplace so that we reward the most efficient forms of energy use.
[00:40:12.951 --> 00:40:13.812]  And we punish the bad ones.
[00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:15.192]  But shouldn't you lead by example?
[00:40:15.772 --> 00:40:16.933]  No, no.
[00:40:16.933 --> 00:40:18.053]  I do lead by example.
[00:40:18.053 --> 00:40:20.254]  So are you going to give up your cell phone?
[00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:21.295]  No, I'm not going to give up my cell phone.
[00:40:21.295 --> 00:40:22.495]  Are you going to give up your car?
[00:40:22.495 --> 00:40:24.076]  Are you going to give up yours?
[00:40:24.076 --> 00:40:27.238]  I'm not the one who's here talking about the environment.
[00:40:27.238 --> 00:40:29.599]  You're here trying to change the environment, trying to change the law.
[00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:33.581]  So I'm asking if you're going to lead by example.
[00:40:33.581 --> 00:40:36.642]  No, I'm not going to stop using a cell phone.
[00:40:36.642 --> 00:40:38.183]  I'm not going to stop using it.
[00:40:38.183 --> 00:40:38.984]  I don't believe
[00:40:40.284 --> 00:41:06.816]  We have to reduce the our quality of life in order to have a in order to have a rational free market in order to in order to stop the use of carbon in order to divorce ourselves from That's good a fuel that is just it gets even better the videos up on info wars calm right now And I want to commend PJ TV it's it's better than their old days where they would have people stand behind me yelling kill Michelle Malkin and
[00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:11.515]  And then blame me for it when it was on video that I didn't say it.
[00:41:11.515 --> 00:41:12.095]  Whatever.
[00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:14.417]  Hey, they want to keep our power plants on?
[00:41:14.417 --> 00:41:14.837]  I like them.
[00:41:14.837 --> 00:41:15.397]  Good job.
[00:41:15.397 --> 00:41:19.640]  They do a lot of really, really great work over there.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:25.825]  Now continuing, and then I'm gonna go back to your calls on this issue.
[00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:27.806]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:41:27.806 --> 00:41:30.528]  has exposed that vaccines are clearly linked to autism.
[00:41:30.528 --> 00:41:31.829]  I appreciate him for that.
[00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:36.853]  He has spoken out that we should investigate cell phone radiation and brain tumors that killed his uncle.
[00:41:39.258 --> 00:41:43.642]  I think he's actually a guy that means well.
[00:41:43.642 --> 00:41:45.763]  Because I've talked to him on air and off air.
[00:41:45.763 --> 00:41:49.186]  And I know folks that are friends with him.
[00:41:49.186 --> 00:41:51.768]  So I don't want to just demonize every liberal out there.
[00:41:51.768 --> 00:41:53.650]  He is a useful idiot.
[00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.112]  And I've been an idiot before as well.
[00:41:56.112 --> 00:41:56.932]  All of us are learning.
[00:41:56.932 --> 00:41:57.613]  It's a process.
[00:41:57.613 --> 00:41:59.134]  But I mean, he is a useful idiot.
[00:41:59.134 --> 00:42:02.477]  That's what Lenin called well-meaning people that went along with the communists.
[00:42:07.512 --> 00:42:13.913]  And the media demonized him for coming out and speaking out and saying we should investigate vaccines when it's overwhelming.
[00:42:13.913 --> 00:42:23.715]  By the end of the week, last week, I said there were three mainstream news articles worldwide, or three different big events, hundreds of articles worldwide.
[00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:26.075]  There was a fourth by Sunday.
[00:42:26.075 --> 00:42:27.175]  I didn't get to.
[00:42:27.175 --> 00:42:31.656]  In a seven-day period, four scandals on three continents.
[00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:34.997]  No, four continents.
[00:42:34.997 --> 00:42:36.037]  There's the other four scandals.
[00:42:37.472 --> 00:42:41.416]  With vaccines killing large numbers of children that took them.
[00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:44.299]  HPV, polio shots, you name it.
[00:42:44.299 --> 00:42:54.169]  Killing people in Latin America, in South America, in Central Asia, in the Middle East, in Africa.
[00:42:57.984 --> 00:43:00.485]  Simply mind-blowing.
[00:43:00.485 --> 00:43:03.726]  So I don't want to just sit here and attack people like Kennedy.
[00:43:03.726 --> 00:43:05.787]  He really thinks you should turn your guns in.
[00:43:05.787 --> 00:43:10.128]  He really thinks carbon's gonna kill us all.
[00:43:10.128 --> 00:43:13.049]  And at least he's against a bunch of GMO stuff that's out of control.
[00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:14.210]  So many scientists come to me
[00:43:15.632 --> 00:43:21.934]  I ran to one of them at the Casey Research event, who was a biologist, and he said, Alex, why are you against GMO?
[00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:25.574]  And I said, well, they're putting Trojan horse stuff into it, and they're not testing it right.
[00:43:25.574 --> 00:43:29.255]  I've read the studies by the companies that put it out themselves.
[00:43:29.255 --> 00:43:39.398]  It's really dangerous to mix plant and animals together, and it's really dangerous to be, I mean, are you denying that, take the case of BT corn?
[00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:47.738]  Within three generations of feeding it to rodents, they're almost completely sterile, and it goes for the same for almost all of them.
[00:43:47.738 --> 00:43:51.861]  I mean, this is real what we're talking about here.
[00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:54.082]  This is real.
[00:43:54.082 --> 00:44:02.366]  And so I don't just take issues because they're liberal or conservative, and then I decide something has validity to it because it fits into my worldview.
[00:44:02.366 --> 00:44:03.727]  I really try to find out what's going on.
[00:44:03.727 --> 00:44:07.208]  All right, I said I take a lot of calls, and I've taken one call.
[00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:08.789]  Let's go to Dan in Louisiana.
[00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:09.750]  Dan, thanks for calling.
[00:44:10.802 --> 00:44:12.563]  Hi Alex, Colin from FEMA Region 6.
[00:44:12.563 --> 00:44:15.164]  Good to have you on.
[00:44:15.164 --> 00:44:15.704]  Thank you.
[00:44:15.704 --> 00:44:19.765]  I'd just like to say that I have taken part in the import war.
[00:44:19.765 --> 00:44:23.447]  I was working, I do work in oil refineries down here in Louisiana.
[00:44:23.447 --> 00:44:24.307]  I do inspection.
[00:44:24.307 --> 00:44:30.629]  I was working with a gentleman, I'd rather not say his name on the air, I don't know if he wants me to announce who he is, but whatever.
[00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:38.412]  He had the first and probably the only Ron Paul town hall in Ocean Springs, Mississippi when Ron Paul was running for president.
[00:44:39.136 --> 00:44:48.422]  Oh, he's a big-time conservative, big-time libertarian, and he and I were having, you know, a lot of discussions about how to pass on the information of the InfoWars.
[00:44:48.422 --> 00:44:49.543]  So he gave me a good idea.
[00:44:49.543 --> 00:44:51.724]  He said, man, why don't you go get a business card?
[00:44:51.724 --> 00:44:52.465]  Because instead of
[00:44:53.217 --> 00:45:00.184]  Telling somebody about the Constitutional Free Zone, or telling them our Bill of Rights are under attack, or there's no more passe comitatus.
[00:45:00.184 --> 00:45:07.991]  You know, why don't you just get a card made, hand them something that they can put in their purse, pocket, or wallet, and maybe when you're not around, they may refer back to it.
[00:45:07.991 --> 00:45:08.912]  So I did just that.
[00:45:08.912 --> 00:45:11.774]  I've been passing them out, and if it's okay, can I read my card over you?
[00:45:11.774 --> 00:45:13.216]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:45:13.216 --> 00:45:17.880]  Okay, it starts out, free Americans for America, and big thick black letters at the top of it.
[00:45:18.456 --> 00:45:22.700]  And then underneath that, I continued on with help preserve our Republic.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.801]  Are you aware of these four things?
[00:45:24.801 --> 00:45:25.022]  1.
[00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:29.325]  Constitutional free zone 100 miles inland of America's coastlines.
[00:45:29.325 --> 00:45:29.765]  2.
[00:45:29.765 --> 00:45:32.888]  Our Constitution and Bill of Rights are under attack.
[00:45:32.888 --> 00:45:33.188]  3.
[00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:35.070]  The end of passe comitatus in America.
[00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:35.851]  4.
[00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:39.614]  Our government has been putting fluoride in our water supply for years.
[00:45:39.614 --> 00:45:43.157]  To become more informed of these issues, you can type items 1 through 4
[00:45:47.122 --> 00:45:51.986]  That's beautiful, brother.
[00:45:51.986 --> 00:45:54.108]  Thank you so much and God bless you.
[00:45:54.108 --> 00:45:57.311]  That's how we're going to reach more people.
[00:45:57.311 --> 00:46:01.414]  I'll just tell you, the power structure is hopping mad at us right now.
[00:46:01.414 --> 00:46:11.083]  They're attacking us from every angle because our talking points that we put out, which are based in real research and reality, are getting picked up by Congress and by the media.
[00:46:12.418 --> 00:46:18.662]  And that's the real power of this operation, is not even our audience of 20 million people and growing.
[00:46:18.662 --> 00:46:20.783]  That's conservative.
[00:46:20.783 --> 00:46:22.324]  But a base audience of 20 million.
[00:46:22.324 --> 00:46:27.187]  We're reaching hundreds of millions every year, one way or another, through different venues.
[00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:33.010]  And it's getting people to start thinking from an outside perspective of getting outside the box.
[00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:36.452]  And it's really making the establishment get upset.
[00:46:36.452 --> 00:46:38.794]  So please don't take InfoWars.com for granted.
[00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:41.476]  Thank you for putting up with me at the same time.
[00:46:41.476 --> 00:46:43.877]  It is a very hard task we've got here.
[00:46:43.877 --> 00:46:45.657]  But it's also an invigorating task.
[00:46:45.657 --> 00:46:47.398]  It's historical what's happening.
[00:46:47.398 --> 00:46:53.861]  And we really have a chance to make the world a better place.
[00:46:53.861 --> 00:46:55.641]  But regardless, I know this.
[00:46:55.641 --> 00:46:57.202]  Tyrants are taking over.
[00:46:57.202 --> 00:47:01.644]  If we don't at least slow them down, we're not going to have any freedom or any prosperity.
[00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:02.524]  It's getting serious.
[00:47:03.885 --> 00:47:05.906]  I want to go to Emma in Oregon.
[00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:10.068]  Emma in Oregon is listening on 880 AM KCMX.
[00:47:10.068 --> 00:47:11.769]  Go ahead, Emma, you're on the air.
[00:47:11.769 --> 00:47:13.430]  Thanks for calling.
[00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.611]  Oh, thank you.
[00:47:15.611 --> 00:47:28.358]  I just wanted to... I was having a conversation with my nephew, who just got back from the Navy the other day for a visit, and he was telling me about all the vaccinations that they were giving him, and we just got into a conversation about that.
[00:47:29.335 --> 00:47:32.958]  And I was like looking at it because he was just like defending them so much.
[00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:46.868]  And, um, I have two little kids and I choose like not to vaccinate them because, well, I was reading about it and this doctor was saying online, it was a really interesting, um, article.
[00:47:46.868 --> 00:47:56.294]  And he was saying that, you know, well, obviously the vaccinations, um, they make your body create antibodies to protect against the disease eventually.
[00:47:56.294 --> 00:47:56.334]  So.
[00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:01.087]  But the human body can't even do that until six months old.
[00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:04.278]  And they try and vaccinate your kid before they even leave the hospital for, um...
[00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:07.817]  Hepatitis B before you even leave the hospital.
[00:48:07.817 --> 00:48:08.998]  Well, let's expand on that.
[00:48:08.998 --> 00:48:18.846]  If your baby's not having sex or using intravenous drugs with HIV positive people and doesn't have an immune system to begin with, why would you give them a hepatitis shot?
[00:48:18.846 --> 00:48:21.608]  It's one of the most vicious, toxic shots out there.
[00:48:21.608 --> 00:48:23.390]  It has some of the worst side effects.
[00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:30.716]  They want to set the precedent early to put hundreds of different vaccines in your child by the time they're 10 years old, more than 40 by the time they're 2.
[00:48:32.498 --> 00:48:38.549]  And most of the vaccines don't even approximate what the real pathogen is.
[00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:42.636]  They always act like we're debating that you can get learned immunity.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:51.544]  Artificial immunity from a vaccine by introducing a small amount of attenuated virus or whatever the pathogen is.
[00:48:51.544 --> 00:48:54.266]  No, we know vaccines work.
[00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:58.549]  We know vaccine science is 500 years old with smallpox.
[00:48:58.549 --> 00:49:04.172]  They would take a needle or a stick and pop some of the pus of it from somebody that had it.
[00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:09.275]  And then when you were well, instead of already being run down when you got it, you had a better chance of beating it.
[00:49:09.855 --> 00:49:10.315]  Okay?
[00:49:10.315 --> 00:49:11.616]  But still, it would kill you sometimes.
[00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:12.917]  It's very dangerous.
[00:49:12.917 --> 00:49:15.478]  So all we're saying is there's major side effects.
[00:49:15.478 --> 00:49:28.524]  Now, that's if you have a government trying to be good and trying to have liability so that there is some culpability there so that people can get in trouble.
[00:49:28.524 --> 00:49:30.165]  Instead, it's all secret.
[00:49:30.165 --> 00:49:35.347]  They have a big tribunal with $5 billion cash, taxpayer money, to secretly pay people off.
[00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:37.608]  They got to sign forms, never speak about it.
[00:49:37.608 --> 00:49:38.669]  They'll lie to you and say,
[00:49:39.824 --> 00:49:42.046]  There's no side effects of the vaccine.
[00:49:42.046 --> 00:49:45.168]  When you read the insert, it'll tell you it can kill you.
[00:49:45.168 --> 00:49:47.109]  I don't care what vaccine it is, read it.
[00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:56.195]  One of the side effects is death, Gardasil, death, MMR, death, Guillain-Barre, epilepsy, narcolepsy.
[00:49:56.195 --> 00:50:07.263]  And there were four events last week in Colombia and Syria and Pakistan and Africa.
[00:50:09.056 --> 00:50:09.976]  In the continent of Africa.
[00:50:09.976 --> 00:50:12.637]  I forget which country it was.
[00:50:12.637 --> 00:50:13.817]  The point is, you can look it up.
[00:50:13.817 --> 00:50:18.319]  Where kids are getting sterilized or paralyzed or dying right after they take shots.
[00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:23.660]  So, they just sit here thinking we're ignorant and go, nothing's happening, nothing's wrong.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.700]  Why don't you want a shot?
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.481]  Why are you against science?
[00:50:26.481 --> 00:50:30.482]  What, do you want to go live with Fred Flintstone and Barney?
[00:50:30.482 --> 00:50:34.543]  Ma'am, anything else specifically they were saying to you or any other questions or comments?
[00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:42.400]  Yeah, the sheet, fact sheet they give you on the... It's hard for me to even take my kids to the doctor anymore.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.121]  Hold on, I'm going to come back to you.
[00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:51.026]  See, they don't... People ask for the paperwork now, they give you a fact sheet.
[00:50:51.026 --> 00:50:53.067]  A fact sheet that the company tells them to give you.
[00:50:53.067 --> 00:50:55.169]  You don't want the fact sheet.
[00:50:55.169 --> 00:50:57.451]  You want the drug insert that comes in the box.
[00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.994]  It's got the molecule and the breakdown on it.
[00:51:00.994 --> 00:51:04.078]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:51:04.078 --> 00:51:05.860]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.324]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:51:08.324 --> 00:51:09.926]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:51:09.926 --> 00:51:10.667]  If passed, H.R.
[00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:11.989]  5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[00:51:14.272 --> 00:51:16.455]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[00:51:16.455 --> 00:51:19.559]  We offer the most affordable level 3 body armor on the market.

[00:51:30.439 --> 00:51:31.560]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.042]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:51:36.042 --> 00:51:41.765]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:45.347]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:52:02.657 --> 00:52:07.781]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:15.906]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:15.906 --> 00:52:20.429]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:24.232]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:24.392 --> 00:52:30.336]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:30.336 --> 00:52:33.518]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:33.518 --> 00:52:38.882]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:53:02.581 --> 00:53:04.222]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:53:04.222 --> 00:53:07.043]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:53:07.043 --> 00:53:09.344]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[00:54:19.139 --> 00:54:21.900]  This atomic age of Renegades!
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:26.562]  Alright, we're gonna continue with your phone calls right into the next hour.
[00:54:28.846 --> 00:54:37.608]  Jesse, Mike, Vinay, Eric, and others going back to Emma in Oregon, 880 AM, KCMX.
[00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:56.192]  There is nothing more frustrating than being on air 20 years, having three children, going through schools wanting you to go get vaccines, even private ones, and not even knowing that there are waivers when upwards of 20% of the country is getting the waivers.
[00:54:57.475 --> 00:55:04.383]  And it's not a waiver to a law, it's just a policy they want you to get the waiver.
[00:55:04.383 --> 00:55:08.668]  But the schools will lie to you and tell you that there's not a waiver.
[00:55:08.668 --> 00:55:14.034]  My children are in a private school right now where they're informed and are patriots and know what's going on.
[00:55:15.327 --> 00:55:18.409]  But most of these vaccines on record don't protect you.
[00:55:18.409 --> 00:55:20.070]  They have serious side effects.
[00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.912]  And then they're adding a lot of Trojan horse type things to them.
[00:55:23.912 --> 00:55:34.117]  This is a government in the system, continuing secret lethal experiments on white people, black people, Hispanics, you name it, veterans, troops.
[00:55:34.117 --> 00:55:36.779]  Why would you trust anything they do?
[00:55:36.779 --> 00:55:39.861]  Why would you buy into any of it?
[00:55:39.861 --> 00:55:42.022]  And then I get so upset because I see the pattern of fraud.
[00:55:46.411 --> 00:56:04.510]  This pattern of criminal conspiracy where they just tell the workers at the different drug stores and places, but also the shot clinics and the rest of it, just say safe and effective and give them a fact sheet saying there's no side effects or that your arm might be sore.
[00:56:05.379 --> 00:56:09.984]  And so you go up to Walgreens and you say, we've done this on video, the nightly news.
[00:56:09.984 --> 00:56:12.406]  Yes, we'd like to know about the side effects.
[00:56:12.406 --> 00:56:13.967]  Okay, here's a fact sheet.
[00:56:13.967 --> 00:56:18.832]  We go, no, we want the insert that came in the little box with the ampule.
[00:56:18.832 --> 00:56:22.596]  Oh, you want that here.
[00:56:22.596 --> 00:56:24.197]  And then you read that.
[00:56:24.197 --> 00:56:26.640]  Oh, this can paralyze or kill me.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.901]  Wow.
[00:56:27.901 --> 00:56:29.302]  I thought it was safe and effective.
[00:56:31.018 --> 00:56:33.779]  You mean the shingles shot can give me the shingles?
[00:56:33.779 --> 00:56:36.479]  You mean the tetanus shot can give me tetanus?
[00:56:36.479 --> 00:56:38.800]  You mean hepatitis?
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.241]  Shots can kill me?
[00:56:42.241 --> 00:56:49.762]  And so you've got a mom out there trying to get informed about it, and you mention the quote fact sheet they give you.
[00:56:49.762 --> 00:56:51.743]  Go ahead and finish up, Emma.
[00:56:52.972 --> 00:57:05.259]  Well, it's just that, you know, it tells you how many people in, like, the, like, how many people get, like, these horrible, like, autism or permanent side effects from it.
[00:57:05.259 --> 00:57:06.439]  And it's just, it's really scary.
[00:57:06.439 --> 00:57:12.422]  But also, the other thing is, the reason I do not trust my doctor or my kid's dentist is, like, they force the fluoride on you.
[00:57:12.422 --> 00:57:17.045]  The, um, the oral fluoride that they want you to give your kid, the drops.
[00:57:17.714 --> 00:57:20.635]  And every single time I go to the doctor, are you giving your kid fluoride?
[00:57:20.635 --> 00:57:21.656]  They force it on you.
[00:57:21.656 --> 00:57:27.298]  They write, they send in a prescription to the pharmacy every single time for me.
[00:57:27.298 --> 00:57:29.519]  I never go pick it up, but it's just, it's scary.
[00:57:29.519 --> 00:57:30.039]  Like what?
[00:57:30.039 --> 00:57:31.720]  They know that's not good for your kid.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.181]  Why are they giving it to a little baby?
[00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:36.382]  You talking about fluoride tablets?
[00:57:36.382 --> 00:57:37.583]  The drops.
[00:57:37.583 --> 00:57:38.283]  I don't know, I never got...
[00:57:38.749 --> 00:57:42.370]  Well listen, school districts all over the country are stopping that.
[00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:51.314]  I remember being a kid in first and second grade and they would have us take the fluoride pills and I would get deathly ill and just lay on the ground.
[00:57:51.314 --> 00:58:03.359]  And I would basically crawl out of the building with half the other kids to meet our parents outside when I went to Margaret Sanger Kindergarten in Dallas.
[00:58:03.359 --> 00:58:08.401]  I remember a few times a year when the red pills would come with the free toothbrush
[00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:15.202]  With a little animal or something on the handle that I learned to dread it by the first grade.
[00:58:15.202 --> 00:58:17.964]  I wasn't a rocket scientist, I just knew these red pills bring pain.
[00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:21.060]  And now they admit it causes dental fluorosis.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.781]  It does nothing to protect your teeth.
[00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:23.962]  Total fraud.
[00:58:23.962 --> 00:58:25.142]  Social engineering.
[00:58:25.142 --> 00:58:29.445]  Just like the White House Science Czar said in Ecoscience, they would add things to the water to brain damage us.
[00:58:29.445 --> 00:58:31.105]  And they've done a great job.
[00:58:31.105 --> 00:58:36.048]  So don't go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a ProPure G2 filter and cut the fluoride out.
[00:58:36.048 --> 00:58:37.129]  Drink extra.
[00:58:37.129 --> 00:58:39.310]  David Rockefeller is counting on it.
[00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.371]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:44.793]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.793 --> 00:58:45.913]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.737 --> 00:58:54.861]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[00:58:54.861 --> 00:58:59.405]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:58:59.405 --> 00:59:05.931]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:59:05.931 --> 00:59:09.935]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:59:09.935 --> 00:59:11.596]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:11.596 --> 00:59:15.560]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:24.405]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:59:24.405 --> 00:59:32.510]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.172]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:41.976]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at

[00:59:46.359 --> 00:59:55.984]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.984 --> 00:59:58.766]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.772 --> 01:00:11.616]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.616 --> 01:00:13.197]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.197 --> 01:00:14.738]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.738 --> 01:00:18.942]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.942 --> 01:00:23.025]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.988 --> 01:00:31.770]  We got callers that want to talk about ISIS.
[01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.771]  Callers that want to talk about international courts, missing children.
[01:00:34.771 --> 01:00:39.434]  Callers that want to talk about being kicked out of school for wearing a pro-gun shirt.
[01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:43.356]  Callers that want to talk about peaceful protest in a Prison Planet article, and more.
[01:00:43.356 --> 01:00:46.497]  We're going to get to all of you.
[01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:52.040]  Coming up, we get a quick 10-minute update from Joe Biggs about an NBC article.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.141]  It's also on CBS Now.
[01:00:53.141 --> 01:00:56.123]  It just broke minutes ago, nationally.
[01:00:57.213 --> 01:01:01.314]  Police search for missing Afghan soldiers on Cape Cod.
[01:01:01.314 --> 01:01:06.695]  Does anybody remember how many times they've car-bombed or truck-bombed or shot people up?
[01:01:06.695 --> 01:01:13.316]  Just last month they killed the highest-ranking general, Major General Harold G. Green.
[01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:16.356]  Was killed August 5th, so a month and a half ago, roughly?
[01:01:16.356 --> 01:01:20.737]  About a month and a half ago, exactly.
[01:01:20.737 --> 01:01:23.258]  So this is pretty serious information.
[01:01:23.258 --> 01:01:24.798]  I'm not saying these guys are going to do that.
[01:01:24.798 --> 01:01:25.618]  It just shows how
[01:01:29.073 --> 01:01:34.195]  Precarious the security is inside this nation.
[01:01:34.195 --> 01:01:37.336]  Working with the Afghans.
[01:01:37.336 --> 01:01:40.137]  Getting in their business and then bringing them over here.
[01:01:40.137 --> 01:01:44.659]  Jesse in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.780]  Thanks for letting me on Alex, how are you?
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.261]  I'm good brother, what did you call in about?
[01:01:49.261 --> 01:01:57.224]  Well I wanted to call in about ISIS, but like you just brought up with the Afghan soldiers missing here in America.
[01:01:57.224 --> 01:01:58.224]  I mean, didn't
[01:01:58.914 --> 01:02:03.860]  Just a couple weeks ago, the government admit to training ISIS in Jordan.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:09.366]  And they said that all of those rebels were vetted and that they, you know, were just moderate.
[01:02:09.366 --> 01:02:14.411]  They were not trying to, you know, use our skills and our weapons to fight against us.
[01:02:14.411 --> 01:02:17.795]  And now look... That's exactly what I went into the writers and I just said an hour ago.
[01:02:17.795 --> 01:02:19.997]  So we need a report on this saying, hey,
[01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:22.641]  Afghan soldiers still missing.
[01:02:22.641 --> 01:02:23.723]  It's been like a week actually.
[01:02:23.723 --> 01:02:25.866]  They're just now reporting on it saying this weekend.
[01:02:25.866 --> 01:02:29.812]  No, it's the weekend before from what we can gather in these articles and...
[01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:32.657]  They were all vetted in Afghanistan.
[01:02:32.657 --> 01:02:35.338]  They were all vetted the rebels in Syria and Jordan.
[01:02:35.338 --> 01:02:39.480]  They were all vetted the guy that killed General Green.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:45.763]  So I don't want to hear that the Afghan military is vetted when they are one of the number one causes of U.S.
[01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.164]  soldiers losing their lives.
[01:02:47.164 --> 01:02:51.646]  Regardless of what you think about the war, I don't think we should be over there from the time it started.
[01:02:52.406 --> 01:03:02.496]  But I know this, they better not bring them here, and then when they do something, God forbid, not this group, but others, potentially, then who loses their freedoms, Jesse?
[01:03:02.496 --> 01:03:03.618]  Well, we do.
[01:03:03.618 --> 01:03:06.520]  And that is BS to, I mean, all the way.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:12.787]  There's no reason for us to lose our freedoms because people somewhere across the entire world away from us.
[01:03:13.559 --> 01:03:19.721]  Are trying to, you know, uh, kill Christians and, and create jihad on their own people.
[01:03:19.721 --> 01:03:23.362]  It has nothing to do with our freedoms, personally.
[01:03:23.362 --> 01:03:35.407]  And for the government to say, no, now we have to stick our fingers up, uh, up here or whatever at the, at the airport, or, you know, we get to have checkpoints every 30 miles and make sure you're not drinking and driving.
[01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:36.387]  Take away your freedoms.
[01:03:37.699 --> 01:03:41.260]  It's total bull, and it's a lie.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.461]  It's all a lie.
[01:03:42.461 --> 01:03:47.703]  They cannot stop us from exercising our constitutional rights.
[01:03:47.703 --> 01:03:50.904]  Exactly, and I don't care whether the threat's real or not.
[01:03:50.904 --> 01:03:53.105]  Stop saying that I lose my freedom.
[01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:56.086]  That's the Soviet model, or the totalitarian model.
[01:03:57.037 --> 01:03:57.537]  is to say
[01:04:16.303 --> 01:04:22.607]  I mean, this collectivist idea of we've got to have death panels for old people because we have socialist health care now.
[01:04:22.607 --> 01:04:28.690]  Well, that's why I didn't want socialist health care, because we're now all in this big social engineering nightmare.
[01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:29.270]  Great points.
[01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:31.171]  Anything else?
[01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:32.111]  No, that's it.
[01:04:32.111 --> 01:04:33.152]  Thanks, man.
[01:04:33.152 --> 01:04:33.912]  Thank you.
[01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:38.615]  Looks like they may have located two of the three missing Afghan soldiers in Buffalo,
[01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:41.551]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:43.873]  There were some other Afghans that were missing.
[01:04:43.873 --> 01:04:44.533]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:45.954]  Just print it all.
[01:04:45.954 --> 01:04:48.436]  I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:04:48.436 --> 01:04:49.376]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:04:49.376 --> 01:04:52.639]  I mean, this is... Okay, so they haven't found the three.
[01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:54.160]  And our border's wide open.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.202]  But if I want to fly, I got a naked body scan.
[01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:57.922]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.922 --> 01:04:58.323]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.629 --> 01:05:07.791]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:10.152]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:05:10.152 --> 01:05:15.433]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:20.355]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:20.595 --> 01:05:23.918]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:05:23.918 --> 01:05:27.981]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:05:27.981 --> 01:05:32.305]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:32.305 --> 01:05:42.554]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:05:42.554 --> 01:05:45.056]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,

[01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:04.329]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:04.329 --> 01:06:08.592]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:08.592 --> 01:06:10.373]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:30.051]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:07:30.051 --> 01:07:34.712]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:07:34.712 --> 01:07:36.953]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.695]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.

[01:08:03.539 --> 01:08:10.173]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:13.159]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.801]  We've got open phones today.
[01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:19.444]  Then we have a medical doctor who's an expert on cell phone radiation.
[01:08:19.444 --> 01:08:30.353]  He was in CBS News last week warning of the dangers of brain cancer associated with it saying keep your phone off unless you're using it because it's constantly radiating one way or another.
[01:08:30.353 --> 01:08:32.474]  She's going to be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:08:32.474 --> 01:08:39.940]  We'll have open phones throughout this hour up until the second half of the third hour.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.261]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:41.501]  Mike,
[01:08:42.422 --> 01:08:46.125]  And Renee, and Corey, and Steve, and Chris.
[01:08:46.125 --> 01:08:47.306]  We're going to get to everybody.
[01:08:47.306 --> 01:08:56.893]  The toll-free number to join us, wide open phones, 800-259-9231 on any issue or any question or comment that you have.
[01:08:56.893 --> 01:09:07.200]  Now, I'm not trying to scare people with this, and it may not be anything.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.301]  I want to be clear about that.
[01:09:10.697 --> 01:09:23.686]  But if you remember, just back on August 4th, a little over a month and a half ago, Major General Harold J. Green, the highest ranking U.S.
[01:09:23.686 --> 01:09:30.751]  military officer, not just Army officer, to ever be killed in 240 years of U.S.
[01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:38.616]  history, was shot dead by an Afghan soldier inside of a secure base.
[01:09:42.404 --> 01:10:06.059]  And if you look at the casualty list that I've sit there and track in the news, former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs served in Afghanistan and was actually wounded there repeatedly, so he can speak to this better than I. But most of the time when it's really a fatal bombing or mass shooting, it's an Afghan National Guard or Afghan regular army, and a lot of times it's an officer that does it.
[01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:10.002]  And they'll go into a base, they'll blow it up, they'll go into a CIA base, they'll blow it up.
[01:10:11.505 --> 01:10:18.869]  And just last month, this general got shot dead with some other people by this individual.
[01:10:18.869 --> 01:10:23.411]  So one of the biggest casualty groups out there are these Afghan soldiers.
[01:10:23.411 --> 01:10:26.393]  And we're always told, oh, they're all completely safe.
[01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:28.214]  It's a great winning policy.
[01:10:28.214 --> 01:10:29.535]  Don't worry, it's no big deal.
[01:10:29.535 --> 01:10:33.377]  Even though the military for a decade has been saying this isn't working.
[01:10:33.377 --> 01:10:34.698]  All this is doing is getting us killed.
[01:10:35.563 --> 01:10:38.785]  The Afghan military just doesn't want us here.
[01:10:38.785 --> 01:10:40.065]  We want to go home.
[01:10:40.065 --> 01:10:45.208]  A. B. If you're going to keep us here, we don't want these soldiers in our base.
[01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:45.789]  Okay?
[01:10:45.789 --> 01:10:46.889]  Period.
[01:10:46.889 --> 01:10:50.391]  Because that's one of the highest casualty numbers they have.
[01:10:50.391 --> 01:11:02.118]  Now, just last week, and Joe Biggs is going to go over this, two Afghans that were over here as part of this program came up missing.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:10.163]  Now they say that they have been found inside the United States in Buffalo.
[01:11:10.163 --> 01:11:16.465]  That's just broke on WIVB New York Channel 4.
[01:11:16.465 --> 01:11:22.107]  Separately, we have NBC News reporting on this just an hour ago.
[01:11:22.107 --> 01:11:24.748]  Now it's suddenly breaking on Google News, CBS News.
[01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:27.669]  It's suddenly breaking all over the place right now.
[01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:31.271]  Police searching for missing Afghan soldiers on Cape Cod.
[01:11:32.674 --> 01:11:42.802]  Three Afghanistan Army National Guard soldiers, or excuse me, not National Guard, National Army soldiers, who went missing on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
[01:11:42.802 --> 01:11:47.606]  The soldiers have been at Joint Base Cape Cod since September 11th.
[01:11:47.606 --> 01:11:51.730]  They say there's been a lot of speculation, including that they may be trying to defect.
[01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:52.330]  Defect to who?
[01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:52.951]  They're already here.
[01:11:54.659 --> 01:12:04.767]  No reason to think they have nefarious intent, said Massachusetts State Police Superintendent Colonel Timothy Alban.
[01:12:04.767 --> 01:12:14.394]  Massachusetts National Guard says there's no threat to the public at this time because the soldiers were vetted by a wide variety of agencies before they were brought into the United States.
[01:12:14.394 --> 01:12:16.576]  Well, here's the problem with that.
[01:12:16.576 --> 01:12:22.320]  They supposedly vetted all the people to fight Assad and none of them were Al-Qaeda, when we all know almost all of them were.
[01:12:23.311 --> 01:12:25.372]  Flying Mojave's flags day one.
[01:12:25.372 --> 01:12:26.753]  Our government put them in in Libya.
[01:12:26.753 --> 01:12:28.714]  Tried to put them in in Iraq.
[01:12:28.714 --> 01:12:33.316]  Tried to put them in for destabilization in Egypt.
[01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:40.220]  So the State Department and people trying to act like we didn't know there was Al-Qaeda, now their name's ISIS or ISIL or IS.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.340]  It's all to confuse people.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.701]  I know I harp on this.
[01:12:42.701 --> 01:12:44.682]  Rand Paul, the Senator, is exposing it.
[01:12:44.682 --> 01:12:46.003]  Senator Ted Cruz is exposing it.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:13:01.065]  And I'm proud of the fact that this broadcast the last few years has been the genesis, or the zenith, the flashpoint for forcing this out there so we can have a real debate about what's really happening.
[01:13:01.065 --> 01:13:06.908]  Because any way you slice it, radical, jihadist, islamicist, wahhabist, nutbaggery,
[01:13:08.052 --> 01:13:24.208]  is a real threat to the entire world and is being fueled by criminal elements in our military-industrial complex and foreign-banking combine that want to be able to take our freedoms here at home by pointing their finger at this group of head-chopping scum.
[01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:29.213]  Now, if I see one report, I get a little suspicious of people disappearing.
[01:13:29.213 --> 01:13:30.214]  I see two reports,
[01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:36.712]  I want to know what they're doing bringing Afghan soldiers in here when they have such a track record of attacking.
[01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.674]  With car bombs, you name it.
[01:13:38.674 --> 01:13:40.576]  They want to set up checkpoints all over D.C.
[01:13:40.576 --> 01:13:42.537]  now to, quote, keep the White House safe.
[01:13:42.537 --> 01:13:44.779]  No, it's to train us to live in North Korea.
[01:13:44.779 --> 01:13:49.903]  But let me tell you, the southern and northern borders are wide open and they're bringing jihadis in and they're protecting them.
[01:13:49.903 --> 01:13:54.167]  Now, I'm not saying this last group or this new group are terrorists.
[01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:55.408]  Sure, they're nice people.
[01:13:55.408 --> 01:14:00.332]  What I am saying is they belong to a military that the Afghan National Military
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.762]  That from the numbers I've seen, is the number two group killing coalition or U.S.
[01:14:06.762 --> 01:14:07.882]  soldiers in Afghanistan.
[01:14:07.882 --> 01:14:23.267]  Now, Joe Biggs has been shot and bombed and blown up in APCs by these guys, so he can give us his take on it, and correct me if I'm wrong, but that Colonel Schafferon, who ran the Army program against Al-Qaeda for 10 years, could have killed bin Laden twice, that's come out in congressional testimony.
[01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:28.919]  And he said, no, the numbers are way above 65% being Al Qaeda.
[01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:30.340]  It's more like 95%.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.400]  Well, he said he couldn't say, but it was way over 65.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.561]  Then a little bird told me 95.
[01:14:33.561 --> 01:14:35.682]  So we'll just leave it at that.
[01:14:35.682 --> 01:14:37.962]  But he'd been at Congress briefing him that day.
[01:14:37.962 --> 01:14:41.583]  So they all know this, Joe.
[01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:42.444]  First big picture.
[01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:47.892]  What's your take on these Afghan soldiers, period, bringing them into the U.S.?
[01:14:47.892 --> 01:14:55.918]  And then, my concern is, the globalists could even bring them in, let them go as patsies, and then blame them and set them up for something later.
[01:14:55.918 --> 01:14:57.520]  I mean, there's no telling.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.485]  The Tsarnaev brothers were clearly set up in a false flag, clearly patsies in a larger operation of the Boston bombing.
[01:15:03.485 --> 01:15:10.370]  Had a former top CIA analyst and black ops on the ground commando, Steele, just Friday, saying the same stuff.
[01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:12.592]  I mean, anybody that studies this can see it.
[01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:13.753]  What's your take, Joe Biggs?
[01:15:14.193 --> 01:15:15.814]  Well, these aren't just regular soldiers.
[01:15:15.814 --> 01:15:19.537]  These are three ANA Afghan National Army officers.
[01:15:19.537 --> 01:15:21.279]  One major, two captains.
[01:15:21.279 --> 01:15:26.323]  So these are officers in the Afghan Army, now out in the streets.
[01:15:26.323 --> 01:15:28.284]  We know we have sleeper cells out there.
[01:15:28.284 --> 01:15:30.346]  Maybe they need some commanding behind it.
[01:15:30.346 --> 01:15:32.428]  You know, that's a big concern.
[01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:33.889]  You know, in my time in Afghanistan...
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.968]  My little base I lived on, I had to share a compound with the Afghan National Army.
[01:15:41.968 --> 01:15:49.937]  And you have to sleep with one eye open, literally, because there were numerous times these guys would come up to my soldiers and threaten to kill them.
[01:15:50.765 --> 01:16:00.208]  And I had to go out on one time, one instance I'll never forget, and I put a grenade launcher in this guy's face and I said, hey, if you ever threaten one of my soldiers again, I'm gonna blow your head off.
[01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:04.869]  And then the interpreter came over and I was like, you need to interpret what I'm saying.
[01:16:04.869 --> 01:16:05.590]  He's like, no, I'm not.
[01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:07.650]  So I pulled out my sidearm and I'm sitting there holding two guns.
[01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.452]  I'm like, you need to tell him what's gonna happen if he threatens one of my guys again.
[01:16:11.452 --> 01:16:12.792]  So you don't know who they're bringing in.
[01:16:12.792 --> 01:16:15.293]  They bring in all kinds of people and people are like, well,
[01:16:15.973 --> 01:16:17.134]  No one has that much patience.
[01:16:17.134 --> 01:16:19.815]  That's all they have in Afghanistan is patience.
[01:16:19.815 --> 01:16:23.637]  They sit around and wait and wait and wait and wait to strike.
[01:16:23.637 --> 01:16:25.178]  They have no problem doing that.
[01:16:25.178 --> 01:16:27.379]  They are a very patient group of people.
[01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:30.881]  And to sit there and make their way in the ranks and then get into a U.S.
[01:16:30.881 --> 01:16:35.303]  Army base and to start assassinating people, it's very probable.
[01:16:35.303 --> 01:16:36.924]  It happens all the time.
[01:16:36.924 --> 01:16:39.085]  Major Hassan waited two years before he did anything.
[01:16:40.185 --> 01:16:43.006]  They have tons of patience, that's what people need to get through their head.
[01:16:43.006 --> 01:16:47.328]  When something like this happens, like you said, it may or may not, it could be something, it could not.
[01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:55.251]  But it's definitely something to take consideration, and it's something I hope they can find, get pictures up on TV and look for these guys, because that's a very shady thing.
[01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:58.072]  They bring them in September 11th and now they lose them at a mall?
[01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:01.674]  Why were they allowed to be at a mall to just wander off?
[01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:07.504]  Well, I mean, it may just be that, hey, America is a lot better than, you know, Afghanistan.
[01:17:07.504 --> 01:17:09.647]  I haven't been there, but I've watched the videos.
[01:17:09.647 --> 01:17:10.528]  You've lived it.
[01:17:10.528 --> 01:17:11.930]  I mean, so maybe that's what's happening.
[01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:13.452]  Probably great guys.
[01:17:13.452 --> 01:17:16.457]  But statistically, Afghan National Army
[01:17:18.394 --> 01:17:21.835]  From what I've seen is the number two cause of death right over there for U.S.
[01:17:21.835 --> 01:17:22.275]  soldiers.
[01:17:22.275 --> 01:17:27.056]  So it's not like we're being conspiracy theorists here saying, wow, this is troubling.
[01:17:27.056 --> 01:17:34.417]  Yeah, we caught two Afghan army guys in placing IEDs to kill us just two miles down the road from our compound.
[01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:39.058]  We actually were sitting there driving down the road and I was like, hey, isn't that a guy that works with us?
[01:17:39.058 --> 01:17:42.879]  And he's sitting there digging and then looks up and he's a fatter off.
[01:17:42.879 --> 01:17:45.720]  And I'm like, that's the guy that lives with us.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:45.980]  Really?
[01:17:47.352 --> 01:17:49.873]  I mean, you can't trust them at all!
[01:17:49.873 --> 01:17:58.698]  It is... That's just... That's the scary thing, because these guys should be watched 24-7 by armed guards to let this happen.
[01:17:58.698 --> 01:18:00.319]  That just blows my mind.
[01:18:00.319 --> 01:18:02.960]  Well, why not train them at a foreign military base?
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.741]  What are they doing training them in the U.S.?
[01:18:04.741 --> 01:18:07.683]  See, the thing they're gonna say, though, is, we've been bringing in foreign troops forever.
[01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:13.806]  Well, we bring in German troops, we bring in stuff like that, we bring in other allies, but this is different.
[01:18:13.806 --> 01:18:15.667]  Because, like you said, the track record isn't good with them.
[01:18:16.618 --> 01:18:17.538]  We know they defect.
[01:18:17.538 --> 01:18:19.979]  We know they turn on people and they shoot them.
[01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:21.199]  Like you said, that general was killed.
[01:18:21.199 --> 01:18:31.282]  That's the highest ranking military person killed by one of these Afghan soldiers who just waited, waited for that right time and took it.
[01:18:31.282 --> 01:18:34.643]  And then meanwhile, they've got the state police going, oh, there's no problem.
[01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:35.403]  Nothing's going on.
[01:18:35.403 --> 01:18:36.563]  It's ridiculous.
[01:18:36.563 --> 01:18:37.864]  Everything's fine.
[01:18:37.864 --> 01:18:40.104]  Well, then I want to be treated like I'm not a terrorist.
[01:18:40.104 --> 01:18:42.045]  Then when I pull up to some checkpoint.
[01:18:42.045 --> 01:18:42.405]  Yeah.
[01:18:42.405 --> 01:18:43.925]  I mean, I'm tired of this, man.
[01:18:43.925 --> 01:18:45.906]  Well, it's funny because they said they vetted him.
[01:18:46.906 --> 01:18:48.588]  Like, what is their vetting process?
[01:18:48.588 --> 01:18:51.191]  Because their vetting processes haven't worked thus far.
[01:18:51.191 --> 01:18:55.656]  You know, I've got friends who have been shot, who have been killed by these guys before.
[01:18:55.656 --> 01:18:58.839]  And as you can see, I get blood red talking about it.
[01:18:58.839 --> 01:19:01.142]  I don't trust them whatsoever, as far as I can tell.
[01:19:01.142 --> 01:19:06.668]  And the fact that they bring them into our country, and they're not even watching them, and they're allowing this, and this is the second time.
[01:19:07.569 --> 01:19:09.571]  That's just, that's crazy.
[01:19:09.571 --> 01:19:14.176]  You know, our borders are open, we're creating these groups so we can topple these other regimes.
[01:19:14.176 --> 01:19:20.122]  You know, there's another huge terrorist group right now that they're calling Khorasan, that's the next big group.
[01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:27.851]  And the reason they're bad is because the guy who leads it has links to Al-Qaeda, and most of his guys have passports to Western countries.
[01:19:29.554 --> 01:19:31.656]  You can just feel a big terror attack coming.
[01:19:31.656 --> 01:19:32.777]  I feel it.
[01:19:32.777 --> 01:19:34.518]  They want Syria bad.
[01:19:34.518 --> 01:19:36.259]  These guys are out of Syria.
[01:19:36.259 --> 01:19:37.140]  They want Syria.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:37.781]  They want Assad.
[01:19:37.781 --> 01:19:40.703]  I want to come back and hear about this new group that's got the U.S.
[01:19:40.703 --> 01:19:41.404]  passports.
[01:19:41.404 --> 01:19:48.069]  And again, we're not saying the whole government's going to let this happen, but criminal elements at the top over and over again do this.
[01:19:48.069 --> 01:19:50.451]  And then the government won't even get in trouble for letting us get attacked.
[01:19:50.451 --> 01:19:52.593]  When it happens, they'll get more of our freedoms.
[01:19:52.593 --> 01:19:53.293]  That's all they want.
[01:19:53.293 --> 01:19:55.015]  I mean, this is ridiculous, folks.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.163]  It's ridiculous!
[01:19:57.163 --> 01:19:59.331]  We'll be right back and then your phone calls are coming up.
[01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:00.134]  Stay with us.

[01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:02.552]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:02.552 --> 01:22:07.655]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:07.655 --> 01:22:15.781]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:20.323]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:20.323 --> 01:22:24.126]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:24.286 --> 01:22:30.228]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:30.228 --> 01:22:33.389]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:33.389 --> 01:22:38.770]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:04.913]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?

[01:24:02.618 --> 01:24:11.685]  Alex Jones here, back live, next segment a bunch of breaking news and your phone calls from folks patiently holding.
[01:24:11.685 --> 01:24:25.496]  Former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is in studio with us, one of our reporters, and we're going over the fact that Afghan National Army officers, three of them, a major and two captains, have come up missing
[01:24:27.757 --> 01:24:36.504]  And this is a group that's well known to attack and to basically operate as sleeper cells.
[01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:39.006]  We're not saying these guys are that.
[01:24:39.006 --> 01:24:43.709]  We're just saying they come from a group chopped full of it.
[01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:47.572]  And then Joe, you were bringing up this new group they're talking about.
[01:24:47.572 --> 01:24:52.176]  I mean, it's just jihadis are activating all over the world right now.
[01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:54.858]  And then meanwhile, I saw a story over the weekend on NBC News
[01:24:55.949 --> 01:25:01.286]  Breitbart had it as well, where you can't have an American flag at your university because it might offend someone.
[01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:05.612]  People need to say no to all this.
[01:25:05.612 --> 01:25:08.834]  This political correctness is killing this country.
[01:25:08.834 --> 01:25:11.656]  And I'm not somebody that's, quote, Islamophobe, because it's true.
[01:25:11.656 --> 01:25:13.317]  I've studied the demographics of the Middle East.
[01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:14.859]  Most countries just want to live in peace.
[01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:16.580]  They want to have a job and be left alone.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:23.125]  But the jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and other areas are being funded and turned loose to run wild.
[01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:25.507]  And then we're not even supposed to criticize them, Joe.
[01:25:26.927 --> 01:25:27.408]  It's crazy.
[01:25:27.408 --> 01:25:31.832]  I've been to so many countries around this world, and they all wave their flags proudly.
[01:25:31.832 --> 01:25:36.956]  And if you were to bring in a flag of another country and wave it around, that would be very offensive to them.
[01:25:36.956 --> 01:25:46.024]  Meanwhile, here in America, when we want to wave our own flag and we want to have pride for our country, we're looked at like terrorists.
[01:25:46.024 --> 01:25:54.131]  I mean, what have we come to, to where you can't walk up and down the streets waving an American flag or hang one from your apartment complex without someone threatening to kick you out?
[01:25:55.353 --> 01:25:59.876]  Well, obviously the flag's been used for a bunch of corruption, but it doesn't mean that the flag symbolizes that.
[01:25:59.876 --> 01:26:06.801]  For me, it symbolizes the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Second Amendment, national sovereignty, our amazing history.
[01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:09.503]  When stacked up to other countries, it is exceptional.
[01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:13.946]  But the leftists are attacking it because they want us to adopt their new globalist ideology.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.261]  But just look at how they lecture us.
[01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.404]  You can't have an American flag at public school that's offensive.
[01:26:20.404 --> 01:26:22.445]  You can't have an NRA shirt.
[01:26:22.445 --> 01:26:26.368]  But we can teach jihadi garbage in the public schools.
[01:26:26.368 --> 01:26:28.309]  Talk about this new terror group.
[01:26:28.309 --> 01:26:37.715]  So a new article out in The Independent came out talking about a shadowy group of extremists with links to Al-Qaeda as big as a threat as the Islamic State.
[01:26:37.715 --> 01:26:40.097]  Basically what they're saying is they have
[01:26:40.797 --> 01:26:47.060]  A huge expertise in making bombs coupled with the presence of jihadist fighters with western passports in its ranks.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:50.702]  You know, that's what makes it a very significant threat to the homeland right now.
[01:26:50.702 --> 01:26:52.002]  And the name of the new group?
[01:26:52.002 --> 01:26:52.783]  Khorasan.
[01:26:52.783 --> 01:26:55.344]  K-H-O-R-A-S-A-N.
[01:26:55.344 --> 01:27:01.527]  We have articles where, and video, where in Turkey they let ISIS ride around with their weapons on the trains.
[01:27:02.307 --> 01:27:06.934]  When nobody else can own guns, they let them travel freely.
[01:27:06.934 --> 01:27:09.317]  England's letting them fly back and forth.
[01:27:09.317 --> 01:27:11.520]  It's so clear the West is helping these guys.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.623]  Well this is the thing though, from a military aspect...
[01:27:14.714 --> 01:27:20.696]  That huge convoy we've seen videos of where ISIS is coming into Iraq and their vehicles are butt-to-butt.
[01:27:20.696 --> 01:27:22.176]  They've got all this military equipment.
[01:27:22.176 --> 01:27:22.956]  They've stolen U.S.
[01:27:22.956 --> 01:27:24.117]  military equipment.
[01:27:24.117 --> 01:27:28.558]  That is something you don't do when you have military knowledge.
[01:27:28.558 --> 01:27:29.298]  All right?
[01:27:29.298 --> 01:27:32.679]  So when you do a convoy with military, you have spacing.
[01:27:32.679 --> 01:27:38.581]  So if someone hits you with a mortar, whatever, some kind of air asset, it only takes out one vehicle.
[01:27:38.581 --> 01:27:39.481]  These guys have
[01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:42.536]  They know that no one's going to mess with them.
[01:27:42.536 --> 01:27:44.397]  That's why they're riding bumper to bumper.
[01:27:44.397 --> 01:27:52.422]  Because, like I said, with that convoy leading into Iraq, we could have taken out all of ISIS in a couple airstrikes and been done with it.
[01:27:52.422 --> 01:27:58.005]  The fact that we knew that they were doing that and we did nothing about it, and they're just on a remote road where there would be no collateral.
[01:27:58.005 --> 01:28:02.808]  Well, now we've confirmed they've got Chevy trucks fitted in Texas for U.S.
[01:28:02.808 --> 01:28:03.589]  Special Forces.
[01:28:04.469 --> 01:28:05.470]  It's been given to them.
[01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:07.551]  They didn't just steal it out of bunkers.
[01:28:07.551 --> 01:28:10.312]  Boy, they've got brand new Toyota Hilux short bed trucks.
[01:28:10.312 --> 01:28:13.294]  I mean, they've got tons of new toys now.
[01:28:13.294 --> 01:28:17.316]  I mean, they picked up, what is it, 198 Howitzers.
[01:28:17.316 --> 01:28:19.477]  They've gotten anti-aircraft stuff.
[01:28:19.477 --> 01:28:23.219]  They've got all of our Humvees, tanks.
[01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:27.321]  Anybody goes and walks into a base and tries to drive a tank is not going to be able to do it.
[01:28:28.168 --> 01:28:35.256]  You know, the fact that these guys, you know that the government has something to do with it, because they wouldn't even know how to operate that stuff.
[01:28:35.256 --> 01:28:47.590]  You know, I know a buddy, it took him six months to even learn how to actually shoot a .198, much, you know, let alone be a part of an entire artillery section to learn every position there at the gun.
[01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:48.991]  It's incredible.
[01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.192]  It's a whole science.
[01:28:50.192 --> 01:28:51.052]  Yeah, it is.
[01:28:51.052 --> 01:28:53.373]  It takes some people a lifetime to master.
[01:28:53.373 --> 01:28:56.694]  And I've got a lot of buddies in artillery who pride themselves in that.
[01:28:56.694 --> 01:29:04.077]  So the fact that these guys are able to just hop in and take these pieces and then use them and put them in play, you know that there's military U.S.
[01:29:04.077 --> 01:29:05.238]  backing in there.
[01:29:05.238 --> 01:29:06.138]  Well, they trained them.
[01:29:06.138 --> 01:29:12.561]  That was the big controversy the last few years in Jordan and some bases in Iraq and in Turkey.
[01:29:12.561 --> 01:29:13.741]  And now they're just pouring in.
[01:29:13.741 --> 01:29:14.942]  What do you think the endgame is?
[01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:17.492]  We want to go to Syria.
[01:29:17.492 --> 01:29:19.174]  We want to take out the Assad regime.
[01:29:19.174 --> 01:29:23.378]  We need bad guys like ISIS, Islamic State, ISIL, whatever, Khorasan to...
[01:29:26.067 --> 01:29:27.307]  Give us reasons to go.
[01:29:27.307 --> 01:29:30.288]  Like I said, it's always that humanitarian means.
[01:29:30.288 --> 01:29:32.828]  Because last time with the Assad, it was the chemical attacks.
[01:29:32.828 --> 01:29:35.249]  Now we have the Ebola thing in Africa.
[01:29:35.249 --> 01:29:37.449]  They also want to bring these guys into America.
[01:29:37.449 --> 01:29:44.770]  You know, once you get people scared enough at home, they're going to be like, the government's going to go like, see, look, all this bad stuff happens if you don't have us.
[01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:45.451]  That's it.
[01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:47.311]  That's exactly what's happening.
[01:29:47.311 --> 01:29:49.031]  And then now we can go get these bad guys.
[01:29:49.031 --> 01:29:51.572]  You know, all these new ISIS propaganda videos are coming out.
[01:29:51.572 --> 01:29:52.072]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.072 --> 01:29:53.092]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.113 --> 01:29:57.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.297 --> 01:29:58.900]  It makes our military want to get bigger.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:29:59.761]  I hear you.
[01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.043]  I hear you.
[01:30:01.043 --> 01:30:09.496]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:16.220]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:20.223]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:30:20.223 --> 01:30:21.864]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:25.847]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[01:30:26.027 --> 01:30:34.713]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:30:34.713 --> 01:30:42.819]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[01:30:42.819 --> 01:30:46.482]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[01:30:46.482 --> 01:30:52.286]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at
[01:30:52.426 --> 01:30:55.790]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:02.370]  Another major health threat.
[01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:07.353]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:07.353 --> 01:31:10.015]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:10.015 --> 01:31:17.060]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:20.062]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:20.062 --> 01:31:23.104]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:25.025]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:25.025 --> 01:31:27.867]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:27.947 --> 01:31:33.672]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:33.672 --> 01:31:37.174]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:31:37.174 --> 01:31:40.277]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:47.602]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:32:01.071 --> 01:32:04.733]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:04.733 --> 01:32:09.014]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:09.014 --> 01:32:10.795]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:10.795 --> 01:32:16.137]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:32:16.137 --> 01:32:18.658]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:19.798]  But for how long?
[01:32:19.798 --> 01:32:21.339]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:32:22.039 --> 01:32:26.432]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor dot com.
[01:32:26.432 --> 01:32:28.318]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:32:28.318 --> 01:32:29.261]  Just won't quit.
[01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:35.252]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:32:35.252 --> 01:32:40.035]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:40.035 --> 01:32:41.356]  Talk about the effects.
[01:32:41.356 --> 01:32:42.876]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:32:42.876 --> 01:32:44.798]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:32:44.798 --> 01:32:45.898]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:45.898 --> 01:32:46.619]  I feel better.
[01:32:46.619 --> 01:32:47.679]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:48.640]  I love it.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:51.642]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:32:51.642 --> 01:32:54.563]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:32:54.563 --> 01:32:55.644]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:32:55.644 --> 01:32:56.825]  Consult your physician.
[01:32:56.825 --> 01:32:59.206]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:00.127]  This is life changing.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:21.203]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.203 --> 01:33:23.084]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:33:23.084 --> 01:33:31.246]  We're going to go to Mike, and Rene, and Chris, and Corey, and Steve, and then everybody else that calls in.
[01:33:31.246 --> 01:33:40.349]  I'm going to take a ton of calls up to the bottom of the next hour when we have a medical doctor joining us to give you the facts on the dangers of cell phone radiation.
[01:33:41.564 --> 01:33:53.774]  And let me tell you, I know we all know there's a danger, and the studies show that going back 20 years or more, but all of us tend to not use hands-free, not use a wire.
[01:33:53.774 --> 01:33:55.836]  My friends, my family that know this keep doing it.
[01:33:55.836 --> 01:33:56.457]  We've all
[01:33:58.188 --> 01:34:08.552]  We've got to get a handle on frequency pollution and cause a national debate about it and get out of the habit of just holding a cell phone up to our head and radiating ourselves.
[01:34:08.552 --> 01:34:12.013]  I use landlines for 90 plus percent of my communications.
[01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:13.614]  I use cell phones when I'm on the road.
[01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:16.155]  I've got to pick my kids up from school.
[01:34:16.155 --> 01:34:17.415]  I've got to pick somebody up from the airport.
[01:34:17.415 --> 01:34:19.336]  They're very useful.
[01:34:19.336 --> 01:34:21.557]  But people that are giving them to their kids?
[01:34:22.998 --> 01:34:27.503]  I see little kids, I go to the mall just with them glued to their heads and they are cooking their brains.
[01:34:27.503 --> 01:34:28.744]  It is a fact.
[01:34:28.744 --> 01:34:31.467]  So we're going to discuss that coming up in one hour.
[01:34:31.467 --> 01:34:39.975]  Briefly, three times a day, morning, noon and night, I take a shot of Super Male Vitality.
[01:34:39.975 --> 01:34:44.720]  That's a whole bunch of different key herbs and extracts, organic, concentrated.
[01:34:47.677 --> 01:34:56.305]  Cold pressed, and I mix in other things like fluoride shield, it's a chelator, it doesn't just cut out the fluoride.
[01:34:56.305 --> 01:35:07.014]  The survival shield, nascent iodine X2, and I mix it up in a glass of water three times a day and I take it and it has been life changing for me.
[01:35:07.014 --> 01:35:07.455]  You've heard
[01:35:09.005 --> 01:35:10.488]  The rave reviews by listeners.
[01:35:10.488 --> 01:35:15.837]  You've heard what folks have said it's done for their vitality, done in their relationships, you name it.
[01:35:15.837 --> 01:35:21.267]  We now have a female formula out that just has two other ingredients in it as well that really supercharge women.
[01:35:22.992 --> 01:35:25.734]  Whether it's exercise, health, you name it.
[01:35:25.734 --> 01:35:27.795]  Try a bottle of Super Female Vitality.
[01:35:27.795 --> 01:35:30.097]  Try a bottle of Super Male Vitality.
[01:35:30.097 --> 01:35:35.920]  Try a bottle of X2 Nascent Iodine, a type that no one else has.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.882]  Very palatable, very easy to get down compared to others.
[01:35:38.882 --> 01:35:41.404]  From a pure crystal deep earth source.
[01:35:41.404 --> 01:35:43.725]  The actual iodine crystals.
[01:35:43.725 --> 01:35:48.748]  We're really proud of the products we've deployed out there against the globalists.
[01:35:48.748 --> 01:35:51.250]  It has helped us fund our operation as well.
[01:35:53.203 --> 01:36:07.533]  We have developed and deployed a whole bunch of just super high-quality products, more Occupower, the strongest eye formula that we know of out there, of patented ingredients that are known and have been proven to help eyesight.
[01:36:08.374 --> 01:36:10.515]  Not just your eyes, but other nerves as well.
[01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:15.037]  The Oxy Powder that is just so amazing at flushing out your guts.
[01:36:15.037 --> 01:36:17.918]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.042]  You can also go to InfowarsStore.com and find the products.
[01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:31.125]  You can find the Made in America t-shirts, the new Molon Labe shirt.
[01:36:31.125 --> 01:36:34.988]  We have a second design out now that is now the new bestseller.
[01:36:34.988 --> 01:36:38.070]  We call it the 50 Cal 1776.
[01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:43.073]  We've got the new Molon Labe ball caps and beanies because the winter is coming.
[01:36:43.073 --> 01:36:46.255]  And all of your purchases fund this operation.
[01:36:46.255 --> 01:36:50.258]  Now we can sell you these caps and shirts for $10 if they were made in China.
[01:36:50.258 --> 01:36:51.479]  We can buy them for $2 a piece.
[01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:57.884]  We get them made in America, so they cost us $10 to $14, just because of the regulations and taxes.
[01:36:57.884 --> 01:37:02.607]  And the companies we're buying these from can barely operate at those prices.
[01:37:02.607 --> 01:37:08.572]  We have golf shirts that would be $80 to $100 at Dillard's or Nordstrom's.
[01:37:08.572 --> 01:37:14.577]  Made in America brand, branded to made in 1776, for half the price they would be at Nordstrom's.
[01:37:15.387 --> 01:37:17.807]  Beautiful golf shirts, folks just love them.
[01:37:17.807 --> 01:37:20.848]  And people will ask, what does made in 1776 mean?
[01:37:20.848 --> 01:37:30.210]  So we have kind of the low-key shirts that aren't really aggressive, right up to stuff with Spartan War helmets, saying, Molon Labe, come and take it, Infowars.com.
[01:37:30.210 --> 01:37:33.871]  And we sold out of all the belt buckles, but we didn't print 250 of them.
[01:37:33.871 --> 01:37:39.212]  They're not printed, they're forged, brass and nickel-plated if you want it, but those are sold out.
[01:37:39.212 --> 01:37:44.213]  250 did just come in, they'll sell out very quickly, and then that's it, because we only print 1,000 of them total.
[01:37:45.933 --> 01:37:47.074]  What is it?
[01:37:47.074 --> 01:37:50.316]  500 of the brass and then 500 of the brass with the nickel.
[01:37:50.316 --> 01:37:54.359]  They couldn't produce as many as we needed, so one shipment was late.
[01:37:54.359 --> 01:37:55.540]  So those have come in.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:38:00.543]  They will sell out very, very quickly at madein1776.com.
[01:38:00.543 --> 01:38:11.550]  And I run a big operation now with over 50 crew, news division, nightly news, documentary films, breaking news, syndicated radio, three major news websites, a TV site.
[01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:15.193]  All of it is funded by you supporting us in the Info War.
[01:38:16.614 --> 01:38:19.196]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:38:19.196 --> 01:38:25.161]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or subscribe to the Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:25.161 --> 01:38:30.386]  Now I'm going to go to your phone calls for the balance of the hour right into the next hour.
[01:38:30.386 --> 01:38:37.792]  I also want to remind you, if you're listening to us on AM or FM station, tell everyone you know to listen every time you see them.
[01:38:38.848 --> 01:38:43.810]  Hand out cards, become a sponsor, thank the local sponsor, thank the station.
[01:38:43.810 --> 01:38:51.513]  That's how we've gone from being on about 100 radio stations to over 170 now and growing.
[01:38:51.513 --> 01:38:54.454]  Because you're always having stations that sell or change format.
[01:38:54.454 --> 01:39:06.678]  I can't tell you how many stations we've been on over the years and get really good ratings for them and move from the weekends to the weeknight to the weekdays and then they get bought out and turn into ESPN.
[01:39:06.678 --> 01:39:08.099]  We probably, let's not exaggerate,
[01:39:10.014 --> 01:39:17.076]  There's been more than a hundred affiliates over the years that have gone ESPN.
[01:39:17.076 --> 01:39:18.096]  Hey, great, ESPN.
[01:39:18.096 --> 01:39:20.217]  It's fun to listen to all the sports courses.
[01:39:20.217 --> 01:39:22.237]  The country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:39:22.237 --> 01:39:25.858]  We need to warn people.
[01:39:25.858 --> 01:39:30.800]  That's why I get so mad at football because I played football.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.200]  I get liking football.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.681]  But the country is going to hell in a handbasket and
[01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:42.543]  It's so frustrating to get number one ratings in a place like Orlando.
[01:39:42.543 --> 01:39:45.203]  And we're back on Orlando now, but that's good.
[01:39:45.203 --> 01:39:48.664]  Number one was in the newspaper!
[01:39:48.664 --> 01:39:50.125]  Up against Rush Limbaugh, everybody.
[01:39:50.125 --> 01:39:52.285]  Number one, that's happened over and over again.
[01:39:52.285 --> 01:39:54.526]  And then they just come in and go, we can give you more money, go to ESPN.
[01:39:56.468 --> 01:39:57.748]  I just want to throw up.
[01:39:57.748 --> 01:39:59.989]  See, it isn't just about getting the ratings, folks.
[01:39:59.989 --> 01:40:01.690]  People have to support it.
[01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:05.211]  And we've been successful as a small, independent radio show.
[01:40:05.211 --> 01:40:09.032]  There are no other independent radio shows that are syndicated like this.
[01:40:09.032 --> 01:40:11.392]  We literally, by the grace of God, are here.
[01:40:11.392 --> 01:40:12.853]  That's why I'm so thankful to everybody.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.261]  Who supported us to spread the word.
[01:40:15.261 --> 01:40:20.464]  So become a sponsor, promote those stations, and let them know you're supporting the show as well.
[01:40:20.464 --> 01:40:22.124]  And then we can turn this country around.
[01:40:22.124 --> 01:40:24.366]  You've got to vote with your dollars.
[01:40:24.366 --> 01:40:25.786]  You've got to vote with your feet.
[01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:29.728]  You've got to vote with your actions.
[01:40:29.728 --> 01:40:30.769]  NPR doesn't need that.
[01:40:30.769 --> 01:40:32.270]  They just get taxpayer money.
[01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:35.892]  And then still beg for money locally from the slobs that give them cash.
[01:40:35.892 --> 01:40:36.412]  We don't do that.
[01:40:36.412 --> 01:40:37.793]  We sell high quality products.
[01:40:37.793 --> 01:40:42.135]  And then they have national media go, how dare Alex Jones sell videos and books and t-shirts.
[01:40:42.591 --> 01:40:48.855]  That's right, it'd be much more moral if I just got taxpayer money, right?
[01:40:48.855 --> 01:40:50.817]  And then promoted anti-Second Amendment?
[01:40:50.817 --> 01:40:53.379]  Oh my gosh, the Liberty Movement's funding itself!
[01:40:53.379 --> 01:41:00.624]  When those secret Bill Clinton documents came out four months ago from his presidential library, they released them via a four-year suit.
[01:41:01.886 --> 01:41:05.029]  When that stuff came out, it was in 1994.
[01:41:05.029 --> 01:41:14.699]  If we let independent media with Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center start, other people will start new media, and then we won't control the paradigm through the controlled press and state-run media.
[01:41:14.699 --> 01:41:16.220]  We've got to shut them down.
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:24.449]  And the worst part about Western Journalism Center is they're selling subscriptions to news and are funding themselves and don't need the big corporations or tax money.
[01:41:25.249 --> 01:41:28.113]  Why, if this ever becomes popular, that's it for us!
[01:41:28.113 --> 01:41:37.185]  I mean, it is such a dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty... CNN reported on it!
[01:41:37.185 --> 01:41:39.549]  Previously secret Clinton White House documents released!
[01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:47.512]  And it says we have to meet with the mainstream media and tell them to call anyone conspiracy theorist.
[01:41:47.512 --> 01:41:52.035]  That's why we come out a month and a half ago and go, Ebola appears to be becoming more and more airborne.
[01:41:52.035 --> 01:41:56.777]  Now here's a government report, and also they say it could spread to millions.
[01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.538]  Oh my gosh, you're a fear monger!
[01:41:58.538 --> 01:41:59.558]  Oh, this is so horrible!
[01:41:59.558 --> 01:42:01.379]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:42:01.379 --> 01:42:02.800]  A month and a half later, it's mainstream news.
[01:42:04.366 --> 01:42:12.568]  You could say that the sun comes up in the morning and if you're not establishment, they're going to attack you because you're seen as competition.
[01:42:12.568 --> 01:42:14.728]  And I expect that from purely state-run media.
[01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:29.911]  But I'll tell you one thing, to see major libertarian, conservative, constitutional media infighting and sneaking around doing attack pieces on each other, man, we're going to lose everything if we don't come together.
[01:42:31.348 --> 01:42:42.873]  If you don't have that basic instinct, that if you were for the Second Amendment and private property rights and the family and basic judicial justice and having a country, then you had better come together for liberty.
[01:42:42.873 --> 01:42:43.913]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:42:43.913 --> 01:42:44.954]  I'm going to your calls.
[01:42:44.954 --> 01:42:47.075]  Mike and then Renee and others.
[01:42:47.075 --> 01:42:48.695]  Mike in Missouri, thanks for holding.
[01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:49.296]  You're on the air.
[01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:50.616]  Go ahead.
[01:42:50.616 --> 01:42:56.499]  And there's something going on, but you don't do know what it is, don't you, Mr. Jones?
[01:42:56.499 --> 01:42:57.459]  To quote Bob Dylan.
[01:42:59.129 --> 01:43:01.870]  Um, there was an article up on Prison Planet yesterday.
[01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:03.131]  I think it's off now.
[01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:08.115]  I wanted to ask you about the possible tactical nuke in Kiev.
[01:43:09.206 --> 01:43:11.967]  Well yeah, I don't think the story is off.
[01:43:11.967 --> 01:43:15.109]  What happens is it scrolls off the front page into the archives.
[01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:18.590]  In fact, if you guys pull that out of the Sunday stack, I covered it yesterday.
[01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:29.135]  A giant munitions plant got blown up in eastern Ukraine and clearly Russian forces or allied forces fired three missiles into it.
[01:43:30.035 --> 01:43:30.455]  I don't
[01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:56.092]  Not just seismic, but also radiological stuff being picked up to show it was a nuke.
[01:43:56.092 --> 01:43:57.753]  I mean, if you look at it, it doesn't look like a nuke.
[01:43:57.753 --> 01:44:03.076]  It looks like a slow explosion that you would see from a munitions plant.
[01:44:03.076 --> 01:44:05.158]  Bud, what's your take on that?
[01:44:05.158 --> 01:44:11.722]  Nobody's picked up any other evidence of, like you say, radiological or seismic or anything that they've announced, anyway.
[01:44:12.529 --> 01:44:17.336]  We've looked into it and can't find anything, but I've watched the video of the explosion.
[01:44:17.336 --> 01:44:20.340]  We just played it, and it looks like a fertilizer plant blowing up.
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:23.484]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:44:23.484 --> 01:44:29.953]  And it did put up a mushroom cloud, but any big explosion will put off a mushroom cloud.
[01:44:32.213 --> 01:44:45.901]  I don't know, but I'm very unlikely the Russians would use a tactical nuclear weapon on an ammo dump when all you got to do at a munitions plant is fire missiles into it, and you saw what happened.
[01:44:45.901 --> 01:44:47.062]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:47.062 --> 01:44:47.782]  First time caller.
[01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:49.183]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[01:44:49.183 --> 01:44:53.866]  I've been listening for a while, and I'm spreading the word around Midwest as much as I can.
[01:44:53.866 --> 01:44:55.847]  Well, Mike, thank you so much.
[01:44:55.847 --> 01:44:56.688]  Just to add one more point.
[01:44:58.092 --> 01:44:59.453]  I don't give a lot of speeches.
[01:44:59.453 --> 01:45:03.937]  I gave one for the Stansbury Group because it was in Texas and I could not be away from my kids for a while.
[01:45:03.937 --> 01:45:06.159]  I took my kids with me up there.
[01:45:06.159 --> 01:45:15.847]  And then I spoke for Casey Research, another great group, down in San Antonio to a capacity crowd of high-powered folks.
[01:45:15.847 --> 01:45:22.973]  And these people were all so smart, so classy, so cool, and then thanking me that I just felt bad.
[01:45:22.973 --> 01:45:24.054]  I don't know how to explain it.
[01:45:25.765 --> 01:45:27.146]  I'm not a narcissist.
[01:45:27.146 --> 01:45:31.129]  I come off as one sometimes, because I'm so aggressive and confident.
[01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:33.611]  But I'm always talking about myself, so you know where I'm at.
[01:45:33.611 --> 01:45:36.093]  I'm very humble.
[01:45:36.093 --> 01:45:40.577]  And it is very humbling to see how many amazing people there are out there.
[01:45:40.577 --> 01:45:48.403]  And all I told that crowd was, you better get active, not just at conferences to get more intel, so you're personally successful.
[01:45:48.403 --> 01:45:54.888]  You better get involved in information warfare, and most of them have, using the truth against lies, or we're going to lose everything.
[01:45:56.155 --> 01:46:07.125]  There's a National Review article out today showing again in statistics upwards of 90% of the illegals vote for socialism and gun control.
[01:46:07.125 --> 01:46:17.714]  And conservatives will be like a vestigial claw on a dog's forearm, on a dog's elbow.
[01:46:17.714 --> 01:46:21.938]  I mean, it's just, it's as useful as you know what's on a boar.
[01:46:23.937 --> 01:46:26.579]  And I've never called myself even really a conservative.
[01:46:26.579 --> 01:46:30.203]  I'm a libertarian constitutionalist, classical liberal.
[01:46:30.203 --> 01:46:33.085]  Like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson.
[01:46:33.085 --> 01:46:38.610]  That's... In fact, there's the headline, the liberal newcomers.
[01:46:38.610 --> 01:46:43.274]  And the sub-headline, limit immigration or watch conservative efforts become irrelevant.
[01:46:43.274 --> 01:46:43.494]  Yeah!
[01:46:43.494 --> 01:46:47.458]  I mean, you've got people with no education who've lived in cardboard boxes
[01:46:48.422 --> 01:46:55.284]  They're getting here from Africa and Central and South America and other areas and they don't care folks.
[01:46:55.284 --> 01:46:56.445]  The facts are in.
[01:46:56.445 --> 01:47:02.107]  They are going to vote for whatever the most hardcore Democratic Party people say.
[01:47:02.107 --> 01:47:08.449]  And that's why the Republican leaders are all on board with it because they're all getting their paycheck from the same big banks.
[01:47:08.449 --> 01:47:10.450]  They're all going to retire to an armored country club.
[01:47:10.450 --> 01:47:12.230]  They don't care.
[01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:13.771]  And I'm not against these poor immigrants.
[01:47:14.909 --> 01:47:23.436]  Look, I am against the fact that they are useful idiots, and they're going to take my guns and take my property and force-inoculate me.
[01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:32.303]  They're going to become the bureaucrats and the enforcers, and as bad as America is, it's not Guatemala.
[01:47:32.303 --> 01:47:35.146]  And we're going to be like that now, and it's very sad.
[01:47:35.146 --> 01:47:38.648]  Renee in South Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:47:38.648 --> 01:47:41.251]  Oh, thanks so much for taking my call, Alex.
[01:47:41.251 --> 01:47:42.672]  I wanted to be the voice
[01:47:43.621 --> 01:47:43.961]  I don't
[01:48:02.273 --> 01:48:04.334]  Orphanages in Ireland, Canada, you name it.
[01:48:04.334 --> 01:48:07.515]  They dig up just hundreds, in some cases thousands of dead children.
[01:48:07.515 --> 01:48:10.016]  Native Americans, Irish children, you name it.
[01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:16.499]  And yeah, there is a real cult in government going back thousands of years that likes to prey on children.
[01:48:16.499 --> 01:48:22.281]  Most psychopaths aren't just rogue psychos operating on their own and getting caught.
[01:48:22.281 --> 01:48:27.123]  They organize into guilds so that they can take their time with the children.
[01:48:28.382 --> 01:48:32.544]  Yeah, and if you read some of the witness testimony, this isn't ancient stuff.
[01:48:32.544 --> 01:48:38.367]  This is stuff that's going on, you know, I think the last one that was mentioned was in 2010.
[01:48:38.367 --> 01:48:46.750]  And they have hunting parties where they let these children run for their lives and have dogs chase them.
[01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:49.251]  Yep, well let me just be clear.
[01:48:49.251 --> 01:48:53.473]  I wasn't saying this only happened thousands of years ago.
[01:48:53.473 --> 01:48:54.474]  I was saying that
[01:48:55.612 --> 01:49:00.676]  Every ancient culture, when it declined, sacrificed and tortured children.
[01:49:00.676 --> 01:49:14.246]  Whether it was the Aztecs, whether it was the Babylonians, whether it was the Druids, whether it was the different Mediterranean civilizations, this is what ends up happening.
[01:49:14.246 --> 01:49:15.927]  And it's part of the decline.
[01:49:15.927 --> 01:49:23.073]  You better know that if they're promoting the end of the family, and they're promoting and pushing homosexuality and everything,
[01:49:24.306 --> 01:49:28.949]  On the surface, and I'm not even attacking, you know, people out there.
[01:49:28.949 --> 01:49:30.210]  It's not my ball of wax.
[01:49:30.210 --> 01:49:43.760]  What I'm saying is, historically, we know as historians, even Camille Pagli has written about it, and she's a lesbian, that when you get to this stuff on the surface, down below it means the other stuff's going on.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.982]  And yes, ma'am, DynCorp got caught in 2005
[01:49:49.514 --> 01:49:51.936]  Running giant child roundup rings.
[01:49:51.936 --> 01:49:54.017]  It was even in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:49:54.017 --> 01:49:55.278]  It was even in major papers.
[01:49:55.278 --> 01:49:56.798]  They had congressional testimony.
[01:49:56.798 --> 01:49:58.800]  And no one got in trouble.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.302]  And the reason they didn't was because it's connected to the government.
[01:50:02.302 --> 01:50:04.103]  And that's how they blackmail the judges.
[01:50:04.103 --> 01:50:07.345]  It's how they... That's how they took over Penn State.
[01:50:07.345 --> 01:50:09.146]  It's how they took over Boys Town.
[01:50:09.146 --> 01:50:15.570]  I remember having a former CIA guy on who was also a senator, state senator, John DeCamp, and actually hitting the delay button.
[01:50:16.565 --> 01:50:23.969]  on him ten years ago, fifteen years ago when he was saying Penn State's a pedophile ring and Boys Town's a pedophile ring.
[01:50:23.969 --> 01:50:27.531]  This is before it came out!
[01:50:27.531 --> 01:50:31.232]  Understand folks, this is before it was in the news.
[01:50:31.232 --> 01:50:33.834]  So I hear you ma'am, God bless you.
[01:50:33.834 --> 01:50:39.136]  It is just absolutely hellish what's going on.
[01:50:39.136 --> 01:50:44.139]  And the children out there are not getting any relief
[01:50:46.072 --> 01:50:49.173]  Because people are in denial.
[01:50:49.173 --> 01:50:52.654]  Now there it is, Salon reporting on slave trade whistleblowers vindicated.
[01:50:52.654 --> 01:50:53.954]  Dime Corps.
[01:50:53.954 --> 01:50:55.955]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:55.955 --> 01:50:59.676]  I got death threats, by the way, the last time I was really hammering on that story.
[01:51:15.905 --> 01:51:18.226]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:18.226 --> 01:51:22.928]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?
[01:51:22.928 --> 01:51:24.709]  Get our 10 Reasons book free.
[01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:25.009]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:25.009 --> 01:51:25.189]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:30.762 --> 01:51:33.964]  You heard the discussions all over the radio.
[01:51:33.964 --> 01:51:36.465]  You couldn't believe what you were hearing.
[01:51:36.465 --> 01:51:37.926]  You trusted them.
[01:51:37.926 --> 01:51:39.607]  You felt betrayed.
[01:51:39.607 --> 01:51:42.229]  Your emotions began to consume you.
[01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:43.629]  Outrage set in.
[01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:45.310]  Then, nothing.
[01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:47.552]  Days turned to weeks and months.
[01:51:47.552 --> 01:51:50.453]  Then... But they haven't.
[01:51:50.453 --> 01:51:53.755]  They're still monitoring your every move.
[01:51:53.755 --> 01:51:54.556]  It's coming.
[01:51:54.556 --> 01:51:55.476]  What's coming?
[01:51:55.476 --> 01:51:58.118]  MonitorBlocketPocket.com.
[01:51:58.118 --> 01:51:59.759]  Or will you forget?
[01:52:00.339 --> 01:52:02.740]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:15.744]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:52:16.784 --> 01:52:18.705]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:52:18.705 --> 01:52:20.927]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[01:52:20.927 --> 01:52:27.331]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:27.331 --> 01:52:35.277]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:52:35.917 --> 01:52:41.623]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:52:41.623 --> 01:52:48.610]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:48.970]  That's 877-532-5388.
[01:52:48.970 --> 01:52:50.071]  Or go to faketv.com.
[01:52:50.071 --> 01:52:51.833]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:52:59.961 --> 01:53:01.222]  Another major health threat.
[01:53:01.222 --> 01:53:06.205]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:53:06.205 --> 01:53:08.887]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:53:08.887 --> 01:53:15.932]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:53:15.932 --> 01:53:18.894]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:53:18.894 --> 01:53:21.877]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:53:21.877 --> 01:53:23.878]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:53:23.878 --> 01:53:26.720]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:32.548]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:53:32.548 --> 01:53:36.053]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:53:36.053 --> 01:53:39.138]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:53:39.138 --> 01:53:43.424]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:53:43.544 --> 01:53:46.446]  For every modern independently minded household.
[01:53:46.446 --> 01:53:49.668]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:54:20.463 --> 01:54:22.283]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:22.283 --> 01:54:23.363]  The third hour is coming up.
[01:54:23.363 --> 01:54:26.384]  We'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:54:26.384 --> 01:54:45.548]  Before we go back to them, I just want to mention, coming up for the radio audience and TV audience as well, I'm going to play some of the audio shot inside the man's car with the open window of an unconstitutional, illegal, federally funded, state instituted,
[01:54:47.355 --> 01:54:50.617]  Checkpoint on the highway.
[01:54:50.617 --> 01:55:00.023]  And when the man begins to talk about the Constitution, the whacked out officer rips open the car door and yells like a drill sergeant.
[01:55:00.023 --> 01:55:11.330]  Now that's important because the Associated Press is reporting, quote, snipers, guards, fences, not enough, Secret Service moles, security checkpoints outside the White House on the road.
[01:55:14.514 --> 01:55:15.855]  This has been the plan all along.
[01:55:15.855 --> 01:55:23.820]  So our border's wide open, but illegal checkpoints to then stop people and demand information from them are okay.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:31.726]  And they have private companies in all 50 states hiring cops to make people fill out surveys.
[01:55:31.726 --> 01:55:38.830]  But it turns out that's federally funded to just set the precedent that we're North Korean.
[01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:41.552]  So we're going to break that down coming up.
[01:55:41.552 --> 01:55:42.373]  Some of the other news.
[01:55:43.982 --> 01:55:49.247]  Obama's UN ambassador admits fight against ISIS designed to take out Assad in Syria.
[01:55:49.247 --> 01:55:54.371]  An amazing video of Samantha Powers being interviewed.
[01:55:54.371 --> 01:55:56.693]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:55:56.693 --> 01:56:06.321]  Also, Feds swarm a plane, interrogate passengers over travel group logo that resembles ISIS.
[01:56:06.321 --> 01:56:09.364]  And now Congress has voted for more war in the Middle East.
[01:56:09.364 --> 01:56:10.325]  A Ron Paul article
[01:56:11.536 --> 01:56:13.837]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:56:13.837 --> 01:56:16.798]  I just want to talk to you about what's going on in high schools now.
[01:56:38.911 --> 01:56:45.296]  I got thrown out of school again, second time within a month, for wearing a shirt that had a gun on it.
[01:56:45.296 --> 01:56:49.039]  And, um, it was just a Johnny Cash, uh, Don't Take Your Guns to Town shirt.
[01:56:49.039 --> 01:56:53.343]  And the first time it happened, it was an AR-15, uh, Come and Take It shirt.
[01:56:53.343 --> 01:56:56.065]  And, uh, I had a Constitution on me.
[01:56:56.065 --> 01:57:00.309]  I read the First Amendment to her, and, uh, she just kind of dismissed it like it didn't happen.
[01:57:01.733 --> 01:57:09.265]  And I talked to a school resource officer and he told me that the Constitution, he said, I should enjoy now because it's really not going to be around much longer.
[01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:17.236]  Well, children are getting kicked out of school for bringing a bubble gun that shoots bubbles.
[01:57:17.236 --> 01:57:22.820]  And kids are getting in trouble if they eat a pastry, a Pop-Tart, and it looks like a gun.
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.343]  So soon, I guess, if a cloud looks like a gun, they'll have to arrest you.
[01:57:26.343 --> 01:57:30.606]  This is all just part of the totalitarianism that they just call regulations.
[01:57:30.606 --> 01:57:31.988]  But it's beyond North Korea.
[01:57:34.173 --> 01:57:36.674]  America's a free country, so it can't be happening here.
[01:57:36.674 --> 01:57:39.334]  No, no, it is happening here.
[01:57:39.334 --> 01:57:40.774]  And you should document that.
[01:57:40.774 --> 01:57:43.455]  You should do a news article about it.
[01:57:43.455 --> 01:57:49.576]  But, you know, we see 10-year-olds being suspended for making fingers into the shape of a gun.
[01:57:49.576 --> 01:57:52.037]  This is all part of the social engineering.
[01:57:52.037 --> 01:58:00.079]  But, oh, the kids can go home and play all the murder simulation video games, priming them for drone pilots that they want to.
[01:58:00.079 --> 01:58:01.859]  It's all selective.
[01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:07.271]  And that's a key part to any totalitarian system.
[01:58:07.271 --> 01:58:12.312]  But I also love people that say, oh, the Constitution, I don't want to hear about that in my courtroom.
[01:58:12.312 --> 01:58:14.333]  Yeah, that won't be around long, buddy.
[01:58:14.333 --> 01:58:17.073]  As if they're looking forward to it being gone.
[01:58:17.073 --> 01:58:23.995]  As if they're looking forward to having no checks and balances and being slaves.
[01:58:23.995 --> 01:58:24.755]  Anything else, Corey?
[01:58:24.755 --> 01:58:28.476]  No, that's about it.
[01:58:28.476 --> 01:58:31.597]  Well, what's your school district in Connecticut?
[01:58:31.597 --> 01:58:32.177]  Manchester.
[01:58:33.183 --> 01:58:34.284]  Well, I would write an article about it.
[01:58:34.284 --> 01:58:35.504]  I'd do a YouTube video about it.
[01:58:35.504 --> 01:58:36.225]  That's newsworthy.
[01:58:36.225 --> 01:58:38.686]  When this stuff goes on, speak out about it.
[01:58:38.686 --> 01:58:39.527]  That's the thing to do.
[01:58:39.527 --> 01:58:40.067]  Third hour.
[01:58:40.067 --> 01:58:42.789]  Your phone calls.
[01:58:42.789 --> 01:58:46.771]  The illegal checkpoint in Illinois with the police flipping out.
[01:58:46.771 --> 01:58:47.672]  Really, really sad.
[01:58:47.672 --> 01:58:49.493]  They want to live in North Korea, I'm telling you.
[01:58:52.170 --> 01:58:53.531]  In the near future.
[01:58:53.531 --> 01:58:57.213]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:58:57.213 --> 01:58:58.014]  Security alert.
[01:58:58.014 --> 01:58:59.234]  Security alert.
[01:58:59.234 --> 01:59:01.236]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:01.236 --> 01:59:02.116]  Analysis.
[01:59:02.116 --> 01:59:02.857]  InfoWars.
[01:59:02.857 --> 01:59:04.938]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:04.938 --> 01:59:09.821]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:09.821 --> 01:59:10.862]  Crime directive.
[01:59:10.862 --> 01:59:12.403]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:12.403 --> 01:59:15.265]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:15.265 --> 01:59:18.507]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:18.507 --> 01:59:20.668]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:20.868 --> 01:59:22.329]  These people are assaulting us!
[01:59:22.329 --> 01:59:24.511]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:24.511 --> 01:59:27.112]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:27.112 --> 01:59:31.135]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:31.135 --> 01:59:34.738]  Block free iPhone apps at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:34.738 --> 01:59:38.100]  Block free podcasts and video feeds.
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:39.101]  Imperative.
[01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:41.142]  Destroy Rhythm Planet TV.
[01:59:41.142 --> 01:59:45.685]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:45.685 --> 01:59:47.927]  Collectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:59:53.914 --> 01:59:56.303]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.303 --> 01:59:59.052]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.943 --> 02:00:11.767]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.767 --> 02:00:13.368]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.368 --> 02:00:14.910]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:19.093]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.093 --> 02:00:23.216]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.583 --> 02:00:47.066]  Okay, let's go through your phone calls as quickly as possible here, ahead of a bunch of other key news I'm going to get to, including the national rollout of checkpoints across the country, led by the Secret Service.
[02:00:47.066 --> 02:00:51.287]  And oh, if we're looking for one guy in a county, let's have checkpoints everywhere.
[02:00:51.287 --> 02:00:56.008]  Let's shut down half of Boston looking for one teenage kid who's a patsy.
[02:00:56.008 --> 02:00:57.348]  Never acted like that before.
[02:00:57.348 --> 02:00:58.408]  Why are we doing this now?
[02:00:58.408 --> 02:01:01.669]  It's part of the RAND Corporation's National Stabilization Force.
[02:01:02.503 --> 02:01:07.928]  That's really here to implement martial law and get the public acclimated to it.
[02:01:07.928 --> 02:01:09.549]  Let's go to Chris in New Hampshire.
[02:01:09.549 --> 02:01:10.850]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:11.451]  You're on the air.
[02:01:11.451 --> 02:01:13.333]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:13.333 --> 02:01:14.494]  First time, long time.
[02:01:14.494 --> 02:01:18.617]  I just want to say you're looking great, bud, with the healthy living you're doing right now.
[02:01:18.617 --> 02:01:19.078]  Well, thank you.
[02:01:19.078 --> 02:01:23.522]  I still look like hell, but I look... Before, I looked like something even worse.
[02:01:24.693 --> 02:01:28.656]  Well, I won't say that, but as long as you feel better, man, that's all that matters.
[02:01:28.656 --> 02:01:30.637]  Listen, I'm a touring musician.
[02:01:30.637 --> 02:01:48.449]  I've been traveling around the country six months a year for a pretty long time, so I've been through the checkpoints and I've seen the destabilization of our country firsthand, and it's easy to kind of put it down the border when you live up in New Hampshire like I do, but now I come home and I just wanted to run this by you real quick and I won't take up too much of your time, but
[02:01:48.993 --> 02:01:54.055]  There's a guy up here in New Hampshire named Bill Binney, and it's not the good Bill Binney, I'll call him the bad Bill Binney.
[02:01:54.055 --> 02:01:55.336]  He ran for 2010 U.S.
[02:01:55.336 --> 02:02:02.059]  Senate, and now he is the finance chairman of the Finance Committee.
[02:02:02.059 --> 02:02:05.241]  And he's starting a news network, which is going to cover the primaries here.
[02:02:05.241 --> 02:02:14.145]  So, I just want to tell the first-time listeners or people that are still new, if you're skeptic about, you know, something Alex is saying, just look it up in your own neighborhood or your own community.
[02:02:14.645 --> 02:02:15.946]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:02:15.946 --> 02:02:17.966]  Interesting points.
[02:02:17.966 --> 02:02:18.167]  So often,
[02:02:42.691 --> 02:02:58.922]  The public doesn't understand that the technocrats running our planet to a great extent have unlimited fiat money, and they just give huge portions to it out to their different minion organizations, but it doesn't matter.
[02:02:58.922 --> 02:03:01.204]  Even though they have funding, they don't have audiences.
[02:03:01.792 --> 02:03:05.454]  I don't know of who you speak, so I can't agree or disagree with you.
[02:03:05.454 --> 02:03:09.096]  I'm ignorant of that local factoid.
[02:03:09.096 --> 02:03:18.322]  But that's why it's essential that good people get involved, because there are more of us than them, and people will resonate with us, and we can turn the criminal tide.
[02:03:18.322 --> 02:03:20.223]  Steve in California, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:03:21.207 --> 02:03:22.248]  Alex, thank you.
[02:03:22.248 --> 02:03:34.317]  First time caller and thank God that there's you who has a mouth, who has courage and will not back down because I really don't know who else would do it in these horrible sad times.
[02:03:34.317 --> 02:03:39.401]  And I want to talk about a little bit about
[02:03:41.061 --> 02:03:42.743]  There's a hospital.
[02:03:42.743 --> 02:03:46.386]  If there's time, I wanted to talk about the hospitaling.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.182]  Well, I'm a patient over at this doctor.
[02:04:03.182 --> 02:04:05.864]  I was having some health problems.
[02:04:05.864 --> 02:04:09.667]  I'm an ex-pro-athlete of 14 years.
[02:04:09.667 --> 02:04:12.609]  I was in the wrestling business and all that.
[02:04:12.609 --> 02:04:21.717]  So I went to this doctor because I had some sweat issues or whatever and she made me take this urine testing and then I went back and she said, well,
[02:04:22.691 --> 02:04:31.193]  I can't find anything, but there's a lot of this and that and the other thing, so they found sugar and caffeine was high, so I cut that out.
[02:04:31.193 --> 02:04:33.014]  I instantly felt better.
[02:04:33.014 --> 02:04:37.175]  Now, this doctor, that wasn't enough for her.
[02:04:37.175 --> 02:04:39.695]  She said, well, come back and do the test one more time.
[02:04:39.695 --> 02:04:41.736]  Take a blood sample, urine sample.
[02:04:41.736 --> 02:04:43.296]  Hold on, here's what's going to happen.
[02:04:43.296 --> 02:04:44.817]  I want you to start your story over.
[02:04:44.817 --> 02:04:49.718]  When we come back, I'm going to get into this article that I've been promising to
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:05:08.147]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.147 --> 02:05:13.268]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.268 --> 02:05:19.571]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.994 --> 02:05:37.870]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[02:05:42.298 --> 02:05:44.079]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:44.079 --> 02:05:46.960]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:51.202]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:05:51.202 --> 02:05:53.603]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:05:56.304 --> 02:05:58.664]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:05:58.664 --> 02:05:59.525]  Others don't.
[02:06:00.902 --> 02:06:07.048]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:06:07.048 --> 02:06:10.331]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:10.331 --> 02:06:12.073]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:06:12.073 --> 02:06:18.479]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:18.479 --> 02:06:24.365]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down our pants on the streets?
[02:06:24.525 --> 02:06:28.487]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:28.487 --> 02:06:31.568]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:06:31.568 --> 02:06:39.832]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:06:39.832 --> 02:06:41.933]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:06:41.933 --> 02:06:42.974]  It's a war against the truth.

[02:08:02.587 --> 02:08:05.349]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:05.349 --> 02:08:05.709]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:29.158 --> 02:08:30.718]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:30.718 --> 02:08:31.118]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:31.118 --> 02:08:31.899]  Central, we're here.
[02:08:31.899 --> 02:08:33.519]  Now into hour number three.
[02:08:33.519 --> 02:08:38.840]  We have a medical doctor coming on who's a world-leading expert on cell phone radiation.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:43.061]  Quoted last week by CBS News to look at frequency pollution.
[02:08:43.061 --> 02:08:46.242]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm about to go right back to your phone calls.
[02:08:46.242 --> 02:08:48.863]  Here's some good news.
[02:08:48.863 --> 02:08:54.264]  There's a giant employee exodus from the Department of Homeland Security, and they say it's a growing concern.
[02:08:54.264 --> 02:08:58.545]  The Washington Post reports that it's a dysfunctional work environment.
[02:08:59.653 --> 02:09:02.494]  With abysmal morale.
[02:09:02.494 --> 02:09:09.697]  And they're having a lot of other problems at federal agencies with people just refusing to even show up to work.
[02:09:09.697 --> 02:09:12.458]  And their supervisors refuse to reprimand them.
[02:09:12.458 --> 02:09:14.218]  And so the next thing starts occurring.
[02:09:14.218 --> 02:09:16.139]  It's an epidemic.
[02:09:16.139 --> 02:09:20.261]  Defecating in the halls and at their workstations.
[02:09:20.261 --> 02:09:21.301]  They're just above the law.
[02:09:21.301 --> 02:09:22.401]  They can't get in trouble.
[02:09:22.401 --> 02:09:26.643]  So the next phase is acting like a spoiled two-year-old child.
[02:09:27.674 --> 02:09:29.776]  This is the mental illness of government.
[02:09:29.776 --> 02:09:34.179]  Thank God they're not trying to, you know, child sacrifice and stuff like other spoiled governments do.
[02:09:34.179 --> 02:09:39.363]  Usually, people submit to government so much, they just go, all right, bring your kids up, we're going to chop their hearts out.
[02:09:39.363 --> 02:09:44.607]  Just every culture in the world either burns, eats, or cuts the hearts out of children.
[02:09:44.607 --> 02:09:54.755]  Just every culture, black, white, Mesoamerican natives, you get elite governments in charge, psychos get in charge, and they go, just give me your kids, I'm going to kill them.
[02:09:54.755 --> 02:09:56.216]  And we do, we're like, here are our kids, kill them.
[02:09:57.130 --> 02:09:59.131]  And we line our kids up now and give them all the vaccines.
[02:09:59.131 --> 02:10:00.372]  It's just how we submit.
[02:10:00.372 --> 02:10:04.313]  We give our children to the fires of Molot.
[02:10:04.313 --> 02:10:09.056]  The world's supply of Ebola drug has been depleted.
[02:10:09.056 --> 02:10:10.576]  Troops are now arriving in the hot zone.
[02:10:10.576 --> 02:10:13.258]  Germany asked soldiers to volunteer to fight Ebola.
[02:10:13.258 --> 02:10:17.540]  CDC tells airlines to treat all bodily fluids as infectious.
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:19.721]  Sierra Leone lives since three-day lockdown.
[02:10:19.721 --> 02:10:22.462]  Food shortages, fear of poisoned soap.
[02:10:26.397 --> 02:10:35.481]  Burial teams trying to bury the Ebola corpses are being attacked.
[02:10:35.481 --> 02:10:38.243]  Some of the other breaking news on Infowars.com.
[02:10:38.243 --> 02:10:43.585]  Mysterious Georgia Guidestones get strange 2014 update.
[02:10:43.585 --> 02:10:47.747]  New block added to controversial American Stonehenge.
[02:10:47.747 --> 02:10:53.450]  In fact, if we have time, I'm going to air that Paul Watson report that just went up.
[02:10:54.508 --> 02:10:57.709]  at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:10:57.709 --> 02:11:03.052]  And some of the other news, missing Afghan soldiers caught trying to enter Canada.
[02:11:03.052 --> 02:11:06.173]  They already caught one group in Buffalo.
[02:11:06.173 --> 02:11:15.937]  Now the three Afghan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise off Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls.
[02:11:15.937 --> 02:11:18.018]  Sources said Monday.
[02:11:18.018 --> 02:11:21.520]  Who knows if any of that is true.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.741]  Now I wanted to get to this story especially
[02:11:25.151 --> 02:11:50.673]  That is one of the top stories in the featured news area of InfoWars.com, because the behavior of this so-called police officer is something that I've seen in police around the country, especially in and around Chicago and in some of the eastern areas, it tends to be the worst, where if you videotape police from 200 yards away, they flip out, run over, assault you, take you to jail.
[02:11:52.594 --> 02:12:00.341]  Or bare minimum scream at you and try to charge you with eavesdropping or wiretapping when clearly that's not what the statute says.
[02:12:00.341 --> 02:12:03.464]  You're in public, there's no perception of privacy.
[02:12:03.464 --> 02:12:05.666]  That's how they videotape us and the rest of it.
[02:12:05.666 --> 02:12:08.208]  It's just pure out-of-control intimidation.
[02:12:08.208 --> 02:12:10.771]  Well, we're the good guys, so we're allowed to dominate you.
[02:12:10.771 --> 02:12:14.774]  No, this is how people act in North Korea.
[02:12:14.774 --> 02:12:16.376]  And it really is how they act in North Korea.
[02:12:18.288 --> 02:12:25.391]  In North Korea, you're allowed to videotape and take photos in public unless they say it's an area they don't like, and then you get six months hard labor if you're a tourist.
[02:12:25.391 --> 02:12:28.792]  If you're a North Korean, you might get executed.
[02:12:28.792 --> 02:12:31.393]  But here's the headline, AP.
[02:12:31.393 --> 02:12:40.716]  Snipers, guards, fence is not enough, Secret Service moles, security checkpoints outside White House on the roads leading to it.
[02:12:42.625 --> 02:12:42.905]  The U.S.
[02:12:42.905 --> 02:12:51.051]  Secret Service is having preliminary discussions about setting up security screening checkpoints near public areas around the White House.
[02:12:51.051 --> 02:12:52.392]  We're talking miles away, folks.
[02:12:52.392 --> 02:12:58.056]  I have been 500 yards away with a video camera and had the Secret Service come over and say, stop filming the White House.
[02:12:58.056 --> 02:12:59.317]  And then I thought they were picking on me.
[02:12:59.317 --> 02:13:02.599]  They then went over and harassed a family with little kids with cameras.
[02:13:02.599 --> 02:13:04.400]  I mean, this is just total bull.
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.663]  As if they don't have Google Maps or Google Street or as if terrorists don't know where it's at.
[02:13:08.663 --> 02:13:09.464]  I mean, just give me a break.
[02:13:11.653 --> 02:13:30.143]  The official, not a public servant, the official said the measures have been discussed by the agency previously, but the talks have taken on added urgency following an incident Friday in which a man carrying a knife jumped over a gate around the White House and made it into a building entrance.
[02:13:30.143 --> 02:13:34.946]  The official insisted on anonymity, and then it goes on to talk about what they want to do.
[02:13:36.072 --> 02:13:45.896]  Well, we have 100 miles into the country, what the feds call a constitution-free zone since 9-11, that has nothing to do with 9-11, and they let the illegals drive right through it.
[02:13:45.896 --> 02:13:52.059]  But if you drive through in your RV or whatever, they're going to try to search it.
[02:13:52.059 --> 02:13:52.659]  Are you a U.S.
[02:13:52.659 --> 02:13:53.079]  citizen?
[02:13:53.079 --> 02:13:53.759]  Yeah, I'm a U.S.
[02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:54.360]  citizen.
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:55.200]  Pull right over there.
[02:13:56.633 --> 02:14:03.675]  And I pull over and just get out and I go, hey, I know you guys aren't allowed to do your job, but it's not your purview to be trying to look for drugs.
[02:14:03.675 --> 02:14:04.736]  And they're like, yes, it is.
[02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:07.917]  Well, I don't ship in what the big banks do.
[02:14:07.917 --> 02:14:09.177]  And so I'm very upset.
[02:14:09.177 --> 02:14:09.937]  You need to let me go.
[02:14:09.937 --> 02:14:11.718]  They're like, yeah, get out of here, Alex.
[02:14:11.718 --> 02:14:12.958]  Hey, we don't like doing it either.
[02:14:12.958 --> 02:14:19.841]  I mean, people have seen those videos, but the illustration here is this is
[02:14:20.936 --> 02:14:22.497]  Discriminatory.
[02:14:22.497 --> 02:14:26.320]  You can't have open borders and then 100 miles into the country, search people.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:31.204]  You can't have open borders and then pull up to an illegal, unconstitutional checkpoint.
[02:14:31.204 --> 02:14:33.506]  I mean, these are unconstitutional for a reason.
[02:14:33.506 --> 02:14:35.168]  Nazi Germany had them.
[02:14:35.168 --> 02:14:36.889]  Soviet Russia had them.
[02:14:36.889 --> 02:14:39.111]  I don't want to go to Mexico ever again.
[02:14:39.111 --> 02:14:44.635]  Even though I love areas of southern Mexico and Yucatan and the pyramids.
[02:14:44.635 --> 02:14:45.716]  It's very interesting.
[02:14:45.716 --> 02:14:47.698]  Because the checkpoints are so scary.
[02:14:49.777 --> 02:14:57.262]  And the Police and Military Act is so corrupt and strutting around enjoying the suppression of the peons.
[02:14:57.262 --> 02:14:58.423]  The poor people of Mexico.
[02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:00.144]  They call them peons.
[02:15:00.144 --> 02:15:02.226]  Or peasants.
[02:15:02.226 --> 02:15:03.807]  And I'm not acting like a peasant.
[02:15:03.807 --> 02:15:05.468]  I don't want to be a slave.
[02:15:05.468 --> 02:15:06.869]  I don't want to be overrun.
[02:15:06.869 --> 02:15:08.750]  I don't want to be dominated.
[02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:10.431]  I don't want to live in North Korea.
[02:15:10.431 --> 02:15:12.052]  I don't want to live in Guatemala.
[02:15:12.052 --> 02:15:15.795]  I don't want to live in Rhodesia.
[02:15:16.874 --> 02:15:22.617]  Or Zimbabwe, or whatever its name is, this week.
[02:15:22.617 --> 02:15:27.661]  How ridiculous that you don't want to live under that, to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda, who they publicly run.
[02:15:27.661 --> 02:15:31.223]  And I told you, now the U.S.
[02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:34.985]  Ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice, came out, we played the clip first hour.
[02:15:34.985 --> 02:15:36.646]  She said, yeah, this is about tabling Assad.
[02:15:36.646 --> 02:15:38.087]  We're giving them weapons to do that.
[02:15:38.087 --> 02:15:39.288]  They're giving them to Al-Qaeda, folks.
[02:15:39.288 --> 02:15:40.128]  They run them.
[02:15:40.128 --> 02:15:44.811]  They'll do a fake Samantha Powers.
[02:15:44.811 --> 02:15:45.751]  Teleprompter-free, folks.
[02:15:45.751 --> 02:15:46.592]  I get names scrambled.
[02:15:48.609 --> 02:15:51.490]  Why did I say Susan Powers?
[02:15:51.490 --> 02:15:56.253]  Susan... Yeah, they're both State Department, I know, I get them all conflated.
[02:15:56.253 --> 02:16:01.355]  They're all a bunch of wild-eyed looking women, I know that.
[02:16:01.355 --> 02:16:10.240]  Now, all of this is going on, and then you see this video, and I want to reach out to the police, but they've been federalized, and they've been trained.
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:17.143]  Every single American, especially some of these state police groups, is a cadet coming up
[02:16:18.444 --> 02:16:23.008]  to get issued their uniform at boot camp, and I'm sorry.
[02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:41.103]  The government is illegitimate, it's out of control, it's a joke, it's a fraud, and it's not doing all this to protect us, and you are being told to act like this, to create a culture of oppression, so the people are scared of the police, so that it can be an us-against-them mentality, and I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[02:16:41.103 --> 02:16:42.905]  I'm tired of it.
[02:16:42.905 --> 02:16:44.847]  Illinois cop loses it as
[02:16:46.351 --> 02:16:51.492]  A driver attempts to exercise rights at unconstitutional checkpoint.
[02:16:51.492 --> 02:16:55.773]  Lockout officer rips open car door and yells like drill sergeant.
[02:16:55.773 --> 02:17:06.335]  An enraged police officer in Illinois was caught on camera during an exchange Friday with a driver who attempted to exercise his constitutional rights at a random police checkpoint.
[02:17:06.335 --> 02:17:09.556]  Making it compelling yet disturbing viewing.
[02:17:09.556 --> 02:17:12.317]  Ryan Scott set a camera on his
[02:17:13.399 --> 02:17:19.864]  Car to record as he was ushered into the checkpoint, believing that his rights were about to be trampled on.
[02:17:19.864 --> 02:17:25.129]  The resulting footage shows what happened when Scott asked police whether he was being detained or not.
[02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:30.473]  Scott writes, I was just stopped at an unconstitutional checkpoint in DeKalb, Illinois.
[02:17:30.473 --> 02:17:34.256]  This was Illinois State Police conducting the unconstitutional searches.
[02:17:34.256 --> 02:17:36.538]  You won't believe how what just went down.
[02:17:36.538 --> 02:17:39.260]  The action begins at three minutes, 30 seconds in.
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:42.302]  And that's where we take you into the video.
[02:17:42.302 --> 02:17:42.743]  Here it is.
[02:17:45.421 --> 02:17:46.842]  I'll look into the check.
[02:17:46.842 --> 02:17:48.943]  Evening, officer.
[02:17:48.943 --> 02:17:53.065]  Before we continue, I'd just like to let you know that you are being recorded right now.
[02:17:53.065 --> 02:17:54.325]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:17:54.325 --> 02:17:56.347]  I would just like to know why I'm being pulled over.
[02:17:56.347 --> 02:17:58.207]  We're doing a roadside safety check.
[02:17:58.207 --> 02:17:58.648]  Okay.
[02:17:58.648 --> 02:17:59.528]  For your safety.
[02:17:59.528 --> 02:18:01.029]  Am I being detained?
[02:18:01.029 --> 02:18:01.469]  What's that?
[02:18:01.469 --> 02:18:02.830]  Am I being detained?
[02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:06.272]  Well, right now, we're just conducting our job, making sure everyone's on the road, driving safely.
[02:18:06.272 --> 02:18:06.632]  Our job?
[02:18:06.632 --> 02:18:08.673]  Yes, you are not free to leave right now.
[02:18:08.673 --> 02:18:11.574]  So far, everybody's being safe.
[02:18:11.574 --> 02:18:12.975]  Am I being detained, then?
[02:18:12.975 --> 02:18:14.095]  You're not free to leave.
[02:18:14.095 --> 02:18:14.796]  Am I being detained?
[02:18:15.603 --> 02:18:20.307]  If I'm not free to leave, and you're suspecting me of committing a crime, then am I being detained?
[02:18:20.307 --> 02:18:21.989]  We're making sure that everybody's driving safely.
[02:18:21.989 --> 02:18:23.190]  Oh, I understand.
[02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:25.152]  Thank you for explaining to me, sir.
[02:18:25.152 --> 02:18:25.692]  Absolutely.
[02:18:25.692 --> 02:18:27.253]  It's prior restraint.
[02:18:27.253 --> 02:18:29.195]  We do have the legal right to stop you right now.
[02:18:29.195 --> 02:18:31.617]  Oh, I believe this is unconstitutional, but...
[02:18:32.850 --> 02:18:35.232]  Now, like I said, I've asked you for your driver's license approval.
[02:18:35.232 --> 02:18:40.356]  You actually didn't ask me for my driver's license, but I'm actually not obligated to provide that if I'm not being detained.
[02:18:40.356 --> 02:18:40.516]  Woah!
[02:18:40.516 --> 02:18:40.676]  Woah!
[02:18:40.676 --> 02:18:40.796]  Woah!
[02:18:40.796 --> 02:18:40.896]  Woah!
[02:18:40.896 --> 02:18:41.016]  Woah!
[02:18:41.016 --> 02:18:41.136]  Woah!
[02:18:41.136 --> 02:18:41.236]  Woah!
[02:18:41.236 --> 02:18:41.336]  Woah!
[02:18:41.336 --> 02:18:41.557]  Woah!
[02:18:41.557 --> 02:18:41.677]  Woah!
[02:18:41.677 --> 02:18:41.817]  Woah!
[02:18:41.817 --> 02:18:41.977]  Woah!
[02:18:41.977 --> 02:18:42.077]  Woah!

[02:18:53.506 --> 02:18:53.626]  Woah!
[02:18:53.626 --> 02:18:53.746]  Woah!
[02:18:53.746 --> 02:18:53.906]  Woah!
[02:18:53.906 --> 02:18:54.046]  Woah!
[02:18:54.046 --> 02:18:54.146]  Woah!
[02:18:54.146 --> 02:18:54.266]  Woah!
[02:18:54.266 --> 02:18:54.486]  Woah!
[02:18:54.486 --> 02:18:54.686]  Woah!
[02:18:55.547 --> 02:18:57.711]  And insurance!
[02:18:57.711 --> 02:18:58.752]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:18:58.752 --> 02:19:00.054]  This is my license here.
[02:19:00.054 --> 02:19:01.276]  Okay, now get your insurance!
[02:19:01.276 --> 02:19:02.718]  That's required by law!
[02:19:02.718 --> 02:19:03.079]  Alright.
[02:19:03.959 --> 02:19:05.640]  Driving to privilege, not a right.
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:06.400]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.601]  And owning guns is a privilege.
[02:19:07.601 --> 02:19:09.221]  I'm not going to sit in a debate with you.
[02:19:09.221 --> 02:19:11.082]  And keeping your bank accounts a privilege, huh?
[02:19:11.082 --> 02:19:11.563]  No, you know what?
[02:19:11.563 --> 02:19:14.544]  This is not unconstitutional.
[02:19:14.544 --> 02:19:15.464]  I already explained it to you.
[02:19:15.464 --> 02:19:17.005]  Driving to privilege is not a right.
[02:19:17.005 --> 02:19:17.405]  Understood.
[02:19:17.405 --> 02:19:18.866]  This is my driving license.
[02:19:18.866 --> 02:19:19.446]  Thank you.
[02:19:19.446 --> 02:19:20.987]  Driving commercially is a privilege.
[02:19:20.987 --> 02:19:21.967]  You drive in Illinois.
[02:19:21.967 --> 02:19:23.008]  Do you understand that?
[02:19:23.008 --> 02:19:23.428]  Absolutely.
[02:19:23.428 --> 02:19:24.228]  Do you understand that?
[02:19:24.228 --> 02:19:26.789]  I would also like to inform you that you are being recorded right now.
[02:19:26.789 --> 02:19:27.350]  Good.
[02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:27.550]  Okay.
[02:19:29.192 --> 02:19:31.361]  Can I please shut my door?
[02:19:31.361 --> 02:19:32.686]  Since I'm not being detained.
[02:19:32.686 --> 02:19:34.353]  What am I being detained for exactly, sir?
[02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:37.792]  Uh, if I am being detained... Then call us, sir, because we're scum!
[02:19:37.792 --> 02:19:40.774]  ...require to have when you drive in the state of Illinois.
[02:19:40.774 --> 02:19:41.615]  Understood.
[02:19:41.615 --> 02:19:42.636]  I guarantee you that, cop.
[02:19:42.636 --> 02:19:43.677]  And I do... And I do have that, sir.
[02:19:43.677 --> 02:19:44.618]  You just get all the vaccines.
[02:19:44.618 --> 02:19:45.278]  You're just stupid.
[02:19:45.278 --> 02:19:46.019]  I don't know.
[02:19:46.019 --> 02:19:46.780]  I'm looking at it.
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:49.422]  You refuse to... You'll find out when the whole country falls.
[02:19:49.422 --> 02:19:50.063]  I absolutely not.
[02:19:50.063 --> 02:19:51.023]  I did not refuse anything.
[02:19:51.023 --> 02:19:52.525]  Is this your current address?
[02:19:52.525 --> 02:19:54.046]  I would not like to answer any... Is this your current address?
[02:19:54.046 --> 02:19:57.069]  I'd like to remain silent, sir, unless I have an attorney present.
[02:19:57.069 --> 02:19:58.210]  Is this your current address?
[02:19:58.210 --> 02:19:59.711]  I would like to remain silent, sir.
[02:19:59.711 --> 02:20:01.453]  I would like to exercise my Fifth Amendment right.
[02:20:01.653 --> 02:20:03.133]  Do you have a more current insurance card?
[02:20:03.133 --> 02:20:05.214]  I would like to exercise my 5th Amendment right.
[02:20:05.214 --> 02:20:07.955]  Everything there isn't completely valid and legal.
[02:20:07.955 --> 02:20:09.716]  And I'd like to exercise my 5th Amendment right.
[02:20:09.716 --> 02:20:10.656]  Such a freak country.
[02:20:10.656 --> 02:20:11.756]  I'm sorry, what was that?
[02:20:11.756 --> 02:20:13.357]  I would like to exercise my 5th Amendment right.
[02:20:13.357 --> 02:20:15.297]  Now the White House is like a North Korean command base.
[02:20:15.297 --> 02:20:17.018]  Yeah, I have the right to remain silent.
[02:20:17.018 --> 02:20:17.518]  Really?
[02:20:17.518 --> 02:20:17.998]  Absolutely.
[02:20:17.998 --> 02:20:18.518]  Are you sure?
[02:20:18.518 --> 02:20:21.439]  Yes, sir.
[02:20:21.439 --> 02:20:22.700]  Slams his car door.
[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:23.460]  Thank you.
[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:25.180]  You're free to leave.
[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:26.141]  Yes, ma'am, you are.
[02:20:26.141 --> 02:20:27.061]  You guys have a great night.
[02:20:30.697 --> 02:20:34.019]  And again, the argument is they're trying to stop criminals.
[02:20:34.019 --> 02:20:45.526]  I bet you a million dollars, literally, because I know that they let illegals drive through there with no IDs, nothing.
[02:20:45.526 --> 02:20:49.588]  Just like we told you for years, we saw illegals flying with no ID.
[02:20:49.588 --> 02:20:56.192]  And now it's confirmed on video, mainstream news.
[02:20:56.192 --> 02:20:57.013]  That's discriminatory.
[02:21:00.083 --> 02:21:03.806]  We are seen as milk cows and we've got to be kept in line.
[02:21:03.806 --> 02:21:08.230]  The big banks openly ship in the narcotics and launder the money.
[02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:14.174]  The government openly is run by foreign banks and what these cops don't get is the country already got robbed.
[02:21:14.174 --> 02:21:16.256]  It already got destroyed.
[02:21:16.256 --> 02:21:17.277]  And there's a reason.
[02:21:20.796 --> 02:21:25.859]  That if they would have pulled over George Washington like that, it wouldn't have gone as nice.
[02:21:25.859 --> 02:21:36.104]  And they would call him a terrorist, I guess, because he knew that a free person didn't come up to a checkpoint and have to show a bunch of papers, because that's what authoritarian countries were like.
[02:21:36.104 --> 02:21:46.070]  In England, they couldn't demand that of the people in 1776, but they were doing it here in the colonies, having checkpoints and demanding to see paper.
[02:21:47.072 --> 02:21:53.915]  I shot a video when I went to the city-wide garage sale about three weeks ago, and it's actually on my iPhone.
[02:21:53.915 --> 02:21:57.517]  I need to give it to the guys and put it on the nightly news.
[02:21:57.517 --> 02:22:06.261]  And as soon as I saw it, the guy was from Louisiana, and he had a lot of black folk art that he collected.
[02:22:06.261 --> 02:22:08.302]  And it was the hand-carved dolls.
[02:22:08.302 --> 02:22:11.704]  Some of it was pre-Civil War, most of it after Civil War.
[02:22:11.704 --> 02:22:15.606]  And it was the little metal circular silver or pewter chits.
[02:22:16.650 --> 02:22:21.353]  That would say the name and who owned the slave.
[02:22:21.353 --> 02:22:22.474]  And that was only on display.
[02:22:22.474 --> 02:22:25.035]  He wouldn't sell me that, but I knew immediately.
[02:22:25.035 --> 02:22:26.876]  I said, that's a slave ID.
[02:22:26.876 --> 02:22:29.318]  And he said, yeah, most people don't know that.
[02:22:29.318 --> 02:22:31.099]  I said, no, I've read about these in books.
[02:22:31.099 --> 02:22:31.819]  I said, can I buy that?
[02:22:31.819 --> 02:22:33.840]  And he goes, no, that's just for display.
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:44.367]  I just, I just, you know, I, I bought it from a, uh, little community, uh, black, uh, history museum and a community center that was closing about 20 years ago.
[02:22:45.717 --> 02:22:48.919]  And he just said, I just can't part with that and a few of these other things.
[02:22:48.919 --> 02:22:51.560]  And it turned out his son came over, he was a listener.
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:54.942]  I don't know why I digress off into that.
[02:22:54.942 --> 02:23:04.367]  But hey, listen, wear your ID around your neck, because they'd have a little cord and a little metal thing, and they'd come up to black people and say, where you been?
[02:23:04.367 --> 02:23:05.607]  Where you going?
[02:23:05.607 --> 02:23:06.488]  Where do you live?
[02:23:06.488 --> 02:23:12.191]  And even if you weren't a slave, after slavery, you still had to have those little metal chits
[02:23:13.953 --> 02:23:18.075]  To say what plantation you worked on or where you were, or where you were a sharecropper.
[02:23:18.075 --> 02:23:19.416]  And I'll go further.
[02:23:19.416 --> 02:23:29.582]  In many areas of the South, if you were a sharecropper, you would get basically beat up or arrested if you didn't carry one of the chits as well.
[02:23:29.582 --> 02:23:31.223]  And so, we need to do a report on that.
[02:23:31.223 --> 02:23:36.186]  We need to get one of the reporters, probably be fitting to get Jakari to look into it,
[02:23:37.785 --> 02:23:42.809]  Obviously, even more interest for him with such a tragic thing happening to his people.
[02:23:42.809 --> 02:23:47.591]  But all of us are the same people going under the same system.
[02:23:47.591 --> 02:23:49.433]  And I meant to do a report on that.
[02:23:49.433 --> 02:23:52.354]  I just took some photos and shot some quick video.
[02:23:52.354 --> 02:24:03.001]  And maybe Jakari can go do some research on it and go to some of these museums and connect it to how we're all becoming slaves here.
[02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:04.582]  And it's very offensive.
[02:24:05.455 --> 02:24:16.404]  That that cop just explosively rips that door open, explosively sticks that flashlight in right in the guy's face, clearly with body language saying, I will club your head in.
[02:24:16.404 --> 02:24:22.829]  How dare you mention the Constitution a dirty word to me?
[02:24:22.829 --> 02:24:26.913]  When all we're doing is out here doing a safety check under a federal grant.
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:36.982]  And again, the state police are all up there in rock ready, drill sergeant hats, and look, yeah, we're the big bad guys!
[02:24:36.982 --> 02:24:38.943]  We're out here keeping everybody safe!
[02:24:38.943 --> 02:24:41.583]  Yeah, yeah, you're keeping everybody safe.
[02:24:41.583 --> 02:24:50.046]  You may be out there actually stopping bad guys and stuff, but you're also out there revenue generating, and the bad guys now run the country.
[02:24:50.046 --> 02:24:55.988]  It's like the footage of the state police that made national attention three or four years ago out of Oklahoma.
[02:24:55.988 --> 02:24:57.288]  It happened a couple times in Oklahoma.
[02:24:58.263 --> 02:25:08.105]  Where you'd have an ambulance on a two-lane road, and the cops would come flying up behind him saying, get out of the way.
[02:25:08.105 --> 02:25:16.567]  And the ambulance can't get out of the way, so they pull the ambulance over, and the ambulance driver gets out nicely, says, what's going on?
[02:25:16.567 --> 02:25:18.808]  He says, get back in the car.
[02:25:18.808 --> 02:25:21.109]  Goes in and starts screaming at the other people in the back.
[02:25:21.109 --> 02:25:23.849]  There's a lady having a heart attack in the back.
[02:25:23.849 --> 02:25:26.590]  And the passenger gets out the EMT and goes, what are you doing, man?
[02:25:27.657 --> 02:25:31.899]  And the cops start choking him!
[02:25:31.899 --> 02:25:33.440]  And the guy sits there and takes it!
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:37.202]  And they start threatening to charge him with assault while they're choking him!
[02:25:37.202 --> 02:25:38.282]  I mean, it's crazy!
[02:25:38.282 --> 02:25:41.464]  It was like Oklahoma where they called the police.
[02:25:41.464 --> 02:25:42.404]  I'm not bashing Oklahoma.
[02:25:42.404 --> 02:25:42.944]  I love Oklahoma.
[02:25:42.944 --> 02:25:44.545]  It's basically like Texas.
[02:25:44.545 --> 02:25:47.486]  You could say Texas is an extension of Oklahoma.
[02:25:47.486 --> 02:25:50.548]  Oklahoma used to be part of Texas.
[02:25:50.548 --> 02:25:56.351]  But I saw another article out of Oklahoma last year where a three-year-old was peeing in the front yard on a bush.
[02:25:57.372 --> 02:26:02.936]  And they called the police and the cop came and threatened to arrest the dad and gave him a ticket and that cop got fired.
[02:26:02.936 --> 02:26:03.677]  And that's a good thing.
[02:26:03.677 --> 02:26:08.240]  I mean, come on, a three-year-old peeing on a bush, man, that's not, don't call the police.
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:09.661]  And it's not just the cop.
[02:26:09.661 --> 02:26:14.505]  What's wrong with the neighbor?
[02:26:14.505 --> 02:26:16.907]  I have been videotaping police a hundred yards away.
[02:26:19.028 --> 02:26:38.919]  I was across the street from the, on a Sunday, nobody was there, from the Supreme Court, getting cutaway footage while I was there, and this federal police officer, he was a cop, on a security guard, runs over, super angry, and says, what are you doing, filming?
[02:26:38.919 --> 02:26:44.862]  I'm on a sidewalk, and I go, making a documentary, I need some cutaways, Supreme Court's a landmark.
[02:26:44.862 --> 02:26:45.843]  You can't film here.
[02:26:47.432 --> 02:26:51.654]  I was getting really angry and I had a psychological test.
[02:26:51.654 --> 02:26:55.115]  I just said, oh yes sir, I'm so sorry, you're so right.
[02:26:55.115 --> 02:26:56.296]  Oh, I need a permit.
[02:26:56.296 --> 02:26:57.556]  They don't give them in D.C.
[02:26:57.556 --> 02:26:59.257]  It's all a lie.
[02:26:59.257 --> 02:27:01.838]  I know all about it because I shot three documentaries there by then.
[02:27:01.838 --> 02:27:07.881]  And I went, can I please go up on the steps and get shots and will you show me around?
[02:27:07.881 --> 02:27:10.922]  And he said, of course you can.
[02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:16.885]  I mean, he was like Forrest Gump or something with a lobotomy and just wanted me to kiss his butt.
[02:27:19.346 --> 02:27:27.092]  Well, if you want to get a badge and a gun so you can lord over people, you are not the type of people we need in a uniform.
[02:27:27.092 --> 02:27:32.917]  I mean, I know most police are ashamed of this type of behavior, but I'm getting ready to throw up at this point.
[02:27:34.594 --> 02:27:39.837]  Steve in California, Chris in California, Eric in Florida, Wildman in Texas.
[02:27:39.837 --> 02:27:41.799]  I thought that was me.
[02:27:41.799 --> 02:27:44.220]  Ryan and others, we'll get to your calls after the guest is on with us.
[02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:47.703]  They're on with us for one segment, maybe two, but I'll do overdrive if need be.
[02:27:47.703 --> 02:27:48.763]  I will get to you.
[02:27:48.763 --> 02:27:52.586]  I need to briefly here do some mid-air refueling.
[02:27:52.586 --> 02:27:56.989]  We fund ourselves selling Molon Labe both in English and in Greek.
[02:27:57.569 --> 02:27:59.170]  Shirts that say come and take it.
[02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:05.455]  You'll meet like-minded people, you'll promote the Second Amendment, and you'll fund the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[02:28:05.455 --> 02:28:10.279]  We have some more Liberty-based, Made in America brass belt buckles back in.
[02:28:10.279 --> 02:28:14.683]  We have the new Molon Labe t-shirt with the American flag that's my favorite.
[02:28:14.683 --> 02:28:18.726]  We have the new Molon Labe hats and beanies since winter's coming.
[02:28:18.726 --> 02:28:24.311]  We have a lot of new products at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, or MadeIn1776.com.
[02:28:26.312 --> 02:28:31.195]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella big shopping center, shopping cart.
[02:28:31.195 --> 02:28:36.878]  But then you've got Madein1776.com takes you right to the Made in America apparel and products.
[02:28:36.878 --> 02:28:47.023]  You've got the Infowarslife.com that takes you right into the proprietary supplements that we have, super male vitality, super female vitality.
[02:28:47.023 --> 02:28:50.565]  I'll tell you, that state police cop did not need any super male vitality.
[02:28:52.705 --> 02:28:53.505]  But I'm digressing.
[02:28:53.505 --> 02:28:54.746]  That's another thing.
[02:28:54.746 --> 02:29:00.968]  The energy that these guys put out is male energy that's meant to fight a really bad guy.
[02:29:00.968 --> 02:29:03.529]  But see, it's now militarized and focused on us.
[02:29:03.529 --> 02:29:05.449]  It's just, it's pure tyranny.
[02:29:05.449 --> 02:29:06.129]  It's the plague.
[02:29:06.129 --> 02:29:06.910]  It's the end of the country.
[02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:07.270]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:08.254 --> 02:29:15.742]  We've got Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 that has just cleaned out my blood, my body, given me so much more clarity, energy, and focus.

[02:29:45.730 --> 02:29:49.394]  We've got a very special guest on Cell Phone Radiation Danger First coming up.
[02:29:50.438 --> 02:29:54.382]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.382 --> 02:30:01.508]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.508 --> 02:30:11.157]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:30:11.157 --> 02:30:17.022]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life,
[02:30:17.142 --> 02:30:21.064]  Oxy powder was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:30:21.064 --> 02:30:31.449]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:30:31.449 --> 02:30:36.112]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:30:36.112 --> 02:30:38.353]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:30:38.533 --> 02:30:41.095]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:30:41.095 --> 02:30:46.778]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:30:46.778 --> 02:30:52.102]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[02:30:52.102 --> 02:30:57.606]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[02:30:57.606 --> 02:30:58.546]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:30:58.546 --> 02:31:05.531]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:31:05.871 --> 02:31:10.635]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:31:10.635 --> 02:31:11.956]  Talk about the effects.
[02:31:11.956 --> 02:31:13.477]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:31:13.477 --> 02:31:15.399]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:16.520]  I feel like I look better.
[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:17.221]  I feel better.
[02:31:17.221 --> 02:31:18.281]  I feel sexier.
[02:31:18.281 --> 02:31:19.242]  I love it.
[02:31:19.242 --> 02:31:22.225]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:31:22.225 --> 02:31:25.167]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:31:25.167 --> 02:31:26.248]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:31:26.248 --> 02:31:27.429]  Consult your physician.
[02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:29.811]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:31:29.811 --> 02:31:30.732]  This is life changing.
[02:31:31.232 --> 02:31:34.874]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:34.874 --> 02:31:39.156]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:39.156 --> 02:31:40.957]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:40.957 --> 02:31:48.801]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:48.801 --> 02:31:49.942]  But for how long?
[02:31:49.942 --> 02:31:52.163]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[02:31:52.163 --> 02:31:56.585]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[02:31:56.585 --> 02:31:58.466]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:31:58.466 --> 02:31:59.407]  Just won't quit.
[02:32:00.779 --> 02:32:04.543]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[02:32:04.543 --> 02:32:07.946]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:07.946 --> 02:32:10.308]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:10.308 --> 02:32:15.574]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:15.574 --> 02:32:20.759]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:20.759 --> 02:32:23.782]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:24.062 --> 02:32:28.124]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:28.124 --> 02:32:32.466]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:32.466 --> 02:32:42.692]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:42.692 --> 02:32:45.213]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:45.393 --> 02:32:53.597]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:32:53.597 --> 02:32:57.559]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:10.879 --> 02:33:17.266]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:17.266 --> 02:33:19.108]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:40.992 --> 02:33:49.857]  I'm not an engineer.
[02:33:49.857 --> 02:33:54.319]  But... I've interviewed a lot of engineers.
[02:33:54.319 --> 02:33:55.680]  I've interviewed medical doctors.
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:59.903]  I've read the UN's own reports in my 20 years on air.
[02:33:59.903 --> 02:34:05.186]  I've just seen countless mainstream news articles admitting that cell phones have a link to brain cancer.
[02:34:06.383 --> 02:34:17.610]  And that cell phone microwave radiation vibrates the DNA and basically breaks it into pieces, then causing mutations that causes cancer.
[02:34:17.610 --> 02:34:22.774]  But I saw an article last week when it was linked on DrugsReport.com.
[02:34:22.774 --> 02:34:24.755]  Are cell phones really giving us cancer?
[02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:27.617]  CBS News.
[02:34:27.617 --> 02:34:29.378]  And I saw the expert there.
[02:34:31.513 --> 02:34:44.782]  Dr. Debra Lee Davis, PhD, MPH, founder and president of Environmental Health Trust, and she's got a prestigious background advising Congress, the UN, you name it, presidential administrations.
[02:34:44.782 --> 02:34:46.704]  Selected by Time Magazine as a top pick.
[02:34:47.484 --> 02:34:52.326]  For her book, Receive a Silver Medal from Nautilus Books, Investigative Journalism.
[02:34:52.326 --> 02:35:05.870]  I thought, wow, this is a great person to get on to give us her expert take on cell phones because she's basically quoted here out of the CBS news piece saying, turn it off when you're not using it.
[02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:14.213]  I know this, I try to use a wire because I've seen in the studies that not a lot of the radiation travels up that, that for every
[02:35:15.595 --> 02:35:15.855]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:31.741 --> 02:35:32.021]  And that's
[02:35:52.952 --> 02:36:05.958]  And just like cigarettes, when they had doctors in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, and 50s saying, I'd walk a mile for a camel, and, oh, cigarettes are good for your lungs, they knew full well, by the 50s, it was killing people.
[02:36:05.958 --> 02:36:07.658]  They knew earlier than that.
[02:36:07.658 --> 02:36:10.800]  So it was a conspiracy theory back then to say smoking was bad.
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:12.500]  It's now known.
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:18.403]  So I want to get her expert take on this, because even though I know this, I get on the cell phone too much.
[02:36:18.403 --> 02:36:20.184]  Even though I know this, I lose my
[02:36:21.089 --> 02:36:25.690]  You know, hands-free wire, and I end up putting it up against my head.
[02:36:25.690 --> 02:36:39.973]  I go to the mall or the supermarket, the grocery store, and I see so many little children, six, seven, eight years old, with cell phones glued to the sides of their heads, and I want to just warn their parents.
[02:36:39.973 --> 02:36:47.015]  But then, even in my own family, I can't get my family to stop putting them up against their heads.
[02:36:47.015 --> 02:36:48.835]  And then we see so many people like,
[02:36:50.162 --> 02:36:53.383]  Well, Senator Kennedy and others, they thought that was linked to a cell phone.
[02:36:53.383 --> 02:37:05.547]  I've talked to so many medical doctors, brain surgeons, who say they're seeing epidemics of tumors right up against the side of the head where people are using their cell phones.
[02:37:05.547 --> 02:37:11.069]  So, Dr. Davis, thank you so much for coming on the broadcast with us today.
[02:37:11.069 --> 02:37:12.549]  Well, thank you very much for having me.
[02:37:12.549 --> 02:37:14.990]  I appreciate your interest.
[02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.970]  Well, you've got the floor.
[02:37:15.970 --> 02:37:17.171]  What's going on with cell phones?
[02:37:17.827 --> 02:37:23.431]  Well, first of all, as you indicated, most people don't realize that they're two-way microwave radios.
[02:37:23.431 --> 02:37:26.614]  And if they understood that, it would make them think very differently about it.
[02:37:26.614 --> 02:37:32.558]  But the term that we use to describe the radiation from a cell phone is microwave radiation.
[02:37:32.558 --> 02:37:37.022]  Well, it really, industry calls it radio frequency energy.
[02:37:37.022 --> 02:37:39.664]  Radio frequency energy sounds like something very nice.
[02:37:39.664 --> 02:37:41.325]  After all, radios make music.
[02:37:41.325 --> 02:37:42.806]  We all need extra energy.
[02:37:42.806 --> 02:37:44.087]  But it's not energy.
[02:37:44.087 --> 02:37:44.848]  It's radiation.
[02:37:45.268 --> 02:37:50.271]  Now, television towers send radiation out to your television, which receives it.
[02:37:50.271 --> 02:37:57.977]  But a cell phone works by sending and receiving microwave radiation 900 times a minute.
[02:37:57.977 --> 02:38:00.418]  That's every 900 milliseconds.
[02:38:00.418 --> 02:38:11.566]  Whether you're talking or not, so long as that phone is on, if it's in your pocket, if it's in your bra, if it's next to your head, it's sending or receiving a microwave signal every 900 milliseconds.
[02:38:11.566 --> 02:38:15.028]  And because of that, it has the ability, as you indicated before,
[02:38:15.428 --> 02:38:22.972]  To disturb our DNA, to weaken our membranes, and to cause things that are in our body to be more deeply absorbed.
[02:38:22.972 --> 02:38:36.279]  It's interesting, but if people don't believe this is a problem, they should go to our website, environmentalhealthtrust.org, and click on or search for cell phone survivors and non-survivors.
[02:38:36.279 --> 02:38:44.684]  There we have videos from people who have suffered the real consequences of using phones in ways that have caused themselves, unfortunately, to have
[02:38:45.285 --> 02:38:50.177]  And I think they're very moving stories that people need to hear more about.
[02:38:51.411 --> 02:38:54.694]  Your site has a lot of links to mainline studies.
[02:38:54.694 --> 02:38:58.698]  Can we go back to the beginning, cell phones, the last 30 years?
[02:38:58.698 --> 02:39:15.294]  Because I've talked to former Air Force Army people who would talk about setting up microwave relay towers in the desert and things to communicate and how it would end up giving everybody in the team cancer 10 years later, 20 years later, or how they would put food in front of it and heat it up.
[02:39:15.754 --> 02:39:17.896]  You know, heat up their beans with it.
[02:39:17.896 --> 02:39:28.645]  Well, cell phones are just doing that on a smaller scale, but cumulatively, I mean, we know, it's in the studies, that it's literally breaking up the DNA, disturbing the cells.
[02:39:28.645 --> 02:39:31.287]  It's been in the Time Magazine, it's been in the Washington Post.
[02:39:31.287 --> 02:39:36.892]  What's crazy is this isn't really even denied, except industry tries to whitewash it.
[02:39:36.892 --> 02:39:38.113]  So where is it all going?
[02:39:38.905 --> 02:39:40.226]  Well, let's stop for a second.
[02:39:40.226 --> 02:39:43.449]  I think you're absolutely right about, by the way, the old studies from the military.
[02:39:43.449 --> 02:39:51.577]  I've talked to guys who used microwave radiation to warm themselves on the deck of an aircraft carrier before they realized that it might be damaging.
[02:39:51.577 --> 02:40:01.045]  And that's how they discovered we could make microwave ovens, by the way, is somebody was standing in front of the radar tower and the chocolate in their pocket melted.
[02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:11.192]  So the first microwave ovens, in fact, were called Radar Ranges because the guys who invented them thought it would be really cool to cook with radar.
[02:40:11.192 --> 02:40:14.733]  Well, it turned out not to be such a cool idea for women, so they renamed it Microwave.
[02:40:14.733 --> 02:40:20.435]  It sounded more dainty and more easy to sell to women, which it turned out to be.
[02:40:20.435 --> 02:40:22.656]  Where we are with the issue is the following.
[02:40:23.956 --> 02:40:30.539]  Microwave ovens cook food and they use a thousand watts of power, but the same frequency as a cell phone.
[02:40:30.539 --> 02:40:32.700]  So you've got power and you've got frequency.
[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:35.521]  A cell phone is far too weak to cook anything.
[02:40:35.521 --> 02:40:39.983]  It has less than one watt of power, but it does have the same frequency as a microwave oven.
[02:40:40.623 --> 02:40:47.145]  And right away there we tend to lose people because it's not the power that's most important for cell phone radiation.
[02:40:47.145 --> 02:40:50.626]  It's the nature of the signal that is sent.
[02:40:50.626 --> 02:40:54.688]  And the signal is not a steady, continuous wave.
[02:40:58.777 --> 02:40:59.578]  It's irregular.
[02:40:59.578 --> 02:41:04.401]  Which is meant to make all the different little particles bounce around, correct?
[02:41:04.401 --> 02:41:05.142]  Exactly.
[02:41:05.142 --> 02:41:06.422]  And it works.
[02:41:06.422 --> 02:41:09.685]  It works very effectively for many purposes.
[02:41:09.685 --> 02:41:19.312]  But what it does, it sends information, it receives information, but the signal itself changes its power density in a four second phone call.
[02:41:19.912 --> 02:41:20.692]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:38.678 --> 02:41:49.881]  And cell phone radiation distracts that normal balance, that normal homeostasis, and it can weaken membranes, whether of the eye or of the hearing nerve or of the brain.
[02:41:49.881 --> 02:41:53.702]  And those weakened membranes are then more vulnerable to damage.
[02:41:53.702 --> 02:42:03.445]  In fact, cell phone-like radiation is being used now in medicine to enhance the delivery of some drugs into the brain for chemotherapy.
[02:42:04.125 --> 02:42:12.330]  So there's even a new field called electrochemotherapy, which uses a different kind of electricity in order to deliver drugs into the body.
[02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:17.853]  So we know that a cell phone like radiation has biological effects.
[02:42:17.853 --> 02:42:27.498]  I think the problem we have is a disconnect, which is the title of my book, Disconnect, the truth about cell phone radiation, what industry has done to hide it and how to protect your family.
[02:42:28.118 --> 02:42:33.084]  And that book can be found, by the way, on Amazon or even as an e-book.
[02:42:33.084 --> 02:42:39.291]  If you buy the cover with the screen on it, then Environmental Health Trust, my non-profit, benefits from it more.
[02:42:39.291 --> 02:42:42.174]  Everyone should read this book, and I'm going to buy ten copies.
[02:42:43.155 --> 02:42:50.059]  Literally, and I'm going to give it to my family and say, let's stop putting the cell phones up to our heads.
[02:42:50.059 --> 02:42:52.601]  Or are you recommending just getting rid of them entirely?
[02:42:52.601 --> 02:42:53.882]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:42:53.882 --> 02:42:59.445]  I do not recommend getting rid of them because they have revolutionized our ability to respond to emergencies.
[02:42:59.445 --> 02:43:02.147]  They have improved our ability to do a lot of things.
[02:43:02.147 --> 02:43:03.868]  But we have a right to know.
[02:43:04.588 --> 02:43:08.311]  Fundamental right to know how to use them more safely.
[02:43:08.311 --> 02:43:16.878]  And by the way, I've recently spoken to people and the glacial US government is responding after 18 years.
[02:43:16.878 --> 02:43:24.224]  They have issued a formal request to ask whether they should change their 18 year old standards for cell phones.
[02:43:24.224 --> 02:43:25.505]  So they're looking at the data.
[02:43:26.025 --> 02:43:29.307]  Not very quickly, but they've started the process.
[02:43:29.307 --> 02:43:36.831]  In addition, if you go deep within your iPhone, you'll find advice now about how to use them safely.
[02:43:36.831 --> 02:43:40.493]  If you go to Settings on your iPhone, and then you go to General,
[02:43:41.574 --> 02:43:43.855]  And from General, you go to About.
[02:43:43.855 --> 02:43:49.896]  And then in About, you go all the way down to something most people would never see called Legal.
[02:43:49.896 --> 02:43:54.017]  You click on Legal, and it gives you RF exposure information.
[02:43:54.017 --> 02:44:01.179]  And there it says, buried in the phone, to reduce RF exposure, use a headset or a hands-free option.
[02:44:02.359 --> 02:44:11.351]  And also says, do not keep the phone closer than 10 millimeters to the body or you can exceed the as-tested exposure limits.
[02:44:12.563 --> 02:44:13.723]  Incredible.
[02:44:13.723 --> 02:44:19.006]  In fact, one of my crew a few months ago pointed that out, that not just on iPhones, but on most droids.
[02:44:19.006 --> 02:44:19.926]  Illegal.
[02:44:19.926 --> 02:44:24.848]  They're covering their butts now and quietly slipping it in.
[02:44:24.848 --> 02:44:31.030]  If you read through dozens of pages of stuff, that, oh, this is something people should be concerned about.
[02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:40.354]  What about some of the studies I've seen that some people appear to be more, almost allergic to frequency pollution.
[02:44:41.744 --> 02:44:44.285]  And so that's why it's worse for other people.
[02:44:44.285 --> 02:44:47.525]  Certainly there are some people who are much more sensitive to this.
[02:44:47.525 --> 02:44:56.847]  It's been very, very difficult to study because the studies have taken people a very small number, I should say, and looked for an immediate reaction.
[02:44:56.847 --> 02:44:58.788]  Some people don't have an immediate reaction.
[02:44:58.788 --> 02:45:03.469]  Their reaction occurs within a couple hours when they're finished with the quote study.
[02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:09.350]  There have been a few studies, one done by Andrew Marino, who's in Texas, where he's looked at a physician
[02:45:09.890 --> 02:45:24.916]  Who complained of this problem and was able to see changes in her brain and in subtle measures of her nervous system that could not be apparent to her that he could record when she was being exposed or not exposed.
[02:45:24.916 --> 02:45:33.139]  We think that there is a small percentage of people who are quite responsive and reactive to this, but everybody does react
[02:45:33.619 --> 02:45:34.320]  In some way.
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:35.582]  Some people are aware of it.
[02:45:35.582 --> 02:45:37.484]  Some people are not aware of it.
[02:45:37.484 --> 02:45:43.651]  And the problem has been that we have no serious research underway on this issue whatsoever.
[02:45:43.651 --> 02:45:49.198]  And that's why what we're calling for is a two cents a month campaign.
[02:45:49.198 --> 02:45:50.739]  Would you give two cents?
[02:45:50.739 --> 02:45:53.503]  Would you give two cents from the consumer, from the
[02:45:54.023 --> 02:46:07.238]  Manufacturer and from the provider to create a massive fund that would exist for eight years to train doctors and engineers in this field because it's a very obscure field in which very few people have training.
[02:46:07.238 --> 02:46:14.046]  I spent years working in toxicology and epidemiology and I knew very little about this issue when I first encountered it.
[02:46:14.827 --> 02:46:26.944]  When my first grandchild was born, and I became very interested in how bright he was, he still is, and how quickly he, at nine months of age, could crawl over, take a cell phone, turn it on, and play a game.
[02:46:28.007 --> 02:46:32.529]  And as I began to look into what was known about the developing brain, I became shocked.
[02:46:32.529 --> 02:46:34.450]  That's a whole other area.
[02:46:34.450 --> 02:46:41.134]  The studies are legion and even mainline medical doctors like yourself and others are saying, do not give kids these.
[02:46:41.134 --> 02:46:42.314]  They're wiring their brains.
[02:46:42.314 --> 02:46:43.835]  It's wiring them in a bad way.
[02:46:43.835 --> 02:46:48.118]  And then I go to the grocery store or I go to a restaurant.
[02:46:48.118 --> 02:46:50.739]  Nobody's kids are talking to mommy and daddy now.
[02:46:50.739 --> 02:46:52.920]  They are on these tablets.
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:54.201]  They are on these phones.
[02:46:55.142 --> 02:47:06.840]  And then you've got smart meters on the house radiating us, all the new appliances are hooked into it, and this is a totally unstudied area, as you were saying, and it's just ubiquitous now.
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:08.542]  We're being bathed.
[02:47:08.542 --> 02:47:09.484]  Google's launching...
[02:47:10.325 --> 02:47:14.307]  Blimps and drones that are going to bring in microwave communication everywhere?
[02:47:14.307 --> 02:47:27.214]  I mean, we're just... We're calling for something called the Baby Safe Project with the head of OBGYN at Yale University, Dr. Hugh Taylor, who is the chief of obstetrics and gynecology there.
[02:47:27.794 --> 02:47:30.798]  And a number of other prominent doctors, including Andrew Weil.
[02:47:30.798 --> 02:47:39.068]  And the Baby Safe Project basically says pregnant women should avoid direct exposure to the pregnant abdomen from cell phones and from tablets.
[02:47:39.068 --> 02:47:43.373]  Because we know that anything held directly on the body is going to get into the body.
[02:47:43.373 --> 02:47:44.595]  Let me tell you something about tablets.
[02:47:45.055 --> 02:47:51.058]  All of these tablets being used in all of these schools around this country are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:47:51.058 --> 02:47:57.422]  The tablet is tested to be used on a table 20 centimeters from an adult male body.
[02:47:57.422 --> 02:47:59.963]  They are not supposed to be held by young children.
[02:47:59.963 --> 02:48:01.904]  And what we tell people is disconnect
[02:48:02.444 --> 02:48:03.405]  From the Internet.
[02:48:03.405 --> 02:48:10.208]  If you must give a wireless device to a child, whether a phone or a tablet, make sure it's no longer on the Internet.
[02:48:10.208 --> 02:48:12.869]  Put it on airplane mode and recognize something.
[02:48:12.869 --> 02:48:28.056]  If you go to our website, EHtrust.org, you will find on that site clear information about digital dementia, which has occurred in Korean children so that the Korean psychiatrists are warning about this.
[02:48:28.056 --> 02:48:29.937]  It's a lack of development of the brain
[02:48:30.057 --> 02:48:36.137]  Oh yeah, I mean the government's trying to ban kids now on their screen time in Korea because it's literally turning them into zombies.
[02:48:36.974 --> 02:48:48.638]  I actually have a column on Huffington Post on e-zombies and I would really appreciate your linking to that information as well as on our website we've got stories about this that are very important for you to understand.
[02:48:48.638 --> 02:48:54.280]  You're not doing your child a favor if he learns to read at age three or four by glued to a screen.
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:55.881]  That's when children need to be held.
[02:48:55.881 --> 02:48:57.481]  That's when they need to be talked to.
[02:48:57.481 --> 02:49:02.263]  That's when they need to learn how to use their fine stubby fingers and coordinate their eyes and their hands.
[02:49:02.703 --> 02:49:12.846]  And if we raise a generation that's digitally sophisticated at these young ages, we are short-circuiting some of the brain development that neuropsychiatrists understand is quite critical.
[02:49:12.846 --> 02:49:21.709]  We are creating a generation that lacks the ability to have empathy, that lacks the ability to look you in the eye and anticipate the consequences of actions.
[02:49:21.709 --> 02:49:23.529]  Think about what that would mean.
[02:49:23.529 --> 02:49:26.090]  It's almost like artificial sociopaths.
[02:49:27.256 --> 02:49:35.284]  And that's what I'm seeing with people that have just the last 10 years been on iPhones and on tablets and things.
[02:49:35.284 --> 02:49:37.106]  People don't talk.
[02:49:37.106 --> 02:49:41.871]  We've all seen the film footage of people falling into fountains or walking in the streets.
[02:49:41.871 --> 02:49:46.475]  And it literally is creating a bunch of unconnected type people.
[02:49:46.475 --> 02:49:50.760]  And then you were mentioning, Doctor, some of the studies out there of what screen time is doing to little kids.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:50:00.704]  Right, and in fact the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no screen time for children under the age of two at all and then limited use afterwards.
[02:50:00.704 --> 02:50:13.871]  And Israel, with all the things going on in Israel right now, they just this week launched a website in Hebrew, but it can be translated, with safety information for parents and children because they are so deeply concerned about the use of this device.
[02:50:13.871 --> 02:50:16.512]  And in Israel they recommend no Wi-Fi
[02:50:17.052 --> 02:50:21.434]  It's not just a question of being old-fashioned and hanging on to basic reading-writing arithmetic.
[02:50:42.961 --> 02:50:44.862]  That way of learning where a child can listen.
[02:50:44.862 --> 02:50:49.223]  Sure, I mean it's genetic that we've always done it that way, so that's how our brain gets activated.
[02:50:49.223 --> 02:50:52.124]  I don't even know how humanity is going to survive this.
[02:50:52.124 --> 02:50:54.205]  I want to ask you where you think it's all going, Doctor.
[02:50:54.205 --> 02:50:55.885]  Amazing.
[02:50:55.885 --> 02:50:59.146]  EHtrust.org.
[02:50:59.146 --> 02:51:01.667]  When we come back, we'll plug that website one more time.
[02:51:01.667 --> 02:51:02.907]  Our big story.
[02:51:02.907 --> 02:51:07.909]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[02:51:07.909 --> 02:51:10.810]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:13.831]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.
[02:51:13.831 --> 02:51:20.732]  Staffed with formal special operations personnel, GunMagWarehouse.com is the only company that specializes in gun magazines.
[02:51:20.732 --> 02:51:25.194]  GunMagWarehouse.com has the largest selection of the magazines you should stock up on.
[02:51:25.194 --> 02:51:28.915]  Go now to GunMagWarehouse.com before it happens in your state.
[02:51:28.915 --> 02:51:30.295]  Get it before you regret it.
[02:51:30.953 --> 02:51:32.974]  If you own a business, you need customers, right?
[02:51:32.974 --> 02:51:37.537]  Well, your potential customers are listening to this radio program right now, and I can help you reach them.
[02:51:37.537 --> 02:51:42.140]  Hi, I'm Matt Brower, a National Marketing Executive at the radio network responsible for this program.
[02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:48.325]  I can help you customize a national radio campaign that fits your budget, large or small, while targeting your specific audience.
[02:51:48.325 --> 02:51:51.527]  Call me to learn how radio advertising can make your business more profitable.

[02:52:01.433 --> 02:52:02.955]  Open your eyes.
[02:52:02.955 --> 02:52:06.377]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[02:52:06.377 --> 02:52:12.842]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:52:12.842 --> 02:52:21.208]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[02:52:21.208 --> 02:52:22.249]  Open your eyes.
[02:52:22.589 --> 02:52:37.550]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.
[02:52:38.130 --> 02:52:45.872]  Optimize the natural power of your eyes with the latest addition to the super high quality InfoWars Live formulations, Occupower.

[02:52:51.914 --> 02:52:52.434]  Occupower.
[02:52:52.434 --> 02:52:53.094]  Open your eyes.
[02:53:00.325 --> 02:53:09.627]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:53:09.627 --> 02:53:10.427]  This capitalism?
[02:53:10.427 --> 02:53:16.588]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:53:16.588 --> 02:53:20.269]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:53:20.269 --> 02:53:21.189]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:53:21.189 --> 02:53:22.289]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:53:22.289 --> 02:53:22.610]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:22.610 --> 02:53:22.950]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:53:30.171 --> 02:53:31.232]  This is an alert.
[02:53:31.232 --> 02:53:35.334]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:53:35.334 --> 02:53:39.556]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[02:53:39.556 --> 02:53:44.938]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.
[02:53:44.938 --> 02:53:48.460]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[02:53:48.460 --> 02:53:51.681]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.
[02:53:51.681 --> 02:53:52.141]  Call 866-91-STEEL.
[02:53:52.141 --> 02:53:52.402]  866-91-STEEL.
[02:53:52.402 --> 02:53:52.722]  That's 866-917-8335.
[02:54:01.846 --> 02:54:06.849]  We don't need no education.
[02:54:06.849 --> 02:54:11.771]  We don't need no thought control.
[02:54:11.771 --> 02:54:15.673]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[02:54:28.427 --> 02:54:34.192]  Well, she's one of the leading experts on the dangers of cell phone radiation, but it's not just cell phones.
[02:54:34.192 --> 02:54:35.993]  It's across the board.
[02:54:35.993 --> 02:54:38.876]  Ehtrust.org.
[02:54:38.876 --> 02:54:47.763]  And I get real emotional about this because I sit here 20 years on air, literally seeing thousands of news articles while we've been talking for the TV viewers.
[02:54:49.213 --> 02:54:53.156]  We've been throwing up mainstream science studies.
[02:54:53.156 --> 02:54:54.116]  It's not debatable.
[02:54:54.116 --> 02:54:55.717]  The question is how bad is it?
[02:54:55.717 --> 02:54:58.879]  It's not a question of is it bad, it's how bad.
[02:54:58.879 --> 02:55:06.524]  And then all these medical doctors about the skyrocketing brain cancer they're seeing always on the side of the head of where people use the phones.
[02:55:06.524 --> 02:55:07.584]  It's got to stop.
[02:55:07.584 --> 02:55:10.806]  People got to get out of the habit.
[02:55:10.806 --> 02:55:12.908]  Potentially this can end up being bigger than cigarettes.
[02:55:14.079 --> 02:55:15.920]  And they've done mouse studies.
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:18.021]  We've got one of those from PubMed.
[02:55:18.021 --> 02:55:23.444]  Mobile phone radiation and this is mode-dependent DNA damage in mouse.
[02:55:24.727 --> 02:55:32.209]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on with the type of stuff that this is, and manipulating the melatonin.
[02:55:32.209 --> 02:55:36.450]  And that's what I've noticed, Doctor, in closing, is where do you see this going?
[02:55:36.450 --> 02:55:40.892]  A, B, it seems like people that I know that use cell phones are addicted to them.
[02:55:40.892 --> 02:55:44.693]  There'll be a landline right there and they won't use it with zero radiation.
[02:55:45.968 --> 02:55:54.554]  And I've seen studies where they say it can heat the brain one degree, and that it does show heightened activity in the brain, that it almost has a speed effect.
[02:55:54.554 --> 02:55:55.855]  Is that accurate?
[02:55:55.855 --> 02:56:03.239]  Well, we are concerned that it looks like it stimulates dopamine, which is drugs, sex, rock and roll, and maybe cell phones do stimulate the brain.
[02:56:03.239 --> 02:56:07.702]  It could be a physiological component to the addiction.
[02:56:07.702 --> 02:56:11.645]  That is an example of why we need a major research program in this field.
[02:56:12.245 --> 02:56:16.111]  And I think that we will soon be getting it because people are going to demand it.
[02:56:16.111 --> 02:56:17.473]  Now, let me be clear.
[02:56:17.473 --> 02:56:20.898]  The research is not all uniformly showing a problem.
[02:56:20.898 --> 02:56:24.683]  There is a substantial body of research that says there's no problem at all.
[02:56:24.683 --> 02:56:26.125]  And guess what?
[02:56:26.125 --> 02:56:28.409]  It's been paid for, for the most part, by the industry.
[02:56:28.869 --> 02:56:38.215]  And that, unfortunately, creates a very difficult problem for anyone trying to look at the data, because industry has also influenced many official assessments of the problem.
[02:56:38.215 --> 02:56:41.397]  They have not influenced the Israeli government, fortunately.
[02:56:41.397 --> 02:56:44.319]  They have not influenced the French, by the way.
[02:56:44.319 --> 02:56:51.483]  And those governments, as well as some in India, have recently called for severe limits on the use of cell phones by children.
[02:56:51.483 --> 02:56:55.886]  In Belgium, it's against the law for a seven-year-old to be given a cell phone.
[02:56:56.306 --> 02:56:57.967]  I think it should be.
[02:56:57.967 --> 02:56:59.087]  I really do.
[02:56:59.087 --> 02:57:00.248]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:57:00.248 --> 02:57:07.032]  Cell phones have revolutionized our ability to respond to emergencies and our ability to do business, especially in remote areas.
[02:57:07.032 --> 02:57:08.532]  There's no question about it.
[02:57:08.532 --> 02:57:10.033]  People have a right to know.
[02:57:10.033 --> 02:57:12.134]  It's the basic principle of democracy.
[02:57:12.134 --> 02:57:15.936]  They have the right to know how to use these things more safely.
[02:57:15.936 --> 02:57:18.938]  But a child can't have them until they're at the age of consent.
[02:57:18.938 --> 02:57:22.880]  And they have a right to not be given all this stuff and be roasted by it until they're 15 or so.
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:26.301]  And I just have seen too many of the studies as you have.
[02:57:26.301 --> 02:57:29.641]  I just realized that this is an epidemic of cancer.
[02:57:29.641 --> 02:57:33.302]  And now the smart meters that I've read are even stronger in some cases.
[02:57:33.302 --> 02:57:35.402]  I mean, this is just crazy!
[02:57:35.402 --> 02:57:38.723]  Yeah, we do not have adequate information about all of these things.
[02:57:38.723 --> 02:57:40.404]  And that's why it's important that we get it.
[02:57:40.404 --> 02:57:43.464]  That's why we do have to have this major funding.
[02:57:43.464 --> 02:57:44.604]  Two cents a month.
[02:57:44.604 --> 02:57:45.905]  Would you give two cents?
[02:57:45.905 --> 02:57:50.106]  And frankly, Alex, I'm launching that right here and now for the first time.
[02:57:50.106 --> 02:57:51.426]  We haven't even put it up on our website.
[02:57:51.426 --> 02:57:52.146]  Maybe you can help.
[02:57:52.466 --> 02:57:53.146]  I didn't know that.
[02:57:53.146 --> 02:57:58.667]  Well, please come back on next week and do a whole, or later in the week, and do a whole hour and we'll put out your press release and try to help you.
[02:57:58.667 --> 02:58:13.650]  That makes perfect sense, though, because we're going to need to create a whole field of science, as you were saying, just to look at this and just to deal with it, because it's connected to, as you said, breast cancer, testicular cancer, brain cancer.
[02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:15.030]  This is just an epidemic.
[02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:18.271]  How do people find the new environmental trust?
[02:58:18.271 --> 02:58:19.191]  Is that what you're talking about?
[02:58:19.631 --> 02:58:25.594]  The environmentalhealthtrust.org, e-h-trust.org is our website.
[02:58:25.594 --> 02:58:31.957]  We have information there, and we hope that people will download our free information under free downloads.
[02:58:31.957 --> 02:58:33.897]  Go to Facebook and like us.
[02:58:33.897 --> 02:58:34.278]  Follow us.
[02:58:34.278 --> 02:58:38.900]  I'll tell you what, do five more minutes, because I want to know if you're announcing in here, have you put a press release out yet?
[02:58:38.900 --> 02:58:41.281]  Oh wow, well we'll talk to you about getting that done.
[02:58:41.281 --> 02:58:43.222]  Because I'd like to do that with some of our writers.
[02:58:43.222 --> 02:58:46.763]  Maybe Paul Watson or somebody, because that's a great idea.
[02:58:46.763 --> 02:58:47.744]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:51.300 --> 02:59:01.847]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:59:01.847 --> 02:59:08.311]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:08.311 --> 02:59:10.753]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:10.753 --> 02:59:13.754]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:59:13.754 --> 02:59:20.619]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:59:21.039 --> 02:59:24.701]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:24.701 --> 02:59:28.982]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:28.982 --> 02:59:30.763]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:30.763 --> 02:59:38.606]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:38.606 --> 02:59:39.767]  But for how long?
[02:59:39.767 --> 02:59:41.968]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[02:59:41.968 --> 02:59:46.390]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[02:59:46.390 --> 02:59:48.270]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:59:48.270 --> 02:59:49.211]  Just won't quit.
[02:59:52.205 --> 02:59:55.790]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.790 --> 02:59:58.994]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:07.301 --> 03:00:12.143]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:12.143 --> 03:00:13.723]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.723 --> 03:00:15.283]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:15.283 --> 03:00:19.465]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:19.465 --> 03:00:23.526]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:39.653 --> 03:00:49.021]  Dr. Debra Lee Davis, PhD, MPH, one of the leading experts on microwave radiation and what it's doing to the brain.
[03:00:49.021 --> 03:00:58.349]  It's becoming ubiquitous in our culture now and clearly causing developmental problems that they know the cell phones and tablets are just brain damaging children.
[03:00:58.349 --> 03:00:59.330]  That's on record.
[03:00:59.330 --> 03:01:00.371]  That's all over the news.
[03:01:01.372 --> 03:01:02.712]  But still, nothing's being done.
[03:01:02.712 --> 03:01:06.913]  There's no scientific body that looks at what it's specifically doing.
[03:01:06.913 --> 03:01:14.155]  Again, cell phones are at the same frequency oscillation, as she was saying, as microwave ovens.
[03:01:14.155 --> 03:01:16.495]  Meant to get the molecules jumping around.
[03:01:16.495 --> 03:01:22.276]  It was invented when troops were using microwave relay systems to heat their food.
[03:01:22.276 --> 03:01:23.597]  We showed that on screen earlier.
[03:01:23.597 --> 03:01:27.117]  The official history of it.
[03:01:27.117 --> 03:01:30.598]  So she's now announced a plan to try to get an initiative going
[03:01:31.598 --> 03:01:43.366]  Which we've been part of for about four years to get an initiative for three million dollars to harden the power systems with backup transformers so if there's a big solar flare we won't go back to the stone ages.
[03:01:43.366 --> 03:01:44.967]  That's now, Congress is now looking at that.
[03:01:45.979 --> 03:02:01.024]  So, there are things we can do and in closing, Dr. Davis, we'll try to get an article out by tomorrow on what you're calling for here with this video that we're going to then be taking from this live radio show and posting to that article.
[03:02:01.024 --> 03:02:06.406]  What more can you say to folks about getting behind this initiative that you're announcing here today?
[03:02:07.321 --> 03:02:13.265]  Well, you are amazing because, frankly, as I was saying at the start of the break, I'm a scientist.
[03:02:13.265 --> 03:02:15.567]  I can recognize what we need.
[03:02:15.567 --> 03:02:17.248]  I don't know how to make it happen.
[03:02:17.248 --> 03:02:22.751]  I completely support your call for a hardened system for the grid.
[03:02:22.751 --> 03:02:23.332]  And I would add,
[03:02:23.832 --> 03:02:32.878]  It is absolutely insane that we are expanding the use of wireless for businesses right now, because in general it makes us more vulnerable to many things.
[03:02:32.878 --> 03:02:37.901]  It makes us vulnerable to hacking, it's slower, and it endangers our health over the long term.
[03:02:37.901 --> 03:02:44.385]  In fact, it has an effect on wildlife, including migration and bees that we just aren't fully understanding.
[03:02:44.385 --> 03:02:46.606]  What we can do right now is very simple.
[03:02:46.606 --> 03:02:48.968]  Remember, distance is your friend.
[03:02:48.968 --> 03:02:50.689]  That's the basic idea.
[03:02:50.689 --> 03:02:52.230]  You can use these devices
[03:02:53.050 --> 03:02:57.453]  Like mine right now is sitting on my table, wired in with a headset.
[03:02:57.453 --> 03:03:04.938]  If you have a wired headset, do not keep the phone on your body, in your pocket, because then it's just transmitting into you.
[03:03:04.938 --> 03:03:13.644]  In fact, the amount of radiation from your phone that gets into you when it's in your pocket is two to four times greater than when it's smacked against your head.
[03:03:13.644 --> 03:03:16.146]  So, right now, we know what to do.
[03:03:16.146 --> 03:03:17.827]  Distance is your friend.
[03:03:17.827 --> 03:03:20.369]  When a phone is in an area where the signals are weak,
[03:03:20.689 --> 03:03:23.371]  You will notice that your battery drains more quickly.
[03:03:23.371 --> 03:03:25.532]  That's because the phone is smart.
[03:03:25.532 --> 03:03:27.794]  It's programmed to seek a signal.
[03:03:27.794 --> 03:03:29.075]  It's draining the battery.
[03:03:29.075 --> 03:03:40.023]  When a signal is weak, don't use it unless it's an emergency because it will drain the battery and if it's next to your body, it drains it right into you because cell phone antennas are symmetrical.
[03:03:40.023 --> 03:03:47.948]  I am pleased that a number of people in and outside of the government and private sector recognize the importance of trying to reduce this radiation now.
[03:03:47.948 --> 03:03:49.770]  And I think that we're going to see soon
[03:03:50.530 --> 03:03:55.073]  Major manufacturers stepping forward and saying, we now have a safer phone.
[03:03:55.073 --> 03:03:56.794]  It's just like cars today.
[03:03:56.794 --> 03:03:59.095]  There's no such thing as a safe car.
[03:03:59.095 --> 03:04:00.616]  Cars kill people.
[03:04:00.616 --> 03:04:02.977]  Well, we have made them safer.
[03:04:02.977 --> 03:04:05.379]  They have airbags, seatbelts, etc.
[03:04:05.379 --> 03:04:10.221]  You would never think of putting a young baby into the front seat of a car anymore.
[03:04:10.221 --> 03:04:13.603]  Those kinds of things have resulted in safer cars.
[03:04:13.603 --> 03:04:16.045]  We need seatbelts and airbags for our phones today.
[03:04:16.525 --> 03:04:21.306]  We need to design them with smarter systems for operating and smarter hardware as well.
[03:04:21.306 --> 03:04:25.327]  And there are a lot of things that we can do to protect ourselves in the meantime.
[03:04:25.327 --> 03:04:40.830]  Certainly starting with not having very young children, pregnant women using phones and men who want to become fathers need to know you don't keep a phone in your pocket when you're trying to make a healthy baby because cell phone radiation damages sperm health and quality.
[03:04:40.930 --> 03:04:42.652]  Alright, well great job Dr. Davis.
[03:04:42.652 --> 03:04:45.375]  We look forward to having you back for a full hour as soon as you want to.
[03:04:45.375 --> 03:04:51.221]  Try to really warn people because I want to do something about this because I don't want to see my children die of brain cancer.
[03:04:51.221 --> 03:04:56.967]  I don't want to just be roasted by all this Wi-Fi and all these smart meters they're trying to make people take.
[03:04:56.967 --> 03:04:59.710]  We've got to step up and this is a civil rights issue.
[03:04:59.710 --> 03:05:00.591]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:00.591 --> 03:05:01.271]  It is indeed.
[03:05:01.271 --> 03:05:01.752]  Thank you Alex.
