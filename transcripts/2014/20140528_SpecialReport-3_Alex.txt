[00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:07.203]  Drought concerns.
[00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:09.525]  They're very real in the American Southwest.
[00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:15.690]  And here in the state of Texas, many Texas cities and communities have less than 90 days of water in their reserve.
[00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.113]  And that's not even counting the water gouging that would surely take place during some type of crisis.
[00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:24.957]  Now there are reasonable water rationing measures in effect, such as using gray water.
[00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:30.101]  Water from your sink or your bathtub that you store in a tank to water your grass at a later date.
[00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:31.402]  And that sounds perfectly fine.
[00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:37.359]  But there are more extreme measures not only being proposed, but also active in at least one Texas city.
[00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.761]  So in the name of sustainability, would you drink water that was once in your toilet?
[00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.942]  Can I ask you, what measures do you take to keep yourself hydrated?
[00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:47.282]  What measures?
[00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:55.285]  I drink a full glass of water every morning, a full glass of water before exercising, and a full glass of water before bed.
[00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:56.205]  And water in between.
[00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:58.866]  I stop at most of the water fountains on the trail.
[00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:01.327]  Do you guys stop at the water fountains so you're drinking city water?
[00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.126]  Yes.
[00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:03.487]  And what type of water?
[00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:05.068]  Do you drink city water or some other type?
[00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:06.689]  Um, city water.
[00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:07.290]  City water?
[00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.570]  Uh huh.
[00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.633]  Okay, did you know that the city of Austin is considering making toilet water drinking water?
[00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:13.834]  That's disgusting.
[00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:14.935]  It's disgusting?
[00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:16.035]  That's disgusting.
[00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.156]  Would you drink the toilet water?
[00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:17.716]  No.
[00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:19.558]  A city out in West Texas doing it.
[00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:21.059]  I think it's Big Spring, Texas.
[00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.520]  Yeah, yeah, I've heard of them doing it.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.560]  I thought they were crazy for it.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.961]  Do you let your dog drink out of the toilet?
[00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:26.142]  No.
[00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:26.682]  No?
[00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:29.064]  Okay, would you drink out of the toilet?
[00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:30.565]  What do you think?
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.503]  We're all going to have to answer that question soon, I guess, right?
[00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:38.644]  You've heard about this.
[00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:39.704]  You drink a lot of water.
[00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:44.028]  So, you know, you want to stay hydrated, you want to stay healthy, especially as it gets hotter here in the state of Texas.
[00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:47.470]  So, drinking your water morning, noon, and night, would you drink the toilet water?
[00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.391]  I would not.
[00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.492]  Could it ever be clean enough for you to drink it?
[00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:54.896]  They would have to prove that it's clean enough.
[00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:58.218]  Would you consider drinking the water if you knew it was...no?
[00:01:58.358 --> 00:01:59.980]  No, not if I knew toilet water was in it.
[00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:02.956]  I'd want to hear more about it.
[00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.557]  How clean is clean?
[00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:06.078]  How clean would it have to be?
[00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.303]  It would have to be as clean as the water we drink now, and some people think our tap water's not clean enough now.
[00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:18.565]  It'd be fine if I knew it was okay to drink.
[00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:19.626]  How clean is clean?
[00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:20.566]  How clean would it have to be?
[00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:23.068]  I don't know.
[00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:24.349]  That's a good question.
[00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.930]  Now this is a last ditch effort.
[00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.091]  It's nothing that they so much want to do, but
[00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:32.676]  They're thinking that if the drought continues, it may get to the point where they have to drink the toilet water.
[00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.797]  So, could the water ever be clean enough?
[00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:38.499]  I don't... I don't think so.
[00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.321]  Why do we need to resort to that?
[00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:41.882]  Well, we have a water rationing.
[00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:45.144]  In effect, you know, there's a drought going on and... I didn't know that.
[00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:45.324]  Yeah.
[00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:48.606]  So you're saying it can never get to the point where you'd want to drink toilet water?
[00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:53.849]  It depends on the scientific process of what's used to purify it, you know?
[00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.851]  And I'll also tell you that here in the city of Austin, they fluoridate the water.
[00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.291]  And there have been Harvard studies about fluoride reducing people's IQs.
[00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:02.452]  I think I'm pretty smart still.
[00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:07.673]  Fluoride in the water and the mayor of Austin, you know, gives you the finger if you come in there and talk about it.
[00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.494]  Oh, I try to talk to my family about it and they just think I'm crazy.
[00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:14.296]  Harvard studies about fluoride reducing IQ levels.
[00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:17.357]  Well, I guess that explains a lot.
[00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:18.797]  Alright, thank you.
[00:03:18.817 --> 00:03:19.657]  Enjoy your workout, miss.
[00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:21.438]  Thanks, bye.
[00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:25.896]  The city of Big Spring, Texas is already taking water from the toilet to the tap.
[00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:33.202]  And through a multi-stage cleaning process, a representative for the Texas Water Development Board says it tastes just as good as any bottled water.
[00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:42.390]  It tasted not unlike any other drinking water, whether it's from the tap here in the city of Austin or bottled of Ozarka water.
[00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:44.412]  And yes, I'd recommend it.
[00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:48.676]  I recommend any water supply that is readily available and reliable and safe.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.807]  So while the final decision concerning the toilet water may be a ways off, the city of Austin can improve health immediately by simply removing fluoride from the water.
[00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:01.170]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:07.056]  Yeah, that may work for little creatures like my dog, but I'm not gonna eat.
[00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.340]  Texas town, close to toilet to tap loop.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.702]  Is this our future water supply?
[00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:22.349]  And they go on to say that Austin has been doing such a good job saving water that we're now going to get toilet water recycled.
[00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.492]  And again, it's good to save water and not waste it.
[00:04:26.813 --> 00:04:30.336]  But they just want you to not waste it to double, triple charge you.
