[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.531]  On the 26th of April 1986, the worst nuclear power plant disaster in history occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine.
[00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:35.260]  Chernobyl was labeled as a Level 7, the maximum classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale.
[00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:43.893]  At the core of a blown out reactor and buried under 14 meters of rubble, the graphite surrounding the nuclear fuel burns and melts the uranium.
[00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:51.685]  The radioactive fallout is going to be a hundred times greater than the combined power of the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:06.389]  Years later, on the 11th of March, 2011, the Fukushima meltdown reawakened public awareness regarding the ever-present dangers of nuclear power.
[00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.629]  So we're about 270, 276.
[00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:08.930]  So we're maxing out around 280 or so.
[00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.567]  And remember, 30 is what's normal for this location.
[00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:19.070]  Now they're disputing that this isn't the CCM 137.
[00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.794]  They're saying this is radium and other things that naturally occur in the environment.
[00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:25.876]  Whatever it is, it's abnormally high.
[00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:40.528]  With the recent earthquake activity stirring the ring of fire, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant located near Avila Beach in San Luis Obispo, resting near not one but four fault lines, is a clear and present danger.
[00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:46.213]  The second fault, known as the Hosgry Fault, was only discovered after the plant's completion.
[00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:54.801]  In November of 1927, the Hosgry Fault generated a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, 10 miles offshore.
[00:01:55.401 --> 00:02:09.554]  A 2013 document, filed by former Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector Michael Peck, insisted on closing down Diablo until the commission determined whether the plant's equipment could survive higher seismic stress levels.
[00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:17.496]  In 1981, Diablo was incorrectly retrofitted when employees failed to reverse the plans for the twin reactors.
[00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:24.597]  Regardless, the Nuclear Regulation Commission approved the safety of Diablo's monstrosity of incompetence.
[00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:32.339]  Diablo has a seismic monitoring and safety system ready to shut it down immediately in the event of significant ground motion.
[00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:38.340]  The motion is detected by sensors in the ground and provides three-dimensional data on seismic conditions.
[00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:44.878]  But that won't stop the potential damage unleashed by the fuel rods as witnessed during the Fukushima debacle.
[00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:57.707]  Of course, Pacific Gas and Electric would like you to believe this ticking time bomb is good for jobs, energy consumption of its two million recipients, and the way forward as old man coal is aggressively shut down.
[00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:00.168]  So, if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:08.634]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.695]  But the voices opposed are many.
[00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:28.920]  After President Richard Nixon called for construction of 1,000 nuclear plants by the year 2000, 1,900 anti-nuclear movement protesters were arrested in 1981 during a 10-day civil disobedience blockade of the Diablo Canyon power plant.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.722]  With the main gate cleared and the last blockader in jail, Pacific Gas and Electric made final preparations to start the reactor.
[00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:46.201]  But then, at the last moment, PG&E publicly admitted a grave mistake.
[00:03:47.702 --> 00:03:51.084]  There are two reactors at Diablo, mirror images of each other.
[00:03:52.045 --> 00:04:03.611]  The blueprints for units 1 and 2 had gotten mixed up, and the earthquake supports for the cooling pipes, the same cooling system designed to prevent a meltdown, had been installed backwards.
[00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:09.555]  It was the first of hundreds of mistakes discovered later.
[00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.537]  All made on the two and a half billion dollar structure described by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as the most highly analyzed building in the world.
[00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:29.587]  Today most locals and tourists are completely unaware of the passion Californians vented against the nuclear energy mafia just 33 years ago.
[00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:33.150]  Fukushima resting right over those mountains.
[00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:35.345]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:43.967]  Experts would have us just bury our heads in the sand, but some are already preparing for the inevitability of America's Fukushima.
[00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:47.768]  If Diablo blows, nobody's staying around to use it.
[00:04:48.068 --> 00:04:53.270]  I've actually got backpacks in my car, you know, for heading out.
[00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.810]  Preparedness I think is very important.
[00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.390]  Yeah.
[00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:01.872]  But the whole idea that they're going to sound the sirens and we're all going to head north, it just won't work.
[00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:02.332]  Yeah.
[00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:03.151]  Northeast.
[00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:04.732]  So, I wish it wasn't there.
[00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.773]  But it is and maybe they'll deactivate it and that would be fine with me.
[00:05:09.793 --> 00:05:11.274]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:15.335]  I think it's great how the citizens on our own can be prepared.
[00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:21.777]  Yet, you know, we're asking our government basically to take care of us and they're, you know, telling us to look the other way.
[00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:25.339]  And how can you do that when all of this is at risk?
[00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.460]  Well, it always comes in the limelight once there's an earthquake.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.141]  So the SNAP earthquake has made everybody kind of think about it again.
[00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:37.759]  You know, that a good earthquake would cause the plant to blow and we'd want to get out of here.
[00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:48.751]  When you look around and you see all this beauty, all these families, all these people, how does that make you feel knowing that they're okay with a potential Fukushima situation here in America?
[00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:50.513]  We know we couldn't all get out.
[00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:58.182]  You know, they say head north, I mean, yeah, head east, northeast, once the plant warns us.
[00:05:59.923 --> 00:06:01.024]  But you know that you couldn't do that.
[00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:02.205]  The freeway would be jammed.
[00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:07.608]  That's why, you know, we know we could go across the Santa Maria River bed and head south.
[00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:16.954]  I raised seven children in this town and I taught them all to run home no matter what the school told them, because we were going to hop in the car and get out somehow.
[00:06:17.214 --> 00:06:18.795]  They weren't going to wait for school buses.
[00:06:18.975 --> 00:06:20.216]  But yeah, it's a big problem.
[00:06:20.984 --> 00:06:27.965]  They say we provide 20% of California's power with that plant, but I think they named it Diablo for a reason.
[00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:32.901]  As the purported Chinese curse goes, may you live in interesting times.
[00:06:33.522 --> 00:06:35.924]  For InfoWars.com, I'm John Bowne.
[00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:40.868]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.431]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:53.440]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:01.982]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
