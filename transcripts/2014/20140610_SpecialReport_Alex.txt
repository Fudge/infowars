[00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:16.156]  In an unprecedented move, one of the world's largest telecoms, Vodafone, released a report disclosing the vast scope of government surveillance.
[00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:29.530]  According to this report, government agencies are able to listen to phone conversations live, and even track the location of citizens without warrants, using secret cables that are connected directly into network equipment.
[00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:44.058]  According to the Law Enforcement Disclosure Report, Vodafone says that the 29 countries it operates in all have different laws, and they demand that they restrict or block certain access to customers, or allow governments to directly access information about them.
[00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:53.103]  Shockingly, Vodafone admits refusing to comply with these laws is not an option, because a country could then stop them from operating within its borders.
[00:00:53.743 --> 00:01:02.388]  Some of the countries are made to provide a direct access cable straight into their network, allowing governments to siphon off any data that they wish.
[00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:16.076]  Now I'm not talking about the NSA, but governments around the world are abusing privacy by demanding access to communications and data, and alarmingly sometimes granting themselves direct access to the networks.
[00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:27.726]  Another scandalous admission from Vodafone's report, data can be intercepted by various agencies in the interest of national security, pre-crime, and in the interest of economic well-being.
[00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:31.069]  In other words, telecom spy for the big banks.
[00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.592]  This is similar to the information we know about fusion centers.
[00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:49.304]  Created across the country in the aftermath of 9-11 to spy on Americans and act as a funnel to the federal government, fusion center data is actually accessed by private sector businesses responsible for critical infrastructure and key resources.
[00:01:49.724 --> 00:02:05.418]  This includes commercial facilities, communications, defense, emergency services, energy, food and agriculture, healthcare and public health, IT, nuclear reactors, transportation, water and wastewater systems, and finance.
[00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:14.646]  Under this definition, nearly anyone in the private business sector could potentially access Fusion Center reports, including large financial institutions.
[00:02:15.253 --> 00:02:24.817]  Bank of America's secret spying relationship with several federal agencies was exposed this year when leaked emails detailed the bank's superior ability to track political groups.
[00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:30.939]  The email reads, if you find any intel on anarchists or Occupy protesters, please let me know.
[00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.721]  I will most likely find it first as social media trolling is not what the WSP does best.
[00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:41.303]  Bank of America has a team of 20 people and that's all they do all day.
[00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:48.247]  And the Stingray cell tracking device works by mimicking a real cell phone tower, tricking phones into connecting to it.
[00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:54.111]  Florida police have been busted using the Stingray device at least 200 times without a warrant.
[00:02:54.611 --> 00:03:07.360]  Alex Jones reported in Police State 2000 about FEMA installing control boxes into all radio and broadcast stations, giving them the ability to take over the airwaves at any time to broadcast government propaganda.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.061]  But you're thinking the media will keep you abreast of the situation?
[00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:15.084]  Well, my friends, you're looking at a FEMA control box.
[00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:20.666]  That's right, at 98.9 KJFKFM, where I work, in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.148]  That, my friends, can take over the radio station.
[00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.147]  It is radio-controlled by a FEMA tower.
[00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:31.229]  That's right, a FEMA tower in New Braunfels, Texas.
[00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.273]  Little teletypes come printing out of the side of the machine weekly and update us.
[00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:38.695]  In the past, it was voluntary.
[00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:43.418]  Now it's mandatory and they can, remote control, take over the station.
[00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:47.899]  Vodafone certainly isn't the only telecom forced to comply with government surveillance.
[00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.999]  Just the first to be honest about it.
[00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:59.921]  Now Vodafone released this report in an effort to regain consumer trust while also explaining how they deal with intrusive government control that's trending toward corporate fascism.
[00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:06.542]  But this is also just the latest revelation, throwing it in your face, that Big Brother's eyes and ears are everywhere.
[00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:09.163]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.981]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.121]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
