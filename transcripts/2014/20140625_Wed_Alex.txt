[00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.011]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:03.692]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:07.736]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:16.344]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.046]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:19.868]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:21.349]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:31.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:36.586]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:37.266]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:42.109]  I'll be your host today on this Wednesday, June 25th, 2014.
[00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:43.869]  Going very quickly.
[00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:44.910]  We're about halfway through 2014.
[00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.373]  Today we've had a landmark decision, I think, from the Supreme Court.
[00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:53.314]  They actually endorsed the Fourth Amendment.
[00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:56.775]  Who would have thought that the Supreme Court would endorse the Fourth Amendment?
[00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:00.276]  We're going to be talking about that, and we're going to be talking about the police state.
[00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:03.357]  We're going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us at the bottom of this hour.
[00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:10.659]  In the third hour, we're going to be joined by Cheryl Chumley, and we'll talk about the book that she wrote, Police State USA.
[00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:16.121]  And Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the second hour with a report about the
[00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.523]  America being destroyed by design.
[00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:21.524]  This is all connected.
[00:01:21.604 --> 00:01:26.788]  It's not that we have Homeland Security that is pushing this police state on local police departments.
[00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.351]  The Defense Department equipping them with mine-ready vehicles that we see everywhere.
[00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.672]  It's not just that kind of militarization.
[00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:39.373]  It's also Homeland Security has the control of the borders.
[00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:42.753]  They're the ones who are standing down at the border.
[00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:45.014]  They have control of border patrols.
[00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:46.294]  They have control of ICE.
[00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:49.075]  And they also have control of the TSA.
[00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.683]  Where they are not standing down.
[00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:53.624]  So what is this all about?
[00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:56.326]  This is a planned design.
[00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:57.487]  This is treason.
[00:01:57.507 --> 00:02:02.031]  And that's what Alex Jones is going to be talking about in the second hour as he joins us.
[00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.575]  And of course, we're going to have updates on what's going on with the collapsing borders.
[00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:11.979]  But today, primarily, we're going to be talking with Paul Joseph Watson and Cheryl Chumley about the other aspect of it.
[00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.342]  And that is, how do they treat us within the borders?
[00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.424]  Well, it's a police state.
[00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:23.770]  Just yesterday evening we had an article from Infowars.com that Paul Joseph Watson wrote.
[00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.691]  We're going to talk to him about it.
[00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:25.792]  It was picked up on Drudge.
[00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:32.979]  Woman says DHS forced her to strip naked at gunpoint during a terrifying dawn raid.
[00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.840]  Yeah, see the problem is...
[00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:42.790]  Is that our police state is essentially stripping us all naked in our person, places, effects, our data.
[00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.113]  They are constantly watching everything we do.
[00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:51.059]  And we are not allowed to even look them in the eye, just like this lady.
[00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.242]  They handcuff us, put us on the floor and tell us to shut up and don't look at them.
[00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:56.364]  We're tired of this.
[00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.547]  We're not going to put up with this.
[00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:10.118]  It's amazing for me to see, as we got Cheryl Trumley and we're going to be talking about her book, Police State USA, it's amazing to see an article from The Guardian today talking about the very same thing.
[00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:13.542]  Of course, she documents this going way back, documents it very...
[00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:14.602]  Very thoroughly.
[00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:19.725]  But this article from the Guardian that came up today is talking about the exact same thing.
[00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:21.826]  The militarization of the police force.
[00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:27.528]  They start out with a case of a family that was hit with a SWAT team raid.
[00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:30.990]  They threw a flashbang grenade in the baby's crib.
[00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.151]  We've talked about this when it first came out.
[00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:39.196]  Uh, have critically injured that baby, uh, throwing a grenade in its crib.
[00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:41.198]  This is the type of thing that's happening.
[00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:48.766]  If this was only happening once, if it was only the baby with the flashbang grenade in the crib, we should do something about it.
[00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:59.311]  If it was only this lady who was stripped naked by the Homeland Security people, SWAT team, coming into her home, trashing her home, not telling her what it's about.
[00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.231]  That's the other aspect of the police state.
[00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:04.393]  You're not allowed to know why they're doing anything.
[00:04:04.653 --> 00:04:06.394]  They won't give you any answers.
[00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:08.034]  She still doesn't have answers.
[00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:15.558]  People who have been put on the no-fly list still don't have answers as to either why they were put on or when they were taken off, why they were taken off.
[00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:25.890]  We covered the story, one of the first stories when I came here back in October 2012 was about Wade Hicks who was on his way to Japan to see his wife on a military plane.
[00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.793]  He was taken off of that plane in Hawaii.
[00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:29.658]  Not given a reason.
[00:04:29.698 --> 00:04:40.185]  This was a guy who had, just recently before he traveled, he had been, this was on a Department of Defense plane, he had been vetted by Homeland Security itself, had a special pass as a worker.
[00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:47.030]  He was taken off, eventually he was taken off the plane and stranded for days in Hawaii because he couldn't get anywhere from there without flying.
[00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:56.517]  And so, eventually he was taken off of that list, he was eventually brought back to the US, but he never got an explanation as to why he was put on, or even if he was in fact taken off.
[00:04:57.057 --> 00:04:58.903]  That's the kind of police state we have.
[00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:02.775]  Today there's been some key Supreme Court decisions and we're going to talk about that.
[00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.520]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:11.946]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:19.451]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:30.318]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:39.965]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:44.106]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:05:44.746 --> 00:05:48.206]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:50.067]  Experience the new formula.
[00:05:50.587 --> 00:05:52.547]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:05:53.147 --> 00:05:54.088]  Shield your family.
[00:05:54.488 --> 00:05:55.868]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:05:56.308 --> 00:05:58.888]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.429]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:15.125]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:18.427]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:18.447 --> 00:06:20.169]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:26.495]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:32.460]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.381]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:39.442]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:39.462 --> 00:06:47.664]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:49.965]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:51.065]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:51.445 --> 00:07:00.188]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:02.829]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:07.331]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:14.938]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:19.342]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:24.268]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:27.290]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.773]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:07:33.034 --> 00:07:39.918]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:07:40.438 --> 00:07:44.201]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:49.364]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:49.684 --> 00:07:50.525]  This is innovating.
[00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:58.089]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:02.351]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:23.093]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:27.838]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:34.066]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, on this Wednesday, June 25th, 2014.
[00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:39.128]  Today we have an amazing Supreme Court decision.
[00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:40.348]  And it was unanimous.
[00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.269]  They unanimously upheld the Fourth Amendment.
[00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.450]  Didn't think I would ever live to see it.
[00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:54.133]  But that's good news, and we're going to talk about that, what it means for you, and some of the inherent contradictions now that are left hanging out there.
[00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:59.175]  But before we get into that, I want to talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:01.978]  About the lifestyles of the rich and infamous.
[00:09:01.998 --> 00:09:09.768]  You know, the Mail Online just pointed out today that she's getting $225,000 to speak at the University of Las Vegas.
[00:09:09.848 --> 00:09:11.891]  The University of Nevada in Las Vegas.
[00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:22.258]  That's happening at the same time that the university just announced a 4% tuition increase for those same students.
[00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:27.160]  And they're kind of seeing the cognitive dissonance of this.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.003]  Here's this person who loves to put herself out there as someone who is for the little person standing up against the wealthy elite.
[00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:40.608]  She said she was dead broke when she and Bill left the presidency, the co-presidency, I guess.
[00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:53.197]  And yet, here she is, the same person, and the Clinton Foundation has gotten half of a billion dollars, half a billion dollars, from Goldman Sachs alone for their Clinton Foundation.
[00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:58.561]  They have fundraisers at the Goldman Sachs headquarters for their Clinton Foundation.
[00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:02.765]  I'm reminded of what, I think it was HL Minkin, it might have been Mark Twain, I don't know,
[00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.688]  Elections are advanced auctions of stolen goods.
[00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:11.111]  Well, that certainly is the case in this case with Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:22.020]  Now, they say, of course, that this $225,000 that she's getting to speak to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, that money will not go into the Clinton Fund.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.641]  That's going to go to her personally.
[00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:27.644]  Now, we have an article up on Infowars.com that says if the Clintons are worth $50 million,
[00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:31.886]  Why do they get nearly a million dollars a year from the taxpayers?
[00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:34.108]  This is by Michael Schneider, Economic Collapse.
[00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:41.611]  He says since leaving the White House, the Clintons have earned at least a hundred million dollars and currently have a net worth of fifty million dollars.
[00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:48.014]  So why do we need to give him nine hundred and forty four thousand dollars a year to fund his extravagant lifestyle?
[00:10:48.675 --> 00:10:51.036]  And he points out that it's not just Bill Clinton.
[00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:55.421]  It's also George W. Bush, who actually gets more.
[00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:58.704]  He actually gets $1.28 million a year.
[00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:02.088]  And listen to the kind of stuff that W. spends his money on.
[00:11:02.549 --> 00:11:03.730]  He spends $102,000 for telephone expenses in 2014.
[00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.838]  $135,000 more on furniture, computer, office supplies, and other miscellany.
[00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.621]  I left it there as a pause for that to sink in.
[00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:17.523]  $102,000 in phone expenses.
[00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:23.568]  And as he points out, Michael Schneider points out in his article, does W have the world's worst calling plan?
[00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:27.691]  How do you spend $102,000 on phone calls?
[00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:28.092]  I don't know.
[00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:29.273]  But then he also points out that
[00:11:29.953 --> 00:11:36.178]  Other members of royalty, Obama has 469 senior staff who work directly under him.
[00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:39.560]  226 of them make more than $100,000 a year.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.364]  His dog handler for the family dog, Bo, reportedly makes $102,000 a year.
[00:11:45.724 --> 00:11:46.205]  There you go.
[00:11:46.965 --> 00:11:48.006]  Guess we are going to the dogs.
[00:11:48.046 --> 00:11:55.491]  But, you know, Will and Kate of the UK are just remodeling one of their palaces and they're spending £4 million.
[00:11:57.025 --> 00:11:59.288]  But they said, don't worry, we paid for it ourselves.
[00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.071]  Where did they get that money?
[00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:02.674]  I mean, you know, that kind of...
[00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:11.542]  Kind of brings back memories of Obama's, you didn't build that, you know, they didn't earn that money and I don't think the Clintons have really earned this money either.
[00:12:11.582 --> 00:12:21.751]  It just strikes at the hypocrisy and hopefully the people who would tend to vote for someone like Hillary, who would be taken in by her rhetoric, would be wise enough to see this.
[00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:27.816]  We're also going to be talking about the hypocrisy, not today, but we're going to, we talked about this on Sunday with
[00:12:28.636 --> 00:12:33.819]  Alex Jones, we talked about the hypocrisy of Hillary appealing to women.
[00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:57.691]  They're all about seeing a woman in the White House, and yet information has surfaced about Hillary Clinton, one of the early things that she did when she was just a 27-year-old lawyer, how she got off a rapist, a pedophile rapist, who had raped a 13-year-old girl, caused her to have health problems the rest of her life, and the audio tape has now surfaced of that and gone viral.
[00:12:58.251 --> 00:13:07.279]  Where you can actually hear Hillary Clinton laughing about the fact, hey this guy actually passed a lie detector test that destroyed my confidence forever in polygraphs.
[00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.140]  She knew this guy was guilty.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.303]  She got him off on technicalities and she laughed about it.
[00:13:12.983 --> 00:13:21.230]  Okay, we've heard this story about Hillary Clinton many, many times about how she has been the war on women and yet
[00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.233]  This is, I think, the most damaging thing.
[00:13:24.273 --> 00:13:27.916]  The hypocrisy of the Hillary Clinton candidacy.
[00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:31.078]  The fact that she thinks that she's for the... People think she's for the little people.
[00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:32.800]  People think she's for women's rights.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.201]  Nothing of the sort.
[00:13:34.641 --> 00:13:36.623]  She is a corrupt elitist.
[00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:37.984]  Just like Obama.
[00:13:38.024 --> 00:13:39.905]  Just like George W. Bush.
[00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:42.607]  Now, I was talking about the Supreme Court decision and...
[00:13:43.564 --> 00:13:46.526]  We're going to be talking about the police state predominantly today.
[00:13:46.566 --> 00:13:49.428]  We're going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:49.589 --> 00:14:00.517]  We're going to be talking in the third hour to Cheryl Chumley, who wrote a book, Police State USA, cataloging what has been happening to our country, where it is going, what we can do about it.
[00:14:00.537 --> 00:14:02.038]  We're going to be talking to her in the third hour.
[00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:09.984]  And Alex Jones is going to be tying a lot of this together because, you know, it's Homeland Security that runs not only the police state and pushes that at the local level
[00:14:10.444 --> 00:14:12.546]  But they, of course, are in charge of our borders.
[00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:19.370]  And so Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the second hour with a report, Treason America Destroyed by Design.
[00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:25.415]  But as we're talking about the police state, let's look at the Supreme Court decision that came out today.
[00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:29.898]  Up on Infowars.com, we see an article here from Stephen Dynan of the Washington Times.
[00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:32.240]  Supreme Court bans warrantless cell phone searches.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.240]  This just came out.
[00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:38.004]  They rule today that police cannot go snooping through people's cell phones without a warrant.
[00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:44.826]  And a unanimous decision that he says amounts to a major statement in favor of privacy rights.
[00:14:45.066 --> 00:14:49.108]  It's a 21st century update to the legal understanding of privacy rights.
[00:14:49.168 --> 00:14:51.769]  It is long, long overdue.
[00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:57.111]  And when I look at this, and I look at their past record of things that they've decided,
[00:14:58.132 --> 00:15:09.198]  As USA Today pointed out when they covered this story today, they said in the past two years, the Supreme Court has ruled that police can swab a suspect's cheek for DNA in order to put it into an unsolved crimes database.
[00:15:09.739 --> 00:15:13.581]  They can conduct strip searches of prisoners without reasonable suspicion.
[00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:20.390]  And they have said that police need a warrant to attach a GPS device to a suspect's car.
[00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:28.822]  And yet, we still see these cases of the stingray devices that local police stations are using throughout the country.
[00:15:28.902 --> 00:15:29.943]  Police departments are...
[00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:35.527]  Using Stingray devices to track people's whereabouts without actually attaching it.
[00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:39.169]  See, that's the kind of prevarication around the bush these guys like to do.
[00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:53.336]  When the Supreme Court does slap them down and say, you can't attach a GPS device to the suspect's car, they say, well, okay, we've got this new device called Stingray, which we first talked about a couple of years ago here at InfoWars.
[00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:54.237]  We're telling people about it.
[00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:58.880]  Now we've had several cases where local police departments are exposed.
[00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:00.862]  We just had one this last week.
[00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:17.654]  And when they're exposed and criticized for it, they say, well, of course, we couldn't tell anybody about it and we couldn't get a search warrant for it because we signed a non-disclosure agreement with the company that sells this, saying that we would not get search warrants to perform this.
[00:16:19.015 --> 00:16:19.696]  You understand that?
[00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:28.015]  The non-disclosure agreement with the company that sells it is more important to them than the Constitution.
[00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:33.520]  Does that make it clear to you that we're living under a corporate fascist state?
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:47.011]  Their legal agreements with these military industrial police state surveillance companies and their equipment that they're selling, that takes precedent over their oath to the Constitution, over the supreme law of the land.
[00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:50.463]  It means that they're not going to get a search warrant.
[00:16:50.523 --> 00:16:57.049]  Well, today, fortunately, the Supreme Court says that they cannot pick up smartphones and search them without a warrant.
[00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:07.038]  Now, the case that happened here is this guy was pulled over, he had expired tags, then they found out that his driver's license was suspended, then they search his car and they find that he's got a couple loaded guns.
[00:17:07.098 --> 00:17:08.739]  At that point, they arrest him.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.643]  Then they grab his phone, they start looking at it, they find photos that show that he's part of a gang.
[00:17:14.324 --> 00:17:17.966]  Then they find a photo of a car that had been used in a drive-by shooting.
[00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:22.308]  And based on that, they charged him with attempted murder in a drive-by gang shooting.
[00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:24.810]  They sentenced him 15 years to life.
[00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.571]  And that was the California Supreme Court rejected it.
[00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:29.132]  They took it all the way to the U.S.
[00:17:29.172 --> 00:17:29.712]  Supreme Court.
[00:17:29.812 --> 00:17:42.119]  And today, they unanimously said that cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee's person.
[00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:44.616]  That can be searched without a warrant.
[00:17:44.716 --> 00:17:54.160]  Now I have a problem with that because the Fourth Amendment clearly says that you are secure in your person, your houses, your papers, your effects.
[00:17:55.481 --> 00:18:06.666]  Now that's pretty inclusive and I think that that makes it very clear that they can't go through your wallets, your purses, your notepads, which they say have been fair game and are fair game.
[00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:08.207]  I don't think those are fair game.
[00:18:08.947 --> 00:18:10.788]  When you are secure in your person,
[00:18:11.428 --> 00:18:16.012]  In your house, in your papers, in your effects, that's very comprehensive.
[00:18:16.572 --> 00:18:29.962]  And just because they don't label every single thing and say electronic cell phone, because they didn't write electronic cell phone in 1789, that doesn't mean that you don't have that protection.
[00:18:30.003 --> 00:18:36.628]  They're laying down a principle here, and of course those principles don't change even though technology does change.
[00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:38.729]  And the Fourth Amendment says that
[00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.452]  The government needs to have a warrant.
[00:18:42.552 --> 00:18:44.393]  And listen to what they need to have a warrant for.
[00:18:44.413 --> 00:18:45.933]  It needs to be specific.
[00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:52.717]  Specific to the place, to the things, to the people that they're going to search.
[00:18:53.197 --> 00:19:00.881]  You have to specifically say, I want to look at this particular device or this purse or whatever to go through that.
[00:19:00.921 --> 00:19:01.462]  You don't
[00:19:02.082 --> 00:19:12.486]  Have the legal authority, the government does not have the legal authority to just stop people on the street and demand like Nazi Germany, give me your identity papers please.
[00:19:12.846 --> 00:19:13.626]  You can't do that.
[00:19:13.766 --> 00:19:15.727]  That's a totalitarian police state.
[00:19:15.747 --> 00:19:19.609]  That's what we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson about at the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:19.629 --> 00:19:22.390]  That's what we're going to be talking to Cheryl Trumley about in the third hour.
[00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:29.817]  But that's what we have had, and I have a problem with the fact that they're still carving out exceptions for these other things.
[00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:38.345]  If we were secure in our person, places, our homes, we would not be having these kind of no-knock SWAT team raids.
[00:19:38.585 --> 00:19:42.009]  Even whether, some cases they've got a search warrant, some cases they don't.
[00:19:42.569 --> 00:19:43.951]  And the saddest thing about it,
[00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:57.258]  Is that we see Supreme Court justices like Scalia say, well, hey, you know, obviously these rights that are in the Bill of Rights are not absolute because if they were, the Fourth Amendment would stop the TSA from searching people at the airport.
[00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.780]  Boy, it's that upside-down logic.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.682]  We're going to be talking about that and we're going to be talking about the police state.
[00:20:03.742 --> 00:20:04.262]  Stay with us.
[00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:12.420]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.552]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:38.632 --> 00:24:42.798]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson in just a moment.
[00:24:42.818 --> 00:24:47.004]  He's going to talk to us about this appalling story that he reported on yesterday.
[00:24:47.024 --> 00:24:52.872]  It was picked up by Drudge, a woman who was forced to strip naked at gunpoint during a terrifying SWAT raid.
[00:24:53.953 --> 00:25:02.079]  This is Homeland Security coming into her home, and of course, as usual, we don't get any explanation as to why they did this.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.902]  Still, as far as I know, there's no explanation about it, but Paul's going to go over those details with us.
[00:25:06.942 --> 00:25:08.223]  Paul, welcome.
[00:25:09.184 --> 00:25:10.205]  Hi David, good to be back.
[00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:11.742]  It's good to have you.
[00:25:12.422 --> 00:25:13.463]  This is amazing to me.
[00:25:13.503 --> 00:25:20.851]  And of course, as I said in the very first segment, I feel like we've all been essentially stripped naked by Homeland Security.
[00:25:20.891 --> 00:25:22.833]  They watch everything we do.
[00:25:23.434 --> 00:25:24.995]  Nothing escapes their scrutiny.
[00:25:25.536 --> 00:25:28.439]  And we dare not question it or look them in the eye.
[00:25:28.459 --> 00:25:30.081]  And of course, they don't give us any explanation.
[00:25:30.121 --> 00:25:34.125]  Have they ever given any explanation to this woman or to her boyfriend, husband?
[00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:43.930]  No, this merely came out on YouTube and a Tea Party website over the past couple of days, so DHS has said nothing about it so far.
[00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:53.819]  All we know about it is what the woman involved in the incident told us, so while it's still up in the air, as he said, the details that she described were shocking to say the least.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.901]  Yeah, tell us some of those details that are in your article.
[00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:59.530]  Well this is basically a couple in Florida.
[00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:05.193]  They were the victims of a dawn raid on their home by both police and DHS agents.
[00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:08.894]  They basically burst into the house at 6am.
[00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:19.019]  The couple were in the shower, they'd just got out of the shower so they were wrapped in towels and the DHS agents pointed guns at them and demanded that they disrobe.
[00:26:19.499 --> 00:26:24.141]  So you had basically a naked woman being forced onto the ground at gunpoint.
[00:26:25.382 --> 00:26:34.232]  The woman's boyfriend said that one of the DHS agents then proceeded to ogle her naked body up and down like, quote, a piece of candy.
[00:26:34.933 --> 00:26:43.202]  And after that, they spent two hours trashing their house, said apparently they were looking for electronics and laptops.
[00:26:43.262 --> 00:26:44.544]  Now, they did have a warrant.
[00:26:45.084 --> 00:26:51.527]  They claimed they were looking for electronics and laptops, but the woman claims that they didn't even remove any electronic material.
[00:26:51.847 --> 00:26:55.588]  They showed little interest in what was on the computers and the laptops.
[00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:59.610]  And basically, it was described as a feeding frenzy.
[00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.651]  She described it as, quote, two hours of pure hell.
[00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:04.811]  They trashed the house and left again.
[00:27:05.392 --> 00:27:13.875]  So, as you said, it ties into these fears, which were again brought forward by John W. Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute earlier this week.
[00:27:14.395 --> 00:27:24.862]  Which is that the DHS itself is turning into this kind of national police force, this standing army that is increasingly becoming outside of the law.
[00:27:25.222 --> 00:27:31.927]  It's being used for numerous different purposes, spying on protesters, conducting raids as we see in this case.
[00:27:32.307 --> 00:27:42.814]  So it's part of this growing fear that the Department of Homeland Security is turning into this feared federal national police force with no regard for the Constitution whatsoever.
[00:27:43.234 --> 00:27:43.794]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:43.814 --> 00:27:58.405]  You know, there's an article from the Guardian today talking about another egregious case where they basically did a SWAT team raid, threw a flashbang grenade into the crib of an 18-year-old, and if he survives, he's going to be severely impaired for life.
[00:27:59.085 --> 00:28:04.049]  And they're sounding, the Guardian is now sounding like the New American.
[00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:04.870]  It's amazing.
[00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.433]  You know, 30 years ago, the John Birch Society warning us about the federalization of the police.
[00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:13.972]  Well, because they're targeting both left and right.
[00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:19.853]  I mean, we've seen the DHS, they post their FPS agents outside Tea Party protests.
[00:28:20.313 --> 00:28:24.174]  We know that they were also involved in cracking down on the Occupy movement.
[00:28:24.194 --> 00:28:29.016]  They were caught spying on environmental protesters via the Federal Protective Service.
[00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:37.518]  So they're targeting both left and right of the political spectrum, which is why, as he said, now the Guardian's reporting on it, people are starting to realize that this
[00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:38.198]  Yes.
[00:28:54.344 --> 00:28:58.185]  Not even buying them, being given them by the Department of Defense.
[00:28:58.446 --> 00:29:00.666]  They just have to pay for the cost to go and pick them up.
[00:29:01.067 --> 00:29:02.827]  So they're becoming more militarized.
[00:29:03.407 --> 00:29:07.229]  They're buying equipment that was used on insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:29:07.289 --> 00:29:09.910]  So again, we ask the question, who are the new insurgents?
[00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:18.533]  And as the DHS itself and other federal authorities have said, you know, it's veterans, it's Tea Party people, it's anyone that's basically political.
[00:29:18.553 --> 00:29:20.694]  And now we're seeing more and more of these raids.
[00:29:20.854 --> 00:29:21.194]  Exactly.
[00:29:21.214 --> 00:29:31.584]  We've seen training scenarios coming out over and over and over again from the military, from training institutions where they train people in the army about counterinsurgency.
[00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:35.548]  And of course the villains are typically going to be Tea Party people.
[00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:39.851]  And that's what we saw when we covered the counterinsurgency
[00:29:40.632 --> 00:29:41.512]  In Virginia.
[00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:49.274]  You know, this is an organization, Asymmetric Warfare, that's always worked on counterinsurgency, but now they're training for America, and we know which Americans they're training for.
[00:29:49.495 --> 00:29:56.356]  We're gonna be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, and that was an 18-month-old, not an 18-year-old that was in the crib.
[00:29:56.396 --> 00:29:58.297]  Just to clarify that, I misspoke earlier.
[00:29:58.837 --> 00:29:59.717]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:01.818]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.758 --> 00:30:05.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.597 --> 00:30:11.498]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:11.818 --> 00:30:19.742]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:19.843 --> 00:30:27.166]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:27.427 --> 00:30:31.689]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:30:32.009 --> 00:30:42.172]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:30:42.632 --> 00:30:48.793]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:51.354]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:55.335]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[00:30:55.495 --> 00:30:57.097]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:30:57.438 --> 00:31:01.383]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[00:31:09.457 --> 00:31:13.459]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:17.622]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:21.264]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:31:21.524 --> 00:31:24.406]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:31:24.566 --> 00:31:31.931]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:35.773]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:40.296]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:31:40.456 --> 00:31:46.379]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.222]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:31:50.362 --> 00:31:52.904]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:31:53.104 --> 00:31:54.464]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:31:54.605 --> 00:31:55.845]  It's time to take action.
[00:31:55.985 --> 00:31:57.686]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:32:07.073 --> 00:32:16.542]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:16.663 --> 00:32:18.825]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:19.005 --> 00:32:24.110]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:29.215]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:29.435 --> 00:32:32.497]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:32.758 --> 00:32:36.620]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.084]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:41.164 --> 00:32:51.171]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:51.391 --> 00:32:53.913]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[00:32:54.093 --> 00:32:57.316]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:32:57.356 --> 00:32:58.377]  Government is the problem.
[00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:24.407]  From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:33:24.947 --> 00:33:31.310]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:33:34.953 --> 00:33:38.254]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[00:33:43.938 --> 00:33:46.219]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.461]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:33:50.361 --> 00:34:00.049]  You've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.852]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:34:04.693 --> 00:34:05.894]  You should reject these voices.
[00:34:15.996 --> 00:34:23.141]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:30.986]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:35.750]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.511]  Because there is a war on.
[00:34:38.191 --> 00:34:38.952]  Or you're mine.
[00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:42.262]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:42.342 --> 00:34:45.904]  I'm David Knight in Austin and I'm joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[00:34:45.944 --> 00:34:59.974]  We've been talking about his article yesterday that was picked up on the Drudge Report about a Florida woman whose home was raided and she and her boyfriend were stripped naked by the police, handcuffed and held for a couple of hours without explanation.
[00:35:00.575 --> 00:35:03.157]  And although they had a search warrant, the question is
[00:35:03.957 --> 00:35:07.501]  Is this the way we want to live in our society?
[00:35:07.921 --> 00:35:16.090]  Because we see this happening to innocent people all the time, and even whether or not the people are innocent, we see them, we see innocent casualties.
[00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:21.575]  Many times they raid the wrong place, or the wrong people, they have, sometimes they don't have a search warrant.
[00:35:22.256 --> 00:35:28.979]  We were just talking before the break about The Guardian, how both people on the left and the right are starting to wake up to this militarization.
[00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:31.381]  This is an article that just came out yesterday.
[00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:31.661]  U.S.
[00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:35.503]  police departments are increasingly militarized, finds a report.
[00:35:35.543 --> 00:35:37.904]  And this is The Guardian talking about an ACLU report.
[00:35:38.544 --> 00:35:52.134]  Interestingly enough, in the bullet point items here, as they say, ACLU cites a soaring use of war zone equipment and tactics, SWAT teams increasingly deployed in local police raids, seven civilians killed and 46 injured in incidents since 2010.
[00:35:52.334 --> 00:35:54.196]  You see how even our language
[00:35:54.736 --> 00:36:04.098]  Is talking about this as if it is a military occupation, as if we've got some kind of asymmetric warfare going on, fighting insurgents in our own country.
[00:36:04.258 --> 00:36:06.339]  Even they talk about civilians.
[00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:10.400]  And this is something that actually crept into the lexicon in America.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.981]  I think I first noticed it in the movies back in the 1970s, where they're talking about civilians.
[00:36:15.021 --> 00:36:18.862]  And they kind of did it as a... I took it as a joke at the time, but it's not a joke.
[00:36:18.962 --> 00:36:21.923]  And so now, here we are, 30 years later, you've got
[00:36:22.563 --> 00:36:27.306]  Publications like the Guardian talking sounding like the John Birch Society.
[00:36:27.346 --> 00:36:30.348]  They were sounding the alarms on this decades ago.
[00:36:30.408 --> 00:36:32.009]  And of course still are sounding the alarm.
[00:36:32.049 --> 00:36:35.932]  So it's good to have the left complaining about the militarization of the police.
[00:36:36.632 --> 00:36:39.114]  And we're just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about this article.
[00:36:39.154 --> 00:36:42.436]  Paul, this is an amazing story here about this baby.
[00:36:42.456 --> 00:36:43.537]  This is about a month ago.
[00:36:43.597 --> 00:36:45.959]  They broke in 18 month old baby.
[00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:48.841]  They threw a flash grenade and landed in the crib.
[00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:52.203]  And they said as they've got the parents taken down.
[00:36:53.283 --> 00:36:55.104]  They told him that they'd taken their baby to the hospital.
[00:36:55.124 --> 00:36:57.824]  They'd only lost a tooth and they wanted him for observation.
[00:36:57.884 --> 00:37:00.505]  When she got there, she found out this is what she said.
[00:37:00.545 --> 00:37:02.025]  His face was blown open.
[00:37:02.585 --> 00:37:06.466]  He had a hole in his chest that left his ribcage visible.
[00:37:07.386 --> 00:37:13.508]  The flashbang grenade had landed in his crib and detonated in his face.
[00:37:13.528 --> 00:37:15.588]  She says, her son is clinging to life.
[00:37:15.808 --> 00:37:18.409]  He's hurting and there's nothing I can do to help him.
[00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:24.758]  These are insane tactics, and they came in first with the war on drugs.
[00:37:24.798 --> 00:37:30.647]  I remember the first SWAT teams were in LA about 30 or 40 years ago, and of course they justified it with the war on drugs.
[00:37:30.727 --> 00:37:34.533]  Now they're justifying it, and that's still predominantly the way it's running, isn't it, Paul?
[00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:47.701]  Yeah, they're justifying it in the case of the militarisation of the police, buying the armoured tanks and so forth, by saying there's an increase in violence, there's an increase in people with more powerful weapons, we need to, you know, get the upper hand.
[00:37:48.122 --> 00:37:54.785]  But if you actually drill down into the figures of violence and gun crime and so forth, they're not going up, they're going down in most cases.
[00:37:55.345 --> 00:38:02.907]  So, you know, you ask what is the real reason behind this tooling up, behind treating Americans as terrorists or drug dealers, as you said.
[00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:09.469]  And, of course, we had the story the other day about the 90-year-old veteran, World War II veteran, who refused to go to hospital.
[00:38:09.529 --> 00:38:10.610]  The police were called.
[00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.431]  They beanbag-grenaded him to death.
[00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:20.996]  So again, another outrageous abuse, but why are they employing military tactics against civilians?
[00:38:21.056 --> 00:38:26.260]  Well, I think it's because they're preparing for domestic dislocation and civil unrest.
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.083]  I mean, we had a story again, this time out of the UK about this, where
[00:38:30.963 --> 00:38:37.408]  Police have set up this entire town just south of London where they've got mock buildings, mock streets, etc.
[00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:44.234]  And they're training to carry on to confront angry mobs in riot control situations.
[00:38:44.714 --> 00:38:47.516]  Of course, we had the London riots back in 2011.
[00:38:48.277 --> 00:38:52.861]  We had massive riots across Europe over the past few years in places like France and Italy.
[00:38:54.813 --> 00:38:57.716]  We're talking about this possibly happening in the United States.
[00:38:57.756 --> 00:39:09.869]  There are several economists who are warning about this based on things like food inflation and a declining economic picture because I don't think this is going to be born out of political grievances.
[00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:12.732]  It's going to be born out of economic grievances.
[00:39:13.112 --> 00:39:19.976]  And it's likely to begin in the poorer areas like Detroit as a result of things like soaring food price inflation.
[00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:29.662]  Because if you remember, just last October we had that EBT card glitch where on their food stamps they suddenly had no limits for a few hours.
[00:39:30.123 --> 00:39:36.146]  It prompted riots in several Walmart stores just for a few hours based on this one glitch.
[00:39:36.547 --> 00:39:39.869]  So you can imagine if that was dragged out over a matter of days and weeks.
[00:39:40.529 --> 00:39:51.918]  Which is why people like Martin Armstrong, who predicted the 1987 economic collapse, is talking about riots in the poorer areas of America potentially as soon as next year.
[00:39:52.278 --> 00:39:56.041]  And he actually wrote a good article entitled, Will Society Ever Wake Up?
[00:39:56.741 --> 00:40:03.227]  He makes the point that, quote, the more a society relies upon government, the greater the damage to its economic potential.
[00:40:03.748 --> 00:40:06.771]  It requires a control, alt, delete, reboot.
[00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:16.400]  So he's talking about how dependency fosters instability and ultimately revolution when the system collapses under its own weight.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:42.891]  So, you know, when governments become too corrupt to impose this centralised Marxist planning that they promise will be the land of milk and honey for the poorer people, it collapses because the underclass don't realise that it's a pack of lies until it's too late, which is why they're now talking about potential unrest in 2015, which is why now the police are becoming more militarised in preparation
[00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:44.292]  for this situation.
[00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:49.278]  One more quote which I've got in the article today about the British police preparing for riots.
[00:40:50.464 --> 00:40:51.184]  Is that the U.S.
[00:40:51.244 --> 00:40:59.826]  Army War College from a white paper from 2008 called, Known Unknowns Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defense Strategy Development.
[00:41:00.426 --> 00:41:15.829]  And it warned that, quote, violent strategic dislocation inside the United States could be provoked by, quote, unforeseen economic collapse, purposeful domestic resistance, pervasive public health emergencies or loss of functioning political and legal order.
[00:41:16.269 --> 00:41:18.510]  It predicted widespread civil violence.
[00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:28.014]  So as far back as six years ago, the US Army War College was preparing for this civil unrest, this domestic disorder in America.
[00:41:28.294 --> 00:41:31.615]  And I think it's going to arise out of a worsening economic picture.
[00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:37.118]  Yes, and other documents that we've seen from them, they also talk about conditions
[00:41:38.198 --> 00:41:38.979]  Uh, they could bring this on.
[00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:43.541]  And one of the ones I mentioned was a collapse of the border, an uncontrolled immigration surge.
[00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:45.302]  And of course, they're the ones who are doing it.
[00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:50.424]  I look at this and it's, we see a massive amount of money that's being made.
[00:41:50.464 --> 00:41:58.408]  And of course, in the past, it's the military-industrial complex that I believe has fundamentally been behind all these incessant wars we've had all over the world.
[00:41:58.968 --> 00:42:00.189]  Now they're bringing that home.
[00:42:00.709 --> 00:42:09.855]  Because they found a new profit center where they can sell these police state, surveillance state weapons and tools to local police departments.
[00:42:10.455 --> 00:42:12.096]  And it's a very, very dangerous thing.
[00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:14.798]  You know, you were talking about the stability and security.
[00:42:14.918 --> 00:42:24.264]  One of the quotes that I saw when we were doing research on the Asymmetric Warfare Center before we went out there and looked at that facility that they're building to train with,
[00:42:24.884 --> 00:42:38.191]  One of the things that they said was, the way that you can identify a legitimate or an illegitimate regime, and of course they were talking about the Middle East, was how much security do they need to have in order to get stability.
[00:42:39.172 --> 00:42:45.075]  Now if you use that same yardstick on America, what does that tell you about the legitimacy of our regime?
[00:42:46.235 --> 00:42:55.269]  They use a lot of security and they don't see what they're doing and what they're going to be doing as very legitimate because they really are stepping this up now.
[00:42:57.043 --> 00:42:59.864]  Exactly, and that's why they're building these fake cities.
[00:42:59.924 --> 00:43:04.247]  I mean, it was 96 million dollars to build this fake city in Virginia.
[00:43:05.327 --> 00:43:09.529]  They had a mosque, but they also had a Christian church, remember, a chapel.
[00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:14.311]  You know, all the signs were in English, they had the subway, all the signs there were in English.
[00:43:14.351 --> 00:43:16.212]  So, again, it's dual use.
[00:43:16.252 --> 00:43:21.535]  Yes, it's going to be used to train troops who are going abroad and occupying foreign cities, but when it's
[00:43:21.755 --> 00:43:32.786]  When it's all in English and when, of course, as Alex has documented, these urban warfare training drills, they're actually bringing in foreign troops to train them to deal with the American citizens.
[00:43:32.806 --> 00:43:37.190]  They had gun confiscation programs aimed at American citizens in those programs.
[00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:40.313]  Then, you know, it's also going to be domestic.
[00:43:41.314 --> 00:43:43.256]  You know, like Hurricane Katrina.
[00:43:43.576 --> 00:43:44.216]  Yeah.
[00:43:44.296 --> 00:43:51.940]  Even the people who weren't in the line of it, who weren't affected by it, had their guns confiscated after an emergency.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.202]  So the blueprint is already there to do so again in the future in America.
[00:43:56.563 --> 00:43:56.783]  Yes.
[00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:59.284]  You're talking about how Americanized it was.
[00:43:59.324 --> 00:44:02.766]  I mean, Biggs and I walked through the streets of that town.
[00:44:03.206 --> 00:44:06.147]  It was really an eerie experience to walk through this town.
[00:44:06.828 --> 00:44:10.249]  Everything was there, fully functional from the outside.
[00:44:10.269 --> 00:44:13.071]  When you go inside the buildings, this unfinished cinder block,
[00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:15.472]  No, but everything on the outside was completely finished.
[00:44:15.932 --> 00:44:23.916]  And what was really eerie, I think, to me, was the fact that the stop lights are still cycling, you know, as you're going through it.
[00:44:23.956 --> 00:44:29.218]  I mean, it was like a city that had just had some kind of a biological attack and everyone was gone.
[00:44:29.798 --> 00:44:39.403]  And I thought, you know, that's something that's very different because always in the past when they've trained about urban warfare, it's always been from the scenario that they came in first with an airstrike.
[00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:51.130]  And so they're essentially going through bombed out shells of buildings and kind of a desert scenario where they're already, you've had airstrikes take out the city and they're just going in for an occupation, for a cleanup.
[00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:56.436]  But this is very different, because here, they're going into buildings that are completely intact.
[00:44:56.456 --> 00:44:58.458]  I mean, we stood at the corner of 1st and Main.
[00:44:58.498 --> 00:44:59.780]  I took Biggs' picture there.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.082]  I mean, it was bizarre.
[00:45:01.542 --> 00:45:04.225]  And everything in those buildings is completely intact.
[00:45:04.245 --> 00:45:11.194]  And you talk about being Americanized, the only thing there that wasn't like small-town rural America or a city was that mosque.
[00:45:11.334 --> 00:45:17.440]  They put it up on the side so if anybody that's not driving into the place, that was about the main thing that you saw.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:24.686]  So if anybody just drives around the perimeter of it instead of going into it, what they see is a mosque and it's like, oh yeah, they're just training for the Muslims.
[00:45:24.726 --> 00:45:26.248]  They're not training for the Muslims.
[00:45:26.268 --> 00:45:36.037]  They're training for the Americans, for the conservatives, for the libertarians, for the people that, as they've pointed out in scenario after scenario, are concerned about government overreach.
[00:45:38.172 --> 00:45:38.592]  Exactly.
[00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:41.513]  I mean, we've had document after document.
[00:45:41.533 --> 00:45:44.293]  We've also had things like, you know, the paper targets.
[00:45:44.733 --> 00:45:45.313]  What were they called?
[00:45:45.373 --> 00:45:46.433]  No Hesitation.
[00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:48.574]  And it was kids in playgrounds.
[00:45:48.634 --> 00:45:49.854]  It was pregnant mothers.
[00:45:50.394 --> 00:45:52.474]  And these were being sold to police departments.
[00:45:52.514 --> 00:45:55.095]  They were being sold to the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:45:55.495 --> 00:46:00.056]  So we know repeated examples where they're targeting the American people domestically.
[00:46:00.496 --> 00:46:01.276]  It's dual use.
[00:46:01.316 --> 00:46:06.457]  And as I said, I think it's because they know the veneer of civilization is very thin.
[00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.137]  They know that if
[00:46:07.637 --> 00:46:13.141]  You know, the food supply gets cut off going into New York for 10 days, then there will be absolute bedlam.
[00:46:13.922 --> 00:46:17.745]  They know that this fiat money system is collapsing.
[00:46:18.045 --> 00:46:21.268]  People are starting to notice their quality of life is declining.
[00:46:21.588 --> 00:46:25.932]  People, households, are having to work two, three, or four jobs just to maintain their standard of living.
[00:46:26.452 --> 00:46:30.555]  And then you've got, you know, like the GDP figures today are completely atrocious.
[00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:32.957]  The economy seems to be back on the slide again.
[00:46:33.378 --> 00:46:34.999]  So this is what they're preparing for.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:45.590]  What you're referring to there, Paul, is the Commerce Department said today that the gross domestic product fell 2.9% annual rate instead of the 1% that it reported last month.
[00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:46.652]  They always do that, don't they?
[00:46:46.692 --> 00:46:51.978]  They always come out with something that looks better than it really is and then revise it down the next
[00:46:52.498 --> 00:46:52.919]  Thank you.
[00:47:07.816 --> 00:47:22.182]  Yeah, and it's, you know, these are the worst figures in five years, and again, I think you could connect it to the point I made earlier about dependency on government and all those Obama quotes you played as we were coming in from the break, because, you know, the regulations aren't getting any lighter.
[00:47:22.682 --> 00:47:25.103]  It's becoming harder and harder to start your own business.
[00:47:25.923 --> 00:47:32.126]  People are being cracked down on in a manner of different ways, so, I mean, that's how you sack an economy, and that's
[00:47:32.526 --> 00:47:34.408]  That's the way the United States is going.
[00:47:34.468 --> 00:47:38.651]  Unfortunately, at the moment, more government control, more bureaucracy, more regulation.
[00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:41.113]  You look at what happens to countries that do that.
[00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:42.054]  I mean, look at France.
[00:47:42.114 --> 00:47:51.562]  It's in a complete mess because of a socialist government that's completely oppressed and suffocated private free enterprise and entrepreneurship.
[00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:55.185]  So I think that's the danger in America, that it could well go that way.
[00:47:55.225 --> 00:47:57.327]  And that's why they're preparing for this unrest.
[00:47:57.907 --> 00:48:01.108]  You know, one of the things, Paul, is the story that came out on Reuters today.
[00:48:01.168 --> 00:48:07.750]  The picture that's at the very top of it is a picture of a Ford manufacturing assembly line.
[00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.091]  And as I'm looking at this picture, put this up on the screen, guys.
[00:48:11.131 --> 00:48:11.751]  This is the U.S.
[00:48:11.791 --> 00:48:14.912]  economy contracts sharply, consumer spending revised down.
[00:48:15.512 --> 00:48:22.114]  As I look at this picture that's up on the screen, there's not a person at all in this picture.
[00:48:22.134 --> 00:48:24.135]  It's nothing but a sea of robots.
[00:48:24.855 --> 00:48:34.209]  And it was just last week at the Margaret Thatcher Liberty Conference in the UK, Paul, that David Petraeus was talking about how, you know, what comes after America?
[00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:38.415]  Well, North America, NAFTA, is what comes after that.
[00:48:38.455 --> 00:48:39.717]  And he was talking about how
[00:48:40.498 --> 00:48:44.362]  How are they going to deal with the people who don't have their jobs anymore?
[00:48:44.382 --> 00:48:49.287]  He says, instead of having an assembly line where we've got 100 workers, now we're going to have 2 workers and 100 robots.
[00:48:49.347 --> 00:48:50.448]  So what do we do with those people?
[00:48:50.488 --> 00:48:53.531]  His answer was, well, we educate them for the new economy.
[00:48:53.591 --> 00:48:58.796]  I think what they do is, I don't think that there's going to be jobs for them in the new economy.
[00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:00.798]  I think they're looking at ways to get rid of them.
[00:49:01.058 --> 00:49:16.211]  So when we look at this and you say, if they've got this kind of a near-term horizon where they're going to have robots replacing people in factories, robots replacing people in service jobs and transportation jobs, why are they bringing in so many workers?
[00:49:16.291 --> 00:49:18.714]  Well, that's not what it's about at all, I don't think.
[00:49:18.774 --> 00:49:21.156]  I mean, we had Jeff Sessions, a senator,
[00:49:21.736 --> 00:49:22.697]  That's Obama's army, I think.
[00:49:46.036 --> 00:50:00.952]  Exactly, and tying into that, we were contacted today by a University of California professor, Darrell Y. Hamamoto, and he's about to embark on a big campaign speaking out against this influx of illegal immigrants.
[00:50:01.633 --> 00:50:10.039]  He came out with some quite astounding statements given his position as a professor at obviously what is a very liberal university.
[00:50:10.379 --> 00:50:23.149]  He's already been attacked, he's already been harassed by the university for coming out with these statements and after the break we can get into that because that's an Infowars exclusive and he's going to be coming on the show later this week.
[00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:24.110]  Well that'd be great.
[00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:32.337]  Yeah, it's an amazing scenario that's unfolding before us, and when we listen to people like David Petraeus, they understand.
[00:50:32.377 --> 00:50:34.399]  He says, hey, we're 20 years into NAFTA.
[00:50:34.479 --> 00:50:45.329]  In other words, Americans have not really understood how our economy has been fundamentally transformed, how our sovereignty has been taken away in the eyes of the elite.
[00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:49.331]  And so that's why Americans are looking at this and saying, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:50:49.411 --> 00:50:50.991]  This is something that Obama's doing.
[00:50:51.031 --> 00:50:52.431]  It's not just Obama.
[00:50:52.531 --> 00:50:54.332]  I wish it were just Obama.
[00:50:54.352 --> 00:50:57.672]  It would be much easier to deal with if it was just one person.
[00:50:57.953 --> 00:50:58.973]  This is both parties.
[00:50:59.353 --> 00:51:02.473]  This has been going on for decades and it's only getting worse.
[00:51:02.533 --> 00:51:08.055]  This is where it's really being brought in at this point where they're opening the borders and collapsing the economy.
[00:51:08.095 --> 00:51:09.755]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.

[00:52:08.943 --> 00:52:11.526]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.786 --> 00:52:16.651]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:24.799]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:29.343]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:52:29.543 --> 00:52:33.367]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.507 --> 00:52:39.231]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:42.253]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.633 --> 00:52:47.837]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:47.997 --> 00:52:56.122]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:56.182 --> 00:52:56.362]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:53:03.387 --> 00:53:03.707]  We're good.
[00:53:21.578 --> 00:53:21.978]  We're good to go.
[00:53:45.017 --> 00:53:45.297]  We're good.
[00:54:17.347 --> 00:54:21.089]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a maximum alert.
[00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:36.556]  Last week we were contacted by Army personnel, by MPs, and then by Air Force MPs about United Nations advertisement solicitations that were being hung up in the barracks.
[00:54:37.196 --> 00:54:37.256]  To
[00:54:54.278 --> 00:54:58.021]  For during a collapse, gun confiscation to stabilize things.
[00:54:58.381 --> 00:55:02.684]  And the RAND Corporation came up with a plan 20 years ago for this National Stability Police Force.
[00:55:03.024 --> 00:55:04.405]  This is what the UN does worldwide.
[00:55:04.666 --> 00:55:05.907]  They've taken everybody else's guns.
[00:55:06.047 --> 00:55:06.527]  You understand?
[00:55:06.767 --> 00:55:07.448]  This is what they do.
[00:55:08.188 --> 00:55:09.729]  And it's in their own documents, they want it.
[00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:10.830]  Now it's broken.
[00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:16.855]  Now we were waiting on the report, not to confirm it, but to get undercover information, which we're getting right now.
[00:55:17.815 --> 00:55:27.125]  And it shows how great the alternative media is that DrudgeReport.com already had it last night that the you know what they hit the fan plan with Max Labo broke it.
[00:55:27.366 --> 00:55:27.826]  It's awesome.
[00:55:28.667 --> 00:55:34.533]  We are ferreting out even more confirming the specifics but they admit in their own career plan right here.
[00:55:35.512 --> 00:55:39.774]  Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration officer.
[00:55:39.834 --> 00:55:43.056]  These are commanders to carry this out and it gets into all of it.
[00:55:43.476 --> 00:55:52.041]  Small arms disarmament, their mission, they've got to have serious command from third world takeover operations that they've done in other countries.
[00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:56.783]  Here's the article on Infowars.com mirrored Max Slavo and he goes through it all.
[00:55:57.203 --> 00:56:00.907]  I've got Paul Watson doing a more detailed article showing the whole history of it.
[00:56:18.064 --> 00:56:22.788]  Click Google News, ladies and gentlemen, and you will see this literally everywhere.
[00:56:23.269 --> 00:56:30.635]  The armored vehicles, the drones, the tanks, the preparations, using the border collapse that's just begun like a tsunami.
[00:56:30.995 --> 00:56:33.137]  Sheriffs have called it like Katrina every day.
[00:56:33.878 --> 00:56:37.801]  To bring down those areas and then to basically bring in civil emergency or martial law.
[00:56:38.642 --> 00:56:39.843]  Food prices are doubling.
[00:56:40.303 --> 00:56:43.204]  Everything is starting to get more and more hardcore worldwide and here.
[00:56:43.564 --> 00:56:47.446]  This is the globalist collapse, Cloward and Piven, problem, reaction, solution.
[00:56:47.646 --> 00:56:53.169]  But getting this out and exposing that they're preparing for it will cause a public debate and they will fail.
[00:56:53.509 --> 00:57:02.093]  That's why they want to deny the NSA spying and deny all the things they're doing and deny their funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS because then there can't be a debate about it.
[00:57:02.273 --> 00:57:03.354]  We're going to force the debate.
[00:57:03.434 --> 00:57:04.535]  We are the real media.
[00:57:04.795 --> 00:57:07.117]  We are the true media, not the state-run media.
[00:57:07.397 --> 00:57:10.019]  And this stuff is getting out regardless of what happens to InfoWars.
[00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:14.682]  There's Drudge and so many other great outfits out there that know the truth and care about freedom.
[00:57:15.062 --> 00:57:18.044]  And great job to Mac getting this out.
[00:57:18.084 --> 00:57:22.427]  Again, we've got a big story on this with video audio we're working on right now.
[00:57:22.808 --> 00:57:24.529]  It'll all be covered on the radio today, 11 a.m.
[00:57:24.649 --> 00:57:25.089]  to 2 p.m.
[00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:26.751]  InfoWars.com.
[00:57:27.011 --> 00:57:29.853]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:57:31.786 --> 00:57:35.891]  This report is up on Alex's YouTube channel, the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:41.097]  You can see that in full and we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson as soon as we come back about this.
[00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:49.206]  The article is United Nations seeks U.S.-based disarmament, demobilization and reintegration specialists.
[00:57:49.887 --> 00:57:57.433]  And this is something that, as Alex pointed out, we were told that they're putting up job offerings and now we see the actual posting.
[00:57:57.453 --> 00:58:02.537]  And the interesting thing about this is if you look at it, it says the duty station is New York.
[00:58:03.258 --> 00:58:04.259]  Paul, what do you think about that?
[00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:22.270]  I think, although it's listed as New York, if you go on the UN's website, they talk about this DDR program, Disarmament Demobilization Reintegration, and it's currently active in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast and Haiti.
[00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:28.774]  So, whereas it says it's based in New York, I think that's just where they're being trained and the actual programs are based in Africa.
[00:58:29.234 --> 00:58:32.976]  But as Alex has said, you know, again, these programs are dual use.
[00:58:33.616 --> 00:58:42.562]  We had Hillary Clinton last week talking about how supporting the Second Amendment is an opinion that terrorizes America and you shouldn't be allowed to have it.
[00:58:42.582 --> 00:58:45.724]  We had Obama earlier this month talking about the U.S.
[00:58:45.764 --> 00:58:46.744]  mimicking Australia.
[00:58:46.804 --> 00:58:48.105]  Absolutely, we're going to be right back.
[00:58:48.245 --> 00:58:48.786]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:58:50.006 --> 00:58:53.408]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:00.106 --> 00:59:01.847]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:59:02.388 --> 00:59:09.352]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:59:09.813 --> 00:59:20.239]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:29.866]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:59:30.606 --> 00:59:34.008]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:59:34.669 --> 00:59:38.091]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:59:38.431 --> 00:59:39.992]  Experience the new formula.
[00:59:40.492 --> 00:59:42.453]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:59:43.054 --> 00:59:43.994]  Shield your family.
[00:59:44.395 --> 00:59:45.775]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:00:16.793 --> 01:00:17.814]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.554 --> 01:00:19.675]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:21.116]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:22.797]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.437 --> 01:00:27.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.703]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.487 --> 01:00:36.748]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:40.770]  I'm David Knight, and joining me from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:43.832]  We've just been talking about this article and report that Alex put up.
[01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:50.815]  United Nations seeks U.S.-based disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration specialists.
[01:00:51.316 --> 01:00:57.039]  And of course, Paul, in context, we know that in 2012, as it points out in the article by Max Slavo,
[01:00:57.879 --> 01:01:04.766]  Obama, as well as Hillary Clinton, signed an agreement, the Small Arms Treaty.
[01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:12.995]  We've also seen a similar thing happen with the UN Arms Trade Treaty, where they try to stop the flow of arms across the border.
[01:01:13.756 --> 01:01:18.821]  I was there when they were trying to push that through in, let's see, that was July of 2012.
[01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:27.825]  And they had just had the Fast and Furious arms smuggling thing blow up in their faces.
[01:01:28.045 --> 01:01:29.566]  I believe that they had set that up.
[01:01:29.626 --> 01:01:32.747]  As the New York Times pointed out, that was a false flag attack.
[01:01:33.247 --> 01:01:36.428]  That was a false flag attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:45.470]  And they were trying to make a case that was going to peak right about that time that we had this massive problem of guns flowing across the border into Mexico.
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.151]  So, to control that,
[01:01:47.651 --> 01:01:48.092]  We need to
[01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:09.111]  Some more Democrat seats.
[01:02:09.531 --> 01:02:14.273]  They said we're going to revisit this in the spring and when they came back in the spring they finally did pass it as a body.
[01:02:14.673 --> 01:02:21.476]  Kerry said that Secretary of State Kerry said that he wanted to go with that but still it hasn't gone through.
[01:02:21.496 --> 01:02:29.380]  The Senate has not ratified that fortunately and there's a lot of people who question legally whether a treaty can supersede the Constitution.
[01:02:30.276 --> 01:02:35.520]  So I don't know, but it certainly looks like the UN is spearheading this in multiple areas.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:42.426]  Not just the trading of arms, the movement of arms across borders, but also trying to confiscate arms within a country.
[01:02:42.446 --> 01:02:45.268]  And as you pointed out, even though this is in New York...
[01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:56.776]  You believe that this is for disarmament, demobilization, reintegration abroad, but there's nothing that I've seen that says that the UN wants to limit it just to being abroad.
[01:02:56.816 --> 01:03:01.859]  I think they would certainly love to see that happen in the United States as they've been working for a long time.
[01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:08.829]  Well, I mean, I don't think the majority of police in America will want to get involved in mass gun confiscation.
[01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:10.410]  I mean, that would be a total bloodbath.
[01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:13.653]  In fact, I think we've seen polls that evidence that in the past.
[01:03:13.693 --> 01:03:21.201]  So, if they really wanted to do it, and it would be complete stupidity, but they would need some kind of foreign mercenary troops to do it.
[01:03:21.281 --> 01:03:26.446]  So, you know, I think that's why people remain concerned about the UN being involved in gun confiscation.
[01:03:27.226 --> 01:03:40.275]  One other thing that I wanted to touch on was this University of California professor Hamamoto contacted us and he's warning about the illegal immigration influx being about quote the re-education of society.
[01:03:40.996 --> 01:03:41.856]  He said that the
[01:03:43.017 --> 01:03:59.247]  It's part of a deliberate plot, quote, to exclude the American middle class from a UC education center and create a new demographic of largely immigrant or foreign national undergraduate population that can be re-educated from the ground up and controlled much more readily.
[01:03:59.787 --> 01:04:06.071]  So this is what we've been talking about for years, is that this illegal immigration push is not necessarily about
[01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:15.020]  You know, creating jobs for people or amnesty in terms of humanitarian aid like we now see with the Department of Homeland Security paying for them to be brought in.
[01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:19.846]  But it's about fundamentally shifting the foundation of society.
[01:04:19.866 --> 01:04:23.970]  It's about creating a voting bloc and it's about the re-education of society.
[01:04:25.131 --> 01:04:25.972]  Destroying that
[01:04:26.832 --> 01:04:39.198]  Rugged individualism, which defines America, creating a whole class, an underclass, that knows no rights, has no history of freedom or liberty, and can easily be manipulated into following the dictates of the state.
[01:04:39.578 --> 01:04:49.083]  So for a professor from a liberal university, UC Davis, California, to come out with these quotes is quite a story, and he's coming out to us exclusively.
[01:04:49.503 --> 01:04:55.146]  So we hope to get him on the show probably next week, but this article is going up after the show ends today.
[01:04:55.806 --> 01:04:56.486]  That's very true.
[01:04:56.947 --> 01:04:58.127]  Yes, thank you for joining us.
[01:04:58.227 --> 01:04:59.528]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:04:59.628 --> 01:05:02.949]  I believe, Paul, that that's precisely what's behind this.
[01:05:03.009 --> 01:05:06.970]  I think there's a tie with the FEMA Youth Corps with what he said he wanted to have.
[01:05:07.391 --> 01:05:09.151]  That's what we're going to be talking about right after the break.
[01:05:09.191 --> 01:05:09.711]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.552 --> 01:05:15.794]  In the near future... When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball...
[01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:17.415]  Security alert.
[01:05:17.615 --> 01:05:19.356]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:20.237]  Analysis.
[01:05:20.497 --> 01:05:23.179]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[01:05:23.199 --> 01:05:28.163]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:05:28.203 --> 01:05:29.164]  Prime Directive.
[01:05:29.244 --> 01:05:30.625]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:05:30.785 --> 01:05:33.567]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:36.729]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:39.111]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:05:39.171 --> 01:05:40.692]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:05:40.712 --> 01:05:43.034]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:05:43.534 --> 01:05:45.195]  They are never going to stop.
[01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:53.360]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:03.046]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:05.527]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:05.547 --> 01:06:06.288]  You can feel it.
[01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:13.965]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:06:14.205 --> 01:06:17.307]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:06:17.548 --> 01:06:19.389]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:06:19.649 --> 01:06:21.591]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.272]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:06:23.452 --> 01:06:26.494]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:06:26.795 --> 01:06:28.116]  If so, consider this.
[01:06:28.376 --> 01:06:37.303]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:06:37.643 --> 01:06:43.672]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:06:44.032 --> 01:06:45.675]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:46.075 --> 01:06:53.747]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.
[01:06:54.127 --> 01:07:04.276]  Get your bottle of Super Female Vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.

[01:07:07.298 --> 01:07:08.339]  Live life healthy.
[01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:13.003]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:07:13.043 --> 01:07:17.107]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:20.809]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:23.930]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:31.453]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:07:31.653 --> 01:07:35.275]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:07:35.495 --> 01:07:39.817]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:07:39.977 --> 01:07:45.900]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:49.741]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:52.423]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:07:52.623 --> 01:07:53.963]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:07:54.123 --> 01:07:55.364]  It's time to take action.
[01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:57.185]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:08:12.334 --> 01:08:18.359]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.959 --> 01:08:21.942]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:31.972]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:39.155]  I'm David Knight here in Austin and we were just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about a couple of articles that have gone up in the last yesterday and today.
[01:08:39.175 --> 01:08:45.777]  The one yesterday about the SWAT team raid in Florida against the lady where she was stripped naked.
[01:08:45.837 --> 01:08:50.379]  They have still not received any information as to why they were SWAT teamed.
[01:08:50.599 --> 01:08:53.080]  And then of course another article about the British
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:09:01.823]  Now having their own fake towns to prepare against attacks and riots from their own citizens, as we've seen multiple places here in the United States.
[01:09:01.863 --> 01:09:09.266]  Of course, Fort AP Hill has the asymmetric warfare center that Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and I went through and filmed.
[01:09:09.786 --> 01:09:11.507]  A very chilling experience.
[01:09:11.527 --> 01:09:15.929]  And again, at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, the Marines have another facility.
[01:09:16.489 --> 01:09:21.636]  That one is really kind of targeted more towards rural and suburban America.
[01:09:21.676 --> 01:09:23.779]  They have neighborhoods, they have farms.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.542]  Both of these look like Americana.
[01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:32.990]  The only thing that you would not know, typically associate with a small rural town, was a very large mosque.
[01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:34.052]  And as I point out, we were
[01:09:34.532 --> 01:09:35.033]  We're good to go.
[01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:55.732]  We're good to go.
[01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:19.547]  Just before the top of the hour, as Alex Jones pointed out, we see this massive preparation over and over again for economic collapse.
[01:10:19.567 --> 01:10:24.749]  And of course, one of the reasons that they have given for economic collapse is a collapse of the borders.
[01:10:25.069 --> 01:10:26.370]  That is being done now.
[01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:27.791]  That is being done.
[01:10:27.851 --> 01:10:29.352]  The borders are being opened up.
[01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.454]  And collapsed by Homeland Security.
[01:10:32.874 --> 01:10:43.802]  The same people who are militarizing our police, pushing us into a police state, equipping our police with equipment that is typically used in counterinsurgency wars abroad.
[01:10:44.483 --> 01:10:50.627]  Now, in the next hour, we're going to be talking to Cheryl Chumley about her book, Police State USA.
[01:10:50.727 --> 01:10:55.931]  She says it's a layman's guide to the latest in constitutional hits that this nation has taken.
[01:10:56.471 --> 01:11:07.255]  She uses recent examples from across the country to illustrate how technology environmentalist businesses and politicians are stripping the American people of their God-given rights.
[01:11:07.275 --> 01:11:08.536]  So I'm anxious to talk to her.
[01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:13.058]  This is something that is, in a good way, starting to explode.
[01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:18.000]  Both people on the left and the right are starting to understand where this is headed.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.863]  For the longest time, you only heard people like the John Birch Society 30 years ago talking about this.
[01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:28.154]  Alex Jones has been talking about this for decades.
[01:11:28.234 --> 01:11:37.826]  Now we've got not just conservatives and libertarians talking about it, but now you've got the ACLU and you've got the Guardian talking about the militarization of the police.
[01:11:37.846 --> 01:11:40.610]  That's an article that just came out today in the Guardian.
[01:11:41.391 --> 01:11:41.831]  Hopefully!
[01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:45.353]  People can stand back and see where this is going.
[01:11:45.393 --> 01:11:47.453]  This is not a left-right issue.
[01:11:48.133 --> 01:11:53.755]  And many times, as she's pointing out, this is a country where government is replacing God.
[01:11:53.775 --> 01:12:07.838]  You know, I see so many times that people who are conservatives would push back in favor of a lot of these draconian techniques and police state techniques that are being used because they were being done as part of the war on drugs.
[01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:13.285]  See, government's job is not to save people's souls.
[01:12:13.565 --> 01:12:16.886]  And that's essentially what you're talking about when you're talking about addiction.
[01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.067]  You're talking about a medical issue.
[01:12:19.547 --> 01:12:22.568]  You're talking about a spiritual issue, a psychological issue.
[01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:24.909]  That is not government's job.
[01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:30.191]  As we've said over and over again, you know, the people who have only a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:36.153]  If you think that everything needs to be done by government, then you're going to wind up, by definition,
[01:12:36.673 --> 01:12:37.433]  With a police state.
[01:12:37.773 --> 01:12:41.554]  You're going to wind up trying to use government force to solve every problem.
[01:12:41.994 --> 01:12:44.335]  That's not the way every problem is solved.
[01:12:44.355 --> 01:12:49.056]  And there's a very sad story out of Seattle, Washington.
[01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:49.956]  Eric Holder is there.
[01:12:49.976 --> 01:12:59.099]  They just had a massive crackdown on some people, five individuals, who were cracked down for medical marijuana, which is legal in the state of Washington.
[01:12:59.519 --> 01:13:03.040]  And yet the federal government says those laws don't apply here.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.582]  Is that the state of where we are?
[01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:08.324]  Is that where people on the left want us to be?
[01:13:08.364 --> 01:13:09.665]  Is that where people on the right want us to be?
[01:13:09.705 --> 01:13:19.273]  Do we want to pursue this insane prohibition policy so much so that we will throw in jail people who use these things for medical purposes?
[01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.411]  Is that why we're doing this?
[01:13:21.612 --> 01:13:23.895]  Are we doing that to protect the big pharmaceutical companies?
[01:13:24.215 --> 01:13:27.860]  Are we doing it to protect the CIA's drug-running operations out of Afghanistan?
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:37.151]  Because you know, it had fallen to 10% of the world's heroin supply, then after we occupied it, it's back up to like 90% of the world's heroin supply in Afghanistan.
[01:13:38.069 --> 01:13:48.794]  We saw what was happening with the Iran-Contra affair, where the Republicans were running drugs and starting the crack cocaine addiction craze in California in order to fund their secret wars.
[01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:51.416]  This is something we need to all wake up.
[01:13:51.496 --> 01:13:55.477]  It's not a Republican versus Democrat, a left versus right thing.
[01:13:55.578 --> 01:13:58.799]  This is something we all need to wake up to and see where this is headed.
[01:13:58.839 --> 01:14:02.641]  Because now, it's not just the war on drugs, it's the war on terror.
[01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:05.042]  That's how they're justifying this police state.
[01:14:05.062 --> 01:14:06.383]  We've had some good news today.
[01:14:06.963 --> 01:14:12.767]  We've had a Supreme Court come out and say that the police may not search smartphones without a warrant.
[01:14:13.527 --> 01:14:21.053]  That's very important because we've seen that happening over and over again, but it leaves some glaring inconsistencies, of course, in our legal standing.
[01:14:21.073 --> 01:14:24.335]  Of course, the NSA is still going through our smartphones without warrants.
[01:14:24.355 --> 01:14:26.416]  They're going through our computers without warrants.
[01:14:26.656 --> 01:14:29.578]  They're looking at everything that we're doing without warrants.
[01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:32.920]  And so, I'm glad to see that this was a unanimous decision.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.281]  That's pretty amazing.
[01:14:34.341 --> 01:14:36.403]  It's very rare that they have a unanimous decision.
[01:14:37.484 --> 01:14:50.173]  But they supported the Fourth Amendment to say that the government needs to have a search warrant in order to go look at our personal effects, our person, our property, our house.
[01:14:50.994 --> 01:14:56.157]  That's something that needs to be applied to these violent SWAT team actions that are going on out there.
[01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:59.220]  And we also had another Supreme Court case that just came up.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.801]  Actually, it's not a Supreme Court case.
[01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:03.363]  This was a state federal case where
[01:15:04.224 --> 01:15:08.709]  A federal court has struck down a no-fly list as unconstitutional.
[01:15:08.749 --> 01:15:15.616]  One of the first stories when I came to InfoWars was about a man, Wade Hicks, who got stuck trying to get to Japan.
[01:15:15.656 --> 01:15:21.463]  He was taken off of an army plane going to visit his wife who was in the military in Japan.
[01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:25.025]  He was taken off the plane just before it left in Hawaii.
[01:15:25.085 --> 01:15:26.366]  It stopped there for refueling.
[01:15:26.767 --> 01:15:29.529]  He was given no explanation as to why he was on a no-fly list.
[01:15:29.549 --> 01:15:31.130]  He had been vetted by the FBI.
[01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:32.171]  He had been vetted by TSA.
[01:15:33.732 --> 01:15:37.275]  He had been given passes to work as a transportation worker.
[01:15:37.955 --> 01:15:40.317]  Just prior to his trip, and yet they pulled him off.
[01:15:40.337 --> 01:15:42.659]  They would not tell him why he was on a no-fly list.
[01:15:42.699 --> 01:15:49.705]  Eventually he got back with pressure from the military, and still never heard as to why he was put on this no-fly list.
[01:15:49.725 --> 01:15:51.406]  See, that's the problem that we have.
[01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:56.770]  That's what everybody should be concerned about, whether they're Republican or Democrat, left or right.
[01:15:57.311 --> 01:16:00.794]  The idea that we have a government that can operate in secret.
[01:16:01.294 --> 01:16:03.736]  This is not like a police state.
[01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:05.638]  This is a police state.
[01:16:06.178 --> 01:16:10.221]  This is something out of Kafka, out of East Germany, out of the Stasi.
[01:16:10.841 --> 01:16:20.829]  You cannot have a situation where you have secret warrants going out after people, and you're not allowed to know if you're on the list, or why you're on the list, or if you ever get off the list.
[01:16:20.849 --> 01:16:23.871]  Well, this is a story that's up on InfoWars today from Curt Nemo.
[01:16:24.231 --> 01:16:27.653]  Federal court strikes down no-fly list as unconstitutional.
[01:16:27.673 --> 01:16:31.476]  The freedom to travel is considered an unenumerated natural right.
[01:16:31.516 --> 01:16:31.876]  That's right.
[01:16:32.777 --> 01:16:37.880]  The 9th Amendment says, the 10th Amendment says, hey, if we left something out, we still have those rights.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.104]  And just because it's not there specifically, doesn't mean that we don't possess that right.
[01:16:43.164 --> 01:16:45.165]  Now this is a federal court in Portland, Oregon.
[01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:50.288]  They said that the no-fly list is unconstitutional because it violates a right to due process.
[01:16:50.808 --> 01:16:51.249]  Exactly.
[01:16:52.076 --> 01:16:58.024]  But they're modifying our Constitution, they say, by using this secret FISA court.
[01:16:58.045 --> 01:17:06.196]  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1970s was put in place to stop precisely the type of thing that they're using it for.
[01:17:07.352 --> 01:17:09.272]  That's the way the government gets around these things.
[01:17:09.613 --> 01:17:14.614]  They had the church committee hearings where they were talking about how the CIA was getting to be out of control.
[01:17:14.914 --> 01:17:17.694]  They pointed out how it was out of control in so many different areas.
[01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:24.196]  They were very concerned that the CIA and the federal government in general was going to start spying on Americans.
[01:17:24.496 --> 01:17:33.858]  So they created this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to say you cannot spy on Americans without going before this court and getting a warrant and everything and yet
[01:17:34.338 --> 01:17:39.222]  What they're doing is they're using that very court, that secretive court, which is not a court at all.
[01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:41.603]  Because in a court, you have openness.
[01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:44.726]  In a court, you have presumption of innocence before you're proven guilty.
[01:17:45.046 --> 01:17:48.108]  In a court, you have an adversarial relationship.
[01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:56.655]  So you're not only told that you're being scrutinized or tried in abstentia, which is what they're doing, secretly trying people in abstentia.
[01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:59.055]  You have an advocate there in that court.
[01:17:59.095 --> 01:18:01.456]  You have somebody arguing for your side of the case.
[01:18:01.496 --> 01:18:03.016]  That doesn't happen in the FISA court.
[01:18:03.056 --> 01:18:05.297]  In the FISA court, it's done in secret.
[01:18:05.797 --> 01:18:16.139]  There is one judge, no jury, no defense attorney, simply a judge and somebody from the administration saying, we want to do this or that to that person or follow that person.
[01:18:16.699 --> 01:18:23.521]  And as they're going through these various quote-unquote cases, as they make their secretive rulings, which we're not allowed to see,
[01:18:24.301 --> 01:18:28.802]  They're maintaining the fiction that their court rulings are modifying the Constitution.
[01:18:29.983 --> 01:18:43.247]  I would say, along with Jefferson, that the idea that the courts, any courts, including the Supreme Court, are modifying the Constitution with their decisions is one that is going to destroy our country for the longest time.
[01:18:43.267 --> 01:18:49.469]  I mean, we can look at this court case and we can say, what a wonderful thing here that the Supreme Court has now affirmed the Fourth Amendment.
[01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:50.389]  That's nice.
[01:18:50.749 --> 01:18:53.170]  But we have to understand that we have, by
[01:18:54.375 --> 01:19:10.487]  Ignoring this, given over to the Supreme Court, essentially an implied power to modify our Constitution, which is really, really dangerous as we've seen over and over again because they have, in many cases, given incredible power to the police state.
[01:19:10.507 --> 01:19:11.488]  And we've seen Scalia
[01:19:12.228 --> 01:19:23.251]  Essentially echoing Hillary Clinton, where she was saying, well, you know, rights, anybody that maintains that the Second Amendment is an absolute right is terrorizing the public.
[01:19:23.511 --> 01:19:32.554]  See, she's that close to calling people who believe that the Second Amendment is a right and not a government privilege, because that's what it means when you say it's absolute.
[01:19:32.594 --> 01:19:33.394]  You say it's a right.
[01:19:33.714 --> 01:19:34.775]  It's a God-given right.
[01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:38.456]  It's not something that they can infringe, that they can incrementally
[01:19:39.156 --> 01:19:41.359]  Move upon and take away little pieces of it.
[01:19:41.399 --> 01:19:44.143]  When you say that, she says that you're terrorizing people.
[01:19:44.183 --> 01:19:45.565]  She's implying that you're a terrorist.
[01:19:45.985 --> 01:19:50.831]  And yet we've seen one of the so-called conservative judges, Scalia, say essentially the same thing.
[01:19:51.212 --> 01:19:55.437]  He says, if the Fourth Amendment were an absolute right, then you wouldn't have the TSA.
[01:19:57.045 --> 01:19:59.226]  To which I say, it is an absolute right.
[01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:00.187]  It's not a privilege.
[01:20:00.427 --> 01:20:01.808]  The TSA doesn't need to be there.
[01:20:02.108 --> 01:20:05.570]  And we don't need to have Supreme Court justices rewriting the Constitution.
[01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:06.370]  Stay with us.
[01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:09.052]  We'll be right back with Anthony Gucciardi about some health news.

[01:20:39.304 --> 01:20:40.865]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[01:20:41.025 --> 01:20:45.766]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[01:20:46.207 --> 01:20:52.969]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:57.351]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[01:20:57.711 --> 01:21:00.232]  But a friend and patriot has discovered a loophole.
[01:21:00.512 --> 01:21:05.774]  Find out about the NSA loophole before they shut it down at privacylockdown.com.

[01:23:47.765 --> 01:23:48.965]  Chaos on our border.
[01:23:49.385 --> 01:23:51.446]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.

[01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:23.357]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:24.798]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[01:24:24.858 --> 01:24:27.940]  I'm your host today and I'm joined this segment with Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:34.184]  And Anthony, just as I turn over here looking at you, I'm looking at this new, these new Milan Lave belt buckles.
[01:24:34.885 --> 01:24:36.626]  Those are sharp looking buckles, aren't they?
[01:24:36.994 --> 01:24:38.175]  Yeah, they're pretty awesome, actually.
[01:24:38.295 --> 01:24:40.456]  It's a limited edition of 500 of them.
[01:24:40.496 --> 01:24:46.660]  It's one way that you can help to support the operation here, as well as look super cool.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.101]  I think those are nice.
[01:24:48.381 --> 01:24:52.664]  If you've seen the t-shirts, it's essentially, it's very similar to that logo.
[01:24:52.844 --> 01:24:55.165]  Very nice looking logo to go along with the 17, made in 1776 line.
[01:24:55.185 --> 01:24:56.086]  Only 500 of those limited edition.
[01:24:59.708 --> 01:25:03.611]  Anthony, it looks like they're taking the mask off on all fronts, doesn't it?
[01:25:04.172 --> 01:25:19.425]  Well, I don't know if it means that we're winning, which we are in many ways, or if they're just all-out going full frontal assault at this point, because I'm looking at how they're manipulating every single piece of news and every single event in their favor and pushing the most ridiculous option.
[01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:21.827]  And it reminds me of the story from Drudge today.
[01:25:22.507 --> 01:25:31.036]  About the swine flu crossing the border from the illegal immigrants coming in, mostly children, as, you know, we've been talking about shipping them in by the busload.
[01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:35.421]  Well, now the whole angle is, well, let's not worry about that.
[01:25:35.481 --> 01:25:41.026]  What we need is genetically modified meat, because that would overall cure swine flu, and it would cure everything else.
[01:25:41.086 --> 01:25:44.170]  So, I'd like to talk about this popular science article.
[01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:47.211]  Called, How Soon Might We Have Genetically Modified Meat?
[01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:50.212]  Just like begging people, please, just let it happen, it's good for you.
[01:25:50.773 --> 01:25:56.495]  And the sub-headline is, The State of Diarrhea-Preventing Goat Milk, Flu-Resistant Poultry, and Cleaner Pigs.
[01:25:57.015 --> 01:26:10.501]  And it goes on to talk about, you know, it's so strange that people aren't accepting genetically modified animals to eat, because in the past they had genetically modified salmon, and the FDA says that's perfectly safe, you know.
[01:26:10.521 --> 01:26:12.822]  In the first paragraph,
[01:26:14.424 --> 01:26:28.336]  Genetically modified animals have seemed too stalled in the approval processes despite the fact that positive scientific reviews found that aqua bounty fish, the GM fish, is safe to eat and safe for the environment.
[01:26:29.277 --> 01:26:29.457]  Right?
[01:26:29.677 --> 01:26:38.605]  And it goes on to say that maybe what they can do is instead of giving pigs mouse genes, scientists could make domestic pigs with genes normally found in wild pigs.
[01:26:39.045 --> 01:26:40.206]  You know, that's way safer.
[01:26:41.608 --> 01:26:45.011]  Mouse genes are okay, but maybe if we just get a little more domestic.
[01:26:45.172 --> 01:26:56.725]  That Michigan farmer and the other Michigan farmers who were raising a strain of pigs that were hairy because they were essentially free-range pigs in a very cold climate.
[01:26:57.205 --> 01:27:04.330]  And of course they got the Department of Natural Resources there in Michigan to come in and most of those farms, they shut them down and shot the pigs.
[01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:09.654]  This guy fought them for over three years, finally prevailed, but of course, you know, he had to survive.
[01:27:09.694 --> 01:27:15.978]  He had to depend on contributions from people sending him money and he's not getting any compensation from the government for that.
[01:27:16.418 --> 01:27:18.540]  And they never came back and backed off of that.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:24.244]  They just said, well, we'll let you have those pigs, but not necessarily other people.
[01:27:24.284 --> 01:27:25.565]  That's the other tactic that they use.
[01:27:25.605 --> 01:27:37.255]  But popular science seems to always come in with, no matter how bad the technology or how bad the possible consequences, they always take this gee whiz attitude to it.
[01:27:37.295 --> 01:27:42.939]  It's a very dangerous attitude for any scientist to say, well, just because we can do it, we should.
[01:27:43.279 --> 01:27:45.821]  Well, you're not allowed to have actual real hogs, it'll kill all of them.
[01:27:45.881 --> 01:27:47.623]  They can have mouse gene hogs, so those are good.
[01:27:48.203 --> 01:27:49.244]  That's a little bit of an owner piece.
[01:27:49.284 --> 01:27:51.847]  I wanted to tie this in, though, for an understanding here.
[01:27:52.407 --> 01:28:03.098]  The fact that we've already been through this, and what I find most shocking is we keep having these reports come out that even federal scientists are saying, no, this is really weird.
[01:28:03.358 --> 01:28:05.501]  We shouldn't release genetically modified animals.
[01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:08.023]  Specifically, real environmentalists.
[01:28:08.203 --> 01:28:09.945]  Like, that's phony environmentalism to say.
[01:28:10.225 --> 01:28:12.087]  We need to genetically modify all the animals.
[01:28:12.127 --> 01:28:14.849]  It's perfectly safe and clean and we won't have any more diseases.
[01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:22.056]  That's fake environmentalism, globalist insanity, propagated by, you know, the elite who are pushing all of this.
[01:28:22.436 --> 01:28:24.958]  However, you have actual federal scientists.
[01:28:25.159 --> 01:28:25.899]  I've talked to some of them.
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:31.825]  But here we have these leaked emails where they were talking about, you know, basically it's going to turn into Jurassic Park.
[01:28:32.185 --> 01:28:32.285]  Yes.
[01:28:32.305 --> 01:28:36.046]  Because what they claim is that the genetically modified animals are sterile.
[01:28:36.246 --> 01:28:37.126]  Completely sterile.
[01:28:37.566 --> 01:28:49.650]  But they found that despite Aqua Bounty's claim that producers of genetically modified fish should produce only sterile salmon, the company admitted that up to 5% of their genetically modified salmon eggs could be fertile.
[01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:54.696]  And the FDA said, well that could be potentially misleading, but overall it's good and we recommend it.
[01:28:55.297 --> 01:29:06.492]  But even Congress, that passes the most horrendous things you can dream of, many of which are, you know, true criminals, said that no, even this is too insane.
[01:29:07.012 --> 01:29:14.903]  So they banned the FDA, who was pushing it through, pushing through all the genetically modified garbage, saying, no FDA, you actually can't approve this.
[01:29:15.344 --> 01:29:21.672]  They wanted to say that an advisory panel indicated that more studies would be needed before it could be served on the nation's dinner tables.
[01:29:22.563 --> 01:29:28.488]  And if the FDA had approved the salmon, it would be the first time the government allowed such modified animals to be marketed for human consumption.
[01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:30.269]  And the FDA would not label them.
[01:29:30.850 --> 01:29:31.790]  That's how we win.
[01:29:32.231 --> 01:29:33.532]  That's how we get them to stand down.
[01:29:33.592 --> 01:29:34.993]  Just like we did in Syria.
[01:29:35.033 --> 01:29:36.894]  Just as Alex was pointing out in that report.
[01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:48.504]  How in Syria, people push back against this war narrative and we can roll back what's happening at the borders and we can roll back what's happening in genetically modified organisms where they don't even want people to know what's in their food.
[01:29:48.604 --> 01:29:50.125]  Well, even the government is realizing that.
[01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:52.306]  Many of the employees are realizing this is too insane.
[01:29:52.466 --> 01:29:53.947]  This is not even part of the plan.
[01:29:53.987 --> 01:29:56.448]  Even some of the federal scientists are saying, no, this is too insane.
[01:29:57.068 --> 01:29:58.529]  Thank you very much, Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:29:58.549 --> 01:30:00.870]  We're going to be right back with a special report from Alex Jones.
[01:30:09.369 --> 01:30:16.436]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:16.556 --> 01:30:18.718]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:18.899 --> 01:30:24.004]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:24.184 --> 01:30:29.129]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:29.329 --> 01:30:32.392]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:32.652 --> 01:30:36.516]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:36.736 --> 01:30:40.980]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:51.090]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:53.813]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:30:53.993 --> 01:31:02.057]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:02.197 --> 01:31:06.159]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:09.671 --> 01:31:15.620]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:20.027]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:31:20.387 --> 01:31:24.954]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:31:25.354 --> 01:31:27.976]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:31:28.276 --> 01:31:33.458]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:40.602]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:31:41.103 --> 01:31:44.845]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:31:45.245 --> 01:31:50.047]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:50.367 --> 01:31:51.208]  This is innovating.
[01:31:51.488 --> 01:31:58.778]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:31:58.978 --> 01:32:03.043]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:32:09.111 --> 01:32:10.992]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:32:11.332 --> 01:32:19.254]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:26.577]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:31.341]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:32:31.521 --> 01:32:41.669]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:48.315]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:32:48.635 --> 01:32:50.857]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:32:50.877 --> 01:32:54.840]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.582]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:32:56.963 --> 01:33:00.888]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[01:33:12.865 --> 01:33:14.366]  We are on the march.
[01:33:14.726 --> 01:33:17.167]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:17.907 --> 01:33:21.669]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.929 --> 01:33:25.490]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:31.713]  Now, we've been talking about how collapsing the borders is a deliberate tactic to collapse America.
[01:33:31.733 --> 01:33:34.414]  Not only the American economy, but everything about America.
[01:33:34.454 --> 01:33:39.676]  We've sent InfoWars reporters down to the border, and Alex Jones has put together this report to tie it all together.
[01:33:40.717 --> 01:33:44.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a historic crossroads.
[01:33:44.382 --> 01:33:50.170]  The globalists are collapsing our republic right now in front of our very eyes.
[01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:55.897]  They are destroying national sovereignty to bring us into the North American Union.
[01:33:56.678 --> 01:34:18.537]  Crony capitalists that have created the planetary corporate system that we know as the New World Order have been very open about the fact that they want a homogenized, dumbed-down, poor global population that can be exploited for their labor and who will be very pliable in the social engineer's hands.
[01:34:19.597 --> 01:34:27.969]  And we have seen illegal aliens in the last 25 years or so pumped into this country, most of them legalized.
[01:34:28.672 --> 01:34:45.990]  Now they want to legalize between 20 and 30 million that are left, and Obama in the last few years has stopped deportations, has given awards to illegal aliens' children that are here illegally, to create a giant flood, to accelerate the deluge that was already there.
[01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:49.253]  And that has now happened.
[01:34:50.274 --> 01:35:05.931]  We sent our reporters, Jakari Jackson and others, down to the Texas border last week, and what they discovered was even worse than what libertarian and constitutional media was reporting.
[01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:09.873]  Dinosaur Media is saying, oh, America's evil.
[01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:13.494]  We should have totally open borders and give everyone free welfare.
[01:35:14.055 --> 01:35:17.176]  And you're hateful and racist if you don't take the immigrants in.
[01:35:17.756 --> 01:35:27.201]  And Obama not having deportations has nothing to do with the increased surge in illegals from Latin America and other parts of the world pouring across.
[01:35:27.961 --> 01:35:30.988]  Conservative media said, gee, it's terrible.
[01:35:31.589 --> 01:35:33.132]  Obama is encouraging it.
[01:35:33.313 --> 01:35:34.275]  What are we going to do?
[01:35:34.696 --> 01:35:38.324]  We better pass amnesty to stop it, which will only encourage it.
[01:35:40.561 --> 01:35:57.741]  Real media, media that's been absolutely on target like InfoWars.com, DrugsReport.com and WorldNetDaily.com have been reporting on the fact that it's a premeditated plan to implode the borders, swamp the western states so bad that the feds come in in an emergency
[01:35:58.942 --> 01:36:13.788]  And basically use this as a false flag crisis to bring in even more levels of control and force the passage of the Immigration Reform Act that supposedly gives them a legal way into the country when they're already being legalized by fiat.
[01:36:13.808 --> 01:36:22.051]  It'd be like if your boat had a leak in it, shooting more holes in the bottom of the boat and calling that a solution to the leak you have.
[01:36:23.081 --> 01:36:29.967]  It's absolutely insane how they promote this level of nation-ending garbage.
[01:36:30.007 --> 01:36:31.328]  And this is the end of the country.
[01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:39.114]  Mexico, Guatemala, and other Central and South American nations south of southern North America where Mexico resides
[01:36:40.015 --> 01:36:40.335]  Are you
[01:36:57.703 --> 01:37:01.704]  Women with three or four children and no husband who go directly on welfare.
[01:37:02.024 --> 01:37:05.045]  This country will go bankrupt by design.
[01:37:05.385 --> 01:37:09.226]  But that is the Democratic Party's own plan from the 1960s.
[01:37:09.626 --> 01:37:19.449]  Cloward and Piven, the sociologists, a plan to use the welfare system to bankrupt the country and then bring in total socialism as a solution.
[01:37:20.009 --> 01:37:23.651]  We know socialism and communism don't work for the average person.
[01:37:24.011 --> 01:37:43.399]  It does make the political class the new royalty and that's why they've been promoting it with the offshore crony capitalists who are deeply in bed with them because the crony capitalists have written the laws to make themselves largely exempt from the socialism, from the collectivism, from the taxes and the regulation.
[01:37:43.659 --> 01:37:46.881]  Like France's socialist party on record
[01:37:47.381 --> 01:38:00.108]  That pays almost no taxes and have been caught with giant Swiss bank accounts while making the general middle class have a 101% tax in 2013 and 14 to bankrupt them.
[01:38:00.829 --> 01:38:05.812]  The socialist class is tax exempt in the political area.
[01:38:06.272 --> 01:38:09.314]  Again, this is the key to the control system.
[01:38:10.194 --> 01:38:28.524]  So I wanted to take all the reports they filed last week, and the reports that John Bowne and others when they got back gave us, some of which haven't even been seen yet on the nightly news, and condense it all into one big master report, so you can understand just exactly what's happening.
[01:38:28.544 --> 01:38:36.668]  Because we didn't know how bad it was, as much as Infowars.com knew, as much as I understood about this takeover plan.
[01:38:37.817 --> 01:38:53.962]  I didn't realize that the Border Patrol lets the buses come in in Brownsville, McAllen, and other areas, and then once they get here, they give them vouchers to go wherever they want in the United States, where the illegal aliens say they've got family.
[01:38:54.302 --> 01:38:58.023]  And it's not just children and teenagers, it's mothers and it's fathers.
[01:38:58.183 --> 01:38:58.923]  It is the literal
[01:38:59.523 --> 01:39:20.083]  Destitute to be attached to the government taxpayer funded system as the veterans don't get treatment, as death panels are set up, as old people are being euthanized, as the pension funds are being raided, as beef prices and other commodities are increasing because of dollar devaluation.
[01:39:21.304 --> 01:39:31.472]  The collapsing system in Mexico is the battering ram to bring in all the other poor Latin Americans and literally implode this country.
[01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:36.996]  We are seeing total treason unfold and take place right now in front of us.
[01:39:37.396 --> 01:39:42.740]  Now we're going to get into all the video evidence of this with Jakari Jackson narrating here in just a moment.
[01:39:43.826 --> 01:39:44.927]  And his special report.
[01:39:44.988 --> 01:39:51.436]  But first off, let's look at what we learned, thanks to our reporters going to the borders, that has now forced the mainstream media to cover this.
[01:39:51.876 --> 01:39:56.282]  Days after we broke this news last week, you would see it on Fox and CNN.
[01:39:56.923 --> 01:40:00.847]  In part, thanks to DrugsReport.com picking up our articles.
[01:40:02.185 --> 01:40:21.155]  By last Wednesday, we had caught the Border Patrol red-handed and had the emergency manager head of McAllen admit that 90-plus percent of the illegals getting off the buses had been given, again, vouchers and tickets and authorization illegally, violates federal law, by the Border Patrol, under Obama's orders,
[01:40:21.775 --> 01:40:25.438]  To be sent into the interior, wherever they wanted to go.
[01:40:25.458 --> 01:40:27.059]  Unprecedented.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:33.485]  I can't get a free ticket from Austin down to McAllen, but they can get one thousands of miles to Chicago, Illinois.
[01:40:34.978 --> 01:40:56.116]  After that broke, we were able to talk to a ice whistleblower who, and that's coming up, who confirmed that they're bringing in tuberculosis, smallpox, chicken pox, you name it, an absolute disaster, and that MS-13 is pouring in, and more and more Border Patrol is now just resigning in disgust.
[01:40:56.816 --> 01:41:21.718]  Over all of this because they realize now that their job is to quote make Formula heat formula and change diapers of the illegal aliens and act as butlers as the illegals complain That the HEB food store food is not gourmet enough Continuing in the article that went viral Paul Watson of Infowars.com discovered
[01:41:22.958 --> 01:41:39.494]  On the federal government's own website that indeed there is a purchase order out back from January showing this was premeditated to help bring the illegal aliens in to the country and deploy them around the nation.
[01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:49.637]  And there is that particular document you can link through at InfoWars.com in this report.
[01:41:50.117 --> 01:41:52.977]  DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted into the U.S.
[01:41:53.678 --> 01:41:57.319]  and it breaks down here with a link to the federal government's own
[01:41:59.147 --> 01:42:06.493]  Public website, FedBizOpps, where you can bid on carrying out this contract.
[01:42:06.533 --> 01:42:09.095]  So, huge news on that front.
[01:42:09.436 --> 01:42:15.441]  We also documented that Evangelical, Catholic, and Protestant churches getting government
[01:42:16.514 --> 01:42:41.827]  State funding through the church initiatives that Bush launched, faith-based initiative, they're being paid to pick up the illegals where the border patrol leaves off once their buses arrive and to ship them to other facilities and to get them their driver's license and voter registration cards to begin voting to pass gun control and even further open borders.
[01:42:41.887 --> 01:42:43.288]  So this is the political end
[01:42:44.108 --> 01:42:44.428]  I think?
[01:43:04.409 --> 01:43:04.989]  is the limit.
[01:43:05.029 --> 01:43:17.172]  Hillary Clinton said last week, so did Obama, that we need Australian-style gun bans, and that gun owners are terrorizing America, and that our ideas, our rights themselves, are terrorism.
[01:43:18.073 --> 01:43:31.376]  Now I want to go to this report, again, filed by our great reporter, Sha'Carri Jackson, John Bowne, Adon Salazar, writing for Infowars.com, and Joe Jennings, and then we will return back
[01:43:31.556 --> 01:43:36.297]  to the InfoWars radio show today being hosted by our very own David Knight.
[01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:41.858]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the new InfoWars.com television studios.
[01:43:42.318 --> 01:43:44.579]  Again, here is the special report.
[01:43:44.919 --> 01:43:47.139]  Please get this report out to your friends and family.
[01:43:47.439 --> 01:43:56.441]  This is the end of this country being replaced by total squalor and tyranny under the North American Union if we don't speak up and say no now.
[01:43:56.761 --> 01:44:03.745]  With daily reports of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States, InfoWars headed to South Texas to investigate.
[01:44:04.225 --> 01:44:13.130]  In McAllen, Texas, we found that church groups were working with the city of McAllen to transport and house illegal immigrants who had been recently released by the Border Patrol.
[01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:17.092]  Many immigrants were fleeing countries that could be considered failed states.
[01:44:17.489 --> 01:44:20.651]  Now as you can see behind me, there's a van that's ready to transport some children.
[01:44:21.031 --> 01:44:22.713]  I'm not sure if they're going to a military base.
[01:44:22.973 --> 01:44:24.874]  I'm not sure if they're going to another church facility.
[01:44:25.154 --> 01:44:30.578]  But as you recall, our reporters went to San Antonio, Texas and encountered some children at a base there.
[01:44:30.738 --> 01:44:38.263]  The representatives we talked to did stress that the illegals they were housing had orders to appear in court for entering the country illegally.
[01:44:38.603 --> 01:44:40.725]  We spoke to the emergency manager in McAllen.
[01:44:40.905 --> 01:44:48.211]  Who told us he had a reason to believe that Border Patrol was providing at least some of the Central American immigrants with travel accommodations.
[01:44:48.571 --> 01:45:03.223]  The only ones that you'll see here are family units that are like a mom and a couple of kids that they have determined don't pose any sort of security risk and have a criminal background and they've got relatives or help somewhere in the interior.
[01:45:03.523 --> 01:45:05.245]  So that category of people
[01:45:05.945 --> 01:45:08.027]  With what we learned, we went to the border in search of illegal crossings.
[01:45:08.047 --> 01:45:13.534]  We spotted a Border Patrol unit tailing us, so we pulled over to the side to see if it actually was following us, and indeed it was.
[01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:31.971]  No longer being pursued, we headed to South Padre Island on a side mission.
[01:45:32.331 --> 01:45:36.552]  Earlier this year, Info Wars had tested radiation levels on the U.S.
[01:45:36.632 --> 01:45:37.393]  West Coast.
[01:45:37.873 --> 01:45:43.015]  And since the immigration story had brought us to the Gulf Coast, we decided to test that as well.
[01:45:43.775 --> 01:45:50.698]  During the trip, we had been in contact with an ICE agent who was eager to blow the whistle on practices in his organization.
[01:45:51.018 --> 01:45:53.619]  His report revealed chilling health concerns.
[01:45:54.093 --> 01:45:58.874]  What are you guys doing to help keep the diseases or the sickness to a minimum?
[01:45:58.914 --> 01:46:01.855]  Are you guys giving them any type of medication in your facilities?
[01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:04.215]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:46:04.895 --> 01:46:16.157]  Whoever is epi-containing, they go through a lengthy screening process to insert chest x-rays, septic tuberculosis, things of that nature.
[01:46:17.118 --> 01:46:18.038]  And they're treated.
[01:46:18.058 --> 01:46:19.218]  They're treated.
[01:46:19.538 --> 01:46:23.479]  And typically, let's say for example, personal tuberculosis will not be released until
[01:46:24.637 --> 01:46:45.421]  And so either A, the treatment is completed or B, they can get together with the country of the person where they're from and get with medical there and make sure that they can continue to take their treatment when they return to their country.
[01:46:45.741 --> 01:46:49.562]  What's the most common illness that you see coming from these Central American countries?
[01:46:49.742 --> 01:46:51.582]  We do get our isolated cases of
[01:46:52.486 --> 01:47:03.759]  People with tuberculosis, there may be a couple that come through that they admit to having a communicable disease.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:07.162]  But I mean, really?
[01:47:07.203 --> 01:47:07.603]  We don't check?
[01:47:14.013 --> 01:47:16.835]  Later, our search took us to Brownsville, Texas.
[01:47:16.976 --> 01:47:22.519]  We tried to talk to the public information officer at the border crossing, but he refused to comment on camera.
[01:47:22.679 --> 01:47:27.163]  He told us to put in a media request that would be responded to within 21 days.
[01:47:27.543 --> 01:47:34.488]  While I was conversing with the PIO, a rifleman was dispatched to deal with the rest of our crew as they were filming the checkpoint.
[01:47:38.263 --> 01:47:38.924]  Assault rifle.
[01:47:39.184 --> 01:47:45.552]  Our original mission to film illegals being transported to bus stations had exceeded beyond our expectations.
[01:47:45.952 --> 01:47:50.838]  We even found out that FCC controlled media had followed in our footsteps in McAllen.
[01:47:51.258 --> 01:47:58.207]  We headed home, but with one last checkpoint separating us from Austin, the security theater was impossible to avoid.
[01:47:58.867 --> 01:48:02.910]  Like the TSA, Border Patrol screens at mandatory checkpoints.
[01:48:03.450 --> 01:48:09.234]  It seems like the individual agents use their own discretion to judge who and who is not on the level.
[01:48:09.835 --> 01:48:19.621]  InfoWars reporter John Bowne decided to tell the Border Patrol that if they really wanted to do their jobs effectively, he had a few suggestions on where they could find illegals.
[01:48:22.603 --> 01:48:23.284]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:48:24.594 --> 01:48:34.398]  Hey, I just want to make you aware of the fact that the organization you work for, the Border Patrol, is funding illegals coming into our country completely illegally.
[01:48:34.458 --> 01:48:35.139]  Are you aware of that?
[01:48:35.359 --> 01:48:35.959]  I am aware of that.
[01:48:36.399 --> 01:48:39.020]  We got to talk to somebody else.
[01:48:40.461 --> 01:48:45.203]  We got chased around by Border Patrol because we're American journalists now.
[01:48:47.049 --> 01:48:51.712]  Border Patrol is part of an illegal act against the American people.
[01:48:51.752 --> 01:48:53.293]  I'm not some whack job.
[01:48:53.953 --> 01:48:58.996]  I just wanted to bring it to your attention and let you know that you may run into more people like me.
[01:48:59.496 --> 01:49:02.918]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:04.539 --> 01:49:08.201]  To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple.
[01:49:08.701 --> 01:49:13.784]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, pay $1 an hour for your labor,
[01:49:15.123 --> 01:49:16.004]  Have no health care.
[01:49:16.164 --> 01:49:18.506]  That's the most expensive single element in making a car.
[01:49:19.086 --> 01:49:23.069]  Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement.
[01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:26.912]  And you don't care about anything but making money.
[01:49:27.412 --> 01:49:29.974]  There will be a giant sucking sound going south.
[01:49:34.358 --> 01:49:36.920]  You just heard Ross Perot talking about NAFTA.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.180]  That was 20 years ago.
[01:49:38.261 --> 01:49:42.524]  I want you to listen to what David Petraeus said last week about NAFTA.
[01:49:43.643 --> 01:49:45.724]  America becomes North America.
[01:49:46.005 --> 01:49:48.726]  Are we on the threshold of the North American decades?
[01:49:48.786 --> 01:49:49.407]  Question mark.
[01:49:50.428 --> 01:49:57.372]  I threw that away, threw away the question mark, and boldly proclaimed the coming North American decades as the title now.
[01:49:58.133 --> 01:50:09.620]  It's founded on recognition that if you put these three economies together, as has been the case twenty years into the North American Free Trade Act implementation, you find
[01:50:12.602 --> 01:50:17.065]  Yeah, you find unique demographics.
[01:50:17.085 --> 01:50:20.467]  He goes on to talk about how this is the only area where demographics are going up.
[01:50:20.927 --> 01:50:23.168]  Well that's because the borders have collapsed.
[01:50:23.749 --> 01:50:29.232]  And of course that question, I don't know if you caught that at the very beginning, the question that he was answering in that conference was,
[01:50:30.052 --> 01:50:31.593]  After America, what next?
[01:50:32.013 --> 01:50:33.914]  And his answer was North America.
[01:50:33.954 --> 01:50:41.857]  And he made no bones about the fact that he considered to be NAFTA and a North American Union to be an accomplished fact 20 years ago.
[01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:45.772]  Americans, by and large, didn't get that message.
[01:50:46.432 --> 01:50:47.272]  Are they getting it now?
[01:50:47.812 --> 01:50:55.534]  Are they getting it now that the borders are being collapsed, that they're creating a demographic tension, a surge that we cannot support?
[01:50:55.694 --> 01:50:59.955]  It's a new kind of surge coming from General Petraeus and other global elitists.
[01:51:00.275 --> 01:51:06.557]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back, and we're going to be talking about the police state USA with Cheryl Chumley in the next hour.

[01:52:09.086 --> 01:52:15.049]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:52:15.249 --> 01:52:19.411]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:52:19.812 --> 01:52:24.334]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:52:24.754 --> 01:52:27.376]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:52:27.677 --> 01:52:32.861]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:52:33.121 --> 01:52:39.987]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:52:40.507 --> 01:52:44.271]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:52:44.631 --> 01:52:49.415]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:49.735 --> 01:52:50.596]  This is innovating.
[01:52:50.856 --> 01:52:58.140]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:54:14.763 --> 01:54:15.943]  I was a highway man
[01:54:17.157 --> 01:54:20.481]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:20.581 --> 01:54:23.924]  I'm David Knight, and we've been talking about a variety of issues.
[01:54:24.425 --> 01:54:27.668]  The police state, as well as the collapse of our borders.
[01:54:27.768 --> 01:54:33.454]  And understand that those are both being run by the same agency, Homeland Security.
[01:54:33.954 --> 01:54:36.157]  It was created in the wake of the 9-11 attacks.
[01:54:37.478 --> 01:54:41.960]  Destroying our civil liberties, destroying the borders, militarizing our police.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.741]  And in the next hour, we're going to be talking to Cheryl Chumley.
[01:54:45.181 --> 01:54:49.383]  We sell her book, Police State USA, at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:49.403 --> 01:54:50.483]  We're going to talk to her about this.
[01:54:50.983 --> 01:54:57.506]  She says that our rights come from God and not government, and she goes back to the Declaration of Independence, but she unpacks in this book.
[01:54:58.166 --> 01:54:59.648]  How we got to where we are.
[01:54:59.668 --> 01:55:02.130]  And we're going to talk to her about some possible solutions as well.
[01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:02.891]  So don't miss that.
[01:55:02.911 --> 01:55:04.152]  It's coming up in the next hour.
[01:55:04.553 --> 01:55:09.859]  This hour has been brought to you by Survival Shield X2 and Fluoride Shield.

[01:55:25.690 --> 01:55:32.694]  And also, we just got in this week these new Moulin Lave belt buckles that look fantastic.
[01:55:33.094 --> 01:55:34.834]  Limited edition, just 500 of those.
[01:55:36.315 --> 01:55:37.916]  Now, there's a lot of news breaking.
[01:55:37.956 --> 01:55:43.397]  We had the Supreme Court decision today finally getting behind unanimously the Fourth Amendment.
[01:55:43.777 --> 01:55:56.661]  I don't know, you know when they swear allegiance to the Constitution, wouldn't you think that they would be able to understand that you don't search people without a warrant, and their person, their places, their houses, their effects, and yet that's what we see with the police state.
[01:55:56.681 --> 01:55:58.662]  That's what we're going to be talking to Cheryl Chumley about.
[01:55:59.062 --> 01:56:00.182]  It's been a long time coming.
[01:56:00.622 --> 01:56:03.003]  The justification has, for the longest time, been the
[01:56:03.943 --> 01:56:06.644]  I think unconstitutional war on drugs itself.
[01:56:07.385 --> 01:56:13.647]  You know, you had to have a constitutional amendment to have alcohol prohibition, and then another constitutional amendment to take it away.
[01:56:14.348 --> 01:56:18.590]  And we've only got, that's about 10% of the constitutional amendments we've got.
[01:56:19.090 --> 01:56:24.432]  Where was the constitutional amendment that prohibited heroin, or cocaine, or marijuana?
[01:56:24.532 --> 01:56:26.193]  Where did we have those constitutional amendments?
[01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:28.454]  Where did the government get that power?
[01:56:29.224 --> 01:56:37.171]  You know when they passed the prohibition constitutional amendment for alcohol prohibition, we had a government then that respected the rule of law.
[01:56:37.672 --> 01:56:38.392]  They were wrong.
[01:56:39.278 --> 01:56:43.503]  When they did alcohol prohibition, it had all of the wrong consequences.
[01:56:44.103 --> 01:56:46.085]  All it did was increase crime.
[01:56:46.145 --> 01:56:48.508]  It gave organized crime a black market monopoly.
[01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:49.769]  It increased drug use.
[01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:53.794]  It increased the intensity of alcohol at the time.
[01:56:54.094 --> 01:57:00.801]  And we've seen all of those things happen with the war on drugs, except we've seen many consequences that are far, far worse than that.
[01:57:01.502 --> 01:57:09.429]  We've seen them using this, not only has it increased in intensity, not only has it increased organized crime, but they have now taken the position where...
[01:57:10.666 --> 01:57:16.550]  Beginning with Reagan, with his zero tolerance, and he took the strategy that he would go after the end user.
[01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:22.793]  Something they never did during alcohol prohibition, and of course the war on drugs has now gone on for decades.
[01:57:23.594 --> 01:57:24.474]  What is happening with that?
[01:57:24.514 --> 01:57:31.538]  Well, that's been one of the major things that's been pushing people out of Central and South America into the United States.
[01:57:31.919 --> 01:57:37.242]  We see an article today that the real push, what's pushing the people into the United States is crime in their country,
[01:57:38.266 --> 01:57:43.812]  And the implication that they're going to be able to live here free and under the state.
[01:57:43.852 --> 01:57:46.094]  That's why Obama has sent that message out to them.
[01:57:46.475 --> 01:57:56.685]  But the other thing that is pushing them, so there's a pull of amnesty, of a carefree existence at the expense of American taxpayers that we cannot afford to do.
[01:57:56.845 --> 01:57:58.467]  It'll collapse this country's economy.
[01:57:58.807 --> 01:58:00.209]  But the thing that's also pushing them
[01:58:01.008 --> 01:58:03.309]  is the plague of violence in their country.
[01:58:03.450 --> 01:58:05.931]  Look at how many people have died just in Mexico.
[01:58:06.331 --> 01:58:08.332]  Well over 100,000 by most estimates.
[01:58:08.933 --> 01:58:13.976]  This is far worse in terms of violence than what's going on in Afghanistan in terms of casualties.
[01:58:14.736 --> 01:58:19.379]  And yet, that is a policy that is being done, promoted, by the United States.
[01:58:19.779 --> 01:58:20.879]  That's what's pushing him in here.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.021]  That's what's been pushing the police state.
[01:58:23.641 --> 01:58:29.925]  But now they've got a new method to build a police state, and that of course is the fear of terrorism.
[01:58:30.025 --> 01:58:37.490]  So we're going to be talking the next hour to Cheryl Chumley about Police State USA, a book that is available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:39.271]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:51.989 --> 01:58:55.964]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.426 --> 01:59:05.531]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:59:05.551 --> 01:59:06.972]  The police are shoving people.
[01:59:07.032 --> 01:59:08.893]  Shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:59:08.913 --> 01:59:09.674]  Here we go, folks!
[01:59:09.754 --> 01:59:10.595]  I'm being a sergeant!
[01:59:10.655 --> 01:59:16.919]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:16.999 --> 01:59:22.884]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:59:23.044 --> 01:59:26.806]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:27.006 --> 01:59:29.888]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:59:30.068 --> 01:59:38.093]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:38.353 --> 01:59:40.394]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:59:40.454 --> 01:59:41.495]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:41.855 --> 01:59:50.621]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:00:15.333 --> 02:00:15.974]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.635 --> 02:00:17.656]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.417 --> 02:00:19.518]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:20.980]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:22.682]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.302 --> 02:00:26.926]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.487 --> 02:00:31.552]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.228 --> 02:00:35.249]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[02:00:35.289 --> 02:00:41.411]  We're going to be joined in this hour with Cheryl Chumley, talking about the Police State USA, and of course, there's many aspects of that.
[02:00:41.451 --> 02:00:42.692]  How are they going to push that?
[02:00:42.812 --> 02:00:55.617]  Well, we just had a clip in the last segment from David Petraeus, where he was talking about how NAFTA's been in place for about 20 years, and North America has replaced America.
[02:00:56.157 --> 02:00:56.918]  That was his words.
[02:00:57.827 --> 02:01:00.869]  That was his words, and that's what we're seeing happening right now.
[02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:05.433]  They're now rolling this out with essentially boots on the ground.
[02:01:05.453 --> 02:01:13.559]  We've seen the bankers attack us from the air, if you will, taking our property with the financial collapse of the mortgage markets.
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:18.623]  What might happen in the future with other economic collapse?
[02:01:18.643 --> 02:01:21.665]  Well, they're going to have a surge, a demographic surge.
[02:01:21.685 --> 02:01:22.806]  That's what's going on right now.
[02:01:22.846 --> 02:01:29.471]  We've got a lot of young people, a lot of teenagers being brought into this country, being treated far better than anyone here.
[02:01:29.811 --> 02:01:30.872]  They're not being harassed.
[02:01:30.892 --> 02:01:32.953]  They're being brought in with dignity.
[02:01:33.013 --> 02:01:36.536]  They're being treated with dignity and bused into the interior of our country.
[02:01:36.576 --> 02:01:39.017]  That's what the requests on FedBiz
[02:01:39.898 --> 02:01:41.859]  FedBizOpps was talking about.
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:45.282]  They said they wanted these people brought in with dignity.
[02:01:45.862 --> 02:01:49.265]  Who gets dignity when they come into the United States at the airports?
[02:01:49.465 --> 02:01:54.128]  They haven't told TSA to stand down and yet our borders are wide open.
[02:01:54.188 --> 02:02:06.377]  It shows the hypocrisy, the false facade that we've been sold by Homeland Security, the same agency that creates, that controls both our borders as well as militarizing the police.
[02:02:07.057 --> 02:02:15.982]  And of course, we need to remember that Homeland Security was created and the justification for it was the false flag attacks of 10 years ago, 9-11.
[02:02:16.662 --> 02:02:19.404]  And this is what Dick Cheney chillingly had to say.
[02:02:19.424 --> 02:02:23.326]  Do you think we get through this decade without a massive attack on the homeland?
[02:02:24.546 --> 02:02:24.927]  I doubt it.
[02:02:25.747 --> 02:02:26.087]  I doubt it.
[02:02:26.147 --> 02:02:27.428]  I think there will be another attack.
[02:02:28.306 --> 02:02:32.309]  Um, and the next time I think it's likely to be far deadlier than the last one.
[02:02:32.789 --> 02:02:42.215]  Can you imagine what would happen if somebody could smuggle a, uh, a nuclear device, put it in a shipping container, and drive it down the beltway outside Washington, D.C.?
[02:02:42.235 --> 02:02:47.498]  Do you, by the way, if that were to happen, would you see the government reconstituting?
[02:02:47.698 --> 02:02:50.520]  Because it would have to be military rule for a period of time, at least.
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.321]  Well, there was, uh...
[02:02:53.311 --> 02:03:14.168]  Some years ago, a program called the Continuity of Government Program, it was part of the Cold War strategy that we pursued here and basically it involved having a government waiting, if you will, ready to go in the event of a nuclear attack on the United States so that we could always
[02:03:14.827 --> 02:03:15.227]  Yeah, I
[02:03:34.819 --> 02:03:35.819]  What does that remind me of?
[02:03:35.859 --> 02:03:36.840]  It's like, ah, I got it!
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:39.540]  It's Dr. Strangelove, you know?
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.901]  A picture of the mad scientist.
[02:03:41.221 --> 02:03:46.502]  This is what Dick Cheney is channeling, and you know, we're laughing about it, but it's not a laughing matter.
[02:03:47.162 --> 02:03:50.663]  They're perfectly capable of doing this in a compartmentalized way.
[02:03:51.023 --> 02:03:52.464]  I'm sure he knows just the guy.
[02:03:53.024 --> 02:03:55.405]  To put in a suitcase nuke, and to make this happen.
[02:03:55.425 --> 02:04:03.029]  And of course, this is what the neocons, this is what the people who are pushing the militarized police state, they're always scaring this, they're always holding that up.
[02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:05.170]  What if we lose a city to a nuclear bomb?
[02:04:05.650 --> 02:04:08.872]  That has been what people like Newt Gingrich is talking about.
[02:04:08.892 --> 02:04:18.917]  You know, when Ron Paul would talk in the debates about how we needed a rational and a sane foreign policy, not to provoke everybody in the world to hate us, which is part of their game.
[02:04:19.617 --> 02:04:24.742]  As Alex has said many times, these Muslim terrorists really do hate America.
[02:04:24.782 --> 02:04:26.364]  They really do want to kill Americans.
[02:04:26.404 --> 02:04:36.373]  What they don't realize, though, is that in many cases they're being used, controlled, equipped and supplied at the top levels by the CIA, by the U.S.
[02:04:36.413 --> 02:04:36.754]  government.
[02:04:36.794 --> 02:04:38.776]  That's what we saw happening in Benghazi.
[02:04:38.816 --> 02:04:40.477]  We saw that happening in Syria.
[02:04:41.238 --> 02:04:44.239]  We can expose this and we can stop this.
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:56.625]  Just as we're exposing the police state and now we've got people on both the left and the right pushing back against it, we've got the Guardian and the ACLU sounding like the John Birch Society and the New American of decades ago.
[02:04:56.725 --> 02:05:01.227]  People are starting to understand that this is the existential threat to America.
[02:05:01.247 --> 02:05:03.468]  It's our liberty being taken away.
[02:05:03.928 --> 02:05:06.970]  You will never have liberty if you give up your security.
[02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:09.011]  You will just live in a maximum security state.
[02:05:09.031 --> 02:05:09.711]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:10.111 --> 02:05:11.872]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:05:12.393 --> 02:05:19.357]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:05:19.818 --> 02:05:30.245]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:05:30.665 --> 02:05:39.871]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:05:40.611 --> 02:05:44.014]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:05:44.674 --> 02:05:48.096]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:05:48.436 --> 02:05:49.997]  Experience the new formula.
[02:05:50.498 --> 02:05:52.479]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:05:53.059 --> 02:05:54.040]  Shield your family.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:55.781]  Survival Shield X2.

[02:06:08.464 --> 02:06:12.487]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:12.507 --> 02:06:16.669]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:16.909 --> 02:06:20.291]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:20.552 --> 02:06:23.433]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:23.593 --> 02:06:30.918]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:31.158 --> 02:06:34.820]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:39.303]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:39.483 --> 02:06:45.426]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:45.466 --> 02:06:49.488]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:49.508 --> 02:06:51.949]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:53.490]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:53.630 --> 02:06:54.871]  It's time to take action.

[02:07:09.719 --> 02:07:10.779]  In the near future.
[02:07:10.999 --> 02:07:15.200]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.560]  Security alert.
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:18.521]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:07:18.781 --> 02:07:22.341]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[02:07:22.361 --> 02:07:27.322]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:07:27.362 --> 02:07:29.842]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:32.783]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:07:32.803 --> 02:07:35.863]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:07:36.043 --> 02:07:38.264]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:07:38.344 --> 02:07:39.064]  These people are a
[02:07:39.264 --> 02:07:41.266]  They're never going to stop.
[02:07:41.466 --> 02:07:48.311]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:07:48.351 --> 02:07:54.496]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:07:55.637 --> 02:08:00.521]  Intellectually it's begun, you can feel it.
[02:08:08.835 --> 02:08:22.860]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United States
[02:08:24.016 --> 02:08:25.478]  Take action and reply.
[02:08:26.119 --> 02:08:33.128]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:08:33.208 --> 02:08:34.630]  Kennedy has been shot.
[02:08:34.730 --> 02:08:36.532]  He still has the gun.
[02:08:36.552 --> 02:08:38.154]  The gun is pointed at him at this moment.
[02:08:38.174 --> 02:08:41.358]  Take a hold of this bomb and break it if you have to.
[02:08:48.502 --> 02:08:55.986]  People calling themselves members of the Weather Underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[02:08:56.086 --> 02:09:00.648]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:09:00.668 --> 02:09:09.352]  Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgement that the Israeli Air Force bombed a U.S.
[02:09:09.612 --> 02:09:10.673]  intelligence Navy ship.
[02:09:10.933 --> 02:09:16.195]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:19.917]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S.
[02:09:20.017 --> 02:09:20.677]  helicopter.
[02:09:21.037 --> 02:09:25.199]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are U.S.
[02:09:25.259 --> 02:09:25.999]  Navy SEALs.
[02:09:26.039 --> 02:09:33.683]  There may be a false flag incident where a ship goes down and it could be used to accelerate the next war.
[02:09:34.023 --> 02:09:38.425]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between,
[02:09:39.065 --> 02:09:40.566]  It's that we all hated the bank bailout.
[02:09:40.967 --> 02:09:45.430]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:09:45.590 --> 02:09:49.633]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:49.734 --> 02:09:55.658]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[02:09:55.678 --> 02:10:00.842]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[02:10:01.143 --> 02:10:02.804]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:10:03.044 --> 02:10:04.045]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:10:04.065 --> 02:10:05.246]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:10:05.606 --> 02:10:06.407]  This isn't a game!
[02:10:08.905 --> 02:10:14.008]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:16.950]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:17.050 --> 02:10:25.655]  I'm David Knight here in Austin, and we have joining us Cheryl Chumley, author of Police State USA, a book that we carry at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:25.675 --> 02:10:27.996]  Now, Cheryl Chumley is a journalist.
[02:10:28.056 --> 02:10:30.258]  She's a veteran news writer with the Washington Times.
[02:10:30.278 --> 02:10:32.179]  She writes for a lot of other publications as well.
[02:10:32.859 --> 02:10:41.967]  Her bio says she spent the last 15 years writing about a wide range of topics from politics, policy, and presidential elections to small town courts, cops, and county government.
[02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:49.613]  And that's given her a front row seat to corruption, government malfeasance, bureaucracy, and unconstitutional actions.
[02:10:49.653 --> 02:10:54.217]  Boy, I tell you what, you want a front row seat to all this stuff, you just get out there and start reporting about it.
[02:10:54.777 --> 02:11:02.562]  Her book is a layman's guide to the latest in constitutional hits that this nation has taken in the name of the war on drugs and many other things.
[02:11:02.722 --> 02:11:03.382]  Welcome, Cheryl.
[02:11:03.943 --> 02:11:04.583]  Hey, David.
[02:11:04.643 --> 02:11:05.904]  Thanks so much for having me.
[02:11:05.944 --> 02:11:06.664]  Great to be here.
[02:11:06.784 --> 02:11:15.329]  Well, thank you for joining us and thank you for trying to bring people's attention to what's going on because this is something that I've seen unfolding for quite some time.
[02:11:15.409 --> 02:11:19.592]  Where would you say that things like civil asset forfeiture and everything, where did that all begin?
[02:11:20.552 --> 02:11:28.839]  Well, it began, as you mentioned in your intro, that particular aspect started with the war on drugs, civil forfeitures.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:38.408]  But I see the state of our nation as crumbling way back when the progressive era began, and it really ratcheted up in speed after September 11th.
[02:11:39.148 --> 02:11:40.229]  Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.
[02:11:40.569 --> 02:11:43.971]  Now, but before we get to that, let's talk about civil asset forfeiture.
[02:11:44.552 --> 02:11:50.836]  Unpack that for the audience a little bit as to what's really involved in that because it really is kind of an Alice in Wonderland thing, isn't it?
[02:11:50.856 --> 02:11:52.357]  It sure is.
[02:11:52.377 --> 02:11:58.981]  Just to put it bluntly, civil forfeiture laws give police at the local level
[02:11:59.441 --> 02:12:19.252]  State and federal level the right to take your properties without due process of law the way it works is police officers They get an incentive from the federal government for confiscating properties done based on causes suspicion of drugs suspicion of certain crimes and
[02:12:19.552 --> 02:12:26.314]  And they get to keep those properties regardless of whether you are actually proven guilty or not in court.
[02:12:26.914 --> 02:12:36.536]  And what that does is it puts the victims in a position of having to go to court if they are innocent of the crimes supposedly that the police officers pulled them over for.
[02:12:37.696 --> 02:12:42.637]  They are put in the position of having to go to court and prove their innocence to win back their properties.
[02:12:43.098 --> 02:12:44.778]  This is a million dollar business.
[02:12:45.158 --> 02:12:48.679]  It's turned police departments into cash cow machines.
[02:12:49.219 --> 02:12:57.143]  Seeking out any cause to pull people over on the side of the road, confiscate their cash, their cars, their properties, their cell phones, and so forth.
[02:12:57.443 --> 02:12:57.823]  That's right.
[02:12:57.843 --> 02:13:06.847]  And what's really amazing is in many of these cases, they bring charges not against a person, but against the inanimate object that they seize.
[02:13:07.188 --> 02:13:08.908]  So you see things like the U.S.
[02:13:08.988 --> 02:13:11.329]  government versus $9,000 of cash.
[02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:12.070]  The U.S.
[02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:14.971]  government versus Learjet serial number such and such.
[02:13:15.411 --> 02:13:18.353]  They'll never charge the person with a crime, but they say, well, you know,
[02:13:19.113 --> 02:13:29.783]  I think that maybe the money that you got on your person as you're flying on the airplane, I think that that's maybe involved somehow with drugs, so I'm just going to say that it is, and I'm going to keep it.
[02:13:30.123 --> 02:13:36.789]  And that becomes a major portion of the funding of a lot of these local police stations, police departments.
[02:13:37.249 --> 02:13:43.555]  It's really corrupted them by allowing them to keep that money, and I remember Miami Vice, when that came out.
[02:13:43.775 --> 02:13:57.544]  That was a way for that to be glamorized, to be made acceptable to the public, that, hey, look, these are really cool guys and they're cops and they get to keep all these fast cars and fast boats that they confiscate from other people.
[02:13:57.604 --> 02:13:58.225]  Isn't that great?
[02:13:58.785 --> 02:14:01.447]  You know, that's the way they sold it to us in the culture, isn't it?
[02:14:02.375 --> 02:14:03.376]  Well, it's true.
[02:14:03.436 --> 02:14:07.239]  These are egregious hits to the Constitution, and there's more than one type.
[02:14:07.279 --> 02:14:14.025]  There's criminal asset forfeiture, and then there's civil asset forfeiture, which has less of a standard for police to make.
[02:14:14.565 --> 02:14:30.198]  And as a matter of fact, the Supreme Court just ruled earlier this year that in civil asset forfeitures, police do not have to return properties to suspected criminals or, you know, suspects in these cases until the court rules
[02:14:30.999 --> 02:14:32.339]  You know, for or against them.
[02:14:32.659 --> 02:14:46.502]  So what that means in the practical aspect, if you're carrying cash in your vehicle, you're pulled over, the police take your cash based on some nebulous charge they drum up, and you need that cash to launch a lawsuit to win back that cash.
[02:14:46.803 --> 02:14:53.064]  The Supreme Court says no, you can't get access to your cash to even fight your own civil forfeiture case.
[02:14:53.644 --> 02:15:00.369]  And I think the case that you're talking about, if I remember correctly, it was a couple who were accused of stealing medical devices.
[02:15:00.409 --> 02:15:07.013]  This wasn't organized crime, this wasn't drug lords that were working on this, because that's the way they come at you.
[02:15:07.033 --> 02:15:12.317]  You know, they started asset forfeiture essentially with the RICO statutes, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:15:12.757 --> 02:15:21.283]  They started that first and said, you know, that's the only way we can get a conviction against these organized crime figures because they're so wealthy, they can afford such good lawyers, they're constantly getting off.
[02:15:21.323 --> 02:15:23.124]  So we need to take their assets first.
[02:15:23.604 --> 02:15:30.906]  Well, then what you wind up with is after a couple of decades, you have this couple who is accused of stealing medical devices from the hospital where they worked.
[02:15:31.246 --> 02:15:39.849]  They took out a mortgage against their home, and then the cops seized the cash that they got from that mortgage, so then they still didn't have any way to defend themselves.
[02:15:39.869 --> 02:15:40.969]  I mean, I look at that and I say, well,
[02:15:41.409 --> 02:15:58.344]  If they really did steal all those medical devices, maybe they wouldn't need that mortgage against their homes to defend themselves, but that's the kind of dangerous situation that we get into when we allow ourselves, under whatever justification, to ignore due process and to allow the system to ignore it.
[02:15:59.269 --> 02:15:59.709]  That's right.
[02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:04.013]  And David, I just want to point out that these aren't few and far between issues.
[02:16:04.453 --> 02:16:07.916]  As a matter of fact, the ACLU just sued successfully.
[02:16:08.596 --> 02:16:26.230]  There was a little portion of road through Texas in Tannahaw County where it was found over a period of a short span of years that the same local police department down there was pulling over out-of-state license plates drivers and they were targeting specifically blacks and Hispanics.
[02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:37.179]  Seizing their properties and there were a thousand of those cases where police seized properties without due process and without, it turns out, any type of cause.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:43.865]  They were forced to pay, you know, some punitive measures for that and return properties in a lot of those cases.
[02:16:44.165 --> 02:16:51.512]  But a thousand, a thousand motorists pulled over for no reason except the police officers down there wanted to boost their revenues.
[02:16:51.852 --> 02:16:52.392]  Absolutely.
[02:16:52.613 --> 02:16:53.673]  That's a good way to put it.
[02:16:53.733 --> 02:16:56.575]  This is not a case of few and far between.
[02:16:57.216 --> 02:17:09.523]  We report so often on these abuses of police power and the new quote-unquote rules of engagement that they have against the American public where they shoot first and maybe never ask questions.
[02:17:09.563 --> 02:17:14.787]  We report on that so frequently that there's really kind of a fatigue that sets in because we keep talking about it.
[02:17:14.847 --> 02:17:17.008]  It's happening over and over again everywhere.
[02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:20.991]  And this is something that's being driven by the federal government, isn't it?
[02:17:21.738 --> 02:17:22.699]  Yes, it's a U.S.
[02:17:22.779 --> 02:17:27.264]  Marshals Office and a Department of Justice program that started years ago.
[02:17:27.284 --> 02:17:29.767]  And it just filters down to the local level.
[02:17:29.967 --> 02:17:33.371]  And, you know, local police officers, they have dwindling revenues.
[02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:39.438]  So they look at this as just an easy cash way to boost their revenues, buy some new equipment.
[02:17:40.378 --> 02:17:43.400]  You know, buy some more weapons, get some more training and so forth.
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:47.082]  And what's the biggest shame is that it rarely goes reported.
[02:17:47.362 --> 02:18:06.771]  There's been some investigative reports about civil forfeitures and so forth, but by and large these things are taking place in your backyard without your knowledge because when police report them on incident reports, they're only reported as, you know, they pull over a driver and it's a drug suspicion charge.
[02:18:07.171 --> 02:18:11.692]  So you don't really get the follow-up that people need to understand what's going on.
[02:18:12.572 --> 02:18:17.534]  You know, we just had a couple of Supreme Court cases come out just before we went on air.
[02:18:18.634 --> 02:18:22.055]  The one where they said the police may not search smartphones without a warrant.
[02:18:22.395 --> 02:18:30.057]  And we also had a federal court come out and say that the no-fly list is unconstitutional because it violates our rights to due process.
[02:18:30.417 --> 02:18:32.897]  How do you feel about those two decisions?
[02:18:32.917 --> 02:18:35.078]  Do you think we're starting to turn in the right direction and why?
[02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:41.314]  Well, I would say the cell phone one was a little bit of a shocker based on the 9-0 decision.
[02:18:41.334 --> 02:18:50.460]  It's very rare that the justice, you know, any Supreme Court reaches a 9-0 decision, especially this, you know, makeup of court justices.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:19:01.048]  So, I find that very heartening in this battle we have going on in our nation to turn back the cultural and political tide toward founding father intent.
[02:19:01.728 --> 02:19:06.090]  Um, you know, that's one case, and you mentioned the other one, I'm not as familiar as that one.
[02:19:06.351 --> 02:19:11.753]  Um, but those are two cases out of, what, 2,000 that we have going on in the nation.
[02:19:11.834 --> 02:19:16.056]  So, I guess if you put it in context of that, the battle's far from ended.
[02:19:16.216 --> 02:19:21.859]  They still make broad exceptions for all kinds of confiscations and searches that I don't think are in there.
[02:19:22.359 --> 02:19:28.561]  And when we come back from the break, I want to talk to you about the difference between rights and privileges.
[02:19:28.621 --> 02:19:38.105]  Because we've seen this both from Hillary Clinton and the remarks that she made about a small minority who believes that the Second Amendment is about an absolute right, that they're terrorizing the majority of Americans.
[02:19:38.125 --> 02:19:43.147]  And we've also seen Justice Scalia say that, hey, the Fourth Amendment isn't absolute.
[02:19:43.287 --> 02:19:45.648]  If it were, the TSA couldn't do what it's doing.
[02:19:45.928 --> 02:19:47.388]  Why is that upside down?
[02:19:47.648 --> 02:19:49.429]  So we're going to talk to Cheryl Chumley.
[02:19:49.749 --> 02:19:51.649]  Again, her book is Police State USA.
[02:19:51.709 --> 02:19:53.950]  It's carried at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:54.310 --> 02:19:58.491]  Great book about where we have gotten and maybe how we get out of this.
[02:19:58.511 --> 02:20:00.312]  So we're going to talk to Cheryl Chumley right after the break.
[02:20:00.332 --> 02:20:00.852]  We'll continue.
[02:20:09.594 --> 02:20:13.435]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[02:20:14.509 --> 02:20:15.370]  Not in America.
[02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:16.871]  This can't happen in America.
[02:20:17.211 --> 02:20:20.954]  Because of my concern about our government, I was looking at survival stuff.
[02:20:21.274 --> 02:20:24.357]  I was raised as a Girl Scout, and their motto was to be prepared.
[02:20:24.757 --> 02:20:30.001]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:33.924]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, because it's so good.
[02:20:33.944 --> 02:20:36.506]  I liked the pricing for what I got.
[02:20:36.926 --> 02:20:39.048]  I liked the containers they were shipped in.
[02:20:39.068 --> 02:20:40.569]  They keep in touch with you.
[02:20:40.589 --> 02:20:41.470]  You get your emails.
[02:20:41.490 --> 02:20:42.851]  You get your confirmations.
[02:20:43.251 --> 02:20:46.495]  The customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[02:20:47.076 --> 02:20:50.920]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.141]  And it just came so quick.
[02:20:52.221 --> 02:20:53.763]  It came right when they said it would come.
[02:20:53.823 --> 02:20:59.370]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.

[02:21:14.099 --> 02:21:17.200]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:19.281]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:21:19.561 --> 02:21:21.382]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:21:21.722 --> 02:21:23.164]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:21:23.364 --> 02:21:26.428]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:21:26.729 --> 02:21:36.982]  If so, consider the abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:21:37.342 --> 02:21:43.408]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.

[02:22:01.741 --> 02:22:02.881]  A sudden change in the wind.
[02:22:10.665 --> 02:22:16.690]  The day grows dark, as ominous clouds move in, and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[02:22:17.170 --> 02:22:19.872]  And you realize, you are not prepared.
[02:22:21.573 --> 02:22:25.336]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the US.
[02:22:25.616 --> 02:22:31.461]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[02:22:31.701 --> 02:22:34.343]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save you,
[02:22:34.443 --> 02:22:35.885]  And no one's coming to help them.
[02:22:36.025 --> 02:22:37.367]  You could be dead wrong.

[02:24:07.097 --> 02:24:07.417]  Go now.
[02:24:18.977 --> 02:24:20.298]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:20.398 --> 02:24:30.844]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Cheryl Trumley, author of Police State USA, a book that we carry here at Infowarsstore.com, about the burgeoning police state and the impacts.
[02:24:30.924 --> 02:24:32.525]  And why do we have this?
[02:24:32.846 --> 02:24:37.388]  What have we lost in terms of the understanding of our Constitution, of our rights?
[02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:41.871]  What have we lost in those terms to even have something like the police state?
[02:24:41.891 --> 02:24:44.973]  And just before the break we were talking about this Supreme Court decision.
[02:24:45.813 --> 02:24:52.959]  It aired just today, just before we went on air, saying that police may not search smartphones without a warrant.
[02:24:53.019 --> 02:25:01.145]  And they're saying that cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee's person.
[02:25:01.706 --> 02:25:13.254]  Now, unfortunately, the Supreme Court, in many years past, has given them a go-ahead to search wallets, purses, notepads, which I think are... I would include that under the Fourth Amendment.
[02:25:14.275 --> 02:25:18.519]  Certainly cell phones, as I said, are quantitatively and qualitatively different.
[02:25:18.539 --> 02:25:20.081]  A massive amount of information.
[02:25:20.561 --> 02:25:30.331]  I wonder if the Supreme Court justices are starting to realize that they themselves are prime targets for being blackmailed for surveillance.
[02:25:30.771 --> 02:25:33.192]  I mean, we've seen David Petraeus have to resign.
[02:25:33.753 --> 02:25:39.856]  A lot of people raised questions about how Chief Justice Roberts would write the Obamacare decision.
[02:25:40.216 --> 02:25:43.658]  He wrote both the dissenting decision and then abruptly turned around.
[02:25:43.698 --> 02:25:45.820]  Everybody was saying it was going to lose 5-4.
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:48.521]  Then he switched his vote and wrote the other opinion.
[02:25:48.541 --> 02:25:54.505]  A lot of us looked at that and said, hmm, I wonder if they found something on his cell phone or his computer to blackmail him with.
[02:25:54.525 --> 02:25:55.265]  What do you think, Cheryl?
[02:25:55.705 --> 02:25:56.446]  We can speculate.
[02:25:57.106 --> 02:26:00.808]  Well, yeah, I remember that talk, but it is curious.
[02:26:02.509 --> 02:26:18.218]  What I think your bigger point is, is something that I think if all lawmakers and all politicians, including court officials in this nation, were subjected to the exact same standards and exact same laws that average Americans would, most of this stuff would just go away.
[02:26:18.618 --> 02:26:25.502]  Just think, if President Obama's daughters had to go through the naked scanners at the TSA checkout points,
[02:26:25.842 --> 02:26:27.443]  How long will those scanners have stood?
[02:26:27.803 --> 02:26:29.024]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:26:29.484 --> 02:26:32.785]  And that's why I think that they're so concerned about cell phones.
[02:26:32.826 --> 02:26:35.807]  And we look at this and it's like, whoa, that's kind of an outlier.
[02:26:35.827 --> 02:26:43.571]  You know, especially as a unanimous decision that they somehow respect our privacy because that is something that does affect them, as you pointed out.
[02:26:44.091 --> 02:26:47.134]  We also have an article up on Infowars.com today.
[02:26:47.295 --> 02:26:51.860]  Overwhelming number of false matches to come from FBI biometric database.
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:56.244]  So, Cheryl, even though they're not looking at our cell phones, they're still tracking us.
[02:26:56.264 --> 02:27:01.150]  They're still recording our faces, our movements, and all other types of things about us.
[02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:05.514]  And what the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are concerned about
[02:27:06.315 --> 02:27:10.739]  Is that those are going to generate false positives, and you know what happens if you get a false positive?
[02:27:10.779 --> 02:27:14.062]  You might get a no-knock SWAT team raid at your house, right?
[02:27:14.962 --> 02:27:19.746]  Yeah, and just ask a Georgia family how that no-knock SWAT team raid goes.
[02:27:19.806 --> 02:27:22.529]  Their 19-month-old toddler is still in the hospital.
[02:27:22.729 --> 02:27:22.949]  Yes.
[02:27:22.989 --> 02:27:29.054]  Recovering from that flashbang grenade dropped in his crib a few weeks ago, blowing half his face off.
[02:27:29.494 --> 02:27:34.919]  You know, the police technology is something that I think all Americans need to really keep our eyes on.
[02:27:35.399 --> 02:27:42.547]  It's not just the government surveillance on social media websites and so forth and police.
[02:27:43.268 --> 02:27:51.557]  They're getting the latest military-grade technology that allows them to spy and record on Americans who aren't even suspected of any crimes.
[02:27:52.137 --> 02:27:55.881]  And if that's not a privacy hit, I don't know what the definition of one would be.
[02:27:56.602 --> 02:27:59.584]  And a good example of that is this stingray surveillance.
[02:28:00.144 --> 02:28:13.853]  I'm just amazed that even though the Supreme Court decision has said that they cannot put a tracking device, they cannot place it on a car, now these police departments have said, well that's okay, we don't need to place it
[02:28:14.173 --> 02:28:14.614]  on the show!
[02:28:34.512 --> 02:28:45.462]  Yeah, we can't get a judicial warrant because we've signed a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes this saying that we can't get a judge's warrant.
[02:28:46.272 --> 02:28:47.053]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:28:47.974 --> 02:28:54.701]  How is that constitutional in any definition of, you know, interpretation of our founding documents?
[02:28:55.362 --> 02:29:02.170]  It just amazes me what the federal government, the state governments, local governments, local police officers get away with now.
[02:29:02.210 --> 02:29:05.053]  And that's just a drop in the bucket of the technology that they have.
[02:29:05.273 --> 02:29:13.341]  You know, they have cameras and street lamps in certain cities that record movements and even audio of passers-by.
[02:29:13.361 --> 02:29:22.029]  And what happens is they send this video and audio to local police departments who scan all for the cause of rooting out terrorism.
[02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:31.440]  You know, I'm sure your readers and listeners and watchers know all about fusion centers around the nation and the data collection that goes on there.
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:37.388]  The reasons why, for how long this data is being collected, what it's being used for, nobody still knows.
[02:29:37.608 --> 02:29:37.968]  That's right.
[02:29:37.988 --> 02:29:41.550]  We've got to go to break, but we're going to come right back and we're going to talk a little bit about fusion centers.
[02:29:41.850 --> 02:29:43.171]  And we're going to talk about the solution.
[02:29:43.191 --> 02:29:45.332]  And I think you've got the right idea.
[02:29:45.352 --> 02:29:48.534]  It's that our rights come from God and not from government.
[02:29:48.554 --> 02:29:51.215]  If you want to call in and talk and ask a question to Cheryl, the number is 800-259-9231.
[02:29:51.275 --> 02:29:52.416]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:29:52.816 --> 02:29:58.259]  If you want to ask a question about the police state.
[02:29:58.559 --> 02:29:59.460]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:01.561]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.501 --> 02:30:05.163]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.494 --> 02:30:14.235]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:30:14.455 --> 02:30:17.556]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:30:17.816 --> 02:30:19.637]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:30:19.917 --> 02:30:21.838]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:30:22.078 --> 02:30:23.538]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:30:23.718 --> 02:30:26.759]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:30:27.039 --> 02:30:28.359]  If so, consider this.
[02:30:28.619 --> 02:30:37.542]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:30:37.902 --> 02:30:43.931]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:30:44.312 --> 02:30:45.934]  Forget synthetic chemicals.

[02:31:02.335 --> 02:31:03.456]  Live Life Healthy!
[02:31:09.736 --> 02:31:15.685]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:31:15.885 --> 02:31:20.091]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:31:20.452 --> 02:31:25.039]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:31:25.419 --> 02:31:28.042]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:31:28.342 --> 02:31:33.547]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:31:33.787 --> 02:31:40.673]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[02:31:41.194 --> 02:31:44.957]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:31:45.317 --> 02:31:50.102]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:50.422 --> 02:31:58.853]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[02:32:09.105 --> 02:32:16.167]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:16.267 --> 02:32:18.428]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:18.608 --> 02:32:23.729]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:23.889 --> 02:32:28.831]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:29.071 --> 02:32:32.132]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:32.392 --> 02:32:36.254]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:36.454 --> 02:32:40.695]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:40.775 --> 02:32:50.799]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:50.999 --> 02:32:53.520]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:54.581]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:54.601 --> 02:32:56.041]  Because there is a war on.
[02:32:56.061 --> 02:32:56.602]  Or you're mine.
[02:33:21.032 --> 02:33:21.473]  I don't know.
[02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:30.630]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:30.690 --> 02:33:35.573]  I'm David Knight and I'm talking to Cheryl Chumley, author of the book Police State USA.
[02:33:36.474 --> 02:33:39.516]  How Orwell's nightmare is becoming our reality.
[02:33:39.536 --> 02:33:41.977]  And of course that's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:42.037 --> 02:33:48.641]  And before I get back to Cheryl, I want to tell you that this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.
[02:33:48.661 --> 02:33:54.705]  You know, the collapse of the border and soaring meat prices make it clear that there's no longer any time to wait.
[02:33:55.126 --> 02:33:56.587]  You need to start getting prepared today.
[02:33:57.327 --> 02:34:01.310]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com and check out their complete line of preparedness products.

[02:34:06.494 --> 02:34:10.397]  If you don't have food, you are no threat to the New World Order.
[02:34:10.437 --> 02:34:14.920]  They're counting on you to be ever-dependent slaves to their system of control, but you can fight back.
[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:25.228]  You can establish independence for yourself and your family by securing your own private supply of storable food, and there's no better way to prepare than this Patriot-owned company.

[02:34:47.856 --> 02:34:55.858]  Now, Cheryl, just before the break we were talking about the police state and what we can do to roll this back.
[02:34:55.898 --> 02:34:58.759]  And I think there's not an easy answer, is there?
[02:34:58.779 --> 02:35:00.560]  But you've got it on the back of your book.
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:04.541]  You say, our rights come from God and not from government.
[02:35:04.721 --> 02:35:08.142]  I think that's the key realization that people have to come to.
[02:35:09.212 --> 02:35:10.313]  That's exactly right.
[02:35:10.494 --> 02:35:12.917]  And to me, that's the biggest premise of my book.
[02:35:12.977 --> 02:35:17.803]  I don't beat people over the head with it, but you know, our nation was founded on that principle.
[02:35:17.843 --> 02:35:20.046]  That's what makes us the greatest nation in the world.
[02:35:20.506 --> 02:35:21.808]  Our rights come from God.
[02:35:21.828 --> 02:35:24.191]  They don't come from bureaucrats on Capitol Hill.
[02:35:24.572 --> 02:35:26.234]  And I think of people, first off,
[02:35:26.794 --> 02:35:43.090]  Uh, you know, drilled that into their minds and into their hearts, then it would just result in this dramatic mindset change that sweeps the nation and will put politicians back in their place, their rightful role as servants of the people, their employees.
[02:35:43.431 --> 02:35:45.613]  And that includes the President of the United States.
[02:35:45.973 --> 02:35:46.273]  That's right.
[02:35:46.293 --> 02:35:48.836]  You know, people are always looking for an easy fix, aren't they?
[02:35:48.856 --> 02:35:55.243]  They're always saying, well, you know, we need to pass this kind of law or make this kind of change or get this person elected.
[02:35:55.343 --> 02:36:00.388]  And, you know, the elections are pretty heavily rigged and they're pretty dishonest and slippery.
[02:36:00.448 --> 02:36:03.191]  I mean, just look at the thing with Thad Cochran yesterday.
[02:36:03.231 --> 02:36:06.434]  I mean, that doesn't do much to restore my faith in elections.
[02:36:07.535 --> 02:36:08.716]  It's not that simple.
[02:36:08.736 --> 02:36:12.138]  There's not a simple fix of getting a person elected somewhere.
[02:36:12.278 --> 02:36:18.822]  There needs to be a fundamental understanding of people about the difference between rights and privileges.
[02:36:19.303 --> 02:36:22.645]  And also about the role of government.
[02:36:23.465 --> 02:36:25.667]  It's just not an easy fix with an external thing.
[02:36:25.687 --> 02:36:30.710]  There has to be a massive understanding, a massive point of view change of the American people.
[02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:38.773]  That's exactly true, and I think that's why you also need to teach your kids the Constitution, because the school systems aren't doing it.
[02:36:39.253 --> 02:36:42.974]  At least that way, you know, when you read the Constitution, it takes, what, a half hour?
[02:36:43.594 --> 02:36:51.477]  At least if you're aware of what the Constitution states, you can watch the evening news, read the daily newspapers, and see how far we've strayed.
[02:36:51.537 --> 02:36:54.858]  So at least you can know where the battle starts.
[02:36:54.878 --> 02:36:59.560]  So that's a core provision if you're trying to fight to turn this country back.
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:08.046]  You know, we've got an article today on Infowars.com about the overwhelming number of false matches that are going to be coming from an FBI biometric database.
[02:37:08.066 --> 02:37:14.631]  We talked about it earlier, Steve Watson article, and he quoted from a letter from the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[02:37:15.211 --> 02:37:20.895]  And they said, the capacity of the FBI to collect and retain information, even on innocent Americans, has grown exponentially.
[02:37:20.915 --> 02:37:23.157]  And this is the part that I like right here.
[02:37:23.177 --> 02:37:37.667]  It said, it's essential for the American public to have a complete picture of all the programs and authorities the FBI uses to track our daily lives and an understanding of how those programs affect our civil rights and civil liberties.
[02:37:37.727 --> 02:37:40.049]  And when I saw that, I bracketed that and I said, you know,
[02:37:40.769 --> 02:37:42.550]  That's what we're trying to do here at InfoWars.
[02:37:42.610 --> 02:37:44.050]  That's what I think your book is doing.
[02:37:44.070 --> 02:38:03.238]  We're trying to give people a complete picture of where we are, what we've lost, and the fundamental basis for what we had the government created for in the first place, and that is that we have certain inalienable rights that we possess from God as human beings, and that the government can't take those things away.
[02:38:04.181 --> 02:38:04.621]  That's right.
[02:38:04.722 --> 02:38:07.985]  They can't take them away unless we let the government take them away.
[02:38:08.045 --> 02:38:09.806]  And that's where we're fighting right now.
[02:38:10.307 --> 02:38:21.357]  And you know, as things move farther left, as our next generation of children in public schools are taught that government is the solution to all, as our borders remain completely unsecured and we let people
[02:38:21.357 --> 02:38:31.586]  People who are poor in this nation, who have no concept of what a constitution republic is supposed to look like, you know, it won't be but a few years before the balance in this nation shifts.
[02:38:31.846 --> 02:38:37.211]  And, you know, making the case with political elections, it's going to be a lost cause.
[02:38:37.731 --> 02:38:47.060]  So, you know, you need to stop funding the main parties, teach the constitution, and start some real grassroots swell to bring this nation back under control.
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:53.449]  And you know, it's not just the people who are coming into this country, the foreign people that are being left in.
[02:38:53.990 --> 02:39:00.800]  Young people who are 13, 14, 15 years old coming in without any concept of God-given rights.
[02:39:01.241 --> 02:39:03.204]  It's our own Supreme Court justices.
[02:39:03.464 --> 02:39:10.589]  And people like Hillary Clinton, who don't have any concept of that, or who know what it is and are trying to speak against it.
[02:39:10.649 --> 02:39:17.694]  As I pointed out before, Justice Scalia said, hey, you don't have any absolute protections under the Fourth Amendment.
[02:39:17.834 --> 02:39:22.237]  If we did, then the TSA couldn't be doing what they're doing to you in the airport.
[02:39:22.257 --> 02:39:31.283]  So here's a guy who's supposedly a strict constitutionalist, somebody who's supposedly a conservative, essentially sounding the same as Hillary Clinton on the Second Amendment.
[02:39:31.323 --> 02:39:40.426]  And of course, when Hillary Clinton says that people who hold viewpoints that rights are absolute are terrorists, she's essentially coming after the First Amendment as well.
[02:39:41.546 --> 02:39:49.548]  Yeah, you know, your quote that you just said about Scalia, if that's the best we got, then, you know, really, we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:39:49.688 --> 02:39:50.028]  We are.
[02:39:50.048 --> 02:39:53.489]  It's going to be a hard fight.
[02:39:53.829 --> 02:39:54.210]  That's right.
[02:39:54.470 --> 02:39:55.570]  Let's go to a couple of calls.
[02:39:55.890 --> 02:39:58.031]  We open this up for questions.
[02:39:58.091 --> 02:39:58.951]  Hunter in Arizona.
[02:39:58.991 --> 02:39:59.191]  Hunter?
[02:40:00.717 --> 02:40:02.178]  Hey David, great job today on the show.
[02:40:02.238 --> 02:40:03.099]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:40:03.199 --> 02:40:03.480]  Thank you.
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:04.240]  What did you want to say?
[02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:05.241]  Do you have a question?
[02:40:05.261 --> 02:40:06.302]  Yeah, I just had a quick question.
[02:40:06.322 --> 02:40:08.745]  I'm going to throw it out there and then I'll hang up and listen to your answer.
[02:40:08.885 --> 02:40:14.390]  Is the Sheriff of Sacramento County now in violation of law based on the most recent Supreme Court decision?
[02:40:14.850 --> 02:40:15.351]  Thank you very much.
[02:40:16.303 --> 02:40:22.008]  What he's referring to is the sheriff in Sacramento County using Stingray and other things.
[02:40:22.609 --> 02:40:31.998]  Now that we see that the Supreme Court says, hey, your cell phone has got a qualitative and quantitative difference from other things we've allowed to be searched when people are arrested.
[02:40:32.498 --> 02:40:34.099]  But that's got too much information on it.
[02:40:34.179 --> 02:40:37.161]  That needs to be included in Fourth Amendment protections.
[02:40:37.581 --> 02:40:40.943]  So how does the NSA justify what they're doing?
[02:40:40.983 --> 02:40:48.327]  How do police departments that are tracking people with Stingray and other devices and monitoring people in many different ways, how do they justify that?
[02:40:48.367 --> 02:40:49.288]  What do you think, Cheryl?
[02:40:49.488 --> 02:40:52.530]  Is that going to create some kind of an opening here for liberty?
[02:40:53.210 --> 02:41:05.319]  Well, you know, the federal government is pretty skilled at making the case that it's all in the name of security, that they need to do all this spy technology to secure Americans from future terrorist threats.
[02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:12.425]  You know, against that backdrop though, you can look at all the information that they've uncovered and all the spying they've done in recent years.
[02:41:13.185 --> 02:41:14.886]  It's not aligned with terrorism.
[02:41:14.926 --> 02:41:25.993]  There have been Capitol Hill hearings to show that some of these data centers set up around America in the name of combating terrorism don't give any worthwhile terrorist-related info at all.
[02:41:26.393 --> 02:41:29.375]  They've been using them more to fight crimes.
[02:41:29.935 --> 02:41:44.108]  So, you know, if people would be more aware of that, that it's not a battle of terrorism anymore, it's more used to justify fighting crimes, maybe in smaller communities we'll have a better chance of fighting local government officials to scale back police departments.
[02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:49.834]  That's right, and of course, as we pointed out here, we covered the MIAC report release about the Fusion Center that said that
[02:41:50.534 --> 02:41:59.076]  The people that the police department need to be concerned about were people who had voted for Ron Paul or some other third-party candidates.
[02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:03.677]  If you see a bumper sticker on the car of these candidates, those are the people you need to be worried about.
[02:42:03.697 --> 02:42:10.499]  And we've seen over and over again that they say they're not worried about Islamists, but they're worried about homegrown domestic terrorists.
[02:42:10.999 --> 02:42:18.965]  People who believe that their rights come from God, that they do have absolute rights, and that's part of what makes what Hillary Clinton said so chilling.
[02:42:19.225 --> 02:42:25.490]  Just by itself, if it wasn't in the context of these other remarks, you could say, well, you know, she's saying that they're scaring people.
[02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:27.612]  No, when she uses the word terrorizing,
[02:42:28.132 --> 02:42:37.315]  She's using that to move that narrative along to say that people who believe that their rights come from God and not from government are terrorists.
[02:42:37.375 --> 02:42:41.777]  That's what we've seen in all these different scenarios and I think that's clearly what she was saying.
[02:42:41.817 --> 02:42:43.558]  Let's go to Susan in Missouri.
[02:42:43.598 --> 02:42:43.858]  Susan.
[02:42:45.729 --> 02:43:03.480]  I wanted to thank you and Alex and Cheryl for everything you do and how you're waking people up and right now there's so much treasonous information coming out with whistleblowers and exposure from people like you thankfully.
[02:43:04.504 --> 02:43:16.748]  Um, but it's amazing to people that are aware of all this that there are others that are still walking around as if in some kind of zombie apocalypse.
[02:43:17.668 --> 02:43:21.790]  And I mean, what, what do we do to wake these people up?
[02:43:21.890 --> 02:43:24.370]  Or is there just no hope for these people?
[02:43:24.390 --> 02:43:26.091]  Cheryl, you want to take that?
[02:43:26.926 --> 02:43:27.867]  Yeah, I'm like you.
[02:43:27.927 --> 02:43:36.933]  I don't understand people when they think it's crazy to say that we're a police state in America right now, you know, or that the government encroaches too far.
[02:43:37.273 --> 02:43:38.774]  I don't understand the mentality.
[02:43:38.794 --> 02:43:43.237]  I think there's a certain segment of our nation that is going to be happy in ignorance.
[02:43:43.878 --> 02:43:45.239]  And, you know, all you can do is
[02:43:46.107 --> 02:43:51.072]  You know, fight your own fight and pray to God that, you know, you make a difference in this nation.
[02:43:51.512 --> 02:44:01.583]  You know, I remember when the Boston bombing took place and they had the police going door to door, pulling guns on people and having them march out of their homes with their hands in the air.
[02:44:02.203 --> 02:44:03.204]  We reported on that.
[02:44:03.404 --> 02:44:04.465]  Dan Benanti was there.
[02:44:04.485 --> 02:44:06.427]  And I remember as that was going on,
[02:44:07.088 --> 02:44:12.112]  We had a guy who was attacking Dan, attacking us, ridiculing him.
[02:44:12.233 --> 02:44:16.997]  I remember Rob Doo going on and talking to this guy, and this guy just insisted that this wasn't happening.
[02:44:17.437 --> 02:44:20.780]  And I thought, that is the most amazing example.
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:23.843]  As he's talking to Rob Doo, we're playing the video clips.
[02:44:24.543 --> 02:44:26.104]  of exactly what we're talking about.
[02:44:26.124 --> 02:44:27.284]  And he said, that's not happening.
[02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:28.265]  We don't have a police state here.
[02:44:28.285 --> 02:44:31.806]  I mean, you talk about being in an extreme case of denial.
[02:44:32.467 --> 02:44:34.968]  That was about as bad as I've ever seen.
[02:44:34.988 --> 02:44:49.274]  I was just like shaking my head in disbelief that somebody could be that ignorant, that much in denial, that much of a servant, a servile slave to the government, that they just couldn't believe that their government was capable of doing something like that.
[02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:56.146]  Yeah, you had Mark Binney, who worked for the NSA for over 40 years, resign a few years ago.
[02:44:56.166 --> 02:45:00.389]  And his big reason was, he said, we are living in a police state.
[02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:05.794]  So somebody on the front lines of government surveillance, you know, like that, calls it a police state.
[02:45:05.874 --> 02:45:07.755]  I certainly don't think it's crazy to agree.
[02:45:08.556 --> 02:45:29.205]  Yes, he was head of the Global Head of Technology for the NSA, and we interviewed him on this show, and he said, that was William Binney, he said, I have watched for decades, he worked for them for over 30 years, he said, I've watched for decades what's going on, what went on in East Germany, in the Soviet Union, and he said, that is what is happening here now.
[02:45:29.705 --> 02:45:37.448]  He had said about six to nine months earlier, he said, we're this close to a police state, held his fingers very close to each other, but at that point he was saying, we are.
[02:45:37.888 --> 02:45:38.528]  In a police state.
[02:45:38.548 --> 02:45:40.749]  There is absolutely no doubt about it.
[02:45:40.789 --> 02:45:42.929]  Let's go to Fred in Nevada.
[02:45:42.949 --> 02:45:43.210]  Fred?
[02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:45.470]  Hi, how are you?
[02:45:45.490 --> 02:45:46.210]  Doing good.
[02:45:46.450 --> 02:45:47.031]  What's your question?
[02:45:47.331 --> 02:45:47.591]  Good.
[02:45:48.211 --> 02:45:48.411]  Good.
[02:45:48.751 --> 02:46:00.915]  My question is, how can the police department make an agreement with the Stingray device or the manufacturer, it's non-disclosure, if it violates what the Constitution says?
[02:46:01.355 --> 02:46:03.755]  Because that would be an unenforceable contract.
[02:46:03.995 --> 02:46:05.696]  If you and I made a deal for me to buy
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:07.540]  Uh, cocaine from you.
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:09.321]  I take the cocaine and don't pay you.
[02:46:09.341 --> 02:46:11.201]  I mean, how are you going to sue me?
[02:46:11.802 --> 02:46:24.985]  It's, it's an illegal contract to begin with, but it seems that the same laws that are supposed to apply apply to everyone in our country, including the president or a dog catcher has changed.
[02:46:25.805 --> 02:46:34.008]  And when they're allowed to violate the law and not accountable for their actions, then you have what our founding fathers feared the most.
[02:46:34.208 --> 02:46:34.928]  And we become,
[02:46:36.549 --> 02:46:47.916]  A country that has really become lawless, and I hate to use the term banana republic, but that's really what it's headed toward, but we're so much far ahead of
[02:46:48.927 --> 02:46:54.051]  I think we're far more dangerous than the Banana Republic because our government is far more powerful.
[02:46:54.832 --> 02:47:11.325]  As I mentioned earlier in the program, the Asymmetric Warfare Group, when they were talking about supporting these different governments throughout the Middle East, they said, if we're going to get involved in a counterinsurgency, trying to put that down, how do we determine which of these governments are legitimate?
[02:47:11.365 --> 02:47:15.388]  And he said, well, one of the ways that you look at that is how much security
[02:47:15.988 --> 02:47:18.791]  Do they need to apply in order to maintain stability?
[02:47:18.831 --> 02:47:22.233]  And by that yardstick, I would say that we are a banana republic.
[02:47:22.253 --> 02:47:24.115]  But Cheryl, what about accountability?
[02:47:24.155 --> 02:47:26.837]  What do we do to hold these police departments accountable?
[02:47:27.958 --> 02:47:33.903]  Well, police departments still have to go through local county governments and county boards for their funding.
[02:47:33.943 --> 02:47:44.092]  So you can certainly attend some of your local county and city meetings and make your case, you know, petition your local representatives to rein in some of these police powers.
[02:47:44.472 --> 02:48:00.962]  There have been a couple of news stories in recent weeks that have shown people who do just that have alerted the county officials to some of these police devices that they want to buy and the city councils have said no and put a stop to it.
[02:48:01.042 --> 02:48:04.504]  So there is some action that Americans can take.
[02:48:04.884 --> 02:48:05.284]  Exactly.
[02:48:05.304 --> 02:48:10.826]  In a lot of places, I think what you're talking about, where they want to bring in MRAP vehicles into very small towns.
[02:48:10.846 --> 02:48:22.730]  I mean, close to where I live, there's a community just outside of Austin and there's a body shop there that had this big sign up complaining about the deficit and how many trillions of dollars it was.
[02:48:22.770 --> 02:48:24.930]  And then I needed some body work done on my car.
[02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:33.493]  I looked them up on the internet and they're bragging about how they donated a paint job to the police department that just got a new MRAP.
[02:48:34.133 --> 02:48:43.898]  And it's like, why does my small town need a mind-proof vehicle that they're using in places like Afghanistan and Iraq?
[02:48:44.518 --> 02:48:52.102]  Everybody ought to be asking themselves that question, and if this guy is worried about the deficit, he ought to definitely ask himself that question.
[02:48:52.202 --> 02:48:55.964]  That's the kind of cognitive dissonance that we need to try to get to.
[02:48:55.984 --> 02:49:02.908]  That's why I really welcome a book like yours that not only breaks this down for people and helps them to understand, as you pointed out earlier, these are not
[02:49:03.348 --> 02:49:08.390]  Few and far between but this is a pervasive pattern that is happening all over this country.
[02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:18.833]  Only places where we've seen this stopped is in a few places like New Hampshire and other places where they saw that the police department was going to get one of these vehicles and they said we don't want that here.
[02:49:19.273 --> 02:49:22.034]  We don't want that donated to our police department.
[02:49:22.134 --> 02:49:27.736]  People have to get involved there but I think Cheryl there's also the another kind of accountability and that is when we see these
[02:49:28.416 --> 02:49:40.951]  Kind of, uh, interactions between the police and the public that are now becoming commonplace, where they shoot with tasers, or just like they killed that 95-year-old World War II veteran, uh, with a beanbag shotgun at a close range.
[02:49:40.971 --> 02:49:43.514]  They tried to shoot him with a taser, and they didn't get him with a taser.
[02:49:44.114 --> 02:49:51.460]  We see that the police do not want to physically engage people, and they would rather kill somebody than take the risk that they're going to get a punch in the face.
[02:49:52.081 --> 02:49:56.704]  And we see that being encouraged by the federal government with new rules of engagement.
[02:49:56.744 --> 02:50:03.169]  Out in Albuquerque, New Mexico, they actually have the state police academy teaching a shoot first curriculum.
[02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:08.574]  That's the way one of the police instructors described it before he resigned in protest, refusing to teach that to people.
[02:50:10.012 --> 02:50:19.162]  Yeah, it's ridiculous because most people remember it was just a few short years ago that your local police department were tasked with the mission of serve and protect.
[02:50:19.623 --> 02:50:24.689]  They were the friendly officers, you know, that would engage with the public, chat.
[02:50:24.769 --> 02:50:30.155]  They knew who people were in their neighborhoods and on their beats and so forth.
[02:50:30.595 --> 02:50:43.607]  And now the entire mindset of local police departments have shifted to one of intimidation and aggression, where, you know, even the most innocent of Americans walking down the street is a suspect for something that may occur.
[02:50:44.107 --> 02:50:50.253]  And this mindset is really something that should be alarming to most Americans because what it was about...
[02:50:50.413 --> 02:50:52.255]  We've got to take a break, and we're going to come right back.
[02:50:52.335 --> 02:51:03.125]  And I think there also needs to be an accountability to the police department itself and to the officers, or you're going to wind up with a situation just like we have at the borders, where they're told that they can get away with it, so they do it.
[02:51:03.406 --> 02:51:05.708]  And that's what's happening at the police departments over and over again.
[02:51:06.028 --> 02:51:06.449]  Stay with us.
[02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:09.191]  We're going to be right back with Cheryl Chumley, Police State USA.
[02:51:09.512 --> 02:51:12.675]  Every business owner knows how tough it is to get financing for their business.
[02:51:12.915 --> 02:51:13.355]  We're good to go.
[02:51:34.989 --> 02:51:40.911]  If you've been in business for six months and produce at least $15,000 in monthly sales, there's a good chance you'll qualify.
[02:51:41.071 --> 02:51:42.291]  And talk about hassle-free.
[02:51:42.471 --> 02:51:45.712]  We don't need to see your tax returns, financial statements, or business plans.

[02:52:03.298 --> 02:52:15.662]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:52:16.062 --> 02:52:17.062]  Security alert.
[02:52:17.282 --> 02:52:19.043]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:52:19.283 --> 02:52:22.864]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[02:52:22.884 --> 02:52:25.765]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[02:52:25.865 --> 02:52:27.827]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:52:27.847 --> 02:52:28.807]  Prime Directive.
[02:52:28.887 --> 02:52:30.268]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:52:30.449 --> 02:52:33.231]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:52:33.291 --> 02:52:36.393]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:52:36.553 --> 02:52:38.775]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:52:38.835 --> 02:52:40.356]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:52:40.396 --> 02:52:42.698]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:52:43.178 --> 02:52:44.839]  They're never going to stop.
[02:52:45.139 --> 02:52:49.040]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:57.682]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:52:57.722 --> 02:53:02.004]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:53:08.693 --> 02:53:12.134]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:53:12.355 --> 02:53:16.076]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:53:16.176 --> 02:53:22.098]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:53:22.358 --> 02:53:32.442]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:53:32.562 --> 02:53:34.243]  Take back control of your health.
[02:53:34.343 --> 02:53:37.044]  With Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragenics.

[02:53:47.387 --> 02:53:58.910]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.
[02:53:59.090 --> 02:53:59.770]  Call Terragenics.
[02:53:59.850 --> 02:54:00.352]  We're good.
[02:54:14.355 --> 02:54:15.637]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:15.737 --> 02:54:16.458]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:16.498 --> 02:54:22.947]  I'm joined on the phone with Cheryl Chumley, author of Police State USA, a book that we sell here at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:54:23.748 --> 02:54:29.757]  As we're talking, I keep going back to this letter from the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[02:54:30.678 --> 02:54:47.100]  Talking about this new FBI biometric data system and they said it's essential for the American public to have a complete picture of all the programs and authorities that the FBI uses to track our daily lives and an understanding of how those programs affect our civil rights and civil liberties.
[02:54:47.941 --> 02:54:48.621]  That's very true.
[02:54:48.641 --> 02:54:49.902]  That's what this book is about.
[02:54:49.942 --> 02:54:51.303]  That's what InfoWars is about.
[02:54:51.343 --> 02:54:54.325]  We're trying to get people to understand what is happening.
[02:54:54.365 --> 02:54:56.766]  To get a complete picture of what's happening.
[02:54:57.206 --> 02:55:02.649]  And then to also understand, as she points out here, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[02:55:03.049 --> 02:55:03.990]  They're not privileges.
[02:55:04.370 --> 02:55:06.251]  They are, in fact, absolute.
[02:55:06.291 --> 02:55:09.393]  And if that terrorizes Hillary Clinton, then so be it.
[02:55:09.853 --> 02:55:12.954]  Because that's what our Constitution, what our Declaration of Independence says.
[02:55:13.454 --> 02:55:23.336]  We possess certain rights as individuals and if we don't understand what those are and how they're being taken away, we are just going to become sheep for the system.
[02:55:24.296 --> 02:55:26.917]  We're taking some of your calls for Cheryl.
[02:55:27.157 --> 02:55:29.277]  Let's go to Gerald in Arkansas.
[02:55:29.317 --> 02:55:32.158]  Gerald, it says that you're a vet and you want to talk about the Constitution.
[02:55:32.198 --> 02:55:33.398]  Go ahead, give us your question.
[02:55:34.033 --> 02:55:35.855]  Yes, you guys are doing a great job.
[02:55:36.015 --> 02:55:39.299]  I am a full supporter of what you guys are doing.
[02:55:39.339 --> 02:55:40.660]  And it is an info war.
[02:55:40.881 --> 02:55:41.762]  Yes.
[02:55:42.022 --> 02:55:45.205]  You got to do your homework and our rights come from God.
[02:55:45.886 --> 02:55:48.409]  And that's what we, it's not taught in schools anymore.
[02:55:49.338 --> 02:55:53.760]  You refer to the... I believe we need to quit referring to this as our government.
[02:55:53.860 --> 02:56:00.043]  It's a corporate government that the bankers control through the private Federal Reserve banking system.
[02:56:00.083 --> 02:56:04.906]  Now you guys know all about that, but the average public doesn't, David and Cheryl.
[02:56:05.366 --> 02:56:10.529]  Now the other thing that I have not seen brought up... I was fortunate.
[02:56:10.629 --> 02:56:14.771]  One of my tutors was a law barrister.
[02:56:14.911 --> 02:56:16.191]  The word barrister is
[02:56:19.177 --> 02:56:23.861]  We're still under common law, but you won't see that taught.
[02:56:24.021 --> 02:56:25.462]  An attorney is not a lawyer.
[02:56:25.682 --> 02:56:28.224]  An attorney comes from the French word for torn.
[02:56:28.604 --> 02:56:31.406]  It means take from the people and give to the landowner.
[02:56:31.827 --> 02:56:43.816]  So to be a lawyer, a true lawyer, a barrister, you have to study common law and understand that our rights come from God through the common law that the founding fathers set up.
[02:56:44.389 --> 02:56:48.010]  Now you can put this in your Google, I wish more people would do it.
[02:56:48.490 --> 02:56:54.531]  Under Uniform Commercial Code, 1-103-6 Common Law.
[02:56:55.031 --> 02:57:07.513]  It says Common Law is still in effect, we just don't see people educating themselves that you can bring a Common Law Act in which actually trumps the statute commercial realm.
[02:57:08.193 --> 02:57:10.513]  Do you want to comment on that Cheryl?
[02:57:10.553 --> 02:57:13.614]  Talk about where our rights come from and how we get them back?
[02:57:14.591 --> 02:57:17.812]  Well, definitely, of course, our rights come from God.
[02:57:17.892 --> 02:57:28.537]  I'll have to Google what it was that he was mentioning, but going back to the Federal Reserve and so forth, you know, we could overcome quite a bit of government encroachment if we did return to the gold standard.
[02:57:29.117 --> 02:57:34.099]  And, you know, we stopped, you know, the economic tearing that's going on in our nation, too.
[02:57:34.839 --> 02:57:35.819]  Yes, yes, thank you.
[02:57:35.859 --> 02:57:36.920]  Thank you, Gerald Arkansas.
[02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:38.801]  Let's go to Tom in Maryland.
[02:57:39.381 --> 02:57:39.541]  Tom?
[02:57:41.738 --> 02:57:42.438]  Good afternoon.
[02:57:42.859 --> 02:57:44.159]  Thank you so much, Ms.
[02:57:44.199 --> 02:57:45.500]  Chumley, for writing your book.
[02:57:47.241 --> 02:58:03.430]  I'm a former retired police detective, and police who are weak in character, lacking in knowledge, and of weak moral stock will blatantly break departmental rules, general orders, and the law.
[02:58:04.270 --> 02:58:09.513]  As far as a remedy, a good place, in my opinion, to start as far as
[02:58:10.376 --> 02:58:30.426]  Getting police departments acting right is to weed out these pipes and start looking for and hiring and making it a priority to hire folks who are looking for a profession they feel called to as an honorable duty and not just looking for a job.
[02:58:30.816 --> 02:58:31.556]  Very well said.
[02:58:31.616 --> 02:58:32.436]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:32.456 --> 02:58:34.557]  It's Tom in Maryland, retired police detective.
[02:58:35.257 --> 02:58:35.957]  We're out of time.
[02:58:35.977 --> 02:58:37.578]  We're going to have Cheryl respond to you.
[02:58:37.718 --> 02:58:39.678]  Cheryl Trumley, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:39.979 --> 02:58:40.479]  Great book.
[02:58:40.639 --> 02:58:46.740]  People need to understand what is happening and they need to understand how we roll this back and it's not an easy answer.
[02:58:46.760 --> 02:58:48.761]  We have to change the way we view our rights.
[02:58:48.981 --> 02:58:50.101]  Thank you very much for joining us.
[02:58:50.121 --> 02:58:50.982]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:51.002 --> 02:58:51.522]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:51.562 --> 02:58:53.982]  I'm going to take some more calls right after we come back in Overdrive.
[02:58:54.042 --> 02:58:58.904]  I'm going to try to get a hold of Jim in West Virginia, Jay in Wisconsin, Michael in Louisiana.
[02:58:59.924 --> 02:59:01.685]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:59:02.226 --> 02:59:09.190]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:59:09.651 --> 02:59:20.078]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:59:20.498 --> 02:59:29.704]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:59:30.444 --> 02:59:33.866]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:59:34.506 --> 02:59:37.927]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:59:38.267 --> 02:59:39.808]  Experience the new formula.
[02:59:40.328 --> 02:59:42.289]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:59:42.889 --> 02:59:43.849]  Shield your family.
[02:59:44.229 --> 02:59:45.610]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:59:46.050 --> 02:59:48.091]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:53.193]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:00:00.109 --> 03:00:01.249]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.630 --> 03:00:02.930]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.690 --> 03:00:07.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.215 --> 03:00:15.895]  Big Brother.
[03:00:16.535 --> 03:00:17.576]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:18.296 --> 03:00:19.396]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:20.057 --> 03:00:20.817]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.636 --> 03:00:22.498]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.518 --> 03:00:26.888]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.389 --> 03:00:31.417]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.959 --> 03:00:35.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:39.783]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and I just want to take a few more calls in overdrive.
[03:00:39.803 --> 03:00:42.305]  Some people have called in to talk about the police state.
[03:00:42.425 --> 03:00:45.307]  We were talking about Cheryl Chumley's book, Police State USA.
[03:00:46.248 --> 03:00:51.532]  People need to get the big picture, and they need to understand the foundations of our country.
[03:00:52.052 --> 03:00:56.676]  The foundations of their rights, and that is that our rights are absolute.
[03:00:56.996 --> 03:00:59.538]  If they're not absolute, they're not rights, they're privileges.
[03:00:59.618 --> 03:01:01.299]  They're government-granted privileges.
[03:01:01.559 --> 03:01:03.021]  They're suggested privileges.
[03:01:03.341 --> 03:01:07.424]  That's why the Second Amendment says, shall not be infringed.
[03:01:07.684 --> 03:01:11.887]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:01:11.927 --> 03:01:14.930]  They knew that it would be a gradual, incremental process.
[03:01:15.430 --> 03:01:20.535]  And that's what we've been talking about, the difference between rights and privileges and how out of control our government is now.
[03:01:20.835 --> 03:01:21.776]  Let's take a couple of calls.
[03:01:21.796 --> 03:01:22.997]  We've got Jay in Wisconsin.
[03:01:23.037 --> 03:01:24.399]  Jay, what did you want to say?
[03:01:24.419 --> 03:01:26.841]  Hi, I called.
[03:01:27.862 --> 03:01:29.603]  First, I want to say, how are you?
[03:01:29.824 --> 03:01:30.905]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:31.105 --> 03:01:31.865]  Thank you for calling.
[03:01:33.195 --> 03:01:36.538]  Um, I called because I wanted to talk about the book.
[03:01:36.998 --> 03:01:38.419]  Um, I had a question.
[03:01:38.499 --> 03:01:40.040]  Well, more so of a comment.
[03:01:40.201 --> 03:01:49.328]  I'm starting to see what she was, what you guys were talking about throughout the book about the police state and my state with the security cameras over the highway.
[03:01:49.448 --> 03:01:53.891]  And you know, they're like, they're everywhere and they're really present.
[03:01:54.011 --> 03:01:55.632]  You can see them very closely.
[03:01:55.692 --> 03:01:57.053]  They're not hidden anymore.
[03:01:57.093 --> 03:02:02.618]  And, um, the news stations here are starting to talk about a lot of things that you guys are reporting now.
[03:02:04.019 --> 03:02:06.482]  I did want to make one comment before I hang up the phone.
[03:02:07.363 --> 03:02:08.184]  I had a question.
[03:02:08.244 --> 03:02:17.255]  Did you notice that on World Net Daily, Obama forfeited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem to the Pope?
[03:02:17.275 --> 03:02:18.516]  I haven't seen that article.
[03:02:18.657 --> 03:02:19.578]  I'm not familiar with that.
[03:02:20.287 --> 03:02:22.168]  Yep, it's on the World Net Daily.
[03:02:22.408 --> 03:02:27.831]  And I think a lot of what's going on with that has to do with the police state here.
[03:02:27.851 --> 03:02:31.852]  Well, I'll tell you, you say that everybody is talking about it in the mainstream media now.
[03:02:32.073 --> 03:02:33.533]  It is no longer escapable.
[03:02:33.753 --> 03:02:36.635]  It has become so blatant, so in your face.
[03:02:37.235 --> 03:02:43.618]  But I think it's also a factor of the fact that they're, it's a function of the fact that they've reached the end of their game.
[03:02:43.638 --> 03:02:45.199]  They really are accelerating this.
[03:02:45.819 --> 03:02:47.040]  They're rolling everything out.
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:48.441]  They're collapsing the borders.
[03:02:48.481 --> 03:02:50.083]  They're proceeding as planned.
[03:02:50.603 --> 03:02:56.148]  All along, they've had this time frame of about 2020 to 2025 as being a fundamental transformation.
[03:02:56.788 --> 03:03:04.975]  And if you go back and you look at the book by Strauss and Howe, The Fourth Turning, you'll see that there has been a pattern that about every 80 years, there's a generational cycle.
[03:03:05.015 --> 03:03:07.478]  As we said before, history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
[03:03:08.098 --> 03:03:19.802]  And it has a rhythm to it as well, and you know, we see that we are coming up to a crisis, I believe, that's going to be like World War II and the Great Depression, or before that, the Civil War, or before that, the Revolutionary War.
[03:03:19.862 --> 03:03:36.769]  I think there's going to be a fundamental transformation of our society, and the question is, will we understand the basis that this society was originally built on in 1776, or are we going to allow them to set up something that is completely foreign, completely alien, to the way that our founders viewed
[03:03:37.489 --> 03:03:38.589]  Yes, hello David.
[03:03:38.609 --> 03:03:38.749]  Oh, fine.
[03:03:38.849 --> 03:03:40.970]  I have a question for you and a statement.
[03:03:40.990 --> 03:03:42.470]  Did you get your Cliven Bundy for President t-shirt?
[03:04:07.173 --> 03:04:08.173]  I haven't yet, no.
[03:04:08.894 --> 03:04:10.534]  You're the one who had that t-shirt.
[03:04:10.554 --> 03:04:11.495]  You were going to send it, right?
[03:04:12.635 --> 03:04:14.276]  Yes, I sent it out.
[03:04:14.296 --> 03:04:15.736]  You should have received it by now.
[03:04:15.937 --> 03:04:19.578]  It was a free day, so I sent it out Friday last.
[03:04:20.436 --> 03:04:20.696]  Okay.
[03:04:20.736 --> 03:04:25.419]  You should have received it this week, but please check in there and you know.
[03:04:25.639 --> 03:04:27.881]  I'm looking forward to it.
[03:04:27.921 --> 03:04:29.101]  I didn't get your size.
[03:04:29.181 --> 03:04:30.382]  I sent an extra large.
[03:04:30.462 --> 03:04:31.123]  I didn't know.
[03:04:31.243 --> 03:04:32.463]  That's fine.
[03:04:32.864 --> 03:04:34.304]  That's fine.
[03:04:34.745 --> 03:04:42.850]  The statement is, as a street artist activist, I was very provocative with controversial work on the streets of New Orleans.
[03:04:43.290 --> 03:04:44.871]  I'm approached by
[03:04:45.749 --> 03:04:46.170]  Oh, okay.
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:57.901]  We're running out of time.
[03:04:57.921 --> 03:04:59.462]  We've got the twilight zone.
[03:04:59.482 --> 03:05:01.143]  We've got to leave people in suspense.
[03:05:01.163 --> 03:05:02.944]  I'll tell you what, I'm on the show tomorrow.
[03:05:03.224 --> 03:05:04.405]  I'll try to take your call then.
[03:05:04.465 --> 03:05:05.866]  Thank you, Michael, on Louisiana.
[03:05:06.707 --> 03:05:09.029]  Join us at 7 Central tonight, 8 p.m.
[03:05:09.049 --> 03:05:10.149]  Eastern, for the nightly news.
[03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:17.434]  In the near future... When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball... Security alert.
[03:05:17.675 --> 03:05:19.416]  This is Homeland Security.
[03:05:19.676 --> 03:05:22.058]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independence.
