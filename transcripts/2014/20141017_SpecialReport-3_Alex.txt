[00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.567]  Well, this is the Ebola Equality Act.
[00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:11.649]  What it's going to do is allow us to fly in patients with Ebola.
[00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.072]  So what this does is we're going to allow them just to get on the plane, symptomatic or not, fly on over.
[00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.714]  It'll be commercial airline.
[00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:19.675]  You know, CDC says you're not going to get it.
[00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:20.876]  It's not airborne, so you're fine.
[00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:27.901]  You know, a lot of people out here are being racist, saying that we should just, like, shut down flights and not allow people to come in here to our country with Ebola.
[00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.222]  I mean, that's pretty ridiculous, right?
[00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:30.863]  We have better medical facilities, don't we?
[00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:32.364]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:35.865]  Can you believe all these people that say we should just stop flights from West Africa?
[00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:37.006]  Yeah, I think it's insane.
[00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:42.749]  I mean, I get their concerns and everything, but... I mean, the CDC knows exactly what they're doing, right?
[00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.950]  Right, and I also think it might be racialized.
[00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.191]  Hold on, I don't want to touch that yet.
[00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:47.352]  I've got to sanitize my hands.
[00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:49.813]  I can never be too careful, you know?
[00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:52.714]  I don't know where anybody's been around here.
[00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:53.755]  Alright, thanks.
[00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.257]  We can get them some football tickets, baseball tickets, hang out.
[00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.450]  There's still people that deserve to be taken care of.
[00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.811]  That's what Obama cares for.
[00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:10.636]  We're going to leave the southern borders open, too, if they want to, you know, take a flight to, you know, Costa Rica and then travel up through Mexico and come in that way.
[00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.097]  There's no one watching anyways.
[00:01:12.457 --> 00:01:14.919]  President Obama says you'll be fine, so there's nothing to worry about.
[00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:15.899]  No, I know.
[00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:16.580]  I'm a nurse.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.481]  I study nursing, so that's why I'm like, yeah.
[00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:20.522]  Bring people with Ebola over here?
[00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:21.743]  Why does it seem shocking?
[00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.035]  I think I'll pass.
[00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:25.036]  Thank you.
[00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:26.476]  You don't want to bring Ebola to the country?
[00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:26.536]  No.
[00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:28.017]  Our president does.
[00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:28.377]  Come on.
[00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:29.558]  The CDC says it's fine.
[00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:31.639]  People with Ebola deserve to live.
[00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:32.199]  Come on.
[00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.340]  Look, we're going to bring them into the country, fly them over, get them healthcare.
[00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:36.761]  Come on.
[00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:42.643]  Oh, and if you initial here, that's just agreeing that you'll, you know, take one of the patients in and help them out.
[00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:43.683]  Alright.
[00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:45.124]  Okay.
[00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:45.764]  You're going to initial.
[00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:46.885]  I'll hold that real quick.
[00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:49.266]  Can never be too careful.
[00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:53.429]  So if we don't want to be a host, do we not initial?
[00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:23.204]  Yeah, to bring them into our country so they can live a normal life.
[00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:25.645]  I don't want any more people to die of Ebola, do you?
[00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:26.105]  No.
[00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:31.327]  There's lots of people dying, bleeding out of their eyes and ears and mouth, and it's horrible.
[00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.789]  But I mean, we'll bring them here to the country if they're symptomatic or not.
[00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.010]  We can get them sporting events tickets, hang out, let them move freely, have fun.
[00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.212]  We'll reunite them with their families, be administered to a hospital, receive the best treatment in the world.
[00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:44.573]  We've got Obamacare, that takes care of everything, that's free.
[00:02:44.953 --> 00:02:45.353]  So come on.
[00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:47.454]  Help save some lives.
[00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.235]  The more Ebola patients we bring into America, the better.
[00:02:52.128 --> 00:02:52.729]  Don't you guys agree?
[00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.132]  To receive medical care and reunite with their families if they have some.
[00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:59.594]  So you want them to be able to come here?
[00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:00.535]  Yeah, let's bring them in.
[00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:01.956]  Obama says it's fine.
[00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.297]  The CDC says it's fine.
[00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:04.498]  Oh, you think so?
[00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.339]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:06.620]  I'm sorry.
[00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:11.083]  Oh, and if you want, if you initial here at the end, that's saying that you'll host an Ebola patient.
[00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:12.264]  You'll let them come over and hang out.
[00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:14.346]  You take care of them, read them stories, you know.
[00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.709]  Oh, cool.
[00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.630]  Thanks.
[00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.572]  We'll get a hold of you guys when we bring the Ebola patients in.
[00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:35.934]  As you can see, I just spoke to about 30 people, and the most disturbing part of this is out of 30 people, I was able to get 17 signatures, an entire full clipboard, in less than an hour.
[00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:47.804]  These are the youth that are supposed to be going to college and taking on positions to help further our country, and this just blows my mind.
[00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:49.045]  And now check this out, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
[00:03:53.393 --> 00:04:03.997]  Ten, eleven people, eleven people out of seventeen, initial at the end, where I don't know if you remember at the beginning, I said if you initial at the end, you allow a symptomatic Ebola patient to come live at your home.
[00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:07.438]  Eleven people said yes to that.
[00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:11.214]  You know, some people came by and looked at me and said, are you crazy?
[00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:12.736]  Our government's out of their mind.
[00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:16.199]  Some people just laughed when I was sitting out there saying, hey, let's bring a bull into the country.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.661]  Come on, don't be racist.
[00:04:18.122 --> 00:04:26.150]  You know, but there's still 17 people who are one day are going to become doctors because some of the people who signed this said they were in nursing school.
[00:04:26.631 --> 00:04:27.592]  Some were going to be doctors.
[00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.203]  This is why the CDC is messed up as it is.
[00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:37.053]  We have a bunch of people in there who have no idea what they're doing, and they're putting American lives at risk.
[00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:39.458]  This is mind-blowing.
[00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:54.435]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:04:54.896 --> 00:05:04.641]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:08.664]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:13.905]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:20.526]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:23.127]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:26.208]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
