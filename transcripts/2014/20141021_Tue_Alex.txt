[00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:10.130]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.711]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.252]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:17.455]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:39.432]  There's a lot of really important mixed Ebola news today.
[00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:42.194]  Some shocking information, quite frankly.
[00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:45.115]  We're going to be breaking all of that down coming up.
[00:00:45.115 --> 00:01:00.282]  And we have Freeway Ricky Ross, not Rick Ross the fake rapper that resembles a black Jabba the Hutt, but the real Rick Ross, who was the biggest cocaine dealer ever known on the West Coast.
[00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:05.044]  $30 million a day at some points for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:09.295]  As a distributor.
[00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:11.817]  To fund the Iran-Contra operation.
[00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:15.339]  That, of course, has now been declassified and confirmed, validating Gary Webb.
[00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:24.546]  That's why Gary Webb, who'd won a whole bunch of awards, had to have two bullets pumped into his brain back in 2004.
[00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:34.654]  Now, ten years later, there's a big hit movie out that I've talked a lot about, very powerful, and that, of course, is Kill the Messenger, based on a book that Webb wrote before he died.
[00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.690]  We got Rick Ross joining us, coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.591]  Of course, there's a major character in the film who plays the part of Rick Ross.
[00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.452]  We'll get his take on the film and more.
[00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:57.533]  I knew Rick Ross back at the time and interviewed him, and I knew Webb and interviewed him.
[00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.794]  We can still talk to Rick Ross.
[00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:00.234]  They haven't killed him yet.
[00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:00.854]  Knock on wood.
[00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.354]  Hope that doesn't happen.
[00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:02.734]  IMDB gives it a 7.3.
[00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:17.692]  It deserves more like a 9, because if you knew Gary Webb and Rick Ross and the players and followed it, you would know how accurate this film is, almost like a documentary.
[00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:20.595]  And it's not just about the CIA bringing drugs in.
[00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:21.596]  Everybody knows that.
[00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:22.977]  Pretty much everybody.
[00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.479]  Unless you're totally living under a rock in denial.
[00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.680]  They've been caught so many times.
[00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:32.436]  It's how they destroyed someone, how they killed his name and then killed him.
[00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:34.838]  But still, like a phoenix, he's risen again, bigger than ever.
[00:02:34.838 --> 00:02:36.939]  It's like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.982]  Strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:02:40.982 --> 00:02:51.209]  And I think the film hit me so hard because, to use a socialist term, but I don't use it as the socialist meaning, I am and have been and will be
[00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:58.326]  A fellow traveler with people like Gary Webb who are threatened and attacked and assassinated in the media.
[00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:00.837]  They've told me they will assassinate me.
[00:03:00.837 --> 00:03:04.821]  Very serious people relayed that message in very serious ways.
[00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:07.423]  And they told him a lot that before they killed him as well.
[00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:10.246]  But that's all part of the great journey, isn't it?
[00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:14.551]  And all part of being a winner is not selling out to dehumanization and tyranny.
[00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:20.637]  When everybody sells out out of fear, evil wins and takes over, and then you're ultimately destroyed and you have hell on earth.
[00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:22.138]  When good men and women
[00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.302]  Take the field and stand up against all the different forms of tyranny and oppression.
[00:03:27.302 --> 00:03:35.548]  You create Renaissance systems that are built of honor and chivalry, and that's the type of system I want to be in.
[00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.210]  So, Rick Ross will be joining us today.
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.154]  He was going to be on via Skype, but is having some problems, so he'll probably be on for all hour in the next few weeks or hell.
[00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:45.395]  He's off probation now.
[00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:46.276]  They've been harassing him.
[00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:48.998]  We need to fly him out here for an in-studio interview.
[00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:50.519]  That's probably what we should do, or for a film.
[00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:52.549]  That's an idea.
[00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.150]  We ought to talk to Rick about that today.
[00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.291]  And then another filmmaker's joining us.
[00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:58.851]  There's no place like Utopia.
[00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:00.812]  Rick Ross is a filmmaker too now.
[00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:14.016]  Joel Gilbert will be with us in the third hour today to talk about the fake liberalism of collectivism and how it's really the ultimate form of domestication and disenfranchisement and tyranny.
[00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:23.304]  So that is all coming up as we pull back the curtain and reveal the little man behind the curtain and all it takes.
[00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:31.007]  Everybody else, Dorothy and the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion, they're all cowering in fear but not Little Toto.
[00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:37.229]  Little Toto, all it takes is a child to call out to the emperor's butt naked.
[00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:45.852]  All it takes is the little dog to pull back the curtain and show that the great and powerful Federal Reserve isn't even federal at all.
[00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.252]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:53.214]  On the other side of this quick break, I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're all on this great journey together.
[00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:56.535]  And yes, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.
[00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:09.848]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:16.290]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.651]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.732]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:05:21.732 --> 00:05:28.614]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:32.775]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:37.056]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:38.837]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:44.158]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:44.158 --> 00:05:46.679]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.819]  But for how long?
[00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.040]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.461]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.342]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:05:56.342 --> 00:05:57.282]  Just won't quit.
[00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:00.087]  The experts are clear.
[00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:07.213]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:13.479]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.062]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:21.424]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:26.746]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:27.746]  Not our iodine.
[00:06:27.746 --> 00:06:31.568]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:06:31.568 --> 00:06:34.089]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.130]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.

[00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:08.435]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:18.360]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.282]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:22.103]  I think so.
[00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:36.699]  We're good.
[00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:16.438]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:08:16.438 --> 00:08:22.179]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:28.401]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.761]  It is a big idea.
[00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:30.982]  A new world order.
[00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:38.621]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:42.528]  It just pancaked.
[00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:46.295]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:08:59.531 --> 00:09:05.113]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:10.566]  Guns will be taken.
[00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:12.087]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:13.167]  We will take all guns.
[00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:18.170]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.711]  Global governance at last.
[00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.711]  Is it one world?
[00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.392]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:09:22.392 --> 00:09:25.974]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:32.258]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:36.981]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:44.452]  Yes, my friends, and it is the 21st day already of October 2014.
[00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:52.395]  Before you know it, a twinkle of the eye, it'll be 2015 and beyond.
[00:09:52.395 --> 00:10:02.679]  We have Freeway Ricky Ross, the biggest known cocaine dealer in West Coast history, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:06.221]  He later learned in federal court
[00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:18.198]  And he's part of the subject in the film Kill the Messenger, that's a hit film right now and extremely accurate, about the late, great Gary Webb.
[00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:22.348]  So that's coming up for 30 minutes at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:10:22.348 --> 00:10:39.158]  Then, filmmaker Joel Gilbert, There's No Place Like Utopia, will give us a take on his film, now out on DVD, and tie it into what's currently happening and what he thinks Obama, who he's been tracking and researching very closely, what he thinks Obama will do next, as he becomes incredibly toxic.
[00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:43.921]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com, that's the headline up there,
[00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:52.594]  From patron saint to pariah, how Obama became toxic for the Democrats.
[00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:57.137]  And that's out of the London Telegraph.
[00:10:57.137 --> 00:11:04.922]  And Democrats running for the House and Senate are in trouble, whether they're incumbents or running against an incumbent Republican.
[00:11:04.922 --> 00:11:06.583]  They are in deep, deep trouble.
[00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:11.453]  Some of the Republicans are good Libertarian Tea Party types.
[00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:19.835]  I'd say about half of them from the numbers I've seen that are running and winning right now and set to win in the polls in this midterm election.
[00:11:19.835 --> 00:11:25.737]  It's just a few weeks away now.
[00:11:25.737 --> 00:11:33.179]  But a lot of them are neocon rhino types, unfortunately, that are working with the Democrats and raising money from different
[00:11:34.915 --> 00:11:47.942]  establishment special interest groups to try to stop any attempt to write America's course onto a course that will give us some basic prosperity.
[00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:57.406]  The political elite just have a will to power, a will to crush this country, a will to break the free market and cement their criminal takeover.
[00:11:57.406 --> 00:12:01.929]  The difference is we're not going to sit here flat-footed and put a bunch of Republicans in
[00:12:03.211 --> 00:12:06.472]  And then watch them do the same old thing over and over again.
[00:12:06.472 --> 00:12:29.237]  All the numbers, all the polls show there is a major political awakening, a major political realignment that hasn't happened in over a hundred plus years in this country, and it's happening all over the world as well, and with the singularity approaching off in the distance, and many, many singularities on the path to that, everything is compacted, everything is accelerated right now.
[00:12:30.609 --> 00:12:42.896]  And the political elite better know, thousands of armored vehicles, billions of rounds of ammo, militarized police are not going to protect you if you shut down the economy and steal everything.
[00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:50.540]  A free market and prosperity is what protects elites and nouveau riche and prosperity.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.502]  But time and time again in history, elites get greedy.
[00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:57.664]  Everybody knows the story of the Golden Goose, Aesop's Fables.
[00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:11.651]  Where this goose starts laying golden eggs and the farmer becomes incredibly rich and then he gets greedy and goes to the goose and says, I want two eggs every day.
[00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:15.932]  And the goose says, all I can lay is one golden egg a day.
[00:13:15.932 --> 00:13:20.553]  And then the goose does as hard as it can and lays two golden eggs.
[00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:24.793]  And the farmer comes back and says, I want three or I'm going to kill you and cut those eggs out.
[00:13:24.793 --> 00:13:26.954]  Finally, the goose couldn't lay any more eggs and
[00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:34.212]  The farmer came with a hatchet and split its guts open and there was no eggs inside, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:34.212 --> 00:13:37.813]  And this is what political, greedy systems do over and over again.
[00:13:37.813 --> 00:13:46.776]  For short-term gain, they slaughter the entire herd as they see us, and then there's no cows the next year.
[00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:57.473]  And I put that out from an elitist perspective that we're all a bunch of human resources, animals that are dumber than a box of rocks, and they're all up there just to prey on us and lie to us.
[00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:05.898]  Why would any of you elitists want to create a world where your kids have to be raised around a bunch of brain-damaged people?
[00:14:05.898 --> 00:14:07.359]  Now I'm going to get into Ebola.
[00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:09.100]  I'm going to get into a bunch of science news.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.942]  There is a lot of really powerful news today.
[00:14:11.942 --> 00:14:14.383]  IBM is plunging in stocks.
[00:14:14.383 --> 00:14:16.645]  McDonald's is plunging as well.
[00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:23.569]  ISIS is making big gains and big moves in Iraq.
[00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:24.530]  Huge.
[00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.171]  Ebola news.
[00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:31.035]  The Ebola czar, I told you worked for Al Gore and Eugenics.
[00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:35.077]  He's now come out, we have the video, and said population reduction is needed.
[00:14:35.077 --> 00:14:38.219]  And the biggest problem is the population in Africa.
[00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:39.660]  And he said this a year ago.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.504]  And he says the number one problem is overpopulation.
[00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:54.156]  This is a big carbon taxer globalist that wants to tax the West but put double taxes on the third world, stop their development, which would actually lower their population.
[00:14:54.156 --> 00:14:58.659]  Because there are some areas that are overpopulated, there's no doubting that.
[00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:10.227]  But the globalists have the schizophrenic move of wanting a dumbed down population and not letting them industrialize, so then they have 5, 6, 7, 8 kids, whether it's poor people in Eastern Europe, Asia, or Africa.
[00:15:10.227 --> 00:15:14.470]  Then their answer is, come in and hit them with vaccines with sterilants on top of it,
[00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:18.468]  But the Africans aren't stupid like Americans.
[00:15:18.468 --> 00:15:21.530]  They run from the UN vehicles.
[00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:28.295]  They have to have the police, you can look this up, in these countries, arrest people and take them in for four shots.
[00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:34.720]  Because the Africans notice they have miscarriages, they can't have kids anymore, they die when they're given the tetanus shots and other vaccines.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.462]  They're not stupid.
[00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:38.443]  They're not naive.
[00:15:38.443 --> 00:15:38.964]  Like we are.
[00:15:40.782 --> 00:15:42.523]  I'm just telling you, they're not.
[00:15:42.523 --> 00:15:45.064]  They're silly and ignorant in a lot of ways in Africa.
[00:15:45.064 --> 00:15:50.247]  I've studied the different regions and different subgroups and what's going on there, but they understand that they're being attacked.
[00:15:50.247 --> 00:15:57.351]  And their scientists do, and they have major medical facilities there, and people train in the West, and it's been identified.
[00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:05.856]  In South Africa, declassified in 1993, Project Coast and a bunch of other programs injecting black people with sterilants.
[00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:06.937]  Weaponized Ebola.
[00:16:08.153 --> 00:16:14.535]  Uh, systems that make women have an autoimmune response to sperm.
[00:16:14.535 --> 00:16:16.835]  So, that's all coming out.
[00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:22.737]  But before I go any further, I was talking to a famous person yesterday.
[00:16:22.737 --> 00:16:25.397]  I'll just leave it at that because it's interesting.
[00:16:25.397 --> 00:16:30.839]  The reason I point out that they're famous is just that that's where this type of talk goes on.
[00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:35.080]  And this person listens to the show and has seen my films, and he was talking to another
[00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.991]  Very famous athlete.
[00:16:40.991 --> 00:16:51.575]  And the famous athlete was basically saying, hey, eugenics isn't bad, and Ebola isn't bad.
[00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:56.256]  We need to reduce population.
[00:16:56.256 --> 00:16:59.217]  And when you let diseases kill people, then the stronger survive.
[00:16:59.217 --> 00:17:02.638]  Well, at one level, that's true.
[00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:04.018]  But are you ready to die?
[00:17:04.018 --> 00:17:05.659]  You ready to have your kids die to prove that?
[00:17:11.258 --> 00:17:14.241]  I mean, think about this.
[00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:25.070]  So I was having this debate, and I said, listen, surface eugenics is make the elite morally and healthier and better looking, but get rid of the dumb people.
[00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.855]  Real eugenics is make the general public dumb, target the most intelligent, and try to dumb them down.
[00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:35.059]  And then they make it through all those hurdles with test scores, then hire them to work for the system.
[00:17:36.274 --> 00:17:42.100]  Just like a grizzly bear will go out and smell the newborn cub.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.782]  Or what do you call a baby bear?
[00:17:44.782 --> 00:17:48.026]  Cub, yeah.
[00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.767]  And will eat it.
[00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:51.289]  Lions and tigers.
[00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:54.772]  Males will go out and find baby males and eat them.
[00:17:54.772 --> 00:17:56.394]  Because they don't want the competition.
[00:17:56.394 --> 00:17:58.136]  And that's the true eugenics, okay?
[00:18:00.106 --> 00:18:13.274]  It's bad enough to say we're going to sterilize mentally retarded people and all of this and sterilize people that have genetic disorders so they can't have kids or whatever.
[00:18:13.274 --> 00:18:21.379]  Even though I've seen major studies showing that a lot of people that have genetic disorders will also then have some super quirk, idiot, savant level intelligence.
[00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:22.840]  Or their kid will.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.501]  These mutations happen for a reason.
[00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:35.252]  But I can sit back and see the eugenics view and say, uh, should we have people with Down syndrome, you know, getting together, having kids?
[00:18:35.252 --> 00:18:36.632]  Well, no, that's a bad decision.
[00:18:36.632 --> 00:18:41.774]  But do you want to let, to use the ring of Mordor to start sterilizing those poor folks?
[00:18:41.774 --> 00:18:43.254]  Because then you're next.
[00:18:43.254 --> 00:18:44.875]  That's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:47.275]  What Christ said is what I live by.
[00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:49.816]  What you do to the least of these, you've done to me.
[00:18:49.816 --> 00:18:55.478]  How we treat old people and mentally retarded children and combat injured veterans
[00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:04.097]  Is the measure of how we're going to be treated in our lives on this planet and then when we're judged by God.
[00:19:04.097 --> 00:19:09.581]  It'd be better to tie a giant 5,000 pound rock around your neck and throw it into the ocean, a millstone.
[00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:11.335]  Thank you.
[00:19:33.243 --> 00:19:38.745]  I was sent by a friend photos, and I confirmed it's going on, where they're now not having gingerbread men or women.
[00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:41.025]  It'll say, ginger neutral.
[00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:43.806]  I mean, it's just cult-like mind control.
[00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:45.727]  All the globalists discriminate against all of us.
[00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.227]  So I thought I'd mention that.
[00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:50.268]  The latest on Ebola, straight ahead.
[00:19:50.268 --> 00:19:53.189]  And a lot more, then your phone calls.
[00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:56.770]  And then we have Free Ricky Ross, who worked for the CIA, coming up.
[00:20:00.177 --> 00:20:01.158]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:04.600]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.281]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:20:06.281 --> 00:20:08.223]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:20:08.223 --> 00:20:14.066]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:14.887]  I know, right?
[00:20:14.887 --> 00:20:16.208]  You love it, too!
[00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:17.649]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:18.669]  Let's go get some!
[00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:20.390]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.611]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:21.251]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:32.410]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.210]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.691]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:38.271]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:40.231]  If passed, H.R.
[00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:42.632]  5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:44.812]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[00:20:44.812 --> 00:20:47.913]  We offer the most affordable Level 3 body armor on the market.
[00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:52.354]  KD Level 3 armor withstands pistol and rifle hits up to 7.62 NATO.

[00:20:56.515 --> 00:20:57.295]  KD Armor.
[00:20:57.295 --> 00:20:58.155]  Come and take it.
[00:20:58.695 --> 00:21:00.017]  The experts are clear.
[00:21:00.017 --> 00:21:07.126]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:21:07.126 --> 00:21:13.394]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:13.394 --> 00:21:16.999]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:21:17.099 --> 00:21:21.321]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:26.643]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:27.663]  Not our iodine.
[00:21:27.663 --> 00:21:34.005]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:21:44.189 --> 00:21:44.409]  We're good.
[00:21:58.351 --> 00:22:03.012]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[00:22:03.012 --> 00:22:15.355]  This, combined with several other unidentified viruses, have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[00:22:15.355 --> 00:22:25.318]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell

[00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.852]  541-229-0010.
[00:22:57.852 --> 00:23:01.836]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:23:01.836 --> 00:23:07.341]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:23:07.341 --> 00:23:09.623]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:16.844]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:18.947]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:22.251]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:25.315]  Children left with no homes and no one's coming to help them.
[00:23:25.315 --> 00:23:28.159]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:28.619]  I think so.
[00:24:14.604 --> 00:24:16.945]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:16.945 --> 00:24:22.908]  I warned you 15 years ago or more that they would tax us by the mile, drive our automobiles worldwide.
[00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:25.453]  Global plan.
[00:24:25.453 --> 00:24:27.274]  Global governance.
[00:24:27.274 --> 00:24:36.598]  And I told you that once they put Google cars on the streets, they would claim they were safer than human driving, that they would end human driving and surveil everything we do in our cars.
[00:24:36.598 --> 00:24:37.419]  Time Magazine.
[00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:38.219]  Let's fix it.
[00:24:38.219 --> 00:24:40.840]  Let's end human driving.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.061]  Which means end human travel.
[00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:45.983]  And the police already believe it's a privilege, even though it's not.
[00:24:45.983 --> 00:24:48.564]  They're also teaching them owning a gun is a privilege.
[00:24:48.564 --> 00:24:49.004]  It is not.
[00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:57.357]  Commerce on publicly paid-for roads is a privilege, not travel.
[00:24:58.365 --> 00:25:00.206]  I'm not going to quote the Supreme Court rulings.
[00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:02.847]  If the police want to look up the facts, they will.
[00:25:02.847 --> 00:25:04.427]  Most of them already know.
[00:25:04.427 --> 00:25:05.788]  So there you go.
[00:25:05.788 --> 00:25:08.089]  See, humans aren't going to be going into space.
[00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:13.331]  Humans aren't going to be driving fun hot rods when you're, you know, 20 years old in college.
[00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:15.752]  You're not going to be able to have men and women anymore.
[00:25:15.752 --> 00:25:17.552]  You're not going to have the gender roles.
[00:25:17.552 --> 00:25:19.373]  It's all under attack.
[00:25:19.373 --> 00:25:21.234]  They're breaking humanity down.
[00:25:21.234 --> 00:25:25.336]  It's a prison they're building with 200 square foot coffin apartments.
[00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.296]  And that's just the start.
[00:25:27.751 --> 00:25:34.755]  No one should want them to model the future, these transhumanist eugenicist globalists.
[00:25:34.755 --> 00:25:41.538]  But they come to the top athletes and the top scientists and the top of every field and go, you're an elitist, you should be part of the eugenicist movement.
[00:25:41.538 --> 00:25:45.040]  Would you like to come to one of our private meetings?
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.401]  Would you like to meet the governor?
[00:25:47.401 --> 00:25:49.362]  Would you like to meet the general?
[00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:52.604]  Would you like to meet the head of the botany department?
[00:25:52.604 --> 00:25:57.026]  And so they've got almost everybody who's somebody in this stupid cult.
[00:25:58.447 --> 00:26:03.030]  If you guys would read the literature deeper, you're not going to be given entrance into it, okay?
[00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.432]  They're going to wipe almost everybody out.
[00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:19.580]  They've got Mother Jones and the International Business Times and like five other publications the last two days, I didn't even read the others, attacking me for saying, Jones is nuts and says a global government will be established to carry out mass culling.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.661]  Because that's all they talk about!
[00:26:21.661 --> 00:26:23.482]  Ecoscience!
[00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:24.663]  The current
[00:26:25.888 --> 00:26:29.931]  The czar, Obama's Ebola czar, thinks there's too many people.
[00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:31.592]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:31.592 --> 00:26:34.475]  Administration hires another overpopulation fanatic.
[00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:35.536]  That's what I said days ago.
[00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:37.457]  That's the office he was over.
[00:26:37.457 --> 00:26:52.589]  Between Al Gore, out of office, and the White House regulations czar, Cass Sunstein, and the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, who wrote Ecoscience, with Paul Ehrlich calling for putting fluoride in the water to sterilize us.
[00:26:52.589 --> 00:26:53.550]  And what do you think it does?
[00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:56.342]  They've written their plan.
[00:26:56.342 --> 00:26:58.483]  We're living under it.
[00:26:58.483 --> 00:27:01.004]  These sniveling people, none of them take vaccines.
[00:27:01.004 --> 00:27:02.325]  They all drink filtered water.
[00:27:02.325 --> 00:27:04.045]  They all don't take GMOs.
[00:27:04.045 --> 00:27:06.566]  They go and do purify cleanses constantly.
[00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:08.948]  It's all a sick joke to them.
[00:27:08.948 --> 00:27:10.528]  They hate you and your family.
[00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:13.690]  They're not liberals!
[00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.371]  Do you understand that?
[00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:17.712]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip.
[00:27:17.712 --> 00:27:19.693]  Here it is.
[00:27:19.693 --> 00:27:21.614]  Here is the... He was a wonderful fellow.
[00:27:21.614 --> 00:27:22.074]  Mad as I had to.
[00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:35.525]  He used to rock up in South Africa having flown intercontinental flights with a trousers pocket full of goodies in sealed vials that he claimed were new and wonderful organisms and could do the most wonderful things on Earth.
[00:27:38.897 --> 00:27:48.423]  Larry Ford had mutated cholera, typhoid, anthrax, botulism, bubonic plague, and had also come up with germs that he called kaffir-killing germs.
[00:27:48.423 --> 00:27:52.866]  Kaffir, as you may know in Afrikaans, is the equivalent of the n-word.
[00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:11.059]  Here is the particular clip.
[00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:15.662]  Obama's Ebola czar thinks there's too many people in Africa.
[00:28:15.662 --> 00:28:24.309]  Administration hires another overpopulation fanatic, Ron Klain, who doesn't need any medical background or Ebola background.
[00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:29.833]  No, he just needs to know there are too many people, which the African scientists are saying has been weaponized.
[00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.695]  And the man that wrote the U.S.
[00:28:31.695 --> 00:28:33.836]  Chemical Biological Weapons Treaty that the U.N.
[00:28:33.836 --> 00:28:38.099]  adopted, Francis Boyle, Dr. Francis Boyle,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.442]  Who went through Kissinger's secret PhD program and was vetted to be the next Kissinger?
[00:28:43.442 --> 00:28:45.122]  We're going to get him on the next few days.
[00:28:45.122 --> 00:28:48.303]  He's come out and said this is weaponized and staged.
[00:28:48.303 --> 00:28:55.205]  Former top NSA analyst and security head, led a team of internal security there.
[00:28:55.205 --> 00:29:00.167]  Wayne Madsen says it's CIA as well, but let's just ignore the experts.
[00:29:00.167 --> 00:29:02.808]  Let's actually go to the Obama czar.
[00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:16.289]  I think the top leadership issue in our world today is how to deal with the continuing growing population in the world and all the resource demands and places on the world.
[00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:26.872]  And burgeoning populations in Africa and Asia that lack the resources to have a healthy, happy life.
[00:29:26.872 --> 00:29:30.113]  And I think we've got to find a way to make the world work for everyone.
[00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:32.794]  And this woman sits here nodding at him like he's God.
[00:29:32.794 --> 00:29:38.677]  They all talk in these fake official, fake deliberative voices as they spout the same lines over and over again.
[00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:48.682]  We're going to come back with the plan to murder all the black people on BBC.
[00:29:48.682 --> 00:29:50.083]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:52.604]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:55.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.418 --> 00:30:01.419]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:05.940]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.401]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:30:10.401 --> 00:30:17.703]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:26.786]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:27.006 --> 00:30:32.549]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:40.154]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:30:40.154 --> 00:30:42.715]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:47.798]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.
[00:30:48.198 --> 00:30:52.947]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:30:52.947 --> 00:30:54.169]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:06.634]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:31:06.634 --> 00:31:08.976]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:14.278]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:31:14.278 --> 00:31:19.441]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:31:19.441 --> 00:31:22.482]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:31:22.742 --> 00:31:26.824]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:31:26.824 --> 00:31:31.146]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:41.372]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:31:41.372 --> 00:31:43.893]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:31:44.213 --> 00:31:52.297]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:31:52.297 --> 00:31:56.279]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.426 --> 00:32:00.686]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:05.667]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:08.308]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:08.308 --> 00:32:15.369]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:15.369 --> 00:32:18.390]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.410]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.350]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.171]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:26.271 --> 00:32:31.993]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:35.495]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:38.596]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:32:38.596 --> 00:32:45.919]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:49.120]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:32:55.523 --> 00:32:58.084]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:58.084 --> 00:33:20.452]  Time Magazine has come out leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[00:33:20.452 --> 00:33:24.413]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:26.596 --> 00:33:36.407]  Time Magazine has come out, as they always do, going, oh, here's the top globalist who just wants to share with you his vision, what he thinks is going to happen.
[00:33:36.407 --> 00:33:38.789]  And it's all been officially planned by MIT.
[00:33:39.958 --> 00:34:08.059]  More than 15 years ago, I read the documents on air where they said there'll be no manned space flight, you won't drive your car, everything will be done in your house, the computer robots hooked into the central system will watch everything you do, you'll be totally social engineered, you will only get meat a few times a year, you will not be allowed to show any gender traits, or you will be sent for re-education, and then now they have documentary cartoons made for high school students in England
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:15.542]  Called Megapolis, where they show all this, and people see this who are older and say, is this a dystopic joke?
[00:34:15.542 --> 00:34:17.403]  No, it's not a joke!
[00:34:17.403 --> 00:34:20.064]  When they say, your kids belong to the state.
[00:34:20.064 --> 00:34:22.185]  We're not gonna let you ever drive a car again.
[00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.746]  The NSA is watching everything you do.
[00:34:24.746 --> 00:34:27.447]  There won't be military in combat anymore.
[00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:30.508]  It's the end of humans doing things.
[00:34:30.508 --> 00:34:35.650]  The elite have decided to merge with machines, and then to release bioweapons to wipe us out.
[00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:41.478]  Literally hundreds of publications have said that's the plan.
[00:34:41.478 --> 00:34:55.141]  Now, separately, thousands of times, hundreds of times just the last few months, I have been attacked for trying to rally humanity in the face of the clear and present stated enemy agenda.
[00:34:55.141 --> 00:34:56.702]  And yeah, it's fantastical.
[00:34:56.702 --> 00:34:58.082]  It's freaky.
[00:34:58.082 --> 00:35:00.563]  It's crazy.
[00:35:00.563 --> 00:35:01.103]  But it's happening.
[00:35:03.991 --> 00:35:07.354]  Just like all over the world, our government injected poor people with syphilis.
[00:35:07.354 --> 00:35:10.176]  It wasn't just blacks in Tuskegee.
[00:35:10.176 --> 00:35:11.297]  It was Guatemalans.
[00:35:11.297 --> 00:35:16.021]  It was people injected with it in Pakistan.
[00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:17.342]  Injected with polio.
[00:35:17.342 --> 00:35:18.583]  Injected with sterilants.
[00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:21.526]  Injected with you name it.
[00:35:21.526 --> 00:35:25.629]  They've got History Channel shows that I saw 20-something years ago.
[00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:26.450]  And I went and looked it up.
[00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:32.115]  It was declassified that they radiated 4,000 plus foster kids who were even healthy.
[00:35:34.062 --> 00:35:35.823]  In some cases, they gave them low dosages.
[00:35:35.823 --> 00:35:41.928]  Other cases, they put them in there and would fry them on the spot.
[00:35:41.928 --> 00:35:50.355]  And in the reports, the army and other scientists would say, well, as I heard the four-year-old cry and beg, their body literally burned.
[00:35:50.355 --> 00:35:52.436]  And it took several hours for him to die as we monitored.
[00:35:52.436 --> 00:35:56.540]  I felt very sad that they had to do this, but it was for the greater good.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:01.844]  See, it was about finding cadres of people that would take a three-year-old and stick him in a radiation chamber and then
[00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:10.208]  Hit them so hard that their feet would burn to the ground like frying eggs.
[00:36:10.208 --> 00:36:13.891]  Oh, the government doesn't bring drugs in, no.
[00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:16.934]  The government doesn't launder money, no.
[00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:18.375]  It's nice.
[00:36:18.375 --> 00:36:20.917]  It wants to give me college scholarships.
[00:36:20.917 --> 00:36:23.399]  It wants me to watch football games.
[00:36:23.399 --> 00:36:27.643]  It wants me to turn my guns in so we can all be peaceful.
[00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:29.285]  Oh, it's not behind the Ebola.
[00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:34.935]  The government isn't a government.
[00:36:34.935 --> 00:36:44.017]  It is eugenicists, social engineers who have disdain and hatred for humanity.
[00:36:44.017 --> 00:36:48.439]  They make Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer look like angels compared to them.
[00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:52.800]  They have disdain and a love of death.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.582]  And if you won't get it, if you won't get that understanding, we're gonna lose.
[00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:04.789]  I know you're not like that, so it's so alien you don't understand it, some of the new listeners out there.
[00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:09.074]  I will assure you this is what we face.
[00:37:09.074 --> 00:37:12.918]  It is the opposite of being Christ-like.
[00:37:12.918 --> 00:37:22.868]  But they shell to those of us that are Christ-like and that our hearts are inclined towards helping the innocent, helping the weak, building people up, letting people know the rabbit trick.
[00:37:24.378 --> 00:37:28.022]  Enjoy seeing young people learn and be empowered.
[00:37:28.022 --> 00:37:30.484]  Enjoy seeing other people that are successful.
[00:37:30.484 --> 00:37:34.048]  Enjoy and admire musicians that can play beautiful music.
[00:37:34.048 --> 00:37:36.270]  Admire men and women that are beautiful or handsome.
[00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:44.002]  We're blind spiritually to the evil ones that hate beauty and hate strength and hate honor.
[00:37:44.002 --> 00:37:50.685]  But they shell us on a fake Christianoid liberalism of give your money for the poor people.
[00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.746]  Aren't you like Jesus?
[00:37:52.746 --> 00:37:55.567]  Liberation theology?
[00:37:55.567 --> 00:38:01.810]  But you notice the money they give is not to empower someone to know how to fish.
[00:38:03.618 --> 00:38:12.345]  It is simply to get people to become domesticated and to live off the government dole that the Roman system had 2,000 plus years ago.
[00:38:12.345 --> 00:38:14.867]  To control the voting Romans.
[00:38:14.867 --> 00:38:21.433]  To control the Senate.
[00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:25.216]  We're going down a crony system instead of an open system.
[00:38:25.216 --> 00:38:27.938]  And there's always aspects of both in any system.
[00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:32.282]  There's no such thing as utopia under the dominion of man and the god of this world.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.882]  Who's not the good guy.
[00:38:35.882 --> 00:38:40.547]  But you're going to see the total incremental rollout.
[00:38:40.547 --> 00:38:48.874]  You think they're going to stop with front line parking spaces for people that have electric cars?
[00:38:48.874 --> 00:38:52.698]  And then people that carpool?
[00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:57.402]  No, they're going to make whole cities driverless cars in the next few years.
[00:38:57.402 --> 00:38:58.503]  It's now moving to that.
[00:39:00.236 --> 00:39:00.396]  No.
[00:39:19.634 --> 00:39:24.435]  Sure, there's no underground economy when they shut the economy off.
[00:39:24.435 --> 00:39:31.398]  And that's in the news again today, that the NSA isn't really about spying on people so much politically, though that's part of it.
[00:39:31.398 --> 00:39:39.100]  It's almost entirely about rigging markets and stealing ideas and making sure the insiders can take over.
[00:39:43.157 --> 00:39:50.983]  Just like when you post you're going on vacation and what you got for Christmas and where you live and thieves come and rob your house when you're gone because you were dumb enough to put it on Facebook.
[00:39:50.983 --> 00:39:52.424]  Because you're a good person.
[00:39:52.424 --> 00:39:54.425]  You didn't do anything wrong.
[00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:55.266]  So what's the big deal?
[00:39:55.266 --> 00:39:56.867]  Let your cell phone track you.
[00:39:56.867 --> 00:39:58.288]  Let people know where you live.
[00:39:58.288 --> 00:39:59.889]  Don't leave your house locked.
[00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:05.693]  Or let folks know what you got for Christmas and then see someone comes and robs you and you're like, why?
[00:40:05.693 --> 00:40:06.854]  I'm a nice person.
[00:40:06.854 --> 00:40:10.336]  They came and robbed you because you are a nice person.
[00:40:10.336 --> 00:40:11.077]  You're a schmuck.
[00:40:15.885 --> 00:40:22.288]  Good people have to stop acting like jellyfish, sheep, idiots!
[00:40:22.288 --> 00:40:23.469]  Or you will be overrun!
[00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:39.196]  And worse, under all the fake Christ-like, counterfeit Christ garbage, you will say, I've got to let the state run my kids and my life and my house and tax me more because I'm stingy, because I'm only paying 70% one tax or another.
[00:40:43.251 --> 00:40:46.393]  70% is what the average upper middle class person pays in this country.
[00:40:46.393 --> 00:40:51.176]  The ultra-rich pay almost nothing on record, because they wrote the laws.
[00:40:51.176 --> 00:40:51.957]  You're like, good!
[00:40:51.957 --> 00:40:55.479]  Do you have any idea, back when Kennedy cut taxes by half, what happened?
[00:40:55.479 --> 00:41:01.083]  Tax receipts doubled, the middle class exploded, the biggest rate ever.
[00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:03.265]  Because there was more money for you to decide where to spend it.
[00:41:03.265 --> 00:41:07.408]  They don't want you to have money to vote in the free market, because that'll build a beautiful world.
[00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:16.340]  Of big, nice luxury facilities, and nice houses, and nice cars, and vacations, and going where you want, and traveling where you want.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.122]  The globalists don't want a world like that.
[00:41:19.122 --> 00:41:21.624]  Their excuse is, it hurts the Earth.
[00:41:21.624 --> 00:41:26.428]  Headline, why a depression would be good for the carbon footprint, and good for the Earth.
[00:41:26.428 --> 00:41:29.029]  That article was in thousands of publications.
[00:41:29.029 --> 00:41:33.432]  But they're not even trying to turn off the economy to really help the Earth.
[00:41:33.432 --> 00:41:38.116]  They're busy destroying it with GMO, and cross-species garbage, and you name it, as fast as they can.
[00:41:39.753 --> 00:41:47.600]  They're doing it because they want you destitute so they have the money and the power and you have nothing!
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.342]  Where there is freedom, they don't control.
[00:41:50.342 --> 00:41:52.684]  Where there is wealth, they don't control.
[00:41:52.684 --> 00:41:53.065]  Got it?
[00:41:53.065 --> 00:41:54.286]  It's fundamental.
[00:41:54.286 --> 00:41:56.628]  It's not that they don't care about you.
[00:41:56.628 --> 00:41:58.089]  They hate you!
[00:41:58.089 --> 00:41:59.230]  They do care about you.
[00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:06.677]  They care desperately about destroying you and your family and dumbing you down and putting deadly vaccines in you and deadly fluoride in you.
[00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:11.435]  And everyone inherently knows this deep down.
[00:42:11.435 --> 00:42:13.938]  But you can intellectually go check everything I've said.
[00:42:13.938 --> 00:42:18.162]  It's true in triplicate, in spades.
[00:42:18.162 --> 00:42:22.087]  I will never sign on to sterilizing people in Africa.
[00:42:22.087 --> 00:42:26.312]  I will never sign on to injecting Appalachian people with syphilis.
[00:42:26.312 --> 00:42:28.855]  I will never sign on to 54 million abortions.
[00:42:29.975 --> 00:42:36.519]  I will never sign on to any of this, because the minute you sign on to that, ladies and gentlemen, you step over to the other side.
[00:42:36.519 --> 00:42:42.622]  And let me tell you now, you are openly working under the God of this world who wants to destroy your soul.
[00:42:42.622 --> 00:42:46.845]  And you fools out there that don't know what's about that are idiots.
[00:42:46.845 --> 00:42:50.947]  This is 100% spiritual demonic warfare going on.
[00:42:51.906 --> 00:43:01.735]  Manifesting itself on a planetary scale with robots and electric systems controlled by the beast that will micromanage everything we do.
[00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:06.319]  And I got news for you, you're not going to be raptured out of it.
[00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:10.082]  German Christians thought they were going to be raptured in World War II.
[00:43:10.082 --> 00:43:11.163]  Christians in Russia.
[00:43:11.163 --> 00:43:12.264]  Christians in China.
[00:43:12.264 --> 00:43:14.306]  That doctrine is only 200 years old, folks.
[00:43:14.306 --> 00:43:15.087]  It doesn't happen.
[00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:24.262]  And even if you don't believe in God, you better know this system is evil.
[00:43:24.262 --> 00:43:29.964]  They teach psychologists and psychiatrists that there's no good and evil, that you're beyond good and evil.
[00:43:29.964 --> 00:43:32.165]  What baloney!
[00:43:32.165 --> 00:43:42.429]  That's saying you can't have a choice of what you discriminate against, that you believe robbing an old lady and knocking her over the head is evil, and you believe helping an old lady is good.
[00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:43.789]  Yes, there is good and evil.
[00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:44.869]  There is right and wrong.
[00:43:44.869 --> 00:43:46.070]  That's why they've come out and said,
[00:43:47.045 --> 00:43:52.969]  Why, at the grocery store, we can't have gingerbread men or gingerbread women, because that gives people a choice.
[00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:56.491]  It notes a difference, and any difference is evil.
[00:43:56.491 --> 00:43:59.514]  See, that's the opposite of diversity.
[00:43:59.514 --> 00:44:05.177]  Breaking through the binary gender explained using continuums.
[00:44:05.177 --> 00:44:09.961]  Guys, I actually have the photo on my phone, and I want to give it to the guys.
[00:44:09.961 --> 00:44:16.165]  This is being sold in Austin as well, where it says, gender neutral gingerbread person.
[00:44:17.867 --> 00:44:19.408]  And it's about throwing it in your head.
[00:44:19.408 --> 00:44:24.990]  Foreign banks have robbed over a thousand trillion dollars from the worldwide community by design.
[00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.311]  World government's being formed.
[00:44:26.311 --> 00:44:32.133]  Our government's funding Al-Qaeda to chop everybody's heads off that isn't a radical Islamicist.
[00:44:32.133 --> 00:44:33.314]  Our test scores are plummeting.
[00:44:33.314 --> 00:44:35.275]  Cancer's exploding.
[00:44:35.275 --> 00:44:36.515]  The border's wide open.
[00:44:36.515 --> 00:44:38.096]  They're letting Ebola come into the country.
[00:44:38.096 --> 00:44:38.156]  And
[00:44:44.423 --> 00:44:51.208]  The mayor of Houston wants to arrest preachers and is subpoenaing them because they've criticized homosexuality.
[00:44:51.208 --> 00:44:57.413]  What a terrorist over the First Amendment.
[00:44:57.413 --> 00:45:02.277]  Gender inclusive school district says drop boys and girls, call kids purple penguins.
[00:45:03.612 --> 00:45:15.939]  Just screwing these kids up big time that there's something wrong with being a girl, something wrong with being a boy, something wrong with girls wanting to be pretty and have fun, and something wrong with boys wanting to be tough and build things.
[00:45:15.939 --> 00:45:19.541]  This is a bunch of social engineers literally ruling you.
[00:45:19.541 --> 00:45:23.744]  Austin City Council approves gender neutral bathrooms.
[00:45:23.744 --> 00:45:25.345]  Gonna make you go in the bathroom.
[00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.854]  I've actually been in restaurants and hotels where it says man and woman.
[00:45:30.854 --> 00:45:36.099]  You gotta go to the bathroom and you walk in and there's a woman coming out of the stall.
[00:45:36.099 --> 00:45:38.642]  And I just leave.
[00:45:38.642 --> 00:45:42.106]  I'm not gonna go sit on the toilet next to a woman.
[00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:45.189]  So you control freaks can have your way, man!
[00:45:45.189 --> 00:45:46.591]  What is your problem, fruits?
[00:45:48.786 --> 00:45:49.647]  And they're not fruits.
[00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:50.829]  It's social engineering.
[00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:52.391]  Overturn existing orders.
[00:45:52.391 --> 00:45:54.173]  Make us do whatever they want.
[00:45:54.173 --> 00:45:56.076]  Screw with everybody continually.
[00:45:56.076 --> 00:46:02.004]  If you want to go get a sex change, or you like to wear dresses, or you want to... Man, I'm not in your business.
[00:46:02.004 --> 00:46:04.627]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:46:04.627 --> 00:46:06.049]  But you're not really liberals.
[00:46:07.273 --> 00:46:12.556]  At the top, you're a bunch of sick control freaks that want to go in and sexualize five-year-old children.
[00:46:12.556 --> 00:46:13.577]  They have a name for that.
[00:46:13.577 --> 00:46:15.258]  It's called NAMBLA.
[00:46:15.258 --> 00:46:17.279]  And by the way, the UN accepts NAMBLA.
[00:46:17.279 --> 00:46:25.805]  And they've had top UN members, top Australian judges, top British judges come out and say, well, people should be able to date your five-year-old.
[00:46:25.805 --> 00:46:30.608]  If your neighbor wants to date your five-year-old, they should be able to.
[00:46:30.608 --> 00:46:31.929]  Literally.
[00:46:31.929 --> 00:46:32.309]  Look it up.
[00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:38.997]  See, they're now saying kids can give consent to have vaccines and be paid by the school to get them.
[00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:41.119]  Well, why can't kids then drink liquor?
[00:46:41.119 --> 00:46:44.261]  If you're an adult and give liquor to your neighbor's kid, you go to jail.
[00:46:44.261 --> 00:46:49.283]  And you should if you're pushing a bunch of liquor on them because you're contributing to the delinquency of minors.
[00:46:49.283 --> 00:46:51.125]  You have violated the age of consent.
[00:46:51.125 --> 00:46:55.247]  Just like if you're, you know, 18, you're dating a 16-year-old, I don't think that's statutory rape.
[00:46:55.247 --> 00:46:56.628]  But they'll throw the book at you for that.
[00:46:57.591 --> 00:47:05.296]  But schools can then go in and mess with a seven-year-old and sexualize them, and that's okay because it's politically correct.
[00:47:05.296 --> 00:47:06.957]  See how screwed up this is?
[00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:13.701]  Meanwhile, it was declassified in 1993 in Australia.
[00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:15.202]  Israel's Knesset released some of it in 2000.
[00:47:15.202 --> 00:47:17.303]  The British released some of it in 2000.
[00:47:17.303 --> 00:47:18.804]  The U.S.
[00:47:18.804 --> 00:47:20.565]  admitted some of it in 2000 as well.
[00:47:20.565 --> 00:47:22.066]  It was in the Austin American Statesman.
[00:47:24.423 --> 00:47:35.812]  And the response of PNAC, Project for a New American Century, headed up by Dick Cheney, was to publish in newspapers all over the country an article calling for the legitimate use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:47:35.812 --> 00:47:43.318]  The statesman, to its credit, as I mentioned yesterday, type in race-specific bioweapons, PNAC, and then click Google.
[00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:44.940]  It'll probably pull up the statesman.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.481]  The statesman came out and decried it.
[00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:51.588]  Kind of a real liberal thing to do, not a fake liberal thing to do.
[00:47:51.588 --> 00:47:53.289]  This is the insanity show.
[00:47:53.289 --> 00:47:57.731]  We've got governments with bioweapon labs all over the world creating airborne Ebola.
[00:47:57.731 --> 00:48:00.112]  I played the Nova special for you.
[00:48:00.112 --> 00:48:01.753]  All this.
[00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:04.595]  They're creating stuff to quote kill the Kafirs.
[00:48:04.595 --> 00:48:08.076]  That's the N word in South African.
[00:48:08.076 --> 00:48:09.397]  Israel wanted it for the Arabs.
[00:48:09.397 --> 00:48:11.818]  That's been declassified.
[00:48:11.818 --> 00:48:13.219]  That was in Jane's Weapons Quarterly in 2000.
[00:48:15.856 --> 00:48:18.938]  And what is the response of publications every day?
[00:48:18.938 --> 00:48:20.800]  Alex Jones is insane.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.002]  There is no plan to kill Africans.
[00:48:23.002 --> 00:48:23.862]  Bull!
[00:48:23.862 --> 00:48:24.603]  Bull!
[00:48:24.603 --> 00:48:25.263]  Bull!
[00:48:25.263 --> 00:48:30.948]  And those reporters all know it's been in newspapers hundreds of times and has admitted this is going on.
[00:48:30.948 --> 00:48:34.391]  So the minute you come out and say I'm a liar, well I'm trying to stop this.
[00:48:35.684 --> 00:48:38.505]  Means you're aiding and abetting it, and you've now signed on to it.
[00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:43.887]  So you think about why you've got such bad luck, why you're so unhappy, why bad things happen to your kids.
[00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:46.308]  It's because you are serving evil.
[00:48:46.308 --> 00:48:48.369]  Let me give evil people a newsflash.
[00:48:48.369 --> 00:48:51.570]  You will pay for evil when you're alive.
[00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.650]  You will not escape judgment.
[00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.291]  I got news for you.
[00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:57.672]  I know all these evil people have hellish lives, the worst luck you've ever seen.
[00:48:57.672 --> 00:49:00.073]  Let me tell you, I'm God-fearing.
[00:49:00.073 --> 00:49:04.015]  I don't believe I get my good luck because, you know, I'm trying to be good.
[00:49:04.015 --> 00:49:04.415]  I do it
[00:49:06.283 --> 00:49:11.729]  Out of a fear of God and wanting to help people, and a drive to defend the innocent.
[00:49:11.729 --> 00:49:14.833]  Not because I'm a hero, but because that's a default position.
[00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:16.555]  Let's go to this clip, and then we'll go to break.
[00:49:16.555 --> 00:49:21.020]  But here is the documentary admitting, with the doctor himself, the bioweapon program.
[00:49:22.253 --> 00:49:23.535]  Larry was a wonderful fellow.
[00:49:23.535 --> 00:49:24.857]  Mad as a hatter.
[00:49:24.857 --> 00:49:37.456]  He used to rock up in South Africa having flown intercontinental flights with a trousers pocket full of goodies in sealed vials that he claimed were new and wonderful organisms and could do the most wonderful things on Earth.
[00:49:40.808 --> 00:49:50.334]  Larry Ford had mutated cholera, typhoid, anthrax, botulism, bubonic plague, and had also come up with germs that he called kaffir-killing germs.
[00:49:50.334 --> 00:49:56.098]  Kaffir, as you may know, in Afrikaans, is the equivalent of the n-word.
[00:49:56.098 --> 00:50:01.562]  So these are germs that were specifically engineered to kill only black people.
[00:50:01.562 --> 00:50:05.985]  In other words, an ethnic biological weapon.
[00:50:05.985 --> 00:50:07.926]  Had Project Coast really gone this far?
[00:50:10.703 --> 00:50:20.749]  From the beginning, this idea of can we find a way to control the size of the black population was considered one of the most important areas of research.
[00:50:20.749 --> 00:50:29.093]  It got even more important over time as the size of the black population and the seriousness of the uprisings increased.
[00:50:29.093 --> 00:50:35.517]  So that's one reason why they got into genetic modification.
[00:50:35.517 --> 00:50:36.578]  We're going to come back.
[00:50:36.578 --> 00:50:38.679]  I want to play this whole eight minute clip.
[00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.672]  And then the average liberal said, well, there aren't too many black people.
[00:50:45.672 --> 00:50:46.773]  And I go, oh, you're a liberal.
[00:50:46.773 --> 00:50:48.876]  And it's only a cover, folks.
[00:50:48.876 --> 00:50:55.563]  With most of these so-called liberals, you get behind closed doors, they're flaming racists, including black ones against other blacks.
[00:50:55.563 --> 00:50:56.964]  These people are sick.
[00:50:56.964 --> 00:50:57.505]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.605 --> 00:51:02.307]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:51:58.909 --> 00:52:01.751]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:06.875]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:15.001]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:19.524]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:19.524 --> 00:52:23.327]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.487 --> 00:52:29.431]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.431 --> 00:52:32.593]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:32.593 --> 00:52:37.957]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:37.957 --> 00:52:46.142]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alextoday for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:53.787 --> 00:53:02.770]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:06.871]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[00:53:06.871 --> 00:53:12.313]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?

[00:54:08.905 --> 00:54:12.126]  Coming up, Feds have announced another potential surge coming.
[00:54:12.126 --> 00:54:18.849]  More asylum officers hired, so they can then complete the smuggling process to bring them into the country.
[00:54:18.849 --> 00:54:22.610]  And they've got a Time Magazine article saying, let's fix it, let's end human driving.
[00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:26.331]  And they go on to say there'll be no more human driving within 10 years.
[00:54:26.331 --> 00:54:27.692]  People say, oh, that's just their opinion.
[00:54:27.692 --> 00:54:28.672]  No, they'll do it.
[00:54:28.672 --> 00:54:29.833]  And people will roll over to it.
[00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.133]  It's what they do.
[00:54:31.133 --> 00:54:32.114]  People love to be slaves.
[00:54:32.114 --> 00:54:33.454]  It's so much fun.
[00:54:33.454 --> 00:54:35.895]  It's for the earth and it's trendy and you're racist if you don't do it.
[00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:38.335]  Let me just stop right there.
[00:54:38.335 --> 00:54:43.138]  No, I think we can turn this back if we're aware of the fact that it's not the trendy, cool, new thing.
[00:54:43.138 --> 00:54:47.480]  It's a system of oppression and control.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:56.166]  Now, John Bowne filed this report for InfoWars Nightly News last night, but I want to air it right now, here on the radio, dealing with Ebola, not
[00:54:56.946 --> 00:55:02.632]  Just living 21 days in the body, but 41 in a certain percentage, and 70 days in sperm.
[00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:10.040]  So why are they letting people out yesterday, 40 plus people, that were quarantined only 21 days after they didn't show signs?
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.062]  This is of great concern.
[00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:17.494]  The fiancé of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan will be released from quarantine today.
[00:55:17.494 --> 00:55:26.666]  However, the CDC-mandated 21-day quarantine period Louise Troh along with her son and two nephews endured is only half of the recommended period.
[00:55:27.227 --> 00:55:39.011]  The World Health Organization states, recent studies conducted in West Africa have demonstrated that 95% of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the range of 1 to 21 days.
[00:55:39.011 --> 00:55:43.813]  98% have an incubation period that falls within the 1 to 42 day interval.
[00:55:43.813 --> 00:55:50.896]  The World Health Organization is therefore confident that detection of no new cases with active surveillance in place
[00:55:51.496 --> 00:55:56.600]  Throughout this 42-day period means that an Ebola outbreak is indeed over.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:03.685]  Drexel University professor Charles Haas released a study of the literature behind the Ebola incubation period.
[00:56:03.685 --> 00:56:09.430]  The 21-day incubation period is based on the general rule held for all infectious diseases.
[00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:15.815]  The lower the initial dose of the microorganisms you have, the longer it will take for them to accumulate to a critical level.
[00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:34.444]  Haas discovered that according to the statistics generated from the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and the earlier outbreak in Congo in 1995, there is up to a 12% chance that someone infected with Ebola may take longer than 21 days to show symptoms of the disease.
[00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:43.934]  The World Health Organization does not declare an Ebola outbreak contained per country until that country has passed the 42-day incubation period.
[00:56:43.934 --> 00:56:50.501]  Nigeria reached the 42-day milestone after an outbreak of 19 cases began on July 23rd.
[00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:55.346]  The Clean Bill of Health for Nigeria can also be attributed to the rapid shutdown of its borders.
[00:56:55.566 --> 00:57:02.840]  With Cameroon, Chad and Benin, the death toll in West Africa has now reached 4,500 people.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.784]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:57:05.458 --> 00:57:06.719]  That's right.
[00:57:06.719 --> 00:57:09.622]  A bunch of news I'm going to get into when we start the second hour.
[00:57:09.622 --> 00:57:11.724]  We'll also take some calls.
[00:57:11.724 --> 00:57:15.047]  And then we have Freer Ricky Ross on CIA drug trafficking.
[00:57:15.047 --> 00:57:19.271]  He was there, knew Gary Webb, big part of the new film that just came out, Killed a Messenger.
[00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:23.215]  He's been a frequent guest on the show, even from prison, over the last decade.
[00:57:23.215 --> 00:57:24.697]  He's out of prison now.
[00:57:24.697 --> 00:57:25.578]  That is coming up.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:49.815]  Before I go any further, what I'm personally doing, not just because of Ebola, but because of all of the attacks on our immune system, all the superbugs, the MRSA, you name it, where this stuff needs to grow and get critical mass in the body first, is I'm getting purified water, non-GMO food, as much sunlight as I can, rest for my children as well, and then things like X2 survival shield, supernation iodine from Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:57.180]  In my view, and many experts feel like Dr. Grubb, he believes it's just as important as colloidal silver overall.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:00.344]  I mean, it is so important across the board in the body, it's essential.
[00:58:00.344 --> 00:58:04.848]  If you don't have iodine, you will die, just like oxygen or vitamin C.
[00:58:06.294 --> 00:58:11.781]  And so many people are deficient, and they've lowered what they claim you need of it just down to almost nothing.
[00:58:11.781 --> 00:58:14.144]  Soon they'll probably say you don't even need it, just hurry up and die.
[00:58:14.144 --> 00:58:17.349]  Infowarslives.com, Survival Shield X2.
[00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:23.256]  And don't forget, the oxy powder that flushes out your guts, 70% of the immune system is in the guts, give your...
[00:58:23.817 --> 00:58:24.637]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:24.637 --> 00:58:25.258]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.438 --> 00:58:59.103]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:09.028]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:59:09.028 --> 00:59:11.950]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.430]  I think?
[00:59:27.188 --> 00:59:28.409]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:06.574]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.574 --> 01:00:08.335]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:10.096]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.096 --> 01:00:11.676]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.217]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.217 --> 01:00:17.419]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.419 --> 01:00:19.761]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:00:20.641 --> 01:00:22.382]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.382 --> 01:00:26.263]  John Bowne filed a couple reports this week dealing with Ebola.
[01:00:26.263 --> 01:00:31.344]  One of them is titled, The Super Wealthy Elite's Agenda for Depopulation.
[01:00:31.344 --> 01:00:46.968]  So I thought we'd play that special report from the Nightly News on Monday, here on the Tuesday edition, just to illustrate and document the type of people we're dealing with, who are actually managing much of the Ebola response, now that we have the new Ebola czar.
[01:00:47.908 --> 01:00:51.772]  Coming out saying the main problem is overpopulation in Africa.
[01:00:51.772 --> 01:00:53.994]  That's Ron Klain's statement.
[01:00:53.994 --> 01:01:00.019]  Let's go ahead and dovetail that with this special report.
[01:01:00.019 --> 01:01:05.244]  Then we'll take your phone calls in the next segment.
[01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:10.789]  His Royal Highness Prince Charles, who can trace his ancestry back to Romania's dark and distant past.
[01:01:11.698 --> 01:01:16.122]  The genealogy shows that I'm descended from Vlad the Impaler, you see.
[01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:18.104]  So I do have a bit of a stake in the country.
[01:01:18.104 --> 01:01:18.624]  As it were.
[01:01:18.624 --> 01:01:20.526]  Skimming people alive.
[01:01:20.526 --> 01:01:23.108]  Forcing mothers to devour their own children.
[01:01:23.108 --> 01:01:27.612]  According to your own senses, you killed over a hundred thousand people.
[01:01:27.612 --> 01:01:29.613]  Forgeries and lies.
[01:01:29.613 --> 01:01:33.277]  Do you deny that you murdered your own people?
[01:01:33.277 --> 01:01:35.338]  Those who broke the law were punished!
[01:01:35.338 --> 01:01:37.940]  What do you see as the biggest challenges in conservation?
[01:01:38.701 --> 01:01:41.607]  Yeah, the growing human population.
[01:01:41.607 --> 01:01:43.651]  Because where we are, there's nothing else.
[01:01:43.651 --> 01:01:47.158]  And do you have views about what should be done about that?
[01:01:48.624 --> 01:01:49.725]  Don't you guess?
[01:01:49.725 --> 01:01:52.467]  We've got to stabilize the population.
[01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:56.131]  When I was born, there were too many people.
[01:01:56.131 --> 01:01:58.773]  That's why we have global warming.
[01:01:58.773 --> 01:02:02.316]  We have global warming because too many people are using too much stuff.
[01:02:02.316 --> 01:02:14.626]  Back in 1997, when Ted Turner announced his historic support for the United Nations, no one could have known how the foundation would evolve and what its role would be.
[01:02:15.567 --> 01:02:21.469]  Today, we know that Ted Turner has delivered beyond anyone's best hopes.
[01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:25.810]  The UN Foundation has become the United Nations' best friend.
[01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:35.393]  The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident.
[01:02:35.393 --> 01:02:37.294]  New World Order, Mr. Rothschild.
[01:02:37.294 --> 01:02:37.854]  New World Order.
[01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:41.263]  Depopulation.
[01:02:41.263 --> 01:02:43.546]  Genocide.
[01:02:43.546 --> 01:02:45.769]  This equation has four factors.
[01:02:45.769 --> 01:02:47.050]  A little bit of multiplication.
[01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:51.375]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:53.758]  And that's going to be based on the number of people.
[01:02:54.719 --> 01:03:05.222]  The services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[01:03:05.222 --> 01:03:10.724]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[01:03:10.724 --> 01:03:13.765]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[01:03:13.765 --> 01:03:18.427]  Now that's, that's lies to algebra, but let's, let's take a look.
[01:03:19.969 --> 01:03:32.820]  The myth of overpopulation originated in England in 1798, when a vicar named Thomas Malthus, who fancied himself something of a mathematician, saw that food production increased incrementally, but people reproduced exponentially.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.524]  He sat down and did some simple math, and summarily decided that the world would be out of food by 1890.
[01:03:38.524 --> 01:03:44.529]  He blamed reduced mortality rates, and recommended killing off the have-nots of society, lest the haves starve to death.
[01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:54.242]  This cry was taken up by Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in 1968, who claimed that reckless human reproduction had overwhelmed the Earth.
[01:03:54.242 --> 01:04:00.330]  Massive famines would result, which would destroy, best case scenario, one-fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s.
[01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.451]  And the planet would follow.
[01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:12.399]  This fear produced large donations for the newly created UNFPA, which thrives on an imagined crisis that has been both imminent and rescheduled again and again over the past two centuries.
[01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:23.606]  The truth of the matter is that every family on this planet could have a house with a yard and all live together on a landmass the size of Texas, which is really just a small corner of the planet.
[01:04:23.606 --> 01:04:28.349]  The population of Earth will peak in 30 years and then start to go back down.
[01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:29.450]  We're not overpopulated.
[01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:30.470]  Do the math.
[01:04:32.878 --> 01:04:35.198]  And you ain't in it.
[01:04:35.198 --> 01:04:39.419]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:04:39.419 --> 01:04:40.280]  Thank you, George Carlin.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.340]  Thank you, John Bowne, putting that report together.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:52.962]  But remember, they're doing everything they can to block new technologies to empower humans, and they're doing everything they can to balloon the dumbed-down population.
[01:04:52.962 --> 01:04:55.803]  So they have an excuse to then cull everybody.
[01:04:55.803 --> 01:04:57.163]  You understand it's a master plan.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.700]  The experts are clear.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:07.803]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:14.085]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:05:14.085 --> 01:05:22.028]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:05:22.028 --> 01:05:27.050]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:28.351]  Not our iodine.
[01:05:28.351 --> 01:05:34.694]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:05:59.213 --> 01:06:09.779]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:06:09.779 --> 01:06:16.242]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:16.242 --> 01:06:18.564]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:06:18.564 --> 01:06:21.665]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:06:21.665 --> 01:06:28.529]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:06:29.009 --> 01:06:32.671]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:32.671 --> 01:06:36.952]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:38.733]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:46.596]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:46.596 --> 01:06:47.736]  But for how long?
[01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:54.359]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:54.359 --> 01:06:57.180]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:58.464 --> 01:07:05.631]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:05.631 --> 01:07:07.973]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:07.973 --> 01:07:13.257]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:13.257 --> 01:07:18.202]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:18.422 --> 01:07:21.723]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:21.723 --> 01:07:25.805]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:25.805 --> 01:07:30.127]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:30.127 --> 01:07:40.371]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:40.371 --> 01:07:42.872]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:43.933 --> 01:07:51.284]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:55.250]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.972 --> 01:08:08.599]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.599 --> 01:08:13.043]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.043 --> 01:08:19.049]  Here's some of the incredibly important headlines at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:08:19.049 --> 01:08:23.193]  British Spy Chief Calls for Crackdown on Internet Freedom.
[01:08:24.676 --> 01:08:31.059]  Wayne Madsen, formerly of the NSA, says Ebola epidemic linked to CIA and special report.
[01:08:31.059 --> 01:08:36.102]  Obama's Ebola czar thinks there are too many people in Africa.
[01:08:36.102 --> 01:08:42.866]  Scientists have come out and said Ebola can spread by air in cold weather because the sunlight can't kill it.
[01:08:45.157 --> 01:08:56.929]  So we have Army reports and others in this Kit Daniels article saying that they believe it could go airborne in the winter and that it is indeed airborne in below about 45 degrees.
[01:08:56.929 --> 01:09:00.672]  Go read the CDC, the UN, and the Army reports.
[01:09:00.672 --> 01:09:04.156]  It's red linked on Infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:06.358]  He spent four days writing the article.
[01:09:06.358 --> 01:09:07.780]  It's very well documented.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.640]  It has screenshots.
[01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:25.741]  of the UN manuals, the CDC, the textbooks show that CBS News and International Business Times and Mother Jones and everyone else can say that we're insane and none of this is happening.
[01:09:25.741 --> 01:09:31.746]  Just like we said, bringing in people that had Ebola to Europe and the US would probably spread it, and it has.
[01:09:31.746 --> 01:09:33.687]  So that's the news we've got up there.
[01:09:33.687 --> 01:09:36.850]  Meanwhile, British spy chief calls for crackdown on internet freedom.
[01:09:38.570 --> 01:10:01.340]  Why do you think all the libertarian or pro-America, pro-free market websites from DrudgeReport.com to WorldNetDaily.com to Infowars.com, the top 10 sites basically, Drudge on down, all had their Alexa traffic, the big Amazon.com traffic service that I've been watching for 16 years at least.
[01:10:02.512 --> 01:10:09.339]  Why do you think they suddenly just said we have no visitors, but if you have a subscription you can see that our listeners and our viewers are exploding?
[01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:10.621]  People visiting the sites.
[01:10:10.621 --> 01:10:16.467]  And every socialist anti-American site from CNN, MSNBC, to Media Matters exploded.
[01:10:16.467 --> 01:10:24.276]  Because on the back end they're imploding, and so it embarrasses them that InfoWars.com is literally
[01:10:25.436 --> 01:10:33.485]  I was looking at a few months ago, it was like 14,000 times more visitors or something than Media Matters, 2,000 times plus more than MSNBC.
[01:10:33.485 --> 01:10:37.088]  I mean, it's not just that we dominate them, they're a joke.
[01:10:37.088 --> 01:10:39.451]  And so they can't let people know that.
[01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:45.658]  And then Drudge, tens of thousands of times more visitors, literally, go to the math, he got a billion.
[01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.332]  Visitors a month at MSNBC gets a few million?
[01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.853]  I mean, they're a joke!
[01:10:50.853 --> 01:10:51.894]  They're a joke!
[01:10:51.894 --> 01:10:54.495]  Listen, it doesn't matter if you rig everything.
[01:10:54.495 --> 01:10:56.857]  Everyone knows where the audience is.
[01:10:56.857 --> 01:10:58.738]  So now they just want to censor the web to begin with.
[01:10:58.738 --> 01:11:05.442]  So, don't take InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for granted or any other site.
[01:11:05.442 --> 01:11:07.723]  And don't take AM and FM for granted.
[01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:10.344]  They're trying to bring in fairness doctrine and restrict free speech there.
[01:11:10.344 --> 01:11:12.946]  The FCC announced two weeks ago they want to regulate the Internet.
[01:11:15.387 --> 01:11:16.768]  They got internet kill switches in.
[01:11:16.768 --> 01:11:20.570]  They got Obama messages over the smartphones.
[01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:26.935]  They will cheat, folks, because we are literally cleaning their clocks up one side and down the other.
[01:11:26.935 --> 01:11:28.316]  Because we're the patriots.
[01:11:28.316 --> 01:11:30.197]  We're the real liberals.
[01:11:30.197 --> 01:11:31.938]  Like, your house is yours.
[01:11:31.938 --> 01:11:32.839]  Your money is yours.
[01:11:32.839 --> 01:11:33.960]  Your guns are yours.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.921]  Your family belongs to you and them.
[01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:37.942]  Not the state.
[01:11:37.942 --> 01:11:43.166]  This is cult-level totalitarianism dressed up saying it's liberal.
[01:11:44.073 --> 01:11:46.475]  With a sycophantic NPR voice.
[01:11:46.475 --> 01:11:52.439]  Financed by David Rockefeller on record.
[01:11:52.439 --> 01:11:53.920]  Now here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.362]  I'm going to take some calls ahead of Free Ricky Ross joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:11:57.362 --> 01:12:01.305]  Big whistleblower on CIA drug dealing.
[01:12:01.305 --> 01:12:02.505]  Big part of the new film.
[01:12:02.505 --> 01:12:03.826]  It's really a documentary in my view.
[01:12:03.826 --> 01:12:04.847]  Big hit film.
[01:12:04.847 --> 01:12:05.968]  Kill the Messenger.
[01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:10.251]  Guys, will you give me the Wikipedia or IMDB printout and all that so I have it all accurate when it comes up?
[01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:10.531]  Thank you.
[01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.288]  I knew Ricky Ross.
[01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:16.471]  I talked a lot about it last week when I saw the film.
[01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:19.975]  It just dumbfounded me how accurate it was.
[01:12:19.975 --> 01:12:22.758]  And I'm really surprised by Hollywood putting something this truthful out.
[01:12:22.758 --> 01:12:24.400]  Good job.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:31.707]  But see, if you didn't know Gary Webb and hadn't been interviewing Ricky Ross for 10 years, I interviewed Ricky Ross in prison.
[01:12:31.707 --> 01:12:34.630]  You just don't know how accurate it is and how the actor
[01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:39.435]  Renner looks just like a younger Gary Webb.
[01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:44.317]  By the time he got his head blown off in 2004, he looked like he does at the end of the movie.
[01:12:44.317 --> 01:12:46.018]  But it just makes my head spin.
[01:12:46.018 --> 01:12:47.339]  That's coming up.
[01:12:47.339 --> 01:12:48.619]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:48.619 --> 01:12:53.201]  And guys, my phone system needs to be rebooted.
[01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:54.061]  Just a little tip.
[01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:56.982]  If you see it saying it's turned off, then we can reboot it.
[01:12:56.982 --> 01:12:57.663]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:57.663 --> 01:12:59.143]  So we're going to take your phone calls.
[01:12:59.143 --> 01:12:59.203]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:59.203 --> 01:12:59.263]  Now,
[01:13:06.613 --> 01:13:11.815]  All of that said, let me hit some more of these headlines.
[01:13:11.815 --> 01:13:12.195]  U.S.
[01:13:12.195 --> 01:13:17.157]  cautiously optimistic after no new Ebola cases in five days.
[01:13:17.157 --> 01:13:20.259]  I think there's evidence of them covering up the real number of cases.
[01:13:20.259 --> 01:13:26.301]  Do you really believe that they gave them to two nurses that knew what they were doing and then nobody else on airplanes or anything's gotten it?
[01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:29.142]  And they're releasing people after 21 days when they now go, oh, it's actually 41.
[01:13:32.022 --> 01:13:36.805]  And they're letting more West African flights come in with all this projectile vomit and people dying, vomiting.
[01:13:36.805 --> 01:13:39.587]  But they say before they're even tested, everything's fine.
[01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:39.907]  I don't know.
[01:13:39.907 --> 01:13:40.848]  What do you think?
[01:13:40.848 --> 01:13:46.632]  Obama repeats, you can't get Ebola on bus day after bus quarantine in D.C.
[01:13:46.632 --> 01:13:53.596]  Folks, nurses in protective gear got it.
[01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:56.738]  Here and in Spain, okay?
[01:13:56.738 --> 01:13:57.018]  U.N.
[01:13:57.018 --> 01:13:58.820]  workers in total protective gear are getting it.
[01:13:59.722 --> 01:14:02.985]  Undoubtedly our troops, some of them are going to get it.
[01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:06.568]  So Obama's statements are just purely hollow.
[01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:14.035]  Ebola study projects spread of virus on overseas flights, Wall Street Journal.
[01:14:14.035 --> 01:14:19.359]  And the computer models show that they believe
[01:14:20.734 --> 01:14:24.635]  That it will end up getting on airplanes.
[01:14:24.635 --> 01:14:36.139]  The upshot is that, quote, controlling the outbreak at the source is the most important thing that needs to happen to prevent the international spread of the virus, said Carmen Kahn, an infectious disease physician at St.
[01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:40.321]  Michael's Hospital in Toronto and the lead author of the study.
[01:14:40.321 --> 01:14:42.301]  So let's just let them get on the airplanes, I guess.
[01:14:45.811 --> 01:14:51.073]  CDC's released Ebola gear guidelines that say you need tougher equipment to protect yourself.
[01:14:51.073 --> 01:14:57.016]  Yeah, they said someone could vomit directly on you, and if you didn't have an open sore or something, you wouldn't get sick.
[01:14:57.016 --> 01:15:00.238]  Total bull!
[01:15:00.238 --> 01:15:04.620]  And meanwhile, Ebola patients are just vanishing in places like Liberia.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.820]  They're just throwing them into camps.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.242]  So clearly, even mainstream news admits there's a cover-up of what the real numbers are.
[01:15:12.779 --> 01:15:14.821]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[01:15:14.821 --> 01:15:20.347]  Governor Jindal of Louisiana orders Louisiana to develop Ebola plans.
[01:15:20.347 --> 01:15:26.353]  Rick Perry has come back out again and said they should shut down the West African flights.
[01:15:26.353 --> 01:15:34.001]  NBC's Schneiderman, who said just take your bleepin' vaccine, who got caught breaking quarantine, faces credibility issues, AP reports.
[01:15:37.148 --> 01:15:44.831]  New Ebola czar will skip congressional hearing Friday after being a no-show at the first two White House Ebola meetings since Obama named him as a point man.
[01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:48.612]  Yeah, and he has no medical background, but he does think there's too many Africans.
[01:15:48.612 --> 01:15:51.693]  So, that's, that's, you know, he is part of eugenics.
[01:15:51.693 --> 01:15:56.935]  So, he's doing a great job not helping and not showing up.
[01:15:56.935 --> 01:16:00.617]  Let's go to some phone calls, then I'll get into what I mentioned earlier, Time Magazine.
[01:16:00.617 --> 01:16:02.457]  Let's fix it!
[01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:03.838]  Let's end human driving!
[01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:06.642]  Here's what will happen.
[01:16:06.642 --> 01:16:14.906]  The initial use of drivers anywhere autonomous cars, I call them auto cars, will be the companies like Uber rather than individually owned.
[01:16:14.906 --> 01:16:18.547]  They will rapidly gain acceptance because they will save people time.
[01:16:18.547 --> 01:16:21.549]  Imagine all you could do in the time currently spent behind the wheel.
[01:16:22.489 --> 01:16:29.833]  ...with lower the cost of getting from one place to another and will be way faster while all being safer than human driving.
[01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:39.898]  Soon thereafter, in adoption skyrocket, cities will designate areas that are auto car only lanes of highways will become auto car exclusive, allowing for more density driving and higher speeds.
[01:16:39.898 --> 01:16:42.880]  Roughly 10 years from now, we will see the end of human driving.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.381]  The seminal moment.
[01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:48.023]  Yes, as the machines take full control of everything, run by who?
[01:16:48.023 --> 01:16:50.044]  The globalists who want us dead!
[01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.003]  The ghost running this machine is Beelzebub.
[01:16:55.003 --> 01:16:57.464]  Not a good system.
[01:16:57.464 --> 01:17:06.109]  And if you're not a good globalist, can't get on a train, can't get in a car, your whole house will be wired with everything in it already to track and spy and tax you and surveil you.
[01:17:06.109 --> 01:17:09.571]  I mean, it's just a nightmare system and we're letting them build it.
[01:17:09.571 --> 01:17:15.395]  So we better shut it down as consumers now before their Panopticon Skynet's in place.
[01:17:15.395 --> 01:17:17.116]  Chris in Georgia on Ebola.
[01:17:17.116 --> 01:17:20.017]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:17:20.017 --> 01:17:20.638]  Alex?
[01:17:20.638 --> 01:17:20.878]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:27.063]  Sure.
[01:17:27.063 --> 01:17:29.204]  Where's Dr. Len Horowitz and all of this?
[01:17:29.204 --> 01:17:34.327]  I remember back in the 90s, he came to Atlanta and he gave lectures.
[01:17:34.327 --> 01:17:37.229]  In fact, I think you interviewed him one time, too.
[01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:40.351]  Lectures to hundreds of people.
[01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:43.954]  And I really think he was the one that broke this originally.
[01:17:43.954 --> 01:17:46.695]  He had a book called AIDS and Ebola.
[01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:49.137]  And I remember in his lectures that he gave us,
[01:17:50.106 --> 01:17:58.062]  He held up his book and he said, and I have the contracts, the contracts to prove that this stuff was made.
[01:17:58.855 --> 01:17:59.675]  Artificially.
[01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:03.156]  In this book, and I bought one of the books, I don't have it anymore, I gave it to an analyst.
[01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:11.378]  Sure, I mean, we played a BBC clip earlier and went over articles where they have these scientists admitting they weaponized Ebola and other things.
[01:18:11.378 --> 01:18:14.919]  So that's on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:15.779]  But I hear you.
[01:18:15.779 --> 01:18:18.200]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Maine.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.621]  Rob, you're on the air.
[01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:24.501]  Go ahead.
[01:18:24.501 --> 01:18:26.962]  Yes, Alex.
[01:18:26.962 --> 01:18:27.542]  Would you please
[01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:31.151]  Stop saying literally every two seconds.
[01:18:31.151 --> 01:18:35.192]  Literally, literally, literally, literally, literally, literally.
[01:18:35.192 --> 01:18:37.312]  Literally this, literally that.
[01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:38.252]  I do say it too much.
[01:18:38.252 --> 01:18:43.694]  Most talk show hosts go uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[01:18:43.694 --> 01:18:44.654]  Literally.
[01:18:44.654 --> 01:18:45.194]  Literally.
[01:18:45.194 --> 01:18:50.795]  Well the fun part about it is we don't screen your phone calls so people can call in and say whatever they want and do whatever they want.
[01:18:50.795 --> 01:18:51.996]  Literally.
[01:18:51.996 --> 01:18:57.517]  You can literally, listen, I listen to my show sometimes literally for an hour and I have to turn it off.
[01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:02.347]  Because I don't like all my tics and all my issues, I try my best.
[01:19:02.347 --> 01:19:03.767]  I've said that many times.
[01:19:03.767 --> 01:19:08.029]  Sometimes I hear my show and it sounds like the most powerful talk radio I've ever heard.
[01:19:08.029 --> 01:19:12.371]  Other times it sounds like a monkey doing you-know-what with a football.
[01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:14.171]  So I hear ya, and let's just have a big round of boos for Alex Jones.
[01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:14.712]  Turn the mic on.
[01:19:14.712 --> 01:19:28.037]  Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[01:19:28.427 --> 01:19:32.591]  And then literally a few minutes after that, I hear you.
[01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:35.073]  When I say literally, I mean I'm not kidding.
[01:19:35.073 --> 01:19:37.936]  I mean literally.
[01:19:37.936 --> 01:19:39.197]  Literally, literally, literally.
[01:19:39.197 --> 01:19:41.899]  Alright, now I'm being obnoxious.
[01:19:41.899 --> 01:19:44.522]  A lot of times I feel myself about to say literally and I just do it.
[01:19:44.522 --> 01:19:51.128]  I can say I'm not kidding or for real or this is straight shooting.
[01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:54.851]  I gotta have a few ticks, folks.
[01:19:54.851 --> 01:19:56.972]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:19:56.972 --> 01:19:57.733]  Stay with us.
[01:19:57.733 --> 01:20:00.214]  Dave, Jeff, Mike, Kevin, and others.
[01:20:00.214 --> 01:20:05.637]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.
[01:20:05.637 --> 01:20:10.260]  It's safe for your enamel, giving you a beautiful polish and a dentist-like clean after every use.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.923]  My Magic Mud is also the perfect remedy for pain caused by sensitivity.

[01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:34.548]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[01:20:34.548 --> 01:20:36.529]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[01:20:36.529 --> 01:20:40.312]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.

[01:20:44.494 --> 01:20:51.219]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.

[01:20:58.672 --> 01:21:01.515]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:01.515 --> 01:21:06.619]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:06.619 --> 01:21:14.767]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:14.767 --> 01:21:19.291]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:23.074]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.234 --> 01:21:29.178]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.178 --> 01:21:32.360]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.724]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:37.724 --> 01:21:45.869]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alextoday for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:21:53.634 --> 01:22:01.021]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?

[01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:06.707]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:06.707 --> 01:22:08.128]  Protection from water main breaks.
[01:22:08.408 --> 01:22:16.011]  E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:21.994]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:22:59.068 --> 01:23:00.889]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:23:00.889 --> 01:23:02.530]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:05.352]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:23:05.352 --> 01:23:07.653]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:23:07.653 --> 01:23:12.156]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:23:12.156 --> 01:23:16.098]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:23:16.098 --> 01:23:19.880]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.941]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:23:27.398 --> 01:23:28.399]  News Flash!
[01:23:28.399 --> 01:23:30.379]  Home invasions are on the rise.
[01:23:30.379 --> 01:23:33.261]  It takes less than 10 seconds to kick in a door.
[01:23:33.261 --> 01:23:36.022]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[01:23:36.022 --> 01:23:37.983]  And what would happen if you're not home?
[01:23:37.983 --> 01:23:41.345]  EZ Armor is the ultimate security solution.
[01:23:41.345 --> 01:23:43.326]  85% of break-ins are through a door.

[01:23:54.191 --> 01:23:56.552]  Your security is our only business.
[01:24:14.037 --> 01:24:21.123]  Keep on fussing and fighting.
[01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:25.446]  All they want to do is push multiculturalism and make us fight with each other.
[01:24:25.446 --> 01:24:29.930]  They say the image of a man and woman loving each other is offensive.
[01:24:31.704 --> 01:24:36.029]  The fact that men and women exist is offensive to anyone who doesn't see themselves as a man or a woman.
[01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:38.331]  And so you've got to give your identity up.
[01:24:38.331 --> 01:24:42.876]  That's not totalitarianism, that's liberalism.
[01:24:42.876 --> 01:24:43.797]  Best part of the song right here.
[01:25:08.155 --> 01:25:09.915]  Let's go to Dave in Florida.
[01:25:09.915 --> 01:25:16.297]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:25:16.297 --> 01:25:17.397]  Welcome!
[01:25:37.008 --> 01:25:39.589]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:25:39.589 --> 01:25:50.711]  Uh, literally right now I am drinking my nascent iodine H2, my DNA4 super male, literally feeling like I did in my high school sports days.
[01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:52.912]  I was a literal beast.
[01:25:52.912 --> 01:25:54.952]  So here's my business, my friend.
[01:25:54.952 --> 01:26:01.114]  You literally exposed almost every plan and the endgame major plan.
[01:26:01.877 --> 01:26:06.782]  But what the people need is a dynamic list of the people behind it.
[01:26:06.782 --> 01:26:13.929]  Dynamic regarding its ability to be updated quickly with information regarding these alleged crimes against humanity.
[01:26:13.929 --> 01:26:19.334]  As everyone, in my belief, is innocent until proven guilty.
[01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:21.571]  Well, it's worth it to prove that guilt.
[01:26:21.571 --> 01:26:22.872]  Evidence is the key.
[01:26:39.282 --> 01:26:48.525]  David Rockefeller, George Soros, they've all admitted they want a planetary regime to cut off the resources and reduce the population 80 to 90 percent.
[01:26:48.525 --> 01:26:50.786]  They all work to take our guns.
[01:26:50.786 --> 01:26:55.267]  They all work to rig different markets and create poverty.
[01:26:55.267 --> 01:27:00.108]  And people like Soros are admitted top Nazi collaborators.
[01:27:00.108 --> 01:27:04.950]  But he gave a bunch of money to the ADL and others out of his hoards he hauled out of Europe.
[01:27:06.325 --> 01:27:11.668]  And so he's allowed to go on 60 Minutes and admit he ran, you know, a roundup of Jews.
[01:27:11.668 --> 01:27:15.790]  And so he gets to run Media Matters, you know, basically calling for me to be arrested.
[01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:19.092]  And, you know, MSNBC calling, you know, saying I'm a terrorist.
[01:27:19.092 --> 01:27:20.533]  Because, I mean, here I am.
[01:27:20.533 --> 01:27:23.894]  My grandfathers both fought the Nazis.
[01:27:23.894 --> 01:27:29.057]  One of them flew a fighter plane, the other B-17s and also Liberators.
[01:27:29.057 --> 01:27:30.498]  Both of them almost died.
[01:27:30.498 --> 01:27:33.600]  So I can sit here and be attacked by a Nazi
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.540]  Who just won't hurry up and die.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:41.841]  So, I mean, I think we can officially say George Soros is a criminal and is a piece of trash.
[01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:49.403]  And, but I don't even, something happened to him, nothing would happen to the New World Order because he's already got all his like his minions under him and all the rest of it.
[01:27:49.403 --> 01:27:50.443]  I've just had enough of it.
[01:27:50.443 --> 01:27:52.924]  And I'm not even looking for trouble from Soros.
[01:27:52.924 --> 01:27:57.665]  It's that he's coming after me, my guns, my family, my everything.
[01:27:57.665 --> 01:27:58.965]  He just won't go away.
[01:28:00.202 --> 01:28:10.571]  I mean, what kind of justice is that, that both my grandfathers, who were great, loving, hard-working men, are dead, and that giant piece of garbage is still crawling around like a 200-pound cockroach?
[01:28:10.571 --> 01:28:12.453]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.194]  No, don't apologize, Alex.
[01:28:14.194 --> 01:28:21.700]  Well, first off, my grandparents did fight for our country as well in World War II, Korea, etc.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:25.063]  George Soros, like you said, is crawling around like a cockroach.
[01:28:25.063 --> 01:28:26.805]  He will, and has, and will.
[01:28:30.146 --> 01:28:37.448]  I mean, a Nazi literally runs MSNBC and Media Matters.
[01:28:37.448 --> 01:28:39.429]  I mean, I just can't handle it.
[01:28:39.429 --> 01:28:40.710]  I just can't handle it.
[01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:41.770]  I can't either, man.
[01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:42.510]  I can't either.
[01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:46.812]  That's why I watch, I'm watching Via Prison Point TV right now on my day off.
[01:28:48.047 --> 01:28:51.948]  I'm a hard-working contributor to society, but you know what?
[01:28:51.948 --> 01:28:54.189]  I'm almost addicted to this stuff.
[01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:55.710]  I can't stop.
[01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:57.470]  It's like watching a car crash in slow motion.
[01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:58.771]  You know why you can't get away from it?
[01:28:58.771 --> 01:28:59.531]  It's reality.
[01:28:59.531 --> 01:29:06.934]  We're supposed to watch Madison Avenue and all the dramas and all the PR and all the mindless Kardashians.
[01:29:06.934 --> 01:29:10.555]  Meanwhile, there's a universe around us, a criminal elite sitting on top of us.
[01:29:11.295 --> 01:29:12.855]  There's so much good and so much bad.
[01:29:12.855 --> 01:29:21.798]  The real world is happening around us, and any man who's got his head halfway screwed on straight would not be able to stop learning how the world works.
[01:29:21.798 --> 01:29:24.939]  See, most guys learn how the sports teams work and are experts on that.
[01:29:24.939 --> 01:29:29.600]  You're meant to use your brain to know how the world works, and it is incredibly interesting.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.000]  I am so obsessed with it, and you're absolutely right.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.761]  The more you learn, the more you want to learn.
[01:29:35.487 --> 01:29:40.852]  Rothkopf wrote a book called Superclass about the 6,000 world elite, and I'd say that's a pretty accurate book.
[01:29:40.852 --> 01:29:42.694]  He's the head of the Kissinger Group.
[01:29:42.694 --> 01:29:48.460]  It's about 6,000 people that are doing this to us, and they're a bunch of trash.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.861]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.861 --> 01:29:52.384]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.384 --> 01:29:55.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.526 --> 01:30:09.170]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:19.095]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:19.095 --> 01:30:22.016]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:22.236 --> 01:30:22.516]  I think?
[01:30:37.213 --> 01:30:38.834]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:30:38.834 --> 01:30:42.216]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:05.892 --> 01:31:10.357]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:10.357 --> 01:31:17.663]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:17.663 --> 01:31:26.752]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:26.952 --> 01:31:32.516]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:32.516 --> 01:31:40.101]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:31:40.101 --> 01:31:42.683]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:42.683 --> 01:31:47.787]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWarp.
[01:31:48.147 --> 01:31:55.449]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:55.449 --> 01:31:59.750]  DNA Force from Infowarslife.
[01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:06.411]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:06.411 --> 01:32:11.552]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:11.552 --> 01:32:13.393]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:20.276]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:20.276 --> 01:32:24.342]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:32:24.342 --> 01:32:26.626]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:38.431 --> 01:32:40.573]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:40.573 --> 01:32:42.354]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:42.354 --> 01:32:45.236]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:45.236 --> 01:32:49.499]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:32:49.499 --> 01:32:51.880]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.582]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:54.582 --> 01:32:56.164]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:56.164 --> 01:32:56.944]  Got it.
[01:32:56.944 --> 01:32:57.745]  Others don't.
[01:33:03.331 --> 01:33:06.013]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:09.015]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:09.015 --> 01:33:11.357]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.862 --> 01:33:28.494]  This magic moment So different and so new It was like any other Until I kissed you And then it happened It took me by surprise
[01:33:50.343 --> 01:33:58.146]  And the new film, Kill the Messenger, based on a book he wrote, basically implies they killed him.
[01:33:58.146 --> 01:34:01.187]  They threatened his kids, you name it, his family.
[01:34:01.187 --> 01:34:06.109]  Rick Ross was the biggest cocaine dealer in West Coast history, maybe in US history.
[01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:08.030]  Tens of millions a day.
[01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:13.592]  He knew that he had people above him that were protecting him, but later he learned it was the CIA.
[01:34:13.592 --> 01:34:18.214]  And there's a fellow in the movie that plays the part of Rick Ross, not the fake rapper that
[01:34:19.249 --> 01:34:20.373]  Pretends he's Rick Ross.
[01:34:20.373 --> 01:34:24.890]  This is the real Rick Ross, who's on with us here in just a moment.
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.463]  And he's agreed sometime next month to spend a few days in Austin.
[01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:34.687]  We're going to fly him here and interview him for a film and also have him on air.
[01:34:34.687 --> 01:34:36.749]  So we're going to get Rick Ross in studio.
[01:34:36.749 --> 01:34:41.933]  I remember interviewing Rick Ross back when he was in the big house.
[01:34:41.933 --> 01:34:42.573]  That's incredible.
[01:34:42.573 --> 01:34:50.840]  It's admitted he was working for the CIA, but he spent a long time in prison and he's here with us now, finally off probation, able to come see us.
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.181]  Before we go to Rick Ross, please don't forget that
[01:34:53.942 --> 01:34:56.903]  You got a lot of challenges out there to the immune system right now.
[01:34:56.903 --> 01:35:01.145]  MRSA, flesh-eating bacteria, all this other garbage.
[01:35:01.145 --> 01:35:05.786]  The best defense is a good immune system to not get it to begin with.
[01:35:05.786 --> 01:35:12.168]  Sunshine, non-GMO, purified water, lots of sleep, having a good time, having a good attitude.
[01:35:12.168 --> 01:35:15.490]  All these things and studies show are good for your overall health.
[01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:22.112]  Then, if you have any deficiencies in the CoQ10 or the PPQ or all these key things that are in DNA Force,
[01:35:23.502 --> 01:35:34.449]  Or if your gut isn't flushed out by things like oxy powder, or you have a deficiency in proper, true nascent iodine, and we have the best source out there from a deep earth crystal source, then you're going to be screwed up.
[01:35:34.449 --> 01:35:36.110]  And you've heard the listeners.
[01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:37.451]  In fact, it's almost become an issue.
[01:35:37.451 --> 01:35:40.113]  They call in so much on other subjects and bring it up.
[01:35:40.113 --> 01:35:47.037]  These are things that we did deep research on that nobody else is putting out that we bring you on Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:47.037 --> 01:35:51.260]  And I think Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine is just as important
[01:35:52.288 --> 01:36:00.973]  As having colloidal silver like Silver Bullet from Infowarslife.com and super male vitality and super female vitality.
[01:36:00.973 --> 01:36:02.994]  Key building blocks of the body.
[01:36:02.994 --> 01:36:04.415]  Things the elite are obsessed with.
[01:36:04.415 --> 01:36:06.196]  Things they don't want you to know about.
[01:36:06.196 --> 01:36:10.638]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:10.638 --> 01:36:16.542]  And all your purchases of books, films, Moulin Labe, Second Amendment t-shirts, you name it.
[01:36:17.369 --> 01:36:23.294]  Help fund this true, cutting-edge, hardcore media operation that transcends left-right.
[01:36:23.294 --> 01:36:25.155]  We're about truth.
[01:36:25.155 --> 01:36:31.340]  The government made narcotics illegal in the 30s when people got wise and got rid of alcohol prohibition.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:37.545]  Alcohol prohibition for a decade in the 20s tripled the size of organized crime, corrupted the police, and tripled alcoholism.
[01:36:37.545 --> 01:36:37.946]  Look it up.
[01:36:39.690 --> 01:36:43.394]  Then you had drug stores that sold cocaine, opium, speed.
[01:36:43.394 --> 01:36:46.278]  Drug use was very low, but you had people that abused it.
[01:36:46.278 --> 01:36:51.403]  They made it all illegal, so select groups could bring it in and charge 20, 30 times.
[01:36:51.403 --> 01:36:59.493]  That's why all the big drug dealers out there, interviewed by Kevin Booth and others, that have aired on Showtime shows, say, we don't want drugs legalized.
[01:37:00.643 --> 01:37:04.586]  Well, Rick Ross does because he understands that it's a weapons system now.
[01:37:04.586 --> 01:37:08.569]  Who would blame somebody if the governments involved make money themselves on it?
[01:37:08.569 --> 01:37:10.470]  But they use it to imprison people.
[01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:13.032]  They use it to control whole populations.
[01:37:13.032 --> 01:37:17.215]  And the reason the story of Gary Webb is so important...
[01:37:18.215 --> 01:37:23.859]  Rick Ross had the courage to tell the truth, even though he was thrown in prison longer for it, and abused for it.
[01:37:23.859 --> 01:37:44.393]  And even though his family was threatened and he was threatened, Gary Webb, who I knew well, we were going to build a website together, he'd been a frequent guest, he had quit the San Jose Mercury News, he was writing another book, proving government money laundering, and the worldwide crime cartel, he told me a few months before, he goes, I'm not coming back until my book comes out, but I gotta hide my stuff, they keep breaking in my house.
[01:37:44.893 --> 01:37:48.137]  Rick Ross talked to him a month before he got his head blown off.
[01:37:48.137 --> 01:37:50.459]  He said guys were breaking in.
[01:37:50.459 --> 01:37:51.060]  Okay?
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.883]  And then the media tried to demonize us when that came out.
[01:37:53.883 --> 01:37:54.063]  Look.
[01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:56.771]  We're telling the truth, folks.
[01:37:56.771 --> 01:38:03.634]  And the good news is, like a phoenix, Gary Webb has risen from the ashes in one of the top films in the country is exposing it.
[01:38:03.634 --> 01:38:06.655]  And I gotta tell you, I didn't think it'd be this accurate.
[01:38:06.655 --> 01:38:10.357]  It could have been a little more hardcore, but it got about as hardcore as I could imagine.
[01:38:10.357 --> 01:38:13.498]  Jeremy Renner produced it and stars in it.
[01:38:13.498 --> 01:38:15.119]  I'm such a big fan of him now.
[01:38:15.119 --> 01:38:18.240]  I liked him in Hurt Locker and in the Bourne movie.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:24.503]  But man, I tell you, if you knew Gary, if you followed the case, it freaked me out to see it.
[01:38:25.123 --> 01:38:29.126]  Because I'm somebody who's in the weird club of being death-threatened myself.
[01:38:29.126 --> 01:38:30.547]  And so is Rick Ross.
[01:38:30.547 --> 01:38:37.512]  So Rick, what was it like for you to see this film of your old friend, Gary Webb, who was there at your trial and the rest of it?
[01:38:37.512 --> 01:38:43.536]  What was it like to go through this saga and ten years after they killed him, to be vindicated?
[01:38:43.536 --> 01:38:44.777]  What is it like for you, my friend?
[01:38:45.370 --> 01:38:51.373]  Well, you know, just the whole thing when it came out that Gary was accurate and that the CIA admitted.
[01:38:51.373 --> 01:38:57.235]  I never thought in my wildest dreams that the CIA would have admitted that they sold drugs.
[01:38:57.235 --> 01:38:58.656]  So with that coming out and then...
[01:38:59.713 --> 01:39:11.976]  Gary had dreams because he said so many people, you know, don't read books and he always wanted a movie to come out and just to see that his dream came true after all these years and that somebody had the courage, you know.
[01:39:11.976 --> 01:39:25.940]  I met Jeremy Renner in New York at one of the screenings and, you know, I had to tell him, man, thanks for having the courage and, you know, just the kahunas to stand up, man, when everybody might go against you.
[01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:27.625]  That's right.
[01:39:27.625 --> 01:39:29.346]  They tried to manipulate the film.
[01:39:29.346 --> 01:39:40.833]  That came out, but two weeks before it was released, the CIA declassified that they indeed did target Webb to destroy him, embarrassing moles like the editor of the LA Times that lied for them.
[01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:41.454]  Incredible.
[01:39:41.454 --> 01:39:43.315]  What all did you talk about with Renner?
[01:39:43.315 --> 01:39:46.357]  And then give us your take when you saw the film.
[01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:51.020]  Well, we talked about the nerves that it took.
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:52.981]  You know, it takes a lot of nerve.
[01:39:52.981 --> 01:39:56.603]  Because basically what Jeremy is doing now is he's being like Gary Webb.
[01:39:57.259 --> 01:40:04.687]  You know, he's being almost like a whistleblower or an activist, you know, for rights.
[01:40:04.687 --> 01:40:05.628]  Oh, yeah, it's dangerous.
[01:40:05.628 --> 01:40:07.110]  Make no mistake.
[01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:13.157]  So for him to make a move like that, you know, I mean, it could cause him his career.
[01:40:13.157 --> 01:40:14.178]  And, you know,
[01:40:15.949 --> 01:40:26.433]  It's just, you know, it's just challenging, you know, because I know because I know how people started to treat me, you know, when, when, when Gary had found all this information and Gary connected me to the story.
[01:40:26.433 --> 01:40:28.514]  I didn't find this story.
[01:40:28.514 --> 01:40:36.858]  I knew absolutely nothing about the CIA, but when it all came out, everybody started accusing me of talking Gary into making all this stuff up.
[01:40:36.858 --> 01:40:37.238]  And I'm like,
[01:40:38.112 --> 01:40:39.173]  I don't know none of this stuff.
[01:40:39.173 --> 01:40:42.634]  I didn't know who the Conscious was.
[01:40:42.634 --> 01:40:44.995]  I didn't know who Nicaragua was.
[01:40:44.995 --> 01:40:46.396]  I've never been to Nicaragua.
[01:40:46.396 --> 01:40:52.739]  I knew the guy I was getting my drugs from was from Nicaragua, but hey, you know, I didn't know it was a country called Nicaragua.
[01:40:52.739 --> 01:40:53.819]  I was illiterate.
[01:40:53.819 --> 01:40:58.401]  How can I make up all these, you know, and Gary was like, well, how can Rick make up these documents?
[01:40:58.401 --> 01:41:05.905]  And it was just like, so I could just imagine what Jeremy went through, you know, and I just have to take his hat off.
[01:41:07.735 --> 01:41:13.880]  Take my hat off to him and hope that his career continues to thrive.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.822]  People gotta get behind people like that.
[01:41:15.822 --> 01:41:18.324]  We can't abandon them when they stick their neck out like this.
[01:41:19.013 --> 01:41:21.013]  Or when you stuck your neck out.
[01:41:21.013 --> 01:41:21.634]  It's amazing.
[01:41:21.634 --> 01:41:26.055]  Now CIA aircraft have crashed repeatedly in Mexico and other areas loaded with cocaine.
[01:41:26.055 --> 01:41:27.435]  That was in Reuters.
[01:41:27.435 --> 01:41:31.216]  They now admit our government grows the opium in Afghanistan and ships it in.
[01:41:31.216 --> 01:41:32.856]  That's even on Fox News.
[01:41:32.856 --> 01:41:41.138]  I mean the vindication of Gary Webb and you and countless other whistleblowers who are exposing government narcotics trafficking
[01:41:42.019 --> 01:41:46.484]  Why do you think the CIA has come out and admitted they bring in the narcotics and laundered the money?
[01:41:46.484 --> 01:41:52.812]  Why do you think they came out and admitted they targeted Gary Webb and declassified that three weeks ago, two weeks before it came out?
[01:41:52.812 --> 01:41:53.734]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:41:53.734 --> 01:41:54.675]  Why do you think that's happening?
[01:41:55.455 --> 01:42:02.458]  Well, you know, Gary's information was so strong that it was going to be worse if they lied.
[01:42:02.458 --> 01:42:07.920]  You know, a lot of times it's better once you get caught in the cookie jar to just admit it.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:24.866]  And then they knew, I guess they knew too, you know, that, uh, cause you know, in my documentary that we've been doing, you know, we have Gary's last interview and Gary says in his interview is that it's really crazy with our new media system is that the CIA has admitted that they sold drugs and nobody knows about it.
[01:42:27.102 --> 01:42:27.942]  Incredible.
[01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:35.064]  And back then, though, they, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, even though he had secret federal documents, even though he went to Nicaragua and talked to the kingpins.
[01:42:35.064 --> 01:42:37.225]  They tried to go back and say he was a liar.
[01:42:37.225 --> 01:42:45.307]  What was it like for you to see an actor playing you, who I think pulled it off pretty well, to see Renner pull off Webb so well?
[01:42:45.307 --> 01:42:51.809]  I almost got a sick feeling watching it, though, because it was like, not a documentary, but it was more real than real.
[01:42:52.469 --> 01:42:54.531]  And then I felt threatened by it.
[01:42:54.531 --> 01:42:58.354]  I don't usually get concerned, but it made me think, man, they've been threatening to kill me.
[01:42:58.354 --> 01:43:00.095]  I know they've been threatening to come after you.
[01:43:00.095 --> 01:43:07.061]  Didn't you feel also almost like some kinship, like we were almost seeing a ghost watching this movie?
[01:43:07.061 --> 01:43:07.782]  Absolutely.
[01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:08.883]  Absolutely.
[01:43:08.883 --> 01:43:10.024]  Definitely.
[01:43:10.024 --> 01:43:11.985]  It felt really, really weird.
[01:43:11.985 --> 01:43:19.131]  And, you know, I was in the theater with his wife and his kids and, you know, we had got to meet and it was just
[01:43:22.092 --> 01:43:23.733]  Really, really eerie feeling, you know.
[01:43:23.733 --> 01:43:33.158]  It was almost like Gary Spirit was there and was thriving and was like, you know, keep it going, you know.
[01:43:33.158 --> 01:43:35.799]  And he gave me the courage to even go harder, you know.
[01:43:35.799 --> 01:43:48.566]  And I hope other news reporters, you know, the part that I liked, you know, when he stood up and he said, you know, I start off writing two stories, one about a dog and one about a horse.
[01:43:50.888 --> 01:44:00.353]  When I found out at the end that it wasn't what it was supposed to be and that journalism is not what I thought it was, and I'm resigning.
[01:44:00.353 --> 01:44:09.017]  And he basically took a shot at all these journalists that are out here and won't report the truth accurately.
[01:44:09.017 --> 01:44:11.799]  Because they're not really journalists, they're masquerading as journalists.
[01:44:12.864 --> 01:44:13.865]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:13.865 --> 01:44:18.168]  They were never really in the arena, like a journalist or like a top drug dealer.
[01:44:18.168 --> 01:44:20.810]  I mean, people would sit there and shake their finger at you and say, oh, listen to him.
[01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:23.451]  He was one of the biggest cocaine dealers ever.
[01:44:23.451 --> 01:44:27.494]  But then they don't even get mad at the CIA that was shipping it in to attack a community.
[01:44:27.494 --> 01:44:29.435]  It just shows the disconnect.
[01:44:29.435 --> 01:44:29.916]  They don't.
[01:44:29.916 --> 01:44:30.937]  They just get mad at me.
[01:44:30.937 --> 01:44:32.197]  Oh, you shouldn't have been out of jail.
[01:44:32.197 --> 01:44:34.079]  You know, people tell me all the time.
[01:44:34.079 --> 01:44:36.000]  I'm like, I did 20 years in prison.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.201]  Well, you shouldn't have never got out.
[01:44:39.875 --> 01:44:44.238]  But then meanwhile, what about the CIA on record bringing it in?
[01:44:44.238 --> 01:44:46.179]  They don't make that connection.
[01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:52.462]  They don't feel like that they should hold their government responsible or the people who are in power responsible.
[01:44:52.462 --> 01:45:01.728]  That'd be like if a Mafia Don ordered somebody to deal drugs and they dealt the drugs and then that person gets caught and goes to prison but the Mafia Don is admittedly behind it but doesn't get in trouble.
[01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:04.076]  That's exactly how it is.
[01:45:04.076 --> 01:45:06.677]  And that's exactly how I feel right now.
[01:45:06.677 --> 01:45:11.038]  You know, we have so many people in jail right now for selling drugs.
[01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:17.480]  You know, no violence, no guns, didn't kill anybody, didn't put a gun in nobody's face, just for selling drugs.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:22.382]  And something like two million people, a million people we have in prison right now.
[01:45:22.382 --> 01:45:28.403]  And you know, like 600,000 of those people are young black men, first time offenders.
[01:45:28.403 --> 01:45:30.884]  And it's really crazy.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.422]  And all they're getting is an education in crime and their whole lives ruined.
[01:45:36.422 --> 01:45:40.083]  And then the government set the whole thing up to control society.
[01:45:40.083 --> 01:45:41.644]  How else can you lock people up?
[01:45:41.644 --> 01:45:44.785]  It's nothing but another form of modern slavery.
[01:45:44.785 --> 01:45:50.407]  Shifting gears back into the film, what part of the film Kill the Messenger touched you the most?
[01:45:50.407 --> 01:45:53.849]  And again, we're talking to Freeway Ricky Ross, the real Rick Ross, here on air.
[01:45:53.849 --> 01:45:54.489]  Honored to have him.
[01:45:54.489 --> 01:45:54.609]  Rick?
[01:45:55.333 --> 01:46:04.940]  It was absolutely the part where Gary, when they gave Gary the award and he pretty much told all of them to go to hell.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:11.866]  When he got the award and he got up and he gave his resign letter and he told them that he was still with it.
[01:46:11.866 --> 01:46:16.549]  I mean I could imagine how that felt when everybody that you thought were your friends all go against you.
[01:46:19.355 --> 01:46:20.937]  I mean, that must have been an awful feeling.
[01:46:20.937 --> 01:46:27.525]  It really, like, I sunk because I know when I was in prison and I got my life sentenced, Kyle, I didn't have any friends.
[01:46:27.525 --> 01:46:32.570]  You know, Gary Webb was one of the few people that, you know, would even sit down and talk to me.
[01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:35.574]  So I felt his pain.
[01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:46.013]  I want to get this on record, because we got attacked right up front trying to shut us up, but I had you on a few days after, I think it was from prison, or was it from prison?
[01:46:46.013 --> 01:46:48.074]  It was from prison.
[01:46:48.074 --> 01:46:51.976]  You did me from prison and you did me the first day or the second day that I got out.
[01:46:51.976 --> 01:47:00.460]  That's right, we were honored to have you, but for me, I remember you talking about stuff he told me that he was getting threats and they were breaking in and he was having to move.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:03.202]  Tell folks what he told you right before he got killed.
[01:47:03.977 --> 01:47:22.813]  He was telling me about people following him around and people on polls around his house and it was really weird going through his paperwork and going back, you know, when he'd go and talk to people, they would go back and talk to the people and then the people wouldn't talk to him anymore.
[01:47:22.813 --> 01:47:30.539]  Well, you know, even in my trial, you know, when Danilo came up and it's a time where he's supposed to talk to my lawyer,
[01:47:31.847 --> 01:47:32.848]  And he wouldn't do it.
[01:47:32.848 --> 01:47:36.509]  He just told him he clammed up and said he didn't have anything to say to him.
[01:47:36.509 --> 01:47:42.012]  So it was like they were going around telling people not to talk to Gary.
[01:47:42.012 --> 01:47:48.175]  Do you have any doubt, I mean in your gut, do you think he really committed suicide or did they kill him?
[01:47:48.175 --> 01:47:51.336]  I mean, my gut feeling is that they killed him.
[01:47:51.336 --> 01:47:57.259]  Because for me I think it's pretty hard to shoot yourself in the head twice.
[01:47:57.259 --> 01:47:57.519]  I mean,
[01:47:58.414 --> 01:47:59.975]  I don't think that it's possible.
[01:47:59.975 --> 01:48:06.800]  You know, you shoot yourself in the head, and then you don't get it done, but you're conscious enough to pick the gun up.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:21.750]  Well, I talked to him right before you did, because I was trying to get him back on the show, and he said, wait until my new book, Proving Everything, comes out, and then I'm ready, but I want you to put up this website with all the documents, so people can go online and not just get the book.
[01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:23.812]  And so I was like, okay.
[01:48:23.812 --> 01:48:24.892]  And he was getting irritated with...
[01:48:28.644 --> 01:48:34.168]  So he doesn't have a new book to vindicate himself coming out and he's calling me to build a website and then he blows his head off.
[01:48:34.168 --> 01:48:35.769]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:48:35.769 --> 01:48:50.539]  Yeah, I mean it was, you know, I was really shocked when Kevin Booth, you know, I was talking to Kevin Booth when it happened and I called Kevin that night and he told me and it just blew my mind that, you know, I just like lost one of my dearest friends.
[01:48:50.539 --> 01:48:54.142]  So it was really mind-blowing.
[01:48:56.232 --> 01:48:59.893]  Did it creep you out too, thinking, man, they could try to kill you as well?
[01:48:59.893 --> 01:49:00.633]  It did.
[01:49:00.633 --> 01:49:01.214]  It did.
[01:49:01.214 --> 01:49:08.296]  I mean, and, and you know, and that was one of the things that I know you, you, you helped me with when, uh, you made it very clear on air.
[01:49:08.296 --> 01:49:17.098]  Uh, you asked me, I remember you, one of the craziest things anybody ever asked me, uh, are you attempting suicide or you, do you feel suicidal?
[01:49:17.098 --> 01:49:20.699]  And I was like, nah, I love life.
[01:49:20.699 --> 01:49:22.560]  I'm glad to be living.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.861]  Um, so yeah, it absolutely did creep me out.
[01:49:27.008 --> 01:49:39.731]  Well, we've had a lot of whistleblowers get killed, DC Madam, you name it, so that's why it's so important to say, I will never commit suicide, I love life, same thing with you and all of us, and Gary was not suicidal.
[01:49:39.731 --> 01:49:54.154]  I think it's important to show what a hero he was, because the film accurately shows, I know you guys got threatened outside the courtroom, he did, that wasn't in the film, but they did threaten his kids in the movie, we know that happened, and Gary didn't back down when they threatened his kids, and folks, that takes a lot of courage.
[01:49:54.676 --> 01:49:57.598]  I know, Gary's a bulldog.
[01:49:57.598 --> 01:50:00.700]  And just for the record, I am not planning on committing suicide.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:03.502]  Matter of fact, Alex, you know, I got a new book out myself.
[01:50:03.502 --> 01:50:07.425]  I just finished my book, Freeway Rick Ross, The Untold Autobiography.
[01:50:07.425 --> 01:50:08.866]  I want to get you here to cover it.
[01:50:08.866 --> 01:50:09.567]  When does it come out?
[01:50:09.567 --> 01:50:11.008]  Because I want to read it and I want to carry it.
[01:50:11.641 --> 01:50:16.926]  It's out now, so we'll get it, and then when I come down there, I'll bring it down.
[01:50:16.926 --> 01:50:18.087]  I'll mail it to you, matter of fact.
[01:50:18.087 --> 01:50:19.329]  I'll mail you a copy of this.
[01:50:19.329 --> 01:50:20.309]  I'm sure it's powerful.
[01:50:20.309 --> 01:50:23.993]  We carry books like that in the bookstore, so I'll have my guy call you right after the show.
[01:50:23.993 --> 01:50:28.778]  I want to carry it, and like you said, you're open some next month, so come down and get in studio with us.
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.101]  Alright, let's do that.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:50.661]  He's not a government guy.
[01:50:50.661 --> 01:50:58.707]  He's somebody that the system basically falsely put in prison because the whole drug war is a fraud to begin with.
[01:50:58.707 --> 01:50:59.508]  Stay with us.

[01:52:13.319 --> 01:52:17.063]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.

[01:52:26.615 --> 01:52:27.616]  Not our iodine.
[01:52:27.616 --> 01:52:31.180]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.961]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:54:09.907 --> 01:54:11.788]  You can find his new book.
[01:54:11.788 --> 01:54:15.109]  I knew it was coming out, but I guess it's already out.
[01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:17.290]  The true story.
[01:54:17.290 --> 01:54:19.731]  Very important for folks to support him and get that book.
[01:54:21.153 --> 01:54:24.074]  And he's also got films in the works and a lot more.
[01:54:24.074 --> 01:54:28.015]  Kevin Booth also made documentaries with him that have aired on Showtime, you name it.
[01:54:28.015 --> 01:54:35.357]  I need to get Kevin Booth back on, who was the guy that helped me interview you in prison, which was pretty amazing.
[01:54:35.357 --> 01:54:40.678]  He's got, of course, Sacred Cow Productions, sacredcow.com, certainly breaking the sacred cows.
[01:54:40.678 --> 01:54:45.800]  Rick, my point is it's hypocritical to put non-violent people, it wasn't like you were Scarface,
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:52.407]  You were more of an executive type guy at a level even above that.
[01:54:52.407 --> 01:54:55.410]  Violence is in the drugs because it's illegal.
[01:54:55.410 --> 01:54:59.234]  All the studies show you decriminalize, it ends it.
[01:54:59.234 --> 01:55:01.357]  So what about all these people in prison?
[01:55:01.357 --> 01:55:04.080]  I know you've been lobbying out there to try to change the laws.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.201]  Tell us what you've been up to, Rick.
[01:55:05.925 --> 01:55:16.933]  Well, I felt that it's crazy to keep guys in prison that didn't hurt anybody, that didn't actually go up and rob him, put a gun in your face, or rape you, or something like that.
[01:55:16.933 --> 01:55:19.615]  But what they do is they let these kind of guys out of jail.
[01:55:19.615 --> 01:55:28.682]  The guys that are raping and child molesters, you know, they go to jail, they get two years, slap on the wrist, because they're making room in prison to keep the drug dealers.
[01:55:28.682 --> 01:55:31.564]  And I think that it's crazy because drug dealers
[01:55:32.586 --> 01:55:38.573]  In general, and the prison industry know it already, they have a study that they did and they said drug dealers are not violent with a majority.
[01:55:38.573 --> 01:55:41.717]  There are some that are violent, but the majority of them are not violent.
[01:55:41.717 --> 01:55:45.622]  They're just people trying to make a living and trying to be productive.
[01:55:46.923 --> 01:55:49.845]  Well, if you make it illegal, people are going to get into it.
[01:55:49.845 --> 01:55:52.127]  And, I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:55:52.127 --> 01:55:56.069]  And then real criminals are going to get involved as well, but they'd be criminals regardless.
[01:55:56.069 --> 01:56:04.195]  I mean, look, if they decriminalize, if they decriminalize as a former top drug kingpin, what would it do to the industry?
[01:56:04.195 --> 01:56:07.858]  It would drive the price down to where most people wouldn't want to.
[01:56:07.858 --> 01:56:10.580]  It would be like, you know, trying to sell cigarettes.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:14.182]  You know, it's so cheap that it's not worth it.
[01:56:14.182 --> 01:56:15.363]  Or even less than that, even.
[01:56:17.118 --> 01:56:25.182]  So, the more that they incarcerate, they go around to a neighborhood and they arrest all the drug dealers from that neighborhood.
[01:56:25.182 --> 01:56:27.943]  Well, as soon as that happens, the price of the drugs go up.
[01:56:27.943 --> 01:56:34.346]  Once the price of the drugs go up, then it looks more attractive to the people in the community to get involved.
[01:56:34.346 --> 01:56:34.806]  Exactly.
[01:56:34.806 --> 01:56:39.908]  That's how you create the huge criminal economy, is having the drugs, to begin with, be illegal.
[01:56:40.862 --> 01:56:41.863]  Exactly.
[01:56:41.863 --> 01:56:48.086]  So you put an artificial price on something that's worth nothing, and then you make it worth $100,000.
[01:56:48.086 --> 01:56:52.328]  And then the big banks launder the money while the youth kill each other.
[01:56:52.328 --> 01:56:53.589]  Yep.
[01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:55.670]  And go to prison.
[01:56:55.670 --> 01:56:57.911]  And work in the factory.
[01:56:57.911 --> 01:57:04.735]  And then all the good old boys go, make them inner-city people work in the prison for 25 cents an hour, taking their job away on the outside.
[01:57:04.735 --> 01:57:06.976]  I mean, this drug war is killing this country, Rick.
[01:57:07.506 --> 01:57:21.821]  Yeah, you're right, because now they take the jobs from the people on the street and they put them inside the prison, and on the street they won't give you that job because it's a $25 hour job, but in prison they'll pay you $0.25 an hour and give you that same job for 30 years.
[01:57:21.821 --> 01:57:27.647]  And they say they like to give guys a lot of time because once they train them, they don't have to retrain anybody for a long time.
[01:57:28.097 --> 01:57:29.698]  That's right, they're good slaves.
[01:57:29.698 --> 01:57:31.139]  That's what it is, folks.
[01:57:31.139 --> 01:57:38.462]  Frederick E. Ross, RickRossBook.com, and folks need to get his new book today.
[01:57:38.462 --> 01:57:44.785]  My only concern is, for people that didn't know Webb, didn't follow it, the film's just powerful.
[01:57:44.785 --> 01:57:47.887]  It only gets, you know, 7 1⁄2 stars, which is very high on IMDb.
[01:57:47.887 --> 01:57:54.270]  Folks, if you knew the inside case like I do, or even more like Rick Ross does, I gotta give it 9 out of 10 stars.
[01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:55.371]  I mean, it's an amazing film.
[01:57:55.371 --> 01:57:56.031]  Do you agree with that, Rick?
[01:57:56.630 --> 01:57:57.511]  I agree, I agree.
[01:57:57.511 --> 01:58:01.533]  When you look at it like this here, none of the major studios would touch it.
[01:58:01.533 --> 01:58:06.977]  You know, it took a guy like Jeremy to get involved and to volunteer himself.
[01:58:06.977 --> 01:58:08.658]  You know, I heard he volunteered his time.
[01:58:08.658 --> 01:58:09.918]  He didn't get paid.
[01:58:09.918 --> 01:58:12.040]  It was a work of love.
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:18.884]  And it took something like this to make it happen because none of the big wigs, you know, the guys that's tied in with the government were going to let it happen.
[01:58:18.884 --> 01:58:23.147]  But it shows they don't run the show that much anymore because it came out.
[01:58:23.147 --> 01:58:23.347]  Yeah.
[01:58:24.256 --> 01:58:27.999]  Rick, I really look forward to talking to you because I admire you, the courage you've got.
[01:58:27.999 --> 01:58:30.080]  You're not a hypocrite, you're the real deal.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:30.921]  So we appreciate you.
[01:58:30.921 --> 01:58:32.302]  I'll say bye to you during the break.
[01:58:32.302 --> 01:58:35.424]  In the next two weeks, we're going to have you sitting right here, my friend, alright?
[01:58:35.424 --> 01:58:36.165]  Alright, thank you.
[01:58:36.165 --> 01:58:36.525]  Thank you.
[01:58:36.525 --> 01:58:37.826]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:58:37.826 --> 01:58:38.627]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.627 --> 01:58:39.807]  I'm going to say bye to Rick Ross.
[01:58:39.807 --> 01:58:41.449]  Freeway Rick Ross.
[01:58:41.449 --> 01:58:42.269]  Freewayrick.com.
[01:58:42.269 --> 01:58:43.190]  This is GCN.
[01:58:43.190 --> 01:58:44.671]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[01:58:49.429 --> 01:58:55.553]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[01:58:55.553 --> 01:58:58.995]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:58:58.995 --> 01:59:00.636]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:59:00.636 --> 01:59:07.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.904]  Is this another Forks Flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security, uh, sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:59:13.044 --> 01:59:16.987]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:16.987 --> 01:59:19.909]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:59:19.909 --> 01:59:28.356]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:28.356 --> 01:59:30.457]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:59:30.457 --> 01:59:31.478]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:31.858 --> 01:59:40.803]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:06.570]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:08.351]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.351 --> 02:00:10.112]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.112 --> 02:00:11.692]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.692 --> 02:00:13.253]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.253 --> 02:00:17.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.434 --> 02:00:22.436]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.436 --> 02:00:25.157]  Our story was on DrugsReport.com yesterday.
[02:00:29.383 --> 02:00:36.686]  We've confirmed the Feds are stockpiling protective gear in expectation of an emergency event at record levels and swearable foods.
[02:00:36.686 --> 02:00:41.107]  We've got a swearable foods company insider coming on to give us intel at the bottom of the next hour.
[02:00:41.107 --> 02:00:43.828]  Joel Gilbert's coming on in just a moment.
[02:00:43.828 --> 02:00:45.089]  Filmmaker.
[02:00:45.089 --> 02:00:47.630]  There's no place like Utopia, but let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:47.630 --> 02:00:48.690]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:51.051]  Mike on Louisiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:00:52.352 --> 02:00:54.333]  Yes, Alex, good day.
[02:00:54.333 --> 02:00:57.374]  Mike, InfoWarriorWagonGuy.
[02:00:57.374 --> 02:01:00.555]  Oh yeah, you're the guy going around with the video wagon.
[02:01:00.555 --> 02:01:01.095]  Good job.
[02:01:01.095 --> 02:01:03.255]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:03.255 --> 02:01:04.576]  I was filming an excerpt.
[02:01:04.576 --> 02:01:07.257]  I was going to... I'm entering the contest.
[02:01:07.257 --> 02:01:08.657]  But I couldn't wait.
[02:01:08.657 --> 02:01:11.318]  I had to YouTube this and get it to you.
[02:01:11.318 --> 02:01:16.359]  I was interviewing a small couple from Denham Springs, Louisiana.
[02:01:16.359 --> 02:01:17.940]  Young couple, excuse me.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:21.041]  From Denham Springs, Louisiana.
[02:01:21.041 --> 02:01:21.481]  Firemen.
[02:01:22.011 --> 02:01:23.692]  Firefighter.
[02:01:23.692 --> 02:01:26.593]  And I asked him if he was getting any training.
[02:01:26.593 --> 02:01:27.313]  I filmed this.
[02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:29.293]  It's on, it's on YouTube.
[02:01:29.293 --> 02:01:43.618]  And he said, um, yes, they just, his department is, or his station just received, uh, five Class A Ebola suits and 300 body bags.
[02:01:43.618 --> 02:01:49.220]  He also mentioned an NSA letter that, uh, mentions lone wolf.
[02:01:50.433 --> 02:01:57.116]  Where they're being directed to take off their details, not show rank, take off their patches, not wear their t-shirts.
[02:01:57.116 --> 02:02:04.319]  As ISIS is going to start targeting anybody that, any civil servants.
[02:02:04.319 --> 02:02:12.182]  And that's right, they use that, they use Al-Qaeda or ISIS as the simulant to get the fire department, everybody into a military mentality.
[02:02:12.182 --> 02:02:14.943]  But really it's preparing for a civil war in the nation.
[02:02:14.943 --> 02:02:19.325]  The internal documents are, it's for the Tea Party and gun owners, and those of course have been publicized.
[02:02:19.325 --> 02:02:19.685]  That's not
[02:02:20.205 --> 02:02:20.445]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:20.445 --> 02:02:21.346]  It's under my name, Michael D. Barry.
[02:02:21.346 --> 02:02:21.806]  D-I, capital B-A-R-I.
[02:02:45.546 --> 02:02:48.527]  The YouTube is, uh, this should scare you.
[02:02:48.527 --> 02:02:56.371]  Uh, I also, uh, have gotten finished today the poster, if you'll allow me to explain what it is.
[02:02:56.371 --> 02:03:09.677]  It's, it's the Ebola Day and it's, uh, Obama or President Ebola getting off saluting with a cop in his hand and you're dropping flyers from a biplane.
[02:03:10.196 --> 02:03:18.500]  For those that don't know, Infowars.com forward slash contest, people have only got a few days left to put up the poster, shoot the video, put it on YouTube to win the $7,500.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:23.382]  And it's just a way to expose the government's doing nothing about Ebola.
[02:03:23.382 --> 02:03:25.643]  So fantastic job, sir.
[02:03:25.643 --> 02:03:31.586]  And again, we will find your YouTube channel.
[02:03:31.586 --> 02:03:33.947]  But the name of it is This Should Scare You.
[02:03:33.947 --> 02:03:37.929]  And then I guess we can click Date Added and click This Week.
[02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:52.796]  On YouTube, to be able to select that out, or there'll be too many videos named that, but give us the name of your channel one more time so we can make sure and identify that.
[02:03:52.796 --> 02:03:54.737]  Spell it out.
[02:03:54.737 --> 02:04:05.643]  Under my name, Michael D. Barry, D, capital D, I, capital B, A, R, I. All right, and we will find that, sir.
[02:04:07.364 --> 02:04:15.648]  I would change the headline, if I was you, to Firefighters Receive Body Bags for Ebola.
[02:04:15.648 --> 02:04:17.529]  And then that way, but there it is.
[02:04:17.529 --> 02:04:20.391]  This should scare you, and it's you doing the interview.
[02:04:20.391 --> 02:04:22.132]  So fabulous job.
[02:04:22.132 --> 02:04:23.432]  I'll give that to my writers.
[02:04:23.432 --> 02:04:24.933]  And look, you're a reporter, bro.
[02:04:24.933 --> 02:04:30.396]  You're not just out spreading the word about Infowars, and we salute you there with your bicycle wagon with posters on it.
[02:04:30.936 --> 02:04:34.198]  Actually, if 1% of Americans did this, we'd wake the whole country up.
[02:04:34.198 --> 02:04:36.399]  You're out there doing interviews, so we salute you.
[02:04:36.399 --> 02:04:41.202]  Great job, Mike, and we'll get to work on this right now.
[02:04:41.202 --> 02:04:42.663]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:42.663 --> 02:04:45.345]  Okay, we're gonna get the guys on that right now.
[02:04:45.345 --> 02:04:46.885]  Very, very interesting.
[02:04:46.885 --> 02:04:52.189]  Firefighter tells press that they've received 300 body bags for Ebola.
[02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.909]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:52.909 --> 02:04:54.050]  I think that's newsworthy.
[02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.830]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:56.011]  We've got our special guest coming up.
[02:04:59.477 --> 02:05:03.139]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.139 --> 02:05:07.420]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:09.201]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.201 --> 02:05:17.064]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.064 --> 02:05:18.205]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.205 --> 02:05:24.848]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:24.848 --> 02:05:27.649]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:29.091 --> 02:05:39.660]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:46.125]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:46.125 --> 02:05:48.467]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:48.467 --> 02:05:51.569]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:05:51.569 --> 02:05:58.435]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:05:59.068 --> 02:06:00.328]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:00.328 --> 02:06:05.310]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:07.971]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:07.971 --> 02:06:15.013]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:15.013 --> 02:06:17.994]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:17.994 --> 02:06:21.035]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:21.035 --> 02:06:22.975]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:25.836]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:25.896 --> 02:06:31.638]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:31.638 --> 02:06:35.140]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:38.221]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:06:38.221 --> 02:06:45.544]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:06:45.544 --> 02:06:48.765]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:06:58.809 --> 02:07:00.130]  The experts are clear.
[02:07:00.130 --> 02:07:07.232]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:07:07.232 --> 02:07:13.515]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:07:13.515 --> 02:07:17.116]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:07:17.236 --> 02:07:21.458]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:07:21.458 --> 02:07:26.760]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:27.780]  Not our iodine.
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:31.602]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:07:31.602 --> 02:07:34.123]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:08:12.885 --> 02:08:19.635]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:19.635 --> 02:08:21.277]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.906 --> 02:08:45.047]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[02:08:45.047 --> 02:08:46.147]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:46.147 --> 02:08:51.368]  Central, we're here live.
[02:08:51.368 --> 02:09:02.470]  Then we return weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News, PrisonPlanet.TV, with the InfoWars Nightly News crew and more, and I'm back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:05.291]  Central as well.
[02:09:05.291 --> 02:09:11.012]  Continuing the expose of reality and fighting those that wish to overthrow common sense,
[02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:23.337]  We are joined by a warrior in promoting the free market and Veritas, Joel Gilbert, who made Dreams of My Real Father, that we still sell, that was a bestseller and in theaters across the country.
[02:09:23.337 --> 02:09:29.720]  Well, his new film had its theater run, and he's authorized us to have it for sale first before anybody else does.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.102]  I guess starting here in just a few days, we have the DVD in.
[02:09:33.102 --> 02:09:36.904]  It is There's No Place Like Utopia, a Joel Gilbert film.
[02:09:36.904 --> 02:09:39.025]  Why did Dorothy follow the yellow brick road?
[02:09:39.465 --> 02:09:46.967]  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert journeys across America to find out what's at the end of the progressive rainbow, utopia, or something far worse.
[02:09:46.967 --> 02:09:58.190]  From the ruins of Detroit to the slums of Chicago's South Side, and from Denver's illegal immigration invasion to Newark's urban removal project, Gilbert pulls back the curtain.
[02:09:58.190 --> 02:10:05.012]  He confronts progressives on his quest and takes us deep into the political fantasy of paradise on earth.
[02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:22.002]  There's no place like Utopia is a humorous and horrifying exploration of progressive, amnesty for illegals, so-called race relations, radical Islam, political correctness, Barack Obama himself, who promises to remake the world as it should be, close quote.
[02:10:22.002 --> 02:10:25.263]  But is Utopia a real destination for America?
[02:10:25.263 --> 02:10:30.665]  Or does the true path to happiness still remain with faith, family, and hard work back home in Kansas?
[02:10:31.704 --> 02:10:41.485]  And it's got Dr. Jerome Courtsey, David Horowitz, a whole bunch of other people, Joel Gilbert's in it, he interviews a lot of the victims of the system, and it's filmed all over.
[02:10:43.035 --> 02:10:51.481]  The country, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Oak Ridge, Washington, D.C., and the land of Oz.
[02:10:51.481 --> 02:11:00.446]  It's 110 minutes long, and we were the majority seller of the DVD last time, his last film, so he said, hey, I'll let you guys sell it first, which I really appreciate.
[02:11:00.446 --> 02:11:07.471]  It's exclusively available right now at InfowarsStore.com, and your purchase supports the whole operation as well.
[02:11:07.471 --> 02:11:11.194]  But just because you know progressivism is really just criminal mental illness,
[02:11:12.074 --> 02:11:16.476]  And a plan to take over society by a bunch of parasites and foreign banks.
[02:11:16.476 --> 02:11:21.799]  Just because you know that doesn't mean young people know it, or your neighbors know it, or your church knows it.
[02:11:21.799 --> 02:11:24.380]  People don't learn this by osmosis, magically.
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:26.782]  You've got to get it into their hands.
[02:11:26.782 --> 02:11:28.923]  You've got to be an info warrior.
[02:11:28.923 --> 02:11:31.504]  You've got to have friends over and have a screening.
[02:11:31.504 --> 02:11:35.006]  You've got to contact Joel Gilbert and get permission to put it on AXS television.
[02:11:35.006 --> 02:11:39.048]  You've got to take action, and this is a powerful tool to do it.
[02:11:39.608 --> 02:11:43.151]  You haven't heard me promote films in a while, because there haven't been that many good ones out there.
[02:11:43.151 --> 02:11:46.714]  This one is excellent, just like Dreams of My Real Father.
[02:11:46.714 --> 02:11:48.875]  So, Joel, thank you for joining us.
[02:11:48.875 --> 02:11:55.100]  Tell us a little bit about the film for folks that don't know, and then I want to shift gears into the Ebola response, the
[02:11:56.241 --> 02:12:01.765]  Move to ban gingerbread, ginger man cookies and they've got to be general neutral.
[02:12:01.765 --> 02:12:11.371]  I mean just the mind control of these control freaks is really getting obvious as Obama gets booed at his own events, people leaving mass.
[02:12:11.371 --> 02:12:14.913]  He now is no longer the Messiah that Jamie Foxx called him.
[02:12:14.913 --> 02:12:16.134]  So what do you expect him to do?
[02:12:17.463 --> 02:12:21.365]  Right, well today is the day, the DVD on InfoWars.
[02:12:21.365 --> 02:12:24.667]  It's going to be exclusively on InfoWars for actually the next six weeks.
[02:12:24.667 --> 02:12:25.788]  Oh wow, thank you!
[02:12:25.788 --> 02:12:30.150]  The official release is December 2nd, so you can only get it through InfoWars store.
[02:12:30.150 --> 02:12:32.732]  So please, everybody check this out.
[02:12:32.732 --> 02:12:45.019]  It's a journey of discovery across America where I go to all these progressive cities where progressives have been in charge for 50, 60 years, and we discover very quickly from talking to people that they've got
[02:12:46.087 --> 02:12:52.892]  Drug culture, 60% unemployment, crime rates, single mothers everywhere.
[02:12:52.892 --> 02:12:56.916]  So they realize, they know by now that no one has been progressing.
[02:12:56.916 --> 02:12:59.478]  They've all been regressing all this time.
[02:12:59.478 --> 02:13:05.422]  So it's amazing when I talk to these folks, especially African American women in Chicago, Detroit.
[02:13:05.422 --> 02:13:07.624]  They're the biggest conservatives in America today.
[02:13:08.524 --> 02:13:10.826]  They don't want any part of their kids smoking marijuana.
[02:13:10.826 --> 02:13:12.949]  They don't want amnesty for illegals.
[02:13:12.949 --> 02:13:16.072]  They don't want any part of this progressive nonsense.
[02:13:16.072 --> 02:13:19.215]  And so I was very inspired once you meet people.
[02:13:19.215 --> 02:13:27.063]  These are people that if you ever talk to people that just came out of East Germany or the Soviet Union and you say to them, hey, how would you like a little socialism?
[02:13:27.063 --> 02:13:28.324]  And they say, are you crazy?
[02:13:29.053 --> 02:13:36.976]  So this is the mood in inner-city America as a result of the progressive destruction for the past 50, 60 years.
[02:13:36.976 --> 02:13:50.522]  And this film, I think, exposes the progressive agenda and the reality and the roots and the history and the mentality of these people that think there's this utopian society they're going to create.
[02:13:50.522 --> 02:13:52.623]  In history, we've seen it again and again.
[02:13:52.623 --> 02:13:57.485]  Mao, Stalin, Hitler was a utopian and a National Socialist.
[02:13:57.485 --> 02:13:58.105]  Pol Pot.
[02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:01.417]  They say, I've got the perfect formula for social change.
[02:14:01.417 --> 02:14:02.518]  Follow me.
[02:14:02.518 --> 02:14:06.538]  And when you get to the end of that yellow brick road, you don't get to paradise.
[02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.359]  You get to hell on earth.
[02:14:08.359 --> 02:14:20.741]  And that's why a hundred million people were murdered by progressives, by utopian progressives in the 20th century, trying to force humanity to fit into their fantasy of utopia.
[02:14:20.741 --> 02:14:23.321]  I hope this film will make an impact and really educate people.
[02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:26.002]  It's a lot of fun and it really hits home.
[02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:34.433]  Well, you're right that most so-called Democrats I talk to know that they've been domesticated.
[02:14:34.433 --> 02:14:38.695]  But at the same time, they're angry at mainline Republicans that are pretty much the same thing.
[02:14:38.695 --> 02:14:44.298]  But now Obama has really shown the true face of progressivism so much.
[02:14:44.298 --> 02:14:48.120]  I think he's been a disaster for them and blown up in their face.
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.961]  But the problem is the bureaucracy is in place.
[02:14:51.961 --> 02:14:53.562]  The industries have been shut down.
[02:14:53.562 --> 02:14:55.043]  The domestication has taken place.
[02:14:55.623 --> 02:15:01.065]  So it's kind of like we now know we're in this hell, but how do we get out of it?
[02:15:01.065 --> 02:15:08.167]  And look, I'm not for the drug war, because it's another evil, but I'm totally against the drug culture that you expose in the film.
[02:15:08.167 --> 02:15:13.268]  And people are like, well, wait a minute, you're against the drug culture, but you're also against the drug war.
[02:15:13.268 --> 02:15:20.170]  Well, the drug war, the way it runs, actually just expands over all the profits, so it creates a drug culture.
[02:15:20.170 --> 02:15:22.411]  But absolutely, the drug culture
[02:15:23.331 --> 02:15:30.258]  And the marijuana culture that I see out there of people that smoke this weaponized weed, they're like zombies.
[02:15:30.258 --> 02:15:31.219]  And I'm a libertarian.
[02:15:31.219 --> 02:15:34.002]  If they want to, you know, be vegetables, that's their issue.
[02:15:34.002 --> 02:15:37.465]  Some adults and people, I guess, use it responsibly, have some medical uses.
[02:15:37.465 --> 02:15:40.027]  But the whole weed crowd doesn't understand.
[02:15:40.027 --> 02:15:46.273]  Just because I'm for decriminalization doesn't mean I'm endorsing it, because I go into these weed havens
[02:15:47.074 --> 02:15:48.695]  And it is like zombies.
[02:15:48.695 --> 02:15:52.657]  I mean, I've known women that were incredibly dynamic, beautiful, talented.
[02:15:52.657 --> 02:15:56.619]  A couple years into marijuana, they look like living dead zombies.
[02:15:56.619 --> 02:15:58.620]  So I've got my issues with it.
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:05.904]  Yeah, well certainly the progressives will use anything, any tool, anything that comes up to exert more control.
[02:16:05.904 --> 02:16:07.224]  Well look at George Soros.
[02:16:07.224 --> 02:16:10.126]  He backs the total weed culture because he wants dumb zombies.
[02:16:10.646 --> 02:16:24.783]  Right, now have you ever been to your high school reunion, let's say when you were 28 years old or 38, you go back 10 years later, 20 years later, everybody that was smoking weed in high school is pretty much still smoking weed and working at a fast food joint.
[02:16:25.462 --> 02:16:30.184]  It definitely causes problems in development, in ambition.
[02:16:30.184 --> 02:16:31.625]  There are many issues with it.
[02:16:31.625 --> 02:16:39.648]  And the more the progressives can promote anything that keeps people from focusing on their radical agenda, the more they'll get behind it.
[02:16:39.648 --> 02:16:42.149]  They want folks stunned and stumbling around.
[02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:43.629]  Exactly.
[02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:47.472]  Now, I think they've gotten away with a lot of stuff the past, you know, six, seven years.
[02:16:47.472 --> 02:16:50.054]  They've got the multiculturalism thing.
[02:16:50.054 --> 02:16:52.375]  They're trying to throw amnesty down our throats.
[02:16:52.375 --> 02:17:01.441]  They want transgender, you know, soldiers and female firefighters, which is fine, but not if you're... What's wrong with commandos and tutus?
[02:17:01.441 --> 02:17:08.286]  I think we should have... If you need to be carried off of a roof, you're a pretty muscular guy if you need these things.
[02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:10.047]  But I think they may have met their match
[02:17:10.687 --> 02:17:12.948]  On Ebola and enterovirus.
[02:17:12.948 --> 02:17:22.432]  Because these things that they're ramming down our throat, bringing these kids in from South America, that are obviously, there's some connection to this tropical disease.
[02:17:22.432 --> 02:17:26.194]  More people have died from enterovirus than Ebola.
[02:17:26.194 --> 02:17:30.836]  And it comes out of South America, and so we can thank our loving Obozo.
[02:17:30.836 --> 02:17:31.316]  Exactly.
[02:17:31.316 --> 02:17:36.318]  Just when school started, all of a sudden these kids are coming down with this enterovirus.
[02:17:36.318 --> 02:17:37.279]  So I think
[02:17:38.287 --> 02:17:48.870]  Americans are not going to rebel from all these other things, but I think when you threaten their children and the safety of their children and their daily health, you can't even get on a plane without looking over your shoulder.
[02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:57.892]  I think this progressive nonsense is finally going to meet a backlash, and hopefully we'll find out in a few weeks if the progressives suffer a big blow.
[02:17:57.892 --> 02:17:58.872]  Well, that's true.
[02:17:58.872 --> 02:18:04.314]  I mean, they say there's like hundreds of kids that have died, kids on breathing machines, tens of thousands sick from this
[02:18:05.319 --> 02:18:13.002]  Jungle virus from South America, and now they say the flood of illegals is even more, and now the jails are releasing the illegals everywhere.
[02:18:13.002 --> 02:18:15.203]  They now bust it at the seams.
[02:18:15.203 --> 02:18:16.304]  It's really true.
[02:18:16.304 --> 02:18:19.485]  Obama is trying to destroy the country, cloward and pivot.
[02:18:19.485 --> 02:18:20.926]  They really are trying to scuttle it.
[02:18:21.986 --> 02:18:27.168]  Progressivism, this entire ideology, is a war against every individual.
[02:18:27.168 --> 02:18:28.348]  It's a war against women.
[02:18:28.348 --> 02:18:30.229]  It's a war against your mind.
[02:18:30.229 --> 02:18:32.129]  It's a war against America.
[02:18:32.129 --> 02:18:45.454]  Because America was based on the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and we have a great American identity which emanated from this, which was individual markets, free speech, limited government.
[02:18:46.094 --> 02:18:51.916]  All of these things they want to destroy because they look at the world differently from normal people.
[02:18:51.916 --> 02:18:56.497]  We look at the rest of the world and we say, America is the best place to live.
[02:18:56.497 --> 02:18:57.377]  We have freedom.
[02:18:57.377 --> 02:18:59.398]  We have individual rights.
[02:18:59.398 --> 02:19:01.658]  We have our own world that we can create.
[02:19:01.658 --> 02:19:04.039]  Whatever we want to be, we can do it in America.
[02:19:04.039 --> 02:19:05.079]  So we love America.
[02:19:05.079 --> 02:19:10.561]  Progressives look at America and compare it to a socialist utopia where everything is perfect.
[02:19:11.201 --> 02:19:13.823]  And they conclude... They compare it to Fantasyland.
[02:19:13.823 --> 02:19:14.523]  To Fantasyland.
[02:19:14.523 --> 02:19:16.184]  So they say we have to destroy America.
[02:19:16.184 --> 02:19:23.990]  We have to tear it down and destroy it and undermine it and wipe it out so we can start to rebuild this perfect society heaven on earth.
[02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:31.315]  We don't have to look far back in history to see that every time some charlatan like Obama, like the Wizard of Oz... Well that's what the zeitgeist movement is.
[02:19:31.315 --> 02:19:34.757]  We're all going to live in giant plastic dome cities and have a robot computer.
[02:19:34.757 --> 02:19:35.397]  Tell us what to do?
[02:19:35.397 --> 02:19:36.118]  That sounds like hell.
[02:19:36.718 --> 02:19:37.719]  Well, it is hell.
[02:19:37.719 --> 02:19:39.180]  It's called a socialist hell.
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:47.806]  And you just look back in history, every time some charlatan said, I've got the perfect formula for social change, you end up in prison.
[02:19:47.806 --> 02:19:51.129]  Prison camp is the end of the socialist experiment.
[02:19:51.129 --> 02:19:52.990]  That's at the end of the rainbows of FEMA camp.
[02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:53.411]  Stay there.
[02:19:53.411 --> 02:19:56.253]  Joel Gilbert, his new film exclusively at InfoWars.com.

[02:20:04.397 --> 02:20:06.598]  Before this happens, homeowners have a choice.
[02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:10.820]  One, do nothing and hope you aren't one of the 1.4 million families attacked each year.
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:12.580]  Or two, refuse to be a victim.
[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:15.862]  And for as low as $59, reinforce your doors with Door Devils.
[02:20:15.862 --> 02:20:21.483]  Door Devils simply attach to existing door frames and have proven to stop the biggest bad guys from kicking in doors.

[02:21:13.369 --> 02:21:17.111]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.

[02:21:21.333 --> 02:21:26.636]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:21:26.636 --> 02:21:27.656]  Not our iodine.
[02:21:27.656 --> 02:21:31.478]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:21:31.478 --> 02:21:33.819]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:22:29.153 --> 02:22:33.656]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:33.656 --> 02:22:39.360]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:42.942]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:24:06.141 --> 02:24:12.467]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:12.467 --> 02:24:15.950]  Joel Gilbert's gonna be on sometime next week for a full hour with us.
[02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:17.612]  The maker of There's No Place Like Utopia.
[02:24:17.612 --> 02:24:18.532]  Because I have the idea...
[02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:25.256]  To actually get some of the most powerful clips of the film and have him walk us through it.
[02:24:25.256 --> 02:24:28.539]  I like when PBS is doing a film review and they talk about it.
[02:24:28.539 --> 02:24:32.303]  It's just so important to give this to everybody this Christmas or this holiday.
[02:24:32.303 --> 02:24:39.370]  It is so important that we promote the ideas of liberty and show what a diseased progressivism is.
[02:24:40.814 --> 02:24:43.096]  It's just like if you feed squirrels at the park.
[02:24:43.096 --> 02:24:45.938]  They become obese, they don't know how to feed themselves anymore.
[02:24:45.938 --> 02:24:48.440]  Or it's like domesticating whales or something.
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:58.047]  It's all done by design and we have the blueprints written by the socialists that this is their plan to wreck America and Europe and they've done it.
[02:24:58.047 --> 02:25:03.391]  But what the film shows, and this is what I found, is the people living under it are rebelling against it.
[02:25:04.318 --> 02:25:06.500]  Joel Gilbert again will be with us a full hour next week.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:08.001]  There's no place like Utopia.
[02:25:08.001 --> 02:25:09.902]  You're not pre-ordering it.
[02:25:09.902 --> 02:25:15.966]  We're shipping now, and I didn't know we had the exclusive, I knew it was for a while, until December 2nd.
[02:25:15.966 --> 02:25:19.088]  So if you want to get it, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:25:22.771 --> 02:25:28.075]  Talk more about the film, because that to me is the really good news, is the people are already rejecting it.
[02:25:28.075 --> 02:25:30.097]  Now they're walking out of his events.
[02:25:30.097 --> 02:25:32.078]  No one in the Democratic Party wants him around.
[02:25:32.078 --> 02:25:37.303]  He's basically canceling fundraisers because even the rich people don't want to hang out with him.
[02:25:37.303 --> 02:25:40.565]  Even though he's a puppet, he's the progressive god.
[02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:44.268]  We must pull down this idol, correct?
[02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:49.512]  I think just like they did in the days of the late 50s, early 60s, the Cold War, the
[02:25:51.693 --> 02:25:57.337]  Idea of Ronald Reagan and others was shed light, illuminate, show what they're really up to.
[02:25:57.337 --> 02:26:07.225]  When they're screaming peace, fairness, we want to help families, you have to shed the light and show that they're pathological liars.
[02:26:07.845 --> 02:26:10.486]  Their agenda is exactly the opposite.
[02:26:10.486 --> 02:26:12.746]  Whatever they say is the opposite.
[02:26:12.746 --> 02:26:21.689]  And when you look at these progressive cities, I visit Newark, Southside Chicago, I run into Michelle Obama's mother, it's a pretty interesting encounter.
[02:26:21.689 --> 02:26:26.230]  I meet up with Jesse Jackson, a lot of just regular folks in Denver.
[02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:28.551]  And they realize they've been had.
[02:26:28.551 --> 02:26:29.971]  They realize they've been had, they know it.
[02:26:30.515 --> 02:26:31.796]  They're a cult of control freaks!
[02:26:52.508 --> 02:26:54.569]  They use all kinds of innuendo.
[02:26:54.569 --> 02:26:56.309]  They become very good at it.
[02:26:56.309 --> 02:27:01.070]  These radicals, these are the 60s radicals who wanted to destroy America.
[02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:03.051]  The SDS, Weather Underground.
[02:27:03.051 --> 02:27:04.091]  These are the mentors.
[02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:10.233]  These are the people that slowly took over the Democrat Party for the last 20, 30 years since the early 80s.
[02:27:10.233 --> 02:27:14.534]  These are the heroes and mentors of the people running the country today.
[02:27:14.534 --> 02:27:19.715]  So that today you see from this film that the Democrat Party is a radical socialist party.
[02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:22.672]  Most well-meaning Democrats are liberals.
[02:27:22.672 --> 02:27:35.784]  Even my poor aunt up in San Francisco, a lifelong Democrat, it's hard for them to realize that their party has been taken over by Marxists out of Chicago who are trying to undermine the country.
[02:27:35.784 --> 02:27:38.626]  And again, look at Frank Marshall Davis, his real dad.
[02:27:38.626 --> 02:27:39.968]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:27:39.968 --> 02:27:42.830]  A hardcore, worldwide communist leader.
[02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:46.414]  And then they admit that his grandfather would leave him for months
[02:27:47.054 --> 02:27:50.856]  In the summers with a commie pornographer.
[02:27:50.856 --> 02:27:53.097]  I mean, these people are freaks!
[02:27:53.097 --> 02:28:01.422]  Yeah, don't forget it was white communists who decided they would use black people and use minorities to join their cause.
[02:28:01.422 --> 02:28:03.183]  They recruited Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:28:03.183 --> 02:28:05.544]  Obama's father was a journalist in Chicago.
[02:28:06.244 --> 02:28:12.670]  And they used him to promote communism and Marxism amongst African-American groups.
[02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:14.792]  The same thing was repeated with Obama.
[02:28:14.792 --> 02:28:29.666]  Bill Ayers, the weather-ground Marxist terrorist, weather underground, his father brought Obama from New York to Chicago to agitate and infiltrate the black church groups who rejected communism because it was atheist and they were religious people.
[02:28:30.166 --> 02:28:40.293]  So communism has a sorted history of using minorities and using people with dark complexions to infiltrate and use those people.
[02:28:40.293 --> 02:28:40.733]  Sure, sure.
[02:28:40.733 --> 02:28:51.320]  But our own government, the Ford Foundation and Carnegie Endowment started it all with liberation theology and the CIA is involved as well on one arm of it doing this as well.
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:52.701]  It's incredible.
[02:28:52.701 --> 02:28:57.664]  It's a, you know, it's a like the hall of shame of all the worst
[02:28:58.565 --> 02:29:04.570]  A group of people and ideologies in America have come together under this progressive ideology and they've
[02:29:05.308 --> 02:29:11.410]  Exerted control over all these cities in America for years, and you can just see the destruction.
[02:29:11.410 --> 02:29:18.952]  If only any Republican would just tell the truth and say, look, progressivism is a path to hell, and here's the evidence.
[02:29:18.952 --> 02:29:23.813]  And then there's American values, prosperity, freedom, free markets.
[02:29:23.813 --> 02:29:30.215]  Let's go in this direction and get rid of this progressive agenda, which is leading us down this yellow brick road to nowhere.
[02:29:31.115 --> 02:29:36.840]  Joel Gilbert, next week, full hour, a special broadcast for radio and TV.
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:40.903]  We'll really review the film, but it's even more powerful than your last.
[02:29:40.903 --> 02:29:41.804]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:29:41.804 --> 02:29:42.164]  Thank you.
[02:29:42.164 --> 02:29:44.926]  For the exclusive on the film, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[02:29:44.926 --> 02:29:46.508]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:46.508 --> 02:29:48.629]  Support independent patriot filmmaking.
[02:29:48.629 --> 02:29:50.011]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.011 --> 02:29:52.533]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.533 --> 02:29:55.215]  Alex Jones and the G-Security Radio Network.
[02:29:59.335 --> 02:30:06.500]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.842]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:08.842 --> 02:30:14.126]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:14.126 --> 02:30:19.290]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:19.290 --> 02:30:22.312]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:22.592 --> 02:30:26.674]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:26.674 --> 02:30:30.996]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:30.996 --> 02:30:41.221]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:41.221 --> 02:30:43.742]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[02:30:44.062 --> 02:30:52.151]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:30:52.151 --> 02:30:56.115]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:03.221]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:03.221 --> 02:31:07.502]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:07.502 --> 02:31:09.282]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:09.282 --> 02:31:14.603]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:31:14.603 --> 02:31:17.144]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:31:17.144 --> 02:31:18.284]  But for how long?
[02:31:18.284 --> 02:31:20.504]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:31:20.504 --> 02:31:24.905]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:24.905 --> 02:31:27.726]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:31:29.185 --> 02:31:39.748]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:31:39.748 --> 02:31:46.189]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:31:46.189 --> 02:31:48.530]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[02:32:09.729 --> 02:32:17.035]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:17.035 --> 02:32:26.123]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:26.323 --> 02:32:31.865]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[02:32:59.438 --> 02:33:02.400]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:07.423]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[02:33:07.423 --> 02:33:13.427]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[02:33:13.427 --> 02:33:16.550]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.591 --> 02:33:26.555]  Amarillo by morning.
[02:33:26.555 --> 02:33:33.359]  Amarillo.
[02:33:33.359 --> 02:33:41.065]  Yeah, that song behind that Texas sky.
[02:33:41.065 --> 02:33:43.447]  Well, I remember probably
[02:33:44.634 --> 02:34:02.749]  Six months ago, talking to the communications director of the storable foods company that we work with, mypatriotsupply.com, because they're one of the biggest, they have some of the best food, the quickest delivery.
[02:34:02.749 --> 02:34:10.576]  They're delivering, shipping out within seven days, all the other competitors within, I think it's two to four weeks, some six weeks.
[02:34:12.149 --> 02:34:17.794]  And this is not an infomercial right now per se, it's really about breaking news.
[02:34:17.794 --> 02:34:22.699]  You know MyPatriotSupply.com is a big sponsor of the transmission.
[02:34:22.699 --> 02:34:30.946]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex to find some of their best specials, but they've got excellent specials across the board at MyPatriotSupply period.
[02:34:30.946 --> 02:34:31.507]  Their number is 866-2290-927.
[02:34:35.029 --> 02:34:39.111]  And that is where I recommend you get your storable foods, because they're super high quality.
[02:34:39.111 --> 02:34:39.611]  I use them.
[02:34:39.611 --> 02:34:46.595]  They're in these plastic containers that you can get at Walmart or wherever that are so nice, the plastic totes.
[02:34:46.595 --> 02:34:51.737]  And so it stores and travels so well, whether it's a 90-day supply or a two-year supply.
[02:34:51.737 --> 02:34:56.180]  I've just doubled down and gotten more storable food from them last week.
[02:34:57.538 --> 02:35:00.421]  And I was thinking, you know, this is insurance policy I can eat.
[02:35:00.421 --> 02:35:01.702]  They support the broadcast.
[02:35:01.702 --> 02:35:08.788]  I should get some more 90-day packs to just be ready to throw in vehicles if Ebola really breaks out.
[02:35:08.788 --> 02:35:11.290]  Now, I don't think Ebola is going to get that bad here.
[02:35:11.290 --> 02:35:11.610]  I hope.
[02:35:11.610 --> 02:35:13.151]  It's getting bad in Africa and places.
[02:35:13.151 --> 02:35:17.175]  But the MRSA, all the other crazy stuff, government not trying to stop it.
[02:35:18.416 --> 02:35:19.956]  All the things happening in the economy.
[02:35:19.956 --> 02:35:22.377]  You would be crazy not to have high-quality, storable food.
[02:35:22.377 --> 02:35:24.858]  So there's the plug for mypatriotsupply.com.
[02:35:24.858 --> 02:35:27.519]  That's the place, in my view, to get your storable food.
[02:35:27.519 --> 02:35:33.040]  Super high-quality, delivered to you quick, non-GMO, great people.
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:39.482]  I mean, their communications director is a popular GCN radio host in his own right.
[02:35:40.842 --> 02:35:44.223]  So that just tells you what patriots they are.
[02:35:44.223 --> 02:35:47.204]  Redhawk, who runs the company, has been a listener for a decade.
[02:35:47.204 --> 02:35:56.667]  Now, Chris Geo founded Truth Frequency Radio, and he's filled with research that includes economics, false flag terror, geopolitics, and occult agendas.
[02:35:56.667 --> 02:36:07.711]  And he joins us here on GCN, GCNlive.com, where he is no stranger to many of you, because he really burrows in and, of course, works for MyPatriotSupply.com,
[02:36:09.062 --> 02:36:17.344]  But they had the Feds approach them, and I talked to other companies that this happened to as well, but they told me don't tell anybody.
[02:36:17.344 --> 02:36:21.985]  Well, I was already working with this company, so I talked to them, and they said, yeah, we're about to go public with an article.
[02:36:21.985 --> 02:36:28.046]  Homeland Security, last year and this year, wants to buy everything they can produce.
[02:36:28.046 --> 02:36:34.647]  And to give you an idea, they're now the most successful company in the country, because they're better customer service, better food, even though they're not that old of a company.
[02:36:34.647 --> 02:36:36.548]  I don't know, four or five years, whatever it is, six years.
[02:36:38.817 --> 02:36:41.539]  All of this is going on.
[02:36:41.539 --> 02:36:48.484]  And then we had an article on DrudgeReport.com yesterday that Paul Watson wrote, so I thought, well, we better get Chris Chio on or Matt Redhawk.
[02:36:49.688 --> 02:36:59.213]  Fed Stockpile Protective Gear and Expectation of Emergency Event NIH Fears Supply of Masked Gloves to be Exhausted.
[02:36:59.213 --> 02:37:08.178]  Well, we have a reporter down in New Orleans who just followed a video that's up on InfoWars.com of a firefighter in uniform, you know, there with his wife, saying, we've been given 300 body bags.
[02:37:10.674 --> 02:37:12.715]  Or he's wearing his firefighter shirt.
[02:37:12.715 --> 02:37:15.316]  So there's massive preparation going on.
[02:37:15.316 --> 02:37:21.998]  And remember the CDC came out and said they've got these multi-person coffins for incineration that are there outside Atlanta.
[02:37:21.998 --> 02:37:23.638]  That was confirmed from five years ago.
[02:37:23.638 --> 02:37:25.359]  That's not a conspiracy theory now.
[02:37:25.359 --> 02:37:26.899]  That was confirmed last week.
[02:37:26.899 --> 02:37:30.681]  I mean bombshell stuff going on.
[02:37:30.681 --> 02:37:32.001]  And it really clicked for me.
[02:37:32.001 --> 02:37:36.983]  I need to talk to probably the most successful storable foods company out there.
[02:37:39.113 --> 02:37:42.876]  MyPatriotsupply.com, Chris Geo.
[02:37:42.876 --> 02:37:46.459]  But let me give that number out again for folks.
[02:37:46.459 --> 02:37:48.081]  866-229-0927.
[02:37:48.081 --> 02:37:52.965]  Whether it's a four-week, or a three-month, or a year, I mean, just incredibly affordable.
[02:37:52.965 --> 02:37:55.527]  That's why they're dominating the market, is the quality.
[02:37:55.527 --> 02:38:01.332]  They have emergency survival food, quality water filtration, survival provisions, heirloom seeds.
[02:38:01.332 --> 02:38:04.175]  You notice they carry a lot of the same seeds we do, because they carry the best.
[02:38:04.861 --> 02:38:11.764]  You can also buy the MyPatriotSupply line with the same discounts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:11.764 --> 02:38:16.586]  But I think they have an even bigger selection at MyPatriotSupply.com, so go there.
[02:38:16.586 --> 02:38:18.347]  Again, Chris Geo, thanks for coming on.
[02:38:18.347 --> 02:38:20.067]  I'm kind of all over the map here.
[02:38:20.067 --> 02:38:22.869]  When we talked to you this morning, I just had this wild hair to get you on.
[02:38:23.891 --> 02:38:25.772]  Because I wanted to get intel more.
[02:38:25.772 --> 02:38:27.213]  I'm not even sure what you're going to tell us.
[02:38:27.213 --> 02:38:28.394]  I mean, you sent me an email.
[02:38:28.394 --> 02:38:29.735]  I haven't had time to read it yet.
[02:38:29.735 --> 02:38:30.936]  I said, I want to get you on at about 11.
[02:38:30.936 --> 02:38:36.599]  And then I guess you said, oh, there is a lot of news, but I'm not sure what angle you're coming at it from.
[02:38:36.599 --> 02:38:42.563]  But if the feds are stocking up on food and want everything you can produce, thank God you're actually selling to the people.
[02:38:42.563 --> 02:38:44.725]  We know with bullets, they're going to manufacturers.
[02:38:45.145 --> 02:38:45.805]  We're good to go.
[02:38:59.983 --> 02:39:06.045]  Oh, well, thanks for having me on, first of all, Alex, and I've got to say we are living in some very, very interesting times right now.
[02:39:06.045 --> 02:39:17.950]  Over the last five days, the mainstream media coverage of this Ebola situation seems to have kind of died down a little bit, but thankfully people like yourself are covering this extensively and bringing the real information out there.
[02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:22.892]  Now, I find this kind of coincidence that the mainstream media coverage is starting to decline,
[02:39:23.332 --> 02:39:24.253]  So he's a cover-up artist?
[02:39:48.484 --> 02:39:51.345]  He is a cover-up artist and a spin doctor, exactly.
[02:39:51.345 --> 02:39:54.246]  So that begs the question, what's really going on here?
[02:39:54.246 --> 02:40:00.309]  And we know from looking at the mainstream media over the last 20 years that they don't ever tell us the truth.
[02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:03.570]  We have to go to sources like Infowars.com to get the real information.
[02:40:03.570 --> 02:40:06.932]  So when the mainstream media says there's five Ebola victims, there's probably 50 or 60.
[02:40:09.895 --> 02:40:17.117]  Well, that's what my gut tells me, is that if two nurses got it, that's because they have a union, they know what it is, they wouldn't shut up.
[02:40:17.117 --> 02:40:19.898]  The nurses have already been complaining there in Dallas.
[02:40:19.898 --> 02:40:28.760]  The workers at the airports have been on strike at JFK, where people are dying, vomiting from West Africa, and before they test them, they say nothing to worry about.
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:30.741]  I think it's clear there's a cover-up, Chris.
[02:40:30.741 --> 02:40:31.981]  How bad is it, is the question.
[02:40:33.399 --> 02:40:43.663]  Your guess is as good as mine, but I do know the facts behind the matter are there's a 21-day incubation period, some say as much as 24 days, where a person can be infected with Ebola.
[02:40:43.663 --> 02:40:45.104]  They're not saying 41.
[02:40:45.104 --> 02:40:47.825]  The CDC now says 41, but sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:47.825 --> 02:40:48.505]  See, exactly.
[02:40:48.505 --> 02:40:50.026]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:40:50.026 --> 02:40:54.427]  So we could have a lot more people who are actually infected and not showing signs walking around.
[02:40:54.427 --> 02:41:01.350]  I mean, me personally, I just flew across the country, and I was looking over my shoulder, watching out for people coughing, and I like to think that I keep my
[02:41:01.690 --> 02:41:18.796]  My ear to the ground, as you said, and my finger on the pulse of situations, but when I even start looking around in somewhat of a panic, I mean, I don't want to live in a complete panic, but in somewhat of a panic or concern, that's a better way to put it, then you've got to take that to the bank because you've got to think about this, too.
[02:41:18.796 --> 02:41:26.799]  When truckers and pilots and other people that are moving products across country, when they're stocking up the Walmarts and the grocery stores and things like that,
[02:41:27.839 --> 02:41:32.681]  If something breaks out, are those people willing to drive into an infected area to deliver food?
[02:41:32.681 --> 02:41:33.402]  So what's going to happen?
[02:41:33.402 --> 02:41:35.823]  Well, we know what happened in four different nations.
[02:41:35.823 --> 02:41:41.786]  It's in five total, but in four, it's caused near collapse in society just from the panic alone.
[02:41:41.786 --> 02:41:44.947]  That's another reason people need to be prepared.
[02:41:44.947 --> 02:41:47.269]  Government prepares and calls it reasonable.
[02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:50.050]  When we prepare, they call it very bad and evil.
[02:41:50.530 --> 02:41:52.173]  Why do they want us so dependent?
[02:41:52.173 --> 02:41:56.201]  When Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, they begged for FEMA to come for weeks.
[02:41:56.201 --> 02:41:57.403]  Wouldn't help them.
[02:41:57.403 --> 02:41:59.247]  Katrina, they came and took the guns.
[02:41:59.247 --> 02:42:02.473]  I mean, why does government want us so unprepared, Chris?
[02:42:03.593 --> 02:42:06.095]  Oh, because they want to come in as the savior, of course.
[02:42:06.095 --> 02:42:07.556]  They want to come out looking.
[02:42:07.556 --> 02:42:08.557]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:42:08.557 --> 02:42:10.839]  It's mommy and daddy government.
[02:42:10.839 --> 02:42:12.880]  That's the way they want us to see them.
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:13.881]  They're the saviors.
[02:42:13.881 --> 02:42:15.462]  We shouldn't be prepared.
[02:42:15.462 --> 02:42:17.084]  We shouldn't be independent.
[02:42:17.084 --> 02:42:17.764]  Nothing like that.
[02:42:17.764 --> 02:42:19.686]  Rely on them a hundred percent.
[02:42:19.686 --> 02:42:22.048]  And I'm not willing to do that personally.
[02:42:22.048 --> 02:42:26.351]  I moved out to the woods in an undisclosed location in the Rocky Mountains.
[02:42:26.351 --> 02:42:28.993]  I've got my storable food here and I feel really good.
[02:42:29.333 --> 02:42:30.273]  I feel prepared.
[02:42:30.273 --> 02:42:32.054]  I feel like I can take care of my family.
[02:42:32.054 --> 02:42:37.656]  And I know that if something breaks out here in Colorado Springs or Denver or any of these surrounding areas, I don't have to go there.
[02:42:37.656 --> 02:42:40.618]  I don't even have to go to the grocery store because I have everything that I need here.
[02:42:40.618 --> 02:42:44.059]  And it's really about being independent.
[02:42:44.059 --> 02:42:52.702]  I mean, that's if you're not prepared, then you're going to definitely fall into whether it's Ebola or some kind of hurricane or some kind of disaster.
[02:42:52.702 --> 02:42:54.203]  You're just setting yourself up for failure.
[02:42:54.363 --> 02:43:02.810]  Well, I see Ebola as a good prep for everybody to realize how unstable things are, and how if there is some deadly smallpox or Ebola, they're going to just leave the flights open.
[02:43:02.810 --> 02:43:05.432]  They're going to let kids go to school whose dad has it.
[02:43:05.432 --> 02:43:07.833]  They're going to just do everything they can to spread it.
[02:43:07.833 --> 02:43:09.955]  Bare minimum, they're trying to let it spread.
[02:43:09.955 --> 02:43:14.719]  A lot of folks like Francis Boyle, who wrote the Biological Weapons Treaty for the U.S.
[02:43:14.719 --> 02:43:18.121]  Dr. Boyle is saying it clearly looks staged.
[02:43:18.121 --> 02:43:21.064]  We've got Wayne Madsen, formerly of the NSA, saying it looks staged.
[02:43:21.644 --> 02:43:24.906]  We have all these other medical experts saying it looks staged.
[02:43:24.906 --> 02:43:28.948]  You have a history of South Africa and the CIA creating weaponized Ebola.
[02:43:28.948 --> 02:43:32.310]  This appears to have mutated and to be somewhat weaponized.
[02:43:32.310 --> 02:43:37.032]  We have a new Army report out on InfoWars.com that's red-linked by Kit Daniels.
[02:43:37.032 --> 02:43:39.093]  I want to put it back as the top story.
[02:43:39.093 --> 02:43:42.395]  It's so bombshell and it's gotten no attention, of course.
[02:43:42.395 --> 02:43:45.017]  Ebola can spread by air in cold weather.
[02:43:45.837 --> 02:43:50.899]  And I want to go over some of that report in a moment, but Chris, this is a big deal.
[02:43:50.899 --> 02:44:03.822]  Now specifically, last year and again this year, you guys even published the letters and some of the info, Homeland Security wanted to buy everything that MyPatriotSupply.com is one of the biggest makers of storable food in the country.
[02:44:03.822 --> 02:44:06.143]  They wanted to buy up everything you had.
[02:44:06.143 --> 02:44:10.945]  We know other suppliers they did these deals with, but they wanted to do that with the government.
[02:44:13.127 --> 02:44:17.450]  And they didn't say just scale up and then give us this scale and produce to others.
[02:44:17.450 --> 02:44:17.871]  No.
[02:44:17.871 --> 02:44:20.512]  Sign a contract to scale up and give us whatever you can make.
[02:44:20.512 --> 02:44:24.455]  So, while they're hoarding food, they act like it's weird if we prep.
[02:44:24.455 --> 02:44:27.598]  Even though I saw articles this week that prepping's gone mainstream.
[02:44:27.598 --> 02:44:30.320]  I think it was the New York Times.
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:34.663]  What's going on that you can tell us about Homeland Security trying to buy up all your food?
[02:44:35.199 --> 02:44:43.967]  Well, I can tell you this for sure, and I hope the CEO doesn't mind me speaking on his behalf, but we're willing to burn down our entire warehouse before selling to the Feds.
[02:44:43.967 --> 02:44:44.968]  That's our position.
[02:44:44.968 --> 02:44:47.171]  We will never sell to the Feds.
[02:44:47.171 --> 02:44:50.774]  But I did speak to them firsthand as the Communications Director.
[02:44:50.774 --> 02:44:57.501]  I recorded it, even put it up on YouTube, because we want to put this information out for everybody, so we actually have the conversation out there.
[02:44:58.021 --> 02:44:59.462]  They're preparing for something big.
[02:44:59.462 --> 02:45:02.703]  He gave me several different scenarios when we spoke.
[02:45:02.703 --> 02:45:12.346]  Everything from an outbreak of some kind of pandemic to a mass hurricane or disaster or something that can take out quote-unquote the tri-level states.
[02:45:12.346 --> 02:45:14.687]  So they're preparing for something big and you're absolutely right.
[02:45:14.687 --> 02:45:24.470]  This Ebola situation, if it does spread the way we believe that it's going to spread, it is a manufactured crisis and that makes it even scarier there because when
[02:45:25.010 --> 02:45:30.297]  The federal government is willing to release something like this here in the United States.
[02:45:30.297 --> 02:45:31.959]  That's when you know you're living under tyranny.
[02:45:31.959 --> 02:45:32.881]  That's when you know... That's right.
[02:45:32.881 --> 02:45:33.922]  It's a litmus test.
[02:45:33.922 --> 02:45:34.483]  Commodity?
[02:45:34.483 --> 02:45:35.364]  Yes.
[02:45:35.364 --> 02:45:35.744]  Exactly.
[02:45:35.744 --> 02:45:39.009]  I mean, either they're the most inept people in history or they're pure evil.
[02:45:39.009 --> 02:45:40.491]  I mean, you just... Either way, you're in trouble.
[02:45:41.581 --> 02:45:43.422]  Yes, yes.
[02:45:43.422 --> 02:45:51.224]  What concerns me though, WHO officials and Doctors Without Borders, they're saying that this thing is mutating as fast as the flu.
[02:45:51.224 --> 02:45:57.726]  I think that if this is a government contrived situation, they're going to release something that they're not going to be able to later control.
[02:45:57.726 --> 02:46:03.368]  And it's going to just get completely out of proportion and even outside of their control.
[02:46:03.368 --> 02:46:09.170]  Well, I told listeners before this happened in the last six months, I said I'm having the most anxiety I've ever had.
[02:46:10.237 --> 02:46:15.581]  And I said it could be biological, nukes are missing, they're funding Al-Qaeda, the border's wide open.
[02:46:15.581 --> 02:46:17.102]  I mean, you just look at what they're doing.
[02:46:17.102 --> 02:46:19.984]  They are destroying this country.
[02:46:19.984 --> 02:46:21.866]  Europe has blocked the flights for two months.
[02:46:22.904 --> 02:46:27.928]  Countries bordering it have blocked it, but they won't block the flights, Chris.
[02:46:27.928 --> 02:46:29.850]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:46:29.850 --> 02:46:31.532]  Look at what they did in Katrina.
[02:46:31.532 --> 02:46:33.233]  They quarantined that entire area.
[02:46:33.233 --> 02:46:36.256]  They were shooting people who were trying to get across that bridge.
[02:46:36.256 --> 02:46:38.858]  They disarmed everybody, first of all.
[02:46:38.858 --> 02:46:47.646]  If this breaks out the way that it could break out, we could essentially be looking at dozens, if not hundreds, of Katrina-type situations isolated all over the country.
[02:46:49.065 --> 02:47:08.457]  And just like one supposed bomber from the Boston bombings, they locked down literally half the city and dragged women out by their hair, pointing machine guns at them that don't even look like the suspects, or one Dorner shooting cops, one crazy cop, and so they're shooting blonde-haired women and Hispanic women that don't even look like Dorner.
[02:47:08.457 --> 02:47:10.999]  It just shows hysteria in government.
[02:47:10.999 --> 02:47:12.700]  Can you imagine how this will blow up?
[02:47:13.513 --> 02:47:27.324]  They've been gearing up for this and I know this sounds very very strange but October 2013 the DHS and the CDC actually did a drill down in the Southern California area where they were combating quote-unquote zombies.
[02:47:27.324 --> 02:47:30.946]  They literally had a thousand people dressed up like zombies.
[02:47:30.946 --> 02:47:33.829]  Now take the zombie aspect out of it for just a second.
[02:47:33.829 --> 02:47:34.649]  What do you have left?
[02:47:34.649 --> 02:47:40.694]  You have people that are infected with some kind of virus that the DHS and the CDC have been gearing up to actually fight.
[02:47:40.874 --> 02:47:41.294]  Absolutely.
[02:47:41.294 --> 02:47:42.314]  They now admit that.
[02:47:42.314 --> 02:47:46.596]  That it's politically incorrect to show Ebola victims being shot, begging for food and water.
[02:47:46.596 --> 02:47:48.796]  That's what people are like after a week.
[02:47:48.796 --> 02:47:49.456]  They turn into what?
[02:47:49.456 --> 02:47:53.297]  Essentially zombies, but they're living undead, just out of their minds, crazy.
[02:47:53.297 --> 02:47:59.139]  And so now we learn all over the world, including Africa, they're trying to kill zombies before this happened.
[02:47:59.139 --> 02:48:02.440]  So that was the cover story, like trying to kill zombies.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.601]  Well, it turns out that's the simulant for diseased people.
[02:48:05.601 --> 02:48:06.021]  It's a fact.
[02:48:06.730 --> 02:48:08.031]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:48:08.031 --> 02:48:11.573]  So we need to start looking at all these situations very, very seriously.
[02:48:11.573 --> 02:48:16.397]  And I think they throw in things like zombies to make people go, oh, that's crazy, zombies.
[02:48:16.397 --> 02:48:18.618]  You're talking about a zombie virus.
[02:48:18.618 --> 02:48:21.620]  And so people just automatically dismiss that kind of information without looking deeper.
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:28.165]  Oh yeah, they had an article last week attacking me saying Jones thinks the government's training to fight zombies when it was in AP Reuters everywhere.
[02:48:28.165 --> 02:48:30.887]  But then when we point out what they're doing, oh, we're lying, Chris.
[02:48:31.647 --> 02:48:33.389]  Right, right, right.
[02:48:33.389 --> 02:48:44.758]  The nurses know, the nurses in Spain, I'm sure you heard about that situation where they just threw their hands up, took their gloves off and said, we're not going to do this anymore because we're going to go and we're going to infect our families if you don't provide the proper gear for us.
[02:48:44.758 --> 02:48:48.341]  We need hazmat suits, we need HEPA filters, we need all of this.
[02:48:48.341 --> 02:48:58.729]  Meanwhile, people here, the nurse, I don't remember the name off the top of my head, but the two nurses that were infected here, they were supposedly wearing all of this, face shields, protective footwear, hazmat suits.
[02:48:58.769 --> 02:49:02.899]  Turns out that one of them already had it and said, oh, I've been treating an Ebola patient.
[02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:04.502]  I feel sick.
[02:49:04.502 --> 02:49:05.865]  Should I fly with a fever?
[02:49:05.865 --> 02:49:07.148]  They said, oh, sure, honey baby.
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:09.200]  Exactly.
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:10.321]  Exactly.
[02:49:10.321 --> 02:49:16.884]  So, like I said, we're living in very, very dangerous times right now, and the only thing we can do is rely on us.
[02:49:16.884 --> 02:49:22.967]  I mean, when has there ever been a case in our entire history when it wasn't the people that we relied on?
[02:49:22.967 --> 02:49:26.309]  When we could rely on the government and look at them and say, oh, they're going to take care of us.
[02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:28.750]  Did they take care of the Japanese during World War II?
[02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:29.430]  Absolutely not.
[02:49:29.430 --> 02:49:31.031]  Did they take care of the Katrina victims?
[02:49:31.031 --> 02:49:31.571]  No.
[02:49:31.571 --> 02:49:34.133]  It's fail after fail after fail on the government's part.
[02:49:34.713 --> 02:49:36.075]  Can't or won't protect us.
[02:49:36.075 --> 02:49:37.457]  We have to protect ourselves.
[02:49:37.457 --> 02:49:41.341]  And you guys are great sponsors helping us fund to get the First Amendment out.
[02:49:41.341 --> 02:49:47.429]  I want to encourage folks to go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex or just mypatriotsupply.com period 866-229-0927
[02:49:51.354 --> 02:50:07.531]  Bottom line, there is no silver bullet for any of this, but the proper supplements for overall strengthening our body's natural defenses, having the storable food, having the candles, having the firearms, having the will to protect your family, having even if it's
[02:50:08.752 --> 02:50:16.958]  I mean, I had a guy in business that didn't pay me back money years ago, and he just gave me five acres in the middle of the hill country that I never even go to, but I pay the property taxes on it, and it's on the Perdenales.
[02:50:16.958 --> 02:50:17.519]  I got that.
[02:50:17.519 --> 02:50:21.262]  I got a place out that I live at out in the country.
[02:50:21.262 --> 02:50:24.084]  So I've got a family ranch in East Texas.
[02:50:24.084 --> 02:50:25.245]  But even if people don't have that,
[02:50:25.885 --> 02:50:32.008]  Have a bug out plan or have a plan to be able to stay in your house and shelter in place if something like this gets out.
[02:50:32.008 --> 02:50:35.070]  But you've got to have the storable food that you know you can depend on.
[02:50:35.070 --> 02:50:37.751]  And it's a fraction of the cost by taking the middleman out.
[02:50:37.751 --> 02:50:42.214]  What you'll get at mypatriotsupply.com or you can also find the toll free number 866-229-0927.

[02:50:45.756 --> 02:50:47.677]  They can ship it out the door in less than a week.
[02:50:50.018 --> 02:50:51.260]  No one else can do that.
[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:55.868]  And that's why they set up this company years ago, is so they were sick of food companies taking months to ship it.
[02:50:55.868 --> 02:50:56.870]  You can get it right away.
[02:50:59.617 --> 02:51:02.698]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[02:51:02.698 --> 02:51:08.561]  Civil unrest, riots, looting, it's happening now, right here in the United States, and your rights are at risk.
[02:51:08.561 --> 02:51:10.542]  If passed, H.R.
[02:51:10.542 --> 02:51:12.923]  5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[02:51:12.923 --> 02:51:15.104]  KD Armor is standing up for you.

[02:52:27.072 --> 02:52:28.072]  Not our iodine.
[02:52:28.072 --> 02:52:31.895]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.

[02:54:42.279 --> 02:54:44.501]  You look like an angel.
[02:54:44.501 --> 02:54:46.523]  Talk like an angel.
[02:54:46.523 --> 02:54:50.506]  Walk like an angel.
[02:54:50.506 --> 02:54:52.348]  Talk like an angel.
[02:54:52.348 --> 02:54:56.411]  But I got wise.
[02:54:56.411 --> 02:54:59.214]  You're the devil in disguise.
[02:54:59.214 --> 02:55:01.616]  Oh yes you are.
[02:55:01.616 --> 02:55:08.422]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the man who could even interrupt Elvis, Alex Jones.
[02:55:08.422 --> 02:55:09.523]  Literally obnoxious.
[02:55:12.302 --> 02:55:18.888]  I had callers holding forever because what happens I get them on earlier than I get guests on.
[02:55:18.888 --> 02:55:26.615]  I'll do a little bit overdrive to go to you Kevin and Donna and Dylan and Phillip.
[02:55:26.615 --> 02:55:27.476]  I'll try to get to everybody.
[02:55:27.476 --> 02:55:29.398]  Finishing up with Chris Gio.
[02:55:29.398 --> 02:55:32.721]  Chris we'll have to keep track of this with you as we go along but
[02:55:34.631 --> 02:55:43.596]  I'm just surprised that so many other food companies we talked to just basically quit selling because all they do is sell to Homeland Security, and they're getting body bags ready everywhere and martial law ready.
[02:55:43.596 --> 02:55:51.300]  I mean, maybe it's just a big boondoggle in the federal government, but I've never seen such a gearing up as we've said in the last year here.
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:58.144]  And I remember you and that recording that you guys released boldly with Homeland Security that they talked about a pandemic.
[02:55:59.662 --> 02:56:03.885]  I'm just really worried about hysteria with the flu being misidentified as Ebola.
[02:56:03.885 --> 02:56:08.929]  Any other points you think should be added as the communications director for mypatriotsupply.com?
[02:56:09.741 --> 02:56:21.785]  Well, I think it goes the opposite as well, that some people who are diagnosed with, say, flu could actually have Ebola symptoms or something like that, but they're saying it's flu or something else just to try to keep the numbers down.
[02:56:21.785 --> 02:56:23.105]  That is also a possibility.
[02:56:23.105 --> 02:56:28.167]  Now, I don't have anything to back that up a hundred percent, but we have to speculate in these regards as well.
[02:56:28.167 --> 02:56:32.549]  We have to think from every perspective and we have to think like a chess player, ultimately.
[02:56:32.549 --> 02:56:33.869]  What's the next move they're going to make?
[02:56:33.869 --> 02:56:36.230]  But also, what's the next five moves they're going to make?
[02:56:37.130 --> 02:56:43.075]  I would just say to the audience that we have to make sure to separate ourselves from fear, because fear is the mind killer.
[02:56:43.075 --> 02:56:48.619]  And when they put you in that fear-like state, then you're acting erratically, and you're acting based on emotion.
[02:56:48.619 --> 02:56:49.059]  Exactly!
[02:56:49.059 --> 02:56:55.644]  They act like we're scared when we own guns, and we have food, and we have supplements, and we have water filtration.
[02:56:55.644 --> 02:56:59.046]  Well, I mean, old-timers all had that, and canned food, and had guns, and a
[02:57:00.207 --> 02:57:03.148]  I mean, ants save food.
[02:57:03.148 --> 02:57:04.469]  Honeybees save food.
[02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:08.911]  I mean, any species that's smart and wants to survive does that.
[02:57:08.911 --> 02:57:12.952]  They're trying to run that out of us, saying we're weird and we're living in fear.
[02:57:12.952 --> 02:57:13.893]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:57:13.893 --> 02:57:16.474]  People always say, you're really paranoid, must be afraid of everything.
[02:57:17.094 --> 02:57:19.676]  No, I know there's corruption, so I'm fighting it.
[02:57:19.676 --> 02:57:22.259]  If I was paranoid, I would shut up and go along with it.
[02:57:22.259 --> 02:57:23.400]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:24.721]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:57:24.721 --> 02:57:36.210]  Now, I know me personally, having a couple of years of storable food, having enough ammunition and everything else that I need, now instead of worrying about where am I going to get food from, I can worry about what am I going to do, what's going to be my next move.
[02:57:36.210 --> 02:57:37.752]  I have my food, I can put it in my car,
[02:57:38.652 --> 02:57:40.312]  These three-month supplies are great.
[02:57:40.312 --> 02:57:41.993]  I mean, you can really carry them.
[02:57:41.993 --> 02:57:48.934]  I can carry two in one hand and just throw them right in the back of any small car and I can get anywhere that I need to go and I know that I'm taken care of.
[02:57:48.934 --> 02:57:55.115]  As a matter of fact, I keep a couple of weeks in my car as an emergency in case we get snowed in somewhere.
[02:57:55.115 --> 02:57:57.355]  Sure, and you don't have to be an expert to do this.
[02:57:57.355 --> 02:57:59.316]  Exactly, and you don't have to be experts to do this.
[02:57:59.316 --> 02:58:03.956]  They've got the most inexpensive, highest quality little cook stoves, everything you need, just water.
[02:58:03.956 --> 02:58:07.157]  It's high quality and they support the broadcast and that's
[02:58:07.637 --> 02:58:09.238]  Not really why they're here today, overall.
[02:58:09.238 --> 02:58:11.440]  I wanted to get an update, but they are a great sponsor.
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:16.864]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex, or just MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:58:16.864 --> 02:58:20.326]  I think folks are crazy if they don't get high-quality, affordable food and insurance you can eat.
[02:58:20.326 --> 02:58:22.188]  Chris Gio, thank you so much for the time today.
[02:58:22.793 --> 02:58:24.013]  Thank you for all your inspiration, Alex.

[02:58:31.875 --> 02:58:33.435]  Don't let us know if anything else breaks.
[02:58:33.435 --> 02:58:34.476]  OK, I'm going to go on a break.
[02:58:34.476 --> 02:58:35.896]  The main radio show's kind of over.
[02:58:35.896 --> 02:58:38.216]  Come back in overdrive and take a few phone calls.

[03:00:23.424 --> 03:00:25.364]  What's on your mind, Kevin?
[03:00:25.364 --> 03:00:26.285]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:26.285 --> 03:00:27.906]  I had called in a few months ago.
[03:00:27.906 --> 03:00:33.708]  I'm the one that blinded and told you that I get $700 a month, and I finally kicked the weed thing.
[03:00:34.378 --> 03:01:01.095]  And, um, went to a federal facility to get help for my blindness, and one of the things that I noticed, um, down there, that everybody has a disability of some sort, but I noticed that, um, everyone down there was suffering from diabetes, and one of the things that I, um, I stayed there in the dorm room, and one of the things that I noticed for the meals and everything is that every meal, everyone got three cups of soda, which kind of blew my mind.
[03:01:01.095 --> 03:01:01.856]  Here, you know,
[03:01:02.321 --> 03:01:13.966]  The federal place is trying to like help you, but yet they're, you know, they're forcing... Hospitals have the worst nutrition in major studies in the world here in the United States, but the worst period, not just for hospitals.
[03:01:13.966 --> 03:01:18.728]  And then government hospitals and the VA have the worst of that nutrition.
[03:01:18.728 --> 03:01:24.150]  They will, listen, diet cokes we knew 30 years ago cause diabetes, eat your pancreas and make you obese.
[03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:28.551]  Major studies came out this year and even CBS News had to admit it.
[03:01:28.551 --> 03:01:38.173]  So, yes, and then vaccines cause pancreatitis in many cases, one of the most common autoimmune responses other than blood on the brain and gut problems.
[03:01:38.173 --> 03:01:40.494]  Most people who have Crohn's, it's from the measles.
[03:01:40.494 --> 03:01:43.654]  Mumps and rubella shot, major studies on that.
[03:01:43.654 --> 03:01:49.776]  And so, yeah, people that are getting shots five, six times a year, you can bet your bottom dollar their pancreas is deader than a hammer.
[03:01:50.496 --> 03:01:51.576]  And that's just how it works.
[03:01:51.576 --> 03:01:52.196]  God bless you.
[03:01:52.196 --> 03:01:53.317]  Good to hear from you.

[03:02:00.358 --> 03:02:01.298]  I'm doing all of them.
[03:02:01.298 --> 03:02:03.918]  And our family up here is doing wonderful.
[03:02:03.918 --> 03:02:07.239]  And we're going to keep our immune system the best we can.
[03:02:07.239 --> 03:02:15.140]  I wanted to bring to your attention that Monica Lewinsky is going around the circuit saying that Drudge ruined her life.
[03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:15.640]  I saw that.
[03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:16.160]  Pure bull.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:18.941]  I thought it was Bill Clinton doing stuff to her and her lying.
[03:02:19.913 --> 03:02:21.253]  That's exactly right.
[03:02:21.253 --> 03:02:34.558]  I mean, yeah, she's going around, and then she's saying that Drudge is a bully, you know, now they're trying to do internet bully, you know, cyber bullies, and they're going to try to take down, put more control on the internet for this.
[03:02:35.171 --> 03:02:47.182]  That's it, and she's the new poster girl that if something hurts your feelings, she's in there having sex with a married man in the White House, she was connected to Israeli intelligence, a bunch of other stuff, and then Drudge puts it out, it breaks.
[03:02:47.182 --> 03:02:48.443]  How is that his fault?
[03:02:48.443 --> 03:02:52.206]  That's what journalists are supposed to do when it's the President.
[03:02:52.206 --> 03:02:54.568]  And then people can decide what they want to do about it.
[03:02:54.568 --> 03:02:56.991]  And it's not like it was one woman.
[03:02:56.991 --> 03:03:00.594]  Clinton was like, settling cases of raping women.
[03:03:01.716 --> 03:03:09.158]  And, you know, in the Lincoln bedroom with all these movie stars, and the issue is blackmail of the President.
[03:03:09.158 --> 03:03:13.119]  I mean, I don't get in people's issues of infidelity and stuff like that.
[03:03:13.119 --> 03:03:14.060]  It's a free country.
[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:15.900]  It doesn't mean I endorse it either.
[03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:24.583]  It's just that the issue is, the word is, he was being blackmailed with that information, and so Drudge is a hero, and a bellwether of the new media.
[03:03:24.583 --> 03:03:26.083]  And that's why they hate him, so good point.
[03:03:27.168 --> 03:03:34.053]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring that up because they are really chomping at the bit to go after the alternative media.
[03:03:34.053 --> 03:03:36.995]  Your crew is doing the best job ever.
[03:03:36.995 --> 03:03:37.635]  They are.
[03:03:37.635 --> 03:03:41.338]  I'm seeing InfoWars stickers all the way through New Hampshire.
[03:03:41.338 --> 03:03:42.638]  So keep up the good work.
[03:03:42.638 --> 03:03:44.079]  God bless your crew.
[03:03:44.079 --> 03:03:44.760]  God bless you.
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:45.781]  Please don't thank me, ma'am.
[03:03:45.781 --> 03:03:47.182]  I want to thank you.
[03:03:47.182 --> 03:03:48.743]  You are just as important as I am.
[03:03:48.743 --> 03:03:50.043]  You're a journalist, too.
[03:03:50.043 --> 03:03:54.727]  Like the fellow that shot the video of the firefighters saying they got 300 body bags in their town for Ebola.
[03:03:55.615 --> 03:04:02.944]  I mean, you are just as important as I am, just as important as Matt Drudge is, just as important as the New York Times is, as Matt has always said.
[03:04:02.944 --> 03:04:10.053]  It's the things Drudge says, stuff that makes so much sense.
[03:04:10.053 --> 03:04:10.874]  I mean, it's true.
[03:04:12.287 --> 03:04:15.889]  In fact, quite frankly, you're even more important than I am of the New York Times.
[03:04:15.889 --> 03:04:21.793]  Because you're just citizen journalists giving your view, videotaping what happens, asking real questions.
[03:04:21.793 --> 03:04:26.557]  You see national news all the time from some question at a meet-and-greet with a person.
[03:04:26.557 --> 03:04:31.480]  Because media, horror media, establishment, prostitute media, will not ask real questions.
[03:04:32.671 --> 03:04:33.772]  Okay.
[03:04:33.772 --> 03:04:36.033]  And then you could even claim, you know, Infowars has an agenda.
[03:04:36.033 --> 03:04:37.614]  It is libertarian patriot ideals.
[03:04:37.614 --> 03:04:38.274]  We tell the truth.
[03:04:38.274 --> 03:04:41.576]  But you can still say there's an agenda because, you know, we've got to pay the bills or whatever.
[03:04:41.576 --> 03:04:44.218]  The agenda is to try to have advertising, whatever.
[03:04:44.218 --> 03:04:45.118]  It just comes with the territory.
[03:04:45.118 --> 03:04:45.719]  It's not bad.
[03:04:45.719 --> 03:04:46.479]  It's just true.
[03:04:46.479 --> 03:04:53.423]  But a pure person on the street with a blog or videotaping something they saw on YouTube, that is veritas right there.
[03:04:53.423 --> 03:04:56.085]  We can all look at it and come back with our own view.
[03:04:56.085 --> 03:04:57.005]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:57.005 --> 03:04:57.745]  God bless you all.
[03:04:57.745 --> 03:04:58.326]  Sorry to the other callers.
