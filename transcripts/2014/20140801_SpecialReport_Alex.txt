[00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:02.243]  Thanks for watching!
[00:00:06.062 --> 00:00:11.365]  One of the ways law enforcement agencies apply for tax dollars is by touting large arrest numbers.
[00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:20.711]  Oftentimes stings are used but not always in the most ethical ways, such as when a California cop posed as a high school student to get teens to sell him dope.
[00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:29.316]  One of the teens, who was autistic, had no drug issues until he procured some marijuana for the undercover deputy, who he considered to be his only friend.
[00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:34.299]  The deputy's actions led to the arrest of over 20 students, many facing felony charges.
[00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:40.654]  And one thing that they consistently have trouble answering is to be able to properly define entrapment.
[00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:42.679]  That always gives them a lot of trouble.
[00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:46.078]  Yes, what exactly is entrapment?
[00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:56.267]  I'm all about busting dirty cops and agents, but when thousands of dollars are spent fueling a vice-filled investigation that pulls up nothing, policies need to be changed.
[00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:00.711]  Like when a border patrol agent went to Las Vegas to work a security detail.
[00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:05.275]  The security was for an illegal drug deal, but the agent claims he didn't know that.
[00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:13.397]  Whether or not the agent was double dealing, it was an elaborate sting set up by the Feds that was dismissed because of questionable practices.
[00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:16.657]  And stories like these are all too common.
[00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:22.059]  People with no criminal intent pressured into committing illegal acts by those who wish to arrest them.
[00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:28.240]  Or in the name of security, Feds burn up grant money and ethics in an attempt to catch small fish.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.145]  I'll leave you with a few more examples of how some law enforcement agencies create the very criminals they fight.
[00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.068]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:45.092]  It will tell you that it, the FBI, has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:52.377]  What it will not tell you is that there have been 20 foiled plots, and of them, three were interrupted by members of the public.
[00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:57.061]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:01.214]  The facts are in.
[00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:02.514]  The studies are legion.
[00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:10.159]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.662]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
