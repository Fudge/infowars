[00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.853]  I don't know if epidemic is the right word, but there have been many cases of police shooting dogs.
[00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:20.598]  I do understand that some dogs are trained to attack strangers, but can't police use pepper spray or some type of other supposedly non-lethal defense?
[00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:26.361]  Such as when a Michigan officer shot a 10-month-old puppy in its own fenced-in yard.
[00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:33.126]  The officer was responding to a call when he rushed past the beware of dog sign and killed the allegedly aggressive dog.
[00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:38.910]  Earlier this year, an Oklahoma officer killed a dog and laughed about it, reports claim.
[00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.394]  The dog's owner claims the officer said, quote, Did you see her collar fly off when I shot her?
[00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:45.795]  That was awesome!
[00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:56.006]  And honestly, there are more examples than we have time to go through.
[00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.647]  So here's a brief sample.
[00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:01.930]  After the shooting, Paxton recorded a short video on his cell phone.
[00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.512]  He claims the officer shrugged as if he didn't care.
[00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.594]  You catch the officer shrugging his shoulders.
[00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.497]  We all do certain things when we're dealing with stress.
[00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:31.709]  But do know the quick draw McGraw tactics of some of these officers sometimes do backfire.
[00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.975]  Scary moments for a Riverside County Sheriff's deputy after he came face to face with a pit bull and then accidentally shot himself.
[00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.397]  A large pit bull breed dog attacked the deputy.
[00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:43.598]  That's mean.
[00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:13.700]  Yeah.
[00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.872]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:24.434]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:34.460]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
