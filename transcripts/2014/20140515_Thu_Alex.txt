[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.369]  Coast to coast.
[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:01.250]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.271]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:35.821]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.302]  You want answers?
[00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:38.964]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.269]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.874]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:08.830]  Well, my friends, it's another insanely full Newsday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.772]  On this Thursday, the 15th day of May 2014, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:17.952]  We'll be here for the next three hours.
[00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:20.793]  Where to start?
[00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:22.054]  Where to begin?
[00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:28.276]  The establishment is going into total overdrive in Divide and Conquer right now.
[00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.456]  Why New York Times Jill fired after asking for equal pay, she claims.
[00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:44.507]  New York Times publisher said to always have clashed with the woman, Abramson.
[00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:47.610]  Polarizing and mercurial.
[00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:59.627]  I mean, as if the New York Times, the ultra-socialist, anti-American, globalist operation is getting rid of a woman because she asked for more money that was a senior person.
[00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:05.912]  When the magazine is, the newspaper, is failing on its face.
[00:02:07.853 --> 00:02:09.735]  In debt, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:17.201]  Didn't Carlos Slim, the shady billionaire, Lebanese-Mexican, I mean, didn't he buy it?
[00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:21.965]  The guy that makes the money off the Obama phones?
[00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:41.919]  You've got to love this culture where you've got the head of the New York Times fired and then they complain about it saying that it's being done because she's a woman.
[00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.942]  I mean this is the total and complete culture
[00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:50.678]  That we've entered into.
[00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:56.576]  And then, oh, LeBron James is going to lead a boycott of the Clippers if the team isn't sold.
[00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:00.597]  All of this is distractions.
[00:03:00.677 --> 00:03:06.541]  It's teaching us the whole world is based on fighting with each other over what one individual says or doesn't say.
[00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:10.624]  Not over the MERS virus now in the US.
[00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:13.586]  Not over world government being established.
[00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:19.531]  Not over trillions of dollars a month being transferred to private central banks from taxpayers worldwide.
[00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:24.014]  Not on the war against taxpayers and individuals.
[00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:35.154]  And then there's a video out we're going to be getting to where it shows kids react to gay marriage videos where they're teaching little kids about, you know, how to be gay, basically.
[00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:47.119]  This is what you learn in school now, is how to be politically freaked out and politically only identifying with a group, not being an individual.
[00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.621]  It's just mind-blowing, mind-boggling,
[00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:54.025]  to see these type of things going on.
[00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:59.210]  And then we've got this article, USDA to purchase sub-machine guns.
[00:04:01.873 --> 00:04:04.936]  Some question where semi-automatic weapons will be heading.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:31.321]  The USDA, ladies and gentlemen, and the Food and Drug Administration, I have talked to the supplement companies where in the past you would get bureaucrats that would visit you, they now show up with Navy officers, I'm not joking, leading groups of men with sidearms and SWAT team outfits to intimidate everyone when they just show up at vitamin C factories.
[00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:36.072]  Because everybody wants to wear a snappy uniform.
[00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:38.674]  Everybody wants to have guns and shove the slaves around.
[00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:40.796]  It's all about intimidation.
[00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:43.097]  It's all about seizing control of the economy.
[00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:48.861]  But meanwhile, if you're Tyson Chicken, you can, you know, move to China and ship in whatever tainted garbage you want.
[00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:55.125]  It is just total criminal lawlessness that's going on.
[00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:58.687]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:05.189]  Also, Harvard Kennedy School will make white privilege training mandatory for orientation.
[00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.056]  Exactly what I was talking about, just obsessing over that as the fount of problems.
[00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:19.623]  What race you are, what group you are, rather than the globalist group above us robbing the living daylights out of everyone.
[00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:21.565]  That's coming up as well.
[00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:25.609]  We'll have David Knight and others at the military base, the secret military base.
[00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:29.724]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:29.845 --> 00:05:31.806]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:38.009]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:43.211]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:48.034]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:52.676]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:05:52.976 --> 00:06:01.340]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.521]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:14.826]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:22.309]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.

[00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:34.073]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.354]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:06:36.534 --> 00:06:41.655]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:41.815 --> 00:06:46.737]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:50.040]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.163]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:54.383 --> 00:06:58.627]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:58.707 --> 00:07:08.736]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:08.936 --> 00:07:11.458]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:11.638 --> 00:07:19.688]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:07:19.848 --> 00:07:23.813]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:35.776]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:44.004]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:44.244 --> 00:07:48.947]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:55.831]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:55.911 --> 00:08:02.996]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:09.960]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.462]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:17.863]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:24.106]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:25.987]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.612]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:51.961]  In the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:07.924]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:11.707]  Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:09:12.447 --> 00:09:19.011]  You know, our youth are being brainwashed, not just here, but worldwide by UNESCO-UN established curriculum.
[00:09:20.271 --> 00:09:25.154]  And public schools in the United States are giving inoculations without parental consent.
[00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:28.816]  They're taking kids in many states to get abortions without parental consent.
[00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:33.079]  The state is taking over our children.
[00:09:34.102 --> 00:09:36.404]  And I have several articles here illustrating this today.
[00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:38.666]  One of them is from Infowars.com.
[00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:44.711]  Texas high school suspends student for NSA protest.
[00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:49.475]  Refusal to say the Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:09:50.836 --> 00:09:55.139]  In protest of the fact that the country's been overthrown by tyranny, basically.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.764]  Now, that dovetails with this article
[00:10:02.742 --> 00:10:12.307]  Dealing with the fact that Janesville superintendent issues apology for kids react to gay marriage video.
[00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:22.172]  And they are showing children, in school, young children, gay marriage.
[00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.771]  Now again, here's the issue, folks.
[00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:38.394]  There is a open agenda that's not denied in movies, in sitcoms, in dramas, in print, targeting small children, Nickelodeon Channel, you name it, to sexualize them.
[00:10:40.214 --> 00:10:44.895]  To have young girls dress up like street-walking prostitutes.
[00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:51.737]  And when you push heterosexual sex on children, that's called pedophilia.
[00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:58.165]  When you push so-called gay sex on children, it's called trendy and liberal.
[00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:09.069]  And remember Jocelyn Elders, when she was the Surgeon General under Clinton, saying that we need to teach them how to masturbate.
[00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:09.769]  Help them!
[00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:10.589]  Reach down!
[00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:11.130]  Do it!
[00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.670]  And that's how she talked.
[00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.510]  We can find that clip.
[00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:18.252]  And it just shows what these people are thinking about.
[00:11:18.352 --> 00:11:21.973]  I mean, in this culture, in this day and age,
[00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:27.872]  It's weird to talk to somebody's kid in the grocery store.
[00:11:28.592 --> 00:11:36.515]  I think it's normal to say hi to a kid that's staring at you or talking to you or doing something funny, but still a lot of people think it's weird, and rightfully so, because there's a lot of weirdos out there.
[00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:42.737]  Or if your neighbor's taking too big an interest in your children.
[00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:52.581]  Well, this is the state and the government taking a big interest, and we know what they're doing, and I, you know, going back again to the mid-90s, I can't even say on radio
[00:11:53.769 --> 00:12:14.788]  What they were teaching sixth graders in Massachusetts, remember they were taking them to a college dormitory, having them get in beds in a group setting, in a large dormitory, and were teaching them how to do things I didn't even know about until I was in college.
[00:12:15.448 --> 00:12:15.909]  Know about.
[00:12:18.817 --> 00:12:20.498]  And that famously got a lot of attention.
[00:12:20.598 --> 00:12:30.022]  And we had radio stations say on air, please don't read the World Net Daily at the time, articles quoting what, on video, they were teaching the kids.
[00:12:30.422 --> 00:12:31.203]  It's caught on video.
[00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:43.128]  Now, if you think adults taking your children into these facilities to be taught this is okay, you're nuts.
[00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:45.369]  And it's illegal.
[00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:53.733]  But this is being done to even elementary school students.
[00:12:54.393 --> 00:12:56.054]  And they say, well, it's for tolerance.
[00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:56.615]  Be tolerant.
[00:12:56.655 --> 00:13:05.220]  It's not tolerant to turn your children over to the state to be indoctrinated however they want to.
[00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:09.083]  It's not tolerant to be forcibly medicated with fluoride in the water.
[00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:10.844]  On record lowering IQs.
[00:13:11.444 --> 00:13:12.065]  Harvard study.
[00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:12.465]  Look it up.
[00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.090]  And I wanna play part of this video.
[00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.851]  I mean, it's 15 minutes long.
[00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:27.753]  We're not gonna play the whole thing, but this is what is being shown to children is, I mean, these children are as young as age seven.
[00:13:28.693 --> 00:13:29.793]  I have a daughter that's six.
[00:13:31.113 --> 00:13:40.355]  And if an adult parent did this, they showed this to their children, it would be called pedophilia.
[00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:43.990]  But when the state does it, it's A-OK.
[00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.952]  So let's play with the audio.
[00:13:47.172 --> 00:13:52.295]  Again, this is the Janesville School District, but this is a series that's shown on television and the internet.
[00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:55.697]  The fact is, this was shown to kids in school, so it's an issue.
[00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:58.459]  Hey, this is on television on the children channels.
[00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:00.520]  This is marketed to children.
[00:14:02.562 --> 00:14:03.762]  A man and a woman kissing.
[00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.904]  Two women kissing, two men kissing.
[00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:09.766]  It's none of the school's business, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:11.826 --> 00:14:15.227]  And they've turned the health classes into pushing all of this.
[00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:30.473]  The Janesville School District Superintendent issued a public apology for the showing of a video that she described as pro-gay marriage and in violation of district policies requiring the presentation of all sides of controversial or political topics.
[00:14:30.913 --> 00:14:32.594]  So they said, we're going to show all sides.
[00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:36.715]  Here's what the Southern Primary Law Center says about Alex Jones and Ron Paul.
[00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:38.516]  They're basically evil, terrorist, racist.
[00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:40.030]  That's all sides.
[00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.276]  We're going to lie about, and then here, you know, here's for your six-year-old daughters, seven-year-old daughters.
[00:14:45.257 --> 00:14:52.147]  In April, Craig High School's Gay Straight Alliance showed kids react to gay marriage.
[00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:53.770]  You look at the kids in the video, they look like they're seven.
[00:14:55.225 --> 00:15:07.574]  A 16-minute video of children reacting to marriage proposals between same-sex couples and sharing their thoughts on issues like gay marriage, bans, or whether they should stay friends with someone who told them they were gay.
[00:15:07.634 --> 00:15:19.643]  I mean, this is about making the whole world, it's like someone that comes against your backyard and bangs cymbals together like the Energizer Bunny and says, look at me, look at me, obsess, obsess, accept my culture.
[00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:22.555]  Except when I push.
[00:15:22.676 --> 00:15:26.800]  I mean, it is outrageous, and it's a total cultural overwrite, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:35.650]  While Homeland Security trains to take on gun owners, veterans, libertarians, conservatives, as the IRS persecutes them, Judicial Watch has gotten the smoking gun.
[00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:40.055]  It's on Infowars.com, proving the persecution and the lying in Congress.
[00:15:40.075 --> 00:15:40.656]  We're going to get to that.
[00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:56.314]  I mean, the whole world does not revolve around 3% of the population that's, quote, gay and, you know, a larger percentage of the female population that's bisexual.
[00:15:56.334 --> 00:16:09.122]  I mean, I'll tell you, quote, gayness between men is not very widespread, the statistics, and from my own experience living in Austin, which is a very pro, quote, gay city,
[00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:13.207]  It's not anywhere as common as women with women.
[00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:17.192]  That is almost ubiquitous across the country.
[00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:23.939]  I mean, that is definitely... I'd say half the women are bisexual.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.901]  And I'll just tell you point blank.
[00:16:26.642 --> 00:16:27.243]  And it's growing.
[00:16:29.525 --> 00:16:30.006]  Whatever.
[00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:45.219]  Listen, the issue here is that they are pushing this on children and chemicals are added to the food and water that in every mammal study cause species-wide sexual confusion.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.982]  Has there always been same-sex stuff going on?
[00:16:48.322 --> 00:16:48.582]  Yes.
[00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:50.506]  Roman times, you name it.
[00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:54.870]  Is it massively increasing from cultural promotion and chemical inducement?
[00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:54.870]  100%!
[00:16:56.951 --> 00:17:00.814]  Physiologically, men are more feminine.
[00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:05.699]  And women are hyper-feminine and almost male and are now attracted to women.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.123]  We have been chemically induced overall into this state of affairs.
[00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:16.728]  And it's like the Omega Man
[00:17:19.807 --> 00:17:24.829]  The Charlton Heston movie that's a remake of The Last Man on Earth, which got remade again into I Am Legend.
[00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:33.953]  And he finds the cure for the vampires that have been exposed to the virus, where they've got to have blood.
[00:17:34.873 --> 00:17:35.854]  They're basically undead.
[00:17:37.114 --> 00:17:39.035]  And they don't want it, and they kill him.
[00:17:41.876 --> 00:17:43.197]  And I'm not judging you.
[00:17:43.277 --> 00:17:44.177]  I don't dislike you.
[00:17:44.838 --> 00:17:46.318]  I'm not obsessed with what you do.
[00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:48.059]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:57.335]  But I'm allowed to say I don't want my children being taught and having gay marriage pushed on them.
[00:17:58.938 --> 00:17:59.700]  It's an agenda.
[00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:02.502]  And it's an unhealthy agenda.
[00:18:02.562 --> 00:18:08.427]  It goes along with the anti-gun agenda, the anti-family agenda, the state-runs-your-kids agenda.
[00:18:08.947 --> 00:18:09.768]  This is going on.
[00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:10.769]  I'm under attack.
[00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:12.690]  Heterosexuals are under attack.
[00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:18.855]  And we've quoted the documents from the 60s in Endgame 2.0 and shown the documents.
[00:18:18.935 --> 00:18:19.456]  It's on record.
[00:18:19.476 --> 00:18:27.122]  They said, we're going to promote this and add chemicals to the water and food to reduce fertility and promote homosexuality to reduce population.
[00:18:27.602 --> 00:18:28.503]  And they've done it.
[00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.091]  The CIA funded the sexual revolution.
[00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:41.754]  And as fun as that's been for a lot of people to have a bunch of sexual partners, it's bad for families and bad for children and has broken down civilization.
[00:18:42.954 --> 00:18:45.995]  So first they said we're going to get the women all working so the state's the dad.
[00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:47.456]  We're going to break up the family.
[00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:49.557]  We're going to have basically the state raise the kids.
[00:18:49.597 --> 00:18:51.857]  Then we're going to promote homosexuality so they don't have kids.
[00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:53.498]  That's a fact, folks.
[00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:54.658]  That's a fact.
[00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:55.779]  It's an agenda.
[00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:59.140]  And the people that have been brought up in it, chemically and culturally,
[00:19:00.489 --> 00:19:09.280]  That's all they've got, and it's their culture, and they're going to push it, and they're going to try to make you accept their agenda.
[00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:11.183]  And you know what?
[00:19:11.223 --> 00:19:11.884]  They're dominating.
[00:19:12.324 --> 00:19:17.331]  We have been usurped by a homosexual agenda.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.042]  And driving behind that is the U.N.
[00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:25.265]  and NAMBLA, who's accepted as an NGO at the U.N.
[00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.987]  for worldwide acceptance of adult child sex.
[00:19:28.488 --> 00:19:32.251]  That is absolutely destructive and pure, pure evil.
[00:19:34.552 --> 00:19:40.337]  And that's the agenda, and that's now being promoted by the U.N., and you now see that being pushed across the board.
[00:19:40.457 --> 00:19:42.218]  The sexualization of children, all of it.
[00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:47.583]  The memos have come out from Viacom that they're targeting nine-year-old girls and boys for sexualization.
[00:19:48.376 --> 00:19:49.737]  They don't want you to have your innocence.
[00:19:50.418 --> 00:19:51.639]  They want to wreck people.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:58.584]  It's one thing if you're an adult and a consenting adult, and you're not hurting anybody, that's your issue.
[00:19:59.405 --> 00:20:02.027]  But, it's time to stop denying what's going on.
[00:20:02.688 --> 00:20:05.530]  This is the end of humanity, the end of our biological cycle.
[00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:12.476]  They're just preparing us to accept the merger with the machines, in their own words, and the end of humanity as we know it.
[00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:15.634]  And so I think we should just have an honest debate about it.
[00:20:15.934 --> 00:20:20.999]  If you accept being overwritten by the eugenicist and want to die, then I respect that.
[00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:23.501]  But be honest, it is a predatory agenda.
[00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:24.302]  Just be honest.
[00:20:27.253 --> 00:20:30.396]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.

[00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:34.311]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:21:35.592 --> 00:21:37.313]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:21:37.694 --> 00:21:38.954]  Police call it robbery.
[00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.276]  We call it avoidable.
[00:21:41.776 --> 00:21:47.400]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.743]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[00:21:53.224 --> 00:21:59.267]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:07.152]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:11.374]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[00:22:11.434 --> 00:22:12.755]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[00:22:12.815 --> 00:22:14.896]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:32.139]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:35.502]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:22:35.582 --> 00:22:37.143]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:22:37.203 --> 00:22:43.469]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:49.454]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:22:49.574 --> 00:22:53.315]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:56.456]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:22:56.496 --> 00:23:04.579]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:06.880]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.960]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:17.044]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:23:17.244 --> 00:23:19.686]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:24.168]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:32.194]  What I'm about to tell you is based on information obtained from a little-known government document called FT-900.
[00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:42.138]  This bombshell government document contains evidence of a political scandal that will destroy Obama's political career and ruin the retirement of millions of unprepared Americans.
[00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:45.500]  I've just posted a video at www.obamacareer.com.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.620]  We're good to go.
[00:24:14.907 --> 00:24:19.779]  Visit www.ObamaSecret.com to view my newly released video.
[00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:24.510]  Again, that's www.ObamaSecret.com before it's too late.
[00:24:35.444 --> 00:24:42.547]  By the way, I just love David Knight and our reporters, and I know the office listens to the show, but I mean, I'm not a big manager.
[00:24:42.587 --> 00:24:47.649]  I let people kind of do what they want, but I realize why corporations in the system want to totally control people.
[00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.131]  It's because even if it's written directive, stuff doesn't happen.
[00:24:51.611 --> 00:24:53.032]  I said, go into the base at 1130.
[00:24:53.212 --> 00:24:54.833]  We're going to connect with you.
[00:24:55.173 --> 00:25:04.557]  We'll see you drive in and try to talk to the base commander about the fort that they have there in Virginia, outside Bowling Green, Virginia.
[00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:07.899]  Where they have the mock FEMA center.
[00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:15.181]  We already got in yesterday, now I want you to go talk to the commander who keeps refusing, or the public information officer, the PIO.
[00:25:15.562 --> 00:25:23.505]  But I said, over and over again, to them, David Knight and Biggs, I said, do it at 1130, and go in and talk to them.
[00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.226]  So I'm just filling you in on what happened, that's why I have to tell you what happened.
[00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:30.967]  This morning, they go, yeah, we already went in this morning, they won't talk to us.
[00:25:31.027 --> 00:25:32.268]  I said, I want you to do it live on air.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.841]  Go back and do it again, but don't drive in till 1133.
[00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:37.741]  We'll go live to you.
[00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:39.802]  They went, we get a garbled call.
[00:25:40.102 --> 00:25:41.782]  Sounds like the cops grabbed the phones away.
[00:25:41.802 --> 00:25:43.042]  It looks like they've been grabbed.
[00:25:44.383 --> 00:25:47.824]  And it wasn't on air to protect them because they didn't listen to what I told them.
[00:25:49.224 --> 00:25:54.285]  And I run into this literally constantly across the board.
[00:25:55.665 --> 00:25:57.746]  It'd be like if I was a football coach even in Little League.
[00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:04.272]  And I said, you know, pass in, you know, do a Hail Mary, and they send a running back through.
[00:26:04.292 --> 00:26:09.594]  Or I say, let's play football, and we played baseball.
[00:26:09.914 --> 00:26:10.694]  Anyways, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:10.954 --> 00:26:18.416]  I'm just worried about the guys, because we were going to have the live feed and go in, and it didn't happen.
[00:26:19.657 --> 00:26:24.378]  So, last I know, sounded like the cops grabbed their cell phone away.
[00:26:25.078 --> 00:26:28.019]  In America, for trying to go show this base,
[00:26:29.548 --> 00:26:38.877]  Where they're openly training at Fort AP Hill to take on the American people.
[00:26:38.938 --> 00:26:40.719]  It's a mock-up of areas of D.C.
[00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:45.702]  And it's got a subway the whole nine yards, and the guys went in there to cover it.
[00:26:46.362 --> 00:26:47.623]  And we have the live feeds of that.
[00:26:47.904 --> 00:26:48.784]  It was like a ghost town.
[00:26:48.845 --> 00:26:49.805]  No one responded to them.
[00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:53.729]  And then now they went back, and we need to get that report from them.
[00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.311]  So we'll find out just as soon as we can.
[00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.232]  You just got all that footage, Alex.
[00:26:58.673 --> 00:27:06.199]  And from now on, what I'm going to do is, I think I'm going to have a secretary follow me around.
[00:27:08.803 --> 00:27:14.007]  with an audio recorder and I'm gonna have orders just like the military issued to just everyone.
[00:27:14.027 --> 00:27:14.828]  It'll just all be written.
[00:27:14.848 --> 00:27:15.509]  In fact, I'm gonna do that.
[00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.849]  That's it.
[00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.511]  Because I'm trying to run this media operation.
[00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:20.833]  It's driving me crazy right now.
[00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:22.434]  Crazy.
[00:27:25.797 --> 00:27:28.219]  We're gonna have you go in the base live at 1108 today.
[00:27:28.719 --> 00:27:29.320]  Wait till then.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.901]  Then they go in at like 9 in the morning.
[00:27:32.843 --> 00:27:35.345]  Then I go, okay, you're gonna go back at 1130 and see why they won't talk to you.
[00:27:36.209 --> 00:27:38.250]  And they go at 11.15 and get grabbed by the police.
[00:27:39.171 --> 00:27:40.112]  I mean, I'm just guessing.
[00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:41.293]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:45.376]  And I can't throw the table over or punch a hole in the wall.
[00:27:46.236 --> 00:27:48.178]  Because I don't do things like that since I was a teenager.
[00:27:49.038 --> 00:27:50.679]  I just have to sit here and worry about my friends.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.801]  And just this whole backdrop.
[00:27:52.821 --> 00:27:58.225]  Just this whole... But maybe if I talk about it on air... Actually, we've said on air over and over again what we were planning to do.
[00:27:58.245 --> 00:28:00.206]  Because I want the establishment knowing what's going on.
[00:28:03.228 --> 00:28:03.929]  And then meanwhile...
[00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:15.490]  They're showing people footage of what looks like seven-year-old children watching men kissing men and women kissing women and just selling this agenda, whatever they want.
[00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:19.011]  In the public schools, your kids are just totally captured by this.
[00:28:20.992 --> 00:28:22.552]  They're so screwed up.
[00:28:24.052 --> 00:28:25.393]  The sexualization of children.
[00:28:26.393 --> 00:28:30.174]  And then the sexual perverts that are doing this hide behind civil rights.
[00:28:32.755 --> 00:28:33.815]  While they're busy right now,
[00:28:35.083 --> 00:28:38.845]  Balkanizing us on every single front.
[00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:44.067]  Oh, the editor of the New York Times got let go because she was a woman.
[00:28:44.368 --> 00:28:45.808]  Not because the magazine's failing.
[00:28:46.128 --> 00:28:47.029]  The newspaper's failing.
[00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:48.189]  They've got a magazine as well.
[00:28:48.209 --> 00:28:48.850]  They're both failing.
[00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:55.673]  Oh, look, Tyra Banks should produce transgender docu-series for VH1.
[00:28:55.713 --> 00:29:01.296]  You'd think that's the only thing happening, because they've got to get us ready to be transgender, because the chemicals they're putting in it will make everybody transgender.
[00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:10.318]  Oh look, Harvard Kennedy School will make white privilege training mandatory for orientation.
[00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:11.619]  That is white hate.
[00:29:11.739 --> 00:29:12.460]  Whites are bad.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.961]  Whites cause the problems.
[00:29:14.301 --> 00:29:15.041]  Whites are evil.
[00:29:15.922 --> 00:29:26.628]  Well don't worry, there's only 7% of the world that you can call white and none of them are having kids so, you know, maybe it'll be a good day when there's no white people left so we won't have to get the blame for everything.
[00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:34.313]  You know, the blame for Beethoven, the blame for rocket engines, the blame for computers, the blames for Western civilization.
[00:29:36.803 --> 00:29:39.686]  But it is true, the West has produced the most evil forms of government.
[00:29:41.027 --> 00:29:43.770]  That's just because evil people have used all the ingenuity of the West.
[00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:47.133]  As Jim Morrison said, the West is the best.
[00:29:47.193 --> 00:29:48.194]  I don't think you can deny that.
[00:29:48.214 --> 00:29:51.498]  A lot of cool stuff in the East as well, but I am a Western man.
[00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:53.400]  The West is the best.
[00:29:54.744 --> 00:29:56.906]  The West is the best.
[00:29:57.707 --> 00:29:58.667]  And it'll do the rest.
[00:29:59.448 --> 00:30:01.009]  The West is committing suicide.
[00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:14.861]  All kids think there is is gay marriage and hating white people, and American flags are bad, and families are bad, and dads are bad, and fast cars are bad, and freedom's bad, and checkpoints are good, and forced inoculations are good, and it just goes on and on.
[00:30:15.782 --> 00:30:16.683]  We're on the march.
[00:30:17.163 --> 00:30:18.765]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:19.705 --> 00:30:22.388]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:26.806 --> 00:30:30.129]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:30.249 --> 00:30:32.492]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:40.960]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.322]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[00:30:43.482 --> 00:30:57.350]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:05.215]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:11.699]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:20.564]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[00:31:20.684 --> 00:31:24.686]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality.
[00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:25.686]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:30.934]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:35.116]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:31:35.336 --> 00:31:38.757]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:31:39.017 --> 00:31:41.899]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:49.422]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:31:49.622 --> 00:31:53.264]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:31:53.464 --> 00:31:57.765]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:31:57.946 --> 00:32:03.868]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:03.908 --> 00:32:07.689]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:32:07.849 --> 00:32:10.390]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.950]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.331]  It's time to take action.
[00:32:13.471 --> 00:32:15.171]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:32:25.998 --> 00:32:29.863]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:30.024 --> 00:32:31.966]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:38.114]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:32:38.334 --> 00:32:48.097]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the Survival Silver Solution, the new InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:32:48.298 --> 00:32:52.839]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:32:53.119 --> 00:33:01.482]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:33:01.722 --> 00:33:03.643]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:33:03.863 --> 00:33:14.946]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:26.309]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today and find other amazing supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:37.842 --> 00:33:39.927]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:40.408 --> 00:33:45.358]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:48.765]  Okay, Tim Frugier just ran over from the other side of the building.
[00:33:50.416 --> 00:33:57.818]  A Lieutenant Collins from Fort AP Hill in Virginia called here asking if David Knight works for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:58.298 --> 00:34:09.102]  Again, they have a military base and within it a 300 acre training facility that according to our military expert Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, who's there, looked like it had torture tables and things like that in it.
[00:34:09.762 --> 00:34:15.884]  It's got a mosque, it's got a school, it's got a Christian Baptist style church, it's got a subway.
[00:34:16.744 --> 00:34:19.725]  And so we've been calling over and over again, sending emails for months.
[00:34:20.868 --> 00:34:21.308]  For months.
[00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:29.573]  And went there and tried to talk to people this morning, and again today, and the police have taken him to the police station.
[00:34:30.013 --> 00:34:32.735]  They were able to get a Ustream out as this happened.
[00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:36.437]  We have the audio and video of that going up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:36.757 --> 00:34:37.898]  It's a three-minute video.
[00:34:38.198 --> 00:34:43.021]  But right now, let's call Fort AP Hill and talk to Lieutenant Collins right now.
[00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:43.742]  Go ahead and dial it.
[00:34:43.762 --> 00:34:44.082]  Dialing it up.
[00:34:44.362 --> 00:34:45.302]  We're dialing it right now.
[00:34:45.363 --> 00:34:45.743]  Good job.
[00:34:46.323 --> 00:34:55.289]  And again, this is the craziness where the media comes to try to find out about what's happening, and they basically have arrested him.
[00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:58.691]  Because we're trying to ask, what is this facility?
[00:34:59.032 --> 00:34:59.832]  What is going on here?
[00:35:04.155 --> 00:35:05.396]  Calling Fort AP Hill.
[00:35:05.976 --> 00:35:07.237]  And the number the lieutenant called from.
[00:35:08.618 --> 00:35:13.241]  Next off this call sheet, just call the main... Your call is being answered by Audix.
[00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:28.955]  Yes, Lieutenant Collins, this is Alex Jones broadcasting live from Austin, Texas, calling you on air to just get all this on record.
[00:35:29.595 --> 00:35:37.338]  Since February, we've been calling and sending letters and emails, trying to be able to come and ask questions about the training facility there.
[00:35:38.038 --> 00:35:53.119]  And so both Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and David Knight work for me and you guys aren't able to just act like they've done something wrong as they're there simply trying to talk to the public information officer and discover what's going on.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.382]  And just so you know, they were streaming live whenever you guys took them to the police station.
[00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.342]  So that's all on record.
[00:35:59.782 --> 00:36:02.563]  And maybe now we can get some answers from you guys.
[00:36:03.403 --> 00:36:06.384]  But I'm going to put this call on hold.
[00:36:06.724 --> 00:36:08.585]  You pick it up and give them our studio line.
[00:36:09.225 --> 00:36:19.655]  Pick up this line right now, guys, or call that number back and give Lieutenant Collins the studio line so he can call back and talk to one of you about our reporters.
[00:36:20.236 --> 00:36:23.158]  So again, I'm Alex Jones from InfoWars.com.
[00:36:23.479 --> 00:36:25.380]  The backup site's PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:26.361 --> 00:36:29.805]  And you can check those sites out, and I'm sure you guys know who we are.
[00:36:30.225 --> 00:36:32.188]  Most people do, or somebody there at your facility does.
[00:36:32.808 --> 00:36:37.774]  And it's not bizarre for evil Americans to try to come find out about your Threat Fusion command base.
[00:36:38.134 --> 00:36:39.556]  I know you're training that we're the enemy there 24-7.
[00:36:39.756 --> 00:36:43.780]  You may be compartmentalized and not know that, but it's even in Army times.
[00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:44.821]  Stars and Stripes.
[00:36:44.841 --> 00:36:45.722]  I just want to fill you in.
[00:36:46.443 --> 00:36:53.009]  On the Forbes Magazine article and others how treasonous training is going on at facilities around the country to confiscate the firearms of Americans.
[00:36:53.629 --> 00:37:03.938]  And we're Americans who are going to expose these criminal activities that are going on to the wider world so we can cause a public debate about it and reverse it.
[00:37:04.338 --> 00:37:06.380]  So if you want to know what's going on, that's what's happening.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:13.166]  I'll flip you over here and one of my crew will give you our back phone number if you'd like to call us instead of the general number.
[00:37:13.186 --> 00:37:13.486]  Thank you.
[00:37:15.464 --> 00:37:20.886]  Okay, do we have the Ustream queued up with the police and what happened there?
[00:37:21.306 --> 00:37:25.328]  Let's go ahead and go to the video and audio of that for radio and TV viewers.
[00:37:27.969 --> 00:37:29.789]  You see a police officer staring at him.
[00:37:34.331 --> 00:37:36.111]  And the video is frozen here, but you can hear the audio.
[00:37:38.032 --> 00:37:40.053]  This is what you get in America for trying to get answers.
[00:37:43.254 --> 00:37:43.974]  Telling them who you are.
[00:37:43.994 --> 00:37:45.756]  We're being escorted to the police station.
[00:37:47.036 --> 00:37:48.958]  This is on Fort AP Hill.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.042]  This guy's going to escort you guys to the police station.
[00:37:55.302 --> 00:37:55.942]  Follow him please.
[00:37:56.122 --> 00:37:56.342]  Okay.
[00:37:59.885 --> 00:38:00.085]  Okay.
[00:38:07.489 --> 00:38:13.414]  Two years ago, one woman in upstate New York went to a military base she thought was a FEMA camp and they arrested her and threw her in a mental ward.
[00:38:13.914 --> 00:38:23.623]  Yeah, there's no NSA spying, there's no checkpoints, there's no license plate reading cameras, there's no smart boxes in the cars attached by the mile, there's no tyranny, they're not teaching you... We're being escorted to the police station.
[00:38:24.924 --> 00:38:26.805]  This is on Fort AP Hill.
[00:38:27.546 --> 00:38:28.747]  Is that a loop or is that the same thing?
[00:38:29.488 --> 00:38:31.349]  This guy's gonna escort you guys to the police station.
[00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.930]  Okay.
[00:38:33.274 --> 00:38:34.175]  That's a loop, Alex.
[00:38:34.715 --> 00:38:38.179]  Yeah, so we got one three-minute transmission out of them, but that's all we got.
[00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:40.401]  And it just loops the same thing.
[00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:48.969]  And again, I'm not mad at the guys, but I'm like, at 11.33, I'll go to you, you go live, drive in and try to get answers.
[00:38:51.817 --> 00:38:52.737]  And they did it like at 11.15.
[00:38:53.178 --> 00:39:00.761]  I'm just, for all my reporters, listen, I don't just throw numbers out and say things, you know, we need to have this on radio and TV with a live feed.
[00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:02.342]  That's the whole point of it.
[00:39:03.163 --> 00:39:04.403]  So, we're going to try to get answers.
[00:39:04.423 --> 00:39:06.224]  Do you guys need this so we can call their general number?
[00:39:07.785 --> 00:39:12.447]  Okay, well let's, uh, let's call the general number.
[00:39:12.467 --> 00:39:19.471]  We've got Director of Emergency Services, Office of the Commander, uh, Provost, Marshal.
[00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:21.012]  Who would we call?
[00:39:21.912 --> 00:39:23.133]  Visitor Control Center?
[00:39:23.353 --> 00:39:23.593]  No.
[00:39:24.093 --> 00:39:25.193]  Where's the police station here?
[00:39:29.395 --> 00:39:29.575]  Yep.
[00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:32.156]  And you know, you got the area code.
[00:39:32.176 --> 00:39:33.377]  It's 804 and then the number.
[00:39:34.057 --> 00:39:34.797]  I'll just find it then.
[00:39:34.817 --> 00:39:35.678]  We can go to a tape.
[00:39:36.038 --> 00:39:40.439]  Let's go to this training video of them brainwashing the kids about gay marriage.
[00:39:40.459 --> 00:39:41.760]  Because they're their kids.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.501]  The state, you know, kids belong to the state.
[00:39:45.231 --> 00:39:48.293]  Sex-crazed group of heterosexuals and homosexuals that want your kids.
[00:39:48.913 --> 00:39:49.733]  Bottom line, that's it.
[00:39:49.994 --> 00:39:51.374]  If you don't like it, you're a terrorist.
[00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:52.755]  Maybe you'll get arrested.
[00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:54.416]  So let's go ahead and play a clip of that.
[00:39:55.236 --> 00:39:56.117]  And there it comes.
[00:39:57.077 --> 00:40:00.299]  Yay!
[00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:04.041]  Little girls saying yay that the women are kissing.
[00:40:05.247 --> 00:40:06.167]  I'm guessing it's a yes.
[00:40:06.307 --> 00:40:08.008]  Women kneeling to each other and kissing.
[00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:10.169]  That was so adorable!
[00:40:10.689 --> 00:40:13.030]  All of these videos are just too cute!
[00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:14.331]  Well, this is new!
[00:40:14.731 --> 00:40:16.332]  That's what I want to see a lot.
[00:40:16.352 --> 00:40:18.873]  Gay and lesbian people shouldn't be hiding.
[00:40:18.933 --> 00:40:20.054]  Wait, what was that about?
[00:40:23.615 --> 00:40:25.636]  What did both of those videos have happen in them?
[00:40:26.116 --> 00:40:28.117]  Does the weaver marry the guy?
[00:40:28.137 --> 00:40:29.458]  It looks like a five-year-old.
[00:40:30.606 --> 00:40:30.726]  Oh.
[00:40:30.966 --> 00:40:32.648]  Two marriage proposals.
[00:40:33.168 --> 00:40:34.269]  Both with songs.
[00:40:34.489 --> 00:40:35.990]  I was like in awe of them.
[00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.252]  Boy and a boy together and a girl and a girl.
[00:40:38.272 --> 00:40:39.853]  There's a guy proposing to a guy.
[00:40:39.873 --> 00:40:41.274]  That's just crazy!
[00:40:41.294 --> 00:40:43.116]  Then there was a crazy looking girl.
[00:40:43.436 --> 00:40:44.136]  That's just crazy!
[00:40:44.216 --> 00:40:45.457]  How did the videos make you feel?
[00:40:45.718 --> 00:40:45.938]  Good.
[00:40:46.118 --> 00:40:46.858]  Made me feel good.
[00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:47.819]  It was really cool.
[00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:48.980]  I was so moved by that.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.121]  I'm sad.
[00:40:50.141 --> 00:40:51.602]  Oh, it's so cool.
[00:40:51.822 --> 00:40:53.103]  Why do you think that is bad?
[00:40:53.443 --> 00:40:53.784]  Cause...
[00:40:55.765 --> 00:40:58.766]  What do you think people's reactions were when they watched these videos?
[00:40:59.026 --> 00:41:00.886]  Um, it depends for certain people.
[00:41:01.126 --> 00:41:02.626]  A lot of people were happy.
[00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:03.587]  Really good, positive.
[00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:05.667]  We've literally turned our children over to be brainwashed.
[00:41:05.727 --> 00:41:08.568]  Some people must have been like, rock on.
[00:41:08.588 --> 00:41:14.909]  There's no way, they're gonna take the bank accounts, the pension funds, inject us forcibly, it's just hell on earth.
[00:41:14.929 --> 00:41:17.769]  It's okay though, a boy could like a boy or a girl could like a girl.
[00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:20.230]  Most people would have a reaction like, it's not
[00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.410]  Natural!
[00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.791]  It's normal now.
[00:41:22.811 --> 00:41:27.552]  A lot of people were upset at these marriage proposals because it was a man proposing to a man.
[00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:28.252]  Oh, they're bad.
[00:41:28.312 --> 00:41:29.492]  Let's be lectured to by a three-year-old.
[00:41:29.512 --> 00:41:31.653]  I don't know why anybody would be mad.
[00:41:31.693 --> 00:41:32.553]  This is wrong.
[00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:35.034]  Like, anyone should be able to marry anyone.
[00:41:35.074 --> 00:41:37.674]  You should feel happy that they're getting married.
[00:41:37.694 --> 00:41:39.135]  This is literal brainwashing.
[00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:42.936]  This is showing to people in public school.
[00:41:43.076 --> 00:41:45.276]  Tell another person who's married.
[00:41:45.356 --> 00:41:47.937]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:54.490]  If they were exploiting kids like this and had them saying things I agreed with, it would be creepy.
[00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:56.991]  This is uber, uber creepy.
[00:41:57.391 --> 00:42:03.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to give you, after I call it, the police phone number main desk there at Fort A.P.
[00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:07.074]  Hill, so perhaps they can let folks know we are Real Media.
[00:42:07.374 --> 00:42:11.035]  Real Media means you have a large audience and break major news at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:17.280]  And PrisonPlanet.com, and that everybody needs to call this number.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.261]  But let's go ahead and call the police desk right now, please.
[00:42:19.802 --> 00:42:22.084]  Let's go ahead and dial that number.
[00:42:22.384 --> 00:42:22.785]  Dialing.
[00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:24.366]  Thank you very much, John Bowne.
[00:42:25.347 --> 00:42:28.450]  And we will try to get our reporters out of there, who just do a fabulous job.
[00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:31.333]  It's just that I'm irritated that they didn't do what I told them.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.142]  Hey, this is Alex Jones.
[00:42:37.182 --> 00:42:38.424]  I'm broadcasting worldwide.
[00:42:38.464 --> 00:42:47.115]  I hear you have two of our reporters there, evil Americans that would dare try to come and find out what goes on on your secretive base, and a lieutenant.
[00:42:47.355 --> 00:42:48.437]  What was that lieutenant's name, guys?
[00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:53.531]  Lieutenant Collins called one of our main lines here.
[00:42:53.831 --> 00:42:58.374]  We're unable to talk to him, so can you tell him that Alex Jones is here, ready and happy to talk to him?
[00:42:58.595 --> 00:43:03.418]  Now, I'm an evil American, so I know you guys trained there to take on the American people.
[00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:05.459]  I understand that, but I am an American.
[00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:06.720]  Is it alright for you to talk to an American?
[00:43:09.582 --> 00:43:10.023]  Are you sure?
[00:43:10.043 --> 00:43:13.465]  Okay, because, I mean, I am kind of bad.
[00:43:13.505 --> 00:43:15.787]  I have politics like John Wayne, kind of.
[00:43:16.567 --> 00:43:17.388]  I mean, is that alright?
[00:43:17.408 --> 00:43:19.009]  Is that kind of bad?
[00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:20.314]  Hello?
[00:43:21.715 --> 00:43:22.935]  Anyways... Hang on a second, sir.
[00:43:23.275 --> 00:43:23.816]  Okay, thank you.
[00:43:24.376 --> 00:43:37.722]  Just identifying myself here because I'm broadcasting that... I mean, I realize that they publicly admit that the military mainly trains to take on gun owners, returning veterans, and the Tea Party, and libertarians, and I'm all of those things, except a returning veteran.
[00:43:38.222 --> 00:43:41.704]  But I did send a returning veteran there as one of my reporters, Joe Biggs.
[00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:42.384]  Wonder who he is.
[00:43:42.404 --> 00:43:43.885]  You can read an Esquire profile about him.
[00:43:44.805 --> 00:43:48.507]  But he's a pretty good guy, which probably means he's bad.
[00:43:49.295 --> 00:43:51.556]  You know, because I know being good is kind of bad nowadays.
[00:43:52.736 --> 00:43:55.958]  So, we're just calling up here, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:58.358 --> 00:44:13.784]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're here trying to find out about our reporters, who for three months, I guess since February, more than three months, have been trying to get a hold of you guys, sending you guys letters and stuff, so we just sent them on over, and now I guess they're, are they still on the hooscow?
[00:44:13.804 --> 00:44:14.605]  Because they haven't called us.
[00:44:16.906 --> 00:44:17.886]  Or have they been put on the train?
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.060]  I'm sorry, are you talking to us?
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.180]  Well, no, no.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.161]  I mean, I'm just wondering.
[00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:26.021]  They're here.
[00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:27.621]  They're still here.
[00:44:28.382 --> 00:44:28.942]  Well, great.
[00:44:29.562 --> 00:44:30.662]  You guys wanted to talk to me.
[00:44:30.682 --> 00:44:34.023]  Are you going to release them or are they going to be shipped at Camp X-Ray?
[00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:36.843]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:44:36.943 --> 00:44:37.883]  What was your name again, sir?
[00:44:38.203 --> 00:44:40.444]  It's Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[00:44:40.784 --> 00:44:40.944]  Okay.
[00:44:41.004 --> 00:44:41.884]  That's my full name.
[00:44:41.944 --> 00:44:42.444]  Yeah.
[00:44:42.544 --> 00:44:43.684]  My name is Bob McElroy.
[00:44:43.704 --> 00:44:45.105]  I'm the Public Affairs Officer here.
[00:44:45.445 --> 00:44:47.305]  Hey, we've wanted to talk to you since February.
[00:44:48.018 --> 00:45:01.131]  Well, I talked to somebody from your agency probably since February, and the Isometric Warfare Group is a tenant agency here on 48D Hill.
[00:45:02.413 --> 00:45:06.777]  So any media request and any media coverage has to go through them.
[00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:10.161]  Well, we've been trying to talk to them and they won't respond to us.
[00:45:10.563 --> 00:45:14.366]  Yeah, well, I don't know what their rationales are.
[00:45:14.406 --> 00:45:19.411]  Well, can our guys go over to their office, like 60 minutes or anybody would do, when for three months they won't talk to us?
[00:45:19.731 --> 00:45:21.593]  And then, you know, at least be thrown out of their office?
[00:45:21.613 --> 00:45:22.354]  I mean, we're friendly.
[00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:24.035]  Our guys are pretty polite, aren't they?
[00:45:24.395 --> 00:45:27.979]  I mean, we just... Because they don't have an office on their 300 acres.
[00:45:28.039 --> 00:45:28.479]  We looked.
[00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.761]  So, is it on your base?
[00:45:32.383 --> 00:45:34.525]  It's on the post here, yeah.
[00:45:34.545 --> 00:45:36.006]  Like I said, they're a tenant agency.
[00:45:36.978 --> 00:45:41.702]  Uh, but you know, we've got other tenant agencies like the, uh, we have an Army Reserve Center here.
[00:45:41.742 --> 00:45:42.803]  We have... The FBI?
[00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:43.584]  The FBI's there?
[00:45:44.244 --> 00:45:44.765]  Uh, well, no.
[00:45:44.885 --> 00:45:48.568]  They come down here on occasion to train, but they've got their own facilities.
[00:45:49.168 --> 00:45:52.091]  Uh, we have the Explosive Ordnance Disposal School here on post.
[00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:54.032]  So they're all tenant agencies.
[00:45:55.013 --> 00:45:58.735]  Normally, they handle their own media requests.
[00:45:59.076 --> 00:46:02.978]  Well, that's great then because the police took our guys to you.
[00:46:03.418 --> 00:46:10.702]  They were going around looking for that because we read that their tenant agency was on your regular base, not their tenant facility.
[00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:13.784]  So, can they go over and talk to them or can they be released?
[00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:15.805]  Yeah, they're going to be released.
[00:46:16.225 --> 00:46:20.308]  As far as talking to AWG, they're going to have to take that up with their PAO.
[00:46:21.768 --> 00:46:23.529]  So are my guys going to be escorted to the gate?
[00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:26.031]  They're not going to be able to go over there and try to talk to the people?
[00:46:27.512 --> 00:46:28.613]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.
[00:46:28.813 --> 00:46:29.193]  Sure, sure.
[00:46:29.313 --> 00:46:35.577]  What do we do though when they won't talk to us and we physically try to go find them and we're now in the police station?
[00:46:37.258 --> 00:46:46.784]  Well, you know, I can't talk for the AWG and I don't know why they won't talk with you.
[00:46:48.988 --> 00:46:55.131]  I can only address that, you know, we control access to the insulation out of security for the people who work here and live here.
[00:46:55.952 --> 00:46:58.193]  And that we have procedures that we should follow.
[00:46:58.213 --> 00:47:06.837]  And we don't ban the press or deny the press access to the insulation, but we just ask that they follow the rules just like everybody else.
[00:47:06.877 --> 00:47:07.317]  Sure, sure.
[00:47:07.337 --> 00:47:09.178]  One of my guys showed up and went through the gate.
[00:47:09.218 --> 00:47:10.439]  We're friendly and nice.
[00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:12.460]  Right, but nobody knew he was coming, sir.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:18.543]  And it would have been appropriate for your agency to contact
[00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:25.721]  I believe you said you have talked to our guys before.
[00:47:26.322 --> 00:47:27.882]  I did a couple of months ago.
[00:47:27.922 --> 00:47:30.083]  No, we called you before they came, but I understand you're busy.
[00:47:30.103 --> 00:47:31.504]  Listen, let's just get this straight.
[00:47:32.104 --> 00:47:40.687]  It's in Forbes magazine, it's in Army Times, that part of the training going on at that facility and others is to take on the Tea Party returning veterans and gun owners.
[00:47:41.127 --> 00:47:43.750]  Guys, put Forbes on the screen for TV viewers.
[00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:54.640]  So, the point is, is that it's not weird that we want to shine a light of truth on this, that there's a Baptist church at the facility, and that the military is trying to take on the American people.
[00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:55.902]  That's why we're doing this.
[00:47:55.922 --> 00:48:01.147]  We're countering the PSYOP as real organic, like French resistance, you know, would have done in 1943.
[00:48:01.227 --> 00:48:01.747]  So, we're in the info war.
[00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:09.713]  And we understand that's not your division in the Pentagon, but the Pentagon's been captured by outside forces.
[00:48:10.114 --> 00:48:11.134]  We are the American people.
[00:48:11.194 --> 00:48:12.035]  We are the resistance.
[00:48:12.315 --> 00:48:15.937]  We're using the press and the truth to try to expose it.
[00:48:16.398 --> 00:48:25.504]  And so I know you're probably a nice guy and, you know, not compartmentalized in the civilian inmate labor camp program or the Emergency Centers Establishment Act or InfraGard.
[00:48:25.564 --> 00:48:26.704]  I got the secret documents in 98.
[00:48:27.685 --> 00:48:27.985]  No, no.
[00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.045]  No, we don't do that.
[00:48:54.008 --> 00:48:57.090]  Okay, well thank you, because I had Delta Force once do it at gunpoint.
[00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:12.002]  Again, I can't speak for them, but you know, listen, our policy is to welcome the press and to show them whatever they want, to help them get their story and to be as transparent as possible, you know, security regulations.
[00:49:12.022 --> 00:49:13.824]  I understand, sir, and what's your full name?
[00:49:14.725 --> 00:49:16.446]  My name is Bob McElroy.
[00:49:17.467 --> 00:49:18.928]  Okay, Bob, I want to say one thing for you.
[00:49:19.028 --> 00:49:19.248]  Sure.
[00:49:19.969 --> 00:49:21.350]  I bet you got a wife and kids, don't you?
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.262]  No, no, but I mean most people I know in the military or that work in the civilian area are good people.
[00:49:27.822 --> 00:49:30.383]  And I'm going to tell you straight right now and I'm going to let you go because I know you're busy.
[00:49:30.663 --> 00:49:31.484]  And I appreciate letting them go.
[00:49:32.184 --> 00:49:33.004]  I've studied this.
[00:49:33.084 --> 00:49:33.765]  This is real.
[00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:34.745]  This isn't rhetoric.
[00:49:35.145 --> 00:49:37.846]  They've got us in a normalcy bias to accept this takeover.
[00:49:37.926 --> 00:49:38.567]  It's a PSYOP.
[00:49:39.187 --> 00:49:41.248]  It's a sigh up on record, it's hiding in plain view.
[00:49:41.609 --> 00:49:45.711]  The globalists are going to implode this country, destroy our way of life and take over.
[00:49:45.991 --> 00:49:53.716]  And that base, I know has multi-training facets for overseas, but it's also to acclimate the troops before they deploy to the U.S.
[00:49:53.756 --> 00:49:55.277]  for real, and that's on record.
[00:49:55.497 --> 00:49:56.918]  And I want you to know it's treason.
[00:49:57.458 --> 00:50:04.502]  The training going on there is treason, and that I represent, and you represent by the way, but I'm coming to you from FEMA Region 6.
[00:50:05.183 --> 00:50:06.143]  You're in your own region.
[00:50:06.564 --> 00:50:10.266]  You need to realize, sir, that our military isn't run by America anymore.
[00:50:10.586 --> 00:50:13.408]  It's run by the globalists, and I'm here as a friend.
[00:50:13.948 --> 00:50:25.342]  Telling you and everybody on the base and using this whole fact we went out there as an illustration of what we're facing, sir, and that the military is training to pull triggers on the American people.
[00:50:25.642 --> 00:50:29.827]  We have a video that has three and a half million views by Rob Dew that we'll send you a link to.
[00:50:30.008 --> 00:50:30.668]  Do you have an email?
[00:50:31.674 --> 00:50:31.914]  Yeah.
[00:50:32.114 --> 00:50:32.695]  Are we on the air?
[00:50:33.255 --> 00:50:35.336]  Yes, I told them up front we're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:50:35.636 --> 00:50:36.517]  Okay, yeah.
[00:50:37.157 --> 00:50:41.379]  If you'd like to call me privately, I'll send you my email address.
[00:50:41.399 --> 00:50:47.362]  I'm going to send you the footage of the Marines training to execute Americans on their knees, shooting them in the back of the head, okay?
[00:50:47.702 --> 00:50:51.825]  And by the way, my soldier that's there, he's taken people to torture camps himself.
[00:50:51.885 --> 00:50:53.325]  So we all know what's really going on.
[00:50:53.686 --> 00:50:54.626]  I really appreciate you.
[00:50:54.646 --> 00:50:55.587]  We're going to get you some info.
[00:50:55.807 --> 00:50:56.447]  Please release them.
[00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:58.248]  Yeah, we're going to.
[00:50:58.462 --> 00:50:59.243]  Alright, thank you very much.
[00:50:59.863 --> 00:51:00.343]  Thank you, sir.
[00:51:00.383 --> 00:51:01.604]  I mean, let's get in the real world, folks.
[00:51:02.785 --> 00:51:04.507]  And again, this is how we gotta break through this.
[00:51:05.367 --> 00:51:06.908]  I mean, this is coming down on us!
[00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:08.850]  You can't cover it up anymore!
[00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:09.630]  We're done!
[00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:14.014]  And we're going to engage in the Info War and spotlight these facilities.
[00:51:14.334 --> 00:51:15.555]  And nothing is gonna stop us.
[00:51:16.976 --> 00:51:19.138]  Again, we're trying to update Info Wars with a new design.
[00:51:19.178 --> 00:51:20.639]  People liked it, but it has some bugs.
[00:51:20.659 --> 00:51:21.620]  We got consultants on it.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.760]  We got a great crew.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.061]  That should get fixed in the next few days.
[00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:25.362]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:25.763]  Stay with us.
[00:51:27.512 --> 00:51:30.654]  So my elementary school-aged child is begging me for a cell phone.
[00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:31.875]  Please, Mom, please!
[00:51:32.115 --> 00:51:33.035]  All the kids have them!
[00:51:33.055 --> 00:51:42.681]  But I've seen the research, and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies that close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked.
[00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.242]  Harmful wireless radiation is real.

[00:52:22.826 --> 00:52:23.847]  Get the mud now.
[00:52:24.227 --> 00:52:25.388]  MyMagicMud.com
[00:52:26.369 --> 00:52:28.932]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:34.079]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:34.339 --> 00:52:42.169]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:42.449 --> 00:52:46.754]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:46.954 --> 00:52:50.799]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:56.665]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:56.906 --> 00:52:57.326]  It is rare to
[00:52:57.346 --> 00:52:57.766]  We're good.
[00:53:26.152 --> 00:53:30.514]  I'm sick of how the big drug companies are keeping men from fixing their ED without pills.
[00:53:30.854 --> 00:53:37.296]  Matt Cook here from GetEDSolutions.com, and I've helped thousands of men fully recover from ED without pills, pumps, or supplements.
[00:53:37.376 --> 00:53:41.397]  But the big drug companies collect $5 billion in revenue from sales of ED medications.
[00:53:41.597 --> 00:53:42.918]  They don't want my message to get out.
[00:53:43.018 --> 00:53:44.198]  Things are so much better now.
[00:53:44.558 --> 00:53:46.739]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[00:53:46.919 --> 00:53:49.320]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.783]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[00:53:52.943 --> 00:53:56.205]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[00:53:56.445 --> 00:54:07.334]  If you're one of the 52% of men who suffer ED, you must go to my website at GetEDSolutions.com and watch an instant web class that shows you how to get rid of your ED forever from the privacy of your own home.
[00:54:07.474 --> 00:54:11.737]  That's GetEDSolutions.com for an eye-opening web class you can watch instantly.
[00:54:11.837 --> 00:54:21.225]  You'll never be the same, and your wife or girlfriend will thank you because you were smart enough not to just believe the big drug companies, but to find out the truth about ED at GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:21.405 --> 00:54:23.267]  That's GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:23.387 --> 00:54:24.948]  GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:24.968 --> 00:54:39.200]  You know, I shot that guy straight earlier.
[00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:43.876]  The Public Information Officer, there at Fort A.P.
[00:54:44.056 --> 00:54:44.356]  Hill.
[00:54:48.739 --> 00:54:51.920]  We really have been taken over by a eugenicist world government.
[00:54:53.141 --> 00:55:01.306]  They really are attacking our families, our energy systems, like an alien force would.
[00:55:02.327 --> 00:55:23.631]  A smart outside alien intelligence would come to the planet, pose as humans, take over, and never let the humans know they're under attack, and pose as the savior, creating crises to get more and more control, while building the technological system that the aliens would want to inhabit and control, while preparing to exterminate the general population in the process of dumbing them down.
[00:55:25.114 --> 00:55:28.256]  And again, I'm not saying that it's aliens doing this.
[00:55:28.636 --> 00:55:37.622]  As an allegory, you have to break with their system and realize that they're using us to destroy ourselves in full spectrum dominance.
[00:55:39.363 --> 00:55:45.787]  The globalists are funding the radical Islam so that they can have Western civilization fight it to destroy all of us together.
[00:55:47.028 --> 00:55:54.353]  The military is training to confiscate our guns and training to put us in FEMA camps and it's now mainstream news
[00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.091]  But they report it like it's good, and they don't want to have a debate about it.
[00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:03.032]  They want to just act like everything's okay and this is all normal.
[00:56:03.353 --> 00:56:03.993]  It's not!
[00:56:07.414 --> 00:56:10.715]  And it's being done because they're destroying this country.
[00:56:11.695 --> 00:56:14.576]  No other media would dare go to the secret military base.
[00:56:17.497 --> 00:56:18.738]  That doubles as a FEMA camp.
[00:56:18.818 --> 00:56:22.079]  Clearly it's set up as an auxiliary with Constantino around the internal area.
[00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.540]  That's meant for holding real people.
[00:56:25.598 --> 00:56:27.779]  Clearly they're practicing torture in the facility.
[00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:30.399]  It's probably a CIA torture training facility.
[00:56:31.379 --> 00:56:34.620]  Folks, Biggs brought people by the scores to be tortured.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:35.841]  It's been all over the news.
[00:56:36.661 --> 00:56:40.582]  He's in Esquire magazine about similar things but never released that information.
[00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:49.504]  It's on record that's what they do at torture centers all over Afghanistan, all over Iraq, all over the world.
[00:56:54.116 --> 00:56:56.678]  And now they're training that we're the enemy, the American people.
[00:56:56.718 --> 00:56:57.759]  It was always going to be flipped.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:05.547]  I told you before 9-11 they'd stage terror attacks, claim it was Muslims, use that as a clash of civilizations, build up a domestic control grid, then flip it on us.
[00:57:05.927 --> 00:57:07.148]  That's the battle plan.
[00:57:07.428 --> 00:57:10.131]  It's now been flipped six years ago secretly.
[00:57:10.651 --> 00:57:12.033]  Now they're rolling it out publicly.
[00:57:12.093 --> 00:57:12.713]  What does that mean?
[00:57:15.215 --> 00:57:17.678]  It means they're getting ready to go operational against us.
[00:57:19.673 --> 00:57:26.237]  And the globalists plan on the military being wiped out, and the police being wiped out, in that war with the patriots.
[00:57:27.198 --> 00:57:32.141]  Then the globalists sit back later and come in as the stabilization force, just like they've done in Ukraine.
[00:57:33.843 --> 00:57:35.564]  They want military dead.
[00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.505]  They want police dead.
[00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:41.107]  They know statistically you're libertarian conservatives, most of you.
[00:57:42.268 --> 00:57:43.769]  They know most of you are good people.
[00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:47.232]  Better on average than the general public, just from... that's true!
[00:57:48.243 --> 00:57:49.084]  Not kissing your butt!
[00:57:49.544 --> 00:58:02.993]  But if you're not smart enough to not follow criminal orders, and if you're not smart enough to expose this and say no to it, and not go along with it like you did the Syrian war, aiding Al Qaeda, you said no to that, they're going to win!
[00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:05.415]  You understand that?
[00:58:05.455 --> 00:58:06.816]  The allegory is they live.
[00:58:07.056 --> 00:58:08.097]  Watch it and realize it.
[00:58:08.948 --> 00:58:13.710]  If you just consciously faced it, there would be no debate about joining the Republic.
[00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.791]  NO DEBATE ABOUT FIGHTING THIS!
[00:58:16.131 --> 00:58:16.652]  NO DEBATE!
[00:58:16.832 --> 00:58:21.774]  They shoot our kids up with cancer viruses and the vaccines and fluoride brain damages them.
[00:58:22.054 --> 00:58:23.315]  Look up the Harvard study.
[00:58:23.735 --> 00:58:26.016]  I've got eco-science written by the White House.
[00:58:26.056 --> 00:58:31.558]  Science are the year I was born, 40 years ago, saying they're doing it to brain damage us.
[00:58:31.798 --> 00:58:33.039]  The book's free online.
[00:58:33.379 --> 00:58:35.060]  READ IT, FOR GOD'S SAKES!
[00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:38.641]  Face it right now!
[00:58:38.661 --> 00:58:39.702]  We're under attack!
[00:58:40.602 --> 00:58:42.182]  Break out of your mind control!
[00:58:43.142 --> 00:58:44.983]  I'm fighting these people as hard as I can.
[00:58:46.383 --> 00:58:49.324]  They're moving into a phase where they're going to try to shut us down.
[00:58:49.344 --> 00:58:52.545]  You think you're going to go along with that and you're going to be safe?
[00:58:52.925 --> 00:58:55.525]  No, they want it all shut down because they're going to hunt you down.
[00:58:55.766 --> 00:58:57.426]  You're their number one enemy and you know it.
[00:58:57.446 --> 00:59:00.867]  That's why they've been injecting you with all the cancer viruses and everything else.
[00:59:02.827 --> 00:59:05.388]  You are their number one enemy and you protect them.
[00:59:07.369 --> 00:59:08.630]  Total mind control!
[00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:10.891]  You're like clones out of Oblivion!
[00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:12.431]  Wake up to the fact!
[00:59:12.952 --> 00:59:14.012]  Stop being a clone!
[00:59:14.332 --> 00:59:15.533]  You gotta see it for yourself!
[00:59:16.773 --> 00:59:25.777]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:59:25.837 --> 00:59:34.021]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:34.241 --> 00:59:38.945]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:39.125 --> 00:59:45.851]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[00:59:53.097 --> 00:59:59.963]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:00:00.103 --> 01:00:04.465]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:00:19.631 --> 01:00:21.572]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:22.032 --> 01:00:24.753]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:31.533 --> 01:00:35.696]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:36.376 --> 01:00:37.177]  You want answers?
[01:00:37.957 --> 01:00:38.858]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:39.498 --> 01:00:43.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:47.783]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:52.366 --> 01:00:53.547]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[01:00:53.587 --> 01:00:55.968]  Our reporters are still being held at Fort A.P.
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:58.730]  Hill.
[01:01:01.078 --> 01:01:02.459]  Outside Bowling Green, Virginia.
[01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.580]  We're daring to try to go investigate the FEMA camp.
[01:01:08.682 --> 01:01:12.003]  The FCC just voted to advance new internet rules.
[01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:13.764]  That just popped up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.345]  You guys, print that for me.
[01:01:15.585 --> 01:01:17.166]  Ted Cruz vows to fight it.
[01:01:17.666 --> 01:01:18.507]  That's big news.
[01:01:18.647 --> 01:01:19.987]  Up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:20.568 --> 01:01:22.489]  USDA to purchase submachine guns.
[01:01:24.121 --> 01:01:25.622]  The mythology of the Supreme Court.
[01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:29.505]  Harvard Kennedy School will make white privilege training mandatory for orientation.
[01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:33.048]  Homeowners AR-15 trumps home invaders.
[01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:35.030]  AIM sure helps.
[01:01:37.892 --> 01:01:40.735]  Cities all over America are becoming extremely cruel to the homeless.
[01:01:40.755 --> 01:01:41.776]  That's all part of the collapse.
[01:01:42.416 --> 01:01:43.617]  Incredible shrinking U.S.
[01:01:43.657 --> 01:01:44.198]  military.
[01:01:45.779 --> 01:01:47.000]  Spying is meant to crush U.S.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.142]  citizens' dissent, not catch terrorists.
[01:01:50.086 --> 01:01:51.867]  Report food prices skyrocketing.
[01:01:51.887 --> 01:01:54.469]  We're going to have a major problem come this fall.
[01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:58.631]  Absolutely, I need to be talking about all of that and more.
[01:02:02.313 --> 01:02:11.259]  I don't know when we'll be able to talk to our reporters about going to the FEMA camp, treason training camp.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.762]  We're just supposed to incrementally just accept all this and just
[01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:29.011]  If you saw the video or heard the audio earlier of what looks like four, five, and six-year-olds in public schools being taught, going, it's wonderful, gay marriage, showing men kissing each other.
[01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:32.593]  I mean, it's just so evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:33.494 --> 01:02:43.160]  I did have an experience where on the first day of class, a professor told all of the Ted Cruz-supporting teabaggers to get the hell out of his classroom before he sent us home to our mothers in a body bag.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.561]  Well, that's liberal.
[01:02:46.274 --> 01:02:51.517]  I mean, even if I didn't like Ted Cruz, you shouldn't have people saying, you know, they were going to kill you if you support them.
[01:02:55.639 --> 01:03:02.603]  It's just, it's flaming authoritarianism with a bunch of people prancing around talking about how good they are.
[01:03:05.664 --> 01:03:06.605]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:03:08.606 --> 01:03:14.509]  And the government, every agency out there is arming to the teeth and training for war with us.
[01:03:15.814 --> 01:03:17.235]  And they keep telling them the war is coming.
[01:03:17.255 --> 01:03:18.856]  Well, yeah, because the globalists are going to start it.
[01:03:19.397 --> 01:03:23.120]  Even if we don't ever physically resist them, they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.361]  We've caught them doing it over and over again.
[01:03:27.123 --> 01:03:29.585]  We even know the names of the people that bombed Oklahoma City.
[01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:30.105]  They're public.
[01:03:30.886 --> 01:03:34.728]  We know the FBI anti-terrorism team that was there the days before that got caught lying about it.
[01:03:35.609 --> 01:03:37.230]  We know who planted the bombs, everything.
[01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:39.392]  They got police officer witnesses.
[01:03:39.432 --> 01:03:42.314]  We got people that worked in HUD that were witnesses.
[01:03:43.015 --> 01:03:44.376]  ATF informant witnesses.
[01:03:46.874 --> 01:03:47.395]  Doesn't matter.
[01:03:47.435 --> 01:03:48.236]  They just blew it up.
[01:03:49.777 --> 01:03:53.041]  So they can grandstand and talk about how horrible everybody is.
[01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:59.388]  As soon as our reporters get out, we'll find out exactly what happened to them.
[01:03:59.408 --> 01:04:00.490]  That should be very, very soon.
[01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:03.894]  So just keep calling their cell phones until you get a hold of them, guys.
[01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:06.837]  We're on it.
[01:04:08.086 --> 01:04:09.207]  I'm going to take your phone calls.
[01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:16.313]  I want to hear from first-time callers who specifically want to talk about the FCC planning to claim that they control the Internet.
[01:04:17.174 --> 01:04:23.219]  They specifically want to talk about... I'm not, again, against gay people and don't hate them.
[01:04:23.239 --> 01:04:24.560]  I mean, really, it's not on my radar screen.
[01:04:26.573 --> 01:04:29.716]  But at the same time, it's the agenda and pushing it on kids.
[01:04:29.736 --> 01:04:42.747]  I mean, this is criminal, in my view, what the public schools and others are doing, and it just gets more brazen, more bold, and they just grandstand, and it's a cultural takeover, and I don't like being forced by anybody to do anything.
[01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:51.354]  And when it gets down to my children, it makes me really, really angry, and it's really, really sick, and really, really authoritarian.
[01:04:54.096 --> 01:04:54.997]  And that's my bottom line.
[01:04:59.298 --> 01:05:08.161]  Ladies and gentlemen, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:09.622]  800-259-9231.
[01:05:10.942 --> 01:05:13.023]  First-time callers, I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:05:13.063 --> 01:05:14.664]  Got a lot of news we haven't hit yet.
[01:05:14.724 --> 01:05:16.964]  It's coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:05:19.005 --> 01:05:21.126]  Stay with us on the other side.
[01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:21.186]  800-259-9231.
[01:05:21.206 --> 01:05:22.066]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:26.676 --> 01:05:33.743]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:05:33.843 --> 01:05:36.005]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:05:36.186 --> 01:05:41.291]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:46.416]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:46.616 --> 01:05:49.679]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:05:49.939 --> 01:05:53.803]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:05:54.023 --> 01:05:58.267]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:58.348 --> 01:06:08.357]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:06:08.577 --> 01:06:11.100]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:06:12.081 --> 01:06:19.330]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:23.455]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:26.613 --> 01:06:34.477]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:06:34.737 --> 01:06:36.818]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:06:36.978 --> 01:06:39.600]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:43.782]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:06:44.022 --> 01:06:47.243]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:06:47.263 --> 01:06:54.547]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:06:54.707 --> 01:06:58.851]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:06:59.031 --> 01:07:00.712]  We are the true media.
[01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:03.435]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:07:03.515 --> 01:07:07.158]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:07:07.278 --> 01:07:11.401]  Join us at Infowarsnews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:11.622 --> 01:07:14.504]  Members can share their memberships with up to 11 people.
[01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:17.727]  By subscribing, you will literally be buying war bonds.
[01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:18.467]  I think?
[01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:40.541]  And other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:51.089]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:07:51.389 --> 01:08:04.800]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:11.286]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:08:11.526 --> 01:08:20.154]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[01:08:27.765 --> 01:08:32.769]  I feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda.
[01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.290]  It's not left or right.
[01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.511]  It's, hey, there's mind control going on.
[01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:40.014]  The signal's broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media.
[01:08:40.334 --> 01:08:43.056]  Just become aware of it, and they'll say there's nothing going on.
[01:08:43.296 --> 01:08:47.399]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete!
[01:08:52.822 --> 01:08:57.363]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
[01:08:58.423 --> 01:09:00.664]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful.
[01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.425]  And they have blinded us to the truth!
[01:09:03.825 --> 01:09:06.785]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[01:09:06.805 --> 01:09:09.046]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[01:09:09.806 --> 01:09:12.027]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:17.908]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:24.534]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:34.544]  Outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, pinched on top of us, from birth to death, are our owners!
[01:09:35.065 --> 01:09:41.972]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:52.515]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[01:09:53.155 --> 01:10:00.698]  The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:08.440]  For the first time in all of human history,
[01:10:10.959 --> 01:10:13.021]  Mankind is politically awakened.
[01:10:13.562 --> 01:10:14.603]  That's a total new reality.
[01:10:16.205 --> 01:10:18.127]  I've got one that can see.
[01:10:18.928 --> 01:10:20.490]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[01:10:21.571 --> 01:10:31.422]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root of all our problems.
[01:10:32.276 --> 01:10:33.677]  It's a new morning in America.
[01:10:34.418 --> 01:10:34.758]  Fresh.
[01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:35.679]  Vital.
[01:10:36.359 --> 01:10:37.821]  The old cynicism is gone.
[01:10:38.641 --> 01:10:40.623]  We have faith in our leaders.
[01:10:41.183 --> 01:10:44.286]  We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
[01:10:45.567 --> 01:10:49.150]  It really boils down to our ability to accept.
[01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.332]  We don't need pessimism.
[01:10:51.352 --> 01:10:53.454]  I have two words for you.
[01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:55.135]  Predator drums.
[01:10:55.515 --> 01:11:00.499]  And who are you, little fella?
[01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:02.731]  You will never see it coming.
[01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:12.297]  Now predicting the first guy who uses a Second Amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is gonna be a folk hero in this country.
[01:11:14.419 --> 01:11:19.802]  There is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[01:11:20.423 --> 01:11:25.246]  I'm just trying to warn you folks, the television is a giant LED weapon system.
[01:11:26.155 --> 01:11:27.275]  It's so advanced.
[01:11:27.976 --> 01:11:29.856]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks.
[01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:33.918]  They do all sorts of testing on great apes, rhesus monkeys, the whole nine yards.
[01:11:34.058 --> 01:11:40.039]  And they go, oh, you didn't see this, and punch a button and it'd be hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.501]  All I ever have to do is be famous.
[01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:45.541]  People watch me.
[01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:47.422]  And they love me.
[01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:49.823]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
[01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:50.823]  I know you want it.
[01:11:50.903 --> 01:11:52.323]  Hell, everybody does.
[01:11:52.804 --> 01:11:53.944]  Do it to your own kind.
[01:11:55.174 --> 01:11:56.095]  What's the threat?
[01:11:56.715 --> 01:11:58.417]  We all sell out every day.
[01:11:58.517 --> 01:12:00.178]  Might as well be on the winning team.
[01:12:00.699 --> 01:12:07.905]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[01:12:09.466 --> 01:12:11.588]  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
[01:12:12.849 --> 01:12:14.910]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.031]  You know what?
[01:12:16.111 --> 01:12:17.352]  You got a little courage.
[01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:19.074]  Stand up for yourself.
[01:12:21.056 --> 01:12:27.681]  What the system does is bring people incrementally into it and test them.
[01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:56.467]  And to see if they'll go along with compartmentalization and mindlessly follow orders.
[01:12:57.208 --> 01:13:20.605]  And through that dehumanizing process they have built this incredibly corrupt system where the mega banks are pretty much tax exempt, the big corporations are exempt, Obama's friends are exempt from Obamacare, the Socialist Party in France is exempt from taxes on record, has Swiss bank accounts, they don't get in trouble, the EU Parliament is ceremonial and points out the bureaucrats run it and they're tax exempt.
[01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.842]  So how do you keep that going?
[01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:30.046]  Well, you put out diversions, distractions, you have the universities teach that white people are all bad, and that's the source of evil.
[01:13:30.626 --> 01:13:36.470]  As Harvard's doing, that's in the news, Harvard Kennedy School will make white privilege training mandatory for orientation.
[01:13:38.472 --> 01:13:48.938]  Janesville superintendent issues apology for kids, react to gay marriage video that shows children, the mother is young as four, saying how wonderful it is that two men are kissing each other.
[01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.980]  I mean, I played it earlier, it's so unbelievable that
[01:13:51.892 --> 01:13:53.474]  I mean, it's so creepy and cult-like.
[01:13:53.514 --> 01:14:01.182]  It's like that video we played last week with the abortion promoter, therapist, you know, lady that sells abortion going, I love it, I'll give a picture of it.
[01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.045]  It's so sweet what I'm going to do to it.
[01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:03.885]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:14:04.446 --> 01:14:06.989]  A normal person sees it and goes, this is really dark satire.
[01:14:07.369 --> 01:14:07.830]  No, it's not.
[01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:11.874]  This is when you're turned over to evil, you think it's good.
[01:14:12.762 --> 01:14:17.985]  And again, I'm not even saying people that are attracted to each other or whatever are bad.
[01:14:18.065 --> 01:14:21.507]  I'm saying the pushing this on kids is evil.
[01:14:22.127 --> 01:14:23.508]  It's the sexualization of children.
[01:14:23.528 --> 01:14:26.129]  We're going to have a bunch of articles on that in the next few days.
[01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:31.252]  And then Harvard plans mandatory power and privilege training.
[01:14:32.233 --> 01:14:32.733]  That's right.
[01:14:34.594 --> 01:14:39.557]  Meanwhile, they have secret death lists for people at the VA hospitals and they're trying to isolate it down to one place.
[01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:40.657]  It's system-wide.
[01:14:40.677 --> 01:14:41.938]  We told you about that years ago.
[01:14:45.031 --> 01:14:46.933]  This is the reality of what's going on.
[01:14:48.294 --> 01:14:51.176]  Look at this story that is out of BuzzFeed.
[01:14:51.376 --> 01:14:51.716]  Shock!
[01:14:51.836 --> 01:14:52.777]  New York Times Memo.
[01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.119]  Our journalism advantage is shrinking.
[01:14:55.139 --> 01:14:59.102]  Well, a memo came out last year where they said that they're passe now.
[01:15:02.445 --> 01:15:04.766]  They came out and said that we can't even set the agenda.
[01:15:04.806 --> 01:15:05.127]  That's right.
[01:15:05.147 --> 01:15:06.828]  They said drudge and others can.
[01:15:07.509 --> 01:15:08.950]  Yeah, Media Matters says InfoWars.
[01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:09.650]  They hate our guts.
[01:15:10.731 --> 01:15:14.014]  Times internal report painted dire digital picture.
[01:15:15.037 --> 01:15:16.577]  Our journalism advantage is shrinking.
[01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:24.699]  A committee led by the publisher Sun warned a call to get rid of the metaphor of church and state.
[01:15:30.421 --> 01:15:36.282]  And they are selling the fairness doctrine to be over internet, to be over everything.
[01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:42.533]  Time's internal report painted dire digital picture.
[01:15:43.253 --> 01:15:44.855]  Says they basically have no future.
[01:15:46.536 --> 01:15:48.718]  We're not moving with enough urgency, it says.
[01:15:50.859 --> 01:15:52.781]  The newsroom is unanimous.
[01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:55.943]  We are focusing too much time and energy on page one, the report says.
[01:16:01.267 --> 01:16:04.250]  And it just goes on to talk about how they're not going to have a future.
[01:16:04.946 --> 01:16:11.551]  Well, their answer is bring the FCC in to put regulations and controls on and to end net neutrality so they can take over.
[01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:16.635]  And that's exactly how the FCC has just voted.
[01:16:17.175 --> 01:16:18.877]  FCC has now voted.
[01:16:18.897 --> 01:16:27.243]  The Washington Post is reporting to advance the takeover of the Internet as we know it.
[01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:35.036]  FCC approves plan to consider paid priority on the internet.
[01:16:36.538 --> 01:16:38.841]  And they're also setting up the monitors of newsrooms.
[01:16:39.201 --> 01:16:41.163]  Look, I'm not having any monitor here.
[01:16:41.183 --> 01:16:47.470]  I guess they'll send the socialist monitor to come teach me sensitivity training on how I'm bad because I'm white.
[01:16:49.612 --> 01:16:51.074]  You know, I don't apologize for crap.
[01:16:52.401 --> 01:17:04.352]  I haven't done anything to anybody, and I judge people by who they are, not what color they are, and I'm sick of it, and I don't buy all your globalist propaganda to make me feel guilty, so I can roll over, so you people can carry out the takeover of humanity.
[01:17:05.052 --> 01:17:14.481]  That's why they're just promoting nothing but infighting, nothing but division, on and on and on, because that's all they've got, because it's a tiny elite, absolutely robbing all of us.
[01:17:17.776 --> 01:17:34.043]  The Federal Communications Commission today voted in favor of advancing a proposal that could dramatically reshape the way consumers experience the Internet, opening the possibility of Internet service providers sharing websites for higher quality delivery of their content to American consumers.
[01:17:36.909 --> 01:17:47.756]  The plan approved in a 3-2 vote along party lines could unleash a new economy on the web where internet service providers such as Verizon would charge a website such as Netflix for the guarantee of flawless video streaming.
[01:17:49.157 --> 01:17:52.940]  Well folks, you pay for the type of connection you have to get the video.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.882]  Plus the compression is so good now, it doesn't cost a fraction of what it did just a few years ago.
[01:17:57.463 --> 01:17:58.323]  You'll be a fraction of that.
[01:17:58.744 --> 01:18:00.505]  I've talked to all the scientists, the internet people.
[01:18:01.946 --> 01:18:07.747]  These companies have been saved by the dot-com booms and the internet and the bandwidth.
[01:18:07.827 --> 01:18:11.208]  You're paying them for what you're downloading.
[01:18:12.328 --> 01:18:13.088]  You're paying.
[01:18:15.469 --> 01:18:18.469]  In many cities there's a monopoly on broadband.
[01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:20.550]  But that's getting broken up.
[01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:23.750]  But you're paying handsomely for what you download.
[01:18:24.831 --> 01:18:29.372]  You're paying for the content of House of Cards or whatever it is you watch on Netflix.
[01:18:30.212 --> 01:18:31.192]  And then you're paying
[01:18:32.205 --> 01:18:33.546]  For the bandwidth.
[01:18:33.566 --> 01:18:34.446]  I almost said a cuss word.
[01:18:34.686 --> 01:18:36.447]  I'm really getting tired of this.
[01:18:38.608 --> 01:18:42.910]  The Internet by necessity has net neutrality or it doesn't work.
[01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:47.912]  This isn't called Internet 2 or ending net neutrality.
[01:18:47.992 --> 01:18:55.656]  It's called slitting the old Internet's throat, that's the real growing Internet, it's got its own problems, and forcing us on an Internet 2 that's a control grid.
[01:18:57.659 --> 01:19:02.642]  And I've hammered this, and I've hammered this, and I've hammered this, and even most analysts don't even get it and understand it.
[01:19:02.682 --> 01:19:03.743]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:19:05.724 --> 01:19:10.347]  And Google and Amazon act like they're against it, but when you really look, they're not fighting it very much.
[01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:17.571]  Because they're going to end up controlling so much of the grid anyways, they're going to have deals to allow all this traffic to go through.
[01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:23.915]  I mean, sometimes a hub goes down on the internet and you can't get major websites for a day or two, and that's just a routing issue.
[01:19:26.138 --> 01:19:28.360]  But they can sit there and flip switches and turn off the Internet.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:35.225]  It was designed to not be that way, but they've come in with all this hardware they've added since 96, and they've taken it over, folks.
[01:19:35.926 --> 01:19:48.055]  And one reason the Internet has problems is all the spyware and all the backdoors and the NSA stuff has been added to it, and the FBI immediately pumping in all these worms and viruses to hack into everybody's computers and then clandestinely send it back to them.
[01:19:48.596 --> 01:19:55.101]  And they got warehouses full of, you know, cyberpunks in there that work for them, so in case they get caught, they just blame it on the cyberpunks.
[01:19:57.346 --> 01:20:00.147]  I mean, that's all on record, and I'm sick of it.
[01:20:01.268 --> 01:20:02.388]  And I'm not here complaining.
[01:20:02.408 --> 01:20:07.171]  There's so much good stuff in the world, we need to expose evil and get it out of our lives.
[01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:17.956]  Like, if your daughter, when she's 16, you know, brings home some 20-year-old convict who's convicted of, you know, robbing liquor stores, you know, you tell her, look, you're not dating that guy.
[01:20:17.976 --> 01:20:18.816]  He's a piece of crud.
[01:20:19.977 --> 01:20:21.377]  You gotta put your foot down, man.
[01:20:21.397 --> 01:20:25.139]  We've been overrun by criminals and a bunch of lawyers lying for them.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:35.563]  With the globalists making more and more advances into our freedoms every day, and ruining our healthcare system, it's important to be able to take back control of our own personal healthcare.
[01:20:35.763 --> 01:20:38.644]  Colloidal Silver Water even fights against the new designer bugs.

[01:22:28.808 --> 01:22:30.569]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk.
[01:22:30.769 --> 01:22:33.670]  And his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:41.813]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:42.033 --> 01:22:46.354]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:46.554 --> 01:22:50.375]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:50.535 --> 01:22:56.217]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:56.477 --> 01:22:59.259]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[01:24:40.595 --> 01:24:42.817]  Our reporters have not been released from A.P.
[01:24:43.398 --> 01:24:44.579]  Hill, Fort A.P.
[01:24:44.619 --> 01:24:45.720]  Hill yet in Virginia.
[01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:47.702]  They're having paperwork done.
[01:24:48.543 --> 01:24:52.267]  So, uh, we'll find out what type of baloney that is.
[01:24:52.747 --> 01:24:56.291]  For daring to try to come and find out what this secret training facility is.
[01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.153]  But we got the footage, we know what it is.
[01:24:58.213 --> 01:25:01.296]  The footage has already been mailed and already received here this morning.
[01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:12.451]  So we'll have that for InfoWorks Nightly News tonight at 7 o'clock central while we do real journalistic research and then I give you my political analysis, commentary and opinion.
[01:25:13.731 --> 01:25:23.793]  And you can make of it what you want, but I think a lot of people notice that if you watch my films from 16, 17 years ago, it's like getting in a time machine.
[01:25:25.873 --> 01:25:29.194]  If you were to watch those films then, you watch it, it's pretty much all come true.
[01:25:32.117 --> 01:25:36.761]  And I think about how the things we used to cover that people were so shocked by.
[01:25:36.781 --> 01:25:39.102]  Hey, the Pentagon is developing brain chips for troops.
[01:25:39.483 --> 01:25:40.303]  Shut up, Loon!
[01:25:40.323 --> 01:25:41.604]  Now it's all over the news 10 years later.
[01:25:41.624 --> 01:25:45.867]  Oh, hey, they're going to have a, quote, anti-stress vaccine.
[01:25:45.887 --> 01:25:52.232]  They're going to want to give troubled kids that actually attacks the brain and creates microscopic lobotomies.
[01:25:52.772 --> 01:25:53.673]  Oh, shut up, Nut.
[01:25:53.733 --> 01:25:54.534]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.331]  But it's like, get the new shot and be happy!
[01:25:57.832 --> 01:26:00.016]  This is body snatcher level.
[01:26:00.557 --> 01:26:02.641]  More and more I realize it's like a science fiction movie.
[01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:28.613]  I mean, it's as weird as Edge of Tomorrow, or They Live, or The Body Snatchers, but it's our own species of weird, materialistic, psychopathic control freaks who have all the science and technology of the Renaissance, all of the stuff we've developed, and they compartmentalize it, hoard it for themselves, are creating a breakaway civilization with their own internet, their own hospitals, their own... That's how North Korea is.
[01:26:29.053 --> 01:26:30.775]  That's how Romania was under Ceausescu.
[01:26:32.318 --> 01:26:33.959]  That's how a lot of the Arab countries are.
[01:26:33.979 --> 01:26:35.660]  It's all glistening and wonderful for the elite.
[01:26:37.121 --> 01:26:39.163]  And then everybody else lives in a whole other world.
[01:26:39.823 --> 01:26:41.144]  And that's what we're going into.
[01:26:41.404 --> 01:26:45.187]  But so we don't notice all that, they just have us fight over race and stuff all day.
[01:26:45.607 --> 01:26:46.988]  It's very scientific and it works.
[01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:52.652]  And the argument is, well, does that then validate them and their social Darwinism?
[01:26:54.474 --> 01:26:56.855]  Does that say that the public deserves this?
[01:26:57.416 --> 01:27:01.779]  And that Alex, if you understand it and don't like it, your only choice is to join us.
[01:27:03.905 --> 01:27:06.727]  And that's the speech I've always been given in different ways.
[01:27:07.308 --> 01:27:09.370]  They go, look, you're not going to help these people.
[01:27:09.690 --> 01:27:11.031]  They would tear you apart.
[01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:13.933]  They're a bunch of animals and they don't understand it.
[01:27:14.374 --> 01:27:17.857]  So all you can do is try to control them and feed off of them.
[01:27:19.096 --> 01:27:27.603]  That's what the establishment thinks about you, and they sit back and they tell me that I'm a fool for not joining with them.
[01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:28.523]  Well, no.
[01:27:29.304 --> 01:27:34.328]  I know where this is all going, and I am not signed on in any way.
[01:27:35.809 --> 01:27:39.032]  My spirit, I know, is real, and I'm not attaching it to this.
[01:27:40.252 --> 01:27:44.856]  I don't care how horrible some of the general public are, and dumb, and lazy.
[01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:47.098]  They were raised up in this mind control.
[01:27:48.499 --> 01:27:50.661]  A lot of them probably aren't even what you'd call a human.
[01:27:51.221 --> 01:27:53.564]  They're just programmable things that respond to stimuli.
[01:27:53.664 --> 01:27:54.084]  I get that.
[01:27:55.325 --> 01:27:56.226]  But they could have been human.
[01:27:56.886 --> 01:27:57.747]  And they've still got a soul.
[01:27:58.908 --> 01:28:00.650]  And I'm not gonna feed on them.
[01:28:01.751 --> 01:28:05.254]  You know, a lot of these anti-human people are vegetarians and love animals.
[01:28:05.794 --> 01:28:08.677]  You know, Hitler loved his German shepherds, but hated people.
[01:28:08.697 --> 01:28:11.259]  There was this German shepherd named Blondie.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.242]  Blondie ended up getting a cyanide pill.
[01:28:17.244 --> 01:28:19.386]  But then I think about it, don't you have any empathy for humans?
[01:28:23.169 --> 01:28:24.230]  This is a predatory system.
[01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:28.594]  I'm going to go to break and come back to Jason and Juan and Holly and Michael and Mac and others.
[01:28:30.035 --> 01:28:34.178]  But before I go any further, I haven't plugged anything in the first hour and a half.
[01:28:36.841 --> 01:28:39.723]  I need your support to expand the websites, the magazine,
[01:28:41.365 --> 01:28:47.548]  News sites, the nightly news, the radio show, all the things that send our reporters to different parts of the country to investigate things like we're doing right now.
[01:28:48.708 --> 01:29:01.794]  And I appreciate all your support, but just know that we don't put a gun to your head like MSNBC through stimulus money, as I say, or NPR with tax money, or George Soros with his banker bailout money, or Warren Buffett financing all this anti-human stuff.
[01:29:02.881 --> 01:29:05.042]  There comes a time when no one's going to read their bull anymore.
[01:29:05.062 --> 01:29:06.002]  We're already pretty much there.
[01:29:06.562 --> 01:29:08.283]  That's when they're going to try to shut everything down.
[01:29:08.723 --> 01:29:10.144]  Not out of strength, but out of weakness.
[01:29:10.704 --> 01:29:15.646]  And it's important going into this maelstrom, this hurricane, that you energize real media.
[01:29:15.686 --> 01:29:19.027]  That's what we try to do, is be a platform to magnify media not as big as us.
[01:29:20.068 --> 01:29:23.229]  And to magnify stories that aren't getting attention, that we think are important.
[01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:31.693]  But we need you to support us financially with PrisonPlanet.tv, Nightly News Memberships, 1 Memberships, 11 people can use it, it's $5.95 a month.
[01:29:32.984 --> 01:29:43.254]  We need you to get the high quality water filters, lowest price out there, stainless steel gravity fed systems, the ProPure G 2.0 systems that cut off the glyphosates, the fluoride, everything.

[01:30:11.254 --> 01:30:13.635]  And thank you all for your support.
[01:30:13.895 --> 01:30:15.356]  We've built something really special here.
[01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:16.737]  We're on the march.
[01:30:16.757 --> 01:30:17.198]  Calls are coming up.
[01:30:17.398 --> 01:30:18.980]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.663]  Alex Jones and the GCN Media.
[01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:22.784]  Humanity is on the march.
[01:30:22.824 --> 01:30:24.527]  We're waking up to the psychopath technocrats.
[01:30:24.887 --> 01:30:25.488]  We see you.
[01:30:26.781 --> 01:30:30.783]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:30.823 --> 01:30:34.945]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:35.185 --> 01:30:38.587]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:38.847 --> 01:30:41.728]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:41.888 --> 01:30:49.212]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:49.472 --> 01:30:53.133]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:53.373 --> 01:30:57.635]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:57.795 --> 01:31:03.716]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:31:03.756 --> 01:31:07.538]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:31:07.698 --> 01:31:10.259]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:31:10.439 --> 01:31:11.779]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:31:11.939 --> 01:31:13.179]  It's time to take action.
[01:31:13.299 --> 01:31:14.960]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:26.903 --> 01:31:37.290]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:39.451]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:31:39.651 --> 01:31:40.332]  Fluoride!
[01:31:40.532 --> 01:31:42.113]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:42.453 --> 01:31:48.778]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:31:49.038 --> 01:31:53.801]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:31:56.983 --> 01:31:57.503]  We're good.
[01:32:26.727 --> 01:32:33.791]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:36.072]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:32:36.252 --> 01:32:41.355]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:32:41.535 --> 01:32:46.478]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:32:46.698 --> 01:32:49.760]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:53.882]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:32:54.082 --> 01:32:58.324]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:32:58.404 --> 01:33:08.450]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:11.151]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:33:11.311 --> 01:33:12.172]  We're good to go.
[01:33:38.829 --> 01:33:41.031]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:43.152]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:55.921 --> 01:34:01.085]  I see articles like this, no exaggeration, ten times a day.
[01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:06.433]  In my stack today, I've got more than ten examples.
[01:34:06.593 --> 01:34:09.416]  I know because I've had like eight or nine this morning and I see one more on drudge.
[01:34:11.497 --> 01:34:12.078]  Unbelievable.
[01:34:13.779 --> 01:34:18.784]  Witch hunt forces out skeptical climate scientists, worried about his safety.
[01:34:19.785 --> 01:34:20.305]  Daily Mail.
[01:34:21.746 --> 01:34:29.373]  I mean, I've had publications call for my arrest and Lord Monckton's arrest, and they've talked about us and said we should be arrested.
[01:34:30.896 --> 01:34:32.738]  They want to arrest us, folks.
[01:34:33.839 --> 01:34:34.980]  They want to arrest you.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.442]  They want to, oh, you like Ted Cruz?
[01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:37.563]  Well, I'll put you in a body bag.
[01:34:38.283 --> 01:34:46.171]  It is this out-of-control attitude that none of us have any basic liberty.
[01:34:49.635 --> 01:34:50.616]  It's this attitude
[01:34:52.583 --> 01:34:56.125]  That we can be shoved around because they've got the liberal moral high ground.
[01:34:56.585 --> 01:35:02.649]  And liberals, what's so disgusting about an establishment liberal, is they really have an attitude like they're God's gifts to the planet.
[01:35:04.330 --> 01:35:09.252]  And that just because they are in this group, they're elite, they're smart, you're an idiot.
[01:35:10.013 --> 01:35:21.139]  It doesn't matter how successful you are, doesn't matter how high your IQ is, doesn't matter how socially responsible you are, doesn't matter that you're a real liberal, you really want freedom, they say they're liberal,
[01:35:22.486 --> 01:35:23.886]  That's the issue is they're impostors.
[01:35:25.107 --> 01:35:30.548]  I know real hippie people growing up in Dallas and Austin, Texas that are really cool, smart, wonderful people.
[01:35:31.488 --> 01:35:34.329]  Best people you can imagine, trustworthy, good people.
[01:35:34.369 --> 01:35:37.630]  And they're liberal on social issues and stuff because they're libertarians.
[01:35:39.471 --> 01:35:40.371]  And they're not racist.
[01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:51.614]  They're the opposite of an MSNBC host who just look at all the angles politically and
[01:35:53.416 --> 01:35:55.797]  They think they can get away with basically anything.
[01:35:56.658 --> 01:36:06.383]  There was a Canadian study two years ago, we had the professor on, or professors, if I remember correctly, there were two of them, and they did a huge multi-year study of people that claim to be big environmentalists.
[01:36:06.403 --> 01:36:16.968]  Now that doesn't mean it's you, but they were six times more likely to steal, to lie, to cheat, and to not give charitable donations.
[01:36:17.688 --> 01:36:23.011]  Libertarians and conservatives, you can look this up, are the highest level of charity.
[01:36:24.653 --> 01:36:25.293]  Highest level.
[01:36:27.594 --> 01:36:34.295]  Liberal Democrats in this country and in Canada, same type group, don't give jack squat, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:36.915 --> 01:36:38.095]  Jack squat.
[01:36:38.635 --> 01:36:41.116]  And the study showed, it was a big sociology study.
[01:36:42.436 --> 01:36:43.216]  Just type it in, guys.
[01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:44.536]  Environmentalists more likely to steal.
[01:36:44.556 --> 01:36:44.997]  It'll come up.
[01:36:47.157 --> 01:36:48.317]  There's other studies that show the same thing.
[01:36:48.817 --> 01:36:49.217]  There it is.
[01:36:50.918 --> 01:36:52.618]  Conservatives more liberal givers.
[01:36:52.658 --> 01:36:53.178]  Yeah, that's in a
[01:36:55.297 --> 01:37:04.581]  Yeah, that's a George Will article, but that's not it.
[01:37:04.621 --> 01:37:05.801]  That proves what I was saying.
[01:37:07.142 --> 01:37:08.402]  That Canadian study was a few years ago.
[01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:08.942]  It was big.
[01:37:12.404 --> 01:37:14.985]  Then after the study, they asked him, why do you do this?
[01:37:16.465 --> 01:37:18.586]  Yeah, how going green may make you mean.
[01:37:19.106 --> 01:37:22.367]  Ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal, study finds.
[01:37:22.707 --> 01:37:23.368]  London Guardian.
[01:37:23.388 --> 01:37:24.228]  Yeah, yeah, that was part of it.
[01:37:26.457 --> 01:37:30.138]  It's because, folks, they don't know how to build something.
[01:37:30.218 --> 01:37:31.418]  On average, they're losers.
[01:37:32.338 --> 01:37:34.759]  They're joiners.
[01:37:34.979 --> 01:37:39.200]  They want to get in a gang or a group, and then they just parrot all day, yeah, yeah, it's for the earth.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:39.860]  Hey!
[01:37:41.321 --> 01:37:42.541]  Part of the study was Facebook.
[01:37:43.201 --> 01:37:46.582]  They would send out, give to Facebook to each other, but then no one gave.
[01:37:48.082 --> 01:37:49.823]  They would just say, give to some group to feel good.
[01:37:54.792 --> 01:37:57.775]  They're about the surface, not the reality.
[01:37:58.695 --> 01:38:04.960]  If I saw two white guys for no reason beating up a black guy or a black woman or something, I'd kick their butt.
[01:38:06.201 --> 01:38:09.224]  And if I saw a white person being attacked by two black people, I'm going to get involved.
[01:38:11.525 --> 01:38:13.267]  Because I see a person under attack.
[01:38:14.728 --> 01:38:15.789]  It was like that woman
[01:38:17.196 --> 01:38:19.498]  Who ran into the checkpoint, got scared by the army troops.
[01:38:19.538 --> 01:38:22.180]  They have martial law, just occupation in DC.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.161]  They just do it to acclimate you, rotating troops around.
[01:38:25.082 --> 01:38:27.643]  She hit a barrel, got scared, ran, had a panic attack.
[01:38:29.205 --> 01:38:31.146]  Any police training should tell you women are more apt to do that.
[01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:34.328]  Statistically, it's one of the few crimes that women engage in higher than men.
[01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.130]  Usually men engage in more crime than women.
[01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:36.750]  That's just well known.
[01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:40.713]  Other than shoplifting and running from police.
[01:38:43.422 --> 01:38:44.502]  That's basic criminology.
[01:38:44.542 --> 01:38:47.184]  She ran, and they killed her, and I got real mad about it.
[01:38:47.544 --> 01:38:50.845]  And I saw racist, because the Trayvon Martin thing was going on then.
[01:38:51.185 --> 01:38:53.266]  Everyone's race, race, race on Infowars and YouTube.
[01:38:54.246 --> 01:38:57.848]  Going, I bet he wouldn't care if it wasn't a cracker lady.
[01:38:58.728 --> 01:39:01.189]  And then, hours later, it came out, she was black.
[01:39:01.209 --> 01:39:04.591]  And it was like, thank you, Alex, for caring about a black woman.
[01:39:05.511 --> 01:39:07.812]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:11.833]  I cared about a woman getting chased down and shot.
[01:39:11.853 --> 01:39:12.954]  I didn't care what color she was.
[01:39:16.311 --> 01:39:22.933]  If I saw a French Bulldog, and I'm not comparing my Bulldog to a French Bulldog, me, what I'm saying, if I see somebody hurting an animal, I get upset about it.
[01:39:23.873 --> 01:39:25.554]  I get upset about somebody hurting a woman.
[01:39:26.414 --> 01:39:27.995]  I don't even think this is a black woman.
[01:39:32.196 --> 01:39:36.037]  When I walk up to a cashier or something, I don't care if they're white or black, do they smile at me?
[01:39:36.057 --> 01:39:36.797]  Do they say hi?
[01:39:37.658 --> 01:39:38.938]  Do they look like an interesting person?
[01:39:38.998 --> 01:39:40.638]  I don't even think about what color they are.
[01:39:41.019 --> 01:39:42.259]  I think about how do they act?
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.420]  Who are they?
[01:39:46.974 --> 01:39:47.814]  What do they like to do?
[01:39:49.035 --> 01:39:50.435]  I'll go hear anybody play music.
[01:39:50.455 --> 01:39:51.416]  I don't think about what color they are.
[01:39:51.436 --> 01:39:53.316]  I think about what are they playing?
[01:39:54.637 --> 01:39:55.617]  I'll hire anybody.
[01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:56.557]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.118]  What are you going to do to fight tyranny?
[01:39:58.338 --> 01:39:59.378]  Are you an honorable person?
[01:40:02.639 --> 01:40:07.021]  I value courage and loyalty above all the things.
[01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:10.162]  And that's what people should value out there.
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.200]  That's my view.
[01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:16.342]  I said I'd go to your phone calls, I'm going to shut up now.
[01:40:17.202 --> 01:40:19.084]  But we still haven't gotten our reporters out of there.
[01:40:22.626 --> 01:40:35.956]  And I knew when I dressed down that public affairs officer about their FEMA camp, death camp training, torture camp training facility, that it would probably even make him try to, at a subconscious level, dig something up on the reporters.
[01:40:37.797 --> 01:40:40.379]  But I still went ahead and dressed him down because I knew it was the right thing to do.
[01:40:42.008 --> 01:40:47.309]  And if they persecute our reporters at that base, we'll just make it a lawsuit, like we did with Pittsburgh and win it.
[01:40:47.329 --> 01:40:50.350]  And it's not because I'm looking for a fight.
[01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:53.311]  The New World Order came and got on top of me and my family.
[01:40:55.311 --> 01:40:57.592]  I'm tired of laying down and being run over.
[01:40:58.332 --> 01:41:02.293]  I'm tired of watching domestic armies built against me and my family and your family.
[01:41:02.993 --> 01:41:07.354]  I got empathy for you, and I know you got empathy for me, and we gotta stand together against this evil.
[01:41:08.988 --> 01:41:12.650]  You know, I used to see a bumper sticker saying, if you're not angry, you're not paying attention.
[01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:18.232]  Well, I want to have a bumper sticker that says, if you're not getting chills up and down your spine, you're not paying attention.
[01:41:20.893 --> 01:41:24.114]  I could feel the enemy intensifying.
[01:41:25.495 --> 01:41:31.157]  I could literally just in the atmosphere, like you feel the atmosphere of a crowd, feel the suffering worldwide increasing.
[01:41:32.178 --> 01:41:33.738]  That's not mumbo-jumbo, that's real.
[01:41:35.199 --> 01:41:37.240]  There's another big study come out breaking all that down.
[01:41:43.823 --> 01:41:49.606]  All these cowards that go along with the system because you're afraid of what your friends and family or neighbors think about you.
[01:41:50.166 --> 01:41:52.207]  Wait until the real evil unfolds.
[01:41:53.408 --> 01:41:54.489]  Wait until there's no hope.
[01:41:55.569 --> 01:41:56.630]  And then you'll find your courage.
[01:41:57.630 --> 01:41:58.050]  Some of you.
[01:42:02.092 --> 01:42:04.173]  Still others will lie to yourselves to the end.
[01:42:07.115 --> 01:42:08.116]  I feel sorry for you.
[01:42:12.018 --> 01:42:12.818]  Beyond dishonor.
[01:42:15.188 --> 01:42:16.749]  It's as if you never existed.
[01:42:18.389 --> 01:42:20.590]  It's as if you turned your back on all your ancestors.
[01:42:22.691 --> 01:42:24.311]  And you sold your soul to evil.
[01:42:26.792 --> 01:42:31.134]  Because you were too lazy to recognize the takeover.
[01:42:32.815 --> 01:42:36.176]  Jason in California, you're on the air, you say you're a teacher.
[01:42:37.076 --> 01:42:41.958]  What do you think of them teaching elementary students, showing them two men kissing each other?
[01:42:43.106 --> 01:42:45.726]  Well, if I say anything against that, I'd be a racist, right?
[01:42:46.947 --> 01:42:50.607]  Yeah, you've got to turn your kids over to the social police, or you're a racist.
[01:42:51.847 --> 01:42:52.428]  Oh, man.
[01:42:52.468 --> 01:42:53.968]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:42:54.008 --> 01:42:55.188]  I really appreciate what you do.
[01:42:55.208 --> 01:43:00.069]  Uh, yeah, I'm a public school teacher here in California, and don't beat up on me yet.
[01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.849]  We're not all bad.
[01:43:01.029 --> 01:43:01.489]  I know you're not.
[01:43:01.529 --> 01:43:05.550]  But, um... I teach social studies at the high school level.
[01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:12.531]  And, um, I kind of came across something that you talked about a little bit, the problems with Common Core coming up, actually, you know?
[01:43:13.411 --> 01:43:19.058]  And there was something, kind of a small picture and a big picture problem that came out of a meeting I was just in on Friday.
[01:43:19.098 --> 01:43:20.259]  I thought I should let you know.
[01:43:21.621 --> 01:43:34.095]  I was sitting through a department meeting in which the state standards, the previous state standards of what we're supposed to teach our students is being compared and gutted by the new Common Core standards.
[01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:43.151]  Yeah, and again, once they're able to set federal, global, UN, UNESCO standards, then they can do anything they want, and then you can't create your own lesson plans.
[01:43:43.431 --> 01:43:44.171]  It's checkmate.
[01:43:44.491 --> 01:43:45.912]  We now have global education.
[01:43:46.893 --> 01:43:47.333]  Exactly.
[01:43:47.373 --> 01:43:55.699]  And not that the old standards were perfect, but compared to what they're getting into, it's like a Harvard education compared to what they're going to get into.
[01:43:55.779 --> 01:43:56.239]  Exactly.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.961]  Now, this is where it gets real scary, though.
[01:43:59.645 --> 01:44:11.154]  You know, they kind of, they had a list of all the standards from what we used to teach and they gave them all a grade as to their usefulness or their importance as to what, if we should teach them or not in the future.
[01:44:11.735 --> 01:44:14.737]  Different topics, like should we teach... Yeah, let's be honest about what Common Core is.
[01:44:14.857 --> 01:44:16.919]  It's your real college education now.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:24.585]  They're overriding the old brainwashing and it's continued education to tell you the new way to dumb your kids down.
[01:44:24.605 --> 01:44:24.865]  Go ahead.
[01:44:25.754 --> 01:44:27.816]  Okay, so that's the small picture, yes.
[01:44:27.996 --> 01:44:31.679]  Definitely, it's an obvious effect that's going to dumb down our education.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.522]  But here's the scary part, the big picture.
[01:44:35.242 --> 01:44:39.226]  I'm sitting through this meeting, and we're looking through the different topics in their grades.
[01:44:39.864 --> 01:44:51.673]  And I find out that the American Revolution and all the Constitution stuff has been deemed unnecessary and it's been removed from our United States history class syllabuses.
[01:44:51.713 --> 01:44:53.695]  What you do is you scan that and you send it.
[01:44:53.735 --> 01:44:56.357]  We won't get you in trouble because we know there's secret police everywhere.
[01:44:56.937 --> 01:44:58.178]  You send that to us.
[01:44:58.258 --> 01:44:59.358]  We make a big story out of it.
[01:44:59.378 --> 01:45:00.659]  It goes up on Drudge.
[01:45:00.719 --> 01:45:01.959]  It gets picked up by the news.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.160]  We keep hammering it and exposing it.
[01:45:04.701 --> 01:45:05.581]  That is so huge.
[01:45:05.661 --> 01:45:08.783]  So Teacher blows the whistle.
[01:45:09.763 --> 01:45:10.544]  Common Core.
[01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:12.044]  Can you get us a scan of that?
[01:45:12.384 --> 01:45:19.968]  Yeah, I don't mean to cut you off, but what better way for the globalists to destroy our rights and our Constitution than by just simply removing it from our education system?
[01:45:20.508 --> 01:45:20.828]  Yeah, that's 1984.
[01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:25.971]  So describe what it said to us, A, and B, can you scan it and send it over?
[01:45:27.085 --> 01:45:29.066]  Yeah, I can scan it for you.
[01:45:29.486 --> 01:45:39.312]  It simply has all the different topics, and it says American Revolution and Constitution, you know, and things next to like other topics have A++, you know, the different religions.
[01:45:39.352 --> 01:45:43.874]  Of course, they're pushing different religion stuff instead of... Yeah, teach five-year-olds how to give a blowjob.
[01:45:43.914 --> 01:45:45.175]  That's probably A++.
[01:45:46.076 --> 01:45:55.881]  So, you know, I've already been through this, and I kind of do my own personal thing anyway, but the way they do it, like you say, if I don't do the test they want us to give, then I can get in trouble.
[01:45:56.696 --> 01:45:57.637]  I have to give the test.
[01:45:57.697 --> 01:45:58.938]  I have to teach what they say.
[01:45:59.398 --> 01:46:07.225]  And so basically, in our United States history classes, in the United States of America, they're not going to be taught the American Revolution and the Constitution.
[01:46:07.645 --> 01:46:09.186]  I just could not believe that.
[01:46:09.226 --> 01:46:11.328]  That is so blatantly true.
[01:46:11.488 --> 01:46:13.029]  Actually, we've gotten Common Core stuff.
[01:46:13.049 --> 01:46:17.673]  It's become national news a few months ago where it said the Constitution isn't for everybody.
[01:46:17.733 --> 01:46:18.554]  It's group rights.
[01:46:19.094 --> 01:46:22.056]  So I know they're going in that direction, but that is sensational.
[01:46:22.677 --> 01:46:23.778]  That will really expose them.
[01:46:25.802 --> 01:46:26.583]  We're good to go.
[01:46:42.699 --> 01:46:44.320]  I just asked John Harmon running the show.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:47.621]  I said, is that too much what I just said they're teaching five-year-olds?
[01:46:47.661 --> 01:46:48.801]  He said, no, it's reality.
[01:46:49.101 --> 01:46:50.262]  This isn't a racy show.
[01:46:50.282 --> 01:46:53.183]  I don't want to get up here and talk about sex stuff on air.
[01:46:53.803 --> 01:46:54.103]  Okay?
[01:46:54.123 --> 01:46:57.424]  Because I'm a conservative person when it comes to that stuff and I respect people.
[01:46:57.905 --> 01:47:01.246]  You know, I don't, you know, run around kissing my wife in public or whatever.
[01:47:01.906 --> 01:47:06.807]  But they're teaching five-year-olds this, so on an adult show, I should be telling you!
[01:47:06.827 --> 01:47:09.868]  Because if it's shocking here, well, why is it okay for the kids?
[01:47:09.888 --> 01:47:11.688]  You know, and I was telling Kit Daniels about this.
[01:47:11.728 --> 01:47:12.209]  He goes, yeah, I know.
[01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:19.130]  He goes, it's Brave New World, Alex, which Huxley said was a real plan in his book, Brave New World Revisited, that he wrote in 1960.
[01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:25.292]  He said, the real plan is to sexualize kids by age five, have them be adults by age 10, and dead by 20.
[01:47:26.513 --> 01:47:27.653]  And people go, that sounds crazy.
[01:47:27.713 --> 01:47:29.374]  No, they're going to do that with the chemicals.
[01:47:29.774 --> 01:47:32.235]  And that doesn't mean they'll get away with it, but they're nuts!
[01:47:32.695 --> 01:47:36.656]  The globalists are flaming lunatics, is what I'm getting at.
[01:47:36.676 --> 01:47:37.876]  Now there it is.
[01:47:37.916 --> 01:47:41.677]  We need to teach sex education to kindergarten classrooms, town hall.
[01:47:42.117 --> 01:47:43.838]  But what is the sex education?
[01:47:44.707 --> 01:47:47.469]  Well, here's how the man has sex with the other man.
[01:47:47.989 --> 01:47:51.711]  I don't want them teaching kids how to have sex with women.
[01:47:51.852 --> 01:47:54.433]  I mean, it don't sexualize our children.
[01:47:54.893 --> 01:48:00.077]  Going back, what else was in this curriculum that you're going to send us?
[01:48:00.097 --> 01:48:03.199]  Well, it's everything about, you know, just world and U.S.
[01:48:03.239 --> 01:48:09.923]  history, but the main thing I could not believe is they are getting rid of Constitution and U.S.
[01:48:10.003 --> 01:48:12.064]  revolutionary history in a U.S.
[01:48:12.104 --> 01:48:12.785]  history class.
[01:48:13.573 --> 01:48:14.394]  So in a U.S.
[01:48:14.434 --> 01:48:19.937]  history class, I mean obviously you should be able to talk about this as a teacher, it's your First Amendment, but you might get in trouble.
[01:48:20.338 --> 01:48:22.919]  You want to say what school district you're in or the general area of California?
[01:48:24.981 --> 01:48:26.442]  I'll say Central California.
[01:48:27.743 --> 01:48:29.003]  I don't want to get too specific.
[01:48:29.043 --> 01:48:31.945]  I don't know how much trouble I can get into or whatever.
[01:48:32.045 --> 01:48:35.308]  Well, you know, we're all going to get in trouble if we don't speak out, but I appreciate you even doing this.
[01:48:35.988 --> 01:48:37.069]  When are you going to send me the scan?
[01:48:37.819 --> 01:48:40.981]  Yeah, I wanted to add that it's showtipsatinfowars.com.
[01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:42.142]  Is that what you said?
[01:48:42.222 --> 01:48:44.584]  Showtipsatinfowars.com.
[01:48:45.004 --> 01:48:47.386]  CC it to ridersatinfowars.com.
[01:48:48.547 --> 01:48:51.529]  I mean, just please, when are you going to send it to us?
[01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:53.731]  I'll try to do it today or tomorrow.
[01:48:54.741 --> 01:48:58.203]  All right, and listen, I really need you to do that.
[01:48:58.223 --> 01:49:00.004]  I need everybody to send me what they've got.
[01:49:00.404 --> 01:49:01.825]  We rely on the tips.
[01:49:01.925 --> 01:49:04.626]  If you've sent us something big that we don't get it again, send it again.
[01:49:04.646 --> 01:49:06.828]  We've got great writers, but we don't have the money.
[01:49:06.848 --> 01:49:07.648]  We should have 10 people.
[01:49:07.688 --> 01:49:08.268]  We don't have the money.
[01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.950]  We need more writers, more researchers, more analysts.
[01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:11.570]  God bless you.
[01:49:12.771 --> 01:49:17.513]  Anything else in there that was weird that, I mean, American history, Constitution gone.
[01:49:18.714 --> 01:49:22.056]  I'd love to contrast it to next to, you know, what they said was important.
[01:49:22.076 --> 01:49:24.097]  Let me guess, that white people are racist or something.
[01:49:25.717 --> 01:49:27.278]  Yeah, of course.
[01:49:27.318 --> 01:49:29.780]  We're all racist and we're all destroying the earth.
[01:49:30.621 --> 01:49:30.881]  Right?
[01:49:32.522 --> 01:49:36.725]  Well listen, send over the whole curriculum because we call it the California, you know, case show of the world.
[01:49:36.786 --> 01:49:37.906]  No, it's the UN.
[01:49:37.926 --> 01:49:42.970]  It is UNESCO that sets those standards under treaty, but we never ratified the treaty.
[01:49:44.572 --> 01:49:46.573]  So, it's literal agenda 21.
[01:49:47.554 --> 01:49:55.540]  Because, yes, and exactly because of the diversity of California, this is their, you know, their test subject.
[01:49:56.277 --> 01:50:01.701]  They're working California to see, you know, how this system will work for everywhere else.
[01:50:02.342 --> 01:50:03.363]  Nation and worldwide.
[01:50:03.483 --> 01:50:04.063]  Oh, they're doing it.
[01:50:04.083 --> 01:50:05.004]  They're doing it all over.
[01:50:05.264 --> 01:50:06.045]  Great point, sir.
[01:50:06.706 --> 01:50:07.426]  I got your promise.
[01:50:07.446 --> 01:50:08.027]  You're going to send that.
[01:50:08.999 --> 01:50:09.599]  Alright, I will.
[01:50:09.719 --> 01:50:10.820]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.941]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:50:12.121 --> 01:50:12.441]  Thank you.
[01:50:12.461 --> 01:50:13.442]  You know, thank you, sir.
[01:50:13.562 --> 01:50:16.163]  I should stress, send us the intel.
[01:50:16.523 --> 01:50:17.484]  Send it, send it, send it.
[01:50:17.524 --> 01:50:23.127]  Say, I don't want my name and the town, or I do, but give us some background so we can vet it and make phone calls.
[01:50:23.808 --> 01:50:29.331]  Send it, send it, send it, send it, send it, send it, send it, send it, send it, send it.
[01:50:30.912 --> 01:50:37.176]  We exposed the clergy response teams three years before it was in the news, where they have literally
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.160]  Tens of thousands of preachers then.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:41.461]  It's much bigger now.
[01:50:41.641 --> 01:50:43.261]  On federal payroll, spying on everybody.
[01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:45.522]  People didn't believe it at the time.
[01:50:45.562 --> 01:50:46.382]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:50:47.122 --> 01:50:47.982]  I mean, this is treason.
[01:50:48.002 --> 01:50:51.843]  We're gonna go to break, come back with Holly, Juan, Michael, and Mac.
[01:50:51.863 --> 01:50:52.944]  I'll go to your calls quicker now.
[01:50:53.684 --> 01:50:54.544]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:50:54.584 --> 01:50:57.305]  It's just that that is so incredible.
[01:51:01.346 --> 01:51:06.387]  It is just so mind-blowing to see all of this unfolding.
[01:51:09.236 --> 01:51:12.617]  And now they're firing TV hosts if they're secretly Christian.
[01:51:14.118 --> 01:51:14.958]  Hit TV shows.
[01:51:15.038 --> 01:51:15.938]  We covered that last week.
[01:51:16.338 --> 01:51:18.319]  Oh, we found out you go to church and are conservative.
[01:51:18.339 --> 01:51:18.899]  You're fired.
[01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.720]  I mean, it's just literal takeover.
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:24.321]  They're making their move right now.

[01:53:25.734 --> 01:53:29.716]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:53:29.756 --> 01:53:33.837]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:53:33.977 --> 01:53:37.459]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:53:37.699 --> 01:53:40.560]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:48.023]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:53:48.223 --> 01:53:51.825]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:53:52.045 --> 01:53:56.346]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:53:56.506 --> 01:54:02.368]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:54:02.428 --> 01:54:06.169]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:54:06.329 --> 01:54:08.850]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:10.390]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:54:10.530 --> 01:54:11.750]  It's time to take action.
[01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:13.611]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:54:43.801 --> 01:54:46.962]  There might be enough time to turn this country and this world around, folks.
[01:54:49.603 --> 01:54:51.563]  We'll take calls this segment and the next.
[01:54:51.643 --> 01:54:57.405]  John Rappaport is in the middle of the big fires that are in Southern California, San Diego area.
[01:54:57.885 --> 01:55:06.688]  Almost every time this happens, it's either lightning or it's people setting fires in wealthy areas to harass people or just pyromaniacs.
[01:55:08.425 --> 01:55:13.546]  And it's very, very fitting that California is just besieged by every form of evil you can imagine.
[01:55:13.566 --> 01:55:16.867]  He's going to be joining us to talk about a host of issues.
[01:55:17.927 --> 01:55:19.668]  John Rappaport, always informative.
[01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:22.888]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:55:22.928 --> 01:55:24.689]  Let's talk to Holly in Tennessee.
[01:55:24.729 --> 01:55:25.389]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:25.409 --> 01:55:25.789]  Go ahead.
[01:55:27.329 --> 01:55:27.909]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:29.430]  It's such a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:32.751]  I've been listening to you for seven years.
[01:55:32.931 --> 01:55:34.311]  I am calling about
[01:55:34.901 --> 01:55:39.005]  A couple of issues I've had with the public schools, my son in Arizona.
[01:55:41.607 --> 01:55:51.075]  The first one, he was in middle school and he was involved in a skit with an assigned group and one of the boys did something that one of the girls considered inappropriate.
[01:55:51.596 --> 01:55:57.220]  So they took my son to the office along with the other boy because he was the only other boy in the group.
[01:55:58.201 --> 01:56:02.265]  So then I receive a message from the vice principal of a school not to panic that there
[01:56:03.115 --> 01:56:07.477]  An issue, but it has been that my son has been found innocent and he's a good kid.
[01:56:09.058 --> 01:56:17.042]  So then I talked to my son and find out later that he was taken up to the office, his backpack taken away from him, everything taken away from him.
[01:56:17.442 --> 01:56:22.684]  He was seated in a glass room by himself where he was made to wait to see the vice principal.
[01:56:24.926 --> 01:56:29.608]  So I called the vice principal and he assured me that my son is a good person and not in trouble.
[01:56:30.785 --> 01:56:32.126]  I don't need you to tell me that.
[01:56:32.727 --> 01:56:33.167]  I know that.
[01:56:33.588 --> 01:56:42.516]  What I want to know is why he was treated like a prisoner who was given interrogation and put into a room and taken everything away from him when he was in sixth grade.
[01:56:43.397 --> 01:56:49.702]  The vice principal got defensive and told me that he had more power and control over his students than the police or the sheriff's department.
[01:56:52.545 --> 01:56:56.389]  So my husband called the Arizona Sheriff's Department and they were really nice but they
[01:56:57.250 --> 01:56:59.092]  Him, that that was pretty much correct.
[01:56:59.112 --> 01:57:01.073]  The school had more authority than they did.
[01:57:01.113 --> 01:57:06.477]  Well, look, because schools now claim in courts they are the parent when they have the children.
[01:57:06.598 --> 01:57:09.520]  And they've been winning some of the cases, losing some of the others.
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:14.424]  But shaking hands or hugging is, you can get charged with trying to rape somebody now.
[01:57:14.944 --> 01:57:20.729]  But then if they want to teach kids how to do incredible, you know, damaging things to their bodies, that's okay.
[01:57:20.749 --> 01:57:22.410]  I mean, this is in schools around the country.
[01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:23.831]  Remember this broke a few weeks ago?
[01:57:24.192 --> 01:57:26.233]  How do people express their sexual feelings?
[01:57:27.094 --> 01:57:29.056]  And then it goes into all of it.
[01:57:29.096 --> 01:57:35.502]  Masturbation, sexual vanity, oral sex, anal sex, cuddling on the couch.
[01:57:35.522 --> 01:57:36.923]  I mean, I remember this article a few weeks ago.
[01:57:36.943 --> 01:57:37.544]  We'll pull it up.
[01:57:37.924 --> 01:57:38.905]  I forget how young they were.
[01:57:38.925 --> 01:57:43.749]  There was father outrage over poster listings, sex acts in middle school classroom.
[01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.551]  And this is what they teach.
[01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:49.174]  And look, it's out of control.
[01:57:51.567 --> 01:57:52.948]  Yeah, and it's the breakdown of society.
[01:57:53.329 --> 01:57:55.150]  Some of the schools are really dangerous.
[01:57:55.771 --> 01:58:04.058]  There are some people that are in 6th grade that have flunked three times, that, you know, should really be in the 9th grade, and so they're scared of them and they stick them in those classrooms.
[01:58:04.458 --> 01:58:08.722]  But why are your kids then having to be around that and then they're treated bad for something?
[01:58:08.762 --> 01:58:10.343]  And girls are taught especially now,
[01:58:11.224 --> 01:58:15.146]  You know, to claim someone did something to them, because, you know, white's bad, being male's bad.
[01:58:15.706 --> 01:58:17.727]  There's a lot of things, but I appreciate your call.
[01:58:17.767 --> 01:58:18.488]  Interesting story.
[01:58:19.408 --> 01:58:21.009]  Let's talk to Mack in Montana.
[01:58:21.049 --> 01:58:21.869]  Mack, you're on the air.
[01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:24.871]  Alex!
[01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:25.331]  Hey!
[01:58:25.411 --> 01:58:26.511]  Love the show!
[01:58:26.832 --> 01:58:27.332]  Thank you, go ahead.
[01:58:29.113 --> 01:58:39.918]  Yeah, about this gate thing, you know, I'm just reminded of people I'd see out on the street or in bars, you know, where they're kissing and
[01:58:40.871 --> 01:58:42.412]  You know, they're trying to shock you.
[01:58:42.893 --> 01:58:44.895]  And, you know, I have nothing against gay people.
[01:58:44.955 --> 01:58:45.695]  God bless them.
[01:58:45.755 --> 01:58:47.237]  Let them do whatever they want.
[01:58:47.677 --> 01:58:54.143]  But, I mean, there is, at least by a certain group of them that are driving the agenda, this need to dominate and get in your face, you know?
[01:58:55.084 --> 01:58:58.607]  And they're also getting a sexual thrill from doing that in your face.
[01:58:58.787 --> 01:59:02.911]  Yeah, they probably came from real repressed families where they got beaten.
[01:59:02.931 --> 01:59:03.772]  Stay there.
[01:59:03.792 --> 01:59:05.053]  I'm going to come back and explain it.
[01:59:07.836 --> 01:59:09.180]  See, it's naughty for them.
[01:59:09.261 --> 01:59:10.424]  See, you're not repressed.
[01:59:11.086 --> 01:59:11.648]  They are.
[01:59:11.889 --> 01:59:15.058]  They want to force it on you because that's how they get a thrill.
[01:59:16.647 --> 01:59:25.653]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:59:25.733 --> 01:59:33.979]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:34.139 --> 01:59:38.823]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:39.023 --> 01:59:42.405]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:59:43.766 --> 01:59:44.686]  We're good to go.
[02:00:08.131 --> 02:00:13.996]  Be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:21.502]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:21.982 --> 02:00:24.765]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:31.448 --> 02:00:35.610]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:37.091]  You want answers?
[02:00:37.851 --> 02:00:38.751]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:39.412 --> 02:00:43.054]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:43.594 --> 02:00:47.656]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:57.014 --> 02:00:58.796]  Alright, Mac was calling from Montana.
[02:00:58.816 --> 02:00:59.517]  Go ahead, Mac.
[02:01:00.158 --> 02:01:01.339]  Yeah, this one frustrates me.
[02:01:01.419 --> 02:01:05.224]  I'm not even thinking about these groups, obsessing on it, don't dislike anybody.
[02:01:05.665 --> 02:01:11.332]  I'm just sick of not being able to put children's shows on, and not have them indoctrinated, to have it going on in the schools, the whole culture.
[02:01:11.372 --> 02:01:11.893]  It's obvious!
[02:01:12.782 --> 02:01:21.590]  That it's like a really aggressive, you know, group, like, who keeps coming to my door trying to make me buy carpets or something, or magazine subscriptions.
[02:01:22.351 --> 02:01:32.761]  I mean, it's just the grandstanding, revolutionary... Like, I'm a Christian, but sometimes it's obnoxious when there's a street preacher screaming at people and being obnoxious, turning people against it.
[02:01:33.482 --> 02:01:34.683]  And you're just kind of like, shut up.
[02:01:35.799 --> 02:01:38.260]  But you got your First Amendment, so okay, but it's still annoying.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:41.341]  It'd be like every day, everywhere you go, there's street preachers and you're being yelled at.
[02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:43.801]  I mean, that's really how I describe it.
[02:01:43.841 --> 02:01:44.882]  We should do a skit like that.
[02:01:46.162 --> 02:01:49.083]  What, you don't want us to teach your five-year-olds with two guys kissing?
[02:01:49.543 --> 02:01:50.563]  What, you don't like me?
[02:01:50.623 --> 02:01:51.904]  Well, okay, I don't like you!
[02:01:53.484 --> 02:01:55.305]  You know, get away from my kids, you perv!
[02:01:58.745 --> 02:01:59.286]  I've had enough.
[02:01:59.386 --> 02:02:00.926]  I mean, is that what you're describing here, Mac?
[02:02:01.946 --> 02:02:02.727]  Oh, it's crazy.
[02:02:03.047 --> 02:02:03.887]  It's unbelievable.
[02:02:04.491 --> 02:02:16.035]  You know, I can't help but think these social engineers are getting a big sexual turn-on from, you know, putting this in little kids' faces, you know.
[02:02:16.335 --> 02:02:21.076]  Well, the globalists think we're all animals, and they say even if they kill children in experiments, it's okay.
[02:02:21.096 --> 02:02:22.837]  Yeah, but it's for research, see?
[02:02:23.217 --> 02:02:24.738]  So they're into killing people.
[02:02:25.238 --> 02:02:28.479]  And so it's funny to just, you know, try to screw up little kids.
[02:02:30.117 --> 02:02:39.639]  They've been writing about it for a long time and you know unfortunately most people aren't wised up to it and it's going to take something really big I think.
[02:02:39.659 --> 02:02:45.461]  Well yeah most people have hospitality and want to be nice and do just judge people by who they are.
[02:02:46.321 --> 02:02:48.922]  But you understand there's a whole agenda connected on to it.
[02:02:49.816 --> 02:02:52.478]  And again, people like Camille Pagli have exposed that.
[02:02:54.699 --> 02:02:55.380]  I'm just sick of it.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.200]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:59.322]  I mean, it's just not the total culture.
[02:02:59.402 --> 02:03:00.863]  It's not the dominant culture.
[02:03:02.584 --> 02:03:05.786]  Most people that are gay aren't that culture they're pushing anyways.
[02:03:05.846 --> 02:03:10.409]  I mean, it is just a total, complete agenda attached to it.
[02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.830]  And it's bad.
[02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:15.911]  And it's not bad because I'm judging the people or I hate them.
[02:03:16.011 --> 02:03:18.411]  It's bad because the system is pushing it.
[02:03:18.671 --> 02:03:21.452]  And everything the system pushes is 200 proof poison.
[02:03:22.812 --> 02:03:25.113]  Michael in Minnesota, you're on the air, thanks for calling.
[02:03:26.553 --> 02:03:27.193]  Michigan, go ahead.
[02:03:27.213 --> 02:03:28.674]  Actually, Alex?
[02:03:28.954 --> 02:03:30.014]  Yeah, I know you're in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:03:30.034 --> 02:03:31.994]  Yep, yep, sorry.
[02:03:32.495 --> 02:03:33.475]  Where do you begin?
[02:03:33.675 --> 02:03:35.995]  I got a couple things.
[02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:41.977]  First thing, three years ago I had a friend tell me who I thought was a conspiracy theorist.
[02:03:42.824 --> 02:03:51.315]  I thought he was kind of off the wall, but he gave me the video, Obama Deception, and I've been listening to it ever since.
[02:03:51.455 --> 02:04:00.067]  All I've got to say to new listeners, if they're listening, just open your mind and eyes and it's all true.
[02:04:01.857 --> 02:04:05.540]  Well, unfortunately, when we say it's all true, almost everything we cover here is accurate.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.440]  We make mistakes sometimes.
[02:04:06.961 --> 02:04:10.704]  But the only way we're really wrong is that we don't state how bad it really is.
[02:04:11.504 --> 02:04:12.905]  So it's really not all true.
[02:04:12.985 --> 02:04:24.014]  It's actually, this show is just filled with unintentional lies because we just can't fathom the whole compendium of weirdness and evil.
[02:04:24.034 --> 02:04:24.674]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:04:24.694 --> 02:04:25.835]  Sure.
[02:04:27.006 --> 02:04:32.410]  And one other point I was originally calling about is about FEMA camps.
[02:04:32.851 --> 02:04:44.500]  I know I have a friend who works at a hospital here in Michigan and they're sending one person from each of their departments to a FEMA camp in Georgia for training.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:51.465]  He has no idea what that was for or what they're going to train about but they're sending them to a FEMA camp in Georgia.
[02:04:51.485 --> 02:04:54.788]  Now they're federalizing basically everything.
[02:04:55.874 --> 02:04:57.915]  Everything not nailed down is being federalized.
[02:04:58.755 --> 02:05:01.636]  And they just get them in these meetings to create dossiers on them.
[02:05:02.276 --> 02:05:03.837]  And to see who will play ball.
[02:05:04.417 --> 02:05:09.399]  Like I said, about three years ago, my dad got approached by Homeland Security to spy on his patients.
[02:05:10.059 --> 02:05:11.880]  And my dad meant, you mean they're talking about terrorism?
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:12.360]  They go, no.
[02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:14.741]  So my dad goes, well, I would call the police anyways.
[02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:15.741]  I don't need to be part of your group.
[02:05:16.061 --> 02:05:17.001]  Somebody talks about terrorism.
[02:05:17.361 --> 02:05:17.902]  They go, no, no, no.
[02:05:17.942 --> 02:05:19.182]  Just what they politically are up to.
[02:05:19.622 --> 02:05:22.983]  And then he asked all the dentists he knew, and pretty much all of them had gotten the same visit.
[02:05:23.323 --> 02:05:24.504]  I mean, they're taking over, folks.
[02:05:29.639 --> 02:05:31.540]  Realize how fake it all is.
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:32.281]  The football.
[02:05:32.321 --> 02:05:33.201]  The basketball.

[02:05:34.482 --> 02:05:34.783]  Alert.

[02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:46.731]  Prime Directive.
[02:05:46.851 --> 02:05:48.292]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:05:48.412 --> 02:05:51.234]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:05:51.314 --> 02:05:54.436]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:05:54.696 --> 02:05:58.397]  I don't know what he is, except a conspiracy theorist.
[02:05:58.457 --> 02:06:00.878]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:01.378 --> 02:06:03.079]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:03.359 --> 02:06:07.320]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:06:22.244 --> 02:06:23.150]  I'll kill that surely!
[02:06:23.210 --> 02:06:24.519]  It's for good, you can feel it!
[02:06:26.488 --> 02:06:30.490]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:30.530 --> 02:06:34.652]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:34.892 --> 02:06:38.294]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:38.554 --> 02:06:41.435]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:41.595 --> 02:06:48.959]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:49.159 --> 02:06:52.801]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:53.021 --> 02:06:57.322]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:57.502 --> 02:07:03.424]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:03.464 --> 02:07:07.245]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:07:07.405 --> 02:07:09.946]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:07:10.126 --> 02:07:11.487]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:11.627 --> 02:07:12.867]  It's time to take action.
[02:07:13.007 --> 02:07:14.708]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:35.016 --> 02:08:36.117]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:36.778 --> 02:08:37.579]  You want answers?
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:39.261]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:39.902 --> 02:08:43.527]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:44.107 --> 02:08:48.173]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:49.628 --> 02:08:50.749]  Let's make this a year of action.
[02:08:51.069 --> 02:08:52.270]  That's what most Americans want.
[02:08:52.530 --> 02:08:54.952]  Raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt.
[02:08:55.232 --> 02:08:57.154]  Nobody is listening to your cell phone calls.
[02:08:57.294 --> 02:08:58.335]  The debate is settled.
[02:08:58.635 --> 02:08:59.996]  Climate change is a fact.
[02:09:00.036 --> 02:09:08.422]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges, then we're going to have some problems.
[02:09:08.482 --> 02:09:11.345]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:09:23.103 --> 02:09:23.504]  Obama!
[02:09:23.604 --> 02:09:23.924]  Obama!
[02:09:23.964 --> 02:09:24.305]  Obama!
[02:09:24.625 --> 02:09:25.046]  Obama!
[02:09:46.454 --> 02:09:48.175]  We got to play this music when that lady jumps cut.
[02:09:48.595 --> 02:09:49.996]  I loved killing my baby.
[02:09:50.036 --> 02:09:50.976]  I keep a picture of it.
[02:09:51.477 --> 02:09:53.157]  The abortion was like giving birth.
[02:09:54.118 --> 02:09:56.159]  It was so wonderful.
[02:09:56.979 --> 02:10:00.621]  Oh, everyone needs to get it.
[02:10:00.741 --> 02:10:04.463]  And then we cut to the video of four-year-old kids going, I love two men kissing.
[02:10:04.703 --> 02:10:06.584]  I like them to show it to me at school.
[02:10:07.044 --> 02:10:07.845]  It's normal.
[02:10:08.965 --> 02:10:12.347]  I like the fluoride in the water.
[02:10:12.447 --> 02:10:14.108]  I like the government funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:15.822 --> 02:10:18.424]  I like the dropping IQs and cancer exploding.
[02:10:19.465 --> 02:10:25.451]  I like the banker bailouts and the fact that all the big corporations are becoming exempt from the taxes they're lobbying for on us.
[02:10:25.931 --> 02:10:29.394]  I love the fact they're shutting down our power plants and the power prices are doubling.
[02:10:29.895 --> 02:10:34.259]  I love the fact the government's arming with machine guns in every agency and billions of bullets.
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:40.104]  I like the fact arsonists are running around all over Southern California burning down everything.
[02:10:50.647 --> 02:10:54.548]  So stupid.
[02:10:54.768 --> 02:11:00.890]  Oh my gosh.
[02:11:04.851 --> 02:11:07.411]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:07.491 --> 02:11:08.371]  Everything is awesome.
[02:11:08.391 --> 02:11:10.952]  We just download the official program and believe whatever we're told.
[02:11:12.012 --> 02:11:13.713]  Like when False of Doom says, come to me.
[02:11:14.133 --> 02:11:14.953]  Come to me, my child.
[02:11:14.973 --> 02:11:15.973]  She's like five floors up.
[02:11:16.773 --> 02:11:19.174]  She just jumps off and falls into the concrete below.
[02:11:20.353 --> 02:11:22.095]  Steel isn't strong, boy.
[02:11:22.435 --> 02:11:23.596]  Flesh is strong.
[02:11:24.757 --> 02:11:27.099]  Well, the flesh isn't strong if you don't have a brain to control it.
[02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:31.503]  The Rittle of Steel.
[02:11:31.523 --> 02:11:37.007]  Oh my gosh, what a world we live in.
[02:11:37.508 --> 02:11:39.790]  And you know, there is an investigative reporter.
[02:11:39.810 --> 02:11:41.952]  He's joining us.
[02:11:43.723 --> 02:11:49.789]  Who has done a lot of important work over the years and I always enjoy having him on, even though it can be painful at times to hear what's happening.
[02:11:49.809 --> 02:11:58.436]  And we'll go to your calls at the bottom of the hour on the whole brainwashing in the schools for Martin and Chris and Chad and Will and everybody else that's holding.
[02:11:58.797 --> 02:12:02.560]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:09.366]  But John Rapoport is a graduate of Amherst College in philosophy and has worked as an investigative reporter for 30 years.
[02:12:10.427 --> 02:12:11.787]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:12:12.228 --> 02:12:18.790]  He's also a best-selling author and he's hosted and produced a lot of radio and TV programs nationally.
[02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:29.673]  And he joins us right now to break down an article that he wrote today that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:12:30.154 --> 02:12:30.554]  Alert!
[02:12:30.614 --> 02:12:33.535]  Imperial Psychiatric Empire is invading the mind.
[02:12:34.235 --> 02:12:35.857]  Yeah, that's to put it lightly.
[02:12:36.597 --> 02:12:42.042]  But before we go any further, you, I'm told, will stay on with us as long as your house doesn't burn down.
[02:12:42.062 --> 02:12:47.367]  And then I'm told the smoke is swirling around outside your art studio there, John.
[02:12:48.348 --> 02:12:57.496]  But give us a report on that, because they always run around saying they have no idea why there's fires everywhere, and it always turns out it's crazy arsonists.
[02:12:58.317 --> 02:13:01.759]  But I guess government doesn't want to admit they're not all powerful, so they just try to ignore it.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:07.403]  Even though this is a bigger threat than terrorism, the yearly burning sprees that go on.
[02:13:07.423 --> 02:13:09.905]  I guess Big Brother can't protect us from that, huh John?
[02:13:10.985 --> 02:13:11.866]  No way, Alex.
[02:13:11.986 --> 02:13:15.869]  I'm sitting here in the middle of it, in San Diego.
[02:13:16.409 --> 02:13:19.751]  Fires got within a half mile of my wife's office yesterday.
[02:13:19.771 --> 02:13:24.855]  And we got a fire a couple miles to the north of us here in Carlsbad.
[02:13:25.015 --> 02:13:26.476]  Roads were cut off yesterday.
[02:13:27.691 --> 02:13:32.356]  So I'm watching all the news reports to see whether we need to get out or not.
[02:13:33.237 --> 02:13:42.186]  And it was a full day before I even saw something at the crawl at the bottom of the screen that said, you know, investigating fires.
[02:13:43.367 --> 02:13:45.569]  You know, investigating fires.
[02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:47.871]  I mean, there's 11 fires around us here.
[02:13:48.812 --> 02:13:51.973]  And nobody's talking about who started the fires.
[02:13:52.554 --> 02:13:54.855]  I mean, these things don't just, you know, it always happens.
[02:13:54.875 --> 02:14:01.137]  Well, that's like breast cancer is up 3,000% in North American women, but no one discusses why it's up.
[02:14:01.177 --> 02:14:02.358]  They just say, let's find a cure.
[02:14:02.858 --> 02:14:03.358]  Exactly.
[02:14:03.878 --> 02:14:05.039]  Let's put the fires out.
[02:14:05.139 --> 02:14:06.139]  Let's not worry about it.
[02:14:06.159 --> 02:14:06.900]  So every year,
[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:15.987]  When we get the Santa Anas, which is the hot temperatures and the high winds, magically, the fires start.
[02:14:16.488 --> 02:14:18.089]  They don't start when it's cold.
[02:14:18.129 --> 02:14:20.731]  They don't start when there's a little bit of rain or whatever.
[02:14:21.592 --> 02:14:30.240]  And, you know, I guess they want us to assume that somehow the sun all alone is starting the fires, in which case the whole planet would have burned up long ago.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:33.361]  But it's not that way.
[02:14:33.562 --> 02:14:40.406]  We've got arsonists around and they wait for that time of the year and then they start the fires.
[02:14:40.586 --> 02:14:41.707]  It happens all the time.
[02:14:42.468 --> 02:14:45.450]  Yeah, arsonists don't go out when it's the middle of the monsoons.
[02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:54.391]  No, they're smart enough to stay home, and if it's raining, if it's cold, if there's no wind, they don't do it.
[02:14:54.451 --> 02:15:00.052]  They wait for high winds, hot temperatures, making it really, you know, really hard.
[02:15:00.873 --> 02:15:12.095]  You know, I think arsonists, I mean, it's one thing if somebody burns down their restaurant to get insurance money, but if you burn something with the, and that's bad too, but if you burn something with the intent to hurt people, I think it's attempted murder.
[02:15:12.235 --> 02:15:15.036]  I mean, I think, and if you kill somebody, you should get death penalty.
[02:15:15.558 --> 02:15:16.138]  Absolutely.
[02:15:16.659 --> 02:15:30.228]  And, you know, yesterday they did report that on the 5 Freeway or El Camino, which is right near the 5 up here, a truck pulled over to the side of the road and, quote, burst into flames.
[02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:36.673]  And the flames caught in the brush and that started the Carlsbad or one of the fires.
[02:15:37.493 --> 02:15:38.174]  Are you kidding me?
[02:15:38.334 --> 02:15:43.758]  I mean, and nobody's asking the question of how did this truck, quote, burst into flames?
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:45.740]  They just leave it.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:46.860]  They don't talk about it.
[02:15:47.841 --> 02:15:50.401]  So, you know, we've got major crimes going here.
[02:15:50.441 --> 02:15:56.223]  We've got 11 fires and who knows how many more on the way before they manage to put them out.
[02:15:56.783 --> 02:16:05.965]  And not only this, going back to the last gigantic fire in San Diego that burned up a tremendous amount of land out here a few years ago.
[02:16:07.213 --> 02:16:22.842]  The story came out that, and this was not a San Diego paper originally, that the Russians had offered to send over these gigantic supertanker planes that they have that can drop enormous amounts of water.
[02:16:23.362 --> 02:16:30.026]  They go out to the ocean, they fill up, they come back, they drop the water, and would put out these fires in a heartbeat.
[02:16:30.706 --> 02:16:39.610]  And the federal government absolutely refused to allow the Russians to give us... Because they didn't want them to have a PR victory and like, oh, the Russians are our friends.
[02:16:40.071 --> 02:16:40.671]  Exactly.
[02:16:40.951 --> 02:16:41.451]  Exactly.
[02:16:41.511 --> 02:16:42.972]  Can't have a PR victory.
[02:16:43.352 --> 02:16:45.693]  The Russians have technology that we don't.
[02:16:45.873 --> 02:16:47.734]  I mean, come on, we can't allow that.
[02:16:47.854 --> 02:16:50.675]  So let's let people's houses burn.
[02:16:51.056 --> 02:16:55.738]  Let's let people burn because we have to keep up the front that we're number one.
[02:16:57.122 --> 02:16:57.602]  Amazing.
[02:16:58.582 --> 02:17:03.243]  Shifting gears, before we get into some of these specific topics with John Rappaport, investigative journalist.
[02:17:05.424 --> 02:17:18.906]  Is it on purpose in your view, I mean we know it is at certain levels that they're saying you didn't build your business, a Benghazi memo that says Benghazi memo isn't a Benghazi memo, there is no drone program even though it's been admitted for 10 years, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:17:20.406 --> 02:17:22.927]  I mean they have gotten to a level of lying now.
[02:17:24.204 --> 02:17:25.966]  That is so transparent.
[02:17:26.006 --> 02:17:28.007]  Are they trying to acclimate us just to accept it?
[02:17:28.428 --> 02:17:29.409]  Do they not care?
[02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:35.935]  The level of corruption now coming out, John, and then no one gets in trouble.
[02:17:36.015 --> 02:17:39.237]  Or has the bottom fallen out now and the sky's the limit?
[02:17:39.678 --> 02:17:42.761]  I mean, what's the state of the nation, the state of the world?
[02:17:44.542 --> 02:17:47.124]  Well, I think they, as you say,
[02:17:48.334 --> 02:17:51.239]  They don't believe that there's any threat anymore.
[02:17:51.259 --> 02:18:00.676]  In other words, they can lie with impunity and say and do the most insane things that they want to, and they'll have control of the situation.
[02:18:02.148 --> 02:18:05.891]  They think they have control of the media, therefore they have control of the situation.
[02:18:05.931 --> 02:18:07.993]  That's the premise they've been operating on.
[02:18:08.073 --> 02:18:20.824]  So, as you say, they can say 2 plus 2 equals 5, 7, 133, and most people will accept that, just because it's coming through traditional media outlets and the government.
[02:18:21.465 --> 02:18:24.507]  And I think that they're running a kind of a gigantic test here.
[02:18:25.268 --> 02:18:27.530]  They want to see if there is any borrow.
[02:18:28.786 --> 02:18:36.027]  You know, is there any point at which people rise up in sufficient numbers and do something about any of this?
[02:18:36.547 --> 02:18:39.308]  Or can they get away with absolutely anything?
[02:18:39.868 --> 02:18:41.048]  And they keep track of this.
[02:18:41.428 --> 02:18:49.190]  I mean, they have committees, they have people who are working at the CIA, for example, that do all sorts of after reports.
[02:18:49.630 --> 02:18:51.350]  How well did this operation work?
[02:18:51.370 --> 02:18:57.111]  Oh yeah, that's all admitted, that they're literally testing to just see if they could come out and say, line up, we're going to shoot you in the head.
[02:18:57.811 --> 02:18:59.592]  And the average yuppie would line up and do it.
[02:19:00.332 --> 02:19:00.692]  Sure.
[02:19:00.992 --> 02:19:07.715]  You know, you 500 people here have to die because you have a virus and we have to protect everybody else.
[02:19:08.655 --> 02:19:09.796]  Can we get away with that one?
[02:19:10.376 --> 02:19:10.876]  Let's see.
[02:19:11.577 --> 02:19:12.477]  Let's see if we can.
[02:19:12.497 --> 02:19:14.138]  That's what they're doing.
[02:19:14.538 --> 02:19:21.781]  But at the same time, as we see this morning, here comes the New York Times whining and complaining and grousing.
[02:19:22.401 --> 02:19:35.571]  That they're losing the, quote, journalistic advantage because digital news, which really means alternative news through the internet, is gaining control.
[02:19:36.192 --> 02:19:37.513]  And they're going down the tubes.
[02:19:38.213 --> 02:19:41.216]  They're in double jeopardy financially.
[02:19:41.316 --> 02:19:43.558]  I mean, they've refinanced their debt.
[02:19:43.658 --> 02:19:48.542]  And then when they fire the editor because they've got to cut costs, they come out and say it's because she's a woman.
[02:19:48.922 --> 02:19:50.863]  Everything turns into political correctness.
[02:19:51.044 --> 02:19:51.364]  Everything.
[02:19:51.844 --> 02:19:52.905]  Everything turns into that.
[02:19:52.925 --> 02:19:55.006]  And then there's the argument about, you know, that.
[02:19:55.367 --> 02:19:56.628]  That becomes the argument.
[02:19:57.128 --> 02:19:59.250]  Should Jill Abramson have been fired?
[02:20:00.050 --> 02:20:01.651]  Was it really because she was a woman?
[02:20:01.771 --> 02:20:03.333]  Or was she difficult to get along with?
[02:20:03.433 --> 02:20:07.015]  Or is this just some kind of male macho blah blah blah?
[02:20:07.376 --> 02:20:09.517]  And then that becomes the issue.
[02:20:09.637 --> 02:20:10.058]  Exactly.
[02:20:10.098 --> 02:20:14.261]  The ship is sinking and they're debating why they just threw a captain overboard.
[02:20:14.661 --> 02:20:15.141]  Exactly.
[02:20:15.762 --> 02:20:17.123]  It's because she's terrible.
[02:20:18.174 --> 02:20:20.095]  I mean, I could turn the New York Times around like that.
[02:20:20.755 --> 02:20:22.315]  All they gotta do is start reporting the truth.
[02:20:23.315 --> 02:20:25.056]  We'll be right back with John Rappaport.
[02:20:27.397 --> 02:20:31.618]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:44.953]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and alarm systems can't prevent forced entry.

[02:21:26.363 --> 02:21:29.845]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:21:30.025 --> 02:21:33.747]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:21:33.847 --> 02:21:39.790]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:21:40.031 --> 02:21:47.835]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts
[02:21:48.675 --> 02:22:04.920]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:16.544]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.

[02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:32.253]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:22:32.273 --> 02:22:33.714]  The police are shoving people.
[02:22:33.754 --> 02:22:35.655]  Shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:22:35.695 --> 02:22:36.376]  Here we go, folks!
[02:22:36.456 --> 02:22:37.296]  I'm being assaulted!
[02:22:37.356 --> 02:22:43.500]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:49.585]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:22:49.705 --> 02:22:53.448]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[02:22:56.570 --> 02:23:04.716]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:23:04.976 --> 02:23:07.018]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:23:07.058 --> 02:23:08.099]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:23:08.459 --> 02:23:17.167]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:24:27.147 --> 02:24:27.388]  Alright.
[02:24:27.448 --> 02:24:29.869]  They got grabbed about two hours ago.
[02:24:30.610 --> 02:24:36.954]  A reporter just got released from Fort A.P.
[02:24:37.114 --> 02:24:37.935]  Hill, Virginia.
[02:24:52.551 --> 02:24:55.592]  Where they have a giant training facility, looks like a mock-up of a U.S.
[02:24:55.632 --> 02:24:55.892]  city.
[02:24:55.912 --> 02:24:57.732]  They admit it's for taking on the Tea Party.
[02:24:58.212 --> 02:24:59.733]  That's in mainstream news.
[02:25:00.753 --> 02:25:02.073]  The military training for treason.
[02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:09.415]  We sent our reporters there and they got arrested and taken to the brig and then relieved after being interrogated.
[02:25:09.435 --> 02:25:10.175]  It's just pathetic.
[02:25:10.215 --> 02:25:11.255]  This country's so shot.
[02:25:12.475 --> 02:25:16.256]  Going back to John Rappaport.
[02:25:20.416 --> 02:25:27.851]  I totally agree with you that the establishment is trying to plumb the bottom.
[02:25:30.441 --> 02:25:34.685]  Because they know they can just get rid of Obama and this group like shark teeth, more will roll forward.
[02:25:35.526 --> 02:25:38.009]  Instead of ever looking at the shark, we look at the shark's teeth.
[02:25:38.810 --> 02:25:42.414]  So they can discredit their puppets that are like a shield they hold up.
[02:25:42.734 --> 02:25:45.076]  When that shield's destroyed, they throw it down, pick up a new one.
[02:25:45.557 --> 02:25:48.920]  How do we get people to pull back and see the full creature?
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.865]  A, and what would you describe this creature as?
[02:25:54.707 --> 02:26:01.371]  Well, the creature is like an octopus, a monster, and as you say, it's changing one puppet for another.
[02:26:01.931 --> 02:26:03.652]  And they always do this with presidents.
[02:26:03.692 --> 02:26:07.034]  You'll see in the second term, the ratings drop.
[02:26:07.334 --> 02:26:12.097]  Oh, you know, it's having a really tough time, whether it's Obama, it's Bush, it's Clinton, it doesn't matter.
[02:26:12.638 --> 02:26:15.839]  You know, and they always kind of slink out of the White House at the end.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:27.266]  Because the whole idea is now, okay, we're going to bring in somebody new now, and this is really going to solve the problems that were created the last term.
[02:26:27.767 --> 02:26:30.028]  You know, and this is just pillar to post.
[02:26:30.268 --> 02:26:32.389]  I mean, it's trying to bring hope
[02:26:33.810 --> 02:26:37.233]  Smashing hope to the ground, bringing it again, smashing it again.
[02:26:38.915 --> 02:26:43.419]  This is a puppet parade, whether it's Hillary Clinton the next time, you know, and so forth.
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:44.841]  It's going to be the same.
[02:26:45.221 --> 02:26:51.647]  If she's elected, she's going to say jobs is number one, you know, number one on my agenda.
[02:26:51.667 --> 02:26:57.372]  We're going to restore the economy, which we didn't really get to finish the job, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:57.552 --> 02:26:58.793]  And that's not going to happen.
[02:26:59.614 --> 02:27:01.838]  And it's going to go on and on and on and on and on.
[02:27:01.898 --> 02:27:09.670]  They build these scandals and horrendous events into each presidential administration.
[02:27:10.985 --> 02:27:18.791]  And then they just smash that particular administration to the ground and they bring on another new one that's really going to be different this time.
[02:27:19.612 --> 02:27:32.442]  And I've got friends who, going back as long as 1980, were telling me, I never vote in any election, but this is the one I've got to vote in because the whole future of the world is hanging on this every single time.
[02:27:33.383 --> 02:27:39.926]  Somebody tries to run as an independent candidate or start a third party or just be a voice of freedom.
[02:27:40.266 --> 02:27:45.989]  Forget the labels and say, I'm running for president and this is what I stand for.
[02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:49.891]  And everybody, you know, says you can't do that.
[02:27:49.931 --> 02:27:56.294]  You can't do that because you might take votes away from so-and-so or such-and-such and that'll destroy the entire country.
[02:27:56.474 --> 02:27:59.677]  I agree, but now we've reached a technological point where they've overplayed their hand.
[02:27:59.697 --> 02:28:00.398]  They're discredited.
[02:28:00.778 --> 02:28:01.999]  Dinosaur Media is dying.
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:08.786]  And I'm not romanticizing the Tea Party, but the real Tea Party, not the Republican version they tried to have take over the real Tea Party.
[02:28:09.446 --> 02:28:12.830]  It's who the Republican and Democratic leadership are talking about behind closed doors.
[02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:14.851]  It's who they're all giving money to defeat.
[02:28:15.592 --> 02:28:18.055]  If we can't have a third party, we could take over a party.
[02:28:18.435 --> 02:28:26.763]  And they actually see that happening because at least conservatives in mind, on average, are ready to make some of the right decisions, grassroots.
[02:28:27.184 --> 02:28:29.606]  So we see the whole power structure against the Tea Party.
[02:28:30.047 --> 02:28:30.928]  What's your take on that?
[02:28:32.199 --> 02:28:37.983]  Well, I would like to see, I don't know whether, you know, call it whatever it is, Tea Party, whatever.
[02:28:38.643 --> 02:28:48.010]  I would like to see Americans that stand for freedom and less government just simply say that and run on that.
[02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:50.431]  And mean it, you know?
[02:28:50.912 --> 02:28:51.973]  Absolutely mean it.
[02:28:52.573 --> 02:29:07.484]  I ran for a seat in the Congress in 1994 in the Democratic primary, which was a mistake at the time because I thought that's the only way to win in this district because Waxman had been elected for the last 20 years.
[02:29:08.085 --> 02:29:11.247]  And halfway through my campaign, I said to myself, what are you doing?
[02:29:11.287 --> 02:29:12.468]  This is completely crazy.
[02:29:13.089 --> 02:29:15.771]  There's only one thing you could do if you got elected.
[02:29:16.751 --> 02:29:38.776]  You go to Washington and you rent big trucks and you drive around these trucks all over the city all the time with giant posters on the side saying corrupt congressman of the week with a picture and a name and who he's gotten money from and what bills he's voted on that are obviously for the money.
[02:29:39.656 --> 02:29:43.877]  In other words, we've got to send people to Washington who disrupt
[02:29:45.046 --> 02:29:45.706]  The system.
[02:29:46.486 --> 02:29:50.388]  Not just, oh, we stand for this, but actually getting there.
[02:30:03.812 --> 02:30:04.312]  There you go.
[02:30:04.492 --> 02:30:09.854]  We're going to be right back with John Rappaport to cover his latest news on the Empire of the Psychiatric Police State.
[02:30:09.874 --> 02:30:13.455]  Then your phone calls for Martin and others that are patiently holding.
[02:30:13.835 --> 02:30:14.335]  Stay with us.
[02:30:14.375 --> 02:30:16.056]  We'll get to Chris, Chad, Michael, Will.
[02:30:16.076 --> 02:30:16.656]  We're on the march.
[02:30:16.676 --> 02:30:17.496]  Everybody, stay with us.
[02:30:17.516 --> 02:30:18.957]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:19.877 --> 02:30:22.538]  Alex Jones at the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:26.607 --> 02:30:29.189]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:30:29.449 --> 02:30:34.311]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:30:34.572 --> 02:30:42.456]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:30:42.696 --> 02:30:46.999]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:30:47.219 --> 02:30:51.041]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:30:51.181 --> 02:30:56.882]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:30:57.122 --> 02:30:59.923]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:31:00.303 --> 02:31:05.523]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:31:13.845 --> 02:31:14.025]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:31:20.666 --> 02:31:32.274]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:31:32.294 --> 02:31:35.976]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:31:36.077 --> 02:31:37.678]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[02:31:37.698 --> 02:31:43.982]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:44.082 --> 02:31:49.966]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless and security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:31:50.126 --> 02:31:53.888]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:31:54.088 --> 02:31:56.930]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:31:56.950 --> 02:32:05.175]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:32:05.435 --> 02:32:07.476]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:32:07.536 --> 02:32:08.577]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:32:08.937 --> 02:32:17.682]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:32:26.314 --> 02:32:29.657]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:32:29.737 --> 02:32:31.978]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:32:32.159 --> 02:32:40.465]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:32:40.765 --> 02:32:56.077]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated or maximum
[02:32:56.237 --> 02:32:56.857]  We're good to go.
[02:33:40.476 --> 02:33:42.597]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:43.097 --> 02:33:47.619]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:47.679 --> 02:33:52.820]  I don't want to be there when you're running down your street.
[02:33:53.721 --> 02:33:59.523]  I don't want to be there when you're British Hill.
[02:34:08.752 --> 02:34:09.372]  That's right.
[02:34:09.592 --> 02:34:11.213]  I don't want to be in your London dungeon.
[02:34:11.233 --> 02:34:13.514]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[02:34:15.434 --> 02:34:16.655]  Crank it up.
[02:34:17.035 --> 02:34:23.397]  That's some good surf music right there.
[02:34:45.508 --> 02:34:47.210]  Alright, and that's good music to bring us in.
[02:34:52.935 --> 02:35:00.919]  Because our reporters just got out and David Knight says that as they're driving away from the base on the main highway, there are just cops following them, cops everywhere.
[02:35:01.379 --> 02:35:03.900]  So I guess they're stopping, getting on Skype to give us a quick report.
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:06.682]  We'll go back to John Rappaport and to your phone calls.
[02:35:07.102 --> 02:35:09.323]  NoMoreFakeNews.com is John's site.
[02:35:09.363 --> 02:35:10.784]  How long are we till getting them ready to go?
[02:35:14.158 --> 02:35:14.618]  Couple minutes.
[02:35:14.698 --> 02:35:14.998]  Okay, fine.
[02:35:15.018 --> 02:35:15.918]  We'll go to them in a couple minutes.
[02:35:16.959 --> 02:35:24.900]  But the issue here is that there's an attack on free press in this country, and they wouldn't let us go see what the base is for, even though we know what it's for.
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:28.081]  They've hidden it in plain view, trying to take on gun owners and the Tea Party.
[02:35:28.961 --> 02:35:35.883]  And so, we still went on there yesterday, got the footage, and today, they arrested them.
[02:35:36.343 --> 02:35:38.063]  In fact, the headline is, our people were detained.
[02:35:38.103 --> 02:35:41.104]  No, when they take you to the police station and keep you for three hours,
[02:35:43.038 --> 02:35:44.859]  Almost three hours, that's called being arrested.
[02:35:48.282 --> 02:35:50.524]  And then I see idiots on YouTube going, uh-huh.
[02:35:51.925 --> 02:35:54.887]  Because we've already got video from earlier in the show, because it's breaking.
[02:35:56.068 --> 02:35:59.051]  Going, uh-huh, your guys didn't get on the base, they already did, dummy.
[02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:04.051]  Not all of us stay in our mother's basements our entire lives.
[02:36:04.071 --> 02:36:05.992]  Just a little flash for you out there.
[02:36:06.012 --> 02:36:13.895]  I always love how the armchair quarterbacks sit there and talk to people that have done this stuff hundreds of times.
[02:36:14.456 --> 02:36:16.737]  And people that have risked their lives to bring you information.
[02:36:17.297 --> 02:36:20.998]  And people that have crawled around in the mud and snakes to cover what's happening.
[02:36:21.439 --> 02:36:24.120]  And then you sit around saying we failed.
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:26.981]  You know, the only time we fail is not taking action, buddy.
[02:36:27.221 --> 02:36:28.602]  When we fail, we win.
[02:36:29.262 --> 02:36:30.483]  Because we're going to continue
[02:36:31.443 --> 02:36:32.624]  To adapt and overcome.
[02:36:35.246 --> 02:36:35.907]  And it's that simple.
[02:36:35.927 --> 02:36:37.968]  We're going back to John Rappaport here in just a moment.
[02:36:39.069 --> 02:36:41.491]  It is more important than ever that you support the InfoWars.
[02:36:41.511 --> 02:36:42.172]  You've been doing it.
[02:36:42.252 --> 02:36:42.872]  I want to thank you.

[02:37:11.852 --> 02:37:16.194]  It's done so much for myself and my family and just cleaned out my body, gave me more energy.
[02:37:16.994 --> 02:37:19.755]  I mean, I still look like hell, but a lot better than I did before.
[02:37:19.795 --> 02:37:23.596]  I'm kind of a, I guess, a pretty corpse right now, as they'd say.
[02:37:24.997 --> 02:37:31.580]  The point is, is that it's all available at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:37.602]  And we've got a discount on the nascent iodine survival shield that's going to end next week, where it's $5 off.
[02:37:37.622 --> 02:37:37.722]  It's $24.95.
[02:37:37.762 --> 02:37:38.703]  That's way below half the price.
[02:37:43.939 --> 02:37:46.260]  Way below half the price of double the strength of the leading competitor.
[02:37:46.561 --> 02:37:47.821]  That special will end next week.
[02:37:47.841 --> 02:37:49.843]  We've got another special coming out next week.
[02:37:49.863 --> 02:37:51.484]  But that special will end next week.
[02:37:51.824 --> 02:37:52.604]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:52.804 --> 02:37:54.786]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:37:54.826 --> 02:37:57.207]  The books, the t-shirts, the high quality organic coffee.
[02:37:57.688 --> 02:37:58.408]  It's all there.
[02:37:58.448 --> 02:37:59.228]  The water filters.
[02:37:59.308 --> 02:38:00.529]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:00.889 --> 02:38:02.150]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:02.430 --> 02:38:05.873]  The Made in America Patriot Apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:38:06.313 --> 02:38:08.294]  The new Molon Lobby shirt for men and women.
[02:38:08.654 --> 02:38:09.315]  So much more.
[02:38:09.855 --> 02:38:10.355]  Madein1776.com.
[02:38:13.177 --> 02:38:17.138]  We're going to go back to John Rappaport in a moment to talk about his latest article and take some calls.
[02:38:17.158 --> 02:38:33.043]  But first off, our reporters who got picked up by the base police and taken in, even though we looked around for base police and others yesterday trying to get an interview, they had to act like they were bad and bring them in.
[02:38:33.423 --> 02:38:37.664]  And then now they've got police following them off the base just to feel like, you know, you're the bad guys.
[02:38:38.084 --> 02:38:39.725]  So I'd pull over and ask the cops what they need.
[02:38:41.116 --> 02:38:43.557]  But let's go now to Virginia.
[02:38:43.817 --> 02:38:45.098]  They're outside the base, correct?
[02:38:45.138 --> 02:38:47.279]  David Knight and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[02:38:48.859 --> 02:38:49.559]  That's right, Alex.
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:50.260]  We're headed back.
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:51.860]  We're headed for our flight.
[02:38:53.461 --> 02:38:54.481]  They escorted us out.
[02:38:54.541 --> 02:38:58.043]  They gave us a paper from the colonel.
[02:38:58.323 --> 02:38:59.764]  But they said we weren't being arrested.
[02:39:00.064 --> 02:39:00.884]  We weren't being detained.
[02:39:00.924 --> 02:39:03.505]  They just held us for questioning for a couple hours.
[02:39:03.865 --> 02:39:05.106]  Two or three hours, I guess.
[02:39:05.286 --> 02:39:08.047]  Under common law and federal and state law, you were arrested.
[02:39:08.882 --> 02:39:09.922]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:10.482 --> 02:39:12.203]  Yeah, well, what he was, you know, semantics.
[02:39:12.243 --> 02:39:17.464]  He says, well, yeah, you can get up and leave, but then we'd have to pick you up because you're not allowed to be on foot on the base.
[02:39:18.565 --> 02:39:22.105]  You know, we're not letting you take the car type of thing, you know, so it's semantics.
[02:39:24.106 --> 02:39:33.629]  But anyway, they waited until they got a letter from the colonel and basically said that we are temporarily suspended from getting on the base for 48 years.
[02:39:37.011 --> 02:39:40.915]  All right, well your Skype's breaking up, but bottom line, they're trying to stop us.
[02:39:41.015 --> 02:39:42.356]  I mean, you drive on the base.
[02:39:43.197 --> 02:39:44.738]  Now, I'm told you're being followed by police.
[02:39:47.761 --> 02:39:48.382]  No, not now.
[02:39:48.722 --> 02:39:49.042]  Not now.
[02:39:49.302 --> 02:39:49.863]  Looks like they stopped.
[02:39:49.883 --> 02:39:51.785]  We had a whole bunch of police outside the base.
[02:39:52.405 --> 02:39:59.912]  I don't know if that was a regular... I mean, it was a lot of police outside the base, but then they escorted us out of the base from the police department.
[02:40:03.062 --> 02:40:04.103]  You know, it's the sort of thing.
[02:40:04.123 --> 02:40:05.344]  They were waiting for us when we came.
[02:40:05.545 --> 02:40:08.487]  There's never been any problem with us going in.
[02:40:08.808 --> 02:40:18.737]  Yeah, David, I wanted you guys to, unless you're late for your flight, to stop somewhere where you've got good bars.
[02:40:19.217 --> 02:40:22.600]  You know, we went in a couple of times yesterday and we didn't have any problems with them.
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:22.861]  Okay.
[02:40:24.342 --> 02:40:25.323]  All right.
[02:40:26.487 --> 02:40:26.928]  Uh, alright.
[02:40:27.428 --> 02:40:29.769]  We need to, if we get some good bars, we need to pull over and stop.
[02:40:30.170 --> 02:40:31.551]  Um, am I still on now, Alex?
[02:40:31.711 --> 02:40:33.872]  Yeah, it's probably not good to be moving when you do it.
[02:40:33.892 --> 02:40:36.494]  If you could pull over where you got good bars, we can conduct the interview.
[02:40:37.595 --> 02:40:41.177]  Okay, if I've got, uh, if we're, okay, I've got three bars right now.
[02:40:41.237 --> 02:40:41.537]  You're good.
[02:40:41.557 --> 02:40:41.817]  Stop.
[02:40:42.037 --> 02:40:42.538]  Stop right there.
[02:40:43.238 --> 02:40:43.719]  Stop, yeah.
[02:40:43.919 --> 02:40:44.459]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:40:44.759 --> 02:40:45.160]  Thank you.
[02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:48.282]  Uh, now, now, just in a nutshell, describe what happened.
[02:40:48.302 --> 02:40:50.283]  Then I want to get Staff Sergeant Biggs to take on it.
[02:40:52.426 --> 02:40:55.167]  When we pulled up this morning, there wasn't any problem.
[02:40:55.207 --> 02:41:06.469]  We went in and we talked to the lady who let us in yesterday and told her that we'd like to interview somebody and see if there's somebody we could talk to, a public information officer.
[02:41:07.650 --> 02:41:09.210]  And she told us which building to go to.
[02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:15.292]  The guy came out and greeted us and he said there wasn't anybody that could talk to us.
[02:41:15.332 --> 02:41:16.652]  We needed to talk to the lieutenant.
[02:41:17.412 --> 02:41:18.253]  We're good to go.
[02:41:32.338 --> 02:41:34.438]  But then they followed us out.
[02:41:34.498 --> 02:41:36.879]  You know, there's a guy maybe about 10 feet behind us.
[02:41:36.919 --> 02:41:39.659]  He walked behind us, you know, all the way out to the car and then stopped.
[02:41:39.679 --> 02:41:44.360]  And then this guy came out, looked like he was heading over to his car, but we couldn't tell that he followed us.
[02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:45.100]  And so then we left.
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:50.061]  And then we went back this afternoon to, you know, just before the radio show.
[02:41:50.541 --> 02:41:56.742]  At that point, when we pulled up, the guy said, turn your car off and give me the keys.
[02:42:00.703 --> 02:42:01.523]  Pull your, you know,
[02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:06.062]  Uh, that, that was when we knew that things were going to go bad.
[02:42:06.442 --> 02:42:11.245]  And at that point, uh, they had us wait for a while and then they escorted us to the police department.
[02:42:11.625 --> 02:42:14.047]  And, uh, cause they have like a private police department here.
[02:42:14.067 --> 02:42:16.148]  It's not, uh, military police.
[02:42:16.908 --> 02:42:19.030]  And we were there for, I guess, two or three hours.
[02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:20.651]  I don't know how long it was that we were there.
[02:42:21.011 --> 02:42:24.233]  And were they laughing at you and acting like you were weird and want to know what was going on in the base?
[02:42:26.338 --> 02:42:28.280]  No, actually they didn't say too much to us at all.
[02:42:29.381 --> 02:42:33.905]  The guy was not happy with me filming as we came up there and he took that away.
[02:42:33.925 --> 02:42:41.972]  They frisked us and took us back to a detention area and had us wait there while they talked to the colonel and see what he wanted to do.
[02:42:42.412 --> 02:42:46.394]  Well, you know, when the enemy comes around, you gotta lock them up here in the free country.
[02:42:46.514 --> 02:42:48.394]  I want to get Big's take on this.
[02:42:49.495 --> 02:42:57.378]  Even if Joe can't hear me, I'm not sure if he can, but ask Joe to give us his take on what the base is and how they treated him and just his thoughts.
[02:42:59.359 --> 02:43:03.301]  Can you give him your take on the base and how you're treated?
[02:43:03.341 --> 02:43:03.981]  Just your thoughts.
[02:43:07.622 --> 02:43:08.443]  I guess they treat us okay.
[02:43:08.483 --> 02:43:08.963]  It was pretty
[02:43:10.768 --> 02:43:22.630]  And they just kind of swarmed us and made me take the keys out of the car place them up on the dash and Then he took the paper from me sick that I got from him at the gate earlier saying that I could be on base The MP took it back from me
[02:43:23.439 --> 02:43:28.862]  And then, uh, a police car came up, escorted us in there, and then they left us in some room for a long time.
[02:43:29.402 --> 02:43:38.446]  They kept saying, oh, it'll be any minute, any minute, and then they left some guy in there with us, just to joke around with us the past time, while they went back and forth and talked to the colonel and did whatever they did.
[02:43:38.466 --> 02:43:40.247]  They took my I.D.
[02:43:40.307 --> 02:43:42.388]  two times and made numerous copies and...
[02:43:43.502 --> 02:43:44.863]  Definitely not a fun time, but whatever.
[02:43:45.263 --> 02:43:45.623]  We got it.
[02:43:45.923 --> 02:43:48.945]  Got all of our phone numbers, our social security number.
[02:43:49.245 --> 02:43:52.547]  Yeah, they got all of my information, where I live and what I do.
[02:43:52.567 --> 02:43:56.128]  Yeah, to put you in a suspicious person's report to act like you've done something wrong.
[02:43:56.749 --> 02:43:59.010]  You know, we know what's going on at that base.
[02:43:59.030 --> 02:44:00.631]  They're trying to take on the American people.
[02:44:00.671 --> 02:44:01.831]  That's public knowledge.
[02:44:02.131 --> 02:44:02.712]  They're doing that.
[02:44:02.772 --> 02:44:04.592]  The fact is that base is clearly one of the sites.
[02:44:05.113 --> 02:44:06.654]  Biggs, you were telling me off-air,
[02:44:07.754 --> 02:44:13.236]  That you think is barbed wire, Constantino wire, is inside it and it's inside a base that it has dual purposes.
[02:44:14.156 --> 02:44:18.258]  Repeat what you told me off air yesterday and then break down what you think is really going on there.
[02:44:19.739 --> 02:44:20.119]  Say it again?
[02:44:20.139 --> 02:44:22.540]  You said you were talking about Constantino wire is inside a base.
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:22.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:24.420]  Break down what you think is going on with the base.
[02:44:26.261 --> 02:44:37.025]  Well, I mean, the base itself is just, it seems like some kind of like a regular training spot, maybe for reservists, but on the inside, I mean, once we went in there, the guy that
[02:44:38.345 --> 02:44:41.447]  I mean, there's something definitely going on there that's not normal activity, you know?
[02:44:41.988 --> 02:44:54.518]  The guy that followed us outside of that asymmetric warfare center earlier came up and he had the gall to, like, talk to me like he was all buddy-buddy and ask me about my tours and my injuries and all that stuff outside the police station.
[02:44:55.839 --> 02:45:01.583]  And he kind of just, like, smiled and laughed, like a cynical laugh, and then drove off back to his little dungeon.
[02:45:03.725 --> 02:45:06.347]  Yeah, so it was pretty clear he was trying to get information from you?
[02:45:07.188 --> 02:45:07.448]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:08.843 --> 02:45:09.943]  I've never had that happen before.
[02:45:09.983 --> 02:45:11.024]  That was very odd.
[02:45:13.344 --> 02:45:15.745]  Well, they're building this stuff all over and they've taken the country.
[02:45:15.785 --> 02:45:18.245]  I guess they legitimately have captured it and think it's theirs.
[02:45:19.246 --> 02:45:22.086]  The only problem is they want to teach 5-year-olds how to have anal sex.
[02:45:23.667 --> 02:45:25.707]  The people running this country are definitely not good.
[02:45:25.727 --> 02:45:28.008]  Want to teach 5-year-olds 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:45:28.328 --> 02:45:30.269]  I mean, we were covering that earlier.
[02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:31.169]  It's just a sick elite.
[02:45:31.889 --> 02:45:34.871]  And the poor troops and enforcers and bureaucrats, they're compartmentalized.
[02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:36.493]  They have no idea what they're part of.
[02:45:36.533 --> 02:45:40.216]  That's why we're there to draw attention to this so there can be a debate.
[02:45:40.556 --> 02:45:45.620]  We have victory going to the base, showing it, and we have victory getting thrown out of it.
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:48.062]  That draws attention and shows what real media does.
[02:45:48.422 --> 02:45:52.626]  Kind of like I sent reporters to the West Coast to monitor increased radiation levels.
[02:45:53.897 --> 02:46:00.260]  Since then, it's been in LA Times, AP, Reuters, Navy investigations, and it's causing a public debate about it.
[02:46:00.820 --> 02:46:02.540]  So, that's what InfoWars does.
[02:46:02.941 --> 02:46:03.941]  That's our real power.
[02:46:04.541 --> 02:46:06.162]  Closing comments, Joe Biggs.
[02:46:09.813 --> 02:46:11.154]  I'm glad we got what we did.
[02:46:11.174 --> 02:46:14.176]  I mean, we did everything the right way.
[02:46:14.337 --> 02:46:16.658]  We went by all their army standards and got on base.
[02:46:16.759 --> 02:46:18.180]  I mean, I don't know what the problem was.
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:20.742]  I mean, you know, we did everything we should have.
[02:46:20.762 --> 02:46:21.843]  There was no sneaking around.
[02:46:21.863 --> 02:46:25.025]  You know, we went through every proper protocol to be there.
[02:46:25.445 --> 02:46:27.767]  So I don't know why they just kind of flipped on us all of a sudden.
[02:46:27.787 --> 02:46:32.211]  Maybe when we started asking questions about the emails, why they haven't answered us back or not.
[02:46:34.332 --> 02:46:35.193]  Well, great job.
[02:46:35.894 --> 02:46:38.736]  Some people are going to wake up and see a lot of that stuff that's really going on back there.
[02:46:39.346 --> 02:46:39.746]  Absolutely.
[02:46:39.766 --> 02:46:41.047]  Well, you guys get back safe.
[02:46:41.107 --> 02:46:41.727]  Great job.
[02:46:42.167 --> 02:46:44.949]  We already got your high def footage you mailed in last night.
[02:46:45.409 --> 02:46:50.832]  So we will talk to you soon and look forward to maybe we'll all go out and get some dinner or something this weekend.
[02:46:51.732 --> 02:46:52.192]  Roger that.
[02:46:52.592 --> 02:46:53.433]  Alright, take care guys.
[02:46:53.453 --> 02:46:53.953]  Great job.
[02:46:54.714 --> 02:46:56.274]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, there you go.
[02:46:56.414 --> 02:46:57.935]  Rappaport, thank you for holding during that.
[02:46:57.975 --> 02:47:00.957]  John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com, investigative journalist.
[02:47:01.517 --> 02:47:02.677]  What's your take on what you just heard?
[02:47:02.697 --> 02:47:03.938]  I want to get into your new article.
[02:47:04.298 --> 02:47:04.718]  Alert!
[02:47:04.818 --> 02:47:07.680]  Imperial psychiatric empire is invading the mind.
[02:47:09.261 --> 02:47:15.788]  Well, from what you guys are saying, this was, uh, you know, somebody caught on.
[02:47:16.829 --> 02:47:21.033]  Somebody at the base said, wait a minute, you know, we, what are we doing here?
[02:47:21.053 --> 02:47:25.318]  Uh, we don't want to expose what we're actually up to.
[02:47:25.898 --> 02:47:30.143]  So we have to divert these guys and therefore they're dangerous and they're a threat.
[02:47:30.683 --> 02:47:33.305]  I mean, from everything that they were saying, that's how they were looked at.
[02:47:33.346 --> 02:47:34.647]  They were looked at as a threat.
[02:47:35.127 --> 02:47:36.308]  You can't have free speech.
[02:47:36.348 --> 02:47:39.911]  You can't come here to see what tax dollars are doing.
[02:47:40.272 --> 02:47:42.273]  You can't see what the military is up to.
[02:47:42.334 --> 02:47:43.334]  You have no rights.
[02:47:44.035 --> 02:47:47.158]  And we're going to show you that, and we're going to stick you in a room and leave you there.
[02:47:48.161 --> 02:47:49.342]  And that's what they did.
[02:47:49.362 --> 02:47:55.887]  I mean, it's completely, you know, illegal, illegitimate, unconstitutional.
[02:47:56.988 --> 02:48:02.092]  There's no, it's not like they're testing some secret weapon there or something like that.
[02:48:02.593 --> 02:48:05.695]  Exactly, they let him on the base and they had the piece of paper.
[02:48:05.975 --> 02:48:08.918]  That's why the MP took it away before he called the cops over.
[02:48:09.548 --> 02:48:10.048]  Exactly.
[02:48:10.388 --> 02:48:14.190]  So suddenly we decided you were okay, now you're not okay.
[02:48:14.250 --> 02:48:24.115]  Because somebody tipped us, somebody said, hey, these guys are going to expose you, and uh-oh, we've got to put them in a room, but we can't really lock them up.
[02:48:25.055 --> 02:48:26.196]  Uh, for very long.
[02:48:26.377 --> 02:48:29.399]  We can't hold them on any charge, because there isn't any charge.
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:36.646]  And if we start to really, uh, cause trouble for these guys, then InfoWars is going to blast that all over the world.
[02:48:37.247 --> 02:48:42.312]  So we better just make sure they get out of here, send them on their way, and try to forget about the whole thing.
[02:48:42.852 --> 02:48:45.715]  But, you know, people aren't going to forget about the whole thing.
[02:48:47.028 --> 02:48:48.910]  Well, again, we win by shaking it up.
[02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:57.599]  That's the whole point, is to, as you said, disrupt this occupier government, this globalist government, disrupt their lives and draw attention.
[02:48:57.639 --> 02:48:59.461]  As you said, we gotta get people out of their trance.
[02:48:59.801 --> 02:49:00.462]  How do we do that?
[02:49:00.782 --> 02:49:01.263]  Exactly.
[02:49:01.563 --> 02:49:03.745]  Gotta get, just like you said, you know,
[02:49:05.106 --> 02:49:06.347]  Don't accept the illusion.
[02:49:06.948 --> 02:49:10.270]  Don't accept it when somebody says, this is reality.
[02:49:10.691 --> 02:49:19.498]  When the New York Times says this is reality, or the federal government, or Obama, or Bush, or the Congress, or any of these people say, this is reality.
[02:49:20.419 --> 02:49:21.379]  Absolutely no.
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:22.920]  It's not reality.
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:27.522]  It's their illusion that they're foisting on you.
[02:49:28.382 --> 02:49:34.225]  And so you have to, in order to reject it, you have to disrupt it.
[02:49:34.765 --> 02:49:40.027]  It isn't just a matter of saying, no, you have to disrupt the narrative.
[02:49:41.127 --> 02:49:42.328]  They're telling a story.
[02:49:42.668 --> 02:49:45.589]  So you interrupt the story and you say, no, that's not it.
[02:49:46.029 --> 02:49:47.530]  Here's the story over here.
[02:49:48.789 --> 02:49:50.070]  You don't let that happen.
[02:49:50.831 --> 02:50:01.501]  You don't allow them to just steamroller over you with all their concocted supposed facts and all their fainting and, you know, pretense and all of that.
[02:50:02.142 --> 02:50:11.290]  And that's why I said when I was running for Congress, I realized, hey, if by some miracle they send me there, I'm going to just do as much disruption as possible.
[02:50:12.151 --> 02:50:18.573]  During my term and expose the whole thing as a complete sham from top to bottom, both parties.
[02:50:19.353 --> 02:50:20.493]  That's the only way to go.
[02:50:20.913 --> 02:50:24.414]  That's the kind of people that should be going to Washington and getting elected.
[02:50:24.854 --> 02:50:30.416]  If I go to Washington, I'm going to disrupt the narrative and shatter the illusion.
[02:50:30.916 --> 02:50:31.736]  That's my job.
[02:50:31.776 --> 02:50:32.236]  Well, exactly.
[02:50:32.256 --> 02:50:34.217]  They're always saying, there's bad gridlock.
[02:50:34.257 --> 02:50:35.637]  We want a lot to get done.
[02:50:35.957 --> 02:50:39.658]  They pass sometimes thousands of horrible pieces of legislation.
[02:50:40.258 --> 02:50:40.698]  No, no, no.
[02:50:40.838 --> 02:50:42.779]  The founders said we want gridlock.
[02:50:43.239 --> 02:50:43.619]  Exactly.
[02:50:43.719 --> 02:50:45.439]  I mean, we want to disrupt.
[02:50:45.559 --> 02:50:47.320]  You don't want a government that takes over.
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:48.360]  Exactly.
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:49.040]  Exactly.
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:49.920]  That's the whole point.
[02:50:50.380 --> 02:50:52.821]  Gee, they can't get anything done.
[02:50:52.881 --> 02:50:55.101]  And so that's why the country is suffering.
[02:50:55.501 --> 02:50:56.181]  Are you kidding?
[02:50:57.022 --> 02:50:58.402]  That's not the point at all.
[02:50:59.497 --> 02:51:05.761]  The idea that they can't get anything done, if it were really true, which it isn't, that would be great.
[02:51:05.801 --> 02:51:08.243]  Oh yeah, they're acting like stuff's bad because they didn't get something done.
[02:51:08.283 --> 02:51:09.304]  They're getting it all done!
[02:51:09.664 --> 02:51:15.448]  Obamacare, stimulus packages, QE3, Common Core.
[02:51:16.148 --> 02:51:17.970]  Believe me, they're getting it all done!

[02:53:40.382 --> 02:53:47.645]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:53:47.865 --> 02:53:51.508]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:53:51.768 --> 02:53:55.991]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:53:56.151 --> 02:54:02.015]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:54:02.055 --> 02:54:05.797]  You're right, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:54:05.977 --> 02:54:08.519]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:54:08.699 --> 02:54:10.020]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:54:10.180 --> 02:54:11.401]  It's time to take action.
[02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:13.202]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:54:34.155 --> 02:54:36.857]  We'll do five minutes overdrive with John Rappaport to get your calls in.
[02:54:37.057 --> 02:54:37.478]  Alert!
[02:54:38.058 --> 02:54:40.500]  Imperial psychiatric empire is invading the mind.
[02:54:40.961 --> 02:54:43.583]  John Rappaport, Top Story, Infowars.com.
[02:54:44.364 --> 02:54:48.307]  Next story, FCC moves corporatization of internet forward.
[02:54:49.027 --> 02:54:52.230]  Principal calls cops on middle school students over doodle.
[02:54:53.071 --> 02:54:56.614]  Greenwald slams neutered and impotent obsolete media.
[02:54:56.754 --> 02:54:57.314]  Absolutely.
[02:54:58.035 --> 02:55:01.118]  USDA to purchase submachine guns.
[02:55:01.138 --> 02:55:01.958]  That's a big article.
[02:55:02.839 --> 02:55:06.543]  That's some of the articles up on InfoWars.com and our backup site.
[02:55:06.584 --> 02:55:11.669]  InfoWars may be up and down the next few days as we try to upgrade the site to new designs, new codes.
[02:55:12.310 --> 02:55:14.253]  So just be ready for that.
[02:55:14.313 --> 02:55:16.195]  PrisonPlanet.com is the backup mirror.
[02:55:16.415 --> 02:55:18.638]  It's not really a mirror, though, because it has some different stuff to it.
[02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:21.801]  To check out both the sites.
[02:55:21.821 --> 02:55:26.544]  You can always find us at Twitter at RealAlexJones and our Facebook's in the YouTube and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:55:27.004 --> 02:55:29.947]  But remember, there's a lot of people moving to try to stop this information.
[02:55:30.487 --> 02:55:31.808]  So please get that article out.
[02:55:31.908 --> 02:55:34.830]  FCC moves corporatization of internet forward.
[02:55:35.751 --> 02:55:40.194]  And the sub-headline should be, you know, end of internet as we know it looms.
[02:55:40.814 --> 02:55:45.798]  In addition to bandwidth issue, commissioners are concerned about large ISPs blocking websites.
[02:55:48.018 --> 02:55:50.559]  Yeah, some commissioners are, but the others are going along with it.
[02:55:51.279 --> 02:55:54.600]  So that article's up there, but it ties into a larger situation.
[02:55:55.401 --> 02:55:57.001]  Martin in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[02:55:57.041 --> 02:56:00.003]  You're on the air, listening on WMQM 1600.
[02:56:01.623 --> 02:56:02.543]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:56:03.464 --> 02:56:07.645]  Yes, Alex, I want to thank you for doing the work that we should have done about two generations ago.
[02:56:07.665 --> 02:56:15.068]  I think you've established a template for the resistance, and I really appreciate that.
[02:56:15.088 --> 02:56:16.129]  No, I appreciate you, brother.
[02:56:16.149 --> 02:56:16.909]  We're all in this together.
[02:56:18.117 --> 02:56:18.698]  Yeah, we are.
[02:56:19.339 --> 02:56:34.258]  I just want to compel, I think there are about 5 million informed people out there that are locked and loaded, and I just want to compel them to inform 50 people in the next year, and that will give us our numbers.
[02:56:35.908 --> 02:56:36.628]  That's all we got to do.
[02:56:36.648 --> 02:56:37.788]  We just got to keep talking.
[02:56:37.868 --> 02:56:40.469]  I'm just so glad that you're out there and you're doing what you're doing.
[02:56:40.729 --> 02:56:43.430]  I was about to say, they want us to feel like we have no power.
[02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:47.130]  Because so many callers call in and say, I didn't know any of this until two years ago.
[02:56:47.491 --> 02:56:51.371]  Somebody gave me a copy of the Obama deception or somebody sent me a link to one of your videos.
[02:56:51.951 --> 02:56:53.072]  This is just one show.
[02:56:53.292 --> 02:56:55.232]  All of you are as good as I am or better.
[02:56:55.572 --> 02:56:58.453]  Let's kick their butt one little deed at a time.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:09.822]  Thirty years ago, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Millett, who fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, sat down with me and he told me what was going on.
[02:57:10.382 --> 02:57:16.224]  I'd like to compel you to go down a rabbit hole on Colonel Millett.
[02:57:16.764 --> 02:57:22.045]  Tell me about Colonel Millett and tell me what he told you.
[02:57:22.605 --> 02:57:27.786]  There was an operation going on, basically, and he was just confirming what Smedley Butler said.
[02:57:29.946 --> 02:57:30.666]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:57:30.746 --> 02:57:32.027]  They tried to overthrow the U.S.
[02:57:32.107 --> 02:57:33.368]  and tried to hire Butler to do it.
[02:57:33.728 --> 02:57:34.328]  He wouldn't do it.
[02:57:34.368 --> 02:57:35.949]  Blew the whistle, but it got covered up.
[02:57:36.509 --> 02:57:38.190]  And so now they've done it just incrementally.
[02:57:38.250 --> 02:57:39.630]  But it is a corporate takeover.
[02:57:40.030 --> 02:57:40.911]  It's not free market.
[02:57:41.891 --> 02:57:45.273]  He was an old John Barcher and he was also a Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[02:57:45.293 --> 02:57:48.134]  He's decorated 18 times in warfare.
[02:57:48.474 --> 02:57:52.216]  He's got a hill named after him in Korea and a park named after him in California.
[02:57:52.556 --> 02:57:53.516]  He was a true patriot.
[02:57:53.997 --> 02:57:56.738]  And you need to go down a rabbit hole on him because he was carrying a message.
[02:57:57.158 --> 02:57:59.319]  And I thank you for carrying the message, my friend.
[02:57:59.707 --> 02:58:01.307]  Yeah, he died in 2009, thank you.
[02:58:01.347 --> 02:58:04.848]  Colonel Lewis Millet, who led Bayonet Hill Charge, dies at 88.
[02:58:05.048 --> 02:58:05.328]  Yeah.
[02:58:07.489 --> 02:58:11.970]  Well, they never got away with the full takeover, because so many good people in the military wouldn't go along with it.
[02:58:11.990 --> 02:58:20.932]  In fact, that's who blew the whistle on almost everything, was military people the last 60 years, but now people just do what they're told, and if they keep doing it, we're done.
[02:58:21.272 --> 02:58:24.973]  John, we're going to overdrive for a few minutes, but real quick, your take on what he was just saying.
[02:58:26.638 --> 02:58:42.105]  Well, I think that there's a lot of military guys out there who know the story of the imperial empire, the corporate imperial empire, starting with Smedley Butler, that everybody should know about as to what these wars are really for.
[02:58:42.165 --> 02:58:44.946]  They have nothing to do with patriotism.
[02:58:44.986 --> 02:58:46.586]  They have to do with takeovers.
[02:58:46.607 --> 02:58:49.848]  That's what this is all about, is spreading a globalist empire.
[02:58:52.545 --> 02:58:53.806]  And now it's all public.
[02:58:54.007 --> 02:58:55.728]  It's no longer called Conspiracy Theorist.
[02:58:55.768 --> 02:58:58.911]  It's all happening now and it's just going to get crazier.
[02:58:59.311 --> 02:59:05.816]  Chris and Michael and Chad, maybe Rob, we'll try to get to all of you back in 60 seconds.
[02:59:05.877 --> 02:59:07.978]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:59:08.439 --> 02:59:11.942]  You'll find the free video feed and audio feed.
[02:59:12.142 --> 02:59:13.743]  And thanks to all our stations out there.
[02:59:13.803 --> 02:59:14.484]  Support them, folks.
[02:59:16.656 --> 02:59:20.659]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:59:20.699 --> 02:59:24.822]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:59:25.062 --> 02:59:28.484]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:59:28.724 --> 02:59:31.606]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:59:31.786 --> 02:59:39.171]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:59:39.331 --> 02:59:42.974]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:59:43.174 --> 02:59:47.496]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:59:47.656 --> 02:59:53.598]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:59:53.638 --> 02:59:57.419]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:59:57.579 --> 03:00:00.120]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[03:00:00.320 --> 03:00:01.660]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:03.041]  It's time to take action.
[03:00:03.181 --> 03:00:04.881]  It's time to filter our water.

[03:00:18.930 --> 03:00:20.291]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:20.972 --> 03:00:24.195]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:31.363 --> 03:00:35.524]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:36.204 --> 03:00:37.004]  You want answers?
[03:00:37.784 --> 03:00:38.685]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:39.325 --> 03:00:42.966]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:43.526 --> 03:00:47.627]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:52.108 --> 03:00:54.588]  Globalism is an anti-human movement.
[03:00:55.068 --> 03:00:58.089]  You are shining on the destruction of you and your family's future.
[03:01:00.678 --> 03:01:03.560]  There shouldn't even be a decision to stand against this, folks.
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:07.122]  They played the game, it doesn't exist for so long, now it's here.
[03:01:08.583 --> 03:01:09.864]  John Rappaport's our guest.
[03:01:10.444 --> 03:01:12.605]  Let's talk to Chris in South Carolina.
[03:01:12.946 --> 03:01:14.086]  Go ahead, sir, thanks for holding.
[03:01:15.147 --> 03:01:17.328]  Hey, thanks for going into overdrive today.
[03:01:17.749 --> 03:01:18.109]  You bet.
[03:01:18.969 --> 03:01:24.493]  I was calling, when they were playing that video earlier, those kids, do you think they're actors that they've put up to make this video?
[03:01:25.319 --> 03:01:27.581]  You know, those kids are so little that I don't think so.
[03:01:28.281 --> 03:01:31.704]  I think the older girl, the older Judas Goat, leading them, is an actor.
[03:01:32.564 --> 03:01:33.465]  Clearly an actress.
[03:01:33.745 --> 03:01:35.026]  You know, she's about 10 or 11.
[03:01:36.167 --> 03:01:37.668]  But is meant to look like she's 8.
[03:01:38.969 --> 03:01:40.971]  And the others are as young as 4 years of age.
[03:01:41.932 --> 03:01:42.592]  Much plug in.
[03:01:42.992 --> 03:01:45.414]  I just received my male vitality about 3 days ago.
[03:01:45.474 --> 03:01:47.356]  And I must say, that is some good stuff.
[03:01:48.076 --> 03:01:49.437]  We don't sell bull.
[03:01:49.517 --> 03:01:50.258]  What'd it do for you?
[03:01:51.708 --> 03:01:55.013]  Oh man, I jump out of the bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[03:01:55.374 --> 03:01:56.816]  No lazy legs, ready to go.
[03:01:56.836 --> 03:02:01.143]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[03:02:01.684 --> 03:02:08.049]  It is definitely all natural, organic, libido, stimulus, exercises.
[03:02:08.489 --> 03:02:09.349]  It's amazing stuff.
[03:02:09.730 --> 03:02:10.750]  I take it three times a day.
[03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:13.252]  Consult your physician before you do it because it's not a joke.
[03:02:13.672 --> 03:02:14.193]  God bless you.
[03:02:14.213 --> 03:02:15.334]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:16.675 --> 03:02:20.257]  Rapoport, I want to get you back on the Nightly News in the next few days about your article.
[03:02:20.277 --> 03:02:23.860]  We don't even have time to get into that today, but it's at the top of InfoWars.com.
[03:02:24.380 --> 03:02:25.581]  So much of this is chemical.
[03:02:26.221 --> 03:02:28.483]  How do we get around the chemicals in the food and the water?
[03:02:30.310 --> 03:02:37.371]  And it's really difficult, but, you know, if you stop and back up and say, what am I taking into my body?
[03:02:37.931 --> 03:02:49.173]  And if you learn what that is, all these chemicals and so on, and the illnesses and disruption that they cause, then you say, I've got to eat clean food.
[03:02:50.454 --> 03:02:53.114]  I've got to filter my water.
[03:02:53.274 --> 03:02:55.614]  I've got to do all these simple, basic things.
[03:02:56.155 --> 03:02:57.975]  If possible, grow my own food.
[03:02:59.011 --> 03:03:00.072]  Lots of people can.
[03:03:01.173 --> 03:03:07.697]  You know, you've got to stop the music long enough to see what the assault of all these chemicals are.
[03:03:07.717 --> 03:03:08.037]  That's it.
[03:03:08.178 --> 03:03:10.259]  We're not just in a trance medically, they admit.
[03:03:10.379 --> 03:03:11.900]  A near trance level.
[03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:14.442]  We're also running so fast we're on the treadmill.
[03:03:14.782 --> 03:03:17.644]  We gotta pull off, slow down, assess the larger situation.
[03:03:17.944 --> 03:03:19.906]  Great wisdom from John Rapoport.
[03:03:20.186 --> 03:03:22.608]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chad in Canada.
[03:03:22.648 --> 03:03:23.228]  You're on the air.
[03:03:23.488 --> 03:03:24.069]  Thanks for holding.
[03:03:25.009 --> 03:03:26.450]  I'll hold for you any day, Alex.
[03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:27.311]  Keep on the fight.
[03:03:27.611 --> 03:03:28.032]  Thank you, brother.
[03:03:28.052 --> 03:03:28.532]  What's on your mind?
[03:03:29.065 --> 03:03:29.906]  Uh, two things.
[03:03:29.926 --> 03:03:34.089]  You know, as libertarians, I think we gotta accept this whole, uh, like, gay culture.
[03:03:34.369 --> 03:03:47.098]  I do agree it's crap that they shove it down our throat, but I think the problem is if the state gets a hold of it and they kind of ram it through the churches, I think every church should have the right to deny a gay marriage, but as if, like, if the gays want a church, why don't you start your own church?
[03:03:47.118 --> 03:03:48.118]  So many people have done that.
[03:03:48.138 --> 03:03:49.960]  No, no, but see, that's conflating the issues.
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:53.302]  People can do it with their own issue, their own church, their own deal.
[03:03:53.802 --> 03:03:57.165]  That's separate from teaching five-year-olds about it.
[03:03:57.845 --> 03:03:58.965]  sexualizing our children.
[03:03:58.985 --> 03:04:00.686]  I don't want them taught about heterosexual stuff.
[03:04:01.026 --> 03:04:02.867]  Keep your dirty hands off the kids.
[03:04:03.227 --> 03:04:03.987]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:04:04.607 --> 03:04:06.968]  Okay, last point and then I'll let you let me go.
[03:04:07.949 --> 03:04:10.570]  It's more of a question.
[03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:13.611]  You've been talking about how George Soros is kind of promoting marijuana use.
[03:04:13.671 --> 03:04:15.711]  I've been using marijuana since I was 15.
[03:04:16.492 --> 03:04:17.792]  I don't have any problem with it.
[03:04:17.812 --> 03:04:19.633]  I'm not trying to condone it for everybody to go do it.
[03:04:19.713 --> 03:04:20.953]  If it's not for you, don't do it.
[03:04:21.033 --> 03:04:24.014]  I'm for decriminalization.
[03:04:24.114 --> 03:04:25.535]  It doesn't mean that I endorse
[03:04:26.545 --> 03:04:30.626]  It, for, you know, the culture of just using living daylights out of it, I think it's abused.
[03:04:31.007 --> 03:04:32.687]  But that's not the state's area to be in.
[03:04:33.507 --> 03:04:35.728]  Why do you think George Soros is pumping it like crazy?
[03:04:36.188 --> 03:04:38.709]  Because it's, a lot of people on it are zombies now.
[03:04:38.729 --> 03:04:41.930]  I mean, the marijuana now is super, super strong.
[03:04:42.831 --> 03:04:48.453]  And it helps a lot of people that have depression, a lot of people that can't eat because they got to chemotherapy and stuff, so it's got a lot of uses.
[03:04:48.813 --> 03:04:50.754]  Hey, John Rutherford, quick comment on marijuana.
[03:04:51.174 --> 03:04:51.594]  Take us out.
[03:04:52.827 --> 03:04:54.428]  Big tax bonanza.
[03:04:54.448 --> 03:04:55.708]  You know?
[03:04:56.168 --> 03:04:57.529]  Government gets more money.
[03:04:57.889 --> 03:05:03.711]  If we can control it, legalize it, tax the hell out of it, and then we've got more money in the coffers.
[03:05:04.311 --> 03:05:09.552]  And I think you're seeing some of that happening with all this rumble with the Mexican cartels.
[03:05:10.073 --> 03:05:11.753]  There's a power shift change here.
[03:05:11.793 --> 03:05:20.436]  The government has decided, hey, we want to make our piece of the action bigger, and so we want to legalize it and tax the heck out of it.
[03:05:20.976 --> 03:05:23.718]  Exactly, but not fully legalized and still throw folks in prison.
[03:05:23.878 --> 03:05:25.399]  Back tonight, 7 o'clock with the Nightly News.
[03:05:25.419 --> 03:05:25.899]  Great job, crew.
