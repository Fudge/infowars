[00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:10.198]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:11.779]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.339]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.521]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.623]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:42.731]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the 20th day of February 2014.
[00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:46.777]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.394 --> 00:01:11.600]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us via video Skype at the bottom of this hour to break down his in-depth investigation of the State Department running the Kony 2012 style fake videos that has spurred much of what you're seeing in the Ukraine.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.582]  And it's just a fact that in Syria, Libya, Egypt,
[00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.182]  Tunisia, Ukraine, Georgia, the list goes on and on.
[00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:31.830]  The globalists that are running this government, the same ones that won our guns, the same ones that say the state runs our children, this is not America doing this, let's be clear.
[00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:42.518]  It's a global crime syndicate running much of Europe, running England, running Australia, running New Zealand, running many other countries around the world, Canada, the United States, and they want to overthrow
[00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:50.012]  The government of, the elected government by the way, of Ukraine, not to even put something better in.
[00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:52.913]  That would be immoral.
[00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.354]  Because it always leads to something bad.
[00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:59.577]  But this is to set the country up to be sucked dry by the EU.
[00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:06.180]  And the EU undoubtedly right now, other than like North Korea or the Mexican government, super kleptocracies,
[00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.927]  When you talk about big global power blocks, the EU is the most corrupt.
[00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:16.109]  I mean, the EU is just unbelievable in their progressive tyranny.
[00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:25.693]  Their Agenda 21, their anti-family, the leadership of it being above the law, you know, exempt from taxes.
[00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.834]  It's amazing.
[00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:36.158]  And personally, you know, if I was Ukraine, I wouldn't want to be under Russia's thumb or under EU's thumb, and they really haven't been under either thumb for a while.
[00:02:37.622 --> 00:03:00.012]  Both sides are obviously influencing in that area, but George Soros is involved, you name it, and Paul Watson has all the documentation in an article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and he's going to be joining us, but there's obviously been some huge, huge, huge, huge developments on that front that we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.193]  And then he hadn't been on in a while.
[00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:03.874]  He said, I don't know, it's got to be over 40 surgeries now.
[00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:05.155]  Dr. Doug Rockey.
[00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:19.061]  was the former head of the DU weapons program for the Pentagon.
[00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:32.072]  And I wanted to get him on just to talk about the general move to test secret things on the troops, to cut the health care of the troops, to let the troops use deadly DU and tie that into Fukushima and so much more.
[00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:33.873]  He is a physicist
[00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:35.535]  He's a chemist.
[00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:37.016]  He's got a whole bunch of degrees.
[00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.496]  He's a Vietnam veteran.
[00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:40.917]  Just a very, very combat veteran.
[00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:51.119]  Very interesting fellow and has gone through beyond Darth Vader level surgeries and stuff to try to stay alive.
[00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.660]  Most of his team is dead.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:02.109]  That cleaned up the highway of death between Kuwait and Iraq, where the ATN warthogs shot up that whole big column of fleeing Iraqis.
[00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.053]  They went in to, quote, clean it up and also, quote, study it.
[00:04:06.053 --> 00:04:11.379]  And I just really need to warn people about how deadly depleted uranium is.
[00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.643]  So all of that is coming up today and your phone calls.
[00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:28.712]  Now, outside of that, obviously, there is an insane amount of news to cover and some really good news to cover as well.
[00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:35.914]  Because we reported a while back ago about Homeland Security to activate National License Plate Recognition Database.
[00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:37.655]  It's already been activated.
[00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:41.116]  After we reported on that and DrudgeReport.com carried it over the weekend,
[00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:51.619]  Washington Post today, Department of Homeland Security, cancels national license plate tracking plan after public attention was brought to it.
[00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:54.921]  And that dovetails with the FCC wades into the newsroom.
[00:04:54.921 --> 00:04:58.364]  They're sending their political police to a newsroom near you.
[00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:58.965]  That's coming up.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.102]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:08.204]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:13.768]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:15.709]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:17.350]  We are what we eat.
[00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.014]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:26.236]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:28.498]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:35.005]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:37.989]  To learn more visit InfoWarsHealth.com.

[00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:51.099]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:02.205]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:05.867]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:10.391]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:16.515]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:27.303]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:06:27.503 --> 00:06:33.990]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:48.725]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:06:50.266 --> 00:07:03.095]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:08.119]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:15.284]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:21.049]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:25.093]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:29.797]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:35.022]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:07:35.262 --> 00:07:48.651]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen, When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein, Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event, and Crank Shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:55.855]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com, and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:57.136]  We're getting prepared.
[00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:57.797]  Are you?
[00:07:57.797 --> 00:07:58.637]  InfoWarshop.com.
[00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:05.742]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:09.824]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:14.866]  From FEMA Region 6.
[00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.273]  There is a war.
[00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.156]  It's happening now.
[00:08:28.156 --> 00:08:30.519]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:33.103]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:35.005]  We are the resistance.
[00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:36.647]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:45.118]  It is simply unbelievable to realize that we are the resistance, we are the info war.
[00:08:45.118 --> 00:09:04.495]  Our little ragtag operation here in Austin, Texas, beaming out worldwide, undoubtedly is reaching more than 15 million people a week, is reaching major governments, is spurring serious debates, and then the ripple effect of those 15 plus million people a week that watch the show, listen to it, read our news articles,
[00:09:05.537 --> 00:09:07.304]  Follow our videos online.
[00:09:07.304 --> 00:09:10.337]  It's more like 20 million to be conservative, but just to be accurate.
[00:09:13.237 --> 00:09:39.046]  The ripple effect that goes out is immeasurable and it is a great responsibility and by the grace of God we are here broadcasting worldwide trying to do the very best job we can, trying to be as accurate as we can, trying to really bring you the veritas, the truth, in the hope of sparking brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere to up our game against tyranny and to really build a better world together.
[00:09:41.067 --> 00:09:45.110]  We're going to begin today, my friends.
[00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.774]  We saw this last year when Obama first proposed it.
[00:09:50.774 --> 00:09:57.460]  And even I couldn't believe it when Paul Watson wrote an article about it about six months ago.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.223]  And then he wrote an article about it a few days ago.
[00:10:02.223 --> 00:10:09.168]  And it was still so surreal when he was linking directly into
[00:10:10.795 --> 00:10:20.960]  The FCC's own website where they were making this announcement under the directive of the president, who's acting more and more as a dictator.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.483]  Again, an elected president operates in the purview of the executive branch with limited powers.
[00:10:27.483 --> 00:10:28.403]  But they're elected.
[00:10:28.403 --> 00:10:33.725]  But Hitler was elected too, and then he became a dictator by expanding the unconstitutional power.
[00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:36.827]  Their Weimar Republic was modeled after our Constitution in many respects.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.043]  So when I say he's becoming a dictator, it's like he's elected, but then he operates dictatorially outside of our law.
[00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:44.683]  Do you understand that?
[00:10:44.683 --> 00:10:45.683]  It's a dictator 2.0.
[00:10:45.683 --> 00:10:51.446]  I want to be clear for the dinosaur media that gets confused by that and goes, Jones claims he's a dictator.
[00:10:51.446 --> 00:10:55.328]  Jones might want to look up the fact that he was elected.
[00:10:55.328 --> 00:10:57.349]  How many angels can dance on the head of a pen?
[00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:13.253]  He is a bureaucratic corporate frontman who carries the water for the offshore corporations that are strip mining and rendering down, extracting, to use the words of Dylan Rattigan, this country.
[00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:15.951]  Guys, I want to play it again.
[00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:24.433]  We've played it probably five times since he said it a year ago and then God basically didn't have his contract renewed despite the fact he had the highest ratings on the Stinking Channel, MSNBC.
[00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:29.373]  We pull up Dylan Rattigan's rant that they're so upset about where he goes, look, forget all this Republican-Democrat.
[00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:30.534]  I'm sick of the fake debate.
[00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:32.114]  You could tell it was totally real.
[00:11:32.114 --> 00:11:33.574]  I got, you know, kids.
[00:11:33.574 --> 00:11:34.594]  There's no future here.
[00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:37.675]  If you don't understand, multinationals are not free market anymore.
[00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:41.135]  They're running a monopoly and they're extracting us.
[00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.156]  They're taking us down.
[00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:42.716]  You understand?
[00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:43.596]  It's not a market.
[00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:44.276]  It's a takeover.
[00:11:46.496 --> 00:11:51.460]  That's a normal response, folks, to watching the whole country burn financially.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.202]  To watching prosperity go out the window.
[00:11:54.202 --> 00:11:56.124]  You already have it that quick?
[00:11:56.124 --> 00:11:59.046]  Yeah, yeah, before I get into this newsroom thing, let's play that again.
[00:11:59.046 --> 00:11:59.827]  Here it is.
[00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:09.695]  We owe $70 trillion to those of you to walk out a $4 trillion solution, which is basically just a way for the Democrats to avoid dealing with this until 2017.
[00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.676]  I'm not here to talk about plans to deal with this until 2017.
[00:12:12.677 --> 00:12:28.534]  I'm saying we've got a real problem and I'm tired of Republicans and Democrats who either want Republicans who want to burn the place to the ground and Democrats with all due respect who want to offer a plan that gets it through the end of their second term of their presidency and then screws me and my kids when it's over!
[00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:29.495]  Okay.
[00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:29.676]  Okay.
[00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:50.039]  Republicans are not doing it.
[00:12:50.039 --> 00:13:01.202]  An entire integrated system, financial system, trading system, taxing system, that was created by both parties over a period of two decades, is at work on our entire country right now.
[00:13:01.202 --> 00:13:10.885]  And we're sitting here arguing about whether we should do the $4 trillion plan that kicks the can down the road for the president for 2017, or burn the place to the ground.
[00:13:10.885 --> 00:13:14.486]  Both of which are reckless, irresponsible, and stupid.
[00:13:14.986 --> 00:13:24.512]  And the fact of the matter is, until we actually, and I'm sorry to lose my temper, but I'll tell you what, I've been coming on TV for three years... Yeah, he's sick of it.
[00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:29.154]  Listen, how did I act when I was on television with Piers Morgan?
[00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:31.236]  Just like that.
[00:13:31.236 --> 00:13:34.037]  That's what reality looks like, folks.
[00:13:34.037 --> 00:13:38.520]  Don't sit here, you red coat, and act like you don't want to take my guns, and act like you're being reasonable.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.642]  Don't sit here and lie to me, in my house, in my country.
[00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:46.817]  You try it, we're not turning our guns in!
[00:13:46.817 --> 00:13:48.717]  It's the same thing with Radigan.
[00:13:48.717 --> 00:13:57.640]  And by the way, that got a huge spike, was on all the TV channels, got tens of millions of views, outside of their own show, so they said goodbye, go down the road.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.520]  You have sanity.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.481]  You have a survival instinct.
[00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:08.202]  You are not a total psychopath.
[00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:09.843]  You have a survival instinct.
[00:14:09.843 --> 00:14:10.723]  You have a brain.
[00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:24.972]  And that's how a man acts when you're fed up and you're hearing a bunch of people debate polishing silverware on the deck of the Titanic as it's about to go under.
[00:14:24.972 --> 00:14:28.114]  And that's why I get so angry.
[00:14:28.114 --> 00:14:33.157]  I had somebody ask me last night, they go, is that an act when you blow up on air sometimes?
[00:14:33.157 --> 00:14:36.319]  And I said, no.
[00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:37.020]  It's not an act.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:44.305]  It's the frustration of being on the air three, four, five hours a day, depending on what day.
[00:14:44.305 --> 00:14:49.189]  Sometimes more, I'm doing interviews and studying all this info and knowing I'm right.
[00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.131]  It's not even hard to know I'm right.
[00:14:51.131 --> 00:14:52.112]  The evidence is everywhere.
[00:14:52.112 --> 00:14:53.733]  It's not my opinion.
[00:14:53.733 --> 00:14:59.879]  And knowing how much trouble we're in, and then maybe out of thousands of hours of broadcast every few months,
[00:15:01.624 --> 00:15:04.306]  Maybe an hour of it I blow up.
[00:15:04.306 --> 00:15:13.652]  I mean who could set up here filibustering on these issues and not blow up when you realize how frustrating it is you want to jump up and down in front of people.
[00:15:13.652 --> 00:15:16.835]  That's a normal human response and say get up.
[00:15:16.835 --> 00:15:18.156]  It'd be like if you were in a lifeboat.
[00:15:18.156 --> 00:15:20.157]  I've used this analogy before.
[00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:23.960]  And there's a hole in the bottom of it and you're in the North Atlantic five miles offshore.
[00:15:24.912 --> 00:15:40.164]  Your ship sunk, you're in a leaking lifeboat, there's 30 people on this big lifeboat, and you're oaring towards it and there's a leak in it, and you tell people, hey, use our cups, use our whatever, bails, help me bail.
[00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:52.884]  And people don't even want to row the boat, they're complaining about their back hurting, they want to be unionized, or they want you to pay them, or they don't want you to tell them what to do, and it's like, you know what, fine.
[00:15:52.884 --> 00:15:58.586]  Everybody's arguing while the boat's sinking into frozen water that will kill us within a few minutes of being in it.
[00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:00.630]  It's called tyranny.
[00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.031]  The boat is sinking.
[00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:03.692]  The water, the waves are coming over it.
[00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:04.893]  More water's coming in.
[00:16:04.893 --> 00:16:08.195]  I'm bailing as fast as I can here, as hard as I can.
[00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:09.876]  And people are like, man, you're sweating.
[00:16:09.876 --> 00:16:11.337]  You're upset.
[00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.878]  You're panicking.
[00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:17.901]  And I'm like, yeah, I'm trying to get the water out of the boat.
[00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:19.362]  And it's not because I'm a hero.
[00:16:19.362 --> 00:16:21.324]  It's not because I'm some great guy, folks.
[00:16:23.163 --> 00:16:24.924]  I don't want to live in a tyranny.
[00:16:24.924 --> 00:16:32.569]  I don't want to see everybody have their 401ks and IRAs taken, as the globalists are openly announcing they're going to do, the bail-ins.
[00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:34.490]  I don't want to see a global meltdown.
[00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.992]  I don't want to see war with Russia and China.
[00:16:36.992 --> 00:16:40.694]  I don't want to see a total police state.
[00:16:40.694 --> 00:16:42.035]  I want prosperity.
[00:16:42.035 --> 00:16:43.136]  I want to live in a free country.
[00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:45.477]  I want my children to have a future.
[00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:49.240]  But there is a decadent madness upon the elite in the West.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.982]  And anybody with money, for that matter, to a certain extent that I run into,
[00:16:52.898 --> 00:16:56.380]  But also the working class have gotten kind of disconnected from reality.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.401]  Either people are waking up more or they're becoming more delusional.
[00:16:59.401 --> 00:17:13.147]  The wheat from the chaff is being separated, the goats from the sheep, and you see this stuff going on and it's so un-American, it's so anti-freedom, you want to yell and scream at people.
[00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.670]  And get them out of their malaise, out of their comfort zone.
[00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.511]  So, I've got all this news here.
[00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:23.974]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20-something stacks.
[00:17:23.974 --> 00:17:25.695]  I can't even count them all.
[00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:30.658]  But this is really the big news, and I'm glad Watson wrote about this a few days ago.
[00:17:31.812 --> 00:17:37.635]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com right now, up at the top of the site.
[00:17:37.635 --> 00:17:47.280]  Not Watson's article, but the Wall Street Journal, because you know, people read our stuff and it's like, oh, the government's not going to come in and tell newsrooms what to write and what to say and what to do.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.481]  You know, that's InfoWars saying that.
[00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:52.783]  I'm glad Drudge linked to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:17:53.763 --> 00:18:01.106]  And to Fox News, for folks that think we're making this stuff up, you need to go there and you need to go actually read the media, period.
[00:18:01.106 --> 00:18:07.468]  I don't care what you call yourself, old line, dinosaur, left, right, libertarian, whatever you call yourself, independent.
[00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:08.489]  You should go read this.
[00:18:08.489 --> 00:18:10.729]  FCC waves into newsrooms.
[00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:16.832]  Why is the agency studying perceived station bias and asking about coverage choices?
[00:18:16.832 --> 00:18:19.773]  They're going to send agents into
[00:18:21.528 --> 00:18:29.236]  All media organizations that are picked up anywhere by broadcast, they're claiming jurisdiction of this office even though we don't broadcast from here.
[00:18:29.236 --> 00:18:35.322]  That is, nothing's being broadcast UHF, VHF, FM, AM, shortwave out of this office.
[00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:41.528]  We send it out on feeds, digital feeds to satellites and things that then get picked up and are retransmitted terrestrially.
[00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:45.149]  But they're now claiming this jurisdictional power grab under Obama.
[00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:59.832]  So since the days of Bruce Fine heading up the FCC as their lawyer, under Reagan getting rid of Fairness Doctrine to bring back free speech, and a new golden age of freedom of speech, vanguarding into the internet, we've had a march towards more freedom of speech.
[00:18:59.832 --> 00:19:06.673]  Now under our Lord and Savior, in the words of Jamie Foxx, Obama, Barack Obama,
[00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:09.166]  Our Lord and Savior.
[00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:09.947]  I'm not being blasphemous.
[00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:10.987]  I'm repeating Jamie Foxx here.
[00:19:10.987 --> 00:19:12.449]  I'm not being racist.
[00:19:12.449 --> 00:19:14.110]  He is our Lord and Savior, according to Jamie Foxx.
[00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.893]  And if you don't believe that, you're racist.
[00:19:16.893 --> 00:19:20.977]  Now they're going to be trying to send bureaucrats out.
[00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:24.680]  And they're going to try to send them here to do their little inspections.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.442]  So just think about that in America, folks.
[00:19:27.442 --> 00:19:28.443]  Here's Fox News.
[00:19:29.719 --> 00:19:32.520]  Why the FCC should keep its nose out of newsrooms.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.500]  Yes, that's what we should be hearing.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:41.582]  Keep your stinking, ugly, disgusting, pus-covered, devil snouts, wolf snouts out of our newsrooms.
[00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:47.844]  That's what Ted Cruz is saying about the harassment of secret Republican and Libertarian groups in Hollywood.
[00:19:47.844 --> 00:19:52.906]  The group rightly refused a request from the IRS to reveal the names of its members as Republican Senator from Texas.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.468]  FOA should respond, Friends of Abe, to the IRS as it would to any McCarthyite request for information.

[00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:03.332]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:21:03.332 --> 00:21:08.476]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:16.583]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:21.128]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:21:21.128 --> 00:21:24.931]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:31.035]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:34.197]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:21:34.197 --> 00:21:39.581]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:22:00.374 --> 00:22:05.176]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:06.997]  But not all silver is equal.
[00:22:06.997 --> 00:22:13.881]  Supernatural silver is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal
[00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:14.921]  We're good to go!

[00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:05.441]  Because cigarettes have met their match.
[00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:08.144]  Smokers are switching to Vaporite e-liquid by Le Cig.

[00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:07.873]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:10.175]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:28.640]  Folks, we're back live.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:40.567]  Paul Watson is going to be joining us from the UK studios of InfoWars in his in-depth research on what is behind the situation in Ukraine.
[00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:50.954]  And I want to be totally clear, I'm not choosing sides between the Catholics and the Orthodox and the different groups that balkanize the country.
[00:24:50.954 --> 00:24:53.155]  Or the pro-Russian side, the pro-EU side.
[00:24:54.517 --> 00:25:12.372]  Bottom line though, hands down we can prove that George Soros, the National Endowment for Democracy, the State Department, Hillary Clinton, and the usual suspects like Hitler, have been involved at every level.
[00:25:12.372 --> 00:25:17.476]  And have started it, and told the Ukrainians, be nice, don't resist the violent protesters,
[00:25:19.295 --> 00:25:27.879]  The West won't criticize you and now the arms have been served out to the operatives and they're shooting people in mass so the Ukrainians are getting ready to crush them with the military.
[00:25:27.879 --> 00:25:33.381]  And if it gets bad enough, the Russian military will come in.
[00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:35.402]  And it is a serious situation.
[00:25:35.402 --> 00:25:37.383]  The truce has been broken.
[00:25:37.383 --> 00:25:40.364]  The city is burning in many areas of Kiev, their capital.
[00:25:40.364 --> 00:25:43.546]  We're going to be breaking that down with Paul Watson in the next segment.
[00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:46.067]  It is a big, big deal.
[00:25:47.131 --> 00:25:53.613]  And the reason it looks so much like Syria, as Lew Rockwell writes today, is because it's another proxy war.
[00:25:53.613 --> 00:25:58.234]  And it's a very dangerous situation.
[00:25:58.234 --> 00:25:59.755]  Here's some of the headlines on that subject.
[00:25:59.755 --> 00:26:06.196]  Violence in Ukraine creates a deepening clash between East and West.
[00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:07.297]  That's in the New York Times.
[00:26:07.297 --> 00:26:11.058]  As deaths rise in Kiev, so do fears Ukraine will use troops.
[00:26:12.388 --> 00:26:17.731]  And I've got quotes by Obama here about, you should not use force on the peaceful demonstrators.
[00:26:17.731 --> 00:26:19.571]  They're not peaceful.
[00:26:19.571 --> 00:26:27.355]  And again, people are like, Alex, well, don't you like people beating cops and fighting the government?
[00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:31.077]  No, I don't ever like police beating innocent, peaceful protesters.
[00:26:31.077 --> 00:26:37.820]  And I call them thugs, scum, cowards, wherever they do it, whether it's in China or the US, Ukraine or Moscow.
[00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:43.258]  But I don't like the police order to stand down while they're shot.
[00:26:43.258 --> 00:26:53.586]  See, I like justice, folks, and I can look at something and watch a bunch of western-backed stooges with guns shooting police that don't even shoot back.
[00:26:53.586 --> 00:27:03.153]  And I know a provocation for nationwide civil war and carnage and the destruction of another sovereign country so it can be sucked up the New World Order vacuum cleaner.
[00:27:06.889 --> 00:27:10.810]  See, I don't attack people until they attack me.
[00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.772]  See, I follow common law, the Bible.
[00:27:14.772 --> 00:27:16.572]  I don't even need to read the Bible, folks.
[00:27:16.572 --> 00:27:19.753]  Common sense is written on my heart.
[00:27:19.753 --> 00:27:22.874]  It's called common sense, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:26.435]  That you don't attack somebody first.
[00:27:26.435 --> 00:27:29.676]  That you don't go out and stir up trouble first.
[00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:31.537]  That you try to take the high road first.
[00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:39.328]  And I'm quite frankly surprised those police haven't mowed down thousands of people.
[00:27:39.328 --> 00:27:42.849]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[00:27:42.849 --> 00:28:00.112]  Also, if you have like a Chinese regime like in the late 1980s with Tiananmen Square, I'll just get into this now, and they've been persecuting and killing and shooting people for years and oppressing, and then the public started shooting back to overthrow them?
[00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:00.832]  I would back that.
[00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:07.223]  But the Ukrainian government, compared to many of the past governments they've had, has been moderate.
[00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:12.946]  And they've been trying to work out a deal with the EU and Russia to just have joint support and build up their country.
[00:28:12.946 --> 00:28:14.226]  And the globalists don't want that.
[00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:17.128]  They want to bring them down.
[00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:23.911]  So I've actually studied the situation, and it's just not warranted to go shoot the first cop you see on the street.
[00:28:24.847 --> 00:28:34.454]  That's not some cop-worshipping event, as I saw some people criticizing yesterday's show on InfoWars.com in the comments and I saw on YouTube.
[00:28:34.454 --> 00:28:44.121]  You know, I just am not for starting big bloody French Revolution civil wars, where you go around murdering and killing, when your main general funding you is George Soros.
[00:28:44.121 --> 00:28:45.462]  You know, I think that's what it is.
[00:28:46.798 --> 00:28:54.124]  George Soros is one of their main ring-wraith Nazgul leaders funding this on record.
[00:28:54.124 --> 00:28:56.286]  Paul Watson's coming up to break it all down.
[00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:57.747]  And that's why I'm against it.
[00:28:57.747 --> 00:29:02.432]  The very same UN globalists that are financing open borders and taking my guns and
[00:29:03.444 --> 00:29:05.625]  Government-run healthcare and every other nightmare.
[00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:07.365]  The people that give us bad things.
[00:29:07.365 --> 00:29:08.906]  The people that give us bad fruit.
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:15.968]  The people that lie to us and cheat us and fund Al-Qaeda and blow up churches in Syria and all over the Middle East.
[00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:20.049]  The same ones arming Al-Qaeda so they can retake parts of Western Iraq right now.
[00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:26.611]  The same ones showing discord so they can bring in world government on the ashes of national sovereignty.
[00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:31.432]  They're the ones telling me what great freedom fighters these Ukrainians are.
[00:29:33.407 --> 00:29:35.127]  And I'm sure those Ukrainians have got a beef.
[00:29:35.127 --> 00:29:39.509]  I'm sure some cop roughed them up once, or they didn't like the taxes, or something went on.
[00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:47.411]  The point is, is that they're being used to bring their country completely down, and I've weighed it all, and it's evil.
[00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:50.031]  What's happening in Ukraine is being run by the New World Order.
[00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:51.432]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.432 --> 00:29:53.972]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.972 --> 00:29:56.613]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.589 --> 00:30:11.273]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:11.273 --> 00:30:13.334]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:13.334 --> 00:30:14.214]  Fluoride!
[00:30:14.214 --> 00:30:16.135]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:16.135 --> 00:30:22.457]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:27.623]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:27.623 --> 00:30:33.949]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:30:33.949 --> 00:30:36.372]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:30:36.372 --> 00:30:39.315]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:42.679]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:48.245]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:48.245 --> 00:30:53.330]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:09.643]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:09.643 --> 00:31:18.047]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:18.047 --> 00:31:22.930]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:29.053]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars Life
[00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:29.754]  I don't think so.
[00:31:48.391 --> 00:31:51.772]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:31:51.772 --> 00:31:53.653]  You will be supporting a free press.
[00:31:53.653 --> 00:31:58.075]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:31:58.075 --> 00:32:00.556]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.556 --> 00:32:01.576]  The facts are in.
[00:32:01.576 --> 00:32:02.977]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:02.977 --> 00:32:10.500]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.921]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:14.301 --> 00:32:14.881]  Simple.
[00:32:14.881 --> 00:32:19.604]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:25.308]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:25.308 --> 00:32:30.871]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Lite Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:41.318]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:32:41.638 --> 00:32:46.221]  Let's take a stand against the Globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:48.382]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[00:32:53.945 --> 00:32:58.348]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:32:58.348 --> 00:32:59.629]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:01.164 --> 00:33:03.426]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:03.426 --> 00:33:05.828]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:05.828 --> 00:33:10.553]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:10.553 --> 00:33:15.938]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm Central.
[00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:29.570]  It's so frustrating, as I was saying earlier, when you're informed geopolitically.
[00:33:44.847 --> 00:33:47.788]  And you see the general public, one-fourth of which in the U.S.
[00:33:47.788 --> 00:33:49.549]  don't even know that the Earth orbits the Sun.
[00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:59.113]  99% of people, if you go to a trendy area, will sign a petition to ban water, if it's for Al Gore or for Obama.
[00:33:59.113 --> 00:34:08.977]  If you use the term dihydrogen monoxide, you realize that these people are literally dumber than a box of rocks and helpless.
[00:34:08.977 --> 00:34:11.078]  And then, when you actually study something like Kony 2012,
[00:34:12.731 --> 00:34:26.301]  Or you study something like the new video they put out a month or so ago to launch the latest activities in the border region with Russia, Ukraine, centered in the capital Kiev.
[00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:43.942]  You even go to the videos that our media is calling grassroots independent that are being aired by CNN, MSNBC, and others, and push, like Kony2012, and there it is, funded by the State Department, funded by Soros Group, openly being run by the CIA.
[00:34:43.942 --> 00:34:47.465]  This is incredible.
[00:34:47.465 --> 00:34:53.670]  And, again, this is not the CIA trying to overthrow some communist dictator in a third world, like in your granddaddy's CIA.
[00:34:55.094 --> 00:34:57.096]  That had its own problems.
[00:34:57.096 --> 00:35:14.611]  This is a CIA wanting to put in kleptocratic socialist EU systems to absolutely bankrupt Ukraine, bring in one-child policies through taxes, Agenda 21, just hellish social engineering you see going on everywhere they're in control.
[00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:20.095]  And Paul Watson did a great job in a video and in an article that's up on InfoWars.com right now
[00:35:21.397 --> 00:35:26.883]  Exposed Ukrainian protester backed by Kony 2012 style scam.
[00:35:26.883 --> 00:35:35.874]  Now remember, we exposed Kony 2012 and I have to say, they even put a video out responding to us admitting it, that this radio show was the main
[00:35:38.683 --> 00:35:51.568]  Program and a video we put out that DrudgeReport.com carried, give credit where it stood, that exposed they were funded by government and by big liberal think tanks that wanted to be able to invade all of Africa.
[00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:57.450]  And then they went to Congress to get a month after that came out, right on time, and had like 50 million views or whatever it was.
[00:35:58.690 --> 00:35:59.831]  It was more than that.
[00:35:59.831 --> 00:36:01.112]  It was a hundred and something million.
[00:36:01.112 --> 00:36:06.256]  They came to him and said, we need a resolution to invade anywhere in Africa, anyone aiding Kony or anyone like him.
[00:36:06.256 --> 00:36:08.879]  It was a blank declaration of war, basically.
[00:36:08.879 --> 00:36:10.700]  Blank check.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.204]  To just go in and take over all these regions and actually put radical Muslims in, in some cases.
[00:36:15.204 --> 00:36:22.390]  Like in the case of the Ivory Coast in Africa, their own government came out and said, there are NATO troops here with AFRICOM in the U.S.
[00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.572]  putting a radical Islamist in charge.
[00:36:25.768 --> 00:36:28.590]  You know, Kony hadn't been seen now in seven plus years.
[00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.871]  At the time of the filming, it had been six.
[00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:33.192]  It's almost eight years.
[00:36:33.192 --> 00:36:34.193]  He's been dead.
[00:36:34.193 --> 00:36:36.894]  He controlled a few hundred square miles in the middle of nowhere.
[00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:43.318]  To give you an idea, that'd be like having a bandit in South Texas that didn't leave one county and saying, we have to bomb the whole U.S.
[00:36:43.318 --> 00:36:49.381]  to find one guy, hadn't been seen in seven, eight years, who was in one county in South Texas.
[00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:51.162]  I mean, this is like, here's Kony, he's scary.
[00:36:51.162 --> 00:36:51.983]  Remember all that?
[00:36:53.342 --> 00:36:57.903]  Turns out the very same group that funded Kony funded this new video we're about to play.
[00:36:57.903 --> 00:37:01.024]  And I say this new when it came out a month ago.
[00:37:01.024 --> 00:37:02.525]  And no one else did this.
[00:37:02.525 --> 00:37:10.047]  We went and looked at the footer on it and a bunch of the other videos and they don't even hide it.
[00:37:10.047 --> 00:37:11.347]  This was run by the U.S.
[00:37:11.347 --> 00:37:12.847]  government.
[00:37:12.847 --> 00:37:14.608]  By the criminals that have hijacked it, I want to be clear.
[00:37:15.652 --> 00:37:19.214]  And then now Obama's like, now it's too early to call for military action.
[00:37:19.214 --> 00:37:28.899]  We need to not have military action ourselves, but don't you use your military, Ukraine, to put down these people that are burning half your country down, half of Kiev down, and shooting police.
[00:37:28.899 --> 00:37:32.081]  And obviously, they've run the police back all the way to the Parliament.
[00:37:32.081 --> 00:37:35.262]  They're about to take the government, and the police have started shooting people.
[00:37:35.262 --> 00:37:41.145]  It looks like it is snipers shooting protest leaders, who've been leading armed attacks on the government.
[00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:50.510]  Again, if they weren't outside-backed, if the Ukrainian government was really oppressive, I'd say these folks are heroes.
[00:37:50.510 --> 00:38:02.273]  No, they're backed by the same banks that have hijacked our country off of manufactured trendy videos to get their youth out there, useful idiots, and they're trying to implode that country into the EU.
[00:38:02.273 --> 00:38:09.315]  And so now Obama warns Kiev it's responsible for avoiding bloodshed.
[00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:10.727]  It's admittedly fake.
[00:38:33.453 --> 00:38:37.697]  On CNN live feeds on accident they put out going, you're prepared for now the fake shooting?
[00:38:37.697 --> 00:38:39.158]  Alright, bring in dead bodies!
[00:38:39.158 --> 00:38:41.039]  Shoot in 10 seconds!
[00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:42.260]  I am here, CNN!
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.181]  There are dead bodies!
[00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:43.902]  They're shooting!
[00:38:43.902 --> 00:38:44.662]  Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:38:44.662 --> 00:38:47.845]  I mean, you know, it is... Remember all that stuff?
[00:38:47.845 --> 00:38:49.786]  And the fake chemical attacks?
[00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:53.069]  That it turned out were launched by Al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia?
[00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:55.511]  To blame it on Assad?
[00:38:55.511 --> 00:39:01.836]  I mean, this is too much, folks, so that the Al-Qaeda forces could blow up hundreds of churches the week of Christmas?
[00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:02.717]  Catholic and Orthodox?
[00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:09.645]  This is just the globalists chewing up sovereign countries, destroying them through proxy wars.
[00:39:09.645 --> 00:39:12.707]  I'm going to go to Paul Watson with his detailed breakdown of this.
[00:39:12.707 --> 00:39:15.108]  This is a big deal, folks.
[00:39:15.108 --> 00:39:17.870]  And right after we exposed Kony, they blew up.
[00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.852]  They don't care, though.
[00:39:19.852 --> 00:39:26.436]  Exclusive, Ben Affleck to testify before Congress as an Africa expert.
[00:39:26.436 --> 00:39:28.878]  That's in foreign policy put out by the Washington Post.
[00:39:30.319 --> 00:39:35.781]  Ben Affleck, the guy that flies private jets exclusively, I happen to know for a fact, who said, hey, let the TSA do whatever you want.
[00:39:35.781 --> 00:39:36.901]  Shut up and go along with it.
[00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:41.083]  An arrogant establishment PUD.
[00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:42.623]  Worse than Angelina Jolie.
[00:39:42.623 --> 00:39:46.645]  Just total, absolute pieces of garbage fakes.
[00:39:48.848 --> 00:39:52.871]  With his little CIA produced films about Iran and all this.
[00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:54.351]  What a disgusting joke.
[00:39:54.351 --> 00:39:58.034]  So he's now pushing the next wave of Kony invasion of Africa.
[00:39:58.034 --> 00:39:59.175]  For resources.
[00:39:59.175 --> 00:40:00.836]  Not even for the US.
[00:40:00.836 --> 00:40:02.096]  For the globalists.
[00:40:02.096 --> 00:40:07.160]  This is conquest and colonialism under the name of peace prize trendiness.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:15.345]  So let's go to the latest Kony 12 hoax video produced by the Endowment for Democracy, the State Department, George Soros, and the usual suspects.
[00:40:16.517 --> 00:40:19.980]  I am the Ukrainian, the native of Kiev.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.282]  And now I am on Maidan, on the central part of my city.
[00:40:24.282 --> 00:40:30.747]  I want you to know why thousands of people all over my country are on the streets.
[00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:34.270]  There is only one reason.
[00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.133]  We want to be free from a dictatorship.
[00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:42.880]  We want to be free from the politicians who work only for themselves.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.885]  Who are ready to shoot, to beat, to injure people.
[00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:54.391]  Just for saving their money, just for saving their houses, just to saving their power.
[00:40:54.391 --> 00:40:59.555]  I want these people who are here have dignity, who are brave.
[00:40:59.555 --> 00:41:01.996]  I want them to live a normal life.
[00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:06.179]  We are civilized people, but our government are barbarians.
[00:41:06.179 --> 00:41:08.461]  That's not a Soviet Union.
[00:41:08.461 --> 00:41:11.423]  We want our courts not to be corrupted.
[00:41:11.423 --> 00:41:13.305]  We want to be free.
[00:41:15.091 --> 00:41:23.614]  I know that maybe tomorrow we'll have no phone, no internet connection, and we will be alone here.
[00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:29.616]  And maybe policemen will murder us one after another when it will be dark here.
[00:41:34.728 --> 00:41:37.870]  That's why I ask you now to help us.
[00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:41.111]  We have this freedom inside our hearts.
[00:41:41.111 --> 00:41:44.312]  We have this freedom in our minds.
[00:41:44.312 --> 00:41:48.274]  And now I ask you to build this freedom in our country.
[00:41:48.274 --> 00:41:54.657]  You can help us only by telling this story to your friends, only by sharing this video.
[00:41:54.657 --> 00:41:56.998]  Please, share it.
[00:41:56.998 --> 00:42:02.361]  Speak to your friends, speak to your family, speak to your government and show that you support us.
[00:42:05.805 --> 00:42:09.686]  Please contact representatives of the man they support, the Ukraine people, and their fight for freedom and democracy.
[00:42:09.686 --> 00:42:10.866]  Of course you're late.
[00:42:10.866 --> 00:42:15.287]  And then you go follow the footer on it, and Paul Watson has this in his video and on the article.
[00:42:15.287 --> 00:42:22.048]  The guys actually go to that video on YouTube and show TV viewers now, click on the footer of it, and it's Endowment for Democracy.
[00:42:22.048 --> 00:42:24.128]  And they're acting like it was made grassroots.
[00:42:24.128 --> 00:42:27.709]  Now again, if the Ukrainians really want to overthrow their government, that's their issue.
[00:42:27.709 --> 00:42:28.669]  And I'd be supportive of it.
[00:42:28.669 --> 00:42:32.430]  But this is the globalists that want to overthrow it.
[00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.870]  To bring in their whole agenda of, you know,
[00:42:37.116 --> 00:42:38.597]  You see it here in America.
[00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:41.199]  It absolutely wrecked that country.
[00:42:41.199 --> 00:42:47.703]  And they show images of police brutality in there, which I'm sure go on in every country and is wrong.
[00:42:47.703 --> 00:42:54.207]  So they're getting everybody mad to go out and attack the police and overthrow the government.
[00:42:54.207 --> 00:43:00.010]  And then Obama calls them peaceful protesters when they shoot police.
[00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.831]  That's peaceful.
[00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:03.732]  I've got quotes here of Obama yesterday.
[00:43:03.732 --> 00:43:05.914]  These are peaceful protesters.
[00:43:05.914 --> 00:43:06.014]  And
[00:43:07.642 --> 00:43:11.324]  Here it is, Obama warns Ukraine against military action on protesters.
[00:43:11.324 --> 00:43:13.185]  I'm looking for the exact quote here.
[00:43:13.185 --> 00:43:14.865]  I was reading it in my stack this morning.
[00:43:14.865 --> 00:43:18.587]  Obama says, do not use force on peaceful protesters.
[00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:25.070]  Well, the problem is, they're not peaceful protesters.
[00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.811]  And again, they are outside-backed.
[00:43:26.811 --> 00:43:29.513]  And of course, there's always going to be multi-sides to every deal.
[00:43:29.513 --> 00:43:32.214]  I'm not saying this is a perfect black and white issue.
[00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:38.501]  All I know is it's a serious situation and it's being orchestrated from the outside.
[00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:51.787]  Paul Joseph Watson, who has really broken this down and done deep research on it, where do you see this going and break down how big this hoax is?
[00:43:53.223 --> 00:43:54.564]  Well, good to be back Alex.
[00:43:54.564 --> 00:43:57.887]  You mentioned a couple of minutes ago, CNN.
[00:43:57.887 --> 00:44:03.853]  This video that you just played, which last night had about a million and a half viewers, now it's got closer to four million.
[00:44:03.853 --> 00:44:05.774]  It's gone completely viral.
[00:44:05.774 --> 00:44:11.239]  The young lady in that video will appear tonight on CNN's Anderson Cooper.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:27.086]  Who of course was instrumental in pushing the Kony 2012 scam and the fake Syria Danny scam which used fake staged footage from YouTube videos to push for US military intervention in Syria.
[00:44:27.086 --> 00:44:31.488]  So, Cooper's done the same thing with Kony, did the same thing with Syria Danny.
[00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:34.409]  In both cases, we completely eviscerated him.
[00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:39.094]  Siri or Danny disappeared off into the wilderness, never to be seen again.
[00:44:39.094 --> 00:44:43.378]  Kony, the director of Kony 2012, had a breakdown that collapsed.
[00:44:43.378 --> 00:44:45.480]  But they're still coming back with the same tactic.
[00:44:46.226 --> 00:44:52.349]  And all I did with this video, Alex, was, as you said, click on the homepage for the YouTube channel.
[00:44:52.349 --> 00:45:01.814]  And in that description, the makers of this video brag about how their inspiration was a guy called Larry Diamond.
[00:45:01.814 --> 00:45:06.516]  This is the guy they worked with to produce another documentary as well as this video.
[00:45:06.516 --> 00:45:15.321]  Diamond works closely with the National Endowment for Democracy, the NED, and the US Agency for International Development, USAID.
[00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:20.765]  Now the NED is widely acknowledged to basically be a CIA front.
[00:45:20.765 --> 00:45:29.712]  It's been embroiled in numerous colour revolutions, fake faux uprisings since its inception in 1983.
[00:45:29.712 --> 00:45:45.285]  And in fact it was involved in Ukraine in 2004, in that staged, provocateur, instigated uprising which saw the US puppet Yushchenko come to power, who actually the current Ukrainian president replaced.
[00:45:45.845 --> 00:45:50.107]  So it's the same faces involved again.
[00:45:50.107 --> 00:45:53.488]  Diamond was also involved in the Arab Spring.
[00:45:53.488 --> 00:46:07.915]  He was actually the guy who trained the Arab Spring State Department activists back in 2008 how to use Twitter and Facebook in instigating these faux stage revolutions.
[00:46:07.915 --> 00:46:10.036]  So he's been the key point man
[00:46:10.396 --> 00:46:24.822]  Not only in places like South Africa back 20 years ago where he worked with George Soros' Open Society Institute to get in the kind of government that would acquiesce to Western IMF-NATO interests back then after apartheid.
[00:46:24.822 --> 00:46:27.283]  He did it again in Ukraine in 2004.
[00:46:27.283 --> 00:46:30.045]  He did it again with the Arab Spring.
[00:46:30.045 --> 00:46:36.427]  And now he's the inspiration behind this supposedly grassroots video.
[00:46:36.427 --> 00:46:37.748]  And if you noticed in the clip
[00:46:38.308 --> 00:46:44.752]  This young lady, she says, help us only by telling this story, only by sharing this video.
[00:46:44.752 --> 00:46:55.800]  So she's insistent that people believe this glib, simplistic propaganda and emotional manipulation, just as they did with the Kony 2012 scam.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:05.206]  Because as you've talked about over the past week and more, the real agenda in Ukraine, the real story behind the crisis, is infinitely more complex
[00:47:05.726 --> 00:47:10.768]  than a bunch of people fighting for freedom and democracy.
[00:47:10.768 --> 00:47:17.131]  Well, America loses its soft power and its good name doing immoral stuff like this, and the rest of the world knows.
[00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:22.574]  If the American people don't know all this is fake, on average, the rest of the world does, and I don't want it under my name.
[00:47:22.574 --> 00:47:33.339]  I know the world appreciates the fact that we're exposing this, but you get in your video that I saw you do last night for InfoWars.com, and it's in your article, Paul, that's up on InfoWars.com, that again, the very same groups
[00:47:34.339 --> 00:47:37.722]  Involve funding the Ukraine overthrow funded this video.
[00:47:37.722 --> 00:47:41.605]  Talk about that State Department connected endowment for democracy.
[00:47:43.578 --> 00:47:45.439]  Yeah, that's Larry Diamond.
[00:47:45.439 --> 00:47:49.022]  He was involved, as I said, in the 2004 uprising.
[00:47:49.022 --> 00:47:55.507]  He actually was a major apologist for Obama before Obama was even elected back in early 2008.
[00:47:55.507 --> 00:48:01.951]  He wrote a Huffington Post article downplaying all of Obama's scandals and corruption.
[00:48:01.951 --> 00:48:11.278]  Again, he's worked closely with George Soros, the Open Society Institute, who's actually one of the main protest groups in Ukraine, is openly funded
[00:48:11.838 --> 00:48:15.981]  And now it seems armed by the Open Society Institute.
[00:48:15.981 --> 00:48:26.987]  You have Bloomberg reporting that the protesters are now being bussed in and they jump off the bus with backpacks and weapons ready to go to battle.
[00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:35.552]  So even if you believe that this was an organic protest back in November when it started, it's being completely hijacked by these same globalist forces again.
[00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:41.936]  Another key point is obviously the Newland leaked phone conversation.
[00:48:41.936 --> 00:48:50.003]  She was caught on tape with a top US diplomat planning which puppet leaders they would put into power.
[00:48:50.003 --> 00:48:54.287]  Primarily Vitaly Klitschko, who's the leader of the UDAR party opposition.
[00:48:54.927 --> 00:49:07.856]  So openly they've been caught on tape choosing which puppet leaders to put into power and the media still treats this whole narrative as some kind of Russian conspiracy theory when the evidence is there.
[00:49:07.856 --> 00:49:11.639]  They've been caught admitting that this is the agenda behind the Ukrainian protests.
[00:49:13.007 --> 00:49:17.488]  And Paul, expanding on that, again, there's beefs on both sides.
[00:49:17.488 --> 00:49:19.449]  We're not even trying to take sides.
[00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:26.291]  Under international law, common sense, common law, whoever starts something first, generally, is in the wrong.
[00:49:26.291 --> 00:49:28.732]  And if you're an outsider starting it, you're even more in the wrong.
[00:49:29.292 --> 00:49:30.733]  And it's not even America doing this.
[00:49:30.733 --> 00:49:42.781]  It's this globalist cabal doing it, and they tried to finance the Obama people, the Occupy Wall Street at first, to try to get a national movement going that they could control politically to destabilize the country.
[00:49:42.781 --> 00:49:53.388]  But when it didn't become partisan and they couldn't control it, it was the Obama Justice Department in 36 cities that ordered concerted mass roundups and attacks on Occupy.
[00:49:54.028 --> 00:49:58.329]  So they would like to do similar color revolutions here.
[00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:03.031]  In fact, Al Gore has said we need an Arab Spring here by the left.
[00:50:03.031 --> 00:50:04.411]  We've seen Soros say that.
[00:50:04.411 --> 00:50:13.854]  So what we're seeing them do in Ukraine and Syria is stuff they're going to try under race politics in the future here in North America.
[00:50:13.854 --> 00:50:16.295]  So this is very important to study and watch.
[00:50:17.722 --> 00:50:20.544]  And, you know, with Obama calling them peaceful protesters.
[00:50:20.544 --> 00:50:31.451]  Imagine if Tea Party insurrectionists, you know, with weapons and Molotov cocktails were storming government buildings in DC, seizing control of police stations, shooting at police.
[00:50:31.451 --> 00:50:34.033]  Would Obama call them peaceful protesters?
[00:50:34.033 --> 00:50:36.094]  It's the same thing we saw in Syria.
[00:50:36.094 --> 00:50:45.761]  You know, it started as a peaceful protest and the media was still calling them peaceful demonstrators when they were driving around tanks and had, you know, rocket-propelled grenades.
[00:50:45.761 --> 00:50:46.341]  That's right, stay there.
[00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:47.542]  I mean, when is this insanity going to stop?
[00:50:47.702 --> 00:50:50.604]  Well Sid, I want to come back and see where you think this is going, the latest developments.
[00:50:50.604 --> 00:50:51.945]  By the way, I want to say something.
[00:50:51.945 --> 00:50:55.227]  The Tea Party is mainly the veterans, that's why the Globalists say it's the number one enemy.
[00:50:55.227 --> 00:50:59.770]  If the veterans try to attack the government, they will defeat the government in one hour.
[00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:00.950]  One hour.
[00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.851]  Introducing ProOne.

[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.682]  What's making Americans sick and fat?
[00:52:02.682 --> 00:52:05.003]  It's too many GMO foods and toxins.
[00:52:05.003 --> 00:52:06.865]  Destroying our digestive systems.
[00:52:06.865 --> 00:52:09.667]  Causing poor digestion and suppressed immune systems.
[00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:15.531]  A suppressed immune system prevents clear thinking and the ability to fight the corporate and big pharma agendas.

[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:09.657]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:09.657 --> 00:53:10.457]  This capitalism?
[00:53:10.457 --> 00:53:16.620]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.322]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:32.696]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[00:53:32.696 --> 00:53:35.537]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[00:53:35.537 --> 00:53:40.379]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[00:53:40.379 --> 00:53:45.701]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.

[00:54:04.036 --> 00:54:05.657]  Alright folks, we're back live with Paul Watson.
[00:54:05.657 --> 00:54:11.920]  He'll be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:19.505]  Then we're going to open the phones up and cover a ton of other geopolitical, financial, gun news, police state news, Obamacare news, in the next hour.
[00:54:19.505 --> 00:54:27.549]  I want to show you DiscoveringTheNetworks.org, the guy to the political left.
[00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:30.491]  And this is just the Soros group.
[00:54:32.572 --> 00:54:48.396]  The Open Society group that he heads up, the Democracy Alliance, the Shadow Party, the Shared Agendas of George Soros, and it says here they have 1.9 billion dollars.
[00:54:48.396 --> 00:54:54.097]  And they're involved with their eyeballs right now with what's happening over in the Ukraine.
[00:54:54.097 --> 00:54:59.539]  So, remember, the people that want your guns, the people that want to make little kids have abortions,
[00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:05.223]  You know, your 12-year-old gets pregnant, they want the school to make the decision to have them have an abortion, not you.
[00:55:05.223 --> 00:55:10.872]  The absolute evil scum are the ones behind this, so that's all I need to know.
[00:55:10.872 --> 00:55:11.233]  Right there.
[00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:14.210]  And it's truly disgusting.
[00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.853]  Here's Obama's actual quote from his speech in Mexico yesterday.
[00:55:32.449 --> 00:55:36.335]  There will be conscious if people step over the line.
[00:55:36.335 --> 00:55:40.761]  And now they're calling for sanctions against the Ukraine and escalation.
[00:55:40.761 --> 00:55:43.765]  Of course, this is all happening while the Russians run the Olympics.
[00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:51.633]  And so they're hoping the Russians won't pour into Ukraine there to try to stabilize things.
[00:55:51.633 --> 00:55:53.874]  Again, I'm not romanticizing the Russians either.
[00:55:53.874 --> 00:55:56.174]  The point is they're not the ones starting this, Paul.
[00:55:56.174 --> 00:56:00.415]  They've been in a very restrained position, and smartly so, even if they're evil.
[00:56:00.415 --> 00:56:04.477]  I don't know if they're evil, but I'm saying it's smart to have the moral high ground.
[00:56:04.477 --> 00:56:05.557]  What do you make of all this?
[00:56:05.557 --> 00:56:06.677]  Where do you think it's going, Paul?
[00:56:06.677 --> 00:56:08.798]  I know you track it very closely from London.
[00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:18.710]  Well, of course it started back in November when the Ukrainian government signed this trade pact with Russia, rejecting one with the EU at the last minute.
[00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:24.153]  That started the wave of these pro-EU protests, supposedly against corruption.
[00:56:24.153 --> 00:56:26.034]  Now, Alex, I find it a little odd that
[00:56:26.474 --> 00:56:35.779]  Protesters who are siding with the EU are anti-corruption since the European Union is notoriously one of the most corrupt institutions on the planet.
[00:56:35.779 --> 00:56:42.864]  In fact, the cost of EU corruption on an annual basis is the same as Ukraine's entire GDP.
[00:56:43.684 --> 00:56:51.730]  So, they're against corruption in the Ukrainian government, but they're siding with an institution that is inherently corrupt, so that makes no sense.
[00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:59.295]  The sanctions that you just mentioned, which the EU are about to bring forth, are aimed at disarming the police.
[00:56:59.935 --> 00:57:08.121]  They're taking away the weapons that the police are using to defend government buildings against these rebels, these insurrectionists.
[00:57:08.121 --> 00:57:10.523]  So that's about disarming the police.
[00:57:10.523 --> 00:57:14.466]  And as he said, it's the geopolitical isolation of Russia.
[00:57:14.466 --> 00:57:16.388]  They will try and condemn Russia.
[00:57:16.388 --> 00:57:21.532]  I mean, Alex, we bashed Putin and Russia for 10 years or so.
[00:57:21.532 --> 00:57:25.735]  You know, back 10 years ago, I wrote countless articles bashing Putin.
[00:57:25.735 --> 00:57:28.758]  He was an authoritarian, corrupt leader.
[00:57:29.238 --> 00:57:36.562]  But he's not going to risk a new Cold War, a new global war, for a turf battle, which is what this is about.
[00:57:36.562 --> 00:57:37.442]  It's a tug of war.
[00:57:37.442 --> 00:57:42.444]  It's about getting on the Russian frontier and circling Moscow with NATO bases.
[00:57:42.444 --> 00:57:44.966]  That's part of the agenda they've been pursuing for years and years.
[00:57:45.982 --> 00:57:52.966]  Also with this video, the guy behind it, the inspiration behind it, Larry Diamond, is also a CFR member.
[00:57:52.966 --> 00:57:56.649]  Of course the CFR is basically a front for the State Department.
[00:57:56.649 --> 00:58:05.414]  Hillary Clinton joked that she would only have to walk down the road to get her instructions because the CFR and the State Department are basically right next to each other.
[00:58:05.414 --> 00:58:13.659]  The creator of the video gave an interview to the Huffington Post where he said he was in Ukraine before any of the protests even started to quote
[00:58:13.959 --> 00:58:16.160]  Prepare a film on democracy.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:27.525]  So he was already in there waiting for it to happen and then magically this video comes out with the aid of CFR member Larry Diamond with the State Department and the National Endowment on Democracy.
[00:58:27.525 --> 00:58:29.046]  So of course they don't even try to hide it.
[00:58:29.046 --> 00:58:30.086]  They don't even try to hide it, Paul.
[00:58:30.086 --> 00:58:30.806]  Stay there.
[00:58:30.806 --> 00:58:31.867]  Only five more minutes with you.
[00:58:31.867 --> 00:58:32.687]  I'm gonna come back, folks.
[00:58:32.687 --> 00:58:35.488]  Get the number out and get into all the other news we haven't covered.
[00:58:35.488 --> 00:58:36.409]  But this is a big deal.
[00:58:36.409 --> 00:58:39.750]  We're gonna talk about how this could lead to a larger regional war.
[00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.291]  Straight ahead.
[00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:42.872]  And Obama hinting at military action.
[00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:45.900]  By saying we don't want military action.
[00:59:06.815 --> 00:59:11.359]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:15.322]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:59:15.322 --> 00:59:21.266]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:24.449]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:59:24.449 --> 00:59:29.593]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:59:29.813 --> 00:59:40.680]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.522]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:59:53.748 --> 00:59:56.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.149 --> 00:59:58.911]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:10.457]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:12.038]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.038 --> 01:00:13.580]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.784]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.784 --> 01:00:23.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:26.612]  Well, the so-called ceasefire has broken down.
[01:00:27.927 --> 01:00:30.209]  Ukraine a month ago voted not to join the EU.
[01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.550]  I predicted they'd go down in flame.
[01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:36.873]  You will assimilate or you will be destroyed, according to the EU.
[01:00:36.873 --> 01:00:41.656]  And of course the EU is run by the same globals that run us, so it's all one big disgusting happy family.
[01:00:41.656 --> 01:00:48.220]  Paul Watson, who's in London covering this in detail, up on Infowars.com with videos and other reports.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.904]  Bottom line, Paul, how could this turn into a larger war, as many analysts are saying, and how do you think it's going to end?
[01:00:55.896 --> 01:01:11.545]  Well the fact is that the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin back in December said that if the US continued to encircle Russia with these missile bases, they've got one scheduled to be operational in Romania by 2015, another in Poland by 2018.
[01:01:11.545 --> 01:01:11.906]  He said that
[01:01:14.287 --> 01:01:20.852]  If the US attacked Russia with conventional weapons, Russia would respond with nuclear weapons.
[01:01:20.852 --> 01:01:25.175]  So again, it's about condemning Russia amongst the international community.
[01:01:25.175 --> 01:01:29.578]  It's the same thing with the Sochi gay controversy.
[01:01:29.578 --> 01:01:38.304]  That was completely staged from the beginning, a fake outrage to make it look as if Russia was intolerant of gays when in fact
[01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:44.110]  As I documented in my video, the US has harsher anti-gay laws than Russia.
[01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:54.060]  In fact, there's a gay club in Sochi itself, but they created this myth, they promulgated this myth that gays were being attacked and beaten up like Jews in Nazi Germany.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.621]  Complete baloney.
[01:01:55.621 --> 01:01:58.544]  That kind of faded off over the past week or two.
[01:01:58.544 --> 01:02:02.148]  Now they're back again with this Ukraine insurrection.
[01:02:02.668 --> 01:02:05.789]  And again, it's about isolating Russia geopolitically.
[01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:13.712]  It's about Russia, China and Iran being the last bulwarks against the final completion of the New World Order.
[01:02:13.712 --> 01:02:14.152]  That's right.
[01:02:14.152 --> 01:02:16.853]  People better understand, it's not about England, it's not about the U.S.
[01:02:16.853 --> 01:02:20.034]  just because the empire is based here.
[01:02:20.034 --> 01:02:26.356]  It is a global corporate system where they're above the law, crony monopoly men, the enemy of everyone.
[01:02:28.697 --> 01:02:31.758]  Yeah, I mean China and Russia are arming to the teeth.
[01:02:31.758 --> 01:02:35.179]  It's something that's very underplayed in the US media.
[01:02:35.179 --> 01:02:43.963]  But almost every day I see articles about China having war games where they're targeting, you know, mock US warships.
[01:02:44.483 --> 01:02:55.090]  You had a Russian expert recently come out and say that America's going to be broke by 2020 and China will be able to defeat it militarily within the next decade or so.
[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:59.793]  So China and Russia are arming like nothing you've ever seen since the Cold War.
[01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:03.215]  Obama seems to be scaling back with the US military.
[01:03:03.215 --> 01:03:13.321]  So they've chosen this faux revolution angle and they're trying to achieve their geopolitical objectives that way and it just remains to be seen how much Russia is going to put up with
[01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:18.662]  You know, before something dastardly happens, because that's where it's heading.
[01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:24.624]  Well, it's really getting insane, and the fires that are raging right now are just unbelievable.
[01:03:24.624 --> 01:03:29.265]  And now it looks like the Ukrainian police are starting to shoot people.
[01:03:29.265 --> 01:03:38.468]  They've been shooting at them, and so the EU is freaking out, the State Department is freaking out, and they're certainly getting the civil war going they wanted, Paul.
[01:03:38.468 --> 01:03:39.708]  How bad do you think it's going to get in Ukraine?
[01:03:41.921 --> 01:03:45.183]  Um, hopefully there's some kind of truce, but there was a truce last night.
[01:03:45.183 --> 01:03:49.206]  It lasted all of, what, two or three hours before the fighting began again.
[01:03:49.206 --> 01:03:56.610]  So that, again, it shows you a lot of these protesters, although many of them have genuine grievances, again, it's been hijacked.
[01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:59.792]  They're being bust in with backpacks and weapons.
[01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:06.476]  There are pictures of so-called protesters with sniper rifles with scopes on them, aiming them at police.
[01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:07.197]  And again, remember,
[01:04:07.637 --> 01:04:16.462]  McCain met with one of the opposition leaders from this fascist right party, Foboda party, back in December.
[01:04:16.462 --> 01:04:24.267]  Then Newland comes along and says we're going to invest five billion in the democratic institution of Ukraine to change the government.
[01:04:24.867 --> 01:04:35.733]  Now, that guy is going to be in power probably because in that leaked phone conversation with Newland and a top diplomat, he's one of the quote big three that they name who they're going to put into power.
[01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:40.415]  So it's all admitted that it's a staged revolt for regime change.
[01:04:40.415 --> 01:04:42.016]  Incredible, it's all admitted.
[01:04:42.016 --> 01:04:42.937]  As a conspiracy.
[01:04:42.937 --> 01:04:45.178]  So would you say Ukraine's staged by Obama?
[01:04:45.178 --> 01:04:46.179]  Staged by Soros?
[01:04:46.179 --> 01:04:49.060]  I mean, what's the headline on this video?
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.181]  Oh, it's definitely a similar situation to 2004.
[01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.823]  It's regime change via the back door.
[01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:56.311]  All right, Paul Watson.
[01:04:56.311 --> 01:04:57.072]  Thank you, folks.
[01:04:57.072 --> 01:04:58.293]  Big breaking news straight ahead.

[01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:06.683]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:06:06.683 --> 01:06:14.067]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:17.429]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:06:17.429 --> 01:06:19.470]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:24.013]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:27.016]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:32.982]  Nascent Iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:06:32.982 --> 01:06:36.646]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:06:36.646 --> 01:06:41.711]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of Nascent Iodine.

[01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:51.113]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:07:06.538 --> 01:07:11.060]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:17.182]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:51.974]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:08:10.539 --> 01:08:12.140]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:13.680]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.882]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.882 --> 01:08:21.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:31.893]  Well, if you just joined us, the FCC plans to police newsrooms.
[01:08:31.893 --> 01:08:33.675]  That's the Wall Street Journal reporting that.
[01:08:33.675 --> 01:08:38.202]  They're going to be coming into newsrooms making sure you are politically correct.
[01:08:38.202 --> 01:08:39.664]  No more free speech if they have their way.
[01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:43.573]  Obviously a truce crumbles in Ukraine and Russia.
[01:08:43.573 --> 01:08:45.754]  No early elections.
[01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.976]  East wing clashes.
[01:08:47.976 --> 01:08:54.220]  Don't worry though, Ben Affleck's going to help promote an invasion of Africa via the Kony 2012 fraud.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:09:00.625]  And the TSA's now confiscating aluminum foil of any type, saying that that might be a bomb or something.
[01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:05.928]  And it's being reported the Lego movie is liberal anti-corporate propaganda.
[01:09:05.928 --> 01:09:09.651]  You know, I don't agree with that statement out of the Weekly Standard.
[01:09:11.503 --> 01:09:19.909]  You've got kind of a Republican idea out there that any corporation is good.
[01:09:19.909 --> 01:09:26.975]  And anything a corporation does is good when they go in and basically act like a government and take over and consolidate power.
[01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:34.466]  I thought the movie was very libertarian about not having a surveillance state, not having everything be under agenda 21.
[01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.307]  But I guess it all depends on how you look at it.
[01:09:36.307 --> 01:09:38.449]  I can see kind of a leftist angle as well.
[01:09:38.449 --> 01:09:40.770]  Hey, I went and saw RoboCop last night.
[01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:44.432]  I need to do a review of the Lego movie.
[01:09:44.432 --> 01:09:55.098]  And I need to do a review of RoboCop because I saw RoboCop and I thought it was overall a pretty good action-adventure movie, sci-fi, compared to what's usually out there.
[01:09:55.098 --> 01:09:57.259]  And I thought it had a pretty good message overall as well.
[01:09:58.722 --> 01:10:00.444]  So there you go.
[01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:01.625]  I don't have time to break it all down.
[01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:02.846]  I want to do it properly.
[01:10:02.846 --> 01:10:04.748]  I actually have time, all the time in the world.
[01:10:04.748 --> 01:10:08.091]  I want to, but I want to kind of write some notes up and think about it.
[01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:15.697]  Maybe do it for the nightly news tonight or tomorrow for the new RoboCop, but I thought it was a pretty positive good message overall.
[01:10:16.738 --> 01:10:22.423]  And I'm seeing that out of so many Hollywood movies right now, and the word is, again, that's what's resonating with the public.
[01:10:22.423 --> 01:10:24.385]  You're voting with your dollars.
[01:10:24.385 --> 01:10:27.608]  So more and more positive, positive messages are coming out.
[01:10:27.608 --> 01:10:31.772]  Speaking of DrudgeReport.com, it's just always got all the most interesting news.
[01:10:31.772 --> 01:10:37.257]  Over on the left-hand side, we'll show folks that link on screen.
[01:10:37.257 --> 01:10:40.079]  Over on the left-hand side, the war on men.
[01:10:41.127 --> 01:10:47.771]  Ten ways masculinity is under attack, and this is an article I worked on with Paul just because I thought it was important.
[01:10:47.771 --> 01:10:52.254]  I'm glad it got some attention because it breaks down just ten of the ways.
[01:10:52.254 --> 01:10:59.379]  We probably have a hundred of the ways men are under attack, and men need to understand that, and so do women, to see that it's not a man against woman thing.
[01:10:59.379 --> 01:11:04.042]  It's the globalists wanting to break up families and bring in total control.
[01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:06.164]  Incredibly important.
[01:11:06.164 --> 01:11:10.667]  Men are facing a full frontal assault on their rights, health, and culture like never before.
[01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:16.421]  The war on masculinity has never been so brutal, but it's not a war being waged by women.
[01:11:16.421 --> 01:11:19.510]  The attack is coming directly from the top as the establishment desperately attempts...
[01:11:20.745 --> 01:11:30.692]  to emasculate and disempower men in order to force women to be more dependent on the state, thereby enabling more power to be centralized and aiding the growth of big government.
[01:11:30.692 --> 01:11:36.377]  Here are ten ways in which the states has declared war on men and masculinity.
[01:11:36.377 --> 01:11:47.185]  We ought to open the phones up one day and have your take on the war on men, the next day the war on women, then the war on children, the war on the... basically there's a war on everything by the predator class.
[01:11:47.185 --> 01:11:49.707]  But that does not mean the entire system is evil.
[01:11:50.498 --> 01:11:56.563]  It means there are evil people in the system that use it for their social engineering controls.
[01:11:56.563 --> 01:12:15.476]  Now, I've got a bunch of news I want to get into here dealing with Obamacare and dealing with some of the other situations that are unfolding with the surveillance grid and
[01:12:16.923 --> 01:12:21.387]  What's happening with the DHS Panopticon spy grid.
[01:12:21.387 --> 01:12:22.008]  There's a bunch of it.
[01:12:22.008 --> 01:12:26.992]  We're going to get to all of it here in just a moment.
[01:12:26.992 --> 01:12:30.415]  But first I wanted to get to this report.
[01:12:30.415 --> 01:12:34.759]  Mother opens fire on home invaders to protect her family.
[01:12:34.759 --> 01:12:41.626]  And we have this out of ABC News in Detroit, Michigan.
[01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:51.521]  And if you're a radio listener, and I'll describe the video before we play it, because we're also simulcasting video, obviously, at InfoWarsNews.com right now, or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:51.521 --> 01:12:54.482]  There's also the free feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:12:54.482 --> 01:13:09.865]  You won't actually see this, but three thugs in broad daylight, and they've been robbed before, come and start trying to kick the door down, and instead of just running or getting attacked like last time, they went and got a gun, so the woman fires it through the door at them.
[01:13:11.124 --> 01:13:19.646]  And one of them kind of acts like it grazes him, but one of the punk kids pulls the gun out, drops it, and wants to charge in and kill her because she dares fight back.
[01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:22.326]  I don't want to kill people, but I do want justice.
[01:13:22.326 --> 01:13:32.229]  Let me tell you, if you came to my house for kicking the door down, I would wait till you came in from a prone position, and I would shoot every one of you.
[01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:33.209]  And believe me, I would not miss.
[01:13:36.283 --> 01:13:41.024]  I'd load at least three rounds into each center of mass of each person.
[01:13:41.024 --> 01:13:44.405]  And if you're still, you know, acting like you're caught or a threat, well, get ready.
[01:13:44.405 --> 01:13:47.725]  I'm going to put another position and start aiming at your head.
[01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:55.587]  But, you see, I see these videos because I scan the news every day and don't even play them here.
[01:13:55.587 --> 01:13:59.968]  And I've told the crew, and they're doing a better job of it, you will make me play these.
[01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:02.028]  So they were reminding me, hey, you said make you play this today.
[01:14:02.762 --> 01:14:03.603]  You hear this?
[01:14:03.603 --> 01:14:10.508]  Every day or two we see these, where somebody in their business or their house runs people off or shoots them with a gun.
[01:14:10.508 --> 01:14:11.849]  And I don't ever play them.
[01:14:11.849 --> 01:14:13.450]  And it's the best propaganda we've got.
[01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.512]  The truth is the best propaganda for freedom.
[01:14:15.512 --> 01:14:16.132]  I admit it.
[01:14:16.132 --> 01:14:17.893]  I propagandize for truth.
[01:14:17.893 --> 01:14:18.914]  I propagandize for freedom.
[01:14:18.914 --> 01:14:21.656]  I'm an absolute sellout to freedom and truth.
[01:14:21.656 --> 01:14:23.057]  I'm absolutely into it.
[01:14:23.057 --> 01:14:23.758]  I'm a cult member.
[01:14:24.398 --> 01:14:27.400]  Okay, I'm real into it right now, I gotta be honest with you.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:33.183]  I just love justice, I just love being good, I love trying to be honest, and I love stomping bad people.
[01:14:33.183 --> 01:14:34.423]  Anyways, excuse me.
[01:14:34.423 --> 01:14:37.925]  And I see this footage, and I just think about this thug.
[01:14:37.925 --> 01:14:47.751]  She's shooting out the door, and this guy comes in wanting to kill her again, and I guess, might have even got shot, because he jumps back and runs off.
[01:14:47.751 --> 01:14:49.271]  I can't tell exactly what the gun is.
[01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:50.752]  It looks like it might be one of those cheap 9mm rifles.
[01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:56.016]  I can't really tell, but it looks like a Caltech.
[01:14:56.016 --> 01:14:57.217]  I mean, just look.
[01:14:57.217 --> 01:14:59.118]  They tell women you don't want high-caliber guns.
[01:14:59.118 --> 01:15:01.539]  I'm so tired of this, folks.
[01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:08.503]  That shows, like, Police Academy and stuff where the woman shoots the .357 or the .44 mag and it blows her to the wall.
[01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.584]  That isn't true.
[01:15:09.584 --> 01:15:12.525]  I can hand-shoot double .50s.
[01:15:12.525 --> 01:15:13.406]  Okay?
[01:15:13.406 --> 01:15:17.688]  I can hand-shoot double .50s, holding them in my hands, Barrett's.
[01:15:17.688 --> 01:15:19.029]  The only problem is picking them up.
[01:15:20.336 --> 01:15:23.539]  And then just go on, and then get my arms stiff, go on, boom!
[01:15:23.539 --> 01:15:24.259]  Boom!
[01:15:24.259 --> 01:15:27.222]  And folks have seen the footage of those type activities.
[01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:31.005]  And obviously, I'm somebody that's a little more into guns than most people.
[01:15:31.005 --> 01:15:31.145]  But...
[01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:38.493]  If a woman goes out with a 12-gauge and doesn't hold it up against her shoulder, it's going to kick her like you see in the YouTube videos.
[01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:42.197]  But if you simply learn how to fire a firearm, it doesn't even matter though.
[01:15:42.197 --> 01:15:50.864]  The gun for a woman who's scared of guns, women are just as good at shots as men are better statistically, is an M4 because there's no kick to speak of.
[01:15:50.864 --> 01:15:55.308]  We're talking about the kick of maybe a three-mile-an-hour wind on your hand outside.
[01:15:55.308 --> 01:15:58.551]  You barely just... I mean, it goes back like a millimeter.
[01:15:59.907 --> 01:16:07.393]  And the only problem with an M4 is that bullet's gonna go 3,000 feet a second, it could go through your neighbor's walls.
[01:16:07.393 --> 01:16:13.257]  The answer for women is a semi-automatic 410 shotgun with buckshot.
[01:16:13.257 --> 01:16:16.880]  I think that is the best gun out there.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.622]  And then all you gotta do, women, is just hold the gun firmly.
[01:16:19.622 --> 01:16:21.383]  You don't even need to put it to your shoulder.
[01:16:21.383 --> 01:16:22.844]  Just don't be afraid of it.
[01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:25.046]  Grab it and start pulling the trigger.
[01:16:25.046 --> 01:16:27.288]  If you just hold it with a little bit of force, it's not gonna do anything.
[01:16:28.346 --> 01:16:30.567]  And it's time to arm women!
[01:16:30.567 --> 01:16:34.269]  Arm our daughters, train them, get into guns so they're not just defenseless.
[01:16:34.269 --> 01:16:35.830]  Arm our sons.
[01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:39.572]  That's real humanity, not feminism.
[01:16:39.572 --> 01:16:45.495]  It's time to get back to being strong, and I see these videos constantly, and we need to make a bigger deal out of them.
[01:16:45.495 --> 01:16:50.217]  On the nightly news, you name it, I want to cover people defending themselves against criminals.
[01:16:50.217 --> 01:16:52.779]  I want to make a bigger deal out of the statistics and all of it.
[01:16:52.779 --> 01:16:53.859]  I'm in it to win it.
[01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.461]  We're at the tipping point to win the Second Amendment fight.
[01:16:56.461 --> 01:16:57.041]  Here's the video.
[01:16:57.861 --> 01:17:04.828]  This mom was prepared to do anything to defend her young, and remarkably, it was all caught on video.
[01:17:04.828 --> 01:17:08.752]  Take a good look at the three teenage punks caught here on surveillance video.
[01:17:08.752 --> 01:17:14.257]  They don't know it yet, but they've picked the wrong home to rob.
[01:17:14.257 --> 01:17:21.204]  They break down the door and race in, only to find the mom inside, locked, loaded, and about to pull the trigger of this rifle.
[01:17:24.318 --> 01:17:29.722]  One of these young thugs also has a handgun he drops right here as they make a run for it.
[01:17:29.722 --> 01:17:35.727]  Then he boldly picks it up and goes in one more time only to get another dose.
[01:17:35.727 --> 01:17:40.071]  The brave mother in the home was defending her two young children here on Woodrow Wilson.
[01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:45.815]  She and her husband recently had security cameras installed after a different break-in attempt just two weeks ago.
[01:17:45.815 --> 01:17:48.958]  This time she didn't have time to feel fear only to react.
[01:17:49.813 --> 01:17:56.357]  I let them know I had a gun once they was in the house, and they challenged me and said, I don't have a gun.
[01:17:56.357 --> 01:17:58.979]  So that's when I shot off the first round.
[01:17:58.979 --> 01:18:00.560]  I wasn't feeling anything at the moment.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.181]  I got scared afterwards.
[01:18:02.181 --> 01:18:07.424]  Once she called 911, Detroit police were quick to respond and go after these three thugs.
[01:18:07.424 --> 01:18:09.145]  It didn't take long for them to get locked up.
[01:18:09.565 --> 01:18:11.166]  The cops got all three of them.
[01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.487]  And the gun they had.
[01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.370]  I give them a lot of credit because they handled it the same night.
[01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:19.433]  As Chief Craig has said in the past, I mean, there's no more... Your time is up.
[01:18:19.433 --> 01:18:22.015]  We don't have any more patience for criminals in this city.
[01:18:22.015 --> 01:18:24.737]  We will get you, we will find you, and you will go to jail.
[01:18:26.437 --> 01:18:34.621]  We don't know exactly what these lowlifes came to steal, but one of the children inside knew mom would protect her and her valuables at all costs.
[01:18:34.621 --> 01:18:39.163]  She said, oh no mommy, I don't want them to take my piggy bank or my toys.
[01:18:39.163 --> 01:18:41.905]  Alright, that's ABC News 7 in Detroit.
[01:18:41.905 --> 01:18:45.327]  Good job on that report on being anti-gun to ABC there locally.
[01:18:45.327 --> 01:18:48.688]  By the way, they had the police chief a few months ago say, arm yourselves.
[01:18:48.688 --> 01:18:51.850]  That says exactly, you can't protect the people, the city's collapsing, arm yourselves.
[01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:55.828]  And I'm not knocking the woman for having a $150 Caltech 9mm.
[01:18:55.828 --> 01:18:58.149]  I mean, I've got a Caltech.
[01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.930]  I've bought a lot of guns.
[01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.171]  I mean, it's a fun little plinking gun.
[01:19:01.171 --> 01:19:07.195]  It's just, it just doesn't have the power that I think you need to really knock somebody down.
[01:19:07.195 --> 01:19:16.562]  And just in my experience, you know, a woman who's not really good with a firearm, and it doesn't like a big kick, 410 shotguns all the way.
[01:19:16.562 --> 01:19:20.504]  Semi-auto, load, you know, six rounds in the, you know, depending on the type.
[01:19:22.332 --> 01:19:27.773]  Get a circuit judge, you name it, whatever you need, and that's the way to take out these people.
[01:19:27.773 --> 01:19:33.335]  I just hope nobody ever comes to my house and thinks they're going to kick the door down and do that, because everybody's going to die that comes in my door.
[01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.675]  I mean, I'm not going to be missing.
[01:19:35.675 --> 01:19:37.736]  Because every time I watch these videos, I wish I was there.
[01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:40.136]  It's not that I want to kill somebody.
[01:19:40.136 --> 01:19:43.277]  It's just that I just want to see those guys, you know, learn.
[01:19:43.277 --> 01:19:45.838]  And I want to see the video in with them on the ground.
[01:19:48.311 --> 01:19:51.114]  And I'm sorry, you come to my house with a gun to attack me?
[01:19:51.114 --> 01:19:53.236]  I'm not gonna aim for your legs.
[01:19:53.236 --> 01:19:55.318]  I'm aiming for right dead center.
[01:19:55.318 --> 01:20:00.022]  We'll be right back with a bunch of key news on a host of issues straight ahead.

[01:22:59.915 --> 01:23:02.757]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:02.757 --> 01:23:07.901]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:16.008]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:16.008 --> 01:23:20.551]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:23:20.551 --> 01:23:24.354]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:24.494 --> 01:23:30.435]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:30.435 --> 01:23:33.616]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:33.616 --> 01:23:38.997]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:38.997 --> 01:23:47.159]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:23:47.159 --> 01:23:47.479]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:23:47.479 --> 01:23:47.959]  Do business
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.301]  Is it getting easier?
[01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:57.022]  Is it getting better?
[01:23:57.022 --> 01:23:58.223]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:22.734 --> 01:24:25.518]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:24:25.518 --> 01:24:26.939]  You've got someone to blame.
[01:24:26.939 --> 01:24:29.543]  You've got someone to blame.
[01:24:29.543 --> 01:24:31.365]  Monday through Friday, folks.
[01:24:31.365 --> 01:24:31.645]  11 a.m.
[01:24:31.645 --> 01:24:33.267]  to 2 p.m.
[01:24:33.267 --> 01:24:33.648]  Central.
[01:24:33.648 --> 01:24:34.950]  We're here.
[01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:40.056]  One life when it's one need in the night.
[01:24:40.056 --> 01:24:40.817]  In the night.
[01:24:41.738 --> 01:24:42.939]  Love Johnny Cash.
[01:24:42.939 --> 01:24:45.582]  His cover albums are just awesome.
[01:24:45.582 --> 01:24:47.063]  He was so prolific right before he died.
[01:24:47.063 --> 01:24:52.168]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:52.168 --> 01:24:57.513]  Here's the toll-free number in the next segment and the next after that to take your calls on anything you want.
[01:24:57.513 --> 01:25:01.136]  Old-time callers, long-time callers, first-time callers.
[01:25:01.136 --> 01:25:03.679]  Agree, disagree, just have your point and I'll try to go tell ya.
[01:25:04.219 --> 01:25:04.720]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.562]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:06.562 --> 01:25:11.347]  You disagree with me about Ukraine?
[01:25:11.347 --> 01:25:13.069]  This is your chance.
[01:25:13.069 --> 01:25:13.910]  About Obamacare?
[01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:15.792]  This is your chance.
[01:25:15.792 --> 01:25:17.654]  About the non-existent NSA spying?
[01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:18.936]  Oh, I was right about that.
[01:25:18.936 --> 01:25:20.498]  I mean, you disagree and think it's great.
[01:25:20.498 --> 01:25:20.538]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:27.380]  Let's run through a bunch of news here.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:33.726]  New highly radioactive leak at Japan's Fukushima plant, Reuters reports.
[01:25:33.726 --> 01:25:35.628]  It's just continuing on.
[01:25:35.628 --> 01:25:43.115]  The operator of Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant said today that 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water has leaked out of the tank.
[01:25:45.236 --> 01:25:52.060]  In any incident since last August, when a series of radioactive water leaks sparked international alarm, and it's still ongoing.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:56.623]  Uranium, plutonium, you name it, it is the gift that just keeps on giving.
[01:25:56.623 --> 01:26:05.488]  But they told the Navy sailors that were there helping with it when it happened, you don't need to take iodine or potassium iodate, even though the government people were taking it.
[01:26:05.488 --> 01:26:06.309]  Everything's fine.
[01:26:07.419 --> 01:26:15.481]  Continuing, and of course you can keep your doctor too, and Obama's not coming for your guns, and it's going to lower your premium, even though it increased it, because it's alright.
[01:26:15.481 --> 01:26:22.303]  CBS News, Biden acknowledges Obamacare enrollments might fall significantly short of target.
[01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:33.966]  Let me see, they wanted to get first 20 million, then 10 million, then 6 million, then 5 million, then 3 million, then a million, I mean it's not even a million people that have logged in and been able to get on this thing, folks.
[01:26:33.966 --> 01:26:35.306]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:42.171]  Continuing here, fourth Georgia hospital closes due to Obamacare payment cuts.
[01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:43.952]  They can't stay open.
[01:26:43.952 --> 01:26:46.233]  That's been reported on by the Daily Caller.
[01:26:46.233 --> 01:26:49.555]  Health law impact has only begun, reports the Wall Street Journal.
[01:26:49.555 --> 01:26:52.237]  Insurers seek healthy enrollees.
[01:26:52.237 --> 01:26:55.099]  They're increasing them on the young and people, kicking others off.
[01:26:55.099 --> 01:26:56.580]  Doctors educate new patients.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:01.303]  Employers wrestle with added costs by letting people go and cutting folks' time.
[01:27:01.303 --> 01:27:02.864]  Wasn't that just a nice, nice thing?
[01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:07.067]  A new Obama promise, if you like your life, you can keep it.
[01:27:07.067 --> 01:27:09.849]  I love this Ann Coulter article that just came out.
[01:27:09.849 --> 01:27:14.773]  Continuing, Senate Democrats, why didn't someone tell us Obamacare would cut Medicare?
[01:27:14.773 --> 01:27:26.183]  Yeah, the National Review has the Democrat from North Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan and others complaining that her constituents are going absolutely ape over massive Medicare cuts.
[01:27:26.183 --> 01:27:29.525]  Oh, you didn't know it was a Medicare cut?
[01:27:29.525 --> 01:27:30.026]  It was in the bill.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.902]  It was just too much fun, though.
[01:27:32.902 --> 01:27:39.712]  The bandwagon was going then, and you could laugh at everyone that talked about death panels and everything, and why don't you just laugh now?
[01:27:39.712 --> 01:27:42.616]  And tell your constituents, go die!
[01:27:42.616 --> 01:27:47.863]  I mean, you gotta make room for all the, you know, the Case for Killing Granny cover of Newsweek.
[01:27:50.259 --> 01:27:51.700]  And so it just continues on.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.961]  Let's get into some good news here.
[01:27:53.961 --> 01:27:55.562]  This is in the Washington Post today.
[01:27:55.562 --> 01:28:05.186]  Department of Homeland Security cancels National License Plate Tracking Program after attention was brought onto it.
[01:28:05.186 --> 01:28:06.567]  He ordered the cancellation of it.
[01:28:06.567 --> 01:28:14.171]  Isn't it funny he ordered the cancellation of it, ladies and gentlemen, just six days after this article
[01:28:17.643 --> 01:28:34.219]  Six days after this article was on DrudgeReport.com, it's from InfoWars.com from PJW, Paul Joseph Waddlewott, Homeland Security to activate National License Plate Recognition Database.
[01:28:35.287 --> 01:28:43.394]  And of course, it's totally illegal to be doing it, and to have private citizens and grips allowed to get into the database, and to take their own snapshots and feed it into the Tattletail database.
[01:28:43.394 --> 01:28:48.118]  The database is already there, they're just cancelling the initiative to let you into it for now.
[01:28:48.118 --> 01:28:56.466]  Kind of like when we exposed Oregon with Homeland Security's Snoop system, smart droids on top of power poles.
[01:28:58.494 --> 01:29:04.625]  tuning in and grabbing all of your cell phone and Wi-Fi data illegally and putting it through.
[01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:06.629]  We got the state reps involved, our listeners did.
[01:29:08.547 --> 01:29:13.751]  This is kind of a Perseveration Groundhog Day thing, after Drudge covered our article.
[01:29:13.751 --> 01:29:15.553]  Let's give credit where it's due.
[01:29:15.553 --> 01:29:17.455]  Then, they're having a state investigation.
[01:29:17.455 --> 01:29:22.579]  They've suspended the program in Washington State, and there's a huge pushback.
[01:29:22.579 --> 01:29:24.921]  All because people got concerned.
[01:29:24.921 --> 01:29:27.863]  And that's the same thing here right now.
[01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:35.330]  Homeland Security to activate national license plate recognition database.
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:36.230]  Well, a week later,
[01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:45.974]  The head of Homeland Security cancels the program because of public outcry and attention and the fact that it's obviously totally illegal and totally creepy.
[01:29:45.974 --> 01:29:50.296]  But in response to that, the NSA vows to spy even more on everyone.
[01:29:50.296 --> 01:29:51.657]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.657 --> 01:29:54.178]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.178 --> 01:29:56.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.973 --> 01:30:02.014]  The facts are in.
[01:30:02.014 --> 01:30:03.415]  The studies are legion.
[01:30:03.415 --> 01:30:10.941]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:30:10.941 --> 01:30:14.745]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:30:14.745 --> 01:30:15.325]  Simple.
[01:30:15.325 --> 01:30:19.709]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:30:20.029 --> 01:30:25.753]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:41.765]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:46.650]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:48.832]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:30:48.832 --> 01:30:54.377]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:30:54.377 --> 01:30:58.782]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:30:58.782 --> 01:31:00.063]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:01.144 --> 01:31:10.230]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:18.636]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:18.636 --> 01:31:23.520]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:29.664]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars Live!
[01:31:29.744 --> 01:31:30.645]  We're good to go.
[01:31:52.358 --> 01:31:58.659]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:58.659 --> 01:32:01.100]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:11.783]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:11.783 --> 01:32:13.623]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:13.843 --> 01:32:14.723]  Fluoride.
[01:32:14.723 --> 01:32:16.644]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:16.644 --> 01:32:23.206]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:23.206 --> 01:32:26.166]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:28.147]  And the results are on record.
[01:32:28.147 --> 01:32:34.449]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:34.449 --> 01:32:36.869]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:32:36.869 --> 01:32:39.810]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:43.191]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:32:43.311 --> 01:32:48.753]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:48.753 --> 01:32:53.834]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.034]  I take it every day.
[01:32:55.034 --> 01:32:57.895]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:16.889 --> 01:33:21.871]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:21.871 --> 01:33:29.515]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.515 --> 01:33:32.196]  Revolution in their mind!
[01:33:32.196 --> 01:33:34.077]  The children start to march.
[01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:58.457]  You have found at the tip of the spear of real independent media, openly biased towards freedom, openly biased towards the Second Amendment, to support the right to keep and bear arms, wearing our colors of red, white, and blue right on our sleeve, not backing down, not being assimilated into the new world order, aware of what's happening.
[01:33:58.457 --> 01:33:59.478]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:34:02.461 --> 01:34:09.609]  We've got Noah and Jason and Tommy and Dave and Ramon and many others that I'm going to go to here in just a moment.
[01:34:09.609 --> 01:34:11.732]  And then we have news like this.
[01:34:11.732 --> 01:34:18.079]  CBS Miami recording traffic stop lands Davie woman in jail.
[01:34:19.087 --> 01:34:21.168]  They're calling it wiretapping.
[01:34:21.168 --> 01:34:23.789]  Of course, even in that state, that's not illegal.
[01:34:23.789 --> 01:34:26.069]  So it just shows the total tyranny.
[01:34:26.069 --> 01:34:31.071]  We're going to be breaking some of that down coming up.
[01:34:31.071 --> 01:34:36.573]  Also continuing, Pandora knows how you'll vote and it's not keeping a secret.
[01:34:36.573 --> 01:34:39.434]  That's the problem with all this data mining, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:40.154 --> 01:34:46.259]  Is that it destroys your privacy, and I know that's a simple statement, and everybody's like, yeah, no kidding, Sherlock.
[01:34:46.259 --> 01:34:49.382]  I know, but I want to talk about some of the ramifications of what that can really do.
[01:34:49.382 --> 01:34:51.124]  Also, a report's out.
[01:34:51.124 --> 01:34:58.871]  The report from Farmers' Almanac, again, as it is almost every year, has been found more accurate than the government's climate scientist.
[01:35:00.015 --> 01:35:07.906]  And we've also got a congressperson pointing out that Obama is funding green firms that benefit offshore investors.
[01:35:07.906 --> 01:35:12.051]  Also, we're going to continue with the economy with 29% of all U.S.
[01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:15.315]  adults under the age of 35 are living with their parents.
[01:35:16.613 --> 01:35:20.698]  And of course, saying they're not going to have children because they're never going to have the money to do it.
[01:35:20.698 --> 01:35:26.905]  So that's how you see the death of the West, the death of that culture.
[01:35:26.905 --> 01:35:31.790]  Now, let's go up to InfoWars.com briefly, throw in a curveball at the boys.
[01:35:33.151 --> 01:35:33.611]  Out there.
[01:35:33.611 --> 01:35:40.835]  It's still on the main page, and if not, I'll have it moved back to the top of the page.
[01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:42.395]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:35:42.395 --> 01:35:57.682]  On InfoWars.com in the featured news area, InfoWars announces the finalists of We Will Resist the TSA and NSA Tyranny 10K film contest.
[01:35:58.562 --> 01:36:01.984]  And I will announce the winner tomorrow.
[01:36:01.984 --> 01:36:11.649]  I have the top three up there on the site, and I think I know who the winner is going to be, but I still can't completely decide.
[01:36:11.649 --> 01:36:14.971]  So please go up to Infowars.com in the comments.
[01:36:14.971 --> 01:36:15.792]  Give me your take.
[01:36:15.792 --> 01:36:18.973]  I'll be reading them this afternoon, tonight, and I'll decide in the morning.
[01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:23.436]  But Dick Johnson, TSA, Wonderkid,
[01:36:24.648 --> 01:36:25.149]  I think so.
[01:36:39.165 --> 01:36:43.271]  All of you, by entering, expose the TSA and NSA.
[01:36:43.271 --> 01:36:52.683]  Remember, we did this because the TSA and NSA keep calling and threatening and threatening to sue and sending letters to anyone that criticizes them on YouTube or selling t-shirts criticizing them.
[01:36:52.683 --> 01:36:53.905]  So I said, you know what?
[01:36:53.905 --> 01:36:55.087]  I'm just going to finance a $10,000 film contest.
[01:36:56.929 --> 01:36:57.430]  I don't think so.
[01:37:16.069 --> 01:37:22.112]  There's another headline, Minnesota Man Claims Victory Over NSA After Feds Drop Bid To Block Parody Merchandise.
[01:37:22.112 --> 01:37:24.633]  So he just had that victory, that just happened.
[01:37:24.633 --> 01:37:27.834]  And we've had him on the broadcast.
[01:37:27.834 --> 01:37:33.417]  In fact, he was one of the reasons that we did this, was they were actually suing him.
[01:37:33.417 --> 01:37:42.081]  Federal authorities, not public servants, have dropped an attempt to stop a Minnesota man from marketing merchandise, poking fun of the National Security Agency for its surveillance of citizens.
[01:37:42.081 --> 01:37:43.462]  Dan McCall of
[01:37:44.855 --> 01:37:58.204]  Sauk Rapids sued the NSA and Department of Homeland Security last fall when they issued cease and desist orders on merchandise, which includes t-shirts, bearing the NSA seal and slogan, the only part of government that actually listens.
[01:37:58.204 --> 01:38:03.647]  It's a victory for First Amendment rights, said Dan McCall of Liberty Maniacs.
[01:38:03.647 --> 01:38:04.808]  So, there you go.
[01:38:04.808 --> 01:38:05.749]  We should get him back on.
[01:38:05.749 --> 01:38:06.389]  I didn't even know that.
[01:38:06.389 --> 01:38:07.670]  It just happened.
[01:38:07.670 --> 01:38:13.474]  So, we stand up for the First Amendment because if we don't stand up, if one person can be brought down, we can all be brought down.
[01:38:14.827 --> 01:38:18.991]  That's classical liberalism, which they call extreme hardcore right-wingism today.
[01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:21.593]  It's just stand up for everybody's liberties.
[01:38:21.593 --> 01:38:24.917]  Doesn't mean you have to agree with what somebody's doing, but you stand up for their rights.
[01:38:24.917 --> 01:38:28.620]  When anybody tries to take it, then you have a free, prosperous society.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.602]  So there you go.
[01:38:30.602 --> 01:38:34.606]  And we're going to tweet out the top three folks.
[01:38:34.606 --> 01:38:36.227]  And I'm really still undecided.
[01:38:37.188 --> 01:38:39.288]  In fact, will you call Kit in here?
[01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:41.389]  There's one other video that I think should be in there.
[01:38:41.389 --> 01:38:48.630]  I know I said those three, but when I was looking at them just now and last night, there's one other one that I think should be in there.
[01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:50.090]  I just don't even know.
[01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:53.251]  See, this is why it takes so long.
[01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:54.391]  Do we have that one in there?
[01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:55.991]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:55.991 --> 01:38:56.731]  These are the top three.
[01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:57.472]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:38:57.472 --> 01:38:59.012]  These are the top three.
[01:38:59.012 --> 01:39:00.592]  I'm not wishy-washy here.
[01:39:00.592 --> 01:39:03.193]  I'm pretty decisive.
[01:39:03.193 --> 01:39:03.913]  Kit's right next door.
[01:39:03.913 --> 01:39:04.873]  That's how I can call him in here.
[01:39:04.873 --> 01:39:05.453]  Appreciate it, Kit.
[01:39:06.435 --> 01:39:11.039]  I just start getting confused sometimes when I'm picking a winner, and it just gets hard.
[01:39:11.039 --> 01:39:12.540]  That's why it takes me a long time sometimes.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:15.943]  All right, we are an hour and 39 minutes into worldwide transmission.
[01:39:15.943 --> 01:39:21.547]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment, but I have not plugged anything in an hour and 39 minutes on the show.
[01:39:21.547 --> 01:39:26.992]  And you notice most on radio, the shows stay afloat and operate with plugs during the live part of the transmission.
[01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:30.231]  That's when everybody's really listening.
[01:39:30.231 --> 01:39:33.532]  And I tend to not, most shows plug every segment.
[01:39:33.532 --> 01:39:34.832]  I plug maybe every hour.
[01:39:34.832 --> 01:39:40.734]  I need to plug every other segment really to be able to finance the news division that's about to go to the next level in the next two weeks.
[01:39:40.734 --> 01:39:43.355]  We've got a lot of other stuff going on on the side.
[01:39:43.355 --> 01:39:53.018]  The film division, the documentaries, the short clips, the radio show every day.
[01:39:53.018 --> 01:39:54.039]  Just everything we're doing.
[01:39:54.870 --> 01:40:10.522]  But when you purchase items at Infowarsstore.com, you are getting high-quality items, books, videos, apparel, survival implements, cook stoves, non-GMO seeds, high-quality supplements that are the very best.
[01:40:11.747 --> 01:40:25.632]  And just as important, you are financing the absolute tip of the spear against tyranny, and allowing us to have enough in our war chest to be strong, to survive attacks, to survive harassment, to survive the winds of tyranny.
[01:40:25.632 --> 01:40:36.555]  It's just really, by buying the Pro-1, high quality, stainless steel, gravity-fed, filters best out there, with 10% off promo code, you're financing the operation.
[01:40:36.555 --> 01:40:37.596]  When you buy a LifeStraw,
[01:40:38.476 --> 01:40:40.117]  You're financing the operation.
[01:40:40.117 --> 01:40:50.884]  When you buy the new Molon Labe Made in America Pro Second Amendment, best Molon Labe shirt out there, best-selling shirt we've ever put out, you're financing the operation.
[01:40:50.884 --> 01:40:56.188]  When you do these type of things, you make everything we do possible.
[01:40:56.188 --> 01:40:59.049]  So go to Madein1776.com.
[01:40:59.049 --> 01:41:02.452]  That'll just link you right through to the sub-area with the Made in America apparel, belt buckles.
[01:41:03.627 --> 01:41:20.517]  Navy SEAL manufactured 50 caliber bottle opening bottle breachers I mean 1776 ball caps 1776 worldwide ball caps it's all there at Infowarsstore.com and again if you go to places like Infowarslife.com
[01:41:21.897 --> 01:41:23.099]  I don't think so.
[01:41:37.199 --> 01:41:37.619]  Thank you.
[01:41:54.544 --> 01:41:59.408]  Uh, and, you know, selling it to you for 10 times what it's, 20 times, 50 times what it's worth.
[01:41:59.408 --> 01:42:05.433]  We sell you super high quality at very reasonable prices, and that's why you've heard about the dynamite results.
[01:42:05.433 --> 01:42:08.416]  So, please, try out the Super Metal Vitality.
[01:42:08.416 --> 01:42:10.097]  15% off, still running that special.
[01:42:10.097 --> 01:42:13.180]  And we did sell out of it, but more comes in next week, so it's not really backordered.
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:16.901]  Uh, technically it is, but you'll get shipped out next week if you order today.
[01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:19.602]  Uh, the fluoride shield, the nascent iodine.
[01:42:19.602 --> 01:42:24.544]  With all the radiation increasing in the background, people are insane to not take iodine every day.
[01:42:24.544 --> 01:42:27.605]  And a lot of it is rough and hard on the stomach, and I don't like it.
[01:42:27.605 --> 01:42:30.446]  Well, that's why I sought something my children could use.
[01:42:30.446 --> 01:42:31.647]  It's true nascent iodine.
[01:42:32.327 --> 01:42:33.848]  Non-GMO from Germany.
[01:42:33.848 --> 01:42:34.668]  Glycerin base.
[01:42:34.668 --> 01:42:37.509]  You can only get non-GMO corn from Germany, unfortunately.
[01:42:37.509 --> 01:42:39.390]  I credit everything made in America.
[01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:41.811]  But the point is, it's very expensive to put out.
[01:42:41.811 --> 01:42:45.632]  It's double the strength, half the cost of the leading competitor.
[01:42:45.632 --> 01:42:48.134]  It is survival shield nasonionine.
[01:42:48.134 --> 01:42:56.057]  The original progenitors of it, I have pretty much the exclusive to put it out, but they had a grandfather clause to put it out themselves, and it's half the size, double the price.
[01:42:56.057 --> 01:42:57.837]  I mean, seriously, that's what they sell it for.
[01:42:57.837 --> 01:42:58.778]  Half the size, double the cost.
[01:42:59.343 --> 01:43:00.984]  There's only one place to get the same thing.
[01:43:00.984 --> 01:43:02.345]  I'm not going to say the name of it.
[01:43:02.345 --> 01:43:04.145]  And it's double the cost, half the size.
[01:43:04.145 --> 01:43:06.126]  So ours is double the size, half the cost.
[01:43:06.126 --> 01:43:08.588]  It's just tele-operate.
[01:43:08.588 --> 01:43:10.309]  Double the size, half the cost.
[01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:13.390]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:14.651]  Done plugging.
[01:43:14.651 --> 01:43:15.811]  That's how we finance things.
[01:43:15.811 --> 01:43:17.932]  Your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:43:17.932 --> 01:43:19.513]  That's how we fund this.
[01:43:19.513 --> 01:43:20.614]  We don't put a gun to your head.
[01:43:21.553 --> 01:43:32.781]  Like the globalists do and say we're going to take all the 401ks in 2008 if you don't agree to total banker bailouts to give, you know, George Soros and Warren Buffett billions of your money, who they then give to media to promote tyranny.
[01:43:32.781 --> 01:43:44.269]  We just come to you and say we try to sell you high quality products, we will continue to operate and be able to fight the tyranny if you continue to put wind in our sails, and you've done it, so I salute all of you out there that have supported us.
[01:43:44.269 --> 01:43:44.710]  All of you!
[01:43:45.546 --> 01:43:54.550]  Whether it's spreading a word about the broadcast, whether it's putting up with me, the great obnoxious one, whatever it is, God bless you, thank you so much.
[01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:57.691]  Without further ado now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:43:57.691 --> 01:44:01.052]  And I'm going to try to give each caller a minute and move the next person.
[01:44:01.052 --> 01:44:04.274]  Noah, you are on the air.
[01:44:04.274 --> 01:44:04.614]  Go ahead.
[01:44:05.438 --> 01:44:05.858]  Thank you.
[01:44:05.858 --> 01:44:13.701]  I just was listening to Michael Savage the other day and he's got a new time slot now and he seems to be doing really well.
[01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:18.563]  It seems that people are craving this type of information.
[01:44:18.563 --> 01:44:22.325]  I didn't know if you were aware, he constantly references Prison Planet.
[01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:30.068]  And he also yesterday, even yesterday, I heard him say that the offshore bankers are who are really in control.
[01:44:30.068 --> 01:44:31.749]  So I think he's really woke up.
[01:44:31.749 --> 01:44:38.312]  I just wanted to know maybe if you would have him as a guest on your show, maybe, or maybe you could get reach out to him or something.
[01:44:38.312 --> 01:44:42.194]  Sir, I had Michael Savage on and the one day I had him on, we had technical difficulties.
[01:44:42.194 --> 01:44:43.715]  We had technical difficulties maybe twice a year.
[01:44:44.744 --> 01:44:47.125]  And then the one day he was on, the board screwed up twice.
[01:44:47.125 --> 01:44:47.745]  He was laughing.
[01:44:47.745 --> 01:44:56.810]  He said it was like growing up in New York City and watching Mexican TV on, you know, broadcast there with the puppets beating each other up and, you know, a light would fall over and it was better than regular stuff.
[01:44:56.810 --> 01:45:02.712]  But Michael Savage is probably the smartest person on talk radio out there.
[01:45:02.712 --> 01:45:06.754]  And he also wants to have a future and live in a free country.
[01:45:06.754 --> 01:45:08.135]  And so he does tell it like it is.
[01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.576]  And I think outside of my show,
[01:45:10.456 --> 01:45:14.878]  It is the most hardcore, accurate broadcast out there, and we'll put it up on site.
[01:45:14.878 --> 01:45:17.018]  It's michelsavage.com.
[01:45:17.018 --> 01:45:18.699]  What a good-looking website.
[01:45:18.699 --> 01:45:22.100]  By the way, the new InfoWars is launching, and it pretty much looks like the Savage Nation.
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.301]  We're not copying the Savage Nation.
[01:45:24.301 --> 01:45:27.102]  When you go to the top website developers, that's what they look like.
[01:45:27.102 --> 01:45:28.922]  Kind of something like that.
[01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:34.584]  But michelsavage.com, and yeah, no, I listen when I can.
[01:45:34.584 --> 01:45:36.565]  I have asked Michael to come on.
[01:45:36.565 --> 01:45:38.886]  I've got his personal cell phone and number.
[01:45:38.886 --> 01:45:39.766]  I've never called it.
[01:45:41.867 --> 01:45:45.968]  I've talked to him a few times privately before he came on, and then he's just so busy.
[01:45:45.968 --> 01:45:49.849]  He writes books, he's got a family, he's got successful supplement companies.
[01:45:49.849 --> 01:45:51.610]  He wrote like 20 best-selling books.
[01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:54.691]  He is a doctor.
[01:45:54.691 --> 01:45:55.731]  He's a botanist.
[01:45:55.731 --> 01:45:57.271]  He doesn't just have one of those health degrees.
[01:45:57.271 --> 01:46:00.352]  I mean, he has like the real mainline university health degrees.
[01:46:00.352 --> 01:46:01.893]  I'm not kissing his butt.
[01:46:01.893 --> 01:46:10.415]  I just love people that actually want to live in a free country and who aren't egomaniacs to the point of, if they hear another talk show host,
[01:46:11.204 --> 01:46:15.367]  That is telling the truth that he won't attack them.
[01:46:15.367 --> 01:46:17.929]  Because other talk show hosts will attack you, period.
[01:46:17.929 --> 01:46:19.030]  They don't care.
[01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:20.631]  Even if you're doing a good job.
[01:46:20.631 --> 01:46:22.652]  Because they're egomaniacs.
[01:46:22.652 --> 01:46:28.796]  And listen, I'm not going to attack anybody who is not a tyrant.
[01:46:28.796 --> 01:46:30.177]  Because I want to have a future.
[01:46:30.177 --> 01:46:30.558]  Anything else?
[01:46:31.756 --> 01:46:38.678]  Well, I'm just going to say it's just good to hear that he's actually beating Sean Hannity, which I, you know, that guy is such a sellout.
[01:46:38.678 --> 01:46:46.100]  I mean, he's having dinner with Newt Gingrich and, you know, I just, I mean, it's just nice to see Michael Savage beating him out in the time slot that he's in.
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:48.480]  But I appreciate your show, Alex.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.420]  No, I appreciate you.
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:54.342]  Yeah, I find Sean Hannity to be unlistenable.
[01:46:54.342 --> 01:46:55.202]  So there you go.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.122]  I mean, I can listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:46:58.122 --> 01:46:59.523]  He says a lot of good stuff.
[01:46:59.523 --> 01:47:00.984]  He used to be really good like 20 years ago.
[01:47:00.984 --> 01:47:03.946]  Man, he just kind of, you know, just I don't know.
[01:47:03.946 --> 01:47:05.507]  I don't like to talk bad about people.
[01:47:05.507 --> 01:47:07.749]  Beck's good sometimes, but he's not joking constantly.
[01:47:07.749 --> 01:47:13.454]  I mean, sometimes I tune into his show and it's just they're giggling and laughing for like five minutes and I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:47:13.454 --> 01:47:20.740]  And then when he's serious, you know, it sounds more informed than I am, but it's just, I just, I screw around some too, because you can't be serious all the time.
[01:47:22.779 --> 01:47:31.786]  I like somebody like Michael Savage because I've done a lot of history research, a lot of work, and I can actually learn something on his show, but most of what I hear him say I already know to be true.
[01:47:31.786 --> 01:47:35.869]  And it's just intellectually, it's like five levels above the average talk show host.
[01:47:35.869 --> 01:47:38.031]  It doesn't mean I'm on some high horse either.
[01:47:38.031 --> 01:47:41.033]  It's just that means how low the other shows are.
[01:47:41.033 --> 01:47:49.660]  And then you compare those broadcast, any talk radio by any type of conservative is light years better than a Democratic show.
[01:47:50.484 --> 01:48:04.517]  You tune into a Democratic radio show, and all they talk about is how racist everyone is, and basically how they're going to take the country over.
[01:48:04.517 --> 01:48:07.220]  I mean, it's just unlistenable.
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.781]  But I don't want to get into a talk radio discussion.
[01:48:08.781 --> 01:48:09.902]  Yes, I know Michael Savage
[01:48:10.899 --> 01:48:12.740]  Peter, Alex, how are you doing?
[01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:34.774]  Hey man, I just wanted to make a quick comment about the geoengineering that's going on out here in California.
[01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:46.586]  I was studying about how they can make the moisture, like all those aluminum chemicals that they're spraying up in there, they can actually absorb all the moisture out of a cloud.
[01:48:47.532 --> 01:48:51.976]  What it does is it stops them from forming larger nuclei and then causing condensation.
[01:48:51.976 --> 01:49:01.563]  No, I know, it's declassified, a global geoengineering program, they're manipulating our weather, and then they go, oh, the weather's bad, pay us more taxes, and the government's up there spraying, and it's bizarre.
[01:49:02.762 --> 01:49:24.537]  Yeah, I know, and then also I stumbled upon a secret project that would be classified, and it's called Project Paperclip, where they would cloud feed in Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh Trail to make it rain non-stop, so they could... You know, I actually had Ben Livingston, Dr. Ben Livingston, meteorologist, the father of weather weapons, who did weather weapons stuff in World War II.
[01:49:24.537 --> 01:49:25.918]  I think he's still alive.
[01:49:25.918 --> 01:49:27.980]  I had him on when he was like 90 years old.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:31.883]  Then he got a national security phone call and was told not to come on the show, that he'd violated national security.
[01:49:32.664 --> 01:49:35.033]  I ended up being in Fox News after he was on my show.
[01:49:35.033 --> 01:49:36.780]  That interview, he came to Austin.
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:37.845]  He was from Midland.
[01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:44.137]  And he was advising weather mod companies all over the country that were doing legal stuff with medium planes.
[01:49:44.137 --> 01:49:48.241]  You know, like, make it snow for a snow resort or whatever.
[01:49:48.241 --> 01:49:51.984]  Working for insurance companies that would have to pay out if it didn't snow at a snow resort.
[01:49:51.984 --> 01:49:52.825]  They'd call him in.
[01:49:52.825 --> 01:49:54.747]  Usually it was for insurance companies.
[01:49:54.747 --> 01:50:01.133]  And he was the guy that could make it in the middle of, you know, the dry season, flood the Ho Chi Minh Trail with ten feet of water.
[01:50:01.133 --> 01:50:04.015]  He would lead the squadrons in Vietnam under attack.
[01:50:05.676 --> 01:50:08.918]  of Sam Missiles with the aircraft.
[01:50:08.918 --> 01:50:09.798]  Think about that.
[01:50:09.798 --> 01:50:14.621]  He was in World War II as a fighter pilot and flew into typhoons at the end of World War II.
[01:50:14.621 --> 01:50:18.362]  The first guy to ever fly into a typhoon is a hurricane flyer.
[01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:21.023]  That's eastern, you know, is a typhoon.
[01:50:21.023 --> 01:50:21.684]  Western is a...
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.381]  It was a hurricane.
[01:50:25.381 --> 01:50:27.202]  One circles one way, the other circles the other.
[01:50:27.202 --> 01:50:29.903]  And then he was a fighter pilot in Vietnam.
[01:50:29.903 --> 01:50:32.024]  Those old-timers were really incredible.
[01:50:32.024 --> 01:50:36.347]  I mean, it's like... I mean, think of all the stuff they did.
[01:50:36.347 --> 01:50:41.549]  He flew, I want to say it was like 500 missions in Vietnam under SAM attack.
[01:50:41.549 --> 01:50:44.050]  Leading squadrons of planes flooding them.
[01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:46.372]  I mean, that is just Ben Livingston.
[01:50:46.372 --> 01:50:47.552]  We ought to find that interview.
[01:50:47.552 --> 01:50:50.053]  I interviewed him in the Radisson Hotel over here.
[01:50:50.053 --> 01:50:50.914]  And we ought to air that.
[01:50:52.106 --> 01:50:55.990]  And being around those old Texans, it's just like being around my grandpas.
[01:50:55.990 --> 01:51:00.154]  They just... I'm telling you, John Wayne acts like those guys really were.
[01:51:01.334 --> 01:51:02.695]  Attention gun owners.
[01:51:02.695 --> 01:51:07.498]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[01:51:07.498 --> 01:51:11.220]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:13.582]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.
[01:51:13.582 --> 01:51:16.003]  Is civilian legal in all 50 states?
[01:51:16.003 --> 01:51:18.425]  Is 100% made in the USA?
[01:51:18.425 --> 01:51:22.187]  Is veteran owned and ships next business day for free?
[01:51:22.187 --> 01:51:24.549]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:51:29.492 --> 01:51:30.713]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:30.973 --> 01:51:35.216]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[01:51:35.216 --> 01:51:37.778]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[01:51:37.778 --> 01:51:42.621]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:51:42.621 --> 01:51:46.724]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:51:46.724 --> 01:51:52.628]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.

[01:52:01.076 --> 01:52:02.097]  The facts are in.
[01:52:02.097 --> 01:52:03.499]  The studies are legion.
[01:52:03.499 --> 01:52:11.026]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:52:11.026 --> 01:52:14.450]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:15.390]  Simple.
[01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:20.113]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:52:20.113 --> 01:52:25.835]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:52:25.835 --> 01:52:42.163]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:52:42.163 --> 01:52:44.004]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:52:44.144 --> 01:52:46.725]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:52:46.725 --> 01:52:48.885]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[01:53:01.329 --> 01:53:08.035]  By now you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[01:53:08.035 --> 01:53:09.177]  No bank needed.
[01:53:09.177 --> 01:53:13.060]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited, or closed.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:16.924]  Plus, a large number of businesses and merchants already accept Bitcoins.
[01:53:16.924 --> 01:53:20.067]  And Bitcoins are easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[01:54:03.683 --> 01:54:06.784]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:54:06.784 --> 01:54:09.126]  In the Mississippi River, she's a gold driver.
[01:54:09.878 --> 01:54:10.939]  You hear him Pentagon?
[01:54:10.939 --> 01:54:12.140]  That's who you train to fight.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:14.962]  Your number one enemy, Hank Williams Jr.
[01:54:14.962 --> 01:54:17.984]  The interest is up and the stock market's down.
[01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:21.407]  Why do I play such good bumper music?
[01:54:21.407 --> 01:54:25.150]  Because I just want to sit here and listen to it.
[01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:27.892]  Instead of talking.
[01:54:27.892 --> 01:54:29.854]  Which is actually a blessing for the listeners.
[01:54:34.275 --> 01:54:37.076]  Shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive.
[01:54:37.076 --> 01:54:42.718]  I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive, and a country boy can survive.
[01:54:42.718 --> 01:54:45.359]  You know, it's funny.
[01:54:45.359 --> 01:54:48.921]  I was talking to Chris Jordan about him doing a news report, because he's an eloquent, smart guy.
[01:54:48.921 --> 01:54:52.142]  Instead of just running the board in there, which is an important job as well.
[01:54:52.142 --> 01:54:56.503]  I say just running the board, and finding all the news, and pulling up whatever I talk about.
[01:54:56.503 --> 01:55:00.325]  But he was pointing out that, used to, Congress was barely paid enough to even buy their lunch.
[01:55:01.411 --> 01:55:03.792]  And then you want to go back to your farm or back to your business.
[01:55:03.792 --> 01:55:07.034]  It was an honor to help the country to go serve and then go back.
[01:55:07.034 --> 01:55:14.158]  Not to be red carpeted and private jetted and be exempt from all the laws you push on the public like Obamacare.
[01:55:14.158 --> 01:55:20.882]  Well, CNN is now reporting petition calls on Congress to give up their paychecks.
[01:55:20.882 --> 01:55:21.863]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:55:21.863 --> 01:55:27.126]  You know, I love how Dianne Feinstein went to Congress with less than a million dollars and she's worth over a hundred million now.
[01:55:28.345 --> 01:55:33.509]  Her husband got billions from contracts government gave her that she even voted on.
[01:55:33.509 --> 01:55:35.130]  It's time to call these people out.
[01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:42.535]  I mean, this is a ruling establishment totally disconnected from reality.
[01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:49.300]  And I was saying you should do a report on that, dovetailing the statistics and historical facts of what they used to get paid.
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:51.782]  So maybe we'll have that sometime next week.
[01:55:51.782 --> 01:55:53.823]  Let's go ahead and go to Ramon in Florida.
[01:55:53.823 --> 01:55:54.784]  Thanks for calling.
[01:55:54.784 --> 01:55:55.424]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:55.424 --> 01:55:55.925]  You're on the air.
[01:55:57.415 --> 01:55:58.615]  What's going on, Alyssa?
[01:55:58.615 --> 01:56:19.884]  The reason why I'm calling it a day is because, you know, like a lot of things in our world, people seem to nitpick about every little thing about a person, especially in our movement, because everybody tries to find any little one thing about you that's wrong or me that's wrong or, you know, David Icke or whoever, and then say, see, see, that's the reason why we can't trust this person.
[01:56:19.884 --> 01:56:20.404]  He sells
[01:56:21.568 --> 01:56:24.770]  Whatever you sell on your website, DVDs, medicine, whatever.
[01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:27.511]  Well, obviously I gotta sell stuff to fund my operation.
[01:56:27.511 --> 01:56:28.871]  Again, that's another cop-out.
[01:56:28.871 --> 01:56:35.354]  The media, most of them get government funds and government and corporate contracts that were gotten from government funds from taxpayers.
[01:56:35.354 --> 01:56:40.037]  We're free and independent, openly financed, openly where we get our money.
[01:56:40.037 --> 01:56:41.837]  And it's like, ooh, he sells stuff.
[01:56:41.837 --> 01:56:43.398]  Of course I'm not a communist.
[01:56:43.398 --> 01:56:46.920]  But listen, the average weak-minded person always complains.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.480]  How about anybody trying to fix things?
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:53.741]  Because it's easy to complain instead of actually trying to fix things.
[01:56:53.741 --> 01:56:55.882]  See, but I notice it's a lot bigger than that.
[01:56:55.882 --> 01:57:02.964]  Yeah, we could say every few people is an average, you know, not informed person who's just not sure about the things we're saying.
[01:57:02.964 --> 01:57:07.124]  And they don't just want to be listening to anything everybody says and just go along with it.
[01:57:07.124 --> 01:57:08.125]  And that's cool.
[01:57:08.125 --> 01:57:09.305]  But I've noticed it's like...
[01:57:09.965 --> 01:57:17.828]  What you taught me about a few years ago, listening to your show COINTELPRO, I had never heard about the counterintelligence program until I ran it to yourself.
[01:57:17.828 --> 01:57:27.331]  And then I started to research it and realized like, hey, these tactics are being used today to divide our movement and even our own communities and our homes because
[01:57:28.012 --> 01:57:33.079]  These tactics are used to divide people amongst things that really shouldn't matter.
[01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:43.873]  The things that do matter, they push them to the side, they try to get you to not focus on that, and try to worry about things like sexuality, or religion, or you know, if everything I say is true and
[01:57:44.253 --> 01:57:45.854]  You know, you can verify it.
[01:57:45.854 --> 01:57:46.695]  That's not the point.
[01:57:46.695 --> 01:57:51.418]  What this whole movement is about, people, is about enlightening people, opening their eyes to empowerment.
[01:57:51.418 --> 01:57:52.879]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:57:52.879 --> 01:57:55.241]  It's not about believing what Alex Jones says.
[01:57:55.241 --> 01:58:01.526]  It's about realizing there's a bigger world going on, there is manipulation, and become aware of it.
[01:58:02.126 --> 01:58:07.769]  And then discover what's worked historically versus the tyranny that we're going under.
[01:58:07.769 --> 01:58:15.293]  And look, exactly, it's classic government divide and conquer to always attack those that are trying to promote liberty.
[01:58:15.293 --> 01:58:16.173]  And that's what they do.
[01:58:16.173 --> 01:58:18.835]  That's what Cass Sunstein at the White House said.
[01:58:18.835 --> 01:58:23.617]  They would pose as, quote, conspiracy theorists, people that question, and then cause infighting.
[01:58:23.617 --> 01:58:28.680]  Any media person online that spends more than 2% of their time infighting
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.544]  Or talking about anybody else bad is an operative.
[01:58:32.544 --> 01:58:34.926]  And most operatives spend most of their time doing it.
[01:58:34.926 --> 01:58:37.669]  And it comes out later that they are operatives.
[01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:38.811]  That's what they're there to do.
[01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:47.741]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.098 --> 01:58:54.121]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:54.121 --> 01:58:59.145]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:59.145 --> 01:59:06.311]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:06.451 --> 01:59:12.073]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:12.073 --> 01:59:16.114]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:59:20.836 --> 01:59:26.038]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:26.298 --> 01:59:29.540]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:32.041]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:32.041 --> 01:59:36.804]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:36.804 --> 01:59:39.685]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[01:59:56.466 --> 02:00:06.008]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.008 --> 02:00:07.328]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.328 --> 02:00:09.088]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.088 --> 02:00:10.849]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.849 --> 02:00:12.429]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.429 --> 02:00:13.969]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.969 --> 02:00:18.170]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:22.251]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.424 --> 02:00:24.724]  Let's move fast through calls.
[02:00:24.724 --> 02:00:27.785]  We have Dr. Doug Rocky joining us.
[02:00:27.785 --> 02:00:28.926]  Bruce, in Canada.
[02:00:28.926 --> 02:00:29.566]  You're on the air.
[02:00:29.566 --> 02:00:30.526]  Thanks for holding, my friend.
[02:00:30.526 --> 02:00:32.047]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:32.047 --> 02:00:32.607]  How are you?
[02:00:32.607 --> 02:00:33.987]  Good, sir.
[02:00:33.987 --> 02:00:34.527]  Good.
[02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:39.449]  I have some almost live intel for you from Ukraine.
[02:00:39.449 --> 02:00:45.390]  In Lviv, in the West, my foreman here at work, his sister is there.
[02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:50.592]  The police there have sided with the people
[02:00:51.497 --> 02:00:57.382]  The military that's present in the city have sided with the people.
[02:00:57.382 --> 02:01:02.387]  The government officials in the region have all actually resigned.
[02:01:02.387 --> 02:01:06.190]  And things are pretty, well, as normal as they can be.
[02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:08.873]  Exactly, because the West is more with Europe.
[02:01:08.873 --> 02:01:11.655]  That's the slogan of the group, is we are with the West.
[02:01:11.655 --> 02:01:14.458]  And then the East is more with Russia, so the country might split in two.
[02:01:16.574 --> 02:01:23.116]  Over to Kharkov in the east and unfortunately there the police have now sided with the military.
[02:01:23.116 --> 02:01:25.697]  They are present on the streets.
[02:01:25.697 --> 02:01:35.480]  The phones aren't working and the internet is very dicey and then we move down to the center in Kirovograd.
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.981]  The police there have sided with the people apparently.
[02:01:37.981 --> 02:01:41.743]  The military are in the streets and it's like a ghost town.
[02:01:41.743 --> 02:01:42.503]  No one is moving.
[02:01:42.503 --> 02:01:43.183]  None of the shops are
[02:01:43.823 --> 02:01:45.364]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:48.286]  So you're saying, do you believe this is a legitimate movement?
[02:01:48.286 --> 02:01:53.269]  And from what you're saying, you believe the majority of people in Ukraine are for this?
[02:01:53.269 --> 02:02:07.457]  Well, I think that the key to the whole thing, you know, I mean, I understand the whole Soros thing and all of that stuff, but I think that the people in general are really... No, I get it, but then they hijack it and then put their people in.
[02:02:07.457 --> 02:02:09.438]  No, I hear you.
[02:02:09.438 --> 02:02:10.279]  I hear you.
[02:02:10.279 --> 02:02:10.579]  I agree.
[02:02:11.855 --> 02:02:13.599]  And it's really sad.
[02:02:13.599 --> 02:02:21.075]  Then if you move to Keeve, I just finished talking to someone in Keeve a few moments ago, fortunate, because the phone actually worked.
[02:02:21.887 --> 02:02:25.308]  And, you know, all hell is breaking loose there.
[02:02:25.308 --> 02:02:27.288]  The banks are shut down.
[02:02:27.288 --> 02:02:29.769]  The shops are all closed.
[02:02:29.769 --> 02:02:33.930]  People there are just terrified, you know, of what's going on.
[02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:38.891]  And it's a war zone far beyond what you actually see, you know.
[02:02:38.891 --> 02:02:42.752]  I don't see a lot of good things happening here, you know.
[02:02:44.505 --> 02:02:45.986]  Well, it is a real shame.
[02:02:45.986 --> 02:02:58.855]  They're great people, a lot of great art, a lot of interesting literature, a lot of good things come out of the Ukraine, a lot of wheat comes out of the Ukraine, and it's just sad to see ancient Balkanization continuing on.
[02:02:58.855 --> 02:03:03.158]  I'm just here to tell you, there's a lot of beefs on both sides, and I know that.
[02:03:03.158 --> 02:03:04.820]  The West is in there fomenting this.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.624]  And that is a crime to foment inside other people's countries.
[02:03:09.624 --> 02:03:12.627]  If somebody was doing that here in the U.S., I'd be upset about it.
[02:03:12.627 --> 02:03:17.893]  And I just hope that it all ends up coming to a head and blowing over quickly.
[02:03:17.893 --> 02:03:25.861]  But you're saying from the people you're talking to, you think the West is definitely already in the hands of the opposition?
[02:03:27.142 --> 02:03:30.645]  Well, it's pretty open.
[02:03:30.645 --> 02:03:39.291]  The people that I've talked to are very aware that the Americans are definitely interfering, and they're not real happy about it.
[02:03:39.291 --> 02:03:42.494]  So, that I find really encouraging.
[02:03:42.494 --> 02:03:49.359]  You know, everyone that I do talk to, and believe me, I know hundreds of people in Ukraine, and I mean all over Ukraine,
[02:03:49.879 --> 02:04:02.462]  And every one of them that I get an opportunity to have a few minutes with, I encourage them, you know, listen, pay attention to what's going on and, you know, watch out for the Americans in the EU because you don't want to be a part of the EU.
[02:04:02.462 --> 02:04:04.343]  You know, they'll bankrupt you.
[02:04:04.343 --> 02:04:06.544]  And, you know, you'd be surprised, Alex.
[02:04:06.544 --> 02:04:08.104]  Most of them are very aware.
[02:04:08.663 --> 02:04:10.704]  No, I know Ukrainians.
[02:04:10.704 --> 02:04:16.967]  Ukrainians, I've run into them on the street and I've got a few friends that are Ukrainian, only been here one generation and they're really cool people.
[02:04:16.967 --> 02:04:17.947]  I like them.
[02:04:17.947 --> 02:04:20.429]  So, I know we have listeners in Ukraine.
[02:04:20.429 --> 02:04:22.590]  I don't like having to wade in on one side or the other.
[02:04:22.590 --> 02:04:24.450]  I just think it's wrong that the globalists and the EU
[02:04:25.831 --> 02:04:29.815]  The Ukraine didn't vote to go with them, so now they're pulling this.
[02:04:29.815 --> 02:04:37.282]  And I'm not saying some of the people don't have real issues, I just, you know, the Ukrainians want to burn down the Capitol and shoot all the police and set a new government up.
[02:04:37.282 --> 02:04:39.544]  That's a declaration of independence.
[02:04:39.544 --> 02:04:42.146]  But if the West is doing it from outside, it's not.
[02:04:42.146 --> 02:04:43.768]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:04:43.768 --> 02:04:44.708]  Great points.
[02:04:44.708 --> 02:04:48.492]  Mark, Tom, Zach, Jill, and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:04:48.492 --> 02:04:49.353]  Dr. Doug Rocky.
[02:04:49.913 --> 02:04:53.036]  On some of the most important issues we could possibly talk about.
[02:04:53.036 --> 02:04:56.019]  Straight ahead, please tell your friends and family to tune in.
[02:04:56.019 --> 02:04:58.421]  And follow us on Twitter at Real Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.112 --> 02:05:03.013]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:03.013 --> 02:05:06.655]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:05:06.655 --> 02:05:11.197]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:11.197 --> 02:05:17.300]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:28.086]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:05:28.306 --> 02:05:31.167]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[02:05:31.167 --> 02:05:34.788]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:05:34.788 --> 02:05:49.513]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:05.763]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[02:06:05.763 --> 02:06:08.885]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:06:08.885 --> 02:06:14.448]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:14.448 --> 02:06:16.029]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:16.349 --> 02:06:18.010]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:18.010 --> 02:06:22.673]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:22.673 --> 02:06:26.876]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:06:26.876 --> 02:06:29.458]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:29.458 --> 02:06:35.682]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:00.905 --> 02:07:03.726]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:07:03.726 --> 02:07:08.869]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:07:08.869 --> 02:07:16.672]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:07:16.972 --> 02:07:21.494]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:07:21.494 --> 02:07:25.475]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:07:25.475 --> 02:07:31.418]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:07:31.418 --> 02:07:34.599]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:07:34.599 --> 02:07:39.741]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:07:39.961 --> 02:07:48.145]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:07:48.145 --> 02:07:48.465]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:07:48.465 --> 02:07:50.566]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[02:07:50.566 --> 02:07:51.786]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[02:08:12.637 --> 02:08:16.740]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:19.122]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.122 --> 02:08:23.125]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:23.125 --> 02:08:27.148]  Now into the third and final hour, your calls are coming up on a host of issues.
[02:08:27.148 --> 02:08:30.610]  At about 35-40 after, we're going to have Dr. Doug Rocky go then.
[02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:32.832]  We appreciate him spending time with us today.
[02:08:32.832 --> 02:08:35.194]  He's had more than 40 surgeries to stay alive.
[02:08:36.174 --> 02:08:42.741]  Uh, and much of his team has died from cleaning up depleted uranium on the highway of death, uh, in Iraq.
[02:08:42.741 --> 02:08:50.949]  He wrote the Army's DU, uh, handbook, and I don't have time to go over his five-page bio, but Dr. Doug Rocky is a depleted uranium expert.
[02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:52.911]  He earned his B.S.
[02:08:52.911 --> 02:08:54.412]  in Physics following his M.S.
[02:08:54.412 --> 02:08:55.152]  and Ph.D.
[02:08:55.152 --> 02:08:57.674]  in Physics and Technology Education.
[02:08:57.674 --> 02:09:06.140]  His military career has spanned now up to five decades to include combat duty during Vietnam War and Gulf War I. Doug served as a member of the 3rd U.S.
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:13.745]  Army Medical Command Nuclear Biological and Chemical NBC Teaching Medical Response and Special Operations Team, 3rd U.S.
[02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:16.967]  Army Captured Equipment Project Team, and the 3rd U.S.
[02:09:16.967 --> 02:09:20.570]  Army Depleted Uranium Assessment Team during Gulf War Operation Desert Storm.
[02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:21.630]  He was the U.S.
[02:09:21.630 --> 02:09:26.452]  Army Depleted Uranium Project Director of the entire program in 94-95.
[02:09:26.452 --> 02:09:31.934]  He developed the congressionally mandated education and training materials, wrote the U.S.
[02:09:31.934 --> 02:09:33.114]  Army Regulation 700-48, U.S.
[02:09:33.114 --> 02:09:33.394]  Army PAM 748, U.S.
[02:09:33.394 --> 02:09:34.275]  Army Command Task for DU Incidents.
[02:09:41.477 --> 02:09:41.958]  We're good to go.
[02:09:58.473 --> 02:10:08.218]  Undergraduate and graduate courses in environmental science, environmental engineering, nuclear physics, emergency management, and was a staff physicist at the University of Illinois.
[02:10:08.218 --> 02:10:11.000]  And I just can't even go over it before he retired.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.721]  He serves as the advisor of the U.S.
[02:10:12.721 --> 02:10:14.001]  Centers for Disease Control, U.S.
[02:10:14.001 --> 02:10:15.262]  Department of Defense, U.S.
[02:10:15.262 --> 02:10:16.783]  National Academy of Sciences, U.S.
[02:10:16.783 --> 02:10:18.364]  Institute of Medicines, U.S.
[02:10:18.364 --> 02:10:19.024]  Senate, U.S.
[02:10:19.024 --> 02:10:20.005]  House of Representatives, U.S.
[02:10:20.005 --> 02:10:21.745]  Department of Transportation, U.S.
[02:10:21.745 --> 02:10:23.286]  Federal Aviation Administration, U.S.
[02:10:23.286 --> 02:10:23.967]  Department of U.S.
[02:10:23.967 --> 02:10:24.287]  Defense,
[02:10:24.747 --> 02:10:26.348]  General Accounting Office, U.S.
[02:10:26.348 --> 02:10:32.331]  Department of Veterans Affairs, British Royal Society, British House of Lords of Commons, United Nations, U.S.
[02:10:32.331 --> 02:10:35.273]  President Clinton, Presidential Oversight Board.
[02:10:35.273 --> 02:10:37.674]  I mean, I can't even do the whole deal.
[02:10:37.674 --> 02:10:41.596]  The point is he is the expert Dr. D.U.
[02:10:41.596 --> 02:10:42.877]  And we'll go to 40 after with him.
[02:10:42.877 --> 02:10:47.459]  I know he'd say do the whole hour, but I don't want to sit here and exhaust him because I know he's been in rehab and stuff.
[02:10:47.459 --> 02:10:48.580]  That's why I haven't been able to come on.
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:49.621]  It took me a month to get him on.
[02:10:49.621 --> 02:10:51.442]  I wanted to get him on
[02:10:52.765 --> 02:11:14.019]  Because when I had, a month ago, the sailors from the USS Ronald Reagan, who were out there right off the coast of Fukushima doing disaster relief, and who got sick within days, and then now are in wheelchairs, blood coming out their orifices, teeth falling out, kidney failure, all the regular radiation sickness stuff.
[02:11:14.019 --> 02:11:15.620]  Standard procedure stuff.
[02:11:16.755 --> 02:11:22.864]  I thought about Doug Rocky because they didn't even tell them they needed potassium iodate when they were on the ship.
[02:11:22.864 --> 02:11:25.528]  Only those that went on shore at the site were given that.
[02:11:26.744 --> 02:11:31.207]  Even though they admitted they went through the plume and knew it, and radiation detectors were going off.
[02:11:31.207 --> 02:11:44.074]  When our reporters were out in California, the San Francisco paper reported, yes, there's 14 times, and 10 times, and 5 times the regular millisievert level, but we're not going to investigate, it's no big deal.
[02:11:44.074 --> 02:11:45.756]  Well, 20 years ago, it would be a big deal.
[02:11:45.756 --> 02:11:52.960]  So there's this attitude now, since about 1990, that DU, it doesn't matter, it's not a problem anymore.
[02:11:54.324 --> 02:11:58.305]  And you're seeing almost everybody that worked on TEPCO dying now.
[02:11:58.305 --> 02:12:03.366]  And then you saw Dr. Doug Rocky and his team and the hell they went through.
[02:12:03.366 --> 02:12:06.327]  And then not taking care of the troops once they get sick.
[02:12:06.327 --> 02:12:12.288]  That was the sailors we had on, can't even get medical care when they go into the VA.
[02:12:12.288 --> 02:12:17.169]  And they've got catheters in them, you know, three years after Fukushima.
[02:12:17.918 --> 02:12:40.275]  And it's everything that Dr. Doug broke down, so he is the man to talk about his experience in the Gulf War, what happened, and now, when I used to get Dr. Doug Roeke on 16 years ago, I've been talking to him since about 1998, so I guess 16 years, since all that's happened, they've gone from letting him sit on the ammo of .50 cal DU and the Sabos and the Abrams,
[02:12:42.777 --> 02:12:46.259]  It's just a medical and environmental catastrophe.
[02:12:46.259 --> 02:12:46.779]  It's never ended.
[02:13:07.406 --> 02:13:16.533]  When we go back and all the stuff that I learned as the director of the depleted uranium project and having to get the task by name to clean up the mess during Desert Storm.
[02:13:16.533 --> 02:13:23.658]  Well, I gotta remember we had a direct order to disregard the health and environmental effects, alter all our reports, or avoid all liability.
[02:13:23.658 --> 02:13:33.845]  I mean, the United States is deliberately and willfully, the US military leadership has contaminated air, water, and soil all over the world with uranium munitions.
[02:13:34.557 --> 02:13:40.502]  We went in saying, well, we're going into these countries to give them freedom, and all we did is bomb them into oblivion.
[02:13:40.502 --> 02:13:42.083]  And what they've done to the U.S.
[02:13:42.083 --> 02:13:45.906]  military, all of us that they've sent into this, well, it's just catastrophic.
[02:13:45.906 --> 02:13:55.835]  I mean, during Operation Desert Storm, which supposedly was 100 hours, well, it was a lot longer than that, really, but we have less than 1,000 actual casualties.
[02:13:55.835 --> 02:13:59.658]  That's wounded in action, killed in action, and everything during the war.
[02:14:00.694 --> 02:14:10.820]  But now you've got probably 60% of those who participate in Desert Storm trying to get medical care because of all the complex toxic exposures, and DEU is just one of them.
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:21.526]  And then we had Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, which the invasion plans, as you know, we wrote during the 1990s, had nothing to do with 9-1-1, zero, nada, nothing.
[02:14:21.526 --> 02:14:27.089]  And now we're looking at a million and a half casualties out of that, and the backlog
[02:14:27.856 --> 02:14:36.399]  And the Veterans Benefit Administration awarding medical care is so broken and staggering and when anybody puts information in it disappears.
[02:14:36.399 --> 02:14:38.040]  I'll give you an example.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:43.742]  In my own medical record from the Danville Brigade, they submitted over 200 pages to the Chicago Regional Office.
[02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:49.104]  The letter from the Chicago Regional Office says you don't have any problems, we've only got six pages.
[02:14:49.104 --> 02:14:50.504]  And I hear that day in and day out.
[02:14:50.504 --> 02:14:55.166]  I mean there isn't a single day where I don't have somebody or a spouse or a kid or a father
[02:14:55.979 --> 02:14:58.180]  Somebody contact me and say, help, what do we do?
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:59.801]  How do we get medical care?
[02:14:59.801 --> 02:15:02.222]  Going all the way back to the nuclear testing.
[02:15:02.222 --> 02:15:12.988]  Well, as you told me 16, 17 years ago on air, they go in with their kidneys fellin' and they go, here's some Prozac, or the new drugs, and then I have these Navy vets on who are having to sue.
[02:15:12.988 --> 02:15:17.870]  They won't even give them medical attention because they don't want to admit they've got radiation poisoning.
[02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:20.331]  Well, they can't admit they have any of these toxic exposures.
[02:15:20.331 --> 02:15:23.793]  Just for example, right here in Chattanooga, Illinois, Chattanooga Air Force Base.
[02:15:24.804 --> 02:15:53.149]  Total confirmation, the trichloroethane contamination in the Wisconsin Aquifer, you've got the documents, you can verify it, exceeds what they know at Camp Lejeune, and everybody in the military and the VA and DOD is freaking out about Camp Lejeune and the health effects, but they're disregarding all of these other installations, all these bases are contaminated, because to admit one, they have to admit all, and once they have to admit all, they have to provide medical care to everybody, going way back before.
[02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:54.160]  That's right.
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.444]  And by the way, every time you come on, you always send us a bunch of documents.
[02:15:57.444 --> 02:16:01.408]  So while you're talking about this, for radio listeners, he's putting it on screen.
[02:16:01.408 --> 02:16:05.232]  And by tomorrow, we'll have that video archived from the live feed that's going on now.
[02:16:05.232 --> 02:16:07.374]  It'll be on Infowars.com for everybody.
[02:16:07.374 --> 02:16:14.302]  Like the Pentagon's own reports that you cite, where they admit DU's killing the Tribs, but then they still deny it on the news.
[02:16:14.302 --> 02:16:15.403]  It's just dastardly.
[02:16:16.212 --> 02:16:17.053]  Yeah, they don't care.
[02:16:17.053 --> 02:16:24.777]  I mean, you have to understand, in March of 1991, the Los Alamos Memorandum was issued, and I was handed that by the General.
[02:16:24.777 --> 02:16:32.321]  And it was a direct order to lie in our reports, to avoid liability, knowing full well all of the serious health and environmental effects.
[02:16:32.321 --> 02:16:38.725]  You can't take radiological materials, chemical and biological materials distributed all over the world, all over an area,
[02:16:39.648 --> 02:16:45.730]  Release it and not expect the health effects which have been known from day one and then just say, well, there's no problem.
[02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:48.451]  You're all making it up in your imagination.
[02:16:48.451 --> 02:17:03.777]  And then what they do, and this is what's horrible, absolutely horrible, is they give them psychotropic drugs and all this other stuff that have no effect there other than dumbing them down and make them feel good for a few minutes, but it doesn't solve the problem.
[02:17:03.777 --> 02:17:05.418]  I mean, it doesn't solve the problem.
[02:17:05.418 --> 02:17:06.578]  All it does is mask it.
[02:17:07.296 --> 02:17:16.540]  And the next thing we know is we've got suicide upon suicide, and kids giving up, and families giving up, and families in crisis, and child and spouse abuse.
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:19.981]  Oh my.
[02:17:19.981 --> 02:17:22.462]  Dr. Doug Rockey is our guest.
[02:17:22.462 --> 02:17:36.168]  Shifting gears then to what you were wanting to talk about, and what I wanted to get you on about, Fukushima, and the same story, oh it's not a big deal, and then not even helping the people that were on the ships or on the ground, who are all getting incredibly sick on record.
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:48.970]  The Fukushima thing, when that first started, when that happened, I was in the Warrington Clinic, number one clinic for health effects on my and my team, in Washington D.C.
[02:17:48.970 --> 02:17:50.672]  with the number one doctors at the U.S.
[02:17:50.672 --> 02:17:52.433]  Department of Internal Affairs.
[02:17:52.433 --> 02:17:53.654]  And they're sitting there looking.
[02:17:53.654 --> 02:17:54.375]  It's all here.
[02:17:54.375 --> 02:17:54.855]  It's all here.
[02:17:54.855 --> 02:17:56.056]  Everything you said is all here.
[02:17:56.056 --> 02:17:56.617]  Wait a minute.
[02:17:56.617 --> 02:17:58.819]  You're teaching us and we're supposed to be taking care of you.
[02:17:59.662 --> 02:18:04.584]  So when this is all happening there, I'm standing there and saying, we need to take care of these people immediately.
[02:18:04.584 --> 02:18:11.948]  We need to provide them the mandatory radiobioassays, and look at this stuff, for which we have the document.
[02:18:11.948 --> 02:18:12.968]  Here's the orders.
[02:18:12.968 --> 02:18:13.529]  Who wrote them?
[02:18:13.529 --> 02:18:14.209]  They look at you.
[02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:15.249]  Doug, you did, didn't you?
[02:18:15.249 --> 02:18:15.470]  Yeah.
[02:18:15.470 --> 02:18:16.950]  I go, yeah, about that.
[02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:19.031]  Why aren't you taking care of those people?
[02:18:19.031 --> 02:18:22.293]  Now, as you mentioned, they talked about potassium iodide.
[02:18:22.293 --> 02:18:23.193]  That's irrelevant.
[02:18:23.193 --> 02:18:28.836]  The only thing that does is it blocks the absorption of iodine-131, the radioactive iodide.
[02:18:32.868 --> 02:18:41.672]  Yeah, but the radiation is still zapped, your button is still in the body.
[02:18:41.672 --> 02:18:47.034]  So just because the thyroid doesn't absorb that one, it's already in the body, it's already there, so the damage is done.
[02:18:47.034 --> 02:18:51.336]  It's sort of like you turn the light on, once the light comes off, you turn the light on, your body is hurt.
[02:18:52.065 --> 02:18:56.327]  But then you have all the incredible particulates and contamination.
[02:18:56.327 --> 02:19:02.111]  So when all that happened, I literally contacted the Navy, the Ronald Reagan, because I got their emails and everything.
[02:19:02.111 --> 02:19:03.912]  I said, this is what you need to do.
[02:19:03.912 --> 02:19:10.976]  Here are the regulations mandated for training, mandated for environmental remediation, mandated for decontamination.
[02:19:10.976 --> 02:19:15.459]  And it's a nuclear-powered carrier, so they should know to follow their own rules.
[02:19:15.459 --> 02:19:15.819]  Correct.
[02:19:15.819 --> 02:19:17.400]  I've crawled all over that carrier.
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:19.541]  I mean, personally, I've crawled all over that carrier.
[02:19:20.231 --> 02:19:23.813]  I mean, I've been, you know, I haven't been down in the reactor department, but I've been all over it.
[02:19:23.813 --> 02:19:27.936]  And the thing is, you have a warrant of all things, so all this contamination was brought in.
[02:19:27.936 --> 02:19:31.898]  So they were less than a mile offshore at the reactor, all the stuff came in.
[02:19:31.898 --> 02:19:34.059]  Now all the people are sick.
[02:19:34.059 --> 02:19:40.783]  Now, the medical care should be provided, and it should have been done day one, but they didn't do it because they can't acknowledge it.
[02:19:40.783 --> 02:19:47.067]  Now the question that's come up, and the latest information I got from some of the sailors that have called here, and the parents that have called here,
[02:19:47.797 --> 02:19:55.079]  Is the question is whether or not the Ronald Reagan needs to be totally scrapped as a ship because of the extensive contamination.
[02:19:55.079 --> 02:20:08.903]  Now what we learned from the research I did in both in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, but more important at the Nevada test site, Mercury, Nevada for the Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Geiger counters don't work.
[02:20:08.903 --> 02:20:14.024]  And you can take all day long and you're not going to find the contamination because of the way it works.
[02:20:14.024 --> 02:20:16.145]  And that's why so many people are sick.
[02:20:16.781 --> 02:20:31.508]  So when you look at the health effects on all of us, and everybody else, and all the Iraqis, and everybody else has been contaminated, the guys in Somalia, the Balkans, all over the place, Vieques, Puerto Rico, Hawaii is a nightmare on the main island of Hawaii and Oahu from D.U.
[02:20:32.975 --> 02:20:37.956]  And you see, the health effects are absolutely what's listed in the official VA document.
[02:20:37.956 --> 02:20:40.136]  So what should happen to the Ronald Reagan?
[02:20:40.136 --> 02:20:40.916]  Pardon?
[02:20:40.916 --> 02:20:42.797]  Well, what should happen to the Ronald Reagan, then?
[02:20:42.797 --> 02:20:48.278]  Well, the Ronald Reagan, what should have happened right off the bat is the ship should have been pulled and decontaminated if they could even do it.
[02:20:48.278 --> 02:20:55.199]  The other thing, too, is they've got to get bio-assays of medical care based on the signs and symptoms all the soldiers or sailors are having.
[02:20:55.199 --> 02:20:57.680]  Well, this is the big issue I want to ask you, then.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:59.680]  And this is the crux of it.
[02:21:01.837 --> 02:21:11.222]  The troops have been treated like worse than birdcage liner for a long time, but undoubtedly the last few decades it's gotten even worse.
[02:21:11.222 --> 02:21:21.329]  The attitude with the deadly dust on 9-11 that they knew was deadly and they decided to cover up because they didn't want to admit it was deadly, with the DU, with Fukushima,
[02:21:22.289 --> 02:21:25.952]  With things that are in vaccines and things that are in drugs.
[02:21:25.952 --> 02:21:29.154]  I mean even in the 60s if a drug was hurting people they would recall it.
[02:21:29.154 --> 02:21:29.754]  I've read it.
[02:21:29.754 --> 02:21:30.815]  I've studied it.
[02:21:30.815 --> 02:21:33.557]  They weren't perfect then but there were a lot of recalls.
[02:21:33.557 --> 02:21:40.561]  Now they'll recall something if it's petty and doesn't matter but if it's really big they'll just ignore it and keep going ahead with it.
[02:21:40.561 --> 02:21:51.569]  So what I'm asking you is what is the cultural change or has it always been there to absolutely not care about human life and just contaminate everything and is it getting worse?
[02:21:52.049 --> 02:21:53.510]  It's greed.
[02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:55.993]  I mean, it's greed and money and control and power.
[02:21:55.993 --> 02:22:02.258]  I mean, look at everything that's happened throughout the Middle East and now into the Soviet Union and the Ukraine.
[02:22:02.258 --> 02:22:07.243]  All of this is about control of resources, control of terrain, control of pipeline things to get it over.
[02:22:07.243 --> 02:22:08.904]  Who's going to control what?
[02:22:08.904 --> 02:22:11.287]  I mean, we're looking at all the stuff in Syria.
[02:22:11.287 --> 02:22:18.313]  That's all about the pipeline coming out of Iraq and everything, and Iran across through Syria out to the coast.
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:27.888]  And they've got to get that off us so Assad doesn't want to go along with the same thing of what happened in Afghanistan, what's happened in Iraq, we're seeing it happen in Ukraine.
[02:22:27.888 --> 02:22:35.616]  So you've got all the powers that be that want to control everything, but they disregard the health and environmental effects of their military operations.
[02:22:35.616 --> 02:22:36.797]  It's sort of like, I mean, with the U.S.
[02:22:36.797 --> 02:22:40.680]  military, how many nations have we attacked and invaded now since I joined the military in 67?
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:43.841]  How many countries have we destroyed?
[02:22:43.841 --> 02:22:45.142]  How much have we contaminated?
[02:22:45.142 --> 02:22:47.404]  How many people have gotten sick and died?
[02:22:47.404 --> 02:22:51.326]  Not from the actual combat operations, from the toxic exposures.
[02:22:51.326 --> 02:22:52.727]  It's in the millions in the U.S.
[02:22:52.727 --> 02:22:54.268]  military.
[02:22:54.268 --> 02:22:56.570]  And now you've got all of the health effects on the civilians.
[02:22:56.570 --> 02:23:04.415]  It's sort of like, right here in Chanute Air Force Base, Rantoul, Illinois, the triclore helpline is off base, into the water supplies.
[02:23:04.415 --> 02:23:09.018]  The houses where we know the contamination is based, and you've got the report, you've got the map showing it,
[02:23:09.932 --> 02:23:13.833]  They took the people off the map so they don't show up in any map, anything.
[02:23:13.833 --> 02:23:15.673]  You won't find it unless you go look for the house.
[02:23:15.673 --> 02:23:22.975]  And then they disavow any contamination in the water supply, even though it's on their own report that confirms it.
[02:23:22.975 --> 02:23:23.835]  It's staggering.
[02:23:23.835 --> 02:23:29.777]  And then anybody that tries to speak up, like the reporters or myself or anybody, boy, watch out.
[02:23:29.777 --> 02:23:31.717]  You're not going to even be able to buy groceries in town.
[02:23:34.121 --> 02:23:35.622]  We're going to put that map up.
[02:23:35.622 --> 02:23:38.164]  We have it on screen of the contamination there.
[02:23:38.164 --> 02:23:40.985]  Just an example of this attitude.
[02:23:40.985 --> 02:23:52.232]  And now under Homeland Security rules, they want to make it illegal to expose toxic waste dumping if it's done by a quote, infrastructure protected corporation or government group.
[02:23:52.232 --> 02:23:58.236]  And I don't get where all these elites think their kids are going to grow up when they could care less about the world.
[02:23:58.236 --> 02:23:59.817]  I mean, I think you're right.
[02:23:59.817 --> 02:24:00.418]  I think it's a
[02:24:01.596 --> 02:24:19.891]  Greed-based, decadent disconnect by the ruling class worldwide, kind of like the Soviets would throw nuclear reactors in a lake, too lazy to even bury it, or TEPCO would just have bulldozers lightly bury fuel rods that were ejected two miles into farmers' fields.
[02:24:19.891 --> 02:24:21.252]  It just seems like
[02:24:22.426 --> 02:24:24.207]  An absolute total laziness.
[02:24:24.207 --> 02:24:28.209]  I mean, if I got a fuel rod, I would be put in prison as a terrorist.
[02:24:28.209 --> 02:24:33.732]  Or, if they caught me burying a fuel rod on my property, I'd get 100 years in jail, under the laws.
[02:24:33.732 --> 02:24:37.734]  But when government or corporations do it, it's just like, eh, so what?
[02:24:37.734 --> 02:24:39.916]  What is going on here?
[02:24:39.916 --> 02:24:41.056]  I wish I had the answer.
[02:24:41.056 --> 02:24:46.459]  I mean, it's a cover-up and a disregard because I think all these people that made the decisions are gone, alright?
[02:24:46.459 --> 02:24:47.380]  That caused this stuff.
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:49.561]  And some that are still making decisions are in power.
[02:24:50.549 --> 02:24:57.112]  But what they have to do is disavow any connection because then they have to admit they messed up and now take responsibility for it.
[02:24:57.112 --> 02:25:00.114]  It's sort of like up there in Western Washington, okay?
[02:25:00.114 --> 02:25:08.418]  Anybody that's blowing the whistle up there on all the nuclear studies and nuclear waste and the tanks that are leaking up there, you know, in Western Washington,
[02:25:09.187 --> 02:25:15.992]  The message got the other day is the, just like on me, the retaliation and, you know, destroy the whistleblower.
[02:25:15.992 --> 02:25:22.878]  And we're not really whistleblowers, we're telling the truth to ensure medical care based on their own internal requirements.
[02:25:22.878 --> 02:25:32.385]  Now granted and depleted right now, I wrote the regulations, but General Shinseki, who is now the Secretary of the VA, is the guy that ordered me to do it based on the direct input I gave him.
[02:25:32.385 --> 02:25:33.986]  He got the documents.
[02:25:33.986 --> 02:25:38.350]  And then, once he signed the Army regulations, he never enforced them as an Army General.
[02:25:39.111 --> 02:25:47.698]  And now, as the Secretary of the VA disavows any of it there, and his own staff goes around saying, well, there's nobody sick, nobody's sick, and let's say they know everybody is.
[02:25:48.584 --> 02:26:06.058]  Well, and of course, this phenomenon that's always been there, but it's getting worse, now leaks into every area with the test scores dropping, the cancer rates going up 3,000% in North America, the breast cancer up even more, the diabetes, the brain disorders, the neurological disorders.
[02:26:06.058 --> 02:26:13.705]  I mean, you look at every metric, doctor, and I know you've got multiple degrees and have seen it from so many angles.
[02:26:13.705 --> 02:26:15.666]  What is happening biologically to
[02:26:17.961 --> 02:26:20.884]  North Americans, why are we dying?
[02:26:20.884 --> 02:26:28.270]  Dr. Andres Kornegay-Bas said this at the 1999 Center for Disease Control Conference we had on Gulf War Illness.
[02:26:28.270 --> 02:26:36.237]  And he said, what you have, and we figured this all out, you have all these complex toxic exposures, low-level exposures, continually, because of the lifestyle we selected.
[02:26:37.085 --> 02:26:51.257]  People want all these advantages in lifestyle, not realizing that the anthem from the 60s and the 70s, when you and I were in college starting it, is better living through chemistry, is actually slow death through chemistry and biology.
[02:26:51.257 --> 02:26:53.119]  You can't contaminate air, water, and soil.
[02:26:53.119 --> 02:26:55.480]  You can't put all this stuff into foods.
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:59.144]  When you look at the foods that are natural and everything that are well done, they're not there.
[02:26:59.144 --> 02:27:02.526]  You look at the houses where they don't have all the outgassing in them.
[02:27:02.526 --> 02:27:04.308]  You don't see all the health problems we have.
[02:27:05.057 --> 02:27:05.317]  I think so.
[02:27:19.714 --> 02:27:29.901]  I was about to say, even Time Magazine admits the chemicals in the fluoride are reducing IQ, and now they're not calling it Alzheimer's when 20-year-olds get it.
[02:27:29.901 --> 02:27:37.867]  They're calling it, you know, early onset of degenerative neurological functions, so suddenly 20-year-olds are getting Alzheimer's now, Doctor.
[02:27:37.867 --> 02:27:40.209]  Well, see, that's what we saw with Desert Storm Kids.
[02:27:40.209 --> 02:27:45.592]  We had a complex toxic exposure, acute exposures on extraordinarily healthy individuals.
[02:27:45.592 --> 02:27:46.353]  All of us were healthy.
[02:27:47.091 --> 02:27:54.997]  And then you saw incredible numbers going down with incredible diseases, where you saw a 20-year-old with the physiology of a 70-year-old.
[02:27:54.997 --> 02:27:57.199]  And you saw all these problems, and it's continued.
[02:27:57.199 --> 02:28:00.922]  And now Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, it's the same thing.
[02:28:00.922 --> 02:28:15.033]  But then, what's even worse, I mean, just tears me apart, is civilians in these areas where we've totally contaminated, have no access to medical, they have no access to clean water, they have no access to clean sanitation, have no access to good food.
[02:28:16.586 --> 02:28:18.648]  And the whole area is just deteriorating.
[02:28:18.648 --> 02:28:21.210]  So report after report after report.
[02:28:21.210 --> 02:28:26.275]  Yeah Fallujah has 14 times to 16 times depending on the study, higher levels of birth defects.
[02:28:26.275 --> 02:28:27.636]  The troops have triple.
[02:28:27.636 --> 02:28:40.346]  I know a lot of veterans who are 25, 30 years old and almost all of them, Hispanic, black and white, but especially the Hispanic and white guys, all of them when you look at them, they've got already have gray hair.
[02:28:41.247 --> 02:28:45.428]  And it's not just stress and they've got health problems and they've got kidney problems.
[02:28:45.428 --> 02:28:46.108]  What's going on?
[02:28:46.108 --> 02:28:52.170]  Disavowing the connection between all the toxic exposures and the health effects of liability.
[02:28:52.170 --> 02:29:01.352]  If we told the American public the truth about the health effects of all of our military operations, whether they're overseas or here at Chinoot or in Hawaii,
[02:29:02.245 --> 02:29:03.367]  I mean, they're going to all fall apart.
[02:29:03.367 --> 02:29:10.936]  It's sort of like, who would want to go to the main island of Hawaii or go on to Oahu when Schofield Barracks and Oakwood train area are totally contaminated?
[02:29:10.936 --> 02:29:16.183]  And the military, as we speak, are blowing up the contamination and spreading it all over.
[02:29:16.183 --> 02:29:19.507]  With total cart block approval from every
[02:29:20.171 --> 02:29:20.932]  Organization.
[02:29:20.932 --> 02:29:23.133]  We've had Nuclear Regulatory Commission hearings.
[02:29:23.133 --> 02:29:24.534]  We've had EPA hearings.
[02:29:24.534 --> 02:29:26.916]  We've gone to the State Department of Public Health.
[02:29:26.916 --> 02:29:28.577]  Both to Illinois and Hawaii.
[02:29:50.652 --> 02:29:52.055]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.055 --> 02:29:53.418]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.418 --> 02:29:54.841]  Sounds like the legend of Atlantis.
[02:29:54.841 --> 02:29:57.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.411 --> 02:30:04.732]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:30:04.732 --> 02:30:07.152]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:30:07.152 --> 02:30:15.754]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:30:15.754 --> 02:30:23.716]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[02:30:24.056 --> 02:30:32.087]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:30:32.087 --> 02:30:39.697]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:30:40.117 --> 02:30:46.441]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:30:46.441 --> 02:30:55.186]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[02:31:01.530 --> 02:31:12.217]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:31:12.217 --> 02:31:14.258]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:31:14.258 --> 02:31:15.159]  Fluoride!
[02:31:15.159 --> 02:31:17.581]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:31:17.581 --> 02:31:23.645]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:31:23.645 --> 02:31:28.568]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:31:28.568 --> 02:31:31.290]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:32.110]  We're good.
[02:32:01.434 --> 02:32:03.335]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:32:03.335 --> 02:32:06.976]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:32:06.976 --> 02:32:11.537]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:32:11.537 --> 02:32:17.619]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:32:17.619 --> 02:32:28.623]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:32:28.623 --> 02:32:31.084]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate
[02:32:31.464 --> 02:32:35.105]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:32:35.105 --> 02:32:52.411]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:32:52.411 --> 02:32:57.733]  Get your ProPure with a new Pro1 filter today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:33:11.886 --> 02:33:27.418]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:27.418 --> 02:33:28.819]  Take cell phones.
[02:33:28.819 --> 02:33:35.263]  They did studies back in the 80s with the microwave radiation and knew that it would vibrate the DNA strands, breaking them.
[02:33:36.633 --> 02:33:46.176]  And of course your cells only replicate so many times, then they start malfunctioning and you get mutation, you get cancer, to put it in layman's terms, and it increases cancer.
[02:33:46.176 --> 02:33:49.457]  And now there are medical doctors everywhere saying they're seeing 10,000, 20,000 times.
[02:33:49.457 --> 02:33:52.677]  Because before it didn't even exist.
[02:33:52.677 --> 02:33:58.179]  It's even a slight increase of thousands of percentage points of brain tumors on the very side of the head where people hold their cell phone.
[02:33:59.646 --> 02:34:00.506]  I know this is a fact.
[02:34:00.506 --> 02:34:04.289]  I can't get friends or family or anybody to use the, you know, the wire plugged into it.
[02:34:04.289 --> 02:34:08.293]  Studies show that reduces it a lot, but still fries whatever's close to it.
[02:34:08.293 --> 02:34:12.657]  For microwaves, every length of the transmitter that you're away from it is...
[02:34:13.869 --> 02:34:20.013]  Half a level lower or more of less radiation than you'd be getting.
[02:34:20.013 --> 02:34:21.974]  And it's all different types of radiation.
[02:34:21.974 --> 02:34:22.714]  I'm no engineer.
[02:34:22.714 --> 02:34:23.735]  I've had engineers on.
[02:34:23.735 --> 02:34:24.676]  I've had physicists.
[02:34:24.676 --> 02:34:26.457]  I've had nuclear physicists.
[02:34:26.457 --> 02:34:27.898]  I've had chemical physicists on.
[02:34:27.898 --> 02:34:29.479]  I've broken it down.
[02:34:29.479 --> 02:34:32.660]  And they know the cell phones are killing people.
[02:34:32.660 --> 02:34:36.983]  They know putting cell phone towers on top of schools are a death sentence.
[02:34:36.983 --> 02:34:42.987]  They don't tell you to move into an apartment building that, hey, you don't want to live on the top floor or the top few floors right underneath the cell tower.
[02:34:44.437 --> 02:34:52.399]  I don't want to tell you what all this is doing to you, and it's just an attitude of come out with any technology and then just deploy it.
[02:34:52.399 --> 02:34:56.300]  And oh, put a smart meter on your house and let it fry you and spy on you.
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:34:58.521]  Dr. Doug Rockey is our guest.
[02:34:58.521 --> 02:35:01.661]  Doctor, is there any websites you want to put out for documentation?
[02:35:01.661 --> 02:35:02.882]  We've been putting a lot of the U.S.
[02:35:02.882 --> 02:35:05.262]  government documents on screen you've been talking about.
[02:35:05.262 --> 02:35:09.243]  Or is there anything you'd like to tell people about where they can learn more about what's happening?
[02:35:09.243 --> 02:35:11.324]  But in a larger issue after you talk about that,
[02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:21.958]  I want to give you the floor to talk about whatever you think is most important, not just my questions, and to ask you about where you think this is going.
[02:35:21.958 --> 02:35:25.918]  Okay, first off, you're not going to find this on your general website.
[02:35:25.918 --> 02:35:29.399]  You're not going to find the information at the Department of Defense or the VA website.
[02:35:29.399 --> 02:35:31.859]  They just don't even put it up there.
[02:35:31.859 --> 02:35:34.980]  The key, there's two websites that have been absolutely incredible.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:36.980]  One is called grassrootspeace.org.
[02:35:42.316 --> 02:35:47.838]  S-R-O-O-T-S-P-H-E-E-D-O-T-O-R-G.
[02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:54.440]  And that was the original trap rock that the Quakers, Sonny Miller and Charlie Jinks, put together, and they're maintaining it.
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:58.442]  The other one, where you'll find the government documents, and again, that's another documentary.
[02:35:58.442 --> 02:36:01.023]  I mean, we've done numerous documentaries.
[02:36:01.023 --> 02:36:05.724]  But, uh, Joyce Riley on the Power Hour, they have a documentary called Beyond Treason.
[02:36:05.724 --> 02:36:08.145]  And the beyondtreason.com website,
[02:36:08.982 --> 02:36:12.883]  Has all its regulations, the orders, the directives, the medical core things.
[02:36:12.883 --> 02:36:13.343]  All those things.
[02:36:13.343 --> 02:36:14.244]  Excellent.
[02:36:14.244 --> 02:36:15.524]  Excellent documentary.
[02:36:15.524 --> 02:36:20.106]  And I'm just glad over the years that she's really, with Dave von Kleist, hammered that.
[02:36:20.106 --> 02:36:22.286]  So it's key for folks to check out both those sites.
[02:36:22.286 --> 02:36:27.688]  Now, continuing, I just talked about the cell phones, all the different types of radiation.
[02:36:27.688 --> 02:36:29.448]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:36:29.448 --> 02:36:37.491]  Well, you have to remember, I mean, during Desert Storm, again, I had the responsibility for picking up the safety for the RF hazards and, you know,
[02:36:38.092 --> 02:36:39.013]  We're good to go.
[02:36:56.173 --> 02:36:57.714]  10 milliwatts per square centimeter.
[02:36:57.714 --> 02:36:59.974]  That is the total exclusion zone.
[02:36:59.974 --> 02:37:09.237]  So if that's the total exclusion zone, you can guarantee that the health effects thing are probably one one-hundredth or one one-thousandth of that, when it's up close.
[02:37:09.237 --> 02:37:22.481]  So what we do know happened, the way the RF works and everything is not ionizing, but what it does is cause the water molecule to vibrate and fracture and it destroys the water in the cells and everything else, the RNA, DNA, because that's all water.
[02:37:22.481 --> 02:37:23.901]  It just destroys it in place.
[02:37:24.702 --> 02:37:28.223]  So all of that stuff is known to go on forever and ever and ever.
[02:37:28.223 --> 02:37:37.787]  So when you stick that RF waver up there, or you know, the military comes in and this freaks me out because they got the new Buck Rogers ray gun that they've deployed all over the United States.
[02:37:37.787 --> 02:37:40.008]  They use it in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:37:40.008 --> 02:37:46.171]  And what it is is an RF microwave ray gun that's on top of both the Humvee, on top of the buildings and everything.
[02:37:46.171 --> 02:37:48.392]  They just beam it at somebody and cook them alive.
[02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:51.353]  So it's like taking your body and putting it in a microwave oven and cooking it.
[02:37:52.409 --> 02:38:01.514]  So we've got that out there, and we've heard story upon story where people said, you know, all of a sudden I got burned and I got cooked, and it's people, it really is real and it's really happening.
[02:38:01.514 --> 02:38:02.995]  You know, so we've got all of this stuff.
[02:38:02.995 --> 02:38:06.877]  We've got a total disregard for everything.
[02:38:06.877 --> 02:38:18.304]  The incredible contamination that we're seeing from military operations, whether it's research or training back here in the states, or if the installations are totally contaminated,
[02:38:19.016 --> 02:38:29.000]  Or where we've destroyed the infrastructure of these nations and contaminated it with our weapon systems has left a catastrophe for which there is no medical care and treatment.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:41.465]  Like when I was in medical care yesterday at the Danville VA, the agreement was all we can do, Doug, is optimize the remaining function that you have and we've got to optimize the remaining function of all the kids that are coming in here.
[02:38:41.465 --> 02:38:44.627]  Well, I've had a full life and a full career, but what do we do with that 22 year old
[02:38:45.856 --> 02:39:07.130]  That has the function of a 70-year-old from the neuromuscular capability is in pain, has all of these psychological problems, not from a mental illness, but from the fact that they're having a method, ethical and moral breakdown crisis from realizing, wait a minute, we killed and invaded this nation over total lives and now I'm supposed to believe and go along with it?
[02:39:11.093 --> 02:39:21.619]  Again, I think it's a basic issue of sanity, and then meanwhile the elite obsess over carbon taxes on what comes out of coal power plants, water and carbon dioxide.
[02:39:21.619 --> 02:39:23.981]  They obsess over how big your house is.
[02:39:23.981 --> 02:39:31.365]  They obsess over things like that, but then don't even care about all the real environmental crises that are going on.
[02:39:31.365 --> 02:39:37.189]  And it looks like government a lot of times is the biggest polluter because they're exempt.
[02:39:37.189 --> 02:39:38.990]  It's just really mind-blowing.
[02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:40.491]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:39:41.445 --> 02:39:49.789]  Well, I just hope God can make a change and get people to start changing their actions before God makes the ultimate decision and everything gets wiped out.
[02:39:49.789 --> 02:39:51.430]  We're seeing this whole wipeout now.
[02:39:51.430 --> 02:39:58.673]  As you mentioned, incredible birth defects, incredible learning disabilities, incredible respiratory, high rates of cancers.
[02:39:58.673 --> 02:40:00.014]  We didn't see this before.
[02:40:00.014 --> 02:40:01.114]  We didn't have this.
[02:40:01.114 --> 02:40:06.677]  And now we're better living through chemistry, better living through biology, better living through radiation.
[02:40:07.387 --> 02:40:12.549]  All we've done is created a medical disaster for which there is no way out.
[02:40:12.549 --> 02:40:20.012]  And, uh, we've gotta wake up, but anytime I try to get people to wake up, they say, well, you're lying, you didn't tell the truth, you're making this all up.
[02:40:20.012 --> 02:40:23.734]  Until, like, you, what you were, here's the document, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:23.734 --> 02:40:32.698]  It's not one that the guys yelling and screaming and trying to correct that created, it's the internal document of the government confirming the problems that they disavow exist.
[02:40:35.714 --> 02:40:36.875]  It's so frustrating.
[02:40:36.875 --> 02:40:39.316]  Again, it's not like we're like goody two-shoes.
[02:40:39.316 --> 02:40:42.158]  I mean, I don't think, I think of you as a hero, but I don't think of myself.
[02:40:42.158 --> 02:40:44.540]  People say, oh, thank you for covering what you're covering.
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:48.863]  Thank you for not wanting them to completely destroy the planet I live on.
[02:40:48.863 --> 02:40:52.985]  I mean, it just, it just seems like there's no common sense.
[02:40:52.985 --> 02:40:56.167]  It'd be like if your neighbor's house was on fire and there was high winds.
[02:40:57.288 --> 02:40:57.428]  I don't
[02:41:18.260 --> 02:41:20.762]  Or not call their neighbor to see if they know?
[02:41:20.762 --> 02:41:24.925]  It's like a jellyfish spectator thing has come upon us.
[02:41:24.925 --> 02:41:26.506]  And I think it's television.
[02:41:26.506 --> 02:41:32.750]  Since the advent of television in the 40s, we've seen just absolute degeneration of society.
[02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:38.615]  And countries that got it later, like in Africa in the 70s, the same pattern.
[02:41:39.679 --> 02:41:46.685]  Where people just grow up watching this, and it's not real, most of it, and so it distorts reality.
[02:41:46.685 --> 02:41:50.507]  You're not down the street talking to your neighbors at the soapbox.
[02:41:50.507 --> 02:41:53.650]  You're not involved with the PTA.
[02:41:53.650 --> 02:42:01.156]  Plus the world, doctor, got so complex, I think that it's like the old legend of Atlantis.
[02:42:01.156 --> 02:42:05.019]  Whether it's true or not, they developed technology so advanced they destroyed themselves.
[02:42:05.845 --> 02:42:12.648]  You know, we've got one of the problems, and as a teacher, and I've taught everything from kindergarten through graduate school now, and I have a lot of fun with the kids.
[02:42:12.648 --> 02:42:13.449]  The kids don't read.
[02:42:13.449 --> 02:42:14.729]  They don't read books.
[02:42:14.729 --> 02:42:15.630]  They don't go to the library.
[02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:20.192]  We'll put program after program together at the library, and I'm totally involved in that run of programs.
[02:42:20.192 --> 02:42:23.654]  We got snowed out here because of the snow and the ice the last couple of weeks.
[02:42:24.676 --> 02:42:27.658]  But it's so bad, see, you can't get the kids to come there and read.
[02:42:27.658 --> 02:42:29.060]  They don't know their math.
[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:33.924]  They're using their calculator or their computer, so they don't know their basic math facts.
[02:42:33.924 --> 02:42:36.406]  They can't do change when you go to the grocery store.
[02:42:36.406 --> 02:42:38.307]  They don't know how to multiply or divide.
[02:42:38.307 --> 02:42:46.494]  So therefore, when they go to get a job, whether they're a carpenter or a plumber or a car mechanic or an electrical engineer, they can't read, write, or do the math.
[02:42:46.494 --> 02:42:50.677]  And when you say, you know, it doesn't cost money to master this stuff.
[02:42:50.677 --> 02:42:52.539]  All it takes is time and effort.
[02:42:53.447 --> 02:42:55.988]  But somehow we keep throwing more and more dollars at it.
[02:42:55.988 --> 02:43:00.470]  Say, well, if we increase the salary of the teacher three times, all of a sudden the kids will start learning.
[02:43:00.470 --> 02:43:01.230]  Wait a minute.
[02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:05.612]  The salary of the teacher has nothing to do with the performance of the child.
[02:43:05.612 --> 02:43:09.114]  And strictly, does the child want to read or write or do the effort?
[02:43:09.114 --> 02:43:11.055]  Do the parents maintain that they're doing it?
[02:43:11.055 --> 02:43:16.817]  And do the parents ensure that the kid behaves themselves when they go in the classroom?
[02:43:16.817 --> 02:43:20.679]  And today, in our class period, in grade school through high school,
[02:43:21.283 --> 02:43:31.481]  You're lucky if you get 15 or 20 minutes actual teaching time because you've got to spend so much time on discipline behavior and making up the stuff that they should have learned already because they didn't take the time to do it.
[02:43:34.588 --> 02:43:36.811]  Doctor, thank you so much for your time.
[02:43:36.811 --> 02:43:38.593]  It's always good to hear from you.
[02:43:38.593 --> 02:43:40.095]  How are you doing medically?
[02:43:40.095 --> 02:43:48.004]  I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but just describe briefly what happened to you and your team around the DU and your experience.
[02:43:48.004 --> 02:43:51.509]  This is an important testimony to have it on record and any other points you'd like to add.
[02:43:52.045 --> 02:43:56.627]  Well, we all got sick within 24 hours of the initial cleanup, which again, the military disavows.
[02:43:56.627 --> 02:43:57.127]  We weren't there.
[02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:59.227]  And that was the highway of death in Kuwait.
[02:43:59.227 --> 02:44:00.528]  Yeah, we weren't there.
[02:44:00.528 --> 02:44:01.548]  But everybody got sick.
[02:44:01.548 --> 02:44:03.409]  The respiratory, the rashes all started.
[02:44:03.409 --> 02:44:07.570]  We had the first cancers in the team members within nine months.
[02:44:07.570 --> 02:44:12.092]  The first death from lung cancer within two years, and it's continued on.
[02:44:12.092 --> 02:44:21.035]  The respiratory problems, the rash problems, the neuromuscular problems, spinal cord problems, kidney problems, the eye problems, the hearing problems are just staggering.
[02:44:21.613 --> 02:44:25.476]  And when the weather starts changing like this, the pain is just astronomical.
[02:44:25.476 --> 02:44:31.740]  I mean, you can't get the pain under control when temperature or barometric pressure starts changing.
[02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:34.101]  And, I mean, I'm lucky.
[02:44:34.101 --> 02:44:45.449]  I've done poor stuff and I have knowledge, but this kid out here that can't get the care, doesn't know what's happened to him, or doesn't have the document to shove up the doctor's wazoo, can't get the care, and then they get flustered.
[02:44:45.449 --> 02:44:50.432]  And I had a spouse contact me right before I came on here, help, help, help, I'm in crisis.
[02:44:51.181 --> 02:44:51.742]  What could you do?
[02:44:51.742 --> 02:44:53.363]  Can you get me help now?
[02:44:53.363 --> 02:44:59.829]  Well, that's what I'm working on before I call, you guys called, and what I'm working on after we get done.
[02:44:59.829 --> 02:45:01.150]  Simply amazing.
[02:45:02.502 --> 02:45:12.764]  And that's what's frustrating when you'll speak out on a subject and everybody calls you and contacts you and you get overwhelmed and then you can't help people as much as you'd like to and then there's this guilty feeling.
[02:45:12.764 --> 02:45:20.766]  Instead of feeling good about trying to do the right thing sometimes, I end up feeling bad because it's like I haven't been able to fix it.
[02:45:20.766 --> 02:45:22.966]  Do you ever have that feeling?
[02:45:22.966 --> 02:45:25.787]  Continuously for over 40 years.
[02:45:25.787 --> 02:45:31.868]  I mean, you know, I remember during the Vietnam War, I bought all this off, you know, and Christmas, I mean Christmas Eve of
[02:45:33.365 --> 02:45:33.846]  We're good to go.
[02:45:51.647 --> 02:45:52.307]  Unbelievable.
[02:46:10.564 --> 02:46:14.108]  And it just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:46:14.108 --> 02:46:16.670]  And you look at all civilizations, they always go this way.
[02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:21.815]  People become decadent, then they become crazy, then they become completely out of their minds.
[02:46:21.815 --> 02:46:26.519]  And it's like the days of Noah, which is crazy people running around in all directions.
[02:46:26.519 --> 02:46:28.641]  And it's just going to get worse and worse.
[02:46:28.641 --> 02:46:30.863]  And I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:46:30.863 --> 02:46:33.366]  I just absolutely wish there was some way to reverse this.
[02:46:34.784 --> 02:46:35.064]  I think so.
[02:46:54.031 --> 02:46:55.312]  Yeah, that's the new thing.
[02:46:55.312 --> 02:47:03.376]  I saw that in the news, where they go, give us your medical records of where, and you're like, I don't have records of when I got shot.
[02:47:03.376 --> 02:47:05.518]  I was in the back of a Humvee in Afghanistan.
[02:47:05.518 --> 02:47:08.279]  What do you mean, give me proof I got shot in Afghanistan?
[02:47:08.279 --> 02:47:09.300]  You're supposed to have that.
[02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:12.562]  Well, one day there was a fire.
[02:47:12.562 --> 02:47:21.547]  I mean, we know from Desert Storm, we loaded the medical records at 3rd Medical Command at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, into the steel connected shipment back to the states.
[02:47:22.918 --> 02:47:23.799]  When Dr. Col.
[02:47:23.799 --> 02:47:26.202]  Andres Carnegie-Bob, Col.
[02:47:26.202 --> 02:47:27.644]  Thomas Little, Col.
[02:47:27.644 --> 02:47:29.346]  Dr. Thomas Little, Col.
[02:47:29.346 --> 02:47:32.830]  Ulrich Bauer got there, the connexions were empty.
[02:47:38.114 --> 02:47:42.756]  Yeah, and I don't know how they get the other military personnel or contractors to throw away people's medical records.
[02:47:42.756 --> 02:47:46.398]  See, everybody's going along with this, or a lot of people are.
[02:47:46.398 --> 02:47:51.801]  Folks ought to get, when you screw somebody else, that allows you to get screwed later.
[02:47:51.801 --> 02:47:56.243]  And it's not even some thing in the universe, though that operates as well as you know, Doctor.
[02:47:58.689 --> 02:48:10.557]  It's that when you actually, the example is if there's a nice community pool you like, I don't mean to be gross here, and you go and not just pee in it, but take a dump in it, and everybody else starts doing it, is that going to be a nice pool to be in?
[02:48:10.557 --> 02:48:11.398]  No.
[02:48:11.398 --> 02:48:16.922]  And I just don't understand how the establishment is absolutely soiling everything.
[02:48:16.922 --> 02:48:18.883]  They're just disgusting people, Doctor.
[02:48:18.883 --> 02:48:20.925]  Well, I think so.
[02:48:20.925 --> 02:48:25.008]  I've been trying, and all the guys I know on our team have been trying to clean it up for a long time.
[02:48:25.008 --> 02:48:26.749]  We're going to continue to try to clean it up.
[02:48:27.378 --> 02:48:34.104]  Despite, you know, overt retaliations and beatings, I mean literally physical and psychological attacks is an ongoing thing.
[02:48:34.104 --> 02:48:39.048]  You've seen the evidence of it, you've seen the photographs, so it's not a question that it doesn't happen.
[02:48:39.048 --> 02:48:41.631]  It's just, why do they keep getting away with it?
[02:48:41.631 --> 02:48:46.735]  Well, the people that allow them to do it are the people in charge, so there's no accountability.
[02:48:46.735 --> 02:48:47.456]  That's right.
[02:48:47.456 --> 02:48:49.558]  All right, Dr. Doug Rockey, thank you so much, sir.
[02:48:50.148 --> 02:48:52.369]  Thank you, sir, and thank you for helping everything.
[02:48:52.369 --> 02:48:53.270]  We'll send you some more.
[02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:55.451]  We got the post-deployment physical assessment form.
[02:48:55.451 --> 02:48:56.532]  I'll send that to you.
[02:48:56.532 --> 02:49:03.736]  We need to make sure that's put up so everybody in the military, from no matter going back to World War II and beyond, can use that to get medical care.
[02:49:03.736 --> 02:49:04.116]  Yeah, we should.
[02:49:04.116 --> 02:49:06.077]  We'll spend a few minutes explaining what that form is.
[02:49:06.077 --> 02:49:07.518]  We'll do an article about it.
[02:49:07.518 --> 02:49:08.118]  Yeah, I sure will.
[02:49:08.118 --> 02:49:10.360]  All right, we'll talk to you again soon, sir.
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:10.960]  Thank you very much.
[02:49:12.517 --> 02:49:15.138]  He's a really good guy, amazing story.
[02:49:15.138 --> 02:49:26.583]  And there's so many people like that out there, and they tell them they're heroes, and tell them they're great, and the media tells you you're great while they're using you, and as soon as they're done, they just throw you out like trash.
[02:49:26.583 --> 02:49:36.328]  And everybody serving the system better understand that, and better think about that, long and hard, so they understand what we're facing.
[02:49:37.315 --> 02:49:40.557]  You know, documents came out, Doug Rocky sent them to us years ago.
[02:49:40.557 --> 02:49:41.538]  He got them from a general.
[02:49:41.538 --> 02:49:42.099]  They were leaked.
[02:49:42.099 --> 02:49:44.380]  It became national news when it happened.
[02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:50.185]  That they knew that Agent Orange was going to cause birth defects and kill the people that used it.
[02:49:50.185 --> 02:49:59.392]  And that they'd actually, in Vietnam, added a synthetic neurotoxin to it to get around the Geneva Convention barring nerve gas being used.
[02:49:59.392 --> 02:50:06.037]  And that they'd actually added a special thing to Agent Orange over there that had a neurotoxin that was really a chemical anti-personnel weapon.
[02:50:07.655 --> 02:50:34.935]  and that that's what people are breathing and it didn't mean it was not just killing the vietnamese the vietcong which is bad enough our own soldiers were breathing that and had lesions all over their organs their hearts you name it and my uncle the doctor jones said looking at scans of his heart and stuff before he died said we see this a lot with helicopter pilots from vietnam an old heart lesion basically a mini heart attack from vietnam and the thing about it monsanto owned that
[02:50:36.716 --> 02:50:37.197]  Billions.
[02:50:37.197 --> 02:50:41.181]  It was billions of dollars back then spraying it.
[02:50:41.181 --> 02:50:42.782]  And it was just a death sentence for everyone.
[02:50:42.782 --> 02:50:45.465]  I mean, just absolute death sentence.
[02:50:45.465 --> 02:50:50.109]  And undoubtedly contributed to my uncle's early demise and other problems in his family.
[02:50:50.109 --> 02:50:52.932]  And it's just an illustration.
[02:50:52.932 --> 02:50:56.736]  An illustration of how this stuff affects everybody.
[02:50:56.736 --> 02:50:59.219]  I mean, these companies are evil.
[02:50:59.219 --> 02:50:59.419]  Evil.

[02:53:12.678 --> 02:53:19.044]  See, the privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.
[02:53:19.044 --> 02:53:25.629]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com now to take your life off the grid and see the loophole in the NSA and FBI spying machine.
[02:53:25.629 --> 02:53:30.273]  Before they close the loophole forever, go to PrivacyLockdown.com.
[02:53:30.273 --> 02:53:36.979]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:53:37.299 --> 02:53:38.700]  Silverlungs.com.

[02:53:46.702 --> 02:53:48.623]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:53:48.623 --> 02:53:54.185]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:53:54.185 --> 02:53:57.986]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.

[02:54:18.484 --> 02:54:22.547]  Non-GMO, great Patriots, best storable food out there.
[02:54:22.547 --> 02:54:24.569]  That's what I and my family use.

[02:54:30.073 --> 02:54:33.316]  And they have great customer service as well.
[02:54:33.316 --> 02:54:39.661]  Let's briefly also tell listeners, you can support the broadcast this way, plus get the word out.
[02:54:39.661 --> 02:54:43.504]  I came up with the design idea, but one of our great Gravix folks put it together, Cade,
[02:54:44.685 --> 02:54:49.690]  I think this is the best t-shirt we've ever put out, and the listeners think that too.
[02:54:49.690 --> 02:54:51.171]  It's the best selling.
[02:54:51.171 --> 02:55:00.600]  Just a week into it, it is the Molon Labe with the Spartan helmet, the crossed M4s behind it, the victory laurels around it.
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:01.941]  We have an M4 Wars version.
[02:55:02.902 --> 02:55:15.653]  With Moen Labbe on the back, InfoWars on the front, in Greek, and the number 1776 under it, and we have the other one that's really the best seller that just says Moen Labbe in the Greek on the front with the Spartan helmet.
[02:55:15.653 --> 02:55:28.885]  So that's all available at InfoWarsStore.com, in the Made in America section, MadeIn1776.com, and it's a great way to meet like-minded people and promote defiance to tyranny, and promote the culture of liberty.
[02:55:28.885 --> 02:55:29.606]  It's a culture war.
[02:55:30.226 --> 02:55:31.407]  As the Globalists have said.
[02:55:31.407 --> 02:55:33.669]  Zach in Morocco, thanks for holding.
[02:55:33.669 --> 02:55:38.572]  I didn't look up and see that you were calling from Morocco, so I apologize I had you hold so long.
[02:55:38.572 --> 02:55:40.133]  Oh, no problem, no problem, Alex.
[02:55:40.133 --> 02:55:43.435]  It's been a very powerful broadcast so far.
[02:55:43.435 --> 02:55:54.823]  I just, I see all this stuff going on in Ukraine and I can't help but draw the parallel to Libya back in 2011, what occurred, with the complete overthrow of that government.
[02:55:54.823 --> 02:55:57.505]  I mean, you know, the big story in the news was Benghazi.
[02:55:58.191 --> 02:56:02.438]  But truly, the big story, I think, is the actual overthrow of that government.
[02:56:02.438 --> 02:56:07.827]  There's no raid on the compound if you don't destabilize the country and murder the leader of a sovereign country.
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:14.504]  And call the Al-Qaeda forces that you've given heavy weapons peaceful demonstrators.
[02:56:14.504 --> 02:56:22.949]  And again, it's not that Qaddafi was wonderful, but compared to he'd been peaceful for decades and been working with the West for eight years, they totally set him up.
[02:56:22.949 --> 02:56:25.190]  And it was a criminal action.
[02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:29.973]  And now, three, four years later, what do we hear about what's happened in Libya?
[02:56:29.973 --> 02:56:34.956]  Well, they admit it's a totally hellhole-level place, and they admit it was terrible what happened.
[02:56:35.805 --> 02:56:47.690]  Absolutely, and at the time, like you said, Muammar Gaddafi was not a saint by any means, but he was building up the country and dealing peacefully with the sub-Saharan Africans, the black population.
[02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:51.372]  The black population in Libya today is absolutely being treated like trash.
[02:56:51.372 --> 02:56:52.773]  Where are all the black leaders?
[02:56:52.773 --> 02:57:01.617]  Where are all these people coming out against the Obama administration when you see he was in charge of this operation in Libya that completely destabilized the country?
[02:57:01.617 --> 02:57:02.377]  Where are the leaders at?
[02:57:02.659 --> 02:57:03.619]  No, I mean, that's what they're doing.
[02:57:03.619 --> 02:57:06.780]  And it doesn't mean there aren't beefs on both sides in any of these conflicts.
[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:12.161]  It just means the globalists, the same ones doing this all over the planet, are the ones behind it.
[02:57:12.161 --> 02:57:16.301]  And now, Benghazi's been fully taken over by Al-Qaeda there.
[02:57:16.301 --> 02:57:19.802]  A bunch of towns fly Al-Qaeda flags over their cities.
[02:57:19.802 --> 02:57:21.142]  It is a nightmare scenario.
[02:57:21.142 --> 02:57:25.063]  Great points from Morocco, out there in the Mediterranean.
[02:57:25.063 --> 02:57:27.083]  Let's talk to Tom in New York.
[02:57:27.083 --> 02:57:27.723]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:27.723 --> 02:57:29.364]  Go ahead.
[02:57:29.364 --> 02:57:30.404]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:57:30.404 --> 02:57:31.104]  I'm doing alright, brother.
[02:57:32.219 --> 02:57:32.819]  Ah, good, good.
[02:57:32.819 --> 02:57:36.281]  Okay, I got two things I'd like to, uh, if I have time here.
[02:57:36.281 --> 02:57:47.066]  Um, I'd like to get your view on, uh, I don't know if you saw it in the news, Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, wants to give prisoners a free college education.
[02:57:47.066 --> 02:57:53.449]  Well, of course, I mean, he's a criminal who wants to violate the Second Amendment and the First Amendment and says good, pro-life people should leave the state.
[02:57:53.449 --> 02:57:54.850]  Cuomo is a thug pig.
[02:57:56.198 --> 02:57:57.158]  I used to be impeached.
[02:57:57.158 --> 02:57:58.059]  He's the worst governor.
[02:57:58.059 --> 02:58:02.580]  I can't believe that nobody's up in arms about him wanting to take our guns, number one.
[02:58:02.580 --> 02:58:05.861]  And number two, giving college educations to criminals.
[02:58:05.861 --> 02:58:15.625]  Look, he is a criminal for working with mayors from Bloomberg's group in a conspiracy to register guns to confiscate them.
[02:58:15.625 --> 02:58:18.726]  It is criminal to try to disarm us and overthrow our Bill of Rights.
[02:58:18.726 --> 02:58:19.466]  It is criminal!
[02:58:20.126 --> 02:58:23.027]  To tell people that don't agree with him politically to get out of his state.
[02:58:23.027 --> 02:58:26.709]  He is a disgusting, gangster, thug, piece of trash.
[02:58:26.709 --> 02:58:27.810]  God bless you, sir.
[02:58:27.810 --> 02:58:28.270]  Anything else?
[02:58:28.270 --> 02:58:29.551]  Thank you.
[02:58:29.551 --> 02:58:31.732]  No, I had another point, but I'll call back.
[02:58:31.732 --> 02:58:33.273]  No, I'm going into overdrive.
[02:58:33.273 --> 02:58:34.793]  So come back, make your final point, Tom.
[02:58:34.793 --> 02:58:35.894]  Five minutes overdrive.
[02:58:35.894 --> 02:58:38.195]  Then Jill, Lee, and Fred, I'm going to go to all of you.
[02:58:38.195 --> 02:58:38.655]  All of you.
[02:58:38.655 --> 02:58:39.716]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:39.716 --> 02:58:42.277]  Porn slash show for the free feed.
[02:58:42.277 --> 02:58:43.518]  Nightly News tonight at 7.
[02:58:43.518 --> 02:58:45.659]  God bless you all, folks.
[02:58:45.659 --> 02:58:47.160]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.331 --> 02:58:52.352]  The facts are in.
[02:58:52.352 --> 02:58:53.772]  The studies are legion.
[02:58:53.772 --> 02:59:01.276]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:59:01.276 --> 02:59:05.098]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:59:05.098 --> 02:59:05.679]  Simple.
[02:59:05.679 --> 02:59:10.401]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:59:10.401 --> 02:59:15.844]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:59:16.104 --> 02:59:21.651]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[02:59:21.651 --> 02:59:32.123]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:59:32.443 --> 02:59:37.005]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:59:37.005 --> 02:59:39.165]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[02:59:39.165 --> 02:59:44.727]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:59:44.727 --> 02:59:49.129]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:59:49.129 --> 02:59:52.350]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:52.350 --> 02:59:53.871]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.871 --> 02:59:55.931]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.931 --> 02:59:59.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.294 --> 03:00:07.596]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.596 --> 03:00:09.377]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:09.377 --> 03:00:11.119]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.119 --> 03:00:12.701]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:13.622]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.622 --> 03:00:18.448]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.448 --> 03:00:22.692]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.692 --> 03:00:23.533]  We're in overdrive.
[03:00:23.533 --> 03:00:24.975]  Tom at one more point from New York.
[03:00:24.975 --> 03:00:25.476]  Go ahead, brother.
[03:00:26.383 --> 03:00:33.070]  Yeah, this is a different subject, but, um, yeah, back, uh, I know you listen to a lot of heavy metal, already have it in your intros and stuff like that.
[03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:47.965]  My question is, is back in the 80s, like, when, uh, Chipper Gore and all her little goonie friends were trying to create the Parents Room Rating Music Commission, do you think they were actually demonizing heavy metal because it was a political statement, and they were trying to wake people up about the repression that was going on?
[03:00:48.752 --> 03:00:59.883]  Well, yeah, they wanted to ignore all the real bad stuff going on in the media and act like they were doing something good, putting parental labeling on things that only, in most cases, increase the sales ten times.
[03:00:59.883 --> 03:01:05.588]  But, again, most of the stuff I like, I mean, if you look at something like Megadeth, it's not satanic, it's anti-tyranny.
[03:01:06.269 --> 03:01:09.372]  Or if you look at something like Billy Corrigan, you know, it's kind of a media thing.
[03:01:09.372 --> 03:01:13.675]  There is obviously satanic music out there all over the place and we criticize it.
[03:01:13.675 --> 03:01:16.177]  I just play a lot of it because I like it and it's high energy.
[03:01:16.177 --> 03:01:18.419]  And that's why Michael Savage plays it.
[03:01:18.419 --> 03:01:19.640]  So it really comes down to that.
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:20.921]  Thank you, Tom.
[03:01:20.921 --> 03:01:28.847]  But yeah, the Tipper Gore stuff, that was all just grandstanding to manipulate the social right to vote Democrat by Tipper Gore.
[03:01:28.847 --> 03:01:31.209]  Let's talk to Jill in California.
[03:01:31.209 --> 03:01:32.009]  You're on the air.
[03:01:32.009 --> 03:01:32.370]  Go ahead.
[03:01:34.119 --> 03:01:35.680]  Oh, hi Alex.
[03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:46.429]  I'm just floored by that Dr. Rocky's testimony about all that, the radiation and his experience.
[03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:47.770]  It's just awful.
[03:01:47.770 --> 03:01:52.634]  I was going to talk about the Second Amendment, but that just really got to me.
[03:01:52.634 --> 03:01:56.077]  And the thing is, it's just ongoing.
[03:01:56.077 --> 03:01:59.119]  And it's like, what's wrong with the establishment?
[03:01:59.119 --> 03:02:02.182]  It's not just like they don't care stuff's leaking and having problems.
[03:02:02.182 --> 03:02:03.463]  They're expanding it all.
[03:02:05.768 --> 03:02:10.031]  Yeah, and I don't know if you know of Ken Rolla.
[03:02:10.031 --> 03:02:13.554]  He's an engineer and a health expert.
[03:02:13.554 --> 03:02:16.576]  He specializes in radiation mitigation.
[03:02:16.576 --> 03:02:18.977]  No, I haven't heard of him.
[03:02:18.977 --> 03:02:20.799]  Well, you can Google him.
[03:02:20.799 --> 03:02:22.320]  His last name's Rolla.
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:22.940]  R-O-L-L-A.
[03:02:22.940 --> 03:02:23.981]  Okay, well what's he saying?
[03:02:25.759 --> 03:02:36.230]  Well, he instructs people how to build their own devices and how to do soil mitigation when you're growing your garden.
[03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:37.751]  You can structure your water.
[03:02:37.751 --> 03:02:39.533]  You can structure your soil.
[03:02:39.533 --> 03:02:40.434]  Interesting.
[03:02:40.434 --> 03:02:41.995]  I'll look into it, Jill.
[03:02:41.995 --> 03:02:43.457]  I'm going to jump to the next person.
[03:02:43.457 --> 03:02:44.318]  Thank you.
[03:02:44.318 --> 03:02:45.238]  Lee in Iowa.
[03:02:45.238 --> 03:02:46.039]  Lee, you're on the air.
[03:02:46.039 --> 03:02:46.400]  Go ahead.
[03:02:47.816 --> 03:02:49.297]  Hello.
[03:02:49.297 --> 03:02:52.099]  I'd love to talk about the situation in Ukraine.
[03:02:52.099 --> 03:02:52.379]  Go ahead.
[03:02:52.379 --> 03:02:53.519]  You're on air.
[03:02:53.519 --> 03:02:59.303]  I concur with the caller earlier that had spoken to several people in Ukraine.
[03:02:59.303 --> 03:03:02.585]  My wife is Ukrainian, actually, from Kiev.
[03:03:02.585 --> 03:03:04.686]  Lucky man.
[03:03:04.686 --> 03:03:08.068]  And, oh yeah, she's something.
[03:03:08.068 --> 03:03:12.391]  The people there are just wonderful, and I can tell you... Yeah, it's not just they're good-looking women.
[03:03:12.391 --> 03:03:15.173]  I hear they're just really real women.
[03:03:15.173 --> 03:03:16.533]  Oh, very, very much feminine.
[03:03:17.884 --> 03:03:28.351]  But I can tell you at this point, no matter how this revolution started, I can tell you that people who live there are very much for liberty in Ukraine.
[03:03:28.351 --> 03:03:31.473]  They know Russia is sticking its fingers into this.
[03:03:31.473 --> 03:03:34.715]  Oh, there's no doubt Russia and the West are doing it.
[03:03:34.715 --> 03:03:35.235]  And the West.
[03:03:35.825 --> 03:03:41.687]  But I think at this point, the average man is completely fed up with the Ukrainian government.
[03:03:41.687 --> 03:03:43.487]  The corruption there runs very deep.
[03:03:43.487 --> 03:03:45.968]  It carries over from the Soviet era.
[03:03:45.968 --> 03:03:49.709]  You know, if you want anything done, you got to pay a bureaucrat to do something.
[03:03:49.709 --> 03:03:55.711]  And the deputies and the ministers, you know, they live very good lives because they get all the money skimmed off.
[03:03:55.711 --> 03:04:02.332]  And I just, at this point, I don't see a peaceful end to it.
[03:04:02.332 --> 03:04:04.393]  Yanukovych and his party, they know
[03:04:05.023 --> 03:04:11.127]  If they give up, they're either going to prison or they're going to be executed, I think.
[03:04:11.127 --> 03:04:12.628]  And so all hell's going to break loose.
[03:04:12.628 --> 03:04:13.529]  Appreciate your call.
[03:04:13.529 --> 03:04:14.589]  Great points.
[03:04:14.589 --> 03:04:17.211]  I'm sorry to Fred, Dave, and Paul.
[03:04:17.211 --> 03:04:20.233]  Call me back tomorrow, Paul, Dave, and Fred, if you can get in.
[03:04:20.233 --> 03:04:20.994]  Put you at the head of the line.
[03:04:20.994 --> 03:04:22.334]  In fact, you can get their numbers if you want, John.
[03:04:22.334 --> 03:04:23.815]  I'll have them on tomorrow.
[03:04:23.815 --> 03:04:26.097]  Lord willing, we'll be back tomorrow with a Friday transmission.
[03:04:26.097 --> 03:04:27.358]  Please pray for this broadcast.
[03:04:27.978 --> 03:04:29.559]  A lot of good things are happening around here.
[03:04:29.559 --> 03:04:34.642]  A lot of bad things are happening in my life as well that I don't get into on air and I appreciate everybody's support.
[03:04:34.642 --> 03:04:39.825]  Helps us continue through all the things that are happening and going on and nobody said life was easy.
[03:04:39.825 --> 03:04:41.666]  It's a great animating challenge though.
[03:04:42.995 --> 03:04:48.377]  When we all live these short lives that are just a burst of energy and a race to the end and then the next generation.
[03:04:48.377 --> 03:04:50.618]  When you really think about it, that is humanity.
[03:04:50.618 --> 03:04:56.181]  It's that long arc, that trajectory, and I just don't want us to fail and blow the planet up.
[03:04:56.181 --> 03:04:57.622]  I want to succeed.
[03:04:57.622 --> 03:05:00.003]  I realize I'm my ancestors and my progeny are me.
