[00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:10.884]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:12.466]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.008]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:18.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:22.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:41.953]  Well, the cover-up of just how serious the Ebola crisis is is accelerating right now on this Thursday, 16th day of October, 2014 transmission.
[00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:44.174]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:50.976]  They are telling 911 dispatchers Fox Television out of D.C.
[00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:59.500]  is reporting not to say Ebola over the radio or when they're basically talking about a call that they're on.
[00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:09.458]  We have Obama saying there's nothing to fear, that it's a low probability that an epidemic will start in the U.S.
[00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:29.543]  Even as we learn that the second nurse to contract Ebola traveled all over the place on aircraft, and that the plane was not even cleaned, that is wiped down, they picked up the trash on the floor, but not a deep clean, for five more flights after she was on it.
[00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:30.243]  Five more flights.
[00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:45.646]  Meanwhile, Central and South American countries have announced today that they are going to cease flights from West Africa into their countries, months after Europe did this and the Middle East did it.
[00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:47.867]  And still, the U.S.
[00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:55.049]  is not just allowing the flights in, but issuing visas to whoever wants them to come.
[00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749]  Rubber stamping them.
[00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:11.223]  So we have more countries issuing travel bans on Ebola-stricken nations like Colombia and different Caribbean islands like St.
[00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:11.703]  Luke.
[00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:13.783]  Did I pronounce that?
[00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:14.063]  St.
[00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:15.804]  Lucia?
[00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:20.125]  But not the United States.
[00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:25.065]  We are the Ebola vomit bag.
[00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:28.086]  The Obama, excuse me, Ebola toilet.
[00:02:29.073 --> 00:02:33.054]  You know, memes are very, very powerful.
[00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:37.856]  And that's why we've launched this contest that's only running for another week.
[00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:51.119]  So go to infowars.com forward slash contest, print off the flyers, hang them up, shoot video of it, send us the video, we'll post it, and then a week later on Halloween, I will announce the winner.
[00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.720]  Hashtag Ebola contest.
[00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:56.667]  And they say it's racist to tie Obama to Ebola.
[00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:02.670]  Well, no, we're going to tie collectivism to the disease and the fact the government's helping push it.
[00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.512]  That's the whole point of this contest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:07.273]  So get out there and don't wait.
[00:03:07.273 --> 00:03:08.974]  Shoot the videos now.
[00:03:08.974 --> 00:03:12.096]  And everybody wins by getting the word out.
[00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:15.698]  There's obviously a global stock market plunge going on.
[00:03:15.698 --> 00:03:16.458]  The U.S.
[00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:18.620]  stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
[00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:29.346]  The show TV viewers, a document cam shot of this, has lost its last six months gains just since October began.
[00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:38.315]  Now the Plunge Protection Team, or the President's Committee on Open Markets, set up after the 87 crash, could have pumped this up anytime they wanted to.
[00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:49.427]  And clearly what they're doing is testing the population to see what they'll do if they allow it to continue to drop.
[00:03:49.427 --> 00:04:01.931]  But something that Max Keiser and many others predicted would happen this year is now happening, is now taking place.
[00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.112]  And that is a run on treasuries
[00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:10.759]  Bulls run for the exit.
[00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.902]  Rising concerns about the global economy triggered a flash crash in U.S.
[00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:24.789]  Treasury yields yesterday as losses spread across stock markets and a new wave of investors appeared to give up on their bullish bets.
[00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:37.058]  You know, I was downtown yesterday and saw a lot of depressed yuppies looking at their smartphones and talking to each other and saying, gee, I wish I knew how to run these put options better, or gee, I wish I knew how to make it short better.
[00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:44.257]  It's all shaking their heads and I looked at two different groups of businessmen and I said, don't you understand it's all rigged?
[00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:46.539]  You need to work for Goldman Sachs.
[00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.242]  Don't, don't ever go the direction.
[00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:58.030]  Anytime that it's going to new highs, you know, they're going to plunge it to reel in all the little fish, bring in the nets, but you like being preyed upon.
[00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.651]  You can't help it.
[00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:03.556]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:11.780]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.203]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:19.724]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:21.825]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:05:30.134 --> 00:05:33.795]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:38.057]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:39.857]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:39.857 --> 00:05:47.700]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.840]  But for how long?
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.482]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:58.303]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.062]  The experts are clear.
[00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:08.168]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:14.454]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:18.037]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:06:18.157 --> 00:06:22.379]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:27.701]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:28.702]  Not our iodine.
[00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:32.523]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:35.064]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:37.085]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:38.686]  See the informational videos.
[00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.627]  Read the information there compiled.

[00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.371]  We're good.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:09.908]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:19.615]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:30.202]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[00:07:30.202 --> 00:07:34.865]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.087]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[00:07:37.287 --> 00:07:39.850]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:45.515]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:50.860]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.365]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder.

[00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:22.839]  I want to tell you about Texas Radio and the Big B. Comes out of the Virginia swamps, cool and slow, with plenty of precision.
[00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:27.662]  And a backbeat narrow and hard to master.
[00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:33.165]  Some call it heavenly and its brilliance, others mean and root for the western dream.
[00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:44.971]  If you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you are the resistance.
[00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:49.513]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:49.513 --> 00:08:52.235]  One last breath before wind blows.
[00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:54.917]  Better raise your ears.
[00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:56.838]  Sound of hooves knock at your door.
[00:09:03.936 --> 00:09:06.577]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:11.899]  It's time to wield the blade.
[00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:13.859]  All the talk will soon be over.
[00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:17.220]  It'll be time to test everybody's mettle.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.522]  And they come to take your life!
[00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:24.082]  Honor the dead of night.
[00:09:24.082 --> 00:09:27.643]  To see the full horsemen ride!
[00:09:27.643 --> 00:09:31.585]  So choose your fate!
[00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:32.165]  Oh yes!
[00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:46.173]  Well, I choose not to live on my knees as a slave to the globalists, and I defiantly resist their attack on free will and liberty worldwide.
[00:09:46.173 --> 00:09:52.557]  Well, here we are on this live Thursday worldwide transmission.
[00:09:52.557 --> 00:09:53.077]  The 16th day.
[00:09:53.077 --> 00:10:03.204]  We have just absolutely over-the-top important news on the Ebola front, on the economic front, on the Second Amendment front.
[00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:22.199]  on the police state front with Houston literally trying to intimidate churches into not giving sermons that criticize transsexual behavior or homosexuality and a lot of libertarian groups have been coming out and even though they are
[00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:26.420]  open to other lifestyles as a libertarians.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:38.790]  They are defending these preachers because if you're going to have your right to live the way you want, somebody else has to have their right to live and speak as they see fit.
[00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:46.796]  Flaming authoritarianism, pun intended, out of the Houston mayor and the rest of them.
[00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:47.717]  Suing churches
[00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:53.003]  This is what Europe and Canada are doing.
[00:10:53.003 --> 00:10:54.124]  This is the model.
[00:10:54.124 --> 00:10:58.284]  Everything you see with political correctness out of Europe and Canada is coming here.
[00:10:58.284 --> 00:11:02.665]  They arrest preachers that criticize homosexuality.
[00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:20.049]  And to control language, in England they arrested Robin Page, who wasn't even a critic of the, you know, gay lobby, a decade ago, when he gave a speech saying rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals, and they said that the scientific term homosexual
[00:11:21.732 --> 00:11:23.953]  Like heterosexual.
[00:11:23.953 --> 00:11:32.495]  Was hurtful and homophobic and so he was arrested as an example to everyone.
[00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:35.376]  That's England!
[00:11:35.376 --> 00:11:41.998]  That's like if I say Caucasians have light skin and they came and arrested me.
[00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:45.860]  Caucasian is a scientific word.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.561]  There is a war against science, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.379]  There is a war against free speech.
[00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.900]  I don't like the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.261]  I've protested them more than a dozen times.
[00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:00.621]  The videos are on YouTube.
[00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:12.264]  And I would go to the protests and point out that they were really feds, and a lot of times it would turn out they were feds, and they would really shingle me out to death threat me and attack me, and the police generally would do nothing in Waco and other areas.
[00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.885]  But I would never call to have their speech taken.
[00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:23.097]  And by the way, when I go protest the Klan or other Mecha, La Raza, Hispanic Klan groups, they would always say, how dare you try to stop my free speech?
[00:12:23.097 --> 00:12:24.818]  No, no, no, no.
[00:12:24.818 --> 00:12:29.021]  Free speech means you can say what you want, I can say what I want right back.
[00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.122]  You understand how that works?
[00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:31.743]  It's a two-way street.
[00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:34.625]  But see, the left does what Mecha and La Raza and the Klan
[00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:45.078]  And the new Black Panther Party and others will do, when you try to go counter-demonstrate against them, they'll get in your face saying, stop trying to stop my speech, while they're trying to stop yours.
[00:12:45.078 --> 00:12:46.459]  That's what the left does.
[00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:52.001]  They say, you can't have your speech and say you're against abortion.
[00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:54.462]  We're going to have the IRS come after you.
[00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:57.163]  You can't say you think homosexuality is a sin.
[00:12:59.209 --> 00:13:01.451]  Because it's your interpretation of the Bible.
[00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:03.613]  I'm gonna try to have you arrested.
[00:13:03.613 --> 00:13:04.814]  Whoa!
[00:13:04.814 --> 00:13:05.514]  Whoa!
[00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:09.337]  That is over-the-top totalitarianism.
[00:13:09.337 --> 00:13:20.927]  And as soon as it got a lot of coverage in the news the last few days, bully pulpit, Houston subpoenas, pastors and sermons, then backs off amidst outcry.
[00:13:20.927 --> 00:13:25.491]  I mean, this mayor is another crazy
[00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.983]  Anise Parker, leftist control freak.
[00:13:30.983 --> 00:13:33.524]  I mean, if you're watching on TV, you can see her.
[00:13:33.524 --> 00:13:35.885]  What a dangerous person.
[00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:48.151]  In America, we're going to subpoena and sue with taxpayer money preachers to intimidate them not to read out of the Bible.
[00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:52.634]  And notice with political correctness, they only target Christians.
[00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:55.175]  You know, all these other mosques,
[00:13:56.778 --> 00:14:03.960]  And even some of the Eastern religions are against homosexuality.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.420]  Nobody's telling them to shut up.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.261]  It's always Christianity that's supposed to shut up.
[00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:12.142]  And you know, there's other examples of killing free speech.
[00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:14.262]  I'm going to talk about this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:14.262 --> 00:14:19.364]  I went and saw Kill the Messenger last night, and I expected it to be a whitewash.
[00:14:19.364 --> 00:14:23.064]  I expected it to, you know, imply that he killed himself.
[00:14:23.064 --> 00:14:24.445]  And it was absolute truth.
[00:14:25.492 --> 00:14:28.654]  Because I remember Gary Webb being on the show more than 10 times.
[00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:32.477]  I had all these incredible conversations with Gary Webb off air.
[00:14:32.477 --> 00:14:34.519]  He wanted me to build a website for him.
[00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:39.302]  He sent me all these documents that the CIA had broken in his house a bunch to try to get.
[00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:46.468]  I was too busy making films and making babies with my wife.
[00:14:47.617 --> 00:14:50.959]  I remember he called back, the last time I talked to him, a few months before he committed suicide.
[00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:54.341]  And he said, hey man, Alex, I thought you had the courage to put this up and do something.
[00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:59.143]  And I said, yeah, there's thousands of pages of this stuff and a lot of this is court records and stuff.
[00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:00.604]  And I go, I guess I'll put it out.
[00:15:00.604 --> 00:15:03.246]  But he goes, well, I thought you got balls.
[00:15:03.246 --> 00:15:05.807]  I mean, these are epic conversations I had with Gary Webb.
[00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:07.928]  Now a hit movie out about him.
[00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:10.630]  And it was so surreal to be sitting there in the movie theater.
[00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:26.465]  And knowing his whole story, and it was so accurate, and then they basically imply that the CIA kills him at the end, and they show the CIA threatening his kids, and breaking his house, and breaking his car, and steal his motorcycle.
[00:15:26.465 --> 00:15:28.706]  And it was just, I know the story so well.
[00:15:28.706 --> 00:15:33.350]  I know Freeway Ricky Ross, I was the only person ever interviewing him in prison.
[00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.252]  Kevin Booth got that interview from prison.
[00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:51.307]  I mean I had the guy on death row on from Oklahoma from from Terre Haute who was there and and and and saw McVeigh admit what was later partially declassified that he was black ops army super special forces set up.
[00:15:51.307 --> 00:15:55.531]  I just I'm not even here bragging oh my gosh this show's important.
[00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:57.092]  I felt incredibly guilty.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.802]  That I don't even know where that disc is.
[00:16:04.802 --> 00:16:06.523]  That CD-ROM.
[00:16:06.523 --> 00:16:12.067]  That I opened up, and it was just... I don't even know how to process all this stuff.
[00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:16.431]  I need to tear apart our storage buildings and find that.
[00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:21.734]  And then I don't even want to talk about how I had that disc, because they were, like, killing people over this stuff.
[00:16:21.734 --> 00:16:24.096]  And then I went and searched last night when I got home.
[00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:29.000]  I went to bed, then I woke up in the middle of the night and went and searched for, like, an hour at 3 AM, 4 AM.
[00:16:31.653 --> 00:16:36.016]  And I couldn't even find one interview I did with Gary Webb.
[00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:38.899]  It's kind of like I did a couple interviews, two interviews with Charlton Heston.
[00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:39.759]  I can only find one.
[00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:46.645]  There were probably 15 interviews with Gary Webb.
[00:16:46.645 --> 00:16:49.087]  Two hour interviews, some of them.
[00:16:49.087 --> 00:16:54.411]  And this was back when they had demonized him in the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:56.893]  And when they had just torn him apart.
[00:16:56.893 --> 00:16:58.654]  Of course, it all turned out everything he said was true.
[00:16:58.654 --> 00:16:59.435]  It was very accurate.
[00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:07.299]  He was just pointing out what was already known and even been in congressional hearings years before on Southeast Asian drug dealing.
[00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:19.226]  Heroin, not cocaine, not white girl, as they call it.
[00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:28.172]  And I was just thinking about how bizarre it is that I talked to him a couple months before he died
[00:17:29.677 --> 00:17:38.084]  And I was remembering back my last conversation with him, is he got mad at me and slammed the phone down.
[00:17:38.084 --> 00:17:40.887]  And he was just somebody looking for help.
[00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:43.349]  Because he resigned from the San Jose Mercury News.
[00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:46.432]  He was trying to get his stories out on the internet.
[00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.694]  They were breaking into his house a bunch, so he moved again.
[00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:54.599]  He'd pull up and guys would slide down from the second story, you know, down the drainage pipe.
[00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.820]  Then he moved into a one-story house.
[00:17:56.783 --> 00:18:08.106]  And then they'd have known CIA people write articles about me right after he died, saying, Jones claims that men slid down the drainage pipe, but Webb lived in a one-story.
[00:18:08.106 --> 00:18:09.326]  Well, yeah, he just moved into it.
[00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:11.187]  It was just all these games.
[00:18:11.187 --> 00:18:23.070]  And then watching how they demonized him and how they tried to kill his name before they physically killed him, and experiencing a lot of this myself, it was a surreal
[00:18:25.034 --> 00:18:41.427]  I've never gone and seen a movie where, from what I know, it was so incredibly accurate and so incredibly sad, and then I resonated with it, because they always make it about the individual.
[00:18:41.427 --> 00:18:45.730]  If they can't disprove your facts, they just demonize and destroy the individual themselves.
[00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:57.063]  And I got a sick feeling in my stomach as I realized that the clocks just tick until they come and shoot me in the head twice or plant drugs on me or shoot me at a checkpoint or something.
[00:18:57.063 --> 00:19:01.706]  And it just, it made me sad to watch all the cowards, his editors and his, uh,
[00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:24.200]  Bosses at the San Jose Mercury News, that when it was all the big story, they were telling him what a rock star he was, but then as soon as the system turned against him, how the editor of the LA Times was former CIA, and they set about to destroy him, and the CIA declassified three weeks ago, on the eve of this film coming out, that they indeed set out to destroy Gary Webb.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.142]  I said I'd cover it at the bottom of the hour, I'm already doing it.
[00:19:27.142 --> 00:19:30.124]  Who wrote the Dark Alliance story about CIA drug trafficking.
[00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:41.435]  Here's the headline, managing a nightmare, how the CIA watched over the destruction of Gary Webb.
[00:19:41.435 --> 00:19:45.197]  It's just so pathetic.
[00:19:45.197 --> 00:19:48.118]  And then why would the CIA admit they did this right when the movie came out?
[00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:49.659]  Because they want everybody to know.
[00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:58.063]  They want to just literally urinate on the corpse of our republic and scare the media and the press right as the CIA rolls out domestically.
[00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.044]  Ugh.
[00:20:00.057 --> 00:20:04.160]  You've forgotten to monitor BlocketPocket.com, haven't you?
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.801]  Oh, how quickly we forget.

[00:20:29.876 --> 00:20:32.958]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.760]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.242]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:20:37.242 --> 00:20:38.823]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:20:38.823 --> 00:20:40.784]  If passed, H.R.
[00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:43.206]  5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.

[00:20:57.857 --> 00:20:58.718]  Come and take it.
[00:20:59.238 --> 00:21:00.518]  Another major health threat.
[00:21:00.518 --> 00:21:05.479]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:08.120]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:15.202]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:15.202 --> 00:21:18.162]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:18.162 --> 00:21:21.143]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:21.143 --> 00:21:23.163]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:23.163 --> 00:21:26.024]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:31.808]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:31.808 --> 00:21:35.311]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:21:35.311 --> 00:21:38.393]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:21:59.978 --> 00:22:02.259]  Mike Stenerson for Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:05.601]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:08.322]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[00:22:08.322 --> 00:22:12.284]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:22:12.284 --> 00:22:16.025]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:22:16.025 --> 00:22:17.446]  Ours is not immune.
[00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:19.107]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:22:19.107 --> 00:22:19.687]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:22:24.429 --> 00:22:27.131]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:31.634]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[00:22:31.634 --> 00:22:32.735]  So decide.
[00:22:32.735 --> 00:22:36.057]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:22:36.057 --> 00:22:37.378]  The choice is yours.

[00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:39.899]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:41.300]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:41.621]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[00:22:54.653 --> 00:22:55.219]  Extension 116.
[00:22:58.388 --> 00:23:03.052]  On September 30, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[00:23:03.052 --> 00:23:15.403]  This, combined with several other unidentified viruses, have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[00:23:15.403 --> 00:23:25.332]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell
[00:23:25.692 --> 00:23:31.496]  Our 30-day non-GMO emergency food supply for only $99 as long as we can.

[00:23:55.591 --> 00:24:10.919]  5-4-1-2-2-9-0-0-10 We have massive global stock market and bond market news, over-the-top important Ebola news.
[00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:23.466]  Max Keiser is coming on the first 30 minutes of the third hour to break down the bond market implosion that he predicted would happen by the middle of this year, so I guess he's a little bit late on that, but
[00:24:24.855 --> 00:24:26.136]  Still accurate.
[00:24:26.136 --> 00:24:33.639]  We're going to get Harry Dent on next week, who's been predicting it'll be depressionary, not inflationary.
[00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:42.142]  And it does appear that the collapse is depressionary overall, with a bizarre icing of inflationary on top of it.
[00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:46.404]  That's not supposed to be able to happen in real economics, but things are so rigged.
[00:24:46.404 --> 00:24:48.665]  Bulls run for the exit on U.S.
[00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:50.025]  Treasuries.
[00:24:50.025 --> 00:24:50.866]  Italy and France
[00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:57.531]  Make plea for growth as EU-Asia leaders meet.
[00:24:57.531 --> 00:25:02.672]  Gold is up today on global slowdown concerns.
[00:25:02.672 --> 00:25:06.193]  Crude oil is plunging below $80 a barrel.
[00:25:06.193 --> 00:25:10.675]  Refineries have been restricted as a bottleneck, so don't expect prices to fall too much.
[00:25:12.366 --> 00:25:15.508]  This is the type of over-the-top information.
[00:25:15.508 --> 00:25:32.582]  I intended to not even talk about Kill the Messenger today, but it was so profound last night watching this movie, and so personal, and so surreal, because I was remembering, man, I really knew this guy well.
[00:25:32.582 --> 00:25:34.103]  He wanted to work with me.
[00:25:34.103 --> 00:25:39.327]  He wanted to, he had his new book coming out that was going to be basically self-published.
[00:25:40.552 --> 00:25:44.535]  Exposing the full scope of CIA drug dealing, and they killed him!
[00:25:44.535 --> 00:26:03.769]  And he told me he was being threatened, and he told Ricky Ross, who's on next Tuesday, the big CIA crack dealer, biggest in West Coast history, that guys were breaking in and they were gonna kill him, right before they killed him!
[00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:09.093]  It's just so unbelievably bizarre that it even came out in Congress
[00:26:10.373 --> 00:26:24.524]  In the late 90s, with a solicitor inspector general, that they were shipping most of the cocaine in, but then they knew the public was so dumbed down, they would go on national television and say, Gary Webb has been discredited.
[00:26:24.524 --> 00:26:34.972]  The drug kingpin in the Central American prison says that he never met with him.
[00:26:34.972 --> 00:26:40.056]  And then to imagine the LA Times editor, who was CIA on record, the movie even points that out,
[00:26:42.641 --> 00:26:59.614]  I just hope everybody involved in this knows that when they set him down and said, we're going to kill your family if you don't write this suicide note, and then shot him twice in the head, that all of you are accomplices to that.
[00:26:59.614 --> 00:27:04.077]  And they say one man dies as a tragedy, 10,000 dies as a statistic, as Joseph Stalin said.
[00:27:04.077 --> 00:27:05.158]  It's true.
[00:27:05.158 --> 00:27:11.063]  But when you destroy a real journalist and someone who has integrity and courage and who swims against the tide,
[00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:27.952]  You then kill the courage of thousands of other journalists and other individuals and whistleblowers and just allow incredible evil to grow.
[00:27:27.952 --> 00:27:30.794]  And I wouldn't call the film a whitewash.
[00:27:30.794 --> 00:27:36.160]  They've got some of the courtroom scenes where they actually threatened to kill Gary Webb out in the hallway repeatedly.
[00:27:39.782 --> 00:27:44.723]  And it has a scene where the Feds break in his house, break in his car, but this happened on a routine basis.
[00:27:44.723 --> 00:27:49.604]  And the CIA wanted to meet with him, so he goes to their offices and they say, we just want you to know your children are safe.
[00:27:49.604 --> 00:27:53.405]  I remember Gary Webb telling that story here on air.
[00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:58.827]  And the fact that he blew up at him and said, I'm going to publish that story no matter what you do, that's real courage.
[00:27:58.827 --> 00:28:00.287]  People say, oh, well, I'd do that.
[00:28:00.287 --> 00:28:00.947]  Really?
[00:28:00.947 --> 00:28:08.049]  I haven't found a lot of people that when they say, we're going to kill your kids, and I've had them actually tell me, we're going to kill your kids.
[00:28:08.996 --> 00:28:11.037]  If you don't stop, and I haven't stopped.
[00:28:11.037 --> 00:28:11.657]  And you know why?
[00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:17.079]  Because my kids don't have a future if we don't stop this.
[00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:32.706]  The allegory, and your children don't either, is that we're in a ship that's capsized, and if we don't swim the 50 yards through the submerged area, even though it's scary and dark, and try to get out, we're all going to drown because it's slowly sinking.
[00:28:32.706 --> 00:28:34.186]  And a lot of true stories with this happen.
[00:28:34.186 --> 00:28:35.787]  Let's say we had oxygen tanks in there.
[00:28:36.892 --> 00:28:42.376]  I'm not going to put oxygen tanks on and just sit there and say, well, I get to live an hour longer than everybody else.
[00:28:42.376 --> 00:28:47.399]  If I had oxygen tanks, I'd try to swim out even faster than I would if I didn't have oxygen tanks.
[00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:51.347]  But see, people just say, well, the tyranny's rising.
[00:28:51.347 --> 00:28:53.807]  I'm going to put an oxygen tank in my mouth.
[00:28:53.807 --> 00:28:56.168]  I'm going to put a regulator in my mouth.
[00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:57.148]  A mouthpiece in.
[00:28:57.148 --> 00:29:01.089]  And I'm just going to try to be, you know, the last person standing when this all happens.
[00:29:01.089 --> 00:29:03.090]  I'm going to go along and try to survive.
[00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.951]  No, you'll just be dead in the capsized, tyrannical ship of state as well.
[00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:10.172]  This country is falling apart.
[00:29:10.172 --> 00:29:12.413]  It is just totally disintegrating.
[00:29:12.413 --> 00:29:13.573]  Corruption is everywhere.
[00:29:15.268 --> 00:29:20.333]  Under the Obama tax laws, they've gotten rid of all the major write-offs, all the major business incentives.
[00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:22.655]  Businesses are shutting down everywhere.
[00:29:22.655 --> 00:29:26.678]  It's in the news today that it's the highest federal receipts they've ever had.
[00:29:26.678 --> 00:29:29.581]  They are destroying the country on purpose.
[00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:31.383]  They are wrecking it and looting it.
[00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.392]  And I'm done talking about Gary Webb.
[00:29:34.392 --> 00:29:40.438]  I'm going to shoot a special report for The Nightly News tonight or tomorrow, because I really want to do this justice, and write some notes and really talk about it.
[00:29:40.438 --> 00:29:43.681]  And I want to get my crew to find... Send us the links, listeners.
[00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:45.483]  Go out and search the web.
[00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:47.265]  Old podcasts, you name us.
[00:29:47.265 --> 00:29:48.946]  Send me the Gary Webb interviews I did.
[00:29:48.946 --> 00:29:56.674]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:29:59.608 --> 00:30:00.929]  The experts are clear.
[00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:08.053]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:30:08.053 --> 00:30:14.316]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:30:14.316 --> 00:30:17.918]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:30:18.038 --> 00:30:22.259]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:27.581]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:28.581]  Not our iodine.
[00:30:28.581 --> 00:30:32.402]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:30:32.402 --> 00:30:34.943]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:30:59.301 --> 00:31:06.465]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:08.807]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:31:08.807 --> 00:31:14.090]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:19.253]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:22.295]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:31:22.575 --> 00:31:26.638]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:31:26.638 --> 00:31:30.980]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:41.206]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:31:41.206 --> 00:31:43.708]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:31:43.908 --> 00:31:52.114]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:31:52.114 --> 00:31:56.076]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.409 --> 00:32:05.555]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:08.837]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:32:08.837 --> 00:32:10.619]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:32:10.619 --> 00:32:16.985]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:16.985 --> 00:32:22.870]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.972]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:32:26.972 --> 00:32:29.874]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:32:29.874 --> 00:32:38.339]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:40.440]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.461]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:50.784]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:32:50.784 --> 00:32:53.445]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:32:53.445 --> 00:32:57.726]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:33:09.352 --> 00:33:11.933]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:11.933 --> 00:33:15.014]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:17.675]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.675 --> 00:33:22.216]  Chaos is hanging around.
[00:33:22.216 --> 00:33:27.658]  Put your ear to the ground.
[00:33:27.658 --> 00:33:30.919]  And shut up from the sound.
[00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:34.000]  The death machine ain't slowing down.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.941]  It's getting powerful.
[00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:39.782]  Well, we've come out with a $7,500 contest.
[00:33:39.782 --> 00:33:45.885]  It's going to be an accelerated contest, only two weeks long, then one week to judge.
[00:33:45.885 --> 00:33:47.206]  Usually that takes months.
[00:33:47.206 --> 00:33:50.087]  You know, you get a month to do it and a month to judge.
[00:33:50.087 --> 00:33:51.148]  We're announcing it today.
[00:33:51.148 --> 00:33:55.690]  The contest will end in two weeks and we'll have the winner on Halloween.
[00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.651]  October 31st, first place $5,000, second place $200, third place $500.
[00:34:03.334 --> 00:34:09.360]  But everybody wins because you go print off the posters we've made or make your own poster.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.003]  Exposing the false politically correct deity Obama.
[00:34:13.003 --> 00:34:14.264]  Exposing collectivism.
[00:34:14.264 --> 00:34:15.305]  Exposing the open border.
[00:34:15.305 --> 00:34:17.527]  Whatever spectrum of that you want.
[00:34:17.527 --> 00:34:18.808]  Use our posters.
[00:34:18.808 --> 00:34:20.730]  Make your posters.
[00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:21.871]  Send us your posters.
[00:34:21.871 --> 00:34:24.393]  We'll post them on Facebook and Twitter and places.
[00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:27.096]  It's about showing the power of the people.
[00:34:27.096 --> 00:34:30.357]  We've done some of these contests that have become huge national news stories.
[00:34:30.357 --> 00:34:31.758]  They've all been very successful.
[00:34:31.758 --> 00:34:36.560]  And what you do is you shoot video of it, and then you put it on YouTube.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.921]  We link to the different videos.
[00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:40.002]  People watch them by the millions.
[00:34:40.002 --> 00:34:42.703]  You know, big videos get seen a million times, small ones 5,000.
[00:34:42.703 --> 00:34:42.983]  So what?
[00:34:42.983 --> 00:34:43.544]  That's a big deal.
[00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:48.204]  You go out, you get involved, you hang posters in legal and awful areas.
[00:34:48.204 --> 00:34:56.890]  Could be on your own barn, your own business, or a commons area, you know, where they hang rock and roll posters or church posters or, you know, dog show posters and nobody cares.
[00:34:56.890 --> 00:35:03.054]  Then when you do, they'll go, it's horrible, man, and arrest them just to show how they want to violate free speech.
[00:35:03.054 --> 00:35:07.356]  When that happens and the local news covers it, then they try to shut down free speech.
[00:35:07.356 --> 00:35:08.417]  More people do it.
[00:35:08.417 --> 00:35:09.378]  It backfires on them.
[00:35:10.336 --> 00:35:24.581]  So, Ebola, and we'll do a document cam shot and show people here, two of the posters, we have the files up on Infowars.com in the article on the homepage that we're going to tweet out right now and post to Facebook.
[00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:31.283]  In fact, I saw them with the contest page about an hour ago, so I don't see it on Infowars.com yet.
[00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:37.769]  So we'll get that up on InfoWars.com right now, or I guess it's not in the featured news area.
[00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:40.832]  Or maybe it hasn't cached yet off the cache into my...
[00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.931]  My computer.
[00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:44.633]  But just, we'll get it in the features.
[00:35:44.633 --> 00:35:45.854]  Top story.
[00:35:45.854 --> 00:35:47.896]  This contest.
[00:35:47.896 --> 00:35:51.680]  And I'm going to give folks the headline on the article right now.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.420]  Pound signed.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.083]  Ebola contest.
[00:35:55.083 --> 00:35:56.624]  Tyranny is the disease.
[00:35:56.624 --> 00:35:58.566]  Get engaged in the battle against tyranny.
[00:35:58.566 --> 00:35:59.667]  Within Fall Wars latest $7,500 contest.
[00:35:59.667 --> 00:35:59.828]  Ebola.
[00:36:03.611 --> 00:36:07.695]  Uh, is, uh, racist to criticize that they're leaving our borders wide open.
[00:36:07.695 --> 00:36:10.657]  Tell him to halt flights from Ebola-stricken hot zones.
[00:36:10.657 --> 00:36:12.478]  Close the open borders.
[00:36:12.478 --> 00:36:14.580]  Download our posters or make your own.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.803]  Shoot video of yourself posting in lawful places.
[00:36:17.803 --> 00:36:18.323]  First place, 5,000.
[00:36:18.323 --> 00:36:20.585]  Right down to 500, third place.
[00:36:20.585 --> 00:36:23.347]  Submit entries by Friday, October 24th.
[00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:31.794]  I will announce the winners on the show on All Saints' Eve, I guess you'd call it, or All Hallows' Eve, Halloween, October 31st.
[00:36:33.564 --> 00:36:37.831]  And again, then we'll dole out and post the videos to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:39.013]  We're going to tweet this out!
[00:36:41.425 --> 00:36:43.867]  Ebola is a disease.
[00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:46.989]  Right now, with a link to the article at Real Alex Jones.
[00:36:46.989 --> 00:36:48.811]  Please retweet it.
[00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:51.693]  And then again, the big glossy posters are a great way.
[00:36:51.693 --> 00:36:53.674]  Pound tyranny is the disease.
[00:36:53.674 --> 00:36:55.596]  Hashtag tyranny is the disease.
[00:36:55.596 --> 00:36:56.877]  Make that trend.
[00:36:56.877 --> 00:36:58.418]  Help expose it.
[00:36:58.418 --> 00:37:00.019]  And it says, secure the open border.
[00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:01.000]  Infowars.com.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.682]  And on the top, blasphemy against the January 5th.
[00:37:03.682 --> 00:37:06.884]  The empire is on the run.
[00:37:06.884 --> 00:37:10.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:37:12.403 --> 00:37:16.606]  And folks, we are live on this Thursday, the 16th day of October 2014.
[00:37:16.606 --> 00:37:20.268]  We're displaying a few minutes from last Friday.
[00:37:21.468 --> 00:37:42.972]  When we launch this new two-week contest that only has like another week or so to go for you to go out, post the posters, shoot the video, post it on YouTube to hopefully spur other people to realize that there is a public stand down going on by Obama and the CDC.
[00:37:42.972 --> 00:37:48.573]  Now Senator Ted Cruz has come out joining Governor Jindal from two weeks ago.
[00:37:50.313 --> 00:38:02.082]  As well as the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, saying they should restrict flights out of Ebola-stricken countries, and should stop giving visas to non-U.S.
[00:38:02.082 --> 00:38:04.263]  citizens to come here.
[00:38:04.263 --> 00:38:06.665]  An absolute no-brainer.
[00:38:06.665 --> 00:38:08.607]  The Caribbean islands are doing it.
[00:38:08.607 --> 00:38:10.828]  Central and South America are doing it.
[00:38:10.828 --> 00:38:14.571]  African nations bordering these countries are doing it.
[00:38:14.571 --> 00:38:17.613]  Italy's doing it.
[00:38:17.613 --> 00:38:18.534]  England's doing it.
[00:38:18.534 --> 00:38:18.954]  The U.K.
[00:38:20.606 --> 00:38:25.750]  France, but not the United States, because it's a religion.
[00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:35.897]  As Michael Savage said here on air last week, it doesn't matter if other countries can have borders, the United States cannot.
[00:38:35.897 --> 00:38:43.602]  There can never be the idea that a border or a nation being for citizens who pay the taxes, that cannot exist.
[00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:51.779]  Now let's go over the huge stack of breaking Ebola news to give you the latest on what's happening.
[00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:58.821]  Associated Press reports Ebola escalation could trigger major food crisis.
[00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:08.485]  The Global Famine Warning System is predicting a major food crisis if the Ebola outbreak continues to grow exponentially over the coming months and the United Nations still hasn't
[00:39:09.777 --> 00:39:20.063]  Reached over 750,000 people in need of food in West Africa who are without food as prices spiral and farms are abandoned.
[00:39:20.063 --> 00:39:27.947]  On the eve of the World Food Day Thursday, the UN agencies and non-governmental organizations are scrambling to scale up efforts to avert widespread hunger.
[00:39:28.962 --> 00:39:32.964]  The UN goes around with policies to shut down food production worldwide.
[00:39:32.964 --> 00:39:40.128]  Then they use the famines and wars they stir up on record to then get all the young women mainly to go give money to UNICEF.
[00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:43.050]  That's the news behind the news, the story behind the story.
[00:39:44.013 --> 00:39:51.055]  Another report out of CBS News, DFW Airport contractor forced to remove mask and gloves.
[00:39:51.055 --> 00:40:03.498]  That's why you've got protests going on and strikes for two and a half weeks in New York and other cities, as the people that are supposed to be cleaning the aircraft are told that they can't wear masks and gloves.
[00:40:03.498 --> 00:40:10.920]  Aircraft coming in out of West Africa, in some cases with vomit in them, because it'll, quote, scare people.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.160]  We're gonna get to those articles in a moment.
[00:40:13.163 --> 00:40:19.426]  Experts offer steps for avoiding public hysteria, a different contagious threat.
[00:40:19.426 --> 00:40:27.289]  So we've been talking about the hysteria being a bigger problem than Ebola itself, well now the New York Times is reporting on it today.
[00:40:28.482 --> 00:40:29.943]  Here is another one.
[00:40:29.943 --> 00:40:30.844]  It's very important.
[00:40:30.844 --> 00:40:35.628]  CDC Ebola patient traveled by air with low-grade fever.
[00:40:35.628 --> 00:40:48.437]  They'd first said that it was her fault and she shouldn't have done it, but now it's admitted in NBC News that Ebola patient who contacted the CDC before flight agency says
[00:40:49.258 --> 00:40:56.723]  was told that she could fly even though she was an Ebola nurse and even though she told him she had a fever.
[00:40:56.723 --> 00:41:00.225]  By the way, I treated the guy that has Ebola and I'm sick.
[00:41:00.225 --> 00:41:02.286]  Can I fly?
[00:41:02.286 --> 00:41:06.709]  That's like saying, my dog has rabies and it's foaming at the mouth.
[00:41:06.709 --> 00:41:09.010]  Should I put it into a schoolyard of kids?
[00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.913]  Yes, put the dog with rabies into the schoolyard.
[00:41:12.913 --> 00:41:16.535]  Or, I found a bat crawling around hissing on the ground.
[00:41:16.535 --> 00:41:17.876]  Should I pick it up and kiss it?
[00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.237]  Yes, that's a good idea.
[00:41:20.237 --> 00:41:23.499]  There's a cliff by my house, a thousand feet to a jagged bottom.
[00:41:23.499 --> 00:41:25.200]  Should I jump off without a parachute?
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.861]  Yes, jump off immediately.
[00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:27.301]  Ring.
[00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:30.023]  Hi, I'm a nurse that treated the Ebola patient, CDC.
[00:41:30.023 --> 00:41:31.544]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, we know who you are.
[00:41:31.544 --> 00:41:32.964]  Yeah, you're all over the news.
[00:41:32.964 --> 00:41:34.765]  Yeah, I'm gonna fly.
[00:41:34.765 --> 00:41:35.886]  Of course, this time it wasn't on the news.
[00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:37.507]  It's just been around an Ebola patient.
[00:41:37.507 --> 00:41:39.188]  So, I was treating an Ebola patient.
[00:41:39.188 --> 00:41:39.728]  I'm gonna fly.
[00:41:39.728 --> 00:41:40.669]  I have a fever.
[00:41:40.669 --> 00:41:42.570]  Oh, dearie, that's a great idea.
[00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:46.702]  They're not just turning off the defaults.
[00:41:46.702 --> 00:41:49.424]  They're sending the Ebola kids to school.
[00:41:49.424 --> 00:41:51.366]  They're not cleaning up the apartment.
[00:41:51.366 --> 00:41:52.827]  Something weird is going on.
[00:41:52.827 --> 00:41:57.691]  And why are nurses getting it, but the family isn't getting it?
[00:41:57.691 --> 00:42:08.178]  Either they're covering up that they have it, or it's what that CIA whistleblower said back in the middle of last month here, Mr. Steele.
[00:42:08.178 --> 00:42:10.200]  Maybe we should cue that clip up later.
[00:42:11.607 --> 00:42:20.740]  He said he believed they would release a biological simulant that wasn't Ebola but would make people sick or even kill them to create a false flag.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.867]  That's what he said on air two weeks before this Ebola thing even broke or even started.
[00:42:27.048 --> 00:42:29.570]  And I'm not saying this isn't real.
[00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.072]  You've got a lot of deaths in Africa, over 4,000.
[00:42:32.072 --> 00:42:37.095]  You've got hundreds of thousands that have gotten it, who may end up dying from it.
[00:42:37.095 --> 00:42:41.438]  You've got UN models of 1.4 million dying or getting it.
[00:42:41.438 --> 00:42:52.787]  I don't know what the truth is, but if you've got a global system caught staging hoaxes or creating al-Qaeda and changing the name and having them attack countries and when the public finds out changing the name again and then
[00:42:53.507 --> 00:42:56.770]  You know, the Kurds call for support against them, so you bomb the Kurds instead?
[00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:00.774]  I mean, this is all happening because of public ignorance.
[00:43:00.774 --> 00:43:03.517]  The establishment thinks they can do whatever they want.
[00:43:03.517 --> 00:43:07.661]  And beyond public ignorance, this is all happening.
[00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:24.610]  Because, even if we're awake, the system runs the courts, they run most of the legislative systems, they run the investigative systems, they run the so-called security apparatus, and so they're above the law.
[00:43:25.455 --> 00:43:31.801]  But see, when elites get above the law, they always bring the law of nature into play.
[00:43:31.801 --> 00:43:41.430]  They become delusional, they go too far, just like criminals do, and they end up destroying their own system or destroying themselves or being self-destructive.
[00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:47.156]  Most psychopaths are very, very meticulous and maybe commit one murder a year for 15, 20 years.
[00:43:49.383 --> 00:43:53.706]  Then they start committing two or three murders a year for a couple years.
[00:43:53.706 --> 00:43:56.907]  Then suddenly four or five murders a year.
[00:43:56.907 --> 00:44:00.509]  Then they'll kill three or four people in a week.
[00:44:00.509 --> 00:44:06.853]  And they'll start dumping dead bodies out in the back of the police station and writing letters taunting the police, wanting to get caught.
[00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:15.258]  We're now reaching that point where they openly say on the Council on Foreign Relations, we need to fund Al-Qaeda and we are funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:16.237 --> 00:44:22.342]  Where they openly write books admitting they're putting fluoride in the water to brain damage us, the White House science czar.
[00:44:22.342 --> 00:44:30.928]  Where they just say two plus two equals five, you didn't build your business, the death panels are wonderful, on and on and on.
[00:44:30.928 --> 00:44:35.511]  This is the point that we've now reached with these people.
[00:44:35.511 --> 00:44:39.954]  Hi, I'm a nurse that treated the Ebola patient in Dallas.
[00:44:39.954 --> 00:44:41.396]  I'm sick, but I'd like to fly.
[00:44:41.396 --> 00:44:42.356]  Should I?
[00:44:42.356 --> 00:44:44.398]  Yes, honey, you go ahead and do that.
[00:44:46.172 --> 00:44:49.615]  They tell you don't fly if you've got a fever, period.
[00:44:49.615 --> 00:44:54.480]  Just like the default until six years ago was a pregnant woman never takes a vaccine.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.941]  It causes miscarriages.
[00:44:55.941 --> 00:44:58.423]  It causes neurological disorders in the babies.
[00:44:58.423 --> 00:44:59.164]  It's on record.
[00:44:59.164 --> 00:45:00.445]  It's on the inserts.
[00:45:00.445 --> 00:45:04.969]  Now they say pregnant women need double flu.
[00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:09.854]  Take two and take everything else.
[00:45:09.854 --> 00:45:10.735]  It's all about
[00:45:12.196 --> 00:45:24.986]  I mean I hate to get gross here but you've heard about the phenomenon in government buildings suddenly that people are peeing on the walls and going to the bathroom and cubby holes and in the hallways even though the bathrooms are working perfectly fine and smearing it all over the walls.
[00:45:24.986 --> 00:45:26.768]  This is what mental patients do.
[00:45:26.768 --> 00:45:34.294]  This is what people who are above the law start doing is just running around going to the bathroom as poop bandits as they're known.
[00:45:36.693 --> 00:45:38.613]  This is what has now happened.
[00:45:38.613 --> 00:45:46.935]  In a decadent society that goes insane, Japan used to be the most clean country in the world, obsessed with cleanliness, obsessed with being honorable.
[00:45:46.935 --> 00:45:52.657]  Now Japan has an epidemic of adults, not old people, adults wearing diapers.
[00:45:52.657 --> 00:45:55.878]  And the big thing is to go to the bathroom on yourself.
[00:45:55.878 --> 00:46:00.559]  And they have things that I'm not going to even mention on air that are a phenomenon now.
[00:46:00.559 --> 00:46:06.080]  The most popular overall fetish bars in Japan now are scatological.
[00:46:08.223 --> 00:46:10.924]  And you say, Alex, why are you going here?
[00:46:10.924 --> 00:46:18.927]  Well, psychopaths end up killing three people a week when they start falling apart and going off the rails.
[00:46:18.927 --> 00:46:20.308]  Not one a year.
[00:46:20.308 --> 00:46:33.673]  But the average yuppie trendy just starts wallowing around, not paying their bills, not working, and wearing adult diapers.
[00:46:33.673 --> 00:46:37.655]  It's like Idiocracy that Mike Judge made, genius film that he wrote.
[00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:47.196]  In the film, people are so decadent they think being able to talk is not trendy, so the dumber you are, the cooler you are.
[00:46:47.196 --> 00:46:55.520]  And people's easy chairs drive them to the refrigerator so you don't have to get up off your easy chair and have a toilet in them.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.220]  Guess what?
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.901]  They've now come out with that.
[00:46:57.901 --> 00:46:59.682]  Idiocracy came out, what, 10 years ago?
[00:46:59.682 --> 00:47:02.623]  11 years ago?
[00:47:02.623 --> 00:47:04.404]  Now, guess where?
[00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:09.547]  Japan is producing easy chairs with toilets in them.
[00:47:10.874 --> 00:47:12.956]  And robots that wipe your hind end.
[00:47:12.956 --> 00:47:15.578]  And by the way, I'm not the one focusing in on this.
[00:47:15.578 --> 00:47:16.779]  This is not potty humor.
[00:47:16.779 --> 00:47:19.300]  I'm not five years old.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.341]  Or four years old.
[00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:21.622]  This is what's happening.
[00:47:21.622 --> 00:47:32.971]  Our civilization is degenerating and we have this fascist pig mayor down in Houston wanting to arrest preachers that give anti-homosexual sermons.
[00:47:36.598 --> 00:47:37.778]  That's where we're going here.
[00:47:37.778 --> 00:47:42.040]  We can't stop Ebola, but let me tell you, we can pay for everybody to have a sex change.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.041]  This is a society about to collapse.
[00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:57.264]  Every indicator, every red balloon, every red flag, every yardstick, we are in deep level crisis.
[00:47:57.264 --> 00:47:58.205]  Let's continue here.
[00:47:58.205 --> 00:48:04.927]  911 emergency dispatchers instructed not to say Ebola over the radio.
[00:48:09.758 --> 00:48:12.579]  That's out of Fox News, D.C.
[00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:19.221]  They're being told not to create panic and are being given a secret code to describe Ebola.
[00:48:19.221 --> 00:48:20.642]  See, the cover-up's already on.
[00:48:20.642 --> 00:48:24.683]  As I said, Ebola probably is already spreading in the U.S.
[00:48:24.683 --> 00:48:31.406]  They had to let it in and let it breed first and then they'll say they don't know where it all began or where it started and, oh, it's all Obama's fault.
[00:48:32.642 --> 00:48:42.691]  And it's going to bring in a medical tyranny, forced inoculation, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation dedicated to population reduction and the Monsanto vaccine they produced.
[00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:43.492]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:48:43.492 --> 00:48:45.053]  Bill Gates, we keep warning you about.
[00:48:45.053 --> 00:48:46.855]  People are like, why do you know about Bill Gates so much?
[00:48:46.855 --> 00:48:48.336]  Because I've studied him.
[00:48:48.336 --> 00:48:50.838]  He wants to put an Ebola shot in you.
[00:48:50.838 --> 00:48:53.321]  You think that's going to be good for you?
[00:48:53.321 --> 00:48:53.721]  U.S.
[00:48:53.721 --> 00:48:58.365]  embassies in Ebola-stricken countries are still processing visas for non-U.S.
[00:48:58.365 --> 00:48:58.846]  citizens.
[00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:08.017]  That's from Representative Royce of California, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, confirming that.
[00:49:08.017 --> 00:49:12.681]  Frontier jet that carried Ebola patient made five more flights after that.
[00:49:14.522 --> 00:49:21.325]  Colombia and other Central South American and Caribbean countries ban Ebola flights from Ebola nations.
[00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:26.607]  Boehner says travel bans should be considered by President as Ebola crisis worsens.
[00:49:26.607 --> 00:49:29.108]  Senator Cruz says they should recall Congress.
[00:49:29.108 --> 00:49:30.408]  Think so?
[00:49:30.408 --> 00:49:31.269]  Yeah.
[00:49:31.269 --> 00:49:38.872]  Recall Congress, vote on whether to authorize bombing ISIS or not, which you're supposed to do, they haven't done that, and vote on this.
[00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:45.768]  Why no protective gear for a man with Dallas Ebola patient?
[00:49:45.768 --> 00:49:46.629]  We have video of this.
[00:49:46.629 --> 00:49:48.130]  We'll roll some of it in the background.
[00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:52.352]  The video from CBS News is up on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:52.352 --> 00:50:03.740]  This lends credence to Rob Dew running around the office thinking this is crisis actors because he's been analyzing video and he's worked at National TV, Home Shopping Network.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.461]  You know, he used to be a director there.
[00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:08.362]  And so he knows stage stuff.
[00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:15.426]  And he says that, you know, why are people not wearing protective gear with the Ebola patient?
[00:50:15.426 --> 00:50:17.987]  As we have right there.
[00:50:17.987 --> 00:50:22.349]  And is it people just don't care and they're idiots?
[00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:24.750]  Or is it staged?
[00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.192]  A lot of people around here think it's something staged.
[00:50:27.192 --> 00:50:29.313]  Doesn't mean there's not Ebola out there, it just means
[00:50:31.365 --> 00:50:39.448]  Again, you've got a supposed Ebola patient, and you've got somebody walking around with him with a clipboard, not even wearing a paper mask.
[00:50:39.448 --> 00:50:43.329]  You've got cops out there standing around.
[00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:50.152]  And then you've got this individual directing them.
[00:50:50.152 --> 00:50:53.253]  I don't know.
[00:50:53.253 --> 00:50:57.214]  So, fresh Ebola fears hit airline stocks.
[00:50:57.214 --> 00:50:59.415]  We've got a bunch of news coming up on that front.

[00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:06.893]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.893 --> 00:52:15.019]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:15.019 --> 00:52:19.541]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.

[00:52:23.504 --> 00:52:29.447]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.

[00:54:15.013 --> 00:54:17.836]  Just going back to why I thought Kill the Messenger was so powerful.
[00:54:17.836 --> 00:54:18.817]  I knew Gary Webb.
[00:54:18.817 --> 00:54:19.597]  Never met him in person.
[00:54:19.597 --> 00:54:21.899]  I interviewed him probably 15 or more times.
[00:54:21.899 --> 00:54:27.885]  Talked to him on the phone dozens and dozens of times for hours at some point.
[00:54:27.885 --> 00:54:28.926]  My wife remembers all this.
[00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:36.571]  And when I watched the movie, he talked and acted just like Gary Webb.
[00:54:36.571 --> 00:54:39.473]  I mean, he should win an Oscar for this.
[00:54:39.473 --> 00:54:44.577]  But if people didn't know Gary Webb, they won't know what a great job Jeremy Renner did.
[00:54:44.577 --> 00:54:47.900]  And that's a whole other side issue.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:53.464]  I'm getting into Ebola, what's happening in the stock market right now.
[00:54:53.464 --> 00:54:55.586]  It's just crazy.
[00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:58.308]  And then we've got all this whistleblower intel coming in.
[00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:10.923]  Whistleblowers and Infowars.com, that's whistleblowers with an S, and Infowars.com of your nurses, medical workers, military, family that's got military over there, sending 5,000 U.S.
[00:55:10.923 --> 00:55:12.584]  troops.
[00:55:12.584 --> 00:55:15.446]  Most of them aren't even trained in NBC properly.
[00:55:15.446 --> 00:55:20.289]  They're trained how to put on NBC gear, but they're not NBC specialists.
[00:55:20.289 --> 00:55:24.772]  Is a perfect way, and now they've got the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying that they will quarantine U.S.
[00:55:24.772 --> 00:55:26.734]  troops when and if they get it.
[00:55:26.734 --> 00:55:28.335]  I mean, what a disaster!
[00:55:29.895 --> 00:55:31.696]  You don't send soldiers.
[00:55:31.696 --> 00:55:36.978]  You send volunteer virologists and epidemiologists to the hot zone.
[00:55:36.978 --> 00:55:41.019]  You do not send soldiers.
[00:55:41.019 --> 00:55:44.461]  Unless you're training them for martial law.
[00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:47.322]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but I'll tell you this.
[00:55:47.322 --> 00:55:51.883]  Most of this is staged, it's scripted, and they clearly want Ebola to spread.
[00:55:51.883 --> 00:55:55.145]  Now you can fill in the blank of why.
[00:55:55.145 --> 00:55:58.506]  My head is spinning at this point, and I'm trying to contain my anger.
[00:56:00.327 --> 00:56:04.228]  Even during the breaks I'm trying to contain it.
[00:56:04.228 --> 00:56:06.929]  Because I think about how they're trying to bring down this country.
[00:56:06.929 --> 00:56:10.930]  Now they're trying to kill our prosperity.
[00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.410]  It makes me angry.
[00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:18.051]  And you can see the CDC ignoring their own protocols on purpose.
[00:56:18.051 --> 00:56:20.372]  Folks, they wouldn't let people with TB in.
[00:56:20.372 --> 00:56:23.093]  They're letting people with Ebola in.
[00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:26.334]  CDC says it missed opportunities to contain Ebola.
[00:56:26.334 --> 00:56:27.874]  Oh, we're sorry, it's getting out now.
[00:56:28.926 --> 00:56:31.867]  Oh my goodness, that's out of Yahoo News.
[00:56:31.867 --> 00:56:33.447]  AP.
[00:56:33.447 --> 00:56:36.888]  Nurses, we were told to call authorities for Ebola protocol.
[00:56:36.888 --> 00:56:40.248]  You don't take Ebola patients to a regular hospital.
[00:56:40.248 --> 00:56:44.089]  The default is you take them to a CDC emergency center.
[00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:48.010]  They got 36 of them!
[00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:53.831]  That's why Bloomberg two days ago was asking, why weren't they sent to the government facilities that are designed for this?
[00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:56.011]  Because they want it to spread.
[00:56:56.011 --> 00:56:57.832]  They want plausible deniability.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:03.241]  They probably got sleeper cells walking around spreading it.
[00:57:03.241 --> 00:57:06.142]  I didn't think they'd use Muslim radicals to bring it in before.
[00:57:06.142 --> 00:57:10.084]  I thought that was just some, you know, Islamophobe hype.
[00:57:10.084 --> 00:57:13.825]  But now it's starting to click that God only knows.
[00:57:13.825 --> 00:57:16.306]  I think the other shoe is about to drop.
[00:57:16.306 --> 00:57:17.667]  I think something big's about to happen.
[00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:19.167]  I've been saying that for months.
[00:57:19.167 --> 00:57:20.728]  And now you see this breaking loose.
[00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:24.909]  I think what you're seeing right now might be a diversion for nukes they're about to set off.
[00:57:24.909 --> 00:57:26.150]  Remember all the missing nukes?
[00:57:27.885 --> 00:57:34.249]  I am literally never have been on spider-sense level like this.
[00:57:34.249 --> 00:57:35.509]  I have never.
[00:57:35.509 --> 00:57:37.771]  And I'm not trying to panic people, folks.
[00:57:37.771 --> 00:57:50.038]  I'm trying to get you to understand that you just see all the indicators and the stock market and a government funding Al-Qaeda and trying to start wars with Russia and raising the taxes till the country shuts down and Obamacare.
[00:57:50.538 --> 00:57:53.760]  I mean, it is just, we have enemies in control.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:58:02.346]  There is no doubt that we are in the most grave danger this country has faced in 240 years, and I just got hardcore chills.
[00:58:02.346 --> 00:58:04.727]  I got goosebumps on my face right now.
[00:58:04.727 --> 00:58:08.410]  The camera can probably pick up.
[00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:09.831]  They are getting ready to drop the hammer.
[00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:11.972]  This is the takedown of the country.
[00:58:11.972 --> 00:58:13.473]  I'm getting my immune system ready.
[00:58:13.473 --> 00:58:14.094]  I know that.
[00:58:14.094 --> 00:58:15.174]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:19.206]  The Survival Shield X2.
[00:58:19.206 --> 00:58:22.388]  Super male, super female vitality.
[00:58:22.388 --> 00:58:24.569]  The Oxy Powder that flushes out the guts.
[00:58:24.569 --> 00:58:27.370]  70% of the immune system, they say, is in the guts.
[00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.691]  The Lung Cleanse.
[00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:29.031]  All of it.
[00:58:29.031 --> 00:58:30.672]  That's what I'm doing for me and my family.
[00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:31.973]  That's how you support the broadcast.
[00:58:31.973 --> 00:58:35.655]  InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:35.655 --> 00:58:38.136]  Stay with us.
[00:58:38.136 --> 00:58:40.137]  Second Hour coming up.
[00:58:40.137 --> 00:58:41.978]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.
[00:58:42.538 --> 00:58:43.340]  This isn't a drill.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.381]  It isn't a game.
[00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:48.227]  I've always been... M4 has always been at the center of the real fight.
[00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:59.322]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[00:58:59.322 --> 00:59:09.247]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:59:09.247 --> 00:59:12.169]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:59:12.369 --> 00:59:12.990]  I think so.
[00:59:27.366 --> 00:59:28.587]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:10.337]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.337 --> 01:00:11.918]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:13.460]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.664]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.664 --> 01:00:21.988]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.988 --> 01:00:28.215]  Alright, Dr. Steve Pucinich, I wanted to get him on a few weeks ago about North Korea, where he's been.
[01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:31.258]  I wanted to get him on about funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:31.258 --> 01:00:33.159]  I wanted to get him on about messing with Russia.
[01:00:33.159 --> 01:00:38.661]  Because he'll give you a big insider, you know, Council on Foreign Relations guy until he resigned.
[01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:42.723]  Exposes 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.603]  Did the Camp David Accords.
[01:00:44.603 --> 01:00:47.485]  He's a psychiatrist and medical doctor.
[01:00:47.485 --> 01:00:51.666]  And when it gets to super spooky spooks, he's it.
[01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.187]  So he's going to be joining us.
[01:00:53.187 --> 01:00:55.508]  Co-wrote a bunch of books and movies with Tom Clancy.
[01:00:57.961 --> 01:01:11.850]  So, Steve Pucinich's coming on for 30-40 minutes, then we got Max Keiser popping in on what's happening with the bond market, and I need to be more professional, but one side of me says I should settle down and not be so angry, because this is not an act.
[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.552]  I can barely do the radio show at this point, okay?
[01:01:14.552 --> 01:01:25.780]  I mean, I can barely even be here at this point, because the insanity of them bringing Ebola patients in, letting it spread, not putting them in Level 4 facilities, they're doing it on purpose!
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.101]  They are not inept!
[01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:31.717]  And people are like, oh, well it won't spread that bad.
[01:01:31.717 --> 01:01:34.398]  I don't know what they're up to, but it's bad, okay?
[01:01:34.398 --> 01:01:39.139]  This is part of some big, nasty war they're about to launch.
[01:01:39.139 --> 01:01:50.143]  Just like the Fast and Furious in Benghazi, and the open borders, and the super viruses out of Latin America, and the shutting down the power plants, and... I don't even care about money, folks.
[01:01:50.143 --> 01:01:58.005]  I mean, I've always tried to have crew and members and build an operation and spend almost all the money that comes in on the operation, and all my employees pay taxes.
[01:01:59.073 --> 01:02:10.139]  Now they've got it set up where if I buy equipment and things, it's counted as like money I have, and so I'm like paying more taxes.
[01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:14.741]  I have to like make more money to pay taxes, not even to get money.
[01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:15.822]  This is new!
[01:02:15.822 --> 01:02:17.223]  This country's gone!
[01:02:17.223 --> 01:02:21.045]  I've got to go hire accounting firms like Arthur Anderson, basically.
[01:02:21.045 --> 01:02:24.967]  I've been told by lawyers to play all sorts of games to even make any money.
[01:02:26.345 --> 01:02:33.803]  And it's not that I'm even upset that I'm not making any money as I bring in record amounts to run the operation.
[01:02:33.803 --> 01:02:35.848]  It's that this government's so evil!
[01:02:37.773 --> 01:02:58.979]  That in America, folks, if you are truly upper middle class and you run an operation that costs over $10 million a year to run, that they've got it set up that if you play by their rules and you pay the taxes and use the standard, you know, CPA firm, so you're bulletproof to not be audited, that they just take all your money and give it to the government, basically.
[01:02:58.979 --> 01:02:59.840]  They let you keep like 10% of it.
[01:03:02.932 --> 01:03:04.753]  I mean, what a screwed up nation!
[01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:08.016]  The United States is now 36th in the world.
[01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:13.560]  Came out in a big college study last month for economic and social freedom as well.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.961]  We used to be number one.
[01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:17.663]  We're 36th in the world.
[01:03:17.663 --> 01:03:21.046]  Folks, we're not a free country anymore, except for free speech.
[01:03:21.046 --> 01:03:29.993]  And now, the stinking mayor is suing and subpoenaing a whole bunch of churches that criticize the city's plan
[01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:41.534]  To basically pay for sex changes and make the public schools have, you know, boys and girls in each other's bathrooms.
[01:03:41.534 --> 01:03:44.857]  You know how much trouble that would have caused when I was in high school?
[01:03:44.857 --> 01:03:49.561]  I mean, I'm not a modest person, but I didn't like going to the bathroom when somebody else was in there.
[01:03:50.441 --> 01:03:52.402]  And that's really uncomfortable.
[01:03:52.402 --> 01:03:55.023]  To be in the bathroom with girls.
[01:03:55.023 --> 01:03:58.865]  And it's just these pervert weirdos wanting to mess with us.
[01:03:58.865 --> 01:04:09.050]  I mean, can't we go to the crapper and not have women in the day- I mean, I'm getting- This country's run by a bunch of mind control lunatics!
[01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.330]  I've had it with you people!
[01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:11.631]  With you freaks!
[01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:14.132]  Who want to run our lives!
[01:04:14.132 --> 01:04:15.433]  You want to dress up like a woman?
[01:04:15.433 --> 01:04:16.273]  More power to you?
[01:04:16.273 --> 01:04:17.714]  I don't care!
[01:04:17.714 --> 01:04:19.415]  But stop messing with our kids!
[01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:23.413]  Man, I'm sick of it!
[01:04:23.413 --> 01:04:24.854]  Leave us alone!
[01:04:24.854 --> 01:04:26.495]  But they crave running our lives.
[01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:29.676]  They crave to Rachel Maddow and all these people.
[01:04:29.676 --> 01:04:32.077]  They crave telling us 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:35.799]  They crave telling us we didn't build our business, as they suck everything out of us.
[01:04:35.799 --> 01:04:37.380]  They crave it!
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.841]  They crave destroying this country!
[01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.082]  They crave it!
[01:04:41.082 --> 01:04:44.103]  Bunch of mentally ill people!
[01:04:44.103 --> 01:04:45.424]  Dr. Steve Puccini's gonna join us.
[01:04:45.424 --> 01:04:46.645]  I'm gonna try to settle down a little bit.
[01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:51.073]  But, uh, it's just incredible all the news we've got to cover here today.
[01:04:51.073 --> 01:04:54.195]  InfoWars.com, FrozenPlanet.tv.
[01:04:54.195 --> 01:04:57.337]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:00.932]  The experts are clear.
[01:05:00.932 --> 01:05:08.054]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:05:08.054 --> 01:05:14.317]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:05:14.317 --> 01:05:17.918]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:05:18.038 --> 01:05:22.259]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:05:22.259 --> 01:05:27.581]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:28.581]  Not our iodine.
[01:05:28.581 --> 01:05:32.402]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:05:32.402 --> 01:05:34.943]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:06:02.823 --> 01:06:11.067]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:16.489]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:06:33.082 --> 01:06:37.364]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:37.364 --> 01:06:39.145]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:39.145 --> 01:06:44.468]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:47.009]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:06:47.009 --> 01:06:48.150]  But for how long?
[01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:50.351]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:54.773]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:54.773 --> 01:06:56.654]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:06:56.654 --> 01:06:57.595]  Just won't quit.
[01:06:58.922 --> 01:07:06.071]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:08.414]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:08.414 --> 01:07:13.700]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.646]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:18.866 --> 01:07:22.187]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:22.187 --> 01:07:26.248]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:26.248 --> 01:07:30.569]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:40.792]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.333]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:43.473 --> 01:07:44.874]  Well, Ebola anxiety is growing.
[01:08:12.586 --> 01:08:13.047]  The U.N.
[01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:16.810]  says the threat of the virus might interfere with commerce and daily routines.
[01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:23.116]  It's even tied to global stock markets being down and a bull's running for the exits on U.S.
[01:08:23.116 --> 01:08:24.817]  Treasuries.
[01:08:24.817 --> 01:08:28.221]  The yield on a 10-year Treasury, a key barometer of the strength of the U.S.
[01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:35.667]  economy, fell below 2% for the first time since the Federal Reserve began talking about removing its monetary stimulus in May of 2013 or ending
[01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:41.343]  QE unlimited or QE infinity.
[01:08:41.343 --> 01:08:42.944]  Yes, it's not going to be infinity.
[01:08:42.944 --> 01:08:45.627]  Well, they're still going to give central banks unlimited free money.
[01:08:45.627 --> 01:08:48.048]  Just you're not going to be getting it.
[01:08:48.048 --> 01:08:55.174]  You call it stagflation because you have a depression in the real economy and major commodities like oil, except for gold.
[01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:57.416]  That's up today.
[01:08:57.416 --> 01:09:02.620]  And you have a depression in the real economy in the West, but also in Asia to a great extent.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.421]  That's growth is slowing.
[01:09:04.421 --> 01:09:07.424]  But then you do have devaluation of currencies worldwide.
[01:09:08.373 --> 01:09:08.453]  Yes.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:39.846]  Interests that seek, under an Agenda 21, Cloward and Piven style strategy, to depress the global economy, give themselves unlimited liquidity, so they can buy up world markets.
[01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:52.853]  So it's economic warfare, it's a consolidation, and it's not being done, like the British Empire with mercantilism, or the French system, to make its colonies be subservient and poor, while making the empire rich.
[01:09:54.028 --> 01:10:02.735]  That is a parasitic system, but still, it creates largesse for those who are culturally part of the empire, or religiously part of it.
[01:10:02.735 --> 01:10:09.260]  This is a very centralized system, and Dr. Steve Pachetnik joins us to cover the waterfront.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:18.747]  I know he's worked on the economy a lot, and worked in big banking, but a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, helped run the successful Camp David Accords, co-wrote books, and made films with Tom Clancy.
[01:10:19.688 --> 01:10:24.953]  He ran psychological operations out of the State Department, advising the military and the CIA.
[01:10:24.953 --> 01:10:28.796]  For those that don't know how it works, the State Department pretty much runs it all.
[01:10:28.796 --> 01:10:35.381]  And so he is a spy, spy, and of course worked with the Bushes and James Baker and all the rest of them.
[01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:37.463]  So he'll give you his unique perspective.
[01:10:37.463 --> 01:10:39.025]  I don't know what it is yet.
[01:10:39.025 --> 01:10:40.266]  You can go to stevepchenik.com.
[01:10:40.266 --> 01:10:41.447]  I've seen some of his views.
[01:10:41.447 --> 01:10:43.408]  But I want to know his view on what's happening in the world markets.
[01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:47.653]  Clearly they stood down with Ebola, let it begin to spread.
[01:10:47.653 --> 01:10:48.293]  What is that about?
[01:10:48.293 --> 01:10:49.074]  About a vaccine?
[01:10:49.074 --> 01:10:51.297]  A political diversion?
[01:10:51.297 --> 01:10:53.179]  Or maybe he disagrees with me?
[01:10:53.179 --> 01:10:54.360]  What's happening with ISIS?
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.762]  What's happening with Russia?
[01:10:55.762 --> 01:11:01.968]  To cover the waterfront, Dr. Steve Pachinik, North Korea, where he traveled last year, reported for us.
[01:11:01.968 --> 01:11:03.230]  Thank you for coming on with us today.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.741]  Oh, it's always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:11:05.741 --> 01:11:07.683]  I don't know if I can bring you the good news.
[01:11:07.683 --> 01:11:13.167]  I can give you some of the bad news, some of the better news, but I'll try to do the best I can.
[01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:17.230]  Number one, Ebola is a real problem.
[01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:21.974]  It's a problem that's been outstanding for quite a while, and we've done nothing about it.
[01:11:21.974 --> 01:11:27.698]  Once again, as I said about our president, he's really quite failed at leadership, as you've seen repeatedly.
[01:11:28.348 --> 01:11:34.613]  More importantly, however, the CDC, or the Center for Disease Control, has really failed.
[01:11:34.613 --> 01:11:40.838]  And I think I would ask for Dr. Friesen, the Director of the CDC, to resign immediately.
[01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.020]  He has been repeatedly wrong.
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.482]  He has given the wrong advice.
[01:11:45.482 --> 01:11:46.883]  He has approached it with
[01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:50.302]  Very inappropriate comment.
[01:11:50.302 --> 01:11:56.685]  And by the way, doctor, I should add you're not just a psychiatrist, board-certified examining psychiatrist who's run major institutions.
[01:11:56.685 --> 01:11:58.386]  I'm not bragging, just your credentials.
[01:11:58.386 --> 01:12:02.869]  You're also a medical doctor on top of that, so you can speak to Ebola.
[01:12:02.869 --> 01:12:03.829]  Yes, correctly.
[01:12:03.829 --> 01:12:09.312]  And more importantly, I was trained at Cornell University Medical College between 64 and 1968 by a very competent
[01:12:12.071 --> 01:12:13.432]  We're good to go.
[01:12:32.901 --> 01:12:47.009]  Because they really have no, they're not effective, they've been inefficient, and they have no authoritative capacity to demand either the city, the state, or any institution to do what's mandatory.
[01:12:47.009 --> 01:12:58.796]  Instead, I think that Fauci, Dr. Tony Fauci, should be given executive privilege or executive authority by the President of the United States, consistent with 1892 constitutional authority.
[01:12:59.532 --> 01:13:05.456]  Well, military powers, if need be, because we no longer have the Public Health Service, which is not functioning.
[01:13:05.456 --> 01:13:08.539]  We don't seem to have a Surgeon General that's not functioning.
[01:13:08.539 --> 01:13:11.180]  We don't have HHS, which is not functioning.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:17.605]  So every civilian branch of our government has been dysfunctional, which is consistent with your argument.
[01:13:18.064 --> 01:13:21.507]  I don't know why you're paying taxes because none of this is working.
[01:13:21.507 --> 01:13:43.302]  What is working, and I will tell you, and there's some of those people out there who disagree with me, but I think it's important for me to elucidate, is that we have 4,000 soldiers that were sent into Liberia, Sierra Leone, and West Africa, not to control it, but basically to maintain and institute what's called ISR, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance.
[01:13:44.048 --> 01:13:49.801]  Most of the drones that were used in the Afghan-Pakistani war are now used to fight diseases.
[01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:50.904]  This is important now.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:14:04.325]  The military has switched from a combatant role in West Africa to a very effective disease control and surveillance role, where we need the intelligence that the civilians could not provide.
[01:14:04.325 --> 01:14:19.871]  But our military generals, thanks to Martin Dempsey, have been able to provide, and General Williams in North Africa, and our brave men and women who volunteered to go to AFRICOM in order to monitor through intelligence, through surveillance, through data mining,
[01:14:20.593 --> 01:14:28.283]  And through training the Liberian Army and maintaining a peace accord between the Liberian Army and Sierra Leone.
[01:14:28.283 --> 01:14:33.969]  Because these two countries that are replete with Ebola are ready to fight each other.
[01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:38.635]  So our soldiers are really in a unique position that we rarely talk about.
[01:14:38.795 --> 01:14:54.044]  So you're saying it's a good move to send in 4,000 troops to stop civil war and to try to give intelligence, HUMET, but also electronic surveillance to be able to model the battle space and to try to stop Ebola.
[01:14:54.044 --> 01:14:56.205]  So are you saying that's a good move by Obama?
[01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:57.046]  One of the few good moves?
[01:14:57.659 --> 01:15:03.184]  Yes, that was an excellent move and that was initiated by our military and Obama agreed to it.
[01:15:03.184 --> 01:15:09.729]  But I give full credit to General Martin Dempsey, General Williams, and the AFRICOM units because they initiated this.
[01:15:10.847 --> 01:15:24.870]  I think we have to get in there very quickly, be able to contain the situation, and be able to monitor the entire battlefield of diseases and transfer all of their assets, intelligence assets, to West Africa.
[01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:31.291]  Eventually, I would hope that the plane flights from Liberia and Sierra Leone would cease and desist.
[01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:37.792]  This is absolute nonsense that United and Belgian Airlines are saying that this helps humanitarian conditions.
[01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:38.452]  It does not.
[01:15:39.079 --> 01:15:40.580]  We need an isolation.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:45.363]  We need a quarantine area, which we have had historically.
[01:15:45.363 --> 01:15:47.824]  In 1890, when immigrants came into the United States,
[01:15:48.325 --> 01:15:49.405]  Through Ellis Island.
[01:15:49.405 --> 01:15:56.707]  We then had a very effective paramilitary organization called the Public Health Service, which I don't see working at all anymore.
[01:15:56.707 --> 01:16:09.709]  So instead, the military took over, became very efficient and very effective, and brought along with them Dr. Tony Fauci, who supersedes in capacity and capability Dr. Frieden, who should resign.
[01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:11.890]  The CDC should stand down.
[01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:17.431]  And now everyone should prepare their respective hospitals for the Ebola outbreak.
[01:16:17.931 --> 01:16:21.155]  The Ebola is a really nasty virus.
[01:16:21.155 --> 01:16:23.298]  Let me give you a comparison.
[01:16:23.298 --> 01:16:30.507]  On any unit of blood, there will be an HIV, about 10 million HIV viruses.
[01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:35.093]  In Ebola, in contrast, on that same unit of blood, you will have 10 billion.
[01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.058]  I think so.
[01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:49.399]  We're good to go.
[01:17:09.262 --> 01:17:28.906]  So what we have is an increasingly exponential epidemic that has to be prepared for, and the CDC was not prepared, was not able to contain it, and neither was, unfortunately, your hospitals in Dallas, which I was absolutely shocked, because of all the states in the Union, I would have assumed that Texas could have handled
[01:17:29.674 --> 01:17:34.818]  Well, everybody waited around for the CDC to tell them what to do.
[01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:41.483]  It shows how total federalization with this bureaucracy has just turned everybody into jellyfish.
[01:17:42.108 --> 01:17:52.936]  They've been at, well, honestly, with all... Well, CDC, everybody knows who has to deal with the CDC, was a totally ineffective, dysfunctional organization for 20 to 30 years.
[01:17:52.936 --> 01:17:57.120]  They are not the primary units that go into an epidemic.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.764]  The primary units that I would use would always be the military, the paramilitary units, the public health service.
[01:18:02.764 --> 01:18:07.848]  But the CDC was only a consulting body that basically could give information.
[01:18:08.328 --> 01:18:16.535]  To your local hospital, to your county, and your county commissioner or your governor could rescind that recommendation.
[01:18:16.535 --> 01:18:23.600]  And clearly Presbyterian Hospital was not prepared, nor were they helpful in assessing the situation.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.664]  Well, Dr. Pachetnik, I just read the default laws and regulations.
[01:18:28.664 --> 01:18:32.728]  Weren't they supposed to direct Ebola patients?
[01:18:33.871 --> 01:18:39.699]  To special quarantine, BioShield, federal facilities, where they now are starting to direct them?
[01:18:39.699 --> 01:18:41.741]  Why did they allow them into hospitals?
[01:18:43.068 --> 01:18:43.968]  I have no idea.
[01:18:43.968 --> 01:18:50.350]  They should have been evaluated a long time ago because this was an issue that's been around since 1976.
[01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:54.931]  We knew about the Ebola epidemic already over a year ago in Liberia.
[01:18:54.931 --> 01:19:00.893]  I've been waiting for it and that's why the military had been on standby and they went in there.
[01:19:00.893 --> 01:19:03.354]  But in fact, there are only four hospitals.
[01:19:03.354 --> 01:19:04.794]  One is in Missoula, Montana.
[01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:14.939]  Where I used to live in Montana and Bozeman, but those four hospitals did not contain the number of Ebola patients that will overwhelm the system.
[01:19:14.939 --> 01:19:23.364]  In terms of the preparatory status, it was the CDC that claimed every hospital was ready, and Obama claimed it, and that was false.
[01:19:23.444 --> 01:19:28.286]  So you're thinking, I'm about to skip this network break because this subject is so important.
[01:19:28.286 --> 01:19:30.547]  Doc, I mean, you believe Sandy Hook was staged.
[01:19:30.547 --> 01:19:32.208]  More and more experts have come out and agreed.
[01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:35.769]  The Boston bombing, you know, rigged.
[01:19:35.769 --> 01:19:36.789]  So many other events.
[01:19:36.789 --> 01:19:36.809]  9-11.
[01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:44.914]  The open funding of ISIS, changing the name from Al-Qaeda, all of this is coming out.
[01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:49.156]  But when you look at this Ebola situation, I'm not saying it's not ravaging Africa.
[01:19:49.156 --> 01:19:55.960]  I'm not saying it isn't, you know, living in the body longer before the symptoms show up, 21 days instead of three.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.902]  It's clearly mutating, getting stronger.
[01:19:58.902 --> 01:20:07.667]  But it just, I can't believe that this type of ineptitude to bring in Ebola patients, they never did that before, to let people fly in
[01:20:08.829 --> 01:20:13.511]  From West Africa, from ravaged areas when other countries had already banned it months ago.
[01:20:13.511 --> 01:20:24.276]  I mean, it appears that Ineptitude wouldn't be this precise at doing everything they could to grease the skids for Ebola.
[01:20:24.276 --> 01:20:31.780]  Are you getting any information on them allowing this to spread, to kind of bring in a medical tyranny, to create a political distraction?
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.921]  Are there any motives for this to be a false flag?
[01:20:34.949 --> 01:20:41.090]  No, not really, because number one, it is very hard to create an epidemic to create a false flag.
[01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:53.153]  Newtown was a false flag because Eric Holder had funded a very dysfunctional governor and a dysfunctional town and a bunch of Connecticut State Troopers who were just pathetic.
[01:20:53.153 --> 01:20:56.294]  And it was easy to create and the scenario was nonsense.
[01:20:56.294 --> 01:20:57.414]  This is somewhat different.
[01:20:57.907 --> 01:21:03.250]  We've seen Ebola and the Doctors Without Borders have been dealing with it for decades.
[01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:13.777]  The problem is that really the ineptitude and the fact that they're coming in from Liberia has more to do with money superseding the ability of the U.S.
[01:21:13.777 --> 01:21:15.558]  government to cease and desist.
[01:21:15.558 --> 01:21:18.560]  In other words, United Airlines refuses to stop flying.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.444]  In particular, Belgium and Air France stopped flying because they make money.
[01:21:23.444 --> 01:21:28.608]  They don't want to stop their planes from flying into Liberia and Sierra Leone.
[01:21:28.608 --> 01:21:30.870]  I would put a quarantine zone immediately.
[01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:33.272]  That's why I would hope that our U.S.
[01:21:33.272 --> 01:21:38.316]  military would impose what's called a quarantine or called Don't Send It Here.
[01:21:38.316 --> 01:21:47.083]  I really don't care at this point that Liberians come to the United States because any Liberian like Mr. Duncan is coming to the United States for only one purpose.
[01:21:47.543 --> 01:21:48.826]  That is medical care.
[01:21:48.826 --> 01:21:52.633]  He knew very well the minute he came in here that he was infected.
[01:21:53.007 --> 01:21:56.268]  And in turn, he didn't really care whether he infected everybody else.
[01:21:56.268 --> 01:22:00.589]  The notion that the exemptions don't come down to 21, that's absurd.
[01:22:00.589 --> 01:22:07.771]  And Frieden knows that's absurd, because this virus, like the AIDS virus, which, by the way, the CDC could not handle.
[01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:14.172]  That's why this is a history of incompetency on the behalf of HHS, CDC, the President.
[01:22:14.172 --> 01:22:19.314]  These are incompetent institutions that have been funded, and you're correct, you don't want to pay for them.
[01:22:19.314 --> 01:22:20.554]  They could not handle AIDS.
[01:22:21.094 --> 01:22:28.038]  Ebola, like AIDS, is an RNA virus which is highly dangerous and mutates very quickly.
[01:22:28.038 --> 01:22:32.741]  So immediately that we find a vaccine, like we did on AIDS, that will mutate.
[01:22:32.741 --> 01:22:40.906]  It'll change so rapidly that it took us years and Tony Fauci's National Institute of Infectious Diseases to be able to contain it.
[01:22:40.906 --> 01:22:44.989]  Now, having said all this, you can't create a massive panic.
[01:22:44.989 --> 01:22:48.951]  On the same hand, you can't use this for some type of political correctness.
[01:22:49.326 --> 01:22:50.887]  I would create a quarantine.
[01:22:50.887 --> 01:22:54.611]  I would not allow any flights from, let's say, Sierra Leone, Liberia.
[01:22:54.611 --> 01:22:57.633]  I would let our AFRICOM handle the situation there.
[01:22:57.633 --> 01:23:17.050]  I would close off all flights and then make sure all hospitals were prepared because we're now in the flu season, which means that everybody who's going to go into the hospital or the emergency room is going to come in with symptoms of fever, headaches, nausea, and the doctors have to be prepared as well as the nurses to know the difference between Ebola,
[01:23:17.512 --> 01:23:18.513]  Well, sure, sure.
[01:23:18.513 --> 01:23:22.017]  As a medical doctor, Dr. Pachanek, who's been all over the world and, you know, taught NBC type,
[01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:39.879]  Classes and things I know in the military, when you were in the military previously.
[01:23:39.879 --> 01:23:41.580]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:52.312]  I'm no epidemiologist, I'm not a virologist, but if you've got people flying who are infectious, if you've got other Africans being issued visas to come in here from West Africa...
[01:23:53.527 --> 01:24:02.618]  Undoubtedly, there are probably going to be hundreds of people now that end up coming down with Ebola, and if they don't immediately contain them, it'll be thousands.
[01:24:02.618 --> 01:24:07.384]  I think there's a pretty good chance we're going to end up with some type of epidemic.
[01:24:07.384 --> 01:24:10.067]  Do you disagree with that, or what's your gut tell you?
[01:24:10.447 --> 01:24:15.291]  We are in the incipient phases, the beginning phases of an epidemic.
[01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:18.593]  Remember, an epidemic means that it initiates at one point.
[01:24:18.593 --> 01:24:21.495]  It started with one man spread to two people.
[01:24:21.495 --> 01:24:23.396]  Then you have 130 on a plane.
[01:24:23.396 --> 01:24:26.058]  You have another couple of hundred on other planes.
[01:24:26.058 --> 01:24:28.520]  So this is going to be spread very quickly.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:36.466]  Now, if you were to ask me which city in the United States would have had an Ebola population, I would not have guessed Dallas.
[01:24:36.466 --> 01:24:37.547]  I would have said New York.
[01:24:38.127 --> 01:24:49.836]  Los Angeles, Chicago, and it wouldn't take very hard for me to place a Liberian or Sierra Leonean on a plane to go to any one of those cities and to create an epidemic of Ebola.
[01:24:49.836 --> 01:24:55.060]  So, the council offices and the State Department have to cease and desist giving visas.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.161]  I think there has to be a quarantine.
[01:24:57.161 --> 01:25:01.865]  The notion that customs officials can put up this nonsense temperature and gauge it
[01:25:02.205 --> 01:25:07.847]  And say that they don't have Ebola or that Ebola only comes out when there's a fever and they're sweating.
[01:25:07.847 --> 01:25:09.808]  That's absolute nonsense.
[01:25:09.808 --> 01:25:11.108]  It's an RNA virus.
[01:25:11.108 --> 01:25:13.549]  We know it transmits very quickly.
[01:25:13.549 --> 01:25:23.233]  And if Dr. Frieden knows differently and he says it differently, he has no idea of molecular biology, which he didn't know about in HIV, which is also an RNA virus.
[01:25:23.655 --> 01:25:30.017]  Sure, they said it was anti-gay to want to quarantine people in 1979, 1980, 81.
[01:25:30.017 --> 01:25:34.979]  If they would have done that, we wouldn't have millions of Americans dying from AIDS.
[01:25:34.979 --> 01:25:39.720]  Correct, and that was the fault of the CDC, and they had no idea what they were talking about.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:52.544]  And now we're against West Africans and we don't want Ebola, so I guess like we have bug chasers that want to get HIV, maybe to prove you're politically correct, maybe young women should go out and ask librarians to give them Ebola.
[01:25:53.683 --> 01:25:54.683]  No, no, no.
[01:25:54.683 --> 01:25:55.944]  Let's not get too fastidious.
[01:25:55.944 --> 01:25:58.104]  The issue is, it's really quite simple.
[01:25:58.104 --> 01:26:04.247]  We have an effective military, we have the right constitutionally to invoke quarantine at any point we want.
[01:26:04.247 --> 01:26:06.927]  We actually, in fact, did that, Alex.
[01:26:06.927 --> 01:26:17.511]  In the 1900s, when we had immigrants coming in from all over the world, we had the public health service, the military being able to sequester immigrants coming in, put them on Ellis Island,
[01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:18.415]  We're good.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.962]  Made total sense, but nowadays that would be called homophobic or racist.
[01:26:36.962 --> 01:26:39.703]  We should accept all of the Ebola patients.
[01:26:39.703 --> 01:26:43.465]  And if other countries are all banning people from West Africa, the U.S.
[01:26:43.465 --> 01:26:47.306]  will become the repository of everyone fleeing.
[01:26:47.306 --> 01:26:54.209]  And then I think it's a guarantee that we're going to get an Ebola pandemic out of the epidemic if this continues.
[01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:54.930]  How do you think
[01:26:56.013 --> 01:27:02.397]  The CDC and Obama and others are thinking they're going to get away with their clear stand down.
[01:27:02.397 --> 01:27:06.400]  Whether it was from incompetence or on purpose, it doesn't really matter.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.542]  It's criminal negligence in my view, Dr. Pachenik.
[01:27:09.542 --> 01:27:11.043]  I don't know what they're thinking.
[01:27:11.043 --> 01:27:19.949]  I mean, if you're right, that they're really this inept, and I've talked to senior Secret Service folks, I'll just leave it at that, that have been inside, not just Bongino, but other people.
[01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:24.372]  You know, in person, not over any telecommunications.
[01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:30.636]  And they tell me that they can't tell me what's going on in the White House, but they say it is over the top.
[01:27:30.636 --> 01:27:38.282]  And then they point out what that FBI agent said he saw in the White House when Clinton was there, and they said ten times worse than that.
[01:27:38.282 --> 01:27:41.724]  Well, the stuff that he brought out was over the top.
[01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:46.247]  I mean, it sounds to me like Obama and his controllers literally
[01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:53.070]  ...are watching SportsCenter and playing golf all day, and so who is running the country, Dr. Pachenik?
[01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:54.010]  No one.
[01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:55.451]  And I've said it from day one.
[01:27:55.451 --> 01:28:07.814]  Remember, when I first went on your show and I said there was going to be a stand-down in Newtown, that he didn't kill Osama Bin Laden because Bin Laden's been dead for 10 years, I questioned the credibility and the effectiveness of Obama.
[01:28:07.814 --> 01:28:16.217]  I still maintain that the man should never have been president, he's not qualified to be president, and he should resign, and we should have someone else take over.
[01:28:16.897 --> 01:28:19.439]  That issue is standing right now.
[01:28:19.439 --> 01:28:24.483]  It depends on the American public, on Congress, but we have had an ineffectual Congress.
[01:28:24.483 --> 01:28:25.383]  So what happened?
[01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:36.051]  In return, our military has the right and has appropriately acted to take over some of the functions that the President of the United States has mismanaged.
[01:28:36.051 --> 01:28:36.812]  ISIS.
[01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:44.598]  A complete creation of the CIA and our civilian capacity to create wars that we eventually fight against ourselves.
[01:28:45.134 --> 01:28:54.280]  I said it in a blog where we're now ending up where ISIS will end up in Baghdad although some of the military disagree with me they're on the outskirts of Baghdad.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.822]  It reminds me of 35 years ago when I was
[01:28:57.472 --> 01:28:58.172]  We're good to go.
[01:29:19.683 --> 01:29:23.705]  It's not just Obama who's incompetent, Bush Jr., Clinton.
[01:29:23.705 --> 01:29:28.147]  So the question is, what does America want and what is it willing to fight for?
[01:29:28.147 --> 01:29:41.253]  We can complain as much as we want, but from day one, when you and I got together 12 years ago, and I've always respected your courage, your bravery, and some of us call us, you know, the outlier, and I don't particularly care what they say.
[01:29:41.713 --> 01:29:44.235]  Everything you and I have said has come out true.
[01:29:44.235 --> 01:29:44.876]  It really has.
[01:29:44.876 --> 01:29:45.837]  Dr. Pchenik, stay there.
[01:29:45.837 --> 01:29:49.119]  I want to finish up on the economy, on North Korea and Russia.
[01:29:49.119 --> 01:29:50.220]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.742]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.742 --> 01:29:55.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.813 --> 01:30:09.479]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:09.479 --> 01:30:19.404]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:19.404 --> 01:30:22.326]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:22.526 --> 01:30:22.806]  I think?
[01:30:37.503 --> 01:30:37.743]  We're good.
[01:30:59.841 --> 01:31:01.163]  The experts are clear.
[01:31:01.163 --> 01:31:08.270]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:14.556]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:18.140]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.482]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:31:22.482 --> 01:31:27.805]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:31:27.805 --> 01:31:28.825]  Not our iodine.
[01:31:28.825 --> 01:31:32.627]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:31:32.627 --> 01:31:35.168]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:32:06.767 --> 01:32:11.890]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:13.371]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:15.993 --> 01:32:26.951]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.903]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:40.903 --> 01:32:42.704]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:42.704 --> 01:32:45.585]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:45.585 --> 01:32:49.666]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:32:54.908 --> 01:32:56.488]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:57.289]  Got it.
[01:32:57.289 --> 01:32:58.069]  Others don't.
[01:33:11.295 --> 01:33:18.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:36.190]  All I want is to have a safe and secure constitutional republic not overrun by criminal bureaucracies, agencies and foreign corporations that would suppress the free market and private property rights and religious rights and cultural rights because it gets in the way of their business models.
[01:33:37.401 --> 01:33:43.025]  We're looking at a worldwide fascist model using socialism to domesticate the population.
[01:33:43.025 --> 01:33:46.708]  That's the real political science angle.
[01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:51.031]  When you read Carol Quigley's books and other globalists, they admit that.
[01:33:51.031 --> 01:33:54.073]  They want totalitarianism.
[01:33:54.073 --> 01:33:56.355]  They don't want a free market.
[01:33:56.355 --> 01:33:57.696]  They don't want prosperity.
[01:33:57.696 --> 01:33:59.698]  They don't want you to be successful.
[01:33:59.698 --> 01:34:03.841]  They're the opposite of Americana, the opposite of Renaissance, the opposite of freedom.
[01:34:05.197 --> 01:34:15.464]  And Joel Gilbert, we were the number one seller of his last film that we still sell, Dreams of Obama's Real Father, that if you haven't seen it, it's just unbelievable.
[01:34:15.464 --> 01:34:19.227]  My parents said that it was one of the most powerful documentaries they ever saw.
[01:34:19.227 --> 01:34:27.833]  They thought it was preposterous what he was saying when they heard him on air, but my dad came by and got one of them and went home and watched it last year or two years ago when it came out and was blown away.
[01:34:27.833 --> 01:34:30.094]  Well, There's No Place Like Utopia is his new film.
[01:34:30.094 --> 01:34:32.316]  He had a successful theater run.
[01:34:32.316 --> 01:34:33.997]  It comes out officially next month.
[01:34:35.365 --> 01:34:38.907]  Right for the midterm elections, but we have it first in stock.
[01:34:38.907 --> 01:34:39.988]  Came in a few days ago.
[01:34:39.988 --> 01:34:41.688]  We are the exclusive.
[01:34:41.688 --> 01:34:42.589]  He just gave it to us.
[01:34:42.589 --> 01:34:43.269]  He said, you know what?
[01:34:43.269 --> 01:34:47.171]  You were such a big number one seller of it last time.
[01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:49.993]  I'm going to give it to you first to sell with pre-orders.
[01:34:50.799 --> 01:34:51.960]  But it's not a pre-order.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.000]  We're shipping it now.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.261]  We're authorized to.
[01:34:54.261 --> 01:34:55.601]  He's on next week.
[01:34:55.601 --> 01:34:57.883]  So there's no place like Utopia.
[01:34:57.883 --> 01:35:04.126]  On the cover it's got Obama looking at the public with an American flag in his hand and a hammer and sickle to his back.
[01:35:04.126 --> 01:35:11.229]  And it's great to show young people, great to show progressives, great to show mainline conservatives, libertarians.
[01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:17.873]  It's kind of like Dinesh D'Souza's new film that they put him in prison over or basically arrested him over.
[01:35:17.873 --> 01:35:19.534]  He's in a halfway house right now.
[01:35:20.899 --> 01:35:24.021]  But it's much more hardcore, and it needs to be seen.
[01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:28.144]  So it's available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:28.144 --> 01:35:34.308]  And we're not like NPR that gets 400-plus million of taxpayer money a year and then begs for money locally.
[01:35:34.308 --> 01:35:38.991]  We just sell high-quality products, films, books, t-shirts, supplements, water filtration systems.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.903]  Made in America knives, stuff that I like, stuff I use.
[01:35:44.903 --> 01:35:50.867]  I mean, I'll go out and use a little cook stove that I buy for camping and I'll go, I really like this cook stove.
[01:35:50.867 --> 01:35:54.990]  Buy 5,000 of them and we can sell it at the lowest price out there.
[01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:57.091]  Or I like this dash cam.
[01:35:57.091 --> 01:36:03.796]  Get us a deal with these and buy 10,000 of them and get me the lowest price available and we'll even undercut Amazon.
[01:36:03.796 --> 01:36:07.918]  That's what you've got at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:07.918 --> 01:36:08.779]  It's true free market.
[01:36:10.256 --> 01:36:15.118]  That's why we're able to sell you this film first, because we sold the most of it.
[01:36:15.118 --> 01:36:16.358]  Yeah, where's Amazon right now?
[01:36:16.358 --> 01:36:22.200]  Sorry, unable to have it, because we're even defeating them in our own little microcosm with the free market.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.741]  It's a wondrous thing.
[01:36:23.741 --> 01:36:29.803]  So get There's No Place Like Utopia, a Joel Gilbert film, available at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:29.803 --> 01:36:31.963]  And a subdivision of InfoWarsStore.com is InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:37.438 --> 01:36:52.571]  We have the DNA force that Dr. Group and others say with the CoQ10 systematic enzymes and the astrologist's route and the bio-enhanced palm granite extract, Tibetan
[01:36:53.831 --> 01:36:57.213]  Extracts, just a whole bunch of key things in there.
[01:36:57.213 --> 01:37:02.375]  Veganzyme, BioPQQ, the true organic sources of this.
[01:37:02.375 --> 01:37:09.558]  We can even make claims about this stuff, but it's all been vetted by the lawyers and the rest of it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:09.558 --> 01:37:16.202]  What's patented, trademarked, certified, proven in DNA Force, a true nutraceutical.
[01:37:16.202 --> 01:37:21.164]  What it does for the telomeres, what it does for the mitochondrial DNA.
[01:37:22.592 --> 01:37:25.615]  What it does for everything and the immune system.
[01:37:25.615 --> 01:37:31.822]  DNA force isn't the only place I stop for my immune system and bolstering my natural defenses.
[01:37:31.822 --> 01:37:35.806]  We have the X2 true deep earth crystal source that nobody else has.
[01:37:35.806 --> 01:37:40.130]  Nascent iodine that just supercharges my body across the board.
[01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:42.573]  So many people are deficient.
[01:37:42.573 --> 01:37:45.576]  The FDA has lowered what the allowance is to almost nothing.
[01:37:45.976 --> 01:37:48.537]  Well, I take Survival Shield three times a day.
[01:37:48.537 --> 01:37:49.818]  Super male vitality.
[01:37:49.818 --> 01:37:51.739]  Super female vitality.
[01:37:51.739 --> 01:37:53.400]  The lung cleanse.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.963]  Other herbal stuff for the throat and lungs is just watery crud, folks.
[01:37:58.963 --> 01:38:00.384]  This is like thick oil.
[01:38:01.288 --> 01:38:06.912]  The only problem is you've got to clean out the spray bottle top sometimes after you've been using it because it's so thick.
[01:38:06.912 --> 01:38:18.901]  It aerosolizes really good when it's new, but you've got to clean it out because it's just a whole bunch of organic concentrated herbs that are known for your health and known for cleansing and known for the immune system.
[01:38:18.901 --> 01:38:19.942]  So get the Lung Cleanse.

[01:38:22.404 --> 01:38:23.625]  Great for singers.

[01:39:29.818 --> 01:39:33.080]  All right, Dr. Pachinick, again, thank you for joining us.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:40.544]  We're going to tweet your website out again right now at Real Alex Jones for folks to get the inside take from your perspective on what's happening.
[01:39:40.544 --> 01:39:44.487]  In the 12 minutes we've got left before break, I want to give you the floor.
[01:39:45.367 --> 01:39:49.971]  To break down more on ISIS, where Obama's going.
[01:39:49.971 --> 01:39:51.452]  We are seeing a global awakening.
[01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:53.074]  Is it happening fast enough?
[01:39:53.074 --> 01:39:56.597]  What do you think the political class is going to do?
[01:39:56.597 --> 01:39:58.358]  What's happening with Russia?
[01:39:58.358 --> 01:40:02.782]  What's happening with the runs on the stock markets worldwide?
[01:40:02.782 --> 01:40:04.864]  With the implosion on the U.S.
[01:40:04.864 --> 01:40:06.245]  Treasuries?
[01:40:06.245 --> 01:40:08.167]  What is this signifying, Dr. Pachinik?
[01:40:09.326 --> 01:40:25.689]  Well, let me just say, thank you for the opportunity, let me just say the good news is that our intelligence and military apparatus has effectively run a very effective and sophisticated economic warfare against Russia.
[01:40:25.689 --> 01:40:37.732]  And what was done was basically we lowered the value of the ruble by 30 to 40 percent, we decreased Russia's bond rating, and now that the price of oil was literally
[01:40:38.562 --> 01:40:39.102]  I think so.
[01:41:01.314 --> 01:41:10.099]  From an economic, from a battle point of view, we've really created a new kind of warfare which has been very effective, and that's economic warfare.
[01:41:10.099 --> 01:41:18.944]  And you can thank the military and the intelligence community for effectively running it for well over a year and quietly succeeding.
[01:41:18.944 --> 01:41:20.645]  And Putin has nothing.
[01:41:20.645 --> 01:41:27.089]  He is basically now very vulnerable to being taken over where there's possibly another KGB putsch.
[01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:35.473]  In the Kremlin or FSB or whoever might be there, but basically Putin has failed, Russia has failed.
[01:41:35.473 --> 01:41:40.540]  And commonly, China is a very serious economic problem.
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:42.183]  And what you're seeing in Hong Kong,
[01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:54.372]  It's that China has lowered its growth rate, which was absolutely evaluated at a very high number at 6 to 7 percent normally or 12 percent.
[01:41:54.372 --> 01:42:01.660]  So basically what it is right now, 3 percent, which in effect for 1.5 billion people means that there's no growth in China.
[01:42:02.327 --> 01:42:24.299]  And China has a very serious problem where they now have spent hundreds of billions of dollars and I think President Xi has made a very serious mistake economically to invest that hundred billion into basically four banks which will fund a very speculative real estate market in China which is about to collapse.
[01:42:24.299 --> 01:42:28.361]  So China is now in a deflationary, in a depressive mood.
[01:42:29.184 --> 01:42:33.866]  Russia is in a depressive mood and now we get to the issue of what you have always said.
[01:42:33.866 --> 01:42:37.128]  We've talked about socialism does not work.
[01:42:37.128 --> 01:42:49.013]  Proof of the pudding is EU is completely deflated and heading into a serious economic depression and hopefully, from my point of view, will break up.
[01:42:49.013 --> 01:42:55.616]  EU was never intended to be coagulated into one unit or deflated into one unit.
[01:42:56.024 --> 01:43:09.891]  Because it was a very poor attempt by France to control the German economy, and the Germans, as usual, came out of this economic malaise with force, figure, and technology, and therefore France
[01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:10.878]  I think?
[01:43:30.987 --> 01:43:37.911]  France and the rest of the European countries have a very serious unemployment rate, collectively, of over 25%.
[01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:41.833]  And the ages between 15, 28 and 29, that's the working ages, and they cannot provide work.
[01:43:47.353 --> 01:43:59.443]  Socialism and the health care system have not been effective in all of Europe and therefore each country now has to decide whether they want to abide by the austerity plan or not.
[01:43:59.443 --> 01:44:05.227]  My suspicion is that eventually unemployment will be the key factor for the breakup of Europe.
[01:44:05.227 --> 01:44:07.309]  There was no reason to have a supra-economic
[01:44:08.015 --> 01:44:08.736]  I think so.
[01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:42.559]  The most important thing that happened from an economic point of view that was good news on behalf of America was something that was not covered and that was one of the tankers that came out of Texas, your great state, was the Singaporean tanker
[01:44:43.322 --> 01:44:44.142]  We're good to go.
[01:45:12.154 --> 01:45:15.657]  All countries in the world, so we are self-sufficient.
[01:45:15.657 --> 01:45:24.164]  Economically, even though we don't look as if we're doing well right now, we will rebound for the simple reason that you and I have always said.
[01:45:24.164 --> 01:45:28.308]  We are an entrepreneurial country where we can turn around on a dime.
[01:45:28.308 --> 01:45:31.911]  We can create a business in four days or four hours.
[01:45:31.911 --> 01:45:39.097]  And as you said, even though we have to pay the taxes or we can avoid the taxes, we know how to create businesses, which is very
[01:45:39.767 --> 01:45:40.348]  We're good to go.
[01:45:58.187 --> 01:46:03.111]  Oil and gas and energy will no longer be the primary drivers of our economy.
[01:46:03.111 --> 01:46:13.297]  It will probably be the game changers like innovation, e-systems or anything dealing with the internet and information capacity.
[01:46:13.297 --> 01:46:18.001]  Alright, let me just stop you for just a moment because oil exploration is at all-time highs here in the U.S.
[01:46:18.001 --> 01:46:21.603]  As you know, we're the number one producer and exporter now in the world.
[01:46:21.603 --> 01:46:23.764]  That only seems to be gearing up, so I don't...
[01:46:24.815 --> 01:46:30.056]  I don't understand your perspective there on that won't be central anymore.
[01:46:30.056 --> 01:46:31.857]  It looks to me like it's getting more central.
[01:46:31.857 --> 01:46:32.997]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[01:46:32.997 --> 01:46:35.558]  I know that we're on the cutting edge of technology.
[01:46:35.558 --> 01:46:40.059]  But it's the overall point that we're doing well, we're doing good.
[01:46:40.059 --> 01:46:43.760]  I get that China is a criminal, psychopathic group that's running it.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.961]  I get that Russia is a bunch of failed mobsters running it.
[01:46:47.341 --> 01:46:56.015]  But it doesn't mean that I agree with George Soros, you know, in there overthrowing Ukraine and starting stuff with Russia to then force it into an implosion.
[01:46:56.015 --> 01:46:59.600]  It's the worldview that we do well and everybody else does bad.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:02.104]  I'd buy into that maybe.
[01:47:03.145 --> 01:47:05.307]  At least intellectually, I would understand it.
[01:47:05.307 --> 01:47:16.178]  If they weren't trying to shut down the free market here, jack up taxes here, I would get a predatory view if the super predators didn't prey on us.
[01:47:16.178 --> 01:47:19.201]  So I don't even buy into there's three power blocks.
[01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:20.242]  It's more like globalists.
[01:47:21.306 --> 01:47:29.550]  feeding and manipulating like chaos or specter over the whole operation and I see America losing the moral high ground.
[01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:37.734]  I mean, I see our military saying no to Obama wanting to back Al-Qaeda openly in Syria, but they still ends up happening just by changing the name.
[01:47:37.734 --> 01:47:46.059]  So, whereas I do see a lot of virtue in the military compared to the general public who doesn't even know what planet they're on, I see, you know, our salvation and destruction.
[01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:48.300]  The seeds are both there.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.540]  So I get your perspective.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:50.321]  They're trying to
[01:47:51.621 --> 01:47:52.341]  Help U.S.
[01:47:52.341 --> 01:47:56.463]  interests by doing all these things, and it does end up helping us to a certain extent.
[01:47:56.463 --> 01:47:57.484]  At least it did in the past.
[01:47:57.484 --> 01:47:59.565]  These were policies for the American people.
[01:47:59.565 --> 01:48:07.208]  Now, I see different elements working against each other, more than ever, within the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:48:07.208 --> 01:48:13.551]  That's what I'm trying to get at, Dr. Pachenik, is that I see America becoming just as immoral as the Russians or the Chinese.
[01:48:14.735 --> 01:48:18.836]  Well, morality was never a key issue in foreign policy.
[01:48:18.836 --> 01:48:26.618]  What has been the key issue of foreign policy to the United States, Alex, has always been, we're not interested in friends or enemies.
[01:48:26.618 --> 01:48:28.119]  It's what our interests are.
[01:48:28.119 --> 01:48:31.080]  What are the American interests at this particular time?
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.641]  No, I know, but a lot of what our so-called government does flies in the face of our interests.
[01:48:35.641 --> 01:48:39.902]  Well, our American interests have nothing to do with the Middle East.
[01:48:39.902 --> 01:48:43.463]  We've been pulling out of the Middle East, and we have been shifting
[01:48:44.587 --> 01:48:50.471]  Okay, well let me tell you this then.
[01:48:50.471 --> 01:48:53.112]  Talk to us like we're five years old.
[01:48:53.112 --> 01:48:56.154]  I know you've been on the inside.
[01:48:56.154 --> 01:48:57.915]  What are the power blocks in the U.S.
[01:48:57.915 --> 01:48:58.655]  right now?
[01:48:58.655 --> 01:48:59.776]  Who's dominant?
[01:48:59.776 --> 01:49:02.618]  Because I see a lot of tug-of-war going on over the levers of power.
[01:49:02.618 --> 01:49:06.140]  That's why I think Obama's paralyzed.
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.420]  Correct me if you think I'm wrong.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.301]  What are the power blocks?
[01:49:09.912 --> 01:49:16.955]  The power blocks are not the Council on Foreign Relations or the Atlantic Council or all the things that people think about.
[01:49:16.955 --> 01:49:23.818]  The real power blocks in the United States are the same power blocks that Stalin said came out of a gun.
[01:49:23.818 --> 01:49:29.141]  Whatever comes out of a gun, that firepower, is what consists of power.
[01:49:29.141 --> 01:49:36.084]  The firepower that we have in the American military and its capability to stand over 220 countries, 730 bases, is very formidable.
[01:49:39.443 --> 01:49:49.167]  Our capability to assess that intelligence capability, be it failures, and I'm the first one to even complain about it, is quite formidable.
[01:49:49.167 --> 01:49:53.528]  Those are the two major sui generis power blocks.
[01:49:53.528 --> 01:49:56.669]  The President of the United States is not relevant.
[01:49:56.669 --> 01:49:58.070]  Absolutely irrelevant.
[01:49:58.070 --> 01:50:01.071]  Has been irrelevant for the past 30 years.
[01:50:01.071 --> 01:50:06.353]  Because the devolution of power, thanks to you and others, has come to the governors.
[01:50:06.903 --> 01:50:11.084]  The governors of every state have become more and more important.
[01:50:11.084 --> 01:50:13.685]  And they have to start exercising their power.
[01:50:13.685 --> 01:50:19.906]  That's correct, but you have to choose governors who've had experience in managing a huge system.
[01:50:19.906 --> 01:50:21.167]  We didn't choose that.
[01:50:21.167 --> 01:50:25.448]  We didn't choose a president who knew how to manage large systems.
[01:50:25.448 --> 01:50:34.570]  We've chosen presidents who've gone on television with this Mickey Mouse show and have had no experience whatsoever, all the way back to Obama, Bush,
[01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:39.614]  Well, we do see the military brass more and more not following the orders of the president.
[01:50:39.614 --> 01:50:41.135]  That is unprecedented.
[01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:46.319]  I want to end up on that with you on the other side, see if you agree with that or where you see that going.
[01:50:46.319 --> 01:50:54.886]  I mean, we've had Dempsey telling the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee that he's full of it, telling Obama he's wrong.
[01:50:54.886 --> 01:50:56.167]  That is wild.
[01:50:56.167 --> 01:50:56.788]  We'll be right back.

[01:51:15.956 --> 01:51:19.399]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:19.399 --> 01:51:21.080]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.022]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:23.022 --> 01:51:28.867]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:28.867 --> 01:51:29.707]  I know, right?
[01:51:29.707 --> 01:51:31.008]  You love it, too!
[01:51:31.008 --> 01:51:32.450]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:33.490]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:35.232]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:35.232 --> 01:51:35.572]  That's 877-886-3653.

[01:51:44.099 --> 01:51:46.441]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:46.441 --> 01:51:51.144]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:56.087 --> 01:52:02.372]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:52:02.372 --> 01:52:07.255]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:52:07.335 --> 01:52:07.615]  We're good.
[01:52:28.573 --> 01:52:39.095]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:52:39.095 --> 01:52:45.376]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:52:45.376 --> 01:52:47.876]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:52:47.876 --> 01:52:50.957]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[01:52:50.957 --> 01:52:57.798]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:52:58.138 --> 01:53:02.105]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[01:53:02.105 --> 01:53:07.635]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[01:53:07.635 --> 01:53:09.999]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[01:53:12.824 --> 01:53:17.106]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[01:53:17.106 --> 01:53:19.227]  Do you even have a plan B?
[01:53:19.227 --> 01:53:22.509]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[01:53:22.509 --> 01:53:23.769]  Children left with no home.
[01:53:23.769 --> 01:53:25.590]  And no one's coming to help them.
[01:53:25.590 --> 01:53:28.432]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[01:53:28.632 --> 01:53:28.892]  I think so.
[01:54:12.728 --> 01:54:15.310]  Here's what I'm trying to get across to listeners.
[01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:17.712]  I grew up in a house where we read history books.
[01:54:17.712 --> 01:54:21.115]  We were into what had happened in the world.
[01:54:21.115 --> 01:54:24.759]  I learned that history was incredibly exciting.
[01:54:24.759 --> 01:54:26.560]  Studying government was incredibly exciting.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.102]  Studying military history was incredibly exciting.
[01:54:29.102 --> 01:54:30.444]  And I'm not even that smart of a person.
[01:54:31.408 --> 01:54:36.331]  Then I realized the general public does not even know the three branches of government on average.
[01:54:36.331 --> 01:54:41.835]  People are getting more and more disconnected, but they don't trust the system at the same time.
[01:54:41.835 --> 01:54:43.596]  But they're still like fish out of water.
[01:54:43.596 --> 01:54:45.818]  They're so ignorant.
[01:54:45.818 --> 01:54:52.603]  So you've got a political class that's been feeding on that and getting away with bloody murder.
[01:54:53.812 --> 01:54:58.133]  But also smoking their own dope and becoming incompetent themselves.
[01:54:58.133 --> 01:55:05.174]  You can't have that in an age of nuclear weapons and drones and flesh-eating bacteria and Ebola.
[01:55:05.174 --> 01:55:14.716]  And I just hope that this political elite hits the panic button and pulls up.
[01:55:14.716 --> 01:55:19.317]  You know, Dr. Petrini can say, well, there's nothing really moral in geopolitics.
[01:55:19.317 --> 01:55:21.317]  Well, I get the Machiavellian view.
[01:55:22.694 --> 01:55:27.636]  But at a certain point, if you don't have moral authority, you don't have anything.
[01:55:27.636 --> 01:55:32.638]  I don't even buy into the Machiavellian view, and I'm not accusing you, Doc, of being Machiavellian.
[01:55:32.638 --> 01:55:35.079]  I think that, you know, true moral high ground is the way to go.
[01:55:35.079 --> 01:55:36.459]  It creates prosperity.
[01:55:36.459 --> 01:55:37.480]  It creates security.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.300]  History shows that.
[01:55:40.345 --> 01:55:43.246]  I see the military as the most awake group.
[01:55:43.246 --> 01:55:48.347]  I don't lionize the military when it's involved as an instrument of evil in many cases.
[01:55:48.347 --> 01:55:55.908]  I just have studied things and found it is one of the only large reservoirs of people that are dedicated and listen to me.
[01:55:55.908 --> 01:56:06.330]  So I don't get the paradox of the military doing all these evil deeds for the globalists, sometimes doing good, but then loving me, showing that they do support the Second Amendment and so many things.
[01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:18.717]  And it's clear there's a power struggle going on and I see the military more and more not being belligerent but disagreeing with the worst political pimps like Senator Graham and Obama.
[01:56:18.717 --> 01:56:25.901]  Briefly putting bookends on it, where is the military right now stacked up against the rest of the power structure?
[01:56:26.732 --> 01:56:28.615]  The military has stood its ground.
[01:56:28.615 --> 01:56:41.814]  Dennis Clapper, the DNI, Director of National Intelligence, has refused to resign and I'm glad that because even after Obama accused him and the rest of the intelligence community of being a failure, which of course was absurd,
[01:56:42.654 --> 01:56:45.076]  In fact, we're briefing Obama.
[01:56:45.076 --> 01:56:47.518]  The military will stand up to their duty.
[01:56:47.518 --> 01:56:48.779]  That's our military.
[01:56:48.779 --> 01:56:50.561]  They believe in country.
[01:56:50.561 --> 01:56:51.622]  They believe in honor.
[01:56:51.622 --> 01:56:53.403]  They don't do that for money.
[01:56:53.403 --> 01:56:54.544]  They're not mercenary.
[01:56:54.544 --> 01:56:56.146]  This is not Blackwater.
[01:56:56.146 --> 01:56:59.769]  But you always have to remember, Alex, and your audience has to understand,
[01:57:00.458 --> 01:57:06.220]  Democracy is always, there's a tension between the repression inherent in the republic.
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:11.982]  We're a republic, not a democracy, and those of us who protest against it and serve it.
[01:57:11.982 --> 01:57:17.104]  So we have a constant tension and paradox between two elements of our republic.
[01:57:17.104 --> 01:57:20.065]  That's been true since the founding of our fathers.
[01:57:20.065 --> 01:57:21.386]  They had to have money.
[01:57:21.386 --> 01:57:23.447]  They had to fight against Congress.
[01:57:23.447 --> 01:57:24.667]  They had to fight against
[01:57:25.225 --> 01:57:25.626]  I don't know.
[01:57:35.666 --> 01:57:39.648]  Being, you know, subservient to any political group.
[01:57:39.648 --> 01:57:45.910]  If you think a political group can dominate the United States, be it the President or anybody else, I think that's over.
[01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:46.870]  No, I know, I know.
[01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:50.492]  I mean, the Iraqis fighting back the military couldn't even handle them.
[01:57:50.492 --> 01:57:54.033]  If the American people ever realized the power they have, this could all end very quickly.
[01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:55.814]  I think that's where the answer lies.
[01:57:55.814 --> 01:58:01.276]  How do we get the spirit of the American people to wake up again and start acting like free people?
[01:58:02.085 --> 01:58:10.794]  I think the spirit comes in from people like you and others who caution them and encourage them to get involved in local politics.
[01:58:10.794 --> 01:58:17.621]  Nothing is more effective than grassroots politics, be it in Dallas or be it in El Paso.
[01:58:17.621 --> 01:58:22.867]  When you vote for a city commissioner or a county commissioner, you're beginning to affect
[01:58:23.107 --> 01:58:29.271]  Oh yeah, we have a super patriot, a liberty lover, who's the frontrunner for City Council right now, Dr. Laura Presley.
[01:58:29.271 --> 01:58:30.392]  I'm seeing it all over the country.
[01:58:30.392 --> 01:58:32.233]  Dr. Pachinik, thanks for the hour.
[01:58:32.233 --> 01:58:33.374]  StevePachinik.com.
[01:58:33.374 --> 01:58:34.675]  Very interesting perspective.
[01:58:34.675 --> 01:58:35.355]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:35.355 --> 01:58:42.180]  And we got Max Keiser on the economy coming up.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:46.143]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.679 --> 01:58:50.940]  Another major health threat.
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:55.922]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:58:55.922 --> 01:58:58.583]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:58:58.583 --> 01:59:05.626]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:05.626 --> 01:59:08.647]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:08.647 --> 01:59:11.648]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:11.648 --> 01:59:13.589]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:16.430]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:22.253]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:22.253 --> 01:59:25.756]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:25.756 --> 01:59:28.857]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:28.857 --> 01:59:33.120]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:36.142]  For every modern independently minded household.
[01:59:36.142 --> 01:59:39.365]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:47.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.526 --> 02:00:10.372]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.372 --> 02:00:11.954]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.954 --> 02:00:13.496]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.496 --> 02:00:17.702]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.702 --> 02:00:21.767]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.502 --> 02:00:47.564]  We got Max Keiser joining us, coming up to give us his take on what's happening in the bond market, what's happening with gold.
[02:00:47.564 --> 02:00:59.187]  As the world economy melts down, gold will go up, even as other commodities go down, because it's an ultimate store of wealth and a hedge against imploding economies, and it is up.
[02:00:59.187 --> 02:01:04.988]  When I heard that bond markets had imploded, and the stock market was down so much today, I thought, man, I bet gold goes down.
[02:01:04.988 --> 02:01:07.089]  I said this aloud, but I said, or maybe it'll go up.
[02:01:08.086 --> 02:01:11.451]  Because when I saw that oil was way down, I thought, man, I wonder.
[02:01:11.451 --> 02:01:17.119]  But man, when I saw gold going up, that's pretty serious right there.
[02:01:17.119 --> 02:01:24.089]  The London Guardian reports accounting for drugs and prostitution to help push UK economy up by 65 billion pounds.
[02:01:27.053 --> 02:01:27.814]  65 billion pounds.
[02:01:27.814 --> 02:01:30.756]  That's over a hundred billion US dollars.
[02:01:30.756 --> 02:01:37.302]  A more inclusive approach to GDP comes into force in September to comply with EU rules on measuring the economy.
[02:01:37.302 --> 02:01:40.765]  But they've legalized the prostitution basically EU-wide.
[02:01:40.765 --> 02:01:44.589]  And of course they make women that are out of work more than a year in Germany.
[02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:47.532]  They call them in and assess them and say, you're good-looking.
[02:01:47.532 --> 02:01:48.192]  Hit the bricks.
[02:01:48.192 --> 02:01:49.814]  We've got a woman going to teach you how to hook.
[02:01:49.814 --> 02:01:50.855]  Here's your female pimp.
[02:01:51.832 --> 02:01:53.373]  You think I'm joking?
[02:01:53.373 --> 02:01:55.355]  That's like Der Spiegel two years ago.
[02:01:55.355 --> 02:02:02.240]  I remember seeing that headline on Drudge like two years ago and going, no, they're not making women hit the bricks.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:07.925]  And yeah, folks, they make the women streetwalk in Germany.
[02:02:07.925 --> 02:02:11.607]  And even tell them what a full day's work is so they can pay those taxes.
[02:02:11.607 --> 02:02:15.510]  Man, you gotta love socialism, don't you?
[02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:17.552]  Oh my God, that is incredible.
[02:02:17.552 --> 02:02:19.834]  The Roman Empire and its decline made women hook.
[02:02:22.014 --> 02:02:23.899]  Oh, just amazing.
[02:02:23.899 --> 02:02:25.142]  That's feminism for you.
[02:02:25.142 --> 02:02:26.485]  It really empowers women, doesn't it?
[02:02:28.519 --> 02:02:31.580]  I don't mean, I didn't mean to get off on a jag.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:34.281]  It's just that stuff is getting so weird.
[02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:34.801]  Look at this.
[02:02:34.801 --> 02:02:35.181]  U.S.
[02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:40.362]  troops assisting an Ebola mission may be quarantined in an unprecedented move to protect U.S.
[02:02:40.362 --> 02:02:42.543]  troops that might be exposed to Ebola.
[02:02:42.543 --> 02:02:42.763]  U.S.
[02:02:42.763 --> 02:02:51.045]  military commanders are being given the authority to quarantine troops for 21 days at a Department of Defense facility where they will be monitored for signs of the disease.
[02:02:51.045 --> 02:02:53.165]  Well, that's where people with Ebola are supposed to go.
[02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:54.046]  But see, they won't do that.
[02:02:54.046 --> 02:02:55.306]  They'll send them to a regular hospital.
[02:02:57.335 --> 02:02:59.275]  You know, I don't agree with Pachinko on everything.
[02:02:59.275 --> 02:03:13.558]  I don't think he's a bad guy overall, but he's so inside the system that, you're probably listening right now, that he has a tinge of Machiavellian mindset, where you make the decision, well, we're the good guys, we can do whatever we want.
[02:03:13.558 --> 02:03:22.120]  Well, I won't put words in his mouth, but putting the troops in, at a certain point, you've got to just let Africa do what Africa wants.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.220]  If those countries want to fight each other, let them kill each other.
[02:03:25.663 --> 02:03:27.565]  If they're going to spread Ebola, let's spread Ebola.
[02:03:27.565 --> 02:03:34.231]  How about we shut off the flights and just let Africa, like Ron Paul says, do what it wants?
[02:03:34.231 --> 02:03:44.340]  I got a sneaking suspicion, if colonial powers hadn't been meddling in Africa for 550-something years, that Africa would be a lot better.
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:49.245]  Look at what Libya did, building up areas of Africa and then the West went in and blew it up.
[02:03:50.404 --> 02:03:51.885]  Put Al-Qaeda in charge.
[02:03:51.885 --> 02:03:53.265]  And Pucinich was against that.
[02:03:53.265 --> 02:03:55.506]  And Pucinich's against funding ISIS.
[02:03:55.506 --> 02:04:03.829]  So they'll sit there and say, oh, the CIA funded ISIS and funded all these groups and, you know, it's, it's, uh, and I'm not covering what Pucinich said now that he's gone.
[02:04:03.829 --> 02:04:07.970]  I just let him talk, so whenever we got to these points, maybe next time he's on we can discuss it.
[02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:15.113]  It's just this schizophrenic thing where the system has the CIA creating Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and then the army goes and fights them.
[02:04:18.826 --> 02:04:24.231]  And yeah, the army legitimately goes and fights them, but... So you can say, well, they're the good guys.
[02:04:24.231 --> 02:04:31.218]  But then you've got the CIA creating them, when the whole thing's working in tandem.
[02:04:31.218 --> 02:04:40.826]  And then we have a CIA that went, probably hired private hitmen, to double-cap Gary Webb.
[02:04:40.826 --> 02:04:43.409]  Because he exposed the government was shipping the drugs in.
[02:04:44.912 --> 02:04:47.375]  I mean, come on, you got a drug war and you're shipping the stuff in?
[02:04:47.375 --> 02:04:48.416]  No!
[02:04:48.416 --> 02:04:50.539]  That is super immoral!
[02:04:50.539 --> 02:04:53.923]  You know how many people I know whose lives have been ruined by the drugs the government shipped in?
[02:04:53.923 --> 02:04:57.368]  And then they're ruining our Bill of Rights with the drug war?
[02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:03.393]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.393 --> 02:05:07.676]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.676 --> 02:05:09.457]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.457 --> 02:05:17.303]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.303 --> 02:05:18.444]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:25.089]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:25.089 --> 02:05:27.911]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:29.298 --> 02:05:32.820]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:41.065]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:41.065 --> 02:05:46.488]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:46.488 --> 02:05:49.010]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:51.111]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:01.877 --> 02:06:05.540]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:06.360]  Security alert.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.601]  Security alert.
[02:06:07.601 --> 02:06:09.603]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:09.603 --> 02:06:10.503]  Analysis.
[02:06:10.503 --> 02:06:11.204]  InfoWars.
[02:06:11.204 --> 02:06:13.165]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:18.189]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:19.229]  Crime Directive.
[02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:20.750]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:23.632]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:23.632 --> 02:06:26.875]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:26.875 --> 02:06:29.176]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:29.176 --> 02:06:29.897]  These people are a
[02:06:30.097 --> 02:06:37.722]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[02:06:37.722 --> 02:06:42.186]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[02:06:59.110 --> 02:07:00.431]  The experts are clear.
[02:07:00.431 --> 02:07:07.556]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:07:07.556 --> 02:07:13.820]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:17.423]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:07:17.543 --> 02:07:21.765]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:07:21.765 --> 02:07:27.087]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:07:27.087 --> 02:07:28.087]  Not our iodine.
[02:07:28.087 --> 02:07:31.909]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:07:31.909 --> 02:07:34.430]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:45.154 --> 02:07:46.635]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:07:46.635 --> 02:07:49.817]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:08:12.512 --> 02:08:20.819]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.819 --> 02:08:26.463]  That was Dr. Henry Kissinger bringing us in, talking about the non-existent New World Order.
[02:08:26.463 --> 02:08:40.435]  I wanted to get Max Keiser on, he's on for an hour next week, and I want him to still join us if he can, but he's on with us until the bottom of the hour now, then we're going to talk to an expert on gold, about why it's going up, but...
[02:08:41.576 --> 02:08:43.017]  I don't have the crew or the staff to do it.
[02:08:43.017 --> 02:08:45.259]  I have a wonderful crew that runs the show live.
[02:08:45.259 --> 02:08:46.680]  You, the listeners, heard it and saw it.
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:49.262]  It was last year.
[02:08:49.262 --> 02:08:56.948]  Max predicted, his big prediction, that by the middle of 2014, you'd see an implosion of the U.S.
[02:08:56.948 --> 02:08:57.749]  Treasury market.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:00.761]  Well, here's the headline.
[02:09:00.761 --> 02:09:03.463]  He missed his prediction, but better late than never.
[02:09:03.463 --> 02:09:04.323]  He said by the middle.
[02:09:04.323 --> 02:09:08.366]  This is the latter part, but not by much.
[02:09:08.366 --> 02:09:13.569]  I guess you could say nine months in is the middle, but it's kind of the end of the middle.
[02:09:13.569 --> 02:09:15.951]  Bull run for the exit.
[02:09:15.951 --> 02:09:17.612]  Financial Times of London.
[02:09:17.612 --> 02:09:21.874]  Rising concerns about the global economy triggered a flash crash in U.S.
[02:09:21.874 --> 02:09:24.216]  Treasury yields on Wednesday, yesterday.
[02:09:25.754 --> 02:09:35.504]  As losses spread across stock markets and the new wave of investors appeared to give up on their bullish bets, the yield of the 10-year Treasury, a key barometer of the strength of the U.S.
[02:09:35.504 --> 02:09:42.811]  economy, fell below 2% for the first time after the Federal Reserve began talking about removing QE Unlimited.
[02:09:42.811 --> 02:09:44.893]  They call it QE stimulus here.
[02:09:47.444 --> 02:09:57.072]  And with more of that data is Max Keiser, former very successful stock traders, worked of course with George Soros' son and Soros and, you know, I've been on the inside of that.
[02:09:57.072 --> 02:10:00.294]  Hell, this guy was like on Nightline back in the 80s and he retired.
[02:10:00.294 --> 02:10:01.895]  He still does some stock market stuff.
[02:10:01.895 --> 02:10:12.463]  He's a journalist with RT and also the BBC and Al Jazeera and a frequent contributor to Infowars.com, MaxKeiser.com is his website.
[02:10:12.463 --> 02:10:13.865]  I want to get his take on the economy.
[02:10:14.525 --> 02:10:22.036]  Then Ebola, because there's no way the CDC said they let an Ebola patient, a nurse treating Ebola people who was sick, fly.
[02:10:22.036 --> 02:10:23.438]  She asked for permission, they gave it.
[02:10:23.438 --> 02:10:28.045]  They got guys not wearing hazmat suits, loading the Ebola patient on a plane.
[02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:31.272]  I'm entering the twilight zone.
[02:10:31.272 --> 02:10:39.018]  We've got more flights coming in as even South America, you know, and Central America and the Caribbean ban flights.
[02:10:39.018 --> 02:10:42.902]  America's like a giant trash can or vomit bag for Ebola.
[02:10:42.902 --> 02:10:43.923]  I don't say that to be gross.
[02:10:43.923 --> 02:10:45.204]  I mean, that's what we are.
[02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:50.288]  One Ebola patient said they had rooms piled to the ceiling of the blood and feces.
[02:10:50.288 --> 02:10:53.551]  I mean, you just bleed out and basically just pop.
[02:10:54.565 --> 02:10:56.146]  You just become pure virus.
[02:10:56.146 --> 02:11:01.170]  It just builds and builds and builds till the virus is just basically half your body weight and just spews out everywhere.
[02:11:03.305 --> 02:11:05.305]  And we have another report on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:05.305 --> 02:11:09.646]  CDC pushes preparedness for zombies over Ebola.
[02:11:09.646 --> 02:11:16.667]  If you're prepared for a zombie, you'll be prepared for any infectious disease, CDC director said.
[02:11:16.667 --> 02:11:21.888]  And we have an article showing that they obsess over zombies, imaginary stuff, more than Ebola.
[02:11:21.888 --> 02:11:23.949]  But really that's just their cover for Ebola.
[02:11:23.949 --> 02:11:26.829]  So we'll get Max Keiser's brief take on that and more next week.
[02:11:26.829 --> 02:11:28.530]  Well Max, I know it's on your website.
[02:11:28.530 --> 02:11:29.810]  You did videos, newscasts.
[02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:39.617]  Over a year ago, predicting by the middle of 2014, it didn't happen in the middle, it happened in the latter part, but you were correct.
[02:11:39.617 --> 02:11:43.820]  What's going on and is this the big indicator of the big one?
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:47.483]  We've seen the Dow Jones lose all of its gains the last six months.
[02:11:47.483 --> 02:11:51.125]  Dr. Pachinik, who's a big insider, thinks it'll all bounce back.
[02:11:51.125 --> 02:11:51.826]  What do you say?
[02:11:51.826 --> 02:11:54.068]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:11:54.068 --> 02:11:55.749]  Great to be with you again.
[02:11:56.984 --> 02:12:06.973]  I think if you look at the global picture, what I'm seeing are a couple of interesting places like, and it was mentioned earlier, in France.
[02:12:06.973 --> 02:12:15.961]  So in terms of the bond markets collapsing, they did collapse this past week in Greece, Italy, and France.
[02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:16.922]  So France is now
[02:12:18.537 --> 02:12:24.179]  And you said France would go down next.
[02:12:24.179 --> 02:12:25.379]  I remember that last year.
[02:12:25.379 --> 02:12:27.520]  That's why you left France.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.220]  Well, I did leave France.
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:39.023]  I came here so I can report more closely on what I call the, you know, the heart of the global financial scandals are in London.
[02:12:39.023 --> 02:12:40.884]  So I thought I would come here to report it.
[02:12:42.499 --> 02:12:49.247]  Is now on an extremely bad place.
[02:12:49.247 --> 02:12:53.151]  Their bonds are now trading like Greece and Italy.
[02:12:53.151 --> 02:12:57.957]  And so the whole Eurozone is continuing to collapse.
[02:12:57.957 --> 02:13:02.282]  And there's a lot of pressure on the European Central Bank to
[02:13:03.058 --> 02:13:03.898]  We're good to go.
[02:13:28.724 --> 02:13:42.724]  All of the moves from the IMF and the global banking system back in 2008 to save Europe, they now appear to have run their course and failed, and Europe, which is a $17 trillion economy,
[02:13:44.831 --> 02:13:46.632]  Is really on death's doorstep.
[02:13:46.632 --> 02:13:52.175]  And in particular, we're seeing France now become part of the basket case of countries.
[02:13:52.175 --> 02:13:54.936]  And France is a very big country, economically speaking.
[02:13:54.936 --> 02:13:57.818]  So now they're being flushed down the toilet.
[02:13:57.818 --> 02:14:02.260]  We see continued problems in Japan that we've talked about.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:08.543]  Their economy has been entering their third decade of deflation.
[02:14:08.543 --> 02:14:10.104]  So that's looking bad.
[02:14:10.104 --> 02:14:10.685]  The U.S.
[02:14:10.685 --> 02:14:11.285]  at the moment
[02:14:12.248 --> 02:14:14.189]  And this is the game that they play.
[02:14:14.189 --> 02:14:22.254]  You know, they talked about possibly easing up on quantitative easing, but as I've said many, many, many times, you cannot taper a Ponzi scheme.
[02:14:22.254 --> 02:14:27.577]  And very quickly, the markets dropped 8 or 9 percent, 10 percent from the high on the NASDAQ.
[02:14:27.577 --> 02:14:37.903]  And now, today, they've come out and they're saying, well, we might have to bring in quantitative easing for QE4, and that they're going to buy back a lot of bonds all over again and try to keep this Ponzi scheme going.
[02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:47.737]  But there is, unfortunately, it cannot go on forever, and we're seeing these markets kind of roll over at this point.
[02:14:47.737 --> 02:14:48.937]  So let me ask you the question.
[02:14:48.937 --> 02:14:55.042]  You did accurately predict that by the middle, I mean, even though it's three months or two months after, you thought it would have happened by,
[02:14:55.342 --> 02:15:03.125]  That's still pretty much an accurate prediction, a stunningly accurate prediction, because a lot of other folks weren't saying that, and people say this is going forever.
[02:15:03.125 --> 02:15:11.709]  Now they are introducing the idea that it could totally collapse like France and others have, and Spain and Greece and others.
[02:15:11.709 --> 02:15:14.630]  Clearly, it's moving in that direction.
[02:15:14.630 --> 02:15:17.851]  Now a lot of other financial experts are saying what you're saying.
[02:15:17.851 --> 02:15:23.594]  A, what's the next big prediction, and how bad will it get, and will it be inflationary or depressionary?
[02:15:24.114 --> 02:15:26.756]  We'll look at it here in the UK.
[02:15:26.756 --> 02:15:32.940]  It's interesting how the government just states these blatant lies.
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:39.344]  So the government here in the UK says that the number of jobs are up and the economy is recovering.
[02:15:39.344 --> 02:15:46.930]  But their tax revenues are down sharply because these jobs are people declaring themselves as self-employed.
[02:15:46.930 --> 02:15:50.452]  So the government counts it as a job even though they're not really making any income.
[02:15:51.488 --> 02:15:54.251]  Or across the board, wages are down.
[02:15:54.251 --> 02:16:01.320]  So the tax revenues are in fact decreasing, which means the debt in the UK is increasing, and the economy is shrinking.
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:04.544]  But the government will say, you know, the economy is expanding.
[02:16:04.544 --> 02:16:08.569]  So the economy here in the UK is also shrinking, along with the rest of Europe.
[02:16:09.082 --> 02:16:17.549]  So, will they be able to somehow re-inflate this economy to achieve growth?
[02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:20.211]  And the answer is no, they haven't achieved any growth at all.
[02:16:20.211 --> 02:16:30.479]  The debts are continuing to grow and so this is just, unfortunately, it means more of what we're seeing now.
[02:16:32.619 --> 02:16:53.755]  The blocking out of huge parts of the economy from the majority of people who are being raked over the coals because they have no access to credit, they have no access to decent wages, and all this money that's being printed is just going directly into the pocket of a few folks at the very top of the pyramid.
[02:16:53.755 --> 02:16:57.818]  So it's a totally rigged gulag, archipelago, casino gulag as you've coined.
[02:16:57.818 --> 02:16:59.640]  So again, what happens next?
[02:17:01.890 --> 02:17:17.522]  Well, I think the world, the money in the world, the big money in the world, the people with hundreds of billions of dollars, they don't want to lose their money and they're going to look for a place to rotate into.
[02:17:17.522 --> 02:17:18.903]  You know, the U.S.
[02:17:18.903 --> 02:17:26.489]  Treasury market has in fact been a safe haven for these huge money types for quite some time.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:31.462]  And they have ignored gold, and they've ignored silver to some extent.
[02:17:31.462 --> 02:17:42.347]  I think that you're going to see, finally, this rotation out of paper completely, where just all the sovereign bond markets are just completely ignored.
[02:17:42.347 --> 02:17:48.750]  And there will be that rotation back into assets, back into hard assets like gold, silver.
[02:17:48.750 --> 02:17:49.530]  And so I think that's
[02:17:51.072 --> 02:17:55.256]  Well sure, we've seen the University of Texas, the Chinese government, the U.S.
[02:17:55.256 --> 02:18:04.764]  government, all these rich billionaires hoarding gold while bad-mouthing it out the other side of their mouth because it exposes their paper fiat tower of fraud.
[02:18:04.764 --> 02:18:07.846]  And so where do you expect gold to start going?
[02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:09.267]  It's surged already today.
[02:18:09.267 --> 02:18:11.910]  In fact, we'll put up the latest gold trading right now for folks.
[02:18:12.330 --> 02:18:13.911]  I'll put that on screen for TV viewers.
[02:18:13.911 --> 02:18:15.152]  I'll read it out to radio listeners.
[02:18:15.152 --> 02:18:17.133]  But what do you expect to happen?
[02:18:17.133 --> 02:18:18.814]  And what else do you expect to go up?
[02:18:18.814 --> 02:18:21.436]  And then how bad will this bond route get?
[02:18:21.436 --> 02:18:24.597]  What do you expect to see in major stock markets?
[02:18:24.597 --> 02:18:32.782]  Well, the price of the bond, you know, I'm trading at a high that we haven't seen in over 300 years in the UK.
[02:18:32.782 --> 02:18:35.484]  In and over the entire life of America, 240 years plus.
[02:18:37.546 --> 02:18:52.425]  But I think, to give some context to your previous guest, in terms of the price of oil, you know, there is tremendous pressure on Russia, and after the Ukraine situation, I have a different take on the Ukraine situation.
[02:18:53.605 --> 02:19:01.207]  After listening to Victoria Nuland orchestrate a coup of that government in Kiev not too long ago.
[02:19:01.207 --> 02:19:20.613]  Nevertheless, my understanding is that Saudi Arabia, our good friends in Saudi Arabia, the ones who behead more people than ISIS will ever behead, the ones who gave us 9-11, the ones who were threatening Tony Blair in his office that he'd kill him if he didn't call off a serious fraud investigation, our friends in Saudi Arabia,
[02:19:21.173 --> 02:19:25.238]  I've been dumping paper gold in the markets, driving the price of oil down.
[02:19:25.238 --> 02:19:27.100]  I'm sorry, oil, not gold.
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:37.631]  And now to the point where in the United States, that shale industry, that brand new shale industry, you know, unless oil is at $100 a barrel, the shale industry doesn't make any money.
[02:19:38.332 --> 02:19:41.695]  So Saudi Arabia has got a deal to drive down oil to hurt Russia.
[02:19:41.695 --> 02:19:43.837]  They also want to bankrupt the shale industry.
[02:19:43.837 --> 02:19:46.719]  That's why they've been financing all the anti-fracking movements.
[02:19:46.719 --> 02:19:53.706]  And I'm not saying fracking is perfect, folks, but Saudi Arabia is financing the whole thing with the leftists to shut it down.
[02:19:53.706 --> 02:19:56.288]  I want to see what Max Keiser says about that when we come back.
[02:19:56.288 --> 02:19:57.229]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[02:19:57.229 --> 02:19:57.890]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:17.984]  So is Freeway Ricky Ross, who's a big part of the movie Kill the Messenger.
[02:24:17.984 --> 02:24:22.047]  I was the first person to interview Ross from prison.
[02:24:22.047 --> 02:24:31.994]  Actually had Kevin Booth get in there, connected to the legal team and get that, and they locked him up in quasi-solitary confinement for a while when that happened.
[02:24:31.994 --> 02:24:39.820]  What hit me when I was watching Kill the Messenger, that's over-the-top good, it should win multiple Academy Awards, is that
[02:24:41.818 --> 02:25:00.192]  I was so close to Gary North, and then it's like all the other crazy stuff in my life, not Gary North, Gary Webb, Gary North's another writer with Oliver North and Gary North, and then I didn't break these big CIA drug dealing stories with him, because I was just like, yeah, I already know all that.
[02:25:00.192 --> 02:25:01.113]  Sure, come on the air.
[02:25:01.113 --> 02:25:02.114]  Sure, sell your book.
[02:25:02.114 --> 02:25:02.974]  Yeah, you're a hero.
[02:25:02.974 --> 02:25:04.916]  Yeah, they're trying to destroy you, but why?
[02:25:04.916 --> 02:25:06.457]  Why put out new documents?
[02:25:06.457 --> 02:25:08.659]  Why put out a website with you, Gary Webb?
[02:25:10.555 --> 02:25:13.417]  Have you seen Kill the Messenger yet, Kaiser?
[02:25:13.417 --> 02:25:13.717]  No, no.
[02:25:13.717 --> 02:25:14.237]  Sounds good to me.
[02:25:41.798 --> 02:25:48.103]  I just feel like I dropped the ball monumentally not working with him more, helping get his material out, man.
[02:25:48.103 --> 02:25:53.568]  Max, why do you think we're still alive?
[02:25:53.568 --> 02:25:54.869]  We're too pretty.
[02:25:54.869 --> 02:26:01.715]  You know, people, they don't want to kill off such a beautiful, beautiful species, examples of the human species.
[02:26:01.715 --> 02:26:05.758]  It would just destroy their souls more than what they do on a day-to-day basis.
[02:26:05.758 --> 02:26:07.920]  Come on, Gary Webb had a beautiful soul.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:12.521]  Why would they kill somebody like him?
[02:26:12.521 --> 02:26:17.484]  Well, I know, he had a new book coming out, proving everything he said was true and more.
[02:26:17.484 --> 02:26:18.344]  And that's why they killed him.
[02:26:18.344 --> 02:26:22.246]  And of course, the book never came out.
[02:26:22.246 --> 02:26:27.209]  I don't mean to digress, it's just that it's just amazing that this film came out and told the truth.
[02:26:27.209 --> 02:26:28.070]  I'm dumbfounded.
[02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:31.912]  You know, I'm seeing more and more positive messages from Hollywood.
[02:26:31.912 --> 02:26:33.593]  What do you think's happening there, Max Keiser?
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:36.121]  It goes in cycles.
[02:26:36.121 --> 02:26:40.763]  You know, back in the 60s and 70s, you remember we had the anti-hero?
[02:26:40.763 --> 02:26:45.226]  They had films like Dog Day Afternoon and these other films.
[02:26:45.226 --> 02:26:54.251]  And then Reagan was elected and they immediately came out with films like Top Gun and Star Wars where it's a very simple comic book type format and now we've had kind of like a
[02:26:54.751 --> 02:26:54.991]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:10.638 --> 02:27:12.380]  You know, that type of hero.
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:14.181]  So I think, you know, run to the cycles.
[02:27:14.181 --> 02:27:21.508]  And it runs, usually, if you listen to a guy named Robert Prechter, who is from Georgia, he came up with the Elliott Wave Theory.
[02:27:21.508 --> 02:27:25.852]  He does fantastic work tying market cycles to popular culture.
[02:27:25.852 --> 02:27:28.675]  And it's very interesting what he does in that realm.
[02:27:30.723 --> 02:27:33.984]  How do you think this is all going to end with the markets?
[02:27:33.984 --> 02:27:36.145]  What's really happening in the world right now?
[02:27:53.713 --> 02:27:57.778]  You know, you always ask me this very broad, sweeping question.
[02:27:57.778 --> 02:28:05.806]  You know, where is it all going to end type of... Well, no, you made the big prediction the bond market was going to start imploding.
[02:28:05.806 --> 02:28:07.328]  It is all over the world.
[02:28:07.328 --> 02:28:08.008]  It is in U.S.
[02:28:08.008 --> 02:28:11.052]  Treasuries, which they say if that starts, it's the beginning of the end.
[02:28:11.052 --> 02:28:13.995]  So is this the time to start exiting the Titanic right now?
[02:28:15.614 --> 02:28:22.658]  These, where the rats are hiding, the last vestige of safe haven status is in the U.S.
[02:28:22.658 --> 02:28:23.499]  Treasury market.
[02:28:23.499 --> 02:28:37.067]  You know, when that finally gets to the point where they can't jack it up any further, where the central banks, who they went from their balance sheet, the Federal Reserve Bank from, it has 4 to 5 trillion of these debts on their balance sheet.
[02:28:37.067 --> 02:28:41.769]  The Bank of England increased it by 600% all the bad debts on their balance sheet.
[02:28:41.769 --> 02:28:42.610]  When it gets to the end,
[02:28:43.755 --> 02:28:46.497]  There's got to be rotation into what's left.
[02:28:46.497 --> 02:28:47.017]  There's gold.
[02:28:47.017 --> 02:28:47.778]  There's got to be gold.
[02:28:47.778 --> 02:28:49.279]  There's got to be rotation into gold.
[02:28:49.279 --> 02:28:53.222]  They've successfully avoided it for the last few years, but as you point out,
[02:28:53.965 --> 02:28:56.166]  There has been hoarding all over the world.
[02:28:56.166 --> 02:28:59.028]  People are still buying it.
[02:28:59.028 --> 02:29:09.354]  Countries like Russia and China are still buying gold, but as far as the way the paper monies are operated, they're still able to keep these prices at high levels.
[02:29:09.354 --> 02:29:20.040]  If they bring in quantitative easing for, which just means that the government buys back its own paper, you know, ad nauseum, and they keep the, trying to keep the Ponzi scheme going a little bit longer.
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:21.481]  What's going to happen then with the bond market?
[02:29:21.481 --> 02:29:22.342]  Is it going to keep going down?
[02:29:24.178 --> 02:29:26.340]  Well, yields are going down.
[02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:34.849]  Okay, when you read a headline that says the yields are crashing, the fact is that the prices, it's an inverse relationship.
[02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:37.412]  The price of the bond is going higher.
[02:29:37.412 --> 02:29:44.660]  When they say the yields are crashing, the place where you find the price of the bond crashing and yields going higher is in Greece.
[02:29:45.801 --> 02:29:48.803]  Sure they will.
[02:29:48.803 --> 02:29:50.344]  Great job Max Keiser.
[02:29:50.344 --> 02:29:53.066]  Tell you what, come back and put bookends on it.
[02:29:53.066 --> 02:29:56.388]  Then we're going to get another guest on about gold.
[02:29:56.388 --> 02:29:57.729]  In about five minutes, stay with us.
[02:29:59.522 --> 02:30:06.687]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:06.687 --> 02:30:09.008]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:09.008 --> 02:30:14.312]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:14.312 --> 02:30:19.475]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:19.475 --> 02:30:22.517]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:22.797 --> 02:30:26.880]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:31.182]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:31.182 --> 02:30:41.408]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:41.408 --> 02:30:43.930]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:30:44.250 --> 02:30:52.342]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:30:52.342 --> 02:30:56.308]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:59.525 --> 02:31:03.187]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:03.187 --> 02:31:07.470]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:07.470 --> 02:31:09.251]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:09.251 --> 02:31:14.595]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[02:31:20.478 --> 02:31:24.901]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:24.901 --> 02:31:27.723]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[02:31:32.606 --> 02:31:40.849]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:40.849 --> 02:31:46.272]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:32:21.886 --> 02:32:27.210]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:32:27.210 --> 02:32:28.211]  Not our iodine.
[02:32:28.211 --> 02:32:32.014]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:32:32.014 --> 02:32:34.576]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:32:55.152 --> 02:32:59.856]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:59.856 --> 02:33:03.839]  And bringing us in
[02:33:12.904 --> 02:33:17.067]  Here's the great Peter Reeves!
[02:33:17.067 --> 02:33:26.014]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:26.014 --> 02:33:30.577]  The Rock Band is not here because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:30.577 --> 02:33:33.119]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:33:36.508 --> 02:33:40.790]  This song is Balls to the Walls.
[02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:47.113]  And that's a aviation term for slamming the throttle all the way up to the wall.
[02:33:47.113 --> 02:33:48.374]  Or pedal to the metal.
[02:33:49.828 --> 02:33:57.772]  It has a double entendre of meaning taking wrecking balls to the East German wall.
[02:33:57.772 --> 02:34:02.674]  This was a protest song against the East German oppression.
[02:34:02.674 --> 02:34:06.316]  It came out just a few years before the wall collapsed.
[02:34:06.316 --> 02:34:08.397]  And let's go ahead and crank it up.
[02:34:08.397 --> 02:34:12.639]  God bless them!
[02:34:12.639 --> 02:34:14.060]  Gonna break the chain!
[02:34:22.487 --> 02:34:32.754]  Let's get the balls to the wall!
[02:34:32.754 --> 02:34:35.396]  We're gonna finish up with Max Keiser.
[02:34:35.396 --> 02:34:37.397]  They're gonna look at gold with a guest.
[02:34:37.397 --> 02:34:39.719]  Now listen, I don't get stuff wrong on purpose.
[02:34:40.953 --> 02:34:43.054]  And I understand the basics of the bond market.
[02:34:43.054 --> 02:34:44.415]  I don't invest in it.
[02:34:44.415 --> 02:34:45.955]  So I'm always flipping things around.
[02:34:45.955 --> 02:34:47.156]  That's the kind of mistakes I make.
[02:34:47.156 --> 02:34:50.357]  Sometimes I'll come on here and say it's 2012.
[02:34:50.357 --> 02:34:51.178]  I go, I mean, it's 14.
[02:34:51.178 --> 02:34:55.279]  Sometimes I'm writing checks and I'll write like 2011.
[02:34:55.279 --> 02:34:57.060]  I'm like, no it's not.
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:58.081]  I just do weird stuff.
[02:34:58.081 --> 02:35:02.263]  That's why I'm always fact-checking myself because I'll do some absurd things.
[02:35:02.263 --> 02:35:07.085]  When I come down here and I say the bond market's in trouble, the bond market's imploding, it is in Europe.
[02:35:07.847 --> 02:35:12.450]  That makes everybody then see-saw and run into the dollar over here, and into U.S.
[02:35:12.450 --> 02:35:13.371]  Treasuries.
[02:35:13.371 --> 02:35:21.396]  I see that as a bad sign, because it makes the yield go down, but as a fake safe haven, it pumps that bubble up more.
[02:35:21.396 --> 02:35:27.140]  And what Kaiser predicted was, is the bond market would start melting down worldwide by the middle of this year.
[02:35:28.735 --> 02:35:31.440]  Not even specifically that our bond market would go belly up.
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:36.589]  He just said it would be, in his words, in trouble and you start seeing them implode.
[02:35:36.589 --> 02:35:39.855]  So, finishing up Max Keiser, talk to me like I'm five.
[02:35:40.492 --> 02:35:47.720]  Because I look at this and read the financial papers forever and I don't even know how to articulate it because it's such flim-flam.
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:52.305]  Naked shorting of gold, paper manipulation, what you said the Saudis were doing to gold.
[02:35:52.305 --> 02:35:58.671]  Finish up with what the Saudis are doing with gold and oil right now to go after Russia and US shale producers.
[02:35:59.332 --> 02:36:15.161]  They're financing all the leftist groups against fracking, and I'm not saying fracking doesn't cause problems, folks, but the Saudis are funding it to try to shut off our industry, just like George Soros didn't want us to have the, you know, the Keystone Pipeline so he could ship it by train to the west coast of Canada, then to China.
[02:36:15.161 --> 02:36:19.823]  They make their empires out of manipulating markets, not out of being in the market.
[02:36:19.823 --> 02:36:27.047]  So explain to me, like I'm five years old, what's happening with the bond market and why you're concerned about it, and then finish up with
[02:36:28.288 --> 02:36:31.930]  Any other little snivelets or tidbits?
[02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:39.673]  Yeah, the bond market and the interest rate and let's look at that post 2008.
[02:36:39.673 --> 02:36:50.838]  We know that in 2008 there was a global financial crisis and what was decided to do was to try to make the cost of money cheaper.
[02:36:51.556 --> 02:36:52.777]  You know, money has a cost.
[02:36:52.777 --> 02:36:53.978]  It's called the interest rate.
[02:36:53.978 --> 02:36:55.439]  That's the price of money.
[02:36:55.439 --> 02:37:04.705]  So, governments say, you know what, in order to get this economy moving again, we need to lower the cost of money to get this money circulating.
[02:37:04.705 --> 02:37:09.669]  So they engage in quantitative easing, which means that the government buying back
[02:37:10.715 --> 02:37:11.435]  We're good to go.
[02:37:40.734 --> 02:37:48.821]  The banks that were the beneficiaries of all of this activity, they did not lend it out.
[02:37:48.821 --> 02:37:50.862]  They just kept it for themselves.
[02:37:50.862 --> 02:37:54.666]  And so, there was no real GDP growth.
[02:37:54.666 --> 02:38:02.152]  And here we are in 2014, and we see that the IMF just said, the world is not growing at all.
[02:38:02.152 --> 02:38:02.952]  I mean, it's shrinking.
[02:38:02.952 --> 02:38:04.354]  There's deflation.
[02:38:04.354 --> 02:38:05.475]  There's no growth.
[02:38:06.391 --> 02:38:16.814]  GDP contraction because all of that, all of that attempt to make money cheaper by lowering rates by buying bonds has failed.
[02:38:16.814 --> 02:38:29.097]  So now we're at a point where they're talking in Washington about bringing in another program, another quantitative easing program, QE4, to try to once again
[02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:33.851]  Sure.
[02:38:33.851 --> 02:38:51.880]  But am I incorrect, from just my layman perspective, to see the announcement of the end of QE Unlimited for now, that would end up long-term driving down bond market, even as you see Europe imploding, short-term driving up bond market, which lowers yield.
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:57.763]  I see that as a net bad economic sign, and as a bad investment, and as bad news.
[02:38:57.763 --> 02:38:58.483]  Is that incorrect?
[02:38:59.022 --> 02:39:00.563]  We just thought it was absolutely correct.
[02:39:00.563 --> 02:39:11.028]  The news that they were going to end quantitative easing, in fact, would have the effect of driving the bond prices down.
[02:39:11.028 --> 02:39:13.189]  Because that means they're not buying them anymore.
[02:39:13.189 --> 02:39:14.990]  So conversely, what does that mean?
[02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:16.271]  Interest rates go up.
[02:39:16.271 --> 02:39:23.014]  And higher interest rates mean higher mortgage rates, higher credit card rates, higher refinancing rates, and that's a negative on the economy.
[02:39:23.014 --> 02:39:27.676]  But the insiders don't care because they're going to continue to give themselves free money at 0%.
[02:39:27.676 --> 02:39:28.537]  We just don't get that.
[02:39:29.295 --> 02:39:36.037]  Goldman Sachs just came out with their quarterly earnings and they made a huge amount of money doing what?
[02:39:36.037 --> 02:39:39.999]  They suddenly made a huge amount of money in their bond business.
[02:39:39.999 --> 02:39:45.621]  Because they're the ones that package all the bonds for the government to do quantitative easing.
[02:39:45.621 --> 02:39:48.042]  So they're the ones on TV.
[02:39:48.042 --> 02:39:50.563]  You predicted bond markets would start breaking up this year.
[02:39:50.563 --> 02:39:53.303]  And I think your prediction's right.
[02:39:53.303 --> 02:39:56.785]  This looks like volatility, breaking up, major problems.
[02:39:56.785 --> 02:39:57.245]  Is that right?
[02:39:59.134 --> 02:39:59.875]  Yeah, it is.
[02:39:59.875 --> 02:40:10.249]  I mean, in Europe, it's breaking down and we're seeing now France, as I mentioned earlier, it has always been, there's been a duopoly with Germany and France.
[02:40:10.249 --> 02:40:14.154]  They've always been the core, the two strongest central European economies.
[02:40:14.154 --> 02:40:17.198]  Now France is going the way of Greece irrefutably.
[02:40:17.498 --> 02:40:24.540]  So that means that the European, the Euro, remember two or three years ago, people were saying the Euro was going to break apart, it never did.
[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:32.962]  Well now that talk is back on the table, because if France goes into the toilet, that means Germany is being asked to finance the entire 17 billion dollar economy.
[02:40:32.962 --> 02:40:41.244]  That's right, and they're signaling that they're getting ready to vote for very revolutionary governments, and they're going to throw Merkel and all of them out.
[02:40:41.244 --> 02:40:43.124]  The Germans have been saddled with this.
[02:40:43.124 --> 02:40:44.885]  I don't think they're going to put up with it, Max.
[02:40:45.225 --> 02:40:52.919]  No, Germany could just as easily be the one to declare that they're leaving the Eurozone and they're bringing back the Deutsche Mark.
[02:40:52.919 --> 02:40:54.041]  That could happen.
[02:40:54.041 --> 02:40:56.105]  The only reason they haven't done it is because...
[02:40:56.949 --> 02:41:02.793]  They benefit by having a screwed up euro because it helps their export market because it keeps the euro cheap.
[02:41:02.793 --> 02:41:08.957]  If they were a separate economy, then the price of the Deutsche Mark would be a lot higher than it is now.
[02:41:08.957 --> 02:41:10.098]  Just like Switzerland.
[02:41:10.098 --> 02:41:12.439]  They'd have the same problem as the Swiss.
[02:41:12.439 --> 02:41:12.899]  Exactly.
[02:41:12.899 --> 02:41:14.961]  So they've been playing both sides of the coin here.
[02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:16.670]  We're good.
[02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:47.230]  Right.
[02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:49.551]  But in France, it starts to really fall apart.
[02:41:49.551 --> 02:41:52.892]  I think Germany may say, you know, we're getting the hell out of this.
[02:41:52.892 --> 02:41:54.753]  Oh yeah, the German people want out of it.
[02:41:54.753 --> 02:41:55.833]  That's in the polls.
[02:41:55.833 --> 02:41:59.714]  But the German elite are conquering economically right now.
[02:41:59.714 --> 02:42:01.275]  Okay, now, to wrap this up.
[02:42:01.275 --> 02:42:05.316]  You referred to, after the break, you were talking about balls to the wall.
[02:42:05.316 --> 02:42:11.838]  And how this related somehow to an East German, you know, wall division between East and West Germany.
[02:42:11.838 --> 02:42:13.298]  That's completely false.
[02:42:13.298 --> 02:42:15.539]  Balls to the wall refers to balls deep.
[02:42:18.839 --> 02:42:20.301]  That's enough, it's a family show.
[02:42:20.301 --> 02:42:24.144]  No it doesn't.
[02:42:24.144 --> 02:42:37.357]  Kaiser, you're always nice, you have a lot of good info, but you're also always stirring up trouble here on the show and it refers to the lever all the way to, that's a German protest song about the wall, that's on record.
[02:42:37.797 --> 02:42:41.261]  And it's also about going all the way to the wall, pedal to metal.
[02:42:41.261 --> 02:42:45.405]  That is a, from the 1930s, an aviator thing.
[02:42:45.405 --> 02:42:47.567]  Now, somebody else may turn into something nasty.
[02:42:47.567 --> 02:42:49.609]  That's not our fault around here.
[02:42:49.609 --> 02:42:50.890]  Family show, Max.
[02:42:50.890 --> 02:42:52.351]  MaxKaiser.com.
[02:42:52.351 --> 02:42:54.894]  You're going to be on next week to follow this with us.
[02:42:54.894 --> 02:42:56.716]  Say hi to Stacey and everybody for us, okay?
[02:42:57.216 --> 02:42:57.836]  Oh, hell yeah!
[02:42:57.836 --> 02:42:58.137]  Bye now!
[02:42:58.137 --> 02:42:59.858]  All right, there he goes.
[02:42:59.858 --> 02:43:02.439]  Always being a bad stockbroker.
[02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:06.541]  Those guys are very bad behaved like Wolf of Wall Street, you know, in their behavior.
[02:43:06.541 --> 02:43:09.643]  We apologize for that.
[02:43:09.643 --> 02:43:12.925]  Max Keiser, they're joining us.
[02:43:12.925 --> 02:43:16.007]  I'm going to go to Ted Anderson here on the gold front, joining us via video Skype.
[02:43:16.007 --> 02:43:19.209]  He's out in California right now with gold up today.
[02:43:19.209 --> 02:43:20.710]  I want to get his take on that.
[02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:22.631]  But please don't forget, we've just relaunched
[02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:37.551]  The InfoWars Insider, an underground newsletter that has exclusive, I'm going to shoot after the show today, a breaking news video, whatever I think is most important, that will then be just in the newsletter, not even on YouTube.
[02:43:37.551 --> 02:43:43.516]  The latest breaking news, inside info, promo codes for products at InfoWarsStore.com and so much more.
[02:43:43.516 --> 02:43:46.338]  You go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:43:48.129 --> 02:44:00.572]  It's in the Alex Jones Show tab and you go there and you can see the exclusive videos and more and just put, you can see yesterday's exclusive video, and you just put in your email address and we will send you the information.
[02:44:00.572 --> 02:44:03.833]  So just sign up at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:44:03.833 --> 02:44:08.054]  We'll also tweet that out on Real Alex Jones right now.
[02:44:08.054 --> 02:44:12.695]  And lastly, I forgot to do this in the last hour.
[02:44:12.695 --> 02:44:14.736]  Let me get over here and do this.
[02:44:14.736 --> 02:44:15.936]  I'm always forgetting this till
[02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:20.873]  Deep into the show, so I kind of do it in a haphazard way.
[02:44:20.873 --> 02:44:28.540]  Three times a day, I take my drop of survival shield, nascent iodine, deep earth crystal source.
[02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:35.988]  I take my squirt of colloidal silver that I personally have been taking to try to boost my body's own defenses.
[02:44:35.988 --> 02:44:39.891]  I take the fluoride shield that is a known chelator.
[02:44:40.851 --> 02:44:45.475]  And detoxify, not just for fluoride, but a bunch of other toxins and heavy metals on record.
[02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:50.858]  And then super male vitality, because let me tell you, it is good to feel like a man.
[02:44:50.858 --> 02:44:53.861]  They have super female vitality as well.
[02:44:53.861 --> 02:45:04.909]  And if you'll just take my challenge and try the super male vitality, super female vitality, try the DNA Force, try the Survival Shield X2, you will start detoxing in about two weeks and feel it.
[02:45:04.909 --> 02:45:05.970]  But after about three weeks,
[02:45:07.071 --> 02:45:08.252]  With most people it passes.
[02:45:08.252 --> 02:45:12.297]  Some people don't have the detox, you know, headaches and things that comes with it.
[02:45:12.297 --> 02:45:14.319]  The Oxy Powder to flush out your guts.
[02:45:14.319 --> 02:45:17.063]  All of it available at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:21.857 --> 02:45:24.118]  And I like to mix it with water into a concoction.
[02:45:24.118 --> 02:45:32.562]  In fact, here is my secret product that I've had for about four or five months that won't come out because it's so hard to produce this.
[02:45:32.562 --> 02:45:35.283]  It's a new laboratory creation.
[02:45:35.283 --> 02:45:36.784]  Let me mix that secret sauce in there.
[02:45:36.784 --> 02:45:40.446]  I forgot to take that and mix that up.
[02:45:40.446 --> 02:45:45.228]  This is a very famous vitamin that's well known that people inject.
[02:45:46.108 --> 02:45:52.655]  Uh, because you get 90 plus percent absorption and no one's come out with a pill form that absorbs anywhere near injections.
[02:45:52.655 --> 02:45:54.297]  Well, let me just give you a little news flash.
[02:45:54.297 --> 02:46:01.484]  There's a reason we've been working on this a few years and I still don't have it out yet because it takes some pretty serious laboratories to produce it.
[02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:01.885]  But, uh,
[02:46:04.099 --> 02:46:05.980]  Let's just say this, I like it.
[02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:09.562]  So that will be available on InfoWarsLive soon and we'll be able to tell you all about the secret.
[02:46:09.562 --> 02:46:14.305]  It's got secret in the name, I'll just leave it at that.
[02:46:14.305 --> 02:46:18.427]  So InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:18.427 --> 02:46:22.529]  And all the products are right there on the site and your purchase supports the transmission.
[02:46:22.529 --> 02:46:26.872]  But if you'll just get some of the products and try them, we don't screen the calls, you've heard the rave reviews.
[02:46:28.365 --> 02:46:32.647]  Quite frankly, we can't believe all we get is positive reviews.
[02:46:32.647 --> 02:46:35.048]  Because there's always people that complain or make stuff up.
[02:46:35.048 --> 02:46:36.749]  It's just nothing but positive.
[02:46:36.749 --> 02:46:38.189]  Nothing but positive.
[02:46:38.189 --> 02:46:39.550]  And it's really simple stuff.
[02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:44.692]  Why wouldn't somebody get a deep earth crystal source of iodine?
[02:46:44.692 --> 02:46:48.774]  Major drug manufacturers use it in some of their products.
[02:46:48.774 --> 02:46:52.455]  Some of the hair care top lines get it.
[02:46:52.455 --> 02:46:53.776]  No one put it out as a supplement.
[02:46:55.171 --> 02:46:59.914]  We have the Deep Earth Crystal Source, no one else has it, as a nutraceutical.
[02:46:59.914 --> 02:47:01.515]  And it's so affordable.
[02:47:01.515 --> 02:47:04.457]  It's X2, from InpoleWorksLife.com.
[02:47:04.457 --> 02:47:10.040]  And I just put it in water three times a day, and it's life-changing, what it's done for me.
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:11.481]  Try it.
[02:47:11.481 --> 02:47:12.001]  Try it.
[02:47:12.001 --> 02:47:14.243]  If you'll just try it, you'll be blown away.
[02:47:14.243 --> 02:47:17.725]  With all the crazy stuff going on, it's time to bolster our immune systems.
[02:47:17.725 --> 02:47:21.107]  All right, Ted Anderson joining us on short notice from California.
[02:47:22.714 --> 02:47:24.275]  The owner of the GCN Radio Network.
[02:47:24.275 --> 02:47:32.078]  He also is one of the biggest private gold dealers with a AAA rating from the Better Business Bureau, something you can't say of most other gold dealers out there.
[02:47:32.078 --> 02:47:36.060]  This is where I've been buying my gold for 20 years, about 19 years.
[02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:37.601]  He's been a sponsor for 19.
[02:47:37.601 --> 02:47:41.803]  I've worked in this time slot for 18 years.
[02:47:41.803 --> 02:47:43.283]  I never wanted to go up against Rush Limbaugh.
[02:47:43.283 --> 02:47:44.344]  Ted said, no, we're going to do it.
[02:47:44.804 --> 02:47:48.447]  You know, he's got a monopoly in cities and a lot of stations, you know, want to have a show to go up against it.
[02:47:48.447 --> 02:47:52.030]  You're on here, not at night, if you want to work at this network.
[02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:58.076]  So here I am, and funny enough, I'm now beating Rush Limbaugh in ratings wherever I'm put up against him, even on smaller stations.
[02:47:58.076 --> 02:47:59.097]  But that's a side issue.
[02:48:00.441 --> 02:48:05.710]  Ted Anderson's talked about the naked shorting, the trying to knock gold down, the manipulation.
[02:48:05.710 --> 02:48:09.656]  Other commodities like oil are imploding, but gold is shooting up as elites hoard it.
[02:48:09.656 --> 02:48:12.140]  And that's all over mainstream news today.
[02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:14.924]  They may knock it down again, but I didn't sell gold, I bought.
[02:48:15.626 --> 02:48:19.169]  At $300 an ounce from Ted, or $600, or $800, or $900, or $1000.
[02:48:19.169 --> 02:48:22.392]  I quit buying at about $1500.
[02:48:22.392 --> 02:48:29.259]  I've just been holding it for all these years, literally in a safe deposit box, as an emergency backup during total implosion.
[02:48:29.259 --> 02:48:30.260]  What am I doing now?
[02:48:30.260 --> 02:48:31.361]  Buying more gold and silver.
[02:48:31.361 --> 02:48:32.322]  I got a bunch of silver too.
[02:48:33.593 --> 02:48:45.682]  Now is the time, and I didn't mean to even get him on to pitch gold with Midas, but folks, if you wait until the fall, where it historically goes up, if you wait until there is a big rush, it's already up, what, twenty-something bucks today?
[02:48:45.682 --> 02:48:48.524]  Can we pull that up for me, CNBC?
[02:48:48.524 --> 02:48:57.030]  Now is the time, I believe, to get into gold and silver, or at least get some of the books or financial prospectus documents that Midas Resources has.
[02:48:57.030 --> 02:49:00.552]  Ted, what do you make of gold?
[02:49:00.552 --> 02:49:02.794]  How much is gold up today total, Ted?
[02:49:03.783 --> 02:49:05.344]  Well presently right now gold is at 1241.
[02:49:05.344 --> 02:49:07.586]  And gold has been on the rise for the last four weeks.
[02:49:07.586 --> 02:49:09.407]  We came off at about 1180.
[02:49:09.407 --> 02:49:11.709]  So right now at this particular time gold is looking really good.
[02:49:19.174 --> 02:49:21.256]  There are three indexes that fell right now.
[02:49:21.256 --> 02:49:33.384]  One was the Retail Sales fell 0.3%, and the next thing was the Producer Price Index, which fell 0.1%, and then there's the Empire State Index, which fell 21 points.
[02:49:33.384 --> 02:49:35.346]  It's sort of like what Max Keiser was saying.
[02:49:35.346 --> 02:49:39.669]  People are watching the economy melt apart now.
[02:49:40.129 --> 02:49:44.010]  That is not only just happening here in the United States, but it's also happening in Europe.
[02:49:44.010 --> 02:49:50.373]  We've had a tremendous currency war that's been going on for the, well, since year 2008-2009.
[02:49:50.373 --> 02:50:01.056]  The United States has been trying to keep the value of the currency down, like you said, because we're printing money to keep the interest rates down, which helps us with exports and helps us boost our economy.
[02:50:01.056 --> 02:50:01.877]  It's not working.
[02:50:01.877 --> 02:50:06.978]  Like, the banks are holding on to the money and the economy never picked up again.
[02:50:06.978 --> 02:50:08.339]  And so, yeah, we
[02:50:08.539 --> 02:50:17.029]  We did see the Dow Jones Industrial Average just shoot up like crazy, but now gold and silver are starting to show that there are problems in that particular market.
[02:50:17.029 --> 02:50:20.513]  Dow's starting to back off again, and you're right about that, Alex.
[02:50:20.513 --> 02:50:26.080]  Now is the time to be getting in, because the fundamentals are all there saying, buy gold, buy gold.
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:36.703]  But at the same time, the stock market and the bond market has been pushed by the central banks to push, you know... Sure, and to be clear, gold's been going up the last few days.
[02:50:36.703 --> 02:50:37.384]  Now it's flat.
[02:50:37.384 --> 02:50:39.304]  They're obviously trying to drive it down.
[02:50:39.304 --> 02:50:46.447]  My point is, is that people would just be crazy to not be getting into gold and silver right now.
[02:50:46.447 --> 02:50:52.669]  I mean, obviously, the paper market is a complete joke, and bubbles cannot just go on forever, Ted.
[02:50:53.513 --> 02:50:55.035]  No, that's the whole thing.
[02:50:55.035 --> 02:50:57.036]  I mean, the bond market is in one big bubble.
[02:50:57.036 --> 02:50:59.839]  They're pushing the real estate market back into a huge bubble again.
[02:50:59.839 --> 02:51:09.629]  And now we're watching the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuate like it is, and we're seeing 300-point drop in a day, and that gets people nervous.
[02:51:09.989 --> 02:51:10.129]  Yeah.
[02:51:24.906 --> 02:51:25.126]  I think?
[02:51:47.196 --> 02:52:04.095]  So at this point in time, Alex, it is a good time to be getting into both gold and silver because of the fact that the behavior, if the behavior was different, if we had good economic times and conservative economic policy, we'd be sitting here saying, you know, gold and silver may be stagnant for a while.
[02:52:04.315 --> 02:52:06.457]  But it hasn't been that.
[02:52:06.457 --> 02:52:08.619]  It's been the exact opposite of that.
[02:52:08.619 --> 02:52:14.424]  We have had ferocious spending and a tremendous amount of printing of currency.
[02:52:14.424 --> 02:52:17.086]  The Fed is, you know, QE1, QE2, QE3.
[02:52:17.086 --> 02:52:25.353]  Well, for the type of inflation we've seen, a lot of mainline economists we've had on, who aren't even gold or silver bugs, have said, silver should be $100, gold should be $3,500 an ounce.
[02:52:28.155 --> 02:52:31.278]  So, they just cannot continue this forever.
[02:52:31.278 --> 02:52:40.004]  And, Ted, we haven't done this in like a year, but I know that you're able to buy when it's low, and so even when it goes up some or stabilizes, you can pass on those savings.
[02:52:40.004 --> 02:52:47.150]  What are some of the best specials you've got right now at Minus Resources and people call on silver dollars, silver half dollars?
[02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:53.935]  What are some of the best deals you've got on gold coins that you can sell at bullion prices that I know have collectible value as well?
[02:52:53.935 --> 02:52:56.377]  That's my favorite buy, is something that has collectible value.
[02:52:57.475 --> 02:53:02.316]  Historic value that's recognized, but also I can get near bullion prices.
[02:53:02.316 --> 02:53:09.858]  Well, that would be, I mean, the Walking Liberty Half is a great coin in the silver arena because of the fact that you have something that is in finite supply.
[02:53:09.858 --> 02:53:11.339]  They're right now trading at $11.77.
[02:53:11.339 --> 02:53:18.721]  On the collector side of it, you know, the Frank coin is a coin that was issued in Europe and is at $2.7322.
[02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.261]  And it is a coin that dates back into the 1800s.
[02:53:26.443 --> 02:53:26.723]  That's right.
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:43.222]  Yeah, the Buffalos are available still.
[02:53:43.222 --> 02:53:47.466]  That is a coin that's a little higher than the Silver Eagle, but also very close to the mouth.
[02:53:47.466 --> 02:53:50.708]  Something that you can get into and no problem with liquid.
[02:53:50.708 --> 02:53:59.556]  And you're still offering that deal on some of my films and other films, where you then get two SilverHalf dollars free, just to get folks introduced to it.
[02:53:59.556 --> 02:54:04.221]  A lot of great stuff there, available right now at MidasResources.com or 800-686-7000.
[02:54:07.003 --> 02:54:07.203]  Yeah.
[02:54:26.329 --> 02:54:28.610]  I mean, I just feel really good about the gold and silver I hold.
[02:54:28.610 --> 02:54:36.153]  Because even if I bought it at $500, even if they drove it down to $1,300 or $1,200 and it's starting to go back up, it doesn't matter.
[02:54:36.153 --> 02:54:36.913]  It's real.
[02:54:36.913 --> 02:54:39.154]  It's used industrially.
[02:54:39.154 --> 02:54:42.696]  You know, just like stocks and rare earth minerals, I think long-term are good.
[02:54:42.696 --> 02:54:46.177]  I wouldn't invest in prison stocks, but I've always said if you're immoral, buy more.
[02:54:46.177 --> 02:54:47.958]  Those have only gone up.
[02:54:47.958 --> 02:54:49.698]  Same thing with Apple or Google or whatever.
[02:54:49.698 --> 02:54:54.660]  I mean, this stuff's really a no-brainer if you're a long-term holder of things that are central.
[02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:55.721]  But I mean, does your gut hold?
[02:54:56.441 --> 02:54:58.482]  What are you thinking, personally?
[02:54:58.482 --> 02:55:07.207]  I think we're going to see a bear market in stocks and a bull market in metals this winter.
[02:55:07.207 --> 02:55:23.815]  Well, you know, that's what I'm looking for, Alex, because that was very clear that, you know, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the future, but when we had that $1,900 gold and $50 silver, and you're watching the central banks get in there and manipulate, it was pretty clear... Which they later admitted in even mainstream news, it was rigged.
[02:55:23.815 --> 02:55:24.576]  They did drive it down.
[02:55:24.576 --> 02:55:25.096]  It is rigged.
[02:55:25.663 --> 02:55:27.784]  Yeah, of course, that's their focus.
[02:55:27.784 --> 02:55:30.924]  That's what the central banks are designed to do, is to manipulate markets.
[02:55:30.924 --> 02:55:32.765]  That's their very charter.
[02:55:32.765 --> 02:55:35.846]  But right now, at this particular time, they're starting to lose control.
[02:55:35.846 --> 02:55:37.846]  They've been able to create this bubble.
[02:55:37.846 --> 02:55:39.186]  This bubble's going to pop.
[02:55:39.186 --> 02:55:42.567]  That will create a very good market for gold and silver.
[02:55:42.567 --> 02:55:44.488]  That's when we start to see that rise.
[02:55:44.488 --> 02:55:49.549]  I hope that we don't get pushed into a huge bubble in gold and silver just because too many people get hurt.
[02:55:49.949 --> 02:55:58.092]  But right now, at this particular time, we're at the bottom end of the market, and it's a good time to start quietly getting into that market and accumulating.
[02:55:58.092 --> 02:56:06.436]  And like you said, Alex, if you're buying for the long term and you're taking physical delivery of the silver and gold that you have, it really doesn't matter if it's fluctuating up or down.
[02:56:06.436 --> 02:56:13.759]  See, this is when I buy, is when it hits a bottom and starts going back up, and I see other indicators that mean it's going to go up.
[02:56:13.759 --> 02:56:17.140]  That's when I buy, is when nobody else is except the elite.
[02:56:17.580 --> 02:56:18.441]  I mean, it's in the news.
[02:56:18.441 --> 02:56:23.344]  You can type in ultra-rich hoarding gold, institutions hoarding gold.
[02:56:23.344 --> 02:56:25.906]  Well, I'm going to do what the smart insiders do.
[02:56:25.906 --> 02:56:30.849]  And it doesn't mean it's silver bullet or perfect, but, I mean, it's just what my gut tells me to do.
[02:56:30.849 --> 02:56:35.833]  I'm going to be giving you a call, or your brokers today, Ted and myself, probably get a little bit of silver, a little bit of gold.
[02:56:35.833 --> 02:56:37.934]  I just buy a little here, a little there over the years.
[02:56:37.934 --> 02:56:40.376]  It builds into something really just for my children.
[02:56:40.376 --> 02:56:40.416]  800-686-8000.
[02:56:42.978 --> 02:56:43.338]  2-2-3-7.
[02:56:43.338 --> 02:56:45.719]  I just got a wild hair today.
[02:56:45.719 --> 02:56:46.520]  He said, hey, where's Ted?
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:47.380]  Oh, he's in California.
[02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:48.421]  Got you on.
[02:56:48.421 --> 02:56:52.263]  Because I may be wrong, because they can manipulate things.
[02:56:52.263 --> 02:56:56.285]  But I think now, after a year not promoting us, I think now's the time to get in, folks.
[02:56:56.285 --> 02:56:56.805]  800-686-2237.
[02:56:56.805 --> 02:56:58.666]  800-686-2237.
[02:56:58.666 --> 02:57:04.389]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:05.509]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:57:05.509 --> 02:57:08.511]  And you're always welcome to come to Austin and your Globetrotting and be in studio with us.
[02:57:09.216 --> 02:57:10.617]  I will come right down.
[02:57:10.617 --> 02:57:11.538]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:57:11.538 --> 02:57:13.300]  There goes Ted Anderson.
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:15.001]  I'm out of time for today's show.
[02:57:15.001 --> 02:57:17.303]  I skipped a couple of breaks because I get so hyper.
[02:57:17.303 --> 02:57:19.906]  Fabulous job to the crew.
[02:57:19.906 --> 02:57:24.970]  We've got some really big guests coming up.
[02:57:24.970 --> 02:57:26.111]  I like Max Keiser.
[02:57:26.111 --> 02:57:27.552]  He listens to the show religiously.
[02:57:27.552 --> 02:57:31.195]  He really is a smart guy, but he also knows I have a very conservative audience.
[02:57:31.195 --> 02:57:32.016]  He likes to be naughty.
[02:57:32.016 --> 02:57:33.838]  I apologize for that.
[02:57:33.838 --> 02:57:34.598]  He's a big kid.
[02:57:35.689 --> 02:57:39.412]  And AP produces his show.
[02:57:39.412 --> 02:57:40.694]  He's going to be in town for a month soon.
[02:57:40.694 --> 02:57:42.755]  I think he's going to be doing it out of our studios.
[02:57:42.755 --> 02:57:45.578]  I got to be honest, I don't know if I can handle Kaiser around here for a month, folks.
[02:57:45.578 --> 02:57:49.021]  He's just, I like him, but it's like a Loki or something.
[02:57:49.021 --> 02:57:51.683]  I don't know if we can have Loki in the building for a full month.
[02:57:51.683 --> 02:57:54.846]  May have to hang some garlic up around the doorways.
[02:57:54.846 --> 02:57:56.387]  And I'm just joking.
[02:57:56.387 --> 02:57:57.108]  He's a great guy.
[02:57:57.108 --> 02:57:58.649]  I'm just messing with him.
[02:57:58.649 --> 02:57:59.430]  He always teases me.
[02:58:02.833 --> 02:58:07.418]  I may tape a special report on Gary Webb and kill the messenger.
[02:58:07.418 --> 02:58:12.203]  I was so shook up by the film last night.
[02:58:12.203 --> 02:58:15.607]  Because just the lost opportunity of helping him.
[02:58:15.607 --> 02:58:18.490]  And the lost opportunity of getting to know him better.
[02:58:19.807 --> 02:58:23.150]  When he was just, because I'm not like bragging, there's a big movie about this guy.
[02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:25.331]  I interviewed him probably 15 times or more.
[02:58:25.331 --> 02:58:27.933]  He wanted me to build him a website.
[02:58:27.933 --> 02:58:31.376]  He wanted to work with me because everybody else had turned their back on him.
[02:58:31.376 --> 02:58:35.178]  It's just bizarre and now I'm watching this movie remembering it all.
[02:58:35.178 --> 02:58:36.840]  I just take so much for granted.
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:39.121]  I hope folks don't take this show for granted.
[02:58:39.121 --> 02:58:40.823]  Or take the Drudge Report for granted.
[02:58:40.823 --> 02:58:42.784]  Or anybody else telling the truth.
[02:58:42.784 --> 02:58:45.266]  Because the system is coming after us.
[02:58:45.266 --> 02:58:47.828]  The White House attacked us twice this week through Media Matters.
[02:58:50.009 --> 02:58:56.615]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:58:56.615 --> 02:59:01.759]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:59:01.759 --> 02:59:10.487]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:10.487 --> 02:59:14.551]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:59:14.551 --> 02:59:16.833]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:59:18.963 --> 02:59:23.566]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:59:23.566 --> 02:59:27.388]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:59:27.388 --> 02:59:28.648]  Others don't.
[02:59:28.648 --> 02:59:30.789]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:30.789 --> 02:59:32.570]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:32.570 --> 02:59:35.432]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:35.432 --> 02:59:42.076]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:59:42.076 --> 02:59:44.777]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:59:44.777 --> 02:59:47.158]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:59:47.158 --> 02:59:47.939]  Others don't.
[02:59:51.555 --> 02:59:54.149]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
