[00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:13.538]  I read an interesting article today that said most Americans wouldn't even be able to pass a naturalization test to become a U.S.
[00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:13.939]  citizen.
[00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.401]  I came out here to the Capitol today to see if I could ask a few questions and find out whether or not that's true.
[00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:22.062]  Do you know what the supreme law of the land is?
[00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:22.122]  No.
[00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:22.822]  No.
[00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:26.744]  You don't know what the supreme law of the land is?
[00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:27.564]  No, I don't.
[00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:30.406]  Treat each other well.
[00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:31.446]  Should be.
[00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:33.247]  Um, I don't know that.
[00:00:34.427 --> 00:00:34.627]  No.
[00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:35.328]  What is it?
[00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:38.619]  I know what it should be.
[00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:43.502]  Well, that's for another debate.
[00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.403]  No.
[00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:47.144]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:48.665]  Do you know what the supreme law of the land is?
[00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:48.725]  No.
[00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:49.585]  No, no, no.
[00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:50.266]  He does not.
[00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:55.148]  Do you know who the vice president is?
[00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:57.390]  Are you an American?
[00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.451]  The Constitution.
[00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:00.671]  No, I do not.
[00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:02.332]  Have fun.
[00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:03.173]  Be happy.
[00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:05.414]  Supreme law of the land.
[00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.045]  Do one to others as they do one to you.
[00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:12.905]  Freedom and liberty.
[00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:14.386]  What do you think?
[00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:15.786]  First Amendment.
[00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:17.126]  Yeah, rights to all.
[00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:20.227]  I do not know.
[00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:21.587]  Do you know?
[00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:27.528]  Is it the right to... Is it the right to... Bare arms?
[00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:28.108]  No.
[00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.789]  No.
[00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.949]  That's like the Second Amendment.
[00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:31.029]  Yeah.
[00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:32.089]  Liberty.
[00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.050]  Something in the pursuit of happiness.
[00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:37.830]  That just sounds like a catchphrase.
[00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.090]  A catchphrase?
[00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.170]  The Supreme Law of the Land?
[00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:42.951]  Do you know who wrote the Declaration of Independence?
[00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:45.932]  Uh oh.
[00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:50.994]  Can't think of his name right now.
[00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:57.856]  Thomas Jefferson and a couple other guys that I couldn't think of off the top of my head, but I know it was more so than just him.
[00:01:58.957 --> 00:01:59.797]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:03.737]  Besides Thomas Jefferson?
[00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:06.318]  Um, Thomas Jefferson?
[00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:07.579]  The forefathers?
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.121]  What is the name of our national anthem?
[00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:13.063]  The name of our national anthem?
[00:02:13.323 --> 00:02:13.904]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:15.144]  God bless America.
[00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:15.985]  Okay.
[00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:17.106]  I know that.
[00:02:17.126 --> 00:02:19.527]  I mean, do you want me to sing it for you right now?
[00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:20.448]  No.
[00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:22.790]  Uh, the Star-Spangled Banner?
[00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:25.952]  Um, oh God, that's a good question.
[00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:29.234]  These are all things that we're supposed to know.
[00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:33.443]  Uh, it is Star Spangled Banner.
[00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:36.944]  A global info war is underway with our minds.
[00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:42.086]  Recent studies from Harvard show human beings are getting dumber and weaker.
[00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:45.888]  Fluoride is dumped into our water supply daily.
[00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:53.250]  Geoengineering projects are happening all over the world while planes dump chemicals into the atmosphere.
[00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.192]  Vaccinations are causing illness and developmental problems.
[00:02:58.153 --> 00:03:01.274]  GMOs affect our food supplies at an alarming rate.
[00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:07.618]  And all this is done by design to reduce population and make us slaves for the New World Order.
[00:03:08.198 --> 00:03:11.500]  No wonder people can't answer questions about their own country.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.963]  On what day was the Constitution of the United States adopted?
[00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:20.720]  Um, 19-something.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.341]  I don't know.
[00:03:23.822 --> 00:03:25.803]  Seventy-six, I think.
[00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:29.506]  What day was it adopted?
[00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:30.707]  Yeah, it's not.
[00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:31.607]  He's trying to trick us.
[00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:32.848]  Yeah, July 4th, 1776.
[00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:34.889]  Am I going to be that guy?
[00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.251]  You already are.
[00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:38.752]  On what date?
[00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:39.993]  July 4th, 1776.
[00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:40.493]  It wasn't the 4th.
[00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:40.833]  I forget.
[00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:48.965]  4th of July?
[00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:51.207]  What year?
[00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:51.207]  1776.
[00:03:52.408 --> 00:03:55.330]  When we say the Pledge of Allegiance, what do we show loyalty to?
[00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.792]  To the flag of the United States of America.
[00:03:59.132 --> 00:03:59.292]  And?
[00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.973]  To the Republic for which it stands.
[00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:04.736]  I guess the United States of America and the flag.
[00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:08.679]  Uh... Goodness sakes.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.521]  Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America.
[00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:16.424]  Uh... Either the flag or the country.
[00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:18.307]  The flag.
[00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:19.208]  And?
[00:04:19.869 --> 00:04:20.329]  And God.
[00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.250]  Okay.
[00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.891]  Do you know who the father of our country is?
[00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:24.473]  George Washington.
[00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:26.354]  No.
[00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:30.718]  I don't know.
[00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.619]  I don't know.
[00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.141]  No idea.
[00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:36.163]  George Washington?
[00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:38.185]  I think it's George Washington.
[00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:38.945]  No.
[00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:39.666]  No, no, no.
[00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:40.146]  He does not.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.981]  George, uh, George Washington.
[00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:47.143]  What do we call the first ten amendments of the Constitution?
[00:04:48.164 --> 00:04:51.827]  Um, the... ten amendments of the Constitution?
[00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.168]  The con- like, your rights or something?
[00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:54.769]  What?
[00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.411]  The first ten amendments of the Constitution.
[00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:57.991]  What do we call that?
[00:04:58.992 --> 00:04:59.873]  The Constitution?
[00:04:59.893 --> 00:05:01.694]  I'm not sure.
[00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:03.695]  Man, these trick questions are just- I can't get you.
[00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:05.857]  Amendments?
[00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:08.459]  The Bill of Rights?
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.000]  I don't know.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.640]  I'm not done either.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.421]  You don't know what we call that?
[00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:12.792]  No.
[00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:14.098]  Bill of Rights.
[00:05:14.782 --> 00:05:15.565]  That's way too hard.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:34.163]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:42.485]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:47.347]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:47.527 --> 00:05:54.169]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:54.309 --> 00:06:01.394]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:08.379]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.862]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
