[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.232]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.135]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:19.042]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:20.523]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:22.184]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.488]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:38.257]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, June 26, 2014.
[00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:40.099]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:41.380]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.962]  We have a jam-packed show.
[00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.044]  We're going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:51.767]  We have some very interesting articles that he's put up, and we're going to talk about that.
[00:00:52.008 --> 00:01:01.074]  The main one I'm interested in is this ex-CIA officer who claims that an open-source revolution is about to overthrow a global oligarchy.
[00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:03.376]  And the reason I like this
[00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:06.077]  This is because it is so optimistic.
[00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:08.639]  This guy sees us winning this thing.
[00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.659]  You know, a revolution is coming.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.822]  The question is, is it going to be a peaceful revolution, or is it going to be a violent revolution?
[00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:22.405]  Is it going to be a revolution that results in individual liberty, or is it going to result in a security state?
[00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:25.767]  And so, I'm very anxious to talk to Paul about this article.
[00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.668]  I think you'll enjoy hearing about it.
[00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:32.270]  We also have updates on what's going on with SWAT teams all around the country.
[00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.971]  We've got 10 facts that you need to know about SWAT teams.
[00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:49.337]  And we also see that from an article from Mikhail Thelen, we see that SWAT Team Association in Massachusetts, regional SWAT teams, say that they don't have to respond to Freedom of Information requests because
[00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:51.819]  They're private organizations.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:03.654]  And the ACLU says, well, you know, either you're a government organization because you're getting this equipment, this money, this funding, this training, and doing government jobs, or you're breaking the law.
[00:02:04.054 --> 00:02:04.495]  What is it?
[00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:08.179]  So that's an interesting take on this, to see the arrogance
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:20.847]  of our government as it continually goes further and further into a secret police state where we're not allowed to know anything about the operation of anyone who works in the government.
[00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:25.209]  It's not just the police, it's not just the military, it certainly isn't the CIA or the NSA.
[00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.811]  Everybody is acting as if they work for the CIA now.
[00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:33.373]  They all aren't going to tell you anything, and it's all a top secret.
[00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.915]  So, we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson about that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:42.217]  We've got Alex Jones is going to be joining us with a special report, and we're going to be talking to Gerald Salenti.
[00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:44.699]  Now, of course, there's a lot of news about economics.
[00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.921]  Yesterday, we talked about how they have revised the gross domestic product up from 1% decline to a 3% decline, 2.9%.
[00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:55.835]  That is huge.
[00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:58.917]  And so we're going to be talking about what's really behind that data.
[00:02:58.957 --> 00:03:00.918]  We want to get Gerald Salenti's forecast on that.
[00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:04.319]  He has a lot to tell us as well about Iraq.
[00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.021]  That's a favorite topic of his, how the military-industrial complex is always pushing us into war.
[00:03:10.101 --> 00:03:13.263]  So Gerald has a lot to say about that, as well as the economic data.
[00:03:13.683 --> 00:03:23.867]  And of course, when we look at this right after the break, when we come back and start going over news, we're going to look at the different excuses that are being offered for this massive decline in the economy.
[00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:25.448]  So we're going to look at what's really behind it.
[00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:27.809]  We're going to look at the excuses that are going to be put out there.
[00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.171]  There's also a lot of breaking news about the Supreme Court.
[00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.472]  They're releasing a lot of decisions here this week.
[00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.833]  They're coming, multiple ones a day.
[00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:38.454]  We had a couple of decisions yesterday.
[00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:49.700]  One of the ones that I thought was most important was the unanimous decision from the Supreme Court saying that police need a search warrant to look at data on your phone.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.500]  Really?
[00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:51.281]  Do you think?
[00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:53.002]  That's great.
[00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:56.064]  They unanimously upheld the Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:57.726]  So that's good.
[00:03:58.186 --> 00:03:59.027]  That's real good news.
[00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:09.134]  And today we have another decision from them where they essentially strike down some free speech zones in Massachusetts that were put up around abortion clinics.
[00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:14.138]  So we're going to talk about that as well as another decision that affected Obama's
[00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:15.878]  Recess appointments.
[00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:21.340]  I think Kurt Nemo has the right take on this that a lot of people have missed and that is the background behind this.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.642]  That this is really about trying to establish a balance between different branches and the federal government and of course the way the Constitution was set up.
[00:04:30.262 --> 00:04:36.923]  It wasn't just a division and a check and balance within the federal government as we're told in our government schools.
[00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:38.544]  Really, that was there.
[00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:39.644]  Certainly is there.
[00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:40.304]  That's a part of it.
[00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:43.885]  But it's also key that we understand and that we recover
[00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:52.648]  Not only the understanding, but the actual practice that there's a division between the central authority, between the state authorities, and between the people.
[00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:55.869]  And the key way you're going to get that is with jury nullification.
[00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:56.730]  We're not going to talk about that.
[00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.652]  We're going to talk about these Supreme Court decisions and about scofflaw federal employees and bureaucracies and congressmen.
[00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:04.353]  So stay with us.
[00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:04.953]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.761]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:19.027]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:26.432]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:30.955]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that's good stuff.
[00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:41.478]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:05:41.898 --> 00:05:48.059]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:56.362]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:12.913]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:17.076]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:20.758]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:23.860]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:31.385]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:35.227]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:39.751]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:45.856]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:49.679]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.381]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:53.922]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:06:54.062 --> 00:06:55.303]  It's time to take action.
[00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:57.145]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:13.838]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:17.179]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.260]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.440]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.141]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:26.362]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:27.983]  If so, consider this.
[00:07:28.223 --> 00:07:37.166]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:07:37.526 --> 00:07:43.530]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.531]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:53.596]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.070]  Live Life Healthy!
[00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:22.758]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.385]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.756 --> 00:08:30.977]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:31.037 --> 00:08:31.638]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:31.698 --> 00:08:35.921]  On this Thursday, June 26, 2014, I'll be your host today.
[00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:44.047]  And, of course, you'll be joined later in the show by a special report by Alex Jones, as well as an interview with Gerald Cilenti coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:46.749]  A lot of breaking economic news.
[00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:50.792]  So we want to get Gerald Cilenti's takes on that, on the forecast.
[00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:54.034]  We've had a huge downturn, a huge revision.
[00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:57.117]  That's a downturn in the Gross Domestic Product.
[00:08:57.157 --> 00:09:02.781]  They estimated that it was just a 1% downturn, which would be bad enough, but then they tripled that yesterday.
[00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:09.946]  So we're going to talk a little bit more about that in detail in just a few minutes, and we're going to talk to Gerald Cilenti about that, and I know that a topic that Gerald loves to talk about
[00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:14.750]  Is the military-industrial complex driving us into war?
[00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.211]  He's got a lot to say about that.
[00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.193]  So he's going to be joining us in the third hour.
[00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:20.575]  Alex will be with us in the second hour.
[00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:23.857]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.859]  So we've got a very busy show here.
[00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.822]  Before we get to our guests, I wanted to go over some news.
[00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:30.703]  There's a story up on
[00:09:31.744 --> 00:09:39.151]  Infowars.com from Adan Salazar talking about the growing chorus that is charging Obama with facilitating immigration influx.
[00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:47.257]  You know, I'm reminded of the latest Captain America movie where the Robert Redford character says,
[00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:51.360]  You have to destroy the world to rebuild it.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.623]  You know what they're doing is they're creating a new world disorder before they establish their new world order.
[00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:01.106]  They're doing this not only in America but they're also doing it in Europe.
[00:10:01.186 --> 00:10:06.169]  That's what we're seeing going on with uncontrolled immigration there because they're using essentially the same tactics.
[00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:12.870]  They're trying to consolidate the different areas of the globe regionally into a European Union and to NAFTA.
[00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.291]  Then they are going to take those areas down.
[00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:21.492]  And one of the ways that they do it is with a massive, uncontrolled demographic surge.
[00:10:21.712 --> 00:10:28.694]  And we've heard yesterday, we've played excerpts from Petraeus talking in London, talking about what comes after America.
[00:10:28.714 --> 00:10:29.554]  He says, well, that's simple.
[00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:30.835]  North America.
[00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:33.017]  We're 20 years into NAFTA.
[00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:40.425]  And so we're going to see that North America, the unified North America, is going to replace America.
[00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:41.646]  They're very upfront about it now.
[00:10:41.686 --> 00:10:43.268]  They've come out, they've taken the mask off.
[00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:46.711]  They're no longer pretending that NAFTA is just a trade deal.
[00:10:46.992 --> 00:10:47.993]  And it isn't a trade deal.
[00:10:48.493 --> 00:10:50.494]  Neither was the European Union a trade deal.
[00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:54.656]  They are both intermediate steps to a global control.
[00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:56.017]  And we're seeing that now.
[00:10:56.097 --> 00:11:02.921]  And as Adan points out, many people are joining the chorus and saying that this is not a surge.
[00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:06.843]  And you know, when I talk about a surge, it reminds me exactly of Petraeus.
[00:11:06.903 --> 00:11:08.844]  This is really a demographic surge.
[00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:10.124]  This is boots on the ground.
[00:11:10.645 --> 00:11:16.168]  We've been attacked from above by the banksters with massive debt, with the
[00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:32.339]  mortgage collapse of the economy five years ago six years ago actually now we're getting boots on the ground that are going to put that in and of course it's not just and spontaneous humanitarian crisis but it's carefully concocted premeditated plan
[00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:33.099]  I think?
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.764]  Arizona representatives saying what occurs when the Obama administration chooses not to enforce our laws.
[00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:55.426]  We have the Texas judge.
[00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:57.868]  We've got the National Border Patrol Council.
[00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:03.592]  These are people, the former Association of Border Patrol Officers, they're the boots on the ground.
[00:12:03.692 --> 00:12:16.362]  They're the ones seeing that the borders are collapsing and they're very upset about the fact that they're no longer doing law enforcement, they're just changing diapers and running a taxi service in the United States.
[00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:17.423]  And of course this is being done
[00:12:18.163 --> 00:12:26.832]  By Homeland Security, the same organization that controls our collapsed borders is also harassing and still harassing people in the airport.
[00:12:27.473 --> 00:12:40.186]  And of course we showed from the mistakenly published unredacted lawsuit that John Corbett had against the TSA, we showed that back in 2011 they admitted in their own internal documents that there was no threat
[00:12:40.706 --> 00:12:42.147]  against airports or airplanes.
[00:12:42.207 --> 00:13:05.523]  In 2011, at the same time they were threatening a no-fly zone in Texas because we had Texas representatives that had already passed unanimously, essentially in the House, to rein in the TSA and its sexual abuse against children, going into their pants, looking, harassing everyone at the border when they come in via plane, but opening up the border completely for anyone to come in.
[00:13:06.043 --> 00:13:10.046]  Now there's a story that's up on the Drudge Report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:17.971]  And this is a professor from University of California, Davis, and he also says that this is a deliberate plot.
[00:13:18.412 --> 00:13:20.233]  Now, this is what he, his take on it.
[00:13:20.253 --> 00:13:38.507]  He says, this is a plot to exclude the American middle class from a University of California education and to create a new demographic of largely immigrant or foreign national undergraduate population that can be re-educated from the ground up and controlled more readily.
[00:13:39.307 --> 00:13:39.988]  Exactly.
[00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.850]  This is about excluding the middle class.
[00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:50.995]  This is about... This is what the colleges have been doing for a long time, but this is why they're bringing in the massive influx of immigration.
[00:13:51.535 --> 00:14:03.684]  They want people who are indebted with gratitude to the state for their education, for everything that the state is lavishing on them, and they are lavishing expenses on them far greater than they are, for example,
[00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:11.027]  Our veterans of the VA hospitals, they're getting nothing, whereas these people who are coming in illegally are being given everything.
[00:14:11.087 --> 00:14:13.388]  Transportation, food, clothing, shelter.
[00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:16.689]  They are trying to indebt them with gratitude.
[00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:21.090]  And if you want to go to college, however, you're not going to get in-state tuition rates.
[00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:25.892]  You're not going to get a full ride commission, as he talks about, or tuition.
[00:14:26.392 --> 00:14:27.253]  You're not going to get that.
[00:14:28.146 --> 00:14:28.927]  Illegals will get it.
[00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:30.950]  The children of the illegals will get it, but you aren't.
[00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.615]  They can go to any state that they want and get in-state tuition.
[00:14:35.436 --> 00:14:41.263]  If I were to go from Texas to California, I wouldn't get in-state tuition in California, but illegal aliens will.
[00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:55.992]  And so what they're trying to do is they're either going to indebt these people with gratitude to the state that takes care of them in all respects, or if you choose to go to college, you will be so indebted to the banks that you will never get out of debt.
[00:14:56.032 --> 00:14:59.155]  You will be an indentured servant to the banks for the rest of your life.
[00:14:59.195 --> 00:15:02.297]  You can't dismiss your college loans.
[00:15:03.098 --> 00:15:05.120]  That's one thing you can't dismiss with a bankruptcy.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.161]  So you're going to be a debt slave for the rest of your life.
[00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:10.624]  You know, if you're in the middle class, you don't need that brainwashing.
[00:15:11.064 --> 00:15:15.727]  If you take a business class on return on investment, you know, you can club out of college completely.
[00:15:16.168 --> 00:15:17.189]  Just forget the whole thing.
[00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.170]  But this is a great article.
[00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.071]  You should take a look at it.
[00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:24.174]  And he even has a publicity stunt that he's working on, which basically will
[00:15:25.106 --> 00:15:26.647]  With parity, trying to make the point.
[00:15:27.347 --> 00:15:33.870]  Demanding racial equality for 30 million Asians of different nationalities that they be brought into the U.S.
[00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.911]  and integrated into the National Security Welfare State.
[00:15:36.931 --> 00:15:38.272]  And that's exactly what it is.
[00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:40.353]  It's the National Security Welfare State.
[00:15:40.393 --> 00:15:43.134]  It's the warfare welfare state.
[00:15:43.174 --> 00:15:46.576]  But of course now the warfare aspect of it is turning inward.
[00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:48.628]  Just looking at some of these other headlines.
[00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:52.029]  Hundreds of immigrants to be sheltered at Border Patrol Training Academy.
[00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:56.451]  The immigration reform prospects are dead, says Luis Gutierrez.
[00:15:56.551 --> 00:15:59.232]  Pelosi scoffs at the House GOP lawsuit.
[00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:04.274]  ICE removal operations director confirms years before illegals will have their cases heard.
[00:16:04.294 --> 00:16:12.217]  They've got a backlog of so many hundreds of thousands of cases that of course they're looking at this as essentially their paperwork that allows them to stay in the United States.
[00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:15.462]  And then we look at this last one here.
[00:16:15.622 --> 00:16:17.325]  Europe's migrant influx.
[00:16:18.308 --> 00:16:21.389]  They say we need help, and we don't know where from.
[00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.790]  See, it's not just America.
[00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:25.371]  This is a global plan.
[00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:28.913]  It is about regional disorder, regional consolidation.
[00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:42.219]  We see them moving ahead with these plans with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with the Transatlantic Partnership, where they're replacing democratically elected governments with these kind of NAFTA-style tribunals, where
[00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.140]  Multinational corporations.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.684]  Not corporations, not like somebody who has incorporated down the street for his small business.
[00:16:49.724 --> 00:16:54.468]  This is only multinational corporations that are going to get this kind of protection.
[00:16:55.728 --> 00:16:59.992]  Now there's also some nanny state news today, which is a little bit lighter.
[00:17:01.213 --> 00:17:03.934]  They actually suffered a blow in New York Court.
[00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:07.996]  Courts actually had a pretty good week this week for Liberty.
[00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:13.098]  This is just a New York Court of Appeals, but it is the highest court in the state.
[00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:16.359]  This is an article up on InfoWars.com from Kurt Nemo.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.941]  Nanny State suffers a blow in New York.
[00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:23.622]  The court overturns a soda ban from Michael Bloomberg.
[00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.743]  They say he exceeded his authority.
[00:17:26.244 --> 00:17:26.644]  Do you think?
[00:17:27.404 --> 00:17:39.530]  I mean, the ban, as he points out, didn't apply to drinks that were sold in grocery stores, it didn't apply to diet sodas, it didn't apply to drinks with more than 70% fruit juice, or drinks that contained alcohol.
[00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.431]  So he's just got his little list.
[00:17:41.491 --> 00:17:46.273]  I guess, you know, when you're going into a restaurant, he doesn't want you to get too big a glass of soda or get refills with it.
[00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:46.993]  Whatever.
[00:17:47.053 --> 00:17:50.435]  I mean, if you're a dictator, you can make any kind of arbitrary rules you want.
[00:17:51.095 --> 00:17:52.597]  But look at where this is going.
[00:17:53.178 --> 00:17:59.906]  Ironically, this is a follow-up story that also came out today from Bloomberg looking at another aspect of the nanny state.
[00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:02.730]  And this is a Bloomberg News Service.
[00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.152]  Here's the headline.
[00:18:04.252 --> 00:18:08.758]  Hospitals soon to see donuts to cigarette charges for health.
[00:18:09.687 --> 00:18:14.350]  In other words, you eat donuts, you smoke cigarettes, you're going to get surcharges on your insurance.
[00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:27.017]  This is something we told people 20 years ago when Hillary Clinton, as First Lady, decided that she was going to take over the health care of the entire country and federalize it with HillaryCare.
[00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:40.600]  And we were telling people if you allow the state to become the single insurer in the name of efficiency, and of course that's not going to make anything efficient when you've got a monopoly, everybody knows that, but that was what Hillary Clinton was trying to sell at the time.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:49.001]  We said if you allow them to take over health care completely, they're going to be coming into your kitchen and telling you what you can eat.
[00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:51.222]  You've got too much fat here, you've got too much sugar there.
[00:18:51.322 --> 00:18:51.622]  Why?
[00:18:52.342 --> 00:18:53.802]  Because they own you.
[00:18:54.482 --> 00:18:57.263]  You are a liability on their balance sheet.
[00:18:57.663 --> 00:18:58.944]  And that's what's happening now.
[00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:06.070]  This whole thing with Obamacare is really more of a fascist spin on it than Hillary's, which was full-out socialism.
[00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.591]  It's one of the reasons that he got it through.
[00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:11.954]  It's one of the reasons that it started with Mitt Romney in Massachusetts.
[00:19:12.114 --> 00:19:16.758]  It's a fascist plan to make money for the insurance companies.
[00:19:16.798 --> 00:19:19.120]  And of course, the insurance companies want to keep their profits.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.000]  So what are they going to do?
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.123]  They're going to get the hospitals looking at your life.
[00:19:23.683 --> 00:19:35.847]  What they say in here is the idea is to use big data and predictive models to think about population health and then to drill down to the individual levels to find someone is running into trouble.
[00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:38.468]  We can reach out and try to help him.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.382]  Remember that song from Simon and Garfunkel and Mrs. Robinson?
[00:19:43.043 --> 00:19:45.044]  We'd like to learn a little bit about you for our files.
[00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:47.026]  We'd like to help you learn to help yourself.
[00:19:47.126 --> 00:19:47.786]  Look around you.
[00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:49.427]  All you see are sympathetic eyes.
[00:19:49.868 --> 00:19:51.589]  The nanny state comes to you that way.
[00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:57.133]  But then they want to give you a call and tell you, we have a problem with your diet.
[00:19:57.513 --> 00:19:59.335]  We have a problem with your lifestyle.
[00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:02.217]  You need to change that or there'll be penalties.
[00:20:02.557 --> 00:20:03.478]  We're going to be right back.
[00:20:03.498 --> 00:20:08.282]  We're going to talk about economics, and we're going to talk about another control point, and that's transportation.
[00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:08.822]  Stay with us.
[00:20:09.222 --> 00:20:10.103]  Clean water at home.

[00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:14.828]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:19.191]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:24.135]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:27.158]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:32.663]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:21:32.943 --> 00:21:39.790]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.054]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:45.115]  Nobody else.
[00:21:45.535 --> 00:21:49.178]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:57.926]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:16.102]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[00:22:16.582 --> 00:22:19.284]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:20.806]  I am telling you to take cover!
[00:22:20.986 --> 00:22:24.749]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:30.874]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[00:22:31.114 --> 00:22:35.218]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save you... And no one's coming to help them.
[00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:36.759]  You could be dead wrong.
[00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:42.144]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.210]  Chaos on our border.
[00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:21.692]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:23:22.172 --> 00:23:23.733]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:23:24.093 --> 00:23:26.734]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.

[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.761]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:35.561]  I'm David Knight.
[00:24:35.981 --> 00:24:38.662]  Appropriate music for our next topic here.
[00:24:38.702 --> 00:24:44.544]  We're talking about something very dark and Camila Morana definitely sets the right mood here, guys.
[00:24:45.504 --> 00:24:48.425]  There's an article up on InfoWars today from Mikhail Thelin.
[00:24:49.125 --> 00:25:03.002]  SWAT team refuses public records request and says we are not a government agency to which the ACLU says either it's a public entity subject to public records laws or what it's doing is illegal.
[00:25:03.939 --> 00:25:11.025]  Now this is a regional SWAT team in Massachusetts refusing to release information on raid statistics, saying that it's a private organization.
[00:25:11.105 --> 00:25:14.648]  It's the Northeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council, NMLEC.
[00:25:15.569 --> 00:25:20.854]  And NMLEC can't have it both ways, says the ACLU of Massachusetts.
[00:25:20.934 --> 00:25:25.958]  Either it's a public entity, subject to public record laws, or what it's doing is illegal.
[00:25:25.978 --> 00:25:30.021]  They say, if police agencies hide behind a wall of secrecy,
[00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:36.868]  The public can't judge for itself whether the officials are acting appropriately or whether policy changes are needed.
[00:25:36.888 --> 00:25:40.652]  See, that's the problem with everything that the government is doing.
[00:25:41.293 --> 00:25:46.058]  Everything that the government is doing, no matter what agency we talk to, they don't want to talk to us.
[00:25:47.139 --> 00:25:52.482]  Go talk to our public information officer, go give them a phone call, send them an email, whatever.
[00:25:52.522 --> 00:25:53.463]  They never get back to us.
[00:25:53.523 --> 00:25:58.166]  If we show up to talk to them, they get angry with us because we're practicing quote-unquote ambush journalism.
[00:25:58.526 --> 00:25:59.106]  Well, you know what?
[00:25:59.386 --> 00:26:06.451]  We're going to expose it because we're not going to have a government that thinks that it's above the law, that thinks that it can operate in secrecy.
[00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:16.277]  Whether you're talking about an airport or any kind of municipal organization or whether you're talking about the CIA, there needs to be transparency, there needs to be oversight, there needs to be information to the public.
[00:26:16.837 --> 00:26:23.240]  Well, we have another article up on InfoWars, ten facts about the SWATification of America that everybody should know.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.081]  And here are those ten facts.
[00:26:26.121 --> 00:26:28.462]  Here's the top ten facts about SWAT teams.
[00:26:29.062 --> 00:26:34.124]  Number one, in 1980 there were approximately 3,000 SWAT raids in the United States.
[00:26:34.884 --> 00:26:40.627]  Now, there are 80,000 SWAT raids per year in this country, about 30 times.
[00:26:41.843 --> 00:26:46.528]  Number two, 79% of the time SWAT teams are deployed to private homes.
[00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:51.432]  Number three, 50% of the victims of SWAT raids are either black or Latino.
[00:26:52.073 --> 00:27:01.923]  Number four, in 65% of SWAT deployments, a battering ram, a boot, or some sort of explosive device is used to gain forced entry into a home.
[00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:07.706]  Number five, 62% of all SWAT raids involve a search for drugs.
[00:27:07.806 --> 00:27:10.008]  See, this all started with the war on drugs.
[00:27:10.068 --> 00:27:12.789]  Now they're going to expand this into the war on terror.
[00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:20.234]  Six, in at least 36% of all SWAT raids, no contraband of any kind is found by the police.
[00:27:20.474 --> 00:27:23.456]  Number seven, in cases where it's suspected there's a weapon in the home,
[00:27:24.465 --> 00:27:26.987]  Police only find a weapon 35% of the time.
[00:27:27.387 --> 00:27:27.608]  Number 8.
[00:27:28.248 --> 00:27:35.194]  More than 100 American families have their homes raided by SWAT teams every single day.
[00:27:35.494 --> 00:27:40.218]  This was an important point that was made yesterday when I talked to Cheryl Chumley in the book Police State USA.
[00:27:40.498 --> 00:27:42.520]  We sell it here at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.304]  She was saying there's a perception of a lot of people that these things are few and far between.
[00:27:48.004 --> 00:27:49.485]  She knows better, we know better.
[00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:53.588]  When we're looking at this on InfoWars, there's so much of this out there that we can't cover it all.
[00:27:53.608 --> 00:28:13.524]  So you only hear about the most egregious cases, where they come in and they throw a flashbang grenade into the crib of an 18-month-old baby, severely, severely damaging that child, blowing up his face, blowing up his ribcage to the extent that his ribs are exposed.
[00:28:14.224 --> 00:28:19.946]  Number 9, only 7% of all SWAT deployments are for hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios.
[00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:20.286]  See that?
[00:28:20.506 --> 00:28:20.786]  Only 7%.
[00:28:21.987 --> 00:28:24.728]  And that's the article we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about.
[00:28:25.608 --> 00:28:37.892]  We see a tweet that was put out, where a guy says, well, when ISIS comes a-calling in America, they're going to forget about all these babies that have flashbangs, grenades thrown into their cribs.
[00:28:38.272 --> 00:28:43.956]  Well, only 7% of SWAT deployments are for hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios.
[00:28:44.457 --> 00:28:48.860]  And the last one, number 10, even small towns are getting SWAT teams now.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:55.325]  30 years ago, only 25% of communities with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 people had a SWAT team.
[00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:58.687]  Now, 80% of the small teams do.
[00:28:59.227 --> 00:29:02.570]  And so, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the next segment.
[00:29:03.795 --> 00:29:05.156]  about this article that he put up today.
[00:29:05.216 --> 00:29:10.038]  Law enforcement firm says nobody will complain about the militarized police when ISIS attack.
[00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:16.261]  And I ask the question, how are we going to tell the difference between the SWAT teams and the terrorists?
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.401]  How do we know the difference?
[00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:19.542]  They both wear masks.
[00:29:20.122 --> 00:29:21.884]  They're both throwing grenades at people.
[00:29:21.924 --> 00:29:23.245]  They both kill innocent people.
[00:29:23.285 --> 00:29:24.606]  They both brag about it.
[00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:28.249]  They both use violence to achieve political ends.
[00:29:28.749 --> 00:29:31.371]  And they both say they aren't government agents.
[00:29:31.852 --> 00:29:33.413]  When actually we know they both are.
[00:29:33.653 --> 00:29:35.595]  The terrorist, including the SWAT team.
[00:29:35.615 --> 00:29:38.617]  So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson right after the break.
[00:29:38.637 --> 00:29:41.560]  We're going to find out what's behind this arrogance.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.343]  And we have a very optimistic take on the future.
[00:29:45.823 --> 00:29:47.463]  So we're going to talk about that as well.
[00:29:47.523 --> 00:29:48.784]  We can roll this thing back.
[00:29:48.844 --> 00:29:50.004]  We can do it peacefully.
[00:29:50.084 --> 00:29:55.446]  We can have a revolution that results in more individual liberty, not in a police state.
[00:29:55.686 --> 00:29:56.146]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.206 --> 00:29:59.106]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.587 --> 00:30:01.187]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.127 --> 00:30:04.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:15.213]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:19.595]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:19.976 --> 00:30:24.538]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:27.560]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:33.064]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:33.325 --> 00:30:40.210]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.473]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:44.853 --> 00:30:49.637]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:49.977 --> 00:30:50.818]  This is innovating.
[00:30:51.098 --> 00:30:58.385]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:02.629]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:08.014]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:11.482]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:31:12.023 --> 00:31:18.967]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:31:19.447 --> 00:31:29.874]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:31:30.275 --> 00:31:39.501]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:43.662]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:47.723]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:31:48.063 --> 00:31:49.623]  Experience the new formula.
[00:31:50.123 --> 00:31:52.084]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:31:52.684 --> 00:31:53.644]  Shield your family.
[00:31:54.024 --> 00:31:55.404]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:32:08.171 --> 00:32:15.255]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:15.355 --> 00:32:17.497]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:17.697 --> 00:32:22.800]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:28.003]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:28.143 --> 00:32:31.165]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:31.465 --> 00:32:35.308]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:35.528 --> 00:32:39.772]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:39.852 --> 00:32:49.900]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.602]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:32:52.782 --> 00:33:00.849]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:33:18.653 --> 00:33:22.779]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.982]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.212 --> 00:33:30.473]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.533 --> 00:33:34.595]  I'm David Knight in Austin and I'm joined now by Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:39.558]  We want to talk about some of the articles that he put up today just before the break.
[00:33:40.078 --> 00:33:46.861]  I gave you the headline, Law Enforcement Firm, Nobody Will Complain About Militarized Police When ISIS Attacks.
[00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:47.982]  That's a tweet they put out.
[00:33:48.082 --> 00:33:49.163]  In other words, instead of
[00:33:50.063 --> 00:33:59.490]  Instead of saying, you know, maybe we went too far, maybe we need to examine what we do when we are killing innocent people, when we're throwing grenades into babies' cribs.
[00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.692]  Instead he says, hey, you're going to want us when the terrorists come.
[00:34:03.172 --> 00:34:13.680]  And Paul, I ask, when it's the government's policy to terrorize us and intimidate us with things like SWAT raids and militarized vehicles, how do we tell these guys from the terrorists?
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.182]  I mean, they both wear masks, they seem to operate in the same way.
[00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.790]  It's becoming increasingly difficult, isn't it, David?
[00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:35.800]  I mean, this arrives in the context of this big ACLU report investigation which you mentioned before the break, which basically describes the United States as a war zone with the increase in these SWAT team raids, injuries and deaths since 2010 are through the roof.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.382]  You mentioned before the break 80,000 SWAT raids per year now.
[00:34:40.422 --> 00:34:41.403]  That's actually up from
[00:34:42.884 --> 00:34:48.748]  45,000 in 2005, so in just the course of the last eight years that figure has almost doubled.
[00:34:49.508 --> 00:34:57.294]  So now you've got this story today which is out of a company that provides video training programs for law enforcement.
[00:34:57.334 --> 00:34:59.536]  I believe it's run by ex-law enforcement officials.
[00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:17.086]  And basically they reference infants like Boo Boo, who was the 18-month toddler, critically injured, brain damaged, still in intensive care, after a SWAT team member threw a flashbang grenade into his crib during a raid near Atlanta recently.
[00:35:17.806 --> 00:35:28.372]  Of course they also mention ISIS, which is the insurgent group in Iraq that's taken over key towns in Iraq, which of course, members of which were trained by the US government in Jordan, that's seldom mentioned.
[00:35:28.712 --> 00:35:29.093]  Exactly.
[00:35:29.853 --> 00:35:43.763]  In this Facebook post they say, when this militarization of LEAs, law enforcement agencies, affects infants like Boo Boo, the public's going to be righteously outraged, but someday when ISIS comes a-calling, who will be complaining then?
[00:35:44.323 --> 00:35:45.664]  So as he said, they're basically...
[00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:54.650]  Saying that when the terrorists attack, this militarisation of police will be necessary, will be needed, and in fact will be called for by the American people.
[00:35:55.051 --> 00:36:05.117]  So it's a completely outrageous comment in light of the fact that this poor toddler remains in intensive care, could die from his injuries after this disgraceful SWAT team attack.
[00:36:06.218 --> 00:36:27.069]  And they link to the Guardian article about this big ACLU report about how the SWAT teams, the police, are becoming increasingly militarized and they basically just dismiss it as necessary in light of ISIS, which is a group that the US government, the Obama administration, was partly responsible for creating through their support of jihadists in Syria.
[00:36:27.389 --> 00:36:28.130]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:39.199]  And like this other article that we have from Mikhail Thelin, you've got a regional SWAT team, says, we're not a public agency, we don't need to respond to requests for information from the ACLU.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:51.370]  I mean, you know, both the SWAT team there, as well as ISIS, you know, they're both trained by the government, equipped by our government, and they both claim that they don't work for our government, and yet they're using these kind of terrorist tactics.
[00:36:51.910 --> 00:37:00.635]  You know, you mentioned, Paul, that this is an organization that tweeted this in the line of duty that trains people, and that's really where the problem is coming from.
[00:37:00.895 --> 00:37:11.921]  It's coming from the people who train them, and they're being trained by Homeland Security to have these kinds of rules of engagement to look at America as a war zone.
[00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:20.126]  You know, out in New Mexico, when everybody saw that homeless man shot for illegal camping and was outraged, they don't really care about that.
[00:37:20.746 --> 00:37:45.123]  uh... the police in new mexico they have a curriculum in new mexico in the state uh... academy for the police a shoot first curriculum they had instructor who resigned because he refused to teach that kind of curriculum and so they look at this as a war zone and that should make us all the more afraid of the fact that they justify these assassinations abroad uh... with drones as saying that well it's a war zone
[00:37:45.703 --> 00:38:04.845]  We need to understand that they see the entire world as a war zone, so when they put things like the NDAA, where they say the military can indefinitely detain people, they can transport them for torture, whatever, when they put that in and say, well, that's when it's a war zone, we need to understand that they recognize America now as a war zone.
[00:38:06.638 --> 00:38:15.249]  Precisely, because this flashbang tactic, that is a military tactic that was used against insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:38:15.369 --> 00:38:19.354]  It's just like the armoured vehicles are being brought home to be used against the American people.
[00:38:19.774 --> 00:38:22.678]  That military tactic is now being used against the American people.
[00:38:23.038 --> 00:38:25.421]  And in the Guardian article there are several other examples where
[00:38:26.402 --> 00:38:31.406]  Children have been injured and even killed by these flashbang grenade attacks, as it were.
[00:38:31.466 --> 00:38:34.929]  So they're using military tactics that were used against terrorists previously.
[00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:44.316]  There are even, for example, a mayor in Illinois called out a SWAT team to search the house of someone who had poked fun at him on a Twitter account.
[00:38:44.736 --> 00:38:49.520]  So they're using SWAT teams as their little private armies to go after people who merely express dissent.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.621]  And as he said,
[00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:53.322]  They're concerned about transparency.
[00:38:53.362 --> 00:38:57.323]  That's why they don't want to release any more details because there's growing outrage about this.
[00:38:57.783 --> 00:39:07.907]  And another new factor is now we've got pro-police state Facebook pages which solely exist to scoff at real cases of police brutality.
[00:39:08.507 --> 00:39:13.091]  In an attempt to get these anti-police brutality Facebook pages shut down.
[00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:24.820]  So just like, you know, governments hire people to troll websites, to troll comment sections, now there are entire Facebook cliques, groups that go after people who are complaining about police brutality.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:34.188]  So again, it shows that the desperate attempt to cover up this police brutality as its endemic spread begins to dominate social media as more people are becoming aware of it.
[00:39:34.748 --> 00:39:36.129]  It's an information war, isn't it?
[00:39:36.689 --> 00:39:42.092]  And we have to educate the public as to what's going on.
[00:39:42.112 --> 00:39:46.154]  That's why I talked to Cheryl Trumley yesterday about her book, Police State USA.
[00:39:46.694 --> 00:39:49.555]  People don't understand what's going on.
[00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:50.716]  And so that's what you're talking about.
[00:39:50.756 --> 00:39:51.316]  There's a war.
[00:39:51.376 --> 00:39:56.959]  And they're pushing back with, as you point out, pro-police state Facebook pages and social media.
[00:39:57.059 --> 00:40:03.722]  And we know that they hire government trolls to troll our website, to troll other places, to push back on comments against that.
[00:40:04.182 --> 00:40:10.948]  But one of the things that I think we really need to stress to people is how this is really being done by the military-industrial complex.
[00:40:10.968 --> 00:40:18.114]  The same people that have given us unending wars since the end of World War II for profit are now bringing those wars home.
[00:40:18.574 --> 00:40:20.556]  They've made a lot of money out of the war on drugs.
[00:40:20.596 --> 00:40:22.798]  They won a war on terrorism here domestically.
[00:40:23.078 --> 00:40:28.403]  They sell a lot of equipment to these police departments, to the federal government, which then
[00:40:28.883 --> 00:40:51.505]  Donates them to the police departments because it's the homeland security that is Driving all this change and the police that's militarizing the police and centralizing control But we really need to look at all of these quote-unquote Non-lethal techniques that they're using against everybody as you pointed out you know the flashbang grenades the beanbag shotguns that they just killed a World War two vet that was in his 90s with
[00:40:52.185 --> 00:41:02.350]  Tasers, where they're tasering people and people are getting permanently brain damaged when they hit the ground or die from that, in many cases from a heart attack or from the fall that they have.
[00:41:02.971 --> 00:41:14.377]  These non-lethal things that are being sold by the military-industrial complex to police departments are not non-lethal and they've got a lot more in the pipeline, as you pointed out in recent weeks.
[00:41:14.417 --> 00:41:18.139]  I think it was you that had the article about the pepper-spraying drone?
[00:41:19.704 --> 00:41:20.845]  Yeah, that was my brother, yeah.
[00:41:21.365 --> 00:41:22.506]  They're building an arsenal.
[00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:30.972]  I mean, you know, the guy who trained Fallujah Forces Iraqi soldiers said that Homeland Security is building a domestic army.
[00:41:31.352 --> 00:41:37.337]  That was during his testimony against New Hampshire's purchase of one of these Bearcat armoured vehicles.
[00:41:37.897 --> 00:41:49.739]  And in fact, the police chief, in justifying the purchase of that vehicle, wrote in his application that it was needed to deal with the threat posed by libertarians and Occupy activists.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.801]  So the police in that state brazenly admitted that this was to deal with political dissidents.
[00:41:56.541 --> 00:42:01.322]  As he said, 7% used against barricaded, potentially violent criminals in the home.
[00:42:01.822 --> 00:42:02.922]  That's a minority.
[00:42:03.422 --> 00:42:06.543]  The real purpose is to terrify people, to intimidate them.
[00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:24.089]  And in fact there's another story which is coming out after the show ends which centres around Walton County Sheriff's Office and like hundreds of other local police departments they've got their hands on one of these MRAP armoured vehicles for basically next to nothing, the cost to go and pick it up from the Department of Defence.
[00:42:24.889 --> 00:42:27.590]  And what's so ludicrous about this example is
[00:42:28.607 --> 00:42:41.577]  This county, Walton County, is considered so idyllic that it was used as the setting for the 1998 movie The Truman Show to illustrate an area so perfect and quaint that it appeared to be fake.
[00:42:42.017 --> 00:42:43.739]  So this is an area so perfect
[00:42:44.199 --> 00:42:53.483]  Virtually crime-free, it's described as, and yet the police have just purchased an armoured vehicle that was used to hunt down insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:42:53.823 --> 00:42:58.625]  And basically the residents are completely freaking out, they're complaining on the Facebook pages.
[00:42:59.225 --> 00:43:09.750]  But again, it shows you, they will purchase the most insane, high-tech, brutal technology and use it against towns and counties that are virtually crime-free.
[00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.873]  Perfect, quaint areas which shows you exactly the purpose.
[00:43:13.913 --> 00:43:16.074]  It's not to fight armed, dangerous criminals.
[00:43:16.175 --> 00:43:17.696]  It's to intimidate the American people.
[00:43:18.176 --> 00:43:25.822]  And you know, the very definition of terrorism is when you use violence or the threat of violence to achieve political means.
[00:43:26.022 --> 00:43:26.242]  That's
[00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.672]  We need to come up with a system where we can review the police.
[00:43:47.753 --> 00:43:57.459]  The police are really out of control and in most cases, you know, you can vote for a sheriff and you can get a sheriff out of office, but the police chiefs are not elected.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.803]  So it's very difficult for us to get a foot in the door to try to get some oversight.
[00:44:02.863 --> 00:44:08.847]  That's why I think the federal government has focused on the police departments to really militarize things.
[00:44:09.548 --> 00:44:22.604]  Before we run out of time, because I've just got you here for this half hour, I want to talk about this other article that went up today about this ex-CIA officer who says that open source revolution is about to overthrow the global oligarchy.
[00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:27.663]  Yeah, this is basically a continuation of the theme we were talking about yesterday.
[00:44:28.003 --> 00:44:32.906]  It's an interview by The Guardian conducted with ex-CIA spy Robert David Steele.
[00:44:33.586 --> 00:44:51.215]  And it's a complex issue, so people need to read the article, but basically he's saying that we're going to see a bottom-up, grassroots, voluntarist, network-style revolution, an open-source revolution, which will be enough to defeat the hierarchical, top-down, imposed control that we're currently labouring under.
[00:44:52.336 --> 00:45:00.702]  You know, the tools of revolution are already in our hands and are going to become more potent in terms of self-empowerment and escaping the system.
[00:45:01.142 --> 00:45:08.687]  So, you know, just as the Internet has given us information freedom, for example, crypto currencies are going to provide us with financial freedom.
[00:45:09.368 --> 00:45:12.390]  3D printing is going to provide us with consumer freedom.
[00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.432]  And all the main, he basically makes the point
[00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:26.418]  That all the major preconditions for revolution, and we talked about this yesterday with the food riots and so forth, now exist in the United States, Britain and other developed Western countries.
[00:45:26.879 --> 00:45:37.385]  Because the elite are rapidly losing control over the power of information itself, and therefore are finding it harder to maintain this centralized control over human beings.
[00:45:37.825 --> 00:45:44.789]  So this technology, this open source revolution that he talks about, is allowing us to become less dependent on the system,
[00:45:45.129 --> 00:45:52.034]  We're seeing more grassroots, voluntarist networks of people working together with technology, with cryptocurrencies.
[00:45:53.114 --> 00:45:56.897]  It's having the effect of making us less dependent on their rigged system.
[00:45:56.937 --> 00:46:04.041]  So when you've got, you know, millions and millions of people working on this technology, really smart people, that's going to turn the tide.
[00:46:04.462 --> 00:46:13.908]  And it doesn't matter how many armoured vehicles they buy, when the fundamental foundation of society is shifted and empowerment comes back to the people, to the grassroots,
[00:46:14.548 --> 00:46:17.930]  That is game over for anybody who wants this global oligarchy.
[00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:22.733]  Yeah, you know, that's I think the key thing, is that can we out-innovate them?
[00:46:23.353 --> 00:46:30.918]  Can we get the people who are top scientists, who are top developers, can we get them to work in their own interests?
[00:46:31.178 --> 00:46:35.781]  Instead of in the interest of a small elite who want to control everybody.
[00:46:36.101 --> 00:46:37.322]  That's really I think the question.
[00:46:37.722 --> 00:46:40.043]  And of course the high ground is going to be the internet.
[00:46:40.103 --> 00:46:44.746]  It's going to be free speech and whether or not we can keep that out of the hands of the government.
[00:46:44.786 --> 00:46:48.488]  The government is doing everything they can to attack it from every different angle.
[00:46:48.528 --> 00:46:56.173]  I mean you've even got a key component of these trade agreements is essentially bringing in internet censorship in the name of copyright enforcement.
[00:46:56.933 --> 00:47:04.275]  They couldn't get that passed in any of the legislatures in America or in Europe, and so they're trying to bring that in in the back door in these trade agreements.
[00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:13.818]  But then we also see a major realignment going on in the United States with the FCC coming in and now asserting that it has regulatory control over the Internet.
[00:47:14.378 --> 00:47:31.970]  And then trying to shut down net neutrality at the same time it appears that they're going to approve a merger of Comcast and so they're going to make this gigantic centralized control from a corporate standpoint to try to control not only content but especially the pipelines of the Internet.
[00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:34.151]  So this is a battle that's going back and forth.
[00:47:34.472 --> 00:47:35.893]  I think we need to get people to
[00:47:36.773 --> 00:47:49.904]  Look at this, we've had a lot of stories, a lot of movies about soldiers who went to war for the highest motivations and then realized that they were being used, that they'd been betrayed, that they'd been deceived, and then doing the right thing.
[00:47:50.464 --> 00:47:53.507]  I've not seen that so much about engineers and scientists.
[00:47:53.627 --> 00:48:03.797]  The only time I can remember seeing that recently was in the latest Bourne movie where you've got this scientist who starts talking about what she did to Bourne and the other people and she gets this gleam in her eye.
[00:48:03.837 --> 00:48:14.167]  She's very excited about the technological breakthrough that she came up with and just the idea of what she's doing and then he kind of stares at her and she kind of pauses a moment and says,
[00:48:15.348 --> 00:48:21.172]  Oh yeah, you know, and kind of realizes, has an aha moment about the consequences of her technology.
[00:48:21.192 --> 00:48:26.395]  I think that's what we need to really drive home to scientists and engineers is to think about the consequences.
[00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.839]  Well, precisely, because technology is neutral.
[00:48:29.859 --> 00:48:31.240]  It depends on who's in control of it.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.082]  But, as you said, it's regulation versus decentralization, isn't it?
[00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:38.963]  That's the battle, and I think it's a battle that we can win, and we are winning.
[00:48:39.544 --> 00:48:50.529]  A quote, a really good quote out of the article is from Steele, his former CIA agent, is, Top-down power has failed in a most spectacular manner, and bottom-up consensus power is emerging.
[00:48:51.049 --> 00:48:54.691]  Not in my neighborhood is beginning to trump because I say so.
[00:48:55.171 --> 00:48:58.374]  The one unlimited resource we have on this planet is the human brain.
[00:48:58.914 --> 00:49:08.101]  So again, he's talking about people rejecting the dictates of the organised oligarchy from above, which is losing its power because it's losing the power to centralise control.
[00:49:08.742 --> 00:49:21.592]  And that's causing the emergence of these decentralised networks that are using technology to help people free themselves and become less dependent on the state in terms of consumerism, information and financial freedom.
[00:49:21.632 --> 00:49:24.174]  So with all that coming together, with technology improving,
[00:49:24.634 --> 00:49:25.595]  That's the positive.
[00:49:25.635 --> 00:49:32.524]  That's a really optimistic take that we can draw from this article and I really encourage people to go and read it at The Guardian.
[00:49:32.564 --> 00:49:35.227]  It's also linked on Infowars and featured stories today.
[00:49:35.728 --> 00:49:36.769]  Yeah, there's another quote in there.
[00:49:36.809 --> 00:49:37.049]  He says,
[00:49:43.337 --> 00:49:49.364]  And contrasting that to the, you know, because I say so at the point of a gun, that's a key thing.
[00:49:49.584 --> 00:49:52.467]  Truth rather than violence as the currency of power.
[00:49:52.507 --> 00:50:00.535]  Boy, I certainly hope that is what's going to happen because, you know, Paul, I've spoken many times about the book The Fourth Turning by Strauss and Howe.
[00:50:00.756 --> 00:50:04.540]  I think that that's very important research, that they've gone back.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:18.551]  Back to the middle 1400s through American and English history, looking at a cycle that about every 80 years there's a massive generational, it's driven by generations, and there's a massive change in society about every 80 years or so.
[00:50:19.212 --> 00:50:30.160]  And we're coming up to that, and that just so happens to coincide with the time frame that so many of these central planners and futurist thinkers have been talking about with everything, the 2020 to 2025 time frame.
[00:50:32.542 --> 00:50:33.102]  Yes, we are.
[00:50:48.647 --> 00:50:51.770]  Harassed by his homeowners association when we come back from the break.
[00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.011]  That's just pretty impressive.
[00:50:53.071 --> 00:51:07.183]  That's pretty amazing It's one of the reasons why I won't own a home where there's a homeowners association sometimes Democracy gets out of control and it happens even at the lowest levels when you don't have protection for individual rights We'll be right back
[00:51:09.105 --> 00:51:12.288]  Every business owner knows how tough it is to get financing for their business.
[00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:17.574]  Whether the cash is needed for expansion, repairs, or growth, when you need financing, you need a reliable source.
[00:51:17.794 --> 00:51:21.438]  Banks are happy to hold your deposits, but don't bother to ask them for a business loan.
[00:51:21.558 --> 00:51:26.623]  For 10 years, Merchant Capital Source has been helping small businesses just like yours get the money they need.
[00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:34.412]  If your business needs as much as $250,000, Merchant Capital Source can deliver in as little as 3-5 days, even if you have poor credit.
[00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:40.540]  If you've been in business for 6 months and produce at least $15,000 in monthly sales, there's a good chance you'll qualify.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.922]  And talk about hassle-free.
[00:51:42.122 --> 00:51:45.326]  We don't need to see your tax returns, financial statements, or business plans.
[00:51:45.546 --> 00:51:45.987]  We're good to go.
[00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.191]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.451 --> 00:52:16.292]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.552 --> 00:52:24.435]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:28.996]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.196 --> 00:52:33.017]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.177 --> 00:52:38.878]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.118 --> 00:52:41.899]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.279 --> 00:52:47.500]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:53:08.245 --> 00:53:11.686]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:53:11.926 --> 00:53:15.647]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:53:15.727 --> 00:53:21.649]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.290]  Genetically modified crops
[00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:32.019]  Processed foods and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[00:53:32.119 --> 00:53:36.604]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragetix.

[00:54:21.955 --> 00:54:23.356]  It's not a flag on a pole.
[00:54:23.416 --> 00:54:25.716]  In fact, it is barely noticeable.
[00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:30.438]  It's a flag in a flower pot, sitting right here at the front door.
[00:54:31.378 --> 00:54:36.640]  And the HOA in this community is telling the homeowner, the flag has got to go.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.201]  The homeowner is Larry Murphree, and he's drawn a line in the sand.
[00:54:41.481 --> 00:54:47.123]  They're trying to kick out a foreclosure on my house, so the house could go.
[00:54:47.663 --> 00:54:49.504]  So that's why the flag's upside down.
[00:54:49.964 --> 00:54:52.727]  Muffrey lives in the Times condominium at Sweetwater.
[00:54:53.168 --> 00:54:57.993]  The HOA allows flags to be flown in certain locations during daylight hours.
[00:54:58.634 --> 00:55:02.959]  Muffrey fought the HOA several years ago and that case was settled.
[00:55:03.279 --> 00:55:04.801]  They settled and
[00:55:04.841 --> 00:55:06.402]  I thought that would be the end of it.
[00:55:06.562 --> 00:55:07.762]  Pretty amazing story.
[00:55:07.862 --> 00:55:09.843]  And I've got Paul Joseph Watson on the line.
[00:55:09.903 --> 00:55:12.104]  He's got that story up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:12.144 --> 00:55:17.026]  A 73-year-old veteran threatened with foreclosure for displaying an American flag.
[00:55:17.067 --> 00:55:19.828]  Of course, this is his homeowners association that's coming after him.
[00:55:19.848 --> 00:55:22.529]  Paul, that's a pretty amazing story.
[00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:25.330]  I've seen homeowners associations do some pretty outrageous things.
[00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:31.273]  They're trying to foreclose on him with an $8,000 lien that they've put on him, a fine.
[00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:36.671]  Yeah, all for displaying a tiny American flag in a plant pot.
[00:55:37.131 --> 00:55:46.621]  What's even more ludicrous about this story is this 70-year-old veteran, Larry Murphree, actually settled out of court with them from a previous dispute about the same issue.
[00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:51.305]  Then they came back, made another rule that specifically targeted him, saying that
[00:55:51.966 --> 00:55:57.248]  Homeowners couldn't have any unauthorized objects in their plant pots or foliage.
[00:55:57.889 --> 00:56:02.350]  So, of course, then he violated that law, even though it's his right to do so.
[00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:06.472]  Legal experts have said that the Florida statute says he can display the flag.
[00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:09.634]  So they slapped him with an $8,000 fine.
[00:56:09.674 --> 00:56:15.556]  He's being fined $100 a day for every day he displays this tiny flag, which is barely noticeable.
[00:56:16.036 --> 00:56:18.978]  And now they've, as you said, filed for foreclosure on his house.
[00:56:19.978 --> 00:56:23.661]  As I said before the break, you know, democracy doesn't always work out for the best.
[00:56:23.701 --> 00:56:32.466]  This is why America's a republic, why it has the Constitution to protect individual rights, because, you know, they just go ahead.
[00:56:32.647 --> 00:56:41.112]  I wonder if these are some people who have moved down to New York from Bloomberg's New York, where they have just learned that you can just arbitrarily ban anything you don't like.
[00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:49.758]  It's the size of the soda that you drink, you don't like this guy's American flag, you just ban it and they've got to get prior approval from you before they put it up.
[00:56:51.159 --> 00:57:02.984]  I think that they're taking their mandate from the state, from the government, because of course we've had numerous stories over the past few years about cities harassing residents for having vegetable gardens in their front yard.
[00:57:03.404 --> 00:57:14.509]  So whereas this isn't government, this is homeowners association, they're kind of taking their cue from that oppressive tyranny that we've seen, disallowing people from doing what they want to do, having vegetable gardens.
[00:57:14.929 --> 00:57:15.189]  And again,
[00:57:15.529 --> 00:57:29.477]  You know, it represents this kind of clash between the mindsets of rugged individualism, which is what most Americans used to embrace, and this new kind of tattletale power trip collectivism, the example for which is being set by the state.
[00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:36.961]  So it's no surprise that this homeowners association is harassing this man for having this barely noticeable flag in his front yard.
[00:57:37.381 --> 00:57:44.303]  And you know, there might be more to it than just a little power trip by these people who may have a personal dispute with this guy.
[00:57:45.023 --> 00:57:50.785]  As you pointed out in the article, it was just last week that we had that happen in Texas in an apartment.
[00:57:51.285 --> 00:57:56.546]  They said that this guy hanging an American flag from his balcony was an affront to the Muslim community.
[00:57:56.566 --> 00:57:57.927]  You know, American flags
[00:57:59.067 --> 00:58:07.450]  We're told are an affront to Muslims, to people who come here from Mexico, and we just need to ban those things and hide that.
[00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:13.132]  No, I've seen the same thing in Britain, where it's now frowned upon to fly St.
[00:58:13.172 --> 00:58:15.693]  George's flag because it might offend some minorities.
[00:58:15.713 --> 00:58:21.774]  And again, in Texas and other areas on Cinco de Mayo, we've had students kicked out of school for wearing American flag t-shirts.
[00:58:21.814 --> 00:58:26.276]  So across the board, they're frowning on the display of any kind of patriotism whatsoever.
[00:58:26.496 --> 00:58:26.836]  That's right.
[00:58:26.876 --> 00:58:28.418]  We've got to ban those symbols.
[00:58:28.958 --> 00:58:42.690]  And that really touches on that article that you had yesterday, which I encourage people to read, that's up on Drudge today, where he's talking about how they're bringing in the massive demographic surge because they want to educate these people from the bottom up.
[00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.272]  And that's really what I think it's all about.
[00:58:44.552 --> 00:58:45.132]  Thank you so much.
[00:58:45.232 --> 00:58:46.814]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:58:46.834 --> 00:58:47.675]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:49.456 --> 00:58:51.138]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:54.879]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:58.886 --> 00:59:04.988]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:08.348]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:59:08.368 --> 00:59:10.049]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:16.350]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:22.352]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:59:22.512 --> 00:59:26.275]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:59:26.455 --> 00:59:29.337]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:37.563]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:59:37.823 --> 00:59:39.865]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:59:39.925 --> 00:59:40.946]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:59:41.326 --> 00:59:50.072]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:59:50.272 --> 00:59:52.713]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[01:00:01.839 --> 01:00:03.761]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.963]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.758 --> 01:00:18.942]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:20.403]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.085]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.726 --> 01:00:26.409]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:30.974]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.686 --> 01:00:35.467]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[01:00:35.587 --> 01:00:36.368]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:36.488 --> 01:00:42.032]  We're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour by Alex Jones in the form of a special report, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:00:42.052 --> 01:00:43.953]  You're going to want to stick around and hear that.
[01:00:44.013 --> 01:00:46.955]  We also have Gerald Salenti joining us in the third hour.
[01:00:47.015 --> 01:00:49.877]  We're going to talk to him about breaking economic news.
[01:00:49.997 --> 01:00:56.542]  Of course, Gerald Salenti of Trends Research is a great forecaster of economics and all kinds of trends.
[01:00:56.582 --> 01:00:57.623]  He has a lot to say.
[01:00:58.323 --> 01:00:59.424]  About the Iraq War.
[01:00:59.964 --> 01:01:02.165]  I guess it's what now, 11 years into it.
[01:01:02.345 --> 01:01:04.066]  And we see what's happened with that.
[01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:07.908]  So it's going to be interesting to hear Gerald Slinty's comments on that.
[01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:10.889]  Now we've just had some breaking news has come out.
[01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:12.530]  We've got a White House Press Secretary.
[01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:13.310]  Now this is the new guy.
[01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:14.511]  You know, they got rid of the Carney.
[01:01:15.011 --> 01:01:16.312]  Now they've got an earnest guy.
[01:01:16.812 --> 01:01:18.713]  This guy is Josh Earnest.
[01:01:18.813 --> 01:01:20.454]  And he's telling it straight.
[01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:22.495]  He says, we're not going to wait and just set it.
[01:01:22.535 --> 01:01:25.897]  We're not going to just sit around and wait for Congress to write the laws.
[01:01:25.937 --> 01:01:26.357]  That's right.
[01:01:26.977 --> 01:01:30.640]  Nobody's ever accused Obama of sitting around and waiting for the laws to be written.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.801]  They're just going to do whatever they wish.
[01:01:32.821 --> 01:01:37.124]  And you know, we've got a lot of examples of congressional scoff laws here.
[01:01:37.144 --> 01:01:40.306]  I've got a whole little clip here of a bunch of these things.
[01:01:40.606 --> 01:01:45.269]  We've got Nancy Pelosi scoffing at the idea that the House GOP would file a lawsuit.
[01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:56.437]  She says, not only have we not passed an immigration bill, they have used the President's action to protect some vulnerable parties as a basis to sue the President.
[01:01:57.037 --> 01:02:01.659]  Well, the question is, you know, would Obama really obey a new law on immigration?
[01:02:02.379 --> 01:02:04.800]  I mean, would Homeland Security obey the laws?
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.741]  Would the illegal aliens obey the laws?
[01:02:08.261 --> 01:02:11.022]  I mean, do we really need to worry about immigration reform?
[01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:12.322]  I think we're just beyond that, right?
[01:02:12.342 --> 01:02:19.665]  We just do whatever the President wishes to do or whatever Homeland Security wants to see our country become.
[01:02:19.705 --> 01:02:22.546]  They're going to make it happen that way, whether it's legal or not.
[01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:29.194]  And as Boehner said, he said, this isn't about impeachment, it's about faithfully executing the laws of our country.
[01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:34.831]  Well, you know, I'd like to see Boehner faithfully execute the laws of this country and impeach this guy.
[01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:43.055]  How many times does he have to break the law blatantly in our face, declare that he's not going to wait for laws to be passed, he's just going to do whatever he wants?
[01:02:43.575 --> 01:02:44.976]  How long does that have to go on?
[01:02:44.996 --> 01:02:48.338]  You know, we've got some more information coming out about the IRS.
[01:02:48.378 --> 01:02:55.402]  We've got IRS officials, we now learn, were thinking about doing an audit of a GOP senator.
[01:02:55.462 --> 01:02:57.323]  That would be Chuck Grassley.
[01:02:58.311 --> 01:03:10.577]  And what happened was these emails, supposedly, she claims, the lady who lost all of her emails, according to her, she claims that somehow she got Chuck Grassley's emails.
[01:03:13.138 --> 01:03:14.058]  How do you figure that?
[01:03:14.238 --> 01:03:22.022]  Somehow they just got rerouted to her, and she just happened to notice that he was doing something that she thought she could audit him for, you know?
[01:03:23.483 --> 01:03:23.803]  Come on.
[01:03:24.443 --> 01:03:31.349]  We've talked about this many times, even if I did a special report talking about what are the probabilities of her disk drive going out.
[01:03:31.689 --> 01:03:50.085]  You know, even if you say that it's a normal disk drive, we've got a mean time between failure of five years, what are the probabilities of her disk drive going out and six other people's going out at the same time that all have emails that people need for a fraud investigation, for criminal action?
[01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.486]  What's the chances of that happening?
[01:03:51.846 --> 01:03:59.633]  And then, of course, there were people who said that their disk drives were actually RAID arrays that have a mean time between failure of 500 years.
[01:03:59.894 --> 01:04:01.295]  You know, there's not a chance.
[01:04:02.156 --> 01:04:10.143]  And not only that, but we know that's giving them the benefit of the doubt, saying that they're telling us the truth, that it's stored only on their disk drives.
[01:04:10.384 --> 01:04:11.845]  They're not stored on their disk drives.
[01:04:12.245 --> 01:04:16.429]  We've got tweets now from the company that says that it did the IRS backups.
[01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:20.352]  And of course they were required by law to back their data up.
[01:04:20.412 --> 01:04:22.293]  They weren't just keeping it on their hard drives.
[01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:24.715]  Even if they were, there's not a chance.
[01:04:24.915 --> 01:04:29.338]  Even if you take the chances of seven of these things going out at once is like 1 in 78,000.
[01:04:31.199 --> 01:04:32.380]  It's not a chance.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.280]  That's the truth.
[01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:34.841]  But that's not what's happening.
[01:04:34.881 --> 01:04:36.683]  They were being backed up by another company.
[01:04:37.023 --> 01:04:41.746]  And so what we need to do is we need to hold them to the same standards that they hold other people.
[01:04:41.786 --> 01:04:44.808]  You know, when you go to the IRS, you're not presumed to be innocent.
[01:04:45.468 --> 01:04:46.748]  You're presumed to be guilty.
[01:04:46.848 --> 01:04:51.510]  If they have reason to believe, if they bring charges against you, you have to prove your innocence.
[01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:53.250]  If you can't prove it, they convict you.
[01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.611]  That's what the House needs to do.
[01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:58.051]  Apply those same terms to them.
[01:04:58.432 --> 01:05:00.852]  Make them self-incriminate like they do taxpayers.
[01:05:01.232 --> 01:05:05.954]  Make them produce the records, and if they get rid of their records and don't hold them, they go to jail.
[01:05:06.034 --> 01:05:07.234]  Send them to jail, John Boehner.
[01:05:08.945 --> 01:05:10.826]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:05:11.167 --> 01:05:18.832]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:05:19.192 --> 01:05:26.497]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:31.040]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:41.524]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:41.965 --> 01:05:48.147]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:48.447 --> 01:05:50.688]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:50.708 --> 01:05:54.670]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.433]  It's not just the Supermail Vitality.
[01:05:56.793 --> 01:06:00.739]  All the products at InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[01:06:08.726 --> 01:06:12.708]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:06:12.748 --> 01:06:16.870]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:20.532]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:23.673]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:31.177]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:06:31.397 --> 01:06:35.039]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:06:35.299 --> 01:06:39.561]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:06:39.721 --> 01:06:45.643]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:49.464]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:52.165]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:06:52.365 --> 01:06:53.705]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:06:53.865 --> 01:06:55.106]  It's time to take action.
[01:06:55.226 --> 01:06:56.946]  It's time to filter our water.
[01:06:57.067 --> 01:07:04.189]  Visit Infowarsstore.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:15.032]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:19.433]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:07:19.793 --> 01:07:24.354]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:27.397]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:27.697 --> 01:07:32.881]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:33.142 --> 01:07:40.028]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:07:40.528 --> 01:07:44.311]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:07:44.672 --> 01:07:49.456]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:49.776 --> 01:07:58.201]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:07:58.221 --> 01:08:02.464]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:08:02.644 --> 01:08:08.187]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:10.228 --> 01:08:15.291]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:17.933]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:33.501]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and as I mentioned in the last break, we're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour by a special report from Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:51.869]  He's going to go back into the InfoWars archive to cover his arrest, shown in his first film, America Destroyed by Design, where he illustrated that biometrics are being implemented at driver's license facilities by way of thumbprint scanning in order to bring in a unified national ID card to set up checkpoints on highways and airports.
[01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:54.751]  That was a long time ago, guys.
[01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:56.052]  We've been talking about this.
[01:08:56.152 --> 01:08:58.694]  Alex Jones has been talking about this for decades.
[01:08:58.774 --> 01:09:00.816]  It was the first film that he did.
[01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.099]  And so he's going to show how this has all come true.
[01:09:04.259 --> 01:09:05.901]  We need people to wake up.
[01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:12.006]  That's exactly what we were saying yesterday when we talked to Cheryl Chumley about her book, Police State USA.
[01:09:12.026 --> 01:09:14.068]  Available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:09:14.468 --> 01:09:17.651]  People need to understand what's going on in America.
[01:09:18.211 --> 01:09:20.152]  And they need to understand where their rights come from.
[01:09:20.212 --> 01:09:21.873]  Those are the two core things.
[01:09:21.893 --> 01:09:29.396]  You need to know where we are, and you need to know what the foundation of our liberty, of our government, of our country was based upon.
[01:09:29.816 --> 01:09:32.737]  And that is that our rights come from God.
[01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:33.878]  They're inalienable.
[01:09:33.958 --> 01:09:34.878]  You can't take them.
[01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:37.959]  It was laid out in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:09:38.019 --> 01:09:43.422]  We create the government to protect those rights, not to give us security.
[01:09:44.369 --> 01:09:48.573]  If you give up your liberty for security, you will be a slave.
[01:09:48.693 --> 01:09:50.534]  Slaves don't have any freedom.
[01:09:51.255 --> 01:09:55.018]  And when you have maximum security, that's what they call a prison.
[01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:58.281]  And we're also going to be joined in the next hour by Gerald Salenti.
[01:09:58.321 --> 01:10:01.344]  He's going to talk about the latest economic news.
[01:10:01.424 --> 01:10:07.029]  We see a massive readjustment of decline in the gross domestic product from 1% to 3%.
[01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:16.312]  A lot of people are saying we're in a collapse and of course it's being spun in a lot of different ways by Obama and other people.
[01:10:16.352 --> 01:10:22.913]  They're even talking about how we're going to save money with responses to global warming.
[01:10:22.973 --> 01:10:26.654]  But they're blaming it on everything except what the government is doing.
[01:10:26.694 --> 01:10:28.855]  So we're going to be talking to Gerald Cilenti about that.
[01:10:29.455 --> 01:10:36.477]  Also about his take on Iraq 11 years after this whole thing began as we see it folding up in defeat.
[01:10:37.097 --> 01:10:39.659]  I want to hear what Gerald Cilenti has to say about that.
[01:10:39.739 --> 01:10:45.964]  But before I get to the rest of the news, I want to tell you that this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.
[01:10:45.984 --> 01:10:51.949]  The collapse of the border and soaring meat prices make it clear that there's no longer time to wait.
[01:10:52.409 --> 01:10:53.890]  You need to start getting prepared today.
[01:10:54.611 --> 01:10:59.452]  Get on over to MyPatriotSupply.com and check out their complete line of preparedness products.
[01:10:59.932 --> 01:11:04.133]  My Patriot Supply is the home of the Patriot Pantry line of emergency food storage.
[01:11:04.814 --> 01:11:08.615]  If you don't have food, you're no threat to the New World Order.
[01:11:09.155 --> 01:11:13.596]  They're counting on you to be ever-dependent slaves of their system of control, but you can fight back.
[01:11:14.116 --> 01:11:20.682]  You can establish independence for yourself, for your family, by securing your own private supply of storable food.
[01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:25.007]  And that's no better way than to prepare than with this patriot-owned company.
[01:11:26.138 --> 01:11:27.859]  Let me tell you, they're the real deal.
[01:11:28.179 --> 01:11:29.540]  Alex knows these guys.
[01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:32.962]  This is an operation that we're proud to support.
[01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:38.426]  Visit MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex for special offers to listeners of this broadcast.
[01:11:38.466 --> 01:11:42.749]  And for a limited time, they're offering additional discounts off of their already low prices.
[01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:47.332]  That site again is MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:11:48.752 --> 01:12:04.139]  And one of the signs that things are coming together, and there's so many, the collapsing borders, the collapsing economy, the collapsing legal structure that we have in this country, where people in the highest offices no longer even make a pretense of obeying the law.
[01:12:04.179 --> 01:12:12.082]  And of course in the last news segment I just mentioned the latest press release where Obama's press secretary said, we have no intention of waiting for laws to be passed.
[01:12:12.543 --> 01:12:14.544]  We're going to pursue our own immigration policy.
[01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:15.584]  It's like, really?
[01:12:15.604 --> 01:12:17.145]  I thought you were already.
[01:12:17.825 --> 01:12:22.726]  I thought you and Homeland Security were doing your own thing, independent of the laws, independent of the Constitution.
[01:12:23.266 --> 01:12:27.667]  But one of the ways that things are breaking down is we see also increased persecution.
[01:12:27.687 --> 01:12:31.527]  And this is going on with the Communist Chinese of churches.
[01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:41.549]  We have a story up on Infowars.com from the New American, Alex Newman, and he says the Chinese Communist regime is stepping up its war on churches.
[01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:45.830]  Hundreds of church buildings are torn down this year and leaders are arrested.
[01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:57.519]  This is what happens to churches, to people who will compromise and try to play along with government censorship and government control.
[01:12:57.639 --> 01:13:07.046]  Understand that in China there is a massive home church movement that is very vibrant, that it's growing, and those people are being persecuted.
[01:13:07.106 --> 01:13:08.868]  That's the reason why it's vibrant and growing.
[01:13:09.228 --> 01:13:15.133]  There's also a church movement in China that has essentially tried to play along with the government.
[01:13:15.453 --> 01:13:22.918]  Thinking that if they can collaborate with him, if they can go along, if they can, you know, cooperate, they're going to be favored.
[01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:25.500]  And they let them go along for a while.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.562]  They told them what they could and could not have in their Bible.
[01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:31.984]  They didn't like the idea of Jesus being referred to as King.
[01:13:32.004 --> 01:13:34.326]  They didn't like the idea of the Trinity.
[01:13:34.386 --> 01:13:36.367]  They tried to get rid of the Book of Revelation.
[01:13:36.387 --> 01:13:37.368]  There's a lot of different things.
[01:13:37.408 --> 01:13:44.833]  I'm not an expert on it, but I know that they have gotten these churches to compromise on this so they could get official recognition.
[01:13:45.673 --> 01:14:03.000]  Very similar to what happens here with churches who apply to the government for their 501c status and are told, shut up, don't talk about injustice, don't talk about anything politically, even if it has to do with life and death issues, even if
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.781]  We're imprisoning a large portion of the population.
[01:14:06.921 --> 01:14:18.706]  Just tell your people that it's good, that we need the government to do things like have a war on drugs because we can't rely on the church to change people's hearts.
[01:14:18.806 --> 01:14:24.128]  It's not really a soul issue or medical issue or psychological issue.
[01:14:24.148 --> 01:14:24.389]  It's a
[01:14:25.769 --> 01:14:26.970]  Law enforcement issue.
[01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:35.534]  So, you know, when you go along with the government, when you do what they tell you to do, then eventually things come around like they have in China.
[01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:43.578]  And they're saying, of course, the most shocking example was in late April, where communist authorities demanded the destruction of a church in Shenzhen.
[01:14:44.398 --> 01:14:47.441]  That was an officially sanctioned church, a building.
[01:14:48.061 --> 01:14:50.983]  They go in and they tear down this building.
[01:14:51.744 --> 01:14:54.626]  Over 1,000 people assembled there to try to protect it.
[01:14:54.686 --> 01:14:55.687]  They tried to appeal it.
[01:14:56.608 --> 01:15:02.653]  But they say the local branch of the regime responded with 100 heavily armed SWAT officers.
[01:15:02.693 --> 01:15:04.294]  There you go, there's the SWAT teams again.
[01:15:04.474 --> 01:15:11.440]  And paramilitary units before sending in machinery to tear down the $5 million church building to the ground.
[01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:13.730]  There's a lesson in that.
[01:15:13.971 --> 01:15:17.032]  There's a lesson in that for all of us in terms of compromise.
[01:15:17.532 --> 01:15:21.974]  Now I want to go over some of the Supreme Court decisions because they're coming at us fast and furious in these last few days.
[01:15:22.315 --> 01:15:26.737]  The Supreme Court has released a couple of decisions yesterday.
[01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:34.701]  One of them was a key decision about not being allowed to seize people's telephones without a search warrant.
[01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:47.341]  And that leaves, I think, the NSA, the CIA, these fusion centers, Homeland Security, all these police departments, that leaves them in a kind of weird position, doesn't it?
[01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:51.823]  Because they're doing dragnet surveillance of everybody without a search warrant.
[01:15:51.883 --> 01:15:53.824]  So, where's this going to go?
[01:15:53.844 --> 01:16:02.168]  Well, that's a very interesting court decision, and I think that's going to put a foot in the door for a lot of people who want to try to get back our privacy.
[01:16:02.868 --> 01:16:04.328]  And I expect to see that happen.
[01:16:04.348 --> 01:16:05.809]  That was a unanimous decision.
[01:16:06.269 --> 01:16:11.550]  They had another unanimous decision today, but this is one that wasn't unanimous.
[01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:12.430]  This is where the U.S.
[01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:15.831]  Supreme Court strikes down Massachusetts abortion buffer zone law.
[01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:22.133]  They had put up a law that put a buffer zone around abortion clinics where protesters could not go.
[01:16:22.493 --> 01:16:25.673]  You know, free speech zones, free speech areas.
[01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:31.415]  We saw that at the Bundy Ranch in Bunkerville, you know, where they put up a little
[01:16:32.475 --> 01:16:36.937]  Plastic fence around an area out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:39.558]  I mean, it literally was in the middle of nowhere.
[01:16:40.098 --> 01:16:44.400]  And then put a, printed up an official sign and said, free speech area.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.402]  Somebody put up a handwritten sign next to that and said, the First Amendment is not an area.
[01:16:51.182 --> 01:17:00.726]  And we've seen that happen, not just at Bunkerville, we've seen that happen at the last couple of presidential conventions, both Republican and Democrat.
[01:17:01.266 --> 01:17:07.249]  And we've covered that, how they put protesters far away from the convention center, literally put them in cages.
[01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:12.031]  There's a picture of that plastic fence in the signed First Amendment area.
[01:17:12.771 --> 01:17:14.312]  Yeah, the First Amendment is not an area.
[01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:17.434]  And so it's good that the Supreme Court said that as well.
[01:17:18.514 --> 01:17:26.778]  We need to fight for our rights, and you know, the people who want to take away your First Amendment rights, want to take away your Second Amendment, your Fourth Amendment, your due process rights, they want to take everything.
[01:17:26.798 --> 01:17:28.839]  They're not going to be satisfied with any of this stuff.
[01:17:29.319 --> 01:17:32.242]  And free speech is where we really wake people up.
[01:17:32.663 --> 01:17:39.910]  Now they also came back with a unanimous decision saying that Obama violated the Constitution with his recess appointments.
[01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:45.896]  Kurt Nimmo has an article up that I think has got the best background and analysis of this of anybody else.
[01:17:46.757 --> 01:17:48.198]  We've got that on Infowars.com.
[01:17:48.238 --> 01:17:52.402]  He points out, Kurt Nimmo points out, that Obama made 32 recess appointments
[01:17:53.263 --> 01:17:59.909]  And in comparison, Ronald Reagan did 232, and Bill Clinton and George Bush did more than 100 each.
[01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:06.376]  So, it really is about attempting to restore a constitutional balance to the executive branch.
[01:18:06.936 --> 01:18:16.805]  What Republicans had done to try to stop Obama from just appointing whatever judges he wanted to without any Senate oversight, which is the way the Constitution is set up,
[01:18:17.466 --> 01:18:25.969]  What they had done was to set up pro-forma sessions, according to Kurt's article, to prevent Obama from making recess appointments and circumventing the Congress.
[01:18:26.029 --> 01:18:29.830]  And in response then, of course, Harry Reid and the Democrats changed the rules.
[01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:37.772]  They're all about changing the rules, getting rid of the rules in the Senate, to have filibusters, which was a good thing.
[01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:38.893]  It's a good thing to
[01:18:39.873 --> 01:18:44.818]  Take your time to think about this and to have some control over the discussion.
[01:18:44.858 --> 01:18:47.460]  But they want to just rush everything through without any discussion.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:53.746]  They want Obama to appoint, make all these appointments to the, in this case, it was the National Labor Board.
[01:18:54.487 --> 01:18:59.091]  And this was a nine to nothing decision again today.
[01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:01.373]  And what they said was the Congress
[01:19:02.034 --> 01:19:05.215]  The Senate is in session when the Senate says that it's in session.
[01:19:05.435 --> 01:19:10.037]  So they basically struck that down and Kurt Nemo's analysis is exactly right.
[01:19:10.738 --> 01:19:15.319]  This is one area where Obama hadn't been able to do quite as many in the past.
[01:19:15.579 --> 01:19:27.244]  I think it's not because he didn't want to or didn't have the desire to go around the Constitution, but I think it's just because of that tactic that the Republicans had come up with to stop that.
[01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:30.946]  But now that tactic has been shut down, but the Supreme Court has said no.
[01:19:31.906 --> 01:19:32.646]  You have to.
[01:19:33.266 --> 01:19:34.767]  We're going to balance that power a little bit.
[01:19:35.827 --> 01:19:46.489]  Now, there's some other things happening that I think really shine where the real risk is coming to us from these technological advances.
[01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:51.290]  There's a DC cab drivers are choking the streets in protest of Uber.
[01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:55.831]  And I want to talk about that briefly in the next segment that we've got before the special report.
[01:19:56.451 --> 01:20:04.919]  And I want to give you an idea of really where we're headed in terms of major, major restructuring of our economy.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.522]  The entire transportation issue.
[01:20:08.102 --> 01:20:10.485]  Industry, I believe, is going to be changed in the next three to five years.
[01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:10.805]  Be right back.
[01:20:10.845 --> 01:20:14.729]  Now it's time to get your family the emergency readiness pack it deserves.
[01:20:14.929 --> 01:20:18.312]  And there's one site to turn to, toppackgear.com.

[01:20:19.193 --> 01:20:19.573]  We're good.
[01:20:38.399 --> 01:20:42.900]  There's one major factor affecting the health of millions, and most people are completely unaware.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:48.702]  Acid levels, soda, meat, dairy, caffeine, and sugar can all lead to elevated acid levels in the body.

[01:22:07.617 --> 01:22:10.179]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:15.324]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:23.451]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:23.692 --> 01:22:27.995]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:28.216 --> 01:22:32.019]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:32.179 --> 01:22:37.883]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:38.123 --> 01:22:40.905]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:41.285 --> 01:22:46.509]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:36.835 --> 01:23:39.436]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:23:39.557 --> 01:23:43.559]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.771]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:28.955]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and we're going to have Alex joining us with a special report at the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:29.716 --> 01:24:31.177]  Digital slave currency.
[01:24:31.197 --> 01:24:41.946]  And he's going to go back to his very first film, America Destroyed by Design, and he's going to show you how what he was talking about way back then is happening now.
[01:24:42.546 --> 01:24:48.249]  And of course it focused around the driving license, biometric identification.
[01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:54.893]  The government is all about control nodes, and transportation is a major control node.
[01:24:55.413 --> 01:25:03.278]  And we should keep that in mind when we're looking at this dispute that's going on all over the world now between taxi cab companies and Uber.
[01:25:03.738 --> 01:25:09.862]  You know, a lot of people who are free market, who are libertarian, reflexively kind of take the side of somebody
[01:25:10.482 --> 01:25:23.893]  Who is trying to break into the business of being a taxi driver, mainly because for the longest time we've seen Jitney cab services that were servicing minority areas going into areas where regular taxi cab companies would not go.
[01:25:24.414 --> 01:25:29.018]  We see them struggling with local governments who are trying to enforce a monopoly.
[01:25:29.638 --> 01:25:30.878]  By the cab companies.
[01:25:30.939 --> 01:25:35.860]  So there was this established businesses trying to work with the government to keep competition out of the way.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.521]  And we see that happening whether it's restaurants, we see that happening in many, many different industries.
[01:25:40.581 --> 01:25:49.004]  And so a lot of libertarians and free market people would instinctively side with the up-and-comer, the guy who's trying to get in, who's trying to make things better.
[01:25:49.024 --> 01:25:52.785]  But we're seeing protests all over the world, throughout Europe.
[01:25:52.825 --> 01:25:54.646]  They had a massive protest in London.
[01:25:54.666 --> 01:25:58.147]  I think it's 12,000 cabs at one point protested Uber.
[01:25:58.687 --> 01:26:02.751]  We see now this happened just yesterday in the District of Columbia in Washington.
[01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:07.455]  It says cab drivers choke the streets to protest rideshare companies.
[01:26:07.475 --> 01:26:16.663]  I guess the question since I've been to Washington many times is how do you know when they're choking the streets as a protest and when it's just typical Washington DC traffic.
[01:26:16.703 --> 01:26:19.005]  I mean that place is impossible to get through.
[01:26:19.546 --> 01:26:25.211]  But what's going on with this is that you've got these companies like Lyft and like Uber
[01:26:26.291 --> 01:26:36.279]  Who are essentially setting up rideshare operations, doing it through high-tech apps that you can use on your phone to bring in taxi cab companies.
[01:26:36.339 --> 01:26:46.068]  And some people are making some pretty good money as Uber drivers, but they ought to look at what the long-term plan is here, as the Uber CEO puts it out.
[01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:52.473]  There's an article from the Boston Herald where they talked about Uber and they talked about Google steering.
[01:26:52.933 --> 01:26:54.595]  Big changes, is what they said.
[01:26:55.235 --> 01:27:06.224]  And here's a quote from the Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick, and he said, the reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car, you're paying for the other dude in the car.
[01:27:07.005 --> 01:27:18.054]  Now, when there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle, so the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody.
[01:27:18.795 --> 01:27:21.497]  And then, car ownership goes away.
[01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:25.299]  Yeah, that car ownership goes away.
[01:27:26.099 --> 01:27:34.122]  Now, in other quotes, this guy has also kind of channeled Melissa Harris Perry when he says, we've got to get over the notion that cars are privately owned hardware.
[01:27:34.162 --> 01:27:38.564]  They should be community owned transportation vehicles.
[01:27:39.404 --> 01:27:46.406]  Where this guy is going, this is, they've got the unions fighting, the taxi drivers fighting against the Uber drivers.
[01:27:46.446 --> 01:27:48.207]  They'd love to do this divide and conquer.
[01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:51.949]  But Uber has an overreaching strategy.
[01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.990]  Uber and Google.
[01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:57.213]  They want, not self-driving cars, let's get rid of that terminology.
[01:27:57.673 --> 01:27:59.534]  You're driving yourself right now.
[01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:09.660]  You're probably driving down the road listening to me, and you're driving your car, you've got truck drivers out there who are making a living, you've got taxi drivers out there who are making a living in the transportation business.
[01:28:10.421 --> 01:28:13.203]  That's going to go away, according to their version.
[01:28:14.004 --> 01:28:22.116]  What Uber wants is what all of these large multinational corporations want, and that is to own everything.
[01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:28.446]  See, there's a level of fascism at the top, and then at the bottom, for us, we get communism.
[01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:37.373]  So you've got companies like Uber and they just had a massive fundraising where they raised 1.2 billion dollars.
[01:28:37.634 --> 01:28:40.676]  They now have a valuation of 17 billion dollars.
[01:28:40.696 --> 01:28:43.018]  They plan on raising 200 million more.
[01:28:43.038 --> 01:28:45.220]  That's according to VentureBeat.com.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:50.984]  And of course they're being fought with all these different lawsuits and all these different jurisdictions and state agencies.
[01:28:51.084 --> 01:28:52.886]  But here's where he sees it going.
[01:28:53.406 --> 01:28:57.609]  He sees it going to a situation where he owns all the transportation.
[01:28:58.910 --> 01:29:03.395]  And the cars are not self-driven cars, they are computer-driven cars.
[01:29:04.316 --> 01:29:07.058]  And they are government-controlled cars.
[01:29:07.419 --> 01:29:12.784]  See, when the computers are driving the cars, the government is going to control when and where you can go.
[01:29:12.884 --> 01:29:17.589]  Certain areas are going to be off-limits to you, just like they're going to be off-limits to your cell phone or to your laptop.
[01:29:18.009 --> 01:29:22.573]  They're going to know where you are and shut down those cell phones, shut down those laptops,
[01:29:23.374 --> 01:29:25.076]  Maybe they'll do it to you individually.
[01:29:25.096 --> 01:29:32.982]  You know, they have that capability going back to the 2008 patent from Apple and now we see Samsung and other companies putting that on the Android platform.
[01:29:33.523 --> 01:29:36.145]  They want to be able to selectively shut you down.
[01:29:36.966 --> 01:29:46.014]  See, transportation is a control node for the tyrannical authoritarian state and they don't want you to own your own car or to control your own car.
[01:29:46.254 --> 01:29:50.517]  They're going to make it impossible for you with disincentives from insurance.
[01:29:51.298 --> 01:29:53.740]  Giving you instantaneous speeding tickets.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.381]  Whatever.
[01:29:54.521 --> 01:29:56.022]  They're going to control the transportation.
[01:29:56.062 --> 01:29:56.903]  That's what this is about.
[01:29:58.084 --> 01:29:59.004]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.485 --> 01:30:01.086]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.027 --> 01:30:04.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.568 --> 01:30:11.329]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:18.814]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:30:19.294 --> 01:30:29.721]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:30:30.122 --> 01:30:39.348]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:30:40.088 --> 01:30:43.490]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:47.551]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:30:47.911 --> 01:30:49.472]  Experience the new formula.
[01:30:49.972 --> 01:30:51.933]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:30:52.533 --> 01:30:53.834]  Shield your family.
[01:30:53.874 --> 01:30:55.254]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:08.038 --> 01:31:12.780]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:16.121]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:31:16.361 --> 01:31:18.202]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:31:18.462 --> 01:31:20.402]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:31:20.622 --> 01:31:22.103]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:31:22.263 --> 01:31:25.324]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:31:25.604 --> 01:31:26.925]  If so, consider this.
[01:31:27.185 --> 01:31:36.108]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:31:36.468 --> 01:31:42.492]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:31:42.852 --> 01:31:44.493]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:44.893 --> 01:31:52.538]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[01:32:06.123 --> 01:32:07.204]  Live life healthy.
[01:32:07.684 --> 01:32:14.667]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:32:14.847 --> 01:32:17.010]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:22.295]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:32:22.476 --> 01:32:27.461]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:30.665]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:32:30.965 --> 01:32:34.809]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:32:35.029 --> 01:32:39.274]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:32:39.354 --> 01:32:49.404]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:32:49.584 --> 01:32:52.107]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:32:52.287 --> 01:33:00.351]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:33:08.777 --> 01:33:16.483]  As viewers and listeners of this radio show know, a lot of my predictions, unfortunately, are coming true.
[01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:19.245]  And it's not because I had a crystal ball.
[01:33:19.365 --> 01:33:31.915]  It's because the social engineers that control this planet to a great extent have been open about the social engineering that they are engaged in.
[01:33:33.032 --> 01:33:46.020]  They have been extremely honest about their plans to create a totally controlled society where humans basically operate and act like biological androids.
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:52.884]  Synthetic reality to bring synthetic consciousness that is no form of consciousness at all.
[01:33:53.364 --> 01:33:54.885]  Now, I'm not against technology.
[01:33:55.325 --> 01:34:01.409]  Technology's been neutral for thousands of years, whether it was the wheel or before that fire.
[01:34:02.611 --> 01:34:05.513]  A sword can be used for good, it can be used for bad.
[01:34:05.733 --> 01:34:08.575]  A butcher knife can be used for good or bad.
[01:34:09.236 --> 01:34:10.697]  So I'm not anti-technology.
[01:34:10.957 --> 01:34:18.642]  But in the last hundred years, most Western technology has been developed and deployed for social engineering.
[01:34:19.793 --> 01:34:20.113]  All right.
[01:34:39.008 --> 01:34:42.310]  Be able to predict the future and fix markets.
[01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:50.955]  This is the dream of the monopoly capitalists who are the opposite of free market capitalists that all free peoples continually wage war against.
[01:34:51.356 --> 01:34:59.761]  It was the globalist Carol Quigley at Georgetown that famously said they'll work with fascists, socialists, communists, or just dictators as long as it's centralized.
[01:35:00.181 --> 01:35:01.742]  They don't like freedom.
[01:35:02.102 --> 01:35:07.706]  They want to have controlled markets so they can dominate the future of the species.
[01:35:08.226 --> 01:35:12.148]  And you've seen how they've been the prime drivers and authors of most of our woes.
[01:35:13.029 --> 01:35:31.700]  Now, I wanted to start doing a feature here on the show once a week, every two weeks or so, sometimes maybe once a month, it'll vary, where we go back into the archive and pull up some of the things that I said a year ago, or two years ago, or five years ago, or 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[01:35:34.637 --> 01:35:42.339]  And that's the case from 1997, almost 17 years ago.
[01:35:43.539 --> 01:35:59.562]  I wanted to illustrate that biometrics were being put in at driver's license facilities to bring in a unified federal national ID card to set up domestic checkpoints on highways and at airports to bring in an internal police system.
[01:36:00.382 --> 01:36:04.983]  That is now being deployed at airports, part of Trusted Traveler, where you opt into it.
[01:36:05.063 --> 01:36:06.363]  Soon it will be mandatory.
[01:36:06.843 --> 01:36:08.524]  It's used to track everywhere you go.
[01:36:08.884 --> 01:36:13.845]  If you're not a good globalist, they turn your thumbprint off and you can not buy or sell anymore.
[01:36:14.125 --> 01:36:17.385]  That's why they're trying to get rid of farmers markets, kids selling lemonade.
[01:36:17.665 --> 01:36:21.966]  They want you only going to big box stores that are going to be part of this control grid.
[01:36:22.826 --> 01:36:24.667]  And so now, 17 years later,
[01:36:27.116 --> 01:36:36.318]  We see states like Virginia and the District of Columbia, by Virginia, saying we want to make you do a drug test and give urine or blood to get a driver's license.
[01:36:36.899 --> 01:36:37.979]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:36:38.379 --> 01:36:43.140]  Exactly what Bill Clinton put down in an executive order back in 1996.
[01:36:44.801 --> 01:36:48.822]  Now they never fully realized all that, but it shows us where they wanted to go.
[01:36:49.622 --> 01:36:53.903]  And most of what they wanted to do back then has now actually happened.
[01:36:54.524 --> 01:37:12.089]  So I wanted to play from my first film, America Destroyed by Design, something that is quite famous on the internet, but still a lot of people don't know about it, my arrest for illustrating that biometrics was coming as a dehumanizing control system.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:19.567]  The police officer, the state police officer that arrested me later apologized to me years later and said he knows that I'm right.
[01:37:19.987 --> 01:37:21.448]  This is a system of total control.
[01:37:22.289 --> 01:37:25.593]  I ran into him down at the Capitol years later at a demonstration there.
[01:37:26.411 --> 01:37:30.873]  Face scanning technology is going to be used to totally control every aspect of our life.
[01:37:31.313 --> 01:37:32.114]  It's rolling out.
[01:37:32.154 --> 01:37:36.196]  They want web IDs where you'll get on the Internet with a face scan or a thumb print.
[01:37:36.536 --> 01:37:37.816]  Microsoft admits that.
[01:37:37.896 --> 01:37:38.837]  Facebook admits that.
[01:37:39.217 --> 01:37:40.618]  And then three strikes, you're out.
[01:37:40.698 --> 01:37:42.259]  No judge, no jury, no indictment.
[01:37:42.619 --> 01:37:51.323]  If big companies say you've done something wrong on the Internet three times, like the YouTube model, you are then banned off of the Internet.
[01:37:51.883 --> 01:38:07.727]  That's what Google's doing, trying to get that database, making you give them your cell phone, your home phone, your IDs, with your Google ID tied to your email and your YouTube, and to your Google wallet, so when you're not a good globalist, you can just be turned off.
[01:38:08.468 --> 01:38:16.530]  This is the type of system that would make Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, or Mao Tse-Tung have a literal wet dream.
[01:38:17.643 --> 01:38:22.748]  This is the Trojan horse tools that are completely enslaving our society.
[01:38:22.968 --> 01:38:24.169]  Just look at some of these headlines.
[01:38:24.529 --> 01:38:29.694]  Obama administration launches plan to make internet ID a reality.
[01:38:30.034 --> 01:38:34.758]  To tax you, to track you, to turn you off, if they don't want to.
[01:38:35.058 --> 01:38:39.202]  With all of their illegal spying, which they denied for decades, which they now admit.
[01:38:40.649 --> 01:38:45.091]  Facebook, Walmart set sights on face scanning to buy and to sell.
[01:38:45.271 --> 01:38:51.374]  South China Morning Post, Facebook, Apple to help draft face scanning rules amid privacy fears.
[01:38:51.834 --> 01:38:54.715]  Nightclub goes for face scanning security.
[01:38:55.175 --> 01:38:57.996]  This is happening in Texas, it's happening in Melbourne, Australia.
[01:38:58.416 --> 01:38:59.697]  It's a global grid.
[01:39:00.797 --> 01:39:02.778]  Oh, you had five beers today, the police know.
[01:39:03.038 --> 01:39:06.000]  They're hooked in to the face scanner at the bar.
[01:39:07.042 --> 01:39:12.486]  They're trying to force locals to wire their security cameras in by law in New York and other states to this.
[01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:16.770]  It's a global technocracy grid run by the globalists who are bad people.
[01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:18.631]  This could be human empowering.
[01:39:19.211 --> 01:39:26.137]  The problem is it's being designed and deployed and rolled out from the beginning from an authoritarian bent, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:27.338 --> 01:39:30.940]  Another article, White House wants Chinese style ID system for internet users.
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:35.502]  Again, off face scanning and thumb printing to control and track everything you do.
[01:39:36.302 --> 01:39:38.683]  Vehicle miles traveling tax proposed.
[01:39:38.963 --> 01:39:41.525]  Guess what's already in all the cars universally worldwide?
[01:39:41.865 --> 01:39:48.648]  From Japan to the US, the satellite tracker box hooked into a cell phone in the belly of your car to tax you by the mile.
[01:39:50.069 --> 01:39:52.131]  See how everything I predicted is coming?
[01:39:52.291 --> 01:39:53.292]  Because I didn't predict it.
[01:39:53.672 --> 01:39:59.037]  The globalists at MIT admitted all this when I was warning people back in the mid-1990s.
[01:40:00.338 --> 01:40:03.901]  Biometric security being promoted as if the public wants it.
[01:40:04.221 --> 01:40:08.645]  Oh, biometric security can't come soon enough for some people is the headline.
[01:40:10.518 --> 01:40:12.700]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.265]  The idea that won't die, outtaxing cars with a mile, is back on the agenda.
[01:40:17.645 --> 01:40:19.387]  And they have the boxes in the cars.
[01:40:19.727 --> 01:40:20.328]  Take a peek.
[01:40:20.428 --> 01:40:24.051]  Biometric security offers relief from passwords.
[01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:24.612]  That's right.
[01:40:25.192 --> 01:40:33.600]  Oh, the government releases the passwords, the government releases the worms and the viruses that break in and steal your password and give it to hackers.
[01:40:34.482 --> 01:40:35.282]  That's been in the news.
[01:40:35.722 --> 01:40:44.985]  So that they discredit passwords and force you to go to a thumbprint, an iris scan, which that imprint can just as easily be stolen.
[01:40:45.445 --> 01:40:48.926]  All it is is a list of digital numbers or a digital algorithm.
[01:40:49.186 --> 01:40:55.428]  It's even easier to defraud the thumbprint or the eye scan because you can't ever change that password.
[01:40:56.088 --> 01:40:58.911]  And that's all been proven to be a fraud as well.
[01:40:59.392 --> 01:40:59.993]  Here's another one.
[01:41:00.013 --> 01:41:03.797]  DHS to test face scanning cameras at Tri-City Hockey Game.
[01:41:04.217 --> 01:41:08.362]  Again, with checkpoints and people searching you at the checkpoints.
[01:41:08.842 --> 01:41:10.784]  Supposedly because of Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:11.825 --> 01:41:18.587]  And other groups that they publicly arm, fund, and run in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and other areas.
[01:41:18.988 --> 01:41:34.313]  Again, a criminal technocracy creating crises or exacerbating crises, like Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff famously said, now the Chicago mob boss in Don, they don't want to let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:41:35.053 --> 01:41:37.274]  You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[01:41:38.399 --> 01:41:42.544]  And what I mean by that, it's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.
[01:41:43.404 --> 01:41:46.187]  Again, it's not that technology's bad.
[01:41:46.888 --> 01:41:53.495]  Our technology has been developed and deployed for a hundred years to carry out dehumanization, to carry out eugenics.
[01:41:53.916 --> 01:41:55.297]  Look at who founded IBM.
[01:41:55.377 --> 01:41:56.679]  Top Nazi, Thomas Watson.
[01:41:57.546 --> 01:41:59.407]  Look at who runs all these systems.
[01:41:59.487 --> 01:42:01.028]  Find out who Bill and Melinda Gates are.
[01:42:01.388 --> 01:42:02.609]  Find out about their own statements.
[01:42:02.669 --> 01:42:03.209]  Warren Buffett.
[01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:07.232]  Then you'll understand why the technology is driving in this direction.
[01:42:07.832 --> 01:42:13.656]  Because these people believe they're going to merge with the machines and become God, as Ray Kurzweil, the head of Google Technology, has said.
[01:42:15.151 --> 01:42:22.197]  Let's go ahead and now go back to 1997, where I got arrested to draw attention.
[01:42:22.517 --> 01:42:29.803]  You know, some fools out there say, Alex, you got fingerprinted, you got arrested, ah-ha-ha, you were trying to get around fingerprinting.
[01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:31.785]  No, I wasn't trying to get around fingerprinting.
[01:42:32.085 --> 01:42:35.368]  I wasn't putting superglue on my thumb to fool the biometrics.
[01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:42.054]  I was trying to stop the collection of biometrics and the national ID card to begin with.
[01:42:43.439 --> 01:42:47.743]  I was warning about things they wouldn't even admit existed at the time.
[01:42:48.363 --> 01:42:55.069]  And we did succeed in raising public awareness to where we now have a good shot of changing all of this today.
[01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:59.393]  Alright, enough from Alex Jones in 2014.
[01:42:59.753 --> 01:43:01.555]  Let's go back to 1997.
[01:43:01.995 --> 01:43:08.821]  And then we'll come back to the future and David Knight after this time capsule.
[01:43:09.962 --> 01:43:11.363]  All right, they're ready for me.
[01:43:11.403 --> 01:43:11.803]  Let's go.
[01:43:11.843 --> 01:43:13.124]  Come over and get the pretty little red light.
[01:43:13.985 --> 01:43:14.385]  Come on.
[01:43:14.465 --> 01:43:15.186]  Isn't that pretty?
[01:43:15.346 --> 01:43:19.668]  And they'll put a nice little clinic in here in the next few years for urine and blood testing like Clinton wants.
[01:43:20.189 --> 01:43:20.969]  What do I have to hide?
[01:43:21.009 --> 01:43:21.489]  I'm a criminal.
[01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.550]  There we have it.
[01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.931]  Nice little pretty red light.
[01:43:23.951 --> 01:43:24.812]  Get that, Mike.
[01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.573]  There we have it.
[01:43:28.814 --> 01:43:29.375]  We're good to go.
[01:43:48.697 --> 01:43:49.177]  How you doing?
[01:43:49.237 --> 01:43:51.598]  I am here with eight forms of identification.
[01:43:52.458 --> 01:43:53.478]  I have my passport.
[01:43:53.498 --> 01:43:55.599]  Here is that, my name, and the form you asked me to fill out.
[01:43:56.199 --> 01:43:57.199]  I have no criminal record.
[01:43:57.239 --> 01:43:58.940]  My name is Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:00.340]  Here is my passport.
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.021]  Here is my insurance.
[01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:05.321]  Here is another form of ID.
[01:44:05.942 --> 01:44:07.422]  Here is my old driver's license.
[01:44:07.882 --> 01:44:09.242]  Here is my birth certificate.
[01:44:09.623 --> 01:44:10.723]  And here is my W-2 form.
[01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:14.723]  And, uh, here is two more insurance cards, all the ones, just so you can double check.
[01:44:14.743 --> 01:44:15.945]  This is a health club card.
[01:44:15.965 --> 01:44:16.586]  Okay.
[01:44:16.826 --> 01:44:22.275]  I just need for you to answer these first three questions.
[01:44:22.375 --> 01:44:23.396]  So I don't have to thumb scan?
[01:44:23.817 --> 01:44:24.718]  Well, we're gonna get to that.
[01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:26.341]  You are eventually gonna have to.
[01:44:26.381 --> 01:44:26.681]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:28.131 --> 01:44:31.633]  No, not at this point, but you will before we're done with the process.
[01:44:32.053 --> 01:44:32.313]  Why?
[01:44:32.953 --> 01:44:33.814]  Because it's required.
[01:44:34.174 --> 01:44:38.576]  It's required by Bill Clinton in 1992, and it was instituted here in Texas in 1993.
[01:44:38.676 --> 01:44:39.557]  I know the code, sir.
[01:44:39.677 --> 01:44:42.198]  Are you going to institute his urine and blood testing when he commands you?
[01:44:42.218 --> 01:44:45.320]  Are you going to stick a needle in my arm when I have no criminal record?
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.942]  The only questions I'm going to answer right now are concerning driver's license issuance.
[01:44:50.774 --> 01:44:52.015]  You just follow orders, don't you?
[01:44:52.476 --> 01:45:00.323]  So you're saying you're going to deny me the constitutional right to travel if I do not submit to this digital thumb scanning?
[01:45:01.877 --> 01:45:07.001]  What I will tell you, today you will not receive a duplicate driver's license if you do not submit to a thumbprint.
[01:45:07.021 --> 01:45:09.143]  Okay, look, I feel like I'm being raped here.
[01:45:09.443 --> 01:45:12.906]  Well, I would sit down with you for hours and try to do what I could to help you.
[01:45:12.926 --> 01:45:15.468]  Then just give me my license without digitally thumb scanning.
[01:45:15.488 --> 01:45:17.690]  I am not going to violate DPS policy.
[01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:18.871]  Is there a religious exception?
[01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:20.492]  For your exception.
[01:45:20.512 --> 01:45:21.493]  Is there a religious exception?
[01:45:23.929 --> 01:45:25.130]  Everyone must take the mark.
[01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:27.491]  A digitally enhanced mark.
[01:45:28.872 --> 01:45:32.293]  A digital tattoo.
[01:45:34.034 --> 01:45:34.534]  I'm good to go.
[01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:37.916]  Why do you need my thumbprint?
[01:45:38.436 --> 01:45:40.137]  It's part of Bill Clinton's law, isn't it?
[01:45:40.217 --> 01:45:41.337]  It's an executive order.
[01:45:41.858 --> 01:45:44.159]  It's a decree by Bill Clinton.
[01:45:44.219 --> 01:45:44.439]  NCIC.
[01:45:44.499 --> 01:45:45.599]  Yeah, and a drive without a license.
[01:45:49.361 --> 01:45:51.043]  What's the penalties for driving without a license?
[01:45:51.063 --> 01:45:52.365]  You know, I don't even want to go there.
[01:45:52.605 --> 01:45:53.045]  That's right.
[01:45:53.446 --> 01:45:53.886]  You know why?
[01:45:53.906 --> 01:45:54.467]  I'm asking you.
[01:45:54.487 --> 01:45:55.488]  It doesn't pertain to anything.
[01:45:55.508 --> 01:45:56.029]  You're an officer.
[01:45:56.069 --> 01:45:56.770]  I'm asking you the law.
[01:45:57.371 --> 01:45:58.692]  I would be glad to sit down and talk.
[01:45:58.712 --> 01:46:01.796]  So you're saying I'll be committing a crime by driving if I don't take your mark?
[01:46:03.942 --> 01:46:05.683]  I would be glad to do anything I can to help you, sir.
[01:46:05.763 --> 01:46:07.984]  Well, see, you're saying... I'm not against you.
[01:46:08.064 --> 01:46:13.647]  Officer Ard, you're sitting here, Sergeant, and telling me that you're all friendly and you're all nice.
[01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:15.768]  But I'll be pulled over and given tickets.
[01:46:15.808 --> 01:46:22.452]  If I don't pay those, I will go to jail because I... because of my morals and my beliefs, I will not take this.
[01:46:23.012 --> 01:46:27.833]  And I'm here to tell you, I already took this in 93, and many people will say, well, you've already taken it, what's your problem with it?
[01:46:27.853 --> 01:46:34.674]  Because now I've figured out what this is, and I'm opposing all those others that are being herded in here like cattle to be thumb scanned like criminals.
[01:46:34.694 --> 01:46:35.254]  Mr. Jones?
[01:46:35.294 --> 01:46:35.474]  Yes?
[01:46:36.314 --> 01:46:37.575]  We don't even need to start there.
[01:46:37.595 --> 01:46:40.675]  If I know that you're not going to submit to a thumb scan, why waste your time?
[01:46:40.735 --> 01:46:40.955]  See?
[01:46:41.055 --> 01:46:41.675]  Right up front.
[01:46:42.175 --> 01:46:44.916]  They will drop, and people are being turned away all day here.
[01:46:44.956 --> 01:46:49.077]  So you're saying I pay my taxes, I'm raped by the IRS, which is criminal.
[01:46:49.537 --> 01:46:50.517]  You know, it's well known.
[01:46:52.117 --> 01:46:52.557]  Submit.
[01:46:52.717 --> 01:46:54.118]  He just said I must submit.
[01:46:55.578 --> 01:46:56.818]  I'm telling you, I've never been to jail.
[01:46:57.158 --> 01:46:58.639]  I don't know, what do you want me to do for you?
[01:46:58.819 --> 01:47:00.579]  I want you to give me my driver's license.
[01:47:01.279 --> 01:47:02.699]  I want my driver's license.
[01:47:02.859 --> 01:47:03.500]  I am not a criminal.
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.500]  I may become one today, but that's fine.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.861]  You're saying you won't take me to jail at 5 if I'm still here.
[01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:11.541]  No, we're not going to take you to jail.
[01:47:11.741 --> 01:47:12.261]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:14.682]  This is against the grain of the Constitution.
[01:47:15.746 --> 01:47:18.989]  If I don't take the mark, my right to travel is taken.
[01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:22.012]  You're taking my rights and telling me that it's no big deal?
[01:47:22.433 --> 01:47:23.714]  And now you want a urine and blood test.
[01:47:23.754 --> 01:47:24.955]  Bring me the document.
[01:47:26.374 --> 01:47:27.975]  Who has the urine and blood testing document?
[01:47:28.135 --> 01:47:28.695]  I need it.
[01:47:28.715 --> 01:47:30.396]  I'm going to pass these out to people.
[01:47:31.457 --> 01:47:33.999]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Federal Register.
[01:47:34.079 --> 01:47:34.919]  Bill Clinton.
[01:47:35.159 --> 01:47:37.020]  Urine and blood testing plan for you.
[01:47:37.381 --> 01:47:38.441]  Tell your friends about it.
[01:47:38.782 --> 01:47:40.282]  We have got to stand against this.
[01:47:40.683 --> 01:47:42.864]  The states are preparing to implement this plan.
[01:47:43.464 --> 01:47:44.365]  This is not a joke.
[01:47:44.385 --> 01:47:45.586]  This is not the entire document.
[01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:46.206]  It gets worse.
[01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:47.827]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:47.847 --> 01:47:48.828]  It's much worse.
[01:47:49.268 --> 01:47:50.929]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a joke to them.
[01:47:53.635 --> 01:47:55.099]  Only Coach Pinders matters.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:57.585]  Only diversions like Rome, the Gladiators.
[01:47:58.006 --> 01:48:02.238]  If I don't take this, if I don't take this, will I not?
[01:48:03.064 --> 01:48:09.611]  Be penalized for not having a driver's license, by not being able to cash a check, by being given tickets, that if I don't pay those tickets, I'll be taken to jail.
[01:48:09.651 --> 01:48:10.732]  I can't travel out of state.
[01:48:10.952 --> 01:48:12.234]  I can't get on board an airplane.
[01:48:12.654 --> 01:48:14.856]  And the media is talking about thumb scanning to travel.
[01:48:15.317 --> 01:48:18.200]  You're working with the foreign banks and the military-industrial complex.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.221]  This is all their idea.
[01:48:19.461 --> 01:48:20.782]  Read the Military War College from 1968.
[01:48:20.862 --> 01:48:21.283]  They planned this!
[01:48:23.605 --> 01:48:26.029]  Just because you lay around doesn't mean it's not true.
[01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:28.051]  This is not a publicity stunt.
[01:48:28.211 --> 01:48:31.435]  I was a lot happier years ago before I got into all this garbage.
[01:48:31.696 --> 01:48:32.977]  I'm sick of sheep laying down.
[01:48:33.138 --> 01:48:34.620]  I wish you'd get up and do something.
[01:48:35.325 --> 01:48:36.186]  Makes me want to vomit!
[01:48:37.766 --> 01:48:43.629]  Our forefathers went to World War II and World War I and fought in the Civil War to end slavery and it means nothing to y'all!
[01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:45.831]  We're a bunch of yellow-bellied weaklings!
[01:48:46.491 --> 01:48:47.311]  I'm sick of it!
[01:48:47.912 --> 01:48:53.215]  I'm sick of people laying down like a bunch of jellyfish and rationalizing what's going on.
[01:48:53.455 --> 01:48:54.935]  People ought to be ashamed of themselves.
[01:48:55.075 --> 01:48:55.936]  Yes, exactly.
[01:49:00.427 --> 01:49:03.090]  Now look very carefully at Mike Cox.
[01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:07.555]  He is head public information officer for all of Texas, for the DPS.
[01:49:08.015 --> 01:49:14.362]  They weren't going to arrest me, but about 15 minutes into the protest, he showed up and things changed dramatically.
[01:49:14.382 --> 01:49:18.327]  He walked up, stared at me, turned, walked back to the back.
[01:49:18.367 --> 01:49:21.070]  They had a little meeting together and then they came and arrested me.
[01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:22.471]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:22.491 --> 01:49:24.493]  If you don't leave now, I will be forced to arrest you.
[01:49:24.533 --> 01:49:25.914]  Sir, I'm here to get a driver's license.
[01:49:25.994 --> 01:49:27.135]  I have never had a criminal record.
[01:49:27.196 --> 01:49:28.116]  It's time to go.
[01:49:28.136 --> 01:49:28.537]  Here I go.
[01:49:28.717 --> 01:49:29.378]  Get my stuff for me.
[01:49:42.879 --> 01:49:43.800]  Pay mercenaries, huh?
[01:50:03.633 --> 01:50:06.235]  Yeah, he's got his black gloves on.
[01:50:06.395 --> 01:50:08.757]  I guess that makes him tough.
[01:50:08.877 --> 01:50:12.700]  I guess that makes him look like a real well-paid person there.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.641]  Where's Alex?
[01:50:13.721 --> 01:50:15.002]  Where's Alex?
[01:50:15.102 --> 01:50:17.864]  He has to do a show tonight!
[01:50:17.944 --> 01:50:19.665]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:50:19.785 --> 01:50:20.266]  Hey!
[01:50:20.306 --> 01:50:22.207]  Yeah, they're pushing everybody.
[01:50:22.247 --> 01:50:23.508]  They're pushing Edson.
[01:50:23.608 --> 01:50:25.430]  He's getting ridiculous.
[01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:30.113]  I thought my tax dollars paid for this bill.
[01:50:30.173 --> 01:50:31.134]  He's got it.
[01:50:31.214 --> 01:50:31.875]  He's got it.
[01:50:36.819 --> 01:50:40.683]  The DPS was very professional, but they did the classic bait-and-switch.
[01:50:40.843 --> 01:50:44.887]  They got all the troopers on one side of the building and made us think that I was coming out there.
[01:50:54.534 --> 01:50:57.515]  I hope we've painted you a picture of what's really happening here in the nation.
[01:50:58.455 --> 01:51:03.556]  I got out of jail that night with a Class C misdemeanor, and I'm taking it to court, and I'm sure I'll defeat it with a jury trial.
[01:51:03.596 --> 01:51:08.177]  It's a small price to pay, though, to bring light upon the biometric technologies.

[01:52:07.805 --> 01:52:09.346]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[01:52:09.526 --> 01:52:14.270]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:21.455]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[01:52:21.755 --> 01:52:25.839]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[01:52:26.199 --> 01:52:28.741]  But a friend and patriot has discovered a loophole.
[01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:34.265]  Find out about the NSA loophole before they shut it down at privacylockdown.com.
[01:52:34.505 --> 01:52:36.006]  That's privacylockdown.com.
[01:52:37.307 --> 01:52:39.909]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[01:52:40.409 --> 01:52:43.952]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[01:52:44.533 --> 01:52:47.295]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[01:52:47.575 --> 01:52:48.756]  Chaos on our border.
[01:52:49.196 --> 01:52:51.258]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[01:52:51.718 --> 01:52:53.279]  Life is getting ready to change.
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:56.282]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.
[01:52:56.682 --> 01:52:59.844]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[01:52:59.904 --> 01:53:00.085]  That's 888-507-8789.
[01:53:07.210 --> 01:53:09.111]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:53:09.451 --> 01:53:17.313]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:53:17.393 --> 01:53:24.435]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:53:24.916 --> 01:53:29.157]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that was good stuff.
[01:53:29.457 --> 01:53:39.540]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:53:40.021 --> 01:53:46.143]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:53:46.463 --> 01:53:48.684]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:53:48.804 --> 01:53:52.645]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:53:52.785 --> 01:53:54.387]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:28.090]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:28.170 --> 01:54:31.431]  I'm David Knight, and that was Alex's report, which is now up.
[01:54:31.571 --> 01:54:33.372]  Digital Slave Currency.
[01:54:33.412 --> 01:54:35.513]  That's on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:54:35.533 --> 01:54:36.213]  You can see that.
[01:54:36.393 --> 01:54:37.453]  Pass that around to people.
[01:54:37.973 --> 01:54:51.637]  And as Alex pointed out in that report, where he's talking about how they're setting up checkpoints now, as he had predicted years and years ago in that very first documentary, setting up checkpoints at airports, on highways, getting people's identity.
[01:54:51.657 --> 01:54:53.458]  It's a point of control.
[01:54:54.198 --> 01:54:55.839]  That's what transportation is.
[01:54:55.879 --> 01:54:58.980]  It's a very important control node for the government.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:01.881]  They always seek to control the transportation.
[01:55:01.921 --> 01:55:12.406]  And of course, there are parallels to, as he said, being in a house arrest and being taken out of the internet with a three strikes and you're out type of policy.
[01:55:12.446 --> 01:55:17.709]  But you could be under house arrest literally if they shut down your ability to move around.
[01:55:17.729 --> 01:55:20.210]  And that was what I was talking about just before his report.
[01:55:20.230 --> 01:55:22.451]  And that is the coming of the
[01:55:23.351 --> 01:55:26.754]  Computer-driven, government-controlled cars.
[01:55:26.794 --> 01:55:28.976]  They like to call them self-driving cars.
[01:55:28.996 --> 01:55:30.777]  Now, we have self-driving cars now.
[01:55:30.837 --> 01:55:36.902]  They're going to be driven by computers, and if you think they're going to be safer, then you've never experienced the blue screen of death.
[01:55:37.322 --> 01:55:43.668]  Or you've never used Google map apps or Apple map apps to know that they don't always get you where you want to go.
[01:55:43.708 --> 01:55:47.711]  But of course, even Obama wants to cut down even that access.
[01:55:47.731 --> 01:55:49.613]  See, if you use that as a human,
[01:55:50.273 --> 01:55:50.913]  You're dangerous.
[01:55:51.413 --> 01:56:04.959]  So one of the ways that they're going to control, they're going to push us into this transportation control, is they're going to ban humans from being able to drive cars by high insurance rates by saying that you can't use navigation, you can only have navigation there if the computer is doing it.
[01:56:04.979 --> 01:56:15.182]  They'll constantly monitor where you are, they'll be able to restrict where you go, when you go, maybe restrict your travel completely if you're somebody that they want to put under house arrest.
[01:56:15.622 --> 01:56:19.104]  A very dangerous thing and it is much, much closer than you think.
[01:56:19.824 --> 01:56:23.185]  The beginning of this year, there were a lot of articles saying that, well, the technology is here.
[01:56:23.505 --> 01:56:29.907]  We've got all the major car companies with self-driving cars, but they have to have somebody sitting in the seat to take control of the steering wheel.
[01:56:30.788 --> 01:56:35.429]  They said the real hurdles, the real obstacles, are legal obstacles.
[01:56:35.969 --> 01:56:46.313]  And so what we saw was, in April, very quickly, the European Union, as well as, of course, California, removed these legal restrictions, saying they're going to allow, starting next year,
[01:56:46.993 --> 01:56:54.978]  It's a race between the European car companies and the American car companies and Google as to who can produce the first quote-unquote self-driving cars.
[01:56:55.038 --> 01:57:00.722]  Now Google has put out a little clown car that doesn't have a brake pedal, doesn't have a gas pedal, doesn't have a steering wheel.
[01:57:00.762 --> 01:57:05.025]  You just get in it and I guess it's got a control panel where you tell it where you want to go.
[01:57:05.345 --> 01:57:06.626]  They've put that out as a demo.
[01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:07.987]  That's their vision of the future.
[01:57:08.507 --> 01:57:15.828]  And of course the other part of their vision of the future is to completely remake the economy with just a few people controlling everything.
[01:57:15.848 --> 01:57:18.189]  A kind of neo-feudalism.
[01:57:18.789 --> 01:57:20.890]  That's what I believe is behind this.
[01:57:21.370 --> 01:57:28.171]  It's neo-feudalism for the corporations that are in bed with the government and of course the government gets to exercise complete control.
[01:57:28.671 --> 01:57:37.993]  I think it's kind of betrayed in the name and the quotes of the CEO from Uber when he says, we're going to get beyond the idea of individual car ownership.
[01:57:38.513 --> 01:57:44.995]  We're going to stop viewing cars as some hardware that is individually owned, and it's going to be community-controlled vehicles.
[01:57:45.636 --> 01:57:46.676]  It's a very dangerous thing.
[01:57:46.696 --> 01:57:48.157]  They're going to sell it to you as safety.
[01:57:48.197 --> 01:57:50.097]  They always sell you safety and security.
[01:57:50.117 --> 01:57:50.597]  But you know what?
[01:57:50.657 --> 01:57:57.240]  When you give up your freedom, when you give up your liberty, when you live in a controlled state, you're not free.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.162]  They're going to make humans more dependent, more helpless, and more controlled with this transportation.
[01:58:03.662 --> 01:58:15.572]  And coming in three to five years, what you're going to see is these people who are now fighting Uber because they want to have taxi cab companies or they want to have Jitney companies or they're in the transportation industry, they're going to lose their jobs.
[01:58:15.612 --> 01:58:19.776]  It's going to be massive displacement when they start self-driving the trucks.
[01:58:20.396 --> 01:58:21.797]  That's something to think about.
[01:58:21.817 --> 01:58:24.138]  It's something to push back against.
[01:58:24.558 --> 01:58:31.122]  It's fine if you want to get into a limousine and have it take you around by computer, but you should not be compelled to do that.
[01:58:31.422 --> 01:58:34.004]  You should not be forced to do that.
[01:58:34.304 --> 01:58:35.244]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:58:35.825 --> 01:58:46.671]  Well, stay tuned, because up in the next hour, we're going to have Gerald Cilenti, and we're going to talk about economic trends, we're going to talk about the world hegemony trends, and what's happened 11 years after Iraq.
[01:58:46.771 --> 01:58:47.271]  Stay with us.
[01:58:51.306 --> 01:58:55.272]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.802 --> 01:59:00.863]  In the near future.
[01:59:01.143 --> 01:59:05.287]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:59:05.647 --> 01:59:06.668]  Security alert.
[01:59:06.868 --> 01:59:08.589]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:09.510]  Analysis.
[01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:10.411]  InfoWars.
[01:59:10.491 --> 01:59:12.413]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:12.433 --> 01:59:17.437]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:17.477 --> 01:59:18.398]  Prime Directive.
[01:59:18.498 --> 01:59:19.959]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:20.059 --> 01:59:22.821]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:22.901 --> 01:59:25.964]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:26.144 --> 01:59:28.326]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:28.766 --> 01:59:29.927]  People are assaulting us.
[01:59:29.947 --> 01:59:32.309]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:32.769 --> 01:59:34.471]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:34.731 --> 01:59:38.614]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:59:48.782 --> 01:59:53.186]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.567]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:00:01.641 --> 02:00:03.601]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:21.085 --> 02:00:22.025]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.625 --> 02:00:26.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.826 --> 02:00:30.887]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.767 --> 02:00:33.108]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:33.208 --> 02:00:33.868]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:33.888 --> 02:00:36.250]  I'm going to be joined in the next segment with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:39.972]  One of the things I want to talk to him about is, of course, economic trends.
[02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:42.774]  He covers trends in a wide variety of areas.
[02:00:43.534 --> 02:00:46.256]  Before I get to that, though, there's some breaking news.
[02:00:46.336 --> 02:00:49.078]  It's up on Infowars.com from Jonathan Oosting.
[02:00:49.598 --> 02:00:54.441]  NRA celebrates new Michigan laws exempting gun records from public disclosure.
[02:00:54.961 --> 02:01:10.240]  Now the interesting thing about this is that when you compare it to the other article that's another article up on InfoWars.com from Mikhail Thelin where the SWAT team in Massachusetts is refusing a freedom of information request from the ACLU saying
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.422]  We're a private organization.
[02:01:12.462 --> 02:01:16.806]  We're not going to give you any statistics about what we do or how often we do it.
[02:01:17.587 --> 02:01:26.896]  And totally closing them off, and to which the ACLU said, well, if you are truly a private organization, then you're breaking the law.
[02:01:27.396 --> 02:01:29.859]  But contrast that to what was going on in Michigan.
[02:01:30.259 --> 02:01:44.547]  You had people in Michigan, this law in Michigan, as well as a response to what was going on in New York as well, where people were using freedom of information requests to get information about individual gun owners.
[02:01:45.027 --> 02:01:46.528]  That's not what FOIA was about.
[02:01:46.668 --> 02:01:54.532]  FOIA was there to give us transparency and insight into what our government is doing, not to let us spy on our neighbors.
[02:01:54.932 --> 02:01:59.675]  So, they're celebrating the fact that they now have a new Michigan law that will protect
[02:02:00.155 --> 02:02:00.995]  We're good to go.
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:21.203]  And of course, yesterday we had some economic revision.
[02:02:21.223 --> 02:02:25.287]  You know, they love to revise these economic numbers as they go along.
[02:02:25.307 --> 02:02:30.231]  They give us one number and then the next quarter they say, well, you know, it was actually worse than we thought, but now it's improving.
[02:02:30.871 --> 02:02:32.793]  Well, this is a major revision.
[02:02:33.253 --> 02:02:35.775]  An article that's up on Infowars.com says the U.S.
[02:02:35.835 --> 02:02:37.157]  economy has collapsed
[02:02:37.757 --> 02:02:40.358]  This is a monstrous negative revision.
[02:02:40.378 --> 02:02:43.419]  We're not talking about a recession, we're talking about a collapse.
[02:02:43.459 --> 02:02:44.879]  And that's by Max Slavo.
[02:02:45.539 --> 02:02:47.460]  Now, other people have reported on this.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.501]  We've got Market Watch saying the economy stumbles and a first quarter historic fall.
[02:02:52.822 --> 02:03:00.164]  They say the 2.9% drop in GDP is the biggest during economic expansion since World War II.
[02:03:01.044 --> 02:03:02.245]  That kind of puts it in perspective.
[02:03:02.625 --> 02:03:03.906]  We see another one here from Bloomberg.
[02:03:03.926 --> 02:03:05.767]  They say, well, it's the most in five years.
[02:03:06.867 --> 02:03:11.910]  You know, you can pick your points to try to make it read any way you want to.
[02:03:11.970 --> 02:03:15.992]  But then, of course, Obama wants it to look as though it's anybody's fault but his own.
[02:03:16.432 --> 02:03:19.054]  And this is an article from TheFederalist.com.
[02:03:19.414 --> 02:03:22.596]  They say, the economy tanked last quarter and it's everybody's fault but Obama.
[02:03:22.936 --> 02:03:30.120]  And they point out how the liberal organizations like ThinkProgress and, of course, Huffington Post will come in and say, hey,
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:36.884]  It was good that things didn't fall as much as we thought because, and one of the reasons is because health care spending is on the rise.
[02:03:37.324 --> 02:03:38.025]  That's a good thing.
[02:03:38.465 --> 02:03:44.269]  And as he points out in this article, he said, hey, I thought Obamacare was supposed to reduce our health care costs.
[02:03:44.829 --> 02:03:45.730]  Of course it wasn't.
[02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:49.412]  It was there to make profits for the insurance companies that wrote it.
[02:03:49.893 --> 02:03:54.856]  And then of course this tweet from Huffington Post, Obamacare just saved the economy from contraction.
[02:03:55.456 --> 02:04:00.620]  Ah, but then they find out that it's not 1% decline, but it's now a 3% decline.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.622]  So now they've got to find a cause.
[02:04:04.062 --> 02:04:04.823]  Well, guess what?
[02:04:04.923 --> 02:04:06.444]  The cause was the weather.
[02:04:06.764 --> 02:04:07.885]  It was the winter, you know.
[02:04:08.045 --> 02:04:10.067]  It was a very cold winter.
[02:04:10.627 --> 02:04:13.249]  And of course, MarketWatch.com picks up on that.
[02:04:13.269 --> 02:04:14.890]  They said the cold weather cost the U.S.
[02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:16.271]  economy about $15 billion.
[02:04:16.291 --> 02:04:16.431]  Maybe.
[02:04:19.113 --> 02:04:33.280]  and they're a little bit skeptical because this is a yet another revision and of course there are many other factors but of course Obama jumps in with the weather but he has a completely different take on it okay he's gonna save the economy and save us with
[02:04:34.329 --> 02:04:36.750]  Global warming measures, okay?
[02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:42.932]  He says his initiatives are going to combat global warming and save consumers more than $60 billion in energy costs.
[02:04:42.972 --> 02:04:45.053]  This is the Washington Post's take on that.
[02:04:45.313 --> 02:04:49.875]  Well, of course, you're going to then pay twice that amount of money if you really do save it on energy costs.
[02:04:49.895 --> 02:04:52.916]  You're going to pay twice that amount of money in carbon taxes.
[02:04:53.436 --> 02:04:56.138]  To people who are private organizations.
[02:04:56.259 --> 02:05:00.282]  It's going to be a kind of indulgence that we'll pay them for all the energy that we use.
[02:05:00.562 --> 02:05:02.684]  But of course, the energy prices are not going to go down.
[02:05:03.064 --> 02:05:05.406]  Because they're shutting down power plants everywhere.
[02:05:05.767 --> 02:05:09.450]  But you've got the Washington Post, the New York Times, the LA Times pushing that narrative.
[02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:10.070]  Stay with us.
[02:05:11.031 --> 02:05:26.159]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:30.901]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was some good stuff.
[02:05:31.221 --> 02:05:41.385]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:05:41.845 --> 02:05:48.027]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:48.328 --> 02:05:50.568]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:50.588 --> 02:05:54.530]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:05:54.710 --> 02:05:56.312]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:05:56.653 --> 02:06:00.598]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[02:06:08.806 --> 02:06:12.829]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:12.849 --> 02:06:17.011]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:17.231 --> 02:06:20.613]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:20.894 --> 02:06:23.775]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:23.935 --> 02:06:31.260]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:35.161]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:35.402 --> 02:06:39.663]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:39.823 --> 02:06:45.766]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:45.786 --> 02:06:49.567]  You're right, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:49.727 --> 02:06:52.268]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:52.468 --> 02:06:53.809]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:53.969 --> 02:06:55.209]  It's time to take action.
[02:06:55.349 --> 02:06:56.990]  It's time to filter our water.
[02:06:57.090 --> 02:07:01.291]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:01.311 --> 02:07:04.632]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:04.652 --> 02:07:07.553]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:24.958 --> 02:07:27.580]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:33.064]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:33.325 --> 02:07:40.210]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:44.493]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:44.853 --> 02:07:49.637]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:49.977 --> 02:07:50.818]  This is innovating.
[02:07:51.098 --> 02:07:58.402]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:58.542 --> 02:08:02.644]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:08:27.657 --> 02:08:31.502]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:38.322 --> 02:08:39.603]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:39.683 --> 02:08:47.669]  I'm David Knight, your host for this hour, and joining us this segment is Gerald Salenti, famous trends forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal.
[02:08:48.309 --> 02:08:52.272]  Before I go to Gerald, I want to tell you that we've got some specials of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:52.352 --> 02:08:55.854]  This is what supports the operation at Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:55.874 --> 02:09:01.418]  We have Survival Shield X2 and Fluoride Shield, two bottles of our best formulas for 30% off.
[02:09:02.679 --> 02:09:02.919]  I think so.
[02:09:20.846 --> 02:09:21.647]  I think so.
[02:09:37.242 --> 02:09:39.583]  Now joining us, as I just said, is Gerald Salenti.
[02:09:39.663 --> 02:09:42.044]  His website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:09:42.104 --> 02:09:45.386]  His journal, Trends Journal, is put out on a quarterly basis.
[02:09:45.426 --> 02:09:46.767]  I've got a copy right here on my desk.
[02:09:46.847 --> 02:09:48.027]  It's a nice publication.
[02:09:48.087 --> 02:09:49.948]  I want to talk to him about a variety of things.
[02:09:49.968 --> 02:09:54.010]  I want to talk about economics and his forecast on that.
[02:09:54.110 --> 02:09:57.312]  But Gerald is all about the big picture.
[02:09:57.392 --> 02:10:01.194]  And in the big picture, of course, war is looming heavy.
[02:10:01.954 --> 02:10:09.685]  Because that's a major factor that is driving the people, the people who are making the decisions, who are pushing us into war, and he has a lot to say about that.
[02:10:09.745 --> 02:10:10.867]  But, Gerald, welcome!
[02:10:13.544 --> 02:10:14.385]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:10:14.505 --> 02:10:22.690]  I wanted to first, before we get into the articles that you've got here, you've got one article, Washington is driving the world to the final war.
[02:10:22.730 --> 02:10:26.132]  I want to get your comments on that and have you flesh that out for the audience.
[02:10:26.192 --> 02:10:36.219]  But before we get to that, I wanted to get your take on this major revision in the economy yesterday from a GDP decline of 1% to all of a sudden tripling it to 3%.
[02:10:36.939 --> 02:10:41.823]  And one of the publications pointed out that's the largest decline during expansion since World War II.
[02:10:43.473 --> 02:10:51.960]  It's also the greatest revision that's ever been done since 1976.
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:55.242]  By the way, the winter up here in the East was terrible.
[02:10:55.322 --> 02:10:57.344]  It was one of the worst I ever remember in my life.
[02:10:57.984 --> 02:11:01.006]  So there's no question that it hit the markets.
[02:11:01.907 --> 02:11:06.351]  However, the story's bigger than that because you keep looking at the numbers.
[02:11:07.711 --> 02:11:10.872]  So let's say we even cut off, you know, we cut it in half.
[02:11:11.292 --> 02:11:12.692]  It was still down by, let's say, 1.5%.
[02:11:15.032 --> 02:11:22.214]  Now this is after dumping trillions and trillions and countless trillions into the economy to prop it up.
[02:11:22.974 --> 02:11:23.894]  It's not working.
[02:11:24.614 --> 02:11:27.574]  There's other numbers that came out today that verify it.
[02:11:28.335 --> 02:11:29.335]  And here are some of them.
[02:11:30.495 --> 02:11:32.595]  You start looking at consumer spending.
[02:11:34.336 --> 02:11:35.936]  Well, it was down.
[02:11:37.657 --> 02:11:39.938]  They expected it to increase, it didn't.
[02:11:40.339 --> 02:11:50.324]  Now you're also hearing from one of the Fed chair, or the Fed presidents, saying that interest rates may go up as early as the first quarter of 2015.
[02:11:50.605 --> 02:11:55.768]  This, David, has been an interest rate recovery.
[02:11:56.068 --> 02:11:56.588]  Period.
[02:11:56.688 --> 02:11:57.408]  Paragraph.
[02:11:57.849 --> 02:12:01.231]  Not only here, what do they have over there in the European Union?
[02:12:02.311 --> 02:12:03.512]  Negative interest rates?
[02:12:03.532 --> 02:12:04.773]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:12:05.882 --> 02:12:06.222]  Really?
[02:12:06.282 --> 02:12:11.344]  I mean, if somebody out and comes up with negative interest, what are you, out of your mind?
[02:12:11.384 --> 02:12:22.609]  The only people this is enriching, and the only reason the equity markets are at where they are, is because of interest rates so cheap, and all the cheap money.
[02:12:22.929 --> 02:12:24.029]  So let's do the numbers.
[02:12:24.610 --> 02:12:26.631]  You're looking at merger and acquisition.
[02:12:28.827 --> 02:12:38.514]  For the first two quarters of this year that are almost at the height of just before the crash in 2007.
[02:12:39.095 --> 02:12:46.260]  We're looking at 10 billion dollars a day worth of merger and acquisition activity.
[02:12:46.721 --> 02:12:51.905]  Now, this is at a time when you're looking again at those numbers that you were talking about.
[02:12:51.925 --> 02:12:53.045]  There's no GDP growth.
[02:12:53.386 --> 02:12:54.346]  It's negative growth.
[02:12:54.987 --> 02:12:55.968]  So what do we have?
[02:12:57.648 --> 02:12:59.769]  It's screwing the little people.
[02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:04.691]  Because when I was a young man, they used to have this quaint little thing.
[02:13:05.071 --> 02:13:06.972]  They were called savings accounts.
[02:13:07.672 --> 02:13:16.316]  So people worked hard, put money away, and the money that they put away was way above the inflation rate.
[02:13:17.056 --> 02:13:17.617]  Now you have...
[02:13:19.309 --> 02:13:22.070]  You put money in the bank, this is what you get back, you know.
[02:13:22.411 --> 02:13:24.151]  You get nothing back.
[02:13:24.391 --> 02:13:28.013]  So, it's hurting everybody across the board.
[02:13:28.493 --> 02:13:31.035]  It's setting up a crisis for retirements.
[02:13:31.655 --> 02:13:37.058]  And it's also pumping up the housing markets and the equity markets.
[02:13:37.638 --> 02:13:39.799]  Again, you look at the numbers.
[02:13:40.219 --> 02:13:41.420]  They're all down.
[02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:44.151]  Spending is down.
[02:13:44.452 --> 02:14:00.548]  Housing isn't that strong, even though we have all this cheap money in there, because first-time homebuyers, which usually account for over 40% of home sales, that's now down to around 25%.
[02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:07.232]  Because young people get lousy jobs.
[02:14:07.572 --> 02:14:12.273]  Oh, and by the way, it's going to get worse because of all the consolidation.
[02:14:12.794 --> 02:14:14.734]  So you don't have a housing.
[02:14:15.995 --> 02:14:20.136]  It's the housing market recovery is minimal when you put it into the grander context.
[02:14:20.516 --> 02:14:24.898]  And again, comparing what housing sales are now compared to what they were.
[02:14:25.698 --> 02:14:28.521]  Back, you know, when the bubble was being inflated.
[02:14:28.881 --> 02:14:35.226]  You also, by the way, you have the housing bubble in China has deflated.
[02:14:35.827 --> 02:14:49.358]  The only people that don't know it are the people that don't watch it or that believe the guys that get paid a lot of money to go on CNBC and Bloomberg and report the big lies.
[02:14:49.818 --> 02:14:52.060]  Because I can tell you firsthand
[02:14:53.041 --> 02:15:00.149]  It was a trend, one of the top trends we had in the Trends Journal for 2014.
[02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:04.494]  Chinatown boom, they're flooding the area.
[02:15:04.514 --> 02:15:08.859]  They're buying up properties that they don't even know what they're going to do with.
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:11.542]  I know this first hand.
[02:15:12.523 --> 02:15:25.389]  And I'm talking about companies coming out of Hong Kong with assets in real estate that are in the $20, $30, and $40 billion range.
[02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:33.593]  Because they're not buying up in the cities anymore because the prices are too high, so they're going out to the outskirts.
[02:15:34.034 --> 02:15:38.136]  Because the bubble has hit already in China.
[02:15:39.690 --> 02:15:45.075]  We're going to stop for a crash that's far worse than the panic of 08.
[02:15:45.556 --> 02:15:46.897]  Everything is in place.
[02:15:47.898 --> 02:15:52.482]  You look again, as you well reported with these phony numbers that came out.
[02:15:52.922 --> 02:15:57.367]  And again, this is coming out from the government, so you know they're even underestimating it.
[02:15:57.887 --> 02:16:01.130]  Matter of fact, there's an article today by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:16:01.150 --> 02:16:02.592]  I think it was on your site.
[02:16:03.551 --> 02:16:12.917]  Having some of the facts there about how the Clinton administration put in these phony numbers so we're not really looking at the right inflation rate.
[02:16:13.477 --> 02:16:19.941]  So if you add all this together, the GDP numbers are much worse than what they're putting out.
[02:16:20.601 --> 02:16:27.663]  Well, you know, as you pointed out, we don't have these things called savings accounts anymore because they really don't want Americans to own anything.
[02:16:28.143 --> 02:16:34.706]  They want an elite few to own everything, whether it's our cars, our transportation, our homes, our real estate.
[02:16:35.306 --> 02:16:45.109]  And as you point out, there's been a panic from the Chinese trying to move their fiat currency into some real hard assets, but that's coming to an end now, isn't it?
[02:16:45.848 --> 02:16:48.533]  Yes, but they're buying up in the states.
[02:16:49.574 --> 02:16:53.241]  Because they have to put their money someplace and you have the bubble over there.
[02:16:53.681 --> 02:16:55.464]  And again, all things are connected.
[02:16:56.749 --> 02:16:57.149]  That's right.
[02:16:57.809 --> 02:17:02.051]  Because when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:17:02.411 --> 02:17:04.172]  Yes, and that's the key thing.
[02:17:04.752 --> 02:17:06.113]  Very interesting today.
[02:17:06.573 --> 02:17:22.100]  That's what I want to talk to you about in the long segment, but of course, you know, there's also the economic... One of these articles that we've got up today about the economy on Infowars.com is from Max Slavo, and he's quoting from some economists who said that the inventory drawdowns took down 1.7% from GDP number because
[02:17:24.401 --> 02:17:28.183]  Companies don't build inventories if they don't have anybody to buy it.
[02:17:28.323 --> 02:17:35.486]  And people aren't buying it because they're losing their jobs because they're too expensive, especially at the low end, because of health care mandates.
[02:17:35.846 --> 02:17:37.967]  But it's going to get much worse, Gerald, isn't it?
[02:17:38.007 --> 02:17:42.829]  Because we're going to see a lot of people losing their jobs to automation.
[02:17:42.869 --> 02:17:47.171]  I was talking about the transportation industry, how they're looking at three to five years out.
[02:17:47.671 --> 02:17:53.915]  Having self-driving cars, well there go the taxi drivers, there go the UPS drivers, there go the long-term truck drivers.
[02:17:53.935 --> 02:17:56.196]  They're going to be replaced by metal cans.
[02:17:56.256 --> 02:17:58.517]  It's not the Mexicans, it's the metal cans, isn't it?
[02:17:59.338 --> 02:18:01.459]  Well, yeah, and it's even worse than that.
[02:18:01.579 --> 02:18:02.960]  There goes your life, too.
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:04.681]  I mean, really, they can't fix it.
[02:18:04.701 --> 02:18:06.082]  You can't get the ignition.
[02:18:08.148 --> 02:18:09.589]  Exactly.
[02:18:09.989 --> 02:18:16.991]  How many tens of thousands, millions, millions and millions of automobiles are they recalling?
[02:18:17.291 --> 02:18:21.753]  Oh yeah, now we're going to have a perfect one that could drive itself.
[02:18:21.993 --> 02:18:27.055]  You know the cars have been designed by geeks and video game freaks.
[02:18:27.535 --> 02:18:28.775]  That's all they are.
[02:18:29.176 --> 02:18:35.598]  But what's going to happen Gerald is, what's going to happen is when these things fail, it's going to be quietly ignored by the media.
[02:18:36.138 --> 02:18:45.802]  And then of course the corporations will pay massive amounts to the families in order to cover up the fact that their car drove them into a wall or drove them off of a bridge or whatever.
[02:18:46.143 --> 02:18:47.283]  Whatever the mode of failure.
[02:18:47.303 --> 02:18:52.606]  I mean we've seen that with the rapid acceleration of cars from multiple automobile manufacturers.
[02:18:52.626 --> 02:18:54.106]  That's pretty much been kept quiet.
[02:18:54.446 --> 02:18:55.927]  Not a lot has been said about that.
[02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:59.729]  And we know that as they take over there's going to be failures because of course
[02:19:00.109 --> 02:19:04.201]  These cars and these computer programs, these map apps, they're all being done by humans.
[02:19:04.241 --> 02:19:07.992]  So you're not going to eliminate human error, you're just going to transfer it to another place.
[02:19:08.894 --> 02:19:09.394]  Exactly.
[02:19:09.454 --> 02:19:11.315]  Look, again, the ignition problem.
[02:19:11.795 --> 02:19:15.416]  Look how they covered it up with General Motors, the company that we bailed out.
[02:19:16.016 --> 02:19:19.317]  Again, merger, same corporate powers, fascism.
[02:19:19.777 --> 02:19:22.997]  Look at, they can't get the airbag problem fixed.
[02:19:23.518 --> 02:19:25.178]  And they're going to have a self-driving car.
[02:19:25.218 --> 02:19:29.039]  And we have a lot of people with a real bad attitude, man.
[02:19:29.299 --> 02:19:31.339]  This whole Silicon Valley.
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:33.400]  Silicon, man, the con is perfect.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:34.181]  Perfect.
[02:19:34.402 --> 02:19:35.203]  That's all it is.
[02:19:35.524 --> 02:19:36.907]  It's one big con.
[02:19:37.188 --> 02:19:40.174]  Hey, look how smart smartphones have made everybody.
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:51.962]  There lies a big technological boost for the people that are making the dough, and all it's going to do is to make a bad situation much worse.
[02:19:52.022 --> 02:19:54.882]  Again, look at the recall numbers.
[02:19:55.302 --> 02:19:55.622]  That's right.
[02:19:55.642 --> 02:19:57.063]  We're going to come back right after the break.
[02:19:57.143 --> 02:20:02.344]  I want to talk to you briefly about this book and possible film in the spirit of ZZ in the short segment.
[02:20:02.644 --> 02:20:08.665]  In the long segment, I want you to tell us about where you see the final war going and where it's coming from.

[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:18.441]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:21:18.722 --> 02:21:20.543]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:21:20.863 --> 02:21:22.304]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:21:22.504 --> 02:21:25.565]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?

[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:17.606]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:17.706 --> 02:24:21.508]  I'm David Knight and we have on the phone with us Gerald Salenti.
[02:24:21.548 --> 02:24:24.711]  We've just been talking about his economic forecast.
[02:24:24.771 --> 02:24:31.475]  In this short segment, Gerald, I want to talk to you about this book and film that you've got, What ZZ Gave Honey Boy.
[02:24:32.135 --> 02:24:35.177]  I just saw Jersey Boys over the weekend with my wife and
[02:24:36.238 --> 02:24:47.540]  I thought it was interesting in the story where, at one point, Frankie Valli in the Four Seasons realized that one of the group members has essentially sold the group out to the mob, that they're massively in debt to the mob.
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:50.141]  I thought that's kind of an analogy for America, isn't it?
[02:24:50.841 --> 02:24:58.663]  But I'd like to hear your take, because your take is, as you subtitle it here, a true story about love, wisdom, and the soul of America.
[02:24:58.683 --> 02:24:59.703]  I'd like to see that film.
[02:25:00.356 --> 02:25:10.103]  Well, here's the book, and of everything I've ever written, David, and I've written a lot of stuff over the last, you know, 35 years, this is my favorite.
[02:25:10.604 --> 02:25:14.467]  And Zinzi, Zia is the, um, in Italian, that's aunt.
[02:25:14.907 --> 02:25:16.488]  And Zinzi is your auntie.
[02:25:16.508 --> 02:25:16.908]  Oh.
[02:25:16.968 --> 02:25:18.149]  And she was my aunt.
[02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:23.193]  And I used to visit her all the time, and I was going through a divorce.
[02:25:23.673 --> 02:25:25.475]  Her husband just died.
[02:25:25.795 --> 02:25:27.256]  We used to play Scrabble all the time.
[02:25:27.616 --> 02:25:29.258]  And one day,
[02:25:30.709 --> 02:25:32.871]  She used to cook for me like all Italian women do.
[02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:33.792]  She could hardly walk.
[02:25:34.433 --> 02:25:40.298]  I'm coming back from the city and the sink is filled up with pots and pans.
[02:25:40.498 --> 02:25:45.043]  She used to not only cook for me when I was there, but enough for me to take home for a week.
[02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:47.225]  And I start washing the dishes.
[02:25:47.245 --> 02:25:48.606]  She says, sit down, you're my guest.
[02:25:49.427 --> 02:25:54.352]  I'm cleaning the dishes and she said to me, you know Gerald,
[02:25:55.475 --> 02:25:58.196]  I listened to the news all day yesterday.
[02:25:58.456 --> 02:26:04.619]  What a bunch of...begins with an S. They must think we're all morons.
[02:26:05.459 --> 02:26:08.501]  I stopped what I was doing and I wrote those words down.
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:12.481]  In three months, I wrote this book.
[02:26:12.781 --> 02:26:15.523]  And I used to call her every time I wrote a couple of pages.
[02:26:16.384 --> 02:26:18.785]  And it was what this country used to be.
[02:26:19.526 --> 02:26:23.368]  How her and her husband, they had a butcher's shop in the Bronx.
[02:26:23.829 --> 02:26:28.372]  And how they were able to buy a lovely home in the nice section of Yonkers.
[02:26:28.892 --> 02:26:31.494]  How the family used to be there.
[02:26:32.074 --> 02:26:34.636]  When this was truly the land of opportunity.
[02:26:35.236 --> 02:26:38.058]  And she used to tell me, my grandfather, may his soul rest in peace.
[02:26:38.338 --> 02:26:40.020]  She said, you know your grandfather, when he came from
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.421]  He was so proud to be an American.
[02:26:43.202 --> 02:26:47.585]  He was the first person online on the voting booth.
[02:26:47.805 --> 02:26:50.267]  This is on the East Side of New York, the Upper East Side.
[02:26:52.557 --> 02:26:59.299]  She said, now, you know, they call me up and they say, Mrs. Volani, you know, the Democratic Party, she's a Democrat.
[02:26:59.319 --> 02:27:00.879]  Can we pick you up to go vote?
[02:27:01.319 --> 02:27:02.099]  She said, you know what you could do?
[02:27:02.139 --> 02:27:03.940]  You could pick me up to go shopping.
[02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:04.820]  I can't get out.
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:07.301]  I wouldn't vote for any of you crooks.
[02:27:07.861 --> 02:27:08.321]  Yeah.
[02:27:08.521 --> 02:27:16.403]  And we started going back and forth about what life used to be in America and what it's become.
[02:27:18.092 --> 02:27:35.107]  Criminal operations, the immorality that they could even have a thing where they could justify killing suspected terrorists with drones, where they could take us to war for lies, outright lies, and then put up that little guy, that little...
[02:27:35.848 --> 02:27:45.035]  Guy with a bad attitude, the Vice President of the United States, Cheney, and keeps spewing out his lies, and there's no dignity anymore.
[02:27:45.355 --> 02:27:48.238]  There's no respect, there's a lack of courage.
[02:27:48.798 --> 02:27:53.842]  So this book is about when it used to be, and how to get it back.
[02:27:54.122 --> 02:27:58.405]  And this is an independent film, people just doing this that read the book.
[02:27:59.006 --> 02:28:02.629]  So anybody that wants to help this film, by the way, Doris Roberts,
[02:28:03.689 --> 02:28:08.853]  The woman who played, uh, uh, Everybody Loves Raymond, she's gonna be playing Gidzee!
[02:28:09.173 --> 02:28:11.234]  And she's the perfect person for it.
[02:28:11.634 --> 02:28:15.637]  And the website is Gidzeeandhoneyboy.com.
[02:28:16.177 --> 02:28:19.599]  And it's an independent film, and they're shooting it now.
[02:28:19.679 --> 02:28:21.200]  Doris Roberts has signed up.
[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:23.522]  So anybody that wants to help,
[02:28:25.117 --> 02:28:29.739]  Bring Gigi back to life and Boydowini her now.
[02:28:29.759 --> 02:28:30.999]  Please do what you can do.
[02:28:31.139 --> 02:28:36.261]  You know, Gerald, as I've told you in the past, my wife is part Italian and from New York.
[02:28:36.321 --> 02:28:39.622]  And so I know a lot of people that came over as immigrants.
[02:28:39.662 --> 02:28:41.463]  They came over because they loved America.
[02:28:42.163 --> 02:28:48.385]  And in many cases, unlike people, like the first time I met my wife, she said, you know, what nationality are you?
[02:28:48.565 --> 02:28:49.885]  And I said, I'm an American.
[02:28:49.965 --> 02:28:50.685]  And she said, yeah, funny.
[02:28:51.005 --> 02:28:52.046]  No, where are your people from?
[02:28:52.066 --> 02:28:53.026]  It's like, well, America.
[02:28:53.046 --> 02:28:54.766]  I mean, they've been here for hundreds of years.
[02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.927]  So I don't have any recollection of that.
[02:28:56.987 --> 02:29:01.748]  But, you know, in many cases, the people who came over and realized what they were leaving,
[02:29:02.108 --> 02:29:09.812]  People saw what tyranny was about, whether they were in East Germany or some other place, and they realized the control the government had over their lives.
[02:29:10.152 --> 02:29:15.374]  When they tasted freedom, they appreciated it and they loved it more in America than they did elsewhere.
[02:29:15.434 --> 02:29:27.640]  But I'm very concerned about the demographic surge that we see with illegal aliens just opening up the border and collapsing them and bringing them in at such young ages and in such numbers that it's not a melting pot anymore.
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:28.920]  No, it's not.
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:33.702]  The whole country's been destroyed by the Bloods and the Crips!
[02:29:34.082 --> 02:29:37.944]  Yeah, yeah, and that's what's coming across the border of a lot of criminals.
[02:29:38.724 --> 02:29:39.885]  Hang on, we're going to be right back.
[02:29:39.965 --> 02:29:46.948]  Hang on, we're going to be right back after the break and we're going to talk about Washington's final drive for final war.
[02:29:47.008 --> 02:29:48.288]  That's out of the Trends Journal.
[02:29:48.308 --> 02:29:50.209]  We'll be right back with Gerald Solenti.
[02:29:58.010 --> 02:30:00.993]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.934 --> 02:30:04.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.635 --> 02:30:15.698]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:15.798 --> 02:30:17.959]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:23.262]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:23.422 --> 02:30:28.464]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:28.605 --> 02:30:31.626]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:31.906 --> 02:30:35.788]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:35.989 --> 02:30:40.231]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:40.311 --> 02:30:50.337]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:50.537 --> 02:30:58.422]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray
[02:30:58.422 --> 02:30:58.622]  We're good.
[02:31:08.658 --> 02:31:10.539]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:31:10.879 --> 02:31:18.802]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:18.882 --> 02:31:25.965]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:31:26.465 --> 02:31:30.747]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:31:31.047 --> 02:31:41.233]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:31:41.693 --> 02:31:47.856]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:31:48.177 --> 02:31:50.398]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:31:50.418 --> 02:31:54.380]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:56.162]  It's not just the Super Mel Vitality.
[02:31:56.503 --> 02:32:00.448]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[02:32:00.668 --> 02:32:07.597]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:12.521]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:32:12.541 --> 02:32:16.703]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:32:16.923 --> 02:32:20.344]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:32:20.584 --> 02:32:23.466]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:32:23.626 --> 02:32:30.969]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:32:31.209 --> 02:32:34.831]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:32:35.051 --> 02:32:39.352]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:32:39.513 --> 02:32:45.455]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:32:45.495 --> 02:32:49.256]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:32:49.416 --> 02:32:51.957]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:32:52.157 --> 02:32:53.517]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:32:53.677 --> 02:32:54.898]  It's time to take action.
[02:32:55.038 --> 02:32:56.758]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:33:05.382 --> 02:33:06.904]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:07.044 --> 02:33:07.545]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.188 --> 02:33:28.469]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.569 --> 02:33:33.412]  I'm David Knight and I have Gerald Solnitte from Trends Journal with me on the line.
[02:33:34.252 --> 02:33:40.336]  And I was just given this article from Kit Daniels just went up on the Infowars.com website.
[02:33:40.956 --> 02:33:45.619]  TSA to raise groping fees that are being charged to passengers.
[02:33:45.639 --> 02:33:47.120]  That's right, they're going to raise
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:48.220]  We're good to go.
[02:34:08.872 --> 02:34:24.079]  They've got the wrong guy, but they come in with a SWAT team raid, they break into his apartment, they put the black bag over his head, and then while he's tied up, they let one hand loose while he's in the bag, they have him sign a sheet of paper agreeing to pay for his interrogation.
[02:34:24.759 --> 02:34:26.099]  That's what this has come to.
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:27.560]  It's not a joke anymore.
[02:34:30.401 --> 02:34:35.722]  You look at Brazil, and instead of laughing at it, you're saying, yeah, that's happening now.
[02:34:35.762 --> 02:34:39.143]  That was something decades old, but now we see that happening.
[02:34:39.683 --> 02:34:45.965]  And before we get back to Gerald, I just want to tell you that we just finally got back in stock a limited supply of InfoWars Lung Cleanse.
[02:34:46.885 --> 02:34:52.286]  That's not going to last long, so you can go to InfoWarsLife.com, get that while supplies last.
[02:34:52.326 --> 02:34:54.627]  Of course, that's something to help you.
[02:34:55.407 --> 02:35:08.394]  Herbal lung cleanse, the most powerful on the market to help support your respiratory system, to help you deal with the toxic air and the environmental issues that you get from breathing our toxic environment.
[02:35:08.454 --> 02:35:11.456]  That's available now for a limited time, finally back in stock.
[02:35:12.396 --> 02:35:18.980]  So Gerald, what do you think about the TSA charging us, adding these hidden fees to our airline tickets?
[02:35:19.625 --> 02:35:24.708]  Well, you know, before I get into that, I was mentioning about the Bloods and the Crips.
[02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:27.470]  They're the Democrats and the Republicans.
[02:35:28.151 --> 02:35:29.812]  They're murderers and they're thieves.
[02:35:30.372 --> 02:35:36.456]  You know, I get emotional when I was talking about the jizzy, what this country used to be like and what it's turned into.
[02:35:36.977 --> 02:35:37.757]  I mean, I've been around.
[02:35:37.797 --> 02:35:38.698]  I know what it was.
[02:35:39.678 --> 02:35:40.939]  And it breaks my heart.
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:45.803]  And so when I say the Bloods and the Crips, I'm not saying that sarcastically.
[02:35:45.823 --> 02:35:47.284]  Look what they've done to Iraq.
[02:35:48.490 --> 02:35:50.311]  Look what they've done to Afghanistan.
[02:35:50.351 --> 02:35:53.051]  Look at the murder on their, blood on their hands.
[02:35:53.592 --> 02:35:55.392]  Look how they steal our money.
[02:35:55.752 --> 02:35:57.413]  You're talking about the TSA now.
[02:35:58.193 --> 02:35:59.513]  Oh yeah, that's going to stop it.
[02:35:59.733 --> 02:35:59.994]  Oh yeah.
[02:36:00.274 --> 02:36:04.595]  Hey, hey David, how about these millions of people that are coming over the border?
[02:36:04.815 --> 02:36:05.636]  Not concerned about them.
[02:36:36.375 --> 02:36:50.318]  Well, it's the same agency that is groping people at the airports and now adding fees to our tickets that has essentially opened our borders to literal gangs that are coming across with part of this drug war.
[02:36:50.618 --> 02:37:04.021]  More people are dying in Mexico than have died in Afghanistan and in Iraq and that's the drug war that our government is supplying as well as saying that they're fighting it at the same time and now they're bringing that violence into our country.
[02:37:04.881 --> 02:37:11.008]  Opening the borders while they increase the harassment of people who come in via airplanes, who come in legally.
[02:37:11.912 --> 02:37:14.994]  And again, it's not only here.
[02:37:15.455 --> 02:37:33.407]  Just what the Nobel Peace Prize winner did when he and Samantha Powers and Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton did with destabilizing Libya, overthrowing a sovereign government, and destabilizing the entire region with the covert war in Syria.
[02:37:36.249 --> 02:37:42.956]  With the destabilization, with the Iraq war, Afghan war, they're flooding into Europe!
[02:37:43.537 --> 02:37:45.719]  They can't stop them!
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.204]  Two weeks ago, it was like 8,000 people just coming into Italy.
[02:37:50.224 --> 02:37:51.125]  That's right.
[02:37:51.145 --> 02:37:56.651]  So it's a destabilization worldwide being caused
[02:37:57.732 --> 02:38:06.496]  Because by people who are mentally ill, does anybody have to see a sicker SOB than Cheney or Kerry?
[02:38:06.736 --> 02:38:09.577]  That guy's always shooting his mouth off, man.
[02:38:10.197 --> 02:38:16.860]  One loser after another, one vicious war, and people are wondering why it's not working.
[02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:19.981]  So when I say bloods and crips, I mean it.
[02:38:20.686 --> 02:38:21.447]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:21.507 --> 02:38:25.449]  Now, I'm looking at the spring edition of Trends Journal.
[02:38:25.669 --> 02:38:27.571]  People can get that at TrendsJournal.com.
[02:38:27.631 --> 02:38:30.212]  The cover says, War or Peace?
[02:38:30.813 --> 02:38:32.354]  We the people should decide.
[02:38:32.374 --> 02:38:39.158]  You have a lot to say about the Iraq War, how we got into that 11 years on, and look at what's happening now.
[02:38:39.418 --> 02:38:41.159]  We see this all folding up, don't we?
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:44.882]  David, a trend alert.
[02:38:46.664 --> 02:38:50.685]  February 18th, 2003.
[02:38:52.086 --> 02:38:53.286]  Weeks before the war.
[02:38:53.986 --> 02:39:00.768]  Gannett News had asked me to do a op-ed piece, and then we expanded it for the subscribers to the Trends Journal.
[02:39:01.669 --> 02:39:02.429]  Here's what we said.
[02:39:03.973 --> 02:39:14.278]  While the victory on the battlefield may be swift considering the massive military power of the United States, the war against Iraq will be eventually lost.
[02:39:14.878 --> 02:39:28.465]  And we said it would devolve into a civil war, unrelenting suicide attacks against coalition forces, and people are vowing to fight down to the last man to repel invaders.
[02:39:28.845 --> 02:39:29.766]  It keeps going on.
[02:39:30.666 --> 02:39:31.326]  Trend alert.
[02:39:31.807 --> 02:39:32.467]  March 28, 2005.
[02:39:34.068 --> 02:39:34.728]  Iraq.
[02:39:35.408 --> 02:39:36.209]  Trend update.
[02:39:36.589 --> 02:39:38.470]  Real war, fake democracy.
[02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:39.270]  What's next?
[02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:43.372]  Top trend trends, 2005.
[02:39:43.932 --> 02:39:45.473]  Doing the Iraq drag.
[02:39:46.513 --> 02:39:49.995]  Washington's promise and the Pentagon's prophecy that
[02:39:51.567 --> 02:39:56.551]  That this year's elections will establish democracy and facilitate U.S.
[02:39:56.611 --> 02:40:19.309]  troop reductions are as inaccurate as claims made last year by Vice President Dick Cheney that the Iraq War is behind us and Major General Raymond Ordierno's predictions that, quote, we have six to twelve months left of this insurgency.
[02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:22.131]  On and on and on.
[02:40:22.531 --> 02:40:28.175]  We've been documenting it from before the war happened, saying exactly what would happen.
[02:40:28.535 --> 02:40:30.797]  And what does the prostitute media do?
[02:40:31.197 --> 02:40:41.605]  They keep bringing back all of the losers as this thing is going down the toilet to ask them what they should do next and what they see ahead.
[02:40:42.486 --> 02:40:45.650]  Well, you know, I think the public looks at this and says, uh, look at this.
[02:40:45.890 --> 02:40:47.472]  It was a failed invasion.
[02:40:47.532 --> 02:40:49.254]  It was a failed counterinsurgency.
[02:40:49.915 --> 02:40:53.660]  The whole point is to keep war continually going, isn't it?
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:55.963]  They knew they weren't going to win this counterinsurgency.
[02:40:57.665 --> 02:41:00.246]  Again, yes, and it goes back to 9-11.
[02:41:00.266 --> 02:41:00.806]  Yes.
[02:41:01.006 --> 02:41:04.907]  You know, the New Trends Journal is coming out in a couple of weeks.
[02:41:04.927 --> 02:41:07.868]  And we really broke this down.
[02:41:08.468 --> 02:41:14.390]  And you look, go back just a few weeks before the 9-11.
[02:41:15.130 --> 02:41:19.331]  Bush's popularity in the polls was down to 51%.
[02:41:19.771 --> 02:41:21.592]  This is a newly elected president.
[02:41:21.832 --> 02:41:23.412]  He's only in office several months.
[02:41:24.252 --> 02:41:26.433]  They were slashing the defense budget.
[02:41:27.213 --> 02:41:42.507]  Then you go listen to his speech to the nation, to the House of Representatives, and how everyone stood up and applauded when they announced they were going to increase the military budget by...
[02:41:44.066 --> 02:41:58.278]  $40 billion overnight, and this, by the way, is on the heels of the dot-com crash that happened in March of 2000, and the United States is going into the toilet in a recession.
[02:41:59.078 --> 02:42:04.242]  So when you start putting the pieces together, it all goes back to Eisenhower.
[02:42:05.063 --> 02:42:10.365]  That's right, the military-industrial complex taking over the nation.
[02:42:10.945 --> 02:42:23.048]  And now, very interesting, very interesting, today's papers, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, big, big articles.
[02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:25.229]  You know what they're buying?
[02:42:26.633 --> 02:42:30.856]  Brought to you by the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S.
[02:42:30.916 --> 02:42:31.937]  Chamber of Commerce.
[02:42:32.598 --> 02:42:37.962]  America's interests are at stake in Russia and Ukraine.
[02:42:38.302 --> 02:42:38.763]  There we go.
[02:42:38.783 --> 02:42:40.244]  We've got to have a war.
[02:42:41.047 --> 02:42:41.327]  No.
[02:42:41.727 --> 02:42:43.288]  They're calling for peace.
[02:42:44.089 --> 02:42:46.690]  They're calling for prosperity.
[02:42:47.191 --> 02:42:49.372]  They're calling for no sanctions.
[02:42:49.792 --> 02:42:52.213]  They can see the handwriting on the wall.
[02:42:52.233 --> 02:42:52.794]  Oh, really?
[02:42:52.814 --> 02:42:58.397]  They know that the United States is in no position for more war.
[02:42:58.857 --> 02:43:00.318]  And that's what we're writing about.
[02:43:00.378 --> 02:43:01.299]  This is, again, the
[02:43:02.219 --> 02:43:03.480]  Chamber of Commerce?
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:05.682]  Yeah, I'm surprised.
[02:43:05.702 --> 02:43:06.682]  Manufacturers?
[02:43:06.783 --> 02:43:07.503]  That is news.
[02:43:07.543 --> 02:43:09.845]  That's like a complete 180 to turn around.
[02:43:09.905 --> 02:43:14.068]  Because, you know, we look at, as you pointed out, 9-11, defense budget is going down.
[02:43:14.108 --> 02:43:18.071]  They say we don't have anybody to fight, so they've got to create a new enemy.
[02:43:18.451 --> 02:43:26.738]  And they create a new bureaucracy, Homeland Security, where they expand the military-industrial complex, not just to fight wars abroad,
[02:43:27.358 --> 02:43:31.040]  But to bring it home and to create a police state industrial complex.
[02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:36.422]  You know, it was Madison who said that if tyranny ever comes to these lands, it'll be in the name of fighting a foreign enemy.
[02:43:36.742 --> 02:43:37.743]  Well, we've got that now.
[02:43:37.823 --> 02:43:50.009]  That same organization, Homeland Security, we're just talking about collapsing the borders and then harassing people and charging them to grope them, to take away their freedom and their dignity at the airport.
[02:43:50.089 --> 02:43:54.891]  So I'm really surprised to see the Chamber of Commerce and Manufacturers saying,
[02:43:55.351 --> 02:43:57.632]  We don't want to have a nuclear war.
[02:43:57.673 --> 02:43:59.093]  I thought these guys would be all for it.
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:17.702]  Everybody that's real knows what's going on here.
[02:44:18.043 --> 02:44:23.808]  We're wasting over a trillion dollars in total expenses on the so-called military, industrial and cyber complex.
[02:44:24.709 --> 02:44:28.253]  And then you're looking again back at the real numbers here.
[02:44:29.114 --> 02:44:31.216]  The economy is going down.
[02:44:31.576 --> 02:44:35.500]  The people in the know know that we cannot afford more war.
[02:44:36.161 --> 02:44:37.942]  And that's what this Trends Journal is.
[02:44:38.002 --> 02:44:42.245]  Again, bring on peace, bring on prosperity.
[02:44:42.726 --> 02:44:48.670]  And what I'm launching, and we're going to be doing it in the following months, is an Occupy Peace movement.
[02:44:50.031 --> 02:44:54.254]  And anybody that wants to sign up, they can go to OccupyPeace.us.
[02:44:54.514 --> 02:44:55.795]  This is only for America.
[02:44:55.815 --> 02:44:57.636]  You want to do it in your country, you do it.
[02:44:58.117 --> 02:45:00.778]  And I'm up here in Colonial Kingston, New York.
[02:45:01.419 --> 02:45:03.240]  The 1777 Senate building, the oldest
[02:45:05.922 --> 02:45:11.143]  Public building in the United States is literally a stone's throw away from me.
[02:45:11.603 --> 02:45:16.624]  Every one of the founding fathers, no foreign entanglements.
[02:45:17.065 --> 02:45:19.185]  And that's what Occupy Peace is based on.
[02:45:19.665 --> 02:45:21.706]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:45:22.166 --> 02:45:24.066]  I see these guys on television.
[02:45:24.446 --> 02:45:28.507]  Cheney and Graham and this one and that one.
[02:45:28.787 --> 02:45:31.428]  What we have to do here, what we have to do there.
[02:45:32.458 --> 02:45:33.939]  You want to go in a foreign country?
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:37.863]  Send yourself, send your wife, send your kids.
[02:45:38.343 --> 02:45:40.145]  Keep me out of your psycho trip.
[02:45:40.625 --> 02:45:44.148]  All you do is create one disaster after another.
[02:45:44.528 --> 02:45:48.832]  So OccupyPeace.us is no foreign entanglements.
[02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:52.635]  Bring home all the troops, all the money, and re-
[02:45:53.951 --> 02:45:54.852]  I don't
[02:46:08.993 --> 02:46:15.215]  We can rebuild the country and help feed our own people and put them back to work.
[02:46:15.595 --> 02:46:19.936]  When we do that, I'm all in favor of opening the borders.
[02:46:20.376 --> 02:46:21.897]  Now, seal them tight.
[02:46:22.177 --> 02:46:24.477]  And by the way, I've been writing about this.
[02:46:24.537 --> 02:46:26.138]  Go back to Trend Tracking 1989.
[02:46:26.178 --> 02:46:28.338]  Go back to Trends 2000, Warner Books 1997.
[02:46:28.418 --> 02:46:28.678]  What a...
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:51.584]  Big shit was with the H-1B visas, with the immigration policy, they're destroying the nation, they're bringing in cheap labor, undercut our labor, and oh, we don't have any smart people in this country, we gotta bring them from India and China!
[02:46:51.844 --> 02:46:53.805]  We're just a bunch of imbeciles!
[02:46:54.741 --> 02:46:55.942]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:46:56.223 --> 02:46:57.244]  Even the imbeciles.
[02:46:57.284 --> 02:46:58.705]  You can't get a lousy job.
[02:46:59.266 --> 02:47:02.169]  You're talking about automation of automobiles.
[02:47:02.669 --> 02:47:03.891]  Drive them on their own.
[02:47:04.151 --> 02:47:05.592]  You don't need a driver.
[02:47:05.873 --> 02:47:06.734]  Check this out.
[02:47:07.054 --> 02:47:15.363]  The news thing is, when you go order some crappy corporate food, all you have to do, you don't need a waiter or a waitress.
[02:47:15.823 --> 02:47:17.385]  All you need to do is just
[02:47:17.665 --> 02:47:21.429]  Put it into your smartphone and it'll get delivered to you.
[02:47:21.730 --> 02:47:31.100]  So all those lousy jobs, when you look at the job numbers and quote the hospitality sector, they're even going to do away with them.
[02:47:31.761 --> 02:47:47.232]  Oh yeah, it's not just manufacturing, it's going to be service, it's going to be transportation, it's going to be automation everywhere, and that's going to accelerate the concentration of wealth into the hands of the few, it's going to increase the unemployment, and yet, we're told by, again, it's U.S.
[02:47:47.272 --> 02:47:53.416]  Chamber of Commerce and others are pushing for this uncontrolled immigration because they're telling us that we need a workforce.
[02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:57.039]  It was just last week that I was, I've been talking about this last couple of days,
[02:47:57.699 --> 02:48:03.724]  David Petraeus was at the Thatcher Conference on Liberty and he answered the question, after America, what's next?
[02:48:03.744 --> 02:48:04.625]  And he said, that's easy.
[02:48:05.025 --> 02:48:05.686]  North America.
[02:48:05.706 --> 02:48:06.907]  He starts talking about NAFTA.
[02:48:06.927 --> 02:48:16.995]  He talks about how right now we're going to go from a situation where we've got 100 people on an assembly line down to where we've got 100 robots and two people looking at them.
[02:48:17.075 --> 02:48:17.956]  So how do we deal with that?
[02:48:17.976 --> 02:48:20.218]  But he's excited about this demographic surge.
[02:48:20.278 --> 02:48:22.459]  So you know that it's something.
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:25.242]  Why would anybody listen to him?
[02:48:26.062 --> 02:48:26.963]  Read his words.
[02:48:27.003 --> 02:48:28.464]  We have them in the Trends Journal.
[02:48:28.884 --> 02:48:32.787]  Everything that he ever said came to nothing.
[02:48:33.107 --> 02:48:36.490]  Yo, you remember the troop surge in Afghanistan?
[02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:38.031]  Oh, brilliant, man.
[02:48:38.552 --> 02:48:40.513]  Oh, yeah, great job in Mosul.
[02:48:40.533 --> 02:48:41.994]  Hey, how about Fallujah?
[02:48:42.234 --> 02:48:43.815]  Yeah, Fallujah you!
[02:48:44.256 --> 02:48:49.340]  They're all losers and all they do, the prostitute media, they keep...
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:58.509]  Recycling the same guys and women over and over again that have done nothing, done nothing to destroy this country.
[02:48:58.789 --> 02:49:01.411]  Oh, and then you look at little David.
[02:49:01.792 --> 02:49:09.079]  David married a girl whose father was running West Point.
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:13.664]  That's right, another guy that got his ticket pumped.
[02:49:14.184 --> 02:49:14.584]  Punched.
[02:49:15.165 --> 02:49:19.027]  Punching his way up and brown nosing his way up the line.
[02:49:19.328 --> 02:49:21.029]  That's how these guys get there.
[02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:26.413]  I began my career, I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:49:26.653 --> 02:49:27.133]  At 23.
[02:49:27.253 --> 02:49:29.415]  The worst job I ever had.
[02:49:29.995 --> 02:49:35.139]  Oh, I'd be talking to my buddy, he'd lead me to follow the Senator, pull his chair, and help him sit down.
[02:49:35.199 --> 02:49:37.400]  He'd come back, I'd say, hey man, what's the matter?
[02:49:37.461 --> 02:49:39.162]  Cat can't sit down by himself?
[02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:40.562]  Need some help?
[02:49:41.143 --> 02:49:49.046]  All they are are suck-ups, they're brown noses, they don't have any courage, they don't have any dignity.
[02:49:49.066 --> 02:49:49.786]  You know what they have?
[02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:56.229]  They have a bad attitude and a lot of arrogance to tell us how we should live our lives.
[02:49:57.389 --> 02:50:01.952]  How could anybody allow what's going on in this country to keep going on?
[02:50:02.252 --> 02:50:14.039]  That's why I become emotional when I talk about what this nation used to be and how a bunch of little boys and girls have destroyed it and there's no courage out there among the people to say I had enough.
[02:50:14.399 --> 02:50:17.340]  And that's why we're launching Occupy Peace.
[02:50:17.681 --> 02:50:18.821]  You want to go to war?
[02:50:19.101 --> 02:50:21.103]  You're a traitor against Washington.
[02:50:22.188 --> 02:50:37.713]  You're a trait against the founding fathers, and I don't need some guy from Harvard, Princeton, or Yale to tell me that Washington, a real man, that was a commander-in-chief, not these little boys that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:50:38.034 --> 02:50:39.594]  Let them go to Washington.
[02:50:39.854 --> 02:50:45.576]  Let them go to Franklin and Adams and Madison and tell them they were all full of crap.
[02:50:45.996 --> 02:50:47.817]  No, you should go fight wars.
[02:50:48.157 --> 02:50:48.978]  That's right, Gerald.
[02:50:49.018 --> 02:50:57.923]  And of course, he's working for KKR now, and he's been to Bilderberg the last couple of years, so now he's an investment banker, going from the military to the CIA to an investment banker.
[02:50:57.943 --> 02:50:59.564]  We're going to be right back with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:50:59.884 --> 02:51:03.567]  Gerald, I want to get your take on Bloomberg's soda ban being turned over.
[02:51:03.947 --> 02:51:05.548]  Hang on, we'll be right back with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:51:08.228 --> 02:51:10.649]  Tired of paying outrageous prices for Viagra?
[02:51:10.709 --> 02:51:12.250]  Well, we have great news for you.

[02:51:39.106 --> 02:51:41.087]  Get Viagra for less than $3 a pill.

[02:51:55.577 --> 02:51:55.757]  Again, 1-800-478-9638.
[02:52:09.048 --> 02:52:10.109]  In the near future.
[02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:14.532]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:52:14.872 --> 02:52:15.893]  Security alert.
[02:52:16.113 --> 02:52:17.834]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:52:18.114 --> 02:52:18.735]  Analysis.
[02:52:18.975 --> 02:52:19.656]  InfoWars.
[02:52:19.716 --> 02:52:21.677]  Building independent media operations.
[02:52:21.697 --> 02:52:26.681]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:52:26.701 --> 02:52:27.661]  Prime Directive.
[02:52:27.741 --> 02:52:29.182]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:52:29.282 --> 02:52:32.064]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:52:32.124 --> 02:52:35.247]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:52:35.387 --> 02:52:37.628]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:52:37.668 --> 02:52:38.409]  These people are a
[02:52:38.629 --> 02:52:40.590]  They're never going to stop.
[02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:47.814]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:52:47.834 --> 02:52:55.699]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:52:56.059 --> 02:52:59.842]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:53:00.082 --> 02:53:01.222]  You can feel it.
[02:53:07.662 --> 02:53:11.487]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[02:53:12.558 --> 02:53:13.438]  Not in America.
[02:53:13.458 --> 02:53:14.919]  This can't happen in America.
[02:53:15.259 --> 02:53:19.000]  Because of my concern about our government, I was looking at survival stuff.
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:22.401]  I was raised as a Girl Scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[02:53:22.801 --> 02:53:28.042]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[02:53:28.062 --> 02:53:31.963]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, even as it's so good.
[02:53:31.983 --> 02:53:34.524]  I like the pricing for what I got.
[02:53:34.944 --> 02:53:37.105]  I like the containers they were shipped in.
[02:53:37.325 --> 02:53:40.906]  If they keep in touch with you, you get your emails, you get your confirmations.
[02:53:41.326 --> 02:53:44.689]  The customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:48.973]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[02:53:49.033 --> 02:53:50.174]  And it just came so quick.
[02:53:50.254 --> 02:53:51.796]  It came right when they said it would come.
[02:53:51.856 --> 02:53:57.441]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[02:53:58.002 --> 02:54:01.385]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted Food for Patriots.
[02:54:01.825 --> 02:54:04.508]  Go to GetSurvivalFood.com to learn more.
[02:54:04.788 --> 02:54:06.850]  That's GetSurvivalFood.com.
[02:54:10.747 --> 02:54:12.215]  I'm good.
[02:54:25.259 --> 02:54:26.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:30.983]  I'm David Knight and we have on the phone with us in this final segment, Gerald Salenti.
[02:54:31.003 --> 02:54:35.467]  Now Gerald, you were just holding up an ad from the paper showing that the U.S.
[02:54:35.507 --> 02:54:40.271]  Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups have taken out an ad calling for peace.
[02:54:40.331 --> 02:54:45.615]  We see that the Supreme Court yesterday is telling the police if they want to look at our phones, get a warrant.
[02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:52.940]  Now we've got a New York court, the New York Court of Appeals, striking down Bloomberg's soda ban.
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:54.020]  I mean, wake me up!
[02:54:54.661 --> 02:54:56.102]  Are things going our way or what?
[02:54:56.182 --> 02:54:57.623]  I mean, this is some good news.
[02:54:57.763 --> 02:54:58.564]  I never thought I would hear.
[02:54:58.584 --> 02:55:00.285]  I think I'm dreaming, or what's going on here?
[02:55:00.705 --> 02:55:02.386]  Well, you know, to some extent.
[02:55:02.987 --> 02:55:06.469]  And, you know, the soda ban thing, there's all this stupidity.
[02:55:06.569 --> 02:55:06.789]  Yeah.
[02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:08.390]  You know, no bullying zone.
[02:55:08.410 --> 02:55:10.352]  I love that one, too.
[02:55:10.452 --> 02:55:13.133]  Yeah, and a zero tolerance.
[02:55:13.574 --> 02:55:14.895]  It's the nanny state.
[02:55:14.975 --> 02:55:15.135]  Yeah.
[02:55:15.615 --> 02:55:22.078]  You know, we're coming out with the New Trends Journal, and one of the stories is going to be, don't blame Obamacare.
[02:55:22.098 --> 02:55:24.759]  It goes back to the soda ban.
[02:55:25.119 --> 02:55:26.160]  Blame I don't care.
[02:55:26.180 --> 02:55:27.360]  Oh, that's good.
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:29.041]  Look what this nation has become.
[02:55:29.861 --> 02:55:32.843]  And they try to, you know, we have an obesity problem.
[02:55:32.883 --> 02:55:34.023]  The numbers are much higher.
[02:55:34.063 --> 02:55:37.825]  There was a story out just yesterday about much worse than it is.
[02:55:38.185 --> 02:55:39.486]  The numbers are being reported.
[02:55:39.906 --> 02:55:41.827]  So we have all these drugs.
[02:55:42.167 --> 02:55:44.708]  They're trying to put soda bans, school things.
[02:55:45.328 --> 02:55:49.274]  We have a product that we believe can be FDA approved.
[02:55:49.655 --> 02:55:51.077]  It's called Tapazine.
[02:55:51.538 --> 02:55:52.499]  And it works like this.
[02:55:52.519 --> 02:55:56.265]  You cut off a piece of tape, and you put it in your mouth.
[02:56:01.385 --> 02:56:04.687]  You can't get a spoon in there, you can't get a knife in there, you're just duct tape solution.
[02:56:05.087 --> 02:56:14.873]  Well that's right, you know, because duct tape for... The side effects of the rip it off hurts a little bit, but what I'm trying to say is how about self-responsibility?
[02:56:15.533 --> 02:56:21.477]  How about enough of this crap for any jerk to tell us how we should live our lives?
[02:56:22.037 --> 02:56:22.377]  That's right.
[02:56:43.333 --> 02:56:45.495]  And so then you have the side effects.
[02:56:45.735 --> 02:56:57.922]  David, in this next Trends Journal, we're showing how the greatest cost to the American public in health care is going to be having to do with food and diet.
[02:56:58.402 --> 02:57:04.986]  The poison foods that we're eating and the enormous amounts that people are consuming.
[02:57:05.646 --> 02:57:12.635]  So when you go back to the story about the soda ban, you know, yeah, how about how about a mind ban, you know?
[02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:13.977]  Oh, yeah.
[02:57:14.057 --> 02:57:15.098]  It's all about.
[02:57:15.138 --> 02:57:16.940]  And again, it's all tied again.
[02:57:17.461 --> 02:57:24.109]  When people start showing dignity, courage and self-respect about themselves, they don't take.
[02:57:25.051 --> 02:57:34.957]  Bologna from a bunch of jerks that call themselves Commanders-in-Chief, Secretaries of this and that, Senators to Congressmen that.
[02:57:35.397 --> 02:57:44.502]  Well, and of course the people who have woken up to the health effects, who do want to take control of their lives, what they do is they hide that information from them on the labels.
[02:57:44.542 --> 02:57:45.663]  They don't want people to know.
[02:57:46.423 --> 02:57:48.464]  If they've got GMO products in there.
[02:57:48.504 --> 02:57:52.745]  They want to keep that information away from people, just like they don't want them to know what's in the vaccines or whatever.
[02:57:52.785 --> 02:57:54.665]  They don't want people to be informed.
[02:57:54.705 --> 02:58:06.308]  And yet at the same time, they say, well, you're doing things unhealthy because they put a lot of unhealthy stuff like high fructose corn syrup into so many different things that we eat and a whole litany of things.
[02:58:06.768 --> 02:58:11.029]  And they say, well, you're not taking responsibility of your life, so we're going to create this.
[02:58:11.069 --> 02:58:12.289]  This is an article on Bloomberg.
[02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:15.670]  Hospitals will see doughnuts to cigarette charges for health.
[02:58:15.970 --> 02:58:20.814]  So they're going to start nanny-stating everybody using the computer techno-state.
[02:58:21.275 --> 02:58:23.777]  Thank you so much for joining us today, Gerald Salenti.
[02:58:23.837 --> 02:58:26.139]  That's TrendsJournal.com.
[02:58:26.159 --> 02:58:27.240]  That's a great magazine.
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:28.341]  It comes out quarterly, right, Gerald?
[02:58:28.361 --> 02:58:29.642]  And you're about to have another issue.
[02:58:30.403 --> 02:58:32.645]  And we do Trends in the News each weekday night.
[02:58:33.165 --> 02:58:33.466]  Super.
[02:58:33.506 --> 02:58:34.166]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:34.486 --> 02:58:35.387]  Hey, thank you, David.
[02:58:35.407 --> 02:58:36.128]  Great being on with you.
[02:58:36.308 --> 02:58:36.708]  Thank you.

[02:58:59.232 --> 02:59:00.993]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:59:01.514 --> 02:59:08.478]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:59:08.939 --> 02:59:19.365]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:59:19.786 --> 02:59:28.992]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:59:29.732 --> 02:59:33.173]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:59:33.793 --> 02:59:37.214]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:59:37.554 --> 02:59:39.114]  Experience the new formula.
[02:59:39.614 --> 02:59:41.575]  Experience the ancient purity.

[02:59:43.515 --> 02:59:44.916]  Survival Shield X2.

[03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:17.431]  Big Brother.
[03:00:18.071 --> 03:00:19.112]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:19.833 --> 03:00:20.954]  Government cover-ups.
