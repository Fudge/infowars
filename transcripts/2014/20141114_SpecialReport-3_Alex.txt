[00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:14.687]  Hip-hop artist Nicki Minaj is known for stirring up controversy, but her latest music video has offended a little bit more people than usual.
[00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:21.852]  The video for the song, Only, is filled with Nazi imagery depicting Minaj and others as totalitarian dictators.
[00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:25.195]  It's complete with tanks, drones, stormtroopers,
[00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.236]  Drake is featured as the Pope.
[00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:30.377]  Chris Brown's uniform is modeled after a U.S.
[00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:30.798]  General.
[00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:35.260]  So these are all layers of things that are necessary in a totalitarian government.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.843]  Minaj and the video's director, Jeff Osborne, are now being attacked and accused of anti-Semitism.
[00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:51.128]  Now, when I first saw this video, I, like others, thought, oh great, what is this latest bit of propaganda being pumped out from the music industry to try and program us
[00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:53.389]  into accepting the New World Order.
[00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.611]  But then something really strange happened.
[00:00:56.031 --> 00:01:00.335]  After being accused of antisemitism, the director refused to apologize.
[00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:03.157]  He literally said, sorry, not sorry.
[00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:09.602]  Osborne says, I had an opportunity and an outlet to reach millions of people, so I wanted to make a statement.
[00:01:09.862 --> 00:01:16.207]  Osborne explains that he made this creative decision to show the juxtaposition of the most iconic form of totalitarianism
[00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:17.008]  I think.
[00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:37.155]  So Osbourne says he just wants to wake the youth up to totalitarianism and the world is in an uproar.
[00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:37.295]  Racist!
[00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:40.458]  But when Beyonce dons a futuristic dictator uniform,
[00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:58.394]  And leads a pack of militarized police up on the stage at the 2010 Grammys?
[00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.194]  No one says anything.
[00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:07.817]  It's, oh Queen Bey, she can do no wrong, so edgy, totalitarian police state, so trendy, what a feminist.
[00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:14.840]  Basically saying it's okay to glorify the police state, but heavens forbid you say it resembles fascism.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.842]  And don't even let these trendies come along and try and moot the debate using Godwin's Law.
[00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:30.167]  That's what they did in Nazi Germany when they would tell and like all the gay people and all the black people and all the Jews got put in camps because their neighbors were telling on them.
[00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:32.488]  I mean, is that, that's cool?
[00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:40.831]  No, but are you referring to government spying in today's society to Nazi Germany?
[00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:41.932]  Yes, I am.
[00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:42.752]  Okay.
[00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:50.754]  Why did you find it funny when I thought that everyone telling on their neighbors here with the whole see something say something and I referred it to Nazi Germany.
[00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:51.854]  Why was that funny to you?
[00:02:52.554 --> 00:02:59.376]  In any sort of debate, eventually if it goes on long enough someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.
[00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:04.297]  It's like gotten to like a silly point where like it doesn't like probably doesn't make any sense.
[00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.056]  But see, don't you think that that's something that stops people from having an intelligent discussion about where this is headed?
[00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:17.625]  There are people still alive today that succumbed to the Nazi regime and committed untold atrocities in its name.
[00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:21.449]  If it could happen to your grandparents, it can happen to you.
[00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.831]  Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:41.118]  So, while the lyrics to this song are pretty much trash and have absolutely nothing to do with the video's creative direction, in fact, when Nicki Minaj and the boys received the video, they were probably really excited about it because it made them all look like they were the elite ruling members of the New World Order.
[00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.400]  But the director, Jeff Osborne, is correct.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.125]  He says it's important to remind younger generations of atrocities that occurred in the past as a way to prevent them from happening in the future.
[00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:57.689]  And of course, the most effective way of connecting with people today is through social media and pop culture.
[00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.435]  Now, we already know that the occultic powers use art and pop culture to program us with subliminal messages and symbols.
[00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:13.321]  But in this case, it seems like one of our own on the inside hijacked the airwaves to expose the New World Order.
[00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:27.898]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:04:28.358 --> 00:04:38.062]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:42.165]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:47.390]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
