[00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.077]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.048]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:16.816]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:18.517]  Mainstream Media.
[00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:20.359]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.820]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.481]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:27.765]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:32.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.415]  I'm gonna try to be as
[00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:49.865]  I'll be as professional as I can today and try to hit all these balls that are getting shot out of this pitching machine at us.
[00:00:53.066 --> 00:01:01.370]  Something I haven't covered the last few days, only focusing on Ebola, or mainly focusing on Ebola and the economy and things like that, is Ferguson and St.
[00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.370]  Louis have blown up.
[00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:09.254]  Cops, more cops have been shot, more protesters have been shot, one being killed two days ago.
[00:01:10.478 --> 00:01:19.340]  And now angry protesters target quote wealthy whites, vandalize homes, burn US flags, assault reporters, call for officers death.
[00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.201]  So this is just absolutely spiraling out of control.
[00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:29.063]  And the photos and videos of the flag burning and all the rest of it is just over the top.
[00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:36.805]  So we're going to get into some of that today where our reporters obviously were on the ground in the middle of all that.
[00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:43.666]  And quite frankly, we saw a lot of bad behavior by the protesters and a lot of bad behavior by the police.
[00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:46.929]  But the Fed's posing as saviors when they gave the police the training.
[00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.132]  But now, the last few weeks, the police are getting shot at and shot.
[00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:55.415]  And that's escalating things.
[00:01:55.455 --> 00:02:00.799]  So I would expect to see looters being killed.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.701]  And more and more, the looters
[00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.991]  Are giving the First Amendment a very, very bad name, to say the least.
[00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:11.413]  Again, that's just a side note.
[00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:12.294]  I haven't covered that.
[00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:13.075]  I've been remiss.
[00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:18.879]  I have a tendency, when I've got something so giant and so massive, to not talk about it.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:33.992]  And I've tried to psychoanalyze what that is, and it's because I don't feel like I can properly break down how big something is until we've put it on paper as an article on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:45.909]  Dr. Edward Group is one of the most successful supplement nutraceutical formulators in the country.
[00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.173]  And he helps us formulate our line from fullwarslife.com.
[00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.276]  And he said he could come in.
[00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:54.998]  He flew into Austin late last night.
[00:02:56.215 --> 00:03:10.502]  He was in Las Vegas for the big internal research medical, Nutramedical trade show, the supply side event, biggest one in the country, for supplement development.
[00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:16.344]  And there were just medical doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, just crawling all over the place.
[00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:19.146]  But really they had impromptu breakaway meetings.
[00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:24.048]  And he met with multiple senior level current and former
[00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:28.980]  Border Patrol agents and ICE agents, and then had dinner with him.
[00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:29.941]  He was there for days.
[00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:44.150]  And the information he just gave us is that there are people coming in, and it's actually in the news today, strangely enough, that they're getting people coming in from West Africa that are sick, but they won't say what they have.
[00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.992]  Obviously, folks, West Africa has hundreds of millions of people.
[00:03:48.632 --> 00:03:50.854]  Nigeria's got like 200-something million alone in it.
[00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.074]  They're all trying to basically get out of the country.
[00:03:54.394 --> 00:03:55.996]  Most countries have shut down their borders.
[00:03:57.697 --> 00:03:57.977]  U.S.
[00:03:58.017 --> 00:04:00.339]  General, of course, warned days ago it could cross the U.S.
[00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.660]  border.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.586]  South Com, they've got all of Central and South America on their hands, up into Southern North America, Mexico.
[00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:10.688]  North Com's U.S.
[00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:17.314]  up into Canada, up into Alaska and the North Pole.
[00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:22.682]  And they told him, they said, listen, no, no, there's people coming up vomiting.
[00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:25.545]  The Border Patrol thinks they have Ebola.
[00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.768]  And it's the first time the Border Patrol's ever worked with the CDC.
[00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:32.772]  The CDC doesn't even want to know that it's a full-on emergency.
[00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:35.284]  They actually are responding.
[00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:36.305]  The first time I've ever seen them.
[00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:37.867]  Hundreds of vans.
[00:04:38.447 --> 00:04:39.428]  Black and white vans.
[00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.434]  And they're people in full hazmat suits just grabbing these people, throwing them in them, disappearing.
[00:04:44.454 --> 00:04:45.696]  And the Border Patrol's where they're going.
[00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:48.279]  They're supposed to put that down under federal law.
[00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.320]  They just go, don't worry about it.
[00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:53.624]  And there's just vans everywhere.
[00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:57.348]  And so we're going to send reporters down to the hot zones.
[00:04:57.368 --> 00:04:59.390]  I want to send Biggs right now.
[00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.499]  He loves a challenge, so whoever wants to volunteer to be the camera person to go with him, whether it's John Bowne or Josh Owens or whoever wants to go, saddle up.
[00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.501]  We got Intelware to send you.
[00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:13.808]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:17.931]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.713]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:27.619]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:28.740]  But for how long?
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.305]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:38.488]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:43.034]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:43.334 --> 00:05:51.357]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:56.599]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.301]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:01.321]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:15.998]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:16.498]  Security alert.
[00:06:16.838 --> 00:06:17.859]  Security alert.
[00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:19.801]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:20.681]  Analysis.
[00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:21.602]  InfoWars.
[00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.623]  Building independent media operations.
[00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:28.627]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:29.608]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.109]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:34.011]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:37.173]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:39.495]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:41.135]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:06:41.155 --> 00:06:43.476]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:45.637]  They are never going to stop.
[00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:49.838]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.180]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:57.661]  Imperative.
[00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:59.942]  Destroy Britain's Linux TV.
[00:06:59.962 --> 00:07:04.343]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:04.483 --> 00:07:05.984]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:06.744]  You can feel it.
[00:07:09.523 --> 00:07:19.705]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:26.446]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:28.766]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:31.927]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:38.828]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:07:38.988 --> 00:07:42.670]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male and then when Super Female came out.
[00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.351]  Tell us what happened.
[00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:48.254]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:07:48.394 --> 00:07:49.414]  Talk about the effects.
[00:07:49.714 --> 00:07:51.215]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:52.856]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:54.217]  I feel like I look better.
[00:07:54.277 --> 00:07:54.898]  I feel better.
[00:07:54.918 --> 00:07:56.018]  I feel sexier.
[00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:56.799]  I love it.
[00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.941]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:02.742]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:03.963]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:05.044]  Consult your physician.
[00:08:05.204 --> 00:08:07.385]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:08.486]  This is life changing.
[00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:31.708]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:42.424]  Dr. Edward Group is joining us in studio in the next hour.
[00:08:42.504 --> 00:08:49.590]  He just returned from a giant insider biggest in the country trade convention on supplements in Las Vegas.
[00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:56.616]  He met with current and former senior members of the Border Patrol and ICE that were there trying to research Ebola.
[00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:00.149]  And they also talked about Zach Taylor.
[00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:03.331]  So he came in and said one of the names we have to look into is Zach Taylor.
[00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.772]  He's confirmed a lot of this.
[00:09:05.193 --> 00:09:15.240]  We pulled up a video minutes ago during the break of Zach Taylor, the former deputy head of the Border Patrol, the head of the Border Patrol Union, now the head of the former Border Patrol Union.
[00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:21.644]  He's been on the broadcast talking about the plan to collapse the country, collapse the border, asymmetrical warfare.
[00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:32.671]  He's confirming that the Border Patrol already knows that they believe they're finding cases of Ebola on the border as Southcom came out two days ago and said they believe it's going to happen.
[00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:43.257]  They're getting ahead of it because they know the Border Patrol is leaking the information to warn the American people because overall it's a loyal federal agency and one of the few that's constitutional.
[00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:50.001]  If you read the Constitution, the government's supposed to issue the money and control the border and have a navy.
[00:09:51.922 --> 00:10:12.594]  But his sources, and he's going to be in studio with us in the second hour, Paul Watson's doing an article right now, have witnessed people with Ebola-like symptoms, vomiting, blood coming out of their rear ends, blood coming out of their eyes, coming across from West Africa and the Middle East,
[00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:17.146]  And they are being scooped up by CDC.
[00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:19.347]  Huge teams of vans.
[00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:21.788]  They've never before even seen the CDC down there.
[00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:24.670]  And the word is, oh no, the CDC's responding.
[00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.151]  They just don't want to panic.
[00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.671]  That's why they're saying everything's fine.
[00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:36.076]  And that they are scooping people up left and right on the Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California border.
[00:10:39.217 --> 00:10:40.358]  That is scary.
[00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:42.019]  And
[00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:45.187]  ...groups back there, and here's some of the names.
[00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:46.909]  I don't use this name, you can use that name.
[00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:49.311]  And one of the people they said we should talk to is Zach Taylor.
[00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:50.492]  He's got other sources.
[00:10:50.552 --> 00:10:51.353]  I go, Zach Taylor?
[00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.856]  I ran over here and I said, what's the name of the guy we have on?
[00:10:54.196 --> 00:10:58.120]  Who was the former head of the Border Patrol, deputy head of the Border Patrol, and then the head of the Union?
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.481]  Oh, that's Zach Taylor.
[00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:00.422]  Yeah, Zach Taylor.
[00:11:00.782 --> 00:11:01.884]  So we need to try to get him on.
[00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:05.487]  And then Watson comes up and goes, have you seen this?
[00:11:06.468 --> 00:11:15.491]  This is a CDC release admitting they're going to have sealed plastic coffin liners that can hold up to four dead bodies for an Ebola outbreak.
[00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:24.033]  And remember what they store outside the CDC in Atlanta was the millions of plastic coffins that they then scooped up and hid.
[00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:27.374]  I did a whole TV show with Jesse Ventura on that.
[00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:32.188]  And we even talked about Ebola, if I remember correctly, being one of the reasons.
[00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:34.810]  Unbelievable!
[00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.933]  This is all about to break at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:40.173 --> 00:11:46.737]  It's breaking here on the radio, but we're putting it together in text form, and it'll be out in the next hour, a basic report.
[00:11:46.797 --> 00:11:48.038]  Watson will then expand on it.
[00:11:48.438 --> 00:11:50.160]  They're all in their meeting right now.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.322]  So this is all unfolding.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:09.586]  Now, obviously, this is very, very serious news.
[00:12:12.488 --> 00:12:18.852]  And on the backdrop of this, we have the headline, Illegal Immigration Jumps for 3rd Straight Year Under Obama.
[00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:28.475]  Well, Jay Johnson, eh, Jay Johnson, says Americans are susceptible to claims that we have an open porous border.
[00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:37.020]  Well, we see the Border Patrol being ordered to give them vouchers and load the illegals with their families on the buses to go anywhere they want.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.822]  We see the illegals getting free health care everywhere.
[00:12:39.142 --> 00:12:44.846]  I'm not even against the individuals fleeing hellish third world conditions, except they're used as political tools.
[00:12:44.906 --> 00:12:49.729]  But let's be honest, this is going on, and the fact that you keep denying it only discredits you.
[00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:54.999]  That's Jay Johnson in CNS News and the Washington Times.
[00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:13.812]  While they let the planes fly in, while airport workers in New York and other major cities, LaGuardia and other areas, are refusing to work, and refusing to clean the planes, and now TSA people are starting to go off the job, because they don't want to be touching people.
[00:13:16.323 --> 00:13:21.147]  When they make other flight connections coming in from countries that are collapsing.
[00:13:21.627 --> 00:13:23.529]  Six countries, two of them near collapse.
[00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.772]  Estimated 1.4 to 5 million to get Ebola.
[00:13:28.053 --> 00:13:29.113]  They can't go anywhere else.
[00:13:29.153 --> 00:13:30.715]  They can't go to neighboring African countries.
[00:13:30.955 --> 00:13:31.916]  Those have been sealed.
[00:13:32.776 --> 00:13:40.603]  The Liberian president seeks more power to fight virus, restrict movement in public gatherings, which is what you've got to do to stop something like this.
[00:13:41.063 --> 00:13:45.607]  And our government at one level lets them fly in, but then we talk to the Border Patrol,
[00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.852]  And we've confirmed what group is telling us.
[00:13:51.554 --> 00:14:04.411]  He just got in last night from Las Vegas and the Border Patrol senior people are there hyperventilating, meeting with all these medical doctors and researchers and saying, you know, is there something that we can counter this?
[00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:05.713]  Is there something we can get?
[00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:21.677]  So we're going to codify all this information, get it into an article in the next hour that Paul Watson is working on that'll break at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:23.318 --> 00:14:24.679]  But I've got the red siren.
[00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:32.943]  The red siren is in here going today, a la DrudgeReport.com, because this
[00:14:36.144 --> 00:14:39.285]  Whole situation is so incredibly volatile.
[00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:42.746]  And that's how government operates, is in a schizophrenic fashion.
[00:14:43.486 --> 00:14:47.347]  The Coast Guard's trying to board ships and check to see if people are coming in from West Africa.
[00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:49.908]  That's default position, what you're supposed to do.
[00:14:51.268 --> 00:14:54.729]  The Marines are training for Ebola outbreaks in containing areas.
[00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.010]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.291]  Meanwhile, anything Obama directly controls,
[00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:14.442]  With these agencies, they're ordering open borders, they're ordering open flights coming in when nobody else is doing that, but then separately, our border patrol sources are saying no, they've actually got vans.
[00:15:14.703 --> 00:15:16.864]  I mean, we're talking dozens and dozens of vans.
[00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:18.146]  Per sector.
[00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:23.689]  Just scurrying around grabbing people, and then running off with them to containment centers.
[00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.815]  And the Border Patrol has to follow federal law about what's this person's name, where are they going, sign this form.
[00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:35.460]  And the CDC's like, no sir, with guys in hazmat suits and just throws them in trucks.
[00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:37.542]  And the Border Patrol's saying, where are they going?
[00:15:37.962 --> 00:15:39.424]  And by the way, they're going into the US.
[00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:42.146]  And so,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:48.362]  Dude just ran over here and said, because we're flying by the seat of our pants here, as stuff breaks, he goes, where do I send Biggs?
[00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:50.063]  Where do I send the camera people?
[00:15:50.963 --> 00:15:57.386]  We've got to wait, and you've got to go in there while Watson's debriefing group, and also checking with our border patrol sources.
[00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:02.228]  We need to get a Don Salazar to talk to his ICE sources, Jakari Jackson, his ICE sources.
[00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:10.391]  It was our ICE and border patrol sources that said, no, come to this border patrol checkpoint in McAllen, we're ordered
[00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:13.208]  To do something.
[00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:15.250]  I'm not allowed to tell you, just come.
[00:16:15.731 --> 00:16:25.824]  And we get there and the buses pull across from Mexico, the Border Patrol hands them vouchers with the city officials in McAllen, and then they load them on buses and ship them anywhere they want to go.
[00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:28.066]  We've forced mainstream media to admit that.
[00:16:28.979 --> 00:16:34.341]  It's an organized collapse of the country, and then the Border Patrol does not like being ordered to commit crimes.
[00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:38.902]  And that's what senior members have said that are current, but then were gagged on Fox News.
[00:16:38.922 --> 00:16:42.043]  They said, we complete the smuggling trafficking process.
[00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:48.925]  We complete the smuggling trafficking process under orders.
[00:16:49.807 --> 00:16:55.329]  And they've cut us down 70% in our apprehensions, and the ones we do apprehend are just released.
[00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:03.233]  And when violent felons build up in county and city jails, we are ordered to not go pick them up, and cities are disgorging them.
[00:17:03.473 --> 00:17:04.413]  Let me explain what that means.
[00:17:05.034 --> 00:17:07.675]  It means if you are particularly a Latin American,
[00:17:08.976 --> 00:17:23.745]  And you're running for murdering your wife, murdering your husband, robbing a bank, killing a police officer, whatever the case is, kidnapping, child molestation, drug dealing, whatever the cornucopia of things are, if you get to El Norte, baby!
[00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:25.566]  It's party time.
[00:17:26.227 --> 00:17:35.757]  The Mexican consulate, as part of their terrorist war against the republic with the globalists, will give you 5, 6, 7 consul matriculas with any fake name you want.
[00:17:36.277 --> 00:17:37.819]  Any major bank will accept those.
[00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:39.861]  Car loans, house loans, it's all been greased.
[00:17:42.043 --> 00:17:47.789]  And then you can just run around raping, stealing, killing, DWIs, hit and runs, you're above the law.
[00:17:49.670 --> 00:18:04.916]  Well now, if you've got a bunch of South American diseases that have already killed who they're going to kill, drug-resistant, drug-immune, bacteria, viruses, amoebas, liver flukes, wet leprosy, drug-resistant TB, look at the numbers.
[00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:06.996]  It's all spreading lavishly.
[00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:15.680]  Central and South America are so beautiful, because I've been to Central America, I've seen obviously videos of South America, that I would be down there all the time.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.741]  The only safer places are maybe Chile and
[00:18:20.393 --> 00:18:21.394]  A few other areas.
[00:18:25.277 --> 00:18:26.538]  And that's if you're in a rural area.
[00:18:27.198 --> 00:18:33.062]  It's a beautiful, beautiful continent.
[00:18:33.223 --> 00:18:35.364]  And isthmus, or I guess peninsula you'd call it.
[00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:38.607]  But it is contiguous unless you talk about the Panama Canal.
[00:18:39.447 --> 00:18:41.809]  But it is a literal green hell.
[00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:49.515]  And now green hell is spilling into North America.
[00:18:52.358 --> 00:18:59.783]  And so, we're just reporting, because we're saying the CDC's doing nothing, the CDC are letting it spread, because that's all the indicators we have.
[00:18:59.823 --> 00:19:01.805]  The CDC aren't going and cleaning up the apartment.
[00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:03.746]  They're telling sheriff's deputies to do it.
[00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:06.268]  How about, no thank you, that's not my job?
[00:19:06.288 --> 00:19:10.471]  It'd be better to leave it alone than send people that aren't prepared or trained into there.
[00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:12.712]  That's default common sense.
[00:19:13.433 --> 00:19:21.739]  Meanwhile, we've confirmed, oh no, the CDC is running around on the border, grabbing people that are sick, and they are disappearing.
[00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:26.008]  All part of this shadow government creepiness.
[00:19:26.469 --> 00:19:27.950]  Who knows what's going on?
[00:19:29.991 --> 00:19:38.276]  Duncan's family gives his medical records to AP, the man that died in Dallas a few days ago, Ebola, released from ER after registering 103 degree fever.
[00:19:38.616 --> 00:19:40.217]  Jesse Jackson said it was racism.
[00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:44.434]  No, they throw everybody out of the ER nowadays, folks.
[00:19:45.874 --> 00:19:51.757]  I couldn't get, until I threatened people with lawsuits and stuff, my finger reattached at the ER years ago.
[00:19:52.617 --> 00:19:54.438]  It's not because he was black, Jackson.
[00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:58.800]  They give basically everybody with a virus antibiotics.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.721]  I always make that point.
[00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:03.784]  It's that our healthcare system is collapsing, Jackson.
[00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:07.168]  And Obamacare that you support with death panels.
[00:20:07.628 --> 00:20:10.011]  Why don't you speak out against aborting black babies, punk?
[00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:14.175]  You've forgotten to monitor blockitpocket.com, haven't you?
[00:20:14.656 --> 00:20:16.578]  Oh, how quickly we forget.
[00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:19.661]  Blockit Pocket wants you to know that they never forget.
[00:20:19.841 --> 00:20:21.903]  You have a right to use wireless technology.
[00:20:21.903 --> 00:20:22.424]  We're good.
[00:20:39.557 --> 00:20:48.824]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:49.604]  This capitalism?
[00:20:49.664 --> 00:20:55.769]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:59.471]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:00.452]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:01.973]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:21:09.158 --> 00:21:12.320]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:20.606]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:21:20.847 --> 00:21:25.830]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:38.705]  News flash.
[00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:40.687]  Home invasions are on the rise.
[00:22:40.887 --> 00:22:43.350]  It takes less than 10 seconds to kick in a door.
[00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.391]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:48.291]  And what would happen if you're not home?
[00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:51.152]  EZ Armor is the ultimate security solution.

[00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:10.176]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[00:23:10.636 --> 00:23:14.518]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[00:23:14.798 --> 00:23:16.079]  What are you doing to prepare?
[00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:19.480]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.341]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:22.941]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:26.143]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[00:23:26.523 --> 00:23:29.404]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger
[00:23:29.864 --> 00:23:38.572]  And the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[00:23:38.892 --> 00:23:47.020]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:53.486]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[00:23:53.726 --> 00:23:54.667]  The crash is coming.
[00:23:54.947 --> 00:23:57.209]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:03.214]  Go to BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:24:03.594 --> 00:24:06.156]  That's BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.224]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:16.924 --> 00:24:19.186]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:51.872]  Well, Zach Taylor, the head of the Union for Retired Border Patrol Agents, two months ago said the CDC was showing up on the border, and we've got the video clip coming up, and just disappearing people that was never before seen, while telling everybody that diseases weren't coming across.
[00:24:53.953 --> 00:24:56.394]  But then at the same time, they're letting people that are sick through.
[00:24:56.454 --> 00:24:57.214]  That's been confirmed.
[00:24:57.735 --> 00:24:59.736]  We've confirmed from Border Patrol sources
[00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:05.401]  That it's currently going on with people with Ebola-like symptoms.
[00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.263]  I want to be clear.
[00:25:07.643 --> 00:25:08.965]  Border Patrol sources.
[00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:10.346]  High-level Border Patrol sources.
[00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:15.439]  CDC disappearing people with Ebola-like symptoms on border.
[00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:17.900]  And Watson's doing that article right now.
[00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:21.422]  I mean, Group had dinner with these people, with medical doctors.
[00:25:22.523 --> 00:25:32.568]  This is what is going on, what is being said, with the Border Patrol going to medical conferences and nutraceutical conferences trying to find out ways to protect their agents.
[00:25:33.456 --> 00:25:35.657]  Because what would you do if there's no vaccine?
[00:25:35.697 --> 00:25:36.417]  You can't trust it.
[00:25:36.817 --> 00:25:38.798]  You would try to find compounds that could.
[00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:45.361]  Obviously, that's what anybody with half a brain would be doing for their agents, their families, and everybody else.
[00:25:46.802 --> 00:25:55.926]  So you got all that going on while Jay Johnson, big brother, big sister's replacement, says that
[00:25:58.254 --> 00:26:05.259]  It is, quote, we have the clip of this, that Americans are susceptible to claims that we have an open porous border.
[00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:12.804]  Well, yeah, we're susceptible to seeing the sun come up in the morning, too, and susceptible to liking football.
[00:26:12.844 --> 00:26:14.045]  I mean, I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:26:14.065 --> 00:26:15.086]  I mean, this is a fact.
[00:26:18.528 --> 00:26:20.250]  There are death panels in Obamacare.
[00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:20.630]  Fact.
[00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.951]  Two plus two does equal four.
[00:26:22.051 --> 00:26:22.371]  Fact.
[00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:24.432]  Obama's a liar and came after our guns.
[00:26:24.492 --> 00:26:24.773]  Fact.
[00:26:25.675 --> 00:26:27.757]  Stop talking to us like we're idiots.
[00:26:28.277 --> 00:26:30.359]  It only discredits you morons more.
[00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.843]  Makes me so upset to see this going on.
[00:26:35.283 --> 00:26:35.984]  Immigration.
[00:26:36.004 --> 00:26:39.727]  Illegal immigration jumps for third straight year under Obama.
[00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:44.511]  And that's according to Homeland Security and Border Patrol's own numbers.
[00:26:47.033 --> 00:26:49.115]  You can link through to those in the Washington Times article.
[00:26:49.335 --> 00:26:51.437]  But don't worry about the actual numbers.
[00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:52.498]  Jay Johnson
[00:26:53.615 --> 00:26:57.957]  You know, he says so, so that's just the way it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:59.037 --> 00:27:00.457]  Because he decides what reality is.
[00:27:00.477 --> 00:27:03.238]  Remember Karl Rove said, the government now controls reality.
[00:27:03.939 --> 00:27:08.060]  And we'll tell you that we're always at war with East Asia one day, never at war with East Asia the next day.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.401]  And that brings me to this next point that I'm going back into Ebola.
[00:27:13.282 --> 00:27:14.462]  I want to play this clip coming up.
[00:27:16.243 --> 00:27:19.204]  CNN, all the other state-run media channels,
[00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:23.783]  Are running around saying, what's wrong with Turkey?
[00:27:24.604 --> 00:27:29.407]  They won't attack ISIS that's right over their border attacking these innocent, wonderful Kurds.
[00:27:29.887 --> 00:27:30.808]  What is their problem?
[00:27:31.489 --> 00:27:49.722]  And so the ambassador from Turkey comes out on CNN and goes, when we are given authorization from the NATO and everyone to create a safe zone, a buffer zone in Syria, we will go in and we will take out ISIS and Assad and the regime.
[00:27:51.448 --> 00:27:54.929]  That's Turkey armed and trained ISIS more than anybody else.
[00:27:55.269 --> 00:28:00.791]  Turkey's given them, in the last four years, artillery support every couple months and fighter-bomber support.
[00:28:01.832 --> 00:28:17.757]  So, I mean, this is the triumph of the lie, the triumph of fraud, the triumph of total deception and confusing geopolitical and geographic and cultural issues for the American people, the people of the West.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:26.302]  That our governments funded Al-Qaeda under other names, Khorasan, ISIS, ISIL, IS to confuse us.
[00:28:27.363 --> 00:28:31.704]  They're in there attacking Assad and the government, killing Christians, blowing everything up.
[00:28:32.184 --> 00:28:33.584]  Turkey can't get the job done.
[00:28:34.285 --> 00:28:41.507]  So they have ISIS turn east and go into Iraq to resupply and get a bunch of weapons so they can cough and go, they got all these U.S.
[00:28:41.547 --> 00:28:44.728]  trucks and armored vehicles and weapons and stingers out of U.S.
[00:28:44.768 --> 00:28:45.688]  bases we lost.
[00:28:45.768 --> 00:28:47.629]  Yeah, wink wink, not Benghazi.
[00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:53.613]  Then they infiltrate that back in on a big jihad and we've got to go in and what did I tell you?
[00:28:53.713 --> 00:29:00.657]  That they would take large zones of Syria and call them buffer zones.
[00:29:00.717 --> 00:29:02.658]  So Iraq gets part of Syria.
[00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.792]  Turkey gets part of Syria, sandwiching it, stealing the country!
[00:29:08.532 --> 00:29:09.933]  Stealing the oil fields!
[00:29:10.753 --> 00:29:22.700]  And then their military simulant, that was their excuse to be there, scurries off to the next country, gets on the next airlift, like the airlift of evil out of Afghanistan in 2001, being flown over the mountains into Pakistan.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:30.704]  And then next they pop up in Europe or here with Stinger missiles, shooting planes down, and no one will say, why did you give them Stinger missiles?
[00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:34.412]  So I want to play that clip when we come back.
[00:29:35.793 --> 00:29:37.114]  Of the Turkish ambassador.
[00:29:37.134 --> 00:29:38.154]  It's so disgusting.
[00:29:38.855 --> 00:29:40.556]  The Turkish envoy.
[00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:42.517]  He's the ambassador to fight ISIS.
[00:29:42.897 --> 00:29:44.138]  The BS ambassador.
[00:29:44.678 --> 00:29:47.820]  Getting it lined up where everyone begs them to invade Syria.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.242]  And he says, to bring down the regime.
[00:29:52.719 --> 00:29:56.862]  Well, we do want to go in to bring down the regime, and we will, as soon as you all beg us.
[00:29:57.182 --> 00:30:00.023]  And then they'll be like, oh, thank you, Turkey, for f- We're on the march.
[00:30:00.043 --> 00:30:00.744]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:30:00.764 --> 00:30:01.945]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.965 --> 00:30:03.806]  And they'll put Al Qaeda in to chop everybody's head off.
[00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:05.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:05.607 --> 00:30:07.368]  And the American people will go on to the next ballgame.
[00:30:07.448 --> 00:30:08.969]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:19.797]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:30:19.937 --> 00:30:29.682]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:29.862 --> 00:30:32.784]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:30:32.984 --> 00:30:33.605]  I think so.
[00:30:47.961 --> 00:30:48.201]  We're good.
[00:31:10.731 --> 00:31:16.113]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:17.373 --> 00:31:22.135]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:22.515 --> 00:31:29.318]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:33.719]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.561]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:31:49.397 --> 00:31:51.278]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:51.538 --> 00:31:53.059]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:55.900]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.263]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:32:00.463 --> 00:32:02.484]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:02.844 --> 00:32:05.046]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:05.546 --> 00:32:06.967]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:07.127 --> 00:32:07.567]  Got it.
[00:32:07.907 --> 00:32:08.708]  Others don't.
[00:32:09.867 --> 00:32:18.876]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:18.956 --> 00:32:27.203]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:27.364 --> 00:32:32.048]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:32.228 --> 00:32:38.955]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:39.015 --> 00:32:46.101]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:46.201 --> 00:32:53.068]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:53.228 --> 00:32:57.570]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.951]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:33:01.091 --> 00:33:07.214]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:07.394 --> 00:33:09.055]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:26.132]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:36.571 --> 00:33:54.458]  Headline on Infowars.com, you can feel the energy worldwide crackling in the atmosphere as we surge and accelerate deep into the 21st century and the singularity and all the good, the bad and the ugly that will come with it.
[00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:01.921]  The old Chinese proverb, may you live in interesting times, both a positive and a negative.
[00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.691]  Expect confrontation and violence in Ferguson this weekend.
[00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:09.852]  Curt Nemo, top story, Infowars.com.
[00:34:10.493 --> 00:34:15.194]  More police shot at, more police shot, more citizens shot as it escalates out of control.
[00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:17.715]  Video, now in, it's now happening in St.
[00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:18.055]  Louis.
[00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:22.057]  Homes are now being attacked, open racial warfare unfolding.
[00:34:22.817 --> 00:34:23.377]  Video!
[00:34:23.517 --> 00:34:24.898]  Man pulled off U.S.
[00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:27.819]  Airways flight after joking he had Ebola.
[00:34:28.459 --> 00:34:28.739]  U.S.
[00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:29.299]  officials.
[00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:31.760]  Ebola could spread through open southern border.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.661]  We had the text on this on Wednesday.
[00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:37.802]  We now have the video of the head of South Com saying it.
[00:34:38.062 --> 00:34:38.843]  That's coming up.
[00:34:39.363 --> 00:34:39.663]  U.S.
[00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:43.164]  has more sanctions against Russia than against Ebola.
[00:34:43.224 --> 00:34:44.585]  Paul Craig Roberts article.
[00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:49.887]  That is just some of the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:51.587 --> 00:35:05.159]  But first, I want to play this CNN clip that I mentioned earlier with Turkey's envoy in the fight against ISIS that they literally armed and trained, gave air support, artillery support to.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.625]  But they don't totally run it, so it's kind of running off on its own into Iraq, coming back in, attacking the Kurds.
[00:35:12.906 --> 00:35:15.148]  So the Kurds are rioting and attacking inside Turkey.
[00:35:15.448 --> 00:35:18.451]  The Turkish newspapers say what I'm saying, because they live there, they know.
[00:35:19.315 --> 00:35:24.419]  That Turkey runs ISIS, it's really Al-Qaeda, they're killing them, they better stop or they're going to burn down Turkey.
[00:35:24.439 --> 00:35:26.481]  That's their response, protesting.
[00:35:27.702 --> 00:35:29.223]  Which I think is very legitimate to be angry.
[00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:32.906]  And so our media is like, yeah, Turkey, get in there, do something.
[00:35:33.991 --> 00:35:37.853]  So Turkey says, OK, we do want to take out ISIS and take down the regime.
[00:35:38.454 --> 00:35:41.175]  That means the government that's fighting ISIS.
[00:35:41.916 --> 00:35:46.318]  But they want a mandate for everyone to tell them to do it and beg them to do it.
[00:35:46.358 --> 00:35:50.761]  And, oh, look, Turkey's not conquering Syria, what they've done before.
[00:35:52.245 --> 00:35:56.369]  No, Turkey is just coming in to fight Al-Qaeda, who they trained.
[00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.213]  I mean, this is total problem, reaction, solution.
[00:36:00.573 --> 00:36:02.455]  This is naked in front of everybody.
[00:36:02.815 --> 00:36:11.204]  Here is CNN's Communist News Network discussion of this, and this is how they fool the people of the world in this scripted deception.
[00:36:11.604 --> 00:36:13.247]  We are ready to do everything.
[00:36:13.787 --> 00:36:21.058]  If there is a clear strategy that after ISIS we can be sure that our border will be protected.
[00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:24.103]  We don't want the regime anymore on our border.
[00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:27.824]  Pushing people against, towards Turkey.
[00:36:28.304 --> 00:36:32.426]  We don't want other terrorist organizations to be active there.
[00:36:32.866 --> 00:36:35.007]  So, we have a national strategy.
[00:36:35.547 --> 00:36:44.030]  The basic parameters of this national strategy is humanitarian parameter, which we are receiving Syrians and Iraqis.
[00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.991]  We want this humanitarian policy on the other side of
[00:36:47.711 --> 00:36:51.012]  Could I just be sure that I've understood you?
[00:36:51.032 --> 00:36:53.794]  Turkey, under certain circumstances, is prepared to put boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:37:10.463 --> 00:37:12.106]  Uh, do their own part.
[00:37:12.788 --> 00:37:19.383]  So if the plan would be to also degrade the Assad regime, that's one of your conditions?
[00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:19.724]  Of course.
[00:37:20.498 --> 00:37:31.683]  Of course, because we believe that if Assad stays in Damascus with this brutal policy, if ISIS goes, another radical organization may come in.
[00:37:31.703 --> 00:37:35.485]  By the way, Turkey is more brutal.
[00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:42.188]  I've studied it, but no one says it because they're part of NATO and the whole fraud, former seat of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:43.409]  You talk about brutal.
[00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.031]  Turkey sits there out of Istanbul.
[00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:51.954]  Formerly Constantinople, the head of the Byzantine Empire, sacked.
[00:37:52.995 --> 00:37:53.636]  Taken over.
[00:37:55.478 --> 00:37:56.539]  But that's another issue.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:07.168]  Talking about Assad being brutal, when democratization is what they used under Assad to infiltrate with the Al Qaeda forces.
[00:38:07.709 --> 00:38:10.391]  But that's political illiteracy for you.
[00:38:10.772 --> 00:38:14.095]  They know the people of the world are politically illiterate.
[00:38:16.991 --> 00:38:26.176]  That's why George Bush would say that Iran was behind Al-Qaeda, and Mohammed Karzai would say, sir, that's not true, you know, because in the Middle East, everybody just knew that was ridiculous.
[00:38:26.716 --> 00:38:35.201]  That's like saying that the San Francisco 49ers are the New England Patriots.
[00:38:35.281 --> 00:38:38.743]  I mean, to football fans, it's just total bull.
[00:38:41.165 --> 00:38:43.326]  Doesn't matter what team you're on, you know the teams.
[00:38:46.694 --> 00:38:49.878]  The Houston Texans are not the Minnesota Vikings.
[00:38:51.079 --> 00:39:02.771]  You can call it a conspiracy theory if you want that I know what something is, but when you know the players, and it's so fun to know the boarders and the players and the backgrounds, it's so addicting to learn this stuff.
[00:39:02.971 --> 00:39:05.073]  And the more you learn and get into it, the more you want to learn.
[00:39:06.502 --> 00:39:20.588]  That's how I can have former top CIA analysts on, I'm not bragging, and have open, full discussions with them, and they teach me stuff, I teach them things, and they're all so impressed, because they go have briefings with generals that don't know this stuff, because the general just wants to go see their mistress, and go play golf, and get along.
[00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.848]  Because they're not a real general.
[00:39:22.628 --> 00:39:26.250]  A real general would be studying this stuff constantly, because it's so addicting.
[00:39:27.523 --> 00:39:28.984]  So I'm not saying I'm that smart.
[00:39:29.324 --> 00:39:32.086]  I'm saying anybody could learn this if you wanted to get into it.
[00:39:32.126 --> 00:39:34.227]  See, I don't know baseball scores of Babe Ruth.
[00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:37.650]  I don't know Mickey Mantle scores.
[00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.051]  I think he was married to Marilyn Monroe.
[00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:39.571]  I do know that.
[00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:40.852]  Or was it Joe DiMaggio?
[00:39:40.892 --> 00:39:41.212]  I forget.
[00:39:41.592 --> 00:39:42.413]  Things like that are interesting.
[00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:46.616]  But I don't know about how many, what they batted a certain year.
[00:39:47.392 --> 00:39:50.994]  I don't know, you know, about the steroid investigations in Congress, because I don't care.
[00:39:51.735 --> 00:39:55.277]  I don't know about all the little petty things that don't affect me or my family.
[00:39:55.798 --> 00:40:10.107]  What I do know is criminals run our government, they're six foreign banks, they're shutting our liberties down, and they're funding Al-Qaeda and using them to attack Western interests as a pretext to take our liberties away in the name of stopping them.
[00:40:10.347 --> 00:40:17.212]  And it's an outrageous criminal plan, and it's totally naked now, and one group knows about it now.
[00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:21.738]  Not lionizing, not sanctifying them.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.041]  The military, though.
[00:40:24.061 --> 00:40:24.762]  It's just a fact.
[00:40:25.643 --> 00:40:33.534]  The military, even at the lowest levels, is trained to know who these groups are, to know what flags are, to know what uniforms are.
[00:40:33.794 --> 00:40:35.016]  They all know it's Al Qaeda.
[00:40:37.026 --> 00:40:48.211]  And the globalists screwed up, just because the American people don't know which end is up, on average, and love death panels and think 2 plus 2 equals whatever Obama says, and are into all the hype and watch all the money.
[00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:55.414]  The military and the brash, right down to the enlisted people, now know.
[00:40:56.215 --> 00:41:03.318]  So I don't know what you're going to do to fix that, because when you shoot stuff down with the Stinger missiles, and you blow up a nuclear power plant or whatever you're planning,
[00:41:04.397 --> 00:41:08.479]  Whatever you have your Al Qaeda people do, or whatever you blame on them, to try to grandstand and take freedom.
[00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:11.920]  It's not going to happen in a vacuum, okay?
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.041]  And I just want to get that message across to you one more time.
[00:41:16.442 --> 00:41:20.523]  You could shut me up, kill me, shut up and kill other people.
[00:41:22.704 --> 00:41:23.764]  Message already got sent.
[00:41:23.784 --> 00:41:26.866]  I already blew the horn up on the castle wall.
[00:41:26.886 --> 00:41:29.607]  I already lit the signal fires on the mountaintops.
[00:41:30.107 --> 00:41:31.067]  I lit a signal fire.
[00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:32.668]  Other people lit signal fires.
[00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:35.250]  Message was already sent.
[00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:36.691]  Horn already got blue.
[00:41:37.072 --> 00:41:38.153]  Alarm already got pulled.
[00:41:40.675 --> 00:41:42.337]  And I can see the chain reaction.
[00:41:42.357 --> 00:41:44.159]  There's nothing you can do to stop it.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.484]  It's gonna spread like a good virus through your infected body and it's gonna bring you down.
[00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:51.786]  World War III won't save you.
[00:41:52.307 --> 00:41:54.429]  Nothing will put your system back together again.
[00:41:54.449 --> 00:41:56.751]  I suggest you surrender now.
[00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:00.384]  And hey, we'll give you abstention.
[00:42:00.564 --> 00:42:03.387]  We'll send you to ALBA, like Napoleon.
[00:42:04.207 --> 00:42:05.569]  You can even have part of your money.
[00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:06.449]  Stop it.
[00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.491]  We realize you're dangerous when cornered.
[00:42:08.951 --> 00:42:09.552]  So are we.
[00:42:11.494 --> 00:42:14.896]  You could have had the whole world New World Order, but you wanted our souls.
[00:42:15.177 --> 00:42:17.238]  You wanted to run individuals' lives.
[00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:18.880]  You wanted to attack freedom.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.922]  You wanted to degrade justice.
[00:42:21.742 --> 00:42:22.743]  Because it threatened you.
[00:42:22.823 --> 00:42:23.504]  You didn't like it.
[00:42:24.144 --> 00:42:25.946]  Like a cockroach, suddenly like a spotlight.
[00:42:28.752 --> 00:42:29.893]  So you wouldn't give us quarter?
[00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:36.559]  And now everyone in the system realizes there's no prosperity at the end of where you're taking us.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:42.966]  And the whole system now is turning against Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the New World Order.
[00:42:45.828 --> 00:42:53.816]  The Dutch royalty, the Transylvanian royalty, the German royalty, the Rothschild power axis, the Rockefeller crime syndicate.
[00:42:55.442 --> 00:43:06.585]  All of it is an abomination sold out to evil, using evil techniques to take control, and once you use evil for power, you can't stop using the Ring of Mordor.
[00:43:07.705 --> 00:43:14.687]  It will consume you, and you are creatures of your father, creatures of your God.
[00:43:19.986 --> 00:43:25.669]  So, we have that little tidbit going on, and then we have the disgusting continual saga.
[00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:32.572]  The most perfect, beautiful example of the disgustingness of royalty.
[00:43:33.192 --> 00:43:45.098]  The disgustingness of state-run, hegemonic, genetic, paternal lines.
[00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:48.360]  Or maternal, with that Queen of England over there.
[00:43:49.947 --> 00:43:55.390]  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un misses shrine visit.
[00:43:56.051 --> 00:44:05.756]  Oh, a shrine to that pile of stinking skulls and dehumanization and those zombies with their souls sucked out, those poor North Koreans.
[00:44:05.856 --> 00:44:15.782]  I mean, my God, if we need any reason to oppose the giant state and the collectivist, North Korea is written on the wall in fiery, flaming letters.
[00:44:16.682 --> 00:44:25.429]  It screams out like another fire on the hill, the watchtower ablaze, that this is not where we want to go.
[00:44:25.449 --> 00:44:32.134]  He's been gone for over a month, hasn't been seen since September 3rd.
[00:44:32.474 --> 00:44:34.195]  We have a video clip on that I want to play.
[00:44:35.716 --> 00:44:42.762]  As they sit there with straight faces going, and the brass feels bad being purged, twits, the military over there.
[00:44:43.994 --> 00:44:44.495]  I don't
[00:45:01.673 --> 00:45:11.582]  This total narcissist, so disconnected he thought Dennis Rodman was cool, and then they would sit around with top leaders as he smoked cigarettes, watching basketball games.
[00:45:11.702 --> 00:45:15.485]  I mean, bizarro, Twilight Zone on PCP.
[00:45:17.587 --> 00:45:18.228]  This is hell.
[00:45:20.149 --> 00:45:28.317]  With tens of millions of people starving, millions starving a year, Vanity Fair doing a report there admitting the only meat sold on city streets was little baby parts.
[00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:38.659]  And that's all the wealthy can hardly get is long ham, sweet pork, human meat, as it's known, by Kipling.
[00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:45.847]  Rudiger, I guess he popularized that term, that's what was used by some of the islanders.
[00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:55.708]  And then the ultra-rich, the ultra-comedy elite, they have the finest stakes, MRIs, everything for themselves in tiny little command bases.
[00:45:56.209 --> 00:46:06.020]  And he has a seven-story pleasure palace where they kidnap Japanese and South Korean film stars and then ship them in by private jet so they can come in and
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:13.303]  Imagine Kim Jong-un coming in or his dad Kim Jong-il coming in like Baron Harkonnen to pull your heart plug.
[00:46:13.343 --> 00:46:21.966]  I mean, just total weakness piled on filth, piled on failure, just like a vampire with its hunchback leering.
[00:46:22.186 --> 00:46:23.947]  I mean, this is the spirit of the enemy.
[00:46:24.667 --> 00:46:27.168]  No manliness, no honor, no strength.
[00:46:29.468 --> 00:46:39.435]  I mean, a real red-blooded man, I don't care what color you were, can you imagine giving a hundred Kim Jong-ils a club and getting in a warehouse locked up with them?
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.563]  And you had a club which you could do to a hundred Kim Jong-uns?
[00:46:44.003 --> 00:46:47.927]  I mean, just the fact that he... It's just screaming failure!
[00:46:48.408 --> 00:46:49.649]  Screaming weakness!
[00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:50.990]  And then we look at our enemies.
[00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:56.836]  MSNBC, Obama, the globalists, all these UN people, they're all the same!
[00:46:56.856 --> 00:46:58.277]  They're Kim Jong-un wannabes!
[00:46:58.497 --> 00:46:59.518]  They're nobodies!
[00:46:59.779 --> 00:47:00.820]  No one wants them!
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.101]  No one loves them!
[00:47:02.321 --> 00:47:03.622]  They have no power!
[00:47:03.842 --> 00:47:05.143]  They have no energy!
[00:47:05.343 --> 00:47:06.884]  They have no soul!
[00:47:07.164 --> 00:47:08.685]  They have no renaissance!
[00:47:08.925 --> 00:47:10.326]  They have no lightning!
[00:47:10.787 --> 00:47:13.428]  They are complete, pathetic maggots!
[00:47:13.949 --> 00:47:16.751]  Absolutely trying to strangle human beauty!
[00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:18.832]  Strangle human competition!
[00:47:19.152 --> 00:47:21.714]  Strangle our mission to colonize space!
[00:47:22.054 --> 00:47:26.557]  Strangle our mission to ascend into what God has planned for us!
[00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.959]  These people cannot rule over us!
[00:47:29.219 --> 00:47:30.380]  Cannot control us!
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.761]  And should not exist!
[00:47:33.582 --> 00:47:35.304]  They are disease!
[00:47:36.946 --> 00:47:38.527]  I can't even look at Kim Jong-un.
[00:47:39.028 --> 00:47:42.171]  It can be like midnight, I'm going coast to coast to him and I'm totally exhausted.
[00:47:42.411 --> 00:47:43.472]  I'll let you have a trade secret.
[00:47:43.773 --> 00:47:46.275]  The old days I'd drink a few beers because they have a stimulus effect on me.
[00:47:46.295 --> 00:47:46.916]  I don't do that anymore.
[00:47:48.553 --> 00:48:01.500]  Now, I pull up Hollywood people, or Kim Jong-un, or Obama, or Hillary, and I instantly get energy just looking at these demons, looking at the scum that rules over us through fraud and deception.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:11.125]  That's why they poison our water and dumb us down, because any straight-backed, head-screwed-on, even half-decent person would never live under such trash.
[00:48:11.745 --> 00:48:16.208]  Let's go to a clip of CNN that I'm analyzing today here.
[00:48:17.188 --> 00:48:30.542]  Talking about another tyrannical regime when they're trying to build one like that here, again saying our kids don't basically belong to us, and men are inherently bad, and the state is God, and questioning the dear leader Obama is racist.
[00:48:31.043 --> 00:48:33.926]  They would love to live in a place like this!
[00:48:34.366 --> 00:48:35.607]  They hate your success!
[00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:36.828]  They hate your strength!
[00:48:37.028 --> 00:48:38.129]  They hate your passion!
[00:48:38.289 --> 00:48:39.850]  They hate the fact you love God!
[00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:49.157]  They hate the fact that they don't have a monopoly of weapons so they can have their way with us like Kim Jong Un and the demonic coteries of little demons that encircle him!
[00:48:50.686 --> 00:49:00.212]  So of course he's been swallowed up or dead or committed suicide or been murdered in some internal coup in that hellish pit that is a prison for all these demons!
[00:49:00.613 --> 00:49:02.534]  They're building their own destruction!
[00:49:02.734 --> 00:49:04.515]  Their own mass guillotine!
[00:49:04.996 --> 00:49:06.557]  Let's go ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:06.997 --> 00:49:09.439]  What you're seeing here is the human spirit refusing to submit.
[00:49:09.939 --> 00:49:12.280]  I am crazed and raged against them.
[00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:20.526]  I am sending out the call as a siren to warn people that their humanity and their free will is under attack!
[00:49:21.587 --> 00:49:28.231]  And by the most pathetic scum that you'd ever just see them for one moment and ever just realize what they are for one moment.
[00:49:28.391 --> 00:49:33.874]  They could be swept aside and a true renaissance could begin that is unbelievably incredible.
[00:49:34.814 --> 00:49:37.296]  Made of our dreams, made of your passion.
[00:49:37.716 --> 00:49:40.098]  That's what I want you to have is control of your own destiny.
[00:49:40.538 --> 00:49:46.241]  That's all I want and I want to be able to have control of my own passion and to be what I really am.
[00:49:46.341 --> 00:49:47.362]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:49:48.274 --> 00:49:55.345]  Last time the world saw North Korea's young leader Kim Jong-un, he was clearly limping, on his way, according to state media, to a rock concert.
[00:49:55.946 --> 00:49:59.731]  He's a man whose every move has been glorified in word and music.
[00:50:01.554 --> 00:50:03.497]  He craves the spotlight, whether by horse.
[00:50:04.358 --> 00:50:05.238]  Going to the amusement park.
[00:50:05.458 --> 00:50:07.599]  We're hanging out with basketball star Dennis Rodman.
[00:50:07.639 --> 00:50:08.399]  Oh, I hate Dennis Rodman.
[00:50:08.519 --> 00:50:15.560]  So Kim's five-week disappearance from the public eye has fueled endless rumors of bad health, a coup, even death.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.300]  North Korea, in one way, is a cult.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.741]  And a leader has to be seen.
[00:50:20.761 --> 00:50:22.041]  Especially a new leader.
[00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:24.601]  So Kim Jong-un toured around the country.
[00:50:24.942 --> 00:50:26.562]  And then all of a sudden, he disappeared.
[00:50:26.642 --> 00:50:29.022]  He hasn't been seen in public since September 3.
[00:50:29.442 --> 00:50:33.523]  So that by itself, if nothing more, indicates that there's something really wrong.
[00:50:33.723 --> 00:50:34.043]  Oh, really?
[00:50:34.063 --> 00:50:35.664]  Look at the other people around him.
[00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:36.524]  Look at these laborers.
[00:50:36.544 --> 00:50:36.985]  Look at him.
[00:50:37.145 --> 00:50:37.525]  Look at him.
[00:50:37.545 --> 00:50:39.026]  Look at that little psycho demon.
[00:50:55.934 --> 00:50:58.656]  In fact, in less than three years... We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:58.756 --> 00:51:01.578]  You want to live under total government like this?
[00:51:01.598 --> 00:51:02.438]  You want to live under freedom.
[00:51:02.618 --> 00:51:06.981]  Because America and the whole West is going the way of Kim Jong-un's toilet.
[00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:08.061]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:08.081 --> 00:51:08.602]  Stay with us.

[00:52:17.249 --> 00:52:25.114]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:29.677]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:33.700]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:39.564]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.

[00:53:58.991 --> 00:54:02.379]  As it was the first day we sold it, a healthy heart is a happy heart.

[00:54:32.204 --> 00:54:51.599]  More than a hundred years ago, top industrial scientists, mathematicians, statisticians are on record, there have been literally thousands of books probably written, I'm aware of scores, in the last hundred years, documenting that with the industrialization and development of sciences, people should work two or three days a week,
[00:54:52.759 --> 00:54:56.260]  Be able to focus on language arts, raising humanities development.
[00:54:56.761 --> 00:55:02.103]  So high taxes and regulations are brought in to do what the Federal Reserve calls stopping overheating.
[00:55:04.204 --> 00:55:14.848]  And that's to stop areas of the economy they don't fully control, local sectors, and one crop, local economies and other things, to be shut down basically or milked.
[00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:20.619]  Because it's not enough to have all the fiat money at the Federal Reserve or the IMF or World Bank.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.841]  You've got to be able to control your competition.
[00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:23.842]  That's the real power.
[00:55:24.903 --> 00:55:26.324]  So they create artificial scarcity.
[00:55:26.905 --> 00:55:33.330]  And that's what Agenda 21 and Cloward and Piven and all of it's about, is keeping the people under control, under resources.
[00:55:34.451 --> 00:55:36.132]  That's how you control slaves or sharecroppers.
[00:55:37.593 --> 00:55:39.895]  Everything I'm saying here is just common sense.
[00:55:42.257 --> 00:55:44.199]  And it's been done in history over and over again,
[00:55:46.914 --> 00:55:50.456]  But now it's going to end up causing world war, if it continues.
[00:55:52.357 --> 00:56:09.225]  And so that's the real crime of these people, is they're trying to shut down society and civilization while blocking clean technologies, while running boondoggles for fake new clean technologies, to just consolidate power, to create neo-feudal serfdom in the UN's own words.
[00:56:09.345 --> 00:56:13.007]  That's the model they want in the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996.
[00:56:16.158 --> 00:56:17.619]  I cover it in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:18.019 --> 00:56:18.720]  Show the documents.
[00:56:20.561 --> 00:56:23.483]  Interview top professors, like Kaufman, that's been to the UN meetings.
[00:56:24.224 --> 00:56:24.864]  Lord Monckton.
[00:56:26.365 --> 00:56:27.386]  So this is their plan.
[00:56:28.187 --> 00:56:31.149]  Is to bankrupt you, is to dumb you down, is to poison you.
[00:56:31.389 --> 00:56:32.990]  Like you're a roach, they're spraying with poison.
[00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.633]  On their power trip, they've decided, we're just gonna roll over and die.
[00:56:36.913 --> 00:56:38.374]  How about if we don't go along with that?
[00:56:38.554 --> 00:56:40.615]  How about if we identify them and their program?
[00:56:41.456 --> 00:56:43.678]  Instead of Hollywood stars and who's pregnant this week.
[00:56:44.676 --> 00:56:49.738]  See, the minute you start focusing on what's important, and not on what they tell you is important, is game over.
[00:56:50.359 --> 00:56:52.280]  I'm not going to eat what Michelle Obama says.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.561]  I'm not going to buy the clothes she points and tells me to get.
[00:56:56.041 --> 00:56:57.002]  You're like, well of course you're not.
[00:56:57.222 --> 00:56:59.343]  Well, that's because you're not under their control.
[00:56:59.743 --> 00:57:01.024]  Most people are, folks!
[00:57:02.244 --> 00:57:02.885]  What a joke!
[00:57:04.465 --> 00:57:04.986]  What a joke!
[00:57:07.787 --> 00:57:09.027]  I got a lot of stock market news.
[00:57:09.067 --> 00:57:10.408]  Biggest plunge of the year yesterday.
[00:57:10.468 --> 00:57:11.789]  It's basically flat today.
[00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:17.872]  A lot of other interesting news on Ebola, a lot of interesting news on St.
[00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:18.232]  Louis.
[00:57:18.312 --> 00:57:19.233]  We're going to be covering it all.
[00:57:20.094 --> 00:57:22.595]  Briefly, it's that time of day, about to go to noon central.
[00:57:23.456 --> 00:57:26.558]  Shows are aired in time zones all over the country, but we're here live at 11 a.m.
[00:57:26.578 --> 00:57:26.938]  to 2 p.m.
[00:57:26.978 --> 00:57:30.180]  I'm going to take my second dose of the day of DNA Force.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.301]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:57:33.237 --> 00:57:47.482]  On record, you can read the patented studies at Infowarslife.com on the BioPQQ and all the other substances that are in it that are known to promote mitochondrial detoxification, growth, telomeres, immune system, you name it.
[00:57:47.502 --> 00:57:53.285]  This is what I'm doing for myself and my family and it's had an amazing effect on my energy, my stamina, just my clarity.
[00:57:54.185 --> 00:57:56.486]  Personally, it's been a life game changer.
[00:57:59.462 --> 00:58:05.605]  And of course I've got a couple drops of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com in this water.
[00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:14.791]  And I forgot to add my Fluoride Shield, which blocks the fluoride and a bunch of other heavy metals and things, really a chelator.
[00:58:14.811 --> 00:58:18.053]  And then a squirt, maybe two squirts.
[00:58:18.733 --> 00:58:22.095]  It is the weekend coming up of super male vitality.
[00:58:24.616 --> 00:58:26.537]  I feel like I'm 18, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:27.057 --> 00:58:28.157]  And I like it!
[00:58:28.317 --> 00:58:29.117]  Love it!
[00:58:30.038 --> 00:58:32.018]  I got a old man's heart.
[00:58:32.658 --> 00:58:34.299]  I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart.
[00:58:34.499 --> 00:58:36.079]  I think Alice Cooper's right.
[00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:38.640]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.901]  And here's the Liberty and down with the tyrants.
[00:58:41.181 --> 00:58:44.882]  And I hope Kim Jong Un is being eaten by maggots right now.
[00:58:45.162 --> 00:58:46.902]  And his soul is burning in hell.
[00:58:47.243 --> 00:58:48.223]  Second hour coming up.

[00:59:33.678 --> 00:59:37.640]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.420]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:47.323]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:59:57.247 --> 00:59:58.187]  Just won't quit.
[01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.915]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:08.162]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.038 --> 01:00:16.678]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:18.359]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.201]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.861 --> 01:00:21.681]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.442 --> 01:00:23.342]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.003 --> 01:00:27.605]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.185 --> 01:00:32.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.409 --> 01:00:39.272]  We are getting tips, naming names, you name it, from places like Canada.
[01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:43.935]  I'm going to withhold names until we've interviewed the people to protect their identity.
[01:00:47.074 --> 01:00:49.616]  Hi, my name is... We're not going to say the name.
[01:00:50.036 --> 01:00:53.478]  My wife works in a law firm in New Westminster, BC.
[01:00:55.199 --> 01:01:02.063]  Her employers, husband and wife, just returned from a trip to Africa, and now his wife is sick with vomiting and diarrhea.
[01:01:03.784 --> 01:01:06.866]  She went to the hospital and was tested for Ebola, but was sent home.
[01:01:07.487 --> 01:01:10.709]  The doctors were wearing protective gear and mask.
[01:01:11.429 --> 01:01:14.051]  I stressed to my wife that she shouldn't go to work until
[01:01:15.762 --> 01:01:17.103]  They're sure she does not have Ebola.
[01:01:17.483 --> 01:01:22.906]  But my wife was stressing that Ebola is not airborne, and she just won't have physical contact.
[01:01:23.226 --> 01:01:23.686]  Oh man.
[01:01:25.007 --> 01:01:27.288]  There was a chance somebody's got Ebola from West Africa.
[01:01:27.928 --> 01:01:33.711]  You can, they can touch a counter, you touch it, they can sneeze, it's in the droplet, you get it, it may be airborne.
[01:01:35.952 --> 01:01:39.854]  Airborne, technically folks, just means the virus or bacteria floats around in the air and can live.
[01:01:40.555 --> 01:01:43.836]  It doesn't mean the person doesn't sneeze and then it floats into your room and you get it.
[01:01:43.856 --> 01:01:44.557]  Do you understand that?
[01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:58.813]  I told my wife in August the Canadian Health Services had started on a website that it was a highly probable that Ebola could be airborne and they took the information down as an outspread fear but the possibility is still high.
[01:01:59.213 --> 01:02:00.615]  Just thought you might like to know this.
[01:02:00.735 --> 01:02:04.559]  InfoWars is the only alternative to true media that I trust and speak the truth.
[01:02:04.579 --> 01:02:05.440]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:10.935]  We'd like to confirm more of this with you and the other people that are telling us similar things.
[01:02:10.975 --> 01:02:26.827]  We have confirmed the Border Patrol agent's names and Dr. Group is coming in and it dovetails with the other information that we've gotten from the head of the Border Patrol Union, the retired Border Patrol Union.
[01:02:27.967 --> 01:02:29.709]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:02:29.749 --> 01:02:31.110]  That story by Paul Watson
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.092]  Should be going up at any time.
[01:02:34.732 --> 01:02:36.393]  It is now on screen, it just went live.
[01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:38.895]  Former Border Patrol agent, print that for me guys, thank you.
[01:02:39.236 --> 01:02:44.540]  Former Border Patrol agent, CDC, disappearing potential Ebola victims.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.983]  Illegal aliens with illnesses being secretly quarantined.
[01:02:48.623 --> 01:03:00.393]  And again, Watson did that off this interview he had said two months ago, but we, and it's in the article, we may need it as a sub-headline, that InfoWars, does group reports for us,
[01:03:02.176 --> 01:03:08.440]  InfoWars reporter has met in the last two days with other Border Patrol that have confirmed this is currently happening.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:12.102]  That's the key to this.
[01:03:14.284 --> 01:03:15.584]  That's the key to all this.
[01:03:15.644 --> 01:03:19.967]  So Dr. Group is going to be joining us in studio.
[01:03:20.007 --> 01:03:27.312]  He flew in last night from Vegas at one of the biggest medical slash nutra-medical shows in the country.
[01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:31.952]  Where he had dinner with and met with quite a few Border Patrol ISHU, name it, senior people.
[01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:55.701]  And they mentioned, the gentleman that's in the video, the head of the Border Patrol Retiree Union, who's been a guest on the show, by the way, former Border Patrol agent, Zach Taylor, has divulged that the CDC is working with Border Patrol authorities at the Department of Homeland Security to disappear potential Ebola victims attempting to cross the border of the United States.
[01:03:58.757 --> 01:03:59.817]  That's a good job, Watson.
[01:03:59.858 --> 01:04:02.379]  I just think Watson should put a paragraph... I know he's here.
[01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:03.739]  It's great having Watson and Nossin with us.
[01:04:03.759 --> 01:04:04.740]  He's here for another week.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:18.025]  Just to say up front that our reporter, Dr. Edward Group, met in Vegas at a trade show with Senior Border Patrol that confirmed this is happening now.
[01:04:19.006 --> 01:04:20.026]  That they've seen this.
[01:04:20.246 --> 01:04:21.667]  This is now going on with people.
[01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:30.873]  Not just they were grabbing people that might be sick of disappearing them, which is a whole scandal on its own, but that they're in hazmat suits and vans.
[01:04:30.953 --> 01:04:31.714]  That's key!
[01:04:33.354 --> 01:04:36.036]  And then Watson's got another bombshell coming out.
[01:04:38.217 --> 01:04:39.318]  And that should be by the end of the hour.
[01:04:39.358 --> 01:04:40.839]  Watson's a very prolific quick writer.
[01:04:40.859 --> 01:04:41.359]  Great job.
[01:04:42.039 --> 01:04:43.920]  It's just that it's not just Zack Taylor saying this.
[01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:47.422]  We talked to others that confirmed it's currently going on.
[01:04:48.223 --> 01:04:53.406]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, RedLinked, right now New York City on alert.
[01:04:56.351 --> 01:05:01.934]  There's unease on the big Red River shootout between UT and Oklahoma this weekend.
[01:05:02.234 --> 01:05:02.875]  People are scared.
[01:05:03.635 --> 01:05:08.838]  Yeah, I mean, I think any big, huge public event, you're just asking for it.
[01:05:09.969 --> 01:05:13.171]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:21.496]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:21.716 --> 01:05:26.740]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:06:27.424 --> 01:06:31.706]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:06:32.026 --> 01:06:42.189]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:48.810]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.391]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:55.352]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.

[01:07:09.499 --> 01:07:17.983]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:24.366]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:07:25.326 --> 01:07:28.447]  Our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:30.068]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:18.776]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.396 --> 01:08:22.359]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:36.972 --> 01:08:43.974]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones, red-linked on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:44.094 --> 01:09:02.881]  Right now is this headline, former Border Patrol agent, former deputy head of it, former head of the union, now head of the retiree union, Zach Taylor, CDC disappearing potential Ebola victims, illegal aliens with illnesses being secretly quarantined.
[01:09:03.775 --> 01:09:06.557]  And we're having this added to the article, because he just got it out quickly.
[01:09:07.338 --> 01:09:24.591]  We have video of Taylor talking about it, but the issue here is his name was brought up by the Border Patrol agents, some of them senior that Dr. Group met with this weekend in Vegas, who were at the big medical, NutraMedical, biggest, you know, supply-side event in the country by the actual, you know, developers.
[01:09:25.932 --> 01:09:28.815]  Pharmacists, scientists, you name it.
[01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:33.836]  They were there trying to find out how to protect themselves and their agents and their families.
[01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:35.939]  They were sent there by the Border Patrol.
[01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.102]  And they said, well, Zack Taylor warned of it months ago.
[01:09:38.142 --> 01:09:39.203]  And I said, Zack Taylor, he's been on.
[01:09:39.223 --> 01:09:39.964]  He's the union guy.
[01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:48.929]  And then it turns out over a month ago he did this video that got no attention that's up on Infowars.com saying he believed Ebola could come across, was coming across.
[01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:53.513]  Now the head of Southcom says it could be and they believe it will if it gets into South America.
[01:09:54.093 --> 01:09:59.518]  They're now in the news, Mainline News today, saying they're picking up people that are sick out of West Africa.
[01:09:59.838 --> 01:10:00.919]  That's in my Ebola stack.
[01:10:00.939 --> 01:10:04.462]  I'm going to go to that in a few minutes and I'll show that to TV viewers on the document cam.
[01:10:04.882 --> 01:10:07.264]  Radio listeners can go to Infowars.com.
[01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:08.205]  We have that article posted.
[01:10:08.285 --> 01:10:08.725]  I think it's AP?
[01:10:08.745 --> 01:10:09.366]  Yeah, it's AP.
[01:10:10.868 --> 01:10:14.471]  So all of that is unfolding and happening right now.
[01:10:16.153 --> 01:10:34.370]  And Dr. Group there, developing products for us, was able to talk to a lot of these senior people and medical doctors and others about what they're seeing and what's unfolding as Oklahoma City Hospital isolates a patient exhibiting possible Ebola symptoms, as Ebola pops up in Spain and other areas, from them bringing in these Ebola patients, never before done.
[01:10:36.664 --> 01:10:52.117]  Former Border Patrol agent Zach Taylor has divulged that the CDC is working with Border Patrol authorities and the Department of Homeland Security to literally disappear potential Ebola victims attempting to cross the border in the United States and there's no news coverage, no paperwork signed, they're put in vans and disappeared.
[01:10:52.517 --> 01:10:56.961]  Now we confirm that there's huge forces of vans and guys in literal
[01:10:58.789 --> 01:10:59.029]  I don't
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:19.462]  But this is currently going on, so we need to get back with those sources where they suggest we go.
[01:11:19.522 --> 01:11:20.102]  McAllen?
[01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:21.242]  Brownsville?
[01:11:22.222 --> 01:11:22.722]  In Texas?
[01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:24.163]  Or do we go to the Arizona border?
[01:11:24.403 --> 01:11:25.683]  Do we go to the California border?
[01:11:26.003 --> 01:11:27.164]  We need to show this.
[01:11:27.804 --> 01:11:33.145]  Because if they are doing their job, that's a good thing, but why would they be covering it up so there's not a panic?
[01:11:34.426 --> 01:11:38.507]  Undoubtedly, you've got major African countries basically on the verge of collapse or collapsing.
[01:11:38.547 --> 01:11:39.167]  That's in the news.
[01:11:39.407 --> 01:11:39.927]  That term.
[01:11:40.307 --> 01:11:42.468]  African countries on the verge of collapse or are collapsing.
[01:11:43.718 --> 01:11:46.782]  They're saying stay in your houses in Liberia, no public gatherings.
[01:11:46.842 --> 01:11:48.404]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:11:48.744 --> 01:11:51.847]  UN models, 1.4 to 5 million to get it by December.
[01:11:51.968 --> 01:11:53.009]  I don't know if that's accurate.
[01:11:53.609 --> 01:12:00.677]  But Dr. Group joins us to talk about this in the interview, the 27-year Border Patrol veteran, Taylor.
[01:12:02.353 --> 01:12:13.922]  Uh, was first contacted nearly three months ago in July, but InfoWars separately confirmed through other sources that the process was ongoing in the aftermath of America's first case of Ebola, which occurred in Dallas last week.
[01:12:14.322 --> 01:12:16.884]  They are literally grabbing people and disappearing them into vans.
[01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:19.346]  This is so big on so many fronts.
[01:12:19.706 --> 01:12:27.292]  Why would they be doing their job and doing this, keeping it quiet, Dr. Grubb, but then at the same time, and I want to hear it from your own words, you know, debrief you here on air.
[01:12:27.492 --> 01:12:28.433]  We'll have you in the next hour.
[01:12:29.873 --> 01:12:36.455]  Why would they be doing that, A, but B, then leaving the planes open to fly folks in, and now they admit they're not doing even the heat screening.
[01:12:36.675 --> 01:12:38.176]  They're asking, do you feel okay?
[01:12:38.356 --> 01:12:45.698]  Well, someone fleeing Ebola, or who has it, who wants treatment for them and their kids, they're not going to say, hey, I got Ebola, or hey, I think I got Ebola.
[01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:46.759]  They just want to live.
[01:12:47.539 --> 01:12:49.359]  I mean, all the other countries have sealed their borders.
[01:12:49.379 --> 01:12:50.520]  The other African countries have.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.220]  So what do you think is going on here?
[01:12:52.521 --> 01:12:55.722]  Tell us what happened when you were in Vegas at this big trade show.
[01:12:58.072 --> 01:13:10.801]  There's a lot of stuff going on that I didn't really know about and that's one of the reasons why that I went to Vegas because these, the scientists that were coming together there were all focusing on what can we do about this Ebola situation.
[01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:11.841]  At least a lot of them were.
[01:13:12.302 --> 01:13:20.167]  And some of these guys I haven't met with for years and years and years but it was more of like a meeting of the minds and coming together to see what's really going on.
[01:13:20.707 --> 01:13:21.648]  And I was pretty shocked.
[01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:27.952]  I have like four pages of notes that I wrote down because the stuff that I found out is not being talked about
[01:13:28.092 --> 01:13:29.053]  In mainstream media.
[01:13:29.254 --> 01:13:29.975]  You have the floor.
[01:13:30.215 --> 01:13:35.502]  Go through what the Border Patrol told you first, what these senior agents told you, and then get into the whole list.
[01:13:36.604 --> 01:13:50.327]  Well, I was shown a video of the guy that was talking about what's going on down at the border, and these guys know and have connections down there, and what they're saying is that people are being... that anybody with Ebola-like symptoms... They were confirming, Taylor.
[01:13:50.447 --> 01:13:58.009]  They were confirming that never before has the CDC and the National Institute of Health worked so closely with Border Patrol.
[01:13:58.829 --> 01:14:05.774]  And that they were down there grabbing individuals and putting them in vans and taking them to a quarantine location.
[01:14:06.114 --> 01:14:10.417]  And at that location, basically nobody knows where they were taking them to.
[01:14:10.857 --> 01:14:12.278]  Nobody knows what they're doing with them.
[01:14:12.318 --> 01:14:15.620]  I mean, are they trying experimental vaccines on them?
[01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:17.902]  I don't know.
[01:14:36.004 --> 01:15:00.424]  You know, I just flew in last night and just this morning typed up all these notes so it would be fresh on your show today to share this information with all your listeners because it's important to know what's going on so you can come to a conclusion on what you need to do and, you know, what's really happening because obviously when the mainstream media is out there saying one thing, it's something else that's going on at the same time.
[01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:08.912]  Other things on my list that I found was that the CDC was getting calls from doctors all across the nation.
[01:15:08.932 --> 01:15:27.556]  I had talked to a guy that was, you know, heading up some underground stuff for Ebola and he said that doctors are seeing patients with Ebola-like symptoms and calling the CDC and about half of those calls are going unanswered or the CDC's not following up on those calls.
[01:15:29.777 --> 01:15:40.183]  You know, different changes that are happening with the CDC and the WHO changing up their website, basically saying that now, you know, it possibly could be airborne, which we talked about before.
[01:15:40.543 --> 01:15:41.384]  But just think about it.
[01:15:41.424 --> 01:15:45.026]  I mean, if you cough, if you sneeze, those are droplets of bodily fluids.
[01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:53.391]  I talked to one guy that was telling me that the CDC is now warning airline crews to start using masks.
[01:15:53.451 --> 01:15:54.131]  You know, why?
[01:15:54.331 --> 01:15:54.912]  Why would they be?
[01:15:56.164 --> 01:15:58.527]  Warning people to use masks if it's not airborne.
[01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:04.696]  Another thing that's happening is the government is cracking down on natural health care companies right now too.
[01:16:04.716 --> 01:16:08.482]  I mean, there's a big attack on anybody advertising anything about Ebola.
[01:16:08.922 --> 01:16:10.685]  There's an attack on colloidal silver.
[01:16:12.387 --> 01:16:19.932]  You know, anything, they're scouring the websites out there to see who's advertising anything natural against Ebola.
[01:16:20.272 --> 01:16:26.416]  But the thing is, I mean, the easy solution is just keep your immune system strong and you should be able to fight it off.
[01:16:29.028 --> 01:16:43.300]  You know, usually with Ebola in the past, you have, this was another guy that was talking about how the transmission, you know, the indigenous tribes that are in the jungle usually get Ebola from eating monkey meat or something like that and then they pass it to the city.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.224]  But the strange thing about this is, three cities at about the same time
[01:16:49.325 --> 01:16:51.787]  Uh, the Ebola was released in the city.
[01:16:51.847 --> 01:16:56.289]  So it's actually the mechanism of action of spread has been reversed.
[01:16:56.329 --> 01:17:00.131]  Instead of jungle to city, it's now city to city to city.
[01:17:00.191 --> 01:17:09.416]  So that was an interesting point because that would make you want to look at how all of a sudden did Ebola get released inside three cities at the same time.
[01:17:10.777 --> 01:17:12.538]  So that was that was interesting.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:29.490]  Another thing that they were talking about, somebody had some friends at Emory University and they said that it took 40 bags of medical waste a day from the three infected Ebola patients that were at Emory University.
[01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:40.857]  So, you can imagine if three patients create 40 bags of medical waste a day, what would happen with a thousand patients or what would happen with, you know, 5,000 patients?
[01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:44.800]  I mean, there's no possible way to control that much waste.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.122]  And the fact that there are only four hospitals in the U.S.
[01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:53.144]  that are technically qualified to handle pandemic outbreaks.
[01:17:53.184 --> 01:17:54.044]  And let's just go back.
[01:17:54.204 --> 01:17:56.866]  It used to incubate over three days, now it's 21.
[01:17:56.906 --> 01:17:59.667]  The virus has just mutated off the chart.
[01:18:00.107 --> 01:18:01.728]  This is very suspicious.
[01:18:02.276 --> 01:18:07.258]  Yes, you know, the Ebola virus is kind of like the influenza virus because it will mutate.
[01:18:07.698 --> 01:18:14.581]  And that's a reason why, you know, I don't know how you're going to possibly come up with a vaccine with a virus that mutates like the influenza.
[01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:16.862]  But, you know.
[01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:25.362]  What's happening also is that if you look at what's happening in, well, the whole quarantine thing has just been completely taken out of control.
[01:18:25.402 --> 01:18:27.302]  We should have shut our borders to any type of flights.
[01:18:27.923 --> 01:18:34.886]  But another topic that we talked about was the fact what's going on with the military over there.
[01:18:35.246 --> 01:18:38.088]  Why are we sending military when we should be sending doctors?
[01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:38.988]  It's a pandemic.
[01:18:39.068 --> 01:18:40.609]  They need doctors, not military.
[01:18:41.409 --> 01:18:49.781]  What was reported back to me was it was kind of a drill to see how to quarantine for medical martial law in the United States.
[01:18:49.801 --> 01:18:56.289]  They're literally going door-to-door, the military, pulling people out that have Ebola-like symptoms.
[01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:58.512]  And our military is definitely going to get it.
[01:18:59.053 --> 01:19:01.476]  And then that'll be covered up, they'll use them for guinea pigs as well.
[01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:07.161]  And they're taking them to quarantine areas, and now the families know this too, so they're trying to hide people.
[01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:12.967]  So what this is, is a plan to see how they're going to react into the United States.
[01:19:13.067 --> 01:19:18.733]  It's to create a cadre brigade, that's why it's 5,000, to come back and train the rest of the brigades.
[01:19:19.013 --> 01:19:22.635]  Yes, and now what happens when you take everybody and put them in quarantine?
[01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:28.539]  Well, this is how the economy collapses real fast because how does the food get from the farm?
[01:19:28.579 --> 01:19:32.142]  Nobody wants to go to work if there's a quarantine and they can't leave their own homes.
[01:19:32.582 --> 01:19:36.325]  So you have distribution that completely comes to a halt.
[01:19:36.645 --> 01:19:38.586]  You have food production that comes to a halt.
[01:19:38.626 --> 01:19:41.008]  The food can't get to the grocery stores.
[01:19:41.228 --> 01:19:45.251]  Every single worker, all the waste workers, the government workers don't go to work.
[01:19:45.311 --> 01:19:48.773]  And when you take everybody away from going to work,
[01:19:48.973 --> 01:19:49.954]  We're going to break.
[01:19:50.134 --> 01:19:51.976]  The economy starts to crash.
[01:19:52.256 --> 01:19:55.640]  It means societal collapse level event.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:20:01.986]  Dr. Ebergrubs, our guest, Infowars.com has the breaking news and the article is being expanded as we speak.
[01:20:02.447 --> 01:20:07.612]  Former Border Patrol agent, senior agent, CDC disappearing potential Ebola victims.
[01:20:08.113 --> 01:20:09.194]  It's currently going on.
[01:20:10.237 --> 01:20:12.819]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[01:22:08.877 --> 01:22:11.459]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:16.582]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:16.842 --> 01:22:24.727]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:24.968 --> 01:22:29.270]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:33.293]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:33.453 --> 01:22:39.157]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:39.397 --> 01:22:42.159]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:42.559 --> 01:22:47.783]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:22:56.068 --> 01:22:56.288]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:23:03.573 --> 01:23:12.802]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:23.732]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[01:23:25.453 --> 01:23:39.759]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell our 30-day non-GMO emergency food supply for only $99 as long as we can.

[01:24:10.407 --> 01:24:12.588]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:24:13.169 --> 01:24:16.051]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:20.954 --> 01:24:22.855]  We have breaking news in the next hour.
[01:24:23.656 --> 01:24:29.139]  Turns out those FEMA coffins... CDC does want them.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.982]  Put as many as four dead people apiece into them.
[01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.652]  That article's breaking at InfoWars.com the next hour.
[01:24:37.152 --> 01:24:38.613]  Dr. Ed Group is our guest.
[01:24:38.633 --> 01:24:40.675]  We'll open the phones up in the next hour with Dr. Group.
[01:24:40.915 --> 01:24:46.079]  I'll just keep you the whole two hours that we've got left, or an hour and 30 minutes, 35 minutes now, if you can do it.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.983]  Doc, continue getting into, you're at this big medical conference, doctors, scientists,
[01:24:52.481 --> 01:25:01.808]  Epidemiologists, virologists, border patrol, pharmacists, developers, chemists, you're there talking to them and everything you're saying has already been separately confirmed.
[01:25:02.368 --> 01:25:05.211]  You were talking about how in Africa they call these community care centers.
[01:25:06.383 --> 01:25:08.644]  But really, they're just death camps.
[01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.405]  Well, that's even been in the back of the news.
[01:25:10.985 --> 01:25:14.027]  That they just take them and lock them up behind barbed wire and shoot them if they try to get out.
[01:25:14.387 --> 01:25:16.248]  But notice how they call them a community care center.
[01:25:16.788 --> 01:25:21.731]  And then now, this model being used on the illegals to just disappear them and not talk about it?
[01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:23.312]  That could be anybody next.
[01:25:23.372 --> 01:25:26.974]  And once they set that precedent of just go arrest this person, put them in a truck,
[01:25:28.007 --> 01:25:29.088]  It's compartmentalized.
[01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:32.432]  That can be the smokescreen for a political purge as well.
[01:25:32.712 --> 01:25:39.359]  We've always said a big bioscare or a bioweapon attack or a natural pandemic could be the cover for the takeover.
[01:25:39.799 --> 01:25:40.520]  One of the big ones.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.882]  And now, right on time, here it is.
[01:25:43.323 --> 01:25:44.324]  Dr. Grubb, continue.
[01:25:44.969 --> 01:25:47.110]  Well, you know, that's from what we're hearing.
[01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:49.411]  They're really just nothing more than death camps over there.
[01:25:49.471 --> 01:25:51.752]  But, you know, it's the media takes the there.
[01:25:52.132 --> 01:25:55.413]  Obviously, the media is not going to come out and say death camps over in Africa.
[01:25:55.453 --> 01:25:58.915]  So they're going to they're going to call it community care centers.
[01:25:59.095 --> 01:26:07.398]  And so, you know, it's the spin that you're getting over here that, you know, we're actually there trying to help and trying to contain the
[01:26:07.438 --> 01:26:12.562]  And by the way, you do have to lock them up, and things are breaking down, and sorry if there's not enough food or water.
[01:26:13.022 --> 01:26:14.643]  But be honest about the tragedy.
[01:26:14.683 --> 01:26:15.804]  Do airlifts of food.
[01:26:16.084 --> 01:26:17.585]  Don't just warehouse them and kill them.
[01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.386]  Where's Jesse Jackson when you need him?
[01:26:20.047 --> 01:26:20.827]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:21.328 --> 01:26:22.348]  Let me see some of the others.
[01:26:22.368 --> 01:26:24.410]  Because if it does collapse, then they're going to spill out.
[01:26:25.925 --> 01:26:28.428]  One of the other... What did the head of South Com say three days ago?
[01:26:28.448 --> 01:26:29.389]  We're going to play the video coming up.
[01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:33.214]  They said if you get into South America, collapse it, it's going to collapse into us.
[01:26:33.635 --> 01:26:34.896]  So are they beefing up the border?
[01:26:35.197 --> 01:26:35.577]  What else?
[01:26:35.597 --> 01:26:37.720]  I want to go back into your list, Dr. Rubin.
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:41.865]  What else did the Border Patrol agents say when you were watching videos and talking to them?
[01:26:42.105 --> 01:26:42.926]  Were they concerned?
[01:26:42.946 --> 01:26:56.820]  You told me that they had confirmed and seen and talked to others that had seen exactly what he was saying and that they were literally pulling up in vans and suits and throwing people on the backs of vans and the Border Patrol would say, well you gotta fill out a form and they say, no we don't.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.842]  I mean break that down, what else did they say?
[01:26:59.102 --> 01:26:59.963]  That's pretty much it.
[01:27:00.003 --> 01:27:09.888]  I mean, the only other thing that they were talking about was, and I haven't confirmed this, is that Homeland Security restricted all of the ammunition to the Border Patrol until 2015.
[01:27:09.948 --> 01:27:12.070]  That was actually confirmed.
[01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:13.471]  No, no, that was mainstream news three months ago.
[01:27:13.691 --> 01:27:15.672]  Okay, so basically they were just talking about that.
[01:27:15.692 --> 01:27:16.452]  Yeah, they won't supply them.
[01:27:16.472 --> 01:27:17.493]  They have to buy it themselves.
[01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.694]  And they can't do their training or anything like that.
[01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:24.197]  Homeland Security has almost three billion rounds now, but the Border Patrol can't have any.
[01:27:24.662 --> 01:27:24.902]  Right.
[01:27:24.942 --> 01:27:27.024]  Guys, type in Border Patrol ammo shortage.
[01:27:27.084 --> 01:27:28.344]  It was, I think, Breitbart and AP.
[01:27:28.404 --> 01:27:28.785]  Go ahead.
[01:27:28.825 --> 01:27:42.694]  Yeah, basically what they were saying is it's just strange that the CDC and the National Institute of Health has never worked with the Border Patrol before and then all of a sudden now they're down there and they're just taking, you know, anybody with symptoms.
[01:27:42.934 --> 01:27:44.235]  The border's just wide open.
[01:27:44.255 --> 01:27:44.795]  We know that.
[01:27:45.295 --> 01:27:48.297]  But they're trying to pinpoint people and they're just taking them somewhere.
[01:27:48.517 --> 01:27:50.219]  I mean, I don't know where they're taking them.
[01:27:50.259 --> 01:27:52.400]  I guess to... Probably to deploy them to each school or
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.641]  I mean, these are guys that have been around for a while, just like me.
[01:27:54.661 --> 01:27:55.361]  I've been studying natural
[01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:25.630]  Remedies for viruses, bacterias, pandemics, all this stuff, you know, for years and years and years.
[01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:29.431]  So, you know, really to give everybody solutions.
[01:28:29.551 --> 01:28:40.793]  So what they're saying is that, you know, they're, you know, these guys, these scientists are telling me and these doctors are telling me that their friends are actually seeing patients that might have Ebola-like symptoms and calling the CDC.
[01:28:41.353 --> 01:28:44.513]  And the CDC is getting about 20 to 40 calls a day.
[01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:46.734]  Like I said, I, you know, I don't know how to confirm that.
[01:28:46.814 --> 01:28:48.574]  I'm just relaying what I heard.
[01:28:48.934 --> 01:28:53.836]  Oh, and imagine they're getting hundreds of false reports an hour with the panic going on in the country.
[01:28:53.876 --> 01:29:02.158]  But if they're bringing in Ebola patients and they've now spread it in Spain, if they're letting people fly in from West Africa, it's a guarantee there's going to be more cases.
[01:29:02.738 --> 01:29:04.339]  It's a guarantee it's going to spread.
[01:29:04.359 --> 01:29:05.399]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:29:05.919 --> 01:29:07.800]  How do you, why do you think government's doing this?
[01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:22.353]  Well, looking and analyzing what happened with the swine flu and some of the other H1N1 stuff like that, I think this is a test, and it might be the big one.
[01:29:22.393 --> 01:29:27.374]  I mean, it might be that this is the one that they're really, they've set up all those government camps for.
[01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:35.277]  If you look at every single piece of the puzzle, you know, what's going on at the border, all the camps that have been set up, the fact that- Stay there, let's come back to that when we get back.
[01:29:35.317 --> 01:29:39.258]  Yeah, my gut has just been off the chart concerned the last year, as everybody knows.
[01:29:40.598 --> 01:29:41.859]  Notice they're dropping the border.
[01:29:41.879 --> 01:29:43.020]  They're starting war with Russia.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.261]  They're turning loose Al-Qaeda.
[01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:45.942]  They're devaluing the dollar.
[01:29:45.982 --> 01:29:47.403]  They're shutting off the power plants.
[01:29:47.743 --> 01:29:49.485]  They're announcing our kids belong to them.
[01:29:49.825 --> 01:29:51.246]  They don't seem to care what we say or do.
[01:29:51.286 --> 01:29:52.847]  They don't care how unpopular they are.
[01:29:53.127 --> 01:29:53.868]  They laugh at us.
[01:29:54.829 --> 01:29:56.430]  Are they getting ready to release an airborne string?
[01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:58.051]  I mean, there's no telling what they'll do.
[01:29:58.391 --> 01:29:59.432]  They're open exterminists.
[01:29:59.452 --> 01:30:00.773]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.793 --> 01:30:01.894]  The empires on the run.
[01:30:01.914 --> 01:30:03.495]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:03.535 --> 01:30:05.937]  Alex Jones and the CCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.635 --> 01:30:11.855]  Another major health threat.
[01:30:11.895 --> 01:30:16.797]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:30:16.877 --> 01:30:19.498]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:30:19.538 --> 01:30:26.320]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.441]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:30:29.561 --> 01:30:32.522]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:30:32.602 --> 01:30:34.522]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:30:34.542 --> 01:30:37.383]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:30:37.483 --> 01:30:42.965]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:30:43.185 --> 01:30:46.687]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:49.688]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:30:49.788 --> 01:30:56.891]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:17.302]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:17.422 --> 01:31:19.584]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:19.784 --> 01:31:24.887]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:25.048 --> 01:31:30.011]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:30.211 --> 01:31:33.272]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:33.532 --> 01:31:37.394]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:37.614 --> 01:31:41.856]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:41.936 --> 01:31:51.940]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.681]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:54.881 --> 01:32:02.928]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:32:03.068 --> 01:32:07.032]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:10.225 --> 01:32:16.350]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:19.672]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:19.692 --> 01:32:21.394]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:32:21.454 --> 01:32:27.718]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:27.818 --> 01:32:31.902]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security?
[01:32:32.082 --> 01:32:33.703]  Us sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:32:33.863 --> 01:32:37.605]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:37.805 --> 01:32:40.707]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:40.727 --> 01:32:48.892]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:49.172 --> 01:32:51.213]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:51.273 --> 01:32:52.294]  It's a war against the truth.

[01:33:22.659 --> 01:33:23.400]  Big Brother.
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.041]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:25.581 --> 01:33:26.682]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:27.522 --> 01:33:28.903]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:29.184 --> 01:33:30.324]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:30.845 --> 01:33:35.388]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.782]  You know, speaking of girls, I love my daughters, two of them, so much.
[01:33:51.822 --> 01:33:55.024]  I love my son, love my whole family, and I love you.
[01:33:55.044 --> 01:33:56.745]  That's what empathy is.
[01:33:56.865 --> 01:34:00.848]  You love yourself, you care about somebody else, and you see them get hit by a car, you want to help them.
[01:34:01.628 --> 01:34:05.190]  They call that being a chump nowadays in New York and in L.A.
[01:34:06.031 --> 01:34:08.692]  Well, you call me a chump, I'm not gonna die alone, I know that.
[01:34:10.113 --> 01:34:13.355]  I'll never be with those cold souls that don't care about others.
[01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:23.875]  We have an elite that's been caught doing multi-thousands of secret studies that have been declassified, hundreds of them that were lethal.
[01:34:24.496 --> 01:34:38.286]  Nerve-gassing little kids, troops, giving uranium, plutonium pills to pregnant wives of GIs, black people injecting them with syphilis, and then it turned out injecting people in the Appalachias with it, white people too, and people in Colombia.
[01:34:38.866 --> 01:34:40.928]  The globalists are just horrible monsters.
[01:34:42.455 --> 01:34:51.798]  That's why 36,000 top Nazis got brought over here at the end of World War II, because they were following eugenics that our own government was following in the scientific arena.
[01:34:53.018 --> 01:35:07.263]  Eugenics pretty much changed the course of history in 1851 when Galton invented it, the cousin of much of the top scientists at the time, but Darwin and others, and they developed social Darwinism, and that's what we live under.
[01:35:08.755 --> 01:35:10.856]  And so just be aware of it, even if you agree with it.
[01:35:11.576 --> 01:35:13.717]  A lot of elitists and wannabe elitists agree with it.
[01:35:14.377 --> 01:35:18.179]  Just know that it's happening and it's going on and sign on to it officially.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.061]  Because the reason we don't trust the system is they've proven they're bad actors.
[01:35:23.882 --> 01:35:28.123]  We're not talking about a cop or the border patrol or a doctor down the road.
[01:35:28.183 --> 01:35:28.984]  Those are great people.
[01:35:29.364 --> 01:35:30.284]  Nine times out of ten.
[01:35:31.565 --> 01:35:33.946]  We're talking about the central system.
[01:35:35.226 --> 01:35:36.267]  The main planners.
[01:35:38.218 --> 01:35:41.582]  And the morbidity rate is about 91% in Africa.
[01:35:41.982 --> 01:35:43.463]  Granted, the immune systems are lowered.
[01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:46.627]  Society's collapsing, even in industrialized areas.
[01:35:47.327 --> 01:35:47.788]  Here it's over 50%.
[01:35:47.988 --> 01:35:54.174]  You know, this guy that died in Dallas a few days ago, he had Western Care.
[01:35:54.214 --> 01:35:56.497]  He reportedly had the Ebola, knew it, came over here.
[01:35:57.397 --> 01:35:57.738]  He died.
[01:35:59.318 --> 01:36:00.840]  And let me tell you, it is explosive.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.101]  That's why it spreads so fast.
[01:36:02.502 --> 01:36:03.984]  It's not airborne, supposedly, yet.
[01:36:04.905 --> 01:36:07.768]  That just means the virus doesn't live and go through the air a long time.
[01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:13.055]  But it will live in a sneeze droplet, a mucus droplet, or a cough droplet.
[01:36:13.555 --> 01:36:16.179]  It will live if spit or saliva on the table.
[01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:20.021]  It will live in feces or other things for days.
[01:36:20.362 --> 01:36:21.443]  Or vomit for days.
[01:36:21.903 --> 01:36:24.066]  It can just live inside that little capsule.
[01:36:24.506 --> 01:36:25.727]  Live inside that goo.
[01:36:26.708 --> 01:36:28.390]  Live so roaches walk through it.
[01:36:28.931 --> 01:36:31.593]  Or bats urinate or defecate and you breathe it.
[01:36:31.894 --> 01:36:33.796]  That's how they think it's really starting to spread in Africa.
[01:36:33.836 --> 01:36:34.556]  They think it's the bats.
[01:36:34.917 --> 01:36:36.598]  That would be the answer if it wasn't man-made.
[01:36:36.618 --> 01:36:38.180]  That's what most of the scientists are saying.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:38.580]  Look it up.
[01:36:39.221 --> 01:36:41.002]  I'm not just saying that, it's in the Washington Post, you name it.
[01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:51.868]  But the real scientists are saying, we think it could be quasi-airborne, because it's not technically, but the bats go to the bathroom when they take a flight, in the air, and then you're breathing it.
[01:36:53.509 --> 01:36:59.012]  And if you even get a few thousand cases in the United States, it'll be total pandemonium.
[01:37:00.053 --> 01:37:06.237]  And I love my family, and I personally have been trying to get more sleep, sun, boost my immune system, eat healthier.
[01:37:08.261 --> 01:37:13.003]  There's studies out, studies shows how exercise protects the brain from depression.
[01:37:13.023 --> 01:37:14.964]  It's because there's oxygenate in the cells.
[01:37:15.004 --> 01:37:16.024]  Dr. Group talks about that.
[01:37:16.064 --> 01:37:24.467]  So I want to get more into your list of what these scientists and doctors were saying at this big internal private supply side expo in Las Vegas, what the Border Patrol told you.
[01:37:24.967 --> 01:37:26.408]  But let's talk about Dr. Group.
[01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:30.592]  Because I've been following what you say for over a year now with incredible effect.
[01:37:30.652 --> 01:37:38.339]  I mean, people that see me in person, TV puts 10 pounds on you, but I'm still 20, 30 pounds overweight, but I was 80 pounds, 90 pounds overweight.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.722]  I mean, I almost have no potbelly anymore.
[01:37:41.202 --> 01:37:50.272]  Just with a survival shield, nascent iodine X2, exercise, more purified water, the DNA force, the super metal vitality that's got all these compounds.
[01:37:50.952 --> 01:37:53.953]  I mean, what it's done for me and my virility is amazing.
[01:37:54.393 --> 01:37:58.034]  But what are you doing specifically for your immune system?
[01:37:58.915 --> 01:38:01.715]  What were the other scientists and experts you were talking to?
[01:38:02.536 --> 01:38:06.457]  What's the cutting edge right now for folks out there that are researching this?
[01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.857]  Well, pretty much everybody's in agreement.
[01:38:09.897 --> 01:38:12.779]  You know, planning is what needs to be done.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.163]  Everybody, families, just have a plan.
[01:38:16.183 --> 01:38:18.345]  You were telling me you're getting more storable food during the break.
[01:38:18.385 --> 01:38:22.328]  Yeah, storable food, clean water, things to purify your water.
[01:38:22.389 --> 01:38:27.593]  What the NIH, the WHO, what the medical and government is not telling people to do
[01:38:28.654 --> 01:38:30.575]  Is looking at natural alternatives.
[01:38:30.595 --> 01:38:33.617]  You know, they're not telling you to use iodine to purify your water.
[01:38:33.637 --> 01:38:36.719]  They're not telling you to use silver to boost your immune system.
[01:38:36.779 --> 01:38:43.863]  I mean, they're not telling you to look for natural ways out there because what they want to be able to vaccinate you.
[01:38:43.923 --> 01:38:54.509]  My big question is and one of the questions we were talking about is what could it because with this day you want to see you're going to probably see with the executive order a mandated vaccine.
[01:38:55.842 --> 01:38:59.305]  So, the question is, you know, most people out there just, they just can't wait.
[01:38:59.345 --> 01:39:03.227]  You know, they're already fast-tracking vaccines that are supposed to be ready this week.
[01:39:03.247 --> 01:39:06.390]  They're starting human trials on 20 different humans.
[01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:09.792]  And my question... Fellow Melinda Gates are involved.
[01:39:10.072 --> 01:39:11.013]  Monsanto.
[01:39:11.033 --> 01:39:12.694]  I mean, hello!
[01:39:12.714 --> 01:39:12.814]  Sorry.
[01:39:13.815 --> 01:39:28.905]  Yes, and another subject I want to get into is the rabies Ebola vaccine, and that's currently in the works by the NIH and Thomas Jefferson University with GlaxoSmithKline, and that's scheduled to be finished with fast-tracking by the end of 2014.
[01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:35.730]  And you remember what happened with the fast-tracking of the swine flu vaccine, which was given to like 30 million people.
[01:39:43.715 --> 01:39:51.604]  Right, and now you have a lot of the children have developed narcolepsy and there's all kinds of brain deformations because of that vaccine.
[01:39:51.684 --> 01:39:52.125]  On record!
[01:39:52.705 --> 01:39:58.031]  And GSK, yeah, they were sued $3 billion for that and lost the lawsuit.
[01:39:58.852 --> 01:40:08.163]  But what everybody's talking about internally is, you know, why this is going to take place and really what to do in case it spreads in the United States.
[01:40:08.183 --> 01:40:13.008]  And that's have a plan to get out of a well-populated area, you know, have some land somewhere.
[01:40:13.789 --> 01:40:19.515]  You know, they were worried that possibly the borders would be closed, which I don't know if that's really going to happen if they wanted to spread.
[01:40:20.196 --> 01:40:33.009]  But have a good supply of clean water, clean food, and your immune system have enough stocked for your family of some of the natural things that are available that work for different types of organisms.
[01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:34.771]  What are you doing specifically for yourself?
[01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:41.793]  What I'm doing is I have a place to go that's, you know, kind of close to a national forest where I could just get out of there.
[01:40:41.853 --> 01:40:43.194]  I have clean water over there.
[01:40:43.214 --> 01:40:44.095]  I have clean food.
[01:40:44.115 --> 01:40:46.196]  I have clean seeds to grow my own stuff.
[01:40:46.256 --> 01:40:48.998]  I mean, I have masks that I can use.
[01:40:49.518 --> 01:40:54.061]  I'm not really worried about it because I know how to strengthen my immune system, but I have a good supply of iodine.
[01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.963]  I have a good supply of silver over there.
[01:40:56.623 --> 01:41:01.226]  And that's really, you know, the two things that I would focus on specifically.
[01:41:01.266 --> 01:41:03.468]  I've got a good supply of oregano oil over there.
[01:41:03.488 --> 01:41:04.688]  Oregano works really good.
[01:41:04.788 --> 01:41:05.409]  I've been taking that.
[01:41:06.249 --> 01:41:14.755]  And, you know, all the supplements that we usually talk about, you know, I've got the DNA force to protect myself, to protect against free radical damage.
[01:41:15.055 --> 01:41:20.119]  You know, when your immune system goes berserk and you have a virus, then you're also going to have...
[01:41:20.819 --> 01:41:20.899]  Yes.
[01:41:39.794 --> 01:41:45.519]  Most likely, your immune system is going to be able to attack and destroy any type of invading organism.
[01:41:45.619 --> 01:41:46.260]  OxyPowder.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.621]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:41:48.081 --> 01:41:51.064]  I've got to say, that's your most amazing product, I think, overall you've developed.
[01:41:51.324 --> 01:41:52.585]  Because you guys finally convinced me to do it.
[01:41:52.605 --> 01:41:55.708]  I didn't get the oxygen tablets released in the guts.
[01:41:56.348 --> 01:42:03.254]  Unbelievable compared to chitosan or roughage or those herbal stuff that would like burn.
[01:42:03.615 --> 01:42:04.155]  Not this.
[01:42:04.275 --> 01:42:04.816]  It's just...
[01:42:06.069 --> 01:42:08.130]  Just absolutely pleasant and flushes you out.
[01:42:08.271 --> 01:42:09.371]  I mean, dynamite.
[01:42:09.952 --> 01:42:16.216]  Yes, you know, talking about Ebola, but there's so many other things that have to be... Yeah, I'm just talking about flushing my guts out, period.
[01:42:16.236 --> 01:42:16.396]  Yeah.
[01:42:16.416 --> 01:42:16.597]  Right.
[01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:35.030]  I mean, but when you look at just the intentional destruction of the society's guts through processed microwaved foods, through aspartame, artificial sweeteners, all the chemicals, the GMOs... The BT in all these crops has its own pesticide that admittedly kills our flora.
[01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:44.875]  Right, and that's you reducing everybody's immune system right there by 75% because they know that 75% of the immune system is in the gut and they know the gut controls everything.
[01:42:44.895 --> 01:42:46.215]  That's why they never report on it.
[01:42:46.235 --> 01:42:47.196]  They take your appendix out.
[01:42:47.236 --> 01:42:48.456]  What's a good probiotic?
[01:42:49.517 --> 01:42:57.681]  A probiotic that I use is called Latero Flora and then I also recommend, I don't sell the product, but it's a product by Garden of Life.
[01:42:57.741 --> 01:43:01.643]  It's called Primal Defense Ultra and that you can get that at Whole Foods.
[01:43:02.103 --> 01:43:13.032]  You know, I've tested a lot of probiotics out there and the ones that I, I just put people on those two with the oxy powder and that pretty much takes care of the majority of gut issues they have.
[01:43:13.072 --> 01:43:16.795]  Of course I want to get them off of gluten, I want to get them off the things that destroy your gut.
[01:43:16.895 --> 01:43:23.361]  I want to be clear folks, from sunshine to clean water, we're promoting a lot of stuff that we don't even sell because this is the real deal.
[01:43:23.641 --> 01:43:29.746]  I'm here asking questions for me because I want my kids to be healthy, I want my family to be healthy.
[01:43:30.168 --> 01:43:30.448]  You're right.
[01:43:30.808 --> 01:43:32.529]  The GMO foods, get them off of that.
[01:43:32.549 --> 01:43:34.571]  Then again, reduce your stress levels.
[01:43:34.591 --> 01:43:38.193]  You know, stress is linked to a deficient immune system by 50%.
[01:43:39.133 --> 01:43:44.617]  And then, you know, have a preparation plan so you're not in a state of fear all the time.
[01:43:44.637 --> 01:43:45.117]  Well, exactly.
[01:43:45.177 --> 01:43:46.998]  I've got the farmhouse to run to.
[01:43:47.018 --> 01:43:47.799]  I've got the wall.
[01:43:48.891 --> 01:43:50.453]  And again, it's not that I was living in fear.
[01:43:50.713 --> 01:43:54.197]  If there was a 5% chance this could happen, I, you know, was somewhat ready.
[01:43:55.258 --> 01:44:09.373]  And then as it gets more and more clear that globalists are destabilizing civilization, more and more I'm going to just accelerate getting prepared, because we see government and corporations digging in, building underground bunkers in the Ozarks, you name it, like it's the end of the world.
[01:44:09.733 --> 01:44:10.414]  Joel Skousen.
[01:44:11.215 --> 01:44:14.737]  We're going to get him on this week to get his take on all this, guys, or next week, or Sunday, or Monday.
[01:44:15.878 --> 01:44:20.121]  He says he's never seen elites buying bunkers and hidden redoubts, and it's in the news.
[01:44:20.181 --> 01:44:23.002]  The rich are all, you know, running to private islands and stuff.
[01:44:23.102 --> 01:44:23.463]  Why?
[01:44:23.563 --> 01:44:24.723]  What do they know, Dr. Group?
[01:44:26.244 --> 01:44:31.368]  Well, they know... I don't think all of them know the real plan involved, but they're, you know...
[01:44:32.624 --> 01:44:35.726]  They know the world's going in an unsustainable direction.
[01:44:35.826 --> 01:44:36.927]  They definitely know that.
[01:44:36.967 --> 01:44:41.310]  And with this, it's hard to tell what's going to happen with the Ebola situation.
[01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:48.895]  But it's been verified, like you said, that the Homeland Security, the CDC, they have the coffins, they have all the underground facilities.
[01:44:49.475 --> 01:44:54.179]  You know, they know that the Ebola can mutate into a very out-of-control situation.
[01:44:54.399 --> 01:44:55.920]  And they're telling us everything's fine, though.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.661]  They're telling us everything's fine.
[01:44:57.801 --> 01:44:59.162]  That's when you know you're in deep trouble.
[01:44:59.562 --> 01:45:01.824]  But, you know, they were fear-mongering and I'd feel good.
[01:45:02.585 --> 01:45:04.130]  You're like, oh, okay, they're just fear-mongering.
[01:45:04.150 --> 01:45:05.615]  But the fact that they're like, everything's wonderful!
[01:45:06.036 --> 01:45:07.180]  Everything is awesome!
[01:45:08.999 --> 01:45:11.061]  Well yeah, like they have everything under control.
[01:45:11.101 --> 01:45:16.165]  And then you look at like the movie 28 Days Later, which was an Ebola rabies virus.
[01:45:16.646 --> 01:45:17.907]  And now they're looking at crossing it!
[01:45:18.527 --> 01:45:30.718]  And right, well there's a link between, and this was one of the things we also talked about with one of the scientists that has been doing research with Ebola and rabies.
[01:45:30.878 --> 01:45:36.202]  And basically he was saying there's a link between the Ebola and the rabies virus because when you combine the Ebola
[01:45:37.063 --> 01:45:43.569]  With the rabies, one of the rabies strains, it gives you zombie-like symptoms, and he was talking about that a lot.
[01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:45.250]  Well, that was even in Mainline Science a month ago.
[01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:49.794]  Right, right, and that's why they were doing drills, you know, in case we have a scenario like that.
[01:45:49.814 --> 01:45:54.037]  It doesn't, like, turn you into a zombie, but... But you act like a rabid dog that can give people Ebola.
[01:45:54.218 --> 01:45:54.698]  Exactly.
[01:45:54.738 --> 01:45:55.719]  Which is basically a zombie.
[01:45:56.339 --> 01:46:05.684]  And the rabies Ebola vaccine, that's the one that they're doing the trials on that they're fast-tracked for 2014 with the NIH and Thomas Jefferson University.
[01:46:05.724 --> 01:46:07.665]  They're working with GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:46:07.765 --> 01:46:08.205]  Oh my god.
[01:46:08.245 --> 01:46:13.488]  And they're scheduled to be done with trials by the end of this year with the rabies Ebola vaccine.
[01:46:13.728 --> 01:46:14.048]  Oh boy.
[01:46:14.288 --> 01:46:19.431]  Now why would you start giving people a rabies Ebola vaccine
[01:46:20.231 --> 01:46:26.095]  For a supposedly Ebola strain that's out there affecting people right now.
[01:46:27.536 --> 01:46:33.019]  Could there be a mutation when you line up millions of people and shoot them with the rabies Ebola?
[01:46:33.039 --> 01:46:38.242]  That's what the top brain surgeon medical doctor just last week, Dr. Blaylock, was saying.
[01:46:38.282 --> 01:46:43.746]  He says it's been proven that it's causing bacteria and viruses to mutate, that the vaccines are doing that.
[01:46:44.386 --> 01:46:45.546]  Right, right.
[01:46:45.626 --> 01:46:46.787]  That's the scary part of it.
[01:46:46.807 --> 01:47:07.153]  If you inject millions of people with a rabies ebola knowing what happens when someone contracts rabies ebola or when you mix the strains together, that could literally create a cannibalistic, zombie-like society that's uncontrollable and that you would have to shoot each person which, you know,
[01:47:07.853 --> 01:47:09.053]  You know, then what are you going to do with it?
[01:47:09.093 --> 01:47:12.835]  Like you said, the Ebola can live in the body fluids for a long time.
[01:47:12.855 --> 01:47:14.875]  We now learn in semen for 70 days.
[01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:19.417]  And, you know, think of all the things people sneeze on, they touch, someone else walks by.
[01:47:19.457 --> 01:47:20.777]  Think about money alone.
[01:47:20.837 --> 01:47:21.997]  I mean, someone touches money.
[01:47:22.037 --> 01:47:24.098]  Think how many times that changes hands.
[01:47:24.358 --> 01:47:26.759]  They don't have sterilization procedures in place for money.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.841]  The bathrooms, the public water systems.
[01:47:29.901 --> 01:47:34.325]  I mean, yes, probably there's so many chemicals in the public water system anyway that it might kill it.
[01:47:34.405 --> 01:47:39.249]  But if it mutates into airborne situations, do you have a plan?
[01:47:39.850 --> 01:47:44.534]  See, the scary thing is I would like to quarantine my family and myself.
[01:47:44.654 --> 01:47:50.238]  But if they're coming door to door, military, and going through your house like Nazi style,
[01:47:50.999 --> 01:47:52.079]  And then that's perfect cover.
[01:47:52.119 --> 01:47:52.920]  This is just on a list.
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.660]  Go ahead and pick up Dr. Group and his family.
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:56.140]  Doesn't matter if you're not showing symptoms.
[01:47:56.501 --> 01:48:02.422]  Plus, you might not want to be around a bunch of soldiers that just rousted 500 houses that week who've probably got Ebola themselves.
[01:48:02.562 --> 01:48:03.563]  Yeah, they're just the soldiers.
[01:48:03.603 --> 01:48:04.683]  They're just going to spread it.
[01:48:04.723 --> 01:48:05.723]  Well, now you're a terrorist.
[01:48:06.243 --> 01:48:06.503]  Right.
[01:48:06.703 --> 01:48:11.845]  And then I'm going to be taken away from my family and put into a government-controlled camp somewhere?
[01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:12.605]  We know those camps.
[01:48:12.625 --> 01:48:14.686]  Well, that's why MSNBC was bitching last week.
[01:48:14.726 --> 01:48:18.147]  They said, we can't do door-to-door stuff during Ebola because of the Second Amendment.
[01:48:18.507 --> 01:48:19.287]  And that is a point.
[01:48:19.747 --> 01:48:20.310]  Well they can't.
[01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.494]  I'm not going to any FEMA camp.
[01:48:22.197 --> 01:48:24.346]  Under martial law they can do whatever they want though.
[01:48:25.436 --> 01:48:27.658]  Yeah, but the people, it's going to blow up.
[01:48:27.898 --> 01:48:29.419]  It's going to blow up.
[01:48:29.479 --> 01:48:36.184]  I mean, you know, that's why they're trying to do the gun confiscation and everything else, because they don't want the people to turn on them.
[01:48:36.204 --> 01:48:40.207]  But I think, you know, just like what's happening in Africa, like we were saying, this is a test.
[01:48:40.628 --> 01:48:43.590]  The people in Africa are turning against them and starting to fight now.
[01:48:43.630 --> 01:48:52.637]  They're trying to hide their family members and everything, because they know if you go in, as soon as they pull you out and take you to a quarantine location... They're going to get it.
[01:48:53.137 --> 01:48:53.638]  You're done.
[01:48:53.658 --> 01:48:55.539]  I mean, what are they going to give you?
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.302]  They're going to experiment with you on all kinds of vaccinations.
[01:48:58.322 --> 01:49:04.347]  They're probably going to, you know, if you do survive inside the quarantined area, then they're going to use you as an experiment.
[01:49:04.367 --> 01:49:07.330]  They're going to be taking your blood and spinning it and, you know, looking at your DNA.
[01:49:08.131 --> 01:49:08.311]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:09.312]  Crazy scientist.
[01:49:09.352 --> 01:49:10.814]  Everything you do is an experiment.
[01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:12.455]  Man, Griff, you know your stuff.
[01:49:13.036 --> 01:49:19.242]  Briefly, I want to shift gears into some of the InfoWarsHealth.com, InfoWarsLife.com products.
[01:49:19.622 --> 01:49:25.468]  InfoWarsLife.com, the DNA Force, the Super Metal Vitality, the Survival Shield, Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:49:26.189 --> 01:49:27.390]  We're sold out of the Silver Bullet.
[01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:29.392]  We've got a whole bunch of it, though, coming in about a week and a half.
[01:49:30.513 --> 01:49:36.437]  I mean, obviously, I personally am trying to cleanse my body, but it's ongoing, separate from all of this.
[01:49:36.777 --> 01:49:40.099]  Tell folks a little bit about DNA Force, why it's so special, and the X-Tube.
[01:49:40.459 --> 01:49:46.983]  Yeah, I will talk to you, but you brought up a good point, because one of the things that the scientists were talking about, and I actually talked to somebody that
[01:49:47.984 --> 01:49:52.629]  said that secretly the government is buying up to 6,000 gallons.
[01:49:52.709 --> 01:50:03.119]  They want like 6,000 gallons of silver a week for stockpiling and inside information with different agencies that are trying to stockpile a lot of silver.
[01:50:03.479 --> 01:50:05.901]  Is it true that there was an Army study about colloidal silver?
[01:50:06.141 --> 01:50:18.948]  There was a study done in 2000, I think it was 2009, by the Department of Defense on Ebola and silver, and it was declassified, and you can actually pull that article up.
[01:50:18.968 --> 01:50:20.249]  Why don't they want people talking about it?
[01:50:20.289 --> 01:50:21.110]  Just anybody.
[01:50:22.050 --> 01:50:22.591]  Exactly.
[01:50:22.871 --> 01:50:30.315]  I mean, it's just like we've had cures for cancer for 15, 20 years, but you have to go outside the country to find them.
[01:50:31.516 --> 01:50:41.001]  You know, there's so many things that can eliminate all disease from everybody's body that are not being talked about, that are not being shared.
[01:50:41.702 --> 01:50:50.487]  And that brings us to the next point, which is the DNA force, which you wanted to cover, and how effective that is at supplying your body with high levels of antioxidants and high levels of protein.
[01:50:50.507 --> 01:50:52.668]  But like Linus Pauling said, vitamin C, too.
[01:50:52.728 --> 01:50:54.869]  Just stuff off oranges at the store.
[01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:56.410]  Blueberries.
[01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:59.052]  I mean, people just need to eat a lot of healthy stuff.
[01:50:59.372 --> 01:51:04.094]  Most people have what they need to survive within a half-mile radius of their house.
[01:51:04.195 --> 01:51:04.755]  The majority.
[01:51:04.835 --> 01:51:05.115]  Amazing.
[01:51:05.135 --> 01:51:06.336]  They do what the plants work.
[01:51:06.556 --> 01:51:06.856]  Stay there.
[01:51:06.876 --> 01:51:08.717]  Let's come right back with Dr. Grip next hour.
[01:51:08.757 --> 01:51:09.757]  Your calls for Dr. Grip.

[01:51:40.339 --> 01:51:41.080]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:44.661]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:44.761 --> 01:51:46.342]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:46.442 --> 01:51:48.203]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:48.383 --> 01:51:53.885]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:54.245 --> 01:51:54.986]  I know, right?
[01:51:55.066 --> 01:51:56.006]  You love it, too!
[01:51:56.386 --> 01:51:57.687]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:57.827 --> 01:51:58.727]  Let's go get some.

[01:52:09.232 --> 01:52:12.433]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:52:12.713 --> 01:52:20.714]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:25.935]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:52:26.315 --> 01:52:28.615]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:48.013]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:52:48.114 --> 01:52:49.134]  Talk about the effects.
[01:52:49.455 --> 01:52:50.936]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:52:50.956 --> 01:52:52.557]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:52:52.877 --> 01:52:53.938]  I feel like I look better.
[01:52:53.998 --> 01:52:54.619]  I feel better.
[01:52:54.699 --> 01:52:55.740]  I feel sexier.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.500]  I love it.
[01:52:56.721 --> 01:52:59.643]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:52:59.703 --> 01:53:02.445]  Get a bottle of super male, a bottle of super female.
[01:53:02.625 --> 01:53:03.666]  Check it out for yourself.

[01:53:38.479 --> 01:53:44.220]  Nanoparasites, termed viruses, infect the iron-poison population, for they require a host with iron to replicate.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:47.881]  Parasites are propagated via the food and water supply and through vaccinations.
[01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:54.282]  Those born after 1945 have the vaccine parasites set to activate now, due to unprecedented iron intake.
[01:53:54.402 --> 01:53:58.382]  Officials prepare for pandemics because they know the vaccine parasites are activating on a mass scale.
[01:53:58.702 --> 01:54:00.203]  This is the extermination plan, people.
[01:54:00.363 --> 01:54:02.883]  For further information, go to unveilingthem.com.

[01:54:16.821 --> 01:54:20.724]  We're gonna open the phones up in the next hour for your questions, your comments on Ebola.
[01:54:21.925 --> 01:54:27.550]  Bloomberg's reporting, Ebola's next stop may be Ivory Coast, as World Health Organization prepares neighbors.
[01:54:28.231 --> 01:54:30.893]  Neighbors who've sealed their borders, how dare them be racist?
[01:54:31.274 --> 01:54:34.637]  We can't seal ours, we can't stop the flights coming in.
[01:54:37.296 --> 01:54:37.817]  Amazing.
[01:54:37.897 --> 01:54:45.986]  Before I go any further, you've heard the rave reviews for the entire line of Infowarslife.com products, and these are things that we're hiding in plain view.
[01:54:46.066 --> 01:54:52.974]  The highest quality, purest, strongest nascent iodine from deep earth crystal sources, not seaweed sources.
[01:54:53.635 --> 01:55:00.237]  We're talking hundreds of millions of years old, lowest price as well, super strength, Infowarslife.com.
[01:55:00.718 --> 01:55:03.779]  Across the board has done so much for me and my family, the whole body.
[01:55:03.799 --> 01:55:04.719]  It's something you gotta have.
[01:55:05.099 --> 01:55:09.701]  The government used to mandate it in salt and they took it out, but then they mandated the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:55:10.141 --> 01:55:13.262]  I mean, that's an obvious conspiracy right there, there's no doubting it.
[01:55:13.602 --> 01:55:15.243]  That's available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:55:16.303 --> 01:55:23.548]  We also have the DNA Force that's $12,000 a kilo just for one ingredient in each bottle.
[01:55:23.568 --> 01:55:30.873]  And it's got a whole bunch of ingredients in there as well that it's on record in the patents and the literature.
[01:55:31.673 --> 01:55:32.835]  Flushes out the cells.
[01:55:33.615 --> 01:55:35.738]  Regenerates and helps the mitochondria.
[01:55:36.118 --> 01:55:37.140]  Lengthens telomeres.
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:41.565]  This is the type of thing with the toxic environment that I personally have been doing.
[01:55:41.945 --> 01:55:43.187]  I take like six tablets a day.
[01:55:43.227 --> 01:55:44.108]  They recommend only two.
[01:55:44.128 --> 01:55:47.852]  Now the super male vitality, all the known concentrated compounds.
[01:55:48.593 --> 01:55:50.114]  You know, really get your glands going.
[01:55:50.134 --> 01:55:52.715]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:55:52.735 --> 01:55:59.057]  And the great part about it is your purchase of the products makes this whole transmission possible and promotes free speech as well.
[01:55:59.097 --> 01:56:02.639]  We're listener supported, not government supported like NPR, MSNBC.
[01:56:02.679 --> 01:56:03.839]  I didn't know they were supported.
[01:56:03.879 --> 01:56:05.740]  I was going to keep hammering that until the cows come home.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:16.525]  So going back to Dr. Group, tell folks specifically about X2, the nascent iodine, and about why you were telling me specifically DNA force is so important to immune system.
[01:56:17.765 --> 01:56:29.373]  I mean, with all the research that we've done over the years on iodine, it's just one of the things that I think every single person needs, not only for water purification, because of the fact that we're all suffering from endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
[01:56:29.413 --> 01:56:36.417]  We're exposed to different chemicals all day long, every day, in the food, the water, the air, and thyroid problems.
[01:56:36.457 --> 01:56:40.200]  Thyroid problems are just increasing day after day after day.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:51.702]  Pregnancies, mental retardation, you know, the calcification of the pineal gland that's going on, the children that are being born with mental illness are not fully formed brains.
[01:56:52.222 --> 01:56:58.084]  There's so many conditions that can be tracked back to iodine deficiency inside the system.
[01:56:58.144 --> 01:57:04.465]  We can officially say when the federal government mandated it be put in, IQs on record went up 15 points.
[01:57:05.345 --> 01:57:07.466]  Listen, that's like New York Times headline.
[01:57:08.266 --> 01:57:10.907]  And you know talk in kind of linking that to Ebola.
[01:57:10.947 --> 01:57:19.971]  I mean remember about I think it was six months or a year ago where the Department of Defense or the military put out a request for something like 300 million doses of
[01:57:21.732 --> 01:57:23.412]  Potassium iodide or something like that.
[01:57:23.432 --> 01:57:29.053]  Yeah guys, type in iodine study, IQ Boost, it's like AP, Reuters, Business Insider.
[01:57:29.093 --> 01:57:30.474]  I want to just show TV viewers that.
[01:57:30.514 --> 01:57:35.655]  Listen, all those underground facilities, they're stocking up on iodine down there and they're stocking up on silver.
[01:57:35.675 --> 01:57:36.455]  They're not stupid.
[01:57:36.475 --> 01:57:44.916]  They know the things that are resistant to practically any type of bacteria or microbe or anything that can affect the human body.
[01:57:44.956 --> 01:57:46.737]  They know how to strengthen their immune system.
[01:57:47.777 --> 01:57:56.600]  And plus those are very inexpensive ways to do that, so... When my arm was chopped open one time or my finger was cut off, they just poured that medical iodine all over it.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:59.340]  Right, that's what they do.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:14.505]  Yeah, because it's strong, you know, antimicrobial, but talking about just a majority of negative health conditions out there from, I mean, from energy to infertility to sterility to not being able to
[01:58:15.345 --> 01:58:21.866]  To function mentally, to stress, I mean, you name it, you can probably link back iodine deficiency to one of them.
[01:58:22.206 --> 01:58:22.786]  Absolutely.
[01:58:22.806 --> 01:58:24.587]  Guys, punch up my computer.
[01:58:24.647 --> 01:58:26.847]  You just put in iodine and the IQ.
[01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:31.488]  Discover Magazine, How Adding Iodine to Salt Boosted America's IQ.

[01:58:43.444 --> 01:58:44.245]  We're not making it up.

[01:59:00.086 --> 01:59:09.590]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:19.475]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:59:19.655 --> 01:59:22.576]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:59:22.796 --> 01:59:29.901]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:59:30.021 --> 01:59:34.424]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:59:34.704 --> 01:59:39.407]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:59:39.687 --> 01:59:45.151]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:59:45.371 --> 01:59:50.595]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[02:00:22.364 --> 02:00:23.286]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.906 --> 02:00:27.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.092 --> 02:00:32.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.278 --> 02:00:35.681]  We got a lot of other points we're going to be going through here today.
[02:00:36.602 --> 02:00:41.687]  Dr. Edward Grimpen taking your calls on Ebola, giving you the latest on that and so much more.
[02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:46.312]  GOP set to dominate in the midterm elections coming up.
[02:00:46.332 --> 02:00:47.473]  Looks like they'll get the Senate and the House.
[02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:51.838]  Most polls show CBS is putting out this info saying it shows Democrats ahead.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.300]  Well, the Republicans don't deliver on liberty this time.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:56.301]  Both parties are done.
[02:00:56.621 --> 02:00:57.661]  And all the numbers show that.
[02:00:58.061 --> 02:00:59.301]  I want to take some phone calls.
[02:00:59.341 --> 02:01:02.102]  The toll-free number to join us for Dr. Group is 800-259-9231.
[02:01:02.222 --> 02:01:12.723]  And in the interest of getting to a lot of your calls, we're going to try to move through them quick.
[02:01:12.743 --> 02:01:12.783]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:13.183 --> 02:01:15.624]  Dr. Group, let's go to Kelly in Texas.
[02:01:16.044 --> 02:01:17.084]  Kelly, thanks for calling in.
[02:01:17.124 --> 02:01:17.724]  You're on the air.
[02:01:19.745 --> 02:01:21.985]  Thank you so much for taking my call, and I bet you both.
[02:01:23.179 --> 02:01:50.574]  I've been doing a lot of research on this Ebola and I've read that where of course you've already said colloidal silver is a good combatant to take and also that I read and I wonder if Dr. Grubin heard about this natural ingredient found in foods that we eat is called selenium that could also help and also it's awful it's awful blatant that they bring patient zero over here right at the beginning of the
[02:01:51.204 --> 02:01:51.664]  I'm good to go.
[02:02:17.921 --> 02:02:22.646]  And then it was sent back three times and never arrived in Africa.
[02:02:23.306 --> 02:02:24.648]  Dr. Group, thank you, caller.
[02:02:24.668 --> 02:02:25.669]  A lot of great points, Kelly.
[02:02:27.254 --> 02:02:35.498]  Actually, I know the people that sent the silver over there, and they had already contacted some doctors in Africa to do some testing.
[02:02:36.118 --> 02:02:37.039]  They sent it over there.
[02:02:37.059 --> 02:02:37.959]  It was flagged.
[02:02:37.999 --> 02:02:39.940]  It was stopped by the government.
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:41.401]  It was not allowed into the country.
[02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:41.921]  Incredible.
[02:02:42.721 --> 02:02:46.423]  And I can definitely verify that story for you.
[02:02:46.483 --> 02:02:49.824]  I mean, because then it's something that some pharmaceutical company can't patent.
[02:02:50.665 --> 02:02:50.945]  Right.
[02:02:51.225 --> 02:02:54.947]  Even though pharmaceutical companies are on record are coming out with all their other patented silver stuff.
[02:02:55.563 --> 02:02:56.423]  Yeah, they can't patent it.
[02:02:56.463 --> 02:02:57.864]  There's no money in it, you know.
[02:02:57.944 --> 02:03:01.546]  To do silver the right way, it takes a long time.
[02:03:01.606 --> 02:03:08.329]  And really, the best form of silver is going to be produced using a high voltage AC current.
[02:03:09.970 --> 02:03:14.051]  So, it's definitely something that I would put at the highest point on the list.
[02:03:14.072 --> 02:03:15.112]  You mentioned selenium.
[02:03:15.152 --> 02:03:16.273]  I would also say zinc.
[02:03:16.293 --> 02:03:19.214]  You know, selenium and zinc are really good for the immune system.
[02:03:19.734 --> 02:03:21.336]  You should stock up on those as well.
[02:03:21.356 --> 02:03:22.718]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[02:03:22.758 --> 02:03:25.843]  Vitamin C. What fruit is the best overall to just give you a lot of stuff?
[02:03:27.545 --> 02:03:44.674]  Uh, acai, fruit, um, you know, I kind of look at readily available things, you know, and seasonal, but any type of, uh, any type of live organic food that you eat, especially if it's picked really fresh off the tree, is going to do your body a lot of good.
[02:03:44.714 --> 02:03:52.138]  It's going to provide you with the nutrients and it's going to provide you the enzymes and all the stuff that you need to support your immune system, so it's really more...
[02:03:52.418 --> 02:03:54.019]  Big Pharma says that's not true.
[02:03:54.159 --> 02:03:56.960]  All we need is Big Pharma and shots every day.
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.721]  It's a conspiracy theory that we even need good food.
[02:04:00.142 --> 02:04:00.902]  Or even oxygen.
[02:04:01.462 --> 02:04:07.245]  Like they're now saying oxygen may not be needed and that's a conspiracy that all we need is GlaxoSmithKline.
[02:04:07.745 --> 02:04:23.225]  Well, it's just like the USDA and the government approving Dow's new herbicide yesterday, the day before, the 2,4-D, the mixture with glyphosate, after there was 80,000 scientists that wrote in and all kinds of congressmen, too, to try to get it banned.
[02:04:23.245 --> 02:04:24.207]  And what do they do?
[02:04:24.547 --> 02:04:25.168]  They approve it.
[02:04:26.109 --> 02:04:44.386]  You know, the design is for them to create these chemicals, create these endocrine disruptors, create all these things to actually cause you to become ill, cause your immune system to go down, so they can go on the back end and prescribe you medications, you know, doctors visits, stuff that addresses
[02:04:45.467 --> 02:04:51.432]  Doesn't ever address the root cause, only addresses the symptoms and causes you to be in a dependency state.
[02:04:51.572 --> 02:04:55.376]  Sure, everything they do is about the welfare, all of it, be dependent on them.
[02:04:55.896 --> 02:04:58.639]  Don't teach you how to fish, but give you fish, tainted fish.
[02:04:59.079 --> 02:05:01.381]  We'll be right back with Dr. Group, your phone calls.
[02:05:02.262 --> 02:05:07.066]  Karen, Anonymous, Jane, Bridget, Peter, your calls are three minutes away.
[02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:08.007]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:10.524 --> 02:05:11.625]  Open your eyes.
[02:05:12.045 --> 02:05:14.947]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[02:05:15.467 --> 02:05:21.610]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:05:21.951 --> 02:05:29.935]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[02:05:30.315 --> 02:05:31.356]  Open your eyes.
[02:05:31.696 --> 02:05:46.668]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.
[02:05:47.268 --> 02:05:54.754]  Optimize the natural power of your eyes with the latest addition to the super high quality InfoWars Live formulations, Occupower.

[02:06:00.559 --> 02:06:01.040]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:01.560]  Occupower.
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:02.241]  Open your eyes.
[02:06:10.452 --> 02:06:15.816]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:17.077 --> 02:06:21.840]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:29.265]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:30.946 --> 02:06:34.048]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:37.271]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:39.304 --> 02:06:43.308]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:44.028 --> 02:06:46.871]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:06:49.086 --> 02:06:50.968]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:51.228 --> 02:06:52.749]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:53.029 --> 02:06:55.572]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:55.912 --> 02:06:59.955]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:06:59.975 --> 02:07:02.157]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:02.537 --> 02:07:04.759]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.261]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:07:07.602 --> 02:07:08.462]  Others don't.
[02:07:09.523 --> 02:07:16.565]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:16.685 --> 02:07:18.846]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:19.026 --> 02:07:24.147]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:24.307 --> 02:07:29.249]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:29.469 --> 02:07:32.551]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:32.791 --> 02:07:36.653]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:36.874 --> 02:07:41.116]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:41.196 --> 02:07:51.222]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:51.422 --> 02:07:53.944]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:54.124 --> 02:08:02.187]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:08:02.327 --> 02:08:06.309]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:23.436 --> 02:08:32.127]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.141]  We're here, live, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:47.241 --> 02:08:47.661]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:47.701 --> 02:08:48.101]  Central.
[02:08:48.661 --> 02:08:51.422]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:08:51.843 --> 02:08:53.823]  Find details at InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:08:54.464 --> 02:08:56.984]  And then, of course, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:57.465 --> 02:08:57.965]  Central.
[02:08:58.685 --> 02:09:06.588]  That's 5 to 7 Eastern, 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain, with the live, syndicated Sunday transmission.
[02:09:08.533 --> 02:09:29.101]  I want to take just a mass of calls in this third hour and intersperse it with some other breaking news at the bottom of the hour on a new contest we're launching to expose the Ebola threat, to expose Obama as a false deity, a false god, and to pull down and desecrate that god of political correctness.
[02:09:29.781 --> 02:09:34.703]  We're also going to look at angry protests, target wealthy whites, vandalize homes, burn U.S.
[02:09:34.763 --> 02:09:37.525]  flags, assault reporter, call for officers' death.
[02:09:37.565 --> 02:09:42.147]  The streets of Ferguson were literally on fire last night, and it spread into St.
[02:09:42.247 --> 02:09:42.627]  Louis.
[02:09:43.127 --> 02:09:48.810]  Kurt Nimmo has a story on Infowars.com, pointing out this could blow up big time over the weekend.
[02:09:49.711 --> 02:09:53.873]  We're also going to have our reporters down on the border investigating.
[02:09:55.073 --> 02:10:01.458]  The CDC scooping up people that are ill and showing how it's wide open because Jay Johnson says that it's not wide open.
[02:10:02.319 --> 02:10:03.900]  So we're gonna go prove that he's a liar.
[02:10:04.181 --> 02:10:05.181]  Oops, he might get me.
[02:10:05.201 --> 02:10:06.202]  He's a big thug.
[02:10:06.222 --> 02:10:07.323]  I have no free speech.
[02:10:07.363 --> 02:10:07.944]  Yes, I do.
[02:10:08.284 --> 02:10:10.185]  Even if you say I don't I'm gonna exercise it.
[02:10:10.966 --> 02:10:12.968]  So that's all coming up.
[02:10:13.628 --> 02:10:19.313]  Dr. Group, we're about to go right back to the calls, but other points that you may have forgotten to make before we go to Karen and others.
[02:10:21.875 --> 02:10:31.200]  Well, I mean, no really other points to that, except for the fact that we just need to watch this whole Ebola thing really closely to determine, you know, what's going on.
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:38.544]  I try not to be fearful and try not to create any fear-mongering or anything, but probably my greatest
[02:10:39.597 --> 02:10:50.662]  Fear, if you want to call it a fear, is if we get to the point where they're coming door-to-door and they're quarantining because then you're helpless unless, you know, there's a mass revolution and we, you know, resist that.
[02:10:51.943 --> 02:10:55.665]  But, I mean, for them to have the ability, they already have the executive orders in place.
[02:10:55.745 --> 02:11:02.048]  I mean, literally, if you're showing signs of respiratory illness, they can, you know, quarantine you.
[02:11:02.148 --> 02:11:03.708]  Obama expanded that three months ago.
[02:11:03.788 --> 02:11:08.971]  You know, take you to wherever the local, you know, whatever the closest camp they have set up is.
[02:11:09.831 --> 02:11:14.714]  I mean, that's, you know, that's probably my biggest situation because then I'm stuck.
[02:11:14.774 --> 02:11:16.215]  I can't do anything for myself.
[02:11:16.375 --> 02:11:22.578]  You know, I'm stuck in a situation away from my family where, you know, I might just have to just get out of the United States.
[02:11:22.778 --> 02:11:25.059]  If that's even possible, they might lock down the borders.
[02:11:25.159 --> 02:11:26.140]  I mean, I've had calls.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.583]  You know, a lot of people call my office just saying, what do I do?
[02:11:29.623 --> 02:11:32.226]  I mean, am I going to even be able to get out of the United States?
[02:11:33.247 --> 02:11:35.769]  By the way, since you mentioned that, we haven't played this video clip.
[02:11:35.789 --> 02:11:38.112]  I'm going to play it and then go to phone calls.
[02:11:38.712 --> 02:11:44.859]  We reported the text of this three days ago when it first broke, but now the video is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.323]  The commanding general of SouthCom, and the world's split up into regions.
[02:11:50.876 --> 02:11:55.640]  Ebola outbreak in Central America could cause mass migration to the U.S.
[02:11:56.281 --> 02:12:02.646]  Now South Com is in the news today saying it could be in Brazil right now.
[02:12:02.706 --> 02:12:10.893]  We know it's in Spain and other areas because folks are running from Africa mainly across west into the Americas.
[02:12:12.074 --> 02:12:16.675]  And so, boy, I tell you, that is not some good news if that is the case.
[02:12:17.035 --> 02:12:21.576]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of the commanding general, General John F. Kelly.
[02:12:21.616 --> 02:12:22.136]  Here it is.
[02:12:22.196 --> 02:12:23.197]  Back to the Ebola thing.
[02:12:23.217 --> 02:12:24.217]  I'll just tell you a story.
[02:12:24.697 --> 02:12:28.878]  I was down in Costa Rica a couple weeks ago talking to our embassy personnel.
[02:12:29.418 --> 02:12:30.718]  One of them relayed a story to me.
[02:12:30.818 --> 02:12:35.600]  They were standing on the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, which is not really a border.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:36.840]  I mean, it's all free flow.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.261]  If you don't have the right papers, you can just, for a very small amount of money, move through the border.
[02:12:41.921 --> 02:12:52.051]  But there were five or six black guys that were there at the border waiting in line to pass into Nicaragua and then on the way north and the embassy person walked over and just asked who they were and they said well we're from Liberia.
[02:12:53.812 --> 02:12:57.136]  Been on the road about a week and we're on the way to New York City.
[02:12:58.177 --> 02:12:58.677]  Illegally.
[02:12:59.097 --> 02:13:00.058]  So they're on the network.
[02:13:01.019 --> 02:13:02.761]  They had flown into I think Trinidad.
[02:13:03.698 --> 02:13:06.780]  And then met up with the traffickers, and now they're on the way in.
[02:13:08.201 --> 02:13:14.365]  They could have made it to New York City, and still be within the incubation period of Ebola.
[02:13:15.106 --> 02:13:30.596]  So I go back to this issue, and I've highlighted this issue in Washington, that if there's an outbreak in the Caribbean, particularly, or in Central America, it will make the 68,000 unaccompanied children, I think, look like a small problem.
[02:13:31.391 --> 02:13:32.332]  General, thank you for that.
[02:13:32.352 --> 02:13:34.033]  That is just chilling!
[02:13:34.833 --> 02:13:40.597]  And you see guys like him that are shooting straight, and then you compare it to the head of the CDC or Obama saying there's no big deal, everything's fine.
[02:13:40.617 --> 02:13:42.538]  I mean, what planet are they living on?
[02:13:44.266 --> 02:13:52.754]  I don't know what's going on at the World Health Organization, the National Institute of Health, the CDC, the Homeland Security, the FEMA.
[02:13:53.134 --> 02:13:57.699]  You know, all of them, it's just like they don't even know what the other one's doing.
[02:13:57.759 --> 02:14:01.402]  I mean, you know, it's just a complete nightmare.
[02:14:01.462 --> 02:14:03.224]  I mean, there's no organization.
[02:14:04.405 --> 02:14:09.270]  They're not even taking the proper steps to contain the waste products.
[02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:14.012]  You know, just the guy that died in the apartment.
[02:14:14.032 --> 02:14:16.813]  They sent one of the kids in the apartment to school.
[02:14:17.434 --> 02:14:18.774]  It was okay for him to go to school.
[02:14:18.794 --> 02:14:20.175]  Didn't clean the ambulance.
[02:14:21.675 --> 02:14:23.196]  You know, they're not wiping anything down.
[02:14:23.216 --> 02:14:25.717]  This guy's spraying bloody poop everywhere.
[02:14:26.178 --> 02:14:27.238]  Vomiting blood everywhere.
[02:14:27.258 --> 02:14:28.038]  I'm sorry to be gross.
[02:14:28.459 --> 02:14:30.119]  I mean, these people just explode stuff.
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.620]  And it's just all no big deal.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:32.220]  Right.
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:35.342]  I mean, I'd be surprised, Dr. Gripp, if he hadn't spread it in Dallas.
[02:14:36.162 --> 02:14:37.523]  Yeah, I'd be surprised too.
[02:14:37.583 --> 02:14:40.384]  I mean, we'll see in the next couple weeks.
[02:14:40.464 --> 02:14:47.548]  I mean, you know, really, we're going to see what's going to happen come about the 1st of December, maybe mid-November.
[02:14:47.668 --> 02:14:49.168]  I mean, that's going to be the tail end.
[02:14:49.188 --> 02:14:51.870]  If it starts spreading, that'll start happening in the next week.
[02:14:51.890 --> 02:14:52.630]  It's the 21 day.
[02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:54.311]  But then the government will try to cover it up.
[02:14:55.336 --> 02:15:04.283]  The government will try to cover it up, but if, you know, we were looking at all the different vaccine trials and everything, and everything pretty much ends to, you know, or starts at the beginning of the year.
[02:15:04.303 --> 02:15:05.244]  So it looks scripted.
[02:15:05.344 --> 02:15:06.825]  It does look scripted, yes.
[02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:19.675]  So, I mean, everything, and as a matter of fact, even in 2003, the New York Times reported that there was some Ebola vaccine testing going on in 2003.
[02:15:20.095 --> 02:15:23.478]  Well, when I saw Bill Gates' name back then, I said, look out, here comes Ebola, on air.
[02:15:23.758 --> 02:15:23.918]  Right.
[02:15:23.958 --> 02:15:24.979]  I mean, it's just pure evil.
[02:15:25.359 --> 02:15:28.720]  So it's not like, you know, they haven't been testing Ebola vaccines.
[02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:33.042]  They've been testing Ebola vaccines and own the patent on Ebola strains for a long time.
[02:15:33.582 --> 02:15:40.145]  You know, and they prepared us with movies like Outbreak and Ebola and all these 28 Days Later and all the zombie movies and all this other stuff.
[02:15:40.185 --> 02:15:45.827]  So, you know, it's conditioning of the mind and then seeing how far we're going to take it, you know, doing test runs.
[02:15:45.847 --> 02:15:49.809]  Yeah, because they're clearly trying to have plausible deniability with open borders and the planes still come in.
[02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:51.089]  They clearly want it spread.
[02:15:51.389 --> 02:15:51.609]  Right.
[02:15:51.629 --> 02:15:53.030]  I mean, there's no debating that now.
[02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:55.152]  But they're always going to test everything.
[02:15:55.172 --> 02:16:02.121]  They always test everything in these African countries because these are poor families, these poor environments.
[02:16:02.362 --> 02:16:03.924]  There's not a lot of media over there.
[02:16:03.964 --> 02:16:04.925]  It's not going to get out.
[02:16:04.985 --> 02:16:05.926]  It's kind of secretive.
[02:16:06.327 --> 02:16:06.968]  It's like testing.
[02:16:07.008 --> 02:16:08.490]  It's like giving black people syphilis.
[02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:10.252]  Nobody will believe if they complain.
[02:16:10.272 --> 02:16:10.913]  Just shoot them up.
[02:16:12.094 --> 02:16:19.677]  Right, and a lot of the testing goes on, you know, back in the jungles in Africa, you know, the originally with... That's where the Pentagon's got the testing facilities.
[02:16:19.717 --> 02:16:28.961]  Right, the HIV testing a long time ago, and the AIDS virus, and all that stuff, and Ebola, all that's usually tested in these jungles in somewhere in Africa.
[02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:31.862]  Something tells me we're not going to hear about this from Al Sharpton though.
[02:16:33.723 --> 02:16:34.944]  He's too busy race pimping.
[02:16:35.304 --> 02:16:37.466]  Well, Jesse Jackson's talking about it, Seth.
[02:16:37.726 --> 02:16:40.488]  Oh, Jesse Jackson says it's racist that this guy didn't get treatment.
[02:16:40.968 --> 02:16:42.169]  No, that's what hospitals do now.
[02:16:42.209 --> 02:16:43.089]  They just turn you away.
[02:16:43.610 --> 02:16:49.634]  Well, the thing is, all of our hospitals are already full anyway with all the degenerative diseases and the flu-like symptoms.
[02:16:49.654 --> 02:17:03.343]  I mean, and now people, you know, especially around Dallas and all throughout the United States because of Ebola, if they get a cough in a respiratory situation, which is actually going around now because of all the contaminated vaccines,
[02:17:04.163 --> 02:17:08.784]  You know, how do you... There's no room in any hospitals right now anyway.
[02:17:09.004 --> 02:17:17.966]  If the Ebola thing takes on and it starts to become a real pandemic and people start coming down with it, there are no hospitals to go to, people.
[02:17:18.026 --> 02:17:19.486]  There's, you know... This is crazy.
[02:17:19.506 --> 02:17:20.066]  Let's go to call.
[02:17:20.106 --> 02:17:22.707]  Let's talk to Karen in Florida.
[02:17:22.727 --> 02:17:24.227]  What's wrong with a camp?
[02:17:24.247 --> 02:17:24.907]  Don't be racist.
[02:17:24.967 --> 02:17:26.067]  Karen, you're on the air.
[02:17:26.107 --> 02:17:26.868]  Well... Right.
[02:17:26.968 --> 02:17:27.648]  It's not a camp.
[02:17:27.708 --> 02:17:29.128]  It's just a care center.
[02:17:30.319 --> 02:17:30.939]  It's loving.
[02:17:31.159 --> 02:17:32.640]  It's not a death panel, it's a loving.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:33.580]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:17:34.821 --> 02:17:36.361]  Oh, hi there, Mr. Jones.
[02:17:36.802 --> 02:17:37.122]  Welcome.
[02:17:37.162 --> 02:17:47.246]  We're five-year listeners, and I just wanted to let you know that we also have the nascent iodine, the oxy powder, and we also bought the water system.
[02:17:47.366 --> 02:17:49.827]  Well, thank you, because that funds our operation and they're quality products.
[02:17:49.847 --> 02:17:50.267]  Thank you, ma'am.
[02:17:51.168 --> 02:17:52.248]  Totally awesome.
[02:17:53.308 --> 02:17:55.369]  And what we wanted to know is,
[02:17:58.163 --> 02:17:59.704]  The gloves for money.
[02:17:59.724 --> 02:18:13.875]  We know that the American dollar travels all over the place and we're starting to wonder when would be a good time to start using gloves for cash or
[02:18:14.918 --> 02:18:17.382]  You know, what are we going to do in a case like that?
[02:18:17.402 --> 02:18:19.725]  Well, I think that's a good point.
[02:18:19.765 --> 02:18:21.688]  If it really starts spreading, you wear a mask and gloves.
[02:18:21.708 --> 02:18:29.159]  But with the Ebola down a few minutes on Monday, I think you're talking about somebody who has it, sneezing on it or having it in their hand, passing it to you at the register.
[02:18:29.199 --> 02:18:29.740]  Right, Dr. Group?
[02:18:31.038 --> 02:18:36.781]  You know, that's a good question, and there's a lot of controversy out there right now.
[02:18:36.861 --> 02:18:42.403]  One of the things we're trying to figure out is how long does the Ebola virus live in fluids?
[02:18:42.423 --> 02:18:46.385]  Let's say, for example, you go to an ATM machine and you have the Ebola virus.
[02:18:46.425 --> 02:18:48.206]  Well, your body fluids are going to touch the
[02:18:48.866 --> 02:18:51.067]  The little pad, the keypad on there.
[02:18:51.647 --> 02:18:52.647]  How long will it live?
[02:18:52.667 --> 02:18:54.248]  Well, there's a lot of different factors, you know.
[02:18:54.368 --> 02:18:56.528]  Is it going to be in contact with direct sunlight?
[02:18:56.548 --> 02:19:00.029]  Because if it's in contact with direct sunlight, it'll probably kill the virus.
[02:19:00.449 --> 02:19:00.909]  The money.
[02:19:00.989 --> 02:19:16.014]  Right now, you know, the reports from scientists that I've talked to are coming back saying anywhere from 5 to 20 days, up to 70 days, what you were talking about, that the Ebola virus can live in bodily fluids outside the body.
[02:19:16.074 --> 02:19:16.214]  Now,
[02:19:16.934 --> 02:19:18.436]  We're coming up on winter too.
[02:19:18.836 --> 02:19:27.204]  So if you, you know, since you're in winter, since a lot of places there's not as much sunlight, it's natural that people's immune systems go down over the winter months.
[02:19:27.224 --> 02:19:32.009]  They're not exercising, they're eating Thanksgiving meals, you know, they're eating more sugary things.
[02:19:32.029 --> 02:19:32.690]  That vitamin D, B12?
[02:19:34.411 --> 02:19:37.372]  Uh, they're lacking B12, they're lacking vitamin D, you know.
[02:19:37.752 --> 02:19:44.995]  So, you know, it's a perfect storm, really, when you think about it, because all these things are coming together at once, at around the same time.
[02:19:45.095 --> 02:19:54.578]  So, as far as, I don't have an accurate answer, but I can tell you that I would just say that the Ebola virus could possibly live in fluids
[02:19:54.858 --> 02:19:56.459]  Outside, if it's not in direct sunlight.
[02:19:56.479 --> 02:19:58.479]  Sure, they're saying it may be going airborne.
[02:19:58.859 --> 02:19:59.640]  We don't know, ma'am.
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:05.041]  We'll try to figure that out, but it's definitely serious because the government is like trying to aid and abet it, basically.
[02:20:05.141 --> 02:20:08.282]  And by the way, they do make gloves that have, that are made... Hold on, we gotta go to break.
[02:20:08.302 --> 02:20:08.783]  We gotta go to break.
[02:20:08.803 --> 02:20:09.683]  We'll be back with Jay and others.
[02:20:10.836 --> 02:20:11.857]  It's already too late.
[02:20:12.277 --> 02:20:14.699]  Criminals have kicked in your door and are now in your home.
[02:20:14.939 --> 02:20:16.740]  Before this happens, homeowners have a choice.
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:21.083]  One, do nothing and hope you aren't one of the 1.4 million families attacked each year.
[02:20:21.343 --> 02:20:22.984]  Or two, refuse to be a victim.
[02:20:23.124 --> 02:20:26.146]  And for as low as $59, reinforce your doors with Door Devils.
[02:20:26.406 --> 02:20:31.770]  Door Devils simply attach to existing door frames and have proven to stop the biggest bad guys from kicking in doors.
[02:20:32.010 --> 02:20:35.172]  Read our police testimonials of real-life events at DoorDevil.com.
[02:20:35.392 --> 02:20:36.653]  Alarms don't stop kick-ins.
[02:20:36.893 --> 02:20:37.314]  We do.
[02:20:37.514 --> 02:20:38.595]  DoorDevil.com.
[02:20:39.455 --> 02:20:48.703]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:48.763 --> 02:20:49.483]  This capitalism?
[02:20:49.543 --> 02:20:55.668]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:55.708 --> 02:20:59.351]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:20:59.411 --> 02:21:00.332]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:21:00.352 --> 02:21:01.393]  It's time to understand the system.

[02:21:01.733 --> 02:21:02.073]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:09.099 --> 02:21:13.000]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[02:21:13.201 --> 02:21:17.562]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:21:17.742 --> 02:21:24.004]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:21:24.264 --> 02:21:28.026]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:21:28.266 --> 02:21:29.646]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:21:29.907 --> 02:21:33.888]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[02:21:34.068 --> 02:21:42.352]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:21:42.732 --> 02:21:50.716]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:21:50.816 --> 02:21:54.298]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:21:54.478 --> 02:22:03.122]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:22:03.403 --> 02:22:03.805]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:13.683]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:22:14.143 --> 02:22:15.884]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:22:16.144 --> 02:22:19.586]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[02:22:19.906 --> 02:22:23.708]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[02:22:24.089 --> 02:22:30.432]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[02:22:30.812 --> 02:22:34.294]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.

[02:22:38.294 --> 02:22:40.735]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:22:40.995 --> 02:22:41.615]  No joke.
[02:22:41.775 --> 02:22:44.375]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:46.436]  And if House Bill H.R.
[02:22:46.776 --> 02:22:51.437]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:22:51.577 --> 02:22:54.218]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.
[02:22:54.378 --> 02:22:56.698]  Go now to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:22:56.878 --> 02:23:00.639]  Thousands of military veterans trust their lives to Infidel Body Armor.
[02:23:00.799 --> 02:23:01.640]  You should too.
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:04.660]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L.
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.001]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:23:06.321 --> 02:23:07.441]  Just won't quit.
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:13.924]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:23:14.184 --> 02:23:17.887]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:23:18.047 --> 02:23:23.171]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:23:23.191 --> 02:23:24.672]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:23:25.113 --> 02:23:27.875]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:23:28.576 --> 02:23:31.458]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:23:32.118 --> 02:23:37.343]  After consuming One World Away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:23:38.104 --> 02:23:45.090]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:23:45.111 --> 02:23:47.513]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:23:47.973 --> 02:23:51.394]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:23:51.954 --> 02:23:52.034]  Wow.
[02:23:52.154 --> 02:23:52.675]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:52.695 --> 02:23:52.915]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:53.035 --> 02:23:53.655]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:53.675 --> 02:23:54.415]  That's OneWorld.
[02:23:54.435 --> 02:23:54.755]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:23:54.835 --> 02:23:55.315]  This is the end.
[02:24:24.907 --> 02:24:37.070]  I'm not going to make the callers wait anymore.
[02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:42.231]  Coming up in the next segment, CDC mandates for medically sealed caskets for Ebola victims.
[02:24:43.271 --> 02:24:49.353]  Revelation follows report of CDC storing thousands of airtight coffin liners in Georgia.
[02:24:50.866 --> 02:24:53.587]  They basically call mass cremation devices.
[02:24:53.627 --> 02:24:55.348]  We have all the documents on that.
[02:24:56.189 --> 02:24:59.290]  This is what the CDC is out currently buying right now.
[02:24:59.310 --> 02:25:02.092]  I remember I did a TV show with Jesse Ventura about that.
[02:25:02.132 --> 02:25:03.292]  We probably need to add that video.
[02:25:03.892 --> 02:25:08.295]  It's the Georgia Coffin episode.
[02:25:08.335 --> 02:25:09.155]  I forget the exact name.
[02:25:09.615 --> 02:25:10.856]  We should probably add that to it.
[02:25:11.996 --> 02:25:13.797]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:25:13.897 --> 02:25:15.478]  Jay in Delaware, you're on the air.
[02:25:15.518 --> 02:25:15.878]  Go ahead.
[02:25:21.075 --> 02:25:21.695]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:25:22.036 --> 02:25:24.817]  Thank you, Alex and Dr. Group, for your dedication.
[02:25:25.077 --> 02:25:25.657]  Thank you, brother.
[02:25:25.797 --> 02:25:27.218]  It's an honor.
[02:25:27.758 --> 02:25:31.080]  My question is for Dr. Group, and I'll take my answer off the air when it works.
[02:25:32.641 --> 02:25:41.185]  What supplemental regimen would you recommend for someone who has hepatitis who does not want to do the interferon treatment?
[02:25:43.257 --> 02:26:01.126]  Well, what I would recommend is you find a good doctor in your area, maybe somebody that has experience with different types of IV bags, ozone, ultraviolet blood irradiation, somebody that can work with you that has experience in, you know, utilizing some of those compounds.
[02:26:02.166 --> 02:26:12.431]  My personal experience, you know, just some of the things that we've used to help support people with hepatitis R, Regano, Silver,
[02:26:12.871 --> 02:26:13.532]  I don't
[02:26:32.285 --> 02:26:43.632]  Worked on effectively if you find the right doctor in your area and no doubt about it and the interferon that they give they give in such high doses that it's it's really not it can actually be damaging to the body.
[02:26:44.212 --> 02:26:56.139]  There was a company in Switzerland that was producing a low-level interferon product that we used to use with some really good success but another thing out there that you might want to look at is called MMS.
[02:26:56.199 --> 02:27:00.262]  It's a miracle mineral supplement and read up on that as well.
[02:27:01.201 --> 02:27:05.966]  And again, though, I mean, no doctor can sit there over the air and specifically diagnose somebody.
[02:27:06.326 --> 02:27:10.049]  Gotta do tests, gotta look at them, but thank you so much, caller.
[02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:12.832]  Let's go ahead and talk to Anonymous in Oklahoma.
[02:27:12.852 --> 02:27:13.513]  You're on the air.
[02:27:13.533 --> 02:27:14.934]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:27:14.954 --> 02:27:15.515]  How are we doing today?
[02:27:15.755 --> 02:27:16.155]  Good, brother.
[02:27:16.195 --> 02:27:16.756]  Thanks for calling.
[02:27:17.529 --> 02:27:18.870]  Hey, I've got two things for you.
[02:27:18.890 --> 02:27:27.138]  I've got a source that works at the hospital here in Oklahoma City that they recently, I heard you speak about earlier, saying that they were being tested for the Ebola virus.
[02:27:27.618 --> 02:27:29.420]  Yes sir, that's in CBS News.
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:33.483]  Report Oklahoma City Hospital isolates patient exhibiting possible Ebola symptoms.
[02:27:33.523 --> 02:27:33.784]  Go ahead.
[02:27:35.226 --> 02:27:42.628]  My source on the inside says that they worked there in a meeting there and said that this individual has been tested.
[02:27:42.708 --> 02:27:43.729]  It came back negative.
[02:27:43.889 --> 02:27:44.149]  Good.
[02:27:44.269 --> 02:27:55.432]  She's under a psych evaluation because this individual had said that she was exposed, had intercourse with an individual who thought they had Ebola and they didn't take any precautions.
[02:27:55.452 --> 02:27:58.653]  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of craziness that comes out of this scare as well.
[02:27:59.374 --> 02:27:59.714]  Exactly.
[02:27:59.754 --> 02:28:03.355]  And also, one more thing, Alex, you know how you've talked in the past about how they project
[02:28:04.033 --> 02:28:04.133]  Yes.
[02:28:04.153 --> 02:28:04.233]  Yes.
[02:28:23.061 --> 02:28:29.023]  The symptoms of these people when they're infected by this vampire, they have muscle spasms and their eyes turn red.
[02:28:29.583 --> 02:28:31.523]  The CDC is involved in this show.
[02:28:31.583 --> 02:28:32.964]  They're completely incompetent.
[02:28:33.364 --> 02:28:38.225]  There's one individual in the storyline who has seen what's happened.
[02:28:38.265 --> 02:28:44.287]  He's trying to wake other people up and they've basically said he's killed people and they've tried to turn the media against him.
[02:28:44.947 --> 02:28:47.628]  In this show, and it's basically projecting 101.
[02:28:48.628 --> 02:28:55.230]  I mean, it's spooky how the similarities are, and this whole storyline takes place in New York City.
[02:28:56.991 --> 02:28:58.411]  Looks like a pretty scary show.
[02:28:58.931 --> 02:28:59.751]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:59.791 --> 02:29:00.452]  God bless you.
[02:29:01.012 --> 02:29:02.572]  Let's talk to Peter in Washington.
[02:29:02.592 --> 02:29:03.152]  You're on the air.
[02:29:03.192 --> 02:29:03.633]  Go ahead.
[02:29:05.193 --> 02:29:06.253]  Hello, Dr. Group.
[02:29:06.834 --> 02:29:07.674]  Go ahead, Peter.
[02:29:08.614 --> 02:29:09.274]  You can hear me.
[02:29:12.534 --> 02:29:18.023]  Your product, and I wanted to ask about a couple of other products that I take if you don't mind, okay?
[02:29:19.084 --> 02:29:20.406]  Yeah, we're not straining your call, bro.
[02:29:20.426 --> 02:29:20.707]  You're on air.
[02:29:20.727 --> 02:29:20.867]  Yeah, TA65.
[02:29:20.887 --> 02:29:22.670]  What do you think of it?
[02:29:25.948 --> 02:29:28.491]  Uh, TA65, I think it's a great product.
[02:29:28.531 --> 02:29:31.394]  I mean, it's one of those products that has a lot of research behind it.
[02:29:31.454 --> 02:29:34.216]  It's, uh, it's for those people out there that don't know what it is.
[02:29:34.317 --> 02:29:43.225]  It's a very expensive product that increases, that's been shown to increase telomere length and, you know, that's, that's part of the anti-aging
[02:29:44.166 --> 02:29:45.568]  Isn't that what DNA Force does?
[02:29:45.728 --> 02:29:54.195]  And that's what DNA Force... Well, DNA Force is designed to prevent cellular damage, which leads to telomere shortening.
[02:29:54.315 --> 02:29:54.475]  Ah.
[02:29:55.176 --> 02:29:55.496]  Alright.
[02:29:55.596 --> 02:29:56.417]  It's a nutraceutical.
[02:29:56.457 --> 02:29:57.218]  Stay there, caller.
[02:29:57.238 --> 02:29:58.879]  I'll finish your question when we come back.
[02:29:59.219 --> 02:30:00.120]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.621 --> 02:30:02.202]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.222 --> 02:30:05.425]  Alex Jones and the GCN Reward Network.
[02:30:09.924 --> 02:30:18.407]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.

[02:32:13.176 --> 02:32:17.158]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:17.458 --> 02:32:18.919]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:19.239 --> 02:32:26.822]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:27.102 --> 02:32:27.942]  But for how long?
[02:32:28.242 --> 02:32:34.505]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:32:34.885 --> 02:32:37.686]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:32:39.059 --> 02:32:42.281]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:42.601 --> 02:32:50.606]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:50.846 --> 02:32:55.870]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:56.270 --> 02:32:58.551]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:58.791 --> 02:33:00.573]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:33:00.893 --> 02:33:05.095]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:12.865 --> 02:33:14.366]  We are on the march.
[02:33:14.726 --> 02:33:17.168]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:17.889 --> 02:33:21.591]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:25.476 --> 02:33:27.296]  Alright, I'm going to go to a lot of your calls now.
[02:33:27.356 --> 02:33:29.977]  I want to get to a bunch of them, but just, boom, get your questions out.
[02:33:30.437 --> 02:33:32.998]  We'll try to get you the answers or your points.
[02:33:33.478 --> 02:33:36.559]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:37.019 --> 02:33:39.719]  Two things I want to hit first.
[02:33:40.219 --> 02:33:45.861]  One is this FEMA coffin story now confirmed at InfoWars.com with the CDC.
[02:33:45.901 --> 02:33:48.381]  We always said, why are the coffins there by the CDC?
[02:33:48.401 --> 02:33:51.002]  You know, why did they attack us when we covered it?
[02:33:51.082 --> 02:33:51.782]  Well, now we know.
[02:33:53.274 --> 02:33:57.337]  And the media would make it about the poor folks that own the property they were stored on, like we were blaming them.
[02:33:57.377 --> 02:33:57.777]  No we weren't.
[02:33:58.257 --> 02:34:02.420]  We were just pointing out what these were being used for and why the CDC was storing them.
[02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:11.346]  But before we go there, they've had different media organizations and MSNBC come out and say that it's racist.
[02:34:12.489 --> 02:34:15.273]  To call Ebola, Ebola.
[02:34:15.673 --> 02:34:16.815]  And I've been saying that for weeks.
[02:34:17.516 --> 02:34:19.298]  You know, the term Ebola, many other people have.
[02:34:19.579 --> 02:34:26.969]  We're also seeing pop-up bumper stickers and signs that say, Ebola, but with the Obama symbol in the middle of the O.
[02:34:28.646 --> 02:34:30.507]  Well, we've come out with a $7,500 contest.
[02:34:30.647 --> 02:34:35.750]  It's going to be an accelerated contest, only two weeks long, then one week to judge.
[02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:37.591]  Usually that takes months.
[02:34:38.071 --> 02:34:40.152]  You get a month to do it and a month to judge.
[02:34:40.972 --> 02:34:41.993]  We're announcing it today.
[02:34:42.013 --> 02:34:45.315]  The contest will end in two weeks and we'll have the winner on Halloween.
[02:34:46.555 --> 02:34:48.897]  October 31st, first place $5,000, second place $200, third place $500.
[02:34:54.219 --> 02:34:58.984]  But everybody wins because you go print off the posters we've made or make your own poster.
[02:35:00.225 --> 02:35:03.348]  Exposing the false politically correct deity Obama.
[02:35:03.868 --> 02:35:05.069]  Exposing collectivism.
[02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:06.150]  Exposing the open border.
[02:35:06.170 --> 02:35:08.272]  Whatever spectrum of that you want.
[02:35:08.392 --> 02:35:09.133]  Use our posters.
[02:35:09.673 --> 02:35:10.574]  Make your posters.
[02:35:11.595 --> 02:35:12.696]  Send us your posters.
[02:35:12.756 --> 02:35:15.258]  We'll post them on Facebook and Twitter and places.
[02:35:16.385 --> 02:35:17.927]  It's about showing the power of the people.
[02:35:17.967 --> 02:35:21.211]  We've done some of these contests that have become huge national news stories.
[02:35:21.231 --> 02:35:22.292]  They've all been very successful.
[02:35:22.632 --> 02:35:27.318]  And what you do is you shoot video of it, and then you put it on YouTube.
[02:35:27.438 --> 02:35:28.760]  We link to the different videos.
[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:30.021]  People watch them by the millions.
[02:35:30.882 --> 02:35:33.523]  You know, big videos get seen a million times, small ones 5,000.
[02:35:33.563 --> 02:35:33.823]  So what?
[02:35:33.843 --> 02:35:34.464]  That's a big deal.
[02:35:35.384 --> 02:35:38.686]  You go out, you get involved, you hang posters in legal and awful areas.
[02:35:39.066 --> 02:35:47.650]  Could be on your own barn, your own business or a commons area, you know, where they hang rock and roll posters or church posters or, you know, dog show posters and nobody cares.
[02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:53.873]  But then when you do, they'll go, it's horrible, man, and arrest them just to show how they want to violate free speech.
[02:35:53.913 --> 02:35:58.095]  When that happens and the local news covers it, then they try to shut down free speech.
[02:35:58.215 --> 02:35:59.015]  More people do it.
[02:35:59.295 --> 02:36:00.236]  It backfires on them.
[02:36:01.207 --> 02:36:14.060]  So, Ebola, and we'll do a document cam shot to show people here, two of the posters, we have the files up on InfoWars.com in the article on the homepage that we're going to tweet out right now and post to Facebook.
[02:36:15.461 --> 02:36:22.167]  In fact, I saw them with the contest page about an hour ago, so I don't see it on InfoWars.com yet.
[02:36:22.748 --> 02:36:27.680]  So we'll get that up on Infowars.com right now, or I guess it's not in the featured news area.
[02:36:28.643 --> 02:36:31.991]  Or maybe it hasn't cashed yet off the cash into my, uh...
[02:36:33.058 --> 02:36:33.638]  My computer.
[02:36:33.798 --> 02:36:35.099]  But just, we'll get it in the features.
[02:36:35.499 --> 02:36:36.300]  Top story.
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:37.661]  This contest.
[02:36:38.761 --> 02:36:42.003]  And I'm going to give folks the headline on the article right now.
[02:36:42.543 --> 02:36:43.264]  Pound signed.
[02:36:43.284 --> 02:36:45.245]  Ebola contest.
[02:36:45.965 --> 02:36:47.326]  Tyranny is the disease.
[02:36:47.486 --> 02:36:49.127]  Get engaged in the battle against tyranny.
[02:36:49.147 --> 02:36:50.508]  One of them Fall Wars latest $7,500 contest.
[02:36:50.528 --> 02:36:50.688]  Ebola.
[02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:58.032]  Uh, is, uh, racist to criticize that they're leaving our borders wide open.
[02:36:58.572 --> 02:37:01.094]  Tell him to halt flights from Ebola-stricken hot zones.
[02:37:01.534 --> 02:37:02.855]  Close the open borders.
[02:37:03.355 --> 02:37:05.396]  Download our posters or make your own.
[02:37:05.436 --> 02:37:08.138]  Shoot video of yourself posting in lawful places.
[02:37:08.658 --> 02:37:09.398]  First place, 5,000.
[02:37:09.818 --> 02:37:11.079]  Right down to 500, third place.
[02:37:11.459 --> 02:37:13.761]  Submit entries by Friday, October 24th.
[02:37:14.221 --> 02:37:22.665]  I will announce the winners on the show on All Saints' Eve, I guess you'd call it, or All Hallows' Eve, Halloween, October 31st.
[02:37:24.431 --> 02:37:28.679]  And again, then we'll dole out and post the videos to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:28.699 --> 02:37:29.881]  We're going to tweak this out!
[02:37:32.319 --> 02:37:33.900]  Ebola is a disease.
[02:37:34.741 --> 02:37:37.523]  Right now, with a link to the article at Real Alex Jones.
[02:37:37.883 --> 02:37:39.244]  Please retweet it.
[02:37:39.684 --> 02:37:42.446]  And then again, the big glossy posters are a great way.
[02:37:42.566 --> 02:37:44.167]  Pound tyranny is a disease.
[02:37:44.548 --> 02:37:46.129]  Hashtag tyranny is a disease.
[02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:47.269]  Make that trend.
[02:37:47.770 --> 02:37:48.690]  Help expose it.
[02:37:49.291 --> 02:37:50.812]  And it says secure the open border.
[02:37:50.892 --> 02:37:51.833]  Infowars.com.
[02:37:51.873 --> 02:37:55.475]  And on the top, blasphemy against what Jamie Foxx says is Lord and Savior.
[02:37:55.955 --> 02:37:56.536]  Ebola.
[02:37:56.976 --> 02:37:57.456]  Obama.
[02:37:57.516 --> 02:37:59.238]  Halt flights from hot zones now.
[02:38:00.171 --> 02:38:01.332]  You want to get a campaign?
[02:38:01.832 --> 02:38:05.834]  So even though they let this spread, if this got big enough, they might back off and do something about Ebola.
[02:38:06.734 --> 02:38:08.575]  Or... Obola, excuse me.
[02:38:09.155 --> 02:38:11.457]  Because again, they want to just do this and not have us pay attention.
[02:38:11.477 --> 02:38:15.058]  You heard Michael Savage saying, Ebola could be the way to bring them down.
[02:38:15.078 --> 02:38:17.259]  Stuff like this could capture people's attention.
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:18.600]  Get involved.
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:22.162]  Get this out to everybody you know right now.
[02:38:22.842 --> 02:38:30.865]  And again, we'll take this live video, what I'm talking about here on the radio, we'll edit it down today, have it on the Nightly News, put that out as a viral video over the weekend to InfoWars.com.
[02:38:31.325 --> 02:38:33.826]  Help stop the spread of Ebola.
[02:38:34.747 --> 02:38:36.828]  Or Ebola, as it's also known.
[02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:40.109]  This is how we counter their tyranny.
[02:38:40.149 --> 02:38:41.630]  So get these posters, get them out.
[02:38:43.210 --> 02:38:44.151]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:38:44.231 --> 02:38:45.251]  You can win the contest.
[02:38:45.271 --> 02:38:47.912]  But regardless, you win by taking action.
[02:38:48.252 --> 02:38:49.813]  Dr. Group, what do you think of this contest?
[02:38:51.041 --> 02:38:52.622]  Well, I think it's a great contest.
[02:38:52.682 --> 02:38:56.504]  I think as many people, I mean, that listen to the show should get involved in it.
[02:38:56.804 --> 02:39:04.227]  And it's just like, that's what we do every single day is answer questions about and tell people how to get involved in, you know, stopping this.
[02:39:04.287 --> 02:39:09.430]  I agree with Michael Savage, actually, because, you know, this could be the takedown of the globalists.
[02:39:09.490 --> 02:39:11.250]  I mean, look at the military they're sending in.
[02:39:11.291 --> 02:39:15.673]  What surprises me is that the military personnel they sent in to Africa
[02:39:16.853 --> 02:39:18.754]  Did so with no resistance.
[02:39:18.874 --> 02:39:20.835]  We don't even know that, they wouldn't tell us.
[02:39:20.875 --> 02:39:28.499]  Yeah, if I was in the military and they tried to send me into a hot Ebola zone, I don't know if I would... And you were in Army Special Operations, you would have said no?
[02:39:28.739 --> 02:39:34.281]  Well, I was pretty brainwashed back then, so I don't know what I would have done, but I would definitely say no now, that's for sure.
[02:39:34.301 --> 02:39:38.343]  I mean, I get military personnel calling me all the time saying that, you know, that have problems.
[02:39:38.683 --> 02:39:42.585]  I've got a guy in Houston that's breaking out in all these weird rashes and all kinds of stuff.
[02:39:42.605 --> 02:39:43.686]  Oh yeah, they use them as guinea pigs.
[02:39:44.286 --> 02:39:52.836]  You know, so, uh, so yeah, I would, you know, get as many people that can get involved and start telling people the truth about Ebola and what's going on.
[02:39:52.856 --> 02:39:55.660]  I mean, I almost don't even want to offer money in the contest, but that makes it fun.
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:57.261]  This isn't fun, it's war.
[02:39:57.802 --> 02:39:59.624]  In fact, I'm going to go out Monday.
[02:40:00.925 --> 02:40:01.726]  Or maybe even today.
[02:40:01.746 --> 02:40:05.948]  And I'm going to hang up a bunch of these posters around town, you know, as a promo video for this.
[02:40:05.988 --> 02:40:14.693]  But it's about you taking action and tying the president, who's leaving the borders open, and letting the flights come in, to the Ebola, so they get the blame.
[02:40:14.733 --> 02:40:17.895]  They may back off if they see that you're giving pushback.
[02:40:17.955 --> 02:40:20.696]  But if we lay there like jellyfish, they'll walk all over us.
[02:40:21.136 --> 02:40:23.878]  New story up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:40:24.258 --> 02:40:27.219]  CDC mandates for medically sealed caskets for Ebola victims.
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:32.162]  Revelation follows report of CDC storing thousands of airtight coffin liners in Georgia.
[02:40:32.562 --> 02:40:37.624]  The CDC has instructed funeral homes to bury Ebola victims that are medically sealed caskets.
[02:40:37.664 --> 02:40:39.565]  That's what we told folks five years ago.
[02:40:39.585 --> 02:40:49.110]  A potentially disturbing revelation given reports the federal agency had previously purchased thousands of airtight coffin liners which were being stored in Madison, Georgia outside Atlanta.
[02:40:49.850 --> 02:40:53.012]  Yahoo News report reveals how the CDC is instructing funeral homes
[02:40:53.692 --> 02:41:02.856]  That remains should be cremated or buried promptly in our medically sealed casket, which must be secure against the escape of microorganisms and have valid documentation for being airtight.
[02:41:03.296 --> 02:41:11.999]  Dallas Institute of Funeral Services Administrator Wayne Cavender said the CDC is worried about an epidemic, but the type of caskets they were recommending were not airtight.
[02:41:12.379 --> 02:41:14.920]  These in Georgia aren't, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:15.261 --> 02:41:16.681]  And you've got more from your sources.
[02:41:17.001 --> 02:41:18.722]  They're calling them a cremation box.
[02:41:19.082 --> 02:41:24.305]  They're calling them multifunctional cremation containers and there's actually a patent on that.
[02:41:24.345 --> 02:41:26.346]  You can probably bring it up.
[02:41:27.527 --> 02:41:29.568]  I can't remember what year it was patented in.
[02:41:29.628 --> 02:41:30.289]  I think it was in the 70s.
[02:41:30.329 --> 02:41:30.569]  There it is.
[02:41:30.589 --> 02:41:35.912]  Multifunctional cremation container for cadaver and it breaks it down.
[02:41:36.292 --> 02:41:36.712]  U.S.
[02:41:37.233 --> 02:41:38.774]  patent number 08-069-980-1995.
[02:41:44.497 --> 02:41:54.785]  Yeah, the thing with Ebola patients is whenever they start getting close to death, though, it's the violent diarrhea, the violent vomiting, and the... The violent Rachel Maddow.
[02:41:55.385 --> 02:41:57.266]  We don't call, we don't talk about bloody diarrhea.
[02:41:57.306 --> 02:41:57.967]  It's called a Rachel Maddow.
[02:42:00.987 --> 02:42:02.248]  They have violent Rachel Maddow.
[02:42:02.428 --> 02:42:28.860]  Right, so I mean, if you think about really how to contain it, it would be almost to the point where you would have, before the patients get to the point where they're uncontrollably bleeding, vomiting, and diarrhea, they really need to be killed, like, before, you know, this is what they're saying, is they need to be put in some sort of a casket, or possibly quarantined, or in some sort of a room with other people, because that's when it really becomes a problem, is towards the end, when they're losing body fluids everywhere.
[02:42:30.181 --> 02:42:33.755]  Hey, they say let everybody in, how about we send all the Ebola patients to the White House?
[02:42:35.649 --> 02:42:37.370]  Well, there, you know, there you go.
[02:42:37.410 --> 02:42:38.790]  I mean, who knows what the White House is.
[02:42:38.871 --> 02:42:40.891]  You know, the White House isn't doing anything.
[02:42:40.952 --> 02:42:49.155]  I mean, Obama's holding meetings with all the African leaders and everything right now, or up at Martha's Vineyard for a long time.
[02:42:49.195 --> 02:42:51.797]  It's just like they don't care what's going on, obviously.
[02:42:51.817 --> 02:42:53.217]  They're not out there talking about it.
[02:42:54.218 --> 02:42:59.940]  And, you know, the organizations that are supposed to be holding the quarantines and helping people out aren't doing anything about it.
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:02.802]  It's all about fast-tracking vaccines and having something ready.
[02:43:03.542 --> 02:43:04.623]  By the first of the year.
[02:43:04.723 --> 02:43:06.404]  So, I mean, you know, you know the predictions.
[02:43:06.424 --> 02:43:12.488]  I mean, they're predicting that in January there could be one over a million cases of Ebola in Africa.
[02:43:12.508 --> 02:43:12.848]  1.4 million.
[02:43:12.888 --> 02:43:13.968]  Yeah, 1.4 million cases.
[02:43:14.008 --> 02:43:23.914]  So, you know, it's just more of a reason to start taking responsibility for your own health, start cleaning yourself out, start... I totally agree.
[02:43:24.455 --> 02:43:25.135]  Let's go to calls now.
[02:43:25.155 --> 02:43:26.936]  I've been hogging the time here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:27.236 --> 02:43:28.637]  Real fast, ask your other questions.
[02:43:28.697 --> 02:43:29.538]  Peter from Washington.
[02:43:30.049 --> 02:43:39.776]  Okay, this product, I won't tell the brand, is Mitochondria Energy Optimizer and they keep bringing in new ingredients.
[02:43:39.816 --> 02:43:46.361]  The question I have, they do have Bio PQQ there, is 10 mg's enough daily?
[02:43:47.253 --> 02:43:48.153]  Well, yes.
[02:43:48.193 --> 02:43:58.578]  I mean, what we've done with the DNA Force is we've taken all the, we've already done 15 years of research on what the best anti, you know, graceful aging supplements are.
[02:43:58.638 --> 02:44:02.580]  Stuff that are going to protect the root cause of aging.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:02.740]  See,
[02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:15.867]  Companies out there are, you know, you might be addressing one thing, you might be addressing another thing, but what we're doing is addressing why the telomeres are shortening, why the cells are replicating faster than normal.
[02:44:16.187 --> 02:44:23.191]  And all that is due to too many toxic chemicals that are surrounding the cell and the extracellular fluid or chemicals that are getting inside the cell.
[02:44:23.931 --> 02:44:32.739]  So our approach is, you know, and we have the BioPQQ and the DNA Force, is to address the root cause of cellular damage.
[02:44:33.079 --> 02:44:37.924]  And the root cause of cellular damage is too much, too many chemicals and too many free radicals.
[02:44:37.944 --> 02:44:46.992]  And that's why the antioxidant levels are there, that's why BioPQQ has been proven in clinical trials to help stimulate nerve growth factor.
[02:44:48.393 --> 02:44:59.144]  That's why myself and others, if you have damaged nerves, my torn Achilles, a hand that's been broken, a finger that's been chopped off, I noticed when I started taking it, those areas got numb, and then the feeling came back more.
[02:44:59.604 --> 02:45:06.811]  And then in my Achilles, it's now like electrical, and some of the feeling came back, but it's frankly quite weird and scares some people, and I get why.
[02:45:07.252 --> 02:45:08.453]  This is psychoactive.
[02:45:08.933 --> 02:45:10.234]  This is real nutraceutical.
[02:45:10.614 --> 02:45:13.554]  I mean, we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just to get the stuff that goes in it.
[02:45:13.875 --> 02:45:16.335]  They have to, like, sign deals with Mitsubishi and everything.
[02:45:16.375 --> 02:45:17.796]  I mean, this is not a game.
[02:45:18.036 --> 02:45:18.896]  This is the real deal.
[02:45:19.196 --> 02:45:24.578]  It's the real deal, and I don't know what product you're talking about, but, I mean, it's not about just one ingredient either.
[02:45:24.618 --> 02:45:28.779]  It's about combining six or seven or eight or nine proven ingredients.
[02:45:29.179 --> 02:45:31.061]  That all work together.
[02:45:31.561 --> 02:45:32.322]  CoQ10.
[02:45:32.402 --> 02:45:33.763]  Transresveratrol.
[02:45:33.824 --> 02:45:41.270]  I mean, look, there's probably 20 different types of resveratrol out there, but there's only one 99% pure transresveratrol, you know?
[02:45:41.931 --> 02:45:44.033]  It's like our bio, PQQ and all this.
[02:45:44.073 --> 02:45:45.194]  This is organic.
[02:45:45.214 --> 02:45:48.037]  This is the manufactured America source.
[02:45:48.317 --> 02:45:48.617]  Right.
[02:45:48.737 --> 02:45:58.702]  I mean, this is... all of the ingredients that go into this product, DNA Force, especially, have, you know, years and years of clinical studies and research behind them.
[02:45:58.822 --> 02:46:01.323]  Those are all linked on Infowarslife.com.
[02:46:01.343 --> 02:46:05.705]  In fact, to be technical, people should go there and read what's patented, what we are allowed to say.
[02:46:05.725 --> 02:46:09.326]  Other people aren't allowed to say this because they don't have this stuff.
[02:46:09.506 --> 02:46:10.507]  This is real stuff.
[02:46:11.127 --> 02:46:11.667]  Thank you so much.
[02:46:11.687 --> 02:46:13.188]  We've got to move quicker through the calls, folks.
[02:46:13.528 --> 02:46:14.929]  Chris and Mass, you're on the air.
[02:46:14.969 --> 02:46:15.309]  Go ahead.
[02:46:16.155 --> 02:46:21.197]  Yeah, I just wanted to advocate some of the products that have really worked for me.
[02:46:21.257 --> 02:46:22.517]  I'm a professional musician.
[02:46:22.577 --> 02:46:25.738]  I sing and play guitar and gig out all the time.
[02:46:26.459 --> 02:46:33.401]  Since you had Dr. Wallach on the show and some of the longevity products like Tangy Tangerine, I haven't had a cold in like two years.
[02:46:35.482 --> 02:46:36.722]  It's just tremendously helped me.
[02:46:37.482 --> 02:46:41.584]  Not only that, I used to get heartburn, acid reflux all the time.
[02:46:43.084 --> 02:46:44.545]  Through listening to Dr. Wallach and
[02:46:45.689 --> 02:46:54.478]  You know, using digestive enzymes, probiotics, and now the oxy powder has pretty much cured that for myself.
[02:46:54.679 --> 02:47:00.184]  And it's real simple, you know, Wallach and the Organic Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 from InforestHealth.com.
[02:47:01.345 --> 02:47:06.049]  You know, he's saying you need 90 things, trace elements and minerals and vitamins.
[02:47:06.290 --> 02:47:09.933]  Well, the government's saying only a few, like we're a plant or something.
[02:47:09.973 --> 02:47:15.658]  And so, of course, stuff like that is just so incredibly health... I mean, it's been life-changing for me.
[02:47:18.433 --> 02:47:35.324]  The iodine, to give you a funny story, I used to have in a... I don't know, ever since I started taking the iodine, I had this embarrassing... I play guitar, and I used to have this embarrassing wart on my middle finger that I could not get rid of, whether I'd try to freeze it off or whatever.
[02:47:35.544 --> 02:47:39.627]  And since I started taking the iodine, the thing just magically disappeared.
[02:47:40.336 --> 02:47:42.897]  I mean, my immune system is just so much better.
[02:47:43.357 --> 02:47:45.878]  Well, look, I mean, I'm no doctor or scientist.
[02:47:45.958 --> 02:47:47.758]  From all the literature I've read, it's simple.
[02:47:48.199 --> 02:47:51.200]  If there's basic deficiencies, if you don't have oxygen, you die.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.961]  If you don't have vitamin C, you get scurvy and die.
[02:47:55.601 --> 02:47:57.642]  And if you don't have iodine, you will die.
[02:47:58.023 --> 02:48:03.306]  And they just keep lowering the level of what you need until someday, I guess the FDA will say zero.
[02:48:03.686 --> 02:48:05.407]  It'll be a thought crown if you say you need it.
[02:48:05.687 --> 02:48:07.908]  And this is not rocket science, what we promote here.
[02:48:08.168 --> 02:48:14.712]  We just promote what we believe is the purest, most powerful, ancient source, crystal source, when everything else is seaweed source.
[02:48:15.473 --> 02:48:21.016]  Look, the other stuff that we, and it's great, doesn't turn into a gas in a Petri dish on a hot plate.
[02:48:21.436 --> 02:48:23.657]  The stuff we use is so pure, it, it, it,
[02:48:24.858 --> 02:48:26.140]  It's not called aerosolizing.
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:27.802]  What's it called when something gases?
[02:48:28.082 --> 02:48:29.203]  It's called sublimation.
[02:48:29.283 --> 02:48:29.564]  Yes.
[02:48:29.704 --> 02:48:30.585]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:48:30.605 --> 02:48:32.787]  I mean, it looks like a purple ghost or something.
[02:48:33.148 --> 02:48:34.930]  I mean, this stuff just goes into your body.
[02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:38.434]  I mean, I don't want to go into details here, but what came out of my skin?
[02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:41.784]  I mean, I wasn't tanning before.
[02:48:41.804 --> 02:48:42.464]  I was just burning.
[02:48:42.504 --> 02:48:45.765]  Now I get really good tans, less sun, and now it doesn't happen anymore.
[02:48:45.865 --> 02:48:46.806]  I guess I've detoxed.
[02:48:47.126 --> 02:48:48.567]  Stuff just poured out of my skin.
[02:48:48.787 --> 02:48:57.270]  Well, iodine's used for every single cell in the body, and it's, you know, it's your skin, your endocrine system, your neurological system, all, any type of cysts.
[02:48:57.390 --> 02:48:58.611]  It's, you know, when you're...
[02:48:59.551 --> 02:49:08.293]  When you take away, the big thing is, with extra iodine, is it blocks the absorption of the harmful halogens like chlorine, fluoride, and bromine.
[02:49:08.793 --> 02:49:13.254]  So really what you're doing is, hopefully, you know... You're not just getting what you need, you're blocking the bad stuff.
[02:49:13.494 --> 02:49:13.915]  Exactly.
[02:49:14.035 --> 02:49:18.356]  I mean, hopefully everybody's learned enough by listening to your show to avoid fluoridated water.
[02:49:18.656 --> 02:49:19.716]  Sometimes you can't, though.
[02:49:19.736 --> 02:49:25.437]  I mean, look, all the drinks out there too, you know, the colas and stuff, those are all made with fluoridated water.
[02:49:25.457 --> 02:49:27.118]  There's so many other sources of fluoride.
[02:49:27.138 --> 02:49:27.938]  A lot of foods have it added.
[02:49:28.078 --> 02:49:30.979]  Chlorine is out there, the bromine is out there, and breads.
[02:49:31.019 --> 02:49:34.860]  I mean, if you eat at a restaurant, you're going to get fluoridated water.
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:37.981]  Look, go to any coffee shop in the United States right now.
[02:49:38.041 --> 02:49:40.522]  You know, I'm not saying any names, but you know the most popular ones.
[02:49:41.022 --> 02:49:44.303]  They use tap water to brew all their coffee.
[02:49:44.323 --> 02:49:54.667]  So when you go in for your latte or whatever, your venti or your, you know, whatever, all you're doing is, number one, you're taking the coffee beans, which are heavily sprayed by pesticides,
[02:49:55.527 --> 02:49:58.509]  And so you're getting pesticides and then you're getting the tap water in your system.
[02:49:58.529 --> 02:50:05.853]  So by you taking the proactive approach of doing this is what we're trying to get all, you know, people to do.
[02:50:06.193 --> 02:50:07.354]  Take a proactive approach.
[02:50:07.374 --> 02:50:13.998]  Listen, I set about to find out what is the hiding in plain view, most powerful stuff that they don't want people to know about.
[02:50:14.358 --> 02:50:16.359]  And understand, but that the elite are taking.
[02:50:16.599 --> 02:50:18.779]  And that's what Infowarslives.com products are about.

[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:36.204]  And you know, a couple times a month, we cover news, but also cover some of these products in depth, because that's how we're funding the whole platform to promote Rand Paul, and to promote the Second Amendment, and to promote controlling our borders, and to promote sovereignty, and to promote free market.
[02:50:36.824 --> 02:50:39.585]  We're sharing with you things that we really believe in and are powerful.
[02:50:39.825 --> 02:50:42.046]  I'm going to do a segment of Overdrive, too, because I want to get to everybody.
[02:50:42.506 --> 02:50:45.468]  Evan, Lucy, Carolyn, John, and others.

[02:50:57.438 --> 02:51:00.420]  I'm glad because that's mainly what I meant when I opened the phones up for everybody.
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.462]  Talking about the products, that was not intentional.
[02:51:02.942 --> 02:51:04.403]  But thank you for the nice reviews, callers.

[02:54:39.162 --> 02:54:45.825]  Central, in studio, back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News, with the rest of the crew.
[02:54:46.045 --> 02:54:48.266]  Evan, in Arizona, you're on the air with Dr. Groot.
[02:54:48.326 --> 02:54:48.706]  Go ahead.
[02:54:49.987 --> 02:54:50.467]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:50.527 --> 02:54:51.427]  First-time caller.
[02:54:51.487 --> 02:54:53.588]  I just want to say I appreciate your show very much.
[02:54:53.608 --> 02:54:55.049]  Appreciate you.
[02:54:55.509 --> 02:54:57.070]  I am less afraid of Ebola.
[02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:59.791]  I am more afraid of the government response
[02:55:00.407 --> 02:55:01.387]  We're good to go.
[02:55:25.816 --> 02:55:30.179]  Living in pre-Nazi Germany, or pre-World War II Germany.
[02:55:30.199 --> 02:55:30.840]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:36.945]  I'm always, over the years, bashing the feds and people, and never really the military, but they were training them to take us on.
[02:55:36.985 --> 02:55:38.686]  But it was that training that woke them up.
[02:55:39.086 --> 02:55:44.370]  Cops, feds, and the military going in the order of military, cops, and then feds.
[02:55:44.430 --> 02:55:45.191]  Feds, not so much.
[02:55:45.211 --> 02:55:46.712]  They're more brainwashing on power trips.
[02:55:46.752 --> 02:55:49.434]  But a lot of them, compared to the public, they're more awake.
[02:55:50.135 --> 02:55:51.336]  Dr. Group, isn't that exciting?
[02:55:52.423 --> 02:56:04.328]  Listen, when all of the, you know, the federal, the high-level federal agents and even people in parliament and the royal family in Europe, they all know and they come... I know because some of them call me.
[02:56:04.348 --> 02:56:07.890]  I actually had people in the royal family fly to my office that had cancer.
[02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:12.454]  Under strict confidentiality to get treated.
[02:56:12.915 --> 02:56:16.618]  You know, to do the stuff that we were doing when we had our, before our cancer clinic got raided.
[02:56:16.638 --> 02:56:19.341]  Well that even leaked out in the news later down in Houston, I remember.
[02:56:19.361 --> 02:56:25.688]  Yeah it did and I mean, I mean you could pull up the cases the FDA that have tried to, you know, attack me.
[02:56:25.708 --> 02:56:28.571]  Well it's on record that Hollywood stars plug your oxy powder.
[02:56:28.971 --> 02:56:29.211]  Right.
[02:56:29.231 --> 02:56:30.573]  I mean you're a big, you're a successful guy.
[02:56:30.993 --> 02:56:34.135]  Right, and they, you know, high-level military.
[02:56:34.215 --> 02:56:38.338]  I've had people from, you know, organizations that aren't even listed.
[02:56:38.418 --> 02:56:42.961]  Black Ops stuff come to me for broken bones.
[02:56:42.981 --> 02:56:54.729]  I had people, when I had my clinic, CIA, FBI training facilities that would come to me for high-tech treatments when they, you know, broke their arm, they needed to heal it within a certain, you know, two weeks or whatever.
[02:56:54.789 --> 02:56:59.432]  So, no, they know, the high-level officials, they know where to go.
[02:56:59.452 --> 02:57:00.833]  And it's not the hospital.
[02:57:01.053 --> 02:57:05.419]  I mean, you know, they know what's going on with the medical system.
[02:57:05.459 --> 02:57:07.322]  They know what's going on with the pharmaceuticals.
[02:57:07.382 --> 02:57:15.473]  They know now if they have some sort of, a lot of times with acute injuries, emergency situations, our hospitals... Anyways, that was rude.
[02:57:15.493 --> 02:57:16.114]  That's a great point.
[02:57:16.134 --> 02:57:17.296]  But, Collin, what was your other point?
[02:57:17.316 --> 02:57:17.836]  I apologize.
[02:57:18.663 --> 02:57:22.405]  Yes, I have a specific question for Dr. Group, actually two questions.
[02:57:22.825 --> 02:57:33.751]  Dr. Group, I have my family oil of oregano, in fact I just placed another order for a survival shield today, and colloidal silver at 240 parts per million.
[02:57:34.252 --> 02:57:45.718]  I've got boys elementary school age, and of course my wife and I. Can you make a recommendation as to what dosage amount I should be giving my family of those three items?
[02:57:46.418 --> 02:57:50.401]  Well, you know, that's that's the million-dollar question right there.
[02:58:07.059 --> 02:58:08.140]  They have a recommended mask.
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:08.900]  I forget the name of it.
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:10.281]  It's the one with the bubble over your face?
[02:58:10.501 --> 02:58:13.582]  Yes, it's a biological filtration mask.
[02:58:14.062 --> 02:58:19.505]  And from what I've heard, some people are selling on eBay and Amazon.
[02:58:19.805 --> 02:58:21.926]  You might be able to pick some up there.
[02:58:22.406 --> 02:58:24.307]  Some of the military style masks.
[02:58:25.088 --> 02:58:27.329]  Do I think, you know, is that really going to protect you?
[02:58:27.369 --> 02:58:33.332]  I think it's going to be better to get in a force somewhere where there's high oxygen levels that the virus can't survive.
[02:58:33.992 --> 02:58:39.954]  As far as your questions about dosages, I'm not really allowed to talk about dosages.
[02:58:40.914 --> 02:58:48.036]  But one thing I do for oregano oil that I've found really kicks in your immune system is about nine drops three times a day.
[02:58:48.096 --> 02:58:49.056]  Nine drops three times a day.
[02:58:49.116 --> 02:58:50.117]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:50.197 --> 02:58:53.057]  We're going to come back and take a few more calls in Overdrive.
[02:58:53.077 --> 02:58:58.539]  I want to thank all of our affiliates and sponsors and listeners and the good Lord above and the crew.
[02:59:00.876 --> 02:59:01.916]  In the near future.
[02:59:02.196 --> 02:59:06.378]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:59:06.698 --> 02:59:07.718]  Security alert.
[02:59:07.918 --> 02:59:09.658]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:59:09.939 --> 02:59:10.559]  Analysis.
[02:59:10.799 --> 02:59:13.480]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[02:59:13.500 --> 02:59:18.481]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:59:18.521 --> 02:59:20.982]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:21.082 --> 02:59:23.882]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:23.942 --> 02:59:27.023]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:27.183 --> 02:59:29.364]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:29.824 --> 02:59:30.984]  People are assaulting us.
[02:59:31.004 --> 02:59:33.325]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:33.825 --> 02:59:35.506]  They're never going to stop.
[02:59:35.786 --> 02:59:39.668]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:59:39.848 --> 02:59:43.029]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:43.449 --> 02:59:46.050]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:47.510]  Imperative.
[02:59:47.791 --> 02:59:49.671]  Destroy Ripple Minute TV.
[02:59:49.731 --> 02:59:54.433]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:59:54.493 --> 02:59:55.853]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:59:55.873 --> 02:59:56.614]  You can feel it.
[03:00:00.618 --> 03:00:01.779]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:03.481]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.202 --> 03:00:07.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.751 --> 03:00:19.915]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:20.575 --> 03:00:21.376]  You want answers?
[03:00:22.157 --> 03:00:23.057]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.698 --> 03:00:27.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.641 --> 03:00:31.785]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.805 --> 03:00:36.008]  With Dr. Group, Martin Armstrong warns a Mad Max event is possible.
[03:00:36.509 --> 03:00:38.210]  We have a great convergence coming.
[03:00:38.270 --> 03:00:42.094]  Zero Hedge at Infowars.com right now.
[03:00:44.403 --> 03:00:46.444]  And we can punch that article up on screen for folks.
[03:00:47.044 --> 03:00:48.324]  Dammit, a few final calls.
[03:00:48.684 --> 03:00:50.285]  Quick question, Lucy, thanks for holding.
[03:00:50.305 --> 03:00:51.425]  You're on the air with Dr. Group.
[03:00:55.487 --> 03:00:55.927]  All right.
[03:00:56.547 --> 03:00:57.247]  Lucy's gone.
[03:00:57.307 --> 03:01:00.108]  Let's talk to Carolyn in Tennessee.
[03:01:00.128 --> 03:01:01.409]  You're on the air, retired nurse.
[03:01:02.608 --> 03:01:02.968]  Yeah.
[03:01:03.209 --> 03:01:03.569]  Hi Alex.
[03:01:03.950 --> 03:01:03.990]  Hi.
[03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:04.510]  Can you hear me?
[03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:05.291]  I'm on speaker.
[03:01:05.311 --> 03:01:06.673]  I can change to non-speaker.
[03:01:06.713 --> 03:01:07.094]  Whatever.
[03:01:07.114 --> 03:01:07.674]  Just go ahead.
[03:01:08.295 --> 03:01:08.836]  Oh, you can hear me.
[03:01:08.936 --> 03:01:09.096]  Okay.
[03:01:09.657 --> 03:01:17.667]  You know, I can't tell you how many times I've gone into a room two or three days and then after that they tell me the patient's got tuberculosis and we need to use a mask.
[03:01:18.300 --> 03:01:21.981]  You know, the people don't have to be admitted with a diagnosis of Ebola.
[03:01:22.021 --> 03:01:24.682]  They could be admitted with a diagnosis of something else.
[03:01:24.922 --> 03:01:25.182]  Yes.
[03:01:25.262 --> 03:01:29.003]  Nurses are going to be going in and out of those hospitals and taking that with them.
[03:01:29.444 --> 03:01:32.725]  And then, I'm wondering, they don't like it when we call in sick.
[03:01:32.765 --> 03:01:34.165]  They don't like it one little bit.
[03:01:34.245 --> 03:01:36.626]  So, they're going to want you to come in anyway.
[03:01:36.646 --> 03:01:39.327]  And, so you're coming in and out.
[03:01:39.367 --> 03:01:44.828]  Now, when it gets really bad, are they going to start forcing the nurses and the other staff to stay in that hospital?
[03:01:44.868 --> 03:01:46.649]  Are they going to say, no, you can't leave?
[03:01:49.358 --> 03:01:56.186]  They will definitely require the health care workers to get vaccinated with the new Ebola vaccine.
[03:01:56.206 --> 03:01:57.448]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:01:57.488 --> 03:02:05.477]  I mean, but the thing is that you bring up a good point because that's another subject we talked about at these meetings I was at this week.
[03:02:06.158 --> 03:02:13.143]  There are health care workers, registered nurses, nurses, everybody in the hospital that have been calling for training.
[03:02:13.183 --> 03:02:15.565]  They feel like they're not being trained.
[03:02:15.605 --> 03:02:21.890]  They haven't been trained on how to deal with this, how to protect themselves, how to deal with potential patients that are coming in.
[03:02:22.430 --> 03:02:28.755]  And they're calling the CDC and getting together and trying to round up training because
[03:02:29.355 --> 03:02:33.336]  Here you have the potential for a pandemic and you have health care workers.
[03:02:33.376 --> 03:02:38.198]  First of all, like we said, four hospitals which are really, you know, trained to handle this type of thing.
[03:02:38.938 --> 03:02:46.940]  And now you have all these health care workers all over the United States and all over the world that haven't been trained on how to handle the virus.
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:48.361]  Well, there's another point that just hit me.
[03:02:48.761 --> 03:02:54.723]  If they'd have shut down flights from West Africa a month and a half ago like England did and France, this guy would never have got here.
[03:02:55.103 --> 03:03:00.244]  I mean, it just shows they know the default position will stop this, but they don't care.
[03:03:00.504 --> 03:03:01.264]  The question is why.
[03:03:01.325 --> 03:03:01.925]  God bless you, man.
[03:03:01.945 --> 03:03:02.565]  Appreciate your call.
[03:03:02.985 --> 03:03:04.285]  Only got time for one more.
[03:03:04.665 --> 03:03:06.106]  Jennifer, sorry to Dave and Bill.
[03:03:07.146 --> 03:03:07.886]  Let's go ahead.
[03:03:07.966 --> 03:03:10.147]  Well, I might get to Dave too, but Jennifer, real fast.
[03:03:10.227 --> 03:03:11.447]  Go ahead.
[03:03:11.587 --> 03:03:15.628]  My question was Dr. Group's thought on diatomaceous earth.
[03:03:17.174 --> 03:03:18.855]  Uh, diatomaceous earth is great.
[03:03:18.895 --> 03:03:21.337]  I've used it for as long as I can remember.
[03:03:21.357 --> 03:03:22.378]  I've given it to my pets.
[03:03:22.438 --> 03:03:26.461]  It helps, you know, I've never given my pets any type of heartworm medication or anything like that.
[03:03:26.481 --> 03:03:28.482]  Those are the skeletons of diatoms.
[03:03:28.843 --> 03:03:29.203]  Yes.
[03:03:29.283 --> 03:03:31.545]  Now, it's just important on where you get it.
[03:03:31.645 --> 03:03:32.745]  I use Permaguard.
[03:03:32.806 --> 03:03:34.026]  I mean, they're OMRI listed.
[03:03:34.066 --> 03:03:35.007]  It's a good company.
[03:03:35.387 --> 03:03:37.969]  And, uh, yes, I have used it internally.
[03:03:38.229 --> 03:03:41.112]  It's great for specifically worms.
[03:03:41.952 --> 03:03:52.122]  Hi Alex, I hope you're doing well.
[03:03:52.202 --> 03:03:53.203]  It seems you're doing well.
[03:03:53.363 --> 03:03:58.388]  I have a question for Dr. Woodgroup first regarding the super male vitality.
[03:03:59.189 --> 03:04:03.193]  If you can just give me a quick, you know, maybe one paragraph explanation
[03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:12.688]  On why a young male like myself at 25 will be interested or should be interested in taking a supplement like this.
[03:04:13.008 --> 03:04:17.812]  Well, there's so many estrogen mimickers out there already that you may not know.
[03:04:17.832 --> 03:04:19.433]  I mean, you won't know until you take it.
[03:04:19.694 --> 03:04:21.035]  But I would challenge you to get some.
[03:04:21.075 --> 03:04:22.416]  It supports the broadcast regardless.
[03:04:22.696 --> 03:04:24.037]  And I just took some more when you mentioned it.
[03:04:24.057 --> 03:04:28.201]  Because let me tell you, I notice it when I don't take it, especially in the morning.
[03:04:28.261 --> 03:04:29.102]  I'm sorry, go ahead Dr. Drew.
[03:04:29.642 --> 03:04:33.925]  It just really depends on what you're exposed to and what you have been exposed to for your whole life.
[03:04:33.945 --> 03:04:39.669]  You know, we start really seeing a hormone decrease in men right around 25 to 28 years old.
[03:04:39.689 --> 03:04:45.733]  You start seeing your testosterone levels go down, DHEA levels go down, your growth hormone levels go down.
[03:04:45.833 --> 03:04:51.097]  So, and at the same time we're exposed to all these phytoestrogens and we're in an estrogen dominant
[03:04:51.277 --> 03:04:52.398]  Hey, sorry, out of time.
[03:04:52.438 --> 03:04:54.361]  Dr. Group, thanks for spending two hours with us.
[03:04:54.821 --> 03:04:56.283]  Great job, great job of the crew.
[03:04:56.964 --> 03:04:59.787]  If you want, we'll welcome you on the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:05:00.087 --> 03:05:01.309]  But thank you so much for your time.
[03:05:01.549 --> 03:05:07.176]  Pray for America, pray for Africa, pray for the world, for peace and for this Ebola epidemic to stop.
[03:05:07.196 --> 03:05:07.897]  God bless you all.
[03:05:11.297 --> 03:05:14.803]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[03:05:14.964 --> 03:05:18.931]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[03:05:19.252 --> 03:05:20.674]  Can you put two and two together?
