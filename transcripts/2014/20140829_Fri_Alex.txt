[00:00:01.095 --> 00:00:03.959]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.885]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:16.475]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.176]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.018]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:21.479]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.160]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.424]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.108]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:41.796]  Well, it's hard to believe, ladies and gentlemen, that it's already Friday.
[00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:45.325]  29th day of August 2014.
[00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:48.926]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.527 --> 00:01:11.873]  I'm going to get my limited crew, because they're so busy and so few, to go back to the last year and a half where I have basically broken down exactly what happened hundreds of times.
[00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:17.566]  So that I can have those clips on the Sunday show, this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:21.828 --> 00:01:36.735]  And the scores of articles by Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, and others, where we specifically said, the West is arming Al Qaeda, changing their name to confuse the public, to IS and ISIS,
[00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:47.402]  And is going to attack the West, and that's going to be used as a pretext to take American liberties, European liberties, and deploy paramilitary on the streets.
[00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:57.186]  And I've also said over and over again that Obama has taken more vacations than anyone I have ever seen.
[00:01:57.946 --> 00:01:58.846]  And the media admits that.
[00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:03.788]  He breaks the record of even George W. Bush.
[00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:06.804]  Who would take about two and a half months of vacation.
[00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.087]  Obama takes over four months of vacation a year.
[00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:18.120]  But I said that if he ever comes home from a vacation, that's because he doesn't want to get blamed for what's about to happen.
[00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.964]  It's a bad image problem.
[00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:28.179]  Urgent is the Drugs Report headline.
[00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:34.724]  Obama to intercept and to interrupt weekend fundraising trip will return to DC.
[00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:39.348]  He was going to attend a MSNBC wedding and do three fundraisers.
[00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.213]  But he will still attend the MSNBC wedding.
[00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:48.916]  While UK raises terror threat to severe.
[00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:51.478]  Basically their highest level.
[00:02:56.616 --> 00:03:00.699]  The FBI has put out a terror alert as well today.
[00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.182]  Do you know who's not listed on the terror alert?
[00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:11.726]  This is out of the Washington Times.
[00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:17.369]  FBI National Domestic Threat Assessment Omits Islamist Terrorism.
[00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.272]  So they're saying a domestic attack, meaning here in the US,
[00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:27.223]  Could happen at any moment, but Muslims, radical Muslims, are not listed.
[00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:29.544]  You know who is listed, right?
[00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:31.144]  You know the drill.
[00:03:31.164 --> 00:03:32.605]  We first broke this seven years ago.
[00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:33.145]  No one believed us.
[00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:34.085]  It's mainstream news now.
[00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:40.368]  Even when it was finally in the New York Times a week later, we got no credit.
[00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:40.988]  That's fine.
[00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.389]  Just want people to know, we're not making stuff up, okay?
[00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.650]  No matter how wild it sounds, it's documented.
[00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:49.371]  I wish I was wrong.
[00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:58.447]  FBI National Domestic Threat Assessment Omits Islamist Terrorism, Bill Gertz.
[00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.610]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:08.232]  Isn't that just special?
[00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:16.876]  Can we put two and two together here?
[00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:31.056]  Veterans, returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, constitutionalists, anybody who doesn't love Mao Zedong.
[00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:32.958]  And I'm not even joking.
[00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.881]  We've got 10 czars praising Mao.
[00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:41.165]  I guess he's the politically correct one because he's Asian, so nothing he does could be wrong.
[00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:43.708]  Only white people could be bad, like Hitler or Stalin.
[00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:47.692]  No, he has the world record for killing people.
[00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:49.793]  80 plus million is the Chinese number.
[00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:52.494]  CIA says 60 something million.
[00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:53.395]  Whatever.
[00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:55.516]  The point is he killed more people than anybody ever in history.
[00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:59.278]  We have a government run by people that endorse Mao Zedong.
[00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:01.178]  We're going to come back and get into it.
[00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.280]  I'm telling you, they may be getting ready to pull the big false flag.
[00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:08.262]  Drudge just had a siren go off on Putin.
[00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:17.653]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[00:05:18.053 --> 00:05:25.374]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:39.777]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:43.809]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.931]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:49.691]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:57.595]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:58.715]  But for how long?
[00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:05.278]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.480]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:12.308]  In the near future.
[00:06:12.588 --> 00:06:16.231]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:16.752]  Security alert.
[00:06:17.092 --> 00:06:18.113]  Security alert.
[00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:20.054]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:23.878]  Analysis, info wars, building, independent media operations.
[00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:26.620]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.862]  We are the ones responsible.
[00:06:28.902 --> 00:06:29.822]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:31.263]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:34.266]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:34.346 --> 00:06:37.368]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:37.568 --> 00:06:39.810]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.411]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:43.753]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.875]  They're never going to stop.
[00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:49.839]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:56.486]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.788]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:06:58.808 --> 00:07:00.570]  You can feel it.
[00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.122]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:16.064]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.785]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:25.587]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:28.729]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:31.790]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.791]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:36.652]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:36.732 --> 00:07:42.234]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:45.955]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:48.956]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:56.178]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:07:56.378 --> 00:07:59.439]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:25.871]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.317 --> 00:08:36.664]  Danger Zone bringing us in on this live Friday, 29th day of August 2014 transmission.
[00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:40.108]  You don't see that but a few times a year, DrugsReport.com.
[00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.192]  Putin, don't mess with Russia.
[00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:45.195]  They've got the siren going.
[00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:46.356]  And hey...
[00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:49.078]  There's no compliment like imitation.
[00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:53.021]  We have our siren here going as well.
[00:08:53.661 --> 00:09:00.106]  And believe me, I want it red-linked when we post this Reuters article with links to our background and research on this.
[00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:07.851]  I'm going to add the Ray McGovern video that we re-aired yesterday to that, where he says this could end in nuclear war.
[00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:10.553]  Headline, top CIA analyst.
[00:09:11.704 --> 00:09:16.269]  Moving troops into Poland and Ukraine could trigger nuclear war.
[00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:18.271]  A very good chance of it.
[00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:24.738]  And now Putin has come out saying, don't mess with nuclear Russia, Putin says, Reuters.
[00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:32.467]  Vladimir Putin said today, just minutes ago, we're going to post the actual Russian transcript at InfoWars so you get the full thing.
[00:09:33.784 --> 00:09:37.587]  On Friday, Russia's armed forces... See why I spent three hours on this yesterday?
[00:09:37.607 --> 00:09:40.008]  I had people asking why I was making such a big deal of Ukraine.
[00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:41.610]  Because this is a big deal.
[00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.192]  Russian troops are going into Ukraine right now.
[00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:48.374]  And I don't just sit there and agree with CNN.
[00:09:48.394 --> 00:09:50.276]  They've been in a proxy battle for six months.
[00:09:51.018 --> 00:10:05.405]  President Vladimir Putin said on Friday Russia's armed forces, backed by its nuclear arsenal, were ready to meet any aggression, declaring at a pro-Kremlin youth camp that foreign states should understand it's best not to mess with us.
[00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:10.487]  This is absolutely insane, crazy-level information.
[00:10:11.668 --> 00:10:12.989]  Putin told the Assembly
[00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:18.521]  On the banks of the lake near Moscow, that Russian takeover.
[00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:21.143]  In fact, I'll guarantee you this is on RT right now, guys.
[00:10:21.444 --> 00:10:22.244]  Go to RT Russia.
[00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:23.306]  I guarantee it's their top video.
[00:10:24.022 --> 00:10:27.644]  Putin told the assembly on the banks of the lake near Moscow.
[00:10:27.884 --> 00:10:29.705]  Let's get that on Infowars.com as well.
[00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:39.009]  The Russian takeover of Crimea in March was essential to save a largely Russian-speaking population from Ukrainian government violence.
[00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.010]  And they have been there ethnically cleansing them.
[00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:50.035]  He said continued fighting in Eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists launched an uprising in April, was the latest of a reversal
[00:10:51.263 --> 00:10:53.789]  And a refusal by Kiev to negotiate.
[00:10:55.876 --> 00:11:02.520]  Ukraine and Western governments accuse Russia of sending troops in armor to back the separatists in a conflict that has already killed over 2,000 people.
[00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:04.001]  Russia denies the charge.
[00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:06.983]  Russia is far from being involved in any large-scale conflicts.
[00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:08.224]  Notice that key word.
[00:11:08.564 --> 00:11:10.105]  These are asymmetrical skirmishes.
[00:11:10.746 --> 00:11:21.133]  He said at the camp on the banks of the lake, we don't want that and we don't plan it, but naturally we should always be ready to repel any aggression towards Russia.
[00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:30.646]  Russia's partners should understand it's best not to mess with us, said Putin, dressed casually in a grey sweater and light blue jeans.
[00:11:30.966 --> 00:11:34.893]  Thank God I think no one is thinking of unleashing a large-scale conflict with Russia.
[00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:37.234]  They're moving U.S.
[00:11:37.274 --> 00:11:42.459]  troops, mercenaries, you name it, into Poland and Ukraine with the CIA director setting it all up three months ago.
[00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:43.379]  This is all public.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.664]  Thank God you're not planning something because we have nuclear weapons and we're rolling them up to the border.
[00:11:50.325 --> 00:11:53.949]  And again, it's not our government, folks.
[00:11:54.009 --> 00:12:01.215]  It's globalists manipulating this just like they funded Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Al-Qaeda in Syria as the main force.
[00:12:01.495 --> 00:12:03.076]  They renamed it ISIS.
[00:12:04.443 --> 00:12:19.557]  Now the political class says, brace for terror attack, we're about to get hit by Al Qaeda or ISIS, highest terror level alert in England, terror level alert in New York City, for ISIS, and no one's talking about who gave them the weapons.
[00:12:20.358 --> 00:12:28.005]  Just a year ago we had Rand Paul saying, we don't want to be the air force for Al Qaeda, and Senator Ted Cruz and others.
[00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.356]  And so they had a problem.
[00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.438]  The CFR openly said, we have a problem.
[00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:36.099]  It's coming out that we're working with these people.
[00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:36.699]  What do we do?
[00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:43.544]  So they have this whole PR thing of, well, we can't control them and they are good fighters and Assad is bad, but we'll bomb them later.
[00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:45.545]  And, you know, we'll take care of the Al Qaeda problem.
[00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:45.965]  I think?
[00:13:06.727 --> 00:13:13.373]  And then we're basically told, brace for terror attack, brace for terror attack, brace for terror attack.
[00:13:13.774 --> 00:13:17.357]  The al-Qaeda threat, the IS threat, is real.
[00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:26.225]  But they were funded, protected, shepherded by the criminals that have hijacked our country and Europe and many other nations.
[00:13:26.586 --> 00:13:27.306]  Is Putin good?
[00:13:28.089 --> 00:13:44.319]  No, he represents a mafioso-type Russian strong-arm system where basically the KGB just became the oligarchs instead of the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the Arm and Hammer Al Gore dynasty that owned the big factories all over Russia.
[00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:48.402]  Our government in 1917 put the Bolsheviks in.
[00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:50.023]  On record, it's declassified.
[00:13:50.743 --> 00:13:52.485]  Gutted the whole country over 30 years.
[00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.366]  Stalin was our big ally.
[00:13:54.446 --> 00:13:55.427]  Lenin was our ally.
[00:13:55.807 --> 00:14:00.732]  They were in Time Magazine as saviors, even in the mid-30s and late-30s and early-40s.
[00:14:02.153 --> 00:14:07.457]  Endorsed publicly, given all our major factories, built up to take over the world.
[00:14:08.058 --> 00:14:12.101]  So we could then point the finger and say, oh my gosh, the commies are taking over.
[00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:14.323]  We've got to build up a big army to counter them.
[00:14:14.644 --> 00:14:16.926]  And then that army took over the rest of the world.
[00:14:17.952 --> 00:14:20.134]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean.
[00:14:20.474 --> 00:14:22.896]  In between the two of them, they licked the platter clean.
[00:14:26.619 --> 00:14:28.321]  These are children's nursery rhymes.
[00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:32.004]  I'm sure the public can understand what's happening here.
[00:14:33.285 --> 00:14:34.346]  This is so simple.
[00:14:34.386 --> 00:14:38.770]  And when I talk like that, I'm not talking to our general listeners that know more than I do, in many cases.
[00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.032]  I'm always amazed by how informed people are.
[00:14:41.472 --> 00:14:43.054]  I'm talking about the general public.
[00:14:43.374 --> 00:14:45.636]  The system thinks you're so dumb.
[00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:59.836]  They think you're so stupid that they would fund Al-Qaeda, protect Al-Qaeda, give them Stinger missiles just a year ago.
[00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:05.879]  For the last four years they've been doing it publicly, but for a year it's been escalated.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:15.864]  And then turn right around and say we've got to take your rights and have armored vehicles on the street corners and checkpoints everywhere because ISIS is inside the country with Stinger missiles and they're about to shoot down 20 airliners a day.
[00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:19.521]  Literally.
[00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:30.427]  If they got 100 Stinger missiles into this country, and half of the missile launches were successful, you'd be talking about 50 aircraft shot down.
[00:15:32.588 --> 00:15:38.531]  They were given 15,000 MPADs, many of them more advanced and high-tech than the latest Stinger-type missiles.
[00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:42.882]  And you can see the Operation Terror the globalists are going to launch.
[00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:47.585]  They could shoot down hundreds and hundreds of aircraft with these in Europe, the United States, the Middle East.
[00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:58.030]  The FAA had to suspend during the last Gaza crisis that just ended, thank God, air flights into Israel because they know there's impads out there.
[00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:18.537]  So I want to explain, this is a real crisis, but the Global Crime Syndicate, call them Chaos, call them Spectre, call them Dr. Evil, whatever you want to call these groups, that are going to make money off weapons sales, off the crisis, off the insider trading, off of knowing what's coming before it happens, they literally are using this to destabilize the entire planet.
[00:16:19.884 --> 00:16:22.486]  And the Russians are not in an offensive posture.
[00:16:22.526 --> 00:16:37.197]  The Communist Chinese, backed by the Globalist, are buying basically up the oil fields worldwide, the rare earth minerals, the weapon systems, the media systems, censoring US media, working with Microsoft to censor the internet worldwide and Google.
[00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.739]  China is a real hardcore New World War threat.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.501]  Russia
[00:16:44.646 --> 00:16:54.072]  There is some intermediary connections with the Globalists and the New World Order, but Russia, through Sholts and Eatson, discovered that they'd been hijacked by a eugenics program to destroy them.
[00:16:54.892 --> 00:17:02.797]  That's why communism was put in there, because Russia was the only rival to the Globalists, using the West parasitically as their engine of domination.
[00:17:04.197 --> 00:17:09.941]  So, Sholts and Eatson wrote a bunch of books on this, not the one he won the Nobel Prize for, Gulag Archipelago.
[00:17:10.814 --> 00:17:12.836]  And he met repeatedly with Putin.
[00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:24.244]  Now, I don't know if Putin's double-crossing all that, but if you look at Russian radio and TV, it's New World Order, there's cancer in the vaccines, global government, they want to kill us, have children, don't abort your children.
[00:17:24.264 --> 00:17:27.866]  I mean, Russia knows what's going on.
[00:17:28.587 --> 00:17:33.430]  And just the fact that that's caught on in Russia, the New World Order could start a nuclear war with them.
[00:17:35.828 --> 00:17:36.288]  You understand that?
[00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:43.895]  They want to take their gas pipelines, they want to take their oil fields, they want to take their only port to get stuff out to Europe, and they're doing it right now.
[00:17:43.995 --> 00:17:48.419]  You are seeing what Napoleon and what Hitler did.
[00:17:48.999 --> 00:17:51.341]  And by the way, you notice Obama knows he won't get in any trouble.
[00:17:51.381 --> 00:17:52.042]  The globalists know.
[00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:56.126]  He's about to sign an executive order, that's in the Associated Press, to legalize the illegals.
[00:17:57.247 --> 00:17:58.708]  Gonna stop deportations completely.
[00:18:01.107 --> 00:18:06.490]  He is about to sign us onto the UN and put carbon taxes on, based on everything we do, outside of law.
[00:18:07.511 --> 00:18:10.112]  And Rand Paul said, the Senator said, you are not a king.
[00:18:10.352 --> 00:18:12.914]  Well, if he doesn't go to jail, he is a king.
[00:18:13.154 --> 00:18:19.898]  And now the establishment sets the precedent to whoever they put in as their puppet dictator will be a dictator in fact.
[00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:22.380]  An elected dictator.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.480]  Because it won't matter.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.182]  Once you elect them, they act dictatorially.
[00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:29.562]  So you can see it on every front.
[00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:31.183]  The globalists are taking down Africa.
[00:18:31.503 --> 00:18:32.564]  They're taking down Europe.
[00:18:32.604 --> 00:18:34.325]  They're taking down Latin America.
[00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:35.626]  They're taking down Asia.
[00:18:35.706 --> 00:18:37.287]  They are taking everything down.
[00:18:37.347 --> 00:18:38.328]  I'm skipping this network break.
[00:18:38.388 --> 00:18:38.948]  It's too important.
[00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.392]  That means our deer stations shouldn't be covering this up because it's a network break.
[00:18:44.412 --> 00:18:46.653]  This costs us $3,000, $4,000 every time we skip it.
[00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:47.554]  But it's that important.
[00:18:47.574 --> 00:18:48.014]  I'm skipping it.
[00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:55.169]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you realize the magnitude of what we're facing?
[00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.571]  Stuff is so hardcore that it's disrespectful.
[00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.632]  You know, they'll have some O.J.
[00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:07.235]  Simpson verdict, or they'll have some hyped up Miley Cyrus thing, and talk radio will suspend commercials for a whole day sometimes.
[00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:09.976]  I feel like I ought to suspend them, period.
[00:19:11.038 --> 00:19:12.439]  We ought to be on our knees.
[00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:18.781]  Everybody should be at church right now praying to God that this Cuban Missile Crisis Part 2 comes to an end.
[00:19:19.001 --> 00:19:24.443]  But this time it's not the evil communist Russians trying to put missiles in Cuba.
[00:19:25.303 --> 00:19:30.525]  It is the West moving missiles to shoot down their missiles so there can be a first strike on Russia.
[00:19:31.727 --> 00:19:33.647]  And Russia sees the missile cruisers coming in.
[00:19:33.927 --> 00:19:37.468]  They see the systems to shoot down their response strike.
[00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:41.909]  They see the mercenaries, Al-Qaeda being turned loose, all over their borders.
[00:19:42.609 --> 00:19:45.750]  From Chechnya, you know, right through to Russia proper, blowing stuff up.
[00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.111]  And it's Western-backed.
[00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:55.632]  They don't even hide the fact that the CIA is arming Al-Qaeda groups to attack Russia.
[00:19:57.372 --> 00:19:59.313]  So you can see the massive double-cross.
[00:19:59.353 --> 00:19:59.673]  And again,
[00:20:00.455 --> 00:20:01.656]  They're shutting off our power.
[00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:03.096]  They're shutting off our jobs.
[00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.017]  They're shutting down our coal power plants.
[00:20:05.377 --> 00:20:08.579]  They're passing more taxes here to shut us down.
[00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:09.739]  Those are sanctions.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:20.424]  Obamacare is a sanction on our medical care system, on the average person, and seven taxes on blue-collar workers and poor people, and a total of 20-plus taxes.
[00:20:20.984 --> 00:20:21.545]  On record!
[00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:22.645]  You're now feeling it.
[00:20:22.885 --> 00:20:23.986]  You're now seeing it.
[00:20:26.232 --> 00:20:27.293]  Same thing with Russia.
[00:20:28.054 --> 00:20:34.319]  So we have a lot of solidarity with the Russian people and the people of the EU who are being hurt by these sanctions.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.886]  It's hurting our markets, but the globalists don't care because they're going to be the last men standing when they've consolidated the global economy.
[00:20:43.007 --> 00:20:46.650]  And Putin has gone... Call Ray McGovern, see if we can get him on.
[00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.973]  I want to get an analyst on about this right now.
[00:20:52.199 --> 00:21:02.102]  Because if they see a missile fired into their territory, Russia will launch on warning, is the default, and it will be the end of the world as we know it.
[00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:06.324]  And a large portion of the Earth will die, like out of Revelations or something.
[00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:11.626]  You don't hear a lot about America in Revelations, do you?
[00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:13.026]  It's like we're going to be blown away.
[00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:14.687]  Why are all the elite leaving the country?
[00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:18.488]  I'm not saying this is going to happen, but let me tell you, it is in the cards.
[00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:33.704]  It's like Russian roulette, ladies and gentlemen, pun intended, with six bullets in the chamber, and the globalists are so arrogant and so full of bravado and chutzpah that they are rolling that cylinder and then putting it to their head and pulling the trigger, and our head as well.
[00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:35.445]  And I am sick of it!
[00:21:37.887 --> 00:21:46.054]  I am sick of them rolling that cylinder, putting one bullet in, shutting it down, playing Russian roulette with our lives.
[00:21:48.047 --> 00:21:54.310]  And let me tell you, I've studied the psychology of the Russians, I know the CIA has, the anthropologists have, the sociologists, the rest of them.
[00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:10.679]  You had one of the former deputy heads of the CIA come out yesterday, Kit Daniels wrote about it, at Infowars.com, and say, it's time for us to kill Putin, or it's time for the KGB elite, the FSB, to kill him, or we are going to come after you.
[00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:23.062]  And they're taking all those rich KGB guys' bank accounts, they're messing with them, they're doing dirty tricks, they've got black ops in Russia messing with their families, trying to get the Russians to start a war.
[00:22:25.002 --> 00:22:27.423]  And it is because the New World Order has advanced weapons and things.
[00:22:27.883 --> 00:22:28.464]  It won't matter.
[00:22:28.664 --> 00:22:31.145]  Let's say they shoot down 98% of the nuclear missiles.
[00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:34.546]  Russia's got 10,000.
[00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:43.082]  Topol-Ms, railway-fired, medium-long-range, submarine-launched, cruise missiles, way more than 10,000.
[00:22:43.122 --> 00:22:43.362]  What is 1% of 10,000?
[00:22:43.422 --> 00:22:43.362]  100.
[00:22:43.442 --> 00:22:47.004]  100 missiles make it in.
[00:22:47.024 --> 00:22:53.307]  The average missile, let's say, has 10 devices in it.
[00:22:53.327 --> 00:22:54.928]  10 MIRVs.
[00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:06.920]  Five of them are decoys.
[00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:08.982]  So what's five?
[00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:11.165]  Five of them are decoys, five are warheads.
[00:23:11.705 --> 00:23:12.346]  That's a low number.
[00:23:12.466 --> 00:23:14.549]  Some might have twenty packages.
[00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:15.710]  Ten are warheads.
[00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.674]  Or sometimes an entire package will be warheads.
[00:23:22.338 --> 00:23:24.300]  You got cruise missiles that come in and fire
[00:23:25.501 --> 00:23:33.486]  other cruise missiles off of them to basically get the targeting systems off so that the dummy cruise missiles with bigger signatures get shot down.
[00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:35.807]  I mean, is this really what we want?
[00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:37.088]  Probably.
[00:23:39.189 --> 00:23:43.592]  But subconsciously, we want to join the 54 million aborted babies, don't we?
[00:23:44.472 --> 00:23:46.413]  Subconsciously, we know we're a wicked nation.
[00:23:46.674 --> 00:23:48.174]  Subconsciously, we know we're bad.
[00:23:49.055 --> 00:23:54.078]  Subconsciously, and so we're kind of rooting for nuclear war and the end of civilization.
[00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:09.172]  See, we have ancestral memories of struggle and of things being almost unsurvivable, and in that we find our greatest moments.
[00:24:11.813 --> 00:24:15.594]  But see, humans have a will to go into crisis.
[00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:19.295]  It's almost an ancient form of entertainment to have war or crisis.
[00:24:20.367 --> 00:24:21.247]  It's a bunch of drama.
[00:24:21.507 --> 00:24:23.628]  But you can't do that with airborne Ebola.
[00:24:23.928 --> 00:24:26.009]  You can't do that with airborne mousepox.
[00:24:26.369 --> 00:24:42.375]  You can't do that with hydrogen bombs and x-ray lasers and super neutron-based antimatter reactions.
[00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:46.077]  Oh, that's a highly classified weapons program you just heard about right there.
[00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:51.368]  Air Force slipped up and gave a briefing on it.
[00:24:51.608 --> 00:24:53.049]  San Francisco Chronicle 10 years ago.
[00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:53.449]  Look it up.
[00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.432]  And I brought that up to nuclear engineers.
[00:24:56.472 --> 00:24:57.493]  I know it worked in the Pentagon.
[00:24:57.533 --> 00:24:58.433]  They would turn white.
[00:25:00.235 --> 00:25:01.796]  And I would bring up the antimatter bombs.
[00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:05.058]  They've got weapons that will destroy the whole planet.
[00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:06.540]  Just like that.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.902]  In fact, they can't even test them, obviously.
[00:25:09.102 --> 00:25:13.245]  They don't know how much they would... You've seen Star Trek, one of the last episodes?
[00:25:13.265 --> 00:25:15.607]  You know, the new Star Trek movies?
[00:25:15.627 --> 00:25:16.648]  I think they're better than the old ones.
[00:25:17.844 --> 00:25:22.507]  Where they go and drop that dark matter into the center of Spock's planet and implodes?
[00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.109]  How about the whole solar system doing that?
[00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:26.670]  How about black hole weapons?
[00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:30.372]  They invented the equations for atomic weapons.
[00:25:30.492 --> 00:25:31.293]  Max Planck did in 1900.
[00:25:31.513 --> 00:25:34.955]  There it is.
[00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:37.677]  Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons.
[00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:39.038]  Program was touted publicly.
[00:25:39.478 --> 00:25:40.819]  Then came official gag order.
[00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:41.960]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:41.960]  2004.
[00:25:43.561 --> 00:25:44.542]  I said 10 years ago.
[00:25:44.842 --> 00:25:45.182]  Boom!
[00:25:45.222 --> 00:25:46.023]  Photographic memory.
[00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.232]  But only photographic, back to a certain point.
[00:25:51.252 --> 00:25:52.894]  It's not been photographic the last few years.
[00:25:53.234 --> 00:25:56.617]  Near photographic, if I'm focused, have the right nutrients, but I'm 40.
[00:25:56.677 --> 00:25:58.639]  You're not supposed to be able to have a photographic memory after really 30.
[00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:00.220]  Starts degrading.
[00:26:02.342 --> 00:26:03.423]  Just saying, I'm not making this stuff up.
[00:26:03.443 --> 00:26:05.524]  People hear me throw out facts, numbers, statistics.
[00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:06.885]  How does this guy know all this stuff?
[00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:07.606]  Yes, I do!
[00:26:08.507 --> 00:26:10.809]  Of course I know when they publish a thing about antimatter bombs.
[00:26:12.816 --> 00:26:14.297]  Who would not want to know that date?
[00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:16.339]  I'm not bragging here.
[00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:21.543]  I'm telling you that when Vladimir Putin says we have nuclear weapons, back off.
[00:26:22.723 --> 00:26:27.227]  That's what they did on 8-8-8 in August of 2008.
[00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:31.610]  Threatening.
[00:26:33.211 --> 00:26:33.772]  I wake up.
[00:26:35.993 --> 00:26:38.015]  My wife's like, hey, Russia has attacked.
[00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:39.116]  Russia has attacked Georgia.
[00:26:39.901 --> 00:26:41.363]  It's on the radio, she's in there cooking breakfast.
[00:26:41.803 --> 00:26:49.051]  I get up, I stumble out, go to the computer, go to CNN, turn it on, got coffee, stand there in my underwear, kids are grabbing on my legs and stuff.
[00:26:50.072 --> 00:26:50.933]  And I'm like, huh?
[00:26:51.814 --> 00:26:55.378]  Yeah, but they just invaded Georgia, nobody knows why, they're driving towards the Capitol.
[00:26:56.299 --> 00:27:00.103]  They had the president of the country on there saying, please help us.
[00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.692]  And I get ready, and all the news says Russia's attacked, and it took me until I was about 30 minutes into the show at 11.30.
[00:27:07.732 --> 00:27:11.334]  Took me about, I don't know, four or five hours.
[00:27:14.295 --> 00:27:14.915]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:27:14.995 --> 00:27:17.537]  Russia threatens nuclear attack on Poland over U.S.
[00:27:17.577 --> 00:27:18.117]  missile shield.
[00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:18.797]  London Telegraph.
[00:27:19.657 --> 00:27:21.098]  This is, that was a few years ago.
[00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:21.098]  2008.
[00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:23.599]  Print that for me.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:25.500]  Thank you.
[00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:35.980]  If you're a radio listener and wonder what's going on, we're also simulcasting on television at Infowars.com forward slash show and at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:36.561 --> 00:27:42.244]  And so as I say things, they Google it and pull up the headline so we can prove things for you.
[00:27:42.324 --> 00:27:53.792]  But back on 888, their chairman of their Joint Chiefs of Staff said, I am authorized to tell you that we're going to launch medium-range attacks on NATO bases in one hour.
[00:27:55.307 --> 00:28:00.990]  If the NATO aircraft landing and disgorging US and NATO forces do not pull out.
[00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:10.053]  The Russians landed in Serbia, in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
[00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:22.499]  When they were bringing in the Muslim forces and ethnically cleansing, they tried to take that Russian airbase, and the Russians landed and said, okay, we're preparing for nuclear war.
[00:28:26.673 --> 00:28:29.174]  And the head of NATO refused the order.
[00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:35.537]  The British head, I forget his name, General Jackson, I think it was General Jackson, refused the order.
[00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:39.338]  He said, I am not going to go down in history books as the guy that started World War III.
[00:28:39.758 --> 00:28:44.240]  Everyone knows the Russians don't ever threaten anything unless they're going to do it.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.281]  They've been all nice.
[00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:46.921]  Oh, please don't take our military bases.
[00:28:47.201 --> 00:28:48.202]  Please don't take our gas pipelines.
[00:28:48.462 --> 00:28:48.842]  Please.
[00:28:49.122 --> 00:28:50.303]  We'll work things out with the West.
[00:28:50.323 --> 00:28:52.423]  In fact, we'll even let you have 90% of the country.
[00:28:52.744 --> 00:28:53.004]  Fine.
[00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:54.244]  The EU can eat Ukraine.
[00:28:54.584 --> 00:28:55.485]  Don't move missiles in.
[00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:56.025]  Stop.
[00:28:56.565 --> 00:28:56.925]  Stop.
[00:28:57.206 --> 00:28:57.546]  Stop.
[00:28:57.846 --> 00:29:02.550]  CIA head goes there provocatively, commanding all these forces, attacking the Russian-held areas.
[00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.991]  I mean, what do you expect?
[00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:07.453]  I mean, Putin could be Hitler.
[00:29:08.434 --> 00:29:10.356]  It's Hitler with nuclear weapons, folks.
[00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:12.778]  But he's not Hitler.
[00:29:13.458 --> 00:29:17.721]  It's the globalists that are expanding and pushing and starting all this.
[00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:23.506]  And if you just joined us, Vladimir Putin has come out and said, don't mess with nuclear Russia.
[00:29:24.867 --> 00:29:26.849]  It's best for you not to mess with us.
[00:29:30.734 --> 00:29:36.260]  Putin spoke easily with students, many of whom looked to be asking scripted questions.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.963]  Oh, like our press conferences aren't scripted with Obama.
[00:29:39.123 --> 00:29:39.924]  Give me a break.
[00:29:40.685 --> 00:29:44.950]  Listen, if you're going to say those are scripted, say as ours are scripted.
[00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:48.670]  Because I tell you it's scripted here and it's scripted there.
[00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.570]  I'm sick of this.
[00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.490]  Oh my gosh.
[00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.631]  Russians torture people sometimes.
[00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:53.351]  Oh my gosh.
[00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:54.632]  But we never do that, right?
[00:29:54.672 --> 00:29:56.212]  And you don't spy on people either, right?
[00:29:56.432 --> 00:29:57.832]  I'm just sick of the hypocrisy.
[00:29:58.153 --> 00:29:58.873]  Sick of the fraud.
[00:29:58.893 --> 00:30:02.094]  And sick of you people trying to start World War III.
[00:30:02.114 --> 00:30:06.375]  Hey, Goldman Sachs had made 40 to 1 bets on people's money.
[00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:07.575]  These people are nuts!
[00:30:07.996 --> 00:30:08.916]  Wall Street's nuts!
[00:30:10.177 --> 00:30:16.146]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:16.346 --> 00:30:20.552]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:20.913 --> 00:30:25.480]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.502]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:28.802 --> 00:30:33.984]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:34.245 --> 00:30:41.128]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:41.629 --> 00:30:45.411]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:45.771 --> 00:30:50.553]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:50.893 --> 00:30:51.734]  This is innovating.
[00:30:52.014 --> 00:30:59.297]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:59.497 --> 00:31:03.559]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:26.329]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.850]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:42.917]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:43.077 --> 00:31:47.039]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:48.800]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:56.724]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:56.984 --> 00:31:57.825]  But for how long?
[00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:04.388]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:04.768 --> 00:32:07.590]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:15.940]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.202]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:18.383 --> 00:32:23.489]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:28.615]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:28.815 --> 00:32:31.876]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:32.136 --> 00:32:35.997]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:36.217 --> 00:32:40.458]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:40.538 --> 00:32:50.561]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:50.761 --> 00:32:53.282]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:32:53.882 --> 00:32:55.422]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:32:55.483 --> 00:32:55.823]  Inc.
[00:32:55.843 --> 00:32:56.683]  NORAD has declared DEF CON 3.
[00:32:56.723 --> 00:32:57.883]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:32:57.943 --> 00:32:59.283]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:33:19.548 --> 00:33:23.109]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.510]  Target selection complete.
[00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.411]  Time on target sequence complete.
[00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:34.314]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:33:34.594 --> 00:33:40.276]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:33:40.456 --> 00:33:46.818]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:33:46.878 --> 00:33:48.239]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:33:50.673 --> 00:33:52.934]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:33:52.954 --> 00:33:53.574]  You bet!
[00:33:54.055 --> 00:33:58.216]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:58.376 --> 00:34:01.318]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:34:01.338 --> 00:34:03.879]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:08.681]  Shall we play a game?
[00:34:08.881 --> 00:34:09.441]  No doubt.
[00:34:14.776 --> 00:34:19.298]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:19.618 --> 00:34:21.639]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:22.760]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.661]  We are in launch mode.
[00:34:25.121 --> 00:34:28.642]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:34:29.063 --> 00:34:32.964]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:34:33.424 --> 00:34:33.725]  We're in!
[00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:36.265]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:34:36.686 --> 00:34:38.866]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[00:34:39.226 --> 00:34:40.887]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:50.189]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:55.691]  The only winning move is not to play.
[00:34:58.492 --> 00:35:02.713]  That's the bottom line that we're discussing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:17.001]  And the headline at Infowars.com reads, from Reuters, don't mess with nuclear Russia, Putin says.
[00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:23.465]  He goes on to say that anyone that engages any of our military forces
[00:35:24.997 --> 00:35:28.300]  We'll be responded to with our full military might.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.022]  You can read the full quotes up on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:31.422 --> 00:35:31.903]  Breaking!
[00:35:31.983 --> 00:35:34.745]  Putin says don't mess with nuclear Russia.
[00:35:35.646 --> 00:35:39.569]  The video is going up in real time right now.
[00:35:43.873 --> 00:35:48.316]  Now it's in Russian, but I'm going to go ahead and play some of this now.
[00:35:48.676 --> 00:35:51.539]  This just broke in the last 30 minutes.
[00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:53.200]  This was released by RT.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:53.961]  Here it is.
[00:35:55.117 --> 00:35:56.058]  Mr. Putin, good afternoon.
[00:35:56.078 --> 00:35:57.780]  My name is Mr. Makariko, and I'm from St.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.182]  Petersburg Polytechnical University.
[00:35:59.202 --> 00:36:01.825]  I'd like to express a big thanks for your visit to Seliger.
[00:36:17.537 --> 00:36:29.622]  Mr. Putin, it's an educational forum, but of course we follow the developments that are happening around the world and some of the events are linked to Ukraine.
[00:36:29.662 --> 00:36:33.003]  You met with President Poroshenko in Minsk and Mr. Lavrov also told us about
[00:36:41.027 --> 00:36:50.532]  Sending another humanitarian convoy and also the militia announced that they will continue their military operation.
[00:36:51.112 --> 00:36:58.856]  We also asked the militia to provide a humanitarian corridor to avoid bloodshed.
[00:36:58.996 --> 00:37:03.098]  There were also media reports about possible tougher sanctions.
[00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:04.619]  Also Russian servicemen were
[00:37:09.922 --> 00:37:13.765]  Reportedly detained on the territory of Ukraine.
[00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:19.948]  Could you give us your take on the situation and what are the future developments in your view?
[00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:20.609]  Thank you.
[00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:23.571]  So let's start with our servicemen.
[00:37:23.591 --> 00:37:24.611]  I made a statement about that.
[00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:24.912]  You know,
[00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:36.467]  Ukrainian servicemen also found themselves on the Russian territory, and in larger numbers.
[00:37:36.727 --> 00:37:50.331]  Once we had 450 servicemen, then we had another 60, and another 16, many of them with arms, and some of them, they went to Russia and just said, you know, we were lost.
[00:37:50.751 --> 00:37:56.293]  But what we saw was that they were with armored vehicles.
[00:37:56.973 --> 00:38:00.416]  Well, I do believe that they got lost.
[00:38:00.456 --> 00:38:07.781]  We don't have a clear demarcation in some of the areas.
[00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:10.963]  I think it's a purely technical issue.
[00:38:11.023 --> 00:38:21.051]  We discussed that with the President of Ukraine, Mr. Poroshenko, and he assured me that the Russian soldiers will be handed over to Russia, just like Russia.
[00:38:21.911 --> 00:38:28.753]  This is a two and a half hour video.
[00:38:28.793 --> 00:38:31.373]  That's why it was just released in the last 30 minutes or so.
[00:38:31.713 --> 00:38:34.954]  That's why no major media yet has the specific quotes.
[00:38:34.994 --> 00:38:37.574]  We have the text released by RT.
[00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:39.475]  We've got our guys reviewing it right now.
[00:38:40.755 --> 00:38:47.597]  We will go through this and get to the part where he talks about don't mess with Russia and we'll retaliate and the rest of it.
[00:38:48.077 --> 00:38:49.077]  But the full transcript
[00:38:50.293 --> 00:38:55.456]  is on InfoWars.com and the video is posted there as well.
[00:38:55.476 --> 00:39:01.659]  We're going to post it separately with the word video in the headline so folks can see that if they want.
[00:39:02.719 --> 00:39:07.021]  But no one's perfect in this whole thing.
[00:39:07.081 --> 00:39:11.984]  Russia has done a lot of bad things to Ukraine, but part of Ukraine has been part of Russia basically forever.
[00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:17.248]  The Western Ukrainians have done a lot of bad stuff to Eastern Ukrainians.
[00:39:17.408 --> 00:39:21.654]  We're not in the middle as Americans in their tribal sectarian warfare.
[00:39:22.074 --> 00:39:28.403]  The EU is in there manipulating things to consolidate power and control.
[00:39:30.686 --> 00:39:31.407]  That's what's happening.
[00:39:33.433 --> 00:39:35.074]  And they want to suck that country dry.
[00:39:35.294 --> 00:39:44.938]  That's why they ethnically want to bring in groups and then hype them up racially into the United States, not to assimilate, but to be their own group attached to the Democratic Party.
[00:39:45.238 --> 00:39:46.658]  That's race-based politics.
[00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:50.140]  The Democrats did that and ran the country for over 100 years with the Klan.
[00:39:51.428 --> 00:40:02.832]  When Christian Republicans wouldn't go along with it, with Martin Luther King and others that were Republicans, and I'm not saying Republicans are perfect, they're part of the corrupt political class, the Democrats switched to racial politics with minorities.
[00:40:03.632 --> 00:40:05.913]  And now they've brought in a majority of minorities.
[00:40:06.473 --> 00:40:10.475]  If there was one white person huddling in a corner about to be shot in the head, that'd be a majority.
[00:40:11.775 --> 00:40:14.856]  So this is how the political correctness works, race-based politics.
[00:40:16.317 --> 00:40:18.798]  But they've gotten rid of the population's immune system
[00:40:20.455 --> 00:40:24.616]  To this form of manipulation to where we just accept anything.
[00:40:24.996 --> 00:40:29.537]  Except Obamacare, a giant criminal operation that big corporations are exempt from.
[00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:30.797]  That's illegal.
[00:40:31.397 --> 00:40:36.698]  And it raises taxes on poor people or you're against black people because Obama's black and he couldn't do anything wrong.
[00:40:40.439 --> 00:40:46.600]  This is how the system operates and you've got incredible war propaganda
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.781]  What's going on right now?
[00:40:50.101 --> 00:41:03.756]  Here's the headline in the London Telegraph from 2008, a few days after 888, when Georgia launched an attack on Russian-held areas of Avkazia and South Ossetia that have been Russian enclaves forever.
[00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:08.612]  Russia threatens nuclear attack on Poland over U.S.
[00:41:08.652 --> 00:41:09.292]  missile shield.
[00:41:09.352 --> 00:41:16.935]  Russia threatened a nuclear strike against Poland after a landmark deal to cite American global anti-missile shields in its country.
[00:41:16.955 --> 00:41:26.739]  Because what they really are, and what the Pentagon admits they are, is a system to where you can launch a nuclear attack on Russia, they try to launch a response, and the missiles shoot that down.
[00:41:28.814 --> 00:41:32.955]  And they talk to us like children and go, no, it's to shoot down missiles if Russia shoots first.
[00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:33.915]  Of course!
[00:41:34.755 --> 00:41:39.176]  But it's an escalation because you can hit Russia and then they can't respond back.
[00:41:40.616 --> 00:41:45.257]  So it's a major act of war to bring anti-missile systems up to somebody's border.
[00:41:45.277 --> 00:41:49.698]  Can you imagine if Russians in Canada and Mexico were stationing these?
[00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:53.439]  The United States would hit the targets.
[00:41:55.199 --> 00:41:57.580]  We have found the clip of Putin
[00:41:59.212 --> 00:42:02.274]  Talking about the response to the situation in Ukraine.
[00:42:02.794 --> 00:42:06.416]  So here it is from the two and a half hour meeting.
[00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:13.721]  We're going to play this clip, then we're going to get this clip and excise it out for folks and put it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:22.406]  But here it is, Vladimir Putin telling NATO, the West, George Soros and the rest of them, love them or hate them, they've got the nuclear weapons.
[00:42:23.227 --> 00:42:25.328]  Do not push us, don't mess with Russia.
[00:42:25.868 --> 00:42:26.469]  Here is the clip.
[00:42:28.656 --> 00:42:38.706]  Historical memory is a very important component of our culture, our history, our life today.
[00:42:38.746 --> 00:42:46.954]  And of course we should also consider the future based on our historical experience and our historical memory.
[00:42:46.994 --> 00:42:48.656]  So I can tell you straight away that
[00:42:49.116 --> 00:42:53.317]  Russia is far from being involved in large-scale conflicts.
[00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.118]  We don't want that, and we're not going to do that.
[00:42:56.178 --> 00:43:04.401]  Of course, we should always be ready to repel any aggression, any attack on Russia.
[00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:16.265]  Regardless of the situation our partners' nations are in, they should always realize that they would be better off not messaging us, talking about the possible
[00:43:19.906 --> 00:43:25.909]  I don't think anybody seriously considers the possibility of starting a military conflict with Russia.
[00:43:25.949 --> 00:43:31.831]  I would like to remind you that Russia is one of the biggest nuclear powers.
[00:43:31.931 --> 00:43:37.133]  In other words, this is real and we actually strengthen our nuclear forces.
[00:43:37.213 --> 00:43:41.955]  They are more compact now, but they're also more efficient.
[00:43:42.595 --> 00:43:43.935]  They're more modern.
[00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:48.277]  They have modern weaponry.
[00:43:48.817 --> 00:43:52.038]  And we continue to boost their potential.
[00:43:52.058 --> 00:43:54.719]  We are going to do this in the future as well.
[00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:57.479]  This is not to threaten anybody.
[00:43:57.499 --> 00:44:06.322]  This is just for us to feel protected and be able to implement our economic and social plans.
[00:44:06.682 --> 00:44:10.183]  As far as cycles are concerned, yes, I think that
[00:44:11.583 --> 00:44:16.445]  Global development is cyclical, primarily, I think, because the economy develops in cycles, and this has been proven.
[00:44:16.465 --> 00:44:21.227]  If we have any economists present here... There it is in context.
[00:44:37.932 --> 00:44:39.392]  There's the audio, there's the video.
[00:44:39.452 --> 00:44:40.653]  We'll get that clip.
[00:44:41.153 --> 00:44:44.533]  We'll have it up on InfoWars.com, up on YouTube in the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:44:44.853 --> 00:44:51.455]  We have the full two-plus hours up, but we're going to have that for everybody updated to InfoWars.com.
[00:44:52.255 --> 00:44:59.416]  We're going to get that posted on one of our YouTube channels right now for everybody else as well, if you're a radio listener.
[00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.197]  We do have Ray McGovern.
[00:45:03.356 --> 00:45:20.091]  Former top CIA briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, who was on with us on August 15th, two weeks ago, warning, a little less than two weeks ago, that this could lead to nuclear war, and that it's a very real threat.
[00:45:21.092 --> 00:45:29.060]  Every major analyst I talk to, people formerly in defense intelligence, CIA, professors, on and off air,
[00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:42.801]  And all the trade publications I read, military publications, Pentagon statements, I mean, this is a real push up into the border of Russia.
[00:45:44.522 --> 00:45:57.148]  And if NATO troops start engaging Russian troops who feel like they're in their interest with their military bases, their pipelines, when they're trying to cut Russia off from Europe, which will hurt Europe big time as well,
[00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:06.386]  This isn't America where Obama just gets to shut down a third of our power plants and double, on average, our electricity prices in seven years.
[00:46:06.686 --> 00:46:13.330]  This isn't America where they get to pass a healthcare law that raises seven taxes on poor people with death panels and death panels at the VA.
[00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:19.333]  This is Russia we're talking about that has its own set of problems.
[00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:23.889]  But their public is more informed, on average.
[00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:24.949]  You can look at the studies on that.
[00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:26.811]  They know geographically what's going on.
[00:46:27.111 --> 00:46:27.812]  They understand it.
[00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:30.894]  They have the memory of 20 million Russians dying in World War II.
[00:46:33.096 --> 00:46:34.197]  The Germans have it as well.
[00:46:34.797 --> 00:46:36.138]  20 million Germans died.
[00:46:37.179 --> 00:46:39.341]  Only 5-6 million of those were troops.
[00:46:40.482 --> 00:46:42.243]  So, governments do this.
[00:46:42.323 --> 00:46:44.005]  They make decisions, they do things.
[00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:48.889]  Tens of millions died overall from war and famine in the Napoleonic Wars, all three rounds.
[00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:52.652]  And people never think it's going to happen until it happens.
[00:46:52.692 --> 00:46:54.373]  And this time, there's nuclear weapons.
[00:46:54.613 --> 00:46:55.533]  I believe the Bible.
[00:46:56.214 --> 00:47:00.195]  But I don't believe the establishment interpretations of it where we all get raptured out of this.
[00:47:00.255 --> 00:47:03.176]  No, it says the beast wages war on the saints and overcomes them.
[00:47:03.617 --> 00:47:04.637]  Then there's a big revival.
[00:47:04.677 --> 00:47:05.958]  People wake up and start repenting.
[00:47:06.438 --> 00:47:07.798]  There's awakening around the world.
[00:47:09.879 --> 00:47:11.660]  One third of the earth's population is killed.
[00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:16.302]  Large portions of the Earth's surface are black.
[00:47:16.422 --> 00:47:17.703]  That's what the Bible says.
[00:47:18.144 --> 00:47:20.445]  Columns of flame bigger than mountains.
[00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:24.488]  Giant machines that look like insects.
[00:47:25.789 --> 00:47:27.710]  Flying around dropping fire on people.
[00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.212]  This is what John on the Isle of Patmos saw.
[00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:35.095]  And hey, even if you don't believe in God or the collective consciousness or anything,
[00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:37.406]  Doesn't matter, boy, a lot of that's coming true.
[00:47:37.747 --> 00:47:57.923]  And it isn't what these preachers tell you, who think they're big mega-churches, protect them from nuclear weapons, while they're little CIA, FBI, auxiliary officers writing dossiers, you know, up late at night on their churchgoers, and, you know, which family they're going to break up, and how they're going to get people's money, and, you know, I mean, these are savage operations.
[00:47:59.124 --> 00:48:02.545]  We're just a bunch of gullible Americans just believing anything.
[00:48:02.805 --> 00:48:04.366]  Oh, we got a great country!
[00:48:04.586 --> 00:48:05.766]  We're the greatest in the world!
[00:48:06.026 --> 00:48:06.687]  We're perfect!
[00:48:06.907 --> 00:48:08.087]  We can do no wrong!
[00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:09.128]  Blah, blah, blah!
[00:48:10.488 --> 00:48:13.509]  We are hijacked just like France was by the Nazis.
[00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:19.231]  Our government is a bunch of collaborators with offshore banks who literally are running us into the ground.
[00:48:21.572 --> 00:48:24.793]  Russia goes, you want to cut our pipelines off with our contracts?
[00:48:25.173 --> 00:48:27.334]  Where we sell the cheapest gas in the world to Europe?
[00:48:29.935 --> 00:48:32.037]  You want to be able to drive up prices on people worldwide?
[00:48:32.097 --> 00:48:32.297]  No.
[00:48:33.518 --> 00:48:34.519]  We're going to be competitive.
[00:48:35.539 --> 00:48:54.534]  And the globalists, and the Rothschilds, and the Dutch royalty, and the British royalty, and all the rest of them that are driving this, they went, we're coming into eastern Ukraine, we're taking over your oil fields and your gas fields that you developed and you got leases on, and your pipelines that come out of Russia, and those rich gas fields over the border, and we're going to give it to Joe Biden's son.
[00:48:55.592 --> 00:48:59.733]  We're going to give some of the stock to the British Royal Family, some of the Dutch, we're going to give Obama some.
[00:49:00.193 --> 00:49:03.174]  Joe Biden's son, you get $2 billion out.
[00:49:03.194 --> 00:49:04.354]  $2 billion worth!
[00:49:04.394 --> 00:49:05.094]  How's that sound?
[00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:09.455]  Biden comes out and goes, I'm proud my son is a good businessman.
[00:49:09.535 --> 00:49:09.715]  Yeah.
[00:49:11.136 --> 00:49:16.337]  The Russians are literally watching Joe Biden's son take over their gas.
[00:49:18.717 --> 00:49:20.718]  So they've sent in special forces to protect it.
[00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.251]  And they're getting killed right now fighting mercenaries in the CIA.
[00:49:26.352 --> 00:49:27.012]  And there's U.S.
[00:49:27.032 --> 00:49:28.253]  troops getting killed over there right now.
[00:49:28.293 --> 00:49:28.833]  You better believe it.
[00:49:30.174 --> 00:49:33.695]  So Putin goes over there and plays the game of, we've got a few soldiers over there.
[00:49:34.356 --> 00:49:36.077]  And notice all the kids laugh.
[00:49:36.157 --> 00:49:41.419]  They all understand that Americans get told, there's no 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.701]  No, they know it equals 4.
[00:49:44.761 --> 00:49:46.782]  So Putin's like, we have a few soldiers.
[00:49:46.822 --> 00:49:47.702]  Some of them got picked up.
[00:49:48.102 --> 00:49:49.023]  But they're going to be released.
[00:49:51.923 --> 00:49:54.484]  Playing along with, because they're giving us our own response.
[00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:59.487]  Oh, there's no CIA or mercenaries attacking eastern Ukraine.
[00:49:59.748 --> 00:50:00.328]  Oh, no.
[00:50:00.608 --> 00:50:02.889]  And Putin's like, oh, and there's none of our troops either.
[00:50:02.969 --> 00:50:03.770]  Yes.
[00:50:05.951 --> 00:50:08.453]  And he goes, and this is not a threat, but we have nuclear weapons.
[00:50:08.733 --> 00:50:10.534]  That was, this is a threat.
[00:50:10.994 --> 00:50:15.917]  And you watch, within hours, his generals will come out and threaten to nuke Europe and the United States.
[00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:20.695]  And remember who runs things.
[00:50:21.335 --> 00:50:27.860]  We got Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others with people like John Corzine, who would make 40 to 1 bets with private bank accounts.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.082]  He bought a subsidiary bank.
[00:50:31.723 --> 00:50:34.405]  And then most people didn't get their money back for two plus years.
[00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.026]  And he didn't get in trouble.
[00:50:37.107 --> 00:50:42.771]  That's how reckless and... Let me tell you, the elite are just like Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay, but a few steps up and worse.
[00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:47.296]  You want to put the whole world in the hands of Bernie Madoff and Ken Lay?
[00:50:47.856 --> 00:50:49.277]  And the Weirdo Queen of England?
[00:50:49.537 --> 00:50:55.761]  And those freaks that want to start a nuclear war because they got underground bunkers and they're bored?
[00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:57.822]  Bunch of nihilistic scum!
[00:50:58.222 --> 00:50:59.943]  We're going to take your phone calls coming up.
[00:51:00.784 --> 00:51:02.845]  We got Ray McGovern on, but we're going to be taking your calls.
[00:51:02.905 --> 00:51:04.186]  I want to hear from people about this.
[00:51:04.206 --> 00:51:04.726]  Am I wrong?
[00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:06.347]  Should we want nuclear war?
[00:51:06.587 --> 00:51:07.848]  Fight fire with fire!
[00:51:08.068 --> 00:51:09.109]  Fight fire with fire!

[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.421]  Recent events have shown just how vulnerable we are to deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:53:13.622 --> 00:53:19.083]  These diseases are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[00:53:19.423 --> 00:53:23.244]  Now, more than ever, there's a great need for a product that will help protect us.
[00:53:23.584 --> 00:53:24.444]  Look no further.
[00:53:24.825 --> 00:53:29.626]  Supernatural Silver can provide immune system support to help fight off these deadly pathogens.
[00:53:30.266 --> 00:53:41.038]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that's safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast.
[00:53:41.419 --> 00:53:45.043]  Supernatural Silver can be taken orally or used topically and can be used
[00:53:45.043 --> 00:53:45.283]  I think so.
[00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:10.191]  The end.
[00:54:38.044 --> 00:54:39.966]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:40.967 --> 00:54:44.730]  The toll-free number to join us here today is 800-259-9231.
[00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:45.511]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:46.152 --> 00:55:00.385]  Now, our loving government, run by foreign banks, has been funding Al-Qaeda and changing their name to confuse the public and then having fake airstrikes on them while they turn the Middle East over to them.
[00:55:01.391 --> 00:55:09.578]  And while they overthrow all our previous allies, because they're not America haters, and while the destabilization goes on in Africa as well, our border is completely being dissolved.
[00:55:09.958 --> 00:55:20.387]  Obama, it's in the Associated Press, is set by the end of the month, he said he'd do it by the end of August, I guess that means the next two days, to sign an executive order bypassing Congress.
[00:55:20.728 --> 00:55:23.050]  You may have heard that two days ago on the carbon tax.
[00:55:24.224 --> 00:55:26.988]  I'm going to be covering that some on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:28.730]  Just, hey, I'm king.
[00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:30.252]  I'm just going to do it.
[00:55:30.292 --> 00:55:36.721]  In fact, now he's doing government by not even executive order, but just saying, I told the department head.
[00:55:37.142 --> 00:55:38.804]  So there's not even a memo or a piece of paper.
[00:55:39.525 --> 00:55:47.829]  There's a piece of paper when a cop gives you a ticket, where it was, where the street was, the court, the law, the fine.
[00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:58.535]  But when you shut down the power plants and get ready to put taxes on every mile you drive, with satellite tracker boxes in all the cars, lined up beforehand, getting you ready for it.
[00:56:00.296 --> 00:56:04.558]  Oh, when that's going on, the feds have come out,
[00:56:06.477 --> 00:56:13.823]  After this article two days ago from CNS News, Feds move to require car-to-car safety communication, which will tax you by the mile.
[00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:18.227]  Feds deny vehicle-to-vehicle communications.
[00:56:18.647 --> 00:56:20.709]  Tech will be used to spy on drivers.
[00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:24.412]  Basic safety message to broadcast GPS signal.
[00:56:25.053 --> 00:56:26.954]  Totally ridiculous, folks.
[00:56:27.235 --> 00:56:34.701]  That's right, and the NSA's not spying on you, and if you've got a business, you didn't build it, and on and on and on.
[00:56:37.383 --> 00:56:44.206]  This is just beyond insane, and the whole Republican leadership is working with the crazies that run Wall Street.
[00:56:44.646 --> 00:56:51.868]  That doesn't mean your average brokerage house, your average stock, the big megabanks, the high-frequency traders, the people that have rigged the market.
[00:56:52.189 --> 00:56:54.029]  How long did I tell you it was rigged with experts?
[00:56:54.289 --> 00:56:58.531]  And then Rolling Stone last year, or two years ago, the whole game's rigged.
[00:57:00.179 --> 00:57:02.981]  The stock market, the interest rates, everything.
[00:57:03.241 --> 00:57:08.424]  The top echelon is basically exempt, has all the info, runs the markets.
[00:57:09.965 --> 00:57:11.465]  What are you going to tell us next, Alex?
[00:57:11.505 --> 00:57:15.288]  That Las Vegas casinos are rigged in favor of the house?
[00:57:17.629 --> 00:57:21.971]  Next you're going to tell me H2O stands for dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:57:25.026 --> 00:57:25.586]  That's water.
[00:57:26.427 --> 00:57:37.191]  You know, I've gone on the streets of Austin and 9 out of 10 people, it was actually more than that, we talked to like 20 people, until one of them knew that we were saying, we want to ban the hydrogen monoxide.
[00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:38.771]  It's in everything.
[00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:41.252]  It causes excess urination.
[00:57:41.272 --> 00:57:41.893]  We want to ban it.
[00:57:42.513 --> 00:57:43.353]  And the people would sign.
[00:57:43.373 --> 00:57:44.514]  They would go, oh, I'm an engineer.
[00:57:44.554 --> 00:57:45.574]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:57:46.474 --> 00:57:47.655]  Start hitting on Lee and McAdoo.
[00:57:47.735 --> 00:57:50.216]  One guy in the video was like, yeah, I went to
[00:57:51.327 --> 00:57:52.248]  Princeton or something.
[00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:53.068]  Yeah, I'm an engineer.
[00:57:53.128 --> 00:57:53.929]  How you doing, baby?
[00:57:54.769 --> 00:57:55.810]  Yeah, I'll ban water.
[00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:56.230]  Sure.
[00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:58.171]  That's why they think we're so dumb.
[00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:04.155]  I mean, because 9 out of 10 Americans will ban water because they don't know the scientific name.
[00:58:04.635 --> 00:58:07.937]  Just like they'll ban salt if you give them a scientific name.
[00:58:09.878 --> 00:58:10.979]  And I'm not even that smart!
[00:58:11.039 --> 00:58:13.520]  That's what's frustrating about this is, it's crazy!
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.341]  They're trying to start nuclear war with Russia!
[00:58:15.561 --> 00:58:22.585]  We're gonna break it down with the former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, their favorite morning briefer.
[00:58:23.565 --> 00:58:24.806]  Ray McGovern, coming up!
[00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:31.683]  Don't forget, while we're all still here, it's important to support the independent free media that's under attack.

[00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.531]  I want to be patriotic.
[00:58:56.551 --> 00:58:57.811]  I think we need to have nuclear war with Russia.
[00:58:57.831 --> 00:58:58.491]  That's a smart move.
[00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:07.133]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:59:29.377 --> 00:59:33.758]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:59:34.038 --> 00:59:38.660]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.800]  Talk about the effects.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.601]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:59:41.621 --> 00:59:43.282]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:59:43.562 --> 00:59:44.603]  I feel like I look better.
[00:59:44.663 --> 00:59:45.304]  I feel better.
[00:59:45.324 --> 00:59:46.484]  I feel sexier.
[00:59:46.785 --> 00:59:47.145]  I love it.
[00:59:47.405 --> 00:59:50.327]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:53.129]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:54.370]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:55.450]  Consult your physician.

[00:59:57.812 --> 00:59:58.913]  This is life changing.
[01:00:02.675 --> 01:00:04.596]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.057 --> 01:00:07.899]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.734 --> 01:00:16.354]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:18.055]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.795 --> 01:00:19.895]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.556 --> 01:00:21.356]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.116 --> 01:00:23.056]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.677 --> 01:00:27.298]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.878 --> 01:00:31.959]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.000]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:39.262]  The globalists like to dumb stuff down to war on terror or countdown to meltdown.
[01:00:41.837 --> 01:00:42.717]  Here's the real headline.
[01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:51.321]  Western forces battle Russian forces over control of Russian oil and gas infrastructure.
[01:00:53.102 --> 01:00:53.902]  That's what's going on.
[01:00:55.263 --> 01:01:02.826]  And so our media goes, oh no, there's no forces or NATO, even though they're admittedly there fighting with Russians.
[01:01:02.846 --> 01:01:05.067]  And the Russians are like, oh, there's no, no, we're not either.
[01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:12.779]  But if you attack our forces openly or come up and attack Russian forces that are inside Russia, we've got nuclear weapons.
[01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:16.000]  That is such a huge escalation.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.241]  Putin putting nuclear weapons on the table.
[01:01:18.761 --> 01:01:21.762]  The video is up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:01:24.763 --> 01:01:25.244]  Video.
[01:01:25.924 --> 01:01:27.985]  Nuclear Putin says don't mess with Russia.
[01:01:28.245 --> 01:01:34.447]  We have the two hour thirty minute video up there of his full meet and greet and talking to college students and youth groups.
[01:01:35.816 --> 01:01:38.857]  But before we... I mean, that's important.
[01:01:39.017 --> 01:01:40.218]  You guys found the timecode.
[01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:44.400]  We should probably go note in our article where the timecode is so folks can skip ahead to that.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:54.805]  And then we're going to excise out the very video for other news sites and people that probably want it and have that up on Infowars.com the next 20-30 minutes.
[01:01:55.425 --> 01:01:57.246]  Buckley in there working on it right now, doing a great job.
[01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:06.880]  Man, let's go to one call before Ray McGovern comes on, and at the bottom of the hour, I will go to Chris, Will, Chris, John, and others.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.182]  Let's go to Greg in Arizona in this short segment.
[01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:11.343]  What's your take on this?
[01:02:11.403 --> 01:02:26.895]  I mean, I guess I'm supposed to be patriotic and do what the occupied government says and support stealing the Russian oil and gas infrastructure that they built in eastern Ukraine, that they have contracts on, and I should support the ethnic cleansing of the Russian majority there.
[01:02:28.055 --> 01:02:32.857]  Hi Alex, I'm from Lake Havasu City, Arizona and I'm a first time caller.
[01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:33.097]  I've been
[01:02:57.481 --> 01:03:00.383]  Listening to your show for, oh geez, over a year.
[01:03:00.403 --> 01:03:02.764]  I've been calling in this first time I actually got through.
[01:03:02.784 --> 01:03:08.828]  I think it's a disgrace what we're doing over there and what's going on.
[01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:12.270]  And I think it's all funded by the Bilderbergs and all these people.
[01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:13.351]  Oh, it definitely is.
[01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.232]  Bilderberg has been saying they're going to take down Russia.
[01:03:15.552 --> 01:03:16.773]  And it's not that Russia's great.
[01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.394]  It's just that they're not starting anything.
[01:03:18.414 --> 01:03:22.517]  It's like, if I don't even like my neighbor, I can't go over and punch him in the nose or take his car.
[01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:26.447]  And then if he comes out and fights me for it, oh, you're fighting me!
[01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:29.187]  I just overthrew the Ukrainian government and started a war with you!
[01:03:29.487 --> 01:03:30.647]  I'm moving missiles up to your borders!
[01:03:30.847 --> 01:03:32.408]  How dare you not love me?
[01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:33.428]  How dare you?
[01:03:33.888 --> 01:03:36.429]  And again, you're saying a disgrace.
[01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:39.269]  Look at how our so-called government's funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:41.250]  Go ahead.
[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.630]  It's ridiculous.
[01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.231]  And as far as, what's his face?
[01:03:46.271 --> 01:03:48.731]  The guy that's come over here to ruin our country.
[01:03:49.691 --> 01:03:50.171]  Soros?
[01:03:51.232 --> 01:03:51.672]  Soros.
[01:03:51.692 --> 01:03:52.652]  The Nazi collaborator?
[01:03:53.666 --> 01:03:53.826]  Yeah.
[01:03:54.207 --> 01:03:57.430]  How did he get away with staying in our country and doing all this stuff?
[01:03:57.891 --> 01:04:02.096]  Well, I mean, he would hunt down Jews that were hiding.
[01:04:02.116 --> 01:04:04.138]  He knew where they would hide and how they'd hide their money.
[01:04:04.178 --> 01:04:07.442]  And then he transferred it to the Nazis and he got a big nest egg out of it.
[01:04:08.775 --> 01:04:14.500]  I mean, look, if you're Schwarzenegger and say you love Hitler on video, you get an ADL award.
[01:04:15.081 --> 01:04:19.825]  If you actually helped hunt down Jews en masse, you get worshipped by the ADLs.
[01:04:20.305 --> 01:04:22.447]  But if you fight Nazis, you get demonized by them.
[01:04:22.888 --> 01:04:24.129]  And the ADL attacks me.
[01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.732]  MSNBC says I'm deeply racist and shows no proof.
[01:04:27.752 --> 01:04:29.914]  2 plus 2 equals 5, bro!
[01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:30.614]  You didn't know that?
[01:04:31.755 --> 01:04:34.458]  Yeah, he does live in America, right?
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:42.096]  He sure does, but no, they're always hunting some fake old man Nazi jail guard, and it never turns out to actually be a Nazi jail guard.
[01:04:42.887 --> 01:04:47.988]  It's always some Eastern European, you know, who can't prove anything and is like 92 and can't talk.
[01:04:48.308 --> 01:04:51.069]  And they'll roll out some deaf man and go, he's a Nazi!
[01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:52.549]  Look, we're hunting him down!
[01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:55.310]  When they brought 36,000 Nazis to the U.S.
[01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:59.811]  to run the universities, the government, NASA, everything!
[01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:01.271]  Everything!
[01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:06.353]  Look, we found a 94-year-old blind guy who we called us a Nazi!
[01:05:06.673 --> 01:05:07.513]  Oh yeah, right!
[01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:13.565]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:13.725 --> 01:05:17.687]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:18.007 --> 01:05:19.468]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:19.788 --> 01:05:24.811]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[01:06:09.756 --> 01:06:15.858]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:06:16.158 --> 01:06:18.621]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:06:18.661 --> 01:06:25.427]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:06:25.707 --> 01:06:28.570]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.633]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:06:31.733 --> 01:06:33.655]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:06:33.675 --> 01:06:36.458]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:06:36.578 --> 01:06:42.102]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:06:42.322 --> 01:06:45.805]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:06:45.825 --> 01:06:48.807]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:25.159]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:25.559 --> 01:07:28.181]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:28.482 --> 01:07:33.666]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:40.811]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:07:41.311 --> 01:07:45.094]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:07:45.454 --> 01:07:50.238]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:50.558 --> 01:07:58.984]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:08:10.693 --> 01:08:18.199]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:08:19.241 --> 01:08:27.249]  Have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action and reply.
[01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:34.916]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:08:35.036 --> 01:08:38.320]  He still has the gun.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.081]  The gun is pointed at him at this moment.
[01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:42.924]  Take a hold of this bomb and break it if you have to.
[01:08:50.289 --> 01:08:57.773]  People calling themselves members of the Weather Underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[01:08:57.873 --> 01:09:02.436]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold floor.
[01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:11.141]  Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgement that the Israeli Air Force bombed a U.S.
[01:09:11.401 --> 01:09:12.482]  intelligence Navy ship.
[01:09:12.722 --> 01:09:18.404]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[01:09:18.424 --> 01:09:21.726]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S.
[01:09:21.806 --> 01:09:22.446]  helicopter.
[01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:26.988]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are U.S.
[01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:27.788]  Navy SEALs.
[01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:35.452]  There may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next war.
[01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:40.234]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between,
[01:09:40.854 --> 01:09:42.374]  It's that we all hated the bank bailout.
[01:09:42.734 --> 01:09:47.215]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:51.416]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:09:51.536 --> 01:09:57.437]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[01:09:57.457 --> 01:10:02.638]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:10:02.918 --> 01:10:04.578]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:05.819]  I'm here to warn people!
[01:10:05.839 --> 01:10:07.059]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[01:10:07.379 --> 01:10:08.219]  This isn't a game!
[01:10:10.694 --> 01:10:15.756]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:17.725 --> 01:10:19.566]  We're now well into the second hour.
[01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:30.009]  We aired the false flag intro there to point out that most wars, or escalations of wars, are launched by staged provocations by the Russians, the Nazis, the U.S.
[01:10:30.049 --> 01:10:30.409]  government.
[01:10:30.909 --> 01:10:32.890]  This is something done since the times of the Romans.
[01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:36.951]  Ray McGovern has graciously come on on short notice because of the global crisis.
[01:10:37.471 --> 01:10:40.912]  I could not think of a better guest to have on concerning this.
[01:10:41.212 --> 01:10:43.433]  Just two weeks ago, we played the clip yesterday,
[01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.475]  He broke down how this could lead to nuclear war.
[01:10:46.555 --> 01:10:52.801]  I wanted to be able to flesh that out a little bit better today because we were up against a time constraint and he had to go.
[01:10:53.722 --> 01:10:54.983]  So I want to be able to get into more detail.
[01:10:56.325 --> 01:11:01.870]  He's a native of New York, Washington, is the early 60s, is an Army Infantry Intelligence Officer.
[01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:06.654]  He served as a CIA analyst for the administration of John F. Kennedy to that of George H.W.
[01:11:06.714 --> 01:11:06.935]  Bush.
[01:11:08.146 --> 01:11:16.010]  Ray briefed one-on-one President Ronald Reagan, most senior national security advisor from 81 to 85, was one of their favorite morning briefers.
[01:11:16.331 --> 01:11:18.412]  Point is, he knows what he's talking about in a wide spectrum.
[01:11:18.892 --> 01:11:25.395]  Fluent in Russian, German, and Spanish, Ray holds an MA in Russian from Fordham University and Certificate of Theological Studies from Georgetown.
[01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.817]  He's also a graduate of Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program.
[01:11:29.157 --> 01:11:31.779]  He holds a Certificate in Theology Studies from Georgetown University.
[01:11:32.199 --> 01:11:33.300]  RayMcGovern.com.
[01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:39.442]  And the reason he's here today is, we played the clip last hour, we're gonna play it coming up in a few minutes.
[01:11:40.183 --> 01:11:41.785]  Putin has come out and said, listen.
[01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:50.773]  If you attack any of our forces, or basically keep moving more forces in, we are going to, you know, respond and defend ourselves.
[01:11:51.034 --> 01:11:53.135]  We are nuclear power, but that's not a threat.
[01:11:53.636 --> 01:11:54.897]  Well, obviously it is a threat.
[01:11:56.098 --> 01:12:09.389]  This is the doctrine they've had since 888 in 2008, when Western forces attacked Obsidian, South Ossetian and Abkhazia, as a pretext to try to demonize Russia.
[01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:10.470]  And again, I'm not
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.121]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.041]  I'm not defending Russia.
[01:12:13.101 --> 01:12:13.642]  I've studied it.
[01:12:14.162 --> 01:12:15.803]  They're not in an aggressive posture.
[01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:17.325]  The West is, and it's very dangerous.
[01:12:18.526 --> 01:12:24.430]  Just like when they wanted to take over the airport in Pristina, and the Russians said, no, we'll have a war with you.
[01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:29.054]  And it was only the head of NATO backing down that stopped that from going possibly nuclear.
[01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:30.775]  Here's the headline.
[01:12:30.835 --> 01:12:33.357]  Russia threatens nuclear attack on Poland over U.S.
[01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:34.037]  missile shield.
[01:12:34.358 --> 01:12:40.723]  That was on August 15th, a few days after the situation began to settle down in Georgia.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.240]  Here's the headline of the New York Times.
[01:12:43.341 --> 01:12:43.561]  U.S.
[01:12:43.621 --> 01:12:45.801]  General was overruled in Kosovo.
[01:12:46.101 --> 01:12:50.643]  General Jackson rejected the order from his superior by saying, no, I'm not going to do that.
[01:12:50.903 --> 01:12:52.423]  It's not worth starting World War III.
[01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:56.605]  The last time, NATO, was spoiling for a fight with the Russians.
[01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:03.331]  Tried to order attacks on Russians at their airbase that they've been for, you know, been since the World War II.
[01:13:04.032 --> 01:13:06.132]  So, this is a replay of this.
[01:13:06.752 --> 01:13:11.493]  This is beyond Cuban Missile Crisis in my layman view, but I researched this deeply.
[01:13:12.293 --> 01:13:14.214]  This is really getting out of control.
[01:13:15.014 --> 01:13:17.095]  There's obviously the CIA director went there.
[01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:22.076]  They've got special ops from the people that I've talked to and mercenaries advising.
[01:13:23.376 --> 01:13:25.498]  There's all sorts of stuff going on.
[01:13:25.538 --> 01:13:27.780]  The Russians have been shooting down Ukrainian drones.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.243]  There have been Russian columns getting destroyed.
[01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:34.806]  And Putin basically said, some of our troops have been captured.
[01:13:35.086 --> 01:13:35.967]  They'll be returned.
[01:13:36.227 --> 01:13:38.428]  And then the kids all laughed when he gave the speech.
[01:13:38.469 --> 01:13:39.930]  He was there talking to a youth group.
[01:13:41.072 --> 01:13:52.364]  So, I mean, I take from that, let's just be honest, there are Russian forces there protecting their interests, their gas fields that they put in, their pipelines, their military bases, their Black Sea base.
[01:13:52.644 --> 01:13:56.268]  Now, that's my little briefing because a lot of stations just joined us.
[01:13:56.668 --> 01:13:59.811]  We have a lot of new stations in L.A.
[01:14:00.071 --> 01:14:01.673]  and just joined us this week.
[01:14:01.693 --> 01:14:02.794]  I need to plug that new station.
[01:14:03.695 --> 01:14:05.257]  Oklahoma City and so many others.
[01:14:05.297 --> 01:14:06.479]  The broadcast is exploding.
[01:14:06.819 --> 01:14:08.802]  I wanted to give folks some background here.
[01:14:09.282 --> 01:14:14.008]  Ray, am I correct in my basic gestalt I tried to paint there?
[01:14:14.289 --> 01:14:15.490]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:18.434]  Is this getting as big or bigger than the Cuban Missile Crisis?
[01:14:19.395 --> 01:14:19.896]  Ray McGovern.
[01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:26.615]  Well it is, Alex, in the sense that never before have the U.S.
[01:14:26.735 --> 01:14:29.057]  and Russia been at such loggerheads.
[01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.259]  There's a little difference here.
[01:14:31.279 --> 01:14:43.449]  The missiles that we now know were ready to fire in Cuba, we didn't know it at the time, were a direct threat to our security.
[01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:48.613]  There's no way, Alex, there's no way anyone convinced me
[01:14:49.574 --> 01:14:54.798]  That what's going on in the Ukraine is a direct threat to our security.
[01:14:54.818 --> 01:15:01.583]  It is, however, a direct threat to what the Russians believe to be their security.
[01:15:01.683 --> 01:15:04.765]  They have national interests, they have strategic interests.
[01:15:05.406 --> 01:15:11.230]  They're not going to let a NATO member be in place right under their soft underbelly.
[01:15:13.493 --> 01:15:18.976]  So it is worse because Kennedy did the right thing in the Cuban Missile Crisis and had detente.
[01:15:19.296 --> 01:15:20.336]  They got the missiles out.
[01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:22.658]  It turned out to be a victory for our security.
[01:15:23.258 --> 01:15:31.742]  This time it's literally the EU, Wall Street, other interests want to gobble up Ukraine and they're treating Russia like it's Iraq.
[01:15:33.383 --> 01:15:34.383]  That's right, Alex.
[01:15:34.423 --> 01:15:35.104]  You know, it's...
[01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:48.781]  It's really something to behold for somebody who spent his first 35 professional years focusing in on the evil empire, the Soviet Union.
[01:15:49.362 --> 01:15:50.202]  It was evil enough!
[01:15:51.022 --> 01:16:04.146]  And it's very, very difficult for this old fellow to turn his mind around and stop just assuming that the US and NATO are telling the truth.
[01:16:05.206 --> 01:16:12.191]  And kind of having to assume, from what I know and what I am observing, that it's just the opposite.
[01:16:12.271 --> 01:16:23.799]  But in this case, for the most part, with some exaggerations, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, and Putin himself are mostly telling the truth.
[01:16:23.999 --> 01:16:31.324]  And the big truth they're telling is, look, we told you years ago, we told you in February 2008,
[01:16:33.576 --> 01:16:36.400]  Nietzsche means Nietzsche.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:43.591]  If you have any designs to bring Ukraine into NATO, forget about it, as we would say in the Bronx.
[01:16:43.892 --> 01:16:44.873]  Forget about it!
[01:16:44.893 --> 01:16:45.714]  Now what happened?
[01:16:46.741 --> 01:16:48.761]  That was on the 1st of February, 2008.
[01:16:49.382 --> 01:16:58.184]  Sergey Lavrov, who was Foreign Minister then as well, called our Ambassador in, Bill Burns.
[01:16:58.244 --> 01:17:00.264]  He's now Deputy Secretary of State.
[01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:08.246]  And he said, look, there are rumors going around that you all are going to try to incorporate Ukraine and Georgia into NATO.
[01:17:08.986 --> 01:17:17.149]  We just want to make sure you understand, this would be a direct, a direct threat to our security, and we say nyet, and nyet means nyet.
[01:17:17.649 --> 01:17:24.271]  Now, Bill Burns reported that back to Washington and the top secret cable, and how do we know about that?
[01:17:24.811 --> 01:17:26.391]  Well, give credit where it's due.
[01:17:26.912 --> 01:17:27.512]  WikiLeaks!
[01:17:28.391 --> 01:17:29.632]  And Chelsea Manning.
[01:17:30.293 --> 01:17:30.913]  It's in the cable.
[01:17:30.953 --> 01:17:31.774]  I have the cable.
[01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:39.560]  It reads, just as I said, Bill Burns saying, look, you ought to be aware that I was called on the carpet here.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.042]  The Russians feel very strongly about this.
[01:17:42.543 --> 01:17:49.728]  They predict that the country will fall apart if hostilities start by virtue of trying to get them into NATO.
[01:17:50.309 --> 01:17:53.471]  And so I'm just reporting this to you so that you'll know.
[01:17:53.491 --> 01:17:56.374]  Now, that was the 1st of February, six years ago, 2008.
[01:17:58.075 --> 01:17:58.736]  So what happened?
[01:17:59.857 --> 01:18:00.777]  What happened was this.
[01:18:01.898 --> 01:18:22.676]  On the 3rd of April, a NATO summit of the kind that will just convene in Wales on the 4th and 5th of September next week, a NATO summit in Bucharest decided, and I quote from their declaration, Ukraine and Georgia will become members of NATO, period, end quote.
[01:18:25.078 --> 01:18:25.238]  Now,
[01:18:25.839 --> 01:18:36.109]  What happened after that was this crazy fellow in Georgia, Stakashvili, thought that what the neocons were telling him about having his back, right?
[01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:43.196]  That they'd have his back, and so he started to give the Russians a bloody nose just to the north of the Georgian border.
[01:18:43.736 --> 01:18:49.939]  And now the Russians came back and gave him a very, very bloody nose, and the whole thing collapsed, because the U.S.
[01:18:50.079 --> 01:18:55.921]  would never intervene in so far away a place with no real relevance to the U.S.
[01:18:55.941 --> 01:19:05.906]  And Ray, just to interject again, former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush joins us, a 35-40 year veteran, the highest levels of global intelligence.
[01:19:07.267 --> 01:19:26.287]  Watching it that day with CNN announcing that Russia just attacked Georgia for no reason, and reading the fine print that they had attacked Russian military bases in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and murdered them en masse, it shows the sheer insanity that our media went with that and said, yeah, let's send in NATO.
[01:19:27.068 --> 01:19:33.880]  Till the Russians threatened nuclear attacks on NATO bases, and then they Cheney backed off.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.747]  As it turned out, from the intel I had, correct me if I'm wrong, that...
[01:19:39.472 --> 01:19:46.857]  The Georgian president had been basically, like Saddam was encouraged to go into Kuwait, quietly told, yeah, go ahead and do this, we've got your back.
[01:19:47.317 --> 01:19:52.381]  What were they thinking there, out of the blue, to just attack Russian military bases?
[01:19:52.861 --> 01:19:54.902]  Thank God it didn't escalate more!
[01:19:55.142 --> 01:20:03.568]  And then when I said, I'm glad the Russians are showing restraint, pulling out of Georgia, they had all the neocons come out and claim, I'm a Russian agent.
[01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:07.957]  When literally both sides of my family came over on the Mayflower.
[01:20:08.297 --> 01:20:10.279]  I mean, that is how sick this has gotten.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:11.360]  I'm a traitor.
[01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:12.181]  You're a traitor.
[01:20:12.322 --> 01:20:14.884]  They say that about you because we don't want nuclear war, Ray.
[01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:16.927]  What is wrong with the ruling elite?
[01:20:17.607 --> 01:20:20.330]  JFK was no angel, but he would never act like this.
[01:20:20.611 --> 01:20:22.112]  Reagan didn't do stuff like this.
[01:20:22.393 --> 01:20:24.435]  George Herbert Walker Bush didn't do stuff like this.
[01:20:24.835 --> 01:20:25.937]  What is wrong with them?
[01:20:27.463 --> 01:20:32.648]  Well, President Obama doesn't have any real strategy here.
[01:20:33.409 --> 01:20:36.973]  He's kind of looking around and seeing which way the wind is blowing.
[01:20:37.313 --> 01:20:45.381]  I say that facetiously, but that's pretty much what he said yesterday when he was asked about policy towards Syria, Iraq, and that kind of thing.
[01:20:46.803 --> 01:20:48.805]  He's a very weak leader, let's face it.
[01:20:49.571 --> 01:21:07.098]  And what's happened here is that the Victoria Nuland's, who worked for Dick Cheney for most of her career and now is Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, she and John Kerry are running the policy toward these areas.
[01:21:07.658 --> 01:21:10.619]  Now they were the ones that encouraged the coup d'etat
[01:21:11.443 --> 01:21:14.085]  In Kiev on the 22nd of February.
[01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:15.787]  You don't have to believe me.
[01:21:16.627 --> 01:21:18.469]  None of your viewers have to believe me.
[01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:21.512]  Just listen to the intercepted conversation.
[01:21:21.532 --> 01:21:25.195]  Here's Victoria Nuland speaking en clas, right?
[01:21:25.335 --> 01:21:27.677]  Not even encrypted to the U.S.
[01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:28.978]  Ambassador there in Kiev.
[01:21:29.298 --> 01:21:31.841]  And she's saying, you know, Yotz is our guy.
[01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:37.567]  The other fellows, they can stay in the wings here, but Yotz is going to be the next Prime Minister.
[01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:38.268]  He knows.
[01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.411]  He's been head of the Central Bank.
[01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:44.295]  He knows what austerity measures are going to be needed by the IMF.
[01:21:44.575 --> 01:21:45.416]  So he's our guy.
[01:21:46.417 --> 01:21:49.398]  That was at the end of January, Alex.
[01:21:49.458 --> 01:21:51.659]  The end of January of this year.
[01:21:51.679 --> 01:21:56.341]  On the 22nd of February, there's a coup.
[01:21:57.341 --> 01:21:59.562]  And guess who becomes the Prime Minister?
[01:22:00.453 --> 01:22:00.853]  YATS!
[01:22:01.954 --> 01:22:04.735]  And then Obama calls him elected when he was not elected.
[01:22:06.176 --> 01:22:06.617]  Yikes!
[01:22:06.777 --> 01:22:07.397]  It's YATS!
[01:22:08.017 --> 01:22:15.802]  Now, just to borrow a phrase from the Declaration of Independence, a decent respect for the opinion of mankind
[01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:25.299]  Having that intercepted conversation between Newland and Pyatt on YouTube showing that Yatts was our guy.
[01:22:25.319 --> 01:22:31.584]  I mean, you would think that that would maybe disqualify Yatts from becoming the Prime Minister of Ukraine?
[01:22:31.764 --> 01:22:32.405]  No, no, no.
[01:22:32.785 --> 01:22:37.789]  The chutzpah is such that it was thought to be a... Well, that's what scares me.
[01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:40.492]  They don't even use encrypted telephones.
[01:22:40.532 --> 01:22:41.833]  They act so arrogant.
[01:22:43.412 --> 01:22:45.175]  And I've studied history as I know you have, sir.
[01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:56.831]  These are the times in history where you get arrogant elites, this is how we ended the last interview and I want to get into this with you now, where they just start making wrong moves, they think they're invincible, they've never been in combat.
[01:22:58.217 --> 01:23:02.518]  I mean, that's one big problem with having all these people in government that have never been in combat like you and others.
[01:23:02.898 --> 01:23:04.178]  They just think they're invincible.
[01:23:04.418 --> 01:23:06.879]  They think they're bulletproof like 14-year-old boys.
[01:23:07.819 --> 01:23:14.281]  And anybody who studied history can see the incredible danger, the stance the Russians are getting in.
[01:23:14.301 --> 01:23:18.522]  They look completely freaked out, but have a lot of resolve.
[01:23:18.542 --> 01:23:19.842]  And I'm not even lionizing them.
[01:23:19.882 --> 01:23:22.583]  It's just a fact they're under attack overall.
[01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:31.311]  You broke down what it means to have the anti-missile systems in the Black Sea and obviously have been snuck into Ukraine and Poland on record.
[01:23:31.971 --> 01:23:32.651]  That's come out.
[01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:36.652]  What is going to happen when you talk about launch on warning?
[01:23:36.932 --> 01:23:42.353]  Explain to people how this works and then spend some time getting into where you think this is going.
[01:23:42.753 --> 01:23:45.594]  Is there some form of sanity that can abound?
[01:23:46.514 --> 01:23:49.776]  What are other intelligence analysts saying, both former and current?
[01:23:50.377 --> 01:23:51.397]  I know I talked to some of them.
[01:23:51.418 --> 01:23:52.899]  They're completely freaked out.
[01:23:53.459 --> 01:23:55.440]  What are your colleagues that are still in government saying?
[01:23:57.041 --> 01:24:04.687]  Well, the basic problem is we have a bunch of sophomores who, as you point out, don't know what war is like.
[01:24:06.048 --> 01:24:07.369]  They've got Obama's ear.
[01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:10.291]  Of course, Obama doesn't know what war is like.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:31.305]  What saved us from war against Syria and a widened war in the Middle East at precisely this time last year was General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who does know something about war, has his head screwed on right, and went to President Obama and said, look Mr. President,
[01:24:32.365 --> 01:24:37.728]  We know that you really favor those young folks in the White House and in the U.N.
[01:24:37.788 --> 01:24:47.914]  and, you know, especially those tough women who want to protect everybody else in the whole world, but frankly, Mr. President, they don't know anything about war.
[01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:52.870]  We and the Joint Chiefs do, for better or for worse.
[01:24:53.610 --> 01:25:16.241]  And my colleagues have persuaded me, I need to see you, and to tell you not only to be aware of that kind of advice, but that John Kerry, with all due respect, with all due respect, at the State Department, he talks about starting a war with Syria that would be a, his words, UNBELIEVABLY SHORT
[01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:19.446]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:25:37.577 --> 01:25:38.799]  He's not telling the truth.
[01:25:39.319 --> 01:25:54.518]  When he said yesterday, on the 30th of August last year, when he said yesterday at the State Department no fewer than 35 times, we know, we know, we know it was Bashar al-Assad's government that fired those chemical weapons on the 21st of August.
[01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:55.980]  He doesn't know.
[01:25:56.963 --> 01:26:05.149]  We don't know either, but we think, at least we know, that the sarin used was not the sarin from Syrian government stocks.
[01:26:05.529 --> 01:26:13.175]  Rather, it's a homemade sarin, and we have the British to prove that because they had a sample, they've analyzed it, they've told me.
[01:26:13.495 --> 01:26:19.920]  And so, Mr. President, it's equally likely, we think even more likely, and so do the CIA analysts think,
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:39.970]  That it was the rebels, it was the people that you are supporting, it was the people that the Turks are supporting that staged this chemical attack outside Damascus on August the 21st for the express purpose of tripping your little red line that someone persuaded you to draw and to get the U.S.
[01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:42.191]  involved militarily in Syria.
[01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:43.791]  So Mr. President, look,
[01:26:45.525 --> 01:26:47.467]  Here's the deal, Mr. President.
[01:26:47.807 --> 01:26:52.090]  When you go into the Rose Garden tomorrow, why don't you blame it on me, says Dempsey.
[01:26:52.570 --> 01:27:05.018]  Why don't you say, we're ready to go, we have our ships in the Eastern Mediterranean, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff advises me that there's no time sensitivity to this.
[01:27:05.919 --> 01:27:08.401]  We could do it today, or tomorrow, or next week.
[01:27:08.481 --> 01:27:09.602]  We could do it next month.
[01:27:10.322 --> 01:27:15.365]  But I'm going to go to Congress now and ask for authorization.
[01:27:16.346 --> 01:27:27.113]  That's precisely what Barack Obama did on the 31st of August, less than 20 hours after John Kerry all but declared war on Syria.
[01:27:27.594 --> 01:27:28.754]  Now why do I mention all that?
[01:27:29.155 --> 01:27:33.357]  Well, because it's exactly a year ago, but also because that's what has to happen now.
[01:27:34.278 --> 01:27:37.343]  General Debsie will be going to the summit in Wales.
[01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:43.952]  I find it ironic because the real message for that summit is for the Welsh.
[01:27:44.914 --> 01:27:49.340]  Because the basic problem here is that the US-Welsh
[01:27:50.330 --> 01:28:04.834]  On his promise to the Russian leaders that it would not move NATO one inch, was the word James Baker used, one inch farther eastward than Germany if the Russians acquiesced in the reunification of Germany.
[01:28:04.874 --> 01:28:06.254]  That was the deal, okay?
[01:28:06.394 --> 01:28:08.694]  That was the deal 25 years ago.
[01:28:09.155 --> 01:28:10.095]  We welched on it.
[01:28:10.575 --> 01:28:17.997]  It seems to be the height of irony that we're meeting in the next NATO summit and where the Welsh live, in Wales.
[01:28:18.297 --> 01:28:18.637]  Anyhow,
[01:28:19.437 --> 01:28:20.858]  Dempsey's going to be going there.
[01:28:21.278 --> 01:28:25.482]  There are other level-headed military people in NATO.
[01:28:26.142 --> 01:28:40.353]  I'm just hoping that they can inject a modicum of reason into their calculations and realize that the Russians, understandably, are not going to tolerate drawing Ukraine into NATO.
[01:28:40.674 --> 01:28:41.034]  Period.
[01:28:42.239 --> 01:28:46.686]  I know that you worked in and around Henry Kissinger, and here's the headline.
[01:28:47.286 --> 01:28:50.932]  The assembly of a new world order, Wall Street Journal just came out minutes ago.
[01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:54.918]  The concept that has underpinned the modern geopolitical era is in crisis.
[01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:56.780]  He goes on to praise
[01:28:57.941 --> 01:29:02.944]  Libya and Syria wars, civil wars that were staged, and what's happened with Russia.
[01:29:03.885 --> 01:29:11.509]  It just sounds like the Prince of Darkness, Richard Perle, you know, bragging to women that he's a good killer, or Obama saying he's good at killing people.
[01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:16.292]  Last time I checked, he's never killed anybody with his own hands, or pulled the trigger.
[01:29:16.312 --> 01:29:20.775]  It just smells of the Titanic running into an iceberg.
[01:29:20.835 --> 01:29:23.137]  It just smells of disaster.
[01:29:24.178 --> 01:29:27.860]  to to like see these these crazy eyed women.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:36.745]  I'm not saying that because they're women, but they look like crazy witches up there at the UN and at the State Department trying to start wars and looking crazed.
[01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:39.006]  Do a few more minutes with the circus.
[01:29:39.026 --> 01:29:42.428]  I want to get your take on how we can de-escalate this, where you think it's going.
[01:29:42.808 --> 01:29:44.449]  I want to play that clip of Putin, but
[01:29:45.464 --> 01:29:50.687]  To see Henry Kissinger now running around licking his lips, how this is going to bring in the New World Order.
[01:29:50.847 --> 01:29:53.068]  I mean, this is a key time, folks.
[01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:55.369]  Henry Kissinger has raised his head.
[01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.530]  Stay with us.
[01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:57.510]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:59.071 --> 01:29:59.972]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.472 --> 01:30:02.073]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.993 --> 01:30:05.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.591 --> 01:30:16.654]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:16.754 --> 01:30:18.915]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:19.096 --> 01:30:24.198]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:29.420]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.582]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:32.862 --> 01:30:36.725]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:36.945 --> 01:30:41.168]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:41.248 --> 01:30:51.276]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:51.496 --> 01:30:54.018]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:30:54.318 --> 01:31:02.250]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:02.410 --> 01:31:06.375]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:09.662 --> 01:31:15.604]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:31:15.824 --> 01:31:20.006]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:31:20.386 --> 01:31:24.948]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:31:25.368 --> 01:31:27.970]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:33.474]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:33.735 --> 01:31:40.620]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.903]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:31:45.263 --> 01:31:50.047]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:50.367 --> 01:31:51.228]  This is innovating.
[01:31:51.508 --> 01:31:58.818]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:31:58.838 --> 01:32:03.063]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:32:09.545 --> 01:32:15.651]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:18.953]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:18.973 --> 01:32:20.715]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant.
[01:32:20.755 --> 01:32:27.001]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:27.121 --> 01:32:33.006]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:32:33.166 --> 01:32:36.927]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:37.107 --> 01:32:39.988]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:40.008 --> 01:32:48.211]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:48.471 --> 01:32:50.512]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:50.572 --> 01:32:51.592]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:32:51.972 --> 01:33:00.695]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:14.219]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:33:15.159 --> 01:33:21.381]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[01:33:22.839 --> 01:33:29.065]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:50.998 --> 01:33:53.979]  All right, we're going to do about 10 more minutes with Ray McGovern, then we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:33:54.079 --> 01:34:00.342]  John, Chris, Will, Chris, Habu, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:34:00.782 --> 01:34:04.003]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:34:04.183 --> 01:34:08.725]  I get excited about geopolitical movements.
[01:34:09.305 --> 01:34:18.429]  I get excited about our own government and foreign governments allowing al-Qaeda, now named IS, to be armed and to take over areas of Syria.
[01:34:19.864 --> 01:34:20.884]  I get upset about that.
[01:34:21.184 --> 01:34:24.065]  Average folks get upset about baseball or football and yell and scream.
[01:34:24.105 --> 01:34:25.045]  That's supposedly normal.
[01:34:26.365 --> 01:34:28.166]  Sure, I like a good ball game as much as the next guy.
[01:34:28.586 --> 01:34:30.486]  But I get upset and get emotional.
[01:34:30.906 --> 01:34:32.247]  I intellectually look at the facts.
[01:34:33.227 --> 01:34:36.888]  But then I do emotionally get upset on air.
[01:34:37.288 --> 01:34:37.728]  It's real.
[01:34:37.748 --> 01:34:45.269]  Because I'm passionately trying to get you to become passionate about what's happening out there so we don't become radioactive.
[01:34:45.729 --> 01:34:48.130]  The old saying is, get active or get radioactive.
[01:34:49.707 --> 01:34:53.448]  The Russian government, the communist government, did a lot of wicked, horrible things.
[01:34:53.648 --> 01:34:55.009]  I'm a fan of Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[01:34:55.769 --> 01:34:56.969]  I'm an anti-communist, folks.
[01:34:56.989 --> 01:34:57.509]  Everybody knows that.
[01:34:57.529 --> 01:34:58.810]  I'm a free market capitalist.
[01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:00.470]  I know it's the best system in the world.
[01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:04.132]  It's not perfect, because you get oligarchical corruption in it.
[01:35:06.132 --> 01:35:12.434]  But you look at Russia today, this is causing them to become more authoritarian just to hold it together.
[01:35:12.974 --> 01:35:15.395]  Which is sad, because I want Russia to become more free.
[01:35:15.715 --> 01:35:16.675]  I want prosperity.
[01:35:16.715 --> 01:35:17.876]  I know Ray McGovern wants that.
[01:35:19.042 --> 01:35:28.605]  And it's so immoral to watch our government and our elites doing this, but they're not even doing it from cold-blooded positions of evil.
[01:35:28.745 --> 01:35:42.770]  I mean they are, in many respects, they are doing it from just a self-destructive spirit that really concerns me when I look at it.
[01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:45.771]  It's like it's a big joke to them and
[01:35:48.377 --> 01:35:54.139]  I really, in my bones, have a lot of genuine anxiety right now.
[01:35:54.199 --> 01:35:58.361]  And Ray McGovern briefed Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, who was their top briefer.
[01:35:58.921 --> 01:36:03.383]  I know he's all about being calm and breaking things down, but Ray, in your gut,
[01:36:04.338 --> 01:36:17.306]  And in being with the CIA almost 40 years, and all the rest of it, talking to other analysts, knowing General Dempsey stopped the takeover of Syria for Al-Qaeda, now that turned back around and run into Iraq.
[01:36:18.266 --> 01:36:29.693]  It's almost like the devil came up with this Machiavellian strategy, because I can see the destabilization strategy, but it's so destructive, and then Kissinger saying, out of this swirling black hole,
[01:36:30.919 --> 01:36:31.059]  That's
[01:36:48.016 --> 01:36:54.859]  On a scale of one to ten, what would you say the danger of this new Cold War leading to a regional war or even a nuclear war is?
[01:36:55.239 --> 01:37:01.602]  Because when you've got Putin and others saying, hey, we have nuclear weapons, it's just, it's such a sinking feeling is my point.
[01:37:03.462 --> 01:37:12.666]  Well, judging from the President's attitude yesterday, where he made it very clear, we're not going to get involved in a military conflict with Russia.
[01:37:14.337 --> 01:37:25.667]  This cutting 180 degrees away from what a lot of his advisors are doing and saying, you can see a kind of a Hamlet type calculation on Obama's part.
[01:37:26.048 --> 01:37:27.429]  I don't know how it's going to come out.
[01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:35.275]  What we'll know more is after the NATO Summit on the 5th of September,
[01:37:35.976 --> 01:37:44.098]  We'll know if there's a degree of realism with the Germans, for example, who up until now have been led down the Gordon Path by the U.S.
[01:37:44.519 --> 01:37:45.519]  The French as well.
[01:37:46.179 --> 01:37:48.520]  Major countries, with one exception.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.441]  And that was, it wouldn't go along with a war of aggression against Iraq.
[01:37:54.241 --> 01:38:02.204]  The question really is whether the Germans and the French are led by leaders now that have the courage to stand up and say, look, you know, we know.
[01:38:02.964 --> 01:38:04.225]  What a war of aggression is.
[01:38:04.906 --> 01:38:07.088]  We're not going to perpetrate one by ourselves.
[01:38:08.028 --> 01:38:10.871]  Now the other thing is, I'd just like to pick up on Henry Kissinger.
[01:38:10.931 --> 01:38:16.856]  My father was a lawyer and he used to talk about the age of statutory senility.
[01:38:18.317 --> 01:38:25.103]  Henry Kissinger reached the age of statutory senility about at least a decade ago.
[01:38:25.963 --> 01:38:39.446]  And so it doesn't make a lot of sense, except every now and then when he's asked a specific question, they asked him one month ago, are the Russians right in feeling threatened by NATO coming into Ukraine?
[01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:40.767]  And he said, of course they are!
[01:38:40.847 --> 01:38:41.547]  That's crazy!
[01:38:41.567 --> 01:38:42.947]  Who else said that?
[01:38:43.427 --> 01:38:44.548]  Zbigniew Brzezinski!
[01:38:45.228 --> 01:38:47.808]  No cuddler of the Russians, he, okay?
[01:38:48.208 --> 01:38:54.290]  So, these Real Politica guys are smart enough to realize what a dumb move this will be if
[01:38:54.970 --> 01:39:02.375]  If NATO doesn't rescind its decision six years ago to incorporate Ukraine as a member.
[01:39:03.036 --> 01:39:04.276]  So those are important things.
[01:39:04.316 --> 01:39:09.020]  Now, the other things, Alex, are, you know, why do they do this?
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.801]  Why are they doing this, you know?
[01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:21.108]  Well, some of the political scientists, some whom I admire, John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, for example, talks about liberalism run amok, you know?
[01:39:21.928 --> 01:39:24.250]  We're the sole indispensable country in the world.
[01:39:24.630 --> 01:39:31.395]  That, by definition, means all other countries are dispensable, and we're going to show them how to put democracy in places like Russia.
[01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:35.498]  You know, that may be some of it, but I think most of it is...
[01:39:37.216 --> 01:39:37.496]  Money?
[01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:44.221]  I think most of it is what General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower warned against the military-industrial.
[01:39:44.561 --> 01:39:50.665]  Now we have the military-industrial-congressional-media-security-state complex.
[01:39:50.785 --> 01:39:52.266]  Much more dangerous, okay?
[01:39:52.626 --> 01:39:54.808]  So, how do I look at it?
[01:39:55.368 --> 01:40:03.453]  Well, Larry Wilkerson, who worked for Colin Powell as his Chief of Staff, I was on the television yesterday, and what he said was this.
[01:40:04.774 --> 01:40:11.759]  We, we at the end of the Berlin Wall caving, we said, let's invite the Russians into NATO.
[01:40:11.799 --> 01:40:13.981]  If you're going to keep NATO, let's invite them in.
[01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:15.722]  And they were rebuffed.
[01:40:15.942 --> 01:40:17.763]  Okay, they were rebuffed.
[01:40:17.783 --> 01:40:17.843]  Why?
[01:40:19.645 --> 01:40:22.827]  Because Lockheed Martin
[01:40:24.113 --> 01:40:35.764]  Reathon wanted to sell a whole bunch of arms to Poland and other countries and for them to buy the arms they had to have a big threat, right?
[01:40:36.084 --> 01:40:38.346]  And so there's the ready-made threat, Russia.
[01:40:39.107 --> 01:40:42.670]  More recently, I want to just read you one paragraph of this news report.
[01:40:44.272 --> 01:40:45.494]  This is Bloomberg, okay?
[01:40:45.514 --> 01:40:53.865]  The Ukraine troubles are leading Western governments to renew the role of the weapon that dominated the Cold War.
[01:40:54.586 --> 01:40:55.468]  The battle tank.
[01:40:56.462 --> 01:41:14.907]  The cost and warfighting benefits of developing a common armored vehicle for the whole region could spur consolidation beyond the pending merger of Germany's Krauss-Maffei-Weckmann-DMBH and France's Nixer Systems-SA.
[01:41:16.348 --> 01:41:28.521]  The CEO of Mafei says, so you have a common battle tank now, which was sort of dead in the water because there was nobody to use the tank again.
[01:41:28.621 --> 01:41:30.503]  Yeah, now we have the tank.
[01:41:30.904 --> 01:41:32.185]  Now we can get the tank built.
[01:41:32.285 --> 01:41:33.987]  Now we can make lots of money.
[01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:37.190]  So, you know, in the old days, I used to think
[01:41:38.251 --> 01:41:43.114]  Explaining everything by, you know, Cui Bono, who's going to make all the money.
[01:41:43.594 --> 01:41:44.935]  That was a little simplistic.
[01:41:45.035 --> 01:41:47.977]  I still think that not everything can be explained by that.
[01:41:48.397 --> 01:41:57.383]  But if you look at what happens, if you look at who profits from this kind of tension, and who, you know, who's going to make all the money, it's the 1%, Alex, it's not the rest of us.
[01:41:58.003 --> 01:42:01.225]  But if there's a nuclear war, they're not going to have anywhere to spend this money.
[01:42:01.505 --> 01:42:14.377]  Yeah, I think we're a couple steps away from that now, partly because Putin is smart enough to not perpetrate that, and Obama, I think, knows a little bit more than we give him credit for.
[01:42:14.737 --> 01:42:21.143]  But what I'd like to finish up saying is that last year at this time, okay, there were two really important things that happened.
[01:42:22.144 --> 01:42:25.227]  Not only were they trying to get a war going against Syria, but
[01:42:26.528 --> 01:42:28.509]  The congressmen and senators were home.
[01:42:29.049 --> 01:42:30.210]  They were in their districts.
[01:42:30.710 --> 01:42:33.931]  The American people got up and said, no more war.
[01:42:34.431 --> 01:42:34.752]  Okay?
[01:42:35.092 --> 01:42:43.095]  The British Parliament, for the first time in modern history, turned the Prime Minister down and said, no, we're not going to vote for war in Syria.
[01:42:43.215 --> 01:42:44.896]  First time in hundreds of years.
[01:42:44.916 --> 01:42:45.916]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:42:46.517 --> 01:42:48.137]  Yeah, first time in hundreds of years.
[01:42:48.157 --> 01:42:49.398]  That's a great point.
[01:42:50.442 --> 01:42:54.226]  So you think Obama's statement yesterday signals maybe a de-escalation?
[01:42:54.647 --> 01:42:59.853]  Why would Putin come out today and say, hey, we'll defend ourselves, we have nuclear weapons, watch it.
[01:43:00.453 --> 01:43:11.165]  Do you think that that is to basically escalate it in the news to the level of understanding in the public to force a debate about the stakes here?
[01:43:11.866 --> 01:43:18.510]  Yes, Putin is painfully aware that NATO is meeting at the summit level in Wales on the 4th and 5th of September.
[01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:27.015]  He just wants to remind all these folks, including Dane, who is the Secretary General, and you know, sort of froths at the mouth,
[01:43:27.855 --> 01:43:34.038]  And says, yeah, we're going to place units real close to the Soviet, to the Russian border.
[01:43:34.578 --> 01:43:38.980]  And we're also going to modernize, modernize the Ukrainian military.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.900]  There's a lot of money in modernizing.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:49.744]  So he's just laying down a marker and say, look, in case you hadn't thought about it, folks, we're not a weak country like we were 25 years ago.
[01:43:50.304 --> 01:43:53.785]  And of course, we have the continuing nuclear deterrent.
[01:43:53.885 --> 01:43:55.126]  So that's how I read that.
[01:43:58.051 --> 01:44:04.537]  You're getting back to what really concerns me, because I've been a student of politics, always found it very interesting, geopolitics, military affairs.
[01:44:05.398 --> 01:44:07.300]  People were always corrupt and had problems.
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:09.763]  There were good guys, bad guys, but people were more serious.
[01:44:11.284 --> 01:44:11.625]  Now...
[01:44:13.237 --> 01:44:18.964]  When I see the mannerisms and the meetings and Hillary saying, we came to Libya, we saw he died.
[01:44:19.745 --> 01:44:21.427]  Obama, I'm good at killing people.
[01:44:21.527 --> 01:44:26.432]  Pearl hits on girls at cocktail parties saying, I kill a lot of people.
[01:44:27.854 --> 01:44:31.638]  I see these statements and weirdness and swaggering.
[01:44:32.259 --> 01:44:42.171]  That you see in people that have never really physically been involved in violence themselves, who think it's tough, who think it's sexy, who think they're like General Zod in a Superman movie.
[01:44:42.471 --> 01:44:44.714]  This is the real world, our only planet.
[01:44:45.174 --> 01:44:51.702]  This is not a game, and that's what keeps me up at night now, is, like you mentioned, the Secretary General and people.
[01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:58.033]  Some of these folks are frothing at the mouth with just incendiary stuff at Russia.
[01:44:58.353 --> 01:45:05.315]  And then Russia, like you said a few weeks ago, is like, yeah, we kind of like to keep our port we've had for hundreds of years, but we want to be friends with you.
[01:45:05.876 --> 01:45:08.437]  And then our media is like, they want to kill us, they're going to murder us.
[01:45:08.497 --> 01:45:11.398]  And finally, Russia is saying, OK, yeah, we have nuclear weapons.
[01:45:11.418 --> 01:45:12.058]  You need to stop now.
[01:45:13.988 --> 01:45:32.119]  Yeah, I mean, the propaganda offensive in this country and the West reached ridiculous proportions when the Russians had those 280 trucks to bring provisions, including baby food and that kind of thing, into these besieged areas around Donetsk and Lviv.
[01:45:35.101 --> 01:45:56.210]  The media here and the propagandists were saying, look, there must be weapons in there, must be weapons, even though there were 59 inspectors that ran through those trucks at will while they were holed up for a whole week, mind you, a whole week before the Russians said, we're not going to wait any longer, we're going to go in and distribute this.
[01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:59.311]  Imagine yourself as a parent.
[01:46:00.425 --> 01:46:04.867]  I have a parent of a baby that needs formula, that needs milk.
[01:46:05.587 --> 01:46:12.250]  And you're hearing that the Russians are going to bring it, but they don't have the right papers to get through the Iranian customs?
[01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:16.032]  Well, there were no weapons on those trucks, and we know that.
[01:46:16.552 --> 01:46:19.514]  And so it's just sort of this artificial... I agree.
[01:46:19.614 --> 01:46:20.654]  That was confirmed.
[01:46:20.894 --> 01:46:23.555]  And we don't know what happened with the airliner and the rest of it.
[01:46:23.595 --> 01:46:29.278]  But clearly, I believe this signifies Putin's statement, though, because I've watched
[01:46:30.222 --> 01:46:34.924]  Some of the segments is a two and a half hour talk where he goes, well, yes, some Russian troops got picked up.
[01:46:34.964 --> 01:46:35.664]  They'll be brought back.
[01:46:35.884 --> 01:46:36.664]  They're just helping.
[01:46:36.724 --> 01:46:37.865]  Everybody laughs and he laughs.
[01:46:38.305 --> 01:46:40.366]  Clearly, they've got troops guarding their bases.
[01:46:40.726 --> 01:46:41.566]  That's on record.
[01:46:41.946 --> 01:46:44.307]  And sure, they are doing aid convoys.
[01:46:44.527 --> 01:46:51.750]  But I think his statement about nukes, I think it marks a quiet escalation where they realize being nice hasn't worked.
[01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:54.571]  And I'm predicting you are going to see more Russian troops.
[01:46:55.171 --> 01:46:57.352]  Basically infiltrate, not exfiltrate.
[01:46:57.693 --> 01:47:10.440]  And I think this is a major sign of a hardening in the Russians, which some would say is bad, some would say is good, because the only thing that the globalists see is strength.
[01:47:10.881 --> 01:47:12.862]  That's the only thing that they tend to back off from.
[01:47:13.806 --> 01:47:20.835]  Yeah, Alex, one thing that's really necessary to appreciate and that is the situation on the ground in southeastern Ukraine.
[01:47:21.616 --> 01:47:25.721]  Now, contrary to the public, the propaganda picture in the West,
[01:47:26.833 --> 01:47:32.757]  Which had the Ukrainian army winning, surrounding Donetsk and some of the other cities.
[01:47:34.278 --> 01:47:46.426]  The so-called separatists, which are really federalists, so anti-coup federalists that speak Russian mostly, they surrounded these inept Ukrainian troops.
[01:47:47.046 --> 01:47:55.352]  And so the tide turned exactly two weeks ago, and it was before the Russians ever came in, if indeed they've come in in significant numbers.
[01:47:55.812 --> 01:48:02.617]  And so this is sort of a face-saving excuse for the fact that the Ukrainians are taking it on the chin.
[01:48:02.637 --> 01:48:04.258]  A lot of them ran away.
[01:48:04.558 --> 01:48:06.079]  They left lockets behind them.
[01:48:06.119 --> 01:48:07.640]  We have photos showing all that.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:09.041]  They're undisciplined.
[01:48:09.421 --> 01:48:15.826]  And so it was the pro-Russian, if you want to call them that, separatists that were starting to win.
[01:48:16.346 --> 01:48:19.529]  And all of a sudden, how are they going to explain that to the world?
[01:48:19.849 --> 01:48:21.891]  It must be those darn Russians.
[01:48:21.991 --> 01:48:23.793]  The Russians came in en masse.
[01:48:24.214 --> 01:48:35.364]  The photos, the satellite photography that NATO brought forth yesterday, as an intelligence professional, Alex, I'm embarrassed.
[01:48:35.825 --> 01:48:38.307]  I mean, you couldn't tell anything from those photos.
[01:48:38.647 --> 01:48:40.129]  And if that's the best they have,
[01:48:40.649 --> 01:49:01.355]  You know, if that's the best they have from commercial satellite photography, you know, it's really, it really stretches the credulity to think that they have any good evidence at all that substantial members of the Russians... Well, I agree, but I wouldn't blame the Russians guarding the infrastructure they paid for and that they have contracts on.
[01:49:02.341 --> 01:49:03.221]  Oh, well, sure.
[01:49:03.441 --> 01:49:08.563]  All I'm saying is that that would be reasonable and some of that, no doubt, is happening.
[01:49:09.143 --> 01:49:13.724]  But the evidence is not what is presented by NATO and by the U.S.
[01:49:14.144 --> 01:49:23.406]  The other thing is that Putin has deliberately adopted a kind of a laissez-faire, a kind of a laid-back attitude.
[01:49:23.646 --> 01:49:30.128]  What he said last night was, look, you Ukrainians that we support politically, at least,
[01:49:31.388 --> 01:49:40.152]  Be aware that, you know, you may have captured a couple hundred Ukrainian government forces, but let them go.
[01:49:40.252 --> 01:49:42.873]  Get a corridor back into the Western Ukraine.
[01:49:43.034 --> 01:49:44.914]  Let them go, for Pete's sake, you know?
[01:49:45.455 --> 01:49:49.817]  And we expect them to let those 12 guys that they captured from us.
[01:49:50.077 --> 01:49:52.538]  Let's not make this into a big conflagration.
[01:49:52.798 --> 01:50:00.602]  Now, I have to tell you, that's a much more statesman-like attitude than anything we're seeing out of NATO or out of Washington.
[01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:02.482]  That's it.
[01:50:02.582 --> 01:50:05.383]  We don't see anything diplomatic out of the West anymore.
[01:50:05.443 --> 01:50:06.704]  It's all just thuggish.
[01:50:07.804 --> 01:50:11.446]  Al Capone had more grace than these guys, and that's what concerns me.
[01:50:14.047 --> 01:50:25.231]  That's true, and Jack Matlock, who used to be our ambassador in the Soviet Union and in Russia, in his most recent writing he said, you know, this name-calling
[01:50:26.230 --> 01:50:32.672]  Of the kind you heard Samantha Power do yesterday, it's not doing any good.
[01:50:34.233 --> 01:50:39.755]  You don't say at the UN that we haven't heard a word of truth from Russia.
[01:50:40.395 --> 01:50:45.317]  Indeed, most people know you've heard more truth from Russia than you have from Samantha Power.
[01:50:45.757 --> 01:50:47.477]  So who does she think she's kidding?
[01:50:48.038 --> 01:50:49.478]  I guess the American public.
[01:50:49.698 --> 01:50:54.800]  And the sorry fact, Alex, is that except for your show and others like it,
[01:50:55.914 --> 01:50:57.597]  Americans are being pitted.
[01:50:57.637 --> 01:51:01.865]  Well, sir, thank you so much for the time and have a great weekend and hopefully we can de-escalate this.
[01:51:02.225 --> 01:51:03.768]  Ray McGovern, raymcgovern.com.
[01:51:03.948 --> 01:51:04.790]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:05.892]  Most welcome, Howard.
[01:51:06.112 --> 01:51:06.352]  Thank you.

[01:51:39.639 --> 01:51:40.440]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.941]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:42.241 --> 01:51:43.522]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:43.882 --> 01:51:46.224]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:46.725 --> 01:51:48.566]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:49.006 --> 01:51:53.069]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:57.233]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:57.473 --> 01:52:00.916]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:52:01.236 --> 01:52:01.536]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:52:01.556 --> 01:52:03.297]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:12.964 --> 01:52:16.747]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[01:52:18.048 --> 01:52:19.769]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[01:52:20.129 --> 01:52:21.390]  Police call it robbery.
[01:52:22.331 --> 01:52:23.732]  We call it avoidable.
[01:52:24.232 --> 01:52:29.856]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:35.200]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:41.704]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[01:52:42.885 --> 01:52:49.610]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:53.832]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[01:52:53.892 --> 01:52:55.213]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[01:52:55.273 --> 01:52:57.034]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:53:08.385 --> 01:53:10.947]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:53:11.227 --> 01:53:16.071]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:16.331 --> 01:53:24.217]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:53:24.458 --> 01:53:28.761]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:32.804]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:53:32.944 --> 01:53:38.648]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:53:38.908 --> 01:53:41.690]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:47.294]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:47.434 --> 01:53:55.559]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:53:55.619 --> 01:53:55.799]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:54:02.844 --> 01:54:03.345]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.931 --> 01:54:24.453]  We're gonna have totally open phones and tons of news in the third hour coming up.
[01:54:24.473 --> 01:54:27.514]  I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:27.554 --> 01:54:27.994]  Central.
[01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:32.675]  That's 5 to 7 Eastern with the live Sunday transmission.
[01:54:33.515 --> 01:54:38.337]  We have InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight 7 o'clock with our great reporters and investigative journalist and crew.
[01:54:40.049 --> 01:54:45.813]  I want to go to Will, and I want to go to Chris, and Chris, and Anthony, and Habu.
[01:54:46.334 --> 01:54:49.035]  I don't normally make folks hold that long, but I got you on before.
[01:54:49.056 --> 01:54:50.937]  Then our guest, we were able to get him, came on.
[01:54:51.517 --> 01:54:53.599]  Just briefly, I've skipped two breaks today.
[01:54:54.219 --> 01:54:55.460]  I've not plugged anything.
[01:54:56.381 --> 01:54:59.803]  We fund our operation, selling high-quality products at the best prices.
[01:55:00.224 --> 01:55:03.286]  Infowarslife.com has the best, in my view, in research.
[01:55:05.029 --> 01:55:10.750]  Fancy, super high quality nutraceuticals at prices below the competitors, blowing them away.
[01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:19.713]  X2 iodine that is so much more palatable than other iodines and it's just amazing from the rare earth crystal sources.
[01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:28.335]  The Occupower, which we are almost sold out of at current sales rates by next week or Monday or so, we should be sold out of this.
[01:55:30.302 --> 01:55:36.671]  And we'll have more in a few months, but amazing eye formula, similar to DNA Force, but it mainly focuses on the eyes.
[01:55:37.512 --> 01:55:44.422]  We've got super male vitality, super female vitality, more of the silver bullet came in, super colloidal silver at a very low price.
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:47.941]  A major grocery store chain that puts out organic food.
[01:55:47.961 --> 01:55:48.861]  Everybody knows its name.
[01:55:49.361 --> 01:55:53.123]  This is the same stuff they've got, but it's $9 more with them.
[01:55:53.263 --> 01:55:54.884]  It comes from the same high-quality lab.
[01:55:55.164 --> 01:55:55.984]  Private label for us.
[01:55:56.004 --> 01:55:56.704]  Let's give an example.
[01:55:56.944 --> 01:55:58.505]  You know, it's $19.95 with us.
[01:55:58.565 --> 01:56:00.446]  It's $29.95 with them.
[01:56:00.466 --> 01:56:03.227]  I mean, that just gives you an idea of what's going on here.
[01:56:03.247 --> 01:56:05.668]  A lot of the stuff in there is now sold out.
[01:56:05.748 --> 01:56:06.588]  More is coming in.
[01:56:07.008 --> 01:56:08.009]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:10.253 --> 01:56:14.056]  And we've got the Molon Labe t-shirts and, well, the belt buckles sold out.
[01:56:14.536 --> 01:56:17.999]  And so much more at InfoWarsStore.com or MadeIn1776.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:56:24.946 --> 01:56:27.047]  ProPure G2 filters, the best out there.
[01:56:27.387 --> 01:56:29.749]  Side-by-side comparisons of leading competitors.
[01:56:30.209 --> 01:56:33.171]  Those are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:33.591 --> 01:56:35.712]  That's InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[01:56:36.193 --> 01:56:44.638]  There's videos there that show the science and the background, the studies, and the independent, highly respected labs showing the side-by-side comparisons.
[01:56:44.698 --> 01:56:46.939]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:49.904]  Okay, let's go.
[01:56:50.285 --> 01:56:52.731]  Again, it's critical that you be PresidentPlanet.tv members.
[01:56:53.152 --> 01:56:55.097]  It's critical that you spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:56:55.398 --> 01:56:56.040]  It's critical.
[01:56:56.769 --> 01:56:58.470]  There's not many operations like this.
[01:56:58.490 --> 01:57:01.250]  We appreciate all of your support, spreading the word.
[01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:01.951]  We appreciate.
[01:57:02.291 --> 01:57:03.571]  All we try to do is tell the truth.
[01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:05.112]  The globalists want gun control?
[01:57:05.192 --> 01:57:05.712]  We're against it.
[01:57:05.992 --> 01:57:06.752]  They want open borders?
[01:57:06.792 --> 01:57:07.272]  We're against it.
[01:57:07.472 --> 01:57:09.293]  They want satellite tracker boxes in your cars?
[01:57:09.613 --> 01:57:10.213]  We're against it.
[01:57:10.253 --> 01:57:10.994]  They want to tax you?
[01:57:11.034 --> 01:57:11.594]  Now it's admitted.
[01:57:11.994 --> 01:57:13.074]  They want to start a war with Russia?
[01:57:13.154 --> 01:57:13.675]  We're against it.
[01:57:13.855 --> 01:57:14.835]  They want to fund Al-Qaeda?
[01:57:15.275 --> 01:57:15.855]  We're against it.
[01:57:16.055 --> 01:57:17.816]  It's just, we just try to be moral here.
[01:57:18.056 --> 01:57:19.096]  I want to sleep good at night.
[01:57:19.636 --> 01:57:20.777]  I don't want to have a nuclear war.
[01:57:21.897 --> 01:57:22.878]  My kids are my kids.
[01:57:22.898 --> 01:57:24.839]  They don't belong to MSNBC like they say.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.000]  I'm sick of it.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:27.121]  I don't want to be pushed around.
[01:57:28.002 --> 01:57:30.424]  And if I'm a traitor for not wanting nuclear war, so be it.
[01:57:31.624 --> 01:57:32.805]  Let's talk to Will in Arizona.
[01:57:32.825 --> 01:57:33.946]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:57:33.966 --> 01:57:37.709]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:37.729 --> 01:57:42.092]  My name is Will from Phoenix, Arizona, and I have like four points.
[01:57:42.172 --> 01:57:45.475]  First off, I am a Prison TV Planet member.
[01:57:45.635 --> 01:57:46.095]  Awesome, brother.
[01:57:46.136 --> 01:57:47.857]  Go ahead and enter your points and I'll hold you over if need be.
[01:57:49.463 --> 01:57:50.104]  Okay, all right.
[01:57:50.164 --> 01:57:57.671]  First one is, I think that with regards to everything that's going on with Russia, I think we need to remember who dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
[01:57:58.491 --> 01:58:03.736]  Because if anybody's going to drop a nuke, it's going to be the U.S., and we're going to do it a first strike.
[01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:05.618]  I'm almost betting.
[01:58:06.419 --> 01:58:14.526]  Second, if you really want to have an unbridged idea of what is going on today, look at, it's
[01:58:15.759 --> 01:58:18.541]  It's actually a YouTube video, but it's a documentary.
[01:58:18.782 --> 01:58:19.742]  Adolf Hitler.
[01:58:21.004 --> 01:58:21.724]  What is it?
[01:58:21.824 --> 01:58:23.185]  The greatest story never told.
[01:58:23.486 --> 01:58:24.787]  It's about five hours long.
[01:58:25.528 --> 01:58:27.249]  It doesn't gratify him.
[01:58:27.329 --> 01:58:32.774]  It doesn't try to say that he wasn't, you know, a terrible person at the end of the war and things to that effect.
[01:58:33.174 --> 01:58:40.561]  But it does give more of an unabridged documentary concept of what was going on and how America funded Britain
[01:58:41.429 --> 01:58:44.752]  Oh, it's on record that the elites, the robber barons, J.P.
[01:58:44.793 --> 01:58:47.115]  Morgan and the Rockefellers, put Hitler in.
[01:58:47.335 --> 01:58:47.916]  That's a fact.
[01:58:48.096 --> 01:58:50.558]  That's a mainline Pulitzer Prize winning book.
[01:58:50.578 --> 01:58:52.100]  Scherer's Rise and Fall, Third Reich.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:52.580]  You bet.
[01:58:53.301 --> 01:58:55.343]  It's like they created Saddam Bin Laden.
[01:58:55.403 --> 01:58:55.763]  Stay there.
[01:58:55.783 --> 01:58:56.924]  I'm coming right back to you.
[01:58:57.285 --> 01:58:58.726]  I'm going to let you finish your points, Will.
[01:58:58.766 --> 01:58:59.106]  Third hour.
[01:58:59.847 --> 01:59:05.792]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:59:06.012 --> 01:59:10.195]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:10.575 --> 01:59:15.119]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:15.539 --> 01:59:18.141]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:59:18.461 --> 01:59:23.645]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:59:23.905 --> 01:59:30.790]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:59:31.291 --> 01:59:35.053]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:59:35.434 --> 01:59:40.217]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:40.557 --> 01:59:41.398]  This is innovating.
[01:59:41.678 --> 01:59:48.982]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:59:49.002 --> 01:59:53.224]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:59:53.424 --> 01:59:58.966]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super T-Talk Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:02.588 --> 02:00:04.529]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.969 --> 02:00:07.671]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.612 --> 02:00:16.253]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.913 --> 02:00:17.955]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.675 --> 02:00:19.777]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.437 --> 02:00:21.238]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.019 --> 02:00:22.920]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:27.205]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.765 --> 02:00:31.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:42.305]  Alright, we're talking to Will, then we're going to Chris, and Habu, and another Chris, and Anthony.
[02:00:42.726 --> 02:00:43.606]  Thanks for holding, guys.
[02:00:44.127 --> 02:00:45.328]  Will, finish up your points.
[02:00:45.428 --> 02:00:46.609]  Start over with number one.
[02:00:48.551 --> 02:00:52.474]  Well, number one is just the fact that, you know, we're concerned with what Putin said.
[02:00:52.894 --> 02:01:00.461]  You know, if we need to be concerned about any country dropping a nuke, I think it's America, because we're the only ones that have dropped bombs like that, Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
[02:01:02.563 --> 02:01:03.824]  America is unscrupulous.
[02:01:04.749 --> 02:01:28.225]  The second issue is I wrote an article called Obama arming terrorists the breakdown of government crime And what I said in there was is last year when he was going to arm the terrorists they went in and they said that they were able to do it because there was like some manipulative language in the ability to arm terrorist organizations yada yada yada and
[02:01:28.975 --> 02:01:31.596]  And I went in and I said under Title 18 U.S.C.
[02:01:31.676 --> 02:01:37.778]  Part 1, Chapter 113B, Section 2339, they can't do that, no matter what.
[02:01:37.798 --> 02:01:40.899]  Nobody's even brought him up on charges for that.
[02:01:41.959 --> 02:01:45.860]  Second, Obamacare, my wife works for the federal government, okay?
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:48.881]  But she doesn't work, she's a contractor.
[02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:55.323]  And she works for a company that deals with medical benefits for the military.
[02:01:56.369 --> 02:01:58.371]  And she has health care with them.
[02:01:58.691 --> 02:02:05.618]  When Obamacare rolled out, her monthly payments every two weeks were $40 every two weeks.
[02:02:06.058 --> 02:02:08.841]  Now, it's $300 every month.
[02:02:10.062 --> 02:02:12.544]  My dad's health care's doubled, mine's doubling.
[02:02:13.265 --> 02:02:15.907]  It's all a giant screw job, but we're racist, you know.
[02:02:15.927 --> 02:02:17.949]  I mean, it doesn't matter the bill gets bigger.
[02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:20.712]  Obama said it got smaller, so that's the truth.
[02:02:21.937 --> 02:02:23.580]  If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
[02:02:24.061 --> 02:02:26.044]  That was a fraud committed on the American people.
[02:02:26.184 --> 02:02:31.252]  I do not understand why a class action suit is promulgated by numerous citizens.
[02:02:31.292 --> 02:02:33.055]  Because that's the thing about lawlessness!
[02:02:34.522 --> 02:02:39.683]  The border is wide open while they got armored vehicles driving up and down the street for us.
[02:02:40.844 --> 02:02:42.644]  Look, the government's gone, folks.
[02:02:43.204 --> 02:02:45.645]  It's not even a debate about are you anti-government, pro-government.
[02:02:45.905 --> 02:02:46.925]  It's not even a government.
[02:02:46.945 --> 02:02:53.007]  It's just a free-for-all screwjob with a bunch of crazy bankers trying to start war with the Russians.
[02:02:54.107 --> 02:02:55.948]  I mean, it's just crazy town!
[02:02:56.488 --> 02:02:56.908]  Anything else?
[02:02:57.229 --> 02:03:01.671]  I go back to the Greatest Story Never Told that I was talking about earlier.
[02:03:02.191 --> 02:03:10.175]  He actually kicked out a lot of the bankers because they were trying to implode Germany after World War I. And it was the bankers.
[02:03:10.256 --> 02:03:12.337]  And when I was watching that, it was five hours long.
[02:03:12.377 --> 02:03:14.818]  And I started listening and saying to myself, wait a minute.
[02:03:16.319 --> 02:03:20.161]  Everything that Alex talks about with regard to history is right on point.
[02:03:20.221 --> 02:03:22.402]  They are just repeating history
[02:03:22.887 --> 02:03:27.514]  But because we are so dumbed down in the sense of our historical knowledge, right?
[02:03:27.534 --> 02:03:31.020]  See, it's more sophisticated than that.
[02:03:32.290 --> 02:03:43.620]  Certain robber baron elites went and tried to put Hitler in power, and then separately we can say that Hitler kicked out bankers, which you're saying is code for Jews.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:46.242]  When I use the word banker, it's not code for Jews.
[02:03:46.643 --> 02:03:55.170]  It's more complex than that, that you've got combines of ancient Jewish families that have been banking and basically running pawn shops is where it all came from for about 3,000 years.
[02:03:57.212 --> 02:04:00.514]  And so, Jews didn't invent fractional reserve banking.
[02:04:00.854 --> 02:04:02.556]  Money changing has gone on all over the world.
[02:04:02.776 --> 02:04:08.260]  And I'm not defending some of the Jewish mafias that are out there that use political correctness to protect their operations.
[02:04:08.921 --> 02:04:16.446]  But, I mean, again, you get back to Hitler, I haven't seen the documentary you're talking about, but people can, I guess, check it out for themselves.
[02:04:17.827 --> 02:04:22.171]  My point is, these systems of evil can be deployed and used by anybody.
[02:04:23.167 --> 02:04:25.289]  It is true that Putin arrested a bunch of oligarchs.
[02:04:25.409 --> 02:04:26.791]  Some of them Rothschild connected.
[02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:28.933]  So that's going on as well.
[02:04:29.633 --> 02:04:35.219]  But the Rothschild arm helped Hitler some, and then Hitler even killed some Rothschilds in France.
[02:04:35.859 --> 02:04:42.285]  So it's just a greedy, screwed up system with a bunch of different special interests jumping in and grabbing.
[02:04:43.306 --> 02:04:50.251]  There are well-organized, what I'd call Jewish mafias that are involved in it, but there's other organized mafias as well.
[02:04:50.571 --> 02:04:54.174]  I think we depoliticize it when we call it mafias, because that's what it is.
[02:04:54.194 --> 02:04:59.778]  Because the average Jew out there, I'll assure you, has nothing to do with stuff like that that's going on.
[02:04:59.978 --> 02:05:03.121]  They're just as ignorant as the general public at large.
[02:05:03.941 --> 02:05:05.783]  But you've made your points very interesting.
[02:05:06.023 --> 02:05:07.083]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:05:07.103 --> 02:05:07.504]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.764 --> 02:05:10.984]  Another major health threat.
[02:05:11.024 --> 02:05:15.926]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:05:16.006 --> 02:05:18.607]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:05:18.627 --> 02:05:25.449]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:05:25.709 --> 02:05:28.570]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:31.651]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:05:31.731 --> 02:05:33.652]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:05:33.672 --> 02:05:36.513]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:05:36.613 --> 02:05:42.095]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:05:42.335 --> 02:05:45.817]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:05:45.837 --> 02:05:48.838]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:05:48.938 --> 02:05:56.021]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:06:09.568 --> 02:06:19.776]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:06:20.136 --> 02:06:26.501]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:06:26.581 --> 02:06:28.822]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:42.871]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:43.011 --> 02:06:46.971]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:47.291 --> 02:06:48.752]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:49.072 --> 02:06:56.653]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:06:56.933 --> 02:06:57.773]  But for how long?
[02:06:58.073 --> 02:07:04.334]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:07:04.714 --> 02:07:07.515]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:07:09.548 --> 02:07:15.496]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:15.716 --> 02:07:19.922]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:20.283 --> 02:07:24.849]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:25.249 --> 02:07:27.871]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:28.171 --> 02:07:33.354]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:33.634 --> 02:07:40.498]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:41.019 --> 02:07:44.761]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:45.141 --> 02:07:49.924]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:08:09.705 --> 02:08:14.609]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:16.851]  Government is the problem.
[02:08:16.891 --> 02:08:17.492]  Heresy!
[02:08:17.892 --> 02:08:24.118]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[02:08:24.658 --> 02:08:31.024]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[02:08:34.667 --> 02:08:37.209]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[02:08:43.630 --> 02:08:46.933]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:08:46.973 --> 02:08:49.135]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:08:50.076 --> 02:08:59.725]  You've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[02:09:00.906 --> 02:09:03.548]  They'll warn that tyranny's always lurking just around the corner.
[02:09:04.389 --> 02:09:05.390]  You should reject these voices.
[02:09:11.368 --> 02:09:13.170]  I'd like to read the comments on Infowars.com.
[02:09:13.190 --> 02:09:15.531]  We're going to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:09:15.712 --> 02:09:22.857]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[02:09:23.678 --> 02:09:30.684]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:09:33.706 --> 02:09:35.428]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:37.309]  Because there is a war on.
[02:09:37.810 --> 02:09:38.350]  For your mind.
[02:09:39.946 --> 02:09:49.549]  We posted a blurb of that Reuters article when it broke and we went and found the actual video and added it to it at InfoWars.com with Putin basically saying, we have nuclear weapons, don't mess with us.
[02:09:50.049 --> 02:09:51.169]  A major escalation.
[02:09:53.150 --> 02:09:59.631]  And Robert commented 27 minutes ago, the West will stick Russia with pins and needles, but they will not attack.
[02:10:00.071 --> 02:10:01.992]  There will be no open war with Russia.
[02:10:03.186 --> 02:10:04.306]  Between Russia and the West.
[02:10:04.687 --> 02:10:13.190]  The satanic banking cult, which runs the Western world, does not want to hand over a burned out cinder of the planet to their god Lucifer.
[02:10:13.871 --> 02:10:18.973]  The satanic cult will slowly strangle Russia economically until the Russian people scream.
[02:10:19.493 --> 02:10:20.794]  The CIA will enter Russia.
[02:10:21.134 --> 02:10:23.095]  They will finance political dissidence.
[02:10:23.535 --> 02:10:28.117]  The dissidence will rally the economically pressured Russian people to Orange Revolution.
[02:10:29.011 --> 02:10:31.733]  The orange revolution will result in a political turnover.
[02:10:32.473 --> 02:10:36.175]  Putin replaced with a preselected Western allied leader.
[02:10:36.656 --> 02:10:40.438]  The new leader of Russia will lead the Russian people into the new freedom.
[02:10:40.458 --> 02:10:46.462]  And that new freedom will be a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it.
[02:10:47.062 --> 02:10:48.263]  Ooh, I want to steal that term.
[02:10:49.431 --> 02:10:59.156]  The New World Order is a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it.
[02:11:01.297 --> 02:11:02.898]  It's not stealing if you openly say you're stealing.
[02:11:03.239 --> 02:11:05.080]  Robert, thank you so much for your points.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.561]  And that black hole will be the New World Order.
[02:11:10.865 --> 02:11:15.489]  That's crazy, I was just scrolling through the comments, and hadn't even read to the bottom yet, and then he made that point.
[02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:19.372]  I bet subconsciously I'd already read the line beneath it, and that's why I said that.
[02:11:19.613 --> 02:11:25.918]  I'm thinking, no, no, no, it ought to be, the New World Order is a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it.
[02:11:26.418 --> 02:11:33.004]  But he said it better, he said, it will be a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it, and that black hole will be the New World Order.
[02:11:33.364 --> 02:11:37.328]  Well I don't want to be racist and compare that to Obama, so I'll say a giant white hole.
[02:11:38.916 --> 02:11:51.572]  Because actually they think a lot of black holes actually have all this light going into them and before it goes past the event horizon, black holes are blazing with suns and with nebulas and some of them are so big with galaxies being sucked in.
[02:11:52.369 --> 02:11:56.350]  So the new old order and Obama is like a giant blazing white light.
[02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:58.811]  Stay away from the light, Carol Ann!
[02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.471]  Away from the light!
[02:12:00.491 --> 02:12:02.932]  It's a giant bug zapper flapping into it.
[02:12:03.392 --> 02:12:05.173]  I want my free health care!
[02:12:05.413 --> 02:12:06.233]  Like Obama phone lady.
[02:12:06.453 --> 02:12:08.253]  I want my Obama phone!
[02:12:08.634 --> 02:12:10.294]  I mean, it's just crazy!
[02:12:10.314 --> 02:12:12.194]  I want my free shots!
[02:12:13.955 --> 02:12:17.756]  I mean, how does anyone think anything the federal government wants to do is going to be good?
[02:12:19.617 --> 02:12:20.917]  Oh, man, we're in trouble.
[02:12:22.381 --> 02:12:26.924]  And they've got this huge industrial country fully under globalist control and can just get away with anything now.
[02:12:28.366 --> 02:12:29.887]  Except controlling themselves.
[02:12:29.987 --> 02:12:33.169]  See, the elite do have control almost over the whole world right now.
[02:12:33.509 --> 02:12:35.131]  A few countries they've got to get control of.
[02:12:39.814 --> 02:12:42.616]  But they're going to destroy themselves because of the arrogance.
[02:12:44.057 --> 02:12:44.398]  Urgent!
[02:12:44.478 --> 02:12:51.143]  Obama, to interrupt weekend fundraising trip, will return to DC over Putin and the nuke threat, basically.
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:58.502]  And then meanwhile, New York is on alert for ISIS attack.
[02:12:58.602 --> 02:13:00.323]  England has a super high alert.
[02:13:02.324 --> 02:13:06.027]  And they're saying terror chatter is up as 9-11 anniversary approaches.
[02:13:06.287 --> 02:13:07.428]  Terror chatter?
[02:13:08.148 --> 02:13:14.092]  ISIS, Al-Qaeda in Iraq is allowed to use Twitter and Facebook.
[02:13:14.372 --> 02:13:15.773]  And then when people said, why is that?
[02:13:16.053 --> 02:13:19.375]  They had an article in the Washington Post going, we need to know what they're up to.
[02:13:20.116 --> 02:13:20.516]  That's right.
[02:13:21.974 --> 02:13:26.336]  I post music that we've produced and that we own and we get copyright strikes.
[02:13:27.936 --> 02:13:38.540]  We post a video showing none of the beheading but talking about it and they block the video on our Prison Planet Live channel that gets millions of views a week.
[02:13:40.948 --> 02:13:42.249]  And that's just automated.
[02:13:42.889 --> 02:13:47.670]  So we can't decry ISIS and show no violence, but talk about how horrible they are.
[02:13:47.931 --> 02:13:56.153]  But ISIS can run around recruiting, and they're popping up at the White House, they're popping up in Ferguson, they send us threats, and we go, and it's like major sites.
[02:13:56.894 --> 02:13:57.954]  Totally globalist run.
[02:13:57.974 --> 02:13:59.875]  I mean, let me tell you something, I've had enough.
[02:14:00.955 --> 02:14:04.336]  Some guy with a turban and a big beard wants to cut my head off, buddy.
[02:14:04.897 --> 02:14:06.017]  I mean, I'm getting sick of it.
[02:14:07.725 --> 02:14:25.399]  And I'm really getting sick of how it's in the news today, and then I'm going to your calls, I'm going to cover this if we go to calls, that they're saying the number one terror threat is domestic groups, Al Qaeda, or any Muslim extremist is not listed in the new FBI yearly report.
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:26.840]  It doesn't exist now.
[02:14:27.181 --> 02:14:37.129]  Because it's a real threat, running around with black flags, killing hundreds of thousands of Christians, and then they're going to let these nuts come in here, who are killing non-radical Muslims everywhere as well,
[02:14:38.590 --> 02:14:42.814]  And blow stuff up, and then they'll use the NSA and the armored vehicles on the Tea Party.
[02:14:43.334 --> 02:14:44.075]  Which is now admitted.
[02:14:44.335 --> 02:14:46.096]  I told you all these years ago this would happen.
[02:14:46.316 --> 02:14:54.143]  And now because of ISIS threats, and the Russia thing, Obama has run back to the White House, so that if there is an attack, it doesn't look like he was being lazy.
[02:14:54.163 --> 02:14:59.247]  Let me tell you, and I've warned you, when Obama goes off his vacation, you better watch out.
[02:14:59.908 --> 02:15:05.672]  Because something big's about to happen, and he's got to be there when they make the big announcement, like the fake Bin Laden raid.
[02:15:06.153 --> 02:15:07.274]  He went off vacation for that.
[02:15:08.601 --> 02:15:11.662]  Announce it on Sunday night to dominate the entire news cycle.
[02:15:11.983 --> 02:15:13.823]  They're getting ready to pull something big.
[02:15:14.164 --> 02:15:15.824]  Kissinger just rose his ugly head.
[02:15:15.844 --> 02:15:18.606]  I mean, it's just, these people are out of control.
[02:15:19.386 --> 02:15:22.247]  Look at Dianne Feinstein strutting around with him.
[02:15:22.447 --> 02:15:24.408]  I'll tell you what marks the globalists.
[02:15:24.448 --> 02:15:27.170]  I don't care if they're Barack Obama or Al Gore.
[02:15:28.050 --> 02:15:32.734]  Or any of them, is the arrogance and the enjoyment of being in front of people.
[02:15:33.154 --> 02:15:34.535]  Let me tell you, I want to be fishing.
[02:15:35.196 --> 02:15:36.357]  I want to go visit Europe.
[02:15:36.717 --> 02:15:38.258]  I want to go spend time with my children.
[02:15:38.559 --> 02:15:39.559]  I want to oil paint.
[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:41.841]  I do not want to be up here at Grandstanding.
[02:15:42.061 --> 02:15:43.162]  I don't get a thrill out of it.
[02:15:44.063 --> 02:15:50.388]  But I realize people go with big studios and sports jackets and people that look healthy and so I'm getting, I'm going that direction.
[02:15:50.668 --> 02:15:52.290]  Just to get the message out and beat these people.
[02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:53.931]  But I never wanted to be on air.
[02:15:54.251 --> 02:15:56.033]  I wanted to be a land management rancher.
[02:15:57.017 --> 02:15:58.218]  I like to be outside.
[02:15:58.258 --> 02:15:59.798]  I like to shoot guns.
[02:16:00.979 --> 02:16:04.861]  But I've been forced to cope against the New World Order because they're so dangerous.
[02:16:05.641 --> 02:16:07.102]  And because I will not be their slave.
[02:16:07.963 --> 02:16:10.784]  And I hope you share that vision with me to be free.
[02:16:11.104 --> 02:16:13.546]  Thank you for holding, Chris, and then Chris.
[02:16:13.586 --> 02:16:15.707]  Let's go to Chris in Georgia, then Chris in Indiana.
[02:16:15.727 --> 02:16:16.367]  Thank you for holding.
[02:16:16.667 --> 02:16:17.388]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:16:17.428 --> 02:16:17.768]  Go ahead.
[02:16:18.868 --> 02:16:19.629]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:20.089 --> 02:16:25.892]  The Oded Yinnan Agreement from 1982, Israel, bears out
[02:16:27.052 --> 02:16:27.493]  I'm good.
[02:16:41.949 --> 02:16:46.572]  No, listen, listen, I agree with you that there's been a lot of ethnic battles going on there.
[02:16:47.593 --> 02:16:50.794]  The folks that went in bombed stuff to overthrow the British government there.
[02:16:51.235 --> 02:16:54.036]  There was a vacuum with the Turkish Empire collapsing.
[02:16:54.917 --> 02:16:57.518]  The remnants of the old Ottoman Empire collapsing.
[02:16:58.159 --> 02:17:01.701]  And in that vacuum came folks that wanted their own state.
[02:17:01.741 --> 02:17:02.762]  They wanted to be in Russia.
[02:17:03.922 --> 02:17:27.065]  uh... in eastern southern russia but instead they were exiled basically by the by the nazis and by the communists and sent down there in the Rothschilds bankrolled it so that's absolutely true my point is though no one wants to talk about ISIS killing hundreds of thousands of Christians it's like they don't matter it's only Palestine I mean Egypt won't take the Palestinians Jordan won't take them
[02:17:28.486 --> 02:17:31.727]  So what I'm saying is, I'm not against the Palestinians.
[02:17:32.287 --> 02:17:36.109]  I'm just not lined up to obsess on Israel all day.
[02:17:36.529 --> 02:17:39.610]  I mean, I don't go to churches that harp on Israel and worship Israel.
[02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:41.550]  I mean, you talk about vomiting.
[02:17:41.570 --> 02:17:43.551]  Man, I'm sick of hearing about Israel.
[02:17:44.351 --> 02:17:49.413]  And I'm sick of how it's all one-dimensional, the debates about it, when it's so incredibly complex.
[02:17:49.673 --> 02:17:49.953]  Go ahead.
[02:17:51.049 --> 02:17:54.192]  Yeah, but the thing is, you just, you keep missing something.
[02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:56.894]  For one thing, I've never heard you talk about Zionism.
[02:17:57.675 --> 02:17:59.056]  And Alex, you've got a great show.
[02:17:59.116 --> 02:18:03.561]  I mean, I'm a good piece of my... I'm 57 years old.
[02:18:03.601 --> 02:18:05.703]  Well, you know why I don't talk about Zionism?
[02:18:05.723 --> 02:18:07.344]  Because I work for Israel, man!
[02:18:07.364 --> 02:18:11.848]  I get a paycheck every day from Benjamin Netanyahu.
[02:18:12.068 --> 02:18:12.729]  Come on, Alex.
[02:18:12.809 --> 02:18:14.250]  I'm not going like that.
[02:18:14.631 --> 02:18:15.492]  Listen, I don't care.
[02:18:15.512 --> 02:18:16.793]  I'm going to explain something to you.
[02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:19.151]  It's like an allergic response.
[02:18:19.291 --> 02:18:26.555]  I've been attacked by the federal Nazis and the globalists and all these groups so much and claim that I'm a shill of Israel that I don't care.
[02:18:26.895 --> 02:18:27.335]  You understand?
[02:18:27.575 --> 02:18:28.936]  I don't like a lot of stuff Israel does.
[02:18:29.657 --> 02:18:31.958]  The people that attack Israel want to blow it up.
[02:18:34.016 --> 02:18:37.540]  Literally hate me and are usually socialists and hate the fact that I own guns.
[02:18:38.682 --> 02:18:42.266]  So what I'm getting at here is I don't, I'm not involved in it.
[02:18:43.067 --> 02:18:45.370]  I'm sad that a couple thousand Palestinians died.
[02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:46.070]  Okay?
[02:18:46.291 --> 02:18:46.811]  I really do.
[02:18:46.831 --> 02:18:49.294]  I like families and little kids and people.
[02:18:49.955 --> 02:19:10.683]  You have to understand though, I'm even more concerned about over 100,000 non-radical Muslims and over 200,000 plus Christians murdered by the precious little jihadis that when I criticize Al Qaeda, I have leftists sending me threatening emails going, they're part of a revolution as well, you, you know, you Jew, blah, blah, blah, we want to kill your family.
[02:19:11.143 --> 02:19:12.103]  I am sick of it!
[02:19:12.203 --> 02:19:13.224]  I'm not Jewish!
[02:19:13.684 --> 02:19:16.945]  But I'm not going to run from that label, so I am Jewish, is my point.
[02:19:17.325 --> 02:19:17.906]  I am Jewish.
[02:19:18.286 --> 02:19:19.227]  I work for the Rothschilds.
[02:19:19.707 --> 02:19:20.388]  Use those clips.
[02:19:20.868 --> 02:19:21.148]  Okay?
[02:19:21.609 --> 02:19:22.069]  I don't care.
[02:19:22.109 --> 02:19:22.910]  Take them out of context.
[02:19:22.930 --> 02:19:23.871]  Of course, I'm not Jewish.
[02:19:24.091 --> 02:19:25.092]  I don't work for the Rothschilds.
[02:19:25.272 --> 02:19:26.473]  Never got a red cent from Israel.
[02:19:26.713 --> 02:19:27.594]  It's all lies.
[02:19:27.854 --> 02:19:34.960]  So what I'm telling you is the cause celeb, the thing I'm told to obsess about Israel all day, isn't happening.
[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:37.062]  I'll come back to you and let you finish, then go to other callers.
[02:19:37.082 --> 02:19:37.902]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:19:39.383 --> 02:19:42.326]  It's like when people call me, it's the same thing with the Vatican bashers.
[02:19:42.686 --> 02:19:44.007]  I criticize the Vatican all day.
[02:19:44.788 --> 02:19:45.569]  I made a film
[02:19:46.698 --> 02:19:50.021]  About Israel attacking the USS Liberty to blame it on Egypt and start a war.
[02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:53.984]  And the Jew-bashers said it was a whitewash for Israel.
[02:19:54.645 --> 02:20:00.910]  Well, I don't make films like that to impress the Nazis and show them how cool I am.
[02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:04.232]  I make films about false flag because I have integrity.
[02:20:04.953 --> 02:20:05.273]  Okay?
[02:20:05.733 --> 02:20:09.977]  I expose Israel selling prisoners' organs and stuff because it's wrong not to kiss your butt.

[02:23:11.573 --> 02:23:13.194]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[02:23:13.354 --> 02:23:15.496]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[02:23:15.816 --> 02:23:17.177]  And your rights are at risk.

[02:24:16.095 --> 02:24:18.176]  Look, I shouldn't have gone off on Chris from Georgia.
[02:24:18.236 --> 02:24:23.020]  I should let him make his point and then go to Chris in Indiana and Habu and everybody else.
[02:24:24.521 --> 02:24:25.221]  Here's the issue.
[02:24:26.042 --> 02:24:27.242]  I have integrity.
[02:24:27.383 --> 02:24:28.703]  I cover real news.
[02:24:29.664 --> 02:24:30.585]  I try to tell the truth.
[02:24:30.645 --> 02:24:31.665]  I make mistakes sometimes.
[02:24:32.946 --> 02:24:37.910]  And people perseverate on Israel.
[02:24:38.330 --> 02:24:39.671]  We'll have an article about
[02:24:41.271 --> 02:25:03.615]  A dollar devaluation, or an article about NSA surveillance, or an article about Governor Rick Perry can't own guns now because he's been indicted, and like half the comments sometimes, and we can go check, a lot of times it's the same person, but other times it's like five people, are crazily going, ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju, and I mean, it's after a point.
[02:25:05.255 --> 02:25:10.416]  And it was the most beautiful song in the world, after I'd heard it 50,000 times, I'd vomit if I heard it again.
[02:25:11.613 --> 02:25:15.655]  I think it's some type of cognitive infiltration thing, because I know Cass Sunstein talked about that.
[02:25:16.975 --> 02:25:21.137]  Putting things out so much that then people just get turned off by it.
[02:25:21.157 --> 02:25:26.759]  Almost like inoculating people against it, where there can be no real debate going on because everything's so polarized.
[02:25:28.174 --> 02:25:30.415]  And I always ask people when they call, and they go, what about Israel?
[02:25:30.575 --> 02:25:31.395]  What about Zionists?
[02:25:31.936 --> 02:25:38.859]  I go, okay, yeah, I think Israel's doing some pretty bad things, but it's in the face of people saying, we're gonna kill all of you, too.
[02:25:39.399 --> 02:25:44.301]  And I understand you can say, well, Israel came in and blew up people and killed them and drove them out.
[02:25:44.361 --> 02:25:45.162]  Well, that did go on.
[02:25:46.942 --> 02:25:50.144]  It's just that I don't have a dog in that fight.
[02:25:51.645 --> 02:25:56.807]  And compared to tens of thousands of Libyans every few months being killed by Al-Qaeda forces our government put in,
[02:25:58.433 --> 02:26:02.614]  Or Netanyahu saying, yeah, I kind of like what ISIS is doing.
[02:26:02.634 --> 02:26:05.255]  And that was in the Jerusalem Post that, let's let ISIS operate.
[02:26:06.756 --> 02:26:10.117]  That's very immoral to say it'll destabilize the Arabs and our enemies.
[02:26:10.157 --> 02:26:10.617]  Let's be for it.
[02:26:11.077 --> 02:26:12.277]  Assad was doing nothing!
[02:26:12.657 --> 02:26:13.177]  Iraq!
[02:26:14.998 --> 02:26:17.999]  That's because Israel's secretly allied with Saudi Arabia, folks.
[02:26:18.799 --> 02:26:23.981]  That's how you go after Benjamin Netanyahu, who I don't have some personal hatred for.
[02:26:25.925 --> 02:26:39.837]  I have reasoned research where no one in Israel should support Benjamin Netanyahu or Obama or anybody else when they are tacitly protecting Al Qaeda.
[02:26:39.977 --> 02:26:43.760]  That's why they're being bombed now, because people turned against it in Israel and the U.S.
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:50.025]  You don't get Israel to listen to what you're saying, screaming about how Jews secretly drink people's blood at midnight.
[02:26:50.105 --> 02:26:53.248]  I mean, it's just, it's meant to balkanize people.
[02:26:53.708 --> 02:26:54.769]  It's divide and conquer.
[02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:58.229]  It's really that simple.
[02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:05.631]  And I have had no group lie about me more than the self-righteous Israel haters.
[02:27:09.012 --> 02:27:14.054]  And it's like a bullying on our website, bash Israel, attack Israel, go after Israel.
[02:27:15.494 --> 02:27:24.057]  And then one of our writers will write something critical of Israel and they'll just swarm in, oh you Jew lovers, you're trying to cover up, we're gonna kill you too when we take over.
[02:27:26.158 --> 02:27:28.080]  And I mean, I don't want to be associated with that.
[02:27:29.161 --> 02:27:30.442]  That's not who I am.
[02:27:31.403 --> 02:27:32.765]  I'm not obsessed with Israel.
[02:27:33.746 --> 02:27:34.927]  I don't want war with Russia.
[02:27:35.167 --> 02:27:36.148]  I don't want war with China.
[02:27:36.409 --> 02:27:37.269]  I want free market.
[02:27:37.329 --> 02:27:38.270]  I want prosperity.
[02:27:38.851 --> 02:27:44.257]  I want to hang around with people that have cool ideas and are inventors, and I don't care what color they are.
[02:27:45.318 --> 02:27:47.860]  But see, everything's dumbed down to this stuff, so you would think Israel
[02:27:49.215 --> 02:27:54.238]  And the 2,000 Palestinians and the 100 or whatever Israelis that just died is the center of the universe.
[02:27:54.419 --> 02:27:59.282]  And it's almost, it's not almost, in the Christian Zionist circles, it is.
[02:28:00.663 --> 02:28:01.503]  Israel worship.
[02:28:02.544 --> 02:28:06.187]  And even if you hate something, but obsess on it, you're worshiping it.
[02:28:07.828 --> 02:28:17.614]  That's why I don't even like bashing the New World Order, because I want to transcend them with just ideas that are so good for freedom and prosperity that people just leave this system.
[02:28:17.794 --> 02:28:18.395]  It will fall.
[02:28:20.083 --> 02:28:26.906]  When you put names on it like it's the Jews, or it's the Catholics, or it's the Masons, or it's the... There's diverse people in all those groups.
[02:28:26.966 --> 02:28:36.330]  Or it's the Russians, or it's the... It's the Muslims, it's the... You then allow these political leaders to be kingpins over each political subdivision.
[02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:43.594]  And they don't want the political subdivisions to be about where there's more freedom, where there's more prosperity, where there's smarter people.
[02:28:43.815 --> 02:28:44.755]  Everybody migrates that.
[02:28:44.775 --> 02:28:49.679]  They want it to be about, ah, we're raising your taxes because the neighbor's an enemy and we want to kill them.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:53.642]  And really, the president's just making money off of a defense stock they own.
[02:28:55.644 --> 02:28:57.805]  I've never, and I'm going to go to break and come back with the calls.
[02:28:57.866 --> 02:28:59.026]  I promise I'll get to all of you.
[02:28:59.066 --> 02:28:59.927]  You've been holding forever.
[02:28:59.967 --> 02:29:01.989]  It's just that these are heavy subjects being brought up.
[02:29:04.295 --> 02:29:05.315]  People aren't stupid.
[02:29:05.355 --> 02:29:08.677]  They've been taught how to be dumb and think real one-dimensional.
[02:29:10.418 --> 02:29:12.599]  And I'm trying to get people to think outside the box.
[02:29:12.639 --> 02:29:15.980]  It doesn't even mean I've got all the answers.
[02:29:18.581 --> 02:29:22.483]  It's just that people call me and go, yeah, what do you think about the Vatican, Alex?
[02:29:22.503 --> 02:29:23.463]  Let's talk about that.
[02:29:25.284 --> 02:29:32.948]  And I do talk about the Vatican when it calls for world government or says space aliens are real or, you know, calls for a European Union expansion.
[02:29:32.988 --> 02:29:33.328]  I mean, I do.
[02:29:35.908 --> 02:29:37.930]  Well, why don't you talk about the Federal Reserve being private?
[02:29:37.970 --> 02:29:42.835]  It's like this little mental game where, why didn't you cover Bill Gates and eugenics?
[02:29:43.075 --> 02:29:43.695]  It's like, what?
[02:29:45.297 --> 02:29:46.798]  I don't want to make it about me.
[02:29:47.299 --> 02:29:50.802]  You can call in and talk about Zionism if you want.
[02:29:51.042 --> 02:29:53.424]  It doesn't need to start with, why don't you talk about it?
[02:29:54.245 --> 02:29:55.166]  Why don't I talk about it?
[02:29:55.586 --> 02:29:57.328]  Man, I am, I heard this record.
[02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:01.404]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.444 --> 02:30:02.225]  We'll go to your calls.
[02:30:02.745 --> 02:30:04.506]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.646 --> 02:30:05.866]  This is a heavy subject.
[02:30:09.988 --> 02:30:15.951]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:30:16.151 --> 02:30:20.353]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:30:20.713 --> 02:30:25.275]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:25.675 --> 02:30:28.296]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:30:28.616 --> 02:30:33.778]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:30:34.059 --> 02:30:40.941]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:30:41.442 --> 02:30:45.203]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:30:45.583 --> 02:30:50.365]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:50.686 --> 02:30:51.546]  This is innovating.
[02:30:51.826 --> 02:30:59.130]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:30:59.150 --> 02:31:03.372]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:31:09.395 --> 02:31:16.460]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:18.702]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:18.902 --> 02:31:23.985]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:24.185 --> 02:31:29.129]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:29.329 --> 02:31:32.392]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:32.652 --> 02:31:36.516]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:36.736 --> 02:31:40.979]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:41.060 --> 02:31:51.108]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:51.289 --> 02:31:53.811]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:54.131 --> 02:32:02.058]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:32:43.834 --> 02:32:48.457]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:32:48.577 --> 02:32:49.578]  Talk about the effects.
[02:32:49.918 --> 02:32:51.399]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:32:51.419 --> 02:32:53.041]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:32:53.341 --> 02:32:54.402]  I feel like I look better.
[02:32:54.442 --> 02:32:55.122]  I feel better.
[02:32:55.162 --> 02:32:56.203]  I feel sexier.
[02:32:56.223 --> 02:32:56.964]  I love it.

[02:33:07.753 --> 02:33:08.714]  This is life changing.

[02:33:21.696 --> 02:33:28.540]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:34.843]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.543 --> 02:33:42.247]  Larry Klainman, the former head of Judicial Watch, is going to join us talking about the IRS persecution, but also a new Judicial Watch report.
[02:33:42.347 --> 02:33:46.449]  Feds bulge and describe threat of imminent terrorist attack on the southern border.
[02:33:48.311 --> 02:33:55.838]  Yeah, and Obama will use that then to totally federalize it and conduit even more people in, claiming he's trying to stop terrorists.
[02:33:55.918 --> 02:33:59.141]  I mean, ISIS is operating in this country.
[02:33:59.862 --> 02:34:01.123]  They're all over the place.
[02:34:03.145 --> 02:34:10.331]  We've gone from this 13-year war to eradicate Al-Qaeda to it's bigger and stronger than ever because the criminals running our government gave them the weapons.
[02:34:11.092 --> 02:34:13.855]  But no one wants to talk about radical Islam.
[02:34:15.310 --> 02:34:21.513]  It's now being turned loose to create the class of civilizations that will crush the majority of non-radical Muslims.
[02:34:21.573 --> 02:34:22.233]  That's the plan.
[02:34:23.113 --> 02:34:31.217]  Along with the West, the globalists will play us off against each other like the two Siamese fighting fish from Russia would love.
[02:34:31.237 --> 02:34:32.637]  Remember that clip?
[02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:35.238]  Gotta cue that back up.
[02:34:37.499 --> 02:34:38.560]  You can see the setup.
[02:34:40.674 --> 02:34:43.476]  We gotta have the NSA, we gotta have all the C-terrorists.
[02:34:43.856 --> 02:34:45.578]  Yeah, terrorists you protected!
[02:34:46.578 --> 02:34:47.939]  It's so transparent.
[02:34:49.681 --> 02:34:53.263]  But you would think all that exists in the world... Here's what I'm sick of.
[02:34:55.545 --> 02:35:01.229]  And the Israel bashers are probably two or three times what the Catholic bashers are.
[02:35:01.849 --> 02:35:02.490]  But I've noticed
[02:35:04.878 --> 02:35:12.645]  A lot of times it's the pro-Israel folks that are trying to make it a conspiracy about the Vatican, and then some of the Vatican people trying to make it about Israel.
[02:35:12.905 --> 02:35:14.847]  So there's an old fight going on there.
[02:35:15.648 --> 02:35:16.648]  Catholic and Jews.
[02:35:16.709 --> 02:35:17.369]  Well, I'm neither.
[02:35:17.389 --> 02:35:20.031]  I was brought up a Protestant.
[02:35:20.092 --> 02:35:20.692]  I'm a Christian.
[02:35:20.812 --> 02:35:22.133]  I just have a relationship with Christ.
[02:35:23.455 --> 02:35:25.817]  And I just understand the sociology, the anthropology.
[02:35:28.254 --> 02:35:34.615]  And I'm just sick of opening up an article about Rick Perry can't buy guns, and it's just Jew, Jew, Jew, Alex is a Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
[02:35:34.835 --> 02:35:43.557]  Can you imagine how I feel when the people that hate Israel are so mindless and horrible on average?
[02:35:44.297 --> 02:35:53.139]  How do you think that makes people that want to legitimately criticize the Israeli lobby, who I do not like foreign lobbies, messing with our government?
[02:35:53.439 --> 02:35:56.380]  I have real issues with Israel messing with our sovereignty,
[02:35:57.441 --> 02:35:58.342]  Doing things like that.
[02:35:59.102 --> 02:36:02.865]  I have major issues with espionage, just like I do with the communist Chinese or others.
[02:36:04.546 --> 02:36:07.588]  But those are legitimate articles we put out that really do.
[02:36:07.628 --> 02:36:11.831]  Like, well, why is Israel's government tacitly supporting IS?
[02:36:11.971 --> 02:36:12.451]  Well, why?
[02:36:12.471 --> 02:36:14.813]  And I don't put that out to attack Israel.
[02:36:15.073 --> 02:36:16.634]  I put it out for sanity's sake.
[02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:17.795]  And what's going on?
[02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:19.556]  Why is our government starting war with Russia?
[02:36:23.504 --> 02:36:28.385]  A man of many perversions, federal cyber security head, convicted of child porn charges.
[02:36:30.025 --> 02:36:33.326]  The following story is a warning to why centralized power is so dangerous.
[02:36:39.607 --> 02:36:42.908]  I mean, all the time they're busting high-level Homeland Security people when they're child molesters.
[02:36:44.028 --> 02:36:46.848]  The mid-level and low-level, they really never do, because they're not.
[02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:49.709]  It's those key controller-level people.
[02:36:51.118 --> 02:36:52.280]  That the globalists don't put in.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:53.942]  You know, here's what I'm getting at.
[02:36:54.402 --> 02:36:56.365]  I've studied what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[02:36:57.707 --> 02:37:01.092]  There are WASP mafias and Chinese triad mafias and...
[02:37:02.881 --> 02:37:13.867]  Japanese mafias and Russian mafias and German mafias and Irish mafias and Mexican mafias and Brazilian mafias and Protestant mafias and Catholic mafias.
[02:37:14.468 --> 02:37:16.329]  Humans organize into gangs.
[02:37:17.109 --> 02:37:18.590]  Police are the biggest street gang out there.
[02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:20.311]  Is it a good gang or a bad gang?
[02:37:20.591 --> 02:37:22.212]  Well, that depends on who runs the police, doesn't it?
[02:37:24.923 --> 02:37:26.024]  That's the thing about anarchy.
[02:37:26.064 --> 02:37:30.287]  If there wasn't a big gang in town, there'd be some other big gang in town.
[02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:32.269]  See, this is human nature.
[02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:40.295]  So it better be our big gang that's honorable and has chivalry, not somebody else's gang that's based on predatory activity.
[02:37:40.615 --> 02:37:41.496]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:37:43.838 --> 02:37:51.784]  And so I am for a fraternity of liberty that transcends race, religion, creed, you name it,
[02:37:52.642 --> 02:38:07.691]  Where you don't aggress against people that haven't aggress against you, you believe in property, you believe in sovereignty, you believe in rights, as long as it doesn't hurt somebody else, that builds wealth, that builds starships, that builds the future.
[02:38:08.491 --> 02:38:10.432]  I just really have goodwill towards everybody.
[02:38:10.933 --> 02:38:12.113]  I just really want to win.
[02:38:12.133 --> 02:38:13.254]  I want you to win.
[02:38:13.274 --> 02:38:15.635]  I get satisfied by prosperity.
[02:38:15.975 --> 02:38:20.018]  I just feel so good that I have some friends and people that I know I could
[02:38:21.038 --> 02:38:32.085]  Go to jail for 10 years and give them a million dollars and get out of jail in 10 years and they would fight to keep that money and they would not cheat me.
[02:38:32.165 --> 02:38:48.256]  That's what value is and it's not just that they would, you know, or Colonel Travis giving, you know, his son to my mom's family to raise because they were known as the most honorable people in Texas and it started the revolution and been the treasurer until he stepped down because he didn't want to be involved in it.
[02:38:50.202 --> 02:38:50.562]  Heirs.
[02:38:51.904 --> 02:38:54.806]  It's not just that Colonel Travis would trust my family.
[02:38:57.088 --> 02:38:59.230]  That's just a small microcosm example.
[02:38:59.931 --> 02:39:01.752]  It is the trusting.
[02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:03.374]  It is the honorableness.
[02:39:04.314 --> 02:39:05.676]  That is my value.
[02:39:05.776 --> 02:39:06.777]  That is my wealth.
[02:39:06.877 --> 02:39:07.878]  That is who I am.
[02:39:08.158 --> 02:39:09.339]  That is my family name.
[02:39:09.839 --> 02:39:12.482]  I thought growing up everybody was like my family.
[02:39:13.222 --> 02:39:17.046]  Straight, and strong, and honorable, and hardworking, and tough.
[02:39:18.857 --> 02:39:21.060]  I didn't know that a lot of people weren't like that.
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:21.760]  You understand that?
[02:39:22.541 --> 02:39:25.345]  And that's why I don't like people claiming I'm a Russian agent.
[02:39:27.387 --> 02:39:28.508]  Major media figures.
[02:39:29.049 --> 02:39:30.250]  I could sue them, I could win.
[02:39:30.651 --> 02:39:33.915]  MSNBC saying I'm behind the Boston bombing and deeply racist.
[02:39:35.657 --> 02:39:38.380]  When I was younger, if somebody said that in my face, I'd break their nose.
[02:39:42.142 --> 02:39:45.983]  I am sick of people making stuff up like it's reality.
[02:39:46.003 --> 02:39:53.066]  And it's not that it even hurts me, it's that you're so dishonorable and so pathetic that it makes me want to throw up!
[02:39:54.246 --> 02:39:57.007]  I'm mad at you because you're such cowards!
[02:39:57.487 --> 02:39:59.348]  I'm mad at you because you're so weak!
[02:40:00.028 --> 02:40:01.888]  And it makes me see how weak I am!
[02:40:01.988 --> 02:40:03.049]  I know how weak I am!
[02:40:03.309 --> 02:40:04.169]  I want to be strong!
[02:40:04.369 --> 02:40:05.229]  I want to be a winner!
[02:40:05.530 --> 02:40:07.350]  I want to find the lever to turn things around!
[02:40:07.570 --> 02:40:08.631]  I want to turn the tide!
[02:40:08.851 --> 02:40:09.571]  I want to win!
[02:40:10.865 --> 02:40:12.186]  Because it's about my children.
[02:40:12.206 --> 02:40:16.390]  And I'll tell you something else, I can feel my ancestors.
[02:40:16.991 --> 02:40:22.416]  The giant genetic variety of everything they strove to do and those genetic memories.
[02:40:22.837 --> 02:40:31.745]  And this morning I was driving to work and I was just literally just basking in the instincts and the memories and just all of them and how strong they were.
[02:40:32.686 --> 02:40:33.847]  And the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:40:33.887 --> 02:40:36.169]  It was just like, my God, this is incredible.
[02:40:36.489 --> 02:40:42.114]  Consciousness on this planet and the people that merged over and over again to bring me to this point.
[02:40:42.514 --> 02:40:51.181]  I just want to get the ball across the line for humanity and not run around about blacks or Mexicans or Jews or Catholics or this or that.
[02:40:51.922 --> 02:40:57.567]  Just come together for freedom, no matter what color you are, and the enemy will vaporize.
[02:41:00.592 --> 02:41:05.236]  The enemy could be black, it could be Jewish, it could be German, it could be Chinese.
[02:41:05.576 --> 02:41:10.580]  It's people that manipulate and want control and are haters and want to hurt people.
[02:41:12.582 --> 02:41:14.203]  The only people I want to hurt is them.
[02:41:15.264 --> 02:41:20.789]  And that's why they're always stirring stuff up because they know they can get good people to do bad things once they've started wars.
[02:41:21.109 --> 02:41:25.553]  It's important to look past who they're trying to get us to start a war with and look at who's starting the war.
[02:41:25.813 --> 02:41:26.494]  I am sick.
[02:41:28.493 --> 02:41:33.475]  It'd be like watching a kid, a mean kid, to a new kid that comes to school go, hey, shake my hand.
[02:41:33.515 --> 02:41:34.356]  They pull their hand back.
[02:41:35.156 --> 02:41:36.316]  Or, hey, you got something on your shirt?
[02:41:36.336 --> 02:41:37.157]  Then do it to your nose.
[02:41:37.537 --> 02:41:38.517]  My kids did that to me once.
[02:41:38.597 --> 02:41:40.558]  I was just like, why you look so angry?
[02:41:40.578 --> 02:41:49.582]  I said, because that's something people do to be mean and to say I'm unfaithful and to take someone's goodwill and like opening a door for a lady and then tripping her down the stairs.
[02:41:50.743 --> 02:41:56.685]  I had a newspaper reporter one time when my wife was pregnant with our first child who'd stalked me and harassed me and lied about me.
[02:41:57.186 --> 02:41:57.746]  Show up!
[02:41:59.167 --> 02:42:27.747]  At a movie theater for a premiere of a film that I've been invited to, and there was Quentin Tarantino there looking at me hatefully in the crowd and the rest of it, and I never told this story before, and we walk up to those big giant stairs at the old Ritz, what was called Alamo, the original Alamo, it's now Nationwide, and that guy sat there and tried to trip my wife down the stairs, then laughed, and I looked, and they had the other newspaper reporter there with a pad that I was about to physically attack him, and she walked up, she said, how dare you not break that guy's neck, and I said,
[02:42:28.547 --> 02:42:31.108]  I said, you didn't fall, I caught you, that was a setup.
[02:42:31.948 --> 02:42:39.450]  Let me tell you, that reporter is a nobody, piece of crap, loser, excuse my French, but I'll tell you something about him.
[02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:45.171]  He doesn't work for black ops, he doesn't work for the CIA, he doesn't work, he doesn't need to be taught dirty tricks.
[02:42:45.391 --> 02:42:47.171]  It's a spirit of evil.
[02:42:48.312 --> 02:42:49.592]  A spirit of jealousy.
[02:42:51.423 --> 02:42:52.464]  I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:42:53.105 --> 02:42:54.486]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[02:42:54.566 --> 02:43:00.752]  It's that men without honor tell men of honor that they're a fraud.
[02:43:00.812 --> 02:43:01.913]  No, I'm not a fraud.
[02:43:01.933 --> 02:43:05.556]  I am wicked in my flesh, but my heart is good.
[02:43:06.117 --> 02:43:09.200]  And I, by all yardsticks, am a very moral person.
[02:43:10.321 --> 02:43:13.844]  And I try to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.
[02:43:14.909 --> 02:43:18.293]  And that's why I'm sick of the dumbing down out there.
[02:43:18.753 --> 02:43:21.015]  The mindlessness of all of this, okay?
[02:43:21.356 --> 02:43:22.457]  I'm not a Russian agent.
[02:43:22.517 --> 02:43:23.678]  I'm not an Israeli agent.
[02:43:23.938 --> 02:43:25.500]  I'm not a Catholic agent.
[02:43:26.301 --> 02:43:28.243]  I'm not a white supremacist agent.
[02:43:28.363 --> 02:43:29.444]  I'm not any of these things.
[02:43:29.584 --> 02:43:30.806]  I'm an agent of liberty.
[02:43:31.446 --> 02:43:32.587]  I'm an agent of freedom.
[02:43:33.308 --> 02:43:34.569]  I'm an agent of justice.
[02:43:35.329 --> 02:43:41.613]  I'm somebody that wants to uphold my family name, not because it's some cheesy old saying, but now as a man, I know what that means.
[02:43:41.633 --> 02:43:49.138]  It means I come from good people, and I'm gonna die a good person, and it doesn't matter what they put in the newspaper or what they make up about me.
[02:43:49.558 --> 02:44:00.005]  I know I love God, and I know I want justice, and that's what matters, and that's why evil men hate me, because all those that love death hate God.
[02:44:00.865 --> 02:44:02.706]  And if we love God, they hate us.
[02:44:02.726 --> 02:44:04.487]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:44:04.527 --> 02:44:05.927]  Chris, go ahead and tell us about the Zionist.
[02:44:10.990 --> 02:44:11.370]  Go ahead!
[02:44:13.431 --> 02:44:19.253]  Well, you know, I'm not accusing you of being working for the Zionist or anything.
[02:44:19.273 --> 02:44:22.014]  I don't know why you do what you do.
[02:44:22.575 --> 02:44:25.416]  Can you get off the headset so we can hear you or I'll be accused of censoring you.
[02:44:25.736 --> 02:44:27.337]  Can you get off the headset?
[02:44:28.371 --> 02:44:28.991]  No, I'm off.
[02:44:29.071 --> 02:44:31.152]  I've got two seconds to get off the highway.
[02:44:31.212 --> 02:44:32.112]  I started driving again.
[02:44:32.172 --> 02:44:33.032]  I thought I was cut off.
[02:44:33.412 --> 02:44:35.273]  I'm not accusing you of being a Zionist.
[02:44:35.953 --> 02:44:37.313]  I don't know why you do what you do.
[02:44:37.393 --> 02:44:40.874]  I just think that there's some missing... You're missing something.
[02:44:40.894 --> 02:44:42.094]  Maybe you don't know.
[02:44:43.275 --> 02:44:48.176]  Israel was set up from the beginning as a state to ethnic cleanse the Palestinians out of there.
[02:44:48.849 --> 02:44:50.310]  I mean, that's just basic facts.
[02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:55.633]  Yeah, and there are people moving into areas, colonizing it, and kicking the natives out everywhere.
[02:44:56.013 --> 02:45:08.500]  And I'm not saying that's good, but no one cares when the UN lines up three or four thousand Africans in the Congo for a UN treaty and shoots them, and burns down their village for a carbon sink.
[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:12.142]  Well, Jews didn't do that!
[02:45:12.242 --> 02:45:17.365]  I mean, what I'm saying is, is that... No, do you understand 2,000 Palestinians being killed is terrible?
[02:45:18.442 --> 02:45:23.005]  Do you get hundreds of thousands of Christians being killed by the precious Muslim extremists?
[02:45:24.886 --> 02:45:26.648]  I understand that there are priorities.
[02:45:26.768 --> 02:45:28.409]  I mean, there's other things going on in the world.
[02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:30.450]  I'm not that unsophisticated.
[02:45:30.690 --> 02:45:31.031]  Exactly.
[02:45:31.051 --> 02:45:33.152]  We got Putin basically threatening nuclear war.
[02:45:33.172 --> 02:45:36.074]  We're not going to be talking about Israel.
[02:45:36.094 --> 02:45:37.835]  This is a subject I called in on.
[02:45:37.975 --> 02:45:38.216]  No, no.
[02:45:38.256 --> 02:45:38.496]  I know.
[02:45:38.536 --> 02:45:39.216]  I saw it up there.
[02:45:39.256 --> 02:45:40.837]  I saw it said Zionists and I went to you.
[02:45:40.897 --> 02:45:43.799]  We don't screen your calls unless it's on a specific topic.
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:45.621]  There's a YouTube.
[02:45:45.721 --> 02:45:46.401]  There's a YouTube.
[02:45:46.461 --> 02:45:47.622]  I can't think of the title of it.
[02:45:48.169 --> 02:45:59.376]  It shows just about every Israeli reader, since Golda Meir and Ariel Sharon, all of them, with quotes of the things that they say about Palestinians.
[02:45:59.436 --> 02:46:04.019]  You think of the worst KKK rhetoric against black people in this country.
[02:46:04.599 --> 02:46:10.703]  I will say this, there is a double standard in political correctness, and political correctness is used to control.
[02:46:11.721 --> 02:46:13.722]  That's why Al Sharpton's allowed to say whatever he wants.
[02:46:13.782 --> 02:46:14.463]  No, I get it.
[02:46:15.123 --> 02:46:20.087]  Israel has laws that you can't marry someone who's Jewish if you're there working in the country.
[02:46:21.127 --> 02:46:27.512]  And I don't say that to bash Israel, but they've got laws that haven't been in this country for a hundred years.
[02:46:27.712 --> 02:46:28.612]  I understand that.
[02:46:30.214 --> 02:46:34.777]  So, I mean, we... You understand, I made a film about false flag.
[02:46:34.797 --> 02:46:35.977]  Actually, I made two.
[02:46:36.578 --> 02:46:38.039]  That cover the USS Liberty.
[02:46:39.926 --> 02:46:46.234]  Which was a false flag, but it was a false flag because governments play dirty and do that, not because it was Jews.
[02:46:46.534 --> 02:46:51.540]  See, it's mental illness to say evil people are only Jewish.
[02:46:52.922 --> 02:46:56.626]  If people want to criticize bad stuff Israel's done, that's fine, we should.
[02:46:59.611 --> 02:47:03.375]  It's like saying only a white cop or only a black cop can be racist.
[02:47:03.455 --> 02:47:04.436]  It's just not.
[02:47:04.816 --> 02:47:06.898]  People are people, is what I'm saying.
[02:47:07.799 --> 02:47:12.184]  On average, Jews, and they've got medical studies on this, have very high IQs.
[02:47:12.864 --> 02:47:15.607]  And you can say, well, the IQs test are cultural or whatever.
[02:47:15.887 --> 02:47:16.408]  Sure, whatever.
[02:47:16.868 --> 02:47:17.869]  But proof is in the pudding.
[02:47:18.690 --> 02:47:21.892]  Uh, you've got Northern Europeans that have extremely, just ultra high IQs.
[02:47:21.912 --> 02:47:25.513]  Uh, you've got, uh, Japanese, on average, have very high IQs.
[02:47:25.553 --> 02:47:27.975]  But it's all, it's all like Olympic athletes.
[02:47:27.995 --> 02:47:29.255]  Like, there's more Kenyan runners.
[02:47:29.275 --> 02:47:33.477]  You're only talking about, like, a few percentage points better than somebody from somewhere else.
[02:47:33.537 --> 02:47:36.139]  I mean, all these points are very, very close to each other.
[02:47:36.819 --> 02:47:40.361]  It's just in the averages, though, it's a very complex issue.
[02:47:41.121 --> 02:47:44.024]  So, people don't like folks that have been successful.
[02:47:44.304 --> 02:47:49.209]  Like, I have built this operation on my own, with the help of the listeners, grassroots.
[02:47:49.649 --> 02:47:53.392]  That's why it's done really good in some ways, really bad in others, because it truly is grassroots.
[02:47:54.974 --> 02:47:59.158]  But we don't get the credit for that.
[02:47:59.198 --> 02:48:06.585]  People just say, oh, it was all paid for, it was all blah, blah, blah, because they can't imagine someone else being successful.
[02:48:07.364 --> 02:48:14.786]  So, I would encourage people who want to criticize Israel, I would do it from a serious perspective and really look at it.
[02:48:15.806 --> 02:48:19.387]  And if you're going to cover Israeli atrocities, cover Palestinian atrocities.
[02:48:20.727 --> 02:48:26.988]  I mean, the stuff the Palestinians do, dragging each other around behind motorcycles and running over people, it's just a bunch of tribal butchery.
[02:48:27.508 --> 02:48:29.649]  And the Israelis are in a big tribal war.
[02:48:29.709 --> 02:48:34.250]  It's all a bunch of primitive baloney, with the technocrats behind the scenes pushing the buttons.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.261]  I'm really ranting, I'm sorry.
[02:48:36.621 --> 02:48:39.444]  Chris in Indiana, then we'll go to Bruce and others.
[02:48:39.484 --> 02:48:40.064]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:48:42.787 --> 02:48:49.813]  Yep, I'm here from FEMA Region 5 in South Bend, Indiana, former state of Indiana.
[02:48:50.834 --> 02:48:54.998]  I make it a point of honor to listen to your entire show every day, Alex.
[02:48:55.078 --> 02:48:56.299]  Thanks for putting up with me, brother.
[02:48:56.319 --> 02:49:01.043]  Yeah, and I'd just like to say the clearly filtered water picture
[02:49:01.810 --> 02:49:03.192]  Uh, it's in my fridge right now.
[02:49:03.512 --> 02:49:07.676]  It's amazing how water tastes without all the poisonous flora.
[02:49:07.716 --> 02:49:09.798]  Yeah, it's not supposed to taste like kerosene.
[02:49:11.359 --> 02:49:11.580]  Yeah.
[02:49:12.501 --> 02:49:22.230]  Well, look, I am mad as hell and sick of these right-wing Republicans who think that they are anti-establishment.
[02:49:22.330 --> 02:49:24.733]  And you know the type, the type that
[02:49:25.703 --> 02:49:29.144]  Religiously listen to people like Limbaugh, Hannity, Lars Larson.
[02:49:29.164 --> 02:49:32.645]  I mean, these people are even worse than Obama supporters, if you ask me.
[02:49:32.686 --> 02:49:38.287]  I mean, what good is being pro-gun if you worship the police state in all of these wars?
[02:49:38.868 --> 02:49:39.308]  I agree.
[02:49:39.468 --> 02:49:50.492]  No, no, it's like the Democrats have their segment of evils, Republicans have... It's the neocons, it's the fake conservatives, it's... I mean, the Republicans helped write, with Ezekiel Emanuel, the healthcare bill.
[02:49:51.311 --> 02:49:52.672]  I mean, they should all be impeached!
[02:49:52.992 --> 02:49:54.432]  Why hasn't Obama been impeached?
[02:49:54.733 --> 02:49:56.634]  Or, okay, let's not impeach him, then fine.
[02:49:56.974 --> 02:49:59.015]  Why hasn't Obamacare been repealed?
[02:50:00.836 --> 02:50:02.536]  Because the establishment wants it.
[02:50:03.497 --> 02:50:05.818]  Why hasn't Obama gotten in trouble for opening the borders?
[02:50:06.098 --> 02:50:07.459]  Because the rich Republicans want it.
[02:50:08.259 --> 02:50:09.460]  They want to drive down wages.
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:10.700]  They want to exploit people.
[02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:11.841]  They have bad will.
[02:50:13.461 --> 02:50:13.882]  Good point.
[02:50:13.922 --> 02:50:14.322]  Anything else?
[02:50:15.768 --> 02:50:38.919]  Yeah, these are the type of people that justify the checkpoints, body scanners, vaccines, the drug war, international conflicts, tax money going to the military, industrial conflicts, who purposely make too many bullets, bombs, and armored vehicles, and then give it to local police to use, and then they get all riled up, and they get these people to be afraid of al-Qaeda to justify the police state.
[02:50:38.939 --> 02:50:43.882]  And I tell people, I tell these people that think they're anti-establishment, I'm like, look, this is what being a real libertarian is.
[02:50:44.944 --> 02:50:50.429]  Everything positive from both parties and throw out everything negative from both parties.
[02:50:50.449 --> 02:50:55.233]  I mean, it might be an overgeneralization, but... Well, I mean, here's what mainline conservatives think.
[02:50:55.273 --> 02:50:56.754]  They think they're part of the establishment.
[02:50:57.034 --> 02:50:58.976]  They think the armored vehicles are for black people.
[02:50:59.676 --> 02:51:07.122]  And that's why they first use it on black people as the rollout for America when it's really pointed at the Tea Party and old white guys.
[02:51:07.643 --> 02:51:08.804]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[02:51:09.833 --> 02:51:11.635]  The human body is extraordinary.
[02:51:11.975 --> 02:51:15.960]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:21.165]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon heart and body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:10.371]  Another major health threat.
[02:52:10.411 --> 02:52:15.313]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:52:15.373 --> 02:52:17.995]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:52:18.015 --> 02:52:24.838]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:52:25.098 --> 02:52:27.980]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.001]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:52:31.021 --> 02:52:33.042]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:52:33.062 --> 02:52:35.884]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:52:35.984 --> 02:52:41.486]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:52:41.706 --> 02:52:45.207]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:52:45.227 --> 02:52:48.248]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:53:07.835 --> 02:53:13.519]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:53:13.619 --> 02:53:18.363]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:53:18.483 --> 02:53:22.366]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[02:53:22.526 --> 02:53:25.949]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:53:26.169 --> 02:53:28.731]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:53:28.851 --> 02:53:33.213]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[02:53:33.313 --> 02:53:36.275]  I've suffered without constipation most of my life.
[02:53:36.495 --> 02:53:40.338]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:53:40.818 --> 02:53:44.540]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:53:44.741 --> 02:53:48.123]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:53:48.803 --> 02:53:52.245]  For the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[02:53:52.445 --> 02:53:56.647]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[02:53:56.788 --> 02:53:57.688]  I love your product.
[02:53:57.768 --> 02:53:58.188]  Thank you.
[02:53:58.208 --> 02:53:58.488]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:58.509 --> 02:53:58.829]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:58.849 --> 02:53:59.549]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:59.569 --> 02:54:00.229]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:15.475 --> 02:54:17.477]  All right, I'll have to do overdrive to get to all your calls.
[02:54:17.697 --> 02:54:18.658]  Next up is Habub.
[02:54:18.678 --> 02:54:21.140]  Then we're going to talk to Anthony.
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:24.382]  Then we're going to talk to Bruce and others.
[02:54:24.903 --> 02:54:26.824]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:27.285 --> 02:54:29.226]  Pray for peace with this Russia situation.
[02:54:29.686 --> 02:54:32.389]  Both our countries are run by pretty corrupt folks.
[02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:41.396]  But Russia is not starting this, and our media is trying to whip something up, and it's very dangerous, with Putin now threatening, you know, the, hey, we got nuclear weapons, knock it off.
[02:54:43.061 --> 02:54:47.744]  And we had former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush's favorite briefer.
[02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:49.745]  Favorite briefer.
[02:54:49.765 --> 02:54:51.046]  That's in mainstream news.
[02:54:51.727 --> 02:54:53.348]  Telling you exactly what I'm telling you.
[02:54:53.488 --> 02:54:55.509]  I mean, there's no other way to slice this.
[02:54:55.930 --> 02:54:56.890]  How dangerous it is.
[02:54:57.290 --> 02:54:58.431]  How out of control it is.
[02:54:59.272 --> 02:55:02.394]  I mean, and again, I don't like what happens to the Palestinians on many fronts.
[02:55:02.454 --> 02:55:03.695]  It's a very sad situation.
[02:55:04.648 --> 02:55:09.091]  I don't like what happens as well to innocent Israelis, because I don't hate them.
[02:55:09.171 --> 02:55:10.131]  I don't hate either side.
[02:55:11.532 --> 02:55:13.733]  I am concerned about nuclear war.
[02:55:14.594 --> 02:55:26.261]  I am concerned about the globalists funding radical Islam to demonize mainline Islam to then basically bully Muslims into either joining radical ranks or being killed.
[02:55:27.369 --> 02:55:30.650]  That's being done so the globalists can then wage war against all those countries.
[02:55:30.690 --> 02:55:31.810]  It's such an evil plan.
[02:55:32.250 --> 02:55:33.211]  Such an evil setup.
[02:55:33.671 --> 02:55:35.551]  Habu in Wisconsin, thanks for holding.
[02:55:35.571 --> 02:55:37.172]  Apologize for having you hold that long.
[02:55:37.212 --> 02:55:37.832]  What's on your mind?
[02:55:38.852 --> 02:55:42.693]  No apologies from you, but thank you all the same for the opportunity.
[02:55:45.094 --> 02:55:46.294]  Just three quick points.
[02:55:47.414 --> 02:55:49.255]  One about Ukraine.
[02:55:49.455 --> 02:55:54.576]  Your perception is correct that Russia is beginning to harden its stance.
[02:55:57.338 --> 02:56:07.623]  This statement, combined with the food convoys, they went into Ukraine, didn't wait for their permission after waiting for such a long time.
[02:56:08.283 --> 02:56:21.450]  And also, from news accounts from outside the mainstream media, media I'd heard recently, this week, that some of the separatists had routed
[02:56:22.788 --> 02:56:25.430]  Yeah, that's now admitted.
[02:56:25.470 --> 02:56:28.192]  That was coming out two weeks ago but wasn't confirmed.
[02:56:28.432 --> 02:56:29.113]  It's now admitted.
[02:56:30.553 --> 02:56:30.794]  Good.
[02:56:31.934 --> 02:56:35.437]  It's about time that Kiev gets a bloody nose.
[02:56:35.717 --> 02:56:45.983]  And, you know, the whole notion of what Putin said about, yes, we're nuclear armed, you know, Russia's been very measured in what it has said.
[02:56:47.464 --> 02:56:49.746]  Unlike Washington,
[02:56:50.188 --> 02:56:52.850]  Which has gone on, you know, blathering its rhetoric.
[02:56:53.910 --> 02:57:03.096]  But so often we've heard American presidents, and as I remember from Bush 41, you know, with that familiar refrain, all options are on the table, you know.
[02:57:03.397 --> 02:57:08.200]  It's the same thing, but Russia said it in a very diplomatic way.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:12.582]  The second thing is, you know, the ISIS thing.
[02:57:13.103 --> 02:57:19.627]  This is also part of the whole, you know, meant to create more confusion in the minds of people.
[02:57:20.363 --> 02:57:34.306]  And a suggestion to you, and you brought him on, I wish you'd bring General Hamid Gul of ISI because he would have very keen insights into, you know, the Pakistani... I agree.
[02:57:34.326 --> 02:57:38.667]  Let's try to ask General Gul to come on sometime next week.
[02:57:38.707 --> 02:57:40.547]  It's just the middle of the night over there and we're on.
[02:57:40.907 --> 02:57:45.608]  So offer the General for us to tape it later in the day so he can be in the morning.
[02:57:46.449 --> 02:57:48.409]  But yeah, we should get him on.
[02:57:49.318 --> 02:58:12.007]  Yeah, and the last part is that, you know, I think that there is a really concerted effort by the West, I believe in this case, to gin up the rhetoric, whether it's in Ukraine or ISIS, and now with Britain going on this terror alert, it's just to, you know, really put people into a frenzy of fear, and I haven't seen
[02:58:16.729 --> 02:58:28.232]  An occasion like this where so many even educated people are so confused about the goings on in Ukraine, who's on the right side, but especially in Iraq, Syria.
[02:58:28.252 --> 02:58:33.974]  This is what a disinformation campaign looks like, where everything's just so confused, fog of war.
[02:58:33.994 --> 02:58:36.415]  The globalists are planning something big.
[02:58:36.455 --> 02:58:38.055]  You can see them moving on all fronts.
[02:58:38.515 --> 02:58:40.116]  It's like they don't care what we know.
[02:58:41.556 --> 02:58:42.697]  I got a bad feeling, folks.
[02:58:43.057 --> 02:58:43.817]  I hear you, Habu.
[02:58:43.897 --> 02:58:44.757]  It's serious.
[02:58:45.157 --> 02:58:46.498]  We'll be back with a few more calls.
[02:58:46.538 --> 02:58:46.998]  Stay with us.
[02:58:47.078 --> 02:58:50.739]  mfolewars.com this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:50.799 --> 02:58:52.359]  I want to thank all our affiliates.
[02:58:52.459 --> 02:58:53.300]  God bless you all.
[02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:54.580]  Thank you for your prayers.
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:56.521]  This ends the official transmission.
[02:58:56.541 --> 02:58:57.641]  We'll do some overdrive here in a moment.
[02:59:00.623 --> 02:59:01.684]  In the near future.
[02:59:01.964 --> 02:59:06.107]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:59:06.467 --> 02:59:07.468]  Security alert.
[02:59:07.688 --> 02:59:09.430]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:59:09.690 --> 02:59:10.330]  Analysis.
[02:59:10.570 --> 02:59:11.231]  InfoWars.
[02:59:11.311 --> 02:59:13.252]  Building independent media operations.
[02:59:13.272 --> 02:59:18.256]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:59:18.296 --> 02:59:19.237]  Crime directive.
[02:59:19.317 --> 02:59:20.758]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:20.878 --> 02:59:23.640]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:26.783]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:26.963 --> 02:59:29.184]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:29.264 --> 02:59:29.985]  These people are a
[02:59:30.465 --> 02:59:33.086]  They're never going to stop.
[02:59:33.606 --> 02:59:40.329]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:53.975]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:59:54.255 --> 02:59:56.376]  Intellectually it's begun, you can feel it.
[03:00:00.345 --> 03:00:03.191]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.933 --> 03:00:07.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:19.981 --> 03:00:20.923]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:21.503 --> 03:00:23.426]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:23.907 --> 03:00:28.533]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:29.094 --> 03:00:32.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:34.293 --> 03:00:35.874]  I did part two with Paul Watson.
[03:00:35.894 --> 03:00:37.255]  Appreciate him working so hard on it.
[03:00:37.275 --> 03:00:47.561]  I just gave him some of the ideas and you came up with some of them, but ten more conspiracy theories that came true from a fascist coup d'etat of the FBI poisoning alcohol.
[03:00:47.901 --> 03:00:51.923]  I'm gonna cover all 20 conspiracies that came true this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:00:51.963 --> 03:00:55.525]  on the Sunday Transmission, unless all Hades is broke loose in Russia.
[03:00:55.806 --> 03:00:56.226]  We'll see.
[03:00:56.246 --> 03:00:58.107]  We got some special guests coming up Sunday as well.
[03:00:58.427 --> 03:00:59.768]  Right now, let's jam in some more calls.
[03:00:59.788 --> 03:01:02.449]  Thanks for holding, Anthony, in Florida.
[03:01:02.489 --> 03:01:03.070]  You're on the air.
[03:01:04.824 --> 03:01:05.165]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:06.327 --> 03:01:07.490]  Oh, hey, yeah.
[03:01:07.550 --> 03:01:15.807]  Yeah, I'd just like to say that I completely agree with you that I think that Vladimir Putin is not dumb and that he knows exactly what's going on.
[03:01:16.750 --> 03:01:24.036]  And these people want to financially plunder the Ukraine like they did Greece, and he's not going to let that happen.
[03:01:24.636 --> 03:01:34.103]  And essentially these people are so misguided that they're more than willing to pull the temple down on our heads, you know, when it comes to nuclear war.
[03:01:34.123 --> 03:01:37.966]  Yeah, and they're trying to steal Russia's pipelines that sell cheap gas to Europe.
[03:01:38.006 --> 03:01:40.348]  I mean, it's literal piracy.
[03:01:41.449 --> 03:01:44.952]  There's a pitch battle going on for oil fields and equipment right now.
[03:01:45.925 --> 03:01:48.646]  And it's just amazing to watch this happening.
[03:01:48.666 --> 03:01:53.767]  And the elite we have are looting our bank accounts with Obamacare and open borders.
[03:01:53.967 --> 03:01:55.047]  We're all being looted.
[03:01:55.488 --> 03:01:56.188]  It's bankers.
[03:01:56.248 --> 03:01:57.108]  It's not even the U.S.
[03:01:57.148 --> 03:01:57.508]  government.
[03:01:57.528 --> 03:01:58.788]  It's a bunch of crazy people.
[03:01:59.989 --> 03:02:05.550]  Earlier before, I think we have literally splintered into real America and then D.C.
[03:02:05.610 --> 03:02:06.070]  America.
[03:02:07.671 --> 03:02:08.051]  That's right.
[03:02:09.315 --> 03:02:09.375]  Yes.
[03:02:09.835 --> 03:02:11.396]  I agree with you.
[03:02:12.716 --> 03:02:16.138]  And these globalists don't get in any trouble, because they all have plausible deniability.
[03:02:16.178 --> 03:02:17.178]  It's a big bureaucracy.
[03:02:17.618 --> 03:02:20.439]  So there's not even anything driving the ship is what's scary.
[03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:23.801]  It's like a big blob that just eats everything in its path.
[03:02:24.421 --> 03:02:30.944]  And now it's so used to eating everything, it's running to Russia with nukes, and it's just going, bleh, give me all of mine.
[03:02:31.724 --> 03:02:33.925]  And it's not that Russia's perfect either, it's just that
[03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:43.673]  This giant blob has now run up against a Byzantine caveman empire that isn't going to back down, and it's just like crazy.
[03:02:44.234 --> 03:02:46.514]  But that's where these blobs go to die.
[03:02:46.854 --> 03:02:51.136]  Hitler, Napoleon, they just always want to go destroy Russia.
[03:02:52.717 --> 03:02:54.897]  And I guess, you know, you've got to be for Hitler.
[03:02:54.998 --> 03:02:56.498]  You're not patriotic.
[03:02:56.558 --> 03:02:57.939]  I mean, you've got to be against Russia.
[03:02:57.979 --> 03:02:58.799]  That's what's patriotic.
[03:02:59.628 --> 03:03:00.489]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:01.109 --> 03:03:04.052]  Being sarcastic, folks, when I say you need to support Hitler, you're not patriotic.
[03:03:04.072 --> 03:03:10.977]  The point is, is that... The globalists are acting real sneaky right now, folks.
[03:03:11.037 --> 03:03:12.118]  They're gonna pull something big.
[03:03:12.378 --> 03:03:14.920]  Notice all these shoes have been dropping, all this crazy stuff's been happening?
[03:03:15.781 --> 03:03:18.323]  When I get up here hysterical now, it's because I'm hysterical.
[03:03:19.524 --> 03:03:22.947]  I mean, I'm genuinely got spidey sense just pegging.
[03:03:23.267 --> 03:03:24.428]  I told you that about a year ago.
[03:03:24.448 --> 03:03:25.429]  It gets worse every day.
[03:03:26.266 --> 03:03:28.807]  Everybody I know that's on the know is freaked out.
[03:03:29.367 --> 03:03:31.908]  If you don't know, all hell's already breaking loose, there's something wrong with you.
[03:03:32.549 --> 03:03:34.669]  I'm sorry to all these other callers, Wayne, Andrew, and Jackson.
[03:03:34.689 --> 03:03:36.210]  I don't think I'll have time to call for Bruce.
[03:03:36.750 --> 03:03:38.451]  Bruce, thanks for calling from Michigan.
[03:03:38.471 --> 03:03:39.111]  You're on the air.
[03:03:40.352 --> 03:03:42.793]  Yeah, you're right to be worried.
[03:03:44.253 --> 03:03:48.355]  I'm surprised that Russia's been so patient compared to Ossetia.
[03:03:48.855 --> 03:03:52.397]  That war in 08 only lasted, you know, it was less than a month.
[03:03:53.137 --> 03:03:55.878]  They've stretched this out to six months now in eastern Ukraine.
[03:03:56.303 --> 03:04:00.066]  I wanted to recommend an article to you on LewRockwell.com.
[03:04:01.007 --> 03:04:09.573]  I was looking for another Paul Craig Roberts, and they didn't have him last night, but they had a guy I'd never read before named Clive Mondes.
[03:04:09.593 --> 03:04:10.674]  M-A-U-N-D-E-S.
[03:04:10.774 --> 03:04:11.755]  Sure, what's the name of the article?
[03:04:11.775 --> 03:04:12.555]  That's the best way to find it.
[03:04:13.256 --> 03:04:17.479]  I think it's like, Can Russia Survive the Empire's Onslaught?
[03:04:18.419 --> 03:04:24.824]  And he gives very good reasons why they will survive both economic sanctions and a cultural destabilization.
[03:04:26.661 --> 03:04:29.824]  He has maps and charts that are very interesting.
[03:04:29.864 --> 03:04:42.957]  He says the great fear in the West is that the dollar will lose its reserve currency status, and they're going to do anything to keep it, and that means war with Russia.
[03:04:43.297 --> 03:04:47.041]  But if you really look at it, messing with Russia is driving everybody out of the dollar.
[03:04:48.144 --> 03:04:51.585]  Our future will be a Great Depression again, or World War III.
[03:04:51.645 --> 03:04:52.946]  It's a very good article.
[03:04:53.046 --> 03:04:56.888]  Wow, okay, I'm gonna read it, because that sounds accurate to me, but I want to see the perspective in the charts.
[03:04:57.408 --> 03:05:01.169]  I don't just look at media that reaffirms what I'm thinking, but that... The sky is blue!
[03:05:02.210 --> 03:05:02.790]  And yeah, that's it.
[03:05:02.850 --> 03:05:04.350]  It's Great Depression or World War III.
[03:05:04.731 --> 03:05:05.651]  I choose Great Depression.
[03:05:05.671 --> 03:05:07.892]  All right, see you this Sunday.
[03:05:07.932 --> 03:05:08.652]  Great job to the crew.
[03:05:08.692 --> 03:05:09.272]  Sorry to the callers.
[03:05:10.353 --> 03:05:14.194]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters.
