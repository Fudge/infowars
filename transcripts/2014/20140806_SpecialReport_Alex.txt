[00:00:06.343 --> 00:00:08.365]  We're here at the Carnes County Detention Facility.
[00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:10.207]  This is a DHS facility.
[00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:15.432]  Now moments ago, we just saw a bus drive by delivering illegal immigrants to this facility.
[00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:20.897]  And we did have a chance to speak to the local sheriff who took it upon himself to be here to witness this personally.
[00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:23.039]  We're just trying to see what's going on here.
[00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:26.582]  We've seen that other media outlets have had a chance to tour the facilities.
[00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.604]  We're wondering if we'll have the same opportunity.
[00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:29.285]  They had ice.
[00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:35.710]  Yes, I put out an email a couple of days ago to the different stations.
[00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.713]  This is a look into the rooms that the feds are describing as suites.
[00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:42.576]  We're told one to two families can fit in here.
[00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:44.397]  It's bunk bed style.
[00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:50.542]  There's space available for the babies, game tables, the feds purchased flat screen TVs.
[00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:54.566]  There's also a landline telephone in each of these rooms.
[00:00:55.046 --> 00:01:02.152]  We trekked across an AstroTurf soccer field, spotted basketball courts, and a mock-up for a playground now in the works.
[00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:07.757]  And I asked him, Sheriff, I said, are the people here in this facility going to be housed here until their court date?
[00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:09.158]  It's going to be happening every day.
[00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:12.140]  So they bring them in, process them, and put them out on the same day?
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.441]  Yeah, they're going to be all staying here.
[00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:16.304]  So no one will be staying over an extended period of time?
[00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:21.630]  So what I'm saying is, if someone comes in, they come in and... Today, they're going to be here.
[00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.332]  They go in rotations, like every 72 hours, they stay here for a 72 hour period.
[00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:25.033]  Yeah, wherever it is.
[00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:25.994]  Ship them out somewhere else.
[00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:27.075]  Yeah, most likely.
[00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:27.995]  Yeah, that's how they do it.
[00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:29.517]  But they're going to have 532 here.
[00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:31.738]  They're going to bring 532 individuals.
[00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.642]  Well sir, do you know as far as the immigration hearings, are they going to be held here pending a trial?
[00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:38.184]  Are they going to be here until a trial date?
[00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:42.805]  It's a voting facility, so that's how it's going to work.
[00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:49.752]  But I know yesterday they were saying from days, and then they went from... It's usually like 30 to 90 days.
[00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:52.675]  That's how they do it through our courts, but they work a little different.
[00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.871]  So yes, confirmation, the illegal immigrant families are being housed here.
[00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:03.753]  And I also asked the sheriff, I said, sheriff, do you have any concerns about protesters coming out here like we've seen in California and other sites around the country?
[00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:05.194]  He says, we are prepared for that.
[00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:07.354]  And I asked the sheriff, I said, do you have riot gear?
[00:02:07.374 --> 00:02:08.135]  Do you have pepper spray?
[00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:08.975]  Do you have all that stuff?
[00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.156]  He just said, my main concern is public safety and protesters.
[00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:13.196]  And that's what we're here for.
[00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:18.498]  So we've got manpower available on standby if it happens, but so far it's been a smooth transition.
[00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:23.062]  So you said about the protesters, do you anticipate anything like we've seen in California, like the people blocking the bus?
[00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.543]  Yeah, you see, that's what we were, but we're good.
[00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:28.786]  It hasn't, and I'm sure if they would have been there, it would have been there already, like, from this morning.
[00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:32.229]  So, but no, they might show up Monday, you know what I mean?
[00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:32.669]  We just don't know.
[00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.871]  But what type of forces do you have to combat that?
[00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:37.172]  The Sheriff's Office, the PDs, and DPS.
[00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:44.058]  We all met with GEO and got with them, and we have a plan in place, and if we have to deal with it, we're gonna deal with it.
[00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:44.691]  Right.
[00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.573]  Do you have, you know, riot gear or any type of riot concerns?
[00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:49.313]  We're prepared.
[00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:49.733]  Prepared?
[00:02:49.993 --> 00:02:50.814]  We are prepared.
[00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:51.254]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:51.974]  Okay.
[00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:52.354]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:52.374 --> 00:02:52.875]  We're prepared.
[00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:57.377]  He says as of right now, he expected if people were going to protest, they'd already be here.
[00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:58.337]  But, you know, who knows?
[00:02:58.397 --> 00:02:59.277]  People could show up Monday.
[00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.059]  So, this is Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.320]  Keep watching InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:33.682]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.024]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:38.847]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:42.990]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.473]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:53.739]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:53.899 --> 00:04:04.981]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:06.561]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.181]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:10.102]  You are the info war.
[00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:14.423]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:16.243]  We are the true media.
[00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.983]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:22.664]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
