[00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.512]  Hacking is bad.
[00:00:03.132 --> 00:00:05.235]  Unless, of course, you're doing it for the U.S.
[00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:05.695]  government.
[00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:11.602]  When you go to the airport, reports show that the NSA gets info from your online searches during your flight.
[00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:15.786]  It's been reported that GoGo, one of the main Wi-Fi suppliers to U.S.
[00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.989]  airplanes, supplies data to U.S.
[00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.529]  authorities.
[00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.135]  Outside of airlines, we've seen companies such as Microsoft, which makes the Xbox, implicated in the PRISM scandal.
[00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:30.039]  But if you hack a company that makes video games, get ready for a visit from the FBI.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.464]  And if you expose the PRISM system in general, get ready to seek asylum and be labeled an enemy of the state.
[00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:43.967]  And if the Feds just so happen to find another way into your device, such as the Heartbleed bug, they say that it's no big deal.
[00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:50.930]  70% of all computers use a program that has had a major flaw for over two years.
[00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:00.913]  And this flaw allows hackers to get in and read encrypted mail, encrypted communications of all kinds, without our knowledge.
[00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:05.035]  Now, keep in mind, this has been going on for two years and we just now discovered it.
[00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:07.896]  I think it's one of the problems with American corporations.
[00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:09.137]  They've become lazy.
[00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:16.280]  Rather than building things in the proper way, they rely on open source, which is free, and everybody goes, oh, this is great.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.161]  This is good stuff.
[00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.501]  But this is what happens.
[00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:26.605]  So 70% of all computers in the world have been compromised by this bug, which is two years old.
[00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.446]  But back to video games.
[00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:36.793]  It's been reported that an Iranian Marine was recruited by the CIA to make video games that make players sympathetic to US foreign policy.
[00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:43.379]  Finally, it has also come out that the Feds are posing as online gamers in order to track the habits of players.
[00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:52.307]  They say it's so terrorists can't exchange information in online games, but I think it's the FBI wanting to know just as much about your fantasy life as they do about your real life.
[00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.029]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:00.195]  I'm good.
[00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:04.576]  The facts are in.
[00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:05.896]  The studies are legion.
[00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:13.521]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:19.064]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
