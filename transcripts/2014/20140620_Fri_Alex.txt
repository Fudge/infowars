[00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:10.377]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.959]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.501]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.706]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:21.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:40.799]  Well, President Obama has come out and said that you can come here illegally, but he's going to deport you.
[00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:45.121]  Of course, you can pull up different numbers in the last six years.
[00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.863]  Deportations were first cut by half, then 60%.
[00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:53.946]  I've seen numbers as high as 80%, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:58.629]  80% plus of the people being held are not being deported.
[00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:09.502]  Including tens of thousands of felons and aggravated felons just in the last month.
[00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.924]  And that's all on record.
[00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:17.649]  So, Drudge Report earlier had the image of Obama winking.
[00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.812]  Winking when he said that.
[00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:22.593]  Here's the issue.
[00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:39.286]  This is to set the precedent to create a border crisis, to use that crisis as a pretext to say the answer is immigration reform, to give people a legal pathway into the country.
[00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:51.135]  Folks in the third world know that they can just walk across the border and be unmolested and go all the way up to the interior to join their illegal families.
[00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:54.197]  And now the Border Patrol, and we broke this story and it's now national news,
[00:01:56.847 --> 00:02:04.051]  Is taking them and giving them vouchers and tickets on Greyhound to go wherever they say they have family.
[00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:18.358]  That is so off the charts that last night I was just thinking about it laying in bed and I just thought to myself that is so unreal that it's a felony if you or I do that.
[00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:19.838]  It's human trafficking.
[00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:20.539]  It's coyote.
[00:02:22.093 --> 00:02:35.295]  But when the government does it, while acting like they're not, and listen, it was so easy to prove, we just sent three reporters and a cameraman down to the border for four or five days, I guess Sunday through Wednesday.
[00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:40.436]  Or no, they came back Wednesday night, so Sunday through Wednesday.
[00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:47.017]  And broke probably three national news stories.
[00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:49.978]  Last week, it was picked up by Fox and others.
[00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:56.125]  About the Air Force Base in San Antonio full of illegals.
[00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.186]  And we drew attention to that.
[00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:58.626]  And I'm not tooting our horn.
[00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:03.489]  Again, almost anybody can do this now.
[00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.452]  The mainstream media is losing their viewers and their market share because they won't do their job.
[00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:13.213]  And nature abhors a vacuum.
[00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:17.535]  It's going to go wherever people give a big, open, unfiltered view.
[00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:24.777]  Like PresidentPlanet.com, Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com, sites like that.
[00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:28.019]  It doesn't mean I have all the answers or one of my reporters has all the answers.
[00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.100]  We're people too.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.081]  We make mistakes, but we're trying to tell the truth.
[00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.763]  And we have an open bias towards liberty and telling the truth.
[00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:40.506]  I mean, I really more and more just want to be a good person.
[00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:42.387]  And I've always wanted to be a good person, but now
[00:03:47.856 --> 00:03:52.739]  I just absolutely more and more am committed to trying to be a good person.
[00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.641]  And that means not being a mean person.
[00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:56.622]  It means not being a super aggressive person.
[00:03:56.622 --> 00:04:01.065]  It means not being a person that gets angry all the time.
[00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:02.806]  And it doesn't mean I still won't get angry sometime.
[00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:05.868]  People tune in to see that, I'm told, or hear that.
[00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:10.392]  It's just that we all have to have a gut check right now and decide which side of history we're going to be on.
[00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:15.318]  And not just have some window dressing in our own minds that we're good men or women.
[00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:17.479]  We've got to really stand up now.
[00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.482]  And everybody knows what to do out there.
[00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:26.706]  Here's another cheesy line from Revenge of the Sith, because I watched that last weekend with my children.
[00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:30.208]  After not seeing it in years.
[00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.611]  And they've gone to the Jedi Temple where everybody's been killed by Darth Vader.
[00:04:35.137 --> 00:04:38.919]  And we go to tell us how we want Kenobi, go find Vader and kill him.
[00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.480]  He says, you know, I don't know where to start.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.563]  And he goes, you know, you'll figure out where to go and what to do.
[00:04:45.563 --> 00:04:47.885]  And it's the same thing for all of us.
[00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:50.826]  We all know ways to change things every day.
[00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:55.189]  And when you seem to do it and stop making excuses, I'll be right back.
[00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:05.662]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:05:05.662 --> 00:05:10.228]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:14.794]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:18.115]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:23.558]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:30.961]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:35.082]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:40.205]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:41.065]  This is innovating.
[00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:48.808]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:05:48.808 --> 00:05:53.089]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:58.291]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:02.089]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:09.533]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:20.361]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:29.607]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:34.390]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.153]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:06:38.153 --> 00:06:40.214]  Experience the new formula.
[00:06:40.214 --> 00:06:42.776]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:44.117]  Shield your family.
[00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:45.938]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:03.444]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:07:03.444 --> 00:07:06.785]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:08.886]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.046]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:07:11.046 --> 00:07:12.687]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:16.028]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:07:16.028 --> 00:07:17.609]  If so, consider this.
[00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:26.532]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:07:26.892 --> 00:07:33.276]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:35.337]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:35.337 --> 00:07:42.962]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:05.276]  Live life healthy.
[00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:11.500]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:57.260]  Bob Barr, the former congressman who looks like he's set to get back into Congress, kind of a proto or trailblazing pre-Tea Party individual who exposed a lot of tyranny, is going to be talking about the VA scandal we're supposed to forget about, the border scandal, the Iraq situation, and so much more.
[00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:01.309]  And again, thank you for joining us.
[00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:06.693]  I will be live this Sunday as well, and that is 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:28.388]  Central Standard Time from this studio, and I intend to send reporters back down, finding out who wants to go right now, back down to the border this Sunday to be live on the air with us from the border, where the head of Homeland Security, Jay Johnson, or Jeh Johnson,
[00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:34.312]  Uh, has now basically, uh, visited and we're trying to find his itinerary.
[00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:37.813]  Looks like he's going to be down here engaged in photo ops for a couple days.
[00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:45.937]  We're going to try to go to these press conferences and ask him or any other so-called feds who aren't doing their job to control the border.
[00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:49.179]  That's in the Constitution or the three things the feds are supposed to do.
[00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.540]  We're going to go down there.
[00:09:51.596 --> 00:10:11.676]  And it basically asks the question, we have the emergency manager of McAllen, Texas, on record saying that 90 plus percent of the illegals that get off Border Patrol buses, that they've been picked up at the border, are given tickets to go into the interior of the United States.
[00:10:12.874 --> 00:10:14.795]  People who are illegal.
[00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:32.767]  And those articles have gone viral via InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrudgeReport.com, The Daily Mail's picked up on it, WorldNetDaily's picked up on it and shown photos and videos of trains coming up to the border with literally thousands of people sitting on top of them.
[00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:37.650]  We're talking 50 people per car or so sitting on top of the cars.
[00:10:40.197 --> 00:10:41.417]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:47.419]  And Obama, because he doesn't want to get the blame, because we're putting the blame on him.
[00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:50.180]  See, if we had just sat back and said, we wonder why there's a flood.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.101]  Well, he stopped most deportations, even of aggravated felons.
[00:10:54.101 --> 00:11:02.303]  That means a violent felon, a homicidal felon, an assaulting felon, a raping felon, an arsonist felon.
[00:11:02.303 --> 00:11:06.445]  Aggravated means it could kill somebody or they did kill somebody.
[00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:07.285]  Aggravated.
[00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:15.586]  You assault somebody with your fist, unless you're a known boxer that can kill people and has killed people before.
[00:11:15.586 --> 00:11:22.391]  In almost every court case, you're not going to get charged with an aggravated felony because you can say you didn't try to kill them premeditatedly.
[00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:30.778]  But you start trying to beat somebody over the head with a tire iron, with a crowbar, the jury's going to believe you reasonably knew that that could kill somebody.
[00:11:32.111 --> 00:11:41.180]  And these are aggravated felons, child molesters, whole nine yards, who are fleeing justice in collapsing Latin America.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:48.327]  And so, we pointed this out last week and this week, many times I said, it's a political process.
[00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:56.235]  And if we point out it's on purpose, and if we can prove that, which it obviously is, as Congress people and Senators are now saying,
[00:11:59.168 --> 00:12:06.717]  Joe Arpaio is saying in Arizona on the front line of this, we're stating the obvious, but the public doesn't know the obvious.
[00:12:06.717 --> 00:12:13.366]  And state-run media and people like Harry Reid and Obama, they don't want the public to know this.
[00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.388]  So we just keep stating the obvious here.
[00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:16.810]  You keep stating the obvious yourself.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:28.869]  And then, as this all unfolds, Obama's not going to be able to just get the first new waves in to encourage a mass wave that makes this huge wave look tame in comparison.
[00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:30.311]  We're saying 10, 20 times bigger.
[00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:32.252]  It could be 30 times bigger.
[00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:37.337]  Because there's a depression across the Caribbean and Latin America and many other parts of the world.
[00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:38.117]  You think it's bad here.
[00:12:38.117 --> 00:12:39.058]  It's nothing.
[00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:39.939]  Look up.
[00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:42.922]  Caribbean crime rates have more than doubled the last five years.
[00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:53.539]  I know because occasionally I go to the Caribbean with my family, and I look up crime rates, and I've gone to places that were nice ten years ago that are scary now.
[00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:54.840]  I love Mexico, folks.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.000]  I won't go there now.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.343]  Because the people have a bad attitude, they're angry, they blame America and El Norte and the gringo on average, and they've had their jobs taken.
[00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:11.179]  Whether they're fishermen or they're factory workers, and they're angry, and they're angry at everybody.
[00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:13.600]  They have riots every day in Mexico, folks.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.582]  With tanks and troops on a monthly basis shooting people.
[00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:19.843]  To the point it's not even in our news anymore.
[00:13:19.843 --> 00:13:22.525]  So I don't want to go to a collapsing war zone.
[00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:26.227]  Well that war zone is coming here.
[00:13:26.227 --> 00:13:28.908]  With the mass graves being dug up and all the rest of it.
[00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.569]  So Obama's coming out, wink wink,
[00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:38.015]  Now in saying he knows nothing about this and you can come here but you're going to be turned back and sent back.
[00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:39.775]  Well that's not true.
[00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:50.919]  The Border Patrol, who on average are one of the better federal agencies, because they're constitutional, and I've looked at them, they've got a lot of problems, but compared to the ATF they're literal angels.
[00:13:53.894 --> 00:13:57.695]  The Border Patrol has been calling for help.
[00:13:57.695 --> 00:13:58.575]  They're quitting.
[00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:00.476]  They've sent us letters and documented who they are.
[00:14:00.476 --> 00:14:01.956]  They've blown the whistle to us.
[00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:02.997]  ICE people have.
[00:14:02.997 --> 00:14:06.237]  They're the most freaked out because they're watching MS-13 bore across.
[00:14:06.237 --> 00:14:11.879]  They're watching police get shot, citizens get robbed, houses getting burned down.
[00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:15.200]  They are watching extremely arrogant garbage.
[00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:30.280]  As all of this unfolds, and a lot of the hard-working Latin American immigrants that have come here legally, or even came here illegally in the past, but didn't get free welfare, they're upset about what's going on as well.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.602]  Because they recognize the dregs.
[00:14:35.602 --> 00:14:36.643]  The dregs.
[00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:40.104]  Let me tell you what a dreg is.
[00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:42.205]  The dreg is a criminal.
[00:14:43.188 --> 00:14:47.329]  The dregs are people that don't have any skills and have diseases.
[00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:50.130]  Boy, do I feel sorry for them, but we're collapsing.
[00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.451]  You don't collapse this lifeboat and sink this lifeboat to try to jack up Mexico.
[00:14:55.451 --> 00:15:01.413]  See, that's why I was against the killing of Gaddafi and putting in Al-Qaeda to make it 10 times worse on record now.
[00:15:01.413 --> 00:15:02.913]  Admit it, it's a total hellhole.
[00:15:02.913 --> 00:15:08.275]  Because Gaddafi was probably a bad guy 35 years ago when he took power.
[00:15:09.912 --> 00:15:13.737]  But he did spend about 98% of the money that he controlled.
[00:15:13.737 --> 00:15:27.655]  Only time socialism works is if you do have a beneficent dictator in an already hellish anarchy area who builds public works and actually gives the general public jobs and builds colleges.
[00:15:29.378 --> 00:15:42.210]  And Qaddafi lived in a tent most of the time, and if you saw his so-called armored palace for his, quote, safety, it was a 15-foot wall and what looks like a swimming pool that wouldn't be that fancy in Westlake, Austin.
[00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.473]  And I'm not lionizing him or glorifying him.
[00:15:45.473 --> 00:15:50.758]  He got totally delusional, started meeting with Obama six years ago, meeting with Sarkozy,
[00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:53.829]  Well, I say six years before he was killed.
[00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:55.510]  It's about nine years ago now.
[00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:06.517]  And he started investing their money in Goldman Sachs and started going to meetings in Europe and actually believed, because he was able to meet with Davos people and Bilderberg people, that he was working with the West.
[00:16:06.517 --> 00:16:14.443]  He gave up all his weapons, his high-tech weapons, nerve gas, you name it, and you saw what happened to him.
[00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:20.847]  And Gaddafi was literally jacking up out of the mud 80% of Africa.
[00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:42.060]  He was building that continent up and literally, for whatever reason, was taking not just the money in Libya, but he was doing true development all over Africa, and he was trying to form an African Union, not run by the globalists.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.542]  They're trying to set that up too, to have one enslavement system.
[00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:51.406]  He was setting up a real African Union, where the countries really voted, they really elected people, and they really came together.
[00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:54.179]  And man, Africa's a beautiful country.
[00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:58.061]  I would love, I get chills when I talk about this, I believe in humanity.
[00:16:58.061 --> 00:17:00.203]  I want to empower humanity.
[00:17:00.203 --> 00:17:07.227]  I want to see Africa that's a jewel with the resources and the beauty and the people.
[00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:10.489]  But corruption has been in control of Africa forever.
[00:17:10.489 --> 00:17:12.450]  They never got out of it.
[00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:21.976]  Everywhere else was under corruption, the exact same executions, torture, slavery, barbarism, went on in Mesoamerica, went on in Europe, went on in Asia, went on everywhere.
[00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:50.275]  Until the Renaissance, ladies and gentlemen, and until the ideas of Christendom merge with the Renaissance, because Christendom had its own dark age and its own problems, and out of that came what we see as Western civilization that is in total retreat and decline right now, being replaced by the technocracy, eugenicist, scientific dictatorship system that I stand firmly against.
[00:17:51.223 --> 00:18:10.551]  But I also, at a fundamental gut organic level, you can call it a spiritual level, realize that if I have a greedy thought to suppress someone at my advancement, an evil thought, that it will only come back on society and on myself.
[00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:12.052]  I call that God-fearing.
[00:18:12.052 --> 00:18:15.033]  It's an instinct that you reap what you sow.
[00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:16.634]  It's a fact of the universe.
[00:18:16.634 --> 00:18:19.435]  It's a law, even if you don't believe in spiritual forces.
[00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:23.537]  It's real.
[00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:36.144]  And so, just because they've set up a system where the minority groups are hyped and ready for tribalism and racism doesn't mean that I have to buy into that and hate them.
[00:18:36.144 --> 00:18:42.647]  It doesn't mean, though, that I don't put up defenses and speak directly to people and say, look, here's how the game works.
[00:18:42.647 --> 00:18:49.211]  And it doesn't mean a group of Klansmen trying to kill some old black man walking down the road aren't a threat to him.
[00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:53.077]  But it isn't an expression of white people.
[00:18:53.077 --> 00:19:13.731]  Just like a group of blacks, which is much more common now, just like Klansmen of old attacking whites and killing them brutally because they're dehumanized animals in their eyes, tit for tat, just like I personally don't want to do it, but if a group of black young racists tries to beat me and my family to death, I'll just shoot them.
[00:19:14.755 --> 00:19:19.361]  Just like a black man should shoot a group of Klansmen trying to lynch him.
[00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:22.385]  But it doesn't mean I kill them with pleasure.
[00:19:22.385 --> 00:19:24.447]  It doesn't mean that it's something I enjoy.
[00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:26.190]  It's something I've got to do.
[00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:44.662]  And I'm gonna stop preaching and mention the headlines when we come back that are huge, but Obama is saying, wink wink, I'm gonna deport you, wink wink, don't come up here, as he gives awards to illegal alien children two days ago at the Dream Act ceremony, and as the word goes out, bring it on.
[00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:47.373]  We're going to collapse the U.S.
[00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:54.782]  into the North American Union, as General Petraeus said in the London Telegraph yesterday, and David Knight covered on the Nightly News last night.
[00:19:54.782 --> 00:19:58.787]  We'll get the number out when we come back, take a lot of your calls, and Bob Barr's coming up and more.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:16.490]  To have a fighting chance against cold and flu bugs, get the world's best garlic extract, Allicin Plus C. Fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi with Allicin Plus C. Scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:22.797]  Allison Plus C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[00:20:22.797 --> 00:20:28.284]  Studies show Allison Plus C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:32.068]  One tablet of Allison Plus C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[00:20:32.068 --> 00:20:35.512]  Allison Plus C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions.
[00:20:35.772 --> 00:20:36.032]  I think.
[00:20:59.438 --> 00:21:05.605]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:21:05.605 --> 00:21:10.170]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.715]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:18.037]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:21:18.037 --> 00:21:23.482]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:30.847]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:21:30.847 --> 00:21:34.990]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.774]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:40.074 --> 00:21:48.662]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:52.945]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.433]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:22:02.433 --> 00:22:06.256]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:22:06.256 --> 00:22:12.440]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:19.846]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system.
[00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:22.648]  Which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[00:22:22.648 --> 00:22:27.312]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terraganics.
[00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:37.479]  Pro-EM1 Probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[00:22:37.479 --> 00:22:41.923]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 is part of your daily routine.
[00:22:41.923 --> 00:22:49.208]  Put you back in control and prevent you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.
[00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:49.889]  Call Terraganics.
[00:22:58.313 --> 00:23:07.377]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:08.418]  This capitalism?
[00:23:08.418 --> 00:23:14.584]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:14.584 --> 00:23:18.288]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:18.288 --> 00:23:19.229]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:20.290]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:20.931]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:21.211]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:28.524 --> 00:23:31.225]  Listen up all you preppers and survival enthusiasts.
[00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:42.430]  Sigma 3 Survival School has a brand new survival instructor training program that will teach you everything you need to know about survival and then license you to teach our survival programs so you can make a substantial profit from it.

[00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:01.515]  We're good.
[00:24:26.124 --> 00:24:29.266]  PPK out of Russia bringing us in.
[00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:31.507]  Folks always ask what that is.
[00:24:31.507 --> 00:24:36.511]  Willie Nelson one time was on air and we went out to break with that and he went, what is that?
[00:24:36.511 --> 00:24:40.493]  An ice cream truck?
[00:24:40.493 --> 00:24:44.336]  That interview's out there.
[00:24:44.336 --> 00:24:50.099]  Willie Nelson said, I knew your show was big, but I had no idea it was so big.
[00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:52.421]  Yeah, I get a lot of death threats when I come on.
[00:24:54.918 --> 00:25:00.241]  My family tells me not to come on, but we need to talk about what's going on.
[00:25:00.241 --> 00:25:04.644]  That movie, Endgame, what a world, folks.
[00:25:04.644 --> 00:25:05.484]  All right, here's the deal.
[00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:08.146]  I want to open the phones up for first-time callers on this Friday.
[00:25:09.016 --> 00:25:11.618]  Specifically on any issue you wish to discuss.
[00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:18.944]  But I would like to hear your take, if you are predisposed, about Obama saying, you know what, don't send your kids up here.
[00:25:18.944 --> 00:25:21.666]  Because you can send them, but we're going to deport them.
[00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:26.390]  When it's on record, they've almost ended all the deportations, even of aggravated felons.
[00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.453]  And we've got video, we're going to play it in a moment again, of the Border Patrol
[00:25:31.425 --> 00:25:36.989]  With buses coming in, letting the kids get off, not even checking who they are, and letting them get in the vans and drive off.
[00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:50.179]  And then we have the emergency manager saying the feds, he's told, give them the greyhound tickets, or vouchers, and that most of them when they get off at his city already have them from the border patrol.
[00:25:50.179 --> 00:25:52.120]  We got the guy's name and everything.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:59.106]  And then we have the federal purchase order back from January saying prepare for kids in Texas to be shipped into the U.S.
[00:25:59.106 --> 00:26:00.707]  to their families who are illegals.
[00:26:02.381 --> 00:26:15.450]  And Senator Ted Cruz yesterday had a chance to ask a few questions of Jay Johnson, who we are sending reporters today to where he's having a press conference.
[00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.752]  But it's just classic create-a-crisis-offer-the-solution.
[00:26:18.752 --> 00:26:27.619]  And I've got in the stack all over the news, but in my stack I've got three mainstream articles going by Republicans going, isn't it time for amnesty?
[00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.451]  You don't like Obama having it by fiat, do you?
[00:26:31.451 --> 00:26:32.951]  Totally open borders.
[00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:34.532]  Better give them what they want.
[00:26:34.532 --> 00:26:36.292]  It's good for us.
[00:26:36.292 --> 00:26:40.573]  They've already legalized the illegals by fiat.
[00:26:40.573 --> 00:26:47.095]  And under this amnesty, it lets everybody here who is illegal stay and bring in their families, so it's just as bad as this.
[00:26:47.095 --> 00:26:50.356]  It's the same thing.
[00:26:50.356 --> 00:26:53.156]  But they're saying, we don't care if Congress won't pass what we want.
[00:26:53.156 --> 00:26:56.017]  We'll do it by fiat, which is called dictatorship.
[00:26:58.123 --> 00:27:01.224]  I mean, this is such a sensational time to be alive.
[00:27:01.224 --> 00:27:04.406]  I don't use the word sensational in a good way.
[00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:08.608]  I mean, I've seen a few fatal, sensational car wrecks.
[00:27:08.608 --> 00:27:21.574]  I told the story of people racing a Corvette and a Z28, I think it was, down the I-30 bridge from Rockwall to Rowlett.
[00:27:21.574 --> 00:27:24.255]  And I was in a truck, like 14, with my buddy driving.
[00:27:25.282 --> 00:27:32.807]  We were driving into Rowlett to pick up some girls on a Saturday afternoon and take them to a movie.
[00:27:32.807 --> 00:27:42.274]  And needless to say, we didn't make the movie and two guys we knew from high school shoot past us going about 130 in medium traffic.
[00:27:42.274 --> 00:27:49.819]  And that Corvette almost hits two cars, cuts in front, and has a blowout.
[00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:52.501]  And stands up on its nose, spinning,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.461]  But there was a railroad trestle on the side with some grass.
[00:27:57.461 --> 00:28:01.082]  Most of it was open to the water or everybody would have died.
[00:28:01.082 --> 00:28:09.323]  And I saw that Corvette go spinning and then just exploding with gasoline and people flying around.
[00:28:09.323 --> 00:28:10.824]  This is about 150 yards ahead of us.
[00:28:10.824 --> 00:28:13.104]  They shoot by us, turn, blow up.
[00:28:13.104 --> 00:28:15.344]  I see the car disintegrate.
[00:28:15.344 --> 00:28:19.145]  Get out, run over, blood spraying out of people's necks the whole nine yards.
[00:28:19.145 --> 00:28:21.626]  I don't tell that story to be macabre.
[00:28:21.626 --> 00:28:22.486]  I tell that story
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:34.870]  Because I run into people that get a cut on their finger and they almost pass out and they freak out and I wonder, my God, what are they going to do in life when they get cancer?
[00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.814]  Or when their kid runs through a plate glass window in front of them?
[00:28:38.814 --> 00:28:40.715]  Or when they get a compound fracture?
[00:28:45.046 --> 00:28:55.791]  That's why I found working with veterans and military people so good, the media says they're horrible and don't hire them and they're devils and they kill you any minute, is that they just don't think little stuff's a big deal.
[00:28:55.791 --> 00:29:00.193]  And they're usually can-do people because they've already seen so much real stuff.
[00:29:00.193 --> 00:29:10.118]  And then I saw another fatal accident one time with little kids, because it happened about 500 yards ahead of me, so I stopped and pulled over.
[00:29:12.278 --> 00:29:19.424]  I had to be there for a while and it was just little dead kids all over the place, minivans.
[00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:29.113]  And I just, so when I say sensational, when I say spectacular, ladies and gentlemen, but it's things like that that give us character.
[00:29:29.113 --> 00:29:32.416]  Not that it's a good thing, it just changes you.
[00:29:32.416 --> 00:29:36.500]  You know, like watching your grandfather die and take their last breath.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.180]  Things like that.
[00:29:38.308 --> 00:29:43.293]  Fundamental effects and so many people are living in the false reality of their iPhones.
[00:29:43.293 --> 00:29:46.215]  They have no idea the real world's going on all around them.
[00:29:46.215 --> 00:29:48.918]  Be right back.
[00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:50.319]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:51.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.508 --> 00:30:06.673]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:06.673 --> 00:30:09.015]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:14.299]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:14.299 --> 00:30:19.243]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:19.463 --> 00:30:22.784]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:22.784 --> 00:30:26.866]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:31.168]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:31.168 --> 00:30:41.412]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:41.412 --> 00:30:43.933]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:30:44.113 --> 00:30:52.336]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:30:52.336 --> 00:30:56.298]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:02.186]  In the near future.
[00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:05.828]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:31:05.828 --> 00:31:06.669]  Security alert.
[00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:07.889]  Security alert.
[00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:09.890]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:10.751]  Analysis.
[00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:11.491]  InfoWars.
[00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:13.593]  Building independent media operations.
[00:31:13.593 --> 00:31:18.476]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:19.516]  Crime Directive.
[00:31:19.516 --> 00:31:21.057]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:31:21.057 --> 00:31:23.919]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:27.161]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:29.322]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:31:29.462 --> 00:31:30.962]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:31:30.962 --> 00:31:33.803]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:31:33.803 --> 00:31:35.743]  They're never going to stop.
[00:31:35.743 --> 00:31:39.784]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:31:39.784 --> 00:31:43.385]  Block free iPhone apps at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:46.746]  Block free podcasts and video feeds.
[00:31:46.746 --> 00:31:47.726]  Imperative.
[00:31:47.726 --> 00:31:49.686]  Destroy President's TV.
[00:31:49.686 --> 00:31:54.247]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:31:54.247 --> 00:31:55.828]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:31:55.828 --> 00:31:56.588]  You can feel it.
[00:31:59.372 --> 00:32:01.595]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:32:01.595 --> 00:32:09.664]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:09.664 --> 00:32:16.773]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:32:17.193 --> 00:32:21.796]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:32:21.796 --> 00:32:32.424]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:32:32.424 --> 00:32:38.909]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:41.250]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:45.113]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:47.217]  It's not just the Super Mel Vitality.
[00:32:47.217 --> 00:32:51.404]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[00:32:51.404 --> 00:32:58.356]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:33:11.092 --> 00:33:15.437]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:15.437 --> 00:33:19.341]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:29.478 --> 00:33:38.924]  I've got all these amazing stories I want to get to and we'll try.
[00:33:38.924 --> 00:33:52.813]  One of them is a major Canadian news network has blamed themselves and the media for the string of mass shootings by admitting that it creates hype.
[00:33:52.813 --> 00:33:53.714]  It's basically promoted.
[00:33:53.714 --> 00:33:58.417]  I don't think you can blame the mainstream media because actually mass shootings are flat.
[00:33:59.858 --> 00:34:13.743]  But the weird events we see with the pill head, video game head, goth kids killing people, that is actually up.
[00:34:13.743 --> 00:34:20.986]  And that is a copycat type deal because the idea is being put out there of this is something you can do if you're depressed and upset.
[00:34:20.986 --> 00:34:28.809]  Just like death education, even ABC News has admitted in studies, caused suicide increase in public schools.
[00:34:30.213 --> 00:34:35.696]  Because you start teaching people how to commit suicide and never thought about it when they're 11 and 12 years old, some of them are going to go do it.
[00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:40.498]  It's real simple.
[00:34:40.498 --> 00:34:49.442]  I want to give the number out and take your phone calls on any issue you wish to discuss, from the situation in Iraq with the Al-Qaeda forces being turned loose by the globalists, to
[00:34:51.041 --> 00:34:57.945]  All the announcements that terrorists are going to hit us any minute, so we better give all our rights up, when the terrorists again have been empowered by our own government.
[00:34:57.945 --> 00:35:00.947]  I mean, just, it's so crazy.
[00:35:00.947 --> 00:35:11.733]  While they arrest people that are trying to go join ISIS in the U.S., saying they're trying to give material support to terrorists, they're arresting people in Austin.
[00:35:11.733 --> 00:35:12.853]  We reported that yesterday.
[00:35:12.853 --> 00:35:16.015]  They're trying to join ISIS.
[00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:19.177]  But then, the government's openly arming them.
[00:35:20.134 --> 00:35:28.537]  That's the type of weird, Neverland, oxymoron, down-the-rabbit-hole, Tea Party weirdness.
[00:35:28.537 --> 00:35:33.719]  And I don't mean the Liberty Base Tea Party, I mean the Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland.
[00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:49.105]  Speaking of mainstream media being in trouble because they won't report on the real news, there was a Gallup poll out yesterday that literally showed that Congress has a 7% approval rating that's less popular than dog manure.
[00:35:50.199 --> 00:35:51.700]  That's actually a statistic.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.324]  Steve Watson has it in his article at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:55.324 --> 00:36:03.651]  Gallup poll shows confidence in TV news at all-time low.
[00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:13.640]  The previous low was 2012, where a combined 21% said they had great deal or quite a lot of confidence in television news.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.581]  In 2013, it was 23%.
[00:36:18.764 --> 00:36:20.925]  Now it's dropped to 18%.
[00:36:20.925 --> 00:36:29.546]  And let me tell you, those are some really gullible people.
[00:36:29.546 --> 00:36:32.047]  And that's what they say, a lot of advertising.
[00:36:32.047 --> 00:36:34.908]  I don't do this, but I have people that do do it.
[00:36:34.908 --> 00:36:39.349]  They say there's about 20% that you can sell anything to.
[00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:44.350]  You can sell snow cones to Eskimos without any syrup on top.
[00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:45.590]  Any cherry syrup on top.
[00:36:46.997 --> 00:36:51.660]  Even though they have plenty of eyes, you could sell it to them, 20%.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.662]  And that's the people that the con artists feed on.
[00:36:54.662 --> 00:37:03.008]  I mean, a con artist can go in a room, just like a magician can go in a room, and pick the suggestible people.
[00:37:03.008 --> 00:37:04.849]  And then basically get them to do whatever they want.
[00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:09.412]  And we've all had people in our families preyed upon by that.
[00:37:09.412 --> 00:37:14.836]  And it's one of my biggest pet peeves, is watching really good people that I love
[00:37:15.956 --> 00:37:37.481]  in my family and extended family fed on by con artists and that's probably the group that I hate the most and I've been psychoanalyzing why I am so racked with guilt and I'm so privately neurotic and get so angry if people by mistake around here or myself do something that's unethical
[00:37:38.646 --> 00:37:39.926]  That's why I get so upset.
[00:37:39.926 --> 00:37:43.008]  I've never been an uptight, guilty person.
[00:37:43.008 --> 00:37:45.769]  I just try to be an upstanding person.
[00:37:45.769 --> 00:37:59.334]  Is that I so dislike con artists and scammers and frauds that I don't want to look at the mirror and ever see that.
[00:37:59.334 --> 00:38:05.356]  Because my identity is about being honorable and good.
[00:38:05.356 --> 00:38:07.677]  Doesn't mean that I'm a perfect person.
[00:38:08.892 --> 00:38:14.755]  And I know I keep going back to this, but the change in me to try to be even better is the change in you.
[00:38:14.755 --> 00:38:16.496]  It's all of us in a process.
[00:38:16.496 --> 00:38:29.943]  People are either getting better and waking up and becoming more connected, less separated from each other, more empathetic, or they're becoming less empathetic, less connected.
[00:38:29.943 --> 00:38:37.948]  I know I'm stating incredibly simple things here, but I was talking to a friend this morning about how
[00:38:40.325 --> 00:38:59.576]  His son and daughter-in-law come to see him, and just a few years ago, they'd come to town a few times a year, and they would, this guy's a lot older than me, they would talk to him at dinner, and his wife.
[00:38:59.576 --> 00:39:06.700]  They would talk to him, and they would have a discussion, and they would really connect,
[00:39:08.925 --> 00:39:22.671]  And now, he and his wife sit there on their phones and click and text, and that he doesn't have a relationship, basically, with his son anymore, and that we're losing our humanity to these smartphones and the computers and all the rest of it.
[00:39:22.671 --> 00:39:26.532]  And it's one thing if you use it as a tool to reach out and a tool to connect.
[00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:28.373]  That's what this show's all about.
[00:39:28.373 --> 00:39:30.694]  But still, the medium itself is dangerous.
[00:39:30.694 --> 00:39:37.237]  It's about being real, about being complex, about being three-, four-dimensional, five-dimensional, not one-dimensional.
[00:39:38.612 --> 00:39:43.574]  But people are so one-dimensional now where they're not even there.
[00:39:43.574 --> 00:39:48.697]  And they will only go find people that validate them in their delusion.
[00:39:48.697 --> 00:39:56.040]  And I don't want this radio show to be like a niche radio broadcast where I sit here and I validate the Liberty Movement.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.001]  We need to look at ourselves as well.
[00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:06.045]  But this is really how we're going to turn civilization around, is the police not just validating each other, but really looking in the mirror.
[00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:18.287]  And Sam, when you check out of here, as Gerald Salenta always says, what did you stand for?
[00:40:18.287 --> 00:40:21.989]  And don't you want to pay it forward for your children and their children and other children?
[00:40:22.807 --> 00:40:24.648]  I mean, isn't that really what matters?
[00:40:24.648 --> 00:40:33.155]  Isn't winning, being honorable, being good, loving beautiful things, helping beautiful people, helping innocent people, helping good people?
[00:40:33.155 --> 00:40:35.577]  When I say beautiful, I mean beautiful-hearted people.
[00:40:35.577 --> 00:40:42.722]  And being part of this great journey that's an unbroken chain to our species since its beginning.
[00:40:42.722 --> 00:40:44.524]  There's a great kinsmanship in a
[00:40:46.198 --> 00:40:50.323]  Spiritual connection to the ancestors that all primitive peoples have known.
[00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:56.351]  That is a great form of solace, even alone in a dungeon.
[00:40:56.351 --> 00:41:01.277]  When you're doing the right thing, you're there with all your kin.
[00:41:01.277 --> 00:41:03.059]  The old Norse saying, cattle die.
[00:41:04.585 --> 00:41:07.988]  Kinsmen die and cattle die, but I know there's one thing that never dies.
[00:41:07.988 --> 00:41:10.250]  It's the fame of a dead man's deed.
[00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:16.595]  But it's not the fame that you were great, or the fame that you could lift a big rock.
[00:41:16.595 --> 00:41:20.499]  The greater fame was that you were honorable.
[00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:22.661]  We have become a dishonored people.
[00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:24.022]  We've dishonored our young.
[00:41:24.022 --> 00:41:32.129]  Imagine if wasps started killing their pupa, killing their larva,
[00:41:33.942 --> 00:41:35.984]  And saying these aren't wasp.
[00:41:35.984 --> 00:41:38.187]  You would say that's a species destroying itself.
[00:41:41.747 --> 00:41:45.208]  So what is an elite that programs us to destroy ourselves?
[00:41:45.208 --> 00:42:03.972]  They've decided we're ugly and failed and bad, and by making that decision with them governing our civilization, that will then default, ensure that that happens, instead of struggling to be great and good, which in that struggle we reach for the stars, and we will not attain them, but our progeny will.
[00:42:06.397 --> 00:42:07.758]  Senate taker calls toll-free number 800-259-9231.
[00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:07.858]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:12.262]  There are agents of deception amongst us everywhere who seek to hurt the innocent.
[00:42:12.262 --> 00:42:15.325]  And the animating contest is now here.
[00:42:35.006 --> 00:42:36.968]  And don't miss the train.
[00:42:36.968 --> 00:42:38.850]  Don't be a spectator.
[00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.772]  Because being a spectator means you lose your soul.
[00:42:41.772 --> 00:42:45.496]  It means you lose choosing your destiny.
[00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.938]  Being the captain of your soul, as it's been said.
[00:42:47.938 --> 00:42:50.240]  Read a poem last week about that.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:59.529]  And the captain isn't in control of everything, but is making the decisions in their heart and in their mind, which is the only decision that ever matters.
[00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:04.893]  Because it is about your development on this planet.
[00:43:04.893 --> 00:43:08.316]  This is a test.
[00:43:08.316 --> 00:43:13.799]  And biologically we live forever as long as the planet and the species isn't destroyed.
[00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:23.685]  And it is like the allegory of something like the new film
[00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:43.394]  Edge of Tomorrow that we are our ancestors, not reincarnated, but our genetic ancestors and the race memories and all of it combined with other humans trying to get it right to go to the next level.
[00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:47.919]  And that's God's beautiful plan of nanotech, that we are universal
[00:43:49.136 --> 00:44:07.270]  Living conscious creatures, like a composite eye of God, giving God that created the universe and is the universe, a view from our perspective into the world.
[00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:12.414]  But independent from God at the same time.
[00:44:12.414 --> 00:44:17.238]  A shadow of the Creator, but still Creators in our own right.
[00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:24.243]  You have the evil ones that like ringwraiths serve the ring and the dark force at the core of it.
[00:44:24.243 --> 00:44:41.997]  Then you have those of us that attempt and some attain the capability by the grace of the Creator to then not become slaves but to become closer in the orbit to what it is to be good.
[00:44:41.997 --> 00:44:46.261]  So you will descend or you will ascend.
[00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:47.482]  There is no stagnant.
[00:44:48.476 --> 00:44:53.840]  There is no set point in life or business or relationships.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:02.287]  They either get better or they get worse.
[00:45:02.287 --> 00:45:09.292]  The lukewarm is what God spits out of his mouth because it doesn't exist.
[00:45:09.292 --> 00:45:11.034]  The lukewarm is not in the universe.
[00:45:13.353 --> 00:45:15.934]  There's not a knife edge of the lukewarm.
[00:45:15.934 --> 00:45:17.154]  It doesn't exist.
[00:45:17.154 --> 00:45:28.576]  You lie to yourself when you don't choose, because if you don't choose, you've still made a choice.
[00:45:28.576 --> 00:45:32.317]  And the fake liberal system is a counterfeit of a liberal system.
[00:45:32.317 --> 00:45:33.217]  It is the fraud.
[00:45:33.217 --> 00:45:35.358]  It is anathema.
[00:45:35.358 --> 00:45:36.378]  It is bondage.
[00:45:36.378 --> 00:45:37.678]  It is death.
[00:45:37.678 --> 00:45:39.639]  It is debilitating poverty.
[00:45:40.632 --> 00:45:53.822]  You look at people that live under welfare, and you look at their ancestors, just three, four generations back, I've seen the photographs, I've seen the case studies, and they're upright, smart people with their eyes on fire.
[00:45:53.822 --> 00:46:08.733]  Three, four generations ago, I don't care if they're poor whites in the Appalachias, or poor blacks in Dallas, Texas, they now look like someone has sucked their soul out, and they've got butts four feet wide, and they've got diabetes and die when they're 40 years old.
[00:46:11.294 --> 00:46:15.377]  They have literally been torn into pieces.
[00:46:15.377 --> 00:46:27.588]  They have had their souls sucked out of them from a very young age to feed a system that wants to destroy them in a desecration of the Creator's creation.
[00:46:27.588 --> 00:46:33.353]  A vandalization of beautiful creatures.
[00:46:33.353 --> 00:46:34.794]  Now, I'm not signing on to that.
[00:46:38.004 --> 00:46:43.066]  God fear isn't even so much, in my gut, fear of the Creator.
[00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:53.069]  It is fear of the free will to join the evil and that abyss.
[00:46:53.069 --> 00:47:03.373]  And then you recognize the evil in you and become fundamentally fearful that you are not shedding enough of it before you roll off this mortal coil.
[00:47:03.373 --> 00:47:07.274]  It's for that reason I repent.
[00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:24.430]  Of all my thoughts that have been bad, my greed, my selfishness, and my flesh, and compared to most people, people would consider, if you knew me, I'd be an extremely upright person, but the humbleness is because I know it is dirty rags.
[00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:35.096]  I can see reflected in the universe the face of the master builder, the grand architect,
[00:47:36.724 --> 00:47:41.089]  And I can see how great I am, but also how weak I am.
[00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:44.893]  And I'm going to get emails saying, the Grand Architect's a Masonic term.
[00:47:44.893 --> 00:47:46.515]  No, it says that in the Bible.
[00:47:46.515 --> 00:47:52.081]  Of course all the systems have taken those names and every symbol and appropriated under their own groups.
[00:47:52.081 --> 00:47:55.505]  I am not going to be judged anymore by other people taking symbols.
[00:47:55.965 --> 00:47:58.547]  The New World Order takes the American flag and uses it for evil.
[00:47:58.547 --> 00:48:00.188]  People say, I don't want to see that flag.
[00:48:00.188 --> 00:48:02.830]  How about we remember it for the good things it symbolized?
[00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:07.513]  We need to take back the culture, take back the symbols, and take back the truth.
[00:48:07.513 --> 00:48:11.196]  Because the enemy claims they have it and they don't.
[00:48:11.196 --> 00:48:13.317]  The truth was always with us from the beginning.
[00:48:13.317 --> 00:48:16.099]  The power was always with us from the beginning.
[00:48:16.099 --> 00:48:22.003]  And the solutions were always those of us that have a heart towards justice.
[00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:23.124]  And even though we do bad,
[00:48:24.807 --> 00:48:38.218]  And even though sometimes we stumble, we look back on it with a true heart and repent like David, who was a man who did terrible things in passion, but truly repented, and so was a man after God's own heart.
[00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:42.242]  That is the secret to turning this evil around, is getting our heart right.
[00:48:42.242 --> 00:48:45.945]  Let's talk to Brent in Texas, then Nelson, Bill, Frank, and Phil.
[00:48:45.945 --> 00:48:48.247]  Brent, thanks for calling in on this Friday edition.
[00:48:48.247 --> 00:48:49.208]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:52.834]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[00:48:52.834 --> 00:49:10.912]  The reason that I'm calling is because I stumbled across a video on YouTube and what it basically is is there's a guy named Sergeant Major Payne and this guy claims to be the first soldier in Afghanistan as well as the first soldier on the ground in Iraq.
[00:49:10.912 --> 00:49:11.273]  He's a
[00:49:11.993 --> 00:49:12.594]  I don't know.
[00:49:27.367 --> 00:49:27.787]  Well, he's
[00:49:53.815 --> 00:49:54.236]  Sure, sure.
[00:49:54.236 --> 00:49:56.338]  I'll have to look into it.
[00:49:56.338 --> 00:50:01.885]  And I don't want to sit here and make judges before I've seen it, but generally claiming I'm the first here, I'm the first there.
[00:50:01.885 --> 00:50:04.869]  Troops have never left Afghanistan or Iraq, ever.
[00:50:04.869 --> 00:50:06.251]  There's always troops there.
[00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:07.673]  There's always undercover people there.
[00:50:10.185 --> 00:50:18.028]  The foreign troops are openly in the NLE tabletop exercises that FEMA made public in 2009.
[00:50:18.028 --> 00:50:27.091]  So there's mainstream articles about how they plan to use North American Union Stabilization Forces, as RAND Corporation calls it, and we give folks documents.
[00:50:27.091 --> 00:50:31.673]  Or we tell people where the listed FEMA camps are.
[00:50:31.673 --> 00:50:33.134]  If the person's giving facts,
[00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:42.752]  If the person is breaking down the specifics, then great, we can go check them and verify them.
[00:50:42.752 --> 00:50:44.872]  I don't know specifically, but thank you for the call.
[00:50:44.872 --> 00:50:46.553]  We'll look into it.
[00:50:46.553 --> 00:50:51.334]  All right, Bill, James, Frank, Phil, others, I'm going to try to race to your calls on the other side.
[00:50:51.334 --> 00:50:56.775]  Don't forget, InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:51:47.885 --> 00:51:50.346]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:51:50.346 --> 00:51:51.506]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk.
[00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:07.093]  And his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:07.093 --> 00:52:15.218]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:19.741]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:52:19.741 --> 00:52:23.563]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:29.670]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:32.833]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:32.833 --> 00:52:38.199]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:45.227]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness
[00:52:45.247 --> 00:52:49.569]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:52:49.569 --> 00:52:50.969]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:52:50.969 --> 00:52:51.930]  Police call it robbery.
[00:53:12.296 --> 00:53:14.178]  We call it avoidable.
[00:53:14.178 --> 00:53:20.224]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:53:20.224 --> 00:53:25.629]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[00:53:25.629 --> 00:53:31.674]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[00:53:32.855 --> 00:53:39.902]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[00:53:39.902 --> 00:53:43.846]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:45.227]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[00:53:45.227 --> 00:53:47.289]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:02.975 --> 00:54:03.936]  Don't worry.
[00:54:03.936 --> 00:54:05.979]  This show is documented.
[00:54:05.979 --> 00:54:09.163]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:13.088]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:13.088 --> 00:54:17.734]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:17.734 --> 00:54:19.636]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:23.082]  The taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet.
[00:54:23.082 --> 00:54:32.227]  I now realize, and I'm just going to leave it at this, that the entire quest of life is to build societies of honorable, good, decent people
[00:54:48.905 --> 00:54:51.747]  And to have friends and family you can count on.
[00:54:51.747 --> 00:54:54.528]  That is true wealth.
[00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:58.410]  And every civilization that was great knew that.
[00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.452]  In fact, civilization was never built on anything but that.
[00:55:01.452 --> 00:55:04.153]  The Greeks, the Romans were very upright at first.
[00:55:04.153 --> 00:55:06.114]  They only became nightmare corrupt at the end.
[00:55:06.114 --> 00:55:16.660]  And I just think, God, your lucky stars, whatever you want to call it out there, that I've had such a great life and been around so many good people.
[00:55:18.627 --> 00:55:20.849]  I don't know why I'm talking about this so much today.
[00:55:20.849 --> 00:55:32.298]  It's just that I've been really upset this week about everything that's happening and I just have had a lot of peace this morning that everything will turn out okay in the end.
[00:55:32.298 --> 00:55:38.864]  My greatest frustration is the world is so complex and it's so hard to properly articulate
[00:55:40.253 --> 00:55:53.779]  What I'm trying to get across to people on the issue by issue basis, and I know how the enemy's already spun everything, so how do I decode that and try to reach through so people have that epiphany?
[00:55:53.779 --> 00:55:59.662]  I want freedom for humanity, because that is the oxygen of liberty.
[00:55:59.662 --> 00:56:06.965]  I want people, just like you want people to be free, so what do we have to do?
[00:56:06.965 --> 00:56:08.466]  We have to become aggressive,
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:16.062]  But also, in our aggression against evil, we don't want to cut corners and become evil.
[00:56:16.062 --> 00:56:21.225]  We don't want to use the ring of Mordor to defeat the evil.
[00:56:21.225 --> 00:56:27.067]  Because when you stare into the abyss, you become the abyss.
[00:56:27.067 --> 00:56:29.848]  So we have to have that debate.
[00:56:29.848 --> 00:56:32.649]  I'll tell you where we start.
[00:56:32.649 --> 00:56:34.430]  We stop the late-term abortions.
[00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:36.051]  We stop using abortion as birth control.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.521]  We start valuing human life again.
[00:56:40.521 --> 00:56:43.502]  We stop killing old people on death panels.
[00:56:43.502 --> 00:56:45.823]  We start demanding quality products again.
[00:56:45.823 --> 00:56:48.445]  See, we've just settled for crap.
[00:56:48.445 --> 00:56:49.585]  Myself included.
[00:56:49.585 --> 00:56:52.587]  Crap food, crap culture, crap everything.
[00:56:52.587 --> 00:56:54.708]  And we've turned into fat slobs.
[00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:56.889]  And I don't just mean physically fat slobs.
[00:56:56.889 --> 00:56:59.830]  Spiritually, I'm a fat slob.
[00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.991]  I know what quality is.
[00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:03.092]  I know what beauty is.
[00:57:04.022 --> 00:57:07.243]  But I am too lazy to even demand it.
[00:57:07.243 --> 00:57:09.084]  And so the world rots.
[00:57:09.084 --> 00:57:10.825]  And the same goes for you out there, folks.
[00:57:10.825 --> 00:57:12.285]  We know how to fix things.
[00:57:12.285 --> 00:57:13.386]  I need to shut up and go to calls.
[00:57:13.386 --> 00:57:14.346]  I apologize.
[00:57:14.346 --> 00:57:15.686]  Bill in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[00:57:15.686 --> 00:57:16.327]  I'll quit preaching.
[00:57:16.327 --> 00:57:18.007]  Go ahead.
[00:57:18.007 --> 00:57:19.448]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:19.448 --> 00:57:20.668]  First time caller.
[00:57:20.668 --> 00:57:21.529]  I'm a little nervous.
[00:57:21.529 --> 00:57:22.149]  Great to talk to you.
[00:57:23.303 --> 00:57:37.086]  Um, if I could, I'd like to give you a little, my little story quickly about, uh, police state and then talk about, um, my experience with people not wanting to open their eyes to what's going on.
[00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:40.907]  Um, my background here in Minnesota is, um, musician.
[00:57:40.907 --> 00:57:42.547]  I go by the name of Stick Up Kid.
[00:57:42.547 --> 00:57:50.329]  I've got some CDs out there and iTunes and all that, but I was a stay at home dad and my wife took over the family business.
[00:57:51.096 --> 00:57:52.356]  Uh, the land developer.
[00:57:52.356 --> 00:57:54.137]  So, we were doing pretty well.
[00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:56.037]  The business was doing well.
[00:57:56.037 --> 00:58:02.878]  Next thing I know, we're having troubles in our marriage, and the locks were changed on me.
[00:58:02.878 --> 00:58:05.319]  And, all of a sudden, I'm homeless.
[00:58:05.319 --> 00:58:10.800]  So, I'm trying to, you know, save the marriage, figure out what's going on, work it out.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:16.161]  And I show up, and she's having an affair with a cop.
[00:58:16.161 --> 00:58:16.941]  And from then on,
[00:58:17.722 --> 00:58:18.642]  I've lost everything.
[00:58:36.067 --> 00:58:36.888]  What they did to you.
[00:58:36.888 --> 00:58:40.210]  They tell women to change men like you change a wardrobe.
[00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.211]  Thank you for listening.
[00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:43.032]  And men are pretty bad too.
[00:58:43.032 --> 00:58:46.595]  Women are being told the thing to do is break up marriages.
[00:58:46.595 --> 00:58:47.356]  That's the thing to do.
[00:58:49.585 --> 00:58:53.668]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:58:53.668 --> 00:58:58.032]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:58:58.032 --> 00:59:01.695]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:59:01.695 --> 00:59:04.758]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:59:04.758 --> 00:59:12.284]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:59:12.284 --> 00:59:15.947]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:59:16.107 --> 00:59:20.630]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:26.593]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:59:26.593 --> 00:59:30.536]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:59:30.536 --> 00:59:33.278]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:59:33.278 --> 00:59:34.779]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:59:34.779 --> 00:59:36.159]  It's time to take action.
[00:59:36.159 --> 00:59:37.981]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:59:48.427 --> 00:59:55.030]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.030 --> 01:00:05.696]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.696 --> 01:00:07.017]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:08.798]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.798 --> 01:00:10.539]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:12.139]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.139 --> 01:00:12.900]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:17.851]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.851 --> 01:00:22.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.054 --> 01:00:39.088]  Yeah, I don't want to diagnose this, in your case, just from the school of the streets studying human behavior.
[01:00:40.942 --> 01:00:51.185]  But women on average are told, hey, get your dad to stay at home, make him Mr. Mom, you go out and make the money, or you run the career, that's a great thing to do.
[01:00:51.185 --> 01:00:58.668]  And most of the time, women end up not respecting that and getting rid of you and getting what they see as an alpha male.
[01:00:58.668 --> 01:01:03.009]  That's just the way the biology works here on this planet.
[01:01:03.009 --> 01:01:05.350]  And the system knows all that, so they try to change that.
[01:01:09.184 --> 01:01:13.231]  And then women are told to use the system, do whatever you want.
[01:01:13.231 --> 01:01:18.520]  I mean, I think something like almost 80% of divorces are filed by women.
[01:01:20.636 --> 01:01:22.978]  And men are slobs and men impress women.
[01:01:22.978 --> 01:01:24.480]  It's usually an abuser relationship.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.562]  You'll have a man abusing a woman or you'll have a woman abusing a man.
[01:01:27.562 --> 01:01:33.227]  And they're always entitled and have excuses for what they're doing.
[01:01:33.227 --> 01:01:43.695]  But I've heard about these cases where the cop gets your wife and it's like something out of a movie where the whole system's now against you and now the gang lines up against you and you're in deep crap.
[01:01:43.695 --> 01:01:46.838]  But that's bearing false witness.
[01:01:46.838 --> 01:01:49.160]  And generally when the system figures that out
[01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:54.644]  That person ends up getting in a lot of trouble.
[01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:59.407]  But I haven't even heard your story yet, I'm just guessing.
[01:01:59.407 --> 01:02:07.130]  Bill's calling from Minnesota, a musician, married to his wife, staying there, they have a development business, doing very well.
[01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:10.372]  Boom, suddenly he's kicked out of the house, a cop moves in.
[01:02:10.372 --> 01:02:13.654]  What happened from there on out?
[01:02:13.654 --> 01:02:18.756]  Okay, so I had to, you know, I was homeless, then I took a job as a janitor.
[01:02:20.747 --> 01:02:24.009]  And had to get an apartment for myself.
[01:02:24.009 --> 01:02:25.930]  Then, you know, right away...
[01:02:51.716 --> 01:02:58.998]  So when I caught her that night with the cop, I go in the house and turn on my... I called the police right away because I didn't even know he was a cop.
[01:02:58.998 --> 01:03:00.778]  I just knew there was a guy in the house.
[01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.299]  So I called the police.
[01:03:02.299 --> 01:03:04.479]  I start recording on my iPhone.
[01:03:04.479 --> 01:03:09.261]  And the first thing I asked, I went upstairs, went to the guy and I said, do you know my child?
[01:03:09.261 --> 01:03:11.141]  Have you been around my daughter?
[01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:12.302]  And I filmed the whole thing.
[01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:16.543]  And everybody that's seen it's like, wow, you know, you just got your wife with another man.
[01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:19.003]  I can't believe how calm you were and everything.
[01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:21.284]  Well, I, the police told me,
[01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:23.009]  That's right.
[01:03:38.992 --> 01:03:45.774]  I mean, I was like... And again, they were implying, we'll let her fraudulently say this if we don't leave our brother alone.
[01:03:45.774 --> 01:03:50.535]  And those cops are going to wonder why their kids are in car accidents, why they get cancer.
[01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.775]  I mean, I'm telling you, it's a law of the universe.
[01:03:52.775 --> 01:04:00.817]  You use power to oppress somebody, you can kiss your butt goodbye in the future, and God will serve it cold.
[01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:03.898]  And that's a terrible, terrible thing that happened to you.
[01:04:03.898 --> 01:04:05.098]  So, where did it go from there?
[01:04:06.662 --> 01:04:11.704]  Um, so I ended up leaving, um, she filed an order for protection on me.
[01:04:11.704 --> 01:04:19.167]  Yeah, they told her to do that, and then you didn't have the money probably to go get a lawyer to impeach that and prove it was a fraud.
[01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:24.289]  I did, because I had the video, and I had an attorney that... Hold on, here's the deal.
[01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:26.590]  I got Bob Barr coming up for 30 minutes.
[01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:31.072]  This is an important story, people are already into it, so we're going to recap it and cover it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:31.072 --> 01:04:31.472]  Can you hold?
[01:04:32.745 --> 01:04:33.325]  Yeah.
[01:04:33.325 --> 01:04:34.166]  People need to hear this.
[01:04:34.166 --> 01:04:37.848]  This is the way this works.
[01:04:37.848 --> 01:04:38.608]  And they've set it up.
[01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:45.732]  This is modern feminism, where the state's the man with the woman on her side, but only to break up your family.
[01:04:45.732 --> 01:04:47.733]  Because they want to get her in the end.
[01:04:47.733 --> 01:04:52.435]  But in this case, the state's also sleeping with her.
[01:04:52.435 --> 01:04:53.236]  Bill, stay there.
[01:04:53.236 --> 01:04:55.397]  Then we'll go to Frank, Phil, Steve, and others.
[01:04:55.397 --> 01:04:57.658]  James, after Bob Barr leaves us, stay with us.
[01:05:00.091 --> 01:05:06.254]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:05:06.254 --> 01:05:10.816]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:05:10.816 --> 01:05:15.378]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:05:15.798 --> 01:05:18.719]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:05:18.719 --> 01:05:24.161]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:31.543]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[01:05:31.543 --> 01:05:35.684]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:05:35.684 --> 01:05:40.466]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:40.786 --> 01:05:49.249]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:53.671]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:05:59.453 --> 01:06:06.456]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.937]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:06:08.937 --> 01:06:14.220]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:19.403]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:06:19.403 --> 01:06:22.425]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:06:22.725 --> 01:06:26.789]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:31.133]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:06:31.133 --> 01:06:41.363]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:06:41.363 --> 01:06:43.865]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:06:44.065 --> 01:06:52.278]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:06:52.278 --> 01:06:56.244]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.235 --> 01:07:01.477]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:09.546]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:09.546 --> 01:07:16.714]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:07:17.054 --> 01:07:21.678]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:07:21.678 --> 01:07:32.287]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:07:32.287 --> 01:07:38.792]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:07:38.792 --> 01:07:41.354]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:07:41.354 --> 01:07:44.997]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:07:45.157 --> 01:07:47.098]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:07:47.098 --> 01:07:51.282]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:04.871]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:07.633]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:45.870]  Bob Barr represented the 7th District of Georgia from 1995 to 2003, and I remember him really criticizing the NSA, the spying, the police state to a great extent, and being 100% pro-Second Amendment national sovereignty.
[01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.072]  I'd call him a paleo-conservative constitutionalist with a big libertarian streak.
[01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:51.868]  I don't
[01:09:09.844 --> 01:09:11.725]  The waterfront.
[01:09:11.725 --> 01:09:17.890]  His take on what's going on with Obama, giving awards to illegal alien kids to obviously encourage him to come up here.
[01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:22.994]  What the plan in that crisis he thinks is, or whether he thinks it's ineptitude.
[01:09:22.994 --> 01:09:33.002]  What's happening in Iraq with this ISIS group, and where he sees Hillary and Obama making all these cryptic anti-gun statements about executive orders.
[01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.384]  We need Australian style bans.
[01:09:35.384 --> 01:09:37.305]  Obama said that last week on CBS.
[01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:38.086]  I mean, this is getting
[01:09:38.866 --> 01:09:45.650]  Really scary because he's outdone Nixon times a thousand in my view, but he's just moving forward.
[01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:50.392]  And I, my gut, my spidey sense says danger Will Robinson.
[01:09:50.392 --> 01:09:55.875]  So running for Congress in the lead, doesn't mean he'll win, but we definitely need him in there, is Bob Barr.
[01:09:55.875 --> 01:10:01.778]  But before we get into all those subjects, I wanted to first ask the former Congressman, soon to be Congressman, knock on wood,
[01:10:03.044 --> 01:10:16.172]  What is your take on a lot of Tea Party, true conservative, libertarian candidates beating Blue Blood Republicans in Texas, in Virginia, with Bratt and others, and the media is spinning it.
[01:10:16.172 --> 01:10:19.254]  Oh, the Tea Party has been discredited while a lot of Blue Bloods won.
[01:10:19.254 --> 01:10:22.577]  That's not what I'm seeing in the numbers and the Republican attempts.
[01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:33.283]  With the Democrats trying to block to the Tea Party, I only see real reform of the Republicans towards more of what their platform is, towards their only hope.
[01:10:33.283 --> 01:10:37.545]  Compromising with the Democrats is what is extincting the Republican Party.
[01:10:37.545 --> 01:10:50.313]  Now, I'm not as politically savvy, obviously, as you, as senior in the CIA, a federal prosecutor before that, somebody who has done international negotiations, a congressman, but
[01:10:51.093 --> 01:10:55.178]  Is that approximation I made accurate or can you augment it or disagree with it?
[01:10:56.654 --> 01:11:01.638]  I certainly wouldn't disagree with that, not only because you're the host of this show, but because you're right.
[01:11:01.638 --> 01:11:14.347]  The fact of the matter is that Cantor's loss, and I know Eric Cantor, I like him, and he was doing an incredible job as Majority Leader, but he suffered from two things.
[01:11:14.347 --> 01:11:18.270]  One, what we call in the legal profession, robitis.
[01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:25.135]  Judges, once they get elected or appointed, they don the black robe and they kind of put themselves above the people and lose touch.
[01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:46.001]  The lesson number one for Eric is no matter how important your work in Washington is, even if the people in your district support you in being a leader in the Congress, because that brings prestige and so forth to your district, you cannot, except at your own peril, forget the people back home.
[01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:53.503]  You can't become so enamored of Washington power that you forget the people that sent you there and the people that you ultimately answer to.
[01:11:53.503 --> 01:11:54.183]  Secondly, though,
[01:11:55.094 --> 01:12:16.333]  I think those who try and downplay the importance of what congressman-elect, I guess he's not congressman-elect but for all intents and purposes, Brad, represents is he represents a deep-seated and continuing movement among conservatives in this country to get people into office and keep people in office
[01:12:16.873 --> 01:12:25.184]  Who will actually move our conservative agenda, not Washington's agenda, but our conservative agenda forward.
[01:12:25.184 --> 01:12:33.535]  And that's what I'm hearing here in the 11th District of Georgia, and I suspect that that's exactly what Mr. Bratt was hearing in the 7th District of Virginia.
[01:12:34.113 --> 01:12:35.835]  And again, the districts have been rewritten.
[01:12:35.835 --> 01:12:47.425]  You were in the 7th, now you're running in the 11th, which is much of Atlanta, one of the most important districts in the country, with all these new Tea Party people that are going to be getting into office for the first time.
[01:12:47.425 --> 01:12:54.091]  I think it's going to be great to have somebody like you, I would call Paleo Tea Party, or Proto Tea Party.
[01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:59.215]  You were one of the few voices that would say things like Ron Paul was saying when you were there.
[01:12:59.215 --> 01:13:00.476]  I mean, I think your leadership
[01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:01.457]  Yeah.
[01:13:31.718 --> 01:13:39.669]  I don't know what the Democrats think they're doing being so incredibly radical and so incredibly criminal with the actions they're doing.
[01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:47.019]  I mean, I've never seen and in history never seen an American presidency act like this.
[01:13:48.436 --> 01:13:51.639]  I don't think there's words to describe how bad it is.
[01:13:51.639 --> 01:13:56.604]  So A, what is your take on the seismic shift I see happening?
[01:13:56.604 --> 01:13:59.247]  How would you describe that shift or do you agree it's happening?
[01:13:59.247 --> 01:14:02.570]  And B, what are the Democratic leaders thinking?
[01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:06.574]  C, what will they pull to try to get themselves out of this?
[01:14:08.764 --> 01:14:15.669]  This president is so bad, he makes Jimmy Carter look like one of our best presidents ever.
[01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:19.292]  That's how bad this guy is.
[01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:26.417]  I know there's a lot of speculation, Alex, that it's not just sheer incompetence that we're witnessing.
[01:14:27.538 --> 01:14:30.540]  Deep-seated incompetence in this administration.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:43.966]  You just listen to Susan Rice, his UN Ambassador of Babylon about the Bergdahl case or something else, and you realize these are vacuums that we're listening to.
[01:14:43.966 --> 01:14:52.591]  Their knowledge of world affairs or Middle Eastern affairs or military affairs, it isn't that it's a mile wide and an inch deep.
[01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:53.851]  It just ain't there at all.
[01:14:53.851 --> 01:14:53.912]  Wow.
[01:14:55.718 --> 01:15:11.376]  Whether or not there is a concerted effort to dramatically change the lay of the land in the Middle East, for example, by arming terrorist groups in Syria that we apparently know nothing about,
[01:15:11.796 --> 01:15:12.137]  I think so.
[01:15:28.013 --> 01:15:43.691]  Whatever it is, this administration is causing deep and, if we're not careful, permanent damage to America's ability to influence events in the world because the image we are presenting, whether it's part of a concerted plan by Obama, the ideologue,
[01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:53.536]  Or part of an unfortunate administration that we have that just has no earthly idea what it's doing, that is an incompetent administration.
[01:15:53.536 --> 01:16:07.123]  The message being sent to our adversaries and our allies is we do not know what we're doing, we can't be trusted, and therefore people are going to throw in with other groups, other countries, other leaders, not the United States.
[01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:13.491]  I had heard this when he was first running, and I didn't really believe it from a lot of really smart people.
[01:16:13.491 --> 01:16:16.974]  But they said, no, Obama does really hate America.
[01:16:16.974 --> 01:16:21.657]  The people he represents hate America, kind of like Dinesh D'Souza's 2016.
[01:16:21.657 --> 01:16:23.998]  And they want a new New World Order.
[01:16:23.998 --> 01:16:28.762]  They want to realign the world with really anti-capitalist bent.
[01:16:29.822 --> 01:16:32.343]  And that they just can't help it.
[01:16:32.343 --> 01:16:33.543]  They want to wreck this country.
[01:16:33.543 --> 01:16:37.404]  It's a famous statement when Bill Clinton was being inaugurated that night.
[01:16:37.404 --> 01:16:47.827]  They had a bunch of F-16s fly over and Ron Silver, this was documented in the news at the time, I'm sure you remember it, said, how dare them fly jets over us and threaten us to show the weird disconnect.
[01:16:47.827 --> 01:16:50.288]  I mean, somebody who knew nothing about the military.
[01:16:50.288 --> 01:16:51.948]  And they said, no, no, Ron.
[01:16:51.948 --> 01:16:55.690]  Hillary bumped him and said, those are our jets now.
[01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:56.390]  And I just...
[01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:06.345]  It's one thing to be radicals in college and all this stuff, but they're in control of the country, and I just think they can't help wrecking it out of almost a subconscious hatred of it.
[01:17:06.345 --> 01:17:08.469]  I think that best describes it, Congressman.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:18.807]  Well, Obama is clearly an ideologue which makes him very different and much more dangerous than Bill Clinton was back then.
[01:17:18.807 --> 01:17:22.930]  And, of course, we impeached Bill Clinton, as you certainly recall.
[01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.452]  We were very active in that.
[01:17:25.452 --> 01:17:30.015]  And he became only the very first elected president ever impeached.
[01:17:30.015 --> 01:17:32.777]  Andrew Johnson was the first, but he wasn't elected president.
[01:17:33.618 --> 01:17:49.796]  And as you and I talked a few months ago, I guess the last time I had the honor of being on your show, we talked a little bit about impeachment and I indicated that I thought it was appropriate to begin an inquiry of impeachment, not articles of impeachment, but an inquiry.
[01:17:50.476 --> 01:17:58.763]  And since then, I've seen two very credible books come out on impeachment of Obama.
[01:17:58.763 --> 01:18:01.065]  Many, many articles.
[01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:11.253]  So, clearly, there is an awakening out there among a lot of Americans that these problems go beyond simple incompetence.
[01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:19.800]  When you have a president that deliberately, almost proudly, Alex, violates the law, thumbs his nose, figuratively speaking, at the Congress.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:49.005]  When he not only fails to protect our borders in Texas, for example, not only fails to follow the law with regard to apprehending those and deporting those who enter and remain in this country unlawfully, but encourages illegals to enter this country and uses our precious military resources, which are stretched so thin already,
[01:18:49.745 --> 01:18:57.888]  To simply, as Sheriff Joe Arpaio, my good friend out in Arizona, said, change diapers rather than protect our nation.
[01:18:57.888 --> 01:19:03.170]  We've gone beyond simply, well, you know, these problems will resolve themselves.
[01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:03.650]  They won't.
[01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:10.733]  The American people and our representatives in the Congress and the House have to begin the process of rectifying this.
[01:19:11.223 --> 01:19:16.066]  Well, I agree, and so a lot of bad things are happening, but I want people to know the positive news.
[01:19:16.066 --> 01:19:23.892]  I have never seen the emergency sirens going off like they are in the public's mind right now across the board.
[01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:36.661]  And the fact that you notice he's not doing this total open deal in California that destabilizes the state they control, they're doing it in Texas as part of this battleground Texas plan that Project Veritas and James O'Keefe got on video.
[01:19:37.421 --> 01:19:47.430]  Six months ago where they said, we're going to flood things with illegals, give them IDs, let them vote, and turn Texas blue, and you know, don't worry, we're going to get the guns.
[01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:51.594]  There really is a criminal energy now.
[01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:53.596]  To the Democrats.
[01:19:53.596 --> 01:20:01.541]  I mean, the Democrats of, say, the 70s would be like the Republicans, you know, of a decade ago.
[01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:06.024]  I mean, they're so radical now and so out of control.
[01:20:06.024 --> 01:20:07.765]  And we broke this three days ago.
[01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:11.207]  DrudgeReport.com put it out, and the media checked it and confirmed it.
[01:20:11.207 --> 01:20:12.968]  We talked to emergency managers.
[01:20:12.968 --> 01:20:14.189]  We got video.
[01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:15.670]  The Border Patrol's quitting en masse.
[01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:18.052]  They blew the whistle and told us where to come, and ICE agent did.
[01:20:19.213 --> 01:20:29.974]  In McAllen and Brownsville, the buses drive over, the Border Patrol is ordered to stand down, they load on white vans, and are taken to Catholic and Protestant and Evangelical churches.
[01:20:31.252 --> 01:20:40.201]  And the Border Patrol gives them vouchers for the Greyhound tickets, children and adults, to drive into their families that are illegals as well.
[01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:44.986]  So we have the video, and people for two days couldn't believe it, and now it's been confirmed.
[01:20:44.986 --> 01:20:49.330]  We have the video, sir, of the Border Patrol in Texas
[01:20:50.091 --> 01:20:56.073]  If this isn't impeachable, I know you filed the stuff first on Clinton, so you take action.
[01:20:56.073 --> 01:21:12.260]  I mean, this, as you said, makes Bill Clinton look like a choir boy, that it's going on, and then to honor the Dream Act kids that are illegal, while talking out of the other side of his mouth saying, oh no, if you come here we'll deport you, when they've suspended most deportations, including of aggravated felons.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.161]  You're a former federal prosecutor.
[01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.162]  I mean, what do you call this?
[01:21:16.162 --> 01:21:18.963]  I mean, this is, what do you think they're going to get out of this?
[01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:21.429]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:21:41.014 --> 01:22:01.142]  is clearly dereliction of duty, failure to honor his oath of office, and these all are those sorts of things that Alexander Hamilton, one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, described as high crimes and misdemeanors.
[01:22:01.142 --> 01:22:07.464]  Not only direct criminal actions such as obstruction of justice and perjury as committed by Bill Clinton,
[01:22:08.844 --> 01:22:30.454]  Not only are those sort of actions clearly impeachable and the sort of actions by a president that our founders envisioned as providing grounds for impeachment, but even if it is not a president deliberately and explicitly violating a law, but simply engaging in policies that subvert
[01:22:30.874 --> 01:22:31.235]  Sure.
[01:22:54.775 --> 01:23:00.758]  Wow, strong words, but we have strong actions from Obama and the Democrats, so that's what we have to respond with.
[01:23:00.758 --> 01:23:08.582]  How do you, with your inside knowledge of how these guys work, Congressman Bob Barr joining us, if you just tuned in.
[01:23:09.966 --> 01:23:12.328]  How do you think they think they're getting away with this?
[01:23:12.328 --> 01:23:17.632]  Because they seem to be just desperately trying to sink the ship as fast as they can.
[01:23:17.632 --> 01:23:19.373]  Is it Cloward and Piven?
[01:23:19.373 --> 01:23:24.797]  Just a plan to bring in so many people that are destitute that it overwhelms the system and we collapse into pure socialism?
[01:23:26.078 --> 01:23:38.269]  Well, it's an effort with regard to this specific crisis that they are creating and fostering and flaming with all of these children.
[01:23:38.269 --> 01:23:41.011]  And these aren't just toddlers in diapers.
[01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:52.993]  They are teenagers, sometimes pre-teens, who are very clearly part of violent gangs.
[01:23:52.993 --> 01:23:57.136]  In some instances, I wouldn't be surprised if they had actually engaged in murder.
[01:23:57.136 --> 01:24:09.307]  We have very clear evidence that these gangs do enlist children, sometimes under even pre-teens, to go out and commit murders because they are less suspect if you see them.
[01:24:10.388 --> 01:24:29.004]  So, what we're witnessing here is an effort to bring in a lot of these illegals, disperse them around the country, so that it then becomes much, much harder to find them, to identify them, to make them appear in court.
[01:24:29.004 --> 01:24:32.647]  None of these people virtually are going to appear in court once they've been released,
[01:24:33.599 --> 01:24:43.545]  They say on video, sir, they say on video that they just send them wherever they want to be sent to quote families and drop them off at bus stations paid for by taxpayers.
[01:24:44.956 --> 01:24:45.516]  Yeah.
[01:24:45.516 --> 01:24:56.420]  And in the meantime, we're using our military bases, which ought to be engaging in exercises to protect our nation and so forth.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:06.944]  They're having to babysit and use our taxpayer resources that should be going to military pay, maintaining military bases, buying equipment, and so forth.
[01:25:06.944 --> 01:25:09.504]  It's being used to babysit these people.
[01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:14.226]  Why don't we, for example, put them on planes or buses and send them back
[01:25:16.107 --> 01:25:22.829]  Yeah, even though these are not all Mexican nationals.
[01:25:22.829 --> 01:25:27.271]  Some of them, or many of them, apparently are coming in from other countries in Central America.
[01:25:27.271 --> 01:25:29.472]  They are coming from Mexico.
[01:25:29.472 --> 01:25:32.133]  Obviously, Mexico is a big part of the problem.
[01:25:32.133 --> 01:25:34.854]  They are doing nothing to stem this tide.
[01:25:34.854 --> 01:25:36.415]  They are encouraging it.
[01:25:36.955 --> 01:25:45.882]  We have, or should have, a great deal of influence that we can bring to bear with regard to Mexico because of the trade and other relations that we have with Mexico.
[01:25:45.882 --> 01:25:46.823]  What are we doing?
[01:25:46.823 --> 01:25:51.026]  Apparently nothing to force Mexico to address this problem.
[01:25:51.026 --> 01:25:58.933]  We ought to be sending them back across the border by the busload as soon as they cross over and we can apprehend them instead of taking care of them here.
[01:25:58.933 --> 01:26:00.514]  It's Mexico's problem.
[01:26:00.514 --> 01:26:01.635]  Let Mexico deal with it.
[01:26:02.614 --> 01:26:08.477]  BarCongress.com, BarCongress.com or BobBar.org redirects there.
[01:26:08.477 --> 01:26:10.438]  Only got about five minutes or four minutes left with you.
[01:26:10.438 --> 01:26:11.919]  I want to move quick now.
[01:26:11.919 --> 01:26:25.085]  Speaking of military pay, the death list, just like the death panels, every military person I've talked to, even Democrats, say in the last six years the VA's gone from bad to nightmarish hell.
[01:26:25.085 --> 01:26:28.487]  And so we're going to house illegal alien kids and they complain the food isn't good enough.
[01:26:29.127 --> 01:26:35.558]  It's a lot better than Michelle Obama public school food, and then literally the VA isn't taking care of the troops.
[01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:39.404]  Speak to the VA, a little more on Iraq, and any other points.
[01:26:39.404 --> 01:26:40.206]  Congressman Bob Barr.
[01:26:41.505 --> 01:26:48.987]  With regard to the VA, some people say, I don't have a heart, but if I did have a heart, this would bring it to tears.
[01:26:48.987 --> 01:27:02.371]  What our Veterans Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs is doing to our veterans, it is killing them through their inaction, their cowardice to own up to the sorry record that many of these hospitals have.
[01:27:03.091 --> 01:27:11.338]  And engaging in what, Alex, I have to tell you, appears to me to be a possible racketeering enterprise, a RICO.
[01:27:11.338 --> 01:27:24.549]  When you look at the fraud that has been going on and the very possible destruction of records, alteration of official documents in order to make themselves not look so bad as they really are at some of these hospitals.
[01:27:25.209 --> 01:27:40.640]  I think a good prosecutor at the national level should be looking at putting together a RICO case, a racketeering enterprise case, against these individuals and some of the VA institutions at which they've been doing this.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.983]  It has risen beyond simply a bureaucratic problem.
[01:27:43.983 --> 01:27:47.005]  I think we have a criminal problem with the veterans.
[01:27:47.425 --> 01:27:48.305]  Absolutely.
[01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:52.447]  Putting people on secret illegal death lists and basically let them die.
[01:27:52.447 --> 01:27:54.608]  That's aiding and abetting and murder.
[01:27:54.608 --> 01:28:01.010]  And then that dovetails with the missing emails from all these different officials with the IRS.
[01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.970]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:28:03.092 --> 01:28:04.593]  It is.
[01:28:04.593 --> 01:28:07.415]  We saw this to a smaller extent, Alex.
[01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:17.103]  You may remember with some of the White House travel documents and some of the Whitewater documents where they tried to claim that the emails were missing.
[01:28:17.103 --> 01:28:21.706]  Oh, gee, they had just dissipated into the ether.
[01:28:21.706 --> 01:28:22.647]  That doesn't happen.
[01:28:23.808 --> 01:28:45.823]  I think that given the lethargy at our Department of Justice, where we have an Attorney General who not only tries to force the administration to abide by the law, but enables it and encourages this administration to violate the law, giving them legal cover, we ought to demand that a special prosecutor be appointed.
[01:28:46.764 --> 01:29:08.746]  Unfortunately, we don't have any longer the independent counsel statute, but in the absence of that, what we ought to see is a select committee on this Veterans Administration scandal, which to me is every bit if not more important than the very important work of the Benghazi Select Committee
[01:29:09.670 --> 01:29:11.631]  Well, folks, you need to get behind your campaign.
[01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:21.655]  In closing, I'm no former federal prosecutor or constitutional lawyer like you, but this whole administration operates like an organized crime syndicate, like you said, racketeering.
[01:29:21.655 --> 01:29:27.678]  I mean, bottom line, do you think the Obama administration is a criminal enterprise?
[01:29:27.678 --> 01:29:33.200]  If I were still a prosecutor, the flags would be going up and waving and the red lights would be going off.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.541]  But where there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:29:35.262 --> 01:29:36.443]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:29:36.443 --> 01:29:39.406]  Hopefully we can get you back in the next month as things heat up.
[01:29:39.406 --> 01:29:40.587]  Thank you, Bob Barr.
[01:29:40.587 --> 01:29:42.429]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:29:42.429 --> 01:29:47.114]  There goes the former congressman, soon to be another congressman again, in the 11th district.
[01:29:47.114 --> 01:29:49.216]  BarrCongress.com.
[01:29:49.216 --> 01:29:50.617]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.617 --> 01:29:51.838]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.838 --> 01:29:53.159]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:29:53.159 --> 01:29:54.621]  Alex Jones and GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.621 --> 01:29:56.543]  The empire of collectivism is in trouble.
[01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:03.897]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:03.897 --> 01:30:08.241]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:08.241 --> 01:30:11.925]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:11.925 --> 01:30:14.968]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:14.968 --> 01:30:22.195]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:22.535 --> 01:30:26.437]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:26.437 --> 01:30:30.859]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:30.859 --> 01:30:36.842]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:36.842 --> 01:30:40.784]  You're right, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:40.784 --> 01:30:43.505]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:44.866]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:44.986 --> 01:30:46.367]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:46.367 --> 01:30:48.188]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:03.201 --> 01:31:10.646]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:31:10.646 --> 01:31:21.473]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:31:21.473 --> 01:31:30.699]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:35.502]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:31:35.502 --> 01:31:39.244]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:41.305]  Experience the new formula.
[01:31:41.305 --> 01:31:43.887]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:31:43.887 --> 01:31:45.228]  Shield your family.
[01:31:45.228 --> 01:31:47.049]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:59.372 --> 01:32:05.514]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:32:05.514 --> 01:32:08.836]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:08.836 --> 01:32:10.596]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:32:10.596 --> 01:32:16.959]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:16.959 --> 01:32:22.841]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:32:23.001 --> 01:32:26.965]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:26.965 --> 01:32:29.827]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:29.827 --> 01:32:38.315]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:38.315 --> 01:32:40.417]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:41.438]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:32:41.818 --> 01:32:50.762]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:33:10.811 --> 01:33:14.474]  You can run on for a long time.

[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:26.285]  Here are the headlines out of Arizona Republic and others.
[01:33:26.285 --> 01:33:28.807]  Migrants amassing at Rio Grande's edge.
[01:33:31.004 --> 01:33:38.966]  By the thousands, they can show the videos and photos of just the mass exodus into El Norte.
[01:33:38.966 --> 01:33:46.408]  A planned total invasion, a political invasion to join with the Democrats.
[01:33:46.408 --> 01:33:51.350]  And this is the move to totally take down America, as General Petraeus said, into the North American Union.
[01:33:53.504 --> 01:33:58.127]  Approval of Obama's handling of immigration falls to 31 percentage points.
[01:33:58.127 --> 01:34:02.230]  So see, even with Democrats, it's very unpopular now.
[01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:03.971]  That's in Gallup.
[01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:10.215]  That's from an all-time high of 62%.
[01:34:10.215 --> 01:34:14.497]  It's down by more than half.
[01:34:14.497 --> 01:34:19.120]  Dinesh D'Souza's America banished from the New York Times bestsellers list.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.922]  Didn't matter that it was on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:29.716]  They just removed it.
[01:34:29.716 --> 01:34:34.798]  It was already in the top ten, but they just removed it.
[01:34:34.798 --> 01:34:47.525]  So that's how they operate there, and we're getting reports of liberty-based, libertarian, that's what they're really afraid of, YouTube channels, you name it, being purged and removed everywhere.
[01:34:47.525 --> 01:34:52.707]  We're being blocked, still, by the Pentagon on many systems.
[01:34:52.707 --> 01:34:53.748]  This is how they're
[01:34:54.781 --> 01:34:58.808]  responding to us speaking out is trying to shut us up.
[01:34:58.808 --> 01:35:02.275]  That's why you can't take this show for granted and I know you know that.
[01:35:02.275 --> 01:35:06.582]  You can't take having an AM or FM station for granted in your area that carries my show.
[01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:15.737]  You can't take it for granted that you can go to Infowars.com and subscribe to the free podcast or watch the free video feed at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:35:15.737 --> 01:35:31.060]  You can't take it for granted that you can get a $5.95 a month PrisonPlanet.tv membership to see all my films in HD, 19 years of material, the site's been up for 12 years, the nightly news, special live reports, and then share it with 11 people simultaneously.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:35.101]  11 people can use your $5.95 a month membership.
[01:35:35.101 --> 01:35:36.381]  What a great way to wake folks up.
[01:35:38.547 --> 01:35:47.775]  And I know you don't take it for granted, most of you, but we aren't going to be here, and you're not going to have any liberty, if we don't win this thing.
[01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:50.798]  And winning just means surviving and backing them off.
[01:35:50.798 --> 01:35:54.441]  Because the more time we buy, the more time we can fix this country.
[01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:56.723]  Freedom is becoming more and more popular.
[01:35:56.723 --> 01:36:00.326]  Doesn't matter if half the public can't tie their shoelaces or are disassociated.
[01:36:01.067 --> 01:36:06.830]  Can't make connections, don't know who they are, look at TV screens all day and iPads and don't talk to each other.
[01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:13.753]  You go to a restaurant, half the folks are having passionate conversations, they're putting the iPhone in their bag, and they're becoming more human.
[01:36:13.753 --> 01:36:15.574]  But other people are sinking deeper into it.
[01:36:15.574 --> 01:36:20.716]  They're victims, I don't laugh at how dumb they are, I don't prey on them like the globalists, but I move on.
[01:36:20.716 --> 01:36:21.637]  You gotta triage them.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:23.300]  Triage.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:31.705]  You've got a thousand people blown up and you can spend all your time on those you can't save and then lose all the people in the middle that are on the borderline.
[01:36:31.705 --> 01:36:34.466]  You've got to save the people that you've got a chance to save.
[01:36:34.466 --> 01:36:36.827]  The ones that are too far gone, you can't save them.
[01:36:36.827 --> 01:36:37.748]  You don't have enough people.
[01:36:37.748 --> 01:36:40.129]  And it's the same thing.
[01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:47.673]  I'm not going to beat my head in the wall against some programmed cognitive dissonance person who can't be reached.
[01:36:47.673 --> 01:36:51.655]  I'm going to feel sorry for them and say, hey, when they hit you hard later, remember you were warned.
[01:36:51.655 --> 01:36:52.476]  Sometimes they'll remember.
[01:36:54.161 --> 01:36:56.562]  Move on to people that want to be awakened.
[01:36:56.562 --> 01:36:59.423]  You can figure out ways to not go along with the system.
[01:36:59.423 --> 01:37:03.024]  You don't need me to sit here and tell you everything every day.
[01:37:03.024 --> 01:37:04.325]  You know what needs to be done.
[01:37:04.325 --> 01:37:05.425]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:37:05.425 --> 01:37:12.248]  There's a lot of business owners out there who get sick of the new world order harassing them and Obamacare.
[01:37:12.248 --> 01:37:14.769]  And you shut down your carpet company.
[01:37:14.769 --> 01:37:17.070]  You shut down your publishing company.
[01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:18.610]  You shut down your car dealership.
[01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:20.131]  You shut down the restaurants you own.
[01:37:21.087 --> 01:37:24.532]  Your mama gets cancer, you're old, don't want to work anymore.
[01:37:24.532 --> 01:37:33.126]  People that are liberty lovers have to stay in business, have to make money to hire like-minded people and build a civilization and society.
[01:37:33.126 --> 01:37:35.970]  The globalists want to control money and markets to run our lives.
[01:37:37.076 --> 01:37:41.979]  The most aggressive thing you can do is have your own business, promote it, win.
[01:37:41.979 --> 01:37:44.981]  Christians put out a little fish symbol to say, do business with us.
[01:37:44.981 --> 01:37:47.923]  Why don't Liberty members put a rattlesnake in the window?
[01:37:47.923 --> 01:37:49.284]  Don't tread on me.
[01:37:49.284 --> 01:37:53.267]  And when you see that, do business with them.
[01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:55.889]  We have to work together.
[01:37:55.889 --> 01:37:56.849]  We have to buy local.
[01:37:59.608 --> 01:38:12.075]  Go into the minority communities and find restaurants we like and buy food from them and products from them and encourage them to come in to quote your community and support people that are doing it right.
[01:38:12.075 --> 01:38:17.398]  We've got to come together as humans around shared values of freedom.
[01:38:17.398 --> 01:38:19.519]  And what we've got is sexy, folks.
[01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:22.280]  What the Newell Motors is selling is bondage.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:25.902]  And we've got to talk the talk and walk the walk.
[01:38:25.902 --> 01:38:28.924]  And we can change society with the new Renaissance.
[01:38:30.672 --> 01:38:31.632]  A new enlightenment.
[01:38:31.632 --> 01:38:33.093]  We're on the edge of it.
[01:38:33.093 --> 01:38:39.515]  All this tyranny with the technocracy and the tracker chips and all new droids are coming out.
[01:38:39.515 --> 01:38:41.075]  That's in Wired Magazine today.
[01:38:41.075 --> 01:38:43.596]  We have an article on InfoWars.com about it.
[01:38:43.596 --> 01:38:51.379]  All new droids are coming out with kill switches in them so the government can kill all your phones with one butt.
[01:38:51.379 --> 01:38:54.300]  That's why I said there's going to be a big market in old tech in the future.
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:54.720]  Keep it.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.320]  Keep it running.
[01:38:56.684 --> 01:39:05.348]  Keep it working, old video cameras, new companies that will sell video cameras, you know, dash cams that don't have kill switches in them.
[01:39:05.348 --> 01:39:09.049]  You've got to realize life is a war.
[01:39:09.049 --> 01:39:11.730]  Being free is a war, and it's not work.
[01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:17.412]  Being involved, the first 20 times you exercise, again, worked out in years, it's horrible.
[01:39:17.412 --> 01:39:21.134]  But the 21st time, the 30th time, the 40th time, it becomes addicting.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:25.341]  And we gotta just turn the corner.
[01:39:25.341 --> 01:39:27.021]  We gotta make the decision to turn.
[01:39:27.021 --> 01:39:28.722]  The body will follow.
[01:39:28.722 --> 01:39:30.443]  And the rest of the people will follow as well.
[01:39:30.443 --> 01:39:32.263]  I wanna go to your calls.
[01:39:32.263 --> 01:39:37.505]  It's just that if you're a business owner, we're getting affiliates all over the country.
[01:39:37.505 --> 01:39:41.467]  And these, some of them are big stations, some of them small stations, some of them media stations.
[01:39:41.467 --> 01:39:46.128]  Some of them are business people that have been successful, are buying 50,000 waters and putting me on the air.
[01:39:46.128 --> 01:39:47.469]  It's happening all over the country.
[01:39:47.469 --> 01:39:48.789]  And we talk to these stations.
[01:39:48.789 --> 01:39:49.710]  We hear from them.
[01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:52.831]  And they're like, look, we know there's no future if we don't go all in.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:57.231]  Well, you got a business.
[01:39:57.231 --> 01:39:59.993]  You should say, you know, a big American flag billboard.
[01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:03.014]  Billboards are cheaper than ever now because we're in a depression.
[01:40:03.014 --> 01:40:08.237]  And say, tune into Alex Jones on this frequency.
[01:40:08.237 --> 01:40:12.219]  And then brought to you by your tile company.
[01:40:12.219 --> 01:40:15.301]  Brought to you by whatever you're doing.
[01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:17.142]  Or just put a website up there.
[01:40:18.143 --> 01:40:21.785]  Infowars.com, or you start a site and clone Infowars and put it up.
[01:40:21.785 --> 01:40:24.167]  That's even better, so they can't even take us down.
[01:40:24.167 --> 01:40:25.528]  I want you to redistribute.
[01:40:25.528 --> 01:40:30.030]  I want you to clone what we've done and then augment it with your own humet and intelligence.
[01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:32.852]  I'm waging a hardcore war here.
[01:40:32.852 --> 01:40:35.774]  I'm 100% ready for them to stick a gun to my head and blow my head off.
[01:40:35.774 --> 01:40:39.756]  I don't want to die, but I love life so much, it means nothing to me.
[01:40:39.756 --> 01:40:41.798]  It's beyond not having fear, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:41.798 --> 01:40:43.158]  It's wanting liberty.
[01:40:43.158 --> 01:40:45.200]  It's desiring it.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.901]  Above all things, to have free will.
[01:40:49.893 --> 01:41:11.806]  And if the people that are middle class that are targeted, if the veterans, and if the gun owners, and if the business owners, if you get aggressive and turn 10% of your energy towards doing your own local radio show, maybe 60% of the billboard's my show, and in the corner, tune in Sundays in your show.
[01:41:11.806 --> 01:41:19.131]  And just go, buy the time, sponsored by you, they'll give it to you, they'll put you on the air, you'll probably end up making the money back,
[01:41:20.063 --> 01:41:28.107]  When you plug your service to whoever you sell as advertisers, I told people how to do this, and then you will be talking to tens of thousands of people.
[01:41:28.107 --> 01:41:30.749]  Go to an access show, and you're like, well, I don't want to get on air.
[01:41:30.749 --> 01:41:31.389]  Well, you know what?
[01:41:31.389 --> 01:41:34.451]  We're going to lose everything.
[01:41:34.451 --> 01:41:36.452]  I realized that when I was 21 years old.
[01:41:36.452 --> 01:41:39.734]  I saw what was happening, and I saw it way off and knew it had to be countered.
[01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:44.171]  And I'm just as average as anybody.
[01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:47.612]  I got better at this doing it for 19 years.
[01:41:47.612 --> 01:41:48.313]  Just like you do.
[01:41:48.313 --> 01:41:50.053]  You worked out for 19 years.
[01:41:50.053 --> 01:41:52.494]  Folks, you're going to get in good shape.
[01:41:52.494 --> 01:41:59.596]  Well, I've been fighting these people right up at point-blank range for really 22 years, but 19 on air.
[01:41:59.596 --> 01:42:00.677]  And look what I've done.
[01:42:00.677 --> 01:42:02.898]  You can do it.
[01:42:02.898 --> 01:42:05.678]  But people ask, what do you do?
[01:42:05.678 --> 01:42:07.139]  You warn the public.
[01:42:07.139 --> 01:42:08.239]  You lead.
[01:42:08.239 --> 01:42:09.660]  By example, you get aggressive.
[01:42:10.945 --> 01:42:22.172]  And I want all the business owners out there to call your local AM and FM affiliate and say, I want to advertise on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:22.172 --> 01:42:36.442]  And maybe you pay at a discounted PSA rate and say, I'd like to just have one of your voice readers read the Second Amendment and the First Amendment, maybe a George Washington quote, and then say, brought to you by, you know, Johnson's tile.
[01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:37.763]  I'm just saying that like John Doe.
[01:42:39.079 --> 01:42:43.361]  Jones Tile or Jones Yard Service.
[01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:45.842]  And you're going to get a bigger response for your company.
[01:42:45.842 --> 01:43:01.748]  What's incredible about this is when you don't go with the standard advertising pitch, I'm telling myself this, that's what I know you do, and just go with, it's about the message, and by the way, I'm bringing you this information, you're going to get a better response, you're going to fund this show, you're going to help us reach more people.
[01:43:03.396 --> 01:43:04.517]  That's what you gotta do.
[01:43:04.517 --> 01:43:15.446]  I want every one of our AM and FM affiliates, whether it's affiliates in Austin, or Chicago, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Las Vegas, or Boston, or D.C., or Orlando.
[01:43:15.446 --> 01:43:18.468]  I don't care where you are.
[01:43:18.468 --> 01:43:19.089]  I'm going to your calls.
[01:43:19.089 --> 01:43:20.890]  I haven't even plugged anything.
[01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:23.152]  I need to plug so we can find ourselves.
[01:43:23.152 --> 01:43:26.455]  I need you.
[01:43:26.455 --> 01:43:29.617]  Because, you know, people talk about, oh, I'm buying guns, you know, I'm ready for a war.
[01:43:29.617 --> 01:43:30.038]  No, no, no.
[01:43:30.765 --> 01:43:36.887]  Let me tell you, if you don't fight now with billboards and going and speaking to the church, you know, is there anything now that we won't talk about the church?
[01:43:36.887 --> 01:43:41.469]  You should go to churches and get up and say, yeah, I'm here to talk about something and bring it up.
[01:43:41.469 --> 01:43:42.749]  Engage in leadership.
[01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.390]  They've captured most of the churches.
[01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:45.510]  They've captured the media.
[01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:46.991]  We've got to take it back.
[01:43:46.991 --> 01:43:52.293]  And you and your sector engage the enemy.
[01:43:52.293 --> 01:43:54.774]  They'll bleed out very quickly.
[01:43:54.774 --> 01:43:56.854]  Victory is in our hand.
[01:43:56.854 --> 01:43:58.415]  All we've got to do is close our hand around it.
[01:44:00.333 --> 01:44:11.656]  But it's going to take, like when I was 19, they were trying to ban guns in Austin because they didn't have laws passed by then to block, you know, cities violating state law and federal.
[01:44:11.656 --> 01:44:13.136]  It was hard to go before the city council.
[01:44:13.136 --> 01:44:14.836]  It was hard to go before county commissioners when I was 19.
[01:44:14.836 --> 01:44:25.199]  It was hard to go start an access show by myself in the control room with a camera and go on the air for the first time live to a big audience back then, that huge viewership.
[01:44:25.199 --> 01:44:29.200]  But I did it because I instinctively knew somebody had to do it.
[01:44:32.557 --> 01:44:34.318]  You gotta do it.
[01:44:34.318 --> 01:44:48.826]  And you gotta say, I'm gonna be a leader, God strengthen me, and you will have the fire and the leadership and people will connect with the fact that even though you may stumble over your words, even though you may blink in the bright lights of publicity, that you're real.
[01:44:48.826 --> 01:44:51.387]  And they'll come to you.
[01:44:51.387 --> 01:44:54.008]  Run for office, like Bratt and so many others are doing.
[01:44:54.008 --> 01:44:55.449]  They can't stop us all.
[01:44:55.449 --> 01:44:56.930]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[01:44:58.882 --> 01:44:59.862]  But you gotta get in the arena.
[01:44:59.862 --> 01:45:01.543]  You gotta get out of the bleachers, folks.
[01:45:01.543 --> 01:45:02.883]  You gotta get on the field.
[01:45:02.883 --> 01:45:05.264]  That's where the Animating Contest is happening.
[01:45:05.264 --> 01:45:09.085]  Join your ancestors in the Animating Contest.
[01:45:09.085 --> 01:45:10.406]  Cease to be a spectator.
[01:45:10.406 --> 01:45:12.826]  Cease to be a programmable robot.
[01:45:12.826 --> 01:45:14.527]  Become a man, a woman.
[01:45:17.403 --> 01:45:25.210]  I'm going to go to the caller who earlier, I'm going to have him briefly recap what happened to him when his wife threw him out and moved a cop in, didn't even get a restraining order.
[01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:27.712]  He came home, they called the cops on him.
[01:45:27.712 --> 01:45:32.717]  He was going to finish his story, but briefly, I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:45:32.717 --> 01:45:36.540]  We sell great supplements at Infowarslife.com, the nice and iodine, the super...
[01:45:38.044 --> 01:45:42.885]  Survival Shield X2, the Super Mel Vitality, the Super Film Mel Vitality.
[01:45:42.885 --> 01:45:47.126]  All of it really is powerful, organic, and has done a great thing for me, and you've heard the reviews.
[01:45:47.126 --> 01:45:49.546]  And it helps fund the operation, which is very expensive.
[01:45:49.546 --> 01:45:51.126]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:51.126 --> 01:45:54.507]  Very expensive to run this operation, but you've been helping us do it.
[01:45:54.507 --> 01:45:56.147]  We've got more of the lung cleanse in.
[01:45:56.147 --> 01:46:03.589]  We've got a detox special, more than 25% off running right now, with the Fluoride Shield and the Survival Shield X2.
[01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:04.589]  Together, both discounted.
[01:46:06.271 --> 01:46:07.913]  That's the best discount we've run so far.
[01:46:07.913 --> 01:46:11.376]  Introductory rate is very popular, so we'll do that while supplies last.
[01:46:11.376 --> 01:46:13.298]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:13.298 --> 01:46:19.023]  We still have the free stainless steel stands with 10% off promo code water with all orders of the ProPure.
[01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:26.812]  G2.0, systems that cut off the glyphosate, that's the Roundup, the fluoride, and hundreds of other chemicals.
[01:46:26.812 --> 01:46:35.314]  I mean, how evilly sensational is that that last week I saw a mainstream article that covered on the nightly news where, yeah, you're gonna call or call in about it.
[01:46:35.314 --> 01:46:36.834]  Then I went and looked, it was an article.
[01:46:36.834 --> 01:46:41.895]  Yeah, cities are admitting because of disclosure that there's hundreds of toxic chemicals they add to your water.
[01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:48.117]  It's toxic waste that you pay to get from these companies, the aluminum smelters they put in the water.
[01:46:49.118 --> 01:46:50.221]  That's so over the top.
[01:46:50.221 --> 01:46:52.047]  Can't we beat that?
[01:46:52.047 --> 01:46:53.010]  Can't we stop that?
[01:46:55.930 --> 01:47:01.252]  Well, if they won't do it at your city level yet, filter the water, support the broadcast, it's a win-win.
[01:47:01.252 --> 01:47:03.052]  If it's not a win-win, I don't promote it.
[01:47:03.052 --> 01:47:07.354]  Infowarsstore.com for those, or 888-253-3139.
[01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:13.816]  All right, we got Frank and Phil and Jay and Steve have been holding, in some cases, for an hour, and I apologize.
[01:47:13.816 --> 01:47:17.077]  We got another guest coming up, and I may back them off a little bit.
[01:47:17.077 --> 01:47:20.918]  But no, no, no, Chad Cooper is on at the bottom of the next hour, so plenty of time.
[01:47:20.918 --> 01:47:22.499]  I'll get to everybody, I promise.
[01:47:22.499 --> 01:47:23.579]  I'll try to shut up and
[01:47:25.253 --> 01:47:29.441]  Get to you, but wild horses couldn't drag me away from having the great honor to be speaking to you.
[01:47:29.441 --> 01:47:30.843]  Sir, finish your story in Minnesota.
[01:47:30.843 --> 01:47:34.911]  Recap it in one minute, and then in the two minutes we have after that, tell folks how it all ended.
[01:47:34.911 --> 01:47:35.231]  Go ahead.
[01:47:37.123 --> 01:47:37.643]  Uh, okay.
[01:47:37.643 --> 01:47:40.265]  So, um, stay at home dad.
[01:47:40.265 --> 01:47:45.367]  Um, the wife was taking over the family land development business doing really well.
[01:47:45.367 --> 01:47:48.909]  Um, I have a degree in music, uh, so I was a part-time musician.
[01:47:48.909 --> 01:47:55.752]  Uh, I'd stay home with my daughter during the day and teach out of the house in the evening and then gigs on the weekend.
[01:47:55.752 --> 01:47:57.073]  Yeah, standard, standard deal.
[01:47:57.073 --> 01:47:58.854]  And she married you and that's what she did.
[01:47:58.854 --> 01:48:00.755]  So you show up, the doors are locked, there's a cop in there.
[01:48:02.282 --> 01:48:03.202]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:48:03.202 --> 01:48:07.584]  Um, the doors are locked and I show up to give her a birthday present, trying to save the marriage.
[01:48:07.584 --> 01:48:09.784]  That's when I caught her with the cop.
[01:48:09.784 --> 01:48:20.927]  I didn't know he was a cop at the time, so I called the police and then I started filming the whole thing and just calmly asked the guy if he's been around my kid, what's going on.
[01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:22.908]  She filed an order for protection on me.
[01:48:23.832 --> 01:48:25.894]  And that's when I finally got an attorney.
[01:48:25.894 --> 01:48:35.624]  We go to court and it's thrown out because I have evidence and whatnot and they knew they couldn't, you know, fight me on it because I had the video.
[01:48:35.624 --> 01:48:40.889]  So right from then, I get temporary joint physical legal custody of my daughter.
[01:48:41.861 --> 01:48:53.864]  Um, after being homeless at that point, then I get a job as a janitor, uh, get a crappy one-bedroom apartment, and then ramp up to, uh, 50% time with my daughter.
[01:48:53.864 --> 01:48:58.265]  Um, but in the meantime, I gotta say, she packed my stuff up.
[01:48:58.265 --> 01:49:00.125]  I never got a choice on what I got.
[01:49:00.125 --> 01:49:02.186]  She packed up what she thought I should have.
[01:49:02.186 --> 01:49:05.947]  I mean, this is the standard deal designed to break up families.
[01:49:05.947 --> 01:49:07.287]  So you said it was a police state story.
[01:49:07.287 --> 01:49:09.548]  How did it end?
[01:49:09.548 --> 01:49:11.208]  Um, well, uh,
[01:49:12.108 --> 01:49:24.659]  It ends with me going to trial, but I just gotta say that, um, I, you know, I had my daughter for 50% of the time and then, uh, I asked for temporary relief because they weren't making an offer to me to end the divorce.
[01:49:24.659 --> 01:49:26.801]  I, she makes $6,000 a month.
[01:49:26.801 --> 01:49:28.162]  I was making like $1,200.
[01:49:28.162 --> 01:49:32.546]  But you're a man, you got one minute, finish it.
[01:49:32.546 --> 01:49:32.926]  Okay.
[01:49:32.926 --> 01:49:35.869]  So, um, I was denied that, uh, then,
[01:49:36.849 --> 01:49:45.633]  Out of nowhere she files a harassment restraining order on me for filming her at all of the exchanges and for sending co-parenting text messages.
[01:49:45.633 --> 01:49:50.295]  A harassment restraining order goes through and in there they tell me I can't film her.
[01:49:50.295 --> 01:49:53.496]  They're violating my First Amendment right and I can't tell my story.
[01:49:53.496 --> 01:49:55.437]  I can't put the video up.
[01:49:55.437 --> 01:49:57.158]  So... Look, look, look.
[01:49:57.158 --> 01:50:01.599]  She's done the wrong thing ditching you and breaking the family up, which hurts your daughter.
[01:50:01.599 --> 01:50:05.001]  She needs to demonize you to feel good about what she's done.
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:13.648]  Uh, so I would just try to forgive her and say for the best thing of our daughter, you did this to me, you know, be nice to me.
[01:50:13.648 --> 01:50:16.191]  I mean, have you tried doing that with her?
[01:50:16.191 --> 01:50:19.314]  Oh, that's what the harassment thing was about.
[01:50:19.314 --> 01:50:22.137]  I was trying to co-parent and say, well, let's work this out.
[01:50:22.137 --> 01:50:25.360]  Well, I mean, I know it's stacked against men.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.100]  That's the new rule order.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.262]  But I mean, how's it ending now?
[01:50:28.963 --> 01:50:36.167]  Um, now I haven't seen my daughter in three months, um, because she took my daughter away from me on my parenting times and I asked why.
[01:50:36.167 --> 01:50:39.509]  So, uh, apparently I need to have supervised visits.
[01:50:39.509 --> 01:50:44.832]  Um, but it ended with me going to trial two weeks ago on my own because the attorney... How did it end?
[01:50:44.832 --> 01:50:45.232]  How did it end?
[01:50:45.232 --> 01:50:46.393]  We got ten seconds.
[01:50:46.393 --> 01:50:47.453]  How did it end?
[01:50:47.453 --> 01:50:49.514]  Uh, I spanked him.
[01:50:49.514 --> 01:50:51.115]  I, I caught her lying on the stand.
[01:50:51.115 --> 01:50:52.156]  I, you know... Good!
[01:50:52.156 --> 01:50:53.737]  You fought the long haul, you beat her.
[01:50:53.737 --> 01:50:54.077]  You beat her?
[01:50:55.834 --> 01:50:56.314]  Yep.
[01:50:56.314 --> 01:50:57.615]  Good, good, good, good.
[01:50:57.615 --> 01:50:58.235]  We gotta go.
[01:50:58.235 --> 01:50:58.596]  That's okay.
[01:51:14.867 --> 01:51:17.190]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Minus Resources.

[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.461]  This can't happen in America.
[01:53:06.461 --> 01:53:08.142]  Because I'm not concerned about our government.
[01:53:08.692 --> 01:53:10.514]  I was looking at your label stuff.
[01:53:10.514 --> 01:53:13.997]  I was raised as a Girl Scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[01:53:13.997 --> 01:53:19.721]  Suit for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[01:53:19.721 --> 01:53:23.184]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, seeing as it's so good.
[01:53:23.184 --> 01:53:26.147]  I like the pricing for what I got.
[01:53:26.147 --> 01:53:28.308]  I like the containers they were shipped in.
[01:53:28.308 --> 01:53:29.810]  They keep in touch with you.
[01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:32.132]  You get your emails, you get your confirmations.
[01:53:32.132 --> 01:53:35.715]  The customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[01:53:36.295 --> 01:53:40.216]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[01:53:40.216 --> 01:53:43.036]  And this just came so quick, it came right when they said it would come.
[01:53:43.036 --> 01:53:49.178]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.

[01:54:09.188 --> 01:54:13.709]  All right, let's go to your calls quickly now.
[01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:16.210]  Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:54:16.210 --> 01:54:17.331]  And Phil, go ahead.
[01:54:17.331 --> 01:54:26.274]  I just thought a quick point I wanted to make using a couple of names, individuals that can be looked up very easily on YouTube.
[01:54:26.274 --> 01:54:32.736]  George W. Bush appointee, Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, and also the other one is Army General Wesley Clark.
[01:54:32.736 --> 01:54:34.377]  I'm pretty sure he's long retired now.
[01:54:37.372 --> 01:54:43.778]  Well, this Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, he caught a bunch of flack for his estimate on the cost of the Iraq War.
[01:54:43.778 --> 01:54:46.420]  I remember seeing that all over the news back during that time.
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:48.922]  And they basically found a way to push him out.
[01:54:48.922 --> 01:54:49.783]  Got rid of him.
[01:54:49.783 --> 01:54:54.127]  I think he was in trouble about some other stuff that he was being honest.
[01:54:54.127 --> 01:55:00.072]  And of course, his estimate was actually quite conservative at the time.
[01:55:01.693 --> 01:55:04.195]  This so far has surpassed and been too much.
[01:55:04.195 --> 01:55:10.241]  Well yeah, they said that we would make the money back on oil and make money, and now it's been how many trillions of dollars?
[01:55:10.241 --> 01:55:17.147]  Right, but that's all, I don't have the figures, but now there's something else though, and you can go on YouTube and watch this.
[01:55:17.147 --> 01:55:28.156]  I don't think it ever aired, but he did an interview with Leslie Stahl of 60 Minutes, I believe it was unaired, but he stated that in the first cabinet meeting they had, now this was many months before 9-11,
[01:55:29.679 --> 01:55:36.282]  He said that they were told by George W. Bush that they were going into Iraq.
[01:55:36.282 --> 01:55:37.443]  No, no, I played that clip.
[01:55:37.443 --> 01:55:43.826]  He said, this is before they even got in office, and he was president-elect, I believe.
[01:55:43.826 --> 01:55:45.306]  They had the maps up on the wall.
[01:55:45.306 --> 01:55:46.387]  Yeah, no, I've seen the interview.
[01:55:47.148 --> 01:55:56.650]  George W. Bush ran, and I voted for him too by the way, not proud of it, but he ran on a non-interventionist policy, a foreign policy.
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:59.190]  Now he knew that was a lie.
[01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:07.352]  Now I know he's not the brains of the criminal group and whatnot, just like Obama obviously isn't because he doesn't have a whole lot in the way of brains.
[01:56:07.352 --> 01:56:11.272]  But Army General Wesley Clark, you can go look this up, you can watch it real quick.
[01:56:11.272 --> 01:56:13.513]  He said there was a plan to invade seven countries.
[01:56:13.513 --> 01:56:15.333]  He's done two interviews, we've played it.
[01:56:15.373 --> 01:56:25.082]  Yeah, he went and spoke with some of the people that used to work for him at the State Department and the Pentagon and whatnot, and they said, General, General, come here, we gotta tell you, I gotta tell you something.
[01:56:25.082 --> 01:56:29.326]  He said, not only are we going into Afghanistan, we're going into Iraq, and he said, Iraq?
[01:56:29.326 --> 01:56:30.567]  Why are we going to Iraq?
[01:56:30.567 --> 01:56:32.569]  And he said, oh, it's much worse than that, General.
[01:56:32.569 --> 01:56:34.090]  We're going into all these other countries.
[01:56:34.090 --> 01:56:35.251]  What I'm saying is, the U.S.
[01:56:35.251 --> 01:56:40.516]  military is used, they're thought of as dumb animals to be used as pawns, they decide what they're gonna do,
[01:56:40.996 --> 01:56:54.629]  Where they're going to go, where they're going to intervene, where they're going to invade and take over, and then they fabricate a story to justify, to provide a pretext to manipulate the sheeple to go along with it.
[01:56:54.629 --> 01:57:00.915]  No, that is exactly, precisely what they do, and you basically quoted perfectly what Clark said.
[01:57:02.256 --> 01:57:07.059]  And it doesn't matter who we put in office, the Republican-Democratic leadership is the same group.
[01:57:07.059 --> 01:57:09.200]  And you notice it just continues on.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:13.342]  And it's not even to bring in an American empire or to put good governments in.
[01:57:13.342 --> 01:57:16.124]  It's to wreck and create destabilization.
[01:57:16.124 --> 01:57:23.668]  And of course, Henry Kissinger famously said, military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.
[01:57:23.668 --> 01:57:26.369]  And very well said, caller.
[01:57:26.369 --> 01:57:26.990]  Excellent call.
[01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.390]  Anything else?
[01:57:28.491 --> 01:57:34.017]  The thing is, I know it's painful to admit, but there is no noble cause in any of these wars.
[01:57:34.017 --> 01:57:35.578]  We're sold a bill of goods.
[01:57:35.578 --> 01:57:38.001]  It's all about deceiving, manipulating.
[01:57:38.001 --> 01:57:39.422]  It's all about control.
[01:57:39.422 --> 01:57:49.052]  In the end, I'm not saying there's not bravery, there's not courage amongst people in the military, but man, once you've done two or three enlistments,
[01:57:49.392 --> 01:57:52.313]  I mean, wake up and don't you know you're being used?
[01:57:52.313 --> 01:57:53.314]  There's no noble conscience.
[01:57:53.314 --> 01:57:54.615]  I came back to see him a few weeks later.
[01:58:04.657 --> 01:58:06.799]  And by that time, we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[01:58:06.799 --> 01:58:08.460]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:10.382]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[01:58:10.382 --> 01:58:18.148]  He said, he reached over on his desk, he picked up a piece of paper, he said, I just, he said, I just got this down from upstairs from the Secretary of Defense's office today.
[01:58:18.148 --> 01:58:30.559]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[01:58:30.999 --> 01:58:32.060]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.160]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.141]  Your calls.
[01:58:34.141 --> 01:58:36.062]  Special guest who's being censored.
[01:58:36.062 --> 01:58:38.023]  Part of this reign of censorship that's going on.
[01:58:38.023 --> 01:58:40.744]  Stay with us.

[01:58:50.249 --> 01:58:56.332]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:58:56.332 --> 01:59:00.474]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:00.874 --> 01:59:05.875]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:05.875 --> 01:59:08.796]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:59:08.796 --> 01:59:14.237]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:59:14.237 --> 01:59:21.618]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[01:59:21.618 --> 01:59:25.759]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:59:25.759 --> 01:59:30.520]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:39.322]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:59:39.322 --> 01:59:43.743]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:59:55.266 --> 01:59:58.047]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.027 --> 02:00:07.328]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.328 --> 02:00:09.089]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.089 --> 02:00:10.851]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.851 --> 02:00:12.452]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.452 --> 02:00:13.993]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.993 --> 02:00:18.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.196 --> 02:00:22.279]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.372 --> 02:00:46.595]  In February of this year, we reported that 50 Americans were fighting alongside Syrian rebels and Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:46.595 --> 02:00:49.537]  Now, with the backing of Saudi money and U.S.
[02:00:49.537 --> 02:00:52.018]  government money, they've grown.
[02:00:52.018 --> 02:00:55.920]  And their name is ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
[02:00:57.008 --> 02:01:00.629]  They're taking over the country that we were supposed to help liberate.
[02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:09.452]  Inch by inch, mile by mile, head by head, ISIS is destroying everything that we fought for and mid-died for in Iraq.
[02:01:09.452 --> 02:01:13.233]  And this isn't the first time that our government has done this.
[02:01:13.233 --> 02:01:17.614]  Let's remember here, the people we are fighting today, we funded.
[02:01:18.374 --> 02:01:22.755]  I can't see fighting to impose Sharia law in Syria.
[02:01:22.755 --> 02:01:27.476]  I also can't see sending my son to fight with Islamic rebels against Christians.
[02:01:27.476 --> 02:01:32.697]  I also can't see my son going to fight on the same side as Al-Qaeda.
[02:01:32.697 --> 02:01:40.138]  There's so many ironies and unfortunate muddling nature to this that I can't see why we should get involved.
[02:01:40.138 --> 02:01:45.279]  So here's a list of different countries that we've gone into and supported terrorists.
[02:01:45.859 --> 02:01:51.443]  I found an interesting article on Alternet.org titled, 35 countries where the U.S.
[02:01:51.443 --> 02:01:54.965]  has supported fascists, drug lords, and terrorists.
[02:01:54.965 --> 02:01:57.827]  Number one would be Afghanistan.
[02:01:57.827 --> 02:02:00.349]  After Mikhail Gorbachev withdrew Soviet forces in 1989,
[02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:11.638]  These U.S.-backed warlords tore the country apart and boosted opium production to an unprecedented level of 2,000 to 3,000 tons per year.
[02:02:11.638 --> 02:02:16.481]  The Taliban government cut opium production by 95% in two years between 1999 and 2001.
[02:02:16.481 --> 02:02:16.942]  But the U.S.
[02:02:16.942 --> 02:02:20.024]  invasion in 2001 restored the warlords' and drug lords' power.
[02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:28.138]  And let's go recruit these Mujahideen, and that's great.
[02:02:28.138 --> 02:02:34.779]  Let's get some to come from Saudi Arabia and other places, importing their Wahhabi brand of Islam.
[02:02:34.779 --> 02:02:39.480]  Another country where America has supported terrorist activity would be Mexico.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.381]  The death toll in Mexico's drug war has recently passed 100,000.
[02:02:43.381 --> 02:02:47.081]  The most violent of the drug cartels is Los Zetas.
[02:02:47.081 --> 02:02:47.221]  U.S.
[02:02:47.221 --> 02:02:54.283]  officials call the Zetas the most technologically advanced, sophisticated, and dangerous drug cartel operating in Mexico.
[02:02:55.003 --> 02:02:59.532]  The Zetas Cartel was formed by Mexican security forces, trained by U.S.
[02:02:59.532 --> 02:03:05.063]  Special Forces at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia and at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
[02:03:06.095 --> 02:03:08.497]  Another instance was in Nicaragua.
[02:03:08.497 --> 02:03:13.761]  Anastasio Somasa ruled Nicaragua for 43 years with unconditional U.S.
[02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:23.289]  support, and his National Guard committed every crime imaginable, from massacres and torture to extortion and rape, with complete impunity.
[02:03:23.289 --> 02:03:30.255]  The CIA recruited, trained, and supported Contra mercenaries to invade Nicaragua and conduct terrorism to destabilize the country.
[02:03:30.495 --> 02:03:39.325]  Well, as you can see, those are just a few examples of instances where our government has helped fund and back terrorists in different countries around the world.
[02:03:39.325 --> 02:03:40.867]  I encourage you to go check out that article.
[02:03:40.867 --> 02:03:42.189]  It's a really neat article.
[02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:44.872]  It talks about 35 countries that we've done that in.
[02:03:44.872 --> 02:03:47.255]  Look at it, inform yourself, and get educated.
[02:03:48.857 --> 02:03:49.217]  U.S.
[02:03:49.217 --> 02:03:50.217]  Terror, Inc.
[02:03:50.217 --> 02:03:53.158]  That video's going up on InfoWars.com.
[02:03:53.158 --> 02:04:01.959]  That's the type of journalism that former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is bringing to InfoWars Nightly News five nights a week.
[02:04:01.959 --> 02:04:08.540]  And we've got these great reporters now, where we can now send reporters out to multiple events daily.
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:13.981]  And we've got multiple events, press conferences, you name it, where it should be on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:04:13.981 --> 02:04:15.442]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:04:15.442 --> 02:04:17.842]  So much of what doesn't get on the daytime radio show
[02:04:19.107 --> 02:04:24.848]  Because of my incessant babbling, does end up getting on the nightly news.
[02:04:24.848 --> 02:04:27.849]  In fact, that's why the nightly news is so incredibly vital.
[02:04:27.849 --> 02:04:31.010]  And of course, more and more I'm hosting it, or shooting pieces for it.
[02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:34.891]  You've seen the new studio, it's pretty nice, and there's a lot more you haven't seen yet.
[02:04:34.891 --> 02:04:40.992]  So, that's all getting phased in, as we try to keep all the other things we're doing juggling in the air.
[02:04:40.992 --> 02:04:42.613]  Alright, I'm going right to Phil.
[02:04:43.613 --> 02:04:45.554]  Right to Phil when we come back.
[02:04:45.554 --> 02:04:46.874]  Then Steve.
[02:04:46.874 --> 02:04:47.575]  Then Jay.
[02:04:47.575 --> 02:04:48.635]  Then Mike.
[02:04:48.635 --> 02:04:50.196]  Then Fox.
[02:04:50.196 --> 02:04:50.656]  Be ready.
[02:04:50.656 --> 02:04:54.357]  I'm going right to you on the other side of this break straight ahead.
[02:04:54.357 --> 02:04:57.679]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[02:05:00.290 --> 02:05:02.533]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:05:02.533 --> 02:05:10.603]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:17.692]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:05:18.112 --> 02:05:22.716]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:05:22.716 --> 02:05:33.345]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:05:33.345 --> 02:05:39.850]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:39.850 --> 02:05:42.412]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:42.412 --> 02:05:46.055]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:05:46.215 --> 02:05:48.158]  It's not just the Super Mel Vitality.
[02:05:48.158 --> 02:05:52.345]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[02:05:52.345 --> 02:05:59.275]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:06:00.174 --> 02:06:04.216]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:04.216 --> 02:06:08.579]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:08.579 --> 02:06:12.241]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:12.241 --> 02:06:15.243]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:15.243 --> 02:06:22.848]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:22.848 --> 02:06:26.490]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:31.173]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:31.173 --> 02:06:37.138]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:37.138 --> 02:06:41.080]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:43.822]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:43.822 --> 02:06:45.323]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:45.323 --> 02:06:46.704]  It's time to take action.
[02:06:46.704 --> 02:06:48.526]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:07:00.095 --> 02:07:07.281]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:07.281 --> 02:07:09.623]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:09.623 --> 02:07:14.907]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:14.907 --> 02:07:20.071]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:20.071 --> 02:07:23.114]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:23.374 --> 02:07:27.457]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:27.457 --> 02:07:31.780]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:42.008]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:42.008 --> 02:07:44.530]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:52.917]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:52.917 --> 02:07:56.901]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:12.781]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:12.781 --> 02:08:15.743]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:15.743 --> 02:08:18.384]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.384 --> 02:08:25.407]  Chaos is hanging around.
[02:08:25.407 --> 02:08:28.388]  Put your ear to the ground.
[02:08:28.388 --> 02:08:30.149]  And shudder from the sound.
[02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:34.731]  The death machine is coming down.
[02:08:34.731 --> 02:08:36.392]  It's getting powerful.
[02:08:37.884 --> 02:08:39.304]  Shooter Jennings called the other day.
[02:08:39.304 --> 02:08:42.085]  He said, I got a new album coming out soon.
[02:08:42.085 --> 02:08:49.508]  He, of course, is the son of the legendary outlaw country musician Waylon Jennings.
[02:08:49.508 --> 02:09:01.452]  I think he's just as good a musician as his father, whether it's rockabilly, country, or this type of music we're listening to right now that he collaborated on with Stephen King.
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:19.325]  You can't trust nothing but the love in your mama's eyes.
[02:09:19.325 --> 02:09:23.227]  Salvation is in your smile.
[02:09:23.227 --> 02:09:24.908]  The smile of a child.
[02:09:24.908 --> 02:09:26.669]  Caring about the species.
[02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:28.930]  Caring about the general goodwill.
[02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:33.773]  Not using the claim that you care about it as an excuse to dominate and take over civilization.
[02:09:33.773 --> 02:09:36.694]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:09:36.694 --> 02:09:37.935]  I've got one clip I want to play.
[02:09:37.935 --> 02:09:39.336]  This just broke at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:41.004 --> 02:09:44.487]  Paul Ryan to IRS Commissioner, nobody believes you.
[02:09:44.487 --> 02:10:01.744]  And see, after people like Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz get attacked and make it popular to ask real questions, now people like Paul Ryan, who I don't trust as far as I could throw him, and Marco Rubio and Chris Christie and the rest of these people, that have been double-crossed by Obama,
[02:10:02.807 --> 02:10:06.068]  There's no honor among these people can come out and tell the truth.
[02:10:06.068 --> 02:10:08.569]  Because no one does believe them.
[02:10:08.569 --> 02:10:10.949]  7% approval rating for Congress.
[02:10:10.949 --> 02:10:11.750]  They say a new low.
[02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:14.110]  I saw one at 6, but it was 9.
[02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:16.471]  TV, lowest approval rating in Gallup.
[02:10:16.471 --> 02:10:19.112]  People don't trust mainstream.
[02:10:19.112 --> 02:10:23.313]  So MSNBC can say I'm a racist and a criminal and a terrorist with no proof?
[02:10:23.313 --> 02:10:26.314]  Please!
[02:10:26.314 --> 02:10:28.295]  That'd be like Jeffrey Dahmer saying I'm a bad guy.
[02:10:28.295 --> 02:10:29.615]  Because I'm calling him out.
[02:10:31.769 --> 02:10:32.329]  Ted Bundy.
[02:10:32.329 --> 02:10:33.030]  I mean, I don't care.
[02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:39.455]  And again, it's not that I'm on some goody-two-shoes high horse.
[02:10:39.455 --> 02:10:45.461]  It's that you people are a pack of scum and I am not going to be in league with you.
[02:10:45.461 --> 02:10:47.362]  You can call me whatever names you want.
[02:10:47.362 --> 02:10:49.224]  Your time's coming to an end.
[02:10:49.224 --> 02:10:51.265]  Now, here's the rest of the story.
[02:10:51.265 --> 02:10:54.348]  We've got to decide what we're going to do and try to have a moral society.
[02:10:54.348 --> 02:10:55.089]  Doesn't mean that
[02:10:56.209 --> 02:11:02.013]  The general rot won't still continue, just because the system, the people at the top who are the worst, are now exposed.
[02:11:02.013 --> 02:11:04.295]  We have to be better men and women.
[02:11:04.295 --> 02:11:05.696]  I'm going to stop preaching right there.
[02:11:05.696 --> 02:11:11.180]  Let's go to this clip, and then Obama considers airstrikes in Syria on terrorists he previously supported.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:16.644]  See, I won't bomb Iraq where my Al-Qaeda are invading, but I will attack Syria
[02:11:17.728 --> 02:11:18.368]  I don't believe you.
[02:11:48.199 --> 02:11:49.153]  This is incredible!
[02:11:50.572 --> 02:11:51.593]  I have a long career.
[02:11:51.593 --> 02:11:54.375]  That's the first time anybody has said that you do not believe me.
[02:11:54.375 --> 02:11:55.596]  I'm actually... I don't believe you.
[02:11:55.596 --> 02:11:56.237]  That's fine.
[02:11:56.237 --> 02:11:57.217]  We can have a disagreement.
[02:11:57.217 --> 02:11:58.678]  I'm willing to stand on our record.
[02:11:58.678 --> 02:12:02.221]  I'm willing to remind you that it was not buried in 27 pages.
[02:12:02.221 --> 02:12:04.523]  Most of that 27 pages is exhibits.
[02:12:04.523 --> 02:12:11.549]  When asked about the custodians, we advised you... forthcoming, which we knew for one day... Being forthcoming is to say... I'm sorry.
[02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:15.532]  You know what, investigators, Congress who's investigating this... Will you let him answer the question?
[02:12:15.532 --> 02:12:16.993]  I didn't ask him a question.
[02:12:16.993 --> 02:12:17.974]  Yes, you did.
[02:12:17.974 --> 02:12:18.594]  The gentleman...
[02:12:22.268 --> 02:12:23.528]  I control the time.
[02:12:23.528 --> 02:12:28.390]  I realize that disrupting a hearing sort of... No, come on.
[02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:32.172]  ...assists certain people, but the gentleman from Wisconsin... I am not yielding time.
[02:12:32.172 --> 02:12:33.193]  I control the time.
[02:12:33.193 --> 02:12:34.853]  He has the time.
[02:12:34.853 --> 02:12:36.994]  Here's what being forthcoming is.
[02:12:36.994 --> 02:12:42.757]  If we are investigating criminal wrongdoing, targeting of people based on their political beliefs,
[02:12:43.929 --> 02:12:52.992]  And the emails in question are lost because of a hard drive crash that is apparently unrecoverable, which a lot of IT professionals will question.
[02:12:52.992 --> 02:12:56.193]  And you don't tell us about it until we ask you about it.
[02:12:56.193 --> 02:12:57.613]  That is not being forthcoming.
[02:12:57.613 --> 02:12:59.334]  And that's true.
[02:12:59.334 --> 02:13:00.394]  I yield back the balance of my time.
[02:13:00.394 --> 02:13:01.215]  That's not true.
[02:13:01.215 --> 02:13:02.615]  The gentleman yields back.
[02:13:02.615 --> 02:13:05.196]  The gentleman has yielded back his time.
[02:13:05.196 --> 02:13:07.077]  Thank you.
[02:13:07.077 --> 02:13:10.978]  By the way, I mean, look at the IRS commissioner acting like he's outraged.
[02:13:12.062 --> 02:13:28.986]  When that snake demon takes old ladies' houses 24-7 and people's wedding rings to feed it into the big mega-banks that are tax-exempt in banker bailouts, they get it coming and going, and then act like, by the way, they don't save them on her hard drive.
[02:13:28.986 --> 02:13:36.608]  The emails, unless you save them there, are on the servers, and under federal law, they're all saved, and they're there, just like Fast and Furious.
[02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:37.388]  It's all lies.
[02:13:39.087 --> 02:13:39.287]  I think?
[02:13:53.373 --> 02:13:59.575]  I mean, I'm just sick of it, you know, him acting like he's the good boy, you know, professional athlete or skier or whatever.
[02:13:59.575 --> 02:14:02.216]  And, you know, he's more like Eddie Haskell or something.
[02:14:02.216 --> 02:14:05.717]  But finally, they're being forced by real patriots to ask real questions.
[02:14:05.717 --> 02:14:08.638]  See, we're going to radicalize the Republican Party.
[02:14:08.638 --> 02:14:10.018]  We're going to force them to cover real issues.
[02:14:10.018 --> 02:14:11.119]  I'm going to shut up now.
[02:14:11.119 --> 02:14:13.099]  Phil in New York, you're a trooper for holding.
[02:14:13.099 --> 02:14:14.120]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:14.840]  You're on the air.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:15.200]  Go ahead.
[02:14:16.095 --> 02:14:21.897]  Hi there, I thought we maybe should take the battle to them in small ways.
[02:14:21.897 --> 02:14:26.418]  Hillary is going to have a book signing in Chappaqua, Connecticut.
[02:14:26.418 --> 02:14:28.719]  Anybody can go, I guess.
[02:14:28.719 --> 02:14:32.240]  It's on Greeley Avenue in Chappaqua, and it's going to be on the 29th of this month.
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:42.645]  Another way of maybe taking this to the enemy is having a card campaign showing the different parts of the country that just fed up with these people.
[02:14:42.645 --> 02:14:45.727]  Send it to their business address, their personal address.
[02:14:45.727 --> 02:14:49.749]  Hillary lives on Old House Lane if they want to send it to Chappaqua.
[02:14:49.749 --> 02:14:50.089]  Good old
[02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:52.971]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[02:14:52.971 --> 02:14:54.172]  Hillary is in Austin, Texas today.
[02:15:10.994 --> 02:15:18.037]  And a lot of times they sell tickets to get in, but the press should be there, and we'll see what happens on the Notly News tonight.
[02:15:18.037 --> 02:15:20.438]  Gee, I don't know.
[02:15:20.438 --> 02:15:22.319]  And of course on the Sunday Show.
[02:15:22.319 --> 02:15:34.543]  But everywhere she goes, people should go in, they should ask questions about, what do you mean the promotion of the Second Amendment is terrorism?
[02:15:34.543 --> 02:15:35.264]  What do you mean
[02:15:36.806 --> 02:15:39.047]  You know, what difference does Benghazi make?
[02:15:39.047 --> 02:15:40.769]  And they should be under siege everywhere.
[02:15:40.769 --> 02:15:43.830]  They're already talking about her not running.
[02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:47.073]  Because she's so unpopular and focus groups with Democrats.
[02:15:47.073 --> 02:15:47.353]  Okay?
[02:15:47.353 --> 02:15:48.533]  I mean, I hope she runs.
[02:15:48.533 --> 02:15:50.795]  I mean, she is a disgusting witch.
[02:15:50.795 --> 02:15:52.176]  And it'll totally blow up in their face.
[02:15:52.176 --> 02:15:56.879]  And it isn't that I think the Republican presidential candidate, whoever gets it, will save us.
[02:15:56.879 --> 02:16:01.742]  It's that it's all about a rejection of the Clinton crime network.
[02:16:01.742 --> 02:16:03.083]  And so, yes, everywhere
[02:16:04.375 --> 02:16:13.323]  She goes, people with focused, serious questions, and then if a security guard walks up like you've done something wrong, be calm, and say, hey man, it's America!
[02:16:13.323 --> 02:16:15.245]  I'm asking a question here!
[02:16:15.245 --> 02:16:23.793]  You know, so many times with the police and bureaucrats, they're not even so much bad people, it's that our body language is like, we've done something wrong.
[02:16:23.793 --> 02:16:26.555]  And you know, a cop charges up to me for asking a question, I go, hey man!
[02:16:27.668 --> 02:16:30.851]  It's the press conference, or it's a question and answer.
[02:16:30.851 --> 02:16:32.613]  America wants that answered.
[02:16:32.613 --> 02:16:35.016]  Is it not an American value to go out and ask this question?
[02:16:35.016 --> 02:16:37.258]  And if they say then leave, leave!
[02:16:37.258 --> 02:16:41.382]  But we all need to get out of our comfort zones.
[02:16:42.683 --> 02:16:50.428]  And all of us, just have a buddy go with a little flip phone or their iPhone, videotape you asking the question, put it on YouTube.
[02:16:50.428 --> 02:16:52.529]  Say you're not technical like me.
[02:16:52.529 --> 02:16:55.471]  Have somebody that is show you how to upload stuff to YouTube.
[02:16:55.471 --> 02:17:00.194]  I mean, I've been doing that for, you know, by myself for, since YouTube came out.
[02:17:01.635 --> 02:17:07.840]  And I say I'm not technical, I've gotten pretty technical over the years, just learning to get stuff done myself when I work by myself on the weekend.
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:14.185]  People see me upload videos sometimes from the road or, you know, while I'm cooking eggs for the kids.
[02:17:14.185 --> 02:17:16.067]  Because it's always a war.
[02:17:16.067 --> 02:17:21.931]  I mean, because freedom isn't free, and now the final phase of evil is here.
[02:17:21.931 --> 02:17:23.072]  We better stand up against it.
[02:17:23.072 --> 02:17:23.953]  Great points.
[02:17:23.953 --> 02:17:24.594]  Anything else, Phil?
[02:17:26.036 --> 02:17:26.837]  One last point.
[02:17:26.837 --> 02:17:36.904]  I think we should call up the advertisers of the New York Times and tell them, look, they should boycott the New York Times until they put D'Souza's list on there.
[02:17:36.904 --> 02:17:41.947]  They don't have a right to deprive him of his rightful place on the list.
[02:17:41.947 --> 02:17:44.109]  Well, I mean, it just shows the New York Times is a fraud.
[02:17:44.109 --> 02:17:47.191]  I mean, who wants to read a paper or go see a race where it's rigged?
[02:17:47.191 --> 02:17:53.516]  I mean, that's why Don King ruined professional boxing and cut back the profits because people knew it was rigged.
[02:17:54.176 --> 02:17:58.839]  Hey Alex, you know what's a real shame is the fact that our veterans are, they're starving on the streets.
[02:18:19.136 --> 02:18:23.480]  You know, people like my dad have been waiting eight months to see a doctor who's a Vietnam veteran.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:28.364]  Joe Biggs coughs up blood every night, and he can't even get in to see the VA.
[02:18:28.364 --> 02:18:35.791]  Yeah, I mean, he got shot in the shoulder in Vietnam, and I mean, they won't even, you know, it's a shame.
[02:18:35.791 --> 02:18:39.654]  I mean, they're treating these illegal immigrants like they're royalty.
[02:18:39.654 --> 02:18:40.455]  Well, they are royalty.
[02:18:40.455 --> 02:18:41.376]  They're going to take our guns.
[02:18:41.792 --> 02:18:45.073]  Oh yeah, the Democratic voters are going to take your guns, my guns, take our rights.
[02:18:45.073 --> 02:18:45.434]  Everything!
[02:18:45.434 --> 02:18:46.834]  No, they rule us!
[02:18:46.834 --> 02:18:50.316]  We're being conquered by mafia!
[02:18:50.316 --> 02:18:53.017]  I mean, they mean business, yeah?
[02:18:53.017 --> 02:19:00.821]  Yeah, I mean, for people that don't think our government funds Al Qaeda, my dad handled documents that were for bin Laden.
[02:19:00.821 --> 02:19:08.184]  They were training documents back in, I think it was the 70s, back in the time of the Vietnam War, so this has been going on for a long time.
[02:19:09.346 --> 02:19:13.689]  Well, his codename in the CIA declassified was Tim Osman.
[02:19:13.689 --> 02:19:15.190]  And it was all staged with Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:16.751]  He just took the blame.
[02:19:16.751 --> 02:19:18.533]  He had nothing to do with it, folks.
[02:19:18.533 --> 02:19:22.796]  He was there organizing terror groups, but he wasn't actually quarterbacking anything.
[02:19:22.796 --> 02:19:24.597]  I don't even want to get into it.
[02:19:24.597 --> 02:19:27.659]  I have... I know NSA whistleblowers.
[02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:28.220]  Folks know that.
[02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:29.020]  Sabel Edmonds and others.
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.381]  But I've talked to other whistleblowers.
[02:19:30.381 --> 02:19:33.784]  And, you know, the point is, is that people don't go public.
[02:19:33.784 --> 02:19:34.865]  There's no point even talking about it.
[02:19:35.267 --> 02:19:37.648]  But in Saudi Arabia, it's a big joke.
[02:19:37.648 --> 02:19:40.650]  The sheiks and people party, you know, here in Austin.
[02:19:40.650 --> 02:19:44.192]  You know, Saudi princes, they just brag about it, their whole plan.
[02:19:44.192 --> 02:19:46.353]  And they think it's funny.
[02:19:46.353 --> 02:19:48.374]  So, yeah, no.
[02:19:48.374 --> 02:19:51.556]  It's attack us, and then turn America into a police state.
[02:19:51.556 --> 02:19:55.918]  And then their enemy, Iraq, gets attacked when they were the main drivers.
[02:19:55.918 --> 02:19:56.498]  It's incredible.
[02:19:56.498 --> 02:19:57.839]  Thank you so much, Steve.
[02:19:57.839 --> 02:19:59.460]  We'll be back with more Call Center.
[02:20:00.501 --> 02:20:04.668]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[02:20:04.668 --> 02:20:08.373]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks!
[02:20:08.373 --> 02:20:15.484]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[02:20:15.945 --> 02:20:16.386]  We're good to
[02:20:34.827 --> 02:20:40.532]  This may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:46.358]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[02:20:46.358 --> 02:20:48.420]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[02:22:08.703 --> 02:22:09.503]  This capitalism?
[02:22:09.503 --> 02:22:15.668]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[02:24:11.264 --> 02:24:13.005]  Jay is calling from Hong Kong.
[02:24:13.005 --> 02:24:15.385]  I would have gone to him first if I had actually read where he was calling from.
[02:24:15.385 --> 02:24:18.006]  I'm going to go to Mike and others.
[02:24:18.006 --> 02:24:19.506]  Jay in Hong Kong, you're on the air.
[02:24:19.506 --> 02:24:21.707]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:21.707 --> 02:24:26.508]  Hello, long-time listener and first-time caller.
[02:24:26.508 --> 02:24:28.729]  Two points.
[02:24:28.729 --> 02:24:29.769]  First for Bob Barr.
[02:24:30.643 --> 02:24:36.908]  How do you think he reconciles his Iraq war vote with his libertarian principles?
[02:24:36.908 --> 02:24:39.329]  Yeah, I'll bring that up and I mean I'll be honest with you.
[02:24:39.329 --> 02:24:42.992]  I've been, I cut my teeth going after Clinton and then Bush.
[02:24:42.992 --> 02:24:49.236]  Obama is so virulent and the globalists are making their full move through him, trying to extinct even the Republican Party.
[02:24:50.137 --> 02:24:52.440]  That I overlooked some of the things.
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:57.465]  He apologized for voting for the Patriot Act up front, said it was bad, later it should be repealed.
[02:24:57.465 --> 02:25:00.368]  There was incredible pressure and a lot of lies about the Iraq War.
[02:25:01.539 --> 02:25:06.142]  I know he's backed off on it some, but said, you know, it's better than what's happening now.
[02:25:06.142 --> 02:25:07.623]  Bob Barr's not perfect.
[02:25:07.623 --> 02:25:21.393]  But compared to the Democrat he's running against, who's for a gun ban, I mean, we're down to brass tacks now, where the Republicans, as bad as some of the things they do, the Democrats are cancer.
[02:25:21.393 --> 02:25:25.656]  And if the Republicans were acting like this, I would be for the Democrats.
[02:25:25.656 --> 02:25:28.118]  I mean, the Democrats are going for it all.
[02:25:29.068 --> 02:25:29.928]  Right now.
[02:25:29.928 --> 02:25:39.593]  But I know I hear your point on Bob Barr, and that was 11 years ago, and now he'll have more libertarian support to not be for things like that.
[02:25:39.593 --> 02:25:40.753]  And I absolutely hear what you're saying.
[02:25:40.753 --> 02:25:41.694]  I think it's very legitimate.
[02:25:43.536 --> 02:25:49.240]  Okay, the other point I have for you, Alex, is I talk to yuppies in Hong Kong, right?
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:53.783]  I talk to overseas Americans.
[02:25:53.783 --> 02:25:55.945]  Many of them are complacent.
[02:25:55.945 --> 02:25:58.507]  I talk to them about 9-11.
[02:25:58.507 --> 02:26:05.652]  I talk to them about MH370, which you're one of the few media sources that have
[02:26:06.332 --> 02:26:13.016]  Really done justice to that story and provided a plausible explanation for what went down.
[02:26:13.016 --> 02:26:20.380]  How do I get them to understand that that and Iraq and the financial meltdown are all connected?
[02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:29.985]  I mean, they'll complain about the federal government coming after their bank accounts under FATCA, but they don't see how it's all connected.
[02:26:29.985 --> 02:26:32.447]  I mean, this is how it's connected.
[02:26:32.447 --> 02:26:34.108]  You have different governing philosophies.
[02:26:34.977 --> 02:26:38.658]  There's been a lot of different systems throughout history.
[02:26:38.658 --> 02:26:44.619]  There's been the mercantile French systems, and there's been the Venetian Black nobility and their economic systems.
[02:26:44.619 --> 02:26:46.860]  There's been fascism and communism.
[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:54.622]  What we have now is a form of corporatism, or train-rec-ism, wrecker-ism, where
[02:26:55.546 --> 02:27:08.133]  It's kind of like corrupt lawyers will play off against their clients if you've got bad lawyers and keep the fight in divorce or whatever the case is going as long as possible.
[02:27:08.133 --> 02:27:20.240]  The system milking humanity, even as the whole system collapses, like Max Keiser calls them suicide bankers who were still doing trades as the World Trade Centers collapsed.
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:22.722]  One of them made $15 million in 10 minutes, but he was dead.
[02:27:23.701 --> 02:27:29.366]  So it's a mentality of not having wisdom, they only have knowledge.
[02:27:29.366 --> 02:27:37.934]  And so if people don't know how things are connected, FEMA did a horrible job at Katrina, they got their funding massively increased.
[02:27:37.934 --> 02:27:43.959]  People don't get in trouble or fired or indicted for doing really bad stuff in government and corporations.
[02:27:43.959 --> 02:27:44.599]  What does it do?
[02:27:44.599 --> 02:27:46.121]  It emboldens.
[02:27:46.121 --> 02:27:47.422]  So there is a culture
[02:27:49.361 --> 02:27:54.444]  of wrecking things because they get to manage the wrecking and pick the winners and losers.
[02:27:54.444 --> 02:28:07.232]  Like Obama flooding the borders openly to collapse local law enforcement to bring in DHS to get more funding to deal with the crisis and then they'll just legalize almost all these people and do a few show deportations.
[02:28:08.592 --> 02:28:13.096]  And if someone can't understand that, they're going to understand it real soon.
[02:28:13.096 --> 02:28:18.019]  But now Congress is coming out saying, Senator Sessions and others, it's staged and explaining how.
[02:28:18.019 --> 02:28:21.661]  Boehner's coming out now saying it's staged and explaining how it is.
[02:28:21.661 --> 02:28:26.745]  Because we're being forced to because we're going to lose everything.
[02:28:26.745 --> 02:28:32.949]  I've described kleptocratic socialism and crony capitalism as cancer.
[02:28:32.949 --> 02:28:34.290]  It doesn't have a consciousness.
[02:28:35.563 --> 02:28:38.585]  And these globalists think they've got things figured out, but they're like cancer.
[02:28:38.585 --> 02:28:45.390]  They just keep growing, and growing, and growing, and they're going to kill the body politic.
[02:28:45.390 --> 02:28:47.951]  They're not symbiotic.
[02:28:47.951 --> 02:28:53.875]  I'm not up here on some high horse claiming government's gotta be perfect and everything's gonna be great, but I mean, you know.
[02:28:53.875 --> 02:28:55.497]  For God's sakes, they're training the police.
[02:28:55.497 --> 02:28:59.419]  Excuse me, I don't mean to... Excuse me, Lord.
[02:28:59.419 --> 02:29:00.220]  For heaven's sakes.
[02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:05.703]  They're training police all over the country to shoot homeless people in the back.
[02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:08.245]  And when they do it, they don't even get reprimanded.
[02:29:08.245 --> 02:29:10.407]  And I'm not even attacking the police.
[02:29:10.407 --> 02:29:13.109]  The point is, do cops want to live in a world like that?
[02:29:13.109 --> 02:29:16.151]  Where that can happen to their kids and it does?
[02:29:16.151 --> 02:29:18.813]  See, that's the issue.
[02:29:18.813 --> 02:29:22.376]  Is we've got to realize everything we do is connected to somebody else.
[02:29:22.376 --> 02:29:26.559]  And so, really bad people are getting in control.
[02:29:26.559 --> 02:29:29.161]  And as things get more decadent, more and more are.
[02:29:29.161 --> 02:29:30.843]  And so, we're racing to the bottom.
[02:29:32.082 --> 02:29:37.506]  So if your yuppie friends don't want to wake up, that's because subconsciously they feel overpowered.
[02:29:37.506 --> 02:29:39.007]  They feel inadequate.
[02:29:39.007 --> 02:29:41.108]  So they just want to say it's not true.
[02:29:41.108 --> 02:29:42.970]  Well, okay.
[02:29:42.970 --> 02:29:44.751]  Then just tell them to get in the ditch and die.
[02:29:44.751 --> 02:29:45.311]  You move on.
[02:29:45.311 --> 02:29:46.492]  We'll be back.
[02:29:46.492 --> 02:29:47.633]  Stay with us for more calls.

[02:30:03.252 --> 02:30:10.676]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:30:10.676 --> 02:30:21.504]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:30:21.504 --> 02:30:30.730]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:30:31.450 --> 02:30:35.532]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:30:35.532 --> 02:30:39.294]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:30:39.294 --> 02:30:41.335]  Experience the new formula.
[02:30:41.335 --> 02:30:43.917]  Experience the ancient purity.

[02:31:05.471 --> 02:31:06.251]  Security alert.
[02:31:06.251 --> 02:31:07.472]  Security alert.
[02:31:07.472 --> 02:31:09.492]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:31:09.492 --> 02:31:10.352]  Analysis.

[02:31:13.073 --> 02:31:18.074]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.

[02:31:20.635 --> 02:31:23.495]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:31:23.495 --> 02:31:26.736]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:31:26.736 --> 02:31:29.037]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:31:29.037 --> 02:31:29.757]  These people are a
[02:31:30.217 --> 02:31:35.340]  They're never going to stop.
[02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:39.042]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:31:39.042 --> 02:31:46.346]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:31:46.346 --> 02:31:47.627]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:31:47.627 --> 02:31:48.647]  You can feel it.
[02:31:59.059 --> 02:32:04.040]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:07.381]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:32:07.381 --> 02:32:09.502]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:32:09.502 --> 02:32:11.642]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:32:11.642 --> 02:32:13.303]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:32:13.303 --> 02:32:16.623]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:32:16.623 --> 02:32:18.204]  If so, consider this.
[02:32:18.204 --> 02:32:27.126]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:32:27.506 --> 02:32:33.891]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.

[02:33:24.182 --> 02:33:26.803]  We have no right to choose it.
[02:33:26.803 --> 02:33:28.423]  There ain't no way we'll lose it.
[02:33:28.423 --> 02:33:30.964]  This is our life.
[02:33:30.964 --> 02:33:33.785]  This is our song.
[02:33:33.785 --> 02:33:37.826]  We'll fight the powers that be.

[02:33:41.027 --> 02:33:43.788]  Cause you don't know us.
[02:33:43.788 --> 02:33:44.808]  You don't belong.
[02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:52.614]  By the way, folks, this hour brought to you by the great folks at InfidelBodyArmor.com that we've been promoting for years.
[02:33:52.614 --> 02:33:55.917]  Incredible reviews from military, you name it.
[02:33:55.917 --> 02:33:58.939]  Texas-based company owned by a service-disabled U.S.
[02:33:58.939 --> 02:34:00.080]  Air Force veteran.
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:01.541]  Made in the U.S.A.
[02:34:01.541 --> 02:34:09.147]  Used by defense contractors in Afghanistan, police all over the U.S.A., and by civilians who want to be prepared for when the you-know-what hits the fan.
[02:34:09.147 --> 02:34:10.127]  Armor is still legal.
[02:34:10.928 --> 02:34:21.570]  And they've got an amazing line of high-quality products at InfidelBodyArmor.com or 888-608-6605, InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:34:21.570 --> 02:34:25.651]  Also, this hour is brought to you by the great folks at MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:34:25.651 --> 02:34:27.112]  You need storable foods nowadays.
[02:34:27.112 --> 02:34:29.172]  They're high-quality, non-GMO.
[02:34:29.172 --> 02:34:30.992]  They have special diet foods, you name it.
[02:34:30.992 --> 02:34:37.634]  A whole bunch of other preparedness items at MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[02:34:38.487 --> 02:34:45.153]  So MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex to find the info or subsection or 866-229-0927.
[02:34:45.153 --> 02:34:51.359]  It really is a no brainer to have high quality storable foods, so check them out today.
[02:34:51.359 --> 02:34:53.300]  That's where I get my storable foods.
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:55.602]  Heads above the competition, MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:34:57.335 --> 02:35:00.716]  Now, by the way, I just plugged their once a week plug.
[02:35:00.716 --> 02:35:01.397]  They're a sponsor.
[02:35:01.397 --> 02:35:06.038]  They're also a sponsor of InfoWars.com and FidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:35:06.038 --> 02:35:10.960]  But I didn't get them on today because they're a sponsor.
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:17.823]  They're coming on for like five, ten minutes, the founder and owner of it, because of the fact that
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:27.563]  We've been contacted before when I've written a news article, I think it was Kurt Nemo, that had the name Taser in the headline about a Taser reportedly killing somebody.
[02:35:27.563 --> 02:35:36.226]  The coroner had said, and Taser International sent a thing from Arizona saying, we're going to sue you if you ever say the word Taser.
[02:35:36.226 --> 02:35:40.888]  Not that you said something wrong about us, you can't use our name in an article.
[02:35:40.888 --> 02:35:44.010]  I called the lawyer up on the number and I said, how many of these did you send out a week?
[02:35:44.010 --> 02:35:44.730]  He goes, about a hundred.
[02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:48.239]  And I said, you're violating my First Amendment.
[02:35:48.239 --> 02:35:52.225]  You know full well I have a right to say taser in the headline of an article.
[02:35:52.225 --> 02:35:54.248]  And he said, Mr. Jones, I know who you are.
[02:35:54.248 --> 02:35:56.651]  Just forget the call.
[02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:57.933]  And just don't worry about it.
[02:35:57.933 --> 02:35:58.974]  We know you have a right to do that.
[02:35:58.974 --> 02:35:59.896]  We just sent a lot of these out.
[02:36:01.645 --> 02:36:09.067]  Another time I got a call that you've stolen Final Cut Pro and Adobe and we're going to sue you if you don't pass all this money.
[02:36:09.067 --> 02:36:11.388]  So I called the lawyer up myself because I'm not going to pay my lawyer to do it.
[02:36:11.388 --> 02:36:12.248]  I already know what my lawyer knows.
[02:36:12.248 --> 02:36:13.749]  I've got a great lawyer.
[02:36:13.749 --> 02:36:18.570]  I'm just giving you an example of what goes on in this country so you know it's a fraud.
[02:36:18.570 --> 02:36:28.493]  And I called up their lawyer of this company that does work for Apple and I said, I want to see the proof that we downloaded that illegally because we have it all purchased.
[02:36:29.887 --> 02:36:35.011]  And you're probably violating the law, too, if you've got spyware that claims we stole it.
[02:36:35.011 --> 02:36:39.814]  So that's a whole other issue of you scanning our machines.
[02:36:39.814 --> 02:36:41.095]  I want to see your proof."
[02:36:41.095 --> 02:36:44.137]  And he said, no, no, no, we're going to take you off the list.
[02:36:44.137 --> 02:36:47.039]  We send thousands of these out every few months.
[02:36:47.039 --> 02:36:48.840]  You know, just be careful what your people are doing.
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:51.662]  I said, we have systems on it that scan for that.
[02:36:51.662 --> 02:36:58.167]  People are fired that download any proprietary music or software, stuff like that.
[02:36:59.602 --> 02:37:01.083]  This is a shakedown.
[02:37:01.083 --> 02:37:17.508]  They have another deal where you'll show a shot of a news article or even have it embedded in a message board, where it's embedded link, where it's embeddable in a tweet, put out by major newspapers, and then they threaten to sue you or sue you.
[02:37:17.508 --> 02:37:21.309]  And then you just go to court and go, it's an embedded tweet, they made it embeddable.
[02:37:21.309 --> 02:37:25.111]  And then the court goes, yeah, you gotta pay his lawyer's fee.
[02:37:25.111 --> 02:37:26.131]  Still got a jack with it.
[02:37:27.196 --> 02:37:32.459]  But see, the general public doesn't deal with this, they don't run a media company.
[02:37:32.459 --> 02:37:35.661]  They don't know the shakedowns.
[02:37:35.661 --> 02:37:38.543]  That's what they are, shakedowns.
[02:37:38.543 --> 02:37:46.929]  The average person, that's who they send them to, has a little website or whatever, it's some lady that has a dog rescue we've had on about stuff, you know, the newspaper coming after, or it's...
[02:37:48.146 --> 02:37:50.628]  A disabled veterans group we had on this happened too.
[02:37:50.628 --> 02:37:57.815]  I mean, this is going on and you need to know folks, just because they send you a letter threatening to sue you or whatever, you need to call them up and get in their face about it.
[02:37:57.815 --> 02:37:58.355]  That's my view.
[02:37:58.355 --> 02:37:59.776]  I'm not giving legal advice.
[02:37:59.776 --> 02:38:05.902]  Most lawyers don't know what they're doing or will milk you and make you spend $50,000 fighting something that doesn't exist.
[02:38:05.902 --> 02:38:07.183]  That's why you got to get real lawyers.
[02:38:08.933 --> 02:38:12.594]  There's one guy exposed, his name's Michelin, I forget his first name, we've had him on the show.
[02:38:12.594 --> 02:38:14.295]  We need to get him back on about this.
[02:38:14.295 --> 02:38:18.376]  He's a real lawyer who just goes, I'm not even going to charge you, people we've sent to him.
[02:38:18.376 --> 02:38:19.737]  I'm so sick of this.
[02:38:19.737 --> 02:38:24.839]  I'm a copyright lawyer and I sue real people that have really violated copyright and they're making us all look bad.
[02:38:24.839 --> 02:38:27.940]  I mean, that's the kind of good lawyer who does honorable stuff.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:31.561]  Makes money, goes after people that are really violating copyright.
[02:38:31.561 --> 02:38:33.742]  Copyright's copying everybody's music and then selling it.
[02:38:35.137 --> 02:38:38.258]  Or copyright's taking somebody's program and then bootlegging it.
[02:38:38.258 --> 02:38:42.060]  It's not just, send us money or we're gonna sue you.
[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:47.162]  Now, I like Under Armour, and that's why we've got Infidel Body Armor coming on dot com.
[02:38:47.162 --> 02:38:58.406]  But it shows how copyright under CISPA and SOPA and these new UN treaties and this new international Asia-Pacific Union treaty that leaked, that Obama's trying to get ratified without the public seeing.
[02:38:58.406 --> 02:39:01.327]  There's 33 parts, only one part's been, two parts been released.
[02:39:02.585 --> 02:39:04.286]  I'm just giving you background here.
[02:39:04.286 --> 02:39:07.688]  That just says you violate copyright three times on the internet.
[02:39:07.688 --> 02:39:12.171]  Companies claim you lose your web ID and can never get on the internet again.
[02:39:12.171 --> 02:39:17.854]  And you're going to retina scan or thumb print to be able to get on the internet.
[02:39:17.854 --> 02:39:20.516]  That's the end of freedom of speech as we know it.
[02:39:20.516 --> 02:39:22.878]  It's beyond the Chinese style net censorship.
[02:39:22.878 --> 02:39:25.319]  And that's what the Democrats are promoting right now.
[02:39:25.319 --> 02:39:27.460]  Again, I'm not siding with the Republicans.
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:29.982]  The Democrats are quarterbacking everything right now.
[02:39:31.488 --> 02:39:35.410]  Well, I'm going to let him give you the details, and hopefully it's a mistake by a lawyer, but I don't think it is.
[02:39:35.410 --> 02:39:54.060]  I remember seeing a 60 Minutes piece about the McDonald Lords, the McDonald's Lords in Scotland, who don't get lordly money for hundreds of years, so they got a castle, they rented out people to stay in, and for hundreds of years it's got a pub and a restaurant that people, tourists and others, go to eat at and drink at.
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:58.302]  Now, it predates McDonald's being founded in the 50s by over a couple hundred years.
[02:39:59.093 --> 02:40:07.958]  McDonald's, remember, just kept suing the McDonald's family because they had a restaurant at McDonald's Castle.
[02:40:07.958 --> 02:40:10.319]  The restaurant wasn't even called McDonald's.
[02:40:10.319 --> 02:40:13.001]  It was at McDonald's Castle.
[02:40:13.001 --> 02:40:16.642]  Now, they did that, really, because the family probably could have come after McDonald's.
[02:40:16.642 --> 02:40:20.585]  But they've been operating for 50-something years, so it didn't matter when McDonald's did that.
[02:40:20.585 --> 02:40:22.926]  So, obviously, the two don't compete with each other.
[02:40:24.522 --> 02:40:29.626]  And I get these letters all the time, you know, saying, uh, we own the word free speech.
[02:40:29.626 --> 02:40:32.369]  You can't have it in your corporation's name or blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:32.369 --> 02:40:34.250]  I just go, good, sue me.
[02:40:34.250 --> 02:40:35.732]  By the way, go check these precedents.
[02:40:35.732 --> 02:40:39.715]  And I don't say this on air, but I send them over law cases we've won and judgments.
[02:40:39.715 --> 02:40:44.779]  And I go, I don't really want to get a judgment on you and get attorney's fees and time.
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:50.521]  Maybe you've got in-house lawyers, so they don't care, but move on to weaker targets.
[02:40:50.521 --> 02:40:56.623]  I'm sure you've got some old ladies to shake down you can scare the hell out of and, you know, get a bunch of money out of.
[02:40:56.623 --> 02:40:59.364]  By the way, you're gonna go to hell!
[02:40:59.364 --> 02:41:00.584]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:02.605]  Just like the IRS and all the rest of these parasites.
[02:41:02.605 --> 02:41:03.985]  I mean, I talk to these lawyers like this.
[02:41:04.704 --> 02:41:10.887]  That doesn't happen that often now, but every few weeks I got to get on the phone, call a lawyer up, and you know, just go, man, you sleep good at night?
[02:41:10.887 --> 02:41:11.907]  You and your company?
[02:41:11.907 --> 02:41:17.630]  Now, I don't want to demonize Under Armour yet, but we've got the fellow on.
[02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:20.171]  He is a sponsor, but he isn't on about that right now.
[02:41:20.171 --> 02:41:24.113]  Just to briefly talk about this, then I want to go back to your calls, Mike, Fox, Jordy, and Peter.
[02:41:24.113 --> 02:41:26.274]  We're going to get to you here when our guest leaves us.
[02:41:27.378 --> 02:41:29.359]  Chad Cooper is CEO of Infidel Body Armor.
[02:41:29.359 --> 02:41:30.760]  Become a successful American company.
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:31.661]  Veteran police officer.
[02:41:31.661 --> 02:41:32.121]  Veteran U.S.
[02:41:32.121 --> 02:41:33.542]  Air Force Staff Sergeant.
[02:41:33.542 --> 02:41:35.043]  Worked five years in the NSA.
[02:41:35.043 --> 02:41:36.444]  We ought to get him to talk about that.
[02:41:36.444 --> 02:41:42.348]  Worked under another four as a defense contractor with Tom in the Middle East and Far East.
[02:41:42.348 --> 02:41:43.729]  Started Infidel Body Armor in 2012.
[02:41:43.729 --> 02:41:45.730]  It's already become very successful.
[02:41:45.730 --> 02:41:47.511]  It's being sponsored here first.
[02:41:47.511 --> 02:41:54.756]  To fill the need to supply civilian patriots and preppers with the armor and other tactical products they need to resist tyranny and keep their families safe.
[02:41:54.756 --> 02:41:55.737]  Well, he's gotten a letter.
[02:41:56.658 --> 02:42:01.219]  Saying you can't have the word armor, underarmors, underwear and clothes.
[02:42:01.219 --> 02:42:03.499]  I like it as exercise clothes and shoes.
[02:42:03.499 --> 02:42:07.240]  I'm gonna tell you though, they come after him with the First Amendment, I'll quit wearing it.
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:08.940]  Okay, I mean it's real simple.
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:12.861]  Very popular brand, you know, Protect This House is their slogan.
[02:42:12.861 --> 02:42:17.162]  Armor, there are hundreds of body armor companies, hundreds, that have the word armor in their name.
[02:42:17.162 --> 02:42:19.742]  Armors go back thousands of years.
[02:42:19.742 --> 02:42:21.922]  Body armor.
[02:42:21.922 --> 02:42:24.883]  I mean, I guarantee you, without even calling my lawyer, they have not
[02:42:25.697 --> 02:42:27.401]  It's called a slap suit, folks.
[02:42:27.401 --> 02:42:35.640]  If they sue Infidel Body Armor, if Under Armour does that, with their underwear and the rest of it,
[02:42:36.724 --> 02:42:38.665]  There's no free speech in this country.
[02:42:38.665 --> 02:42:45.708]  And they're trying to say you can't even name your business Mickey's Burgers because it's the first word in Mickey Mouse.
[02:42:45.708 --> 02:42:47.168]  But that's been defeated as well.
[02:42:47.168 --> 02:42:51.570]  These lawyers and these companies are destroying free speech because the public's ignorant of it.
[02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:54.731]  That's why we're here to talk about this and to discuss it.
[02:42:54.731 --> 02:42:57.892]  I mean, Taser tries to tell me I can't say the word Taser.
[02:42:57.892 --> 02:42:58.933]  They own that word.
[02:42:58.933 --> 02:42:59.833]  No, you don't.
[02:42:59.833 --> 02:43:01.614]  I can't operate a business with that name.
[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:05.081]  Okay?
[02:43:05.081 --> 02:43:06.621]  And it needs to be reversed.
[02:43:06.621 --> 02:43:11.744]  So just briefly, tell us specifically what's happening to you over there.
[02:43:11.744 --> 02:43:13.825]  I mean, tell us what the letter says.
[02:43:13.825 --> 02:43:15.365]  You wanted to break this here.
[02:43:15.365 --> 02:43:25.810]  I think it's interesting just in the larger gestalt of how they'll use copyright now on YouTube if we show a newspaper with a photo in it.
[02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:28.512]  And then I have to threaten lawsuits or file lawsuits.
[02:43:28.512 --> 02:43:30.693]  I mean, that's the type of stuff I've had to do behind the scenes.
[02:43:31.917 --> 02:43:37.023]  So this is an ongoing attack on free speech, but also on your right to commerce.
[02:43:37.023 --> 02:43:44.852]  I mean, if body armor isn't body armor, but underwear can take the name of the hundreds of companies that call it armor, we don't have a language left, sir.
[02:43:45.709 --> 02:43:47.230]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:52.893]  Armor, you know, by its truest definition, goes back hundreds and probably thousands of years, like you mentioned.
[02:43:52.893 --> 02:43:58.436]  And in its truest sense, it's designed to protect against sharp-edged weapons and projectiles.
[02:43:58.436 --> 02:44:00.457]  And that's, by definition, what we do.
[02:44:00.457 --> 02:44:03.999]  What they do, you know, no offense to their product.
[02:44:03.999 --> 02:44:10.643]  I personally, I own a couple of Under Armour products, and they're great for working out, but it's not really armor.
[02:44:10.643 --> 02:44:14.305]  But their lawyers are way out of control and need to have their pants pulled down and spanked.
[02:44:15.868 --> 02:44:26.712]  Well, about a month and a half ago I was contacted by Under Armour's lawyers and they sent a letter challenging our copyright, I mean, excuse me, our trademark.
[02:44:26.712 --> 02:44:29.674]  And our trademark is Infidel Body Armour.
[02:44:29.674 --> 02:44:32.675]  Not Under Armour, totally separate, totally different products.
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:34.140]  Totally different spelling.
[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:35.681]  They spell theirs with the British spelling.
[02:44:35.681 --> 02:44:37.382]  Ours is the American spelling.
[02:44:37.382 --> 02:44:42.925]  But it's body armor, not sports equipment and athletic shorts and things like that.
[02:44:42.925 --> 02:44:52.669]  But basically, they've got this army of lawyers who have to justify their existence, it seems like, and come up with ways to protect their company and stay in business.
[02:44:52.669 --> 02:44:55.190]  And what they did was they sent me five demands.
[02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:56.611]  They basically want me to
[02:44:57.351 --> 02:45:04.192]  Stop using my mark anywhere other than on the t-shirt that I'm wearing right now.
[02:45:04.192 --> 02:45:10.474]  They're afraid that people are going to be confused between infidel body armor and under armor.
[02:45:10.474 --> 02:45:14.615]  Did you hear about apartment complexes in Houston and telling people no American flags?
[02:45:14.615 --> 02:45:15.975]  It may upset Muslims.
[02:45:15.975 --> 02:45:17.715]  This sounds politically correct to me.
[02:45:17.715 --> 02:45:21.476]  I mean, this is a real joke.
[02:45:21.476 --> 02:45:24.957]  I mean, you know, they're trying to protect their made-up trademark.
[02:45:24.957 --> 02:45:26.497]  I'm trying to protect the First Amendment here.
[02:45:28.763 --> 02:45:29.904]  Well, exactly.
[02:45:29.904 --> 02:45:31.085]  That's what it is.
[02:45:31.085 --> 02:45:36.110]  It comes down to, is there an infringement on their mark?
[02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:37.371]  And they need to protect their mark.
[02:45:37.371 --> 02:45:38.452]  I understand that.
[02:45:38.452 --> 02:45:41.715]  There's a reason for them doing this.
[02:45:41.715 --> 02:45:44.417]  But on the other hand, this is really frivolous.
[02:45:46.878 --> 02:45:52.882]  I really don't know what to do other than... Have you gotten a trademark lawyer?
[02:45:52.882 --> 02:45:57.646]  I'm not going to give you advice, but I know what they would tell me.
[02:45:57.646 --> 02:45:58.547]  This is a different business.
[02:45:58.547 --> 02:46:00.369]  This is a different area.
[02:46:00.369 --> 02:46:02.851]  You're attempting by threats.
[02:46:03.291 --> 02:46:24.000]  to engage in torturous interference of our business operations uh... and if you do engage uh... in uh... you know baritrary uh... against this operation you'll be held liable uh... you know the courts are apt to rule according to these fourteen case laws in similar areas that you're going to be held liable for attorney's fees and damage to our name and then they'll move on to other targets
[02:46:24.656 --> 02:46:25.657]  Yeah, and that's what we've done.
[02:46:25.657 --> 02:46:26.657]  We replied.
[02:46:26.657 --> 02:46:31.420]  I did have to hire a trademark attorney, and we did the latter.
[02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:39.565]  But really, I think what would happen would be really good is if people called and said, hey, Under Armour, leave Infidel alone.
[02:46:39.565 --> 02:46:48.090]  And if enough people did something like that and called to complain, what would happen is they would call their attorneys off.
[02:46:48.090 --> 02:46:52.032]  And I think it would not only help me out, but it would help other
[02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:54.431]  Yeah, and again, this may be a mistake by then.
[02:46:54.431 --> 02:46:55.812]  I'm not saying they're involved in bearetry.
[02:46:55.812 --> 02:46:57.273]  I'm not saying they're bad people.
[02:46:57.273 --> 02:47:02.777]  I personally, this is one of my hot buttons now, not with Under Armour, but with these companies that have done this to me.
[02:47:14.855 --> 02:47:19.938]  And you know, you call the lawyer up and you go, man, you want me to have a lawyer spend money to respond to you?
[02:47:19.938 --> 02:47:33.587]  That's almost a form of theft, that you know that this is a pure threat, and even if you sue me, you're hoping I'm ignorant, and you're literally engaged in a form of highway piracy, and I'm just tired of it.
[02:47:33.587 --> 02:47:36.949]  And again, if somebody was putting out clothing that had
[02:47:38.561 --> 02:47:42.803]  I don't even know if that, if it wasn't the exact same name.
[02:47:42.803 --> 02:47:46.784]  I just think this copyright thing has gone way too far.
[02:47:46.784 --> 02:47:53.026]  Yeah, they went after a beverage company recently, I think it was, I can't remember the exact name of it, but it had the word armor in it.
[02:47:53.026 --> 02:47:55.687]  And they went after them, and I believe they won.
[02:47:55.687 --> 02:47:56.988]  I don't know how they did that, but...
[02:47:59.167 --> 02:48:09.170]  You know, the courts perpetuate this and we've become a very litigious society where people feel entitled to sue on every little turn.
[02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:12.991]  Left, you know, anywhere they go, they think they can sue and they're entitled to sue.
[02:48:12.991 --> 02:48:16.472]  And the attorneys are making money on this left hand over fist, you know, both sides.
[02:48:17.152 --> 02:48:23.135]  Well, my big issue again is the First Amendment, and it turns out they promote Duck Dynasty clothing and stuff, because they know it's popular to make money.
[02:48:23.135 --> 02:48:27.816]  And I know they've marketed Libertarians, Sportsmen, Patriots.
[02:48:27.816 --> 02:48:32.258]  I think this is a major PR issue for them, and it's important, just as usual, to spank them.
[02:48:32.258 --> 02:48:37.360]  InfidelBodyArmor.com, and we appreciate your sponsorship and your fine products.
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:40.241]  Thank you so much for your time, Chad Cooper.
[02:48:40.241 --> 02:48:40.842]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:40.842 --> 02:48:41.482]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:41.482 --> 02:48:43.883]  You bet, and we'll get an update and see what unfolds from this.
[02:48:44.665 --> 02:48:45.385]  Alright, take care.
[02:49:14.278 --> 02:49:18.380]  And the ignorant public doesn't know this stuff and is starting to believe it, which is what the lawyers want.
[02:49:18.380 --> 02:49:22.302]  Mike in Alabama, thanks for holding air on the air.
[02:49:22.302 --> 02:49:24.603]  Hey Alex, Semper Fi, bud.
[02:49:24.603 --> 02:49:28.065]  I wanted to call you about 20 years ago.
[02:49:28.065 --> 02:49:36.549]  I've got a friend, his dad spent 27 years in the Special Forces and he told us back then, they'd been told in a briefing,
[02:49:37.347 --> 02:49:37.747]  When was this?
[02:49:37.747 --> 02:49:37.908]  Yeah.
[02:49:54.250 --> 02:49:59.334]  And I didn't think much about it then, you know, but seeing what's going on now, it recalled that.
[02:49:59.334 --> 02:50:01.055]  And I said, oh man, he was right.
[02:50:01.055 --> 02:50:06.759]  You know, and these people knew about that then because they had told them in briefings about it.
[02:50:06.759 --> 02:50:14.005]  And about the same time I was being trained, changed branches, I was being trained as a medic.
[02:50:14.005 --> 02:50:19.829]  And they told us in our briefings that we were going to see diseases that had been or were starting to see already.
[02:50:20.501 --> 02:50:30.025]  Diseases that have been eradicated for 40 or 50 years in this country were coming back into the country now because the illegals don't go through a medical screening or anything.
[02:50:30.025 --> 02:50:30.985]  Wow, this is intriguing.
[02:50:30.985 --> 02:50:31.285]  Stay there.
[02:50:31.285 --> 02:50:32.846]  I'm going to come back to you, Mike.
[02:50:32.846 --> 02:50:33.206]  Please.
[02:50:33.206 --> 02:50:34.486]  And then Fox.
[02:50:34.486 --> 02:50:35.186]  Bring it to you next.
[02:50:35.186 --> 02:50:36.907]  Then Peter and Kevin and Jordy.

[02:50:37.667 --> 02:50:38.188]  I'll get to everybody.
[02:50:40.373 --> 02:50:46.555]  Oh yeah, they had a Rex 84 plan to open the borders and bring in martial law in the 80s, but Reagan didn't go along with it.
[02:50:46.555 --> 02:50:47.755]  And neither did Congress.
[02:50:47.755 --> 02:50:50.416]  Some of his own people inside doing it.
[02:50:50.416 --> 02:50:54.018]  And then, and there's groups with even in administrations.
[02:50:54.018 --> 02:50:55.598]  And then now they're doing it, folks.
[02:50:55.598 --> 02:50:58.299]  This is the North American Union on record happening.

[02:52:16.647 --> 02:52:18.688]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:52:18.688 --> 02:52:21.288]  Crime Directive didn't credit Alex Jones.
[02:52:21.288 --> 02:52:24.129]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:52:24.129 --> 02:52:27.370]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:29.671]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:52:29.671 --> 02:52:31.231]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:52:31.231 --> 02:52:33.512]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:52:34.052 --> 02:52:35.994]  They're never going to stop.
[02:52:35.994 --> 02:52:39.676]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:52:39.676 --> 02:52:46.962]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:52:46.962 --> 02:52:51.245]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:01.001]  You know about RVs.
[02:53:01.001 --> 02:53:02.462]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:53:02.462 --> 02:53:05.223]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:53:05.223 --> 02:53:07.985]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:54:07.435 --> 02:54:14.658]  The New Colossus, Emma Lazarus, 1883, speaking of the Statue of Liberty.
[02:54:30.865 --> 02:54:32.945]  And people think that's what America's Creed is.
[02:54:32.945 --> 02:54:35.966]  That was just a quote by someone.
[02:54:35.966 --> 02:54:41.207]  But two-thirds of the immigrants got turned back if they had criminal records or diseases.
[02:54:41.207 --> 02:54:44.628]  Now it's, if you're criminals, if you have diseases, please come.
[02:54:44.628 --> 02:54:49.689]  I was talking to Mike in Alabama, who said when he was in the military they got briefings on this.
[02:54:49.689 --> 02:54:51.689]  Well, I know that's for a fact, actually.
[02:54:51.689 --> 02:54:55.130]  Interesting to get it from him back in the early 90s.
[02:54:55.130 --> 02:54:59.171]  But then you were talking about what they said when you became a medic.
[02:54:59.171 --> 02:55:00.511]  Any other points on that subject?
[02:55:02.017 --> 02:55:08.821]  Yeah, well just like I said, we'd see diseases that have been eradicated 40 and 50 years ago in the U.S.
[02:55:08.821 --> 02:55:12.523]  and they would be coming back and we're seeing that too.
[02:55:12.523 --> 02:55:26.171]  And then one thing that's on a little different subject, I read a book about this time, it was by a retired NASA guy, and he was saying something that in 69 Alex, that in the final Soviet border war,
[02:55:27.108 --> 02:55:41.917]  That the Russians had used a battlefield tactical nuke against the Chinese to break off the conflict because they were more concerned about NATO in the West than they were trying to, you know, slug it out with China man-to-man.
[02:55:41.917 --> 02:55:44.319]  And that's the only time I've ever read it.
[02:55:44.319 --> 02:55:47.361]  And I don't know if any of your other listeners have ever read that same book.
[02:55:47.361 --> 02:55:48.702]  I can't find it.
[02:55:48.702 --> 02:55:50.163]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with that.
[02:55:50.163 --> 02:55:54.465]  I know that it's been declassified that the Chinese and the Russians came to the U.S.
[02:55:54.465 --> 02:55:54.846]  and wanted
[02:55:55.946 --> 02:55:56.567]  The U.S.
[02:55:56.567 --> 02:55:58.949]  to nuke the other and take out the other.
[02:55:58.949 --> 02:56:00.671]  So it is a three-way power block.
[02:56:00.671 --> 02:56:02.653]  That's undoubtedly going on.
[02:56:02.653 --> 02:56:04.014]  None of these people trust each other.
[02:56:04.014 --> 02:56:04.515]  It's just...
[02:56:05.871 --> 02:56:06.611]  It's a mess.
[02:56:06.611 --> 02:56:08.171]  Let's talk to Fox.
[02:56:08.171 --> 02:56:08.852]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:08.852 --> 02:56:09.312]  Good points.
[02:56:09.312 --> 02:56:10.552]  Have a great weekend.
[02:56:10.552 --> 02:56:13.893]  By the way, I'll be back this Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m., in studio.
[02:56:13.893 --> 02:56:16.213]  Central, please join us for the Sunday edition.
[02:56:16.213 --> 02:56:20.674]  Fox, in California, listening on KSCO, 1080 AM.
[02:56:20.674 --> 02:56:24.295]  I should mention where these folks call in from, so be sure and mention it when you call in.
[02:56:24.295 --> 02:56:26.575]  You're on the CPS, Child Protective Services.
[02:56:26.575 --> 02:56:28.095]  Go ahead.
[02:56:28.095 --> 02:56:31.636]  Alex, thank you so much for being there.
[02:56:31.636 --> 02:56:35.077]  I pray for you, your family, and your crew daily.
[02:56:35.077 --> 02:56:35.397]  Thank you.
[02:56:36.118 --> 02:56:47.449]  I encourage you to get a hold of Julian Jerry Dominguez, who wrote the book, A Culture of Fear, an inside look at Los Angeles County's Department of Children and Family Services.
[02:56:47.449 --> 02:56:49.251]  It is a whistleblower.
[02:56:49.251 --> 02:56:51.814]  It tells how insidious they work.
[02:56:51.814 --> 02:56:52.835]  Yeah, let's get him on.
[02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:53.876]  Guys, get that guest on.
[02:56:53.876 --> 02:56:54.617]  I've heard of that book.
[02:56:55.597 --> 02:56:59.758]  And again, you've got private social workers, individual social workers in some areas that aren't bad people.
[02:56:59.758 --> 02:57:05.259]  But in certain big cities and other areas, it's literally child molesters, criminals.
[02:57:05.259 --> 02:57:08.240]  The worst place for a kid to be is in government custody, statistically.
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:11.960]  Santa Cruz stole my granddaughter May 30th.
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:15.621]  They called it adoption, but it was stealing.
[02:57:15.621 --> 02:57:19.122]  They ran it through, didn't let me or my attorney know about it.
[02:57:19.736 --> 02:57:23.800]  We were filing JB 180s, 183 and 184.
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:32.087]  They took the complaints, they took the paperwork, and with a smirk, they knew that my granddaughter had already been stolen.
[02:57:32.087 --> 02:57:35.190]  Yeah, that's how it works, because they can get millions for them in the aggregate.
[02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:37.952]  And again, grandparents should get the kids, but no!
[02:57:37.952 --> 02:57:40.815]  No, so they're going to change the granddaughter's name and everything.
[02:57:41.929 --> 02:57:43.910]  I encourage you to get a hold of Karen.
[02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:46.352]  That's Karen with a C-A-R-I-N.
[02:57:46.352 --> 02:57:48.013]  Johnson of Walnut Creek.
[02:57:48.013 --> 02:57:54.638]  She's one of five attorneys who actually fight for children and families in dependency court.
[02:57:54.638 --> 02:57:57.860]  And Robert R. Powell of San Jose, California.
[02:57:58.493 --> 02:58:05.775]  He sues the agency for children who have been abused and who have died in custody.
[02:58:05.775 --> 02:58:06.195]  Oh, I know.
[02:58:06.195 --> 02:58:12.677]  You're seven times more likely, even Time Magazine had to admit, to be abused or killed in CPS custody.
[02:58:12.677 --> 02:58:15.017]  It is the most dangerous place.
[02:58:15.017 --> 02:58:25.500]  I used to cover CPS locally, and they would file a thing with a different kid's name, saying the kid was three years old, the parents had abused them, it wasn't even their kid.
[02:58:26.559 --> 02:58:30.822]  In front of a judge, and the judge would sign off, and then it would be a newborn baby.
[02:58:30.822 --> 02:58:36.266]  I mean, it's just total fraud, total evil, totally out of control.
[02:58:36.266 --> 02:58:39.128]  We'll be right back with Jordi and others.
[02:58:39.128 --> 02:58:39.588]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.205 --> 02:58:54.248]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:58:54.248 --> 02:58:58.631]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:58:58.631 --> 02:59:02.274]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:59:02.274 --> 02:59:05.296]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:59:05.296 --> 02:59:12.901]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:59:12.901 --> 02:59:16.524]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:59:16.804 --> 02:59:21.207]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:59:21.207 --> 02:59:27.192]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:59:27.192 --> 02:59:31.114]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:59:31.114 --> 02:59:33.876]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:59:33.876 --> 02:59:35.377]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:59:35.377 --> 02:59:36.738]  It's time to take action.
[02:59:36.738 --> 02:59:38.560]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:59:51.031 --> 02:59:52.572]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:52.572 --> 02:59:54.634]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.634 --> 02:59:57.838]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.235 --> 03:00:07.556]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.556 --> 03:00:09.316]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:09.316 --> 03:00:11.077]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.077 --> 03:00:12.677]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.677 --> 03:00:14.218]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.218 --> 03:00:18.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:22.481]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.481 --> 03:00:30.044]  I'm gonna jam some final phone calls in here before I punch out for a day and a half for Sunday's live transmission.
[03:00:31.482 --> 03:00:40.949]  Really crazy video and story we didn't get to, but Colorado sheriffs search every vehicle at a checkpoint following a concert shooting.
[03:00:40.949 --> 03:00:43.871]  All new Android and Windows phones will have kill switch.
[03:00:43.871 --> 03:00:45.292]  Unbelievable.
[03:00:45.292 --> 03:00:48.955]  Democrats and Republicans agree Iraq needs to be re-invaded.
[03:00:48.955 --> 03:00:50.596]  Really bad news.
[03:00:50.596 --> 03:00:56.341]  Obama considers airstrikes in Syria on terrorists they fund.
[03:00:56.341 --> 03:00:57.201]  And we have another article.
[03:00:57.201 --> 03:00:59.263]  We know the whereabouts of the lost IRS emails.
[03:00:59.263 --> 03:01:00.143]  Very important story.
[03:01:01.226 --> 03:01:06.250]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:01:06.250 --> 03:01:07.791]  Let's go to Jordy in New York.
[03:01:07.791 --> 03:01:10.093]  Jordy, you're on the air.
[03:01:10.093 --> 03:01:16.217]  Hey Alex, a long time listener and I just want to talk about the veterans.
[03:01:16.217 --> 03:01:17.478]  Yes sir.
[03:01:17.478 --> 03:01:25.424]  I have family members who served in the military and it really makes me sick when I see the commercials and propaganda on TV.
[03:01:25.424 --> 03:01:27.586]  Just quite frankly trying to brainwash the public.
[03:01:28.553 --> 03:01:42.001]  I really have to turn the channel or just turn it off altogether because it's nothing but mind control and say, well, you know, do what we say and everything's going to be fine, when really we're, they're trying to destroy us and take all of our liberties.
[03:01:42.001 --> 03:01:53.708]  And, uh, I think, you know, the people in Congress should, you know, owe the American people a duty to tell the truth and not be cowardice and bullied by these banker criminals.
[03:01:56.053 --> 03:01:56.854]  I agree with you.
[03:01:56.854 --> 03:02:01.300]  I mean, they're cutting off any type of health care for the veterans.
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:03.783]  And the illegal aliens get instant health care and everything else.
[03:02:03.783 --> 03:02:05.585]  And again, it's not about the illegal aliens.
[03:02:05.585 --> 03:02:07.607]  It's not even about hating these poor people.
[03:02:07.607 --> 03:02:09.810]  Victims of globalism and corruption.
[03:02:09.810 --> 03:02:12.834]  It's that it's being used like a shrimp mining weapon.
[03:02:14.509 --> 03:02:17.693]  Water's a good thing, as I said, but high power will cut you in half.
[03:02:17.693 --> 03:02:20.716]  They're just spraying them at us and they don't know.
[03:02:20.716 --> 03:02:22.558]  They just know they're getting a handout from the government.
[03:02:22.558 --> 03:02:23.619]  They'll vote as they're told.
[03:02:23.619 --> 03:02:25.161]  It's a nightmare situation.
[03:02:25.161 --> 03:02:26.402]  Good to hear from you, Jordy.
[03:02:26.402 --> 03:02:28.284]  Peter in North Carolina, thanks for calling in.
[03:02:28.284 --> 03:02:30.267]  You're on the air.
[03:02:30.267 --> 03:02:32.409]  Alex, pleasure to speak with you, man.
[03:02:32.409 --> 03:02:33.110]  Good to talk to you.
[03:02:34.989 --> 03:02:35.929]  And I won't be long.
[03:02:35.929 --> 03:02:37.751]  I want to get you on your weekend.
[03:02:37.751 --> 03:02:40.573]  But I guess you had Stanley Monteith on the other day.
[03:02:40.573 --> 03:02:47.458]  And after I heard your interview with him, it caused me to go to YouTube and watch a couple of his speeches.
[03:02:47.458 --> 03:02:49.419]  I was fascinated by him.
[03:02:49.419 --> 03:02:53.082]  I guess my question is... Yeah, let's get Monteith on for a full hour next week if he can do it.
[03:02:53.997 --> 03:02:56.718]  Yeah, the guy's brilliant and profound.
[03:02:56.718 --> 03:03:09.003]  Anyway, the question to you is, he would go on a lot of the speeches and go back to Plato's Republic and basically say he would only teach the enlightened folks certain things and all his other students something else.
[03:03:09.003 --> 03:03:11.604]  But who is the head of the snake?
[03:03:11.604 --> 03:03:13.504]  He would say it's not the Illuminati.
[03:03:13.504 --> 03:03:14.405]  It's the devil.
[03:03:14.405 --> 03:03:15.845]  It's the devil.
[03:03:15.845 --> 03:03:16.486]  Exactly.
[03:03:16.486 --> 03:03:17.886]  That's, okay.
[03:03:17.886 --> 03:03:19.707]  How simple that is, but profound.
[03:03:19.707 --> 03:03:19.947]  Wow.
[03:03:21.318 --> 03:03:23.020]  But see, the devil set it up then.
[03:03:23.020 --> 03:03:24.200]  I say it's the devil.
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:25.461]  People run out of the churches.
[03:03:25.461 --> 03:03:26.762]  But what did Christ tell you?
[03:03:26.762 --> 03:03:28.944]  The churches of his day were where the worst people were.
[03:03:28.944 --> 03:03:35.089]  I mean, the one time Christ got mad and overturned tables and beat people with a whip was where?
[03:03:35.089 --> 03:03:35.969]  A church.
[03:03:35.969 --> 03:03:36.470]  A synagogue.
[03:03:37.543 --> 03:03:45.948]  Not even the practitioners weren't bad, it was the people up there running it were a den of vipers, he said.
[03:03:45.948 --> 03:03:50.231]  And, I mean, these churches are just horrible, most of them.
[03:03:50.231 --> 03:03:52.493]  I mean, they are unbelievably bad.
[03:03:52.493 --> 03:03:53.874]  I found a few good ones in Austin.
[03:03:55.535 --> 03:03:56.375]  But a great point.
[03:03:56.375 --> 03:03:58.116]  So we're going to have Monteef back on.
[03:03:58.116 --> 03:04:00.137]  He's a real treasure and I want to do a full hour.
[03:04:00.137 --> 03:04:05.080]  You should tell him on Plato's Republic, the nature of reality, maybe with David Knight.
[03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:07.562]  Someday David Knight can do a couple days next week.
[03:04:07.562 --> 03:04:09.143]  Let's talk to Kevin.
[03:04:09.143 --> 03:04:10.444]  You got about 40 seconds.
[03:04:10.444 --> 03:04:11.704]  Sorry the other callers, we're out of time.
[03:04:11.704 --> 03:04:12.205]  Kevin, go ahead.
[03:04:13.243 --> 03:04:14.543]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:04:14.543 --> 03:04:18.685]  I got three personal incidents I just wanted to tell you about that happened.
[03:04:18.685 --> 03:04:20.425]  Make them real quick.
[03:04:20.425 --> 03:04:22.886]  Two times going on vacation with my wife.
[03:04:22.886 --> 03:04:24.767]  Regular looking guy.
[03:04:24.767 --> 03:04:26.527]  No criminal record.
[03:04:26.527 --> 03:04:28.648]  Jeans, sneakers, you know, crew cut.
[03:04:28.648 --> 03:04:29.548]  Standing on lines.
[03:04:29.548 --> 03:04:30.289]  TSA.
[03:04:31.693 --> 03:04:33.455]  Uh, you want to step out, please?
[03:04:33.455 --> 03:04:34.155]  Come with us.
[03:04:34.155 --> 03:04:38.078]  I go into a private room with my wife and my son, who's a little guy.
[03:04:38.078 --> 03:04:39.219]  Take off your sneakers.
[03:04:39.219 --> 03:04:41.681]  I'm sitting on the stool, I take my sneakers off.
[03:04:41.681 --> 03:04:43.783]  They're there babbling away, right?
[03:04:43.783 --> 03:04:46.185]  So, my wife's looking at me like, what gives?
[03:04:46.185 --> 03:04:49.248]  I'm like, I'm looking back at her like, I don't know.
[03:04:49.248 --> 03:04:55.513]  Finally, my wife gets ticked, and my son says, uh, mommy, why are the men making daddy take his sneakers off?
[03:04:55.513 --> 03:04:57.634]  Stay there, I gotta do more overdrive.
[03:04:57.634 --> 03:04:58.975]  Come back, Kevin, don't hang up.
[03:05:01.289 --> 03:05:07.453]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[03:05:07.453 --> 03:05:12.015]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[03:05:12.015 --> 03:05:16.538]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[03:05:16.958 --> 03:05:19.881]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[03:05:19.881 --> 03:05:25.326]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[03:05:25.326 --> 03:05:32.692]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[03:05:32.692 --> 03:05:36.836]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[03:05:36.836 --> 03:05:41.600]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:50.366]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[03:05:50.366 --> 03:05:54.788]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[03:06:54.646 --> 03:06:54.706]  1-800-721-4255.
[03:07:00.498 --> 03:07:02.640]  The human body is extraordinary.
[03:07:02.640 --> 03:07:06.825]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[03:07:06.825 --> 03:07:12.131]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon hardened body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[03:08:03.095 --> 03:08:09.737]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.737 --> 03:08:16.639]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.639 --> 03:08:21.081]  Coming up, it's so powerful, I've got to air Darren McBrain's modern mix.
[03:08:21.081 --> 03:08:24.062]  It's a video mix of the network.
[03:08:25.543 --> 03:08:29.429]  Powerful, if you missed it, the video is on Paul Watson's channel.
[03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:30.771]  Prison Planet Live.
[03:08:30.771 --> 03:08:39.524]  If you're a radio listener and want to be able to see it, it's titled, Are You Dumb or Are You Mad As Hell?
[03:08:40.618 --> 03:08:43.702]  But right now, let's go back to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[03:08:43.702 --> 03:08:49.308]  So, they pull you aside, they got your shoes off, your son asks, what's going on with daddy?
[03:08:49.308 --> 03:08:51.510]  And you say, this is slave training, son.
[03:08:51.510 --> 03:08:55.655]  These people think they're fighting to stop terrorists, but the government runs the terrorists.
[03:08:55.655 --> 03:08:59.439]  This is here to train the general public that we're all prisoners and that the state is God.
[03:08:59.439 --> 03:09:01.902]  But let's go back to what happened to you at that point.
[03:09:02.708 --> 03:09:10.476]  Basically, uh, you know, my wife's ticked too, so she says, she says out loud, Oh, uh, I think they're looking for drugs in daddy's sneakers.
[03:09:10.476 --> 03:09:16.703]  So they get like kind of embarrassed and they go, they look at me, they said, all right, uh, get dressed, go back.
[03:09:16.703 --> 03:09:22.028]  Uh, second time I'm going on vacation, standing in line, you know, waiting to get the tickets.
[03:09:22.028 --> 03:09:23.350]  I get pulled out of the line.
[03:09:23.350 --> 03:09:24.191]  I get brought up front.
[03:09:25.031 --> 03:09:27.612]  The guy taking the tickets says, uh, what are you doing?
[03:09:27.612 --> 03:09:29.193]  I'm like, I'm going on vacation.
[03:09:29.193 --> 03:09:32.474]  There's two guys, now he really spoke broken English, right?
[03:09:32.474 --> 03:09:34.555]  There's two suits sitting in back of him.
[03:09:34.555 --> 03:09:37.236]  I look at them and I say, I'm an American.
[03:09:37.236 --> 03:09:40.838]  This guy's going to question me and he can't even speak English.
[03:09:40.838 --> 03:09:42.518]  I was like, it's ridiculous.
[03:09:42.518 --> 03:09:43.639]  All of a sudden, same thing.
[03:09:43.639 --> 03:09:44.479]  They felt embarrassed.
[03:09:44.479 --> 03:09:46.780]  They said, all right, go back in the line.
[03:09:46.780 --> 03:09:50.522]  Another thing happened to me, Alex, about, uh, let's see, three months ago.
[03:09:51.363 --> 03:09:52.745]  I'm on the phone.
[03:09:52.745 --> 03:09:55.688]  AT&T line calling my sister.
[03:09:55.688 --> 03:09:57.450]  Verizon line.
[03:09:57.450 --> 03:10:00.773]  What happened was they shut down my wife's insurance.
[03:10:00.773 --> 03:10:01.554]  I was kicked.
[03:10:01.554 --> 03:10:03.596]  You know, the old Obama thing.
[03:10:03.596 --> 03:10:11.065]  So out of frustration, venting to my sister on the phone, I said, you know, you know, forget JFK.
[03:10:11.065 --> 03:10:11.445]  They should
[03:10:13.046 --> 03:10:16.529]  Shoot somebody else in the head, and I was referring to our Commander-in-Chief.
[03:10:16.529 --> 03:10:19.611]  You know, you get heated, you say stupid things.
[03:10:19.611 --> 03:10:20.651]  Whatever.
[03:10:20.651 --> 03:10:21.832]  Hang up, blah blah blah.
[03:10:21.832 --> 03:10:26.815]  Two days later, Alex, as God is my witness, doorbell rings.
[03:10:26.815 --> 03:10:27.576]  I go outside.
[03:10:27.576 --> 03:10:28.477]  It's the police.
[03:10:28.477 --> 03:10:30.798]  How you doing, sir?
[03:10:30.798 --> 03:10:31.739]  Okay, how are you?
[03:10:31.739 --> 03:10:32.539]  Everything alright?
[03:10:32.539 --> 03:10:33.660]  Yeah, everything's okay.
[03:10:33.660 --> 03:10:34.641]  Can I ask why?
[03:10:34.641 --> 03:10:35.241]  What's going on?
[03:10:35.241 --> 03:10:36.302]  Why are you here?
[03:10:36.302 --> 03:10:40.725]  Uh, does, uh, shoot something blah blah blah in the head, uh, ring a bell?
[03:10:40.725 --> 03:10:41.085]  I'm like,
[03:10:42.144 --> 03:10:44.740]  So they sent the police and not the Secret Service?
[03:10:45.580 --> 03:10:52.385]  Two days, wait Alex, two days, and I said, I see the NSA works good.
[03:10:52.385 --> 03:10:53.906]  So he said, sir, is everything alright?
[03:10:53.906 --> 03:10:58.109]  I said, look, they shut down my wife's health insurance, I was ticked off.
[03:10:58.109 --> 03:11:03.893]  Here's the deal, the system's so criminal, talk to the hand, it's a felony that they're listening.
[03:11:03.893 --> 03:11:06.955]  Obama last week told the cops, don't tell the public what's going on.
[03:11:06.955 --> 03:11:08.716]  It's totally illegal.
[03:11:08.716 --> 03:11:13.239]  For those of us that are awake, it's meant to scare us not to speak out, because we're
[03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:15.661]  You know, we know what's going on.
[03:11:15.661 --> 03:11:18.142]  Others don't know what's going on.
[03:11:18.142 --> 03:11:19.822]  It's totally criminal.
[03:11:19.822 --> 03:11:21.663]  And Obama's a puppet.
[03:11:21.663 --> 03:11:23.744]  It's obviously a figure of speech.
[03:11:23.744 --> 03:11:24.965]  But we don't want anything to happen to him.
[03:11:24.965 --> 03:11:27.186]  It'll turn him into a martyr.
[03:11:27.186 --> 03:11:29.086]  But yes, this is going on.
[03:11:29.086 --> 03:11:33.068]  This has happened in France, where people send a text.
[03:11:33.068 --> 03:11:37.290]  Or in America, people sent texts making jokes saying, America's the bomb.
[03:11:37.290 --> 03:11:39.191]  And then people come.
[03:11:39.191 --> 03:11:40.031]  It's horrible.
[03:11:40.031 --> 03:11:41.172]  So how did it end with the police?
[03:11:41.172 --> 03:11:42.052]  We've only got a few seconds.
[03:11:42.725 --> 03:11:45.086]  Basically, he said to me, uh, everything okay?
[03:11:45.086 --> 03:11:45.626]  I said, yeah.
[03:11:45.626 --> 03:11:47.107]  He said, venting, eh?
[03:11:47.107 --> 03:11:49.028]  And I told him she had the insurance canceled.
[03:11:49.028 --> 03:11:50.489]  He said, oh, she did.
[03:11:50.489 --> 03:11:55.211]  And, uh... But see, but see, but see, why are they listening to your phone?
[03:11:55.211 --> 03:11:57.292]  That's the issue.
[03:11:57.292 --> 03:12:01.394]  They're engaged in felonies with computers listening that flag them.
[03:12:01.394 --> 03:12:01.995]  Ten seconds.
[03:12:01.995 --> 03:12:02.555]  How did it end?
[03:12:03.459 --> 03:12:05.681]  Uh, basically, everything okay, sir, yeah.
[03:12:05.681 --> 03:12:06.582]  Just renting, yeah.
[03:12:06.582 --> 03:12:07.243]  Have a nice day.
[03:12:27.941 --> 03:12:34.729]  Don't forget InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com for the great life-changing products that also support this operation.
[03:12:34.729 --> 03:12:36.811]  And thank you all for your support.
[03:12:36.811 --> 03:12:38.273]  You know who you are out there.
[03:12:38.273 --> 03:12:39.515]  Let's go ahead and go to this piece now.
[03:12:51.764 --> 03:12:55.746]  Prepare yourself for a perfectly outrageous motion picture.
[03:12:55.746 --> 03:13:05.910]  Howard Beale went up there last night and said what every American feels, that he's tired of all the bull- For the sakes, Diana, we're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on national television.
[03:13:05.910 --> 03:13:10.972]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:13:10.972 --> 03:13:12.972]  There is no America.
[03:13:12.972 --> 03:13:14.413]  There is no democracy.
[03:13:15.498 --> 03:13:26.942]  There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.
[03:13:26.942 --> 03:13:30.123]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[03:13:30.123 --> 03:13:37.365]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!
[03:13:37.365 --> 03:13:43.227]  And you will atone!
[03:13:43.227 --> 03:13:44.427]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[03:13:45.708 --> 03:13:46.188]  Why me?
[03:13:46.188 --> 03:13:49.411]  It was your own television, dummy.
[03:13:49.411 --> 03:13:49.991]  I can't do it.
[03:13:49.991 --> 03:13:51.412]  We'll do it live.
[03:13:51.412 --> 03:13:52.453]  We'll do it live!
[03:13:52.453 --> 03:13:53.194]  Do it live!
[03:13:53.194 --> 03:14:07.665]  I'll write it and we'll do it live!
[03:14:17.694 --> 03:14:19.618]  This thing sucks!
[03:14:19.618 --> 03:14:20.580]  What the hell's going on?
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:22.764]  I don't know, he just said he was gonna blow his brains out.
[03:14:23.393 --> 03:14:25.514]  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today.
[03:14:25.514 --> 03:14:26.335]  I'm Bill O'Reilly.
[03:14:26.335 --> 03:14:27.415]  Thanks again for watching.
[03:14:27.415 --> 03:14:30.397]  We'll leave you with Sting and a cut off his new album.
[03:14:30.397 --> 03:14:31.157]  Take it away.
[03:14:31.157 --> 03:14:32.939]  Congressman, let me interrupt you just for a moment.
[03:14:32.939 --> 03:14:34.860]  We've got some breaking news out of Miami.
[03:14:34.860 --> 03:14:36.941]  Stand by if you will.
[03:14:36.941 --> 03:14:40.883]  Right now in Miami, Justin Bieber has been arrested on a number of charges.
[03:14:40.883 --> 03:14:46.766]  The judge is reading the charges, including resisting arrest and bribing under the influence.
[03:14:46.766 --> 03:14:49.168]  He's appearing now before the judge for his bond hearing.
[03:14:51.021 --> 03:14:57.285]  I want a show developed based on the activities of a terrorist group.
[03:14:57.285 --> 03:14:58.025]  Well, I'm mad.
[03:14:58.025 --> 03:15:00.807]  I'm gonna make a TV star out of you.
[03:15:00.807 --> 03:15:02.648]  You're gonna be a household word.
[03:15:02.648 --> 03:15:05.390]  Osama Bin Laden is just one person.
[03:15:05.390 --> 03:15:15.196]  He is representative of networks of people who absolutely have made their cause to defeat the freedoms that we understand.
[03:15:16.317 --> 03:15:18.219]  And we will not allow him to do so.
[03:15:18.219 --> 03:15:23.763]  Death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[03:15:23.763 --> 03:15:28.126]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a US helicopter.
[03:15:28.126 --> 03:15:33.651]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are US Navy SEALs.
[03:15:33.651 --> 03:15:40.056]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:43.641]  NATO is in command of the entire U.S.
[03:15:43.641 --> 03:15:45.301]  military publicly.
[03:15:45.301 --> 03:15:49.623]  Homeland Security now says their mission has nothing to do with Al Qaeda, our Muslim extremists.
[03:15:49.623 --> 03:15:55.585]  It has to do with the Tea Party, who will launch police-killing terror attacks any minute.
[03:15:55.585 --> 03:15:58.166]  With no evidence of that, now it's beginning.
[03:15:58.706 --> 03:16:01.187]  The borders are completely wide open.
[03:16:01.187 --> 03:16:04.809]  Tens of millions of people are flooding here as we speak.
[03:16:04.809 --> 03:16:11.732]  Hundreds of thousands a month pouring over the borders, being given driver's license in California to pull the lever to ban guns.
[03:16:11.732 --> 03:16:16.735]  We are in the middle of a globalist revolution against this country right now.
[03:16:16.735 --> 03:16:18.656]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[03:16:18.656 --> 03:16:20.416]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[03:16:20.416 --> 03:16:22.357]  It's a depression.
[03:16:22.357 --> 03:16:25.239]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[03:16:26.636 --> 03:16:28.619]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[03:16:28.619 --> 03:16:29.700]  Banks are going bust.
[03:16:29.700 --> 03:16:32.264]  Shopkeepers keep a gun to the decoder.
[03:16:32.264 --> 03:16:33.886]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[03:16:33.886 --> 03:16:36.770]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[03:16:36.770 --> 03:16:37.611]  We know.
[03:16:37.611 --> 03:16:40.775]  The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
[03:16:41.596 --> 03:16:50.342]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[03:16:50.342 --> 03:16:53.004]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[03:16:53.004 --> 03:16:53.964]  They're crazy.
[03:16:53.964 --> 03:16:57.347]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[03:16:57.347 --> 03:17:04.271]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[03:17:04.271 --> 03:17:08.854]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[03:17:08.854 --> 03:17:09.935]  Just leave us alone.
[03:17:09.935 --> 03:17:11.276]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[03:17:12.136 --> 03:17:15.659]  I want you to get back!
[03:17:15.659 --> 03:17:16.580]  Network.
[03:17:16.580 --> 03:17:18.842]  Television will never be the same.
[03:17:18.842 --> 03:17:21.064]  Good.
[03:17:21.064 --> 03:17:22.565]  Get on the ground!
[03:17:22.565 --> 03:17:23.947]  Get on the ground now!
[03:17:23.947 --> 03:17:25.828]  Get on the ground!
[03:17:25.828 --> 03:17:27.209]  Get on the ground!
[03:17:27.209 --> 03:17:31.954]  I love this country so much.
[03:17:35.162 --> 03:17:39.707]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[03:17:39.707 --> 03:17:43.951]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[03:17:43.951 --> 03:17:46.393]  Who are they going to fight a war against?
[03:17:46.393 --> 03:17:50.798]  And just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[03:17:51.078 --> 03:17:58.321]  Multiple sources tell CNN as many as 40 veterans died while they were waiting for medical care at this VA facility.
[03:17:58.321 --> 03:18:05.484]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube, uh, well, he has 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube.
[03:18:05.484 --> 03:18:13.648]  And a sort of cringe, arch-conservative, uh, deeply, I think, racist, strange... Count Alex Jones to a boxing match.
[03:18:13.888 --> 03:18:17.832]  Just show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them.
[03:18:17.832 --> 03:18:18.693]  I'd love to see that.
[03:18:18.693 --> 03:18:20.235]  In uniform!
[03:18:20.235 --> 03:18:21.957]  These folks are getting paid to be racist.
[03:18:21.957 --> 03:18:22.617]  Hey, listen!
[03:18:22.617 --> 03:18:23.598]  I'm here to warn people!
[03:18:23.598 --> 03:18:25.140]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[03:18:25.140 --> 03:18:26.702]  This isn't a game!
[03:18:26.702 --> 03:18:30.145]  I want you to get up now.
