[00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:15.459]  We're here in the Red River District of downtown Austin, Texas, where last night a suspected drunk driver crashed through a barricade, killing two people and injuring 23 others.
[00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:25.308]  Now we're going to ask some of the locals, as well as the out-of-towners, if we should consider banning cars, just like how gun control advocates are always demanding that we ban guns after a shooting.
[00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:27.671]  So did you hear about what happened last night with the
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.541]  I just heard right now.
[00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.181]  Really?
[00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:31.442]  So what do you think about it?
[00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:32.883]  Drunk people suck.
[00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:37.607]  I think those kinds of things happen when you have a bunch of drunk people all together in one place.
[00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:40.729]  I hate to say it, it's almost like terroristic like what happened last night.
[00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.330]  It's bad, yeah.
[00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:43.211]  I don't know.
[00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.812]  I guess there was an accident.
[00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:47.454]  I think that people are idiots.
[00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:54.259]  Considering that the driver drove a car and killed people using a car, do you think we should have a ban on cars?
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.860]  Probably.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.120]  I think so.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.120]  Ban cars, for sure.
[00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:58.341]  Absolutely.
[00:00:58.501 --> 00:00:59.701]  We should just ban everything.
[00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:00.481]  Ban everything.
[00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:02.042]  Ban pencils, ban knives.
[00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:03.322]  Hell.
[00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:06.823]  Ban walking on the street, because hey, you can trip and fall and kill yourself.
[00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:12.205]  I mean, people are always saying we should ban guns after a shooting event, so maybe we should just ban cars too, right?
[00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:13.785]  No.
[00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:18.427]  But I don't think we should have...
[00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:20.556]  So many guns.
[00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:21.778]  There should be.
[00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.162]  I mean, there are weapons in the right hands.
[00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.706]  I mean, just like a plane can be used as a weapon.
[00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.150]  I do believe it's important to keep laws.
[00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:35.220]  Progressing towards reducing firearms and reducing cars and the use of cars.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.764]  I mean, we should just stay in our bedrooms with mattresses strapped to us.
[00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:41.965]  Put a straitjacket on you.
[00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:44.446]  Maybe I could put pillows over my head.
[00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:45.948]  They're not really comparable, though.
[00:01:46.448 --> 00:01:48.109]  I mean, you ban cars, people can't get around.
[00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.431]  You ban guns, people can't... I don't know.
[00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:54.255]  I have a lot of guns myself, but they never killed anybody.
[00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:21.308]  I know it was like a certain right that we were given in the beginning, but I mean, at the end of the day, facts are facts.
[00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.209]  The Constitution is, what, two going on three hundred years old?
[00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.210]  So, I mean, it was a whole different situation than now.
[00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:40.434]  You know that the reason the founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment was based on ancient philosophers such as Cicero, Livy, and even Machiavelli, who was known for giving advice to tyrants.
[00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:48.056]  That they all wanted an armed population to defend against tyrants, and not so much for hunting.
[00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:48.997]  Did you know that?
[00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:50.357]  I did not know that.
[00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:51.717]  Now you know.
[00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:56.259]  If we're using the guns to fight against tyrants, that would make more sense.
[00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:01.681]  But seeing as we live in America, I don't really feel like that's necessary anymore.
[00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:02.421]  You don't?
[00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.661]  I don't, actually.
[00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:04.762]  Because we're
[00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:09.075]  We don't really need guns, I guess.
[00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:10.596]  People are just gonna get hurt.
[00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:11.717]  It's like, what's the point?
[00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:18.962]  I do realize that majority of the murders that happen around the world have been committed by governments, which has been termed democide.
[00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:19.843]  What's your take on that?
[00:03:20.483 --> 00:03:21.964]  Well, I don't believe in violence.
[00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:23.265]  Yeah, we should ban pizza.
[00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:24.886]  Hey, hey, pizza?
[00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:26.167]  Yeah, I'm fat, whatever.
[00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:27.568]  That's my choice.
[00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.869]  Personal choice.
[00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.132]  So you're saying that you're responsible and not the pizza, correct?
[00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:33.833]  Yeah, it's life choices.
[00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:38.016]  So you'd say that the driver was responsible and not the car, right?
[00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:40.097]  Hey, it's an instrument.
[00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:43.998]  So you would say the shooter is responsible and not the gun, correct?
[00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:45.679]  Yeah, I would.
[00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.759]  You believe in personal responsibility?
[00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.719]  Yeah, I do.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.481]  Now, in the filming of this report, I had to stay out of the way of multiple cars.
[00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.921]  I almost got hit by a golf cart at one point.
[00:03:55.382 --> 00:04:00.423]  Yet, we do not see Michael Bloomberg spending millions of dollars to fund an anti-car movement.
