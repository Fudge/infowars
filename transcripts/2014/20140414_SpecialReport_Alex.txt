[00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:14.454]  Sir, I've read you what your department promised, and it is inadequate, and I realize that contempt is not a big deal to our Attorney General, but it is important that we have proper oversight.
[00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.375]  You don't want to go there, okay?
[00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:19.396]  I don't want to go there?
[00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:19.836]  No.
[00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:21.256]  About the contempt?
[00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:23.277]  You should not assume
[00:00:27.702 --> 00:00:37.030]  That was Attorney General Eric Holder angry over the way his actions have been characterized.
[00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:42.695]  Meanwhile, Holder still has not supplied the gentleman or the American people with the documents requested.
[00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:49.021]  We don't want to go there with Holder knowing about the ATF running guns into Mexico and then lying about it.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.302]  Attorney General Eric Holder was sent briefings on the controversial Fast and Furious operation as far back as July 2010.
[00:00:56.382 --> 00:01:00.204]  That directly contradicts his statement to Congress.
[00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:04.385]  Listen to what Holder told a Judiciary Committee hearing on May 3rd this year.
[00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:09.447]  I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.
[00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:18.898]  Yet internal Justice Department documents show that at least 10 months before that hearing, Holder began receiving frequent memos discussing Fast and Furious.
[00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:23.025]  Don't go there with Holder wanting drones for the same unaccountable ATF.
[00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:27.111]  Don't go there with Holder wanting gun owners to wear trackable bracelets.
[00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:34.275]  Don't go there about Holder deflecting press questions about the death of a man the FBI confused with Timothy McVeigh.
[00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:39.997]  But do let Holder go there saying that he is the only AG to suffer this kind of treatment.
[00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:47.561]  Unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly, and divisive adversity.
[00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:50.383]  If you don't believe that,
[00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:54.743]  You look at the way, and forget about me, forget about me.
[00:01:55.784 --> 00:02:00.506]  You look at the way the Attorney General of the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee.
[00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:01.946]  Had nothing to do with me, forget that.
[00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:06.408]  What Attorney General has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?
[00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:15.892]  Insanely, Eric Holder has come out and said it's basically racism that people are treating him with quote disrespect when he's ignored congressional subpoenas for four years.
[00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:20.654]  And he says no Attorney General's ever been treated like this.
[00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:28.035]  I could dig up three today when I saw this clip in a few minutes online in the last hundred years that served prison time.
[00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:35.857]  The last one was John N. Menschel, served 19 months and died in prison due to his involvement in the Watergate affair.
[00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.638]  He was sentenced to prison in 1977, serving 19 months.
[00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:42.499]  I've got the Attorney General saying that never happened.
[00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.359]  Of course, this guy's as white as a snowflake.
[00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:49.894]  As bold as a cue ball and as goofy looking as a rattlesnake.
[00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:55.676]  The point is that that's all they've got now is race card.

[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.846]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:17.208]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.991]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:24.134]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.617]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:34.883]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:46.147]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:47.688]  We are the resistance.
[00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:49.329]  You are the resistance.
[00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.249]  You are the info war.
[00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.571]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:57.392]  We are the true media.
[00:03:57.552 --> 00:04:00.133]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:03.897]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
