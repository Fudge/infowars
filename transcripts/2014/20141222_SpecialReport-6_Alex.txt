[00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:12.107]  We're here with Extremist here in Spokane, Washington.
[00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:13.908]  And this guy is so extreme.
[00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:20.773]  Oh my God, he's got a rainbow flag and a don't tread on me flag mixed together and he's... Oh, he's got a gun.
[00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:21.493]  He's got a gun.
[00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:24.095]  Hey, what's up with the flag and why are you here today?
[00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:26.836]  So I've got the LGBT flag with Gaston on it.
[00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:29.978]  It stands for liberty, liberty for all, gay rights, gun rights.
[00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.459]  Personal freedoms, human rights.
[00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.640]  So we're here basically for the police department.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.841]  Sheriffs indicated that he had an MRAP to go after constitutionalists, gun owners, and felt threatened by that.
[00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:43.942]  That's the foundation of this country.
[00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:52.984]  So I think that's kind of irrational to have a fear against the people who stand for this country, should focus on real terrorists, real threats to the community.
[00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.614]  Question even the need for an MRAP to go after the community.
[00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.137]  What is he afraid of?
[00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:04.766]  What kind of a terrorist does he think he's going to face in a community that he needs a military weapon?
[00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.771]  Well, and I'm a little bit confused.
[00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:12.116]  I thought that extremists, that right-wing extremists were against gay people.
[00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:14.037]  Do you have a problem with this flag?
[00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:15.198]  Oh, I got no problem with this flag.
[00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:15.559]  I love it.
[00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:23.906]  Actually, I was really glad at Will Not Comply on the 13th as well that we saw the LGBT community come out in force, you know, and they were out there.
[00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:25.727]  And you know there are conservatives out in that crowd.
[00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:26.788]  You've got a thousand people there.
[00:01:26.948 --> 00:01:27.789]  Everyone has different opinions.
[00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:29.631]  You know there's people out there who don't like gay people.
[00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:31.594]  But we set aside our petty differences.
[00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:32.196]  We come out.
[00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:33.258]  We support human rights.
[00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:34.119]  We support liberty.
[00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:39.470]  And I think it's a great thing to finally see us, you know, to finally put that division behind us, you know.
[00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.094]  We can all agree on freedom.
[00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:42.897]  Man, I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:49.260]  And what about the comments that the Deputy Sheriff said about the MRAPs going after Constitutionalists and gun owners?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.681]  Is that why you're here, and does that alarm you?
[00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:53.221]  It alarms me a lot.
[00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.823]  I don't see why they would need an MRAP.
[00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:02.326]  And my question to the Sheriff is, the MRAP, you say, is to protect us.
[00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:05.308]  You're protecting us from us?
[00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:06.329]  How does that make sense?
[00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.110]  With an MRAP?
[00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:08.772]  How does that make sense at all?
[00:02:09.453 --> 00:02:11.756]  Can you justify that to me please?
[00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:13.038]  Or to all of us here?
[00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:15.721]  Because we're not going to put up with this.
[00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.166]  I know he's fought for our rights, I've fought for our rights.
[00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:28.400]  We have a lot of veterans here who fought for our rights and our freedom, and we will not stand by and let those of us who have served be called terrorists.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.842]  That is not a right with me.
[00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.104]  That is not a right with us.
[00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:33.468]  If this sheriff does not apologize and
[00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.370]  Get the constitutional training he needs.
[00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.652]  I am very much for recalling the sheriff.
[00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:41.752]  That is not okay.
[00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:50.794]  Yeah, because I'm more angry with the sheriff than I am the deputy who made those remarks, because the sheriff, he's the one that had the SPLC come in and train those guys, you know?
[00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:52.675]  And he's also working with FEMA.
[00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:56.676]  We know that the Department of Justice is now working with the Police Department, Homeland Security.
[00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:01.417]  So these guys are working together to train their police force into believing that
[00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:06.762]  I was watching Ozzy's video and it amazed me how the first thing he did was he slammed InfoWars.
[00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:09.765]  He slammed Alex and he challenged him to a debate.
[00:03:22.228 --> 00:03:24.549]  And I really look forward to seeing that debate.
[00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.151]  Oh where oh where is Ozzy Knezovich gone?
[00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:30.173]  Where oh where can he be?
[00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.334]  I have a feeling that he's going to hide from Alex.
[00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:36.436]  I think he's going to be hiding from Alex Jones.
[00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:43.600]  So what would you say, if you could look in the camera and you had a message for the sheriff, what would you like to tell him?
[00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:48.063]  I'd like to tell him to get rid of the SEMRAP.
[00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:49.864]  I mean, that's a good start.
[00:03:52.202 --> 00:03:57.568]  This rally was kind of, as far as my understanding, it was a rally to ask him to get rid of the MRAP.
[00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.732]  So show some good faith, listen to the people, and get rid of the MRAP.
[00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:08.601]  And since he won't come out and talk to us in person, I guess he's going to have to look on video and he's going to have to go to InfoWars.com of all places.
[00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:11.845]  And you watch, he'll go and he'll check it out, so, you know.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.763]  We want to have a dialogue.
[00:04:13.943 --> 00:04:16.849]  So you need to come out, you need to talk to the people in your community.
[00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.198]  They're not happy with MRAPs patrolling their neighborhoods, and they want it out of there.
[00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:22.921]  And you can't just run and hide, Sheriff.
[00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:24.044]  You've got to talk to your people.
[00:04:32.754 --> 00:04:43.877]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
