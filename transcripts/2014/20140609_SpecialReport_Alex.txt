[00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:08.585]  We've seen people leave the mainstream media.
[00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.748]  Amber Lyon leaves CNN and more recently Cheryl Atkinson leaves CBS.
[00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:19.653]  They talk about the censorship that happens at the major networks and about how their stories are often forced to take an unnatural turn.
[00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:23.856]  Now we have this story from Infowars.com, the Corpse News Network.
[00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.337]  CNN airs footage showing dead body.
[00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:29.720]  So we'll show you the footage first and I'll come back and give you my commentary.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.462]  And I will warn you that what you're about to see is graphic.
[00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:37.497]  It's in Cummings, Georgia, which is north of Atlanta.
[00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:41.160]  Apparently, a deputy has been shot.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.382]  I'm not sure what that was, but get that off the air.
[00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:45.463]  I'm not sure what that was.
[00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:49.166]  So you heard the anchor say, I'm not sure what that was, but get it off the air.
[00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:57.092]  I believe referring to this, this is somebody, from what I can tell, seems to be handcuffed, bloodied, beaten, and also dragged behind the SWAT wagon.
[00:00:57.392 --> 00:00:59.674]  Well, my question is, where are the first responders?
[00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:00.795]  Where's the ambulance?
[00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:02.116]  What happened to the police?
[00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:06.240]  It seems like this guy was dragged here and just dumped out here like a bag of trash.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.010]  And as you recall, last year, the shooting at the Lone Star College in Houston, CNN also ran a clip and they said, hey, get that off the screen because of what you might see.
[00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.032]  Well, what I might see is the truth.
[00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:37.801]  We saw reports where CNN and other corporate media, cable channels, were saying, we're not going to show you the live helicopter feeds out of KHOU in Houston in case you see something, you know, violent and see something bad to protect you.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.361]  The Harris, North Harris campus is on lockdown.
[00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:42.821]  This is an active situation.
[00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:48.862]  We are not showing you live pictures because, because, because of what, what we may possibly see.
[00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:51.703]  As a result, we are showing you delayed tape pictures.
[00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:53.944]  Because you think about foreign media, they'll show you these things.
[00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:56.664]  They'll show you about people being shot, stabbed, whatever.
[00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:59.965]  Where here in the States, you're lucky to see somebody getting a fight at a liquor store.
[00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:01.385]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:02.686]  Why can't they show these things?
[00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:06.907]  And I understand, you know, you have small children and other people who may be watching these things.
[00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:11.229]  Okay, so you don't re-air it at some point, but if it's happening live, this is real live news.
[00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:12.549]  Info wars here.
[00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.029]  We'll go out.
[00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.630]  We don't even have these big satellite trucks and helicopters.
[00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.373]  We'll go out there in an iPhone and shoot something live because if that's what we have to work with, that's what we have to work with because we want to show you the truth unless you sort it out for yourself afterwards.
[00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:25.934]  But why they won't show you like this?
[00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.775]  Other mainstream networks will show you things like this.
[00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:31.275]  Uh, not, uh, not continuing.
[00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:33.876]  Congresswoman Harmon, let me, let me interrupt you.
[00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.377]  Congresswoman, let me interrupt you just for a moment.
[00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.117]  We've got some breaking news out of Miami.
[00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:39.258]  Stand by if you will.
[00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:44.280]  Right now in Miami, Justin Bieber has been arrested on a number of charges.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.182]  The judge is reading the charges, including resisting arrest and bribing under the influence.
[00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:56.664]  He's appearing now before the judge for his... And this is what the mainstream networks try to pass off as real news and information.
[00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:57.925]  Bieber fever.
[00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:02.049]  Breaking news stories about guys who wear diaper pants and throw eggs at people.
[00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.735]  Even President Obama has to joke about how MSNBC does not have an audience.
