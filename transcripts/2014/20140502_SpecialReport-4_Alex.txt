[00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:18.235]  Following two propaganda-fueled days centered around fake photos supposedly proving that Russian troops were inside the Ukraine, the New York Times has issued a retraction.
[00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:24.620]  Buried deep on page A9, the newspaper admits the authenticity of the photos has come under scrutiny.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.648]  The establishment media and the State Department pawned these photos off as evidence, despite the fact the authenticity of the photographs couldn't be independently verified.
[00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:44.220]  Freelance photographer Maxim Dondiuk, who worked for a Russian news magazine, told the New York Times he had taken the group photograph in Slavyansk and posted it on his Instagram account.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.444]  He told the newspaper that nobody asked his permission to use the photograph.
[00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:55.270]  This isn't the first time the war machine media have churned out false evidence in an effort to gear the country up for war.
[00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.815]  Last year, the BBC appeared to use stunning fakery in an effort to launch a war with Syria.
[00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:08.161]  This report was first released on August 29, 2013, just days before an attack on Syria seemed inevitable.
[00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:17.009]  The BBC claims it just so happened to be filming at a small hospital when victims of a napalm-style attack poured into that very spot.
[00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:23.370]  Among the medics here was a British doctor, visiting for the charity Hand in Hand.
[00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:28.956]  I need a pause because it's just absolute chaos and carnage here.
[00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:34.281]  We've had a massive influx of what looks like serious burns.
[00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:40.967]  It seems like it must be some sort of, I'm not really sure, maybe napalm, something similar to that.
[00:01:41.147 --> 00:01:48.288]  Exactly one month later, Obama and crew were trying to pin the chemical weapons attack on Assad without success.
[00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:58.450]  So, BBC airs the exact same clip, this time artificially dubbing the doctor's voice to suit the establishment's need for the chemical weapons tagline.
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.691]  We've had a massive influx of what look like serious burns.
[00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:06.692]  It seems like it must be some sort of...
[00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:18.176]  In a subsequent BBC interview, Dr. Rola Halam complained about the UK Parliament's refusal to authorize a military strike on Syria.
[00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:26.579]  Interestingly, Halam's father is also on the Syrian National Council, the political body which represents opposition militants.
[00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.560]  And if this all seems familiar, well it should.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.102]  A similar disinfo tactic was used to bolster support for the war with Iraq.
[00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:36.523]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:48.500]  That was Nurse Nayyirah, whose tearful testimony swung the pendulum in favor of war.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:58.007]  After the vote was safely passed, Nayyirah, the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington, admitted to making the whole story up.
[00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:06.594]  Nurse Nayyirah and those faulty claims of weapons of mass destruction weren't the only lies told to convince America a war with Iraq was necessary.
[00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:09.617]  CNN also did their part to play up the drama.
[00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:13.173]  CNN's Carl Rochelle is here with me, just came up.
[00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:18.257]  Carl, I know we can't be very specific given these restrictions, but within those parameters, what did you see?
[00:03:18.477 --> 00:03:21.079]  Well, what I saw, I didn't see anything hit.
[00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.021]  I looked very, almost straight above us.
[00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:28.425]  There is a vapor trail coming from my right to my left, and there's a cloud of something.
[00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:31.767]  It looks like it might have been an explosion, a cloud, or I'd say...
[00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:56.095]  Oh, I love this country so much.
[00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:02.720]  These false flag mass media war campaigns are so typical, in fact, there's even a movie about it.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.361]  Okay, good.
[00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:05.322]  Put the village behind her.
[00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:09.385]  Give me some flames.
[00:04:11.664 --> 00:04:12.984]  Some sound of screaming?
[00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:18.646]  That's good, we can link that to the press.
[00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:21.306]  They can downlink it on Telstar 401, transporter 21.
[00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:27.087]  And this just in, a news break special report from the Albanian front.
[00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:34.769]  We've just received information that the young Albanian national fleeing in this video is attempting to escape terrorist reprisals in her village.
[00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:42.146]  Even before television was invented, mainstream media was still lined to go to war.
[00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:49.894]  In 1895, William Randolph Hearst of the New York Journal sent his employees to cover the Cuban revolt against Spain.
[00:04:50.254 --> 00:04:58.903]  Lacking anything newsworthy to report, Hearst told his employee, famed illustrator Frederick Remington, you furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war.
[00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:04.266]  The establishment media continues to serve as the propaganda arm of the war machine.
[00:05:04.747 --> 00:05:15.814]  It is their job to file dubious reports as part of a campaign to build public consensus for ongoing interventions from Iraq and Libya to Syria and eventually Ukraine.
[00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.858]  Boy, do I almost look stupid.
