[00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:21.967]  We are here in occupied Spokane Valley, Washington, where local law enforcement officials are being trained by the, wait for it, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:00:22.247 --> 00:00:24.589]  That's right, truth is definitely stranger than fiction.
[00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:30.594]  Those of you unfamiliar with the SPLC, they're the ones who monitor so-called hate groups.
[00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:42.702]  And they are infamously known for comparing Libertarians, Conservatives, and Constitutionalists to violent racists like the KKK, Aryan Brotherhood, and even Neo-Nazis.
[00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:49.827]  Now the SPLC, they are a non-profit organization largely funded by the likes of George Soros and company.
[00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.789]  And the rise to power is really escalating right now.
[00:00:53.849 --> 00:01:03.755]  They have multi-millions of dollars invested into this organization and they have totally infiltrated the leftist lapdog mainstream media.
[00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:07.917]  It's not uncommon, for example, to find SPLC contributors
[00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:12.138]  Embedded in the mainstream media like we see in CNN and MSNBC.
[00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:17.460]  In fact it was just a couple years ago where Chris Matthews, well he had an hour-long special.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:34.965]  It was called The Rise of the New Right and it was basically scaring Americans into believing that there is a sudden surge of right-wing extremists on the rise in America and even went as far as implicating that Alex Jones is part of that threat.
[00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.066]  Now the list is always absurd.
[00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:45.570]  I'm going to name some of the people and organizations that have been listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate watch list.
[00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:58.357]  Names like Larry Pratt from Gun Owners of America, Pastor Chuck Baldwin, Joel Skousen, Judge Napolitano from Fox News, according to the SPLC, could be an extremist.
[00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.412]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:03.013]  Yes, they actually said that.
[00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:10.616]  Congressman Ron Paul, according to the SPLC, might be a dangerous right-wing extremist and potential terrorist.
[00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:17.019]  And the most dangerous right-wing extremist of all, due to his massive influence, is Alex Jones.
[00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.002]  So what happens when the SPLC trains our nation's police departments?
[00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:23.202]  Well, let's take a look.
[00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:39.973]  The nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to a front wall and take enemy fire and still try to address a threat without being feared of getting shot.
[00:02:40.273 --> 00:02:44.917]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:45.937]  would you see that happening?
[00:02:46.097 --> 00:02:46.678]  Well, it's hard to say.
[00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:51.381]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons, a lot of ammunition.
[00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:57.036]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:58.737]  A lot of ammunition.
[00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:02.038]  They have no weapons here locally.
[00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:04.139]  Well, you heard him right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:15.143]  That deputy just said that the MRAPs that were used for combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, they are now being used to target constitutionalists and gun owners.
[00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:20.446]  Needless to say, the residents of Spokane Valley aren't too happy about those comments.
[00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:34.637]  That's why this weekend, they are organizing a protest against the military establishment and the occupying police force, not only here in Spokane Valley, Washington, but across the entire United States.
[00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:37.918]  So come out here and join us in Spokane Valley.
[00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.580]  It'll be in front of the police station this Saturday at 2 o'clock p.m.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.004]  And let's send a message to the sheriff and to the federal government that the militarization of our nation's police departments will not be tolerated.
[00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:52.986]  Again, that's this Saturday, 2 o'clock p.m.
[00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:55.107]  Spokane Valley, Washington.
[00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:56.047]  We'll see you there.
[00:03:56.308 --> 00:03:58.869]  This is Darren McBreen, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:17.637]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:19.977]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:22.778]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:26.939]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.419]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:37.701]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:42.005]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:43.866]  We are the true media.
[00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:46.609]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:50.372]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
