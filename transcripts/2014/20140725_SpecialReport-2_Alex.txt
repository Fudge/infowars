[00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.210]  What is Suspicious Activity?
[00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.514]  Well, in the UK, the definition is so broad it includes politically incorrect journalists and health advocates.
[00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:23.559]  Closer to home, emergency workers here in the States are being trained via the FBI and DHS to look out for extremists.
[00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:31.103]  First responders are asked to evaluate whether an injury is a genuine accident or related to violent extremist activity.
[00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:33.685]  But the first responders aren't the only ones.
[00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:41.167]  We've given you reports of how vendors at sports venues are being trained via the TSA to spot what they deem as terror threats.
[00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:47.109]  This is the same TSA that views using pen and paper as potential terrorist activity.
[00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:56.451]  Out of the stadiums and into the streets, the Department of Justice is advocating that placing political bumper stickers on one's vehicle could be a red flag of terror.
[00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:02.593]  More than that, if the motorist knows their constitutional rights, the officer may consider calling for backup.
[00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:12.421]  If exercising your constitutional rights is considered anti-government, then wouldn't the government suppressing your rights be considered anti-civilian, anti-person, anti-human?
[00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:19.406]  And there are many more examples than we have time to go through, but you can find these and many more at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:22.829]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:25.771]  Who?
[00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:27.012]  Stalin's father.
[00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:28.093]  Stalin's father.
[00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:30.452]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:33.353]  You mean George Washington?
[00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:34.113]  Paul Revere?
[00:01:35.173 --> 00:01:38.794]  These guys right here... Let me ask you something.
[00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:40.195]  Did they try to scare people?
[00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:43.755]  They tried to intimidate the British.
[00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:46.236]  Did they use acts of violence?
[00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:55.978]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials because they systematically had British officials assassinated.
