[00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:18.730]  Last week I had the opportunity to interview Staff Sergeant Aaron Simele and he shared with me his story about how he was mistreated inside the Army and once he got out with the VA.
[00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.493]  Where I started in the military I was with the 101st Airborne out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
[00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:26.955]  Overseas I was deployed to Baghdad, Iraq in 2005-2006 and then in Afghanistan in 08-09.
[00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:27.395]  Pretty much.
[00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:36.524]  I mean, you're in pain, they wrote you a prescription.
[00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:42.047]  You're freaking going cuckoo, or say you're feeling this way, this way, they wrote you a prescription.
[00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:46.109]  It pretty much was just like, we'll write you a prescription for this, we'll write you a prescription for that.
[00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.073]  And there's people that I know that will attest that I was pretty much in a zombie-like state.
[00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:55.835]  When I got out of the Army, my friends can attest to this.
[00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:57.836]  I was a train wreck.
[00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:05.600]  I literally was a train wreck, a zombie, hated life, hated everything, didn't know what I was going to do, and it was just awful.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.742]  I mean, you thought people were kind of coming after you for a bit of time there, though, didn't you?
[00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:11.163]  Oh yeah, I did.
[00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.005]  I mean, it was just a huge state of paranoia all the time.
[00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:20.070]  Yeah, I mean, it's normal with PTSD to have some paranoia, which I still suffer with right now.
[00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.471]  But the amount of paranoia I was having at the time when I first got out was ridiculous.
[00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:30.952]  I mean, I had friends stop talking to me because they thought that I was going nuts.
[00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:35.114]  And what did the VA, you know, in any kind of way help to do?
[00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:43.056]  If I'm not mistaken, a lot of them still ignored, you know, kind of cries for help in a sense and just continued to drug and drug.
[00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:45.466]  And just kind of use you as a guinea pig.
[00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:49.769]  Yeah, at first, I mean, at first I was a guinea pig.
[00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.872]  But, I mean, it comes a time when, you know, you get tired of being drugged up, man.
[00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:59.355]  And I started telling the doctors, hey, I don't want this anymore, I don't want that anymore.
[00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.057]  And when that didn't work, I ended up switching doctors.
[00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:05.700]  It took me several times to find the right doctors that would actually listen to you.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.043]  And all they're doing pretty much is they're experimenting on us with everything.
[00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.984]  That we, issues we have.
[00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:16.006]  And you have to put your foot down and tell them what you do want, what you don't like.
[00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.608]  And it's, it's a tedious process.
[00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:35.417]  I mean, how does it make you feel that you come back, this American hero, you know, you joined for this pure purpose and now, you know, they're starting to come out and say that we're domestic terrorists because we're patriots and, you know, we believe in something.
[00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:36.198]  We're true believers.
[00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:40.268]  Oh man, how does that make me feel?
[00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:44.870]  You know, partial, I mean, more than anything heartache, dude.
[00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.191]  I mean, it's straight heartache, you know?
[00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:50.072]  I mean, growing up as a kid, that's all I wanted to do.
[00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.233]  I wanted to be like my grandfather, be in the military, you know?
[00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:55.114]  I wanted to serve my country, be a hero to my kids.
[00:02:55.635 --> 00:03:00.637]  And then hearing all this stuff in the media now, it's just, it's ridiculous, man.
[00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:00.897]  I mean,
[00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:04.199]  You know, we're up to 22 suicides a day.
[00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:08.120]  That's almost one suicide every 63 minutes.
[00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.082]  In America, a veteran kills themselves.
[00:03:11.582 --> 00:03:14.384]  You know, have you ever battled with things like that?
[00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:16.065]  In a sense, ever thought about something like that?
[00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:21.447]  Just because that medication clouded your mind so much that you felt like you had no other options?
[00:03:22.108 --> 00:03:22.928]  I've battled with that.
[00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:25.709]  I've battled with that a lot, man.
[00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.391]  I mean, I battled with that about six months ago.
[00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:44.428]  I did help through the VA and they sent me to a program and all the psychiatrist did was give me more pills and I left that program and I found out that there's other programs besides the VA that actually help you out more.
[00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.711]  And what are those?
[00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.760]  Uh, you got the Wounded Warrior Project.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.923]  You got, in Texas, you got Team Red, White, and Blue, which is physical fitness.
[00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:59.968]  Wounded Warrior Project, they have Project Odysseys, they have Soldier Rides, they have so many different things.
[00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:01.810]  I mean, there's so many organizations out there.
[00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.851]  Those are just to name a couple.
[00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:04.893]  Well, it's good to see that you're doing better.
[00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:07.025]  Yeah, a lot of people say that.
[00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.226]  I'm glad I am, too, for my kids.
