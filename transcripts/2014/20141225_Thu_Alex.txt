[00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:03.327]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:17.888]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:21.031]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:23.174]  Well, here we are.
[00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.918]  Seems like 2014 just began and it's already December 25th.
[00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:27.499]  2014, it's Christmas.
[00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:34.692]  Yes, they've turned into a giant commercial event.
[00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:39.553]  There's record numbers of suicides and car wrecks and DWIs on the state.
[00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:50.736]  And it's not the traffic and the long lines that lead up to Christmas I like, but it is, it is the Christmas carols, it's the music of childhood, it's meeting with family.
[00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:52.797]  I like Christmas overall.
[00:00:54.221 --> 00:01:06.371]  And I really like the message of Christ that Christmas is connected to, and that's something that the system really tries to distract us from with fad-driven hoaxes like Santa Claus.
[00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:14.157]  And I'm not against that jolly old elf, it's just that he's only been manufactured in the West in the last 80 years or so.
[00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:20.842]  Sure, in the Netherlands and other areas Santa Claus was a jolly old guy, but you go back to the 1700s,
[00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:30.859]  Christmas was banned in England for a while because it was a day kind of like Devil's Night in Detroit to go out and burn down buildings and murder people.
[00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:45.565]  And Santa Claus was a striped, shirted, Freddy Krueger type elf who was a patron saint of murdering gangs that were out looting and, as I said, raping and burning down buildings.
[00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:49.327]  So Christmas is a lot of things to a lot of people.
[00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:58.539]  But on this Christmas edition of the Global Transmission, I just want to say that I'm thankful for all the great listeners out there that put up with me.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.442]  I'm thankful for my great crew.
[00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:02.184]  I'm thankful for my family.
[00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:05.048]  I'm thankful for the Providence.
[00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:15.127]  You know, God's good graces, some people call it luck, but I knock on wood and thank the good Lord above for all of the close calls I've had.
[00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:21.649]  There's certainly an invisible hand of good working there to shepherd and protect so many of us.
[00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.792]  I'm thankful for the amazing fact that I'm alive and conscious and that I can interface with all of you other conscious beings.
[00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:30.592]  It's really amazing.
[00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:35.334]  And I'm always humbled by the fact that
[00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:44.047]  I have an audience that tunes in on record levels even during days like Christmas when most radio shows have almost no listeners.
[00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:53.333]  And it's because you're hardcore folks that care about humanity, care about defeating tyranny, you take it personal, you're involved, and you're the salt of the earth.
[00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:58.256]  So, I get grumpy, I get irritable doing three, four hours of radio every day, and sometimes I'm a jerk.
[00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:18.332]  But in my heart, I really love all of you, and I appreciate you and our guest sponsors, affiliates, really everyone that's made the InfoWar possible, and has seen through all of my foibles, all of my warts, all of my problems, and seen that kernel of greatness there that has helped grow the InfoWar so much.
[00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:22.675]  Because Gandhi said that in each of us is the seed of the universe, and
[00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:32.547]  Just as I saw, and Paul Watson, and so many other great reporters I have, the seeds of greatness, you have seen that in me as well, and we see that back looking at each other.
[00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:40.590]  I mean, Drudge Report has helped us to send hundreds and hundreds of millions of visitors over the years to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.710]  I'm thankful to that.
[00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.571]  I'm thankful to other real media.
[00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:45.451]  I think so.
[00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.678]  They said if we don't get a picture of you acting crazy, it really won't go in there.
[00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:06.839]  They want to balance it.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:23.670]  It was like a famous documentary filmmaker made a big five-part documentary with me in it, Joe Belger, and when it went to Discovery Channel, they said it's too positive, make Alex look bad, and he refused, so they shelved the five million dollar project.
[00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.494]  It was a million dollar budget per piece, and it would have gotten ratings for Discovery.
[00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.456]  He's the guy that made some kind of monster
[00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:37.699]  You name it with Metallica, Brothers Keeper, just a really famous award-winning guy.
[00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.800]  I think he won an Academy Award, it was a nomination.
[00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:46.064]  I'm not bragging here, the point is that there have been so many people out there that resonate for justice and freedom.
[00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:47.345]  I know you're out there.
[00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:49.186]  We're brothers and sisters in arms together.
[00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:51.067]  So Merry Christmas to all of you.
[00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:55.989]  Even if you don't like Jesus or anything, you know it's a fun time of year and the lights are pretty.
[00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:01.250]  So I love all of you and we'll see you obviously coming up live tomorrow.
[00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:07.573]  We've got a powerful retransmission coming up right now with Billy Corrigan and the former head of the NSA and a lot more.
[00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:08.093]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.382]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:14.122 --> 00:05:20.385]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:29.550]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:42.987]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:43.147 --> 00:05:47.109]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:48.870]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:56.775]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:57.895]  But for how long?
[00:05:58.196 --> 00:06:04.459]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.661]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:09.923 --> 00:06:13.905]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.886]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:18.627]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:20.849]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.910]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.070]  Your products are great.
[00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.774]  I use DNA Force, I use XQ, Supermeal Vitality, and Lung Cleanse.
[00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:32.855]  Every day, they're great stuff.
[00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:39.078]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Supermeal Vitality, Super Female Vitality,
[00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:42.419]  Lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:50.722]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:50.902 --> 00:06:52.563]  That's true.
[00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:56.224]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[00:06:56.304 --> 00:06:57.325]  It's great stuff.
[00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:05.088]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:16.649]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:20.651]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:27.073]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:35.477]  Using Super Oxygenation OxyPowder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[00:07:35.757 --> 00:07:40.740]  InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using OxyPowder with incredible success.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.441]  I took it that first day and then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:45.482]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[00:07:45.542 --> 00:07:46.083]  I'd say a week.
[00:07:46.263 --> 00:07:46.723]  Seven days.
[00:07:47.223 --> 00:07:48.744]  And I've been able to keep it off, too.
[00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:50.585]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:51.826]  And I'm like, I know.
[00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:53.026]  I guess it's this OxyPowder.
[00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:54.987]  2015 can be different.
[00:07:55.087 --> 00:07:57.949]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:07:58.309 --> 00:08:02.110]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:59.570]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com is the website.
[00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:05.839]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com to find the new album that I just got in and can't wait to listen to the whole thing.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.003]  Monuments to an LG.
[00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:10.245]  Want to find out what that means?
[00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:11.166]  Or elegy.
[00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:19.359]  Tommy Lee, one of my favorite drummers, of course of Motley Crue fame, is doing drums on the album.
[00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:28.463]  We're going to be playing part of some of the songs here today, but not in their entirety, because that'll send the computer bots crazy out there on different internet platforms.
[00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:35.687]  Billy Corgan is our guest, or as I say it in Texas, drawl, where we butcher names, Billy Corgan!
[00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:37.007]  Billy Corgan.
[00:09:37.628 --> 00:09:40.649]  LeeAnn came here and said, you know, you're friends with him, you ought to pronounce his name right.
[00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:41.670]  Billy Corgan.
[00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.331]  And he's not in a hotel room, he's flown in and landed.
[00:09:44.932 --> 00:09:47.113]  He is in the airport right now.
[00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:51.576]  So I can't wait to have him back in studio next time he's in Austin.
[00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:54.378]  He's a regular listener and he's just a great guy.
[00:09:54.398 --> 00:09:57.700]  I learned that he was a listener through a man cow, a fellow friend.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.604]  And he's a really smart guy, one of the smartest people I've talked to, not just in music or entertainment, but period.
[00:10:05.285 --> 00:10:13.330]  And Billy Corgan has actually taught me quite a bit about perspectives and how to see the world, and has helped me mature some.
[00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.192]  And I think that's why, out of the blue...
[00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:24.378]  For the last decade or so, you see just random hit pieces, even though there's no scandals, no dirt, nothing.
[00:10:25.118 --> 00:10:28.220]  That's why you see Anderson Cooper, admittedly of the CIA, attacking him.
[00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:33.164]  Now that's why you see MSNBC saying snippy things, Rolling Stone saying snippy things.
[00:10:33.544 --> 00:10:35.225]  It's because he's outside of the system.
[00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:36.826]  He didn't play ball with them.
[00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:47.053]  He spoke out about the dumbing down of music with MTV and more, and they don't like smart people who have the power of reaching tens of millions who've sold 40 million
[00:10:47.153 --> 00:10:48.154]  I don't know.
[00:11:03.682 --> 00:11:05.163]  This is what we're talking about here.
[00:11:05.203 --> 00:11:06.705]  So he's joining us from the airport.
[00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:12.289]  I'll look even to about 40 after, 45 after or so, so he can get on his next plane or get on down the road.
[00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.532]  He was gonna be on with us yesterday, but I had a family emergency had to take care of.
[00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:19.575]  Billy Corrigan, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:23.002]  Thank you Alex, always a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:42.373]  Yeah, well it's pretty strange.
[00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:49.476]  I don't know if your listeners know the context of this, but I did a cover for a charity called Awe Chicago.
[00:11:49.516 --> 00:11:50.857]  It's a no-kill shelter model.
[00:11:51.217 --> 00:11:51.878]  Very proud.
[00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:57.200]  I've helped raise, along with my partner in the band Jeff, about a quarter million dollars for the charity.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.003]  One of my proudest things that I've ever done is being involved in animal rights issues.
[00:12:02.996 --> 00:12:04.378]  And it was about six months ago.
[00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:05.439]  You know, the image went viral.
[00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:08.421]  It's me and my rescue cats on the cover of the magazine.
[00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:11.144]  Never in a million years did I think I'd start getting attacked.
[00:12:11.184 --> 00:12:15.668]  And out of nowhere, four or five months later, there I am being made fun of.
[00:12:15.688 --> 00:12:17.990]  No context for the fact that it's a charity magazine.
[00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:23.776]  Basically presented as if I've fallen so far off the celebrity radar that I'm reduced to doing a cat magazine.
[00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:27.826]  I think he's probably been a bit shocked by the reaction because A, I fought back.
[00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.350]  I think so.
[00:13:09.298 --> 00:13:11.819]  And by the way, you don't brag about that a lot, but I've seen it.
[00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:24.883]  You help a lot of charities out there, and you were helping save and rescue cats, raising and other, you know, tons of money, and, you know, really working in the community like I know you quietly do in and around Chicago, and then you're a bad guy.
[00:13:24.943 --> 00:13:31.185]  No, it's because you are a good guy and are quietly out there working while doing other big things in media that they're scared of you.
[00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:35.846]  It's because they know they don't control you, and you know what's going on.
[00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:42.342]  Yeah, I think it is very interesting to see these kind of assassins come out of the woodwork.
[00:13:42.983 --> 00:13:45.804]  This is probably the most well-received album I've had in about 20 years.
[00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:49.967]  And I've been through a lot, you know, in my own way.
[00:13:49.987 --> 00:13:52.408]  And, you know, I've shot myself in the foot like any good artist would.
[00:13:52.769 --> 00:13:54.990]  But I've seemed to kind of dialed it back in.
[00:13:55.831 --> 00:13:57.672]  The music business is coming up back around me.
[00:13:58.152 --> 00:14:04.436]  And it's amazing that all of a sudden then you're, you know, then you're at a target because, you know, you have power, you've amassed power again.
[00:14:05.298 --> 00:14:07.444]  It's the kind of power that's very threatening to those systems.
[00:14:07.464 --> 00:14:08.748]  They do not want outliers.
[00:14:08.788 --> 00:14:09.931]  They love Muppets.
[00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:12.217]  They love people who toe the party line.
[00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:18.637]  You know, and I think it's, you know, your audience doesn't need an education on this.
[00:14:18.737 --> 00:14:22.359]  They're more aware than any audience in the world how these things work.
[00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:27.262]  So we don't have to go on about it, but I mean, I think it's very obvious that, you know, here they come.
[00:14:27.422 --> 00:14:31.004]  You know, I can, you know, the agendas start to poke out.
[00:14:31.084 --> 00:14:33.225]  I just had an interview about a week ago.
[00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:35.667]  A guy was asking me about Edward Snowden.
[00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:41.410]  Here's the line of questioning, out of nowhere, in the middle of an interview about my new album.
[00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:44.216]  Uh, do you believe Edward Stone was a hero?
[00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:44.636]  Yes.
[00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:45.577]  Why?
[00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:46.957]  Because he did the right thing.
[00:14:47.398 --> 00:14:48.058]  Next question.
[00:14:48.418 --> 00:14:49.659]  Uh, would you do the same?
[00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:52.201]  Okay, I told the guy to go, you know what himself.
[00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:54.082]  I said, am I running for president?
[00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:57.044]  I mean, what kind of, what kind of line of questioning is that?
[00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:57.985]  I'm promoting an album.
[00:14:59.403 --> 00:15:16.970]  Well, and the reason we raise it, I know my audience is very informed, it's that obviously you can speak here uncensored, they won't be able to filter it as much, and so you can speak directly to it because this is what happens to myself, to Ron Paul, to countless others that really try to shift the paradigm.
[00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.354]  into really waking up to the larger control system is they put articles out constantly.
[00:15:22.474 --> 00:15:24.956]  Alex Jones, you know, has no audience.
[00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:27.138]  Alex Jones wishes he wasn't discredited.
[00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:36.025]  Alex Jones is a racist with no proof but we know they're doing it because they want to assassinate the messenger.
[00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:46.074]  But the good news is they've already assassinated their own credibility so they're shooting blanks and I don't think in their arrogance they figured that out yet, Billy.
[00:15:47.208 --> 00:16:13.145]  No, I agree with you, but just to give you a little bit of context on the other side of it, right after the Anderson Cooper thing kind of went viral, I know you put a story on your site and I gave a quote for that, when that sort of kind of ticked back up into the mainstream consciousness, I probably did about ten interviews in the next couple days, and in seven of the ten interviews I was asked about the Anderson Cooper flap, and five of the seven people who interviewed me had no idea it was for a charity.
[00:16:14.335 --> 00:16:16.641]  So that shows you that there is still a little effectiveness.
[00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:17.162]  Oh, I agree.
[00:16:17.202 --> 00:16:19.969]  Counting on that low information crowd that will be on the headline.
[00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:21.119]  That's it.
[00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:27.660]  They are targeting a low information crowd, but again, that crowd of zombies really don't even matter anymore.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.101]  I mean, I'm sad to say that it's like they're almost not even people.
[00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:38.543]  They've decided to just mindlessly buy into this and this narcissistic, thin, mindless gruel that's being spewed out.
[00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:44.184]  But speaking, speaking of Anderson Cooper, and we're going to get into your album that I do think is one of your best in a long time.
[00:16:45.484 --> 00:16:48.365]  Speaking of Anderson Cooper, he really is a CIA guy.
[00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:51.107]  He really was in the CIA, not just an intern.
[00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:56.829]  He really is the grandson of one of the biggest dynasties in the country.
[00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:57.950]  Or is it the Astors?
[00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:04.793]  So, he's a little rich kid, given everything he's got, he's failed, he has some of the worst ratings on CNN.
[00:17:05.173 --> 00:17:10.815]  So I would feel good, Billy, just to have this joke, this failure, that was given everything.
[00:17:10.835 --> 00:17:12.496]  I mean, you came from nowhere, I came from nowhere.
[00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:14.077]  He was given everything.
[00:17:14.597 --> 00:17:28.405]  You know, I think what's interesting, to me, I try to stay out of the personal side of it, although I did say the other day I wasn't born with a silver spoon up my arse like he was.
[00:17:29.106 --> 00:17:30.807]  I think it's very interesting that
[00:17:31.997 --> 00:17:33.578]  There is a level of arrogance here.
[00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:38.240]  That crowd, whatever that crowd is, and I've hung with them, you know, I've been in those rooms and so have you.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.080]  I've been to those parties and so have you.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.522]  That crowd really thinks they can sort of flick us off the shoulder anytime they want.
[00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:49.384]  And what they don't realize is that people like you and me are just symbols of a much greater conversation.
[00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:53.966]  They don't understand that a vast part of our country is waking up.
[00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:58.767]  Uh, is breaking this hypnosis, this grip of hypnosis, and they can't see it.
[00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:00.288]  They literally can't see it.
[00:18:00.328 --> 00:18:07.812]  They do not think, they literally think they can just double down, triple down on these narratives and these false paradigms and the public's just going to keep laughing them up.
[00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:23.500]  Uh, and I think, uh, as we've seen from recent events, people are starting to sort of question that the narratives and, and, and you see the media, those old world medias doubling, triple, quadrupling down on false, uh, storylines because they literally don't have a B plan.
[00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:35.444]  I agree with you, and just the beginning of the questioning is the beginning of the end, because as soon as you question, you're no longer only in that narrow, low-information media system.
[00:18:35.724 --> 00:18:37.385]  You now discover the wider world.
[00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:40.007]  You come out of Plato's cave, and it's game over.
[00:18:40.347 --> 00:18:42.508]  That is such an incredibly exciting thing.
[00:18:42.528 --> 00:18:49.932]  You know, I think one of your songs in the last album, or the album before, was about the world on fire, and the lyrics really spoke to this.
[00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:51.833]  I remember we were talking like six years ago, and you were
[00:18:52.153 --> 00:18:59.419]  I get the sense from talking to my friends and family, and I'm sure many of your listeners, of course, which I'm one of, those conversations that we had around the dinner table seven years ago,
[00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:18.338]  Which were really difficult conversations to have and people would just throw their hands up and say you're crazy.
[00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:19.561]  Now people are listening.
[00:19:20.223 --> 00:19:23.532]  And just the fact that you're even able to sit at that table and have those conversations.
[00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:38.754]  And be able to back it up with statistics and people, you know, the failure of this particular administration, the lying that goes on, and the fact that there's this greater divide between the public that's awake and the public that's asleep.
[00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:44.397]  I mean, those that are asleep really must want to be asleep because, I mean, how could you not be?
[00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:45.478]  Eyes open at this point.
[00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:46.487]  That's right.
[00:19:46.547 --> 00:19:49.049]  How could you not be eyes open at this point?
[00:19:49.069 --> 00:19:52.411]  And his mother was a Vanderbilt, the heir of the entire Vanderbilt fortune.
[00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:56.394]  Not a, not a, um, aster, but it doesn't matter.
[00:19:56.414 --> 00:19:57.074]  They're interrelated.
[00:19:57.374 --> 00:20:04.399]  And again, nothing wrong with being the last male heir of one of the biggest robber baron, horrible dynasties.
[00:20:04.499 --> 00:20:08.662]  It's just give us a break, Anderson Cooper, because I don't even get into fighting with these personalities.
[00:20:08.882 --> 00:20:13.485]  But at the same time, I think it's important to not just respond and say, Hey, I'm helping a cat charity.
[00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:14.105]  Leave me alone.
[00:20:14.425 --> 00:20:15.326]  Don't try to make me, you know,
[00:20:15.486 --> 00:20:16.747]  Look like it has been when I'm not.
[00:20:17.087 --> 00:20:21.311]  Everybody knows that you've been popular all along and you've had big resurgences.
[00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:23.133]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[00:20:23.193 --> 00:20:24.774]  I mean, you've sold 40 million albums.
[00:20:25.174 --> 00:20:29.218]  Anderson Cooper is on a failed network that's converting to cooking shows.
[00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:30.699]  So I'm not being nasty.
[00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:33.862]  It's just they are dancing on their own graves.
[00:20:34.202 --> 00:20:43.390]  When you are just having the courage to express what's already there, and as you said, we're like little tips of icebergs sticking up, or little focal points, as Ron Paul always says.
[00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.591]  I mean, we're nothing.
[00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:49.415]  We are just like everybody else that is trying to find out what the hell is really going on.
[00:20:51.661 --> 00:20:56.804]  I can't disagree with you, and I think there's a democratization there in the way that we're all communicating.
[00:20:57.104 --> 00:21:02.467]  And, you know, thank God for people like you for building these new systems by which we're sharing information.
[00:21:03.187 --> 00:21:05.869]  And, you know, we're building up our own networks of communication.
[00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:11.752]  I mean, basically, I would argue we're past the tipping point, and now it's just how is this all going to play out?
[00:21:12.012 --> 00:21:14.614]  And as you've been predicting for, I don't know, how many years?
[00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:20.622]  Now we're seeing the rolling out of this next wave of control and propaganda.
[00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.506]  But the fact of the matter is that everyone's so prepared.
[00:21:24.326 --> 00:21:26.868]  And has been sort of mentally prepared for what's coming.
[00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:32.292]  I just want to point out one small thing, because I think it's important in the context of the conversation we're having.
[00:21:32.673 --> 00:21:42.040]  You know, when President Obama was elected, that night I went on stage and I knew, I was already listening to you, I was kind of like half awake, let's put it.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.124]  And I went on stage and I said, let's hope this isn't a sign that things are going to go in the right direction.
[00:21:47.164 --> 00:21:53.429]  And you actually ran a piece, and we didn't know each other then, you did a piece kind of mocking me for being another celebrity sort of buying, drinking the Kool-Aid.
[00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.692]  And I was thinking back to that time.
[00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.213]  I wasn't offended by the piece.
[00:21:58.253 --> 00:21:59.073]  I thought it was kind of funny.
[00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:03.396]  But I remember thinking back to the time where I was in my own kind of awakening.
[00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:12.522]  And, you know, we have to remember, those of us that are awake, there are so many people that are in that horrible moment of like, wow, if this stuff is true, what do I do?
[00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:15.144]  And we see that more and more now.
[00:22:15.204 --> 00:22:20.508]  You see people waking up and it's really shocking to them that they've been given a lie sort of all along.
[00:22:21.212 --> 00:22:31.200]  And as you sit in bars and, you know, around coffee houses and talk to people about what's really going on, you can see that it's not so much that they don't know that something's happening, they just don't know what to do about it.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.201]  So we have to continue to prepare the way.
[00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:38.265]  And, you know, this is not some begging appeal, you know, to be supported as an artist.
[00:22:38.285 --> 00:22:46.331]  But what I would say to everybody is, is the artists in many ways are some of the most dangerous people in the world because we have that, we have that street credibility to go out and sing some gospel.
[00:22:47.114 --> 00:22:54.906]  And that's what makes me dangerous, is once my career starts rolling in the right direction again, well here I come, because how is it possible?
[00:22:54.966 --> 00:22:56.829]  I mean, they've tried to kill me how many times?
[00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.775]  And Anderson Cooper is just a small example getting kicked in the shin.
[00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:02.319]  Absolutely not.
[00:23:19.306 --> 00:23:26.671]  Billy, I want to shift gears and talk about this more deeply because, and I use this analogy too much, I apologize, but it's so accurate, I use it.
[00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:29.213]  20 years ago you couldn't find organic food anywhere.
[00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:31.894]  It was very expensive if you could, because there was no market.
[00:23:32.175 --> 00:23:41.001]  As people began to demand it, it grew the market, prices went down, it's now displacing all the garbage, it's displacing the high fructose corn syrup, they're taking it out of Hershey's.
[00:23:41.761 --> 00:23:43.062]  We're taking it out of Hines.
[00:23:43.802 --> 00:23:46.684]  Now look, there's still some fake organic, there's still problems.
[00:23:47.005 --> 00:23:50.387]  The point is, we demanded quality, the market changed.
[00:23:50.767 --> 00:24:09.780]  And exactly, if people go out and support independent artists that are speaking out against tyranny, that's great music as well, and buy your album at smashingpumpkinsnexus.com, and then play it for friends, and then ask that it be played on the radio, or share it with their friends, that's how you bring the system down.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.381]  You've got to go further
[00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:14.523]  and decide you want to promote cultures of liberty.
[00:24:14.623 --> 00:24:26.452]  I can't tell you historically how many kings, how many corrupt dynasties were brought down by a jester telling jokes that became viral in ancient times or
[00:24:27.373 --> 00:24:39.886]  By the local band or even one guy with his, they didn't have guitars back then, you know, one guy with his little mandolin or whatever, singing songs about the corrupt nobility, that would change it.
[00:24:39.946 --> 00:24:47.615]  So a song or an idea that isn't in the hands of the system could bring them down and that's why they target people like you.
[00:24:49.342 --> 00:24:54.067]  Look, there was a reason the CIA was spying on John Lennon.
[00:24:55.429 --> 00:24:57.932]  At that point in time, he was probably the most dangerous artist in the world.
[00:25:01.215 --> 00:25:04.298]  Well, I can't speak to that, but I'll say this much.
[00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:07.402]  If you look at the power that rock and roll had,
[00:25:08.351 --> 00:25:16.553]  In the 70s, vis-a-vis the power that rock and roll has now, I think there's been a concerted effort to drain those systems of their power.
[00:25:17.473 --> 00:25:19.734]  Because it's just too radical, it's just too dangerous.
[00:25:20.874 --> 00:25:29.617]  And when you have the power of a John Lennon or a Bob Marley, and they can literally have one song that will change the consciousness of the world, and get people to look at something different.
[00:25:29.797 --> 00:25:33.598]  And I would point, and I'm saying this from a very specific point of view,
[00:25:34.756 --> 00:25:39.563]  Look at the lack of political music in the world right now and compare that to the 1960s.
[00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:46.212]  It is unbelievable the lack of political and social discourse in music right now.
[00:25:46.373 --> 00:25:48.175]  Do you think that's an accidental omission?
[00:25:49.764 --> 00:25:51.886]  They came in and they took it over on record.
[00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:54.329]  Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins fame is our guest.
[00:25:54.689 --> 00:25:56.711]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[00:25:56.971 --> 00:25:59.814]  We're going to send out a tweet of the website right now.
[00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:02.457]  We're going to post this video later today on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:26:02.877 --> 00:26:07.722]  It needs to go viral because he has a lot of courage saying what he's saying because they really come after people.
[00:26:07.762 --> 00:26:10.726]  I got to be very careful here what I'm going to say about John Lennon.
[00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:19.871]  But they made a film six, seven years ago that won a bunch of awards that had the declassified documents where Strom Thurmond, the senator, and others said, we want him taken out.
[00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.834]  We know the suspicious way he was killed.
[00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:24.057]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:44.434]  I've talked to the highest level people and been told stuff about what really went on and then what happened to them afterwards and everything and I can tell you the FBI and the CIA killed John Lennon and then they went on a campaign to cover up what they did with their Patsy and so that's why when we talk about this folks it's very dangerous.
[00:26:44.954 --> 00:26:52.619]  I mean so so we're not saying hey we're heroes here we're just saying realize this isn't just your regular you know shucking jive on CNN.
[00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:54.260]  I mean we're really laying it out here.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.269]  I think what's kind of funny about modern life is I don't think they have to kill you anymore.
[00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:02.093]  I think they just digitally kill you.
[00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:02.594]  That's right.
[00:27:02.634 --> 00:27:06.642]  I mean, if anything, you're almost better as a sort of living effigy.
[00:27:07.426 --> 00:27:11.550]  Which is why I think some of these people come out of the woodwork to try to, like, split my throat.
[00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.072]  I mean, criticize me as an artist, that's fine.
[00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.193]  There's plenty to criticize.
[00:27:15.553 --> 00:27:29.506]  But if you look at a lot of the subtext of the things that are written about an artist like me, it has a lot of, a lot of times, it's a lot of sort of false narratives, moral equivalencies that have nothing to do with music or art or love or people's lives.
[00:27:30.242 --> 00:27:30.843]  You just said it.
[00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:31.383]  You just said it.
[00:27:31.744 --> 00:27:38.050]  They create straw men that aren't Alex Jones or Billy Corgan and then they attribute things we didn't say.
[00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.811]  They have these campaigns.
[00:27:39.831 --> 00:27:42.334]  They send out fake emails that aren't from me, insulting people.
[00:27:42.654 --> 00:27:45.697]  They call people up and say it's me and insult them, famous people.
[00:27:46.378 --> 00:27:48.099]  They spoof faxes.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:28:05.968]  And I know it's the government corporation, so believe me, what Billy's talking about, it goes on here all the time in an attempt to derail us, but it's not going to work because Billy Corgan and Alex Jones are just little bitty expressions like a compound eye of a dragonfly.
[00:28:06.008 --> 00:28:07.629]  We're just one little tiny part of it.
[00:28:07.869 --> 00:28:09.830]  You can't chop off all the heads.
[00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.850]  Totally agree with you.
[00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:19.432]  And one thing I would add to that, because I know sometimes when I talk like this to people, they think, well, are you saying that everyone who works at the local paper is... No.
[00:28:19.892 --> 00:28:27.953]  It's these systems are put in place, and then they go out and they find people who are not free thinkers to basically implement the program.
[00:28:28.913 --> 00:28:31.154]  They regurgitate the national story.
[00:28:31.374 --> 00:28:36.895]  They're already the little sycophantic type that'll go with whatever the mindless pop culture narrative is.
[00:28:37.697 --> 00:28:44.499]  Absolutely, and I've even had off-record conversations, like I know you have, where people have admitted to me where they've had stories squashed.
[00:28:45.079 --> 00:28:45.659]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:50.600]  You know, somebody makes a juice call and makes sure a story is squashed or a particular agenda is promoted.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:59.743]  So, when you're looking at, you know, your local media and you go, well, this smells like propaganda, know that more than likely that person is not conscious.
[00:29:00.503 --> 00:29:04.644]  They've been put in that position because they're a proven bootlicker.
[00:29:05.882 --> 00:29:09.889]  Almost all local news is written in New York or L.A.
[00:29:09.969 --> 00:29:10.510]  or D.C.
[00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.653]  This is on record and packaged and sent.
[00:29:12.894 --> 00:29:16.199]  You tell them a local story and then they send down what you say.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.844]  Or it's read off a teleprompter if it's a national story.
[00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:25.028]  Right, so if there's a man in a high castle somewhere, you know, there's not a lot of them.
[00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:30.913]  But they're able to, through their control and their media control, sort of manipulate the storyline.
[00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:35.097]  We, look, your listers know, and I'm a lister, you know, we know.
[00:29:35.577 --> 00:29:42.803]  These things are, I mean, we sit back, look, when Ferguson started to boil over and you had Jakari and
[00:29:43.864 --> 00:29:54.789]  You know, I was watching some of the coverage, and it's really interesting, you know, because, and it's so important that you do that, because you're giving us the real on-the-street perspective as opposed to the propaganda perspective.
[00:29:54.809 --> 00:29:56.210]  Billy Corgan, stay there!
[00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.410]  Come back and finish up with that thought.
[00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.271]  Let's talk about the record.
[00:29:58.771 --> 00:29:59.671]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.172 --> 00:30:01.772]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.693 --> 00:30:05.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:20.707]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.

[00:30:39.698 --> 00:30:43.722]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:30:44.022 --> 00:30:53.310]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality of Vitamin B12.
[00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:54.010]  Secret 12.

[00:33:21.092 --> 00:33:23.258]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:28.873]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:57.935 --> 00:34:00.477]  That's one and all, and you can hear Tommy Lee on the drums.
[00:34:01.577 --> 00:34:07.081]  The new album available right now at the SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com website.
[00:34:07.241 --> 00:34:10.142]  We're going to send a tweet out to that website right now.
[00:34:10.162 --> 00:34:12.024]  I want to see everybody go there and buy the album.
[00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:18.768]  Because believe me, they have targeted Billy and his organization because of him speaking out on a whole bunch of issues.
[00:34:18.808 --> 00:34:20.389]  They don't like what they call loose cannons.
[00:34:21.383 --> 00:34:24.886]  They want people that will submit and go along with their whole agenda.
[00:34:25.146 --> 00:34:30.230]  Billy, I want to thank you for the gift of my Bohemian Grove security shirt and real badge.
[00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.732]  I mean, real shoulder patch.
[00:34:34.793 --> 00:34:37.455]  When I wear that out, people say, who in the world do you work for?
[00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:40.798]  Yeah, it's great.
[00:34:40.818 --> 00:34:47.903]  I found that somewhere outside of San Francisco and it was like sitting on a shelf and I thought, oh my God, I got to get this for Alex.
[00:34:48.676 --> 00:34:49.377]  That is awesome.
[00:34:49.417 --> 00:34:55.540]  Billy, I want to get back into what you said about Ferguson and more on the album before you have to leave us in that airport you're sitting in right now.
[00:34:56.141 --> 00:34:59.883]  But Tommy Lee, I had heard from folks that he was awake.
[00:35:00.844 --> 00:35:05.387]  I had heard from somebody that worked with him on a TV show behind the scenes that he was all aware of the New World Order.
[00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:08.869]  I know you don't want to speak for him personally, but can you repeat what you told me during the break?
[00:35:10.205 --> 00:35:12.446]  No, Tommy's eyes are wide open.
[00:35:12.966 --> 00:35:17.307]  And you talked a lot of artists off-record, and you and I have talked about that.
[00:35:17.567 --> 00:35:25.070]  I think the general public would be shocked how much of the entertainment world is awake, and it's because they're behind the wizard's curtain.
[00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.070]  Joe Perry's fully awake.
[00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.151]  Joe Perry's fully awake.
[00:35:28.231 --> 00:35:31.412]  I don't need to call him today, but a lot of folks are.
[00:35:31.892 --> 00:35:32.132]  Go ahead.
[00:35:33.226 --> 00:35:41.071]  Yeah, I think the difficulty is these paradigms have been set up where it's like, you know, you have to stare down the barrel of a particular gun, in this case, your career.
[00:35:42.052 --> 00:35:43.833]  Like I said, I mean, what's the new paradigm?
[00:35:43.873 --> 00:35:47.315]  You're going to get digitally assassinated, you know what I mean?
[00:35:47.595 --> 00:35:56.781]  I know there would be some people, particularly in the rock and roll world, that would roll their eyes at these kind of assertions, but there's a reason that the great artists get marginalized.
[00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:00.003]  They get sucked into things that have nothing to do with their music.
[00:36:00.704 --> 00:36:04.122]  You know, literally everything I say now is trolled for quotes.
[00:36:04.813 --> 00:36:06.714]  You know, and I'm not saying it's all political.
[00:36:06.754 --> 00:36:08.054]  Some of it's just dumb stuff.
[00:36:08.595 --> 00:36:13.237]  But the fact of the matter is this whole business has risen up around entertainment.
[00:36:13.257 --> 00:36:14.157]  It's a big business.
[00:36:14.597 --> 00:36:18.739]  But it ultimately is about the disenfranchising of the artist's vote in the culture.
[00:36:19.099 --> 00:36:22.441]  In that sense, the constant message is artists' voices don't matter.
[00:36:22.461 --> 00:36:31.685]  When you look at what a Jimi Hendrix represented as opposed to your normal average politician, okay, you tell me who's the more honorable person.
[00:36:32.927 --> 00:36:41.189]  Well, it's obviously Jimi Hendrix following his soul, his heart, trailblazing, creating a heavy rock, heavy metal, and a true pioneer.
[00:36:42.629 --> 00:37:01.973]  Right, and so that's what I'm trying to say, is from cradle to grave, you know, there are systems in place, you know, you pick them, you know, now it's Common Core, you know, the scholarship programs, all this, they're meant to take anybody who's too bright, too smart, and make sure they're corralled into a system from the get-go.
[00:37:02.794 --> 00:37:05.736]  And God forbid you exist outside that system.
[00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:10.939]  And Prosper, you and I have, and bless the Lord for the gifts He's given us.
[00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:17.343]  And I think both of us, and I know we've talked about this, we feel a great responsibility to turn those gifts around to serve others.
[00:37:17.403 --> 00:37:19.604]  And if it kills us, it kills us.
[00:37:19.644 --> 00:37:20.485]  But at the end of the day,
[00:37:21.265 --> 00:37:24.309]  We've got to trust the man upstairs.
[00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.173]  There's a greater purpose here at play.
[00:37:29.495 --> 00:37:38.065]  What we watched on the old systems, the old mainstream media systems, if that's true, I don't want to live in that world anyway.
[00:37:39.434 --> 00:37:40.415]  That's beautifully said.
[00:37:40.435 --> 00:37:43.236]  I don't want to live in that world anyway, because it is a fraud.
[00:37:43.296 --> 00:37:43.877]  It is a lie.
[00:37:44.477 --> 00:37:45.838]  I feel so empowered.
[00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:47.719]  Not that I have all the answers.
[00:37:47.759 --> 00:37:48.519]  I make a lot of mistakes.
[00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:49.820]  I say stupid stuff sometimes.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.862]  I mean, I hear my show rebroadcast and go, oh my God, that sounds horrible.
[00:37:52.882 --> 00:37:53.502]  I don't mean that.
[00:37:54.043 --> 00:37:55.924]  But at the same time, my heart's true.
[00:37:56.304 --> 00:37:57.585]  I'm trying to tell the truth.
[00:37:57.645 --> 00:38:02.107]  And more of what I say turns out to be accurate than what dinosaur media says.
[00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:03.448]  And it resonates with people.
[00:38:03.888 --> 00:38:05.489]  And then I just don't want to let them down.
[00:38:05.529 --> 00:38:06.310]  It's humbling.
[00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.154]  To know there's so many good people that are awake now and looking for me for leadership or whoever.
[00:38:11.435 --> 00:38:12.856]  I don't think that's where the leadership is.
[00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:22.004]  It's in our hearts, it's in our souls, it's in following our gut, it's in doing the right thing, and it's in doing the opposite of what mainstream dinosaur media says.
[00:38:22.665 --> 00:38:23.626]  I want to ask you about this.
[00:38:24.006 --> 00:38:31.812]  Where do you and your gut, Billy, as you said, the world's on fire, the previous album, where do you and your gut think civilization's really going?
[00:38:31.932 --> 00:38:32.993]  Are we going to survive?
[00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:35.434]  Will we make it to the next renaissance and beyond?
[00:38:35.454 --> 00:38:37.996]  And what do you think that fight's going to look like?
[00:38:39.638 --> 00:38:42.860]  You know, I hold my breath on that one.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.422]  You know, there's a big fight coming.
[00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:53.337]  Uh, you know, it's one thing to listen to you talk about FEMA documents and, uh, you know, uh, executive orders that we don't know about.
[00:38:53.537 --> 00:39:01.248]  And, uh, yesterday I think you had on your site about, uh, this idea that it's now legal to spy on everyone everywhere for the end of time and all this kind of stuff.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.883]  Um, you know, these systems are going to double and triple down, um, because, because they have no, uh, alternate plan.
[00:39:08.943 --> 00:39:09.583]  Do you understand?
[00:39:09.603 --> 00:39:12.244]  Uh, they've been in power for a very long time.
[00:39:12.544 --> 00:39:20.447]  And, uh, whoever's pulling those levers, uh, is, is they're not, uh, they're not, you know, when a baseball team loses, they go, Oh, we'll come back next year.
[00:39:20.487 --> 00:39:20.987]  We'll rebuild.
[00:39:21.227 --> 00:39:22.388]  No, these guys are in it to win.
[00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:34.925]  Um, and, uh, and you know, sometimes when I'm sitting around a table and, uh, and your name comes up, or I should say some things that I've learned through you and through other people, um, they get into like kind of games about accuracy.
[00:39:35.125 --> 00:39:36.647]  Like, well, how can you know that that's true?
[00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:41.106]  And all I gotta say again and again is like, look, come on, something's off here.
[00:39:41.447 --> 00:39:42.027]  Something's wrong.
[00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:44.729]  And people like you, people like me, we don't have to be accurate.
[00:39:45.429 --> 00:39:46.430]  That's not our job.
[00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.931]  Our job is not to be perfect.
[00:39:48.111 --> 00:39:50.072]  We don't hold ourselves up to be perfect.
[00:39:50.112 --> 00:39:54.875]  We don't hold ourselves up to be, you know, bookkeepers or tooth killers or something like that.
[00:39:55.115 --> 00:40:00.039]  We're just pointing, as you often say, you know, you're just pointing and saying, do you see that big thing that's coming down the road?
[00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:00.379]  I do.
[00:40:01.354 --> 00:40:01.794]  Exactly.
[00:40:01.814 --> 00:40:03.335]  And they say, well, what exactly is it?
[00:40:03.555 --> 00:40:08.996]  How do we know your eyes are authorized to say that's a juggernaut with fire shooting out of it, out of Road Warrior?
[00:40:09.336 --> 00:40:11.457]  And I'm like, well, I came by another village.
[00:40:11.477 --> 00:40:13.698]  They said something that looked like that blew it up.
[00:40:14.978 --> 00:40:16.298]  So that thing looks scary.
[00:40:16.338 --> 00:40:17.299]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:40:18.759 --> 00:40:18.999]  Yeah.
[00:40:19.819 --> 00:40:22.400]  And again, I would recommend anybody the same thing.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.201]  We don't, we, I'm sorry, you know, the collective world, it's awake.
[00:40:26.501 --> 00:40:28.222]  You know, it's extended even beyond your audience.
[00:40:28.921 --> 00:40:30.384]  We don't have to be right.
[00:40:30.604 --> 00:40:31.766]  We don't have to be accurate.
[00:40:31.907 --> 00:40:32.989]  We know what wrong is.
[00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:36.536]  We know what wrong is, and we know a lot of what's going on is wrong.
[00:40:37.606 --> 00:40:52.253]  Well sure, they have this fake moral authority where accuracy in media, or where media matters, remember the White House, or where they have that truth detector site, or Snopes, run by a couple in an apartment.
[00:40:52.353 --> 00:41:02.098]  They sit on the mountain and they say what reality is, and anybody that starts telling you they have a corner on reality, well that's who you really got to watch.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:11.642]  If we reach a point as a race where we do not grieve the loss of every child, I don't care what color, I don't care where they're from.
[00:41:11.662 --> 00:41:13.283]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:13.323 --> 00:41:16.324]  If we don't grieve the loss of every child, that's an indictment of us.
[00:41:17.824 --> 00:41:21.185]  And we've got to be protesting for every child, every situation.
[00:41:21.205 --> 00:41:25.626]  We need to have moral outrage where there's injustice everywhere.
[00:41:27.206 --> 00:41:31.748]  And then when we see agendas at play, we have to step back and say, why is this more important than everything else?
[00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.533]  We have to grieve for all of these things.
[00:41:35.573 --> 00:41:37.115]  We have to grieve for the GMOs.
[00:41:37.135 --> 00:41:38.597]  We have to grieve for the chemtrails.
[00:41:38.617 --> 00:41:41.640]  We have to grieve for all this crap that we have to face down.
[00:41:42.522 --> 00:41:43.723]  And we have to pull together.
[00:41:43.783 --> 00:41:44.144]  That's what I mean.
[00:41:44.164 --> 00:41:45.105]  We don't have to be right.
[00:41:45.885 --> 00:41:46.726]  We don't have to be right.
[00:41:46.766 --> 00:41:47.546]  We just have to know.
[00:41:47.846 --> 00:41:49.247]  As long as we know that's the power.
[00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:56.252]  And I'm blessed to be one voice in the wilderness, at least a free thinker.
[00:41:57.073 --> 00:42:04.838]  There are times where it's very difficult in a musical life to struggle where, you know, the numbers don't add up and you don't get the advantage that you think you should get and all these things.
[00:42:05.258 --> 00:42:07.920]  And those are those hard days where you've got to stare in the mirror and say,
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:14.422]  Would I rather be on my knees, subjugated to some system that would ask me to be a robot, muffin, something?
[00:42:14.762 --> 00:42:16.062]  Or would I rather be a free thinker?
[00:42:16.082 --> 00:42:17.703]  And that's what I would say.
[00:42:17.863 --> 00:42:18.903]  I'm proud to be a free thinker.
[00:42:18.943 --> 00:42:23.724]  And if that means what it means, you know, a half full haul somewhere, that's what it means.
[00:42:23.824 --> 00:42:25.545]  Because I can't go down any other way.
[00:42:25.805 --> 00:42:27.986]  Well, you know my favorite quote by Mark Twain.
[00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:28.966]  He had a lot of great ones.
[00:42:29.407 --> 00:42:32.548]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:35.409]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him.
[00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:37.370]  Then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.931]  I was on over a hundred radio stations.
[00:42:39.971 --> 00:42:46.854]  It was just unheard of when I was like, you know, 26, 27 years old and 9-11 happened.
[00:42:47.634 --> 00:42:48.695]  And it was just unheard of.
[00:42:49.730 --> 00:43:00.614]  And I was on 100 stations, small mom-and-pops, some of them, but high ratings, and I was growing, and then the towers got blown up, and I said, no, the government's clearly involved, and those stations all called, most of them.
[00:43:00.634 --> 00:43:09.057]  They said, we're going to turn you off next week, or we're going to turn you off next month on the contracts, up using monthly contracts, if you don't stop it right now.
[00:43:09.277 --> 00:43:09.797]  And you know what?
[00:43:09.977 --> 00:43:11.098]  I didn't feel bad at all.
[00:43:11.892 --> 00:43:14.513]  When Ted Anderson came in, he said, all these stations are turning you off.
[00:43:14.533 --> 00:43:15.553]  You just lost 10 today.
[00:43:16.754 --> 00:43:18.334]  They're warning you, you gotta stop now.
[00:43:19.175 --> 00:43:20.855]  And I said, Ted, I just can't stop.
[00:43:20.935 --> 00:43:21.616]  And it's the truth.
[00:43:21.976 --> 00:43:23.216]  And he said, I really respect that.
[00:43:23.796 --> 00:43:24.517]  Alex, he goes, fine.
[00:43:24.717 --> 00:43:26.217]  You have a place here on the network.
[00:43:27.118 --> 00:43:32.820]  We're going to lose, at the network at that time, millions of dollars over the years.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.320]  And back then, I was making hardly any money.
[00:43:34.981 --> 00:43:37.562]  And he said, you would get that.
[00:43:37.602 --> 00:43:38.422]  But he goes, I respect that.
[00:43:39.222 --> 00:43:41.103]  And he goes, so I'll lose millions, you're going to lose millions.
[00:43:41.624 --> 00:43:42.985]  Because I just hit the zeitgeist.
[00:43:43.025 --> 00:43:44.666]  I had just gone from like 20 stations to over 100.
[00:43:45.326 --> 00:43:46.968]  It was boom, spreading all over the country.
[00:43:47.428 --> 00:43:48.589]  It was hardcore libertarian.
[00:43:48.609 --> 00:43:49.569]  The right-wingers liked it.
[00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.892]  But I came out and spoke bad about their god, George Bush.
[00:43:53.492 --> 00:43:55.253]  And I didn't even say he did it all.
[00:43:55.293 --> 00:43:57.595]  I just said, look, the government's running al-Qaeda.
[00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:58.716]  They let them attack us bare minimum.
[00:43:59.276 --> 00:44:09.079]  And I'm proud of that and it's just like I'm proud of what you've done, but then I only got bigger down the road, but then it only gets scarier because then it's not even about being on the air or being famous.
[00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:13.581]  It is all about the struggle for reality and trying to find that truth.
[00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:14.461]  I think that's what you're saying.
[00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:16.321]  It's not that we're perfect or always right.
[00:44:16.602 --> 00:44:19.282]  We want the truth and we have goodwill towards others.
[00:44:19.302 --> 00:44:23.844]  I think we're talking about the philosophy of those of us that want to be free.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:31.162]  Well, I think it goes back to your question of what do I think is going to happen, and this is where it gets into a very tricky juncture.
[00:44:32.663 --> 00:44:38.665]  We have to see what's happening, but at the same time we have to be able to kind of step back and look at the larger narrative at play.
[00:44:40.085 --> 00:44:44.627]  If there are nefarious forces in the world, they are willing to use our humanity against us.
[00:44:44.747 --> 00:44:46.708]  They are basically sociopathic.
[00:44:46.728 --> 00:44:50.429]  They don't care that babies die somewhere in the middle of some desert.
[00:44:51.474 --> 00:44:56.437]  They don't care, you know, that the kids are taking vaccines with the horrible things in them.
[00:44:57.278 --> 00:44:59.339]  They don't care about the rise in autism rate.
[00:44:59.379 --> 00:45:00.800]  They're willing to do whatever, however.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.301]  I mean, they've proven that again and again and again.
[00:45:03.882 --> 00:45:08.104]  So this is where we cannot get sucked into these false moral arguments.
[00:45:08.464 --> 00:45:10.085]  Those arguments are important.
[00:45:10.586 --> 00:45:15.669]  You know, like in talking recently about some of the things that have gone on, the protests that are happening post
[00:45:17.129 --> 00:45:19.512]  Uh, is it Mr. Garner with the man's name that was choked?
[00:45:19.652 --> 00:45:19.752]  Yes.
[00:45:19.772 --> 00:45:19.992]  Terrible.
[00:45:20.212 --> 00:45:24.036]  Uh, and then the horrible situation and then what obviously what happened in Ferguson.
[00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:32.184]  And you know, you get these discussions, like I said, around the dinner table and people think that you're, uh, unsentimental or unfeeling and no, it's no, these are horrible.
[00:45:32.444 --> 00:45:35.247]  Of course there's injustice, uh, in the inner cities.
[00:45:35.307 --> 00:45:35.747]  Of course.
[00:45:36.288 --> 00:45:38.370]  Uh, you know, does that mean every cop's the bad guy?
[00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:39.211]  You say it all the time.
[00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:40.860]  I know lots of great cops.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.681]  I know lots of great cops who are family people that would never do these things.
[00:45:43.721 --> 00:45:45.282]  Does that mean every cop's good or bad?
[00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:45.602]  No.
[00:45:45.802 --> 00:45:48.084]  We have to judge every person on their moral character.
[00:45:49.785 --> 00:45:54.547]  I'm, you know, somewhat friendly with the police chief of the Chicago Police Department, Gary McCarthy.
[00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:55.448]  Incredible man.
[00:45:56.204 --> 00:45:56.785]  Incredible man.
[00:45:56.865 --> 00:46:03.050]  I watch where he grieves over every situation because he's a man.
[00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:03.750]  He's a father.
[00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.591]  He cares.
[00:46:05.772 --> 00:46:07.814]  Just because he puts on the uniform doesn't mean he's a bad guy.
[00:46:08.094 --> 00:46:10.016]  I mean, what about our soldiers?
[00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:11.497]  Are all our soldiers bad?
[00:46:11.577 --> 00:46:12.017]  Absolutely not.
[00:46:12.057 --> 00:46:13.438]  This narrative that's spun out all of a sudden.
[00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:14.940]  All of a sudden we've got to be afraid of the soldiers.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.322]  I'll take a soldier over anybody, any day.
[00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:32.958]  Exactly, they've tried to dumb it down to the opposite of what Martin Luther King said, judge people on their deeds and what they stand for, what you just said, and then if you don't support all the rioting or whatever, you support the First Amendment but not rioting, then you're bad.
[00:46:33.378 --> 00:46:37.981]  If you don't say kill the cops randomly, well I don't want to be killed randomly, I don't want to be...
[00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:41.643]  I don't want to see blacks killed just because they're black or whites killed.
[00:46:41.663 --> 00:46:45.225]  I mean, it just comes down to civilization and basic common sense.
[00:46:45.265 --> 00:46:47.287]  Now, Billy, let's talk about your album.
[00:46:48.007 --> 00:46:53.111]  We just downloaded it the other day from your site, SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:54.812]  I can't wait to listen to the whole thing.
[00:46:55.072 --> 00:46:55.953]  I'm not just saying this.
[00:46:55.993 --> 00:46:58.374]  I love all your albums and I really love your old stuff.
[00:46:58.634 --> 00:47:01.516]  This has a lot of the old sound, but even better lyrics.
[00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:04.318]  I think this is almost like classic Smashing Pumpkins 2.0.
[00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:06.720]  Everybody should go there.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.301]  How do people get the record?
[00:47:09.714 --> 00:47:12.996]  You know, it's on all the typical Illuminati systems.
[00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:16.779]  It's easy to find, that's not the issue.
[00:47:16.999 --> 00:47:18.260]  But thank you so much for that.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.263]  Sure, I mean, it's in the stores, it's on CD, it's downloaded at iTunes.
[00:47:22.563 --> 00:47:25.285]  Folks can go find those links at smashingpumpkinsnexus.com.
[00:47:25.605 --> 00:47:26.826]  How do people support you?
[00:47:26.846 --> 00:47:29.868]  I guess they come to the big shows, they spread the word.
[00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:31.450]  I mean, how do they do that?
[00:47:32.665 --> 00:47:38.969]  You know, that's a difficult one because there is the commerce, which is important.
[00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:40.890]  But honestly, it's more the street caching.
[00:47:42.691 --> 00:47:49.595]  And that's what I'm saying is, if not me, please find artists that you support, retweet them, share them with your friends.
[00:47:49.975 --> 00:47:51.816]  The artists are the bulwark.
[00:47:53.072 --> 00:47:56.495]  Uh, there's a reason most totalitarian regimes kill the artists second.
[00:47:56.795 --> 00:47:57.216]  Of course.
[00:47:57.956 --> 00:48:03.041]  They kill the weakest first and then they go after the strongest, which are the artists, because they are the X Factor.
[00:48:03.601 --> 00:48:06.304]  They're the voice in the wilderness that can point out the obvious.
[00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:09.220]  Like, hey, look at that over there.
[00:48:09.801 --> 00:48:11.662]  You know, and they can do it in a very clever way.
[00:48:12.182 --> 00:48:14.544]  You know, if Jesus spoke in parables, so can we.
[00:48:14.564 --> 00:48:17.186]  And it's very powerful.
[00:48:17.246 --> 00:48:24.771]  Music, as you know, penetrates like, you know, typical stuff, which is why I'm able to go to countries where people don't even speak English and play music and communicate.
[00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:26.072]  It's music of the heart.
[00:48:27.252 --> 00:48:32.596]  And I'm blessed to, you know, 25 plus years here and going still strong, stronger than ever.
[00:48:32.836 --> 00:48:33.776]  Billy Corgan's our guest.
[00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:35.577]  SmashingPumpkinsNexus.com.
[00:48:35.918 --> 00:48:36.538]  Retweet that.
[00:48:36.558 --> 00:48:37.738]  Put it on Facebook, folks.
[00:48:38.059 --> 00:48:39.319]  The establishment's scared of him.
[00:48:39.639 --> 00:48:43.481]  And anybody the system's scared of, you better know we need to get behind.
[00:48:43.821 --> 00:48:45.802]  Because they promote terrorist groups.
[00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:46.883]  They fund Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:47.263 --> 00:48:49.064]  They fund all these radical groups.
[00:48:49.084 --> 00:48:50.625]  They get caught funding the Klan.
[00:48:50.905 --> 00:48:53.006]  They get caught funding radical racist black groups.
[00:48:53.326 --> 00:48:57.348]  They want us all killing each other, just like one of the singers
[00:48:58.068 --> 00:49:07.050]  That you know he just mentioned from Jamaica said they want to see us go on killing one another top ranking And that's of course Bob Marley.
[00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:21.774]  We're almost out of time I'm gonna let you go so you can get that plane or get on down the road Billy I hope you'll come down to Austin soon and come in studio Maybe I'll come up see you in Chicago, but I really know your interviews here resonate with everybody Again one more time the new album.
[00:49:21.814 --> 00:49:25.775]  Tell us what the name of the album means monuments to an elegy.
[00:49:25.795 --> 00:49:26.335]  What's that mean?
[00:49:27.412 --> 00:49:28.192]  Oh, I don't know, Alex.
[00:49:28.972 --> 00:49:31.333]  These things come out of my brain sideways.
[00:49:31.933 --> 00:49:32.273]  I don't know.
[00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:33.173]  Well, sounds cool.
[00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:36.434]  I just wanted to do some inside baseball with that.
[00:49:36.534 --> 00:49:40.755]  You know, to me, it's a bit of a kind of a wave goodbye to what people thought the band was.
[00:49:40.875 --> 00:49:44.395]  And, you know, I'm just trying to move on into the future.
[00:49:44.475 --> 00:49:55.078]  And, you know, thankfully, with people like you, new media like you, creating these new systems, I'm able to speak freely and speak to an audience and just, you know, try to find like-minded souls.
[00:49:55.178 --> 00:49:56.618]  We have to build these new systems.
[00:49:56.658 --> 00:49:56.978]  You are.
[00:49:58.477 --> 00:50:00.198]  And I'm trying to do the same.
[00:50:00.338 --> 00:50:05.039]  You know, we have to build, basically, systems that are stronger than these systems of propaganda and control.
[00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:05.539]  And we will.
[00:50:05.639 --> 00:50:07.819]  We will survive and we will succeed.
[00:50:08.159 --> 00:50:21.962]  Well, it's happening and, you know, as you said, we need to support artists, whether it was in Nazi Germany or whether it was in any other totalitarian regime, Pol Pot, Kermit Rush, they would kill 95% of the artists, even ones that served them.
[00:50:22.222 --> 00:50:23.323]  They didn't like having them around.
[00:50:23.343 --> 00:50:25.523]  They were scared of them because that beauty, that
[00:50:25.643 --> 00:50:26.903]  Just God bless everyone.
[00:50:26.963 --> 00:50:27.483]  Just keep fighting.
[00:50:27.503 --> 00:50:28.084]  Keep the faith.
[00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:55.320]  I gotta say, the new album is amazing.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.081]  It sounds like old stuff you've done, but stuff I've never heard before.
[00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:05.104]  I mean, as you said, you've gone to the next level with the new album and a Monument to Elegy available.

[00:51:56.719 --> 00:52:11.269]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:16.393]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.653 --> 00:52:24.499]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.759 --> 00:52:29.081]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:52:29.281 --> 00:52:33.102]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.262 --> 00:52:38.985]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.205 --> 00:52:41.986]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.366 --> 00:52:47.508]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:47.728 --> 00:52:55.852]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:55.912 --> 00:52:56.192]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:52:56.232 --> 00:52:59.113]  Do business with someone who shares your values.

[00:53:08.217 --> 00:53:11.700]  Hey everyone, I'm having lots of fun with my new Ghost 80% AR-15.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.222]  This baby shoots like a dream.
[00:53:14.322 --> 00:53:15.343]  Hey, thanks Guns80.com.
[00:53:15.403 --> 00:53:19.206]  You know, friends ask me all the time why I wanted a Ghost AR-15.
[00:53:19.426 --> 00:53:20.587]  That's easy.
[00:53:20.927 --> 00:53:27.612]  You see, my buddy Mark kept telling me that I better go to Guns80.com to get myself a Ghost AR-15 before they outlawed them.
[00:53:28.173 --> 00:53:29.934]  I thought he was just paranoid, so I ignored it.
[00:53:29.994 --> 00:53:30.595]  Well, at first.
[00:53:31.195 --> 00:53:39.240]  But then I started hearing government media types talking about making guns illegal, about the president signing on to a UN treaty that could take my gun rights away.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.721]  You know, it really bugged me.
[00:53:40.781 --> 00:53:44.724]  So I dug in, I did the research, and I realized that Mark was right all along.
[00:53:45.564 --> 00:53:49.487]  I know now that having an unregistered Ghost AR-15 is the right answer.
[00:53:50.047 --> 00:53:52.709]  I'm a proud 80% Ghost AR-15 convert.
[00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:53.690]  You should be too.
[00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.331]  The answer is really simple.
[00:53:55.911 --> 00:53:58.852]  Get your Ghost AR-15 at Guns80.com.
[00:53:58.992 --> 00:54:01.073]  The big sale is on right now.
[00:54:01.213 --> 00:54:02.614]  Go to Guns80.com.
[00:54:02.634 --> 00:54:03.874]  That's Guns80.com.
[00:54:03.934 --> 00:54:05.195]  Guns 8-0.
[00:54:05.535 --> 00:54:07.276]  The number's 8-0.com.
[00:54:12.298 --> 00:54:13.978]  He looks like an angel.
[00:54:13.998 --> 00:54:15.179]  Talks like an angel.
[00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:17.780]  Walk like an angel.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.140]  Oh, it's walk.
[00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:19.941]  Sorry, Elvis.
[00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:23.862]  Talk like an angel.
[00:54:23.882 --> 00:54:25.363]  But I got
[00:54:29.153 --> 00:54:42.018]  My son, Rex, just the other day was like, Dad, I like it when you sing that Elvis song.
[00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:43.938]  It's pulling up on YouTube.
[00:54:43.998 --> 00:54:45.579]  So we sat there and sang the song together.
[00:54:45.599 --> 00:54:47.860]  I like Elvis.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.661]  Merry Christmas, Elvis!
[00:54:56.543 --> 00:55:09.120]  Walks like an angel Talks like an angel But I got wise You're the devil in disguise
[00:55:13.331 --> 00:55:16.313]  You can hear Jim Morrison, Glenn Danzig, all of them copying Elvis.
[00:55:16.353 --> 00:55:17.594]  Can't you hear it?
[00:55:17.634 --> 00:55:21.798]  Doesn't matter, I love it!
[00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:25.721]  Oh, let's stop it right there.
[00:55:25.961 --> 00:55:27.402]  I get in a goofy mood sometimes.
[00:55:27.422 --> 00:55:36.989]  I was telling Buckley earlier, I had one cup of coffee this morning, but I worked out for like an hour and a half doing deadlifts and heavyweight, and I remember why in high school I started doing that.
[00:55:37.089 --> 00:55:41.212]  I got addicted to lifting weights and got like really naturally buff.
[00:55:42.213 --> 00:55:46.094]  You get high off of full-body heavyweight.
[00:55:46.814 --> 00:55:49.094]  So I was doing some clings and some other stuff with my trainer.
[00:55:49.414 --> 00:55:52.275]  Patty Kay, who I know is listening, he went deer hunting today with his buddies.
[00:55:52.295 --> 00:55:56.396]  He said, I'm going to be listening on the app, driving out of the ranch, and I expect to be plugged.
[00:55:56.956 --> 00:55:57.536]  He actually didn't say that.
[00:55:57.556 --> 00:55:58.416]  He goes, I'll be listening.
[00:55:58.756 --> 00:55:59.756]  Wonder if I get a plug.
[00:55:59.776 --> 00:56:01.297]  I was not a plug.
[00:56:01.797 --> 00:56:04.197]  I'm kind of babbling here at the end of the show mindlessly.
[00:56:04.477 --> 00:56:06.738]  There's all this serious news, serious issues to cover.
[00:56:08.169 --> 00:56:12.274]  I will be back this Sunday, Lord willing, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:56:12.314 --> 00:56:13.415]  Central Standard Time.
[00:56:13.435 --> 00:56:17.801]  I want to thank David Knight for doing a great job yesterday with the transmission.
[00:56:18.782 --> 00:56:21.886]  Again, we've had family illnesses, family stuff the last year.
[00:56:22.246 --> 00:56:23.347]  When it rains, it pours.
[00:56:23.648 --> 00:56:27.032]  And if I miss any days next week, I'm not on vacation.
[00:56:28.822 --> 00:56:30.504]  I'm going to take off a few days around Christmas.
[00:56:31.184 --> 00:56:33.006]  But we'll probably, I'll probably be here next week.
[00:56:33.026 --> 00:56:34.267]  We're going to see into that.
[00:56:34.327 --> 00:56:36.088]  But there's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:56:36.668 --> 00:56:37.209]  Pray for us.
[00:56:37.489 --> 00:56:38.650]  Best of times, worst of times.
[00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:40.912]  We pray for you as well.
[00:56:41.692 --> 00:56:45.976]  Briefly, I want to just tell you we have the biggest sale ever on Xtube.
[00:56:46.676 --> 00:56:50.861]  You can get it $5 off and free shipping.
[00:56:51.441 --> 00:57:01.012]  So that's 17% off the regular price and free shipping on our most popular supplement, the Supernascent Deep Earth Crystal Source Iodine.
[00:57:01.493 --> 00:57:02.073]  And if you take it
[00:57:02.614 --> 00:57:03.856]  I mean, you've heard the right reviews.
[00:57:04.116 --> 00:57:05.858]  It really is a big deficiency of most people.
[00:57:06.259 --> 00:57:11.105]  And most folks can't absorb the other types of iodine that are bound to things from the research we've looked at.
[00:57:11.546 --> 00:57:13.408]  So that's Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:14.009 --> 00:57:20.377]  And it helps fund this operation that the system wants to shut down and is fighting greedily, tooth and nail to do so, and failing, by the grace of God.
[00:57:21.297 --> 00:57:22.958]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:57:23.619 --> 00:57:28.103]  If it is in the big universal combine, let that not happen.
[00:57:28.703 --> 00:57:33.007]  And expanding on that, we also have Oxy-Powder right now in supply.
[00:57:33.468 --> 00:57:37.131]  Discounted for the New Year's resolution to flush out your guts.
[00:57:37.251 --> 00:57:38.432]  Rob Dew lost 12 pounds.
[00:57:38.452 --> 00:57:39.593]  I was saying 18 pounds.
[00:57:39.613 --> 00:57:40.494]  That was somebody else in the office.
[00:57:41.134 --> 00:57:45.118]  12 pounds in one week, taking it, of just detritus that was in him.
[00:57:45.598 --> 00:57:48.881]  And it's good to boost your immune system, obviously, to have healthy upper and lower intestines.
[00:57:49.141 --> 00:57:56.364]  Of course, you could just have the CIA buy to rectally feed you in the new torture report, but this is kind of the opposite of that.
[00:57:57.084 --> 00:58:01.006]  This is flush your guts out without the help of a CIA pervert team.
[00:58:01.606 --> 00:58:09.289]  So I hate to have to get into this, but this is something that's really healthy and good for your body and is the most dramatic obvious product we have at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:58:10.149 --> 00:58:10.269]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:10.289 --> 00:58:10.369]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:10.389 --> 00:58:17.374]  And again, I want to thank you all as Christmas approaches and the holidays for everybody else for all your support and putting up with me.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:32.786]  Because we do have some magic moments here on air with our guests, our researchers, myself sometimes I'm quite poignant and bring up some really salient points.
[00:58:33.146 --> 00:58:38.850]  The rest of the time it sounds like a gibbering redneck turned up like a chipmunk or something.
[00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:41.192]  But that's what it comes down to.
[00:58:41.212 --> 00:58:43.894]  So we really appreciate you and love you and it's very, very humbling.
[00:58:43.914 --> 00:58:45.695]  All right, that's it for this transmission.
[00:58:45.735 --> 00:58:48.418]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.

[00:58:59.557 --> 00:59:03.058]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:03.219 --> 00:59:07.180]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.941]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:09.261 --> 00:59:16.844]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:21.313]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:21.974 --> 01:00:22.774]  You want answers?
[01:00:23.555 --> 01:00:24.455]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:25.096 --> 01:00:28.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:29.299 --> 01:00:33.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.871 --> 01:00:45.614]  We are now into the second hour.
[01:00:45.774 --> 01:00:47.957]  William Benny is joining us coming up.
[01:00:50.441 --> 01:00:55.748]  After the next break, former head of technology at the NSA.
[01:00:57.742 --> 01:01:02.445]  He was one of the directors of the NSA, and we're going to really do something special here.
[01:01:02.465 --> 01:01:05.766]  He doesn't do a lot of interviews, does like the London Guardian, things like that.
[01:01:06.187 --> 01:01:15.612]  He's been on with the Yours Truly twice, I think David Knight two or three other times, and he's going to come on and give us the latest on the Panopticon spy grid.
[01:01:17.353 --> 01:01:25.938]  He's going to come on and give us the latest on the police state, and we're going to open the phones up then at the bottom of the hour for your concise
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:33.144]  Focus please, question directly to the biggest NSA whistleblower out there, way beyond Snowden.
[01:01:34.384 --> 01:01:37.766]  They tried to indict him, they tried to set him up, they tried to put him in jail.
[01:01:38.647 --> 01:01:39.067]  They failed.
[01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:41.608]  And he has a lot of courage.
[01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:50.994]  William Binney, who has been called even by Nightline, the NSA's greatest codebreaker ever.
[01:01:53.146 --> 01:01:58.410]  So he, you know, they've got movies out about breaking the German Enigma Code and stuff.
[01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:59.250]  True stories.
[01:02:01.992 --> 01:02:03.733]  This is one of those type of guys, okay?
[01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.874]  I mean, this is the big brain guy.
[01:02:06.735 --> 01:02:08.296]  And he's moral.
[01:02:09.557 --> 01:02:10.517]  He's at the NSA.
[01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:12.519]  He learns they're illegally spying on the citizens.
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:19.203]  He resigns in 2002, shortly after 9-11.
[01:02:20.464 --> 01:02:21.625]  Keeps his mouth shut about it.
[01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:25.249]  Tries to work internally through the Congress.
[01:02:25.569 --> 01:02:26.150]  Never happens.
[01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.150]  Starts going public.
[01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.273]  So this is a big deal.
[01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:38.819]  I know it's not pearls before swine when we have folks of this magnitude on the broadcast.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.641]  This is a big, big deal.
[01:02:40.661 --> 01:02:44.084]  And in fact, guys, I want to get into some other issues.
[01:02:44.704 --> 01:02:48.107]  When you guys pulled me, I know it's somewhere in my stack, but I saw some more over the weekend.
[01:02:50.009 --> 01:02:54.192]  Where Google, Facebook, and others are spying on the public for the government.
[01:02:54.793 --> 01:03:02.839]  There was an article about the British NSA spying on just workers to stop workplace violence.
[01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:08.883]  Oh, we've got to spy on you all without warrants and violate the law so we stop any violence.
[01:03:08.923 --> 01:03:12.766]  See, oh, everyone must live in a glass house to stop the violence.
[01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:16.469]  GCHQ to snoop through office emails.
[01:03:19.485 --> 01:03:24.527]  And we'll go over all of this with William Benny coming up.
[01:03:24.627 --> 01:03:29.629]  And then, after he's gone, we'll have open phones yet again.
[01:03:29.729 --> 01:03:37.532]  And I want to ask the listeners, what do we do about the Republican Party and the former President Bush 1 and 2, 41 and 43?
[01:03:45.419 --> 01:03:48.362]  Running around saying how much they love Bill Clinton.
[01:03:49.082 --> 01:03:57.630]  This blue-blood Rockefeller Republican traipsing arrogantly in our faces when there's a political realignment.
[01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:01.173]  Can't we get rid of Jeb and Hillary in our political process?
[01:04:01.453 --> 01:04:02.894]  Do we have to look at them forever?
[01:04:04.576 --> 01:04:11.502]  Do we always have to have these people hanging on and now they've got their kids all getting ready to run for office or winning office?
[01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:13.618]  Just dynasties?
[01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:29.265]  That's what North Korea is, is an imperial, hermit, monarchy, with a toddling, soft, third-generation maggot, feeding on tens of millions of people, quite literally.
[01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:35.673]  So disconnected from reality, thinks he's cool with Dennis Rodman visiting.
[01:04:36.353 --> 01:04:40.857]  This is the madness of turning government over to centralized systems.
[01:04:41.638 --> 01:04:44.940]  It is anathema to a free and open society.
[01:04:46.461 --> 01:04:46.862]  Truly.
[01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:47.942]  Truly.
[01:04:49.704 --> 01:04:50.745]  A pox on us all.
[01:04:51.658 --> 01:04:52.419]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.682]  You can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[01:04:55.263 --> 01:04:57.326]  See our Facebook and more at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:57.887 --> 01:04:59.569]  Please remember, they want this shut down.
[01:04:59.609 --> 01:05:00.510]  Don't take it for granted.
[01:05:00.891 --> 01:05:01.752]  Keep spreading the word.
[01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:03.234]  That's why we're reaching more people every day.
[01:05:03.254 --> 01:05:05.077]  And I want to salute and thank you all.
[01:05:05.497 --> 01:05:05.878]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.608 --> 01:05:13.109]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:17.230]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:17.551 --> 01:05:18.991]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:26.893]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:28.034]  But for how long?
[01:05:28.314 --> 01:05:30.315]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:34.576]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:05:34.956 --> 01:05:36.136]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:05:36.817 --> 01:05:37.777]  Just won't quit.
[01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:43.217]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:50.241]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:05:50.342 --> 01:05:59.367]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:04.570]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:16.547]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:06:16.747 --> 01:06:20.570]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:26.815]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with Oxy Powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:06:27.155 --> 01:06:32.980]  Using super oxygenation, Oxy Powder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:41.065]  While you sleep with easy capsules, tens of thousands of individuals have used oxy powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:46.788]  Even InfoWars nightly news director Rob Dew has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[01:06:47.108 --> 01:06:49.450]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:51.451]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:52.092]  I'd say a week.
[01:06:52.252 --> 01:06:52.692]  Seven days.
[01:06:53.813 --> 01:06:54.874]  2015 can be different.
[01:06:54.974 --> 01:06:57.938]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:06:58.198 --> 01:07:00.020]  Oxy Powder flushes it out.
[01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.144]  Secure your Oxy Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:03.404 --> 01:07:05.267]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:07:09.211 --> 01:07:20.358]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
[01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:28.543]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean Vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed.
[01:07:28.763 --> 01:07:34.365]  ...over the last two years, and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:37.647]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:37.907 --> 01:07:39.087]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:39.327 --> 01:07:43.349]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:07:43.669 --> 01:07:52.833]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true, nutraceutical-quality Vitamin B12.
[01:07:53.293 --> 01:07:53.633]  Secret 12.
[01:07:54.353 --> 01:07:56.234]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift.
[01:07:56.514 --> 01:08:00.415]  And because early voting runs through this Friday, you don't have to wait until Election Day.
[01:08:00.435 --> 01:08:01.216]  You can vote all week!
[01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:29.724]  The Rio Riva County Clerk's Office reported this afternoon that a voter trying to cast an early ballot in Española today was told he had already voted three days prior.
[01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:38.991]  Activist on the tape goes on to suggest that discarded ballots could be collected from what she called Ghetto Aurora, saying that African Americans and Mexicans tend to throw out their ballots.
[01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:44.218]  And as for those programs we do need, I'll make them work better and I'll make them cost less.
[01:08:44.338 --> 01:08:52.591]  Thousands of federal workers are issued taxpayer-funded credit cards so long as they buy items that cost less than $3,000 or micro-purchases.
[01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:53.933]  Our review found about $20 billion.
[01:08:56.636 --> 01:09:02.401]  We'll save billions by cutting waste and improving management and strengthening oversight.
[01:09:02.701 --> 01:09:06.424]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in D.C.
[01:09:06.464 --> 01:09:10.428]  for their micro-purchase shopping lists and all refused.
[01:09:10.628 --> 01:09:16.333]  I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office.
[01:09:16.673 --> 01:09:23.299]  The Independent Congressional Budget Office warning a new fiscal crisis is coming if Washington doesn't get its spending in check.
[01:09:23.539 --> 01:09:28.750]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[01:09:29.111 --> 01:09:31.696]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:09:32.718 --> 01:09:34.221]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:48.563 --> 01:09:51.464]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:09:52.384 --> 01:09:56.366]  First, Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[01:09:56.706 --> 01:10:01.508]  Ebola is capable of entering human airway cells.
[01:10:01.908 --> 01:10:07.310]  Ebola is primed to be able to have respiratory transmission.
[01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:10.552]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:10:11.152 --> 01:10:12.492]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:13.073 --> 01:10:16.094]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:10:25.089 --> 01:10:39.765]  William Binney, he's just four miles from Fort Meade, headquarters of the NSA, where he was the technical leader and director for intelligence with the NSA, before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency, Binney.
[01:10:40.626 --> 01:10:46.188]  It's been described as one of the most prolific and best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:57.513]  Benny continues to speak out about the NSA's illegal data collection policies and continues interviews in the media regarding his experiences and communications intercepts by government agencies of American citizens.
[01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:05.677]  In a legal case, Benny has testified in an affidavit that the NSA is in deliberate violation of the US Constitution.
[01:11:06.377 --> 01:11:17.664]  ExposedFacts.org, Whistleblower.org, and he's part of the government accountability movement, and we really appreciate him spending so much time with us.
[01:11:17.684 --> 01:11:22.548]  This is his, I guess, fifth visit with InfoWars, his third visit on this radio show.
[01:11:24.269 --> 01:11:34.996]  Remember, they would always say the NSA was not spying on American citizens, and talking to a lot of other whistleblowers and people from Wayne Madsen right through, for all intents and purposes, that was the case.
[01:11:36.966 --> 01:11:38.327]  Until 9-11.
[01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.650]  And Benny's testified to that.
[01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:46.674]  Now they're listening and watching and controlling and grabbing almost everything.
[01:11:47.535 --> 01:11:48.596]  Now, it's totally illegal.
[01:11:49.437 --> 01:11:50.618]  And it's being used politically.
[01:11:50.638 --> 01:11:52.299]  They've been spying on Congress.
[01:11:52.659 --> 01:11:53.520]  It's just over the top.
[01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:56.102]  It's like living in a glass house.
[01:11:56.943 --> 01:11:58.504]  But then, oh, the group's doing it.
[01:11:58.564 --> 01:11:59.545]  They're totally secretive.
[01:11:59.585 --> 01:12:03.789]  So you go to jail for espionage if you go spy on the CIA or NSA.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.022]  But if they do it, oh well, it's okay.
[01:12:08.502 --> 01:12:17.468]  And I asked Mr. Binney what he wanted to get into first, and it's the fact that the courts have been rubber stamping this.
[01:12:17.488 --> 01:12:21.511]  I mean, there won't even be a need for courts soon with all this.
[01:12:21.611 --> 01:12:31.057]  And, you know, they've caught with parallel construction, these other agencies like the DEA, creating fake investigations to claim they got evidence one way when they got illegally another.
[01:12:31.397 --> 01:12:34.099]  And then these agencies have all been caught planting evidence.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.363]  Physically at the crime lab, at the FBI.
[01:12:37.403 --> 01:12:41.808]  We've had the former head of the crime lab on, Dr. Whitehurst, many times.
[01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:42.548]  He's getting back on.
[01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:44.390]  Hadn't been on in years.
[01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:47.434]  Two digital fingerprints being planted.
[01:12:49.463 --> 01:12:55.267]  So, this is a tool of total social control, in his words, in that London Guardian headline.
[01:12:55.947 --> 01:12:57.248]  And William Binney joins us.
[01:12:57.308 --> 01:13:03.431]  I want him to get into the biggest threats, the breaking news, how private industry is part of this, ways we can try to stop this.
[01:13:04.152 --> 01:13:10.436]  And then I want to open the phones up, we'll give out a hashtag here in a few minutes, where you can tweet at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:16.652]  And you can then send your questions in that I'll also read on air for William Benny.
[01:13:17.053 --> 01:13:25.336]  But I'll give the number out coming up in about 20 minutes, and that's your chance, we'd love to hear from you, to call in with a quick question or comment for William Benny.
[01:13:25.717 --> 01:13:29.358]  ExposedFacts.org, Whistleblower.org.
[01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:32.220]  Again, thank you so much, Mr. Benny, for coming on the show.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:33.920]  Thank you for having me.
[01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:35.441]  You've got the floor.
[01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.222]  Get into what's happening with these judges.
[01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:44.894]  Well, see, it's basically a continuation of what's happened in the Supreme Court.
[01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:54.560]  When the government gets boxed into a corner where they're threatened by the test of a constitutionality of any of the programs they're running, they lie to the courts.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:56.721]  And the courts are letting them get away with it.
[01:13:56.761 --> 01:14:06.307]  For example, in Amnesty International v. Clapper, that case, that case was at the Supreme Court when the Solicitor General lied to the court saying that
[01:14:06.987 --> 01:14:26.676]  Well, if any NSA data was going to be used against an individual, either in court or anywhere else, that the individual would be told so that they could contest the, basically, it's the right to contest discovery that is of information that is libelous or otherwise criminal, implying criminal activity on the part of the individual.
[01:14:27.156 --> 01:14:28.817]  So, but that was a lie.
[01:14:28.977 --> 01:14:29.917]  Nobody had been told.
[01:14:30.097 --> 01:14:33.679]  Even when we talked to the President's Civil Liberties Oversight Board,
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:43.848]  Several months ago, we talked about it and raised that issue, and they said, well, from now on, all the people where that data is being used will be told.
[01:14:44.008 --> 01:14:46.450]  Well, I mean, that's right there.
[01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:50.534]  I mean, and we still have no guarantee that anybody anywhere has ever been told.
[01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:54.737]  And by the fact that they're giving us assurances, how can you trust them?
[01:14:55.197 --> 01:15:00.942]  I mean, after what they've been doing, lying to us outright, how can you trust what they're saying?
[01:15:01.082 --> 01:15:01.503]  You can't.
[01:15:02.077 --> 01:15:05.719]  And so there's no real oversight in government.
[01:15:05.759 --> 01:15:07.420]  There's no checks and balances anymore.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.101]  They don't work.
[01:15:08.981 --> 01:15:12.703]  And that's the fundamental problem with our government.
[01:15:13.223 --> 01:15:14.944]  Our whole process is failing us.
[01:15:16.185 --> 01:15:18.166]  And the courts seem to be going along with it.
[01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:27.772]  That is, if I were on the Supreme Court and the Solicitor General did that to me and I found out about it, the first thing I would do would be to reinstate that case back in the court.
[01:15:28.507 --> 01:15:35.294]  I mean, after all, you don't permit perjury to let you get rid of a genuine concern of the public.
[01:15:35.915 --> 01:15:36.956]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[01:15:36.996 --> 01:15:45.905]  They're allowing perjury by the government to determine what, in fact, is tested in the courts in terms of constitutionality.
[01:15:47.306 --> 01:15:50.710]  In my book, that is what treason is all about.
[01:15:52.017 --> 01:15:56.120]  You're fundamentally going after the foundations of this government and corrupting it.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.442]  That, to me, is real treason.
[01:16:01.144 --> 01:16:07.369]  Well, it certainly is treason, and now, if they're able to do this, then the sky's the limit.
[01:16:07.489 --> 01:16:08.670]  What comes next?
[01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:11.472]  I mean, it's just a total overthrow of our system.
[01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:12.393]  Please continue.
[01:16:13.214 --> 01:16:15.335]  Well, I mean, that's the whole point.
[01:16:15.516 --> 01:16:21.060]  It's a total destruction of any of the rights you thought you had under the Constitution.
[01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:26.849]  I mean, it's simply a matter of we no longer have a constitution.
[01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:30.030]  And that's the real problem that I see.
[01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:32.151]  I think we need to stand up.
[01:16:32.211 --> 01:16:38.975]  I mean, I can't understand why these judges on these courts can actually look themselves in the eye when they shave in the morning.
[01:16:38.995 --> 01:16:41.897]  I mean, after all, they know what the law is.
[01:16:41.937 --> 01:16:42.537]  They should know.
[01:16:43.177 --> 01:16:45.619]  They know the Fourth Amendment says you don't have data.
[01:16:45.659 --> 01:16:47.219]  The government doesn't have data on a U.S.
[01:16:47.259 --> 01:16:48.040]  citizen unless
[01:16:48.712 --> 01:16:55.415]  You state the citizen's name, the data you're after, and also show probable cause of why you're going at it, and where you're going to get it.
[01:16:56.296 --> 01:17:00.438]  Now, all that, none of that is happening with the hundreds of millions of U.S.
[01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:02.219]  citizens that they're collecting data on.
[01:17:02.379 --> 01:17:03.059]  None of that's happening.
[01:17:03.099 --> 01:17:06.081]  Sure, and the argument is, well, we're doing this to stop bad guys.
[01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.882]  But the truth is... Well, that's a lie, too.
[01:17:08.902 --> 01:17:09.442]  Well, exactly.
[01:17:09.462 --> 01:17:11.783]  They're using it to consolidate the takeover.
[01:17:11.823 --> 01:17:14.745]  Well, from your expert view, what is it really being used for, sir?
[01:17:15.646 --> 01:17:22.009]  Well, it's being used to set up the way and means to control the population.
[01:17:22.449 --> 01:17:26.171]  I mean, I call NSA the central repository of knowledge on the U.S.
[01:17:26.191 --> 01:17:30.692]  citizen and everybody else on the planet, by the way, for the U.S.
[01:17:30.732 --> 01:17:32.313]  government, all departments of the U.S.
[01:17:32.353 --> 01:17:32.773]  government.
[01:17:32.813 --> 01:17:39.776]  So I've been referring to it as the new Stasi agency, because that's exactly what the Stasi did.
[01:17:39.816 --> 01:17:41.177]  They had files on everyone.
[01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:46.679]  And they wanted, and they had people spying on them right and left, you know, even your neighbors would spy on you.
[01:17:46.719 --> 01:17:48.880]  Well, that's what's happening internally in NSA now.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.663]  They're talking about having people say, if you see something, say something.
[01:17:52.723 --> 01:17:55.504]  That's the kind of thing they're talking about internally in NSA now.
[01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:59.447]  Well, I mean, you know, that's, that's the Stasi in spades.
[01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:19.205]  I mean, Tom Drake was over in Germany a year or two ago and he met up with an older couple, an older German couple, and they said to him, they said, well, you know, we, we the Germans, we are a post-fascist state and we know it.
[01:18:19.826 --> 01:18:24.950]  But you, you are, you are in fact a pre-fascist state and don't even know that.
[01:18:26.311 --> 01:18:28.633]  So, I mean, the point is we have to wake up here.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.921]  What do you do, though, when you're faced with true tyranny?
[01:18:32.961 --> 01:18:50.690]  This is classical tyranny, not just with the warrantless, ubiquitous, omnipresent spy grid, but the fact that major corporations have lined up to seamlessly Trojan horse surveillance into every device, into our cars, tax by the miles coming out.
[01:18:51.491 --> 01:18:59.479]  All the smart meters, spying, all the new appliances with the former CIA director bragging that your washing machine will listen to you.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:09.690]  This is already going on and it's becoming ubiquitous and then it's being used illegally and it's being used to rig markets, rig the stock market.
[01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:12.974]  I mean this is really a 21st century takeover.
[01:19:13.519 --> 01:19:14.580]  Yes, it is.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.123]  And that's something that we need to all stand up and object to.
[01:19:18.203 --> 01:19:20.525]  I mean, if we don't, it's going to happen to us.
[01:19:20.605 --> 01:19:23.828]  If you don't stand up, it's like the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
[01:19:23.888 --> 01:19:28.712]  Well, if you don't become the squeaky wheel, you don't get satisfaction anywhere.
[01:19:29.052 --> 01:19:37.519]  Certainly not in our, you can't really call what we have now a clear democracy, because after all, it's more like a police state.
[01:19:38.459 --> 01:19:44.583]  William Benny, a former director and leader for intelligence with the NSA, joins us.
[01:19:44.623 --> 01:19:48.165]  The biggest whistleblower in NSA history, hands down.
[01:19:48.706 --> 01:19:51.988]  But he's just giving you the general view, none of the classified stuff here.
[01:19:52.428 --> 01:19:53.749]  You know, they've tried to put him in jail.
[01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:54.810]  We'll talk some about that.
[01:19:55.210 --> 01:20:01.634]  We'll also get his view on what he thinks the culture's like inside these agencies that are illegally doing it.
[01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:05.636]  What's the morale like at the NSA and beyond with William Benny?
[01:20:06.017 --> 01:20:06.937]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.258 --> 01:20:07.718]  Stay with us.

[01:21:08.943 --> 01:21:11.507]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:11.787 --> 01:21:16.654]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:24.746]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:25.026 --> 01:21:29.332]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:21:29.532 --> 01:21:33.377]  Bipatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:33.517 --> 01:21:39.245]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:39.485 --> 01:21:42.189]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:47.831]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.

[01:24:24.151 --> 01:24:36.397]  William Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency, basically a number two, three or four position depending on how you look at it, a major director of the NSA, here with us today.
[01:24:37.597 --> 01:24:40.318]  So there are good people from the system telling the truth.
[01:24:40.338 --> 01:24:42.039]  In fact, there are so many.
[01:24:42.799 --> 01:24:46.701]  But mainstream media tries to ignore them or vilify them or demonize them.
[01:24:48.042 --> 01:24:50.063]  I want to talk about the morale at the NSA.
[01:24:51.448 --> 01:24:55.832]  Listeners can tweet at hashtag NSA INSIDER.
[01:24:56.693 --> 01:24:59.455]  Capitalize NSA and then lower caps INSIDER.
[01:24:59.816 --> 01:25:02.418]  Hashtag NSA INSIDER for your questions.
[01:25:02.438 --> 01:25:03.699]  Those are coming up in the next segment.
[01:25:04.039 --> 01:25:05.160]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:05.280]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.441]  Your chance to talk.
[01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:27.113]  To a very honorable person, in my view, who has a lot of courage and sacrificed their career to try to defend our Republic, and who worked at the NSA trying to defend us from foreign enemies, which is what it was set up for.
[01:25:27.533 --> 01:25:32.755]  William, what about the morale at the NSA, from your view, and what about your former colleagues?
[01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:33.836]  What are they saying to you?
[01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:40.678]  A, and then B, tell folks a little bit about the persecution you've gone through, just to understand the level of tyranny we're dealing with.
[01:25:43.047 --> 01:26:01.841]  Well, I think I don't talk directly to anybody that works at NSA still, simply because if I did, you know, I'm a target, I have been for quite a while, so they would of course be targeted by the FBI and interrogated by FBI and Internal Security at NSA, so I don't do that to them.
[01:26:04.869 --> 01:26:15.857]  I know that they've instituted programs that get agency employees to spy on one another, which simply means that it's just like East Germany.
[01:26:15.917 --> 01:26:20.980]  I mean, your neighbors are spying on you, and here it's your neighbors you're working with and trying to do the job.
[01:26:21.361 --> 01:26:24.123]  That's a very hostile environment.
[01:26:25.143 --> 01:26:27.425]  You're basically shaking the trust of individuals
[01:26:28.069 --> 01:26:28.950]  I mean, that's that's simply
[01:26:42.148 --> 01:26:43.610]  That's simply unproductive.
[01:26:43.630 --> 01:26:51.839]  It destroys initiative and so on because nobody wants to do anything for fear that somebody will think it's something wrong and so they'll get informed on and be interrogated.
[01:26:51.879 --> 01:26:53.120]  That's the way it was in East Germany.
[01:26:53.161 --> 01:26:55.663]  That's why their whole society stagnated.
[01:26:55.824 --> 01:26:59.147]  So that's a real counterproductive process for them to set up.
[01:26:59.688 --> 01:27:00.669]  And I know internally that
[01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:16.633]  People from, who have retired from NSA, come through the retirement chain, we get the word back from them, saying basically that there's an awful lot of people there are kind of upset at what they're doing, at spying on domestically.
[01:27:16.713 --> 01:27:21.553]  And so, but they're so afraid to do anything because they've looked at what they've done to us.
[01:27:22.354 --> 01:27:25.494]  Which gets into your following point there.
[01:27:25.714 --> 01:27:30.655]  They, in order to try to silence anybody from objecting internally in NSA,
[01:27:31.536 --> 01:27:47.389]  What they did was they threatened us with persecution and up to 35 years in jail, using the 1917 Espionage Act, which we at the time were simply, we were all staying at the point.
[01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:58.539]  The only one who was outside the government complaining about it was Tom Drake, and he was talking to the Baltimore Sun, but he didn't release anything classified, and that was agreed to by the government in court.
[01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:12.417]  So they were really coming after us just to shut us down from exposing the corruption, fraud, waste, abuse that was going on, as well as all of the unconstitutional activity.
[01:28:13.698 --> 01:28:21.425]  And they used the FBI first to raid us and take all our property and threaten us with guns, some of us, directly.
[01:28:26.806 --> 01:28:40.016]  The follow-on was the Department of Justice used all their power to try to indict us and put us in jail so that we would be out of sight and out of mind permanently, so to speak.
[01:28:40.517 --> 01:28:42.298]  Literal political prisoners.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.702]  Describe, you talk about being raided at gunpoint.
[01:28:47.742 --> 01:28:48.403]  What was that like?
[01:28:49.697 --> 01:29:04.922]  Well, it's really strange to be coming out of your shower in the morning and have somebody pointing a gun at you, so you look at the end of a barrel of a pistol as you're coming out of the shower, having no idea why they're doing this to you.
[01:29:05.482 --> 01:29:09.966]  I mean, after all, we were trying to work within the government all the way up to then, but they just didn't want us doing it.
[01:29:10.046 --> 01:29:10.486]  That's all.
[01:29:10.906 --> 01:29:12.147]  It was just too embarrassing.
[01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:14.449]  They didn't want anybody in government to know what they were doing.
[01:29:14.489 --> 01:29:17.812]  And that's important, too, because that gets back to checks and balances.
[01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:22.976]  Now, if that's the case, how can any part of government check any other part of government?
[01:29:23.016 --> 01:29:23.496]  They can't.
[01:29:23.716 --> 01:29:24.037]  That's right.
[01:29:24.077 --> 01:29:29.161]  You're doing your job as one of the top codebreakers in history, running the NSA.
[01:29:29.241 --> 01:29:31.863]  You leave honorably, try to work to the government.
[01:29:32.563 --> 01:29:35.805]  And then their answer is to send a SWAT team to your house to intimidate you.
[01:29:36.465 --> 01:29:38.786]  If this isn't oppression, I don't know what is.
[01:29:38.846 --> 01:29:41.588]  But the good news is, it's coming out.
[01:29:41.768 --> 01:29:42.928]  William Benny's our guest.
[01:29:43.329 --> 01:29:47.130]  Your questions from Twitter, at Real Alex Jones, and your phone calls.
[01:29:47.231 --> 01:29:49.492]  Straight ahead, long segment coming up.
[01:29:49.572 --> 01:29:52.153]  What an incredibly honorable, good man.
[01:29:52.173 --> 01:29:54.674]  We need more like him, don't we?
[01:29:54.714 --> 01:29:55.895]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:58.775 --> 01:30:01.762]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.704 --> 01:30:05.390]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.166 --> 01:30:16.748]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:30:16.968 --> 01:30:20.769]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:27.191]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:35.594]  Using Super Oxygenation OxyPowder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[01:30:35.874 --> 01:30:40.877]  InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[01:30:41.197 --> 01:30:43.558]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[01:30:43.719 --> 01:30:45.580]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.200]  I'd say a week.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:46.860]  Seven days.
[01:30:47.321 --> 01:30:48.862]  And I've been able to keep it off, too.
[01:30:49.102 --> 01:30:50.683]  My wife is like, wow, you look really good.

[01:32:11.646 --> 01:32:15.808]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:16.148 --> 01:32:17.169]  Security alert.
[01:32:17.389 --> 01:32:19.110]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:20.010]  Analysis.
[01:32:20.271 --> 01:32:20.911]  InfoWars.
[01:32:20.991 --> 01:32:22.952]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:22.972 --> 01:32:27.955]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:28.935]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:28.995 --> 01:32:30.436]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:30.556 --> 01:32:33.318]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:33.338 --> 01:32:36.480]  It's a popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:38.841]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:40.421]  People are assaulting us.
[01:32:40.461 --> 01:32:42.702]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:43.302 --> 01:32:44.963]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:45.243 --> 01:32:49.124]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:56.227 --> 01:32:56.967]  Imperative.
[01:32:57.227 --> 01:32:59.227]  Destroy Britain's in it TV.
[01:32:59.247 --> 01:33:03.669]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:03.949 --> 01:33:06.130]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:33:21.234 --> 01:33:25.156]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:26.077 --> 01:33:31.019]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.119 --> 01:33:33.361]  Careful what you wish.
[01:33:33.381 --> 01:33:34.301]  You just might get it.
[01:33:35.982 --> 01:33:38.984]  When your crown king nothing, but it all crashes down,
[01:33:42.307 --> 01:33:46.151]  Historically, we know what happens time and time again.
[01:33:46.191 --> 01:33:56.400]  Societies stagnate, the spy grids are used to start persecuting people, and the society devolves into something like North Korea.
[01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:01.204]  And we see that now happening here, and no one is safe.
[01:34:01.965 --> 01:34:05.268]  Whether they be Ceausescu of Romania, or Joe Stalin.
[01:34:10.117 --> 01:34:14.741]  Centralized systems are incredibly dangerous and unstable.
[01:34:14.781 --> 01:34:15.942]  They sit on one leg.
[01:34:15.962 --> 01:34:18.164]  We're gonna go back to William Benny.
[01:34:18.204 --> 01:34:30.374]  I've got a bunch of Twitter questions from real Alex Jones at hashtag NSA Insider and loaded phone lines with Michael, Peter, Dominic, Julio, Joseph and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:34:33.783 --> 01:34:43.966]  Before we go back to our guest, please remember we are not funded like a lot of mainstream media through government bailouts and banker bailouts or NPR, you know, getting taxpayer money.
[01:34:44.006 --> 01:34:48.988]  We're funded by listeners like you, supporting our local AM and FM affiliates, spreading the word.
[01:34:50.011 --> 01:34:50.631]  We're good to go.
[01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:11.987]  The high quality supplements of the new Molon Labe collector edition silver coins.
[01:35:12.087 --> 01:35:13.068]  Only 500 of them.
[01:35:13.329 --> 01:35:14.470]  You get a free lapel pin.
[01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:19.295]  The nickel and also brass come and take it.
[01:35:19.355 --> 01:35:21.238]  Molon Labe belt buckles.
[01:35:22.472 --> 01:35:28.080]  All of this is now available at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.985]  And again, if you order by the 17th, we guarantee shipping in the lower 48.
[01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:49.717]  If you order this week, we can get it to you basically anywhere in the world where UPS or USPS ships, or to Alaska or Hawaii.
[01:35:50.197 --> 01:36:04.306]  But get your Christmas or holiday orders in, and these are high quality products, whether it's a Molon Labe ball cap or high quality silver bullet colloidal silver, or whether it's the nascent high quality iodine that so many people are deficient in.
[01:36:04.646 --> 01:36:08.089]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[01:36:08.749 --> 01:36:12.133]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:13.414 --> 01:36:23.446]  But get the Molon Labe belt buckles and silver coins while you can, because these are all limited edition, $500 each, and once it sells out, we never sell them again.
[01:36:23.466 --> 01:36:26.129]  We've already had one series of Molon Labe belt buckles.
[01:36:26.549 --> 01:36:27.611]  This is the second series.
[01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:28.992]  We'll have one more!
[01:36:29.773 --> 01:36:34.094]  And then that will be it for at least a couple years before we even have a new design.
[01:36:34.514 --> 01:36:39.035]  Like I said, we had the Joker shirt and would bring it back.
[01:36:39.095 --> 01:36:39.575]  Never did.
[01:36:40.135 --> 01:36:41.676]  Okay, enough of that.
[01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:44.436]  William Binning, I want to go to these calls.
[01:36:44.616 --> 01:36:56.599]  I want to have you be able to speak to any topic you wish, but to imagine you with all these commendations and medals you have, you know, called by Nightline and other
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:57.800]  I don't
[01:37:17.949 --> 01:37:22.072]  Basically imply that you were a bad guy so they could disappear you down the road.
[01:37:22.132 --> 01:37:26.375]  I mean, if they can get William Benny, they can go after anybody.
[01:37:26.395 --> 01:37:34.981]  And then I want to get your view on Snowden, and he says that a revelation's coming out that would bring down the political system.
[01:37:35.001 --> 01:37:38.404]  Or he said, be careful, I have a revelation that would bring you down.
[01:37:39.084 --> 01:37:44.228]  Well, what type of revelation could that be, William Benny?
[01:37:46.089 --> 01:37:59.352]  Well, he may simply be talking about, like for example, CIA was spying on Feinstein's Intelligence Committee when they were preparing that report, again, on terror.
[01:38:00.072 --> 01:38:02.372]  The report she's trying to get out here recently.
[01:38:02.452 --> 01:38:07.674]  I think if they look a little closer, they'll find out that that spying is much more extensive than they even think.
[01:38:08.574 --> 01:38:09.494]  So, in other words,
[01:38:10.393 --> 01:38:28.037]  I think if they look fairly closely, I mean, Russ Tice has said this for several years now, that they have been spying on senators, House of Representatives, judges of the Supreme Court, even in the White House, and also generals and other federal judges and so on.
[01:38:28.057 --> 01:38:30.978]  So they're looking, they're spying, the spying network that we
[01:38:31.018 --> 01:38:31.599]  We're good to go.
[01:38:49.491 --> 01:38:55.695]  So this is an uncontrollable, these are uncontrollable agencies.
[01:38:55.755 --> 01:39:03.299]  They have no way of verifying anything they're doing and they let them continue that way, when in fact they should all stand up.
[01:39:03.339 --> 01:39:14.546]  The problem is, you don't know, and they don't know, the House of Representatives and Senators, they don't know what kind of evidence the intelligence community has accumulated about them and their activities.
[01:39:15.086 --> 01:39:15.907]  Is it something like
[01:39:16.559 --> 01:39:19.742]  J. Edgar Hoover had over the entire Congress.
[01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:28.291]  He used that power to... It was actually the power he had was that he may not have known anything about you, but you may think he did.
[01:39:28.791 --> 01:39:30.833]  And that gave him power over you.
[01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:35.078]  But he certainly knew a lot about the leadership in Washington.
[01:39:35.758 --> 01:39:45.410]  Well, we also know those files were a form of internal governmental defamation and slander and libel because they were also filled with disinformation and garbage.
[01:39:45.671 --> 01:39:46.912]  And that goes to my next question.
[01:39:47.633 --> 01:39:51.378]  What about the problem of planted data through the system?
[01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:52.740]  I mean, we know that goes on.
[01:39:53.871 --> 01:39:56.412]  Well, I mean, yes.
[01:39:56.913 --> 01:40:02.736]  That plus, in our case, at least in the cases that we had, we knew they were fabricating data.
[01:40:03.156 --> 01:40:10.320]  And in Tom Drake's case, when they indicted him, the data that they had there was fabricated.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:15.183]  It was retroactively classified, and then he was charged for having classified material.
[01:40:15.223 --> 01:40:16.463]  Well, I mean, that's like
[01:40:18.611 --> 01:40:22.393]  I mean, that's a felony, and these people should go to jail for that.
[01:40:22.913 --> 01:40:41.822]  Even Thomas Tam, back in 2003, when he was the lawyer in the Department of Justice that was the source of the New York Times article on warrantless wiretapping, and his job at the Department of Justice was to prepare the warrant request for the FISA court, the secret court.
[01:40:43.148 --> 01:40:49.994]  And so when he was going through that, he was discovering that they had wiretaps already on people that they hadn't gone through the FISA court to get.
[01:40:50.474 --> 01:40:57.000]  Well, that by definition or by law at the time was a violation.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.161]  That was a federal felony.
[01:40:58.681 --> 01:41:03.525]  In other words, if you didn't have a FISA-approved warrant to get a wiretap on a U.S.
[01:41:03.585 --> 01:41:10.571]  citizen for the intelligence community, then you, in fact, were committing a federal felony.
[01:41:10.611 --> 01:41:12.252]  And they were doing it by the thousands.
[01:41:12.472 --> 01:41:13.373]  It never got in trouble.
[01:41:13.873 --> 01:41:14.934]  It never got in trouble.
[01:41:15.034 --> 01:41:23.983]  Wasn't that really part of a larger parallel construction where they only go get the warrant later once they want to go back and claim that they got the information with a warrant?
[01:41:24.523 --> 01:41:28.767]  Yeah, that was all part of that and that had been going on since at least 2001.
[01:41:28.867 --> 01:41:29.287]  Since after 9-11.
[01:41:33.386 --> 01:41:39.933]  And Director Mueller of the FBI said they were using that program, Stellar Wind, which is the domestic spying program.
[01:41:40.393 --> 01:41:47.180]  He said they were using it since 9-11 in 2001, which is October, which is when they created the name Stellar Wind.
[01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:52.494]  William Binney, Top NSA Whistleblowers, our guest.
[01:41:52.534 --> 01:41:55.698]  I mean, I'm just a layperson, but correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:41:55.718 --> 01:42:03.168]  A, when you start snooping on everybody, you create giant troughs of information that could be stolen, hacked, or taken.
[01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:07.613]  B, you're focusing on so much that you miss the real threats.
[01:42:08.294 --> 01:42:11.075]  That are specific and can be tracked and focused in on.
[01:42:11.515 --> 01:42:14.056]  So you blind yourself in a way having too much data.
[01:42:14.096 --> 01:42:15.877]  It's like having a billion phone messages.
[01:42:15.917 --> 01:42:17.478]  You can't listen to any of them basically.
[01:42:18.538 --> 01:42:27.542]  And then C, and I think this is probably the most important, it creates a whole system of blackmail domestically and will convert you to a tyranny.
[01:42:27.802 --> 01:42:29.763]  So it's like suicide.
[01:42:29.783 --> 01:42:31.404]  I mean what did Congress think?
[01:42:31.804 --> 01:42:33.705]  It's already come out for decades they use
[01:42:34.625 --> 01:42:39.650]  The NSA, the British NSA, GCHQ, to spy on Parliament.
[01:42:40.711 --> 01:42:49.919]  And now they're using all this data on each other and it just, I mean, why would the political elite create such a thing and think that they could control it?
[01:42:51.121 --> 01:42:53.583]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:53.824 --> 01:43:00.390]  And the point is that what it means is you're giving all this knowledge and power to a set of individuals that aren't controlled.
[01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:02.612]  And sooner or later, they use it.
[01:43:02.872 --> 01:43:05.155]  I mean, that's just human nature to have that happen.
[01:43:05.555 --> 01:43:13.122]  So, I mean, you know, it's only a matter of time, like you say, as to how long it's going to take them to take advantage of all the data they've gotten.
[01:43:14.491 --> 01:43:21.945]  I mean, it's just a very bad situation and a very bad path that we've chosen to take here down the dark side with Dick Cheney.
[01:43:23.706 --> 01:43:26.348]  Sometimes you gotta work on the dark side, to quote Dick Cheney.
[01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:26.909]  Yeah.
[01:43:27.389 --> 01:43:28.910]  In fact, guys, find that clip if you can.
[01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:30.752]  Well, that's what's so crazy about this.
[01:43:30.852 --> 01:43:31.913]  Information's power.
[01:43:31.953 --> 01:43:37.397]  And they've taught so many people in public school and in colleges and TV that, oh, if you don't have anything to hide, don't worry about it.
[01:43:37.737 --> 01:43:39.118]  Well, why not have a glass house?
[01:43:39.519 --> 01:43:42.061]  Why not leave your codes to your computer out publicly?
[01:43:42.121 --> 01:43:42.341]  No.
[01:43:43.222 --> 01:43:46.484]  We all know that bad people will take advantage of that information.
[01:43:46.945 --> 01:43:49.106]  Well, it's the same thing with government or corporations.
[01:43:50.267 --> 01:43:51.428]  What about corporations?
[01:43:51.568 --> 01:43:58.314]  I see them almost as a bigger threat now because they're all in a race with government to be the ultimate spy.
[01:43:58.354 --> 01:44:02.217]  I mean, isn't Google really the ultimate spy in the final equation?
[01:44:03.204 --> 01:44:11.927]  I think part of the problem with their mining of Gmail is getting close to what the government's doing, but they don't have the resources.
[01:44:12.267 --> 01:44:17.609]  Part of the problem is that Google doesn't have all the data access that the NSA does, for example.
[01:44:18.249 --> 01:44:25.791]  NSA can get into any business activity like banking or travel or anything like that, and Google doesn't really have access to all of that.
[01:44:26.151 --> 01:44:28.772]  It also doesn't have access to all the emails.
[01:44:28.812 --> 01:44:31.313]  They have a good number, but they don't have all of them.
[01:44:32.494 --> 01:44:42.379]  And they don't also have the cooperation of other companies around the world and corporations to give them the wiretaps to get the transactional relationships between people.
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:45.701]  Not all of it anyway.
[01:44:45.721 --> 01:44:49.903]  I mean they certainly have a great deal of it but it's not to the degree that government is.
[01:44:50.183 --> 01:44:53.545]  So government brings it all together and in the darkness binds it?
[01:44:54.124 --> 01:44:55.265]  Right, right.
[01:44:55.405 --> 01:45:09.519]  And the point is that Google and companies do not have the power that government does when it comes to arresting people or, you know, putting them in jail or fabricating evidence or framing them like they've tried to do to us.
[01:45:09.679 --> 01:45:17.246]  So, I mean, there's quite a bit of difference between government and, at least in terms of power and capability.
[01:45:20.618 --> 01:45:27.242]  I want to go to some phone calls for William Benny here and also go through this huge list of Twitter questions that we have.
[01:45:27.943 --> 01:45:31.005]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in Texas.
[01:45:31.465 --> 01:45:33.647]  Joseph, you're on the air with William Benny.
[01:45:35.428 --> 01:45:36.969]  Hi.
[01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:50.298]  I wanted to call in and talk to you guys about, I'm a hairdresser in Dallas and I had a client for a little while this year who was, he was the VP for the manufacturer that created the MSA Center in Utah.
[01:45:51.483 --> 01:45:58.427]  And, uh, he gave me a lot of, uh, you know, he told me as much as I guess he could about, uh, when they were building it and, um, about this data center.
[01:45:59.407 --> 01:46:05.490]  And, uh, I also have another friend of mine who just recently met who's, uh, he works with AT&T on the neural networks collecting the data.
[01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:11.473]  So, um, I wanted to ask some questions, uh, and just see if, you know, I could get an answer from him.
[01:46:11.613 --> 01:46:19.297]  Um, I was basically told just, uh, that the, uh, the NSA data center, you know, that was, that, that, you know, they were spying on,
[01:46:20.034 --> 01:46:23.919]  You know, everything from our cell phones to our banks, everything, connecting it all.
[01:46:24.459 --> 01:46:33.970]  You know, and after I heard that, I actually heard a documentary with, you know, from, it was like the Operation Stellar Wind documentary, and so I just wanted to hear about that.
[01:46:36.045 --> 01:46:40.948]  Yeah, that's the whole point of why they had to build Bluffdale with all that storage.
[01:46:41.028 --> 01:46:51.815]  I mean, it wasn't for metadata, it was for content of communications, you know, like all of your emails and phone conversation recordings and transcripts and things like that.
[01:46:53.194 --> 01:47:13.128]  The point is, if you wanted to put together all of the relationships of everybody in the world on metadata relationships and build those kind of, what they're called, graphs, or simply social networks of everybody in every domain, phone calls, emails, banking, all of that, then you could do that and store it in a room 20 foot by 40 foot.
[01:47:14.148 --> 01:47:18.972]  That's all it would take to store all the relationships in all the domains of everybody in the world.
[01:47:20.152 --> 01:47:22.034]  So, and you could keep it there for, I mean,
[01:47:22.985 --> 01:47:25.226]  You know, 50 years, perhaps, something like that.
[01:47:26.047 --> 01:47:33.011]  And so the real point was the hundreds of thousands of square feet of storage was needed for the content.
[01:47:33.051 --> 01:47:34.892]  And that's where the bulk of data is.
[01:47:34.972 --> 01:47:36.653]  That's where the bulk of information is.
[01:47:36.713 --> 01:47:40.215]  And that's what it that's what takes an awful lot of storage up.
[01:47:40.876 --> 01:47:43.879]  The rest of it doesn't take that much story.
[01:47:43.899 --> 01:47:44.299]  That's right.
[01:47:44.379 --> 01:47:46.521]  In Utah and Texas, that's a key point.
[01:47:46.941 --> 01:47:50.724]  When they lie and say we're just keeping metadata, they consider everything to be metadata.
[01:47:51.224 --> 01:47:53.146]  It's a lawyer's game they're playing.
[01:47:53.206 --> 01:47:54.027]  Thank you, Joseph.
[01:47:54.987 --> 01:47:56.849]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:47:56.869 --> 01:47:58.891]  Let's talk to Dominique in California.
[01:47:58.931 --> 01:47:59.531]  You're on the air.
[01:47:59.551 --> 01:48:02.313]  Hey there, William.
[01:48:02.694 --> 01:48:06.477]  I got a question about who they're kind of watching now.
[01:48:07.225 --> 01:48:16.449]  I videotaped a jet laying some geoengineering trails out the other day, and some webs started falling from the trail.
[01:48:16.509 --> 01:48:20.891]  And I got it all on tape, and I got a lot of samples of these webs falling from the sky.
[01:48:21.471 --> 01:48:26.653]  And my question is, are they monitoring geoengineering activists such as myself?
[01:48:26.673 --> 01:48:30.915]  Because I've been telling a lot of people about this and trying to get the word out there.
[01:48:31.215 --> 01:48:32.595]  I'm kind of getting a little worried.
[01:48:32.856 --> 01:48:33.856]  Well, I don't think you heard him.
[01:48:34.056 --> 01:48:35.857]  Everything's being recorded and monitored.
[01:48:36.846 --> 01:48:39.727]  And now I don't think they mind that it's out as a chilling effect.
[01:48:40.307 --> 01:48:41.508]  It's illegal what they're doing.
[01:48:41.528 --> 01:48:42.288]  We need to stop it.
[01:48:42.428 --> 01:48:45.569]  But it doesn't intimidate me and doesn't shut down my speech.
[01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:47.730]  William Binney, do you have any information?
[01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:48.531]  Thank you, Dominic.
[01:48:48.891 --> 01:48:51.672]  Do you have any information on geoengineering, climate manipulation?
[01:48:53.253 --> 01:48:55.593]  Well, I would think that that's one of the things.
[01:48:55.633 --> 01:48:59.435]  They're certainly monitoring all kinds of research done around the world.
[01:49:00.495 --> 01:49:04.237]  For example, one of the best ways to find out who's working on quantum computing
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:13.806]  Is to, for example, go to a quantum computing conference around the world and just go around and collect business cards.
[01:49:14.807 --> 01:49:24.774]  And you find that that sets up a community and then you work the transactional relationships you're getting across the network to build their social network of who they're working with to work on quantum computing.
[01:49:25.214 --> 01:49:29.978]  And I'm sure they would do the same thing for any kind of climate alterations and so on.
[01:49:30.038 --> 01:49:33.100]  I mean, any kind of serious
[01:49:35.609 --> 01:49:35.950]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:36.611]  Let's go to Julio in Wyoming.
[01:49:51.398 --> 01:49:53.359]  Merry Christmas to you all.
[01:49:53.419 --> 01:49:59.841]  It's funny, Mr. Benny, you mentioned about collecting business cards and going to those conferences, that caller that mentioned geoengineering.
[01:50:00.301 --> 01:50:01.582]  That's what I've done, Mr. Benny.
[01:50:01.642 --> 01:50:09.885]  I've gone to these conferences, collected business cards, spoke to people in geoengineering, and I agree, people need to do that.
[01:50:10.545 --> 01:50:13.586]  I want to mention this document briefly before I get to my question.
[01:50:13.646 --> 01:50:14.487]  I think it's cute.
[01:50:14.547 --> 01:50:26.091]  The NSA is trying to attract children through their Change the World program, which includes solving fun puzzles and exploring the world of cryptology.
[01:50:26.131 --> 01:50:29.433]  I think that's kind of cute with the Change the World program.
[01:50:29.853 --> 01:50:31.193]  You mentioned about blackmail.
[01:50:31.634 --> 01:50:39.877]  You know, it's quite clear bureaucracies and totalitarian agencies like the NSA are using blackmail
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:41.701]  to their advantage.
[01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:45.224]  My question is how deep does that rabbit hole go?
[01:50:45.564 --> 01:50:57.774]  And I spoke to someone who's a contractor in Colorado Springs last week who told me there's a lot of movement from these types of agencies moving towards Colorado Springs and other parts of the world.
[01:50:57.794 --> 01:50:59.356]  Sure, that's where the alternate government's based.
[01:50:59.396 --> 01:51:00.276]  Thank you for the call.
[01:51:00.617 --> 01:51:01.938]  That's a lot of questions there.
[01:51:01.978 --> 01:51:06.902]  But blackmail, you already spoke to that, but what else can you tell us about blackmail, William Benning?
[01:51:07.731 --> 01:51:12.878]  Well, the problem, of course, is that once you have all that data, that's the power that that data gives you.
[01:51:12.938 --> 01:51:16.283]  I mean, if you have information like... Let me use an example.
[01:51:16.303 --> 01:51:20.869]  I was on the Eliot Spitzer Show on Current TV when he was on the show there.
[01:51:21.736 --> 01:51:27.959]  And, you know, he was, I mean, he never told me this, but I've been inferenced it to him.
[01:51:27.979 --> 01:51:43.407]  I mean, he was after the bankers after the 2008 banking fiasco, and a lot of people lost a lot of money there, and that was because of fraudulent solicitations by the banks, passing around packaged mortgage groups and things like that, you know?
[01:51:44.068 --> 01:51:47.129]  And so he was going after them criminally.
[01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:49.771]  He was, I think, the governor of New York State at the time.
[01:51:50.607 --> 01:52:08.321]  And as a part of that, why all of a sudden the FBI was going through all of his emails and my financial transactions and so on and they found where he was engaged with a prostitute and they used that to get rid of him.
[01:52:09.725 --> 01:52:14.708]  So, the point is that the FBI didn't even show probable cause for why they were doing it.
[01:52:14.748 --> 01:52:20.871]  The probable cause was they wanted him stopping, they didn't want him criminally prosecuting the bankers in Wall Street.
[01:52:21.731 --> 01:52:23.952]  That's what the whole motive was.
[01:52:24.032 --> 01:52:31.936]  And so, the people who did that, I mean, Muir was the director of FBI at the time, and Alexander was the director of NSA.
[01:52:32.196 --> 01:52:35.338]  So the FBI went into the database of emails
[01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:40.052]  That Mueller testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had access to.
[01:52:41.052 --> 01:52:51.176]  Back in the 30th of March of 2011, he testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had access to this database where he could make a query and get all past and all future emails as they came in on a person.
[01:52:51.536 --> 01:53:00.340]  Well, I mean, when the FBI goes into all those back emails, I mean, looking at data, for example, against Petraeus, I mean, Elliot Spitzer to get rid of him.
[01:53:01.753 --> 01:53:06.677]  Well, then they were the ones who helped the bankers out to keep them out of trouble.
[01:53:07.217 --> 01:53:15.983]  So then you have Mueller and Alexander, after they retire, and they're selling their expertise in cybersecurity.
[01:53:16.023 --> 01:53:17.164]  And who are they selling it to?
[01:53:17.204 --> 01:53:19.666]  A rate of $600,000 a month or something like that.
[01:53:20.286 --> 01:53:25.150]  Originally it started at a million, but now they're selling that to, I believe, the last I heard it was the bankers.
[01:53:26.013 --> 01:53:35.363]  Well, you know, to me, when I took contract law into government, I mean, one of the first things you made sure you did not do was to give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
[01:53:36.178 --> 01:53:38.480]  Now that sure smells like a conflict of interest.
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:42.943]  Sure, you've got a select group of banks that control the Federal Reserve, that already issue and control the currency.
[01:53:43.343 --> 01:53:52.069]  Now they're using the NSA that they helped government build to domestically target everybody, steal data, corner the markets, and just take everything over.
[01:53:52.089 --> 01:53:55.812]  And get rid of people who are trying to hold you accountable.
[01:53:56.801 --> 01:53:58.002]  It's a criminal takeover.
[01:53:58.042 --> 01:53:59.742]  There's no debating it.
[01:54:00.003 --> 01:54:20.432]  Ex-ZackTamount asks, that's his Twitter name, asks William Benny, what does Mr. Benny think about people waking up to spying but also the smart TVs that, for those who don't know, Samsung admits that they quote record what you say in your house and send it to third parties for quote marketing.
[01:54:20.752 --> 01:54:24.234]  What do you think of just the main lining of total spying?
[01:54:25.955 --> 01:54:33.900]  I mean, for me, that is an intrusion, an unauthorized intrusion, and it's a felony, and they should be charged criminally with it.
[01:54:35.781 --> 01:54:44.427]  Kavik on Twitter asks, how closely does Canada's CSE work with the NSA, or is it more a data sharing agreement?
[01:54:46.725 --> 01:54:48.827]  Actually, this has been documented.
[01:54:48.907 --> 01:54:53.031]  It's in some of the documentation that Snowden has provided and has been published.
[01:54:54.452 --> 01:55:01.638]  They are basically the... It's an outgrowth of the World War II effort of the English-speaking countries.
[01:55:01.698 --> 01:55:05.542]  That's the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:06.680]  Now, the U.S.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.943]  is called first party, and the other four are called second party.
[01:55:10.624 --> 01:55:13.926]  That was the closest relationship in history in World War II.
[01:55:13.986 --> 01:55:24.034]  They worked together jointly on breaking Enigma codes and also the Japanese Purple Code and the JN-25 Naval Code.
[01:55:24.655 --> 01:55:30.820]  And those relationships only expanded from there, and the cooperation has been very close.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.602]  It's the closest cooperating group of countries in the world.
[01:55:35.874 --> 01:55:45.464]  Mikhail Phelan, Infowars.com writer, at Mikhail Phelan on Twitter asks, others have mentioned power struggle between the NSA and other intel groups such as the CIA.
[01:55:45.885 --> 01:55:47.426]  Can you expand on that?
[01:55:48.087 --> 01:55:49.529]  Hashtag NSA Insider.
[01:55:51.568 --> 01:55:52.789]  Yes, there always was.
[01:55:52.849 --> 01:56:01.975]  I mean, even before 9-11, I mean, that was part of the, I think, the 9-11 Commission's report, was they need to work a little closer and be a little less rivalry, kind of.
[01:56:02.015 --> 01:56:02.916]  Reduce the rivalry.
[01:56:03.556 --> 01:56:13.323]  The point is that there are certain charters that these agencies have, like the CIA's to do HUMINT, the NSA's to do SIGINT, signals intelligence.
[01:56:14.023 --> 01:56:16.125]  And they jealously guard their charters.
[01:56:16.185 --> 01:56:25.494]  And if they come up with information in their areas, that's like knowledge they have that they can directly provide to senior leadership, the president, and so on for decision making.
[01:56:26.266 --> 01:56:44.097]  So that gives them the sense that they have greater influence in the government and what it does and what the president would decide to do by being able to control or to have the most significant intelligence information to present.
[01:56:44.257 --> 01:56:50.440]  So that creates a rivalry between the agencies and that's been going on for decades.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:51.321]  I mean, that's nothing new.
[01:56:53.454 --> 01:56:57.115]  The CIA does it, the NSA does it, they all do it, to a certain degree.
[01:56:58.116 --> 01:57:01.077]  And that was part of the problem at the 9-11 Commission.
[01:57:03.358 --> 01:57:06.839]  That's certainly an issue.
[01:57:06.859 --> 01:57:21.646]  A rivalry between these agencies is one that is a fundamental flaw that destroys some of the capabilities that they should have in terms of sharing knowledge so that everybody can be leveraging the same set of information.
[01:57:22.489 --> 01:57:25.010]  William Benny, we have another question for you from Twitter.
[01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.730]  F.W.
[01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:33.012]  Partika asks, how would you change the NSA so it would be a positive department?
[01:57:35.173 --> 01:57:40.535]  First of all, I mean, we submitted 21 recommendations to the President of the United States in January this year.
[01:57:40.575 --> 01:57:42.455]  It's an open letter, it's on the web.
[01:57:44.396 --> 01:57:50.218]  And those recommendations, the two primary points in those recommendations, one was to do
[01:57:51.484 --> 01:58:01.652]  To force NSA to make a directed selection of information on known targets and things in a zone of suspicion defined around it.
[01:58:02.358 --> 01:58:15.748]  So that would mean that they would only pull in maybe, they would let 99.99999% of the data pass by and only pull out and store that data that was relevant to targets that they were after.
[01:58:15.768 --> 01:58:18.570]  I'm going to blow up the Eiffel Tower.
[01:58:18.610 --> 01:58:19.310]  That would be grabbed.
[01:58:19.651 --> 01:58:24.874]  That would focus them in on their targets and that would make a rich environment for their analysts to succeed.
[01:58:24.954 --> 01:58:28.817]  And we would actually be able to stop things like the Boston bombing or even 9-11.
[01:58:30.058 --> 01:58:36.080]  I mean, they had all the data to stop 9-11, they just couldn't... William, you've been so gracious giving us 50-something minutes.
[01:58:37.301 --> 01:58:42.022]  Let me talk to you during this break and see if you can stay a little bit longer to finish that statement and take a few more calls.
[01:58:42.042 --> 01:58:44.143]  I don't want to put you on the spot, but can you stay with us?
[01:58:44.803 --> 01:58:45.383]  Yeah, sure, I can.
[01:58:46.104 --> 01:58:46.664]  Unbelievable.

[02:00:16.673 --> 02:00:20.815]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.496 --> 02:00:22.276]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.076 --> 02:00:23.937]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:28.259]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.819 --> 02:00:32.861]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:44.438 --> 02:00:47.281]  We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
[02:00:47.301 --> 02:00:50.343]  We've got to spend time in the shadows, in the intelligence world.
[02:00:51.464 --> 02:01:01.513]  A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies, if we're going to be successful.
[02:01:01.894 --> 02:01:04.676]  That's the world these folks operate in.
[02:01:05.217 --> 02:01:11.442]  So it's going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal, basically, to achieve our objectives.
[02:01:11.602 --> 02:01:39.840]  And now Al Qaeda is bigger than it's ever been and it's renamed ISIS and our own government funded it and William Binney was beginning to get into 9-11 and I've had Colonel Schaefer on, I've had Seibel Edmonds on, I've had the translators, the colonels, I've had so many angles of this covering classified and unclassified information and leaked information that we know they knew about 9-11 and bare minimum stood down
[02:01:40.951 --> 02:01:42.692]  Six of the ten commissioners have said that.
[02:01:43.212 --> 02:01:48.334]  William Binney, without giving out any classified information, obviously, what can you tell us about 9-11?
[02:01:50.995 --> 02:02:04.901]  Well, it's more like after we left NSA because of the domestic spying, Tom Drake, who was still there working, ran a program we were developing to
[02:02:06.215 --> 02:02:08.917]  On the entire database in NSA.
[02:02:08.977 --> 02:02:15.080]  And he found all the data that was necessary to stop 9-11 in their databases prior to 9-11.
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:22.864]  Which simply meant, very simply put, that they could easily have stopped 9-11 if they were doing smart things.
[02:02:23.665 --> 02:02:25.806]  But what was driving them at the time?
[02:02:25.906 --> 02:02:29.848]  Well, it was a matter of getting more and more money and building a bigger budget.
[02:02:29.868 --> 02:02:31.669]  And that's really what their emphasis was on.
[02:02:32.671 --> 02:02:38.253]  So they weren't trying to do smart things, they were trying to do things that would build their empire.
[02:02:39.354 --> 02:02:49.297]  And that, to me, is why I keep saying every time I give a talk anywhere, I keep saying they traded the security of the people of the United States and of the world for money.
[02:02:49.317 --> 02:02:53.559]  And I guess when you make
[02:02:54.955 --> 02:03:23.608]  multi-million dollar purchases from big tech firms for their supercomputers and fiber-optic and cables and you end up getting nice president jobs a few years later with that revolving door it just turns into a giant boondoggle yeah that's that incestuous relationship that exists between government officials and private industry that close relationship building between them so that they can move from one
[02:03:24.497 --> 02:03:29.064]  What do you think about moves to cut off electricity in the water supply in Utah to the data center?
[02:03:40.239 --> 02:03:50.303]  They could certainly try to do that, but I would think that they would call up the National Guard, nationalize things, and go in and make sure that they could continue to keep the power going.
[02:03:50.323 --> 02:04:03.088]  To me, the more important way to attack this problem is to go after them legally by the voting and by getting rid of them and firing their worthless personages from Congress.
[02:04:03.348 --> 02:04:14.016]  Well, you would think that they would be rolling this back with all the lies coming out and that they were deceptive and they're using it against Congress, but instead, like you said, they're just getting the courts lined up to legalize it.
[02:04:14.256 --> 02:04:19.080]  Right, and they're feeling more confident because some of the judges are getting behind them and backing it.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.502]  And I think that's through fear as well.
[02:04:23.524 --> 02:04:27.786]  You never know what kind of blackmail they have on those judges because of the collection of data they've got.
[02:04:28.026 --> 02:04:33.308]  The word is, is that Justice Roberts was being blackmailed on the Obamacare situation.
[02:04:34.789 --> 02:04:35.529]  Yeah, well that could be.
[02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:39.891]  I mean, after all, he did change, he changed it from a penalty to a tax.
[02:04:40.652 --> 02:04:41.912]  And that's changing the law.
[02:04:42.032 --> 02:04:46.634]  And he should have thrown that back to Congress for the Congress to fix that, not the court.
[02:04:46.834 --> 02:04:48.255]  Yeah, the fix is in.
[02:04:49.699 --> 02:04:51.721]  Wow, final segment with William Benning.

[02:08:21.836 --> 02:08:28.121]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.966 --> 02:08:38.790]  It's our final segment with top NSA whistleblower William Benning.
[02:08:40.311 --> 02:08:42.853]  They tried to charge him, the SWAT team raided him, you name it.
[02:08:43.414 --> 02:08:47.117]  When he was just trying to quietly, legally work through the federal government,
[02:08:48.425 --> 02:08:52.527]  ...and Congress to try to stop the illegal spying.
[02:08:53.648 --> 02:08:56.529]  They instead tried to throw him in prison for it, and many others.
[02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:04.714]  It's a testament that we've still got some justice in the court systems, but not much, that he and others have escaped prison.
[02:09:04.834 --> 02:09:05.434]  Others haven't.
[02:09:06.074 --> 02:09:12.578]  They've been trying to put journalists in jail that talk to somebody at the Defense Department at a press conference about North Korea.
[02:09:14.116 --> 02:09:19.477]  And they say, well, we don't want you getting the opinion that we don't think or we do think they have nukes.
[02:09:20.698 --> 02:09:22.178]  We're gonna arrest you.
[02:09:23.018 --> 02:09:25.699]  I mean, this is really a major power grab.
[02:09:26.179 --> 02:09:28.299]  And who would want to do this to our country?
[02:09:28.339 --> 02:09:29.880]  Who would want to do this to our children?
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:33.000]  Who really wants to do this?
[02:09:35.381 --> 02:09:40.042]  They are using the NSA and other agencies to target the general public.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:54.685]  It's a weird feeling when I went to cover Bilderberg and they had plainclothes Marines threatening us, flipping us off, pulling dirty tricks on us, and it later came out and was confirmed that their diplomatic security corps was there.
[02:09:55.185 --> 02:09:56.586]  They saw us as the enemy.
[02:09:57.166 --> 02:10:09.671]  They had been trained, the Marines, officers, officers all, some of them like 45 years old, to harass peaceful journalists that they knew were peaceful.
[02:10:11.425 --> 02:10:17.209]  This is the government we built and paid for being turned against us, and the press is being persecuted.
[02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:19.810]  It's just, it's clear where this is going.
[02:10:20.251 --> 02:10:25.734]  We're not troublemakers up here just, just to say, oh come on, it's all been proven.
[02:10:26.374 --> 02:10:30.537]  William Benny, before we take some final calls, what do you think hurts the NSA most?
[02:10:30.637 --> 02:10:37.942]  Because the fact that they lied and denied they were spying on citizens in non-terror related cases, and the fact that it's now come out,
[02:10:39.659 --> 02:10:41.961]  I mean, is that the biggest blow to the NSA?
[02:10:41.981 --> 02:10:43.301]  And where do you think this fight's going?
[02:10:44.522 --> 02:10:48.165]  Actually, I don't think... In the long run, I don't think it's been a blow to them.
[02:10:48.225 --> 02:10:51.407]  I think they got it to the point where they simply don't care what the public thinks.
[02:10:51.487 --> 02:10:52.788]  It's the arrogance of power.
[02:10:53.868 --> 02:10:54.268]  Hubris.
[02:10:54.849 --> 02:10:55.049]  Yeah.
[02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:57.050]  And so I don't think they really care.
[02:10:57.110 --> 02:11:00.693]  I mean, the one thing that could really hurt them is cutting their financial money.
[02:11:01.633 --> 02:11:02.854]  Cutting the budget that they have.
[02:11:03.715 --> 02:11:05.336]  That is the thing that would hurt them.
[02:11:05.376 --> 02:11:06.937]  That's why they got so nervous about
[02:11:08.018 --> 02:11:13.182]  Representatives Amos and Conyers and their coalition group to unfund NSA last July.
[02:11:13.202 --> 02:11:27.114]  I mean, I don't think I told you this on the programs before, but I was scheduled to brief that coalition prior to them voting on unfunding NSA.
[02:11:28.255 --> 02:11:33.039]  And when they posted that on the congressional record that I was coming down there to testify to them,
[02:11:33.957 --> 02:11:44.684]  Uh, what happened was that President Obama called a meeting of all the members of the House, all the House Democratic members at the same time, so that basically killed that meeting.
[02:11:47.106 --> 02:12:00.735]  And so that was delayed, but we never rescheduled, so they never got to, and then they had to vote on it, and they lost the vote because of lobbying by the President and also General Alexander, heavy lobbying to try to stop it, they lost by 12 votes.
[02:12:01.136 --> 02:12:02.837]  But that was pretty good from a first, uh,
[02:12:03.735 --> 02:12:04.836]  from a first cut.
[02:12:05.277 --> 02:12:16.027]  I mean, the basic motivation that started all this was the fact that they began to realize that they weren't being told the truth by the intelligence committees or by the agencies or by the White House, so that they were being lied to all along.
[02:12:17.468 --> 02:12:18.489]  Because it's illegal.
[02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:19.230]  Yes.
[02:12:20.111 --> 02:12:20.671]  So simple.
[02:12:21.612 --> 02:12:25.896]  Let's talk to Michael in Ohio.
[02:12:25.936 --> 02:12:26.477]  You're on the air.
[02:12:27.956 --> 02:12:29.336]  Hi, I think there might have been a mistake there.
[02:12:29.376 --> 02:12:40.659]  I'm actually calling from FEMA Region 5, but I just kind of wanted to talk to Mr. Benny about what he thought about the racial divide that they're bringing up to kind of distract us from what's going on with the NSA.
[02:12:40.679 --> 02:12:41.399]  That's a great point.
[02:12:41.419 --> 02:12:47.661]  We're all having our rights to privacy taken, and meanwhile you think the only issue in the world is race.
[02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:48.261]  William Benny?
[02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.482]  It's a standard thing that a dictator does.
[02:12:51.642 --> 02:12:56.723]  When you are having internal problems in your country, you create an external threat.
[02:12:57.446 --> 02:13:07.329]  So in this case, what they're doing is creating other threats or other conflicts to deflect interest and focus away from core issues that are fundamental to everything we do.
[02:13:09.810 --> 02:13:11.391]  Absolutely right about that.
[02:13:11.451 --> 02:13:12.151]  Anything else, Michael?
[02:13:13.263 --> 02:13:24.753]  Yeah, I think it's funny that the issues like Ebola and ISIS have also been kind of swept under the rug and no one wants to focus on that, but they sure want to focus on the race issue of what exactly what they want us to focus on.
[02:13:24.773 --> 02:13:25.813]  Thank you, Michael.
[02:13:26.274 --> 02:13:27.955]  Peter in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:13:30.497 --> 02:13:32.599]  Yes, I have a question.
[02:13:32.659 --> 02:13:38.144]  I know it's about before your time, but what do you think of Alan Dulles?
[02:13:38.724 --> 02:13:40.726]  Do you know anything about or heard anything
[02:13:41.904 --> 02:13:46.928]  About him with regard to how, whether he was not so bad or really bad and so forth?
[02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:54.453]  No, I didn't know anything about him or his, when he was in office.
[02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:57.054]  I didn't, I wasn't aware of what he was doing, so.
[02:13:57.395 --> 02:13:58.856]  Alright, Peter, appreciate your call.
[02:13:58.896 --> 02:14:00.577]  And I never heard anything since then, so.
[02:14:00.777 --> 02:14:02.878]  Let's talk to Anthony in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:14:04.159 --> 02:14:04.479]  Hello?
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:05.280]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:14:07.489 --> 02:14:09.050]  I got a question for Mr. Benny.
[02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:22.861]  Has it been possible for a long time that the NSA has the capability and technology to actually watch, for example, somebody walking down a street?
[02:14:29.658 --> 02:14:31.259]  Sir, let me tell you since you're hesitating.
[02:14:31.599 --> 02:14:34.741]  They have satellites with infrared and other things that can track people in real time.
[02:14:35.041 --> 02:14:39.424]  They're tied into a lot of the cameras nationwide that have face scanning software on them.
[02:14:39.644 --> 02:14:40.525]  That's all admitted.
[02:14:40.545 --> 02:14:43.667]  They're getting ready to go to tax by the mile using these systems.
[02:14:43.707 --> 02:14:44.928]  What is your specific question?
[02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:49.871]  Oh, like the NSA for a long time has been
[02:14:51.624 --> 02:14:59.528]  Has it had the capability to actually see people even before the decades?
[02:15:00.728 --> 02:15:01.129]  Wow.
[02:15:01.989 --> 02:15:02.689]  That's amazing.
[02:15:03.850 --> 02:15:04.550]  It certainly is.
[02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:06.131]  Elaborate on that, Mr. Benning.
[02:15:06.977 --> 02:15:11.799]  Well, I mean, it's like the overhead photography, that kind of thing.
[02:15:11.839 --> 02:15:12.839]  You've seen those pictures.
[02:15:12.919 --> 02:15:15.760]  I mean, you can see they've had that capability for decades.
[02:15:15.801 --> 02:15:18.482]  I mean, that's how you watch things on the earth.
[02:15:18.562 --> 02:15:26.425]  That's how the photo interpreters are at the National Photographic Centers.
[02:15:27.671 --> 02:15:31.294]  It used to be called NPIC.
[02:15:31.414 --> 02:15:33.736]  I can't remember what it was called right now.
[02:15:34.036 --> 02:15:36.338]  But it is another agency that handles photography.
[02:15:36.738 --> 02:15:38.159]  They've been doing that for decades.
[02:15:38.179 --> 02:15:39.420]  Space Command and all of it.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:45.986]  But they couldn't see for two weeks Al-Qaeda, renamed ISIS, pouring in out of Syria in long convoys.
[02:15:46.466 --> 02:15:47.547]  They couldn't stop that.
[02:15:49.912 --> 02:15:52.995]  They'll go arrest some teenager on Twitter that makes a threat.
[02:15:53.055 --> 02:15:53.775]  Don't worry.
[02:15:54.356 --> 02:15:55.056]  Don't worry.
[02:15:55.076 --> 02:16:01.202]  Did you see the case where supposedly the NSA called a high school to tell the school to start watching one of the kids?
[02:16:02.623 --> 02:16:03.183]  No, I didn't.
[02:16:05.448 --> 02:16:16.319]  You know, see this has been my major contention that the domestic spying, the reason they're doing it is not because of terrorism, it's because it's for law enforcement and internal security.
[02:16:16.759 --> 02:16:18.761]  Domestic security, that's what they're doing it for.
[02:16:19.182 --> 02:16:23.646]  That's the main, that gives them, see when they look around after 9-11 they have to look around for a
[02:16:25.941 --> 02:16:27.242]  A customer set.
[02:16:27.542 --> 02:16:30.403]  What would be the biggest customer set they could go in for?
[02:16:30.443 --> 02:16:38.107]  That would be law enforcement because it involves local law enforcement, state and federal law enforcement everywhere as well as all around the world with other law enforcement.
[02:16:38.127 --> 02:16:44.310]  And then you set up threat fusion centers where you slowly see which cops will go along with illegal spying and then you recruit them in.
[02:16:44.650 --> 02:16:47.751]  Last year I was at Barton Springs, a big public natural spring.
[02:16:48.271 --> 02:16:51.433]  There were three cops, well three male cops and three female
[02:16:52.533 --> 02:16:55.916]  I think they were all police or in criminal justice.
[02:16:57.277 --> 02:17:08.224]  They were all laying out talking about how they were going back to get more courses because two of them already worked at the NSA Center in San Antonio and all the rest of them wanted jobs there and how great it was and how powerful they were.
[02:17:08.244 --> 02:17:09.845]  And that's what's crazy.
[02:17:10.106 --> 02:17:16.390]  It's how these people just brag about what they're involved in and are just so undisciplined on top of it.
[02:17:16.450 --> 02:17:17.451]  It's just really pathetic.
[02:17:18.044 --> 02:17:32.329]  And then back last year in August, I think it was, Reuters published that article about parallel construction and they did an interview with one of the federal agents involved in looking at the NSA data and doing parallel constructions and things like that.
[02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:36.191]  And he said, this is such a great program, I just hope we can keep it secret.
[02:17:39.656 --> 02:17:41.718]  Yeah, that's our secret government in operation.
[02:17:41.738 --> 02:17:44.341]  How about I come to their house and watch them in bed and read their email?
[02:17:44.401 --> 02:17:45.442]  No, they'd all freak out.
[02:17:45.982 --> 02:17:46.863]  These people are sick.
[02:17:46.883 --> 02:17:48.525]  Something's wrong with them.
[02:17:49.266 --> 02:17:49.906]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:50.307 --> 02:17:52.089]  Let's talk to Shane in Michigan.
[02:17:52.109 --> 02:17:52.689]  You're on the air.
[02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:53.070]  Go ahead.
[02:17:54.606 --> 02:18:04.035]  Mr. Binney, you mentioned that the NSA might come in with the National Guard to nationalize resources in Utah if that state turns off the water.
[02:18:05.116 --> 02:18:20.190]  My question is, does this mean that the NSA is, in fact, reliant on resources that are provided at the state and local levels, and that if we can't get the Congress to do anything, this might be a last-ditch effort to put a chokehold on them and stop what they're doing?
[02:18:21.317 --> 02:18:23.479]  Yeah, but I would not advocate that.
[02:18:23.559 --> 02:18:35.008]  I mean, I would advocate hitting your state and local government employees and making sure that they stand up and resist this, and also hit all your people and representatives in Congress.
[02:18:35.448 --> 02:18:40.232]  And then if they don't start going along, we need to have a unified effort to fire them, get rid of them.
[02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:41.152]  That's right.
[02:18:41.232 --> 02:18:48.178]  I mean, I'm not normally for just standard civil disobedience, and I agree with what Mr. Benny's saying in general, but the state
[02:18:49.301 --> 02:18:59.655]  Triggering a constitutional crisis, blocking water, cutting off electricity, force the National Guard in to restore the water and the power, to draw attention to it.
[02:19:00.712 --> 02:19:03.553]  I think these are the type of stunts we need to start seeing be pulled.
[02:19:03.573 --> 02:19:07.854]  I think the state government could do that, but I wouldn't advocate individuals taking action.
[02:19:07.894 --> 02:19:08.854]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:19:08.875 --> 02:19:09.495]  No, no, no.
[02:19:09.515 --> 02:19:10.915]  We don't want to be put on a terrorist list.
[02:19:11.355 --> 02:19:13.336]  And they'll call it terrorism.
[02:19:13.356 --> 02:19:16.537]  In fact, they might even bomb themselves to look like victims.
[02:19:16.557 --> 02:19:17.197]  False flags.
[02:19:17.597 --> 02:19:18.537]  The sky's the limit.
[02:19:19.058 --> 02:19:20.458]  But this has gone too far.
[02:19:20.478 --> 02:19:28.460]  It is time to have state governments peacefully start moving with injunctions and kind of like Texas is suing over Obamacare with 17 other states.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:29.201]  Yeah, right.
[02:19:29.341 --> 02:19:30.001]  It's time to say no.
[02:19:30.601 --> 02:19:39.008]  Or like I think we talked about in an earlier program that they could have a constitutional convention where the states would hold it and keep everybody in D.C.
[02:19:39.068 --> 02:19:42.510]  out of it and then modify the constitution and operate from that.
[02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:42.810]  Sure.
[02:19:43.571 --> 02:19:46.513]  Is it fair to say we now have a rogue federal government?
[02:19:47.194 --> 02:19:47.354]  Yes.
[02:19:49.608 --> 02:19:51.429]  In my view, that's exactly what we have.
[02:19:51.549 --> 02:20:00.292]  Yeah, it's like you come back from being on vacation, your employees have changed the locks, they're telling you that it's their business, their house, and they have no legal standing, but they got a bunch of guns.
[02:20:01.133 --> 02:20:01.293]  Yep.
[02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:11.677]  And they're just staring at us, telling us we're terrorists, and then we don't confront them, we go home and try to figure out how to be peaceful, and then they send a SWAT team to our home and get us out of the shower.
[02:20:12.317 --> 02:20:14.318]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:20:15.118 --> 02:20:15.818]  That's what happened to you.
[02:20:15.838 --> 02:20:17.299]  I mean, it's just, it's craziness.
[02:20:19.489 --> 02:20:25.311]  Now John Corzine and Goldman Sachs can take billions out of bank accounts and not give it back, and MF Global and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:20:26.092 --> 02:20:28.533]  I mean, it's just, we're in trouble, people.
[02:20:28.573 --> 02:20:29.853]  They are out of control.
[02:20:30.433 --> 02:20:36.996]  And historically that means they'll just power grab and power grab until everything starts collapsing.
[02:20:37.496 --> 02:20:40.337]  Jay in California, only got a few minutes left with our guest.
[02:20:40.757 --> 02:20:41.638]  Jay, thanks for calling.
[02:20:41.658 --> 02:20:42.598]  You're on the air with William Benning.
[02:20:43.894 --> 02:20:45.254]  Yeah, I'll be real brief.
[02:20:45.335 --> 02:20:57.299]  Mr. Benny, I just had to dish out a little bit of gratitude to yourself and obviously Alex Jones for bringing up this kind of stuff and this media operation for years and exposing kind of what's going on.
[02:20:57.319 --> 02:20:59.259]  And now it seems that it's an agreement.
[02:20:59.299 --> 02:21:01.200]  It's the consensus among the Republic.
[02:21:02.192 --> 02:21:02.833]  I don't know.
[02:21:24.079 --> 02:21:35.902]  For myself, I'm asking on behalf of others that I talk to that don't feel that this world government, we can all agree it's a world government, we don't believe it can be put back together.
[02:21:35.922 --> 02:21:38.943]  The Humpty Dumpty is broken and can't be put back together again.
[02:21:38.963 --> 02:21:40.003]  What would you say about that?
[02:21:41.603 --> 02:21:47.445]  Well, I would say that there are ways, we have some ways to try to help save and salvage our country.
[02:21:48.303 --> 02:22:01.312]  And one of the primary ways is to get active in politics and stand up and make sure you're, if you're going to elect somebody as a representative, that they stand up and defend the Constitution and the founding principles of this country.
[02:22:01.772 --> 02:22:06.435]  That's something that the current crop of people we have down there in Washington aren't doing right now.
[02:22:06.475 --> 02:22:08.616]  They're violating every way they possibly can.
[02:22:09.157 --> 02:22:13.740]  And they're getting everybody they possibly can to support what they're doing and cover up for them.
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:16.321]  That's right, they're circling the wagons to use
[02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:24.205]  The whistleblowers and the political awakening is a way to actually legitimize this giant usurpation of our basic freedoms.
[02:22:24.645 --> 02:22:28.066]  And if we don't start backing them off at this point, the sky's the limit.
[02:22:28.086 --> 02:22:29.787]  We've already basically reached the sky.
[02:22:30.187 --> 02:22:31.748]  We're now going out into outer space.
[02:22:31.768 --> 02:22:34.769]  A few final calls and we're going to let our gracious guests go.
[02:22:35.189 --> 02:22:37.230]  Mike in Wyoming, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:22:38.290 --> 02:22:39.231]  Hi, Mr. Penny.
[02:22:39.771 --> 02:22:42.152]  My recollection is that Perry Truman
[02:22:42.634 --> 02:22:43.275]  That's correct.
[02:22:43.295 --> 02:22:45.538]  But the funding comes out of the Department of Defense.
[02:22:59.153 --> 02:23:03.435]  So the Department of Defense splices out a set of funding for them.
[02:23:03.876 --> 02:23:10.319]  But it's under, since the FISA laws, they now have committees overseeing them and overseeing their budgets.
[02:23:10.719 --> 02:23:15.562]  But those committees have been basically usurped and are basically advocates for these agencies.
[02:23:16.812 --> 02:23:24.974]  And they tend to support them no matter what, which means that their committees get to manage larger budgets as the agencies themselves grow.
[02:23:25.355 --> 02:23:34.677]  So, from their perspective, they look at that as a positive contribution, when in fact they should be standing up for our rights and stopping these people under the FISA law alone.
[02:23:35.277 --> 02:23:37.078]  That was the reason the Church Committee said.
[02:23:37.138 --> 02:23:38.799]  That's what the Church Committee came up with.
[02:23:38.839 --> 02:23:42.440]  That's what they said, and this is how we're going to try to set up checks and balances.
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:43.580]  Well, those checks and balances
[02:23:44.381 --> 02:23:46.522]  Over time, they've proven to just outright fail.
[02:23:46.622 --> 02:23:48.183]  I mean, they're non-existent now.
[02:23:48.243 --> 02:23:50.343]  I mean, the vice courts are rubber-stamped.
[02:23:50.824 --> 02:23:56.946]  The intelligence committees are advocates for the agencies to do domestic spying, when in fact they were created.
[02:23:57.006 --> 02:24:07.470]  Their founding principles for the creation of those were to prevent spying agencies in the United States from spying on United States citizens domestically.
[02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:09.711]  And that, they've totally failed at.
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:23.305]  It is a criminal big brother revolution by bureaucrats and corporate and government interest to openly execute fraud upon us until it becomes common law precedent.
[02:24:24.125 --> 02:24:26.707]  And it is just over the top they're getting away with it.
[02:24:26.747 --> 02:24:27.447]  Mike, anything else?
[02:24:29.014 --> 02:24:29.574]  No, that's all.
[02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:29.874]  Thank you.
[02:24:30.094 --> 02:24:30.795]  Thank you very much.
[02:24:31.715 --> 02:24:37.177]  Well, folks, we are basically out of time with our guest, William Benny.
[02:24:38.178 --> 02:24:41.139]  We've got Chris, John, Truth Raider, Frank, and many others holding.
[02:24:41.159 --> 02:24:44.600]  I'll try to answer your questions as best I can.
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:48.862]  Mr. Benny, people constantly say, where are the whistleblowers?
[02:24:48.942 --> 02:24:51.343]  Where are good people in government, good people in corporations?
[02:24:51.963 --> 02:25:08.050]  Well, whether it's John Perkins, who was an economic hitman for big banks, or whether it's Colonel Schaeffer, or General Benton K. Parton, or countless other people, we have had on this broadcast, Tosh Plumley, Silica Steel, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.630]  Terry Reid.
[02:25:09.807 --> 02:25:11.088]  It's gotta be over a thousand now.
[02:25:11.589 --> 02:25:14.231]  Whistleblowers from state, federal, international level.
[02:25:15.392 --> 02:25:19.876]  Wolfgang Wardog, the head of the EU vaccine program, admitting the vaccines are tainted.
[02:25:20.637 --> 02:25:33.349]  I mean, the truth is, we actually have more people in major corporations and governments that do go public, and then the public doesn't get behind them, or listens to mainstream media demonizing them, to the point of now,
[02:25:34.943 --> 02:25:42.867]  Where they're arresting and persecuting the press, not just people that internally blew the whistle and gave up your career heading up a major agency.
[02:25:42.927 --> 02:25:51.411]  I mean, it's just, I think it's the immorality and the laziness of the American people that at the end of the day is allowing this.
[02:25:51.971 --> 02:25:56.333]  I don't think we are the progenitors of it, but we're the people that allow it.
[02:25:56.353 --> 02:26:02.036]  And as Eric Hoffer said, propaganda does not deceive people, it merely helps them deceive themselves.
[02:26:02.096 --> 02:26:03.497]  And men have to ask.
[02:26:03.937 --> 02:26:09.579]  Do they really only want SportsCenter and fantasy football over a free country and a future?
[02:26:09.879 --> 02:26:12.940]  Do women only want to go out and party and act like tarts?
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:14.981]  Or do they want to have a future for their children?
[02:26:15.021 --> 02:26:17.181]  Because we're going into bondage.
[02:26:17.241 --> 02:26:18.302]  This is only the beginning.
[02:26:18.982 --> 02:26:23.065]  We can see the fruits of this tyranny as our country and the world goes down the drain.
[02:26:23.105 --> 02:26:25.447]  They've started a global spy race now.
[02:26:26.067 --> 02:26:27.688]  So who knows what's going to come out of this.
[02:26:28.049 --> 02:26:29.690]  It's destabilizing our world.
[02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:31.491]  It's discrediting our country.
[02:26:31.551 --> 02:26:34.714]  It's discrediting our tech companies because people don't want to do business with us.
[02:26:34.774 --> 02:26:36.655]  I'm kind of ranting here at the end.
[02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:40.158]  It's just why are we allowing this to happen?
[02:26:40.438 --> 02:26:41.439]  It is so insane.
[02:26:41.499 --> 02:26:42.159]  Final comment.
[02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:46.943]  Well, yeah, you're pointing out the some of the some of the
[02:26:48.041 --> 02:26:53.822]  Some of the very short-sighted, finite thinking that people went through when they first decided to do these kinds of things.
[02:26:53.862 --> 02:26:56.103]  And I start with Cheney and his dark side business.
[02:26:56.943 --> 02:27:07.566]  Instead of focusing on doing the intelligence business and the military business in a focused, disciplined way, he went on a scatter approach.
[02:27:07.606 --> 02:27:12.627]  Let's go after everything and do everything we possibly can to ensure we get information.
[02:27:12.667 --> 02:27:15.608]  Well, I mean, it's been shown for a long time by any numbers of
[02:27:16.442 --> 02:27:24.108]  There's studies and examples, testimony from various people that torture doesn't work, and if you torture people, they'll tell you anything you want them to tell you.
[02:27:24.708 --> 02:27:39.039]  And so what that means is you need to do a disciplined approach, and I think the FBI had at one point, anyway, they were thinking that torture was not the way to go either, and that there were other ways to get the information and get it reliably.
[02:27:39.059 --> 02:27:41.841]  And certainly we knew from the Siggins business that that was true.
[02:27:42.819 --> 02:27:45.183]  They went down a very bad path there.
[02:27:45.263 --> 02:27:47.086]  They went down a very bad path everywhere.
[02:27:47.146 --> 02:27:49.390]  I think the dark side is just the bad path.
[02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.951]  That's all.
[02:27:52.113 --> 02:27:54.396]  Well, sir, you are a modern hero.
[02:27:55.237 --> 02:28:01.043]  You have gone through hell, lost your lucrative job, done so many other things to warn us.
[02:28:01.243 --> 02:28:06.990]  You raised the alarm as a modern Paul Revere, and now it's up to us to try to carry the ball.
[02:28:07.611 --> 02:28:11.035]  But I appreciate you working so hard and still going through the persecution.
[02:28:11.635 --> 02:28:12.696]  I hope you write a book.
[02:28:13.337 --> 02:28:17.363]  And now we know about all the illegal spying, which is, you know, write a book about your experiences.
[02:28:17.904 --> 02:28:20.988]  They can't stop you from writing about the persecution you've gone through.
[02:28:21.889 --> 02:28:23.732]  Really, you know, I see it as a...
[02:28:25.586 --> 02:28:44.991]  Modern Jungle, just like the jungle exposed child labor and the Rockefeller factories, I think your book or another big whistleblower book, not so much getting into the spying even, but just the response to it could be made into a film, you name it, and things like that will turn around our society.
[02:28:45.031 --> 02:28:46.231]  William Binney, thank you so much.
[02:28:47.031 --> 02:28:48.251]  Thank you for having me.
[02:28:48.271 --> 02:28:54.333]  Alright folks, there he goes, an amazing individual, and there's so many of them, and I'll tell you what's humbling about my broadcast.
[02:28:55.822 --> 02:28:57.723]  I get to talk to people like that every day.
[02:28:58.164 --> 02:28:59.104]  And I get to talk to you.
[02:28:59.945 --> 02:29:02.127]  And sometimes I get frustrated, sometimes I get rude and mad.
[02:29:02.167 --> 02:29:03.367]  It's because this is real for me.
[02:29:04.568 --> 02:29:05.869]  I've been doing this for 20 years.
[02:29:06.049 --> 02:29:06.870]  I know a lot.
[02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:11.353]  And to look at one story, I make all these connections in my mind to other data.
[02:29:11.373 --> 02:29:12.013]  It gives me a headache.
[02:29:13.214 --> 02:29:15.156]  To look at one article gives me a headache.
[02:29:15.716 --> 02:29:16.417]  Like this article.
[02:29:16.557 --> 02:29:20.600]  UNICEF calls 2014 one of the worst years on record for the world.
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:21.220]  New York Times.
[02:29:23.001 --> 02:29:24.082]  Why does that give me a headache?
[02:29:24.242 --> 02:29:25.203]  I'll tell you when we come back.
[02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:27.831]  Why does it make me feel rage?
[02:29:28.973 --> 02:29:31.075]  Why does it make me want to cry?
[02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:35.640]  I'll tell you when we come back.
[02:29:36.321 --> 02:29:38.764]  And we'll continue with your phone calls straight ahead as well.
[02:29:39.264 --> 02:29:40.626]  Benny did an hour and a half with us.
[02:29:41.326 --> 02:29:44.430]  I skipped two network breaks, you name it, because that was such important information.
[02:29:45.011 --> 02:29:47.854]  And I hope when the video of this gets posted to InfoWars.com tomorrow,
[02:29:49.025 --> 02:29:50.788]  I hope it isn't pearls before swine.
[02:29:51.509 --> 02:29:54.853]  I hope we get it out to everybody else because you are the resistance.
[02:29:54.934 --> 02:29:55.875]  You are the answer.
[02:29:56.736 --> 02:29:58.118]  You are the Paul Revere.
[02:29:58.639 --> 02:29:59.540]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.041 --> 02:30:01.643]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.585 --> 02:30:05.249]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.562 --> 02:30:20.729]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
[02:30:20.929 --> 02:30:34.717]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean Vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:30:35.157 --> 02:30:38.039]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:30:38.239 --> 02:30:39.440]  No needles, no injections.
[02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:43.703]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[02:30:44.003 --> 02:30:53.189]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true, nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.
[02:30:53.629 --> 02:30:53.990]  Secret 12.
[02:30:54.710 --> 02:31:00.054]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift, and is tailor-made to boost your New Year's resolutions.
[02:31:00.334 --> 02:31:02.475]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:16.804]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[02:31:17.044 --> 02:31:20.826]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[02:31:20.966 --> 02:31:27.089]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with Oxy Powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[02:31:27.430 --> 02:31:33.233]  Using Super Oxygenation Oxy Powder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body
[02:31:33.413 --> 02:31:41.339]  While you sleep with easy capsules, tens of thousands of individuals have used oxy powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[02:31:41.739 --> 02:31:47.063]  Even InfoWars nightly news director Rob Dew has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[02:31:47.384 --> 02:31:49.725]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[02:31:49.886 --> 02:31:51.727]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[02:31:51.807 --> 02:31:52.347]  I'd say a week.
[02:31:52.528 --> 02:31:52.968]  Seven days.
[02:31:54.069 --> 02:31:55.130]  2015 can be different.
[02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:58.212]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[02:31:58.473 --> 02:32:00.294]  Oxy Powder flushes it out.
[02:32:00.675 --> 02:32:03.417]  Secure your Oxy Powder at Infowarslife.com.

[02:32:39.465 --> 02:32:42.967]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:43.127 --> 02:32:47.089]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:47.409 --> 02:32:48.870]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:56.775]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:57.055 --> 02:32:57.895]  But for how long?
[02:32:58.196 --> 02:33:04.459]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:33:04.839 --> 02:33:07.641]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:33:15.350 --> 02:33:23.638]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:29.684 --> 02:33:36.390]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:38.732]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:44.116 --> 02:33:45.197]  In the heat of the night!
[02:33:48.501 --> 02:33:53.286]  UNICEF calls 2014 one of the worst years on record.
[02:33:55.729 --> 02:33:56.870]  For world's children.
[02:33:58.752 --> 02:34:00.414]  And they go through all over the world.
[02:34:02.803 --> 02:34:04.625]  15 million children starve to death a year.
[02:34:04.645 --> 02:34:07.507]  Another 20 million adults, they go through war.
[02:34:07.527 --> 02:34:13.652]  230 million children live in countries and areas riven by armed conflicts.
[02:34:15.353 --> 02:34:16.454]  And this is the UN.
[02:34:18.561 --> 02:34:24.702]  That goes around sterilizing people, goes around engaging in massacres, goes around destabilizing.
[02:34:24.742 --> 02:34:32.003]  But every time you're at the shopping mall or something, if a woman looks like she's a model, she's wearing a UNICEF shirt.
[02:34:32.023 --> 02:34:34.184]  Because that's how, that's what models do.
[02:34:35.124 --> 02:34:36.684]  Miss America, what do you want to do?
[02:34:36.804 --> 02:34:38.644]  I want to help UNICEF help the children.
[02:34:41.345 --> 02:34:44.686]  It's like give your money to the Red Cross and half of it goes to gun control basically.
[02:34:44.986 --> 02:34:47.166]  I'm not against you if you ever helped the Red Cross.
[02:34:48.797 --> 02:34:53.341]  What you did was good, but the organization itself is a globalist crime syndicate, in my opinion.
[02:34:54.662 --> 02:34:55.902]  Same thing with United Way.
[02:34:56.823 --> 02:34:59.065]  But the UN makes them all look like angels.
[02:35:01.167 --> 02:35:06.571]  And it says they've been orphaned, kidnapped, tortured, recruited, raped, and even sold as slaves!
[02:35:08.308 --> 02:35:10.770]  The same New York Times two years ago admitted that the U.N.
[02:35:10.810 --> 02:35:20.637]  in the Congo was going in and killing whole villages of people that wouldn't leave their own ancestral land because they had promised it as a carbon sink under the U.N.
[02:35:21.277 --> 02:35:25.780]  Oh, you can have mines over here for big corporations, but there has to be an offset now.
[02:35:26.341 --> 02:35:29.503]  This land can't have people on it, so we're going to force you off.
[02:35:29.523 --> 02:35:33.046]  I mean, I remember, it had to be like 1998.
[02:35:33.146 --> 02:35:36.068]  If somebody's got National Geographics, you say, find it for me.
[02:35:37.261 --> 02:35:39.764]  I was like 98 because I covered it on air a bunch, maybe 99.
[02:35:40.906 --> 02:35:53.622]  It was articles about Burma and a couple of the places about UN buffer zones in those countries and it showed UN troops and it said they shoot anyone trying to come in, period.
[02:35:55.066 --> 02:35:57.447]  And how they'd run people off their ancestral lands there.
[02:35:58.087 --> 02:35:59.587]  I mean, I know that's on record, they did that.
[02:35:59.607 --> 02:36:01.848]  The UN reportedly killed tens of thousands in Burma alone.
[02:36:01.888 --> 02:36:06.570]  But there it was in an article about how good it was.
[02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:08.350]  With liberals reading it.
[02:36:10.351 --> 02:36:15.452]  So see, I see an article where the UN's trying to shave the kids again.
[02:36:16.773 --> 02:36:19.013]  Remember, Prince Bernhardt founded the World Wildlife Fund.
[02:36:21.134 --> 02:36:24.035]  The other cause-celeb thing of every young college girl.
[02:36:26.963 --> 02:36:34.008]  He used it on record as a front, look it up, for running giant poaching operations in Africa.
[02:36:34.328 --> 02:36:36.449]  You know how much you can get for all that ivory and stuff?
[02:36:36.990 --> 02:36:39.351]  Especially in China where they grind it up and eat it as a medicinal?
[02:36:40.612 --> 02:36:42.453]  For tiger claws and all the rest of it?
[02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:51.959]  Last time I heard, I think a tiger claw is something like $5,000 a gram or something ridiculous.
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:53.800]  The point is that
[02:36:55.282 --> 02:36:58.105]  It'd be like Count Dracula running a blood bank.
[02:36:59.547 --> 02:37:03.471]  It's just the... The USO.
[02:37:04.972 --> 02:37:05.913]  That's how you pronounce it, right?
[02:37:07.195 --> 02:37:11.079]  What's the group they set up during World War II where the celebrities go play for the troops?
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:12.440]  Yeah.
[02:37:12.781 --> 02:37:14.683]  Great organization, does a lot of great stuff.
[02:37:14.723 --> 02:37:15.704]  Bob Hope, whole nine yards.
[02:37:17.947 --> 02:37:19.708]  Nothing against, you know, Entertainment for the Troops, or whatever.
[02:37:20.248 --> 02:37:33.314]  But it was founded by George Herbert Walker Bush's dad, Prescott Bush, when he was about to be indicted by the McCormick-Dickstein Committee, basically, for being the main Nazi collaborator, so he comes out with a thing for the troops!
[02:37:34.914 --> 02:37:45.379]  That's the thing about knowing history, is that it's so frustrating, you see one article like this, and then it makes you think of all the stuff they're doing, and it's always irritating to see the very people
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:54.525]  Involved in all this evil, posing as the good guys.
[02:37:54.745 --> 02:37:55.826]  Here's another one on the New York Times.
[02:37:57.087 --> 02:38:00.969]  Bush and CIA ex-officials rebut torture report.
[02:38:01.530 --> 02:38:05.512]  The new Senate report that's a whitewash admits the torture.
[02:38:05.972 --> 02:38:08.494]  The Democrats are just trying to score some political points.
[02:38:09.134 --> 02:38:11.116]  That's why the CIA was spying on them illegally.
[02:38:12.551 --> 02:38:14.952]  But it doesn't make Dianne Feinstein good that she's being spied on.
[02:38:14.972 --> 02:38:17.993]  See, it's just a ship of rats fighting with each other.
[02:38:18.573 --> 02:38:23.554]  But the issue here is, back when they thought they had America eating out of their hand, they admitted torture on television.
[02:38:23.834 --> 02:38:25.935]  Why, Jack Bauer tortured every night on 24.
[02:38:26.395 --> 02:38:27.175]  He was always right.
[02:38:27.195 --> 02:38:27.855]  He was a good guy.
[02:38:32.437 --> 02:38:36.858]  But they didn't torture somebody like, give us, you know, you capture a code,
[02:38:37.671 --> 02:38:41.414]  Expert who knows how the German code works show us how this machine works.
[02:38:41.434 --> 02:39:03.451]  We're gonna start chopping your fingers off What really works is we're gonna hunt your kids down in Germany and kill them We've got hit teams inside your country right now If you don't tell us that's bad enough, but that would work sometimes in an absolute emergency situation Where you know what you're going after and I'm against torture, but the claims that torture doesn't work
[02:39:04.734 --> 02:39:06.215]  It's not really completely true.
[02:39:06.835 --> 02:39:13.097]  What it really works for though is false confessions and to flip people over to be double agents and do whatever you want.
[02:39:16.298 --> 02:39:17.978]  That's what torture is really all about.
[02:39:18.578 --> 02:39:21.499]  And it's what tyrants do and upright countries don't do it.
[02:39:21.859 --> 02:39:24.180]  George Washington, if he caught his troops torturing,
[02:39:25.316 --> 02:39:27.218]  Because the British troops would torture to get intel.
[02:39:27.578 --> 02:39:28.459]  He would hang you.
[02:39:28.519 --> 02:39:28.899]  Look it up.
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:30.501]  And you know why he'd hang you?
[02:39:31.201 --> 02:39:33.664]  Because he wanted the moral high ground.
[02:39:33.704 --> 02:39:37.387]  If you got caught raping a woman, George Washington would hang you.
[02:39:39.089 --> 02:39:49.638]  And foreign generals from Germany and others came over here and really admired the colonial army because it didn't engage in war crimes.
[02:39:49.919 --> 02:39:51.060]  And everybody else did.
[02:39:53.646 --> 02:40:01.111]  And that's one reason they ended up winning the public support and winning the war because there was a moral high ground that had to be attained.
[02:40:02.972 --> 02:40:07.295]  George Washington wasn't a wimp because he didn't torture and he didn't rape and didn't loot.
[02:40:07.655 --> 02:40:09.777]  He knew he had to have the moral high ground.
[02:40:11.398 --> 02:40:19.643]  Now he did sit down every morning and sign death warrants on traitors that were working with the British who would be assassinated.
[02:40:22.745 --> 02:40:23.446]  That's not torture.
[02:40:26.354 --> 02:40:38.708]  So, that's the difference, ladies and gentlemen, and it's a guarantee that we're going to Hades in a handbasket with all the garbage that's going on.
[02:40:39.989 --> 02:40:45.756]  And I've got three children, and I love them, and I want them to have a future with your children, and that's why we've got to turn this around.
[02:40:50.666 --> 02:40:53.187]  Now, there's a story up on DrugsReport.com.
[02:40:53.227 --> 02:40:54.747]  We also have it up on Infowars.com.
[02:40:54.947 --> 02:40:56.407]  I'm going to tweet it out at RealAlexJones.
[02:40:56.807 --> 02:40:57.988]  Ann Compton on Obama.
[02:40:58.488 --> 02:41:01.808]  He launched profanity-laced tirades against the press.
[02:41:01.828 --> 02:41:10.250]  According to ABC News journalist Ann Compton, Barack Obama launched a profanity-laced tirades against the press in an off-the-record meeting with reporters.
[02:41:10.390 --> 02:41:11.511]  I've been watching Obama.
[02:41:11.531 --> 02:41:15.952]  He used to seem real slick and happy and kind of bebopping as a narcissist.
[02:41:16.352 --> 02:41:17.412]  He looks really upset now.
[02:41:18.402 --> 02:41:20.064]  Now he has acid reflux and all that stuff.
[02:41:20.484 --> 02:41:29.915]  In a C-SPAN interview, Compton also derided the president for leading the most opaque, that means hard to see through administration, of any I have covered.
[02:41:30.976 --> 02:41:32.618]  And this is just the degeneration of government.
[02:41:32.638 --> 02:41:33.539]  It's going to get worse and worse.
[02:41:34.508 --> 02:41:35.168]  I don't like Obama.
[02:41:35.188 --> 02:41:37.429]  But if it's not a crime he's committing, you don't bring up an off-the-record discussion.
[02:41:37.449 --> 02:41:38.950]  See, these journalists are a pack of rats.
[02:41:38.970 --> 02:41:40.250]  They're just as bad or worse as Obama.
[02:41:59.755 --> 02:42:05.179]  They go along with a sellout of the country, and then when they retire, they dish dirt on people that gave them confidence.
[02:42:05.739 --> 02:42:06.800]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:07.260]  Here it is.
[02:42:07.641 --> 02:42:12.664]  I have seen, in the last year, Barack Obama really angry.
[02:42:12.965 --> 02:42:13.305]  Twice.
[02:42:13.385 --> 02:42:14.406]  Both were off the record.
[02:42:14.986 --> 02:42:15.406]  times.
[02:42:16.067 --> 02:42:23.870]  One, profanity-laced, where he thought the press was making too much of scandals that he didn't think were scandals.
[02:42:24.511 --> 02:42:35.796]  Another, where he took us to task for not understanding the limits he has with foreign policy and the way he's dealing with the Middle East and Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:42:36.577 --> 02:42:38.618]  And I don't find him apologetic.
[02:42:39.338 --> 02:42:43.959]  But I find him willing to stand up to the press and look them in the eye, even though it was off the record.
[02:42:43.979 --> 02:42:45.400]  And just give us hell.
[02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:50.681]  From his point of view, he may.
[02:42:51.301 --> 02:42:54.162]  But we cover what we are allowed to cover.
[02:42:54.802 --> 02:43:04.084]  And when policy decisions... And this is all about how the press is in a fight with him, and how she was there, and she's not going to let him bust her around.
[02:43:04.484 --> 02:43:06.985]  All about her, her, her.
[02:43:10.131 --> 02:43:11.311]  Do you understand, folks?
[02:43:11.471 --> 02:43:13.152]  She was in an off-the-record meeting.
[02:43:14.692 --> 02:43:15.572]  She's not a journalist.
[02:43:16.132 --> 02:43:22.814]  See, I don't claim to be a journalist first and foremost, but if you're in an off-the-record discussion with me, it's that.
[02:43:22.974 --> 02:43:24.674]  I don't even tell crew about it.
[02:43:26.774 --> 02:43:30.235]  As soon as I'll have guests here in the break start telling me stuff off-the-record, I go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:43:30.295 --> 02:43:33.156]  I go, I trust my crew, but this isn't really off-the-record.
[02:43:33.636 --> 02:43:34.956]  You got a bunch of people listening to this.
[02:43:36.215 --> 02:43:44.402]  And to watch them, all these swollen people, because they work for mainstream media, acting like, you know, they're sycophantic journalists and I'm not.
[02:43:44.762 --> 02:43:46.583]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:55.450]  People like this woman couldn't get a William Benny on and have him say exactly right, precisely right.
[02:43:55.690 --> 02:43:57.452]  You know why I'm precisely right about the NSA?
[02:43:57.712 --> 02:43:59.073]  I've studied it for 20 years.
[02:43:59.553 --> 02:44:01.435]  I've interviewed scores of whistleblowers.
[02:44:02.555 --> 02:44:12.981]  And I'm just so sick of these sophistic, swollen, dishonorable pieces of trash up there about how they're a big journalist and they're on ABC News.
[02:44:13.262 --> 02:44:14.222]  You're a joke!
[02:44:18.145 --> 02:44:21.827]  Does she ever say in here why she's opening up about something that's off record?
[02:44:26.149 --> 02:44:27.430]  Man, you know why I get mad by her?
[02:44:27.570 --> 02:44:31.793]  I'm so sick of telling people something's off the record and then they go and blabber it everywhere.
[02:44:32.944 --> 02:44:37.887]  Because a lot of times you'll tell somebody something off the record to help them, or to give them a little tidbit.
[02:44:38.288 --> 02:44:44.732]  And in this dishonorable, un-chivalrous society, people then take that as, ooh, I better spread this, because it's really off the record.
[02:44:51.857 --> 02:44:53.218]  I want to go back to your phone calls.
[02:44:53.679 --> 02:44:56.361]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank all the listeners for your support.
[02:44:56.681 --> 02:44:58.042]  You make the broadcast possible.
[02:44:59.924 --> 02:45:11.151]  We have special offerings of collectibles in groups of 200 to 500 that only come around once at madein1776.com or m4store.com is the main site.
[02:45:11.171 --> 02:45:13.712]  You can find it under the Made in 1776 area.
[02:45:14.172 --> 02:45:23.998]  We have bronze and nickel belt buckles, one with an M16 with the Molon Lambe with a traditional Texas star.
[02:45:24.818 --> 02:45:28.180]  We have the Molon Lambe with a Spartan helmet and two cross 50 cals.
[02:45:29.474 --> 02:45:32.515]  And again, we've already had one version come out, sold out of those.
[02:45:33.015 --> 02:45:34.376]  This is the new version.
[02:45:35.096 --> 02:45:36.437]  There's only 500 of each.
[02:45:37.737 --> 02:45:40.499]  And there's 500 silver coins that are stamped.
[02:45:40.559 --> 02:45:42.920]  In fact, I'm told they're more than double stamped.
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:45.661]  These are the finest grade coins we could buy.
[02:45:45.681 --> 02:45:48.482]  I wanted to put out something really special that's a collectible.
[02:45:49.312 --> 02:45:51.553]  And there's only 500 of the Moulin Lambe.
[02:45:52.193 --> 02:45:52.993]  Come and take it.
[02:45:53.454 --> 02:45:56.675]  Spartan double-crossed swords with five spears.
[02:45:57.655 --> 02:45:59.396]  This is what you frame and put on the wall.
[02:45:59.776 --> 02:46:01.677]  And the purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:46:03.118 --> 02:46:06.299]  Just to give you an idea, these coins cost us to make $50 apiece.
[02:46:06.759 --> 02:46:08.200]  So there's not much markup there.
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:12.681]  I mean, these are one ounce, 999, whatever, you know, Troy silver.
[02:46:13.102 --> 02:46:14.122]  We're very proud of those.
[02:46:14.922 --> 02:46:16.663]  The belt buckles are $50 apiece.
[02:46:17.483 --> 02:46:18.684]  And they're made in America.
[02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:20.811]  Forged in America.
[02:46:20.931 --> 02:46:21.791]  We bought them in China.
[02:46:22.391 --> 02:46:26.194]  You know, we could have gotten them for $10 instead of $20 a piece, or $25 a piece.
[02:46:27.194 --> 02:46:28.315]  You know, doubled our profit.
[02:46:28.875 --> 02:46:32.997]  And we do have the camo, long-sleeved Molon Labe back in, the women's Molon Labe back in.
[02:46:33.457 --> 02:46:34.918]  Infowarsstore.com, Maiden1776.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:34.938 --> 02:46:37.300]  And we're basically hoping to show out of all of the Maiden 1776
[02:46:45.484 --> 02:46:46.424]  Paraphernalia!
[02:46:46.484 --> 02:46:47.745]  Patriot paraphernalia!
[02:46:48.265 --> 02:47:01.050]  As the state police in Virginia once on video, it's in my film, Road to Tyranny, they pull a woman over, naval veteran, no criminal record, and they find a pocket constitution in one of my films, and they start hyperventilating, going, this might be illegal!
[02:47:01.690 --> 02:47:06.192]  We've come a long way from the state police believing everything the Southern Property Law Center tells them.
[02:47:08.112 --> 02:47:09.593]  To not believe in a word they tell them.
[02:47:10.606 --> 02:47:12.427]  So please keep spreading the word.
[02:47:12.587 --> 02:47:18.390]  All orders, by the way, get free Citizen Rulebooks and so much more.
[02:47:18.490 --> 02:47:22.032]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:47:22.692 --> 02:47:27.775]  We still have some great specials running at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:47:27.855 --> 02:47:28.976]  In fact, some of the best of the year.
[02:47:30.188 --> 02:47:39.676]  The free shipping's gone and things like that, but now we have Super Detox Special, Fluoride Shield, and two X2 Super Nascent Iodines for 46% off.
[02:47:40.096 --> 02:47:46.721]  And the Super Detox Special, the Biodefense Pack, Survival Shield X2, and Lung Cleanse, 58% off.
[02:47:46.962 --> 02:47:49.664]  And by the way, stuff's already selling like hotcakes, but it funds the operation.
[02:47:49.944 --> 02:47:51.145]  We're just going to the next level.
[02:47:51.165 --> 02:47:52.706]  This is the time of year you do that.
[02:47:53.287 --> 02:47:55.749]  I hope you take advantage of that to give it to friends and family.
[02:47:57.366 --> 02:47:59.887]  Give them a bottle of X2 and tell them, hey, you want to detox?
[02:47:59.927 --> 02:48:00.407]  Try this.
[02:48:00.908 --> 02:48:01.828]  Consult your physician.
[02:48:02.108 --> 02:48:03.409]  Or give a bottle of Oxy-Powder.
[02:48:03.449 --> 02:48:06.070]  We finally got that back in and have that discounted.
[02:48:06.090 --> 02:48:08.291]  Talk about flushing your guts out.
[02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:09.251]  Talk about detoxing.
[02:48:09.271 --> 02:48:10.412]  Talk about getting your immune system up.
[02:48:10.952 --> 02:48:12.572]  The Oxy-Powder is back in.
[02:48:13.293 --> 02:48:15.214]  InfoWars Life Challenge Pack.
[02:48:15.234 --> 02:48:17.895]  Super Male and Super Survival Shield.
[02:48:18.695 --> 02:48:19.556]  Forty-two percent off.
[02:48:19.596 --> 02:48:22.037]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:48:22.077 --> 02:48:22.877]  Just some of the specials.
[02:48:23.278 --> 02:48:28.580]  Or when you call, they can tell you about all of the other specials that are there as well.
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:28.640]  888-253-3139.
[02:48:29.721 --> 02:48:32.382]  Thanks for holding, Chris in Nevada.
[02:48:32.783 --> 02:48:33.943]  Sorry you couldn't talk to Benny.
[02:48:33.963 --> 02:48:34.403]  Go ahead.
[02:48:35.704 --> 02:48:37.065]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:48:37.125 --> 02:48:43.628]  What a powerful guest that was to have on your show on Infowars, Mr. William Benny, CIA.
[02:48:44.749 --> 02:48:46.050]  NSA, yeah, but you're right.
[02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.350]  Go ahead.
[02:48:47.515 --> 02:48:48.195]  My apologies.
[02:48:48.775 --> 02:48:58.539]  The point I wanted to ask, and I thought it would be appropriate for Mr. Binney, but I'm sure you will appreciate also, is the attorney's skill of the black arts word crafting.
[02:48:59.759 --> 02:49:02.460]  They seem to want to deem to term this
[02:49:03.783 --> 02:49:12.228]  That's right, they call it metadata when it's everything, including full recordings of everything, patently felonies, every one of them.
[02:49:26.912 --> 02:49:37.066]  Well, and the prostitutes, of course, they like to tout these different things they've gotten from torture projects, but the truth is they've provided no actionable intel.
[02:49:39.008 --> 02:49:46.314]  Well, it's designed to actually make us blind from real threats, because the globalists run those, while spying on good people in government.
[02:49:46.354 --> 02:49:46.794]  You heard him.
[02:49:46.834 --> 02:49:50.277]  The main focus now is spying on good people.
[02:49:50.898 --> 02:50:04.048]  Imagine William Benny is secretly testifying to Congress, trying to fix things internally, the former head of the NSA, and they SWAT team him at his house when he's in the shower in the morning to mess with him.
[02:50:05.169 --> 02:50:07.371]  I mean, imagine being the FBI SWAT team.
[02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:10.651]  They're ashamed of themselves.
[02:50:33.044 --> 02:50:36.327]  I mean, it's not like they're Snowden who ran to Russia to release the info.
[02:50:36.487 --> 02:50:38.229]  But see, what was Snowden supposed to do then?
[02:50:38.849 --> 02:50:42.392]  If they're arresting people for nothing, then he did the right thing.
[02:50:42.412 --> 02:50:43.013]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:50:44.134 --> 02:50:55.644]  Well, I was just going to bring up the fact that Valerie Jenrette in the White House, who's never been vetted, is actually the Colonel Edwin Mandel House for this administration.
[02:50:56.673 --> 02:50:57.793]  You're right, and that's another thing.
[02:50:58.254 --> 02:51:01.955]  As long as you're with the system, you can leak intel everywhere, you can blabber.
[02:51:01.975 --> 02:51:06.737]  It's just, this country's in danger just for the incompetence of these crooks.
[02:51:07.757 --> 02:51:08.898]  I mean, it's just wild.
[02:51:09.558 --> 02:51:14.140]  This hour of GCN programming is proudly sponsored by BlocketPocket.com.

[02:52:09.044 --> 02:52:16.066]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[02:52:16.306 --> 02:52:20.107]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[02:52:20.227 --> 02:52:26.509]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with Oxy Powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[02:52:27.009 --> 02:52:34.951]  Using Super Oxygenation Oxy Powder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[02:52:35.211 --> 02:52:40.154]  Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[02:52:40.474 --> 02:52:42.835]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[02:52:42.995 --> 02:52:45.477]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week, I'd say a week.
[02:52:45.657 --> 02:52:46.137]  Seven days.
[02:52:46.617 --> 02:52:48.158]  And I've been able to keep it off too.
[02:52:48.438 --> 02:52:49.959]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[02:52:49.979 --> 02:52:52.400]  And I'm like, I know, I guess it's this Oxy-Powder.
[02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:54.361]  2015 can be different.
[02:52:54.481 --> 02:52:57.363]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[02:52:57.763 --> 02:53:00.726]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver.
[02:53:00.746 --> 02:53:06.012]  We've truly enjoyed the fantastic response from thousands of people as they've tried our extraordinary product.

[02:54:26.962 --> 02:54:30.624]  I want to try to take a few final phone calls right now.
[02:54:30.684 --> 02:54:33.866]  Some of the headlines I didn't get to up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:34.427 --> 02:54:37.549]  Robber with toy gun shot by a pharmacist with real gun.
[02:54:38.888 --> 02:54:41.449]  Don't bring a toy gun to a real gunfight, residents said.
[02:54:41.469 --> 02:54:46.251]  And there's video, I can't breathe, Arizona cop attacks asthmatic teen.
[02:54:46.271 --> 02:54:48.912]  Guess everybody's a UFC champ now.
[02:54:50.032 --> 02:54:56.374]  Eric Garner's wife said she doesn't feel like it's a black and white thing, but basically a police brutality thing.
[02:54:57.435 --> 02:55:00.015]  Author, America is careening towards civil war.
[02:55:00.076 --> 02:55:01.196]  Paul Watson has an article.
[02:55:03.803 --> 02:55:06.144]  That's just some of the reports coming out.
[02:55:06.204 --> 02:55:07.044]  George W. Bush.
[02:55:07.364 --> 02:55:09.105]  Hillary Clinton is my sister-in-law.
[02:55:10.246 --> 02:55:11.986]  That's what's wrong with the Bushes right there.
[02:55:13.327 --> 02:55:16.448]  Police Department mocks Garner with We Can't Breathe tweet.
[02:55:16.508 --> 02:55:17.248]  Totally sick.
[02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:20.250]  House chooses new Cold War with Russia.
[02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:22.090]  Ron Paul calls it active war.
[02:55:22.491 --> 02:55:27.833]  Some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:30.094 --> 02:55:33.295]  Black teenager shoots newlywed soldier and executes his pregnant wife.
[02:55:35.106 --> 02:55:36.406]  Race baiters are silent.
[02:55:37.247 --> 02:55:46.750]  Yeah, so much of this crime going on, black on white, is the target of criminals who are having to be black as white because it's almost like that's an okay thing now.
[02:55:48.151 --> 02:55:54.773]  Just like, I've used the analogy or historical example of people that would beat up gay folks and rob them saying, well, they're gay, they deserve it.
[02:55:55.533 --> 02:55:56.353]  This is just sick.
[02:55:57.274 --> 02:55:59.314]  Let's talk to John in California.
[02:55:59.374 --> 02:56:00.015]  You're on the air.
[02:56:00.035 --> 02:56:00.715]  Go ahead, John.
[02:56:01.698 --> 02:56:04.723]  Yes, Alex, I want to make a correction.
[02:56:04.763 --> 02:56:06.406]  The government is not rogue.
[02:56:06.606 --> 02:56:07.948]  It is totally criminal.
[02:56:08.689 --> 02:56:11.173]  And the only way to deal with criminals is by force.
[02:56:11.234 --> 02:56:13.077]  Now, who is going to force them out, Alex?
[02:56:13.818 --> 02:56:14.319]  Not us!
[02:56:15.290 --> 02:56:15.750]  The U.S.
[02:56:15.810 --> 02:56:21.494]  military must get involved and implement Operation Valkyrie because we're running out of time.
[02:56:22.534 --> 02:56:24.596]  The ballot box doesn't work anymore.
[02:56:24.676 --> 02:56:25.376]  It's broken.
[02:56:25.716 --> 02:56:26.077]  Okay?
[02:56:26.897 --> 02:56:38.304]  And if you are familiar with your history of Stauffenberg and the co-plotters, they had assembled a committee of German civilians to take over as soon as they got rid of Hitler and his henchmen.
[02:56:38.849 --> 02:56:39.791]  This is what the U.S.
[02:56:39.851 --> 02:56:40.753]  military can do.
[02:56:40.793 --> 02:56:41.955]  We're running out of time.
[02:56:41.975 --> 02:56:43.638]  They're going to start a war with Russia.
[02:56:43.978 --> 02:56:44.980]  They're itching to do it.
[02:56:45.922 --> 02:56:51.191]  We must reach out to the military and the Pentagon and have them remove the criminals.
[02:56:51.499 --> 02:56:56.741]  Well, there'd have to be a larger discussion about constitutional convention, the states coming together.
[02:56:57.422 --> 02:56:59.963]  The bankers, the globalists, the Federal Reserve have been so smart.
[02:56:59.983 --> 02:57:02.064]  They've got all the pension funds invested in the derivatives.
[02:57:02.624 --> 02:57:03.944]  They've got us so dependent.
[02:57:04.165 --> 02:57:06.225]  It's like half our heart is cancer.
[02:57:06.826 --> 02:57:10.427]  So if we cut the cancer out, it cuts half our ventricles out and we die.
[02:57:11.088 --> 02:57:18.511]  So we've got to like find some way to reduce the tumor and then remove it in pieces or something.
[02:57:19.744 --> 02:57:22.545]  Because I agree it's going to go towards heart attack and death anyways.
[02:57:23.606 --> 02:57:28.267]  The tumor keeps growing, but if we chop it out at one time, it'll kill us as well.
[02:57:29.468 --> 02:57:31.028]  You've got to first educate the public.
[02:57:32.229 --> 02:57:34.110]  And you've got to support whistleblowers.
[02:57:35.250 --> 02:57:36.170]  But I hear you, man.
[02:57:36.250 --> 02:57:36.831]  I hear you.
[02:57:36.971 --> 02:57:38.011]  It's serious.
[02:57:38.531 --> 02:57:39.692]  But it's not just the U.S.
[02:57:39.752 --> 02:57:44.073]  It's a global group of criminals that one major tentacle has grabbed us.
[02:57:44.694 --> 02:57:45.434]  So see, that's the thing.
[02:57:47.049 --> 02:57:52.670]  I mean, if the military took over and they convened the governors of the states to decide what to do, I mean, what would you do with Congress?
[02:57:52.730 --> 02:57:54.091]  Congress won't even do its job.
[02:57:54.371 --> 02:57:56.311]  They're all bought and paid for by the same people.
[02:57:56.811 --> 02:57:58.832]  Well, then who decides who to remove and who to keep?
[02:57:59.592 --> 02:58:02.252]  Usually, those type of things get worse, not better.
[02:58:03.213 --> 02:58:05.413]  So, it's a very sophisticated problem.
[02:58:05.453 --> 02:58:06.513]  I appreciate your call.
[02:58:07.833 --> 02:58:08.254]  You know what?
[02:58:08.314 --> 02:58:09.274]  I've got to end it here.
[02:58:09.594 --> 02:58:10.634]  Frank and Chris.
[02:58:12.394 --> 02:58:13.655]  Chris in Kentucky, real fast.
[02:58:13.695 --> 02:58:13.995]  Go ahead.
[02:58:14.035 --> 02:58:14.555]  Final caller.
[02:58:15.709 --> 02:58:26.161]  Yeah, Alex, we just had an article in the Courier Journal about these, after all this Ferguson, New York City problems that we've been having, now the local police department here is all of a sudden going to get cameras on their chest.
[02:58:26.722 --> 02:58:30.106]  My question about these things that I'm concerned about, this is all digital database.
[02:58:31.007 --> 02:58:32.749]  Does that information go into those cameras?
[02:58:34.352 --> 02:58:38.935]  Yes, they are going to basically keep all of it, and I'm not against it overall.
[02:58:39.355 --> 02:58:43.258]  Problem is, cops just turn them off and say they malfunction when they feel like it.
[02:58:43.378 --> 02:58:44.799]  So, you know, that's the problem.
[02:58:45.179 --> 02:58:47.941]  And then pretty soon, do we have to have cameras on us to prove we're not bad?
[02:58:51.983 --> 02:58:55.946]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:59.406 --> 02:59:00.627]  Another major health threat.
[02:59:00.667 --> 02:59:05.569]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:59:05.649 --> 02:59:08.270]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:59:08.310 --> 02:59:15.092]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:59:15.353 --> 02:59:18.214]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:59:18.334 --> 02:59:21.275]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:59:21.295 --> 02:59:23.276]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:59:23.316 --> 02:59:26.177]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:26.237 --> 02:59:31.759]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:59:31.959 --> 02:59:35.441]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:35.461 --> 02:59:38.462]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:59:38.562 --> 02:59:42.844]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[02:59:42.984 --> 02:59:44.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:13.266 --> 03:00:18.817]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:19.298 --> 03:00:20.060]  You're listening.
