[00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:18.109]  United Nations organizations are charged with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus vaccine program sponsored by the Kenyan government.
[00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:33.121]  The population control scheme was exposed after the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association sent six samples of the tetanus vaccine that was used during the World Health Organization's immunization campaign this year to laboratories in South Africa for testing.
[00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.484]  According to the doctors, all samples tested positive
[00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:37.284]  We're good to go!
[00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:16.335]  The doctors said, This proved right our worst fears, that this World Health Organization campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus, but a well-coordinated, forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.
[00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:23.298]  Now that sounds a lot like a conspiracy theory until you read the World Health Organization's own literature.
[00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:29.439]  This is a report from August 1992 titled, Fertility Regulating Vaccines.
[00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:37.041]  In it, they discuss the most advanced research on FRVs involves vaccines directed against HCG.
[00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:52.257]  As the Kenyan doctors point out, World Health Organization conducted massive vaccination campaigns using the tetanus vaccine that was laced with HCG in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua and the Philippines in 94.
[00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:55.921]  Just like with this current inoculation program in Kenya,
[00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:04.726]  These campaigns targeted women of childbearing age, 14 to 49 years old, and each received a total of five injections.
[00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.527]  A typical tetanus vaccine schedule is just three shots.
[00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:12.690]  And don't be fooled, this isn't about giving women around the world a choice.
[00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.475]  The Tetanus Lace with HCG was given as a fertility regulating vaccine without disclosing its contraceptive effect to the young girls and mothers.
[00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:24.056]  Why would the U.N.
[00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:27.299]  want to suppress the population in developing countries?
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.266]  The overlords of scientific dictatorship are ruthlessly prosecuting a war on our most defenseless.
[00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.930]  In December of 1974, the U.S.
[00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.555]  government made third world population reduction a central national security issue.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:56.274]  The operation plan titled National Security Study Memorandum 200 openly stated that populous third world nations posed a threat to the international elite's monopoly of global power.
[00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:58.917]  The Kissinger-authored U.S.
[00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:04.504]  plan targeted 13 key countries where massive population reduction was called for.
[00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:15.082]  Kissinger recommended that IMF and World Bank loans be given on condition that nations initiate aggressive population control programs, such as sterilization.
[00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:24.126]  Kissinger also recommended that food be used as a weapon, and that instigating wars was also a helpful tool in reducing population.
[00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:36.367]  In 1972, the Nixon White House also implemented a eugenics policy which was directed by George Herbert Walker Bush, then United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
[00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:47.453]  Bush advised China on the formulation of their one-child policy and directed the federal government to forcibly sterilize more than 40% of Native American women on reservations.
[00:03:49.011 --> 00:03:56.903]  And following in his eugenicist father's footsteps, Bill Gates donates millions of dollars to research population control programs.
[00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:01.330]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:04.902]  That's back from high school algebra.
[00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:06.102]  But let's take a look.
[00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.603]  First, we've got population.
[00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:11.644]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:13.725]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:22.848]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:34.805]  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is committing $10 billion over the next 10 years to make it the most aggressive decade ever, rolling out new vaccines to poor nations around the world.
[00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:39.888]  This idea of population control has been around for decades and probably much longer.
[00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:50.252]  It's backed by powerful economic interests to cull the world population of the useless feeders so corporate giants can exploit world resources unimpeded.
[00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:04.951]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:15.102]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:19.183]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:24.404]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:31.025]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:05:31.325 --> 00:05:33.605]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:36.726]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:42.607]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:05:43.047 --> 00:05:49.716]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
