[00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.512]  Alright, it's the Info Wars crew review of Captain America Winter Soldier.
[00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:07.252]  We got the crew here.
[00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:08.893]  We got Chris from our shipping department.
[00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:11.154]  Of course, Leanne McAdoo, Beast Mode.
[00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.775]  Kit Daniels wrecking up the press conferences.
[00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.396]  So, we're going to give you the review.
[00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:16.817]  This is a spoiler alert.
[00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:17.657]  Spoiler alert.
[00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.978]  We're going to ruin this whole movie or I'm going to do my best to.
[00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:21.939]  Alright, first of all, let's talk about S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.080]  Because in the comics, S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.081]  is more of a black ops deal, the way they portray it.
[00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:26.781]  Absolutely.
[00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:27.762]  It's like you have to choose a side.
[00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:28.042]  America
[00:00:53.843 --> 00:01:01.745]  Has been infiltrated and the scientist, I mean you see just how far this goes back, how far back the plan goes.
[00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:19.648]  Here he's working with analog computing and it really reminds me of Ray Kurzweil going to work with Google because only can Kurzweil, this mad scientist who wants to upload his mind and live forever and upload his brain, he needs Google in order to have that computing power to make this happen.
[00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:23.149]  So it's almost like we're going to see that happening in the future.
[00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:37.961]  And they're dealing with analog here in this movie, where Captain America, that's what he represents, and then his friend slash foe represents, you know, the science that's going beyond what Kurzweil's science is gonna do.
[00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:47.689]  And there it's almost asking that question, like, at what point, when you merge man and machine, do you, you know, are you able to remain human?
[00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:49.771]  And it's amazing.
[00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:53.729]  Speaking of those two, the two boys that knew each other, the two, the enemy.
[00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.310]  Marcos Morales, Civil War's nightly news director.
[00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.270]  Famous button pusher.
[00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.152]  Those two brothers were at odds and it was like a metaphor for a civil war type of mentality.
[00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.473]  And you saw that with their arms build up.
[00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:18.019]  Before Nick Fury reveals the entire arsenal they've been building up that will be taken over by evil forces, he justifies the arms build up by talking about a story about his grandfather showing a gun in a self-defense situation.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.860]  And he said,
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.502]  My grandfather loved people, but he didn't trust them very much, and he justified the arms buildup to himself.
[00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:28.383]  And then, we see later, of course, the bad guy comes in.
[00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:35.985]  They take the weapons, they turn them on the people who they were meant to protect, and he justifies it the same way, or a different way, to himself.
[00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:37.266]  Pretty much the same way.
[00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.286]  We have the same motives.
[00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:43.928]  Peace, order, but he went the route of stripping people of their freedoms, taking away things from people.
[00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:47.570]  Killing people in order to provide order and peace.
[00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:48.711]  That's exactly right.
[00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:52.194]  And I liked how Nick Fury's grandpa was a concealed carrier.
[00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:53.555]  I love that aspect to it.
[00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:55.697]  Now let's see Superstar Rider Kit Daniels.
[00:02:56.218 --> 00:03:02.443]  The whole movie is like something the project of New American Century or some other neoconservative think tank would dream of.
[00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:12.050]  One thing I noticed references to total information awareness where everything that our past behavior is known to them so they can predict what we're going to do in the future.
[00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:16.652]  And it's also, it's like the surveillance state in the movie is a given.
[00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:24.693]  We see them trying to shut down like stoplights and videotaping everybody through all sorts of cameras and securities, lenses, and so on and so forth.
[00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:35.015]  And in a way, it's a little bit sad to me that there's not really, like in movies like this, there's not a discussion beforehand about it.
[00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:35.675]  It's just a given.
[00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:41.416]  Like, there's not a discussion, there's hardly a discussion, but there should be.
[00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:43.095]  That's exactly right.
[00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:45.897]  Now, there's another angle of the Winter Soldier himself.
[00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:48.218]  He's kind of an MKUltra type character, right?
[00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:56.901]  So he's this guy, he was lost in the first Captain America movie, he comes back, has no memory of his training, of who Captain America himself is.
[00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:59.702]  So he has a, you know, kind of MKUltra thing going on.
[00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:05.725]  And big spoiler for everybody who has actually seen the movie, if you watched to the end credits and you didn't know who the people were, who were
[00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.329]  In the cages, those are Magneto's children Quicksilver and also the Scarlet Witch.
[00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.613]  I do believe they're going to be in the next X-Men movie so you can watch out for that.
[00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:15.797]  Any final thoughts guys on this film?
[00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:17.720]  What would you guys give it on the Paul Revere?
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.962]  Let's start with Chris.
[00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:21.084]  Chris, what do you think?
[00:04:22.605 --> 00:04:24.408]  One to five Paul Revere's, five being the best.
[00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:25.389]  What do you think about this movie?
[00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:27.199]  Thumbs up on the number six.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.661]  Give it a thumbs up.
[00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:29.562]  You say, oh six?
[00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:31.144]  Six Paul Revere.
[00:04:31.164 --> 00:04:32.085]  Okay, all right.
[00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:41.177]  Let's say four and a half, but one thing I will mention is what I really like how Captain America is portrayed in this movie is that he is national sovereignty.
[00:04:41.858 --> 00:04:42.239]  He is
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.901]  In a way, he's like the symbolism of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:47.421]  He's the one thing that's standing.
[00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:50.182]  His shield is literally a shield.
[00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:52.483]  His weapon of choice is a defense symbol.
[00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:53.023]  Exactly.
[00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:56.865]  So, it's like he's standing up to globalists, in a sense.
[00:04:57.605 --> 00:04:59.306]  And that's something we should all inspire to be.
[00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:00.486]  We should all be Captain America.
[00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:01.403]  Mmm.
[00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:02.844]  InfoWars crew?
[00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:03.984]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:04.684]  Leah, what do you think?
[00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:06.605]  What do you think on a scale of one to five, Paul Revere?
[00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:08.306]  I'm gonna have to say four and a half.
[00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:10.026]  I mean, I think it was pretty amazing.
[00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:11.267]  I really enjoyed it.
[00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:22.251]  And just for the entertainment aspect, it's amazing, but it's definitely gonna get the subliminal messages into the masses about, you know, the globalists and the powers that be up there clinking their champagne glasses.
[00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:29.394]  Like, they think that they're building a better world by destroying the world, the America that was created.
[00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:41.836]  Yeah, and I gotta give it to Marvel, because we saw movies that straight up sucked, like Iron Man 3, but they had the false flag angle, they had the puppet dictator angle, talking about Bin Laden and all this other stuff going on.
[00:05:42.457 --> 00:05:46.962]  So, I like what Marvel's doing as opposed to what DC's doing in the movies with, for example,
[00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.831]  The second Batman movie, The Dark Knight Returns, and Batman's like, I have to spy on you to keep you safe.
[00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:54.693]  And Batman's my favorite character, but I didn't like that aspect of this thing.
[00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:57.335]  So Marvel, I think they're doing pretty well overall.
[00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.116]  I'll give this one 4.5.
[00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:04.962]  I think the original Captain America, to a mass audience, is probably more entertaining, but for people who are awake,
[00:06:05.382 --> 00:06:05.762]  Absolutely.
[00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:06.883]  Something you should all go see.
