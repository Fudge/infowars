[00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:03.819]  I'm here in Austin, Texas for a little speaking engagement tonight, book reading.
[00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:12.705]  We're going to have some fun with Brave New Books, and I'm really excited to be escorted through Austin with Come and Take It, and we're going to be going on a little open carry march here through Austin.
[00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:28.757]  For people that appreciate the activism that I've done and the fact that there are a lot of people who have had their rights taken away, it's nice to know that there are those willing to stand up and at least look out for me while I'm here, and I feel like I've got the best armed escort I could possibly hope for.
[00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:37.260]  Last Independence Day I was at Freedom Plaza, very ironically named, in between the White House and the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
[00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:47.805]  And I loaded a shotgun and racked it in an act of civil disobedience in order to bring attention to the idea that self-defense is a civil right and the government doesn't care about our rights.
[00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:52.126]  I went to an event called One Million Moms for Gun Control.
[00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:53.107]  It was a few thousand.
[00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:56.928]  And I had a sign that said, you know, how will you take my guns away?
[00:00:57.048 --> 00:00:58.429]  I'm a gun owner, let's talk.
[00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:06.372]  And I feel a little naive in how this played out as someone who makes a living talking about the threat that government represents.
[00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:22.678]  And, you know, silly me, I expected that I might get a fair shot at a constitutional trial or, you know, some absurd idea like that, when in reality this ended up leading to the second time they sent more men after me than bin Laden with a SWAT team raid on my home.
[00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:33.161]  I actually got one helicopter more than they sent after Bin Laden as well, an armored vehicle, over 40 officers, and I ended up doing four months in jail, including two months in solitary confinement.
[00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.502]  So, that's how they will take your guns away.
[00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:37.102]  That's what gun control looks like.
[00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:46.205]  And, you know, I definitely underestimated the cost to myself as a result of that civil disobedience, but by paying that cost, we raised a lot of awareness, we spread the message to a lot of people.
[00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:54.369]  And those people that are dealing with it got a heavy dose of it through local television, where they loved playing that 22-second video over and over every time I went to court.
[00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.854]  We are the final American revolution.
[00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:06.816]  I've matured in ways that I didn't think were possible from it over this past year.
[00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:11.999]  And I got a lot of meditation time in my government-induced, taxpayer-funded spiritual retreat.
[00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.073]  I'm moving to Los Angeles to relaunch Adam Vs. The Man, apply the lessons that I've learned the hard way over this past year.
[00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:25.256]  For anybody that wants to help, I got out of jail and really was starting from scratch with everything that was stolen from me while I was in jail.
[00:02:26.677 --> 00:02:36.762]  I had a lot of people stab me in the back while that was going on, so I'm starting from scratch here and there are a lot of people helping me get back on my feet and I really appreciate everybody who stood by me during this time.
[00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:39.464]  AdamVsTheMan.com, we need all the help we can get.
[00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:53.425]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:56.007]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:02:56.307 --> 00:03:06.014]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:14.557]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% Made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:17.298]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:21.959]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.220]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.001]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:32.283]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:33.124]  We're good to go.
