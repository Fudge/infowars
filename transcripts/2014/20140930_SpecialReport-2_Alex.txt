[00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:16.398]  And in other tech news, the FBI is upset with Google and Apple over privacy issues related to their smartphones.
[00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:32.454]  FBI Director James Comey has sharply criticized Apple and Google for developing forms of smartphone encryption so secure that law enforcement officials cannot easily gain access to information stored on the devices, even when they have valid search warrants.
[00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:49.261]  These new safeguards may help thwart the hacker at your neighborhood coffee shop, but I'm very skeptical of how much of a hurdle they'll be to your big alphabet agencies, especially when you consider how Apple, Google, and especially the FBI are alleged participants in the PRISM spying scandal.
[00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:54.663]  Google has even said that Gmail users have no reasonable expectation of privacy.
[00:00:55.223 --> 00:01:03.568]  And for law enforcement agencies with lesser budgets, your local PDs and sheriffs, they still have ways of acquiring your information without warrants, of course.
[00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:10.792]  In Seattle, police have used Wi-Fi mesh networks to track people via cell phones, and also without their permission.
[00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:22.058]  I chatted with an industry insider who told me that law enforcement, as well as ordinary hackers, can hack into your cell phone and listen to your real-time conversations if they have the proper equipment.
[00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:29.464]  You know, they can do a lot of different things by controlling the little computer that you have in your hand that you use to talk on.
[00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:43.297]  And you made a very interesting statement, because a lot of people think it's a conspiracy theory, so to speak, think that somebody can hack into your phone and just, as you said, turn on your microphone and listen to what you're saying, but you're saying that that is, in fact, factual and happening?
[00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.347]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:52.593]  In closing, if in fact Apple and Google have turned over a new leaf, they've done it after years of farming your information.
