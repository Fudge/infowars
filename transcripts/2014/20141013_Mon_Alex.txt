[00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:11.580]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.181]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:14.723]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:18.927]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:23.031]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:37.060]  It's October 13th and it's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.505]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:41.987]  Again, huge show lined up.
[00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:49.037]  We've got Wayne Madsen coming up in the next hour to talk about the NSA, ISIS and the Ukraine-Russia situation.
[00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:50.979]  David Knight in studio.
[00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.183]  He's going to pop in on a couple of occasions with the latest breaking news.
[00:00:55.183 --> 00:00:59.667]  We've also got Anthony Gucciardi on his experience this weekend.
[00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:06.814]  He went to an Alice Cooper concert in Houston and basically was faced with TSA style grope down procedures.
[00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:10.978]  We're going to get into that and a lot more as well as your calls.
[00:01:10.978 --> 00:01:12.859]  Top story on Drudge Report right now.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.261]  WHO says Ebola is most severe acute health emergency in modern times.
[00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.142]  This has just been posted up on the Drudge Report.
[00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:25.943]  The Ebola outbreak is the most severe acute modern health emergency.
[00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:27.863]  The World Health Organization has warned.
[00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:36.645]  The agency's Director General, Margaret Chan, said the epidemic has proved the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained and threatening public health emergency.
[00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:45.808]  She added that new cases of Ebola are now rising exponentially in the three hardest hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
[00:01:45.808 --> 00:02:03.374]  So, the WHO again, which has treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves, in contrast to the CDC, is sounding the alarm bells, but that doesn't seem to be much of a concern for NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman.
[00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:09.077]  Now this is the woman, if you remember, back in 2009 during the swine flu outbreak.
[00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:14.321]  She went on MSNBC and said, quote, get your damn vaccine.
[00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:18.363]  Now she's being caught violating a quarantine order.
[00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:24.247]  She was in contact, worked directly with cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who has Ebola.
[00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:25.428]  He's an Ebola victim.
[00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:26.929]  She worked directly with him.
[00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:34.066]  Now she's violating a quarantine order in New York to go and fetch her favourite soup.
[00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:34.967]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:45.560]  We're going to play the clip from back in 2009 where she pimped vehemently for the pharmaceutical industry and said, get your damn vaccine, stop questioning the government.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.202]  There you see the article out of the Daily Mail.
[00:02:47.742 --> 00:02:55.811]  Now she's violating the quarantine having been in contact with an Ebola victim to go and fetch her favourite soup.
[00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:57.673]  Stunning hypocrisy.
[00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:00.637]  We're going to get into that clip in the next segment.
[00:03:00.637 --> 00:03:01.838]  Reuters is reporting
[00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.965]  Doctors are furious at the CDC for blaming the Texas nurse who got Ebola from a patient.
[00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:12.291]  Of course, yesterday it emerged that there was a second case of Ebola in Dallas.
[00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:14.093]  We covered that on the show yesterday.
[00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:17.016]  But now again the CDC, it seems, is passing the buck.
[00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:24.780]  Blaming the Texas nurse who contracted the virus from Duncan Patient Zero there in Dallas.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.304]  Of course, we know that she was wearing the full protective gear, that she should not have contracted the virus if proper precautions were taken.
[00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:38.147]  The CDC is basically blaming the hospital, blaming the nursing question.
[00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:40.388]  And again, no questions are being asked about
[00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:49.756]  If this hospital received the proper training to deal with Ebola, we know that they did receive some level of training before patient zero arrived.
[00:03:49.756 --> 00:03:54.681]  Whether that was enough to cope with that situation, obviously not in this case.
[00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:57.263]  And again, more questions about has the virus mutated?
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.765]  Is it being communicated more easily than we're being told?
[00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:09.412]  The more questions we ask of the CDC, the more the CDC seems to pass the buck and blame other people.
[00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:17.180]  Of course, we had the story on Friday where doctors were desperately calling the CDC to report potential Ebola cases.
[00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:23.205]  50% of the time, they were getting the runaround or being ignored completely.
[00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:33.393]  So again, as the CDC fails forward in its mission to control this Ebola outbreak, it's now blaming other people, blaming the hospital, blaming the nurse.
[00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:38.114]  We're going to get into more news about Ebola, the economy as well.
[00:04:38.114 --> 00:04:42.655]  David Knight in studio is going to throw some fresh perspective on other news issues.
[00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:53.438]  We've got NSA whistleblower Wayne Madsen coming up in the second hour, and Anthony Gucciardi to talk about his experience in Houston this past weekend, getting broke down by the security.
[00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:54.778]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:04:54.778 --> 00:04:56.218]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:56.218 --> 00:04:57.719]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:58.399]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:04.240]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.506]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:17.931]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:20.453]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.535]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:05:30.953 --> 00:05:34.594]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:34.594 --> 00:05:38.875]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:40.675]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:48.517]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:49.658]  But for how long?
[00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:56.299]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:59.120]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:07.294]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:11.856]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:16.418]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:19.760]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.202]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:32.586]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:36.728]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:41.490]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:50.295]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:54.718]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:59.921]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:10.454]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:20.162]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:20.362 --> 00:07:30.749]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:35.412]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[00:07:35.412 --> 00:07:37.633]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:40.394]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:46.058]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:51.401]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:56.904]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[00:07:56.904 --> 00:07:57.364]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:15.335]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:17.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.893]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:35.615]  Top story on Infowars.com right now.
[00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:38.939]  Ebola expert virus may soon go airborne.
[00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:51.572]  Of course, we've had many concerns voiced about this over the past several weeks, not least of which was the 2012 Canadian study before that, which found that the Ebola virus could be transmitted from pigs to monkeys.
[00:08:51.972 --> 00:08:54.515]  We're not in direct contact with each other.
[00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:56.637]  So now we have another expert.
[00:08:56.637 --> 00:09:02.123]  This is the top story up on Infowars.com saying the Ebola virus may soon go airborne.
[00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:07.308]  Dr. David Sanders of Purdue University told RTV6 on Sunday.
[00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:12.194]  Ebola is primed to have respiratory transmission.
[00:09:12.194 --> 00:09:13.815]  So more concerns about that.
[00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:14.756]  There you see the article.
[00:09:14.756 --> 00:09:18.120]  We'll play the video a little later in the show.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.167]  The WHO is saying that Ebola is the most severe acute health emergency in modern times.
[00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:24.708]  Something which
[00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:36.492]  Doesn't seem to be much of a concern for NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman, who was in contact with an Ebola victim, Ashoka Mukpo.
[00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:37.673]  He visited Africa.
[00:09:37.673 --> 00:09:42.475]  A cameraman working for NBC came back, had contact with Nancy Snyderman.
[00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:56.123]  She was put under a mandatory quarantine order for 21 days and she almost immediately violated that order to carry out the important task of going to fetch her favourite soup.
[00:09:56.123 --> 00:09:57.504]  And why is that of interest?
[00:09:57.504 --> 00:09:58.365]  Well, because back in 2009...
[00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:05.669]  Snyderman appeared on MSNBC during the swine flu hysteria.
[00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:09.932]  Of course, that was a completely fabricated, fear-mongering event.
[00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:13.274]  They had the vaccine lined up before the outbreak.
[00:10:13.274 --> 00:10:21.098]  The threat of swine flu was minimal to the vast majority of the population, not only in the United States but worldwide.
[00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:27.042]  But they pushed the hysteria, they fanned the flames of panic in order to sell that vaccine.
[00:10:27.682 --> 00:10:37.764]  Of course Wolfgang Wodog of the EU Health Council came out almost immediately after the outbreak was revealed to say that it was a complete scam.
[00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:50.848]  The false pandemic drug firms cashed in on scare of a swine flu says Euro Health Chief and he actually committed the parliamentary investigation into that and found that it was a complete hoax.
[00:10:50.848 --> 00:10:56.269]  Yeah, all around the world these vaccines were sold, were bought by governments, wasting huge amounts of money
[00:10:56.989 --> 00:11:06.031]  Many people actually got sick from the side effects of the vaccine and it was a complete scam, a complete hoax to make money for Big Pharma.
[00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:15.734]  And Snyderman is no greater cheerleader for Big Pharma as she proved in a 2009 MSNBC appearance which we're going to go to now.
[00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:16.194]  Roll the clip.
[00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:17.735]  Look, this is one time.
[00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:19.335]  Forget the conspiracy.
[00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:21.056]  Listen to our government agencies.
[00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.636]  These guys are telling the truth.
[00:11:22.636 --> 00:11:24.657]  You know, there's no conspiracy here, folks.
[00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:26.498]  Just get your damn vaccine.
[00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:27.138]  All right.
[00:11:27.138 --> 00:11:27.998]  Thank you, doctor.
[00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:28.838]  Thank you, thank you.
[00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:29.779]  No, no, listen.
[00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.379]  I like when my doctor says damn.
[00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:35.306]  Get your damn vaccine!
[00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:52.858]  So she's so concerned about public health, she's urging people to get the vaccine back in 2009 during the swine flu hoax, fear-mongering hysteria pandemic, which was ginned up by the pharmaceutical industry in alliance with major governments.
[00:11:52.858 --> 00:12:02.745]  But now the Mail Online reports NBC chief medical correspondent accused of violating Ebola quarantine to visit her favorite soup restaurant.
[00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:03.066]  And again,
[00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:09.952]  She had contact with an Ebola victim, a cameraman working for MSNBC.
[00:12:09.952 --> 00:12:22.443]  The NBC News crew exposed to Ebola were forced into mandatory quarantine after Chief Medical Correspondent Nancy Snyderman violated their voluntary isolation to visit her favourite soup restaurant, reports revealed.
[00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:26.887]  The 62-year-old was one of the seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days
[00:12:28.488 --> 00:12:34.053]  As doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the deadly disease.
[00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:43.660]  So she's happy to pimp for Big Pharma and remember that Big Pharma spends more money on advertising than it does on actual research and development.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:50.385]  It's a profit-driven industry to sell vaccines, to sell drugs, whether they actually have an effect or not.
[00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:51.986]  And we know in the case of the 2009 swine flu outbreak,
[00:12:54.008 --> 00:12:58.291]  That it was a completely contrived hoax to sell vaccines.
[00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:02.633]  The swine flu virus itself was not a threat to the vast majority of people.
[00:13:02.633 --> 00:13:06.016]  It was only a threat to the elderly, the ill or the young.
[00:13:06.016 --> 00:13:09.818]  So huge numbers of the population had no need to take this vaccine.
[00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:17.763]  They did anyway, simply because of the corporate media brainwashing campaign, behind which lay people like Snyderman.
[00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.664]  Get your damn vaccines!
[00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:20.225]  And now she's
[00:13:20.965 --> 00:13:30.857]  Waltzing around New York to pick up her favorite soup after she's been ordered to be under quarantine for 21 days because she could have been exposed to Ebola.
[00:13:30.857 --> 00:13:33.099]  Again, the heights of hypocrisy.
[00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:33.860]  No, no bounds.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.407]  And it just proves that this individual and many like her who go on the mainstream media to promote
[00:13:39.907 --> 00:13:48.411]  Vaccines to promote drugs are simply pimping for the pharmaceutical industry and have no actual concern about public health whatsoever.
[00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:54.975]  We're going to go to Joe Biggs now, who is on the border, again staying with the Ebola situation.
[00:13:54.975 --> 00:13:57.336]  He's there in McAllen, Texas.
[00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:07.601]  So Joe, from the people you've talked to, do you think there's genuine concern about the Ebola outbreak and the potential of individuals coming across the border infected with Ebola?
[00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:09.772]  JoeBiggsInfoWars.com.
[00:14:09.772 --> 00:14:19.695]  I'm actually standing right outside of the Rio Grande Regional Hospital, one of the frontline spots right here at the border in case illegals do come across with Ebola.
[00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:30.457]  And yes, there are people that have concerns about this, you know, because when the government comes out and says there's nothing to worry about whatsoever, most people know that's when you need to worry.
[00:14:30.457 --> 00:14:36.919]  That's the scary time to start really hunkering and thinking about what you need to do to protect yourself and your family.
[00:14:37.352 --> 00:14:44.815]  You know, Alex shot a video yesterday of the General of South Com coming out saying that he spent some time in Costa Rica at an embassy.
[00:14:44.815 --> 00:14:54.220]  He spoke with an individual there saying that they had Liberians that were coming into Trinidad and then moving their way up into America wanting to go into New York.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.760]  So that's a big threat right there.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.161]  They're worried that if Ebola does
[00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:00.278]  We're good to go.
[00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:30.359]  And the amount of people they're going to infect and, uh, you know, touch and come in contact with on the way up here is, uh, will be hard to track.
[00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:31.540]  So that's a big threat.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:41.164]  The threat of illegals coming through South America into Mexico and then smuggling themselves all the way into here and taking Tylenol and things like that to keep their fever down so they can get through.
[00:15:41.164 --> 00:15:46.507]  And then once they hear they show signs and symptoms, someone's going to pick them up and bring them to a facility just like that here.
[00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:52.130]  So I want to go in here today and see if I can find out whether or not this place is equipped
[00:15:52.642 --> 00:16:03.068]  To handle an Ebola patient and what steps they're looking at right now to help combat that and whether or not the CDC is involved with letting them know what to or not do.
[00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:13.515]  That's interesting because we've had nurses protesting over the past few weeks about how they have received basically no training whatsoever to deal with Ebola.
[00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:31.225]  So there are four, from what I read, four facilities within the United States to the bio-level security level where they could actually deal with successfully these Ebola patients, that they could handle up to ten Ebola patients, I believe the story read.
[00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.747]  So you're going to go in there and ask questions, what are you going to ask them?
[00:16:34.497 --> 00:16:40.861]  Well, I'm going to ask them what their protocol is so far, or if they have a protocol.
[00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:42.002]  Let's start off with that.
[00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.324]  If they have a protocol, do they have the equipment?
[00:16:44.324 --> 00:16:46.966]  Are they able to contain someone?
[00:16:46.966 --> 00:16:54.671]  Do they have the means and the money to actually go out and do that contract tracing?
[00:16:54.671 --> 00:17:01.016]  Are the first line responders, the EMTs that are bringing patients in via ambulance, up to speed on what's going on?
[00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:04.178]  Or have they done anything to that nature whatsoever?
[00:17:04.471 --> 00:17:13.393]  So I'd be surprised to see if this hospital, which is one of the main ones in the area where many illegals come through, if they're going to be equipped to handle that, if it happens.
[00:17:13.393 --> 00:17:18.275]  And then another thing you were talking about earlier, Paul, that I thought was kind of interesting about the vaccines, the flu.
[00:17:18.275 --> 00:17:25.077]  Last night I was watching the show on Fox News, Justice with Judge Jeanine, and she had a doctor on from New York.
[00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.817]  And Judge Jeanine, she goes,
[00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:31.944]  Well, how are we going to stop the confusion of all these patients with flu-like symptoms coming in?
[00:17:31.944 --> 00:17:33.304]  He said, go get your flu shot.
[00:17:33.304 --> 00:17:34.565]  Go get your flu shot.
[00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:43.290]  Because he says, if everyone gets their flu shot, then if you come in with flu-like symptoms, we can take it more seriously and know it'll stop confusion in our emergency rooms.
[00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:46.883]  And Joe, I mean, we had a conversation before.
[00:17:46.883 --> 00:17:54.506]  You're quite prepared to go to West Africa, to these places that have been directly impacted with Ebola, and report from there.
[00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:55.806]  Isn't that the case?
[00:17:55.806 --> 00:18:08.971]  Yes, I'm willing to do whatever I have to do to expose and get to the bottom of the truth and find out what the CDC is not telling us, whether or not this is a complete and total hoax, or if this is really a legitimate thing that we should be worried about as Americans.
[00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:09.931]  I'd like to get to the bottom of that.
[00:18:11.052 --> 00:18:13.937]  Alright, Joe Biggs reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:18:13.937 --> 00:18:17.684]  We may get an update from you later in the show, if not, on the nightly news.
[00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:18.465]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:26.204]  Okay, there goes Joe Biggs at the border there, reporting on the Ebola situation.
[00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:33.349]  RT is reporting suspected Ebola carrier wrapped in plastic after Czech police seal off rail station.
[00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:40.934]  And this was basically an individual who arrived on a flight from West Africa, then he went through a train station in the Czech Republic.
[00:18:40.934 --> 00:18:49.240]  They basically put a black plastic bag over his head, again taking extreme precautions there, and took him to a hospital.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.461]  It later turned out that he
[00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:52.402]  He only had a cold.
[00:18:52.402 --> 00:18:58.248]  So again, it's the question about getting the balance between people who are genuinely showing symptoms of Ebola.
[00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:07.818]  There you see the video of this individual being wheeled through the train station in the Czech Republic after having arrived with Ebola-like symptoms.
[00:19:07.818 --> 00:19:10.581]  Later turned out he basically only had a cold.
[00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:14.763]  So again, there's this balance between hysteria and fear-mongering.
[00:19:14.763 --> 00:19:26.929]  We know that the Ebola tests which are currently being imposed at airports, and in some cases not at all as we will see after the break, can be fooled by ibuprofen and other medicines.
[00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:31.834]  And yet, people with colds are now being wheeled off as potential Ebola victims.
[00:19:31.834 --> 00:19:34.578]  So, this could escalate really quickly.
[00:19:34.578 --> 00:19:41.386]  This could get to a panic phase where anybody with flu is treated as a potential Ebola victim.
[00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:43.168]  So, we've got to watch out for that.
[00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:46.652]  In the coming days and weeks, that could escalate very quickly.
[00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:49.735]  After the break, we're going to get into more Ebola news.
[00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:52.617]  David Knight coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:52.617 --> 00:19:55.499]  Wayne Madsen, NSA whistleblower, coming up in the next hour.
[00:19:55.499 --> 00:19:56.580]  Going to take your calls.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.641]  It's the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.

[00:20:05.694 --> 00:20:10.437]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that gives your skin rashes?

[00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:33.904]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:20:33.904 --> 00:20:35.705]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:38.187]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:20:38.187 --> 00:20:39.788]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:41.749]  If passed, H.R.
[00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:44.150]  5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.312]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[00:20:46.312 --> 00:20:49.433]  We offer the most affordable Level 3 body armor on the market.

[00:20:58.019 --> 00:20:58.799]  KD Armor.
[00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.660]  Come and take it.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.424]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[00:21:03.424 --> 00:21:07.589]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:08.890]  What are you doing to prepare?
[00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.754]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[00:21:12.754 --> 00:21:14.316]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:15.037]  The total amount of
[00:21:15.077 --> 00:21:15.557]  Debt in the U.S.
[00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:19.300]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:31.690]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger, and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:39.777]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[00:21:40.057 --> 00:21:46.503]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[00:21:46.503 --> 00:21:47.744]  The crash is coming.
[00:21:47.744 --> 00:21:50.327]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[00:21:50.327 --> 00:21:53.129]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:21:53.129 --> 00:21:54.671]  That's babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[00:22:00.703 --> 00:22:02.124]  It's already too late.
[00:22:02.124 --> 00:22:04.785]  Criminals have kicked in your door and are now in your home.
[00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:06.967]  Before this happens, homeowners have a choice.
[00:22:06.967 --> 00:22:11.209]  One, do nothing and hope you aren't one of the 1.4 million families attacked each year.
[00:22:11.209 --> 00:22:12.990]  Or two, refuse to be a victim.
[00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.252]  And for as low as $59, reinforce your doors with Door Devils.
[00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:21.876]  Door Devils simply attach to existing door frames and have proven to stop the biggest bad guys from kicking in doors.

[00:22:25.258 --> 00:22:26.758]  Alarms don't stop kick-ins.

[00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:28.459]  Doordevil.com.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.883]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[00:22:34.883 --> 00:22:36.885]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[00:22:36.885 --> 00:22:40.667]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:44.850]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:51.574]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.

[00:22:58.922 --> 00:23:03.305]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:07.388]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[00:23:07.388 --> 00:23:12.853]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?

[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:38.170]  Are Saudi Arabia and Israel involved in a secret alliance and were they also involved in plotting and carrying out the 9-11 attacks?
[00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.894]  We're going to get into that with Wayne Madsen in the next hour.
[00:24:41.894 --> 00:24:47.120]  Going back to Ebola news though, of course we had the clip before the break, NBC's chief medical correspondent.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:54.282]  Lecturing everybody on how they should trust the government and get their swine flu vaccine back in 2009.
[00:24:54.282 --> 00:25:03.344]  Then herself violating the quarantine order to carry out the important task of fetching her favourite soup in New York.
[00:25:03.344 --> 00:25:11.647]  Now we also have doctors returning from Nigeria saying that they receive zero checks whatsoever when they travel through airports.
[00:25:11.647 --> 00:25:12.687]  We're going to go to that clip now.
[00:25:13.327 --> 00:25:15.088]  How many days did you spend in Nigeria?
[00:25:15.088 --> 00:25:15.309]  31 days.
[00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:16.529]  Okay, 31 days.
[00:25:16.529 --> 00:25:19.231]  Then you come back to the U.S.
[00:25:19.231 --> 00:25:19.932]  through Germany.
[00:25:19.932 --> 00:25:21.273]  Which city in Germany?
[00:25:21.273 --> 00:25:21.813]  Frankfurt.
[00:25:21.813 --> 00:25:22.253]  Frankfurt.
[00:25:22.253 --> 00:25:23.874]  You go Frankfurt, Miami.
[00:25:23.874 --> 00:25:24.895]  Non-stop.
[00:25:24.895 --> 00:25:25.415]  Yes.
[00:25:25.415 --> 00:25:28.838]  And then you land in Miami, Miami's international airport, and then what happens?
[00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:43.335]  I get to the kiosk because I'm a global entry person and, you know, enter the information, put my fingerprints and mark the fact that I've been in Nigeria and nobody cares.
[00:25:43.335 --> 00:25:44.795]  Nobody's stopping you?
[00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:45.916]  Not a single test?
[00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:46.196]  Nothing.
[00:25:47.717 --> 00:25:50.198]  And you're thinking one.
[00:25:50.198 --> 00:26:15.549]  And I'm thinking that I've just spent the bulk of my time worrying about entrance and exits because my key role was to help develop the exit strategy and the entrance strategy so no more cases of Ebola could be imported into Nigeria and no case of Ebola could be exported from Nigeria.
[00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:19.055]  No, they were doing it in Nigeria, but no one was doing it here in the United States.
[00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:19.977]  Nor in Germany.
[00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:25.467]  Alright, so were you surprised then when you heard about the first case of Ebola here in the United States?
[00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:25.547]  No.
[00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.191]  It was about to happen.
[00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:51.626]  Yeah, because of what we've already spoken about, that the incubation period is 2 to 21 days, and the best we could do, and we did the best that any country is doing in Nigeria, but the best we can do is look for symptoms, test for symptoms in symptomatic patients, and ask epidemiologic questions.
[00:26:52.206 --> 00:27:00.390]  But if somebody either doesn't know they were exposed or lies on these questionnaires... Like the first case who came from West Africa, right?
[00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.931]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:02.812]  Oh, he lied a lot.
[00:27:02.812 --> 00:27:07.394]  Okay, that's Dr. Eileen Marty who returned from Nigeria.
[00:27:07.774 --> 00:27:17.445]  After spending a month in the country, of course another Ebola-hit country, she returned back through Miami International Airport, received no checks whatsoever.
[00:27:17.445 --> 00:27:19.987]  The CDC is supposed to have these checks in place.
[00:27:19.987 --> 00:27:25.553]  We had the story around a week ago where a CNN reporting team had gone to Liberia.
[00:27:26.654 --> 00:27:30.497]  had contact, at a distance at least, with Ebola victims.
[00:27:30.497 --> 00:27:31.838]  They came back.
[00:27:31.838 --> 00:27:34.519]  Again, no questions asked whatsoever.
[00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:45.346]  In fact, they approached the customs people, the officials at the airport, told them directly they had come back from Liberia after doing a story on Ebola.
[00:27:45.346 --> 00:27:47.388]  And again, nothing, absolutely nothing.
[00:27:47.388 --> 00:27:54.853]  You know, the TSA, they're really on top of things when it comes to snow globes or emptying out your ancestors' ashes.
[00:27:55.413 --> 00:28:07.790]  But when it comes to Ebola, when it comes to a real threat, the officials at the airports there across the country are basically asleep at the wheel, even after these CDC measures were supposedly put in place.
[00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.514]  There you see the article CNN reported returning from Liberia.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.842]  Horrified by lack of airport Ebola screening.
[00:28:14.842 --> 00:28:16.943]  That was around a week ago.
[00:28:16.943 --> 00:28:18.283]  This is still going on.
[00:28:18.283 --> 00:28:22.585]  This doctor returned and received no screening whatsoever.
[00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:25.567]  Then we have articles like this.
[00:28:25.567 --> 00:28:32.110]  They're trying to pin concerns about Ebola onto idiotic rap stars like Chris Brown.
[00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.791]  Chris Brown tweets, Ebola is population control.
[00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.654]  The singer tweeted on Monday, he thinks Ebola is a form of population control.
[00:28:41.604 --> 00:28:45.306]  I don't know, but I think Ebola epidemic is a form of population control.
[00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:47.287]  It's getting crazy, brah.
[00:28:47.287 --> 00:29:08.937]  So Chris Brown is now the face of skepticism about the government's handling of the Ebola crisis, and almost instantly the mainstream media hijacked this tweet and basically turned it into a massive story, because the genuine concerns, particularly about the virus having potentially mutated and gone airborne to a limited extent,
[00:29:09.637 --> 00:29:11.338]  are being shuffled to one side.
[00:29:11.338 --> 00:29:13.799]  They're not being addressed by the CDC.
[00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:19.862]  There we have the article, Ebola expert virus may soon go airborne.
[00:29:19.862 --> 00:29:25.844]  We had a New York Times op-ed recently, where another expert was saying the same thing.
[00:29:25.844 --> 00:29:33.668]  We had the University of Illinois study, and of course we had the 2012 Canadian study, all saying the same thing.
[00:29:33.668 --> 00:29:36.289]  So a lot of concerns about whether Ebola is going airborne
[00:29:36.949 --> 00:29:46.017]  But the media is more concerned about Chris Brown's tweets, and he's now the authority on scepticism about the government's handling of Ebola.
[00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:48.699]  We'll be back with David Knight with more news after the break.
[00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:49.901]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:50.301]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:50.301 --> 00:29:51.662]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.662 --> 00:29:53.284]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.284 --> 00:29:56.867]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:11.695]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:30:11.695 --> 00:30:18.160]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.501]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:23.604]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[00:30:23.604 --> 00:30:30.469]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:30:30.609 --> 00:30:35.251]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:40.032]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:30:40.032 --> 00:30:41.333]  Talk about the effects.
[00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:42.833]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:44.774]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:30:44.774 --> 00:30:45.895]  I feel like I look better.
[00:30:45.895 --> 00:30:46.595]  I feel better.
[00:30:46.595 --> 00:30:47.675]  I feel sexier.
[00:30:47.675 --> 00:30:48.636]  I love it.
[00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:51.617]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:30:51.617 --> 00:30:54.558]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:30:54.558 --> 00:30:55.618]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:30:55.618 --> 00:30:56.819]  Consult your physician.
[00:30:56.819 --> 00:30:59.180]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.120]  This is life changing.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:09.385]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:31:09.385 --> 00:31:15.588]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:21.554]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:21.554 --> 00:31:34.407]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:31:34.407 --> 00:31:36.049]  The result is a unique nascent
[00:31:36.089 --> 00:31:36.529]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:06.842]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:32:06.842 --> 00:32:10.122]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:32:10.122 --> 00:32:11.863]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:18.264]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:18.264 --> 00:32:24.146]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:28.287]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:32:28.287 --> 00:32:31.348]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:32:31.348 --> 00:32:39.631]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:32:39.631 --> 00:32:41.732]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:32:41.732 --> 00:32:42.752]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:32:43.132 --> 00:32:52.075]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:54.736]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:32:54.736 --> 00:32:59.037]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:33:06.328 --> 00:33:12.357]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:14.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:33.868 --> 00:33:43.261]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, and in the Info War, as Hillary Clinton called it, the mainstream media, again, is taking a huge hit.
[00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:44.983]  We have a New York Times story.
[00:33:44.983 --> 00:33:48.588]  Leaning forward, MSNBC loses ground to rival CNN.
[00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:58.353]  Yet another record drop in MSNBC's viewing figures, and that applies also to CNN, Fox News, across the board.
[00:33:58.353 --> 00:34:06.336]  Rachel Maddow, the biggest star on the MSNBC cable network, just posted her lowest quarterly ratings results ever.
[00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:16.260]  Morning Joe, MSNBC's signature morning program, scored its second lowest quarterly ratings, reaching an average of just 87,000 viewers in the key news demographic group.
[00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:26.323]  Now David Knight, I made a video on Friday, a three minute video, about the Simpsons supposedly predicting the Ebola outbreak back in 1997.
[00:34:26.323 --> 00:34:29.404]  Of course, you know, I debunked it, it was complete nonsense.
[00:34:29.404 --> 00:34:38.788]  But that one video got more views than MSNBC's signature morning program in their key demographic does each day.
[00:34:38.788 --> 00:34:41.829]  What does that tell you about the decline of the mainstream media?
[00:34:42.793 --> 00:34:44.574]  Yeah, kind of beating them at their own game, I guess.
[00:34:44.574 --> 00:34:47.996]  You know, we have a lot of news that goes up.
[00:34:47.996 --> 00:34:51.859]  And just look at the talk radio audience.
[00:34:51.859 --> 00:34:58.343]  For us, for other talk radio hosts, it dwarfs, in any given moment, their highest ratings.
[00:34:58.343 --> 00:35:00.644]  So yeah, people are not looking for that.
[00:35:00.644 --> 00:35:03.666]  It's kind of like what you see with the currency going on in Venezuela.
[00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:08.669]  You've now got a Bitcoin interest in Venezuela because they've had currency controls on it.
[00:35:08.669 --> 00:35:10.030]  We've had information control.
[00:35:10.937 --> 00:35:14.959]  And people are hungry for authentic information.
[00:35:14.959 --> 00:35:21.302]  They want to hear real stories that aren't filtered, that aren't spun, and they're not going to hear it on MSNBC.
[00:35:21.302 --> 00:35:23.383]  They know that.
[00:35:23.383 --> 00:35:26.225]  So, now we see Venezuela's turn to Bitcoin.
[00:35:26.225 --> 00:35:31.547]  Tell us, I mean, we've heard stories about rationing of toilet paper in Venezuela.
[00:35:31.547 --> 00:35:36.289]  How are they using the cryptocurrency to get around those government control measures?
[00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:39.111]  Well, yeah, you know, earlier this year Bloomberg did a
[00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:45.295]  They were talking to bond investors and they said Venezuela is a great place to invest.
[00:35:45.295 --> 00:35:49.799]  We've made nearly 700% return on investment under Hugo Chavez.
[00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:53.181]  We don't expect it to change under his successor.
[00:35:53.181 --> 00:36:02.188]  That the people, the leadership in Venezuela understands that their first responsibility is to pay off their debtors, their sovereign debt.
[00:36:02.848 --> 00:36:09.731]  At the meantime, in that article, they're pointing out how the Venezuelans are having to go to neighboring countries to get water, to get medicine, to get food.
[00:36:09.731 --> 00:36:11.332]  They didn't have basic necessities.
[00:36:11.332 --> 00:36:13.313]  I mean, it was beyond even toilet paper.
[00:36:13.313 --> 00:36:15.534]  So they've also had currency controls.
[00:36:15.534 --> 00:36:23.838]  And in this article from Reuters, it says two New York-based Venezuelan brothers are hoping this week to start trading on the first Bitcoin exchange in Venezuela.
[00:36:24.338 --> 00:36:27.800]  They said they've already got several hundred Bitcoin enthusiasts there.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:37.366]  So, you know, it's kind of one way, one of the advantages, of course, of Bitcoin is to be able to transfer your money from one jurisdiction to another.
[00:36:37.366 --> 00:36:47.491]  That's getting increasingly difficult even in Western countries with currency controls to get your money out of a given country because they just don't allow you to transfer it in the conventional banking system.
[00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:49.713]  Of course, you can't carry it with you.
[00:36:49.713 --> 00:36:51.054]  You'll get it stolen by the
[00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:59.859]  Law enforcement at the airport, if nowhere else, you know, because they have the asset forfeiture laws, which are not really laws.
[00:36:59.859 --> 00:37:01.019]  They're not legitimate laws.
[00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:13.206]  Basically, if they merely assert that they think that that currency that you have with you is illegitimate, they are entitled, according to their policies, to keep that money and to keep the proceeds of that money.
[00:37:13.206 --> 00:37:18.929]  And, of course, that's a major part of what's driving the war on drugs, as well as the militarization of the police.
[00:37:18.929 --> 00:37:19.810]  They're using that to buy
[00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:25.305]  Some of the things that really, in my opinion, the police have no business owning.
[00:37:26.334 --> 00:37:28.254]  We're going to go to your calls shortly as well, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:28.254 --> 00:37:40.797]  But David Knight, you had another story about apparently the Ivory Coast has better security measures in terms of fighting Ebola than the United States, it seems.
[00:37:40.797 --> 00:37:55.301]  Yeah, it turns out that we're coming up to the chocolate harvesting season in the Ivory Coast and there's a lot of stories coming out now to expect a price increase on chocolate because the Ivory Coast has decided that they're going to close their borders.
[00:37:56.081 --> 00:37:57.962]  Because they're concerned about Ebola.
[00:37:57.962 --> 00:38:05.365]  And they're heavily dependent on migrant workers to come in from the countries that are currently being affected by the Ebola pandemic.
[00:38:05.365 --> 00:38:08.267]  They are dependent on those migrant workers to come in and do the harvest.
[00:38:08.267 --> 00:38:13.029]  But you have a third world country like the Ivory Coast that has the will
[00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:16.953]  As well as the ability to close their borders.
[00:38:16.953 --> 00:38:21.037]  If they didn't have the ability to do it, people wouldn't be concerned about the price going up.
[00:38:21.037 --> 00:38:22.538]  But we don't have the will to do that.
[00:38:22.538 --> 00:38:24.540]  We certainly have the ability to do that.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.685]  We certainly have the ability to contain those countries.
[00:38:28.685 --> 00:38:33.150]  And the measures that we see with the thermometers and that sort of thing, that's just nonsense.
[00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.050]  And everybody knows that.
[00:38:34.691 --> 00:38:48.634]  That's one of the reasons why people are not paying any attention to the mainstream media because mainstream media is just parroting back what the CDC and government officials are telling people and quite frankly their first priority is not to protect the public but to keep the borders open.
[00:38:49.505 --> 00:38:51.585]  It seems they're trying to save face.
[00:38:51.585 --> 00:38:59.447]  I mean, it seems it's too late now to block the flights because if they did so, they would have to acknowledge that it was a mistake not to do so in the first place.
[00:38:59.447 --> 00:39:10.389]  And now we have, as we saw before the break, Dr. Eileen Marty saying that she came back from Nigeria having been potentially exposed to Ebola and received no checks whatsoever.
[00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:13.850]  Maybe we could forgive the CNN reporters a week or two ago
[00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.711]  Because those measures weren't in place.
[00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:17.152]  But now they are in place.
[00:39:17.152 --> 00:39:22.555]  People are still returning from Ebola-hit countries and not receiving any checks.
[00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:26.358]  Not that those checks, David Knight, would really have an impact in the first place.
[00:39:26.358 --> 00:39:28.339]  Isn't it the only solution to block the flights?
[00:39:28.339 --> 00:39:29.940]  I don't think they are in place, Paul.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.263]  I mean, we keep hearing from Obama and from officials that they put these in place.
[00:39:35.083 --> 00:39:38.865]  But everybody that's coming through is outraged that absolutely nothing is being done.
[00:39:38.865 --> 00:39:45.930]  I mean, they're still asking people if you're bringing in tobacco or alcohol so they can tax it, but they're not interested if you're bringing in Ebola.
[00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.971]  They could care less.
[00:39:47.971 --> 00:39:48.891]  They are not doing it.
[00:39:48.891 --> 00:39:50.432]  They're simply lying to the people.
[00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:52.374]  We're seeing this at every level.
[00:39:52.374 --> 00:39:59.318]  We've seen at the presidential level, at the state level here in Texas, and at the local level with Judge Jenkins.
[00:39:59.858 --> 00:40:02.140]  All of them are saying there's absolutely no risk.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:10.807]  It's not coming to America, it's not going to get out of this one patient who has come down with it, and now we've seen it spread to a second patient.
[00:40:10.807 --> 00:40:16.472]  They continue to tell people things that aren't true, that I believe that they know are not true.
[00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:20.010]  And here's an interesting story out of Breitbart.
[00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:24.174]  Texas governor's office takes over Dallas Ebola apartment cleanup.
[00:40:24.174 --> 00:40:26.757]  Now we know that this was basically botched in the first place.
[00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:37.527]  We had the image of the guys with no protective gear whatsoever pressure washing the Ebola vomit off the sidewalk where patient zero went to the hospital.
[00:40:37.527 --> 00:40:40.911]  Reports, eyewitness reports said that he vomited all over the sidewalk
[00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:45.395]  They were there pressure washing it with a hose, no protection whatsoever.
[00:40:45.395 --> 00:40:49.619]  Then of course you had the sheriff's deputies who were forced into the apartment.
[00:40:49.619 --> 00:40:50.800]  One of them got ill.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.863]  Thankfully it turned out that he didn't have the Ebola virus.
[00:40:53.863 --> 00:40:58.327]  But now the Texas governor's office has taken over the cleanup of that apartment.
[00:40:58.327 --> 00:41:06.935]  David Knight, we were told days ago that this cleanup with the hazmat crews, as you see there, had already taken place and yet apparently now it's being handed off to somebody else.
[00:41:07.742 --> 00:41:22.210]  They're waiting days to do this, and as a matter of fact, the company that cleaned up Mr. Duncan's apartment, or the apartment he was staying in, they took their precautions to a level above what the CDC was telling people, so clearly they did not believe that.
[00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.331]  They didn't want to take the chance, and that's what we should be doing.
[00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:27.112]  We should be demanding that our officials do that.
[00:41:27.112 --> 00:41:35.836]  They go an extra level with this, an extra set of precaution because clearly they don't understand how easily this is being transmitted.
[00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:39.158]  We've had now two nurses in Western countries that have come down with it.
[00:41:39.158 --> 00:41:40.659]  That's what we said from the very beginning.
[00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:42.940]  It was Alex Jones and InfoWars saying this is
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.160]  I don't
[00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:07.216]  One of those cases that has transferred to a medical professional.
[00:42:07.216 --> 00:42:13.740]  We've seen hundreds of medical professionals in Liberia and Sierra Leone die from this.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:19.923]  So clearly there's something about the protocols, as careful as they are, that are not 100% certain.
[00:42:19.923 --> 00:42:22.945]  And maybe it's modes of transmission that they don't fully understand.
[00:42:23.365 --> 00:42:30.350]  When I was on the radio yesterday, I talked about Nancy Wrightball, who was one of the first two people that was brought back to Emory University along with Kent Brantley.
[00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.012]  She said she had no idea how she had contacted it.
[00:42:33.012 --> 00:42:34.894]  She said she was not even in the hot zone.
[00:42:34.894 --> 00:42:40.958]  She was helping to decontaminate the people who, the doctors who were in the hot zone, and she was very careful.
[00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:45.142]  She knew she did not touch a fellow co-worker who had Ebola.
[00:42:45.142 --> 00:42:47.864]  She said, perhaps I touched something that he had touched.
[00:42:48.524 --> 00:43:03.031]  But see we're getting exactly the opposite message from Judge Jenkins when he makes a point of saying that he proudly went into the apartment and hung out with these people and then drove them 45 minutes to a new home.
[00:43:03.031 --> 00:43:08.534]  Now I think what he knew or was told is that after several days the chances of
[00:43:09.654 --> 00:43:15.216]  A virus not being transmittable, still being alive, goes down to nearly zero.
[00:43:15.216 --> 00:43:18.917]  But it is, you can never say with something like this that there is zero risk.
[00:43:18.917 --> 00:43:20.738]  And that's what they've been telling everybody.
[00:43:20.738 --> 00:43:25.780]  It is not a 100% chance that you're going to get it or a 0% chance you're going to get it.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.180]  It's somewhere in there.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.482]  And why would you roll the dice with yourself, with your family, with the community?
[00:43:31.482 --> 00:43:37.004]  And why would you send the message that don't worry about touching stuff that other people have touched if they've got Ebola?
[00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:40.985]  He didn't tell people, I think it's safe because so many days have passed.
[00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:45.406]  Because then that would highlight the tardiness of their response.
[00:43:45.406 --> 00:43:47.206]  Yeah, I mean, it was a PR stunt.
[00:43:47.206 --> 00:43:47.426]  Yeah.
[00:43:47.426 --> 00:43:52.727]  But again, in the case of this second nurse who was infected, she took full precaution.
[00:43:52.727 --> 00:43:55.388]  She was wearing the full suit and yet she got infected anyway.
[00:43:55.388 --> 00:43:58.709]  So again, we ask the question, has it mutated?
[00:43:58.709 --> 00:44:01.169]  Has it gone airborne at least to a limited extent?
[00:44:01.169 --> 00:44:04.110]  But then there's the flip side of the equation in all this, which is,
[00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.511]  The hysteria.
[00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:08.214]  Here we have an article out of CBS News.
[00:44:08.214 --> 00:44:14.281]  Officials, air sick passenger on flight from JFK prompts Ebola scare at LAX.
[00:44:14.281 --> 00:44:20.288]  A flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport was the center of an investigation in Los Angeles because of a sick passenger.
[00:44:21.129 --> 00:44:27.835]  Police at Los Angeles International Airport said a passenger who was showing symptoms of the Ebola virus was being evaluated.
[00:44:27.835 --> 00:44:32.399]  Later, they said the passenger was suffering from air sickness.
[00:44:32.399 --> 00:44:41.747]  Now, we saw the video earlier out of RT with the Czech passenger being wheeled through the train station covered in a black plastic bag.
[00:44:41.747 --> 00:44:43.749]  Turned out that he had a cold.
[00:44:44.429 --> 00:44:55.996]  So David, I mean, we've got people with air sickness and colds that are being treated as potential Ebola patients, and yet on the flip side we have the complete lack of precaution with the cleaning of the apartment.
[00:44:55.996 --> 00:45:09.385]  So, I mean, this could escalate to a point where anybody who shows any signs of any illness, and remember the CDC has imposed those quarantine measures where they can say any sign of respiratory illness, or indeed
[00:45:10.325 --> 00:45:15.669]  No sign whatsoever that that was in Obama's executive order could be detained.
[00:45:15.669 --> 00:45:24.696]  So, I mean, David, this could get ridiculous where anybody who has a cold who is travelling through an airport gets snatched up, gets quarantined.
[00:45:25.566 --> 00:45:27.447]  It's going to vary from location to location.
[00:45:27.447 --> 00:45:30.267]  Here in the United States, the CDC can make recommendations.
[00:45:30.267 --> 00:45:33.448]  They can tell people what they think should happen.
[00:45:33.448 --> 00:45:38.049]  But it's ultimately going to be the local authorities who actually take action.
[00:45:38.049 --> 00:45:40.730]  So they can overreact or they can underreact.
[00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:44.251]  They can take the CDC at its word or they can take it to another step.
[00:45:45.111 --> 00:45:47.172]  Uh, or they can panic about it.
[00:45:47.172 --> 00:45:52.475]  And you know, quite frankly, if you lie to people, you're not doing anything to stop the panic.
[00:45:52.475 --> 00:45:58.819]  Because sooner or later, and it will be sooner, your lie is going to be found out, and you're going to lose people's trust.
[00:45:58.819 --> 00:46:00.320]  You won't be able to control them.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.502]  And that's the real danger.
[00:46:02.502 --> 00:46:12.590]  To me, when Judge Jenkins brags about the fact that he hung out with them and then goes to a press conference and says, I'm still wearing the same shirt that I was with them for over an hour with.
[00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.632]  I mean, to me, that is reckless behavior.
[00:46:15.632 --> 00:46:24.740]  And when you do that, and then you subsequently have a nurse who is wearing full protective clothing that comes down with it, people in Dallas must be very concerned.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.401]  And evidently,
[00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:28.705]  Judge Jenkins has not put himself into quarantine.
[00:46:28.705 --> 00:46:29.486]  That's the amazing thing.
[00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:33.472]  He would sign the quarantine order for these people and then he would go hang out with them.
[00:46:34.127 --> 00:46:35.627]  I mean, do you see the contradiction there?
[00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:43.609]  I mean, none of this makes any sense unless you go back and you look at the context that this guy has been all about open borders.
[00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:49.071]  And back in July, he was given a place right across the table from Obama when Obama came to Dallas.
[00:46:49.071 --> 00:46:57.833]  He was pushing, bringing immigrant children into a neighborhood, going door to door, intimidating people about protesting if that were to happen.
[00:46:57.833 --> 00:47:01.594]  So I think it's purely political, but it is reckless behavior.
[00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:12.236]  And speaking of open borders, we've got a story out here, CNS News reporting, Southcom commander warns of potential Ebola-driven mass migration from south of border.
[00:47:12.236 --> 00:47:20.721]  Of course, we've talked about the potential for Ebola tourism, people from West Africa seeking to enter the United States for treatment.
[00:47:20.721 --> 00:47:23.563]  Now, Marine Corps General John Kelly, commander of the U.S.
[00:47:23.563 --> 00:47:25.364]  Southern Command, predicted last week
[00:47:26.118 --> 00:47:40.002]  That the Ebola virus will not be contained in West Africa, and if it infected people, the people who flee those countries and spread the disease to Central and South America, it could cause, quote, mass migration into the United States of those seeking treatment.
[00:47:40.002 --> 00:47:44.383]  If it breaks out, it's literally, Katie, bar the door, he said.
[00:47:44.383 --> 00:47:52.706]  So, David, I mean, is that a real threat of people gathering at the border, trying to become Ebola tourists to get treatment in the United States?
[00:47:53.126 --> 00:47:53.826]  Well, absolutely.
[00:47:53.826 --> 00:47:57.328]  I mean, whether they want to be Ebola tourists or they want to be Ebola terrorists.
[00:47:57.328 --> 00:48:01.130]  I mean, that is, either one of those things are a real problem.
[00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:07.913]  And I'm also concerned, Paul, about mandatory vaccines, some kind of mandatory treatment.
[00:48:07.913 --> 00:48:15.096]  We see another article today from Russia Today saying that they've got a vaccine that they're working on with 70 to 90 percent efficacy that they would
[00:48:15.636 --> 00:48:19.880]  Send to victims in West Africa in two months.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:28.048]  Well, in two months, if things don't change, you're going to have anywhere from 5 to 15 percent of the population, according to the CDC's projections, infected.
[00:48:28.048 --> 00:48:31.252]  It's doubling every couple of weeks there.
[00:48:31.252 --> 00:48:33.454]  You're looking at millions of people.
[00:48:33.454 --> 00:48:37.177]  Well, you're looking at anywhere from a half a million to one and a half million people, is what their projections say.
[00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:47.812]  I'm seeing the same thing from the ZMapp virus that the Gates Foundation is getting on board with that saying we're going to ramp up production but it's going to be a few months before we can get there.
[00:48:47.812 --> 00:48:50.616]  They want this thing to, in my opinion, build.
[00:48:52.017 --> 00:49:01.345]  Interesting to me the timing that we've got all of these solutions essentially nearly ready for the marketplace as this thing breaks out.
[00:49:01.345 --> 00:49:13.296]  That in of itself is suspicious, but I think one of the most suspicious things is that we see the people who are developing ZMapp virus, it's not even a vaccine, it's a drug of antibodies.
[00:49:13.296 --> 00:49:18.721]  Basically what they're doing is mimicking in an artificial genetically modified way, they're mimicking
[00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:22.404]  Blood transfusions where people get antibodies from survivors.
[00:49:22.404 --> 00:49:24.365]  That's called convalescent serum.
[00:49:24.365 --> 00:49:27.148]  There's been experiments that show that that's effective.
[00:49:27.148 --> 00:49:29.850]  Everybody that has survived with the ZMapp...
[00:49:30.632 --> 00:49:30.852]  I don't
[00:49:52.588 --> 00:50:04.637]  Whether or not it works and whether or not blood transfusions work are beside the point because what they're doing is mimicking this natural, inexpensive technique which is available today.
[00:50:04.637 --> 00:50:07.640]  There are thousands of people who have survived the Ebola pandemic.
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:08.700]  I don't know.
[00:50:27.887 --> 00:50:30.528]  I mean, it's really crazy here in the United States.
[00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:36.651]  Everywhere I go, like every grocery store, Western Union, everywhere, get your vaccine, get your vaccine.
[00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:38.793]  They could easily tie that into Ebola.
[00:50:38.793 --> 00:50:39.253]  Oh yeah.
[00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:43.835]  If this spreads, and you know, that's definitely a possibility going forward.
[00:50:43.835 --> 00:50:46.536]  We're going to be back on the Alex Jones Show after the break.
[00:50:46.536 --> 00:50:53.320]  We're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen in the next hour about ISIS, the Ukraine, and many more issues.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.640]  Of course, NSA surveillance.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.842]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:50:56.842 --> 00:50:57.422]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:03.993]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:51:03.993 --> 00:51:08.315]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[00:54:13.073 --> 00:54:16.095]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex today.
[00:54:16.095 --> 00:54:17.176]  And we're talking Ebola.
[00:54:30.427 --> 00:54:34.330]  Liberals last week said it was racist to use the term Ebola.
[00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:37.432]  Of course that became a big meme, a hashtag on Twitter.
[00:54:37.432 --> 00:54:41.635]  So now InfoWars.com is running the Ebola contest.
[00:54:41.635 --> 00:54:51.501]  Tyranny is the disease and basically we're inviting people to shoot video of themselves posting the Ebola posters in legal and lawful areas.
[00:54:51.501 --> 00:54:54.984]  We have our own Ebola poster on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:55.524 --> 00:54:59.710]  All you can make your own, there you see Ebola contest tyranny, is the disease.
[00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.755]  So we got first place prize of $5,000, second place $2,000, third place $500.
[00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:16.473]  October 24th is the deadline to submit your entry and Alex will announce the winners on the Alex Jones Show on Halloween, October 31st.
[00:55:16.473 --> 00:55:25.576]  So basically, this is a campaign to stress to the federal government, close the open borders, halt the flights from the Ebola-hit countries.
[00:55:25.576 --> 00:55:31.537]  It's the Ebola contest, the racist Ebola contest, according to some on the left.
[00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:33.598]  Merely using that term is racist.
[00:55:33.598 --> 00:55:36.999]  Of course, that's merely trying to impose their thought crime again.
[00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:42.921]  Secure the border, join the Ebola contest, and again, shoot video of yourself.
[00:55:42.921 --> 00:55:48.783]  It's important not to just post pictures of yourself placing these flyers in public areas.
[00:55:48.783 --> 00:55:55.005]  It has to be video, so be sure to get on board with the Infowars.com Ebola contest.
[00:55:55.005 --> 00:56:00.227]  David Knight, last few minutes here, you had a couple of stories about medical marijuana.
[00:56:00.227 --> 00:56:03.408]  Yeah, there's an interesting story out of Italy that they made
[00:56:04.328 --> 00:56:07.769]  Medical marijuana legal in Italy and then they noticed that it was very expensive.
[00:56:07.769 --> 00:56:09.449]  It was 10 times the street price.
[00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:12.710]  So what they've done there is to call in the army.
[00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.171]  So they're using the army to grow medical marijuana.
[00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:21.252]  I think that's interesting contrast the way we use our military in Afghanistan to create a heroin epidemic in the United States and elsewhere.
[00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:30.495]  We've seen the supply of opium go from about 10% under the Taliban to 90% of the world supply under the US Army and we've seen
[00:56:31.495 --> 00:56:38.577]  Geraldo Rivera and others point out that they have the US military assisting the growing of opium.
[00:56:38.577 --> 00:56:40.117]  So it's interesting to see that.
[00:56:40.117 --> 00:56:51.599]  But again, what we were talking about before, how they would take a natural treatment and they would withhold that or say that there's really, it's not clear that there's really any efficacy of that.
[00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:59.141]  The World Health Organization has looked at convalescent serum, has looked at blood transfusion from people who survived
[00:56:59.861 --> 00:57:14.531]  Ebola transferring their antibodies and said well, you know, that's something we need to look at it has a long history matter of fact back in the 19th century you had someone when a Nobel Prize in science for using that to help with diphtheria.
[00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:23.857]  This is something they know works It's basically the fundamental principle of vaccines except that this doesn't have the additives This is just the antibodies themselves.
[00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:29.441]  This isn't injecting somebody with a disease live or dead It's simply transferring the antibodies and the people who have been there
[00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:31.282]  Are very keen to get it.
[00:57:31.282 --> 00:57:36.627]  You see Kent Brantley gave, he got a blood transfusion and survived.
[00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:38.709]  He gave a blood transfusion now to two people.
[00:57:38.709 --> 00:57:44.694]  The NBC cameraman who came back has received one from him as well as another doctor in Nebraska.
[00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:54.182]  And so they put a lot of store in this and all we see is that the World Health Organization will say well it's something we should take a look at but we really haven't done any studies.
[00:57:54.182 --> 00:57:55.243]  Well don't hold your breath.
[00:57:55.891 --> 00:58:01.235]  They said that a couple of months ago, and then they complained about how there's a black market, you might get blood-borne diseases.
[00:58:01.235 --> 00:58:04.337]  You can screen for those diseases very easily.
[00:58:04.337 --> 00:58:05.998]  You can set up a registry.
[00:58:05.998 --> 00:58:07.719]  That would be something that they could do very cheaply.
[00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:14.444]  But just like the case of medical marijuana, where they would prohibit it for people and say, you can take a Marinol pill, which is a part of that.
[00:58:14.444 --> 00:58:16.125]  A lot of people say it's not very effective.
[00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:17.786]  A lot of people say that it's not safe.
[00:58:17.786 --> 00:58:22.650]  You can have that, but you can't have the natural stuff that pharmaceutical companies don't control.
[00:58:23.726 --> 00:58:30.692]  Of course, in places like California, you've got private mercenaries destroying pot plants, even though they're completely legal.
[00:58:30.692 --> 00:58:34.996]  So it's just amazing how the oppression is coming down on this medical marijuana.
[00:58:34.996 --> 00:58:38.520]  NSA whistleblower Wayne Madsen coming up after the break.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.663]  Stay tuned in 4Wars.com.
[00:58:41.663 --> 00:58:45.086]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.086 --> 00:58:47.087]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.993 --> 00:58:58.141]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:58:58.141 --> 00:59:00.503]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:05.789]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:10.734]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:10.934 --> 00:59:14.275]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:14.275 --> 00:59:18.336]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:18.336 --> 00:59:22.657]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:22.657 --> 00:59:32.879]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:32.879 --> 00:59:35.400]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.461]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:36.461 --> 00:59:38.121]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:11.954]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.954 --> 01:00:13.534]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.534 --> 01:00:15.075]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.075 --> 01:00:19.276]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.276 --> 01:00:23.357]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:39.646]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show live, final segment here with David Night.
[01:00:39.646 --> 01:00:42.469]  There was a story which went up a couple of days ago.
[01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:46.913]  FBI Chief Citizens should be deeply skeptical of government.
[01:00:46.913 --> 01:00:56.863]  Americans should be deeply skeptical of government power, says FBI Director James Comey, adding that law enforcement should be able to access someone's telephone only with a court order.
[01:00:57.503 --> 01:01:10.472]  Now this is a guy who back during the initial NSA surveillance scandal back in January 2006 when of course it came out in the New York Times that the Bush administration was overseeing a lot of these programs.
[01:01:10.472 --> 01:01:19.138]  He put a block in place which prevented the NSA from really hammering down on the full complete panopticon surveillance of the American people.
[01:01:19.138 --> 01:01:24.862]  So he's been an individual who has set himself against surveillance since as far back as 2006 and now he's saying that
[01:01:26.943 --> 01:01:29.485]  Americans should be deeply skeptical of government.
[01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:34.509]  Of course, under the DHS's definitions, that probably makes him a terrorist.
[01:01:34.509 --> 01:01:43.996]  Remember the 2011 study, a university study funded by the DHS, which said, quote, liberty lovers were in league with terrorists.
[01:01:43.996 --> 01:01:48.379]  Well, now the FBI director is voicing similar rhetoric.
[01:01:48.379 --> 01:01:55.645]  But David Knight, his point about surveillance, as it relates to the iPhone, to cell phones in general, you say that he's contradicting himself.
[01:01:55.765 --> 01:02:00.531]  Yeah, I think people should be deeply skeptical of his statements linking himself with the founders.
[01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:01.772]  I hope he's sincere about that.
[01:02:01.772 --> 01:02:06.899]  But then he goes on to say that he has a real problem with what Apple and Google are doing.
[01:02:06.899 --> 01:02:10.904]  He says, if you're going to block that, that's like creating a car with a trunk that I can never open.
[01:02:11.849 --> 01:02:13.249]  Even if I get a court order.
[01:02:13.249 --> 01:02:20.672]  Now he's saying that for this to be done legally, people need to go to a judge and get a court order to show what they want to search for.
[01:02:20.672 --> 01:02:22.472]  And of course we all know that.
[01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:27.254]  We also all know that the government hasn't done that for a very long time.
[01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:32.201]  And nothing has been done to the people who have violated that law.
[01:02:32.201 --> 01:02:43.116]  So as FBI director, I would ask him, if you're going to tell us that we have a constitution in place that is checks and balances that prohibits this, then where are you?
[01:02:43.857 --> 01:02:49.700]  When we have government officials violating their oath to the Constitution and searching without warrants.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.142]  If he wants to start enforcing that, then we can talk about the rest of this stuff.
[01:02:53.142 --> 01:03:02.787]  But quite frankly, when the government disobeys the law, I think we should be deeply skeptical of somebody who starts quoting the Founding Fathers and doesn't do anything to enforce the Constitution.
[01:03:03.507 --> 01:03:08.109]  The way this is going to go, Paul, is that what we're seeing, if it even works, I'm not sure at this point.
[01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:10.630]  I'm deeply distrustful of the technology companies as well.
[01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:20.275]  But if Apple and Google's strategy really is secure, they're doing that as a PR stunt because they have to sell their products internationally.
[01:03:20.275 --> 01:03:24.097]  And internationally, people don't want the United States government looking at them either.
[01:03:24.657 --> 01:03:30.761]  However, the internet service providers and the cell phone providers that are here in this country, they are captive to the government.
[01:03:30.761 --> 01:03:33.763]  They're dependent on the government for their entire business.
[01:03:33.763 --> 01:03:36.525]  They have to do everything the government tells them to do.
[01:03:36.525 --> 01:03:46.111]  Even if your phone is secure, the minute you're sending or receiving information to your internet service provider or your cell phone company, the government has a jack right there at that point.
[01:03:46.111 --> 01:03:48.672]  They're going to intercept it, they're going to store it at that point.
[01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:50.874]  So, a lot of this is a smoke screen.
[01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:54.177]  But if he wants to talk about courts, let's talk about the FISA court.
[01:03:54.177 --> 01:04:02.064]  The FISA court was set up to stop the NSA from spying on American citizens, and yet it's not a court by any means.
[01:04:02.064 --> 01:04:09.751]  This is nothing more than a star chamber proceedings where you have one judge and one person from the government telling the judge what they want.
[01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:10.632]  He rubber stamps it.
[01:04:10.632 --> 01:04:11.813]  There's no adversarial
[01:04:12.193 --> 01:04:12.774]  We're good to go.
[01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:42.329]  And again, it's, you know, whether people still care about surveillance, you know, if you've got nothing to hide, well, you know, give me your email password, give me the access to your bank account.
[01:04:42.329 --> 01:04:57.462]  They tend to get very reticent to hand over that information if you phrase it in that way, and yet they're quite happy to have the convenience of the iPhone and give away all their secrets to NSA surveillance, which is a subject we're going to cover with Wayne Madsen after the break.
[01:04:57.462 --> 01:04:58.904]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:01.044 --> 01:05:10.150]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:18.196]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:18.536 --> 01:05:23.420]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:30.206]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:30.206 --> 01:05:37.292]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:37.372 --> 01:05:44.395]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:44.395 --> 01:05:48.896]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:48.896 --> 01:05:58.580]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.261]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:04.623]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:04.623 --> 01:06:12.868]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:18.291]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:20.813]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:06:20.813 --> 01:06:22.914]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:34.850]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:39.133]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:39.133 --> 01:06:40.914]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:48.779]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:48.779 --> 01:06:49.900]  But for how long?
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.122]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:06:52.122 --> 01:06:56.545]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.426]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:06:58.426 --> 01:06:59.367]  Just won't quit.
[01:07:01.025 --> 01:07:10.680]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:16.549]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life,
[01:07:16.749 --> 01:07:20.613]  Was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:07:20.613 --> 01:07:26.780]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.984]  Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:07:30.984 --> 01:07:35.649]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:07:35.649 --> 01:07:37.892]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:07:38.072 --> 01:07:40.633]  And there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:07:40.633 --> 01:07:46.297]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:07:46.297 --> 01:07:51.640]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.123]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[01:07:57.123 --> 01:07:57.603]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:10.530]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.515]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:31.923 --> 01:08:34.704]  It's the Alex Jones Show, live with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:34.704 --> 01:08:41.586]  We're going to go to your calls for Wayne Madsen at the bottom of the hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:41.586 --> 01:08:50.489]  But we're joined by Wayne Madsen, of course, NSA whistleblower and investigative journalist to discuss ISIS and a whole host more.
[01:08:50.489 --> 01:08:51.969]  Wayne Madsen, welcome to the show.
[01:08:51.969 --> 01:08:53.610]  Hi, good to be with you, Paul.
[01:08:54.278 --> 01:08:55.399]  Thanks for being here.
[01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.780]  First off, I mean, we're going to get into ISIS soon.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:11.189]  I wanted to get your quick take, I don't know how closely you've been following it, on the Ebola outbreak, of course, because we've had this botched response from the CDC, it seems, the first two cases there in Dallas.
[01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:19.495]  Do you think that this is merely incompetence on behalf of the public health authorities, or are we seeing some kind of deliberate malfeasance?
[01:09:20.683 --> 01:09:44.670]  Well, you know, I just returned from a conference in Tehran last week, and of course Tehran, in my mind, was going to be a great place to find out all about ISIL or ISIS or whatever you want to call this group, but I actually discovered some things about Ebola while I was there, which I didn't think I would in that particular venue.
[01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.211]  First of all,
[01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:54.405]  One of my colleagues, Dr. Randy Short, produced a patent for the Ebola virus from the U.S.
[01:09:54.405 --> 01:09:56.466]  Patent and Trademark Office.
[01:09:56.466 --> 01:10:02.129]  It was patented a few years ago, has a barcode on it, it's a government document.
[01:10:02.129 --> 01:10:08.372]  That was a little bit surprising, but what was even more surprising is when I took a tour through the
[01:10:09.128 --> 01:10:09.489]  I think?
[01:10:25.411 --> 01:10:29.215]  in Orlando, operating a business out of a P.O.
[01:10:29.215 --> 01:10:31.998]  box and out of private residences.
[01:10:31.998 --> 01:10:47.675]  And his daughter, who serves on his board for one of these companies that doesn't have a real address, it turns out that she was responsible at Harvard, she's a Harvard biologist, for mapping the Ebola virus
[01:10:48.115 --> 01:10:51.537]  From an animal gene pool to the human gene pool.
[01:10:51.537 --> 01:10:55.839]  Now, you know, you put the patent together with that kind of information.
[01:10:55.839 --> 01:11:07.366]  You know, here's somebody whose father was a brutal torture, and you have to wonder what is behind this sudden outbreak of Ebola, which we had an outbreak in Zaire.
[01:11:07.366 --> 01:11:15.010]  It's actually called the Zaire Ebola virus some years ago, but it was eradicated in Zaire, now Congo, Democratic Republic, Congo.
[01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:30.025]  How come it all of a sudden appears in these three West African countries that have been rife with civil wars and coup d'etats brought about mostly by countries that are after their natural resources?
[01:11:30.025 --> 01:11:33.288]  Gold, diamonds, and iron.
[01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:34.970]  And of course,
[01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:38.451]  Israel figures very big in that operation.
[01:11:38.451 --> 01:11:49.474]  They've been responsible for an attempt to overthrow the government of Guinea and they were involved in supplying both sides in the very bloody civil wars in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.
[01:11:49.474 --> 01:11:58.637]  I'm very suspicious about Ebola and especially where we saw the outbreak in the hot zones right now in those three countries.
[01:11:59.571 --> 01:12:06.253]  Let's turn to ISIS then, because over the weekend we had ISIS almost taking the town of Kobani in Syria.
[01:12:06.253 --> 01:12:09.493]  They're making advances in western Baghdad.
[01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:14.894]  I mean, the US offensive against ISIS, the airstrikes, only seem to have bolstered ISIS.
[01:12:14.894 --> 01:12:17.875]  Now they're expanding their spread throughout the region.
[01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.015]  Isn't that the case?
[01:12:19.015 --> 01:12:21.776]  Yeah, and you know, who is this ISIS?
[01:12:21.776 --> 01:12:26.117]  I spoke to Islamic scholars in Tehran who
[01:12:26.819 --> 01:12:31.144]  This group has absolutely nothing to do with Islam.
[01:12:31.144 --> 01:12:42.074]  It has a lot to do, of course, with Saudi Arabia, which practices a very heretical form of Islam known as Wahhabism.
[01:12:42.074 --> 01:12:49.942]  They, on the other hand, look at any other Islamic sect, whether Shias, Sufis, or even other Sunni,
[01:12:50.622 --> 01:12:58.807]  And then you look at ISIL and you look at the fact that there's 12,000 foreign mercenaries from 81 different countries
[01:13:17.918 --> 01:13:26.941]  Including United States, Canada, many in Western Europe, who have no affiliation through marriage or family or anything with Islam.
[01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:30.402]  And you have to wonder, what is, what is ISIL?
[01:13:30.402 --> 01:13:37.844]  Is this actually the implementation of something known as the Yunnan Plan, formulated in 1982 by
[01:13:39.403 --> 01:13:39.603]  I think?
[01:13:58.436 --> 01:13:58.696]  I think?
[01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:19.893]  I would suggest that ISIL is an operation that was formulated
[01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:37.391]  By the U.S.
[01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:42.914]  CIA, the Mossad, and Saudi intelligence in the person of Prince Bandar.
[01:14:42.914 --> 01:14:47.256]  And we know how dirty he is, especially his names all over those missing 28 pages.
[01:14:48.427 --> 01:14:53.629]  from that Senate Joint Senate intelligence report on 9-11.
[01:14:53.629 --> 01:15:00.431]  So here are the real enemies of the United States and we're told by idiots like John McCain that they are our allies.
[01:15:00.431 --> 01:15:12.095]  I'm afraid not because on September 11th the leading Eastern Christian patriarchs met with President Obama in the White House and told him there was no such thing as Syrian moderate rebels that
[01:15:12.715 --> 01:15:22.738]  His support for the Syrian opposition had led and would lead to deaths amongst Syrian Christians and other minorities.
[01:15:22.738 --> 01:15:30.101]  And the same group was then spoken to by Ted Cruz, who's a Christian Zionist.
[01:15:30.101 --> 01:15:36.003]  And by the way, many Christians and even Islamic people, well-versed in the New Testament, told me in Tehran
[01:15:36.343 --> 01:15:36.503]  I think?
[01:15:55.035 --> 01:15:57.177]  People like Ted Cruz.
[01:15:57.177 --> 01:15:59.580]  He better make a decision on what he wants to be.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.261]  He can't be both.
[01:16:01.261 --> 01:16:03.183]  And I would even suggest he can't be president.
[01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:04.424]  He was born in Canada.
[01:16:04.424 --> 01:16:11.091]  So his rhetoric is not helpful to this debate we see about what's going on in the Middle East right now.
[01:16:11.803 --> 01:16:13.923]  We have a story here out of BBC News.
[01:16:13.923 --> 01:16:16.464]  Turkey allows Syria rebel training.
[01:16:16.464 --> 01:16:25.046]  Turkey has agreed to allow moderate Syrian rebels to be trained on its soil, the USA, in its bid to combat the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
[01:16:25.046 --> 01:16:29.847]  We've also got Saudi Arabia training those so-called moderate rebels.
[01:16:29.847 --> 01:16:36.508]  We've got the United States sending them more money, more arms, and yet we know that these arms, in many cases,
[01:16:37.108 --> 01:16:52.503]  fell directly into the hands of ISIS and in fact those so-called moderate rebels defected to and joined up with ISIS and gave them those arms that they had received from the likes of Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia in addition to Turkey.
[01:16:52.503 --> 01:17:00.571]  So Wayne, I mean, to what extent is the US policy in Syria of destabilizing the Assad regime responsible for the growth of ISIS?
[01:17:01.141 --> 01:17:07.565]  Absolutely connected to the growth of ISIL or ISIS, or as the Arabs call it, Daesh.
[01:17:07.565 --> 01:17:21.472]  This group, first of all, we know that McCain, with this fake PhD, Elizabeth Obagi, went into Syria last year and met with al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.
[01:17:21.472 --> 01:17:23.413]  Their picture was taken with him.
[01:17:23.413 --> 01:17:26.575]  And they tried to dance around this issue.
[01:17:27.415 --> 01:17:36.522]  But these ISIS ISIL guys are basically paid for by the Qataris and the Saudis.
[01:17:36.522 --> 01:17:43.628]  As a matter of fact, this coalition of Obama is a joke because we're told that Saudi and Emirati
[01:17:43.968 --> 01:17:44.168]  Yes.
[01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:12.081]  Packages of cash have arrived in ISIL hands in Aleppo in Syria complete with the Saudi and Qatari bank stamps on the wrappers around the cash.
[01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:17.103]  So this has to be the first time that we've seen a military attack.
[01:18:17.643 --> 01:18:19.986]  Groups that they're also financing.
[01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:22.549]  Their own governments are financing.
[01:18:22.549 --> 01:18:23.911]  The whole thing's a ruse.
[01:18:23.911 --> 01:18:25.112]  I'm afraid that the U.S.
[01:18:25.112 --> 01:18:27.695]  is not attacking ISIL positions.
[01:18:27.695 --> 01:18:32.861]  It's attacking Syrian military positions, Assad positions.
[01:18:32.861 --> 01:18:34.903]  For example, the U.S.
[01:18:34.903 --> 01:18:37.246]  claims it attacked the city of Raqqa.
[01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:43.049]  In the eastern Syria, it was two days after ISIL forces left the city.
[01:18:43.049 --> 01:18:50.633]  So we see this time with us also attacked a Syrian Air Force base that had not been taken over by ISIL.
[01:18:50.633 --> 01:18:52.494]  It was in the hands of the Syrian Air Force.
[01:18:52.954 --> 01:19:05.619]  I would suggest that either Obama is lying to the American people or his own military and intelligence services are not telling him what's going on on the ground over there.
[01:19:05.619 --> 01:19:09.361]  Perhaps he should send private emissaries over there.
[01:19:09.361 --> 01:19:17.404]  As I was in Tehran, he should send people to Damascus and to Tehran and to Beirut and find out himself what's going on over there.
[01:19:17.404 --> 01:19:21.766]  Those Eastern Christian patriarchs certainly told him
[01:19:22.086 --> 01:19:27.612]  And he seems surprised when they said, oh, there's no such thing as Syrian moderate rebels.
[01:19:27.612 --> 01:19:29.294]  He seems surprised at that.
[01:19:29.294 --> 01:19:33.658]  This guy's supposed to be intelligent and he's surprised by that?
[01:19:33.658 --> 01:19:34.999]  I'm surprised that he's surprised.
[01:19:35.899 --> 01:19:38.361]  We'll be back with Wayne Madsen after the break.
[01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:42.906]  We're going to get into the beheading videos which of course have aroused suspicion.
[01:19:42.906 --> 01:19:51.074]  They've served as a perfect propaganda tool for airstrikes on ISIS and yet we're told they're being produced by ISIS militants.
[01:19:51.074 --> 01:19:55.498]  Also going to go to your calls for Wayne Madsen on ISIS, Ebola and more.
[01:19:55.498 --> 01:19:58.461]  It's the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[01:19:58.461 --> 01:19:59.022]  Stay right there.

[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:07.362]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:13.123]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[01:21:13.123 --> 01:21:20.085]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[01:21:20.325 --> 01:21:29.568]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[01:21:29.568 --> 01:21:32.588]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.

[01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:03.470]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:08.591]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:16.712]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:16.712 --> 01:22:21.213]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:21.213 --> 01:22:25.034]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:25.194 --> 01:22:31.137]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:31.137 --> 01:22:34.319]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:34.319 --> 01:22:39.681]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:08.777]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:23:08.777 --> 01:23:18.063]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.

[01:23:35.255 --> 01:23:37.036]  That means big savings.
[01:23:37.036 --> 01:23:41.479]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:07.751]  Ira hates him.
[01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:10.414]  Ira hates him.
[01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:29.514]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:29.514 --> 01:24:34.276]  We're talking to Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist and NSA whistleblower.
[01:24:34.276 --> 01:24:38.418]  Talking about ISIS, here we have a story out of Infowars.com, Kurt Nimmo.
[01:24:38.418 --> 01:24:42.540]  ISIS now capable of downing airliners at Baghdad airport.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:46.302]  The US Embassy in Baghdad may soon fall prey to ISIS.
[01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:47.703]  They have the area surrounded.
[01:24:48.303 --> 01:24:54.267]  And they're armed with anti-aircraft missiles, thanks to our friends, the Saudi Arabians.
[01:24:54.267 --> 01:25:02.312]  Once again, we're going to get into Saudi Arabia's alliance with Israel, according to Wayne Madsen, coming up later in the show.
[01:25:02.312 --> 01:25:05.153]  But I just wanted to ask Wayne about these beheading videos.
[01:25:05.153 --> 01:25:12.238]  We had another hostage video, supposedly produced by ISIS yesterday, of the British journalist John Cantlie.
[01:25:13.078 --> 01:25:18.603]  Wayne, you know, given that these videos, they only seem to bolster the case for U.S.
[01:25:18.603 --> 01:25:24.067]  military expansion in the region, they bolster the case for airstrikes targeting ISIS.
[01:25:24.067 --> 01:25:26.069]  Very emotional propaganda.
[01:25:26.069 --> 01:25:30.412]  Again, a lot of questions have been asked about these videos.
[01:25:30.412 --> 01:25:38.559]  Should we be suspicious as to their origin, given previous examples of so-called Al-Qaeda videos which lead back to the Pentagon?
[01:25:38.559 --> 01:25:39.539]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:25:39.539 --> 01:25:42.061]  As a matter of fact, it seems like these videos are
[01:25:43.075 --> 01:25:53.840]  Quote-unquote discovered by an organization in Washington that I've been looking at for a number of years called the Search for International Terrorist Entities or CITE.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:06.046]  It's actually run by an Israeli Iraqi American named Rita Katz and listen, they were the ones who discovered a lot of these fake Bin Laden videos and now they're
[01:26:06.346 --> 01:26:08.469]  Discovering these beheading videos.
[01:26:08.469 --> 01:26:22.388]  I'm not suggesting that these people who have been killed ostensibly by beheading are not dead, but I think it's somewhat questionable as to whether they actually were beheaded live.
[01:26:23.829 --> 01:26:30.192]  The whole thing looks like a bad grade P movie.
[01:26:30.192 --> 01:26:39.337]  I think there's been some video forensics people who have looked at these videos and determined that there's a lot of fakery involved with their production.
[01:26:40.017 --> 01:26:43.078]  You know, after we saw the U.S.
[01:26:43.078 --> 01:26:59.081]  CIA compound stormed in Benghazi after the production of that trailer called The Innocence of Muslims, which involved a lot of dodgy people in Los Angeles, including those in the porn industry.
[01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:02.401]  You have to wonder, where are these videos coming from?
[01:27:02.401 --> 01:27:03.862]  What is the intention?
[01:27:03.862 --> 01:27:06.542]  And are they what they are purported to be?
[01:27:06.542 --> 01:27:08.463]  I have serious doubts about the
[01:27:10.403 --> 01:27:21.193]  I don't know whether these videos are in fact showing the headings, although I must say I believe that those hostages are probably dead, unfortunately.
[01:27:22.495 --> 01:27:27.418]  I mentioned Saudi Arabia earlier regarding their arming of ISIS with anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:27:27.418 --> 01:27:37.445]  You've got a new book out, The Star and the Sword, which alleges this alliance between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which was intimately involved in plotting the 9-11 attacks.
[01:27:37.445 --> 01:27:45.351]  So give us a rundown of some of that evidence and how this came to fruition regarding the connection to 9-11, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[01:27:46.172 --> 01:28:00.160]  Well, when I was actually on the trail of the perps behind 9-11, the one issue that came up is, you know, I was looking at the location of the 19 alleged hijackers.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.061]  I was also looking at the location of
[01:28:02.521 --> 01:28:15.369]  About 120 Israeli art students, they weren't really art students, they were obviously intelligence officers and agents, over here in the months leading up to 9-11.
[01:28:15.369 --> 01:28:23.434]  They were identified in a Drug Enforcement Administration report as being involved in some sort of intelligence operation in the United States.
[01:28:23.434 --> 01:28:30.218]  I was looking at the fact that they and the 19 hijackers were living in the same locations
[01:28:30.698 --> 01:28:53.066]  In places like Hollywood, Florida, Irving, Texas, near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, in North Jersey, very close to New York City, in places like Jersey City, for example, outside of Washington, D.C., and Laurel, Maryland, and other locations.
[01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:55.167]  And the problem was, you know,
[01:28:55.607 --> 01:28:55.767]  Do you?
[01:29:13.566 --> 01:29:33.380]  It predates Israel itself when the first modern Saudi King Ibn Saud sent a letter to Hayim Weissman, the head of the World Zionist Organization, saying, look, we have no problem, Luis Salves, with you establishing a homeland for the Jewish people in the British Mandate of Palestine.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.660]  It starts from there.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:40.484]  And obviously this was not a case where the Israelis were monitoring those hijackers.
[01:29:40.484 --> 01:29:43.026]  They were providing material support
[01:29:44.167 --> 01:29:46.768]  We'll be back after the break with more from Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:46.768 --> 01:29:47.629]  Take in your calls.
[01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:49.170]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:50.691]  Keep it locked in.
[01:29:50.691 --> 01:29:52.071]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.071 --> 01:29:53.692]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.692 --> 01:29:57.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.317 --> 01:30:08.479]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:08.479 --> 01:30:10.840]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:16.102]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:16.102 --> 01:30:21.284]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:21.284 --> 01:30:24.305]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:24.605 --> 01:30:28.668]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:28.668 --> 01:30:32.991]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:32.991 --> 01:30:43.237]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:45.739]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:30:45.939 --> 01:30:54.142]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:30:54.142 --> 01:30:58.104]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:01.385 --> 01:31:03.606]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:31:03.606 --> 01:31:11.668]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:11.668 --> 01:31:18.850]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:23.813]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:31:23.813 --> 01:31:34.419]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:31:34.419 --> 01:31:40.923]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:31:40.923 --> 01:31:43.485]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:31:43.485 --> 01:31:47.127]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:31:47.247 --> 01:31:49.888]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:49.888 --> 01:31:54.110]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:55.451]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:17.543 --> 01:32:28.375]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:35.283]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:39.125]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:40.345]  Others don't.
[01:32:40.345 --> 01:32:42.486]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:42.486 --> 01:32:44.287]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:44.287 --> 01:32:47.169]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:47.169 --> 01:32:51.411]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:32:56.494 --> 01:32:58.855]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:32:58.855 --> 01:32:59.736]  Others don't.
[01:33:01.513 --> 01:33:03.875]  We've got it.
[01:33:03.875 --> 01:33:08.658]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:08.658 --> 01:33:10.939]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:10.939 --> 01:33:13.041]  Alright, here I go.
[01:33:13.041 --> 01:33:20.966]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:20.966 --> 01:33:22.667]  Are we seeing the earth?
[01:33:22.667 --> 01:33:25.569]  We've got it.
[01:33:25.569 --> 01:33:28.612]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[01:33:30.484 --> 01:33:36.349]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, going to your calls for Wayne Madsen here in a minute.
[01:33:36.349 --> 01:33:41.774]  Just before the break, Wayne was talking about the connection between Israel, Saudi Arabia and 9-11.
[01:33:41.774 --> 01:33:45.717]  Wayne, just finish up your thoughts on that subject, the alliance, the involvement in 9-11.
[01:33:46.874 --> 01:33:52.156]  Well, you know, people would say, well, why would Saudi Arabia support 9-11?
[01:33:52.156 --> 01:33:57.118]  Because, you know, 15 of the 19 alleged hijackers were Saudi nationals.
[01:33:57.118 --> 01:33:59.479]  But we've seen this time and time again.
[01:33:59.479 --> 01:34:06.701]  The Saudi Arabians have, of course, paid bin Laden off not to attack the kingdom.
[01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:11.623]  And all of Saudi Arabia's national security infrastructure is geared to one thing.
[01:34:12.103 --> 01:34:12.384]  I think?
[01:34:27.481 --> 01:34:45.479]  Basing agreements and forward location storage areas for Israeli weapons in the event Israel decides to strike Iran and their alleged nuclear facilities, which I basically ascertain there is no nuclear weapons program in Iran.
[01:34:45.859 --> 01:35:00.769]  The CIA was right in 2003 when they made that determination and that determination is still valid and anything that Yahoo says the contrary is just typical propaganda from him and people who support him and his government.
[01:35:00.769 --> 01:35:04.672]  But the Saudis, the Qataris, the Bahrainis, the Emiratis,
[01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:05.412]  I think?
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:22.220]  I'm
[01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:47.608]  I think?
[01:36:08.993 --> 01:36:16.839]  So basically, ISIS are pawns that they can move around the globe, move around the Middle East, to justify military intervention?
[01:36:16.839 --> 01:36:17.900]  They're not even Muslims.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:18.981]  They claim they're Muslims.
[01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:21.903]  They claim they're establishing a caliphate.
[01:36:21.903 --> 01:36:27.388]  As a matter of fact, I spoke to representatives of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah in Tehran.
[01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:32.992]  And for Netanyahu to suggest that Hamas and ISIL are the same thing, he's lying again.
[01:36:32.992 --> 01:36:35.373]  The only thing that man knows how to do is lie.
[01:36:44.299 --> 01:37:04.089]  If we wanted allies to fight ISIL, if Obama wants a real coalition, we should make peace with Assad and join him and the government of Iran and then also supply weapons to Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad because they will go in and wipe these guys clean.
[01:37:04.089 --> 01:37:11.953]  But that's not, you know, that's my dream team to get rid of ISIL but of course it's not going to happen because our foreign policy has been hijacked.
[01:37:12.273 --> 01:37:14.615]  By external interests.
[01:37:14.615 --> 01:37:20.620]  Interests that do not have the national security concerns of this country first at hand.
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:22.361]  Okay, we're going to go to your calls now.
[01:37:22.361 --> 01:37:24.002]  Gennaro in Arizona.
[01:37:24.002 --> 01:37:24.703]  You're on the air.
[01:37:24.703 --> 01:37:26.364]  Go ahead.
[01:37:26.364 --> 01:37:27.265]  Yes, thank you, Paul.
[01:37:27.265 --> 01:37:29.647]  Thank you, David and Wayne, for taking my call.
[01:37:29.647 --> 01:37:32.069]  You know, a couple of things.
[01:37:32.069 --> 01:37:39.475]  You hear the FBI director, James Comey, criticizing Apple and Google about developing encryptions to secure
[01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:44.794]  Um, so secure that even police and the NSA can't even access.
[01:37:44.794 --> 01:37:53.562]  I mean, I just think that is the most ludicrous, absurd statement to make, especially on the heels of the iCloud.
[01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:54.692]  I don't know.
[01:38:13.547 --> 01:38:20.070]  Regardless of any kind of encryption, if the NSA or the government wants to get to your information, they're going to get it.
[01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:23.692]  And I'm sure that they have very sophisticated ways of getting it wirelessly.
[01:38:23.692 --> 01:38:28.955]  They're not going to need, you know, a warrant to go and get information from Apple or Google.
[01:38:28.955 --> 01:38:30.656]  So, what is your comment on that?
[01:38:31.263 --> 01:38:37.705]  Yeah, this is a battle I fought with other privacy advocates back in the 90s.
[01:38:37.705 --> 01:38:52.108]  Some people may recall the Clinton administration's plan to implement something called the Clipper Chip, where you would be able to encrypt your data, but you would have to give your encryption key over to the government, who would then share it with the NSA or the FBI.
[01:38:52.108 --> 01:38:58.230]  They said if they had a court order, we didn't believe that that was the mechanism they were going to use.
[01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:04.615]  Comey is just like Louis free was back in those battles in the 90s.
[01:39:04.615 --> 01:39:17.750]  They want they do not want encryption used by private citizens or businesses because they want to have real time access to encrypted communications without going through any steps.
[01:39:17.970 --> 01:39:18.570]  But you're right.
[01:39:18.570 --> 01:39:28.876]  NSA, given enough time, they're building this huge supercomputer in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by the way, that will be able to decrypt anything within probably seconds.
[01:39:28.876 --> 01:39:30.997]  But yeah, if they want it, they're going to get it.
[01:39:30.997 --> 01:39:39.121]  But the people that are penalized, as you suggest, not that I, you know, I'm interested in the bottom line of Google or Apple, but
[01:39:39.481 --> 01:39:52.788]  It does hurt their foreign sales when there are these restrictions placed on encryption and also their domestic sales for people that are worried about their private data being compromised.
[01:39:52.788 --> 01:39:54.449]  And I had to laugh.
[01:39:54.449 --> 01:39:59.271]  I was recently looking at some ads inside the D.C.
[01:39:59.271 --> 01:40:04.314]  Metro and they were advertising government clouds like that's some sort of
[01:40:04.654 --> 01:40:06.717]  Security for these government agencies.
[01:40:06.717 --> 01:40:09.420]  It was AT&T actually that was advertising it.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:14.306]  I can't think of anything more ludicrous than a government putting its sensitive data in a cloud.
[01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:17.369]  I can't believe anybody would put their sensitive data in a cloud.
[01:40:18.186 --> 01:40:19.226]  Thanks for the call.
[01:40:19.226 --> 01:40:23.128]  Also, Wayne, there was a comment by Google's Eric Schmidt a couple of days ago.
[01:40:23.128 --> 01:40:28.329]  He gave a speech saying that basically NSA surveillance threatens to break the Internet.
[01:40:28.329 --> 01:40:34.491]  Now, this was the same guy who said, if you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[01:40:34.491 --> 01:40:45.875]  I mean, is it a sign that the NSA surveillance has so destabilized the very structure of the Internet that even people like Eric Schmidt are now paranoid that it could break the entire World Wide Web?
[01:40:46.294 --> 01:40:46.955]  Well, perhaps.
[01:40:46.955 --> 01:40:53.760]  Maybe Eric Schmidt should have discussed this with Keith Alexander at the several Bilderberg meetings they attended together.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.063]  Maybe he should have expressed his concerns then before this got out of hand.
[01:40:58.063 --> 01:41:00.165]  But yeah, it's typical.
[01:41:00.165 --> 01:41:14.275]  These CEOs from the Silicon Valley companies and, you know, and all these other high tech companies, at first they defend, you know, NSA, or at least they don't say anything critical of them.
[01:41:14.275 --> 01:41:15.236]  And then they find out
[01:41:15.656 --> 01:41:17.437]  Oh, my God, it's worse than I thought.
[01:41:17.437 --> 01:41:24.662]  But, you know, I mean, yeah, he had more than enough opportunity to make these concerns known personally to Alexander.
[01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:32.266]  And I'm sure he will in the future when Alexander's replacement, Admiral Mike Rogers, attends these same conclaves.
[01:41:32.266 --> 01:41:37.229]  It seems like Bilderberg loves to have the NSA director at all their meetings these days.
[01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:43.013]  So let Schmidt and the other, these other high tech gurus complain to them in person at the next one.
[01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.890]  J.J.
[01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:45.671]  in Texas, you're on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[01:41:45.671 --> 01:41:47.271]  Go ahead, J.J.
[01:41:47.271 --> 01:41:48.412]  Hey, Mr. Madsen.
[01:41:48.412 --> 01:41:49.292]  Good to talk to you today.
[01:41:49.292 --> 01:41:50.833]  How's it going over there?
[01:41:50.833 --> 01:41:51.133]  Good.
[01:41:51.133 --> 01:41:52.413]  How are you?
[01:41:52.413 --> 01:41:53.053]  I'm doing great.
[01:41:53.053 --> 01:41:56.655]  I have a comment about 9-11 since that came up.
[01:41:56.655 --> 01:42:07.219]  Isn't it strange that our government flew out the family of the wanted hijacker behind 9-11, Osama Bin Laden, and all his family got to fly out?
[01:42:07.219 --> 01:42:09.399]  Isn't that a false flag there, number one?
[01:42:09.399 --> 01:42:09.980]  And number two,
[01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:17.492]  Isn't it true that Pakistan's intelligence is called ISI?
[01:42:17.492 --> 01:42:17.792]  Yes.
[01:42:17.792 --> 01:42:21.673]  Is there any correlation between ISIS and Pakistan?
[01:42:21.673 --> 01:42:40.280]  That's not determined except one thing I discovered in Iran that we now know that ISIL is crossing over the Iraqi border into Iran using some kind of open smuggling routes in the Kurdish area in the northern part of Iran where a lot of stuff that's
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:45.985]  Basically illegal in Iran is smuggled by mostly Armenian businessmen.
[01:42:45.985 --> 01:42:48.148]  Things like beer, for example.
[01:42:48.148 --> 01:42:52.112]  And ISIL's using these same smuggling routes to get their people across.
[01:42:52.112 --> 01:43:01.623]  At the same time, Pakistan, there's a group there called Jundala, which is a Baluchi terrorist group that's supported by the United States.
[01:43:02.063 --> 01:43:02.544]  I think?
[01:43:22.098 --> 01:43:22.859]  I think?
[01:43:41.526 --> 01:43:41.807]  I think?
[01:43:57.325 --> 01:44:00.107]  You know, we were told there was this no-fly policy.
[01:44:00.107 --> 01:44:04.531]  There were a lot of planes flying after 9-11 we weren't told about.
[01:44:04.531 --> 01:44:12.897]  One of which was the 747 that took the Bin Laden family and dropped them off in Paris and Geneva.
[01:44:12.897 --> 01:44:17.081]  And they flew in from various locations around the country.
[01:44:18.041 --> 01:44:28.709]  Yeah, we protected Bin Laden's family, but we did very little to protect the first responders who have died and are very sick in New York and Washington, D.C.
[01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:30.030]  JJ, thanks for the call.
[01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:31.351]  VAC in Wisconsin.
[01:44:31.351 --> 01:44:33.052]  You're on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[01:44:33.052 --> 01:44:36.655]  Go ahead, VAC.
[01:44:36.655 --> 01:44:37.295]  VAC's gone.
[01:44:37.295 --> 01:44:38.616]  We've got Tom in New Jersey.
[01:44:38.616 --> 01:44:39.356]  You're on the air, Tom.
[01:44:39.356 --> 01:44:39.737]  Go ahead.
[01:44:40.768 --> 01:44:43.449]  Good day, Mr. Madison and Mr. Watson.
[01:44:43.449 --> 01:44:56.415]  My question, Mr. Madison, is Mr. Duncan in Dallas, Texas, they're calling him patient zero, but patient zero happened last year in December in Guinea, I believe.
[01:44:56.415 --> 01:44:59.096]  It was a two-year-old boy.
[01:44:59.096 --> 01:45:03.578]  The origin of Ebola, they're trying to say, is either, of course, infected
[01:45:04.728 --> 01:45:14.413]  Animal corpses or fruit bats, but they leave out the last shell which could be, of course, a two-year-old boy getting vaccinations.
[01:45:17.890 --> 01:45:33.627]  I tell you, when they talk about the guy who died, Mr. Duncan, in Texas as being patient zero, obviously we know that there are now maybe 5,000 people in West Africa who have died of this disease.
[01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:35.209]  I may be global in that number.
[01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:36.389]  We're not getting.
[01:45:36.389 --> 01:45:45.372]  And for Obama to send the military over to deal with a public health issue, I really question whether AFRICOM, which was designed to protect U.S.
[01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:55.116]  business interests, oil interests, and other interests in Africa, is well-placed to deal with this developing pandemic in West Africa.
[01:45:55.116 --> 01:45:59.137]  So one thing the military does do when they go into an area,
[01:45:59.457 --> 01:46:04.401]  They tend to keep dozy journalists out.
[01:46:04.401 --> 01:46:11.727]  They put what's called an information cone over the area where no independent news goes out.
[01:46:11.727 --> 01:46:17.793]  That's what I'm very skeptical and suspicious about with Obama's deployment of troops into West Africa.
[01:46:18.513 --> 01:46:19.794]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:46:19.794 --> 01:46:26.440]  Yeah, so picking up on that, Wayne, I mean, we've seen Chinese economic expansion in Africa outstripping the U.S.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:33.087]  So do you believe that this Ebola outbreak and other so-called crises like that are being used as pretext to send U.S.
[01:46:33.087 --> 01:46:38.812]  troops into the region to establish strongholds that will later benefit economically the U.S.
[01:46:38.812 --> 01:46:40.914]  military-industrial complex in that region?
[01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:42.335]  It could very well be.
[01:46:42.335 --> 01:46:53.762]  You know, we're already in there to fight these groups that are active now in West Africa as a result of the Neocons' foolhardy project to get rid of Gaddafi in Libya.
[01:46:53.762 --> 01:47:01.307]  That just turned out all this weaponry and these jihadists who are now active in Mali and Burkina Faso and Niger.
[01:47:01.787 --> 01:47:08.810]  And with Boko Haram, and Nigeria, and Ansar Dine, and Northern Mali, and other countries.
[01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:15.132]  So these American troops are supplementing troops that are already in West Africa.
[01:47:15.132 --> 01:47:23.415]  Now, you know, the one country that has provided top shelf medical care to West Africa is Cuba.
[01:47:23.415 --> 01:47:27.937]  And we know because of this ridiculous quarantine or boycott we've had,
[01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:30.918]  I mean, you know, you just gotta wonder.
[01:47:49.985 --> 01:47:53.968]  Who's in charge of things in Washington, D.C.?
[01:47:53.968 --> 01:48:03.834]  And the people in West Africa know that when they see these Cuban doctors, they're going to start getting the best medical care available.
[01:48:03.834 --> 01:48:10.759]  And I don't care what Ileana Ross-Letnan and her gang of gusanos in South Florida have to say about it.
[01:48:10.759 --> 01:48:13.060]  Those Cubans are needed in West Africa.
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:18.244]  And if anything, we should be using our military planes to fly more Cuban doctors over there.
[01:48:19.386 --> 01:48:21.046]  Switching topics now.
[01:48:21.046 --> 01:48:24.467]  Ukraine, I know this is something you've been focusing on in the past.
[01:48:24.467 --> 01:48:27.848]  We've seen a kind of quieting of tensions in recent weeks.
[01:48:27.848 --> 01:48:29.169]  We've had a ceasefire.
[01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:32.169]  Putin withdrawing troops from eastern Ukraine.
[01:48:32.169 --> 01:48:37.951]  Do you see that crisis as ebbing away or is it going to spark back into life here in the near future?
[01:48:38.416 --> 01:48:57.095]  Well that crisis is now going from sort of the battlefield to the corporate boardrooms throughout Europe and also the Middle East because winter is now approaching and this idea of sanctions on Russia which affects their ability to ship their natural gas
[01:48:57.575 --> 01:49:14.987]  And other energy supplies to Western Europe is really starting to impact on Western Europe and we already seen now unemployment rise in Germany as a result of this ill-conceived sanctions against Russia.
[01:49:14.987 --> 01:49:21.111]  French farmers are now dumping their produce that they would normally sell to Russia in town squares.
[01:49:21.551 --> 01:49:30.619]  And all we get from Francois Hollande, the French president, is more talk about more EU sanctions.
[01:49:30.619 --> 01:49:39.887]  Look, that was a coup d'etat in Kiev by a bunch of neo-Nazis and fascists.
[01:49:39.887 --> 01:49:46.753]  And it was Victoria Nuland at the State Department who promoted that.
[01:49:46.753 --> 01:49:48.995]  And now we have a West German, I mean a German,
[01:49:49.475 --> 01:50:00.041]  A news report that the Ukrainian army, they wear helmets with swastikas and SS symbols on them.
[01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:09.405]  I mean, this is, you know, no wonder Russia, Russia doesn't, you do something like that and Russia remembers what happened in World War II, you know.
[01:50:11.887 --> 01:50:27.465]  25 million Soviet citizens lost their lives as a result of the German Nazi attack on Russia and to have Ukrainian troops wearing Nazi helmets going in to kill Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine
[01:50:28.525 --> 01:50:36.449]  I would have reacted as much as Putin did, and he secured that Russian base in Crimea, where there's a majority Russian population.
[01:50:36.449 --> 01:50:46.673]  We would have done the same thing if one of our overseas military bases were put in jeopardy, and he took that base without firing a shot.
[01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:47.453]  Nobody died.
[01:50:47.453 --> 01:50:52.155]  Of course, if we did, we'd do shock and awe, and we'd kill a lot of civilians.
[01:50:52.155 --> 01:50:55.317]  So, who's the more civilized person here?

[01:52:06.946 --> 01:52:09.548]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:52:09.548 --> 01:52:16.651]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:52:16.651 --> 01:52:19.473]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:52:19.753 --> 01:52:22.654]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:52:22.654 --> 01:52:24.595]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:52:24.595 --> 01:52:27.556]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:52:27.556 --> 01:52:33.257]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:52:33.257 --> 01:52:36.759]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[01:54:30.685 --> 01:54:35.906]  But the great line of health products at InfoWars.com continues to impress.

[01:54:44.008 --> 01:54:46.028]  This is nascent iodine.

[01:54:47.868 --> 01:54:49.889]  It tastes like absolute garbage.
[01:54:50.749 --> 01:54:56.832]  This doesn't have that bad taste that's associated with many of the common iodine solutions on the market.
[01:54:56.832 --> 01:55:01.894]  It's time to get prepared with Survival Shield X2 from Infowarslife.com.

[01:55:21.591 --> 01:55:24.837]  Final call for Wayne Madsen, it's Julio in Wyoming.
[01:55:24.837 --> 01:55:26.019]  Julio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:55:27.379 --> 01:55:28.780]  Good afternoon to both, Wayne.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:31.761]  I've been a big fan of yours for a while.
[01:55:31.761 --> 01:55:38.203]  It's also nice to see my former Senator, Mark Kirk, have some nice comments for you.
[01:55:38.203 --> 01:55:44.346]  Wayne Madsen, he had some positive things to say about you, so it's nice to see Mark Kirk showing his true colors.
[01:55:44.346 --> 01:55:47.627]  I want to ask you, I've spoken to you about this before, about
[01:55:48.387 --> 01:55:57.011]  How big blackmail is and how so many of these political actors are, you know, pretty much hold to a noose because of blackmail.
[01:55:57.011 --> 01:56:03.915]  And we know our good friend Barry Fitoro and his relationships with Mr. Sinclair or Reggie Love.
[01:56:03.915 --> 01:56:05.916]  All these actors are blackmailed.
[01:56:05.916 --> 01:56:06.996]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:56:06.996 --> 01:56:09.217]  And secondly, Vice Media.
[01:56:09.217 --> 01:56:12.439]  I know you've written so many articles on your website about Vice.
[01:56:12.959 --> 01:56:20.462]  And, you know, they have Uncle Rupert's money, as well as Uncle George's money, Soros and Murdoch behind it.
[01:56:20.462 --> 01:56:21.803]  They covered Ukraine.
[01:56:21.803 --> 01:56:23.483]  You talked about the neo-Nazis.
[01:56:23.483 --> 01:56:35.888]  It's not surprising Vice Media would support what was happening in Ukraine when Senator McCain openly spoke at the Brookings Institute with Senator Murphy of Connecticut about a technocracy in Ukraine.
[01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:40.810]  And we know how technocratic regimes in Greece and Italy have worked thus far.
[01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:42.271]  Can you elaborate on those two issues?
[01:56:42.768 --> 01:56:50.755]  Yeah, on Vice, of course, that also involves Bill Maher, who produces their program on HBO.
[01:56:50.755 --> 01:56:58.241]  And I just would caution people about the news reports coming out of North Korea about the status of Kim Jong-un.
[01:56:58.241 --> 01:57:01.384]  Don't believe them because a lot of them are being filtered through Vice.
[01:57:01.864 --> 01:57:07.569]  And then, you know, they were the ones who accompanied Dennis Rodman over there on his trip.
[01:57:07.569 --> 01:57:09.371]  Take whatever they say with a grain of salt.
[01:57:09.371 --> 01:57:12.514]  We know that Bill Maher is an Islamophobe.
[01:57:12.514 --> 01:57:13.054]  We know that.
[01:57:13.054 --> 01:57:18.319]  Thank God Ben Affleck called him and that other clown Sam Harris out on their Islamophobia.
[01:57:18.839 --> 01:57:21.222]  On blackmail, you mentioned McCain.
[01:57:21.222 --> 01:57:24.145]  What have they got on this guy?
[01:57:24.145 --> 01:57:26.807]  Obviously he's blackmailed three ways from Sunday.
[01:57:38.058 --> 01:57:42.123]  They know he was singing like a canary to his North Vietnamese captors.
[01:57:42.123 --> 01:57:48.650]  For six months, he was giving operational schedules for U.S.
[01:57:48.650 --> 01:57:51.794]  attack flights into North Vietnam.
[01:57:51.794 --> 01:57:56.860]  He also was responsible for the terrible fire on USS Forrestal that killed
[01:57:57.376 --> 01:57:58.317]  I don't know.
[01:58:15.546 --> 01:58:17.168]  Uh, that catastrophe.
[01:58:17.168 --> 01:58:20.271]  So yeah, they got that on him and they got a lot of other stuff on McCain.
[01:58:20.271 --> 01:58:21.192]  He's just one of many.
[01:58:21.192 --> 01:58:33.322]  Mark Kirk, uh, look, I reported he, you know, it came out after he, his, his marriage, uh, uh, went on the rocks and he was the first that he, he was a well-known homosexual in Illinois.
[01:58:33.322 --> 01:58:35.124]  We'll be back after the break with Wayne Manson.
[01:58:35.124 --> 01:58:36.245]  I'm going to take one more call.
[01:58:36.245 --> 01:58:36.766]  Stay tuned.
[01:58:36.766 --> 01:58:38.407]  This is Infowars.com.

[01:58:57.621 --> 01:58:58.442]  Security alert.
[01:58:58.442 --> 01:58:59.663]  Security alert.
[01:58:59.663 --> 01:59:01.684]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:01.684 --> 01:59:05.187]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operation.
[01:59:05.187 --> 01:59:10.271]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:10.271 --> 01:59:12.833]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:12.833 --> 01:59:15.716]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:15.716 --> 01:59:18.938]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:18.938 --> 01:59:21.100]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.761]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:22.761 --> 01:59:24.923]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:24.923 --> 01:59:27.545]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:27.545 --> 01:59:31.568]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:47.641]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:59:47.641 --> 01:59:48.362]  You can feel it.
[01:59:54.321 --> 01:59:56.708]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.708 --> 01:59:59.476]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[02:00:15.339 --> 02:00:19.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[02:00:27.202 --> 02:00:29.403]  It's the final hour of the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:00:29.403 --> 02:00:32.004]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex.
[02:00:32.004 --> 02:00:36.386]  We're talking to NSA whistleblower and investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[02:00:36.386 --> 02:00:38.407]  Gonna go to another of your calls right now.
[02:00:38.407 --> 02:00:42.449]  The website for Wayne, by the way, is waynemadsenreport.com.
[02:00:42.449 --> 02:00:44.630]  We're gonna go to Austin in Michigan.
[02:00:44.630 --> 02:00:45.170]  You're on the air.
[02:00:45.170 --> 02:00:47.171]  Go ahead, Austin.
[02:00:47.171 --> 02:00:49.672]  Hey, how's it going, guys?
[02:00:49.672 --> 02:00:50.233]  Good, go ahead.
[02:00:51.354 --> 02:00:53.938]  I was calling about a number of things.
[02:00:53.938 --> 02:00:59.486]  One of the things I wanted to ask about is the thing going on with Russia and Ukraine as well as Ebola and stuff.
[02:00:59.486 --> 02:01:07.198]  Could that also be like, you know, a preset, kind of a fog of war for things that might possibly be going on in North Korea or China, that China's trying to do?
[02:01:08.641 --> 02:01:37.240]  Well, one thing about ISIL that I also discovered from talking to cop journalist colleagues that gathered in Tehran for this journalism and many professors were there, scholars and whatnot, is that ISIL's leadership was controlled by some North Africans and a couple weeks ago the CIA and their other controllers went in
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:49.747]  And had Chechens from the Republic of Georgia and Uyghurs from Western China basically killed their mostly Tunisian commanders.
[02:01:49.747 --> 02:01:53.549]  They actually beheaded them in Syria and they took over.
[02:01:53.549 --> 02:02:01.034]  And the idea is that the Chechens from Georgia and the Uyghurs from Western China, after they
[02:02:01.594 --> 02:02:08.138]  Uh, take care of Iraq and Syria and Iran are gonna go after Russia and China respectively.
[02:02:08.138 --> 02:02:14.061]  So there's more to this whole ISIL story than we're being told.
[02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:22.306]  And I think all the suspicion should go on CIA Director John Brennan, who made the pilgrimage to Mecca.
[02:02:22.666 --> 02:02:25.407]  He's very close to the Saudi regime.
[02:02:25.407 --> 02:02:40.515]  He's the guy who's been promoting these radical top theories in ISIL, and he's the guy who really needs to have his head on a stake, and no one else, because he's the guy who is ultimately responsible for this group being created.
[02:02:40.515 --> 02:02:44.197]  Anthony in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead, quick question.
[02:02:44.197 --> 02:02:46.598]  Yes, I have two questions for Mr. Madsen.
[02:02:46.598 --> 02:02:48.079]  Only time for one, make it quick.
[02:02:49.079 --> 02:02:50.961]  Okay, okay.
[02:02:50.961 --> 02:03:05.172]  What does he think of the fact that, does he believe that China at some point might challenge the United States in the same way that Germany challenged the British Empire?
[02:03:06.306 --> 02:03:15.449]  No, I think China is actually, look, China's history, recent history, they have never really attacked anybody except when they felt their security was threatened.
[02:03:15.449 --> 02:03:20.791]  The attack on North Korea during the Korean War was because we posed a threat to them.
[02:03:20.791 --> 02:03:27.394]  They are staking a claim to the South China Sea, just like we stake claims to our territorial waters.
[02:03:28.414 --> 02:03:41.497]  It's all about natural gas and oil and Obama decided to pivot to Asia as a direct military confrontation against China in China's own backyard.
[02:03:41.497 --> 02:03:53.179]  Asia is not our backyard, it's China's backyard, but Obama has decided he's going to not only take on Russia with Ukraine and other former Soviet republics, he's going to take on China
[02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:54.760]  Okay, final 20 seconds, Wayne.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.200]  Tell people how they can get your book.
[02:04:23.303 --> 02:04:26.784]  Well, it's available on my website, waynemadsonreport.com.
[02:04:26.784 --> 02:04:30.345]  That book and a number of others are available.
[02:04:30.345 --> 02:04:35.067]  They just click on that and they can order it from Amazon, Create, or Lulu Press.
[02:04:35.067 --> 02:04:38.308]  Okay, Wayne Madson, NSA whistleblower and investigative journalist.
[02:04:38.308 --> 02:04:40.289]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:04:40.987 --> 02:04:41.428]  You bet.
[02:04:41.428 --> 02:04:42.008]  Anytime.
[02:04:42.008 --> 02:04:42.789]  Thank you.
[02:04:42.789 --> 02:04:43.350]  Thank you.
[02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:46.214]  After the break, Anthony Gucciardi with Police State News.
[02:04:46.214 --> 02:04:52.421]  We're going to go to more of your calls and hit more Ebola news, breaking news up on InfoWars.com.
[02:04:52.421 --> 02:04:53.042]  Check it out.
[02:04:53.042 --> 02:04:53.603]  Stay tuned.
[02:04:53.603 --> 02:04:55.265]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:05:01.713 --> 02:05:05.376]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:05.376 --> 02:05:09.639]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:09.639 --> 02:05:11.440]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:19.285]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:19.285 --> 02:05:20.426]  But for how long?
[02:05:20.426 --> 02:05:22.648]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:27.071]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:27.071 --> 02:05:28.952]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:05:28.952 --> 02:05:29.893]  Just won't quit.
[02:05:31.317 --> 02:05:34.818]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:34.818 --> 02:05:43.059]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:43.059 --> 02:05:48.481]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:48.481 --> 02:05:51.001]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:05:51.001 --> 02:05:53.102]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:05:53.102 --> 02:05:57.302]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:01.305 --> 02:06:07.491]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:06:07.491 --> 02:06:10.934]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:10.934 --> 02:06:12.575]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[02:06:12.575 --> 02:06:18.941]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:18.941 --> 02:06:24.846]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:06:24.986 --> 02:06:28.948]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:31.829]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:06:31.829 --> 02:06:40.293]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:06:40.293 --> 02:06:42.394]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:43.415]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:06:43.795 --> 02:06:52.745]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[02:06:52.745 --> 02:06:55.409]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[02:06:55.409 --> 02:06:59.714]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[02:07:01.488 --> 02:07:02.749]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:02.749 --> 02:07:07.733]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:07.733 --> 02:07:10.395]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:10.395 --> 02:07:17.441]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:17.441 --> 02:07:20.444]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:20.444 --> 02:07:23.466]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:23.466 --> 02:07:28.290]  Well, here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:34.054]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:34.054 --> 02:07:37.557]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:37.557 --> 02:07:40.659]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:40.659 --> 02:07:47.964]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:07:47.964 --> 02:07:51.206]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:07:51.206 --> 02:07:57.471]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today to purchase your ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[02:07:57.551 --> 02:08:00.053]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.051 --> 02:08:27.052]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.052 --> 02:08:38.280]  I'm joined in studio by Anthony Gucciardi, who had an interesting experience this past weekend in Houston with grope-down procedures being conducted outside of music concerts.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:39.901]  Of course, we've seen that back before.
[02:08:39.901 --> 02:08:48.347]  In 2012, we had a report where the Detroit Music Festival was staffed by these individuals who carried out TSA-style grope-downs.
[02:08:48.747 --> 02:08:49.829]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:08:49.829 --> 02:08:50.189]  Ebola.
[02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:52.252]  We're going to go to more of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:52.252 --> 02:08:58.320]  Anthony, tell us about this experience this past weekend.
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:03.527]  Well, it's amazing to me that no matter what you're doing, it seems that you cannot escape the police state.
[02:09:03.527 --> 02:09:05.670]  You cannot escape being treated like a terrorist.
[02:09:06.451 --> 02:09:19.477]  In the way that they once said that these groping protocols, I'm talking about flashlights looking down your pants, and there's photos we're going to show you if you're watching live on PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowars.com slash show.
[02:09:19.477 --> 02:09:24.819]  But overall, you cannot escape being groped and treated like a terrorist.
[02:09:24.819 --> 02:09:29.681]  And what happened was, I was convinced, hey, you know, with some friends, let's go see this show.
[02:09:29.681 --> 02:09:30.922]  Let's go see a major show.
[02:09:30.922 --> 02:09:33.023]  It's outside of Houston at this pavilion.
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:36.762]  And I actually thought the whole premise was it's a distraction, right?
[02:09:36.762 --> 02:09:43.426]  Get away from all of this, get away just for a couple of hours from the whole spectrum of the police state and all of this research.
[02:09:43.426 --> 02:10:00.538]  So, not only, though, is there a two-hour line to get in, about a two-hour line sitting there waiting because of these security agents, which is a private security firm led by these police that were going back and forth, but what was happening was it was a TSA-style search.
[02:10:01.219 --> 02:10:04.857]  I'm talking about, and we're going to show you, having people take their shoes off.
[02:10:05.965 --> 02:10:09.127]  Lifting your shirt up to about your nipple area.
[02:10:09.127 --> 02:10:15.211]  Them going in with flashlights, grabbing your pants and boxers, pulling them back, looking in.
[02:10:15.211 --> 02:10:20.514]  And there's, meanwhile, there's speaker systems saying like, stay in an orderly line.
[02:10:20.514 --> 02:10:24.677]  You will be searched according to the security protocols of this pavilion.
[02:10:24.677 --> 02:10:26.618]  You know, just worthless bureaucracy.
[02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:31.141]  And all these security quote-unquote agents are like, nothing against them, just, you know,
[02:10:32.121 --> 02:10:40.787]  70 year old man that probably couldn't work at Walmart going in and searching you and just asking the same questions Do you have anything on your person that's not allowed in the venue?
[02:10:40.787 --> 02:10:45.090]  And they just will pull your pants back with a flashlight and search you and there was an older guy
[02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:50.912]  Next to us, who was really nice, and he just was like, oh yes, I haven't, you know, been to such a venue in a while.
[02:10:50.912 --> 02:10:54.133]  He was walking through, and they're like, okay, sir, take your shoes off.
[02:10:54.133 --> 02:10:55.314]  He had a cane.
[02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:56.434]  He couldn't even walk.
[02:10:56.434 --> 02:10:57.135]  And he had to bend down.
[02:10:57.135 --> 02:10:58.895]  Someone was trying to help him take his shoes off.
[02:10:58.895 --> 02:11:00.496]  They didn't even help him at all.
[02:11:00.496 --> 02:11:02.637]  One of his, some woman had to help him.
[02:11:02.637 --> 02:11:05.858]  And we had been saying things like, you know, this is insane.
[02:11:05.858 --> 02:11:09.420]  And I went and I said, look at this, look at this al-Qaeda terrorist right here.
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.001]  And it was the older guy, right?
[02:11:12.001 --> 02:11:16.164]  And I'm going to go into the story a little, because there was a guy in front of me with a crew cut.
[02:11:16.164 --> 02:11:19.006]  And he looked like a Fed, really, but I didn't think anything of it.
[02:11:19.006 --> 02:11:21.467]  I'm not always constantly saying Fed, Fed, Fed.
[02:11:21.467 --> 02:11:28.712]  But as it turns out, it was me and my friend, we were saying, look at this, you know, racist over here being facetious.
[02:11:28.712 --> 02:11:29.512]  Look at this terrorist.
[02:11:29.512 --> 02:11:33.315]  Look at this al-Qaeda operative, this older gentleman trying to get through security.
[02:11:33.315 --> 02:11:35.416]  Well, the guy in front of us didn't like that.
[02:11:35.416 --> 02:11:36.277]  And he was with his wife.
[02:11:37.267 --> 02:11:39.090]  You've got one that can see.
[02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:40.071]  Yes, exactly.
[02:11:40.071 --> 02:11:43.917]  Well, he was saying to her, you know, no, no, this is good, this is actually helping people, blah, blah, blah.
[02:11:43.917 --> 02:11:48.744]  But we kept saying, look at all these terrorists being facetious because, you know, we weren't going to stand for it.
[02:11:48.744 --> 02:11:50.026]  I was thinking about leaving.
[02:11:50.026 --> 02:11:52.269]  So he goes up and actually tells his cop buddies.
[02:11:53.010 --> 02:11:55.493]  Oh, those guys are causing trouble over there.
[02:11:55.493 --> 02:12:07.708]  So by the time we get up there, not only did they just search us with the whole make you take your shoes off or anything like that, which they didn't make me take my shoes off because I acted like a subservient little peon, but they double searched us.
[02:12:07.708 --> 02:12:11.153]  I mean, he was literally taking the flashlight and looking down my boxers.
[02:12:11.823 --> 02:12:18.489]  Meanwhile, people are coming in from Ebola-hit countries and getting absolutely no questions whatsoever, receiving no treatment.
[02:12:18.489 --> 02:12:26.016]  We had the doctor earlier, we had the CNN news crew a week before that, but God forbid, Anthony, you should try to go to a music concert and have fun.
[02:12:26.016 --> 02:12:27.037]  Then they'll be really on you.
[02:12:27.037 --> 02:12:27.237]  I mean...
[02:12:27.978 --> 02:12:28.499]  Ridiculous.
[02:12:28.499 --> 02:12:29.880]  Well that's the whole point.
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:34.403]  And it's... I've actually wrote an article about it with some pictures you can see on Infowars.com.
[02:12:34.403 --> 02:12:37.005]  It just went up about four minutes ago.
[02:12:37.005 --> 02:12:44.711]  The key thing here is not only is this a crazy enactment of the police state, a crazy show of power, worthless, they're not catching terrorists.
[02:12:44.711 --> 02:12:45.092]  I'll give them
[02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:50.194]  Zorba didn't have an amount of money if they caught a terrorist with ISIS that night.
[02:12:50.194 --> 02:12:51.595]  Now, here's the thing.
[02:12:51.595 --> 02:12:58.543]  They are not even screening the Ebola patients, the Ebola victims that we know are coming from West Africa or wherever.
[02:12:58.543 --> 02:13:03.028]  They're not even screening them with the degree of scrutiny that they screened me to go into a concert.
[02:13:03.769 --> 02:13:04.129]  Exactly.
[02:13:04.129 --> 02:13:19.816]  The people with Ebola, that hypothetically they're saying, you know, it's so bad, and I'd like to, we talked about two weeks ago about it, our predictions, I think we have a clear view now, we get into that too, where the endgame's going, take callers to get their opinion, but overall I think we finally understand where it's all going.
[02:13:19.816 --> 02:13:22.658]  But they're not even screening people with Ebola like this.
[02:13:22.658 --> 02:13:27.860]  But they're gonna make me take my shirt up and look down my boxes with a flashlight to go listen to some music.
[02:13:28.973 --> 02:13:32.235]  Yet they can come in and pose a threat, as they claim, potentially to millions.
[02:13:32.235 --> 02:13:38.860]  Millions could die from Ebola patients, since the nurses apparently in full hazmat gear can still get Ebola.
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:40.261]  But that's not a big issue.
[02:13:40.261 --> 02:13:40.581]  No, no.
[02:13:40.581 --> 02:13:43.063]  It's not a big issue because they just leave the borders open.
[02:13:43.063 --> 02:13:46.665]  Joe Biggs can go dress up as ISIS and cross the border.
[02:13:46.665 --> 02:13:48.526]  O'Keefe can dress up as Osama bin Laden.
[02:13:48.526 --> 02:13:49.447]  That's not an issue.
[02:13:49.447 --> 02:13:58.053]  The real issue is people going to concerts or going to sporting events and trying to bring in a can of high fructose corn syrup soda to the movie theater, which will get you arrested.
[02:13:58.601 --> 02:14:03.045]  And another side issue on that, what does it say about people who take these jobs?
[02:14:03.045 --> 02:14:08.750]  I mean, that is basically the slag heap of humanity that they're forced to take those kind of jobs.
[02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:10.952]  Are they not even good enough for TSA at this point?
[02:14:10.952 --> 02:14:11.832]  No, it is the slag heap.
[02:14:11.832 --> 02:14:13.654]  It's the runoff of everything.
[02:14:13.654 --> 02:14:14.595]  It's the bureaucracy.
[02:14:14.595 --> 02:14:15.916]  Because here's how it works.
[02:14:15.916 --> 02:14:19.159]  I've flown multiple times recently, actually.
[02:14:19.159 --> 02:14:19.899]  I have to fly all the time now.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:27.482]  And sometimes I'll have a TSA agent, a professional, they will actually be like, hey, you know, I know you want to opt out.
[02:14:27.482 --> 02:14:28.402]  It's not a big deal.
[02:14:28.402 --> 02:14:29.102]  It's smart.
[02:14:29.102 --> 02:14:30.163]  Yeah, no, they'll actually get in.
[02:14:30.163 --> 02:14:31.423]  They'll be like, sorry, we have to do this.
[02:14:31.423 --> 02:14:34.744]  But other times I've had people say, why are you opting out?
[02:14:34.744 --> 02:14:39.345]  And I say, well, I don't want to go through the naked body scanners that save your image and actually emit you with radiation.
[02:14:39.345 --> 02:14:40.045]  Oh, yeah, OK.
[02:14:40.045 --> 02:14:40.906]  Ha ha ha.
[02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:44.307]  And they actually look like they'll they are supposed to call it.
[02:14:44.307 --> 02:14:45.527]  They're supposed to say opt out.
[02:14:45.527 --> 02:14:49.268]  And you go through the line and, you know, someone comes and has you down like a good slave.
[02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:52.330]  But what they'll do is they'll wait like 30 minutes.
[02:14:52.330 --> 02:14:53.351]  They make an exemplar.
[02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:53.771]  Oh yeah.
[02:14:53.771 --> 02:14:57.354]  And then they'll do the pat down if they're the same gender and they'll just pat you down.
[02:14:57.354 --> 02:14:58.956]  They'll be like, do you have any sensitive areas?
[02:14:58.956 --> 02:15:00.457]  They're just like pushing you really hard.
[02:15:00.457 --> 02:15:01.518]  They just love it.
[02:15:01.518 --> 02:15:02.498]  So there's two types of people.
[02:15:02.498 --> 02:15:11.206]  There is the horrible, bureaucratic, evil, slag heap, bad, horrible people that are actually running some of this because they're mentally insane and statistically
[02:15:12.386 --> 02:15:16.629]  Psychopaths and sociopaths rise up way quicker because they can fake emotion.
[02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:17.890]  There's been studies about it.
[02:15:17.890 --> 02:15:19.591]  One of the first ones came out about two months ago.
[02:15:19.591 --> 02:15:24.655]  They can fake emotion, which, interestingly, people are attached to.
[02:15:24.655 --> 02:15:26.556]  Now, those types of people are horrible.
[02:15:26.556 --> 02:15:33.701]  But at the same time, there are people working at those venues that just want a job, that want to make $30,000 a year, that live in the country and don't know what they're doing.
[02:15:34.461 --> 02:15:37.585]  But either way, they're still servicing the same purpose.
[02:15:37.585 --> 02:15:46.455]  They're still doing the same task, which is depleting us of every single piece of freedom that we still have, while you can just run across the border.
[02:15:46.455 --> 02:15:47.677]  So that's the irony of it.
[02:15:47.677 --> 02:15:49.999]  That's why most people are getting it, though, and we are winning.
[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:54.205]  Because most people are saying this is ridiculous.
[02:15:54.205 --> 02:15:56.168]  A two-year-old could see this.
[02:15:56.168 --> 02:16:04.279]  A three-year-old could literally do a report on this and be 100% more intellectually capable than the CDC on all of this.
[02:16:05.615 --> 02:16:09.037]  And the story is up on Infowars.com, photos, concert venues.
[02:16:09.037 --> 02:16:16.181]  Now search, inside your pants, TSA-style concert security agents use flashlights in invasive search.
[02:16:16.181 --> 02:16:18.462]  That took place just this past weekend.
[02:16:18.462 --> 02:16:20.343]  I'm gonna go to some of your calls now.
[02:16:20.343 --> 02:16:21.744]  Tim in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:16:21.744 --> 02:16:24.045]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:16:24.045 --> 02:16:25.726]  Yes, good afternoon to both of you.
[02:16:25.726 --> 02:16:28.807]  Paul, I'm sorry I missed Mr. Madsen.
[02:16:28.807 --> 02:16:33.290]  I wanted to agree with him at the outset of your conversation.
[02:16:33.917 --> 02:16:39.460]  He was talking about this comprehensive plan to break down all the nations, the Arab nations in the Middle East.
[02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:42.922]  But it goes way beyond that.
[02:16:42.922 --> 02:16:48.386]  It was spelled out, none other than by a man named Ed Hussein.
[02:16:48.386 --> 02:16:50.347]  You may remember this fella.
[02:16:50.347 --> 02:16:57.971]  He wrote on the Council on Foreign Relations website in 2012, he wrote that the Syrian FSA needs Al-Qaeda now.
[02:16:57.971 --> 02:17:02.394]  This is the same man who wrote just this last June, a CFR article,
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:08.441]  Entitled, The EU Offers a Model for Unifying the Middle East.
[02:17:08.441 --> 02:17:10.321]  And Paul, I don't think you guys covered this.
[02:17:10.321 --> 02:17:15.422]  I hope you guys can go back and look at this, because this is, I think, one of the main keys.
[02:17:15.422 --> 02:17:21.404]  Not only do they want to break down those nations, but they want to set up a Middle East Union.
[02:17:21.404 --> 02:17:26.144]  And this is spelled out in many, many references.
[02:17:26.144 --> 02:17:28.845]  He had gone, Mr. Anthony had gone to Tehran.
[02:17:29.850 --> 02:17:30.451]  I understand.
[02:17:30.451 --> 02:17:34.994]  And I'm sure he could verify that... Yeah, that's interesting.
[02:17:34.994 --> 02:17:39.418]  I mean, we know there's a policy in Syria to balkanize the country, basically.
[02:17:39.418 --> 02:17:45.643]  That's part of the plan with ISIS to split into three different regions that would be more easily controlled under the U.S.
[02:17:45.643 --> 02:17:46.844]  military-industrial complex.
[02:17:46.844 --> 02:17:49.747]  So that's definitely one of the agendas behind that.
[02:17:49.747 --> 02:17:51.368]  Let's go to Dale in Oregon.
[02:17:51.368 --> 02:17:52.909]  He's a retired HAZMAT professional.
[02:17:52.909 --> 02:17:54.871]  Go ahead, Dale.
[02:17:54.871 --> 02:17:55.932]  Hi, how's it going?
[02:17:55.932 --> 02:17:56.192]  Good.
[02:17:56.192 --> 02:17:56.853]  What's your point today?
[02:17:58.430 --> 02:18:19.200]  Uh, just my point is, um, some of the procedural things I see on the news that maybe the healthcare providers are doing that they might... If I was them, I would be consulting, like, a hazardous materials team or something like that to maybe go over their procedures because some of the things... Like, when you saw the... What do you think about the way they handled the apartment?
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:20.801]  I mean, that was ridiculous, surely, wasn't it?
[02:18:22.108 --> 02:18:23.749]  Well, because it was so late.
[02:18:23.749 --> 02:18:25.930]  I mean, that was a little rugged.
[02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:29.691]  I would say that's a pretty big foo-paw on Steve, you know.
[02:18:29.691 --> 02:18:34.293]  Is the CDC just extremely incompetent?
[02:18:34.293 --> 02:18:37.455]  Yeah, they kind of dropped the ball on that one, that's for sure.
[02:18:37.455 --> 02:18:38.375]  I don't understand
[02:18:39.406 --> 02:18:49.153]  If it was government rhetoric that couldn't, you know, procedural rhetoric that couldn't get them out there, or... Well, what specifically are you finding with the CDC dropping the ball over and over again?
[02:18:49.153 --> 02:18:53.876]  What are they doing that you, as a retired HAZMAT professional, are seeing them do?
[02:18:53.876 --> 02:18:54.737]  Well, I don't know.
[02:18:54.737 --> 02:18:57.498]  Like I said, I think they should utilize their assets more.
[02:18:57.498 --> 02:19:02.462]  I mean, Houston HAZMAT is probably one of the premier HAZMAT teams in the country.
[02:19:03.439 --> 02:19:07.763]  And I would be bringing those people in and reviewing their procedures.
[02:19:07.763 --> 02:19:22.034]  And like I was going to say, the people that went into the apartment to clean it up went into the building or the room in a higher level of protection than what was called for.
[02:19:22.034 --> 02:19:24.676]  And that's a fire department procedure, hazmat procedure.
[02:19:24.676 --> 02:19:28.099]  We always try to go over one level of protection.
[02:19:28.099 --> 02:19:30.781]  They were in level C protection.
[02:19:31.417 --> 02:19:38.279]  Which is kind of splash protection, and you'll see the health care workers in a Class C protection.
[02:19:38.279 --> 02:19:50.963]  The fire department, the people that went and cleaned the room went into a Level B, and then there's another Level A that is totally encapsulated, totally on respirators, on air, nothing's getting in.
[02:19:50.963 --> 02:19:52.164]  Okay, we'll leave it there now.
[02:19:52.164 --> 02:19:53.024]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:53.024 --> 02:19:55.285]  Coming up after the break, more of your calls.

[02:20:32.818 --> 02:20:36.239]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:36.239 --> 02:20:37.920]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:39.881]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:39.881 --> 02:20:45.723]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:45.723 --> 02:20:46.543]  I know, right?

[02:23:51.403 --> 02:23:51.943]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:01.784 --> 02:24:02.985]  I think so.
[02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:25.488]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, talking about Ebola.
[02:24:25.488 --> 02:24:28.170]  Going to your calls, Kathy in California.
[02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:29.331]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:24:29.331 --> 02:24:33.174]  We're talking about Ebola, and specifically, what is the endgame?
[02:24:33.174 --> 02:24:36.476]  Is this going to break out into a martial law-style situation?
[02:24:36.476 --> 02:24:38.257]  Kathy, go ahead.
[02:24:38.257 --> 02:24:39.418]  Okay, uh, hey.
[02:24:39.418 --> 02:24:42.140]  I don't remember your name, but thank you for taking my call.
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:44.601]  And I'm calling to bring up a couple of points.
[02:24:44.601 --> 02:24:51.526]  As far as I know, when Bush was in office, he, uh, with everything with Iraq, he suspended the Constitution.
[02:24:52.439 --> 02:24:54.340]  No, I'm not sure what that means.
[02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:56.061]  I know what the word suspension means.
[02:24:56.061 --> 02:25:00.423]  And as far as I know, I don't know how to reinstate it.
[02:25:00.423 --> 02:25:02.063]  I don't know what procedure it takes.
[02:25:02.063 --> 02:25:04.224]  And I don't know if anybody in Washington, D.C.
[02:25:04.224 --> 02:25:07.066]  or any position there reinstated the Constitution.
[02:25:07.066 --> 02:25:11.428]  Because people I'm hearing on the radio keep saying that we have to defend the Constitution.
[02:25:11.428 --> 02:25:17.550]  But if it's been suspended, then it's no longer the same thing necessary to do.
[02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:18.551]  Do you understand my point?
[02:25:19.264 --> 02:25:24.086]  Yeah, well I mean it's been watered down to such an extent now that, you know, de facto has been suspended.
[02:25:24.086 --> 02:25:27.008]  There's talk of a constitutional convention coming up.
[02:25:27.008 --> 02:25:31.570]  We've already got 34 states that have ratified that, which is the minimum required.
[02:25:31.570 --> 02:25:36.533]  Obviously there's concern that other things could be inserted into that convention, gun control, etc.
[02:25:36.533 --> 02:25:38.914]  But definitely that could be a solution.
[02:25:38.914 --> 02:25:44.017]  I know Alex has kind of moved more on board with that in recent years, so that's interesting.
[02:25:44.017 --> 02:25:47.539]  Jay in Colorado, you're on the air, you want to talk about Ebola treatments.
[02:25:47.539 --> 02:25:48.119]  Go ahead, Jay.
[02:25:49.552 --> 02:25:50.513]  Hey, Paul.
[02:25:50.513 --> 02:25:51.253]  Hey, Anthony.
[02:25:51.253 --> 02:25:58.377]  I wanted to talk about, well, two main things I hadn't really heard talked about that much as far as supplements.
[02:25:58.377 --> 02:26:00.198]  The first one is selenium.
[02:26:00.198 --> 02:26:15.447]  It seems as though the Ebola virus, at least, maybe not this new strain, but Ebola in general seems to, like, really gorge itself on selenium deposits in people's cells, and then it spreads when it doesn't get that.
[02:26:15.447 --> 02:26:18.028]  And, I don't know, I'm expecting that if this does spread,
[02:26:28.065 --> 02:26:42.512]  I did an article about some of the research out there and when I actually did the research on the research and it was very disappointing to me because what I found was as early as 2009 they were doing some serious trials on things like genistein
[02:26:43.394 --> 02:26:46.757]  And other soy-based compounds.
[02:26:46.757 --> 02:27:00.607]  And they were looking into it and they said, well actually it does look like in animal studies there's an inhibition of the Ebola virus to some degree, also in combination with various drugs which can be used with natural substances to reduce side effects or reduce actual dosage.
[02:27:00.607 --> 02:27:06.812]  And they're saying, no, it looks really promising, it looks powerful, yet the funding completely stopped.
[02:27:07.498 --> 02:27:13.281]  So, as for selenium, as for all the other possibilities, as for the other natural compounds, it's all out there.
[02:27:13.281 --> 02:27:14.521]  The research is out there.
[02:27:14.521 --> 02:27:15.802]  It is real.
[02:27:15.802 --> 02:27:21.825]  They're just not funding it because they're just sitting around waiting for Bill Gates and Melinda Gates to offer the latest vaccine.
[02:27:21.825 --> 02:27:23.926]  They're not telling you about preparedness.
[02:27:23.926 --> 02:27:30.049]  So, you know, Jay, I want to ask you first, before we get into the next thing on this, what are you doing to prepare yourself?
[02:27:30.049 --> 02:27:35.611]  Right now I have a, I mean, right now I have, you know, a little bit of coital silver on hand.
[02:27:35.611 --> 02:27:37.172]  I have a little bit of selenium on hand.
[02:27:37.905 --> 02:28:05.556]  I noticed that the silver bullet is sold out right now, but what I'd like to do is actually, I've been looking into the Bob Beck protocol, and although getting the equipment for the whole setup is going to be kind of an expensive ordeal for me, I'm looking into blood electrification because as I understand it, that process can actually, it interacts somehow with the virus in such a way that it can't produce enzymes necessary to invade host cells.
[02:28:06.155 --> 02:28:12.363]  Well, you know, overall, there is natural research out there that there are ways to potentially, you know, inhibit this.
[02:28:12.363 --> 02:28:21.115]  But, obviously, you know, the key thing here is maybe we shouldn't let people from Liberia who are coughing get on a plane and come to the United States.
[02:28:21.195 --> 02:28:22.376]  That would be a start.
[02:28:22.376 --> 02:28:30.543]  It's a sad day for me, even into natural health, which I've been into for a very long time and doing the research and looking at it, to have to even talk about how to prepare ourselves.
[02:28:30.543 --> 02:28:31.824]  But that's where we are now.
[02:28:31.824 --> 02:28:32.405]  That's where we are.
[02:28:32.405 --> 02:28:34.507]  They're just letting people in with Ebola.
[02:28:34.507 --> 02:28:39.031]  And it should come as no surprise that we're going to have an Ebola outbreak in the United States.
[02:28:39.031 --> 02:28:41.153]  It should come as no surprise to anyone.
[02:28:41.153 --> 02:28:43.175]  It should come as no surprise that you need to prepare yourself.
[02:28:43.775 --> 02:28:46.557]  I mean, it should come as no surprise, me living in reality.
[02:28:46.557 --> 02:28:47.618]  I live in reality.
[02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:53.864]  I don't sit here all day and, you know, and think about every theory about how the world's gonna end.
[02:28:53.864 --> 02:28:54.805]  None of us do.
[02:28:54.805 --> 02:29:00.770]  We try to live our lives, warn people, alter the course of humanity, and for the better.
[02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:02.751]  But we also have preparedness aspects.
[02:29:02.751 --> 02:29:06.575]  You know, storable food is something that I'm always going to have some of.
[02:29:06.575 --> 02:29:07.556]  Or iodine.
[02:29:07.556 --> 02:29:10.979]  Every single time we get a new supply, X2, which we're running out of right now,
[02:29:11.658 --> 02:29:20.187]  Every single time, I grab a box for myself, and ultimately it ends up getting stolen by friends and family who need it themselves, so I have to replenish it constantly.
[02:29:20.187 --> 02:29:23.610]  But I know what I need, and I know the preparedness aspects of it.
[02:29:23.610 --> 02:29:24.171]  Selenium?
[02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:25.172]  Look into it.
[02:29:25.172 --> 02:29:30.397]  I know that I have my storable food, I have my iodine, I have my colloidal silver, and that's for my preparedness pack.
[02:29:30.397 --> 02:29:34.822]  Look into it, do your own research, but overall you need to defend yourself because the government's not going to do it for you.
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:37.682]  More of your calls coming up after the break.
[02:29:37.682 --> 02:29:43.507]  We're going to have David Knight in studio to cover more issues touching on things aside from Ebola.
[02:29:43.507 --> 02:29:45.309]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:46.811]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:46.811 --> 02:29:50.914]  Keep it locked in.
[02:29:50.914 --> 02:29:52.316]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.316 --> 02:29:53.917]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.917 --> 02:29:57.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.778 --> 02:30:05.921]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[02:30:05.921 --> 02:30:10.465]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:30:10.465 --> 02:30:16.990]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:20.973]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:30:20.973 --> 02:30:22.655]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:22.655 --> 02:30:26.618]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[02:30:26.778 --> 02:30:35.464]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:30:35.464 --> 02:30:43.570]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:30:43.570 --> 02:30:47.233]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:30:47.233 --> 02:30:53.037]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at
[02:30:53.177 --> 02:30:56.562]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:02.048 --> 02:31:05.709]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:05.709 --> 02:31:09.991]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:09.991 --> 02:31:11.771]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:11.771 --> 02:31:19.634]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:19.634 --> 02:31:20.754]  But for how long?
[02:31:20.754 --> 02:31:27.396]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:27.396 --> 02:31:30.217]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:31:31.553 --> 02:31:35.055]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:35.055 --> 02:31:43.320]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:48.724]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:48.724 --> 02:31:51.245]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:31:51.245 --> 02:31:53.367]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:32:01.764 --> 02:32:07.926]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:32:07.926 --> 02:32:12.488]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:32:12.488 --> 02:32:17.050]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:32:17.470 --> 02:32:20.391]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:32:20.391 --> 02:32:25.832]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:32:25.832 --> 02:32:33.213]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:32:33.213 --> 02:32:37.354]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:32:37.354 --> 02:32:42.135]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:42.455 --> 02:32:50.921]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:32:50.921 --> 02:32:55.345]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:55.345 --> 02:33:00.529]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:33:11.286 --> 02:33:17.942]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:17.942 --> 02:33:19.565]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:26.806 --> 02:33:28.907]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.907 --> 02:33:30.187]  I'm filling in for Alex today.
[02:33:30.187 --> 02:33:34.188]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, joined in studio by David Knight.
[02:33:34.188 --> 02:33:36.769]  First I want to cover just a couple of stories here.
[02:33:36.769 --> 02:33:38.469]  One out of zero hedge.
[02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:42.210]  Will the Fed let the stock market crash before an election?
[02:33:42.210 --> 02:33:43.431]  This is Charles Hugh Smith.
[02:33:44.051 --> 02:33:52.276]  Anyone in their position with the tools at hand would not have any other real option other than to buy stocks in whatever quantity is needed to reverse the selling and blow the shorts out of the water.
[02:33:52.276 --> 02:34:01.001]  So there's speculation that the Fed could be preparing to intervene in the stock market before the election, either to cause a crash or to prevent one.
[02:34:01.001 --> 02:34:04.904]  We've had a lot of negative stock news over the past recent weeks.
[02:34:05.484 --> 02:34:11.610]  What would happen to incumbents in the election a few weeks from now if the stock market crashes?
[02:34:11.610 --> 02:34:19.378]  The happy story that all is well and you would be wise to re-elect the incumbents responsible for the economic good news would be reduced to rubble.
[02:34:19.378 --> 02:34:27.445]  So they're speculating that this could be part of the October surprise that many people have talked about, an economic panic right before the election.
[02:34:28.346 --> 02:34:31.589]  Which could really shake up the midterms there.
[02:34:31.589 --> 02:34:37.874]  So that's an interesting article out of Zero Hedge, a potential October surprise in the economy.
[02:34:37.874 --> 02:34:42.278]  Also from Zero Hedge today, China claims US behind Hong Kong protests.
[02:34:42.278 --> 02:34:49.083]  A commentary in the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party on Saturday accused the US of trying to foment a colour revolution in Hong Kong.
[02:34:49.964 --> 02:34:55.191]  So we've already had claims that foreigners are behind these protests in Hong Kong.
[02:34:55.191 --> 02:35:03.822]  We've had evidence that the National Endowment for Democracy, as it was involved in Ukraine and many other colour revolutions, is active again in Hong Kong.
[02:35:03.822 --> 02:35:04.963]  But now, for the first time,
[02:35:05.524 --> 02:35:25.544]  Chinese state media has directly blamed the United States for fomenting that uprising as a color revolution to destabilize Beijing, just as they attempted to do, of course, and succeeded in Kiev, overthrowing the legitimately elected government and replacing it with an EU vassal puppet state.
[02:35:25.544 --> 02:35:28.767]  So we're continuing to watch developments in Hong Kong.
[02:35:29.267 --> 02:35:38.397]  David Knight, your comments on that, and also the news story out of the Washington Post, probe of contract for illegal silences leads to web of Pentagon secrets.
[02:35:38.397 --> 02:35:41.540]  Yeah, you know, you're talking about manipulating the stock market to make incumbents look good.
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:51.110]  It's kind of interesting to me, living in this country, that it seems like every four years, if there's an incumbent president who's running for re-election, we can usually see a drop in gas prices.
[02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:58.674]  Right now I think there's a lot of incumbents, especially in the Democrat Party, that are very concerned about their getting re-elected.
[02:35:58.674 --> 02:36:06.518]  I think it's interesting we're seeing yet again another drop in gas prices, even though you've got a lot of unrest in the Middle East, which you would think would perhaps drive that up.
[02:36:06.518 --> 02:36:07.919]  Maybe that's just a coincidence, but...
[02:36:09.434 --> 02:36:24.177]  This story that is up on drudge right now in the Washington Post, it's a real interesting little bit of intrigue that kind of surfaced from one particular case and it is mushrooming to shed some light on this secretive organization within the Pentagon.
[02:36:24.817 --> 02:36:34.683]  They're saying that a criminal investigation has exposed a secret weapons program intertwined with allegations of a sweetheart contract, fake badges, and trails of destroyed evidence.
[02:36:34.683 --> 02:36:47.691]  Now what this is, is a group of about 10 civilian employees, most of them retired military personnel, and something that is known as the Directorate for Plans, Policy, Oversight, and Integration.
[02:36:47.691 --> 02:36:48.191]  A directorate.
[02:36:48.671 --> 02:36:51.754]  This kind of sounds like something out of a communist country, doesn't it?
[02:36:51.754 --> 02:36:55.096]  But what they did was they ordered 349 silencers.
[02:36:55.096 --> 02:37:02.122]  And they paid a hot rod auto mechanic in California 1.6 million dollars to make these silencers.
[02:37:02.122 --> 02:37:04.143]  Now his cost in parts is only about $10,000.
[02:37:04.143 --> 02:37:06.785]  So that's a pretty good profit margin.
[02:37:07.606 --> 02:37:16.574]  The crux of it, they say, is whether or not these silencers were properly purchased for an authorized secret mission or were they part of a rogue operation.
[02:37:16.574 --> 02:37:19.397]  And they've got a former senior Navy official speaking out on it.
[02:37:19.397 --> 02:37:25.922]  He says, I know it sounds goofy, but it was like they were building their own mini law enforcement and intelligence agency.
[02:37:25.922 --> 02:37:27.464]  We've seen that before, haven't we?
[02:37:27.464 --> 02:37:30.767]  I mean, everything in this government, when everything is secret,
[02:37:31.684 --> 02:37:33.024]  No, the government does.
[02:37:33.024 --> 02:37:40.327]  And it's not just black ops, but I mean, it doesn't matter who you try to talk to, from our perspective in government, pretty much everybody throws up a shield.
[02:37:40.327 --> 02:37:42.748]  There's no transparency, no candor anywhere.
[02:37:42.748 --> 02:37:49.130]  When everything the government does is secret, and everything that you do is an open book to them, that is a recipe for disaster.
[02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:50.571]  It's a recipe, really, for tyranny.
[02:37:51.371 --> 02:37:59.216]  They started destroying evidence, and one of the things that they came across was a stash of AK-47s, 1,600 of them.
[02:37:59.216 --> 02:38:02.198]  Now, of course, AK-47s are Russian weapons.
[02:38:02.198 --> 02:38:03.299]  They're not used by the U.S.
[02:38:03.299 --> 02:38:04.280]  military.
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:12.665]  And as the Washington Post points out, if the foreign-made weapons were equipped with unmarked silencers, the weapons could have been used by U.S.
[02:38:12.665 --> 02:38:19.270]  or foreign forces or special ops in other countries without any risk that they would be traced back to the United States.
[02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:20.891]  In other words, for false flag.
[02:38:21.544 --> 02:38:25.347]  For a false flag or to arm the Syrian rebels or even other entities.
[02:38:25.347 --> 02:38:28.270]  Of course we know out of Benghazi weapons flowed.
[02:38:28.270 --> 02:38:29.591]  That was hidden for a long time.
[02:38:29.591 --> 02:38:35.536]  It was later confirmed that weapons were being sent out of Benghazi to so-called moderate rebels in Syria.
[02:38:35.536 --> 02:38:42.723]  So they have to hide these programs behind this veil of secrecy and obviously this could be another example of that.
[02:38:42.723 --> 02:38:46.025]  And it was just last August that we had this report on Infowars.com.
[02:38:46.025 --> 02:38:46.806]  It's August 16th.
[02:38:48.347 --> 02:38:50.769]  Again, they were percolating the situation in Syria.
[02:38:50.769 --> 02:38:51.189]  The U.S.
[02:38:51.189 --> 02:38:57.273]  Army bought 600,000 AK-47 magazines fully loaded.
[02:38:57.273 --> 02:38:57.673]  The U.S.
[02:38:57.673 --> 02:39:00.915]  Army doesn't have any AK-47s officially.
[02:39:00.915 --> 02:39:03.157]  Okay, so who are they giving it to?
[02:39:03.157 --> 02:39:05.638]  What rebel groups are they secretly arming with that?
[02:39:05.638 --> 02:39:12.523]  And of course we know that there's been a lot of arming and training of rebel groups within Syria because that's the next state on their list.
[02:39:12.523 --> 02:39:15.245]  That's what all this ISIS stuff is about, is an excuse to
[02:39:15.925 --> 02:39:26.532]  Get into the country one way or the other and start a war, then they can go after the Syrian government itself in the pretense of fighting the rebels that they actually created and armed and trained.
[02:39:26.532 --> 02:39:28.474]  Let's go to a call now, Martin in Tennessee.
[02:39:28.474 --> 02:39:28.994]  You're on the air.
[02:39:28.994 --> 02:39:33.157]  Go ahead, Martin.
[02:39:33.157 --> 02:39:33.517]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:33.517 --> 02:39:44.925]  I just wanted to let you know that my opinion is that the CDC is nothing more than a supposed hybridized pseudo-government
[02:39:47.163 --> 02:39:49.605]  We should not expect anything from them.
[02:39:49.605 --> 02:39:51.887]  They are much like the Federal Reserve.
[02:39:51.887 --> 02:39:53.608]  They are part of the agenda.
[02:39:53.608 --> 02:39:56.371]  We should protect ourselves.
[02:39:56.371 --> 02:39:57.171]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:39:57.171 --> 02:40:02.376]  We're going to go to Steve in Arizona who says he's a fire department worker regarding Ebola training.
[02:40:02.376 --> 02:40:05.978]  Steve, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:40:05.978 --> 02:40:09.281]  Do we have Steve?
[02:40:09.281 --> 02:40:10.302]  Steve's not there.
[02:40:10.302 --> 02:40:11.443]  Maybe we can get back to Steve.
[02:40:11.443 --> 02:40:12.764]  We'll go to Kurt in Oregon.
[02:40:12.764 --> 02:40:13.725]  Kurt, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:40:14.915 --> 02:40:17.076]  Hi Jonan, this is Kurt.
[02:40:17.076 --> 02:40:23.358]  I have a statement and a question about encryption.
[02:40:23.358 --> 02:40:40.963]  I'm a 25 year IT professional and my thought is that whether it's Bitcoin or email or voting machines, there is no trustworthy code open source and not just transparent and not just the algorithms transparent.
[02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:53.480]  But a plan to systematically review that, because what we found with the OpenSSL virus was that it is open source and nobody ever actually peer-reviewed it.
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:59.906]  And my question is really, where do we go from here?
[02:40:59.906 --> 02:41:09.594]  I have a lot of powerful, progressive friends, and they're all in their own world and could care less about the things that we talk about here on InfoWars.
[02:41:10.678 --> 02:41:16.086]  And I believe the only war is the Infowar, and we lose anything if we lose the Constitution.
[02:41:16.086 --> 02:41:16.887]  We lose everything.
[02:41:16.887 --> 02:41:19.130]  I don't think we win the aftermath of this.
[02:41:19.130 --> 02:41:24.957]  Well, I mean, we saw earlier we covered the story about MSNBC, which of course is a liberal stronghold.
[02:41:24.957 --> 02:41:26.680]  Record low viewing ratings.
[02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:43.003]  You know, we get, what, three million listeners a day just on the radio show alone, so they are waking up, they are coming over to our side and it's part of that process of losing faith in the mainstream media, which we've seen definitely over the past ten years, so we have to judge it by that benchmark.
[02:41:43.985 --> 02:41:58.487]  David Knight, the point about encryption, I mean we had William Binney on recently, he said that people who use encryption, which I do for my email, they're the ones who get targeted, but still it is a good protection, a good at least surface level of protection against invasive spying.
[02:41:59.128 --> 02:41:59.809]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:41:59.809 --> 02:42:06.757]  I mean, one of the things, PGP was one of the first encryption programs that came out for emails by Phil Zimmerman, like, 20 years ago.
[02:42:06.757 --> 02:42:14.085]  And the big problem was, if you're the only one doing the encryption, then you get the special attention, and they've got all the time in the world to decrypt it.
[02:42:14.665 --> 02:42:19.607]  You know, you can decrypt some of the people some of the time, but you can't decrypt everybody all the time.
[02:42:19.607 --> 02:42:23.168]  But in terms of apathy, I think that's the greater issue.
[02:42:23.168 --> 02:42:24.769]  I think the apathy is a greater issue.
[02:42:24.769 --> 02:42:34.413]  And on this article that was linked on the Drudge Report today from TechCrunch, where they're talking about the interview with Ed Snowden, where he said, get rid of Dropbox, avoid Facebook, avoid Google.
[02:42:34.413 --> 02:42:42.176]  What I thought was the most interesting thing out of that article was the caption here where he says, he talks about why you should be concerned about privacy.
[02:42:42.216 --> 02:42:47.604]  And this is what you need to tell your friends if they're conservative or liberal and they just don't understand why this matters.
[02:42:47.604 --> 02:42:53.172]  He said, when you say, I have nothing to hide, you're saying, I don't care about this right.
[02:42:53.172 --> 02:42:58.078]  You're saying, I don't have this right because I got to the point where I have to justify it.
[02:42:58.659 --> 02:43:02.941]  The way rights work is the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights.
[02:43:02.941 --> 02:43:05.343]  And so that's one of the things that you really need to understand.
[02:43:05.343 --> 02:43:12.686]  And then the other thing that he said in the article is he says, we don't need to know every technical detail of what's going on in every program of the intelligence community.
[02:43:12.686 --> 02:43:22.351]  But we do need to know the bare and broad outlines of the powers our government is claiming they have and how they affect us and how they affect our relationships overseas.
[02:43:22.351 --> 02:43:23.152]  Because if we don't,
[02:43:23.852 --> 02:43:26.274]  We're no longer citizens.
[02:43:26.274 --> 02:43:28.195]  We no longer have leaders.
[02:43:28.195 --> 02:43:30.257]  We are subjects and we have rulers.
[02:43:30.257 --> 02:43:32.819]  I would say we are slaves at that point.
[02:43:32.819 --> 02:43:35.781]  I'd put a much stronger point on it, but very eloquent.
[02:43:35.781 --> 02:43:37.703]  That's from Ed Snowden.
[02:43:37.703 --> 02:43:42.746]  If you want to know why it matters, I think those are a couple of very good quotes to talk to your friends about.
[02:43:42.746 --> 02:43:45.288]  It does matter to have a right to privacy.
[02:43:45.288 --> 02:43:50.052]  However, I am very skeptical that there's anything out there that technologically protects us.
[02:43:50.052 --> 02:43:51.213]  I think we need to stand together.
[02:43:51.733 --> 02:43:51.993]  I don't
[02:44:12.543 --> 02:44:27.550]  People within the federal government who are robbing us of our rights, and when he says, distrust the government, but he doesn't do his job to lock up people who have violated the laws, who are criminals, he's not doing anything to make us have any confidence in this.
[02:44:27.550 --> 02:44:29.171]  He's just part of the problem, in my opinion.
[02:44:29.963 --> 02:44:42.307]  And for people who say, you know, they don't care about their privacy, it's a complete misnomer, because as soon as you say, okay, well, give me your email password, give me access to your bank account, then they suddenly have real concerns about privacy.
[02:44:42.307 --> 02:44:43.887]  It's only with the government.
[02:44:43.887 --> 02:44:50.509]  You can trust the government, apparently, to violate your privacy, but not even your closest friends can be trusted with your email password.
[02:44:50.509 --> 02:44:57.191]  So, again, it's a cop-out, and they need to understand that government has always been the main threat, specifically with surveillance.
[02:44:57.191 --> 02:44:58.872]  Now, even Eric Schmidt is warning that
[02:44:59.332 --> 02:45:05.815]  It's so invasive in terms of the Internet that it could undermine the entire structure of the Internet and break the World Wide Web.
[02:45:05.815 --> 02:45:12.098]  So, you know, I'd like to see the trendies who don't really care about privacy cope without the Internet.
[02:45:12.098 --> 02:45:18.721]  I think they would begin to really care if that was a genuine threat, which many people are now saying it could well be.
[02:45:18.721 --> 02:45:19.761]  Kyle in Illinois.
[02:45:19.761 --> 02:45:20.241]  You're on the air.
[02:45:20.241 --> 02:45:22.482]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[02:45:22.482 --> 02:45:22.822]  Yeah, hi.
[02:45:22.822 --> 02:45:25.263]  This is Carl in Illinois.
[02:45:25.263 --> 02:45:25.664]  Go ahead.
[02:45:25.664 --> 02:45:26.364]  What's your point today?
[02:45:27.310 --> 02:45:39.517]  Okay, regarding this Ebola fiasco that's happening here in our country, someone may have brought this question up before, I'm not sure, but it's on my mind.
[02:45:39.517 --> 02:45:53.304]  If a mosquito bites an Ebola-infected person and then goes on to sting someone else, can mosquitoes and flies carry this disease forward?
[02:45:53.304 --> 02:45:54.045]  That's my question.
[02:45:55.109 --> 02:46:01.057]  This is a major concern because this is mosquito season and most of America does have mosquitoes.
[02:46:02.109 --> 02:46:07.611]  And flies that bite you, they take your blood and they can also deposit germs into a human body.
[02:46:07.611 --> 02:46:11.352]  Well, we don't know, you know, we don't know if it's vector-borne that way.
[02:46:11.352 --> 02:46:13.993]  Of course, there was a lot of fear about that with HIV.
[02:46:13.993 --> 02:46:18.795]  People were concerned that HIV could be transferred by mosquitoes because it was blood-borne.
[02:46:18.795 --> 02:46:20.415]  That turned out to not happen.
[02:46:20.415 --> 02:46:24.256]  They're saying they haven't noticed any situation where this has been transferred.
[02:46:24.256 --> 02:46:25.837]  But, you know, when we look at these cases,
[02:46:26.637 --> 02:46:32.443]  Even with the Western doctors and nurses who go over there, they're telling us, I really don't know how I got it.
[02:46:32.443 --> 02:46:33.825]  And so that's what the concern is.
[02:46:33.825 --> 02:46:35.707]  Did they get it because it was airborne?
[02:46:35.707 --> 02:46:37.849]  Did they get it because of the aerosols?
[02:46:37.849 --> 02:46:45.016]  Did they get it because they touched something that someone else touched and there hadn't been enough time passed for the virus to die on the outside?
[02:46:45.797 --> 02:46:47.838]  Quite frankly, we really don't know.
[02:46:47.838 --> 02:46:56.744]  That's why I believe that we ought to exercise additional care, that those countries that are suffering from the epidemic should be sealed off.
[02:46:56.744 --> 02:47:02.808]  Not that we need to seal our borders as much as we need to seal that in, because they can go to intermediate countries and then come in that way.
[02:47:02.808 --> 02:47:04.830]  There's many ways that they can do it, and believe me,
[02:47:05.470 --> 02:47:14.555]  If it starts to affect 5-15% of the population as the CDC is currently projecting it will in those countries, they will find a way to get out, if there's any way to get out.
[02:47:14.555 --> 02:47:16.657]  They're going to want to get out of that situation.
[02:47:16.657 --> 02:47:17.177]  Anybody would.
[02:47:18.243 --> 02:47:24.647]  And of course there were reports, and I think these were confirmed, that, you know, bats are a real delicacy over there in West Africa.
[02:47:24.647 --> 02:47:30.091]  People were eating these bats, catching Ebola that way, if the bats were not properly cooked.
[02:47:30.091 --> 02:47:32.493]  So that was one way in which it was spreading.
[02:47:32.493 --> 02:47:35.635]  Regarding mosquitoes, I don't think that's been confirmed.
[02:47:35.635 --> 02:47:38.597]  Bob in Connecticut, go ahead, you're on the air, Bob.
[02:47:38.597 --> 02:47:41.879]  Yeah, I want to say, hi Paul, how you doing, and David.
[02:47:41.879 --> 02:47:45.662]  I just wanted to make an observation on our government's response to this Ebola.
[02:47:45.662 --> 02:47:47.243]  It's been totally inadequate.
[02:47:48.327 --> 02:47:51.530]  The CDC is complicit in it.
[02:47:51.530 --> 02:47:57.775]  The Ebola is airborne, and the DoD has known that since 1989.
[02:47:57.775 --> 02:48:02.799]  And I think this is just a war against the people of the United States.
[02:48:02.799 --> 02:48:09.085]  Otherwise, they would have closed down the air travel from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
[02:48:09.085 --> 02:48:10.306]  What do you guys think about that?
[02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:18.936]  Well, there was the 1989 experiment, I believe it was in Virginia, that was the case, wasn't it, where they proved that it was airborne to at least a limited extent.
[02:48:18.936 --> 02:48:24.260]  They said they believed that it was, at least with aerosols, they wound up having to execute those monkeys because they couldn't stop it.
[02:48:25.114 --> 02:48:28.195]  Yeah, and there was also the 2012 study in Canada.
[02:48:28.195 --> 02:48:32.516]  I look at this, Paul, and this article comes out today from Reuters.
[02:48:32.516 --> 02:48:32.876]  The U.S.
[02:48:32.876 --> 02:48:36.997]  needs to rethink Ebola infection control, says the CDC chief.
[02:48:36.997 --> 02:48:39.258]  They need a new strategy, he says.
[02:48:39.258 --> 02:48:41.279]  And I would ask, what strategy?
[02:48:41.279 --> 02:48:43.759]  I haven't seen or heard of any strategy.
[02:48:43.759 --> 02:48:48.841]  When they make mistakes, like the very first press conference that they had with the governor and local health officials,
[02:48:49.401 --> 02:48:56.904]  They didn't have an explanation as to how come this lady was not treated right away, why they had not disinfected the apartment.
[02:48:56.904 --> 02:49:00.225]  So many things that we didn't even know at that time that they hadn't done.
[02:49:00.225 --> 02:49:07.828]  They didn't make any confession about what they had done and say, this is where we screwed up and this is how we're going to keep that from happening again.
[02:49:07.828 --> 02:49:10.249]  There is no strategy to contain this.
[02:49:10.249 --> 02:49:11.910]  They don't have any treatment for it.
[02:49:12.330 --> 02:49:22.280]  The only thing that appears to show some promise that has availability is the convalescent serum and they're not doing anything to create a donor registry or test the blood there.
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:25.383]  They're not going to have any of these experimental vaccines for quite some time.
[02:49:25.383 --> 02:49:27.445]  They don't have a strategy for treatment or containment.
[02:49:32.237 --> 02:49:33.718]  Hi Dave and Paul.
[02:49:33.718 --> 02:49:36.620]  The strategy is if it's not broke, don't fix it.
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:43.104]  And the fact of the matter is that nothing has happened over the past few decades to reach this magnitude.
[02:49:43.104 --> 02:49:51.689]  Nothing has been done to upgrade the protocols and the various mechanisms by which things are handled.
[02:49:51.689 --> 02:49:55.772]  So it's become a situation of not what you know, but who you know.
[02:49:56.232 --> 02:50:19.501]  My real question is, the response to our Governor Bobby Jindal, who is a man's man, a God-fearing man who loves his state, about banning all flights into Louisiana was answered quickly by the government of what I consider to be not the United States, but the cooperating states, has
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:21.621]  Well, it's
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:39.901]  Of course we had the story on Friday about the FEMA coffin liners.
[02:50:39.901 --> 02:50:42.062]  That was an interesting thing out of Georgia.
[02:50:42.062 --> 02:50:44.382]  They were storing them back a few years ago.
[02:50:44.382 --> 02:50:45.963]  We can get into that after the break.
[02:50:45.963 --> 02:50:49.103]  Taking more of your calls on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:50:49.103 --> 02:50:50.484]  David Knight in studio.
[02:50:50.484 --> 02:50:52.484]  We're going to wrap up the news after the break.
[02:50:52.484 --> 02:50:54.405]  Go to a couple more of your calls.
[02:50:54.405 --> 02:50:56.825]  The website is infowars.com.
[02:50:56.825 --> 02:50:57.946]  Final segment coming up.
[02:50:57.946 --> 02:50:58.406]  Stay tuned.
[02:51:01.875 --> 02:51:02.996]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:02.996 --> 02:51:07.480]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:13.204]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:13.204 --> 02:51:16.787]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:16.787 --> 02:51:19.449]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:19.449 --> 02:51:24.413]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:52:12.462 --> 02:52:17.865]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:52:47.470 --> 02:52:49.811]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[02:53:00.498 --> 02:53:02.319]  Adam Miller here with Midas Resources.
[02:53:02.319 --> 02:53:03.979]  Today, October 8, 2014, gold opened at $1218.80.
[02:53:03.979 --> 02:53:06.840]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1263.60, $631.80 for a half ounce, or $315.90 for a quarter ounce.
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:07.360]  That's $1263.60, $631.80, and $315.90.
[02:53:19.249 --> 02:53:20.650]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:20.650 --> 02:53:25.952]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:25.952 --> 02:53:26.833]  Wait a sec.
[02:53:26.833 --> 02:53:31.235]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[02:53:31.235 --> 02:53:32.955]  And there's no end to this madness.
[02:53:32.955 --> 02:53:38.138]  That old 401k and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[02:53:38.718 --> 02:53:41.642]  I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.
[02:53:41.642 --> 02:53:42.983]  Don't let time slip away.
[02:53:42.983 --> 02:53:44.525]  Call for your free copy today.

[02:53:44.745 --> 02:53:46.848]  Get away from that Washington spin and get honest answers about gold.
[02:53:46.848 --> 02:53:46.908]  800-686-2237.

[02:53:47.649 --> 02:53:47.689]  800-686-2237.
[02:54:20.015 --> 02:54:34.671]  Strange days have indeed found us, and with all the madness going on in the world, it's important to protect your immune system, and you can do that with the great line of products at Infowarslife.com, one of which is X2.
[02:54:34.671 --> 02:54:37.194]  This is, uh, key nascent iodine.
[02:54:37.194 --> 02:54:40.497]  Instead of drinking excessive amounts of bad-tasting iodine,
[02:54:41.198 --> 02:54:41.838]  Get X2.
[02:54:41.838 --> 02:54:46.500]  It doesn't have that garbage taste that you will find in a lot of the mainstream brands.
[02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:51.101]  It's time to get prepared with Survival Shield X2 from InfoWarsLife.
[02:54:51.101 --> 02:54:55.063]  Secure yours at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:54:55.063 --> 02:55:03.466]  And also, of course, iodine is very good for general health, for the general immune system, not just for protection against radiation exposure.
[02:55:03.466 --> 02:55:07.127]  I'm going to go to another one of your calls shortly, but I just want to touch on this.
[02:55:07.887 --> 02:55:22.102]  David Knight, there's no talk of blocking the flights out of West Africa due to Ebola, yet in 2011, and you can see this in the Forbes article, TSA threatens to cancel all flights out of Texas if groping bill passed.
[02:55:22.102 --> 02:55:28.388]  They basically threatened an embargo, a blockade on Texas if this bill passed which banned TSA groping.
[02:55:28.388 --> 02:55:30.030]  They were quite prepared to block
[02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:43.273]  All flights coming in and out of Texas over TSA goons touching your junk and intercepting those deadly snow globes, yet we have an Ebola threat imminent and nothing's being done.
[02:55:43.273 --> 02:55:44.753]  This is ridiculous.
[02:55:44.753 --> 02:55:45.593]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:45.593 --> 02:55:51.815]  And at the time this was happening, we subsequently learned from this lawsuit that John Corbett has going with the TSA.
[02:55:51.815 --> 02:55:52.795]  They published on Pacer.gov
[02:55:53.935 --> 02:55:55.316]  An unredacted version.
[02:55:55.316 --> 02:55:56.697]  Later they put a redacted version up.
[02:55:56.697 --> 02:56:06.082]  And what they were saying is, at exactly the same time, in internal documents, the TSA was saying there is no threat of terrorists against airports or airplanes.
[02:56:06.082 --> 02:56:08.944]  Yet they were going to turn Texas into a no-fly zone.
[02:56:08.944 --> 02:56:11.525]  Because it was about controlling people.
[02:56:11.525 --> 02:56:14.287]  They don't want to control the disease, they want to control people.
[02:56:14.907 --> 02:56:19.150]  Talking about irrelevance, I mean, we got the Pentagon now unveiling a plan for dealing with climate change.
[02:56:19.150 --> 02:56:22.852]  I mean, they've got a climate change adaptation roadmap.
[02:56:22.852 --> 02:56:30.257]  I mean, whatever the problem, whether it's an Ebola outbreak in Africa or whether it's presumed climate change, they always want to use the military.
[02:56:30.257 --> 02:56:36.662]  It's like, you know, when the only thing you got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail and they're just not effective in these other areas.
[02:56:36.662 --> 02:56:38.623]  But that's not a real threat anyway.
[02:56:38.623 --> 02:56:43.246]  There's not any global warming going on and they haven't tied it to CO2.
[02:56:43.246 --> 02:56:44.547]  The CO2 levels have gone up.
[02:56:44.987 --> 02:56:46.587]  The temperatures have not gone up.
[02:56:46.587 --> 02:57:01.071]  The real hockey stick is the number of people who are getting Ebola in the African nations and they're completely ignoring that while they're spinning around playing with climate change and making no-fly zones out of the TS to support the TSA.
[02:57:01.071 --> 02:57:03.892]  Steve in Arizona, final call, you're on the air, go ahead, make it quick.
[02:57:05.754 --> 02:57:11.576]  Hi, I'm a firefighter from Arizona, and I just want to point out something real quick that's distressing.
[02:57:11.576 --> 02:57:15.618]  I haven't received any training formally from my department.
[02:57:15.618 --> 02:57:17.859]  I don't fault them for it.
[02:57:17.859 --> 02:57:23.021]  I kind of fault the government for it because of the erroneous information that's being disseminated.
[02:57:23.021 --> 02:57:28.243]  For example, the president saying that you cannot catch Ebola riding on a bus with someone
[02:57:30.405 --> 02:57:39.681]  Noticing that the CDC classifies Ebola as a biosafety level 4H agent, which requires a fully encapsulated suit to deal with.
[02:57:41.070 --> 02:57:47.233]  Yeah, and there are only four of those biosecurity facilities in the entire United States, David Knight.
[02:57:47.233 --> 02:57:48.193]  And you're not alone.
[02:57:48.193 --> 02:57:50.294]  It's not just firefighters and first responders.
[02:57:50.294 --> 02:57:57.497]  85% of nurses, this is a story up on Infowars.com right now from Kit Daniels, 85% of nurses are not trained for Ebola.
[02:57:57.497 --> 02:58:03.460]  76% of nurses also say the hospital that they work at has no policy for admitting Ebola patients.
[02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:06.702]  And yet, we're told by the politicians, don't worry, everything's under control.
[02:58:06.702 --> 02:58:07.802]  They haven't done a thing.
[02:58:07.802 --> 02:58:09.563]  It's just blustering, bluffing.
[02:58:10.236 --> 02:58:13.857]  And a lot of nurses have been protesting that they've not received that training either.
[02:58:13.857 --> 02:58:14.797]  That's right.
[02:58:14.797 --> 02:58:15.817]  It's amazing.
[02:58:15.817 --> 02:58:17.798]  We'll continue to track it.
[02:58:17.798 --> 02:58:19.738]  A lot of breaking Ebola news going up today.
[02:58:19.738 --> 02:58:24.359]  Of course, we had the second patient in Dallas back on Sunday.
[02:58:24.359 --> 02:58:29.700]  Concerns out of Europe again that more Ebola cases could be arriving in the UK as well.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:32.341]  We'll continue to track it on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:32.341 --> 02:58:35.661]  Be sure to support us at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:35.661 --> 02:58:38.142]  And join us tomorrow on the Alex Jones Show Live.
