[00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:15.089]  The Army is very proud of the new American city they've built to practice martial law.
[00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.172]  The government really can do something quickly.
[00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.835]  They built this 300 acre city in just two years.
[00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:25.998]  Compare that to how long they take in your city just to build a road.
[00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.002]  But then they did have 96 million dollars of your tax money to play with.
[00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:38.829]  To transition from an army of execution, doing what we've got to do, to an army of preparation to be ready for what comes next.
[00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:40.170]  This is a place
[00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.269]  Uh, where we can be creative and you can come up with solutions for problems that we don't even know we have yet.
[00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:53.149]  The public may not know the problem yet, because they haven't yet executed the false flag event that they'll use to openly activate martial law.
[00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:59.992]  But the military has been creating scenarios where they can justify a move against small-town America for quite some time.
[00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:07.496]  And they've made it clear that their enemy is gun owners, veterans, those who want a small limited government, and Christians.
[00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:14.059]  The UK Telegraph reported that the town was complete with a subway, railroad, football field, and mosque.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.380]  Mosque?
[00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:17.634]  That's not a mosque.
[00:01:18.374 --> 00:01:23.035]  That's a small-town Christian church with a steeple and gothic windows.
[00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:26.256]  Mosques have minarets, rounded arches, etc.
[00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:31.077]  It's not that they've kept the current military's attitude toward Christians a secret, either.
[00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:32.057]  It was the U.S.
[00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:43.419]  Army that conflated the Ku Klux Klan with mainstream Christian groups like the American Family Association or the Family Research Council, calling these mainstream evangelical groups hate groups.
[00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:54.906]  In just the last year, an official Army email and briefings at both Fort Hood, Texas and Camp Shelby, Mississippi attacked Christian groups and said they don't share Army values.
[00:01:55.447 --> 00:02:04.853]  Most recently, we've seen a FOIA request that showed last year's training scenario in Ohio identified gun owners and people who believe in limited government as the enemy.
[00:02:05.173 --> 00:02:12.278]  And then there's retired Colonel Kevin Benson, currently teaching at Fort Leavenworth, who spelled it out clearly in his Vision of the Future.
[00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:18.039]  When the leaders of the group hold a press conference to announce their goals, they invoke the Declaration of Independence.
[00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:26.242]  And they argue that the current form of the federal government is not deriving its just powers from the consent of the governed, but is actually destructive to these ends.
[00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:31.043]  Therefore, they say the people can alter or abolish the existing government and replace it with another.
[00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:34.864]  And while mainstream politicians and citizens react with alarm... Right.
[00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.645]  ...with alarm to the words of the Declaration of Independence,
[00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:49.562]  The Tea Party insurrectionists in South Carolina enjoy groundswell of support from other Tea Party groups, militias, racist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.704]  And as we've shown you many times in the past, U.S.
[00:02:52.784 --> 00:03:07.097]  military documents describing CONUS operations, that's the Continental United States, where rules regarding the use of deadly force in confronting dissidents are made disturbingly clear with the directive that a warning shot will not be fired.
[00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:11.582]  Or this document that talks about policies that would be applied within U.S.
[00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:12.322]  territory.
[00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:20.832]  With the internment, resettlement, indoctrination, and re-education of political dissidents using their social security number.
[00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:23.575]  Clearly, it's not for foreign operations.
[00:03:24.055 --> 00:03:27.599]  And finally, I think it's significant how detailed these buildings are.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.683]  They could easily train for foreign urban warfare using concrete shells of buildings which are cheaper and that's what they've done in the past.
[00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.405]  But here they have a completely intact American town.
[00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:43.807]  Down to the Washington DC subway logos and a small church building.
[00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:47.149]  Looks like they're training for a different kind of conflict.
[00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:56.253]  President James Madison wrote, the means of defense against foreign danger have always been the instruments of tyranny at home.
[00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:08.576]  But as Alex Jones pointed out in his documentary, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, way back in 2001, FEMA was telling firefighters and other emergency personnel in Kansas that the Founding Fathers were terrorists.
[00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:15.342]  When people are passionate about what they believe in, they become a very difficult enemy to defeat.
[00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:18.045]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.321]  You mean, uh, George Washington?
[00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:28.521]  Yeah.
[00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.301]  Paul Revere?
[00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:30.562]  Yeah.
[00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:34.224]  These guys right here, let me ask you something.
[00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:35.405]  Did they try to scare people?
[00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:36.946]  Well, yeah.
[00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.968]  They tried to intimidate the British.
[00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:41.449]  Did they use acts of violence?
[00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:46.112]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism.
[00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:47.392]  Posse Comitatus?
[00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:48.613]  Constitution?
[00:04:49.394 --> 00:04:51.315]  That's just yesterday's red tape.
[00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:07.890]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:15.319]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.683]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:20.586]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:25.414]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
