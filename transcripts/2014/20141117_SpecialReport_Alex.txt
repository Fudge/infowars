[00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:15.769]  Do you expect the person sitting next to you on a flight has been thoroughly screened like you have?
[00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.431]  Yes, but CBS 2 hasn't covered that's not always the case.
[00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:27.338]  It's hard to believe in post 9-11 New York that travelers could get on an airplane without the security rituals many have come to trust.
[00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:30.381]  Security rituals we have come to trust?
[00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:45.452]  We've been calling it security theater for a long time, but I think ritual actually captures it better, because it is a kind of religion of the state, and it requires the adherents to have a kind of childlike faith in the omnipotence of the state.
[00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:48.415]  Think about the security ritual.
[00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:51.097]  We come before our masters who treat us as guilty.
[00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:54.319]  To get absolution from our masters, we submit to them.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.322]  We allow them to humiliate and to degrade us.
[00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:04.316]  Some of us will be singled out for additional humiliation as a lesson to the rest as to who's in authority.
[00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:11.741]  And if we submit, we are blessed with a temporary indulgence to proceed on our pilgrimage.
[00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:15.383]  Forgive me, I have scanned.
[00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:19.485]  The government wants you to view them as God.
[00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:24.388]  To do that, they attempt to reproduce the very attributes of God.
[00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:43.699]  God, verment, wants you to see it as omniscient, knowing everything about you, omnipresent, its constant presence on the media, cameras watching you everywhere, on your phone, on your computer, and as omnipotent, presenting itself as all-powerful and irresistible.
[00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:49.418]  This is why the police are becoming increasingly brutal and publicly getting away with it.
[00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:55.259]  And the true believers in Godverment love the feeling of security their religious devotion gives them.
[00:01:55.699 --> 00:02:06.202]  And they're incensed that while they've been fingerprinted, investigated, and paid an $85 fee to get special privileges, others who haven't paid their dues are being led into the line.
[00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:08.182]  They just let everybody into the line?
[00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:09.102]  And why?
[00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:11.683]  Because it's convenient for the TSA.
[00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:20.088]  Remember that first Thanksgiving after they put in the naked scanners, afraid that protesters would make the Godverment look weak by clogging the system in protest?
[00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:27.612]  The TSA just turned off the scanners, turned off the security, on the busiest travel day of the year.
[00:02:28.453 --> 00:02:31.414]  And that's what they're doing now as they feel like it with the pre-check program.
[00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:41.861]  Passengers without background checks whisked through the same lines reserved for pre-screen travelers, members of the TSA's pre-check program.
[00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:47.335]  And the true believers of Godverment are incensed at the lack of privilege.
[00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:50.398]  But here's the real truth about their security rituals.
[00:02:51.198 --> 00:03:01.365]  As John Corbett challenged their unconstitutional molestations in court, unredacted TSA documents were posted by the government, mistakenly, on Pacer.gov as part of the lawsuit.
[00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:07.950]  At exactly the same time they were threatening to turn the state of Texas into a no-fly zone in 2011,
[00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:19.716]  Because Texas legislators were going to stop their unwarranted sexual molestation, the TSA admitted that there was no threat to airports or to airplanes.
[00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:26.619]  Yet, they were willing to turn Texas into a no-fly zone to maintain their security rituals.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.824]  Now, if the mainstream media reported that, it would really destroy the sheeple's faith in the security rituals many have come to trust.
[00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:37.925]  From For War's Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:55.103]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:03:55.563 --> 00:04:05.272]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:09.353]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:14.574]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:21.175]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.775]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
