[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.751]  South by Southwest.
[00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:09.895]  The international festival showcasing advances in technology and new talent is dragging us backwards in the ways of our civil liberties.
[00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:18.941]  By promoting the likes of Michael Bloomberg and his mayors against illegal guns and also Shannon Watts, the former Monsanto executive and her mom's demand action.
[00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:24.025]  Both group for on hand the opening weekend of the festival to push their anti-gun agenda.
[00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:33.075]  During the event, the speakers boasted about their ability to take over sites such as Facebook, their success in placing gun chatter in the same category as porn.
[00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:40.164]  And as people have pointed out in the past, sometimes your presence on social media is more important to your campaign than how much money you can raise.
[00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:45.669]  And while some may attack our rights from the shadows, we exercise our rights in broad daylight.
[00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.655]  That's why this Wednesday, March 12th, armed activists will be marching through South by Southwest in defense of our civil liberties.
[00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:57.418]  And we'll be broadcast live on the Alex Jones Radio Show at 12 p.m.
[00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:57.939]  Central.
[00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:10.029]  And we'll set the stage for an even larger open carry event March 15th, that's a Saturday, where liberty-loving people will gather together to peacefully show their Second Amendment rights to an international community.
[00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:18.931]  Join us this Wednesday and Saturday at locations to be announced soon as we continue to bring the message of liberty and freedom to downtown Austin, Texas.
[00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:25.152]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.612]  If you want them, come and take them!
