[00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.369]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.617]  It's Thursday, May 22, 2014, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:26.740]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:29.365]  Tonight...
[00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:33.444]  Foreign troops practice invading a U.S.
[00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:33.885]  city.
[00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:40.310]  Then, the TSA is set to purchase 24 million rounds of duty ammunition.
[00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.253]  And police use Twitter for pre-crime investigations.
[00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.136]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:54.782]  Again, it's all about, we're all off balance, we have no free speech, but government can do whatever it wants.
[00:00:58.404 --> 00:01:03.486]  Well, there was another urban warfare training exercise this week, but this one was a little bit different.
[00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:05.487]  It was international.
[00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:11.290]  Just underscoring even further how the military is now under UN-NATO control.
[00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.831]  Now, this was a U.S.
[00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:19.394]  Special Forces and Commandos from 16 foreign nations practice invading Tampa.
[00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:24.657]  They were there during an unprecedented drill at the Tampa Convention Center in Florida.
[00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:27.579]  Service members from every branch of the U.S.
[00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:37.085]  military ran drills alongside commandos from Belgium, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Jordan, Poland, Thailand, and other countries.
[00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:40.447]  And the Tampa Tribune there tried to reassure residents who
[00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:54.457]  Some might have been leading up to the event saying, if you see military helicopters flying over downtown Tampa next Tuesday, it's not a sign that we are under attack by the Russians, the North Koreans, or the New World Order.
[00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:56.398]  They just had to throw that in there.
[00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.343]  Now, commandos were tasked with rescuing the Tampa mayor from violent extremists.
[00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:10.029]  They had helicopters, boats, military vehicles, and all were unloading blanks as teams worked to rescue the mayor.
[00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.510]  Now you can see the onlookers there.
[00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.992]  The crowds were gathered around, you know, cheering on the special forces.
[00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:21.793]  And, you know, not to say that I wouldn't have wanted to see that either.
[00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:28.296]  I mean, the special forces are pretty badass, but basically it's just saying, look, look at all the foreign troops here.
[00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:30.618]  In America, this is completely normal.
[00:02:31.138 --> 00:02:38.403]  You know, one of the special forces guys there said, it's pretty unique for me because I don't normally have people seeing what I do.
[00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:39.324]  It's kind of special.
[00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:46.870]  And that's the thing that is so bizarre because this is just adding to the growing number of these urban warfare training drills that we're seeing.
[00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.895]  It's concerning, of course, because the troops are being trained to see conservatives as domestic terrorists.
[00:02:54.395 --> 00:03:08.264]  Meanwhile, the public is now being acclimated to seeing troops and foreign troops jumping out of helicopters and rescuing people and shooting blanks out of boats and rescuing the mayor from all of these violent extremists.
[00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:11.546]  And we're seeing this in multiple cities everywhere.
[00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:12.707]  L.A., Miami.
[00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:14.868]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.490]  So it's basically acclimating the public to this presence.
[00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.373]  We've got, you know, Homeland Patrols, the DHS, the TSA.
[00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:35.080]  Seems like we would be safer with all of these agencies, but more and more by the day it seems like what's really happening is they are building a prison around us and just trying to warm us all up to the idea.
[00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.384]  Now, the question remains, why are they arming the TSA?
[00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:42.186]  Right?
[00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:49.930]  The TSA, it's not enough that they have their naked body scanners and their touchy-feely grabby hands groping your kids through the line.
[00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:52.172]  Now they will be armed.
[00:03:52.712 --> 00:04:04.138]  According to a FedBizOpps solicitation, the TSA is requesting 24 million rounds of .357 SIG duty ammunition over a five-year period.
[00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:10.282]  So, of course, this prompts the question, is the federal agency planning to arm its workers?
[00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:28.874]  Now, the request says an estimated quantity is approximately 4.8 million rounds of .357 SIG duty ammunition, totaling 24 million over the life of the contract, adding that the ammo will be used at DHS component locations nationwide.
[00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:33.238]  No offense to all of the TSA operatives out there.
[00:04:33.278 --> 00:04:35.060]  I'm sure that you are not all inept.
[00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:41.728]  But frankly, we can't even trust the TSA to go through our bags without stealing something.
[00:04:41.788 --> 00:04:44.010]  And a lot of them are convicted pedophiles.
[00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:47.715]  But now they're going to have guns while they pat us down.
[00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:56.259]  So, either that or the some 4,000 air marshals that they have working with the TSA are going to be shooting a lot of rounds of ammo.
[00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.121]  So, whatever it is, it's a frightening scenario.
[00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:05.224]  But again, they are loading up on the ammo, they are militarizing the local police force.
[00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:07.745]  Meanwhile, they're asking you and I to, well...
[00:05:09.486 --> 00:05:09.927]  I agree with you.
[00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.773]  I am on your side on this, but I'm just wondering if that's not an invitation to somebody with a gun.
[00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:38.816]  Do you want to find out?
[00:05:38.896 --> 00:05:39.796]  I don't know.
[00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:40.957]  I want to think about it.
[00:05:41.037 --> 00:05:43.719]  I agree with you, but I'm not sure about the sign.
[00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.111]  That was an anti-gun advocate refusing to advertise his home as a gun-free zone.
[00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:56.252]  I'm very much pro-gun, but I do understand that they're not for everybody.
[00:05:56.532 --> 00:06:04.313]  There have been various restaurants that have come forward to announce that firearms are not allowed in their establishments following open carry demonstrations.
[00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:11.475]  I would caution these establishments that a proudly gun-free zone in North Carolina was recently robbed at gunpoint.
[00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:16.077]  Looks like business as usual inside the pit as workers prepare for the arrival of diners.
[00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:21.180]  But they all know about last night's robbery by three men you see here wearing hoodies.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.942]  The bandits showed pistols and assaulted two workers.
[00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:27.563]  Their boss says now... They're doing great.
[00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:30.745]  One of them actually did go to the hospital and was released.
[00:06:30.985 --> 00:06:31.926]  They took a good look at him.
[00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:32.266]  He's fine.
[00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:37.496]  Luckily nobody was killed, but an employee was assaulted to the point of hospitalization.
[00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:42.837]  It's very much proof that men with intentions to do harm are not swayed away by signage.
[00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:50.540]  Moving out of restaurants and into the streets, an open carry group in Arlington, Texas is fighting for their first amendment as well as their second.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.702]  The group was told that they could not hand out pocket constitutions to motorists who were not, quote, lawfully parked.
[00:06:57.222 --> 00:07:03.888]  Which means that they couldn't go to places like intersections where people often donate to churches and also provide means to the homeless.
[00:07:04.148 --> 00:07:10.994]  So if you can't hand out a constitution in the United States of America, how many freedoms do you really have?
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.460]  But that's what they want you to do.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.621]  Just give up your guns and they'll take care of you.
[00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:20.082]  They just want you to submit and obey.
[00:07:20.362 --> 00:07:23.982]  And in fact, it's not just submitting that they want you to do.
[00:07:24.342 --> 00:07:26.043]  They want you to join them.
[00:07:26.563 --> 00:07:28.423]  See something, say something.
[00:07:28.603 --> 00:07:31.824]  And now they're hoping that you just offer up your information freely.
[00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:38.806]  Now, more and more police are turning to social media to help solve the crimes and nab the bad guys.
[00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:42.067]  Pre-crime prevention.
[00:07:43.007 --> 00:07:49.069]  Officers are urging departments to utilize services like Twitter as tools for this pre-crime prevention.
[00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.371]  One quote out there is that Twitter is seen as the new police scanner.
[00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:57.613]  And this is according to a crime analysis unit manager in Jacksonville.
[00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:06.076]  He said, of course, they have no reservations about violating people's privacy as all that information is uploaded voluntarily by users.
[00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:08.839]  He said, we're not sabotaging people's privacy.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.361]  They're throwing it out there.
[00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:22.579]  Now, statistics show that courts favor social media evidence when provided as justification for probable cause, with up to 87% of search warrants holding up in court.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:29.183]  So basically the cops are able to take your tweets and take it to a court and get a search warrant to search your home.
[00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:32.985]  But what happens if cops misinterpret your messages?
[00:08:33.365 --> 00:08:35.866]  That was all it took for Brandon Robb.
[00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:44.511]  He was making anti-establishment messages, that's what they said, and basically that was all it took was his tweets to get him
[00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.671]  We're good.
[00:09:05.237 --> 00:09:05.978]  I don't think so.
[00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:24.050]  This is basically what they want everyone to do, to just feel comfortable.
[00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.491]  You're all being spied on.
[00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:34.016]  All your words, everything you put on Facebook, things that you search in Google, it's all being used to collect all of this information on you.
[00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:35.637]  It's not to stop terrorists.
[00:09:35.837 --> 00:09:39.199]  It is to surveil and police the people.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:47.588]  Basically that's, you know, that's what they're wanting all of us to just be comfortable with, to just accept this and that's exactly what they're going to be doing.
[00:09:47.928 --> 00:09:50.251]  Cops want your information for pre-crime.
[00:09:50.651 --> 00:10:00.702]  Corporations want all of that information so they can send you advertising, so they can make money off of all of the information that you put out there in public.
[00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:04.447]  Or that you use in the privacy of your own home.
[00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:11.334]  Now Google is anticipating selling ads to refrigerators, cars, and more.
[00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:12.515]  Now what do you think?
[00:10:12.535 --> 00:10:16.960]  They were just going to give you those hands-free cars and not bombard you with advertising?
[00:10:17.501 --> 00:10:21.025]  Now a letter that was made public this week details how Google
[00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:32.349]  They justified not disclosing the revenue that they've generated from their mobile devices just yet because the so-called mobile category is shifting and it's in the process of changing every day.
[00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:42.793]  So basically what that means is that Google's services and ads might span just about every kind of hardware with a display and internet connection.
[00:10:43.433 --> 00:11:02.849]  Google has stated in plain English that it does see a future where it could be serving ads on thermostats as well as refrigerators, car dashboards, glasses and watches, which is of course only a partial list of the places that it imagines its advertising content will appear in the future.
[00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:10.896]  Now Google followed up with this clarifying saying, we purchased Nest earlier this year and this report came out
[00:11:11.596 --> 00:11:13.936]  They purchased Nest after they filed this report.
[00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:19.477]  And when they purchased Nest, it didn't have the capability to put this advertising in people's homes.
[00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:27.839]  So basically, Google is just sending out this letter to, you know, hopefully not scare people off from purchasing these smart thermostats.
[00:11:28.219 --> 00:11:30.239]  But of course, we can all see where this is going.
[00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:40.421]  Why wouldn't Google want to take these smart thermostats and start bombarding you with ads every single time you want to adjust the heat in your house?
[00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.722]  We see where this is headed.
[00:11:42.822 --> 00:11:45.743]  We already know it's been called the Internet of Things.
[00:11:45.803 --> 00:11:48.445]  It's going to be used to spy on you.
[00:11:49.165 --> 00:12:03.172]  But while we are busy being policed and being spied upon, the government is busy going in once again into the taxpayer dollars and robbing us blind, basically, so that they can pay for their schemes.
[00:12:03.772 --> 00:12:09.074]  This time, you know, we've been reporting how nobody really knew how Obamacare was going to be funded.
[00:12:09.515 --> 00:12:11.575]  They had to pass it to find out what was in it.
[00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:15.797]  And then once they passed it, they realized they had no idea how to pay for it.
[00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:23.441]  So Obama continues to wave his magic pen and break all kinds of laws to just try and make this thing work.
[00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:28.163]  And all of it is to just push back the effects of Obamacare until after the elections.
[00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:37.390]  Well now, it has been revealed that in addition to all of the magic pen waving, there is also a bailout hidden in the mix.
[00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:49.420]  And somebody's got to pay for it, and of course it's going to be you and I. Now this is buried in hundreds of pages of new regulations that were handed down by the government last week.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.284]  The Los Angeles Times says the Obama administration has quietly adjusted key provisions of its signature health care law.
[00:12:58.824 --> 00:12:59.485]  What do they do?
[00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:04.747]  They're going to give billions of additional dollars to health insurance corporations.
[00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:12.251]  The move, of course, is part of an effort to hold down premium increases ahead of congressional elections later this year.
[00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:14.493]  Listen, everyone saw this coming.
[00:13:14.513 --> 00:13:24.864]  You know, the language was buried, but it's, you know, it's very hard to ask someone to take on an unknown, uncapped expense if you're not gonna pay them back.
[00:13:25.125 --> 00:13:26.947]  So, sure, the money has to come from somewhere.
[00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:28.956]  Somebody's got to pay for it, right?
[00:13:29.356 --> 00:13:30.417]  That was Ari Gross.
[00:13:30.457 --> 00:13:37.141]  He is an insurance broker and, you know, basically he's saying that insurance companies are working to set their premiums now for 2015.
[00:13:38.682 --> 00:13:45.706]  So in order to keep those premiums from being too high, they've got to protect themselves, of course, from financial losses.
[00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:51.429]  A guaranteed taxpayer bailout is in place to offset any of those losses.
[00:13:51.869 --> 00:14:03.274]  Concarrel4Townhall.com writes, Obama is essentially subsidizing health insurance company efforts to gain market share by underpricing their product at taxpayer expense.
[00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:10.798]  So once again, it's a move to stave off the sticker shock that America is going to be facing until after the elections.
[00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:16.641]  Because, of course, if Republicans win control of both houses of Congress, Obamacare could be repealed.
[00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:19.762]  Now, whether or not that's going to happen remains to be seen.
[00:14:20.182 --> 00:14:25.865]  But, you know, we've had delays in employer mandates, the billion-dollar website debacle.
[00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:29.886]  Of course, now we have this taxpayer bailout of the insurers.
[00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:35.169]  Eventually, we are going to have to face the effects of this Affordable Care Act.
[00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:36.210]  But all of
[00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:57.384]  Push all the problems off until after the election.
[00:14:57.744 --> 00:14:58.745]  That's what this is all about.
[00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:01.666]  It's just politics so they can win the election.
[00:15:01.966 --> 00:15:09.008]  But if anyone wants to know just how bad it's going to be when the socialized health care kicks in, just ask the vets.
[00:15:09.648 --> 00:15:31.480]  They have obviously been experiencing problems for decades and Obama was angry in his press conference yesterday and he said caring for our veterans is not an issue that just popped up in recent weeks and of course you know he knows this is not a new issue even though he tried to say that he just learned about it from television but Breitbart points out
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:44.182]  That hasn't stopped several leftists in the press from suggesting that not only is the VA hunky-dory, it is a model for how socialized medicine, including Obamacare, should work.
[00:15:44.483 --> 00:15:45.803]  And I'll quote just one of them.
[00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:47.403]  This is Business Week, reported in 2006.
[00:15:47.963 --> 00:15:56.805]  A nationwide health system that is run and financed by the federal government provides the best medical care in America.
[00:15:57.205 --> 00:15:57.785]  It's true.
[00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:01.766]  If you want to be sure of top-notch care, join the military.
[00:16:02.206 --> 00:16:11.417]  But rather than hear about how things go down at the Department of Veterans Affairs from a press release, we are going to be actually speaking with a former employee of the VA.
[00:16:11.517 --> 00:16:12.919]  That's Veteran Kristen Megan.
[00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:16.362]  She joins Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs coming up later in the show.
[00:16:17.003 --> 00:16:26.108]  But we're not only hearing about veterans dying from waiting too long to receive care, we also hear about the veterans being over prescribed medication.
[00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:35.213]  It's the first go-to with socialized medicine to get five or six different pills for insomnia or anxiety and depression.
[00:16:35.613 --> 00:16:38.315]  But now that's kind of the go-to with children.
[00:16:38.735 --> 00:16:43.840]  Children as young as 2 and 3 years old are being prescribed ADHD medicine.
[00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:54.411]  According to a data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 10,000 American 2 and 3 year olds are being medicated for ADHD.
[00:16:55.532 --> 00:17:01.076]  Now obviously, developmentally, you are supposed to be scattered and disorganized as a toddler.
[00:17:01.496 --> 00:17:06.519]  Child psychiatrist Dr. Nancy Rapoport says this is appalling and irresponsible.
[00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:20.428]  She's been diagnosing and treating children with ADHD for more than 20 years and says she certainly never treats children under 4 years old with this medication because stimulant medications like Ritalin and Adderall
[00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:23.450]  Haven't been studied in children that young.
[00:17:51.369 --> 00:17:53.330]  That plays a huge part in it.
[00:17:53.691 --> 00:18:07.524]  But rather than get to the bottom of that and clean out our diets and detox what our children are feeding themselves, let's just dope them up with drugs that we have no idea what the long-term effects are going to be on these children and their development.
[00:18:07.985 --> 00:18:09.066]  But that is the new norm.
[00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:31.250]  Parents, that was the plan the whole time, to get the parents out of the home, keep them too busy to raise their children, and then send them to the schools so that the state can train them in the ways that the state wants our kids to be, which is, you know, little robots, doped up robots on drugs that haven't even been tested on these children.
[00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.632]  And they have succeeded in getting both parents out of the home.
[00:18:34.672 --> 00:18:39.735]  People are so busy now they don't even have time to teach their kids how to ride bikes anymore.
[00:18:40.116 --> 00:18:46.500]  Now they've got coaches paying $90 an hour to teach their kids to ride bikes.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.382]  Apparently it is a booming business.
[00:18:50.202 --> 00:18:51.523]  But now, you know, what is this?
[00:18:51.603 --> 00:19:01.310]  Parents in America are just too busy working that they can't help their kids and be there for their children through this incredibly pivotal stage in their development.
[00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:06.711]  And this is, of course, all part of the master plan to seize the children.
[00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:18.293]  Now, coming up, the CIA promised earlier this month that it will no longer have these fake vaccine campaigns as the kind that they use to capture Osama bin Laden.
[00:19:18.813 --> 00:19:30.735]  Well, apparently in the country where they put on these fake vaccine campaigns, the residents there said, we're not going to take your American vaccines because we know you're just trying to sterilize us and spy on us.
[00:19:31.175 --> 00:19:33.557]  And now, polio has re-emerged.
[00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:43.126]  That's right, this almost eradicated disease is now making a comeback thanks to the CIA using humanitarian efforts as war tactics.
[00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:44.947]  So, that's coming right up.
[00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:48.891]  And then, Staff Sergeant Jo Biggs speaks with Kristen Megan.
[00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:51.673]  She has more to say about the VA.
[00:19:51.873 --> 00:19:52.314]  Stick around.
[00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:06.493]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:20:06.693 --> 00:20:13.920]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.323]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:20:17.443 --> 00:20:19.224]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:24.048]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:20:24.128 --> 00:20:26.851]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:32.817]  Nascent Iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:20:32.997 --> 00:20:36.460]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:41.706]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of Nascent Iodine.
[00:20:41.906 --> 00:20:44.569]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com
[00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:50.993]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:20:51.113 --> 00:20:53.094]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:21:46.736 --> 00:21:51.997]  The CIA admits fake vaccination programs are used as tools of spycraft.
[00:21:52.377 --> 00:22:01.639]  Amid a deadly backlash and resurgence of polio in Pakistan, the White House was forced to promise that fake vaccines will no longer be used to catch terrorists.
[00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:11.382]  It was revealed in 2011 that the CIA enlisted a Pakistani doctor to run a bogus Hep B campaign to help capture Osama bin Laden.
[00:22:11.722 --> 00:22:19.004]  The CIA used the fake vaccines as a way to obtain DNA samples from children living at the Abbottabad compound.
[00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:27.987]  The agency hoped to confirm that bin Laden was at that compound by comparing the DNA obtained from the children with a sample from the Al Qaeda chief's late sister.
[00:22:28.507 --> 00:22:39.077]  News of the CIA's fake vaccine program caused an armed backlash against immunization workers in the area, reportedly killing 56 people in the past two and a half years.
[00:22:39.477 --> 00:22:41.539]  Another result of the CIA's actions?
[00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:50.147]  Many Pakistani parents refused vaccines for ailments like polio, likely causing a resurgence of the almost eradicated disease.
[00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:54.831]  Clearly a line needs to be drawn between humanitarian efforts and war tactics.
[00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:59.394]  Their abuse of trust means the disease is now spreading to other countries.
[00:22:59.794 --> 00:23:05.158]  And it's certainly not the only time the CIA has been caught using vaccine programs to do some dirty work.
[00:23:05.578 --> 00:23:09.781]  The Tuskegee syphilis experiment left hundreds of black males dead between 1932 and 1972.
[00:23:12.643 --> 00:23:21.106]  The men thought they were receiving free health care, but were actually being experimented on while access to syphilis-curing penicillin was denied.
[00:23:21.406 --> 00:23:27.188]  Victims of the study included wives who contracted the disease and children born with congenital syphilis.
[00:23:27.608 --> 00:23:30.069]  In October 2010, the U.S.
[00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:37.892]  formally apologized to Guatemala for conducting similar experiments on prisoners, soldiers and patients in a mental hospital in the 1940s.
[00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:50.438]  ...and Merck vaccine scientist Dr. Maurice Hilleman admitted that dirty vaccines carrying traces of SV40, AIDS, and cancer viruses were being administered to Americans.
[00:23:50.978 --> 00:23:53.780]  But they were first being tested on the Russians.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.702]  So I brought African greens.
[00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:02.745]  I didn't know we were importing AIDS virus at the time.
[00:24:03.713 --> 00:24:11.484]  No, that's right, but yellow fever vaccine had leukemia virus in it, and you know, this is in the days of very crude science.
[00:24:11.864 --> 00:24:14.368]  I just think this virus may have some long-term effects.
[00:24:14.568 --> 00:24:16.731]  And he said, what?
[00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:20.132]  Cancer.
[00:24:21.433 --> 00:24:22.194]  I love it.
[00:24:22.714 --> 00:24:23.275]  I love it.
[00:24:23.335 --> 00:24:24.115]  Go ahead.
[00:24:24.836 --> 00:24:31.862]  The jokes that were going around was, gee, we would win the Olympics because the Russians would all be loaded down with tumors.
[00:24:34.004 --> 00:24:36.025]  This is where the vaccine was being tested.
[00:24:36.065 --> 00:24:36.486]  This was 100%.
[00:24:38.027 --> 00:24:42.410]  This is proof that even way back then, they knew vaccines would cause cancer.
[00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:55.677]  But even before the CIA's hoax vaccine program was revealed, the Taliban in Pakistan fiercely opposed Western-backed vaccination campaigns, claiming that they were just secret efforts to sterilize Muslim children.
[00:24:56.277 --> 00:25:02.081]  That idea is not so far-fetched considering what Bill Gates had to say about reducing population growth.
[00:25:02.681 --> 00:25:05.643]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:09.240]  That's back from high school algebra.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.420]  But let's take a look.
[00:25:11.501 --> 00:25:12.942]  First we've got population.
[00:25:13.722 --> 00:25:15.984]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:25:16.444 --> 00:25:18.065]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:25:18.665 --> 00:25:27.030]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:39.136]  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is committing $10 billion over the next 10 years to make it the most aggressive decade ever, rolling out new vaccines to poor nations around the world.
[00:25:39.877 --> 00:25:49.662]  And this is of course in alignment with the diabolical Master Population Scheme meant to cull the world of what the authoritarian scumbags see as useless feeders.
[00:25:50.182 --> 00:25:56.230]  The National Security Study Memorandum 200 was completed in 1974 by the U.S.
[00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.115]  National Security Council under the direction of Henry Kissinger.
[00:26:00.896 --> 00:26:05.082]  It detailed the implications of worldwide population growth for U.S.
[00:26:05.122 --> 00:26:07.084]  security and overseas interests.
[00:26:07.685 --> 00:26:08.225]  The gist?
[00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:12.567]  Population growth in least developed countries is a concern to U.S.
[00:26:12.627 --> 00:26:21.971]  national security because it would tend to risk civil unrest and political instability in those countries that had a high potential for economic exploitation.
[00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:25.992]  Basically, a larger population could rise up against the globalists.
[00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:27.613]  And due to the U.S.'
[00:26:27.573 --> 00:26:35.376]  's increasing need for minerals from abroad, the policy gives paramount importance to population control measures in those countries.
[00:26:36.076 --> 00:26:38.979]  NSSM 200 recommends that U.S.
[00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:51.891]  leadership influence national leaders and that worldwide support for this population control should be sought through mass media and other education programs led by the U.N., USIA, and USAID.
[00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:58.697]  Not surprisingly, the report states, no country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion.
[00:26:59.558 --> 00:27:02.899]  Ah, and ladies, you just thought they wanted you to have a choice in the matter.
[00:27:03.379 --> 00:27:11.981]  In actuality, it's just further proof of the racist agenda of eugenicists to sterilize minorities and convince them to abort their babies.
[00:27:12.641 --> 00:27:17.122]  This idea of population control has been around for decades and probably much longer.
[00:27:17.482 --> 00:27:27.485]  It's backed by powerful economic interests to cull the world population of the useless feeders so corporate giants can exploit world resources unimpeded.
[00:27:39.983 --> 00:27:47.129]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:49.410]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:27:49.611 --> 00:27:54.795]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:27:54.955 --> 00:28:00.059]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:28:00.199 --> 00:28:03.302]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:07.506]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:28:07.706 --> 00:28:12.030]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:22.239]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.022]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:28:25.342 --> 00:28:33.374]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:29:51.155 --> 00:29:54.297]  We've all seen the stories covering the VA scandal in the mainstream media.
[00:29:54.957 --> 00:29:56.498]  Well, tonight, I have Kristen Megan.
[00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:57.699]  She's a U.S.
[00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:03.102]  Air Force veteran, and also, she was an employee at a VA in Chicago.
[00:30:03.683 --> 00:30:07.185]  She's here to shed a little bit of light on the corruption she saw at her office.
[00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:09.806]  I'd like to welcome Kristen Megan to the show today.
[00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:10.567]  Thanks for being here.
[00:30:10.587 --> 00:30:10.947]  How are you?
[00:30:11.988 --> 00:30:12.208]  Great.
[00:30:12.248 --> 00:30:13.068]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:17.131]  Now, tell me about what it is you've seen during your time as a VA employee.
[00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:24.773]  Well, I worked at the second largest VA hospital here in Chicago called the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.
[00:30:24.793 --> 00:30:27.235]  I was there for two years.
[00:30:28.316 --> 00:30:35.644]  I saw some things that resulted in my decision to never be seen at a VA medical center or clinic ever.
[00:30:35.664 --> 00:30:41.290]  I could tell you so many different stories, but I can tell you as an employee and also a veteran,
[00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:47.174]  It is unbelievable the things that go behind those doors that are just now slowly becoming public.
[00:30:48.774 --> 00:30:55.615]  One of the biggest issues with the VA care is the fact that we all know there's a rise in suicides and anxiety and depression.
[00:30:56.036 --> 00:31:02.117]  And instead of actually treating the underlying issues through new technologies, they just hand out pills.
[00:31:02.937 --> 00:31:08.858]  And they hand out so much medication at the VA that at the VA, pills have become a currency.
[00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:15.454]  And veterans get arrested or they get detained because it's federal property because they're just handed out these pills.
[00:31:15.895 --> 00:31:20.883]  I mean, I could go, I have a back problem, I could go to the VA right now and probably get a three month supply of Vicodin.
[00:31:21.804 --> 00:31:23.267]  In the private industry, that won't happen.
[00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:32.643]  And I really believe that they rely on veterans being addicted because they go to what's called the addiction clinic, where they receive funding per head.
[00:31:33.063 --> 00:31:34.965]  So it's almost like creating a customer.
[00:31:34.985 --> 00:31:37.107]  You know, a repeat, like, lease customer.
[00:31:37.147 --> 00:31:45.013]  You know, let's not treat the issue, let's just hand out pills like candy, not explaining the side effects, and then you know that they're just going to keep coming back.
[00:31:45.453 --> 00:31:50.538]  And what a lot of people don't understand is that the pharmacy is the cash cow of a hospital.
[00:31:51.258 --> 00:31:52.219]  What was your exact position there?
[00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:52.900]  What was your job at the VA?
[00:32:06.595 --> 00:32:15.983]  I was a GS-12 in the position of an industrial hygienist and an environmental specialist, also known as what they called GEMS, which was Green Environmental Management System.
[00:32:16.023 --> 00:32:20.307]  So I ensured compliance with EPA and OSHA and the Joint Commission Standards.
[00:32:20.707 --> 00:32:22.549]  So employee and patient safety and health.
[00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.573]  So in your opinion, the veterans there were just treated horribly all around?
[00:32:29.264 --> 00:32:30.285]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:32:30.305 --> 00:32:38.788]  One of the most sad things that I saw working at the VA was the fact that they had an agreement with local colleges.
[00:32:40.589 --> 00:32:56.260]  No disrespect to people who are trying to learn and practice in the medical field, but unless you're licensed, and I have a serious medical issue that was an incentive for me to be in the military, the last thing I want is some young, inexperienced person experimenting on me like a guinea pig.
[00:32:56.721 --> 00:33:09.410]  So you would go to an appointment and you would literally be seen by a college student and just kind of be treated as if this is a volunteer area, you know, for them to just kind of hit or miss with your medical care.
[00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:17.052]  Someone I spoke to the day before yesterday said the exact same thing, that they were bringing in college students on weekends to kind of run the hospital.
[00:33:19.073 --> 00:33:32.997]  Yes, like I said, there's funds that come in by having an agreement to allow those people to gain a residency there, and what happens is they have an agreement where they'll eventually get transitioned once they're licensed to be hired on as full-time.
[00:33:34.597 --> 00:33:39.260]  I mean, personally, if I want to get seen for an issue, I would like to know.
[00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:49.288]  I research all my physicians, and there's just no way I would go and see someone who isn't fully licensed, has no reviews, because they don't have an established background.
[00:33:49.748 --> 00:33:54.231]  I understand there needs to be on-the-job training, but there should be oversight by an attending physician.
[00:33:54.751 --> 00:33:58.234]  Now, you said you do not go to any of these VA clinics anymore.
[00:33:58.394 --> 00:33:58.694]  Oh, no.
[00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:02.397]  So, what are you doing with the money you get for compensation from your disability?
[00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:11.289]  Yeah, I do get a monthly VA disability compensation and that money is what pays for my health care and my co-pays.
[00:34:12.209 --> 00:34:22.133]  I've been very open about the fact that I have PTSD and I see a weekly counselor, a counselor that actually provides me methods.
[00:34:22.514 --> 00:34:33.258]  So to clarify, someone who does not work for the VA, you're going outside of the VA to a civilian doctor, psychiatrist, to treat your problems?
[00:34:34.414 --> 00:34:35.354]  That's exactly right.
[00:34:35.434 --> 00:34:37.735]  That's for a number of different ailments.
[00:34:38.496 --> 00:34:51.600]  But yes, I use those funds to pay for my co-pays in certain things that my insurance actually refuses to pay because I do have a full-time job because they say that it should be taken care of under the VA because it's a pre-existing condition.
[00:34:52.001 --> 00:34:53.741]  However, I pay out of pocket, you know.
[00:34:54.281 --> 00:35:01.484]  I could be using that money that I get for my VA disability, saving it and maybe saving it up for like my child's future or college funds.
[00:35:01.544 --> 00:35:03.705]  But unfortunately, that goes straight to my medical care.
[00:35:05.037 --> 00:35:12.169]  Now yesterday we talked, and in your opinion, were the medications being prescribed to soldiers for their benefit?
[00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:15.254]  Or was there some kind of ulterior motive?
[00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:18.901]  You said the doctors were lining their pockets to kind of make money off of that.
[00:35:19.938 --> 00:35:22.200]  Yeah, absolutely not.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:28.645]  Those medications are not handed out for the best care, I mean for the benefit of the patient or the veteran.
[00:35:30.006 --> 00:35:38.232]  Because anyone who is current on medical studies, especially when you're talking about mental health disorders, medication is a last resort.
[00:35:38.632 --> 00:35:40.954]  But in the VA, it is the first resort.
[00:35:41.434 --> 00:35:51.982]  And to make matters worse, unless you are an immediate danger to your own hazard, like you're suicidal, you can wait four to six months to get an appointment at the VA.
[00:35:52.503 --> 00:35:57.406]  And a lot of times they have these outlying clinics where you go and it's a teleconference.
[00:35:57.586 --> 00:36:01.389]  So you're waiting, you know, 90 to 120 days for a teleconference.
[00:36:01.729 --> 00:36:07.014]  Not even someone that will look you in the face and, you know, make you feel like you matter rather than being a number.
[00:36:07.534 --> 00:36:10.056]  How long were you an employee at the Veterans Affairs Center?
[00:36:11.314 --> 00:36:14.316]  I was employed at the VA for two years as a GS-12.
[00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:15.337]  As a GS-12.
[00:36:15.678 --> 00:36:18.840]  And during that time, you saw a lot of bad things.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.505]  Did you ever bring up those things to, like, you know, the chain of command and ask them about what it is you saw?
[00:36:24.925 --> 00:36:28.628]  Or did they just kind of tell you to hush, hush, be quiet, and keep that to yourself?
[00:36:31.541 --> 00:36:32.121]  Definitely.
[00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:35.582]  And this is kind of a two-fold answer because I am also a veteran.
[00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:43.223]  And one of the main issues that I saw was the fact that as a female, I mean, I left in 2012.
[00:36:44.003 --> 00:36:47.924]  In 2012, you'd think the government would figure out that there's a lot of female veterans.
[00:36:47.944 --> 00:36:50.165]  You know, this is a new thing.
[00:36:50.685 --> 00:36:53.505]  And working at the VA, I was a head of a lot of councils.
[00:36:53.525 --> 00:36:57.206]  I was a chairperson on numerous councils related to safety and health.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:08.183]  And my only choice for getting my female care needs met was to be seen by someone that sat on my council, which was completely uncomfortable and I refused to do.
[00:37:08.543 --> 00:37:13.364]  But there are no programs in place like there is compared to the men for the female veterans.
[00:37:13.444 --> 00:37:14.424]  And I brought this up.
[00:37:15.005 --> 00:37:16.845]  And basically, excuses are made.
[00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:27.188]  And what really, really bothered me and kind of pushed me to my resignation was the fact that, in not so many words, in subliminal ways,
[00:37:28.268 --> 00:37:31.269]  Women are treated like we're not as important as veterans.
[00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:40.333]  I mean, you'll hear in the PTSD community, oh, if your PTSD is not combat related, you know, you should get behind the line because, you know, you're not, your issues aren't as serious.
[00:37:40.854 --> 00:37:42.755]  And the VA pushes that culture.
[00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:48.217]  And instead of creating equality or equal care regardless of gender, it's not happening.
[00:37:48.777 --> 00:37:52.519]  Because more funds come in taking care of the large populace, which is male.
[00:37:53.977 --> 00:37:59.167]  And anytime I report things like that, you know, there's definite retribution.
[00:37:59.187 --> 00:38:04.156]  I had a director who, in the end, had it out for me, which led to me leaving.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.361]  Wow, that's pretty crazy to hear.
[00:38:07.901 --> 00:38:15.504]  Now, when you were working there, did you notice a difference in treatment between civilian employees and veteran employees?
[00:38:16.044 --> 00:38:28.969]  I heard in recent reports from a couple of people I talked to, they said that because they were veteran employees, they didn't get as much pay, and they didn't get vacation time like civilian employees did, and they were treated more like children.
[00:38:31.028 --> 00:38:31.928]  I can agree with that.
[00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:44.153]  A lot of people know that anytime that you are a veteran, and also a disabled veteran, you using USA Jobs or the system to hire federal employees, veterans can get a preference.
[00:38:44.653 --> 00:38:48.815]  But that preference does not automatically mean that you trump someone that has more experience.
[00:38:49.435 --> 00:38:56.602]  And in my case, because I'm younger and I did have a higher position, I definitely was treated as if I was straight out of high school.
[00:38:56.722 --> 00:38:58.784]  I was not looked at as a subject matter expert.
[00:38:59.044 --> 00:39:08.212]  And people who had less credentials than me, who were maybe older or regular civilians, they had better promotions, better ratings.
[00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:15.976]  Better chances at bonuses, because I think that there's this stigma that if you're a veteran and you work at the VA, you were just a shoo-in.
[00:39:16.236 --> 00:39:17.596]  You know, it was just a free ride.
[00:39:18.016 --> 00:39:23.078]  And you know, I can say at some of the low-lying positions, administratively, maybe that's applicable.
[00:39:23.118 --> 00:39:26.299]  But as you move up, you can't just fudge numbers.
[00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:28.340]  You have to have the resume.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.961]  And definitely, civilians are treated better than veterans.
[00:39:32.281 --> 00:39:32.882]  I would agree with that 100%.
[00:39:34.326 --> 00:39:48.584]  Yeah, in my experience, I went to the VA in Austin the other day and just, you know, switching my coverage from the VA Center in South Carolina to here, the guy at the front at the eligibility counter immediately messed my name up in the system.
[00:39:49.145 --> 00:39:50.106]  It blocked everything.
[00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:51.528]  I wasn't able to
[00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:54.011]  See a doctor or anything like that.
[00:39:54.591 --> 00:40:06.324]  And then I was told because I was throwing up blood that it was an urgent issue, but I had to wait until the end of July to be seen because of their mess up and the fact that they just weren't prepared to take that on at the time.
[00:40:07.808 --> 00:40:09.409]  That's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:12.451]  I'm sorry you had to go through that and that's actually a systemic issue.
[00:40:12.951 --> 00:40:15.352]  I don't mind sharing my short personal story.
[00:40:15.372 --> 00:40:28.880]  I have a slip disc in my back and actually I was with the hospital director and we were doing an inspection of the hospital and I immediately was in so much pain that I collapsed to the ground.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.461]  I could barely move.
[00:40:30.901 --> 00:40:33.403]  I just had pain all over my body because of my spine.
[00:40:34.143 --> 00:40:35.985]  And he said, you need to get over to Ortho.
[00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:37.346]  You know, go to the orthopedic clinic.
[00:40:37.966 --> 00:40:40.288]  And I had somebody escort me there.
[00:40:40.408 --> 00:40:42.049]  And I think this was in the month of May.
[00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:43.010]  And I'm in tears.
[00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.891]  I'm sweating because I'm in so much pain.
[00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:55.618]  And the person at the check-in desk not only had no sense of urgency, but told me that the next available opening, I believe, was that the last week of August.
[00:40:56.239 --> 00:41:00.562]  So I actually had to go to the emergency room because they couldn't take 10 minutes out of their day
[00:41:01.437 --> 00:41:06.779]  To treat me for an issue that is documented under my rating and I should have got free care for.
[00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:09.240]  So triage doesn't apply.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:29.227]  And you know, in talking about this issue everyone knows about with the wait times, what's not being addressed is if you say you want your rating re-evaluated or you have another issue that you think is tied to your military time, if you are applying to see a physician for a new issue or worsening issue,
[00:41:30.026 --> 00:41:35.367]  They will just send you an appointment time in the mail, not asking you, hey, you know, are you traveling?
[00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:39.388]  And if you don't make that appointment, you can lose your spot in your claim.
[00:41:39.428 --> 00:41:40.489]  Your claim gets thrown out.
[00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:43.029]  And you'll wait another 90 days for an appointment.
[00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:51.212]  So instead of the old school customer service they should pride themselves in, and actually calling somebody and saying, hey, we have these openings, what works best for you?
[00:41:51.332 --> 00:41:52.632]  No, you just get something in the mail.
[00:41:53.522 --> 00:41:54.783]  Not a signed receipt letter.
[00:41:55.103 --> 00:41:57.125]  So sometimes, me, I travel for a living.
[00:41:57.425 --> 00:42:01.948]  I'll get a letter in the mail, and I don't even know when the appointment's passed, and then I have to resubmit my claim.
[00:42:02.088 --> 00:42:03.830]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:10.655]  And having worked for the VA, you see these programs that are completely a facade about customer service.
[00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:12.256]  And it's not about customer service.
[00:42:12.616 --> 00:42:16.879]  It's about the surveys that people do that are tied to the bonuses.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.001]  Now, how do you feel about
[00:42:20.444 --> 00:42:20.864]  The President
[00:42:43.257 --> 00:42:45.939]  from each facility on wait times and things like that.
[00:42:45.979 --> 00:42:52.405]  So he's known about this stuff for a long time but he's claiming that he has no idea about this just until the beginning of the month.
[00:42:55.047 --> 00:43:07.317]  You know, I'm on the fence about that because why he should have investigated, especially if he's sitting on that type of committee, as someone who has pursued IG complaints and pursued
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:18.227]  Numerous complaints working at the VN as a veteran to see how those get pushed to the wayside and never make it past maybe the second tier of the investigation because it's very biased.
[00:43:18.947 --> 00:43:21.809]  It could be true that actually that these complaints weren't on the books.
[00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:30.996]  However, just going around the country and campaigning over the years, I know a number of veterans have had to say to him, hey, you know, it's not just the claim process that's delayed.
[00:43:31.116 --> 00:43:32.096]  It is the wait times.
[00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:32.817]  So
[00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:40.176]  I do think he is full of it, but at the same time, again, I don't think all these complaints get pushed to where they need to be.
[00:43:40.616 --> 00:43:48.461]  It's just that, you know, over the past few years, he always says, well, it's my number one priority to take care of veterans, you know, with a smile on his face.
[00:43:48.982 --> 00:43:50.743]  But there's nothing getting taken care of.
[00:43:51.123 --> 00:43:53.945]  It just sits around and festers and rots.
[00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:58.949]  And that's basically all the VA is right now, is just this rotten machine that doesn't work anymore.
[00:44:00.034 --> 00:44:14.171]  You know, you're right and one thing I think is the underlying issue, I don't know if people are addressing, is as a federal employee, especially in the VA, you are so protected, the saying is it takes an act of Congress to let somebody go.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.921]  So, everyone's been pushing for the Secretary of the VA to be, you know, let go or forced to resign.
[00:44:20.681 --> 00:44:30.903]  And while I do believe that people at the top of the tier should know what's going on below them, it is unacceptable and it is enabling the bad and lazy behavior of a lot of government employees.
[00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:33.484]  I mean, there's, you always call them the coffee muggers.
[00:44:33.524 --> 00:44:40.206]  You know, they're just walking around because they know they can do whatever they want, sit on Facebook all day, run their own side businesses from government computers.
[00:44:40.706 --> 00:44:42.046]  Nobody's going to say anything.
[00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:47.530]  So this whole excuse that they're understaffed for VBA and VHA is complete BS.
[00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.412]  It's just your quality of people is not being looked over.
[00:44:51.772 --> 00:45:00.438]  You have people who are given, they're enabled, once again, they're enabled to do, you know, a half-assed job.
[00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:05.782]  And it's just unacceptable that we're using this whole fiscal excuse that we just need more money.
[00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:06.763]  You don't need more money.
[00:45:07.003 --> 00:45:09.785]  You need better structure on the inside.
[00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:16.624]  All right, so before we end this interview, I'd like to ask, is there anything else you'd like to get off your chest about the things you've seen there?
[00:45:17.104 --> 00:45:20.827]  Something that's really just kind of eats away at you all the time that you want to tell the people about?
[00:45:21.788 --> 00:45:28.433]  Oh, what eats away at me was as an employee, seeing how much money is wasted at the VA.
[00:45:29.354 --> 00:45:30.355]  I'll give you an example.
[00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:39.444]  Obama has a program out there where you needed to show, federal facilities needed to show that they were doing sustainable energy practices.
[00:45:39.924 --> 00:45:53.519]  Here in downtown Chicago, in a tiny area where we can barely fit recycling bins out on the street, it was presented to me to sign off on, putting a multi-million dollar windmill on top of the roof of the VA.
[00:45:54.716 --> 00:45:56.738]  Knowing that it would just be a statue.
[00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:04.925]  And in spending millions of taxpayer dollars to put a statue on top of a hospital that you know is just a facade.
[00:46:05.005 --> 00:46:06.306]  A taxpayer waste of money.
[00:46:06.846 --> 00:46:10.730]  Just so that we can receive the annual stipend that we would get for that program.
[00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.612]  So you're wasting money to earn money.
[00:46:14.113 --> 00:46:14.953]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:46:14.993 --> 00:46:20.318]  That was the nail in the coffin and that is what led to me to resign because I refused to sign off on that.
[00:46:20.902 --> 00:46:22.785]  Well, I thank you for your time here today, Kristen.
[00:46:22.826 --> 00:46:27.875]  I mean, you've given us a lot of good information to go with and a lot of information for our audience.
[00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:31.661]  I'd like to thank Kristen Beckman for coming on the show tonight and sharing her story with us.
[00:46:32.503 --> 00:46:40.349]  And also, if you have a story to share as a veteran or an employee yourself for the Veterans Affairs, you can go to a new site that was just put out.
[00:46:40.389 --> 00:46:42.751]  It is called VAOversight.org.
[00:46:43.372 --> 00:46:44.452]  And you can go on there.
[00:46:44.813 --> 00:46:48.756]  They have a team of lawyers who are whistleblower experts that will protect you.
[00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:49.817]  They'll take your complaints.
[00:46:50.337 --> 00:46:54.040]  If you're trying to get benefits that you haven't received yet, they'll try to help you get those.

[00:48:28.607 --> 00:48:35.977]  A group of more than 500 retired pro football players have filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL.
[00:48:36.337 --> 00:48:45.409]  They're claiming that the league unethically supplied them with illegal prescription pain medications so they could play the game through serious injuries.
[00:48:45.709 --> 00:48:53.692]  As a result, these players now suffer from addiction and long-term health problems caused by the risky narcotics.
[00:48:53.972 --> 00:49:03.016]  The abusive practice by the NFL basically substituted pain medication for medical care, thus keeping the league's tsunami of dollars flowing.
[00:49:03.216 --> 00:49:08.238]  Players were sent out onto the football field unaware they had serious injuries.
[00:49:08.738 --> 00:49:14.743]  Super Bowl champion quarterback Jim McMahon says team doctors never told him he had a broken neck.
[00:49:14.963 --> 00:49:16.764]  They just fed him more pain pills.
[00:49:16.984 --> 00:49:24.830]  And his teammate Keith Van Horn says he played an entire season with a broken leg while on a steady diet of painkillers.
[00:49:25.411 --> 00:49:31.716]  The class action lawsuit follows another NFL conspiracy to cover up the dangers of concussions.
[00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:41.760]  Which was the focus of League of Denial, a powerful PBS frontline documentary that details how the NFL covered up the concussion crisis.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:50.563]  What League of Denial is about is about the invisible disease attacking the brains of football players.
[00:49:50.963 --> 00:50:05.618]  According to the scientists we talked to, the cumulative effect of maybe as many as 1,500 hits a year, the likelihood that your brain has a lot of damage done to it is very high.
[00:50:06.298 --> 00:50:13.062]  ESPN was so alarmed by the film that they ended their production partnership with PBS for running it.
[00:50:13.462 --> 00:50:22.287]  Meanwhile, the NFL agreed to pay close to $800 million in lawsuits accusing the league of concealing the risk of head injuries.
[00:50:22.827 --> 00:50:30.992]  And as we've been reporting all along here at InfoWars, the National Football League has also emerged as an establishment political tool.
[00:50:31.492 --> 00:50:35.474]  So it makes sense that they cover up scandals and deal drugs.
[00:50:35.874 --> 00:50:43.498]  And get this, the NFL is a $9 billion a year business and growing, yet they are totally tax-free.
[00:50:43.858 --> 00:50:46.979]  That's right, they do not pay a dime in taxes.
[00:50:47.159 --> 00:50:58.765]  The owners consist of a group of billionaires who buy politicians who agree to use your tax dollars to build lavish stadiums that are also set up as FEMA relocation camps.
[00:50:59.205 --> 00:51:02.648]  In the event of an emergency or civil unrest.
[00:51:02.748 --> 00:51:06.710]  Hey, we're here in Denver, Colorado and we're covering Operation Mountain Guardian.
[00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:13.735]  Now this is a large-scale terrorism drill and 100 different agencies actually took part in the exercise.
[00:51:14.056 --> 00:51:19.960]  This was a test for Homeland Security and FEMA to test their capabilities in what they referred to as
[00:51:20.382 --> 00:51:24.383]  as a catastrophic situation involving a terrorist attack.
[00:51:24.683 --> 00:51:38.307]  One of the primary locations of the drill took place right behind me at the Sports Authority field where the exercise involved participants processing children in and out of the FEMA camp that they set up inside of the stadium.
[00:51:39.215 --> 00:51:41.816]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:51:42.076 --> 00:51:48.898]  The NFL has teamed up with the Department of Homeland Security, sending TSA Viper teams to football stadiums.
[00:51:49.338 --> 00:51:59.601]  They turned the Super Bowl into a police state, complete with Illuminati rituals, while at the same time banning pro-Second Amendment ads and promoting Obamacare.
[00:52:00.941 --> 00:52:07.285]  They are the poster child for the New World Order and they play a heavy hand in conditioning the public.
[00:52:07.766 --> 00:52:25.997]  And for those of you who think that it's completely harmless to be a die-hard football fan, like I used to be, and you honestly believe that you're not the subject of conditioning, you have to ask yourselves what it would be like to live in a country where people were as passionate about football as they were for things that actually matter.
