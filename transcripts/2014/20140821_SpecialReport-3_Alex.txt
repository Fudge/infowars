[00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.234]  Thanks.
[00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:10.458]  Please turn off your video.
[00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:40.337]  What'd they say?
[00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:42.077]  I think they said, please turn off your video.
[00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:43.958]  That's what it sounded like to me.
[00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:48.939]  Did they just tell us to turn off, stop filming?
[00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:50.639]  I think that's what they said, honestly.
[00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.400]  Sounded like, this is how it was perceived before.
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.880]  They told us to turn off our recording.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.680]  Trapping everybody in?
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.920]  They tried to.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.281]  Front line of the Info War!
[00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:04.822]  Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, Josh Owens, be front line as they advance on it.
[00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:09.654]  That is really hurting my ears up.
[00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:12.318]  Oh my God, they're coming at us right now.
[00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:13.219]  They're coming at us right now.
[00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.461]  Alright, here we are.
[00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:31.296]  That's a very peaceful solution, officer.
[00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.117]  All right.
[00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:35.179]  Go to JacksonInfoWars.com.
[00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.500]  They're probably not going to smoke.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.320]  Throw him back!
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.981]  Throw him back!
[00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:02.150]  Now notice, they want to talk about the rioters and the looters, and they're popping off smoke!
[00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.333]  My God, man!
[00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:10.115]  Get cover!
[00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:11.996]  Everybody get some cover!
[00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:13.917]  Oh!
[00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.257]  Oh man, somebody just threw a Molotov over here.
[00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:38.418]  I'm going to get back from that.
[00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:43.279]  Bro, they're the ones burning it down.
[00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.479]  You ain't got to do it for them.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.560]  Whoever did that, man.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.800]  Don't do all that.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.501]  Don't burn down your own freaking neighborhood.
[00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.102]  They popping smoke over here.
[00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:55.922]  Bro, don't!
[00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:56.382]  Quit!
[00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:57.302]  Bro!
[00:02:58.283 --> 00:02:59.063]  Bro, quit!
[00:02:59.363 --> 00:02:59.783]  Stop!
[00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:00.723]  Stop!
[00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:02.044]  Bro, quit!
[00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:09.868]  Why you gonna burn down somebody else's house?
[00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:11.148]  What is that?
[00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:23.592]  Thank you.
[00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:25.032]  Thank you for putting that out, bro.
[00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:25.732]  All right.
[00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:26.153]  Thank you.
[00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.990]  Golly!
[00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.212]  Alright, so, somebody lit a fire, but this dude put it out.
[00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:34.592]  Good luck, bro.
[00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:34.932]  Good luck.
[00:03:35.032 --> 00:03:35.852]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:38.194]  Because I don't want us to get the wrong image.
[00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:38.614]  That's right.
[00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:39.394]  Because they're burning it down.
[00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:41.015]  They don't want to pop into flashbangs over here.
[00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:41.255]  Exactly.
[00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:41.755]  Hold up.
[00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:46.297]  Okay, once again, Ja'Kari Jackson, InfoWars.com.
[00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:48.258]  This will likely be my last broadcast of the night.
[00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:49.619]  My phone's about to die.
[00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.520]  And they're shooting stuff at us.
[00:03:59.017 --> 00:04:00.198]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.300]  The guys are coming in the trucks.
[00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:06.823]  They're coming to flank.
[00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:10.806]  I think you don't have to.
[00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:11.686]  Alright.
[00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:14.688]  So, here they come.
[00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.491]  They're popping big bangs.
[00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:19.572]  Joe Big's got shot with a rubber bullet.
[00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:21.453]  Now I'm running down the street.
[00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:23.055]  Man, quit shooting at me!
[00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:27.425]  Quit shooting at me!
[00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:29.332]  You see they shooting at us!
[00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:30.597]  You see that?
[00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:54.636]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding and making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:56.957]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:57.117 --> 00:04:59.757]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:59.817 --> 00:05:03.918]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.399]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.681]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.985]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.826]  We are the true media.
[00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:23.609]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.352]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
