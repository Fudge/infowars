[00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:13.827]  Today we're out here on the streets asking people why they think the Constitution is outdated and whether or not we should take away or add to.
[00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.188]  Let's see what they have to say.
[00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:16.949]  I don't know a lot about this stuff.
[00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.809]  I really don't.
[00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:18.210]  I shouldn't.
[00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.731]  Well, you should know about that.
[00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:21.732]  We share this country.
[00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:24.874]  We should all be proud Americans.
[00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:26.254]  We should all know these things, you know?
[00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:26.775]  You're right.
[00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:27.675]  I know.
[00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:28.776]  I need to learn more about it.
[00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:29.236]  I'm sorry.
[00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:29.696]  Yeah, you do.
[00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.477]  No, it's not out there.
[00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:36.720]  I can't even think of any right now, but I know that some of it is, because it needs to be re-looked at.
[00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.643]  A lot of it, uh... The gun rights, I think, need to be changed.
[00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:44.245]  I think it's not an out there computer document.
[00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:46.466]  People have to follow it more.
[00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:48.027]  What do you think about the right to privacy?
[00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:51.069]  Oh, well they definitely overstepped their bounds on that one.
[00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.849]  With the NSA?
[00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.190]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.251]  How does that make you feel?
[00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.452]  Like I'm being watched all the time.
[00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:58.112]  Doesn't make you feel too good, does it?
[00:00:58.232 --> 00:00:59.933]  No, I don't like it at all.
[00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:03.794]  I'm just kind of busy, so I haven't been really able to think about it.
[00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:12.419]  So I'm just kind of going to school and whatnot, so... Well, when the Constitution was written, it was written to protect the public.
[00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:16.460]  There were a couple of things in there like the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.301]  That has been distorted.
[00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:23.024]  It was in order to protect the pioneers from the British invasions.
[00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:25.366]  And they had to have guns to hunt.
[00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.128]  They didn't have supermarkets like we do today.
[00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.910]  That was the reason they had the right to bear arms.
[00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.793]  So you think we should completely revise the Second Amendment?
[00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:35.574]  You think we should just get rid of it completely?
[00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:41.078]  Well, the Second Amendment has something in it that is very important.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.847]  I think that if you are in a situation where you need to bear arms, yes.
[00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.070]  What that situation would encompass, I can't say.
[00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.275]  But in general, the public should not be allowed to have guns.
[00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:58.510]  I don't think you should rewrite that.
[00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.572]  You should just get rid of all the politicians that are making decisions right now.
[00:02:02.592 --> 00:02:03.433]  All the old cronies.
[00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:03.913]  Yeah.
[00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:05.494]  Let's get a whole new group in there.
[00:02:05.554 --> 00:02:09.696]  That Supreme Court guy that wants change is about 90, about 190 years old, isn't he?
[00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:15.179]  Do you think we should add anything to the Constitution or take away anything at all, like the freedom of speech, right to privacy?
[00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.679]  Not at all.
[00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:16.200]  Not at all.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.362]  Do you think it's okay that the NSA completely violates that right there, our right to privacy?
[00:02:22.463 --> 00:02:22.523]  Um...
[00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:26.185]  It's debatable if they do or they don't.
[00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:27.786]  I mean, so they say it's for our own good.
[00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:32.390]  If that's what they say, but I mean... Who knows?
[00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.172]  You know, as an American though, you don't feel like you've been violated, though?
[00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:37.014]  You know, we give them all this power and this trust.
[00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:39.095]  I think the government violates us every day.
[00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:40.636]  I can't understand.
[00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:42.745]  Uh, I don't know.
[00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:43.746]  Like, I go to school here.
[00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:48.667]  But I'm from Colombia and I live, my whole family lives in Colombia, so I really... Well, you're here.
[00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:49.448]  You should care about it.
[00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:50.288]  It affects you.
[00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:51.008]  No, I do care about it.
[00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:54.609]  The thing is, like, I don't feel educated enough to say, like, I completely support this.
[00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.290]  We are living in a world right now.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.119]  That's terror ridden.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.721]  It's got a lot of problems.
[00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:01.601]  Murders.
[00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:02.681]  Robberies.
[00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:04.362]  But that's always been going on.
[00:03:04.622 --> 00:03:07.643]  Yes, but the popular... The only reason is, though, is the social media.
[00:03:07.943 --> 00:03:09.484]  Now you just have more viewing of it.
[00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:14.606]  And I think that's wrong, too, because a lot of copycat crimes going on.
[00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:15.547]  Alright?
[00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:17.327]  School shootings.
[00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:18.688]  They publicize it.
[00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:19.048]  Why?
[00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:20.749]  Somebody says, hey, that's a good idea.
[00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:21.569]  I'll do that, too.
[00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.130]  Things like that are wrong.
[00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.131]  The media has to stop publicizing crime.
[00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:30.653]  As you can see, there's a lot of varying opinions about the Constitution.
[00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:33.935]  Some people know, some people don't, and some people flat out just don't care.
