[00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.994]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:19.467]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:20.927]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:23.628]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.869]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.531]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:59.949]  Yesterday evening, one mile from the center of downtown El Paso, Texas, our reporter Joe Biggs dressed up as an ISIS terrorist with an ISIS flag, a sword, and a severed head, crossed near a park full of people into the United States.
[00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:05.695]  Now the reason we're doing this is to show the war on terror is a hoax and a fraud.
[00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:06.976]  Our borders are wide open.
[00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:13.158]  Criminal elements of our government are openly funding and supporting ISIS, IS, Al Qaeda and Iraq.
[00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:24.323]  And this is being done to show that if there are terror attacks in this country, the government let it happen while letting illegal aliens fly without IDs.
[00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:35.249]  While harassing citizens and using the terror attacks of 9-11 as we approach the 13th anniversary to take our basic freedoms.
[00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.031]  This report is extremely powerful.
[00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:40.193]  You can see the video at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:42.335]  Here it is for the radio audience.
[00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:50.761]  Stage terror attack.
[00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.824]  El Paso, Texas feds say it's imminent.
[00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:13.535]  The feds have issued a terror alert and believe an attack by the terrorist group ISIS is imminent on or before September 11th, the 13th anniversary of the worst attack on American soil.
[00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:19.300]  InfoWars investigates just miles from the center of El Paso, Texas, where we were able to
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.081]  We're good to go.
[00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:52.348]  We know our government has created and funded ISIS, so whether or not this is a real threat or a false flag, the globalists are now one step closer to their endgame, stripping us of all our liberties.
[00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:01.314]  So we dress up like an ISIS jihadi to be as obvious as possible, to show and to illustrate just how wide open the border really is.
[00:03:09.082 --> 00:03:10.443]  I'll narrate for radio listeners.
[00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:34.302]  Joe Biggs, dressed up like Osama Bin Laden, basically, like James O'Keefe did, chops off a head, simulated, and with the bloody head, the ISIS official flag, that we recreated in our art department, in a jihadi outfit and head turban, walks right out of Juarez, Mexico, across the one foot deep Rio Grande, and makes this announcement.
[00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.443]  By the way, the Feds say ISIS is operating over the border.
[00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:39.883]  They expect an attack is imminent.
[00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:43.064]  Whether that's true or not, we're illustrating why isn't it secure.
[00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:47.865]  There are less cops, more patrol there than there are in Austin, Texas downtown.
[00:03:54.027 --> 00:04:00.389]  Thank you, Obama, for leaving your southern borders open so ISIS can terrorize America.
[00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.450]  ISIS thanks you, President Obama,
[00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:06.966]  We claim this land for surreal law!
[00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:43.495]  We're pointing out the globalists have funded the most radical, vicious, sectarian, murderous cannibals who sexually mutilate children, who cut children's heads off, who are doing all these horrible things.
[00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:44.836]  They're being turned loose.
[00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:46.457]  Eleven aircraft are missing in Libya.
[00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:51.666]  You can just feel they're getting ready to stage something big.
[00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:52.706]  So we're here documenting.
[00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:53.727]  It's wide open.
[00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:55.488]  They let it happen, bare minimum.
[00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.211]  So hopefully we shame the government into protecting our southern border.
[00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:00.472]  That's the goal.
[00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:05.795]  We got three big guests, including a top NSA whistleblower, coming up today.
[00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:06.956]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:06.996 --> 00:05:07.837]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.437 --> 00:05:10.658]  Another major health threat.
[00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:15.600]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.301]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:25.123]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:05:25.404 --> 00:05:28.265]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:31.326]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:33.327]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:36.208]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:05:36.288 --> 00:05:41.790]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.492]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.493]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:55.716]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:16.785]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.466]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:48.391]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:49.493]  Talk about the effects.
[00:06:49.813 --> 00:06:51.275]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:06:51.295 --> 00:06:52.997]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:06:53.257 --> 00:06:54.318]  I feel like I look better.
[00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:55.019]  I feel better.
[00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:56.120]  I feel sexier.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.861]  I love it.
[00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.025]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.828]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:04.069]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:05.150]  Consult your physician.

[00:07:07.513 --> 00:07:08.594]  This is life changing.
[00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:15.280]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.683]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:24.627]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.649]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:33.131]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:40.295]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:07:40.796 --> 00:07:44.538]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:49.700]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.881]  This is innovating.
[00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:58.450]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.716]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:34.380]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:51.465]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, the fifth day already of September 2014.
[00:08:51.585 --> 00:09:01.950]  We'll be back tonight with an original transmission, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News, with myself and the rest of the crew and reporters.
[00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.732]  And then of course I'll be back live in studio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:08.053]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:15.336]  We have Joel Gilbert, the filmmaker, joining us now with his film opening in theaters in different parts of the country.
[00:09:15.717 --> 00:09:24.649]  There's no place like Utopia, exposing the Obama administration, their plan to literally implode this country by design, to build socialism and communism on the ashes of it.
[00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:34.586]  We also have a special guest joining us, who's an activist and filmmaker exposing the globalist Federal Reserve System and fighting back.
[00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:53.454]  And William Binney, the top number four man from the NSA, who has said that it's a totalitarian takeover program, will be joining us to talk about these so-called mystery cell towers, parallel construction, and really how deep the rabbit hole goes on NSA spying show.
[00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:55.715]  Very prestigious guest, very hard to get.
[00:09:56.715 --> 00:09:58.936]  Always a major news making interview.
[00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:02.997]  That should be very informative when he joins us for his third visit.
[00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:07.298]  He's been on with David Knight on the Nightly News and then been on the Syndicated Radio Show about a month ago.
[00:10:07.318 --> 00:10:10.359]  He's going to be joining us again today to analyze the latest information.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.960]  Wow, let's go over the headlines here first.
[00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:18.442]  NATO approves troops on Russian border.
[00:10:21.104 --> 00:10:23.346]  Both sides in conflict agree to cease fire.
[00:10:24.627 --> 00:10:25.328]  Former U.S.
[00:10:25.388 --> 00:10:27.309]  ambassador to the Soviet Union, the U.S.
[00:10:27.369 --> 00:10:30.452]  and NATO are provoking the Ukrainian crisis.
[00:10:30.993 --> 00:10:32.134]  That's the former U.S.
[00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:33.114]  ambassador to Russia.
[00:10:33.134 --> 00:10:42.302]  That's what basically everybody that was formerly an ambassador or worked to basically bring down the Soviet Union is saying this is really dangerous.
[00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:46.486]  Encircling Russia and arming Ukraine are what's provoking the bear.
[00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:48.308]  Jack Metlock
[00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:49.512]  U.S.
[00:10:49.552 --> 00:10:53.553]  Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 87 to 91 says the U.S.
[00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:56.653]  and NATO are to blame for the Ukraine crisis.
[00:10:58.634 --> 00:10:58.974]  Yeah.
[00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:02.255]  I just tell it like I see it.
[00:11:03.215 --> 00:11:07.276]  I've never been for any of these wars against Serbia, against Iraq.
[00:11:09.076 --> 00:11:13.937]  I was against attacking Libya to put al-Qaeda in charge, who's now basically taken the whole country three years later.
[00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:19.937]  I am now supporting Senator Rand Paul and his call for Obama to really bomb ISIS.
[00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:39.907]  Because if they don't, it will engulf the entire Middle East and triple gas prices, which is part of the globalist plan, is to create such a worldwide crisis that then they'll bait and switch and go attack Syria, Egypt, Iran, you name it, and start World War III, and then ISIS and Saudi Arabia will laugh all the way to the bank.
[00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:46.330]  Remember, Saudi Arabia supposedly attacked us on 9-11, so we attacked Iraq.
[00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:56.634]  Now, our government for four years has been funding Al-Qaeda to attack Syria, Libya, and other areas, and so now the answer is bomb Assad again.
[00:11:57.874 --> 00:12:01.095]  That's how dumb they think everybody is.
[00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.277]  They just play stupid with everybody.
[00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:08.420]  So, I'm just telling like it is.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.461]  It's not that Russia's some angel over there.
[00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:13.862]  It's that they're not offensively in our backyard.
[00:12:14.263 --> 00:12:15.523]  Russia isn't taking our liberties.
[00:12:15.743 --> 00:12:17.124]  They're not passing Obamacare.
[00:12:17.344 --> 00:12:18.485]  They didn't open our borders.
[00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:22.387]  They haven't gotten 92 million people not working now.
[00:12:22.707 --> 00:12:24.348]  A hundred and something million on welfare.
[00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:29.751]  Latest numbers out of the Congressional Budget Office and a bunch of other sources as well.
[00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:31.872]  That's in CNS News.
[00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.426]  All of this is going on.
[00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:37.648]  So NATO approves troops on Russian border.
[00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:38.548]  Former U.S.
[00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:39.829]  Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
[00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:40.490]  The U.S.
[00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.411]  and NATO provoking the Ukraine crisis.
[00:12:44.032 --> 00:12:46.554]  Yeah, that's like saying that fish swim in the ocean.
[00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:50.576]  The West overthrew Ukraine when they didn't join the EU.
[00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:55.079]  Russian general demands preemptive nuclear strike doctrine against NATO.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.260]  So what happens next?
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.061]  Zero heads.
[00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:58.522]  Jump on Infowars.com.
[00:13:00.748 --> 00:13:01.749]  That's in the Russian news.
[00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:04.631]  Now, our media is saying that means they want to nuke us.
[00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:04.871]  No.
[00:13:06.412 --> 00:13:16.479]  Six years ago, in 2008, NATO changed the doctrine, and the United States changed the doctrine, and said they may preemptively nuke Russia first.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:28.067]  That broke MAD that had been around since the mid-50s, Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD, where if you launch a nuclear attack, we launch.
[00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:30.839]  And then we didn't have a nuclear war.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.621]  Here comes the neocons and the neolibs.
[00:13:34.641 --> 00:13:36.502]  None of them have ever been in the military.
[00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:39.904]  They're just all a bunch of delusional, crazy warmongers.
[00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:42.546]  I mean, Napoleon was a top general genius.
[00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:44.687]  He attacked Russia, thought he could win and lost.
[00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:49.269]  Hitler was a pretty smart guy overall, though he was obviously mentally ill.
[00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.111]  But it was a military...
[00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:53.788]  Iron Cross First and Second Class.
[00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:55.448]  That's the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:56.809]  Iron Cross First Class.
[00:13:57.829 --> 00:14:00.350]  Was a corporal in the German military and had all these top generals.
[00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:01.511]  And he lost.
[00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:04.652]  So even generals end up miscalculating.
[00:14:04.932 --> 00:14:08.134]  We got a bunch of globalists and a bunch of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan bankers.
[00:14:08.894 --> 00:14:13.718]  That run the EU that want to eat up all these countries like Greece and Poland and Ukraine.
[00:14:14.059 --> 00:14:18.563]  And Russia says, no, you can't have our oil fields and our oil infrastructure we built the last hundred years.
[00:14:18.643 --> 00:14:19.083]  It's ours.
[00:14:19.343 --> 00:14:22.726]  You can't have a military base you've had for 500 years on the Black Sea.
[00:14:23.026 --> 00:14:26.149]  And so they've just sent in NATO-backed mercenaries to attack them.
[00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:27.931]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[00:14:32.274 --> 00:14:32.775]  It's crazy.
[00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.091]  Russian general demands preemptive nuclear strike doctrine against NATO.
[00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:46.193]  So they're saying, okay, six years ago you changed your doctrine, saying you can nuke us first.
[00:14:46.713 --> 00:14:49.634]  We want the doctrine changed and change our war plan to nuke you first.
[00:14:51.155 --> 00:15:06.060]  And as the former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Bush said here just last week, that means some kind of missile gets launched or they get a blip that's wrong, they will have a doctrine with the generals to go ahead and pull the trigger and launch a full-out nuclear war.
[00:15:10.188 --> 00:15:27.353]  And where are your glitterbug preachers teaching faith-based initiative, state-run media, clergy response team, state-run biblical doctrine, unbiblical doctrine, where are all you guys going to be when this happens?
[00:15:27.773 --> 00:15:33.915]  And you don't get the golden parachute, you don't get raptured out of here, up to the Enterprise.
[00:15:38.644 --> 00:15:40.825]  All you glitter bugs busy, you know, out there.
[00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:52.593]  And I'm speaking about the so-called Christians of this country, who aren't protesting the abortuaries, who aren't protesting the open borders, who aren't protesting all the tyranny and corruption.
[00:15:52.853 --> 00:16:01.458]  You just go hide in your churches and then secretly get government walking orders, marching orders, and spew garbage at your mindless flocks.
[00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:08.082]  You are literal devils, red devils in the pulpits, and you know it!
[00:16:10.276 --> 00:16:13.679]  Every time I see you, all of you, I want to throw up!
[00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:20.084]  You will lose everything because of your cowardice, and God does not know you.
[00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:20.905]  I just want to say that.
[00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:21.686]  It's obvious.
[00:16:22.787 --> 00:16:24.068]  Look at the fruits of what you do.
[00:16:24.308 --> 00:16:26.270]  Look at how the churches have turned this country over.
[00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:32.744]  And instead they'll just have street preachers obnoxiously screaming at people downtown.
[00:16:33.064 --> 00:16:42.506]  I was down on South Congress last night eating dinner, and there were these super obnoxious street preachers just screaming at people, walking out of restaurants at 8 o'clock at night like we were devil worshippers.
[00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:44.987]  Just totally turning everybody off.
[00:16:45.007 --> 00:16:47.467]  I mean, you can just see how the devil wrote this script.
[00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:49.028]  I'm sorry, let me move on here.
[00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:53.809]  Russian general demands preemptive nuclear strike doctrine against NATO.
[00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:57.150]  We're gonna get into that today.
[00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.230]  Pretty big deal.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.300]  Just can't believe it.
[00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.541]  Meanwhile, ISIS to the rescue.
[00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:08.502]  This is up on InfoWars.com, a Tony Cartolucci article from LandDestroyer.
[00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:14.244]  Amid NATO's failures in Ukraine, America's terrorist mercenaries threaten war with Russia.
[00:17:14.524 --> 00:17:16.145]  I would say the globalist mercenaries.
[00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:19.446]  But sure, I mean, the globals run our country, so you can say, I guess, America.
[00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:25.667]  And now they've put out press releases and announcements that they're going to be attacking Russia now.
[00:17:26.568 --> 00:17:27.508]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:17:30.678 --> 00:17:33.239]  ISIS is going to attack Russia now.
[00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.379]  They're not attacking the U.S.
[00:17:35.399 --> 00:17:39.980]  or Israel yet, though they've said they will hit America when they're done.
[00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:46.122]  And have had ISIS flags posted outside the White House and at public events.
[00:17:46.702 --> 00:17:50.823]  And clearly, folks, there are ISIS sympathizers in this country.
[00:17:52.170 --> 00:18:12.538]  Shia Islam is 80% and a good 15% of that, so we're talking around 10% of total Islam, is Wahhabist absolute demon creatures who are murdering Muslims everywhere that dare let their girls go to school or don't make them wear bags over their heads or don't make them, you know, be sexually mutilated.
[00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:18.921]  And this is Saudi Arabia's group taking over the world and now they've announced they're going to attack Russia.
[00:18:26.232 --> 00:18:27.154]  You can go read the quotes.
[00:18:27.414 --> 00:18:28.195]  So, there you go.
[00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:31.039]  I mean, look at who we're aligned with on every front.
[00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:35.085]  ISIS attacking Syria.
[00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:36.347]  ISIS attacking Russia.
[00:18:38.015 --> 00:18:38.876]  Truly disgusting.
[00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:46.503]  And speaking of ISIS, when we come back from break, the video is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:46.903 --> 00:18:50.626]  Cinematically, it's probably one of the best produced videos we've ever put out.
[00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:59.494]  It just gives you a little flavor of what you're going to be seeing across the board from here on out in filmmaking, you name it, as we gear up and get more filmmakers, more editors, and more crew.
[00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:01.136]  Thanks to all your support out there.
[00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:07.199]  Spreading the word about the broadcast, buying the high quality products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:13.122]  97% of it goes right back into this operation to battle the globalists toe-to-toe.
[00:19:14.963 --> 00:19:23.748]  And you can go to the site, man crosses US border dressed as ISIS terrorist, simulates beheading.
[00:19:25.489 --> 00:19:27.771]  Now, James O'Keefe did this about a month ago.
[00:19:29.292 --> 00:19:30.413]  Dresses of Osama Bin Laden.
[00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:42.380]  We went down to El Paso, literally a mile from the city, about two miles from downtown, by a park with Juarez right across the 30-foot river that's about a foot deep.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.362]  We have video of Joe Biggs walking across.
[00:19:44.722 --> 00:19:51.706]  Dresses a jihadi with the big ISIS, brilliant Al Qaeda flag, and with a sword with a severed head.
[00:19:52.247 --> 00:19:55.148]  Simulated, you know, plastic, rubber, simulated cut-off head.
[00:19:56.349 --> 00:19:59.131]  Just to illustrate, our border is wide open.
[00:19:59.912 --> 00:20:03.555]  And not out in the middle of nowhere in Arizona, right here in Texas.
[00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:08.139]  And we got a border sheriff saying the feds have told him and confirmed ISIS is preparing to attack.
[00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:11.596]  The human body is extraordinary.
[00:20:11.936 --> 00:20:15.918]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:21.140]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon heart and body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[00:21:13.027 --> 00:21:18.250]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.872]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:27.685]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:29.667]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:33.150]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:21:33.451 --> 00:21:34.652]  Children left with no home.
[00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:36.013]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:21:36.514 --> 00:21:39.357]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:21:39.557 --> 00:21:40.517]  It's time to prepare!
[00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.872]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[00:22:11.472 --> 00:22:14.734]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[00:23:08.183 --> 00:23:10.764]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:14.825]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[00:23:15.385 --> 00:23:18.146]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:23:18.426 --> 00:23:19.626]  Chaos on our border.
[00:23:20.047 --> 00:23:22.087]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.128]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:27.129]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.
[00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:30.690]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.

[00:23:37.952 --> 00:23:47.216]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:47.256 --> 00:23:47.996]  This capitalism?
[00:23:48.056 --> 00:23:54.179]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:54.219 --> 00:23:57.861]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:58.841]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:58.861 --> 00:24:00.202]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:24:00.562 --> 00:24:00.842]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:16.792 --> 00:24:18.414]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:20.557 --> 00:24:24.623]  We've got very important economic news, Second Amendment news, and more.
[00:24:25.845 --> 00:24:26.726]  Scientific news.
[00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:29.216]  Coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:35.438]  I want to be very clear concerning the stunt we've pulled down on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:24:36.659 --> 00:24:46.784]  In the most populous city on the border, El Paso, in between Juarez and Mexico, is being done to draw attention to the fact the border is wide open.
[00:24:47.764 --> 00:24:55.528]  And last Friday, Homeland Security issued what they said is the most credible threat since 9-11 of an imminent ISIS terror attack.
[00:24:57.722 --> 00:25:02.624]  On the Texas border targeting El Paso on or before 9-11.
[00:25:03.324 --> 00:25:05.065]  Now six days away.
[00:25:06.165 --> 00:25:07.746]  Now that's newsworthy to go cover.
[00:25:08.806 --> 00:25:24.772]  And we're there getting people to pay attention by showing that someone even dressed up like an ISIS jihadi with a severed head and a three-foot sword can walk right across in the United States while 11 passenger jets have been seized by Al Qaeda.
[00:25:25.172 --> 00:25:25.953]  That's what they're called.
[00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:26.933]  IS is Al Qaeda.
[00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:33.433]  Our government got embarrassed funding them, and creating them, and pushing them, and so they changed the name to IS.
[00:25:34.293 --> 00:25:35.754]  They're now attacking Russia as well.
[00:25:37.115 --> 00:25:45.299]  And so Joe Biggs and Josh Owens went down there, Josh put this piece together last night, they both did a great job, to bring attention to our open border.
[00:25:45.639 --> 00:25:51.923]  So that if there is an attack, the government gets the blame, Obama gets the blame, whether it's false flag or real, or they let it happen.
[00:25:52.603 --> 00:25:54.824]  The point is, we're drawing attention to this.
[00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:56.385]  Here is the report.
[00:25:56.686 --> 00:25:58.767]  See the video at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:59.047 --> 00:26:00.508]  Please send it out on Facebook, Twitter.
[00:26:00.528 --> 00:26:02.109]  Get it to your friends and family.
[00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:07.492]  If the mainstream media picks this up, alternative media picks this up, it could really draw some attention to what's happening.
[00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.714]  And stop a false flag or real attack.
[00:26:09.754 --> 00:26:10.154]  Here it is.
[00:26:11.975 --> 00:26:15.297]  And again, Texas Sheriff says ISIS cells are operating in Juarez, Mexico.
[00:26:15.337 --> 00:26:16.338]  And he's ready for them.
[00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:18.199]  He got that in a federal briefing.
[00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:19.720]  That's confirmed.
[00:26:20.874 --> 00:26:23.335]  Understand that's big two news.
[00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:24.635]  What is that, NBC?
[00:26:29.697 --> 00:26:41.302]  The feds have issued a terror alert and believe an attack by the terrorist group ISIS is imminent on or before September 11th, the 13th anniversary of the worst attack on American soil.
[00:26:41.702 --> 00:26:47.004]  InfoWars investigates just miles from the center of El Paso, Texas, where we were able
[00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:47.805]  We're good to go.
[00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:20.112]  We know our government has created and funded ISIS, so whether or not this is a real threat or a false flag, the globalists are now one step closer to their endgame, stripping us of all our liberties.
[00:27:20.592 --> 00:27:29.096]  So we dress up like an ISIS jihadi to be as obvious as possible, to show and to illustrate just how wide open the border really is.
[00:27:33.254 --> 00:27:38.377]  All right, narrating the video, we show the Rio Grande near a city park in El Paso.
[00:27:38.837 --> 00:27:40.278]  Juarez right across the border.
[00:27:40.758 --> 00:27:45.020]  Joe Big simulates murdering someone, chopping their head off with a three-foot sword.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:55.025]  He lifts the ISIS flag and the severed head, loiters, and then begins walking across the Rio Grande that's only about a foot deep at that point.
[00:27:57.102 --> 00:27:58.223]  Right into the United States.
[00:27:59.164 --> 00:28:03.528]  And all day there are people milling back and forth there on that area of the border.
[00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.392]  We have video of the border sign right there.
[00:28:07.913 --> 00:28:10.095]  The Mexican flag flies right across the water there.
[00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:11.356]  It's a landmark.
[00:28:12.597 --> 00:28:13.798]  Right there by the border crossing.
[00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:16.681]  Border Patrol only a mile away, or less.
[00:28:18.383 --> 00:28:19.464]  And no one stops him.
[00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:28.133]  Thank you, Obama, for leaving your southern borders open so ISIS can terrorize America.
[00:28:28.153 --> 00:28:31.257]  ISIS thanks you, President Obama.
[00:28:32.038 --> 00:28:34.723]  We claim this land for Sharia law.
[00:28:37.188 --> 00:28:40.069]  If ISIS can enter the United States, then anyone can.
[00:28:40.629 --> 00:28:42.490]  So why are there checkpoints on the highways?
[00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:49.473]  Why are there checkpoints checking babies' diapers with the TSA while illegals are allowed to fly without having ID?
[00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:52.914]  Because, my friends, it's all a giant hoax.
[00:28:53.334 --> 00:29:04.299]  Whether they're real ISIS attacks or the globalist stage an attack, it'll all be used to take all of our freedoms in this country and grow the military-industrial complex takeover domestically.
[00:29:05.387 --> 00:29:11.949]  Which isn't good for veterans, citizens, black, white, Christian, old, young, Muslim, Hispanic.
[00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:13.850]  It doesn't matter who you are.
[00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.371]  This global empire is not even an American empire.
[00:29:17.391 --> 00:29:23.633]  It's a mega offshore banking empire using our muscle to establish a planetary regime.
[00:29:27.534 --> 00:29:31.315]  Up on Infowars.com, we have
[00:29:32.597 --> 00:29:41.082]  Sergei Tanikin, quote, we first fought in the name of religion, then communism, to fight communism, and now in the name of drugs and terrorism.
[00:29:41.622 --> 00:29:44.704]  Our excuses for global domination always change.
[00:29:45.044 --> 00:29:45.724]  See the graphic.
[00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:47.625]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:49.446]  Prisonplanet.com.
[00:29:49.927 --> 00:29:52.408]  Masses of key intel and news straight ahead.
[00:29:52.688 --> 00:29:57.671]  This is an incredible time to be alive, and we're here as your wartime broadcasters.
[00:29:58.581 --> 00:30:01.603]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.503 --> 00:30:09.668]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.688 --> 00:30:15.571]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:15.771 --> 00:30:19.974]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:24.917]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:25.317 --> 00:30:27.919]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:33.421]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:33.682 --> 00:30:40.565]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:41.066 --> 00:30:44.848]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:45.188 --> 00:30:49.990]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.171]  This is innovating.
[00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:58.753]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:58.933 --> 00:31:02.974]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:20.932]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[00:31:21.252 --> 00:31:29.238]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:30.659]  Open your eyes.
[00:31:30.979 --> 00:31:46.002]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:01.509]  Open your eyes.
[00:32:09.875 --> 00:32:13.376]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:17.497]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:19.278]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:19.598 --> 00:32:27.180]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:28.301]  But for how long?
[00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:34.843]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:35.243 --> 00:32:38.044]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:46.862]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[00:32:47.262 --> 00:32:54.585]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:22.867]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.476 --> 00:33:56.382]  I think I'm gonna let a little bit of, I think, my favorite Megadeth song with Dave Mustaine, a bunch of them are my favorites, play My Darkest Hour.
[00:33:57.163 --> 00:33:59.584]  Extremely powerful song.
[00:33:59.624 --> 00:34:12.072]  Of course he wrote this, I think in just a few minutes he said when he heard that the bus had jumped over in Europe killing one of the members of the group after he'd left it.
[00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:16.511]  Go ahead and crank it up.
[00:34:16.691 --> 00:34:18.652]  Let's say hi to Dave and everybody else out there listening.
[00:34:18.672 --> 00:34:20.052]  And we'll get into all the news.
[00:34:20.853 --> 00:34:24.575]  We've got some powerful information coming up in that segment.
[00:34:26.095 --> 00:34:32.218]  If you think the stunt was interesting that we pulled down there on the border, draw attention to the fact that it's wide open.
[00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:33.279]  Get ready.
[00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:35.120]  Let me let Dave have the floor.
[00:34:42.595 --> 00:34:45.957]  Think of all the Christians being beheaded in the Middle East right now.
[00:34:46.037 --> 00:34:48.658]  From Libya to Iraq to Syria.
[00:34:49.579 --> 00:34:51.400]  No, you weren't there.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.582]  In the darkest hour!
[00:34:58.704 --> 00:35:05.507]  Because they begged for help.
[00:35:06.268 --> 00:35:08.089]  No one cares for me.
[00:35:13.902 --> 00:35:14.662]  You ever think about that?
[00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:23.785]  Our government's run by people that funded a group to take over the Middle East who murder every Christian and secular police officer they get their hands on.
[00:35:23.985 --> 00:35:24.506]  Crank it up!
[00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:25.546]  Here it is!
[00:35:26.426 --> 00:35:27.647]  Here's the message to Obama!
[00:35:42.017 --> 00:35:43.838]  Now I know it was you!
[00:36:26.515 --> 00:36:38.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:36:38.522 --> 00:36:39.682]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:36:40.743 --> 00:36:41.824]  Telling it like it is.
[00:36:42.424 --> 00:36:43.765]  Exposing the hard truths.
[00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:45.346]  Because it's the only hope we've got.
[00:36:45.966 --> 00:36:48.648]  As a nation and as a world to face reality.
[00:36:49.688 --> 00:36:50.769]  Expose the lies.
[00:36:51.229 --> 00:36:52.110]  Embrace the truth.
[00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.091]  And head our knees to Jesus Christ.
[00:36:58.667 --> 00:37:02.328]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:14.733]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, we have something very powerful we're going to premiere here that will again draw attention to the fact that our borders are completely wide open as part of a North American Union deal.
[00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.355]  You've seen all these top generals, all these leaders say that's the plan.
[00:37:19.295 --> 00:37:29.338]  We're drawing attention to it and this video will go live on YouTube simultaneously and will go up on InfoWars.com in the next segment.
[00:37:29.618 --> 00:37:30.718]  Buckley, are you ready to do that?
[00:37:31.479 --> 00:37:32.419]  And I'll give you the headline.
[00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:41.442]  But let's just be ready to launch and have it go up on InfoWars.com for all the radio listeners so they can go see it at the start of the next segment.
[00:37:41.862 --> 00:37:43.402]  PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:37:43.742 --> 00:37:45.883]  We'll tweet it out at RealAlexJones.
[00:37:46.723 --> 00:37:48.564]  Then filmmaker Joel Gilbert joins us.
[00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:50.186]  And more.
[00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:52.889]  William Benny, former top NSA whistleblower.
[00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:54.331]  And more.
[00:37:56.633 --> 00:37:58.736]  But if you just joined us, man crosses U.S.
[00:37:58.796 --> 00:38:02.760]  border dressed as ISIS terrorist, simulates beheading.
[00:38:03.401 --> 00:38:09.809]  Stunt took place in exact spot where feds say ISIS terror attack is imminent.
[00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:19.359]  Meanwhile, Minneapolis City Council demands answers on black helicopter military drills.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.421]  Close quote.
[00:38:20.961 --> 00:38:22.983]  I thought the black helicopters didn't exist.
[00:38:25.225 --> 00:38:27.968]  It's all part of a desensitization program for martial law.
[00:38:28.008 --> 00:38:29.109]  That's declassified.
[00:38:32.513 --> 00:38:35.996]  When can the FBI use national security letters to go after journalists?
[00:38:36.436 --> 00:38:37.417]  That's classified.
[00:38:38.336 --> 00:38:40.037]  That's from the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
[00:38:40.777 --> 00:38:41.917]  The targeting of the press.
[00:38:42.618 --> 00:38:46.519]  Soros signals Argentina's shale is biggest place to be.
[00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:56.003]  Soros doubled its stake in state-owned oil company in Argentina, while for the last seven years spending tens of millions of dollars to lobby to shut down shale
[00:38:56.883 --> 00:38:58.084]  Production in the U.S.
[00:38:58.144 --> 00:38:59.925]  by wildcat small companies.
[00:39:00.265 --> 00:39:04.427]  And I'm not saying shale fracking is good overall.
[00:39:04.867 --> 00:39:11.330]  I'm not saying there aren't problems, but most of it's financed by Soros and Saudi Arabia, who don't want us to have our own oil.
[00:39:12.591 --> 00:39:18.094]  So a coal plant in Mexico that's totally dirty is okay, but a coal plant in Texas that's clean is not okay.
[00:39:18.294 --> 00:39:21.696]  Because it's not owned by General Electric.
[00:39:22.788 --> 00:39:30.310]  So, a cleaner fracking system, say in East Texas, I got a family that are petroleum geologists, as long as it's done right, there's literally no problems.
[00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:37.211]  That's not okay, but a dirty one in Argentina is okay, because see, that's how you make money if you're George Soros and Warren Buffett.
[00:39:37.611 --> 00:39:44.493]  You don't let the Keystone Pipeline come in, and then the oil of Canada has to be shipped out to the West Coast and to China on record.
[00:39:46.138 --> 00:39:50.741]  See, that's how big fortunes are made in the mafia system, is gaming everything.
[00:39:50.881 --> 00:39:53.582]  Just thought I'd tell you how things really work, just in case everybody wanted to know.
[00:39:55.683 --> 00:40:00.066]  That's all George Soros and Warren Buffett, the two work together, do.
[00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:01.687]  They just run around continually.
[00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:05.189]  They'll lobby to get laws passed.
[00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:20.269]  That you can't have arsenic at, you know, one part per billion in the water, which shouldn't even hurt you, but then all those other toxins can be added, just so then they have a patented system and then make cities buy their multi-billion dollar water cleaning thing to cut out the arsenic.
[00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:21.850]  It's all a big game to them.
[00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:28.332]  And on the other end of it, dump fluoride with hundreds of other chemicals into the water after it's been purified.
[00:40:28.512 --> 00:40:30.033]  It's all part of sick jokes to them.
[00:40:30.733 --> 00:40:34.355]  I mean, there's no end to what they do to us, no end to the scams they pull.
[00:40:34.395 --> 00:40:35.375]  They absolutely love it.
[00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.071]  Look at this headline.
[00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:44.334]  Do you receive free lunch at work?
[00:40:45.735 --> 00:40:47.376]  The IRS wants to tax it.
[00:40:47.557 --> 00:40:50.599]  That's right, a couple times a month I end up buying the whole office food.
[00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:56.905]  We get Mexican food, we get barbecue, we get vegetarian stuff sometimes.
[00:40:57.365 --> 00:40:57.946]  Runs the gamut.
[00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:15.605]  And even though I pay taxes on that as a company, and even though I pay all these regulatory fines and fees on every level, and we pay to drive over there with the gas we use and sales tax, the IRS wants to surveil everything you do.
[00:41:15.965 --> 00:41:22.348]  There are few agencies more hated, corrupt, and degraded in the entire nation, and that's saying a lot.
[00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:26.010]  And it's a Michael Krieger article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:27.714 --> 00:41:33.178]  And it goes into how they want to tax your lunch now at work if it's given to you.
[00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:40.703]  Another article up on InfoWars.com from yesterday's interview, and the video from yesterday's interview with Rappaport is posted there.
[00:41:41.043 --> 00:41:49.569]  Very important to get this out to people and break the blockade in dinosaur media, state-run media, that a top, recently retired
[00:41:51.298 --> 00:42:02.027]  A CDC scientist who co-authored the big study says it's a fraud that they know vaccines are linked directly to massive increases in autism, a triple-fold in their study in boys.
[00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:06.431]  Because the blood-brain barrier is not as strong on boys as it is on girls.
[00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:10.855]  Now, they were ordered to put out a fake study.
[00:42:12.793 --> 00:42:21.338]  And we even have the 2000 document that came out in 2004 when it was the roundtable meeting, a board meeting of the CDC with all the scientists.
[00:42:21.618 --> 00:42:22.239]  This was on ABC News.
[00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:24.300]  You can look it up.
[00:42:25.141 --> 00:42:27.362]  And they said, oh my God, this was leaked.
[00:42:27.402 --> 00:42:28.863]  And this actually made it mainstream news.
[00:42:28.883 --> 00:42:30.564]  It was devastating for the globalists.
[00:42:31.585 --> 00:42:36.267]  And they literally were in there saying, oh my gosh, you know, don't give this to your grandkids.
[00:42:36.308 --> 00:42:38.509]  I'm going to tell my daughter, don't give it to my grandson.
[00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.251]  Millions have been harmed by this.
[00:42:42.604 --> 00:42:44.686]  The whole government will fall if this is known.
[00:42:44.706 --> 00:42:48.888]  In fact, I'm going to do a report.
[00:42:48.928 --> 00:43:00.216]  I want to have my research crew re-pull the 2004 ABC News, CDC News, get the exact headline of something like, in fact, you guys probably pull it up right now.
[00:43:00.236 --> 00:43:01.357]  Let me think of the exact headline.
[00:43:01.377 --> 00:43:02.618]  I'm going to do the Shesh Day.
[00:43:02.738 --> 00:43:04.379]  I'm just going to my archive here.
[00:43:06.781 --> 00:43:08.802]  My Own Little Brain was the exact headline.
[00:43:12.429 --> 00:43:17.032]  CDC knew vaccines were causing autism.
[00:43:18.353 --> 00:43:22.736]  CDC board knew Vaccine Autism Link ordered cover-up.
[00:43:25.257 --> 00:43:33.342]  And you read the transcript that was released of the meeting that the secretary was there topping down, taking dictation.
[00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:39.626]  And then you understand that was 10 years ago.
[00:43:39.646 --> 00:43:40.367]  Well, actually,
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.240]  Fourteen years ago, but ten years ago it came out.
[00:43:44.861 --> 00:43:45.981]  No one's gotten in trouble.
[00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:46.981]  They haven't stopped.
[00:43:47.021 --> 00:43:49.801]  They've added more vaccines they claim are compulsory, which aren't.
[00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:51.482]  Another lie, another hoax, another fraud.
[00:43:53.662 --> 00:43:55.502]  And they're now trying to make them mandatory.
[00:43:57.503 --> 00:43:59.123]  And now they push them on pregnant women.
[00:43:59.183 --> 00:44:02.364]  The inserts still say don't give any vaccines to a pregnant woman.
[00:44:02.764 --> 00:44:10.025]  But then, instead of admitting they're killing everybody or maiming people, they just go, oh, there's no side effects, save and effective, give it to pregnant women.
[00:44:11.417 --> 00:44:21.221]  In fact, in 2009, with the whole H1N1 hoax, I remember on the news saying, you know, pregnant women ought to take two flu shots.
[00:44:24.922 --> 00:44:27.083]  Yeah, because you need one of those like a hole in the head.
[00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.931]  Do you have any idea what that does to a pregnant woman?
[00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:33.953]  We've had medical doctors on the nightmares that it causes.
[00:44:34.313 --> 00:44:48.442]  They know, any nurse, any doctor listening, who graduated, you know, 10, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, and not 5 years ago, knows, yes, you never give pregnant women shots, but all the new ones go, no, you give extra.
[00:44:49.457 --> 00:44:50.978]  I mean, what a cult, man!
[00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:52.460]  State-run medicine.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.761]  State-run media.
[00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:55.162]  State-run churches.
[00:44:55.562 --> 00:44:56.843]  State-run education.
[00:44:57.223 --> 00:44:58.024]  State-run.
[00:44:58.264 --> 00:44:59.205]  And who runs the state?
[00:44:59.265 --> 00:45:00.266]  The big megabanks.
[00:45:00.766 --> 00:45:02.368]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:45:03.148 --> 00:45:04.529]  The Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:06.691]  The Annenberg CPB Foundation.
[00:45:08.132 --> 00:45:09.233]  The Carnegie Endowment.
[00:45:11.755 --> 00:45:12.836]  And what are their goals?
[00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:14.297]  Go read their public goals.
[00:45:14.417 --> 00:45:17.300]  Worldwide planetary government forced population reduction.
[00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.473]  So we need to get this bombshell article out to everybody.
[00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:24.734]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:24.774 --> 00:45:26.095]  I mean, you should print it off.
[00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:30.960]  You should send it to your friends and family that have kids, or your daughter, or your son who's having a kid, their family.
[00:45:31.481 --> 00:45:33.663]  I mean, I see pregnant women in an elevator.
[00:45:34.023 --> 00:45:36.205]  I see pregnant women at a grocery store.
[00:45:36.305 --> 00:45:37.527]  I see pregnant women at the park.
[00:45:37.867 --> 00:45:38.708]  I see pregnant women anywhere.
[00:45:38.728 --> 00:45:40.349]  I walk over and I go, hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.735]  You know, I cover media and news, and a lot of times they go, I know who you are.
[00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:51.087]  I'll say, okay, well, just want to let you know, I interview a lot of medical experts, and I just got to tell you, please investigate the inserts of the vaccines.
[00:45:51.928 --> 00:45:54.312]  Because they're going to tell you it's safe and effective, no side effects.
[00:45:55.802 --> 00:46:05.984]  Get the insert, read it, it'll say narcolepsy, epilepsy, cancer, death, heart attacks, brain embolisms, autoimmune disorders, Guillain-Barre.
[00:46:06.505 --> 00:46:09.405]  Don't believe me, ask for the insert.
[00:46:09.465 --> 00:46:10.706]  Now, people are doing that now.
[00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:14.106]  They'll give you a one-sheet printout, frequently asked questions.
[00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:14.767]  You don't want that.
[00:46:15.027 --> 00:46:16.347]  You want the drug insert.
[00:46:17.369 --> 00:46:22.011]  And a lot of times they go, no, my husband and, or my mom's already saying, look at that, I already knew that, but thank you.
[00:46:22.031 --> 00:46:30.596]  A lot of them say, yeah, I've been, I know there's some problems, but you know, I'm worried on the other side, like what will they, I go, listen, just read the insert.
[00:46:33.037 --> 00:46:34.738]  And sometimes they'll start arguing.
[00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:38.220]  I'll say, listen, I just got a responsibility to tell you, I'm not going to apologize.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:38.760]  I love you.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.661]  I do it in restaurants.
[00:46:42.247 --> 00:46:44.828]  My kids don't even say, oh, Dad, anymore.
[00:46:44.848 --> 00:46:45.908]  They don't even get embarrassed anymore.
[00:46:46.228 --> 00:46:47.949]  I'll be in a Mexican food restaurant or wherever.
[00:46:48.289 --> 00:46:52.890]  Last time, a few weeks ago, I was, and there was a lady in there, pregnant, but her husband's already had another kid.
[00:46:53.831 --> 00:46:55.851]  And I went over and I said, what a great family you got here.
[00:46:56.571 --> 00:46:59.192]  Because that's a, and I'd spent a minute or two.
[00:46:59.552 --> 00:47:00.412]  They ended up thanking me.
[00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:02.673]  But I'm not in people's business, folks.
[00:47:02.773 --> 00:47:06.094]  It's my business and your business that they don't get to hurt these kids.
[00:47:07.655 --> 00:47:09.395]  It's normal to be informed.
[00:47:09.755 --> 00:47:11.836]  It's normal to be involved in a free society.
[00:47:24.266 --> 00:47:31.473]  I don't know how people don't have an absolute total drive to want to warn everybody they know about what's happening.
[00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:37.078]  We're all in this together, folks, and society is degenerating by design.
[00:47:37.639 --> 00:47:41.562]  Every major defense department, the British, the US, says total collapse is coming.
[00:47:42.323 --> 00:47:49.510]  We've shown you the Ministry of Defense reports, the Pentagon reports, the Rand Corporation reports, Secretary of Defense Hagel said the whole world is blowing up.
[00:47:51.169 --> 00:47:51.889]  And here's the deal.
[00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:57.652]  Under Agenda 21, Cloward and Piven type mindset, that's the plan.
[00:47:59.853 --> 00:48:11.677]  Because the globalists have exempted themselves from everything, indemnified themselves with diplomatic and corporate immunity, and administrative law courts, transferred the power to international unelected boards.
[00:48:11.997 --> 00:48:15.079]  We're already in a global government right now, in their own words.
[00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:25.854]  And the global government is basically run by people that are archetypal Carl Jung totem poles of evil.
[00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:45.568]  And by that, they are a hierarchical system that has sold out to the dark side for temporal power on terra firma, on this flying rock that has a thin skin of life on its surface.
[00:48:48.510 --> 00:49:05.555]  We live on a planet with flying fish, hundreds of species of parrots, an atmosphere, mountains, stars all around us, and meanwhile we have evil globalists running things to the ground, trying to shutter our consciousness, shutter our perception, so they can play God and dominate us.
[00:49:05.835 --> 00:49:13.117]  You people aren't even one one trillionth of even understanding the face of God, if you don't want to empower humanity.
[00:49:14.093 --> 00:49:23.880]  And if you want to butcher creation and engage in wild, mad scientist experiments on your lustful power trip.
[00:49:27.402 --> 00:49:28.403]  This came out last week.
[00:49:28.443 --> 00:49:30.465]  There's more info this week confirming it.
[00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:33.387]  Brain-to-brain telepathic communication achieved for first time.
[00:49:34.948 --> 00:49:37.910]  Team of US-led... How about documented for the first time?
[00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:38.710]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:40.332 --> 00:49:40.712]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:42.711 --> 00:49:44.492]  Yes, science did it, you know, right.
[00:49:44.952 --> 00:49:51.977]  Team of U.S.-led researchers successfully achieved brain-to-brain communication between humans from India to France with brains controlling the instruments.
[00:49:52.497 --> 00:50:01.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's been scientifically proven, major university studies, you can look them up, that you can tell when somebody's looking at you.
[00:50:03.103 --> 00:50:11.188]  How many times have you been walking through the woods on your own property, if you've got property, and somebody's poaching, you feel them looking at you, and you walk 200 yards through the woods and find them in a tree stand staring right at you?
[00:50:11.943 --> 00:50:16.604]  Or how many times you've been sitting there in a restaurant and feel somebody looking at you, and you turn around and they're looking at you and their eyes are right on you.
[00:50:17.084 --> 00:50:30.888]  Everybody knows that there is some type of electromagnetic, whatever you want to call it, it's been proven that birds and bats and insects know how to fly thousands of miles, monarch butterflies, off of magnetic cells in their brains.
[00:50:32.694 --> 00:50:34.096]  Humans have these as well.
[00:50:34.856 --> 00:50:36.338]  That's what we navigate off of.
[00:50:36.558 --> 00:50:38.461]  That's what, again, ducks navigate off of.
[00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:42.805]  It has something to do with that at the science level, but it's even deeper.
[00:50:43.146 --> 00:50:45.428]  But I love how science, so-called science,
[00:50:46.474 --> 00:50:48.596]  Acts like they've done it for the first time.
[00:50:49.077 --> 00:50:58.747]  No, just because you did brain-to-brain communication and believe you've proven it for the first time does not mean it's been done for the first time.
[00:50:59.628 --> 00:51:03.211]  There are a lot of things going on in heaven and earth that aren't in your books.
[00:51:04.332 --> 00:51:05.053]  Shakespeare wrote.
[00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:07.356]  We all know it.
[00:51:07.376 --> 00:51:08.437]  It's written on our heart.

[00:51:36.131 --> 00:51:40.295]  Our big story.
[00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:45.439]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[00:51:45.559 --> 00:51:48.441]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[00:51:48.661 --> 00:51:51.202]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.
[00:51:51.462 --> 00:51:58.164]  Staffed with formal special operations personnel, GunMagWarehouse.com is the only company that specializes in gun magazines.

[00:52:08.604 --> 00:52:11.166]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.426 --> 00:52:16.290]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:24.436]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.677 --> 00:52:28.980]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.003]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.163 --> 00:52:38.864]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.104 --> 00:52:41.885]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.265 --> 00:52:47.486]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:55.748]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:53:08.366 --> 00:53:11.348]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:53:11.448 --> 00:53:13.069]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:53:13.249 --> 00:53:15.371]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:53:15.691 --> 00:53:17.052]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:53:17.312 --> 00:53:21.395]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[00:53:21.655 --> 00:53:23.596]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[00:53:23.836 --> 00:53:26.898]  We offer the most affordable Level 3 body armor on the market.

[00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.310]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:54:23.891 --> 00:54:26.051]  About to end the first hour.
[00:54:26.391 --> 00:54:30.772]  A bunch of very informative guests coming up in the second.
[00:54:32.313 --> 00:54:34.573]  Speaking of the second hour, a lot of key Second Amendment news.
[00:54:37.074 --> 00:54:39.955]  Under Obama, only the rich 10% saw incomes rise.
[00:54:41.209 --> 00:54:44.872]  NASA says asteroids will pass, quote, very close to the Earth on Sunday.
[00:54:44.912 --> 00:54:45.833]  That's all coming up.
[00:54:46.634 --> 00:55:01.207]  We're being sent by listeners from Houston and Milwaukee and you name it, photos of people at coffee shops and delis and at parks wearing ISIS t-shirts, wearing ISIS badges.
[00:55:03.314 --> 00:55:05.095]  And I'm seeing them on a lot of leftist sites.
[00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:07.778]  We saw ISIS signs show up in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:55:08.218 --> 00:55:09.519]  We've seen them show up at the White House.
[00:55:09.979 --> 00:55:11.300]  It's the new Che Guevara.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:19.667]  So we're going to have an article later explaining how the new Che Guevara is ISIS patches, ISIS flags, is the new Vogue.
[00:55:22.189 --> 00:55:26.833]  And this is a real, this is the majority Islam group, a subsection of that.
[00:55:28.277 --> 00:55:33.221]  That is just seen as incredibly cool in many areas of the Middle East and here in the United States.
[00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:35.222]  So if you want to know who's radical, that's who.
[00:55:35.382 --> 00:55:37.324]  They're letting ISIS members fly back to the U.S.
[00:55:37.344 --> 00:55:38.545]  That's mainstream news yesterday.
[00:55:39.105 --> 00:55:43.968]  England quote, re-educates them in a two week long course a few nights a week.
[00:55:44.369 --> 00:55:50.553]  Oh, you're allowed to go jihadi and cut heads off, but since the West wants you to do that, you know, and overthrow countries, then you get to come back.
[00:55:51.054 --> 00:55:52.375]  So they work for our government.
[00:55:53.052 --> 00:55:54.153]  The criminals that run our government.
[00:55:54.473 --> 00:55:55.514]  Our border's wide open.
[00:55:55.814 --> 00:55:56.915]  They gave them oil fields.
[00:55:56.955 --> 00:55:58.196]  They didn't bomb them early on.
[00:55:58.556 --> 00:56:00.398]  They've done staged bombing to divert the public.
[00:56:00.438 --> 00:56:01.699]  It's really Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:56:02.139 --> 00:56:04.381]  It's ISIS that's taken over in Syria and other areas.
[00:56:05.722 --> 00:56:10.385]  This is the group Rand Paul last year said don't arm them and don't bomb Assad for these people.
[00:56:10.445 --> 00:56:13.548]  Now he says we gotta bomb ISIS because they're taking over and I agree with him.
[00:56:13.968 --> 00:56:18.111]  The problem is it won't be real bombing or they'll end up bombing, you know, Egypt or something.
[00:56:18.692 --> 00:56:19.772]  ISIS attacks America?
[00:56:19.952 --> 00:56:21.073]  We'll probably attack Egypt.
[00:56:21.193 --> 00:56:21.734]  I'm not kidding.
[00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:29.961]  So here is the Obama ISIS Ice Bucket Challenge.
[00:56:30.441 --> 00:56:33.402]  The video's going up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:56:33.862 --> 00:56:36.263]  It'll be tweeted out during the next break at Real Alex Jones.
[00:56:36.523 --> 00:56:37.304]  Please retweet it.
[00:56:37.804 --> 00:56:52.951]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, who put together the video with our great video editor and cameraman Josh Owens yesterday, of him coming across at the El Paso border crossing, literally just right there in the city at the park, dressed up like an ISIS person, cutting off a head.
[00:56:54.901 --> 00:56:55.442]  And then meanwhile...
[00:57:10.523 --> 00:57:25.887]  They've got TSA checkpoints, and highway checkpoints, and NSA surveillance of the Tea Party, and the IRS harassing the Tea Party, and Homeland Security says the number one terror threat is returning veterans, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, libertarians, and the Founding Fathers aren't welcome, wouldn't be welcome in today's military.
[00:57:25.927 --> 00:57:26.827]  That's mainstream news.
[00:57:27.207 --> 00:57:29.047]  That's the briefings our troops are being given.
[00:57:29.268 --> 00:57:33.148]  That's the treason, the overthrow of the American system that's going on.
[00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:36.529]  The whole Homeland Security system is pointed at the American people.
[00:57:37.469 --> 00:57:38.770]  Here is the new
[00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:42.353]  ISIS bucket Obama challenge.
[00:57:42.413 --> 00:57:42.954]  Here it is.
[00:57:45.337 --> 00:57:56.588]  Since you have made it so easy for the caliphate ISIS group to come into your country, I challenge you, President Barack Obama, to take the ISIS head bucket challenge.
[00:57:57.169 --> 00:58:00.893]  Do not listen to your conservative swine or your
[00:58:01.914 --> 00:58:03.095]  Patriotic groups?
[00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:04.355]  Your tea party?
[00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:05.656]  Ignore them!
[00:58:06.076 --> 00:58:11.558]  Leave the borders wide open for me and my brethren to come in and do psychotic things!
[00:58:12.078 --> 00:58:12.959]  You created us!
[00:58:13.679 --> 00:58:14.099]  Love us!
[00:58:14.539 --> 00:58:15.220]  Let us in!
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.381]  Let us go running around and killing and taking places over!
[00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:21.142]  That's why you made us, isn't it?
[00:58:21.742 --> 00:58:23.363]  I will take this bucket of heads!
[00:58:25.234 --> 00:58:26.154]  And dump it on me.
[00:58:26.174 --> 00:58:30.797]  This is the ISIS bucket challenge for President Barack Obama.
[00:58:31.297 --> 00:58:31.677]  Take it.
[00:58:33.958 --> 00:58:42.282]  All right, and if you're against it, you're racist, folks.
[00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:44.222]  There you go.
[00:58:44.303 --> 00:58:45.143]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:45.183 --> 00:58:48.585]  The video just went live at InfoWars.com, hour number two.
[00:58:48.905 --> 00:58:49.806]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:50.867]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:50.887 --> 00:58:52.508]  This is the InfoWars.
[00:58:53.008 --> 00:58:54.169]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.386 --> 00:59:05.492]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:59:05.512 --> 00:59:08.815]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:59:08.835 --> 00:59:10.536]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:59:10.576 --> 00:59:16.862]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spears.
[00:59:16.962 --> 00:59:22.847]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:59:23.007 --> 00:59:26.751]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:59:26.951 --> 00:59:29.874]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:59:29.894 --> 00:59:38.063]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:59:38.303 --> 00:59:40.366]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:59:40.406 --> 00:59:41.447]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:59:41.807 --> 00:59:50.551]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:53.192]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:59:53.412 --> 00:59:57.774]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:00:02.196 --> 01:00:04.136]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.597 --> 01:00:07.338]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:19.454]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.115 --> 01:00:20.916]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.697 --> 01:00:22.598]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.238 --> 01:00:26.862]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:31.487]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.429 --> 01:00:42.612]  Julia Turiansky joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:42.813 --> 01:00:49.599]  She's a very popular online liberty-based activist promoting Bitcoin and bringing down the private Federal Reserve.
[01:00:49.619 --> 01:00:52.883]  She'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour to spend a couple segments with us.
[01:00:52.903 --> 01:00:56.606]  She'll look back at Bilderberg that she covered with us as well this year.
[01:00:57.007 --> 01:00:58.969]  We have the award-winning filmmaker Joel Gilbert.
[01:00:59.529 --> 01:01:01.571]  His new film hits theaters this weekend.
[01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:08.497]  There's no place like Utopia, exposing what really happens in the economy under socialism and under globalism.
[01:01:09.138 --> 01:01:14.202]  And then we have William Benny for a full hour, and he'll take calls the second half of that hour.
[01:01:14.242 --> 01:01:19.267]  You can also send your questions, tweet your questions, at RealAlexJones, and we'll ask
[01:01:19.747 --> 01:01:20.948]  Some of those questions as well.
[01:01:21.088 --> 01:01:25.111]  We'll put out an official hashtag or however that works so they can print off the questions for me.
[01:01:25.531 --> 01:01:30.574]  And we can throw some of those at William Binney, top NSA whistleblower as well.
[01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:39.701]  We'll be joining us and taking your questions in both phone calls and again tweet questions in the third hour today.
[01:01:41.082 --> 01:01:42.423]  So that's all coming up.
[01:01:44.384 --> 01:01:47.066]  Now I want to just again illustrate how disinformation works.
[01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.358]  And even most politicians don't know this.
[01:01:50.779 --> 01:01:55.344]  Like, low-level politicians are just people that believe the system's baloney and parrot it.
[01:01:56.806 --> 01:01:58.848]  Mid-level and high-level know how things really work.
[01:01:59.489 --> 01:02:02.513]  Our job is to decompartmentalize and show everybody the overall rabbit trick.
[01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:07.279]  More Senate Democrats urge Obama to delay immigration order.
[01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:16.202]  Top Democrats are, in fact, more top Democrats are pressing President Barack Obama to slow down immigration reform.
[01:02:16.242 --> 01:02:17.763]  You mean totally wide open borders?
[01:02:19.554 --> 01:02:23.396]  Diminishing the chances that he will take sweeping administrative action before election day.
[01:02:24.076 --> 01:02:27.458]  Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat, Florida, wants Obama to wait until November.
[01:02:27.598 --> 01:02:32.701]  Senator Al Franken, what a joke, of Minnesota, said he has concerns about executive action.
[01:02:32.981 --> 01:02:34.382]  Well, it's totally illegal.
[01:02:35.202 --> 01:02:36.043]  It should be because of that.
[01:02:36.443 --> 01:02:42.066]  Senator Angus King, Independent of Maine, who caucused with Democrats, said it would be a mistake.
[01:02:42.586 --> 01:02:46.248]  They say wait until they've won the Senate election coming up.
[01:02:49.022 --> 01:02:50.783]  The Republican leadership wants this as well.
[01:02:50.863 --> 01:02:51.864]  They helped write this.
[01:02:51.884 --> 01:02:53.845]  This is just, this is the North American Union.
[01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:57.727]  It's the Indo-Canadian and Mexican sovereignty.
[01:02:58.507 --> 01:03:03.229]  And it's the poorest people coming up here, getting on welfare and further bankrupting things.
[01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:05.150]  And I don't dislike them individually.
[01:03:07.172 --> 01:03:12.634]  You know, I don't dislike water, as I've said, but if you're submerged under it, you'll drown.
[01:03:13.275 --> 01:03:17.197]  Or if it's being fired out of a water hose, the strip mine, you know, can cut you in half.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:30.507]  And it's just a giant flood of people who will then just be brainwashed into literal global bots, Obama bots, socialist bots, turning your gun bots, and that's what they're doing!
[01:03:31.772 --> 01:03:33.093]  And that's the plan, the Democrats.
[01:03:33.553 --> 01:03:44.060]  James O'Keefe got the video in the battleground Texas where they're in person after person going, ha ha, we're going to bring in all the illegals and vote and take all the guns and get you Texans.
[01:03:44.381 --> 01:03:49.624]  They don't care how many of you want to be pro-gun if you're a Texan who's black or Hispanic or white.
[01:03:50.245 --> 01:03:57.390]  They're going to bring in people to get a paycheck from the government and they're going to vote and they're going to send police and take your guns like New York and California.
[01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:58.230]  Done!
[01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.612]  They did it in California, they're going to do it here.
[01:04:02.363 --> 01:04:03.823]  They're going to take your private property.
[01:04:04.003 --> 01:04:05.244]  They're going to raise your taxes.
[01:04:05.464 --> 01:04:07.845]  They're not going to stop unless we stop them.
[01:04:10.205 --> 01:04:16.807]  That's why I get so animated now is because it's all breaking loose and it's just gotten started.
[01:04:18.728 --> 01:04:20.868]  It's just now beginning.
[01:04:20.888 --> 01:04:23.589]  Do you understand that?
[01:04:24.149 --> 01:04:25.410]  This is not a game.
[01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:26.490]  It's not a joke.
[01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:29.111]  It's real, real, real, real.
[01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:36.531]  And people, again, get obsessed about football and their team winning.
[01:04:36.591 --> 01:04:48.013]  I'm obsessed with not being totally chumped, totally punked, totally gamed, totally manipulated, and just watching the country destroyed by the globalists like they've done so many others.
[01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:50.154]  Like, I hate watching them overthrow Ukraine!
[01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:52.514]  I hate watching them overthrow Syria and Iraq!
[01:04:52.914 --> 01:04:54.455]  I hate watching them turn Al-Qaeda loose!
[01:04:54.555 --> 01:04:54.835]  I just...
[01:04:55.811 --> 01:04:58.593]  It's like watching people get mugged and killed and you can't do anything.
[01:04:58.874 --> 01:05:00.235]  And then I'm next, you're next.
[01:05:00.395 --> 01:05:00.675]  No!
[01:05:01.316 --> 01:05:01.656]  No!
[01:05:01.676 --> 01:05:05.479]  Good people gotta wake up, get together, and take the world back.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.601]  We'll be right back from break.
[01:05:09.415 --> 01:05:19.563]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:26.349]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:26.429 --> 01:05:28.671]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:28.771 --> 01:05:31.853]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[01:05:31.873 --> 01:05:38.739]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:42.790]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:46.912]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:47.212 --> 01:05:48.672]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:48.992 --> 01:05:56.575]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:56.855 --> 01:05:57.695]  But for how long?
[01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:04.258]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:04.638 --> 01:06:07.439]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.200]  In the near future.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.662]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:15.982 --> 01:06:17.022]  Security alert.
[01:06:17.202 --> 01:06:18.963]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:19.223 --> 01:06:22.904]  Analysis, info wars, building, independent media operations.
[01:06:22.924 --> 01:06:25.705]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:27.766]  We are the ones responsible.
[01:06:27.786 --> 01:06:30.146]  Prime Directive discredits Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.366 --> 01:06:33.147]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:33.227 --> 01:06:36.288]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:36.468 --> 01:06:38.689]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:38.769 --> 01:06:40.289]  These people are assaulting us!
[01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:42.610]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:44.812]  They're never going to stop.
[01:06:45.072 --> 01:06:48.676]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:48.776 --> 01:06:55.383]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:56.084 --> 01:06:59.247]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:59.267 --> 01:07:00.308]  You can feel it.
[01:07:08.632 --> 01:07:15.698]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:15.819 --> 01:07:17.980]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:23.265]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:28.390]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.671]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:31.911 --> 01:07:35.773]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:35.993 --> 01:07:40.235]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:40.315 --> 01:07:50.319]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:50.539 --> 01:07:53.060]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.741]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:56.761 --> 01:07:58.482]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:20.365 --> 01:08:26.128]  Everybody knows that I'm a libertarian constitutionalist who listens to this broadcast.
[01:08:27.248 --> 01:08:33.752]  When I was critical of Bush and the police state that the Democrats were part of with the Patriot Act, I said it would be targeted on the American people.
[01:08:34.572 --> 01:08:37.273]  I said it would be targeted on the libertarian movement.
[01:08:37.914 --> 01:08:44.237]  And now they admit, Homeland Security under Obama, its main focus is domestic, returning veterans, gun owners, you name it.
[01:08:46.314 --> 01:08:47.615]  I've not been an Islamophobe.
[01:08:47.715 --> 01:08:49.276]  I don't hate people that are Muslims.
[01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:52.478]  I went to college and high school with Muslim folks who were friends, nice people.
[01:08:52.878 --> 01:08:54.379]  I was against both Iraq wars.
[01:08:55.239 --> 01:08:59.862]  You don't have Saudi Arabia involved in 9-11 and then we attack Iraq.
[01:09:01.264 --> 01:09:03.406]  That said, ISIS is a real threat.
[01:09:03.586 --> 01:09:07.889]  ISIS has been funded by NATO and Obama in Libya, in Syria, in Iraq.
[01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:09.470]  That's all admitted now.
[01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:10.812]  They've been given Stinger missiles.
[01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:12.613]  That was what Benghazi was about.
[01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:14.294]  Colonel Schaeffer's on next week.
[01:09:14.534 --> 01:09:16.016]  We said that days after it happened.
[01:09:16.036 --> 01:09:16.776]  It's now been admitted.
[01:09:17.317 --> 01:09:20.079]  Top generals have gone on Fox News and said, no, we gave the missiles to them.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.701]  But they're a real terror group.
[01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:27.885]  Just because the West and criminal elements of our government are working with them doesn't mean they control them.
[01:09:29.045 --> 01:09:34.208]  And they are now in Juarez, across from El Paso, inside Homeland Security memos.
[01:09:34.228 --> 01:09:37.609]  These were not publicly put out in fake terror alerts for election time.
[01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:41.531]  We've got people in the General's office at Fort Bliss.
[01:09:42.152 --> 01:09:43.232]  We've got more than that.
[01:09:43.372 --> 01:09:44.693]  CIA, you name it.
[01:09:46.294 --> 01:09:52.177]  The people that have leaked info before, the system doesn't like, saying there are ISIS groups forming.
[01:09:53.459 --> 01:10:03.524]  Inside Mexico right now, and that's in the news today, ABC News reports, NBC News reports, Texas Sheriff says ISIS cells are operating in Juarez, Mexico, and he's ready for them.
[01:10:05.045 --> 01:10:09.188]  He was given this in a briefing, online briefing, with the feds.
[01:10:09.408 --> 01:10:14.911]  Now, whether it's real or not, they're getting us ready for a terror attack that will be used to take our liberties.
[01:10:15.271 --> 01:10:20.854]  That's why we sent Joe Biggs down to the border, to dress up like a jihadi with an ISIS flag, and do a simulated beheading.
[01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:27.043]  In the park, on the Mexico side, inside El Paso, on the edge of town.
[01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:28.703]  By the big Mexican flag.
[01:10:30.224 --> 01:10:31.124]  Man crosses U.S.
[01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.705]  border, dresses ISIS terrorist, simulates beheading.
[01:10:34.826 --> 01:10:39.487]  Stunt took place at the exact spot where feds say ISIS terror attack is imminent on or before September 11th.
[01:10:40.828 --> 01:10:44.329]  Now we also have done the Obama-ISIS bucket challenge.
[01:10:44.389 --> 01:10:46.110]  That video's up on the site going viral.
[01:10:47.881 --> 01:10:50.604]  To try to hijack that meme to point out our borders wide open.
[01:10:50.624 --> 01:11:03.760]  This is the collapse of the country, the end of our sovereignty, and they've got domestic police state going on against the Tea Party, the IRS going after, veterans groups, libertarian groups, conservative groups, Christian groups, pro-life groups.
[01:11:05.223 --> 01:11:18.733]  So we're down there pointing out that they have no security where we need it, and then meanwhile the TSA is literally checking babies' diapers and putting us in naked body scanners to train us how to be prisoners, to train us to be under state control, to end our free society.
[01:11:22.475 --> 01:11:29.720]  But I see a minority of the commenters going, Alex, you're with the Feds promoting a terror threat, you know, there's no such thing as Islamic extremism, blah blah blah.
[01:11:30.221 --> 01:11:32.922]  No, there are real Muslim terrorists out there, okay?
[01:11:32.942 --> 01:11:33.463]  That's a fact.
[01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:39.104]  The government lets them attack, funds them, sometimes totally stages it, to be able to take our freedoms.
[01:11:39.204 --> 01:11:45.908]  We're pointing the whole thing out, preemptively, so that if there is an attack, everybody knows they left the border wide open.
[01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:47.028]  That's what we're doing.
[01:11:48.289 --> 01:11:50.310]  And it's got the trolls hopping mad.
[01:11:51.303 --> 01:11:54.966]  I've never supported military action against Serbia or any of these countries.
[01:11:55.086 --> 01:11:58.189]  I support Rand Paul saying we gotta bomb ISIS right now.
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.671]  Because they are killing Christians and innocents everywhere.
[01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:01.592]  They're taking over.
[01:12:01.952 --> 01:12:04.375]  The problem is our government helped set them up to begin with.
[01:12:04.575 --> 01:12:06.156]  That's why Obama won't really bomb them.
[01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:11.341]  He'll have two or three flights, shorties a day, that bomb an old truck or something.
[01:12:11.781 --> 01:12:17.323]  Because it's such a PR disaster for them, they're trying to change the name from Al-Qaeda in Iraq to ISIS.
[01:12:17.663 --> 01:12:18.203]  Now I'm done.
[01:12:18.243 --> 01:12:19.463]  Joel Gilbert joins us.
[01:12:20.024 --> 01:12:21.824]  He's got There's No Place Like Utopia.
[01:12:22.464 --> 01:12:24.425]  The trailer's up on Infowars.com.
[01:12:24.865 --> 01:12:27.026]  And we're going to show some of the trailer while he's talking.
[01:12:27.406 --> 01:12:29.106]  And then when he leaves us, we'll also show it.
[01:12:29.447 --> 01:12:31.767]  I have no stake in this trailer, in this film.
[01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:33.648]  I intend to sell it on DVD when it comes out.
[01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:36.487]  He's an excellent filmmaker.
[01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:40.654]  He exposed the origins, the true origins of Obama like nobody else.
[01:12:40.674 --> 01:12:42.276]  He's an original researcher.
[01:12:43.595 --> 01:12:55.198]  Dr. Jerome Corsi and others are in the film, and it needs to get sold out in the cities it opens in, so that other theaters will then pick it up, so that we can expose what collectivism does.
[01:12:55.598 --> 01:12:59.719]  That's why I have activists and filmmakers on, and don't just promote ourselves.
[01:13:00.079 --> 01:13:03.920]  I didn't sell or plug one thing last hour, even though that's how we fund ourselves.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.220]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:13:06.681 --> 01:13:07.861]  PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:13:08.181 --> 01:13:09.202]  But I'm having somebody on.
[01:13:09.262 --> 01:13:10.542]  I'm not saying I'm some great guy.
[01:13:10.962 --> 01:13:13.002]  We do this because we're all in this together.
[01:13:13.382 --> 01:13:14.603]  They're scared of these films.
[01:13:14.883 --> 01:13:17.843]  They arrested Dinesh D'Souza because they were scared of his films.
[01:13:18.944 --> 01:13:21.444]  They've indicted and arrested Rick Perry because they're scared of him.
[01:13:21.704 --> 01:13:24.185]  Not that he's perfect, but at least he's trying to secure the border.
[01:13:24.745 --> 01:13:25.785]  I've been a big critic of Perry.
[01:13:26.165 --> 01:13:29.766]  The point is they're coming after everybody, folks, because we do have a shot.
[01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:31.946]  There is a purge going on.
[01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:34.167]  There is an attempt to end Talk Radio's freedom.
[01:13:35.049 --> 01:13:37.211]  There is an attempt to come in with internet censorship.
[01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:42.475]  Now let's go to Joel Gilbert, joining us, the filmmaker with There's No Place Like Utopia.
[01:13:42.855 --> 01:13:44.937]  Joel, so much is going on right now.
[01:13:45.317 --> 01:13:53.964]  Tell us about where the film's opening, what's going on with that, but then your take on our government openly funding ISIS, the craziness that's going on.
[01:13:53.984 --> 01:13:56.887]  I mean, it's just getting so bizarre right now.
[01:13:57.677 --> 01:13:59.478]  Well, unfortunately, it's all quite predictable.
[01:14:00.098 --> 01:14:02.239]  I'll tell you first, there's no place like Utopia.
[01:14:02.279 --> 01:14:05.520]  We opened in Denver a month ago, sold out everything.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.181]  Now we're in three theaters in the Houston area.
[01:14:08.601 --> 01:14:11.522]  Anybody can please come out this weekend on Fandango.
[01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:12.883]  You can get tickets in advance.
[01:14:13.943 --> 01:14:23.346]  What we're seeing playing out is the socialist Marxist ideology that has permeated and taken over the Democrat Party over the past 20, 30 years.
[01:14:24.967 --> 01:14:27.029]  And this is covered in There's No Place Like Utopia.
[01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:35.396]  And most people don't realize that the Democrat Party, even well-meaning liberals, don't accept or understand it's been taken over by these radicals.
[01:14:35.957 --> 01:14:38.339]  And today it is a radical socialist party.
[01:14:38.959 --> 01:14:44.084]  Now, the Marxists and Islamists have been natural allies for the past 60, 70 years.
[01:14:44.304 --> 01:14:44.865]  Absolutely!
[01:14:44.945 --> 01:14:49.669]  I have Democrats and ISIS people constantly threatening us now, saying, how dare you not love ISIS?
[01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:50.610]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:52.250]  Well, let me tell you what they have in common.
[01:14:52.371 --> 01:14:54.371]  Both of them are universalist movements.
[01:14:54.471 --> 01:15:01.314]  Both Islam and Marxism believe that one day the entire world will be Marxist or Islamist.
[01:15:01.774 --> 01:15:09.957]  Marxists believe that they can create a utopia here on Earth, paradise on Earth, with the leader of the socialist paradise, the God on Earth.
[01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:14.018]  The only difference is that Islamists are a little more patient.
[01:15:14.058 --> 01:15:15.679]  They want to create and go to paradise
[01:15:16.619 --> 01:15:17.360]  In the next world.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:27.746]  But in the meantime, they're allies because they both view Western capitalism, Western free market system, free speech, as the number one obstacle to their taking power.
[01:15:28.147 --> 01:15:37.433]  And therefore, they are together in targeting free speech, free markets, because they know if they can defeat it, it'll be their path to taking power.
[01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:38.674]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:15:38.754 --> 01:15:41.657]  I'm all for free speech and I'm not what they call an Islamophobe.
[01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:47.442]  But our government's working with the radical Muslims that are bullying and killing the non-radical Muslims.
[01:15:47.823 --> 01:15:50.525]  You're not allowed to criticize Islam in England.
[01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:53.148]  You get arrested or you get banned from flying in.
[01:15:53.608 --> 01:15:56.911]  They are now banning mainline people from England.
[01:15:57.732 --> 01:16:05.819]  Who just mildly criticized radical Islam while they let radical Islamists be on TV calling for blowing up government buildings.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.444]  So clearly the socialist government in England has totally teamed up with the Islamists.
[01:16:11.504 --> 01:16:12.385]  It really has happened.
[01:16:12.845 --> 01:16:19.067]  Right, what they've done essentially is they use Soviet-era censorship.
[01:16:20.107 --> 01:16:27.570]  Sometimes we call it political correctness, but it really is getting to a level of Soviet censorship to prevent people from opposing them.
[01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:33.334]  This is the vision of Utopia on Earth, where everyone thinks the same, looks the same, lives the same.
[01:16:33.794 --> 01:16:41.140]  Essentially, we're all animals in a cage, and they have a police force which forces people to go to work, because otherwise no one will work.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.042]  And they use Soviet-style disinformation.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:50.945]  There's no question that all we get out of the White House is disinformation from the Soviet era.
[01:16:51.105 --> 01:16:51.726]  Unemployment, 6%.
[01:16:52.587 --> 01:16:54.708]  Anybody believe that?
[01:16:54.888 --> 01:16:57.070]  Unaccompanied minors coming over the border.
[01:16:57.311 --> 01:16:58.071]  All a big lie.
[01:16:58.251 --> 01:17:00.673]  Everything coming out of the White House is a lie.
[01:17:01.314 --> 01:17:06.558]  And what we defeated in the Soviet system, unfortunately, today in America, exists.
[01:17:10.402 --> 01:17:11.623]  Continue breaking that down.
[01:17:13.066 --> 01:17:19.592]  Well, Obama took power in the classical socialist Marxist methodology.
[01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:25.878]  He said that he was going to cut the deficit in half, he's going to bring people together, most transparent government in history.
[01:17:26.259 --> 01:17:27.900]  He took power with the big lie.
[01:17:28.683 --> 01:17:30.204]  He also lied about who he was.
[01:17:30.344 --> 01:17:36.448]  I've chronicled that his real father, of course, was this Soviet agent and communist propagandist, Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:17:36.968 --> 01:17:42.192]  The man who indoctrinated him, and he admits raised him, into this Marxist ideology.
[01:17:42.212 --> 01:17:44.613]  I mean, he stayed with him on the summers.
[01:17:45.054 --> 01:17:46.995]  There's photos of his mother on the couch with him.
[01:17:47.415 --> 01:17:48.396]  I mean, it really is.
[01:17:48.516 --> 01:17:49.598]  It is his dad!
[01:17:50.338 --> 01:18:00.510]  Look, he lied about the biology, that's bad enough, but he did so to hide the fact that he was indoctrinated by Davis into this radical Marxist anti-white ideology.
[01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:08.539]  Everything Obama has done is to hide his connection to Davis because it would reveal an agenda that is unacceptable to the American people.
[01:18:09.039 --> 01:18:12.741]  So just like Fidel Castro said, we've got Castro on tape.
[01:18:13.701 --> 01:18:15.442]  I believe in representative democracy.
[01:18:15.883 --> 01:18:18.464]  Even Adolf Hitler, he became a big Democrat.
[01:18:19.024 --> 01:18:26.868]  Once these guys take power, they pursue the original agenda, and then they use the tools of state, like the IRS.
[01:18:26.888 --> 01:18:27.749]  There is no IRS.
[01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:29.730]  Targeting scandal.
[01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:33.713]  It's the White House, Democrat Party targeting scandal.
[01:18:33.733 --> 01:18:40.779]  They use the tools of state to disenfranchise and suppress any opposition to keep a permanent hold on power.
[01:18:40.819 --> 01:18:42.701]  And notice they never get in trouble now.
[01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:44.022]  They just get away with everything.
[01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:48.025]  Oh yeah, because they got away with Fast and Furious, they just try the next thing.
[01:18:48.065 --> 01:18:49.306]  They get away with Benghazi.
[01:18:49.326 --> 01:18:52.149]  They get away with the IRS targeting.
[01:18:52.569 --> 01:18:56.633]  There's been no real force to push back and stop them.
[01:18:56.673 --> 01:19:02.278]  There's no reason for them not to do the next outrage because there's no opposition, unfortunately.
[01:19:02.298 --> 01:19:04.019]  Have you run into censorship with your film?
[01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:07.863]  Because usually when a film starts selling out in theaters, it gets picked up more places.
[01:19:08.083 --> 01:19:09.885]  How do we get your film everywhere?
[01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:19.529]  Well, the censorship I've run into is, of course, I've had the IRS send me a letter about once a week for the past two years demanding something, and I've just been beating them back.
[01:19:19.809 --> 01:19:22.150]  I take it almost as a comedy routine.
[01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:24.872]  I haven't paid them a dime, but they're always after me.
[01:19:25.793 --> 01:19:29.996]  Of course, we've been denied advertising time in Denver and in places in Houston.
[01:19:30.036 --> 01:19:32.177]  Mostly NBC affiliates won't take our money.
[01:19:32.337 --> 01:19:32.577]  Wow!
[01:19:33.618 --> 01:19:35.259]  And that's been chronicled in Walnut Daily.
[01:19:37.338 --> 01:19:39.039]  You know, we're just going to keep pushing forward.
[01:19:39.059 --> 01:19:52.209]  The way to get people out on the website, there'snoplacelikeutopia.com, you can hit the theater's link, and if you click on the link, bring there's no place like Utopia to my town, that really helps us when we expand.
[01:19:52.249 --> 01:19:53.971]  We send that out to all the people in Utah.
[01:19:54.231 --> 01:19:55.372]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:19:55.392 --> 01:19:59.295]  I mean, think about how far gone our country is, that you're being censored everywhere.
[01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:01.836]  And you can't even advertise your film.
[01:20:01.856 --> 01:20:04.858]  I mean, this is... Our country is already so far down the rat hole.
[01:20:05.219 --> 01:20:06.800]  Don't take this show for granted, folks.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.221]  We might not be here tomorrow.
[01:20:09.645 --> 01:20:14.586]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.

[01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:08.233]  Question.
[01:22:08.594 --> 01:22:12.836]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:14.237]  Answer, yes.

[01:24:00.647 --> 01:24:00.907]  That's 1-800-281-6805.
[01:24:00.947 --> 01:24:02.768]  A decade ago, people would have been having arms over...
[01:24:23.608 --> 01:24:32.897]  The news media, the news stations refusing the advertising for a documentary film when the ad, I've seen the ad, it's very tame.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:45.968]  Now most TV stations, radio stations, print, especially banks, won't take your business or let you operate if you have a gun shop.
[01:24:46.389 --> 01:24:48.210]  Even big sporting goods stores are having their
[01:24:49.514 --> 01:24:50.575]  Their account's cancelled.
[01:24:50.975 --> 01:24:56.280]  This is what Hitler did from 1933 to 1939, before he started actually arresting people.
[01:24:57.421 --> 01:25:00.284]  Is that they start economically doing this and censoring you.
[01:25:01.665 --> 01:25:09.513]  And so a microcosm of this film, that Joel Gilbert's produced, There's No Place Like Utopia.com's the website.
[01:25:10.794 --> 01:25:17.264]  It shows how far down this totalitarian utopian hellhole we've gotten, Joel.
[01:25:17.805 --> 01:25:21.170]  Joel, other points about the film and where you see the world right now.
[01:25:21.651 --> 01:25:25.698]  Obama has like a 37% gallop, one of the lowest ever for a president.
[01:25:26.775 --> 01:25:28.156]  But still, he just doesn't care.
[01:25:28.176 --> 01:25:35.202]  He moves forward in an authoritarian way, says he'll sign executive orders that have never been done on military, on borders, on energy.
[01:25:36.383 --> 01:25:40.607]  He is setting the precedent that presidents are elected dictators.
[01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:44.368]  Well, Obama is a professional agitator.
[01:25:44.888 --> 01:25:49.470]  He was brought into Chicago by Bill Air's father to become a community agitator.
[01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:52.051]  The word organizer was just a nice way to put it.
[01:25:52.652 --> 01:25:57.794]  It's to rub salt in the wounds of minorities and then use their discontent to take power.
[01:25:57.894 --> 01:25:59.154]  That's the written ideology.
[01:25:59.735 --> 01:26:00.955]  That's what he's doing in the White House.
[01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:10.059]  Everything he's done is meant to agitate and divide the country economically and by race so they can promise people, give us the power and we'll make it right for you.
[01:26:11.258 --> 01:26:19.868]  I did experience going to, in the film, I went to Detroit, Southside, Chicago, Newark, all these progressive cities that have been controlled by Democrats for 50, 60 years.
[01:26:21.997 --> 01:26:27.022]  And they've got 60% unemployment, drug culture, taxation, no jobs.
[01:26:27.802 --> 01:26:31.586]  These people have been regressing all these years, not progressing.
[01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:33.708]  But I did find some inspiration.
[01:26:33.728 --> 01:26:34.629]  You'll see that in the film.
[01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:39.133]  When you talk to these people, they're like, they want nothing to do with this progressive agenda.
[01:26:39.173 --> 01:26:41.355]  No amnesty for illegals, no marijuana.
[01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:48.925]  The most conservative people today in America, believe it or not, are black women living in these cities.
[01:26:48.985 --> 01:26:50.046]  They're very tough.
[01:26:50.146 --> 01:26:55.671]  They just need the Republicans to communicate to them and let them know that there's a choice.
[01:26:56.092 --> 01:27:01.737]  Well, Joel, did you see how California now is going to give free marijuana to the homeless to basically suppress them?
[01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:03.679]  Again, I'm for decriminalization.
[01:27:04.199 --> 01:27:08.681]  But it doesn't mean that I then endorse the doper head mentality.
[01:27:09.221 --> 01:27:15.244]  And clearly George Soros wants everybody smoking super high-powered weed, so they're all zombies.
[01:27:15.844 --> 01:27:18.746]  And when you look, how do you fix this problem?
[01:27:19.286 --> 01:27:21.167]  Go ahead.
[01:27:21.847 --> 01:27:25.548]  A drug culture is much easier to control and enslave.
[01:27:26.988 --> 01:27:37.891]  The idea of, I was in Colorado and Denver, we went to some of these marijuana clinics, and these people are smoking dope on the street, driving smoking dope, and they don't care about politics.
[01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:39.772]  They don't even remember what day is election day.
[01:27:40.532 --> 01:27:42.392]  And these people are very easy to control.
[01:27:42.472 --> 01:27:44.373]  So California is running amok with our
[01:27:45.307 --> 01:27:49.991]  You know, Governor Moonbeam from the 70s, he's back with more of this nonsense.
[01:27:50.411 --> 01:27:56.255]  And it's going to take a grassroots movement in America and a Republican opposition to really draw a line in the sand.
[01:27:56.275 --> 01:27:58.977]  And I want to explain why we've got to take the Republicans over here briefly.
[01:27:59.678 --> 01:28:10.586]  After they implode Michigan, implode California, implode New York, implode Florida, the Democrats then move to constitutional states that are wealthy and successful like Texas, and they don't change.
[01:28:10.626 --> 01:28:11.927]  They then wreck that state.
[01:28:12.348 --> 01:28:13.569]  I'm living under this now.
[01:28:14.557 --> 01:28:18.020]  And so they've got to be stopped or they will destroy the whole country.
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.602]  They move like locusts from field to field.
[01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:34.054]  I think they can be defeated if Republicans make the argument, even in the inner cities, that you can choose American values, free markets, free speech, opportunity and prosperity, or you're on the progressive road to hell.
[01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:35.976]  If they make that argument, they win.
[01:28:36.296 --> 01:28:39.239]  What do you do, though, about the Republican leadership being just as bad as the Democrats?
[01:28:40.103 --> 01:28:41.424]  That's the big challenge right now.
[01:28:41.464 --> 01:28:49.570]  The Democrats are so bankrupt of ideas and they're such failures and such liars that it really doesn't take much to turn it around.
[01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:58.476]  And we don't have, unfortunately, on the other side, a leader has not yet come forward who has the courage to tell the truth and tell it like it is to the American people.
[01:29:00.457 --> 01:29:04.781]  Well, there's no doubt that socialism has collapsed Latin America and now it's here.
[01:29:05.996 --> 01:29:07.938]  And I hope everyone will go see the film.
[01:29:08.038 --> 01:29:09.460]  I can't wait till the DVD's out.
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:10.241]  I want to sell it.
[01:29:10.601 --> 01:29:12.964]  How long until we're going to get a DVD release?
[01:29:13.004 --> 01:29:18.249]  DVD release is December 1st, but we're going to give you probably three or four weeks in advance to sell some out.
[01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:22.894]  You'll even see in the film, I talked to some illegals from Guatemala, El Salvador.
[01:29:23.295 --> 01:29:24.436]  We said, why are you here?
[01:29:24.837 --> 01:29:27.439]  And they said, because socialism destroyed our country.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.141]  So they're here to get away from socialism.
[01:29:30.161 --> 01:29:31.802]  They don't know what's in store for them, apparently.
[01:29:32.682 --> 01:29:40.046]  Yeah, well, I mean, I know a lot of folks, I told you, from Latin America hate socialism, but then to get the free goodies, they'll vote for the most hardcore Democrat.
[01:29:40.066 --> 01:29:41.067]  It's just crazy!
[01:29:41.687 --> 01:29:43.428]  All right, Joel Gilbert, thank you so much.
[01:29:43.528 --> 01:29:46.909]  And again, people can find the film, how to get it in their local theater.
[01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:49.031]  There's no place like utopia.com.
[01:29:49.071 --> 01:29:49.611]  Great job.
[01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:51.092]  And we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:29:51.512 --> 01:29:52.292]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:29:52.632 --> 01:29:52.992]  You bet.
[01:29:53.093 --> 01:29:57.155]  All right, we're going to come right back with another guest who's taking action, waking up millions.
[01:29:57.175 --> 01:29:57.715]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.462 --> 01:30:01.465]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.386 --> 01:30:05.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.592 --> 01:30:15.537]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:15.758 --> 01:30:19.981]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:20.322 --> 01:30:24.886]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:25.266 --> 01:30:27.888]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:28.188 --> 01:30:33.371]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:33.652 --> 01:30:40.516]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:44.799]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:45.159 --> 01:30:49.962]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:50.282 --> 01:30:51.143]  This is innovating.
[01:30:51.403 --> 01:30:58.710]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:02.954]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:43.473 --> 01:31:48.136]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.237]  Talk about the effects.
[01:31:49.557 --> 01:31:51.079]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:31:51.099 --> 01:31:52.720]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:31:53.001 --> 01:31:54.062]  I feel like I look better.
[01:31:54.102 --> 01:31:54.762]  I feel better.
[01:31:54.823 --> 01:31:55.864]  I feel sexier.
[01:31:55.884 --> 01:31:56.604]  I love it.
[01:31:56.865 --> 01:31:59.768]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:32:07.256 --> 01:32:08.337]  This is life changing.
[01:32:08.817 --> 01:32:10.058]  Another major health threat.
[01:32:10.078 --> 01:32:14.982]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:17.704]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:17.724 --> 01:32:24.509]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:27.651]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:30.693]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:32:30.713 --> 01:32:32.715]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:32:32.755 --> 01:32:35.557]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:35.657 --> 01:32:41.159]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:32:41.399 --> 01:32:44.880]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[01:34:18.356 --> 01:34:19.376]  So that's all coming up.
[01:34:20.237 --> 01:34:27.122]  Here in just a moment, for a few weeks we've been accepting Bitcoin at Infowarsstore.com because even the big retailers have accepted it.
[01:34:27.582 --> 01:34:30.905]  And even if it's a fiat crypto system, so is the globalist system.
[01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.686]  So why not have alternatives to it?
[01:34:33.827 --> 01:34:34.647]  So that's coming up.
[01:34:34.988 --> 01:34:46.056]  Briefly, please don't forget that we have developed with Dr. Group and pharmacists and other researchers, true
[01:34:47.475 --> 01:34:57.346]  Groundbreaking nutraceutical supplements that are the Rolls-Royce or Bentley of the supplement world at affordable prices.
[01:34:58.006 --> 01:35:03.732]  The average supplement company, dirty little secret, sells stuff for about five to seven times markup.
[01:35:04.513 --> 01:35:06.916]  Our markup is just a hundred percent.
[01:35:08.655 --> 01:35:15.019]  And we do that so we can fund our operation but also give people really high quality products at an affordable price.
[01:35:15.659 --> 01:35:19.321]  Like we sold out in four hours of the DNA Force.
[01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:20.742]  More is coming in soon.
[01:35:20.762 --> 01:35:22.543]  It's just so hard to get the materials.
[01:35:22.643 --> 01:35:23.443]  It's super strong.
[01:35:23.483 --> 01:35:27.646]  It's the organic forms of CoQ10 and PPQ and all the rest of it.
[01:35:28.146 --> 01:35:33.929]  People that know vitamins and minerals are like, whoa, this is supposed to be $300 to $600 and it's not, so it's sold out.
[01:35:34.009 --> 01:35:35.450]  So we're victims of our own success.
[01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:43.374]  We have super male vitality that's a bunch of concentrated herbs and other extracts that get your glands to release normally and be healthy.
[01:35:43.674 --> 01:35:47.036]  It doesn't mimic testosterone and other things in the body like progesterone.

[01:35:50.998 --> 01:35:56.942]  Put it to you this way, I've gone from bench pressing 250 pounds to over 300 pounds real quick doing this.
[01:35:57.482 --> 01:36:04.626]  So, super male vitality, super female vitality, available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:04.646 --> 01:36:09.829]  The Survival Shield X2, the only deep earth, pure crystal form of this.
[01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:13.171]  We have videos breaking it down at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:14.472 --> 01:36:17.519]  So folks, to understand why that's so important, our info wars life.com.
[01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:19.763]  And I'm going to take my noontime dose.
[01:36:19.783 --> 01:36:20.946]  I actually forgot this morning.
[01:36:21.527 --> 01:36:25.455]  If you will take this every day, talk to your physician first.
[01:36:26.786 --> 01:36:26.866]  Yeah.
[01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:48.893]  I'm always taking the stuff for months and months before it's available.
[01:36:48.913 --> 01:36:50.935]  We got some new products coming out soon.
[01:36:50.955 --> 01:36:51.656]  ForrestLife.com.
[01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:54.499]  They're going to be very popular because people use it.
[01:36:54.939 --> 01:36:57.582]  And then you see the reviews online, not even on our own site.
[01:36:58.483 --> 01:37:03.308]  We're talking five stars when nobody else is getting that because this really is the big secret.
[01:37:03.908 --> 01:37:08.253]  And the best part is it also funds this operation and free speech and overall liberty.
[01:37:10.814 --> 01:37:13.956]  A lot of people say, I will never take iodine.
[01:37:14.016 --> 01:37:14.617]  It tastes horrible.
[01:37:15.077 --> 01:37:16.878]  The stuff at the store will basically kill you, folks.
[01:37:16.898 --> 01:37:18.319]  You know, regular stuff you put on cuts.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.702]  And then you've got the so-called nascent iodine out there that's an alcohol that tastes like rocket fuel.
[01:37:23.183 --> 01:37:24.023]  This is different.
[01:37:24.624 --> 01:37:25.825]  This is real iodine.
[01:37:27.226 --> 01:37:28.507]  I'm trying to explain that to people.
[01:37:28.627 --> 01:37:30.128]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:32.269 --> 01:37:32.369]  Or 888.
[01:37:34.326 --> 01:37:35.526]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-er.
[01:37:36.687 --> 01:37:56.773]  And that's how we fund this entire operation, is the PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, our radio sponsors, and the products that we sell, whether they're InfoWars dash cams, or Molon Labe ProGun t-shirts, or high-quality documentary films, or scientific textbooks on GMO, it's all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:01.895 --> 01:38:02.055]  Now,
[01:38:03.735 --> 01:38:06.658]  Julia Toriansky is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:38:07.138 --> 01:38:09.060]  I appreciate her coming on with us.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:18.949]  Then we have former number four at the NSA, top whistleblower, joining us, William Binney, for his third visit with the Infowars operation to break down the latest
[01:38:19.449 --> 01:38:28.374]  On what he calls a total totalitarian takeover with the NSA, with private interests that are given access to the data to corner markets and control society.
[01:38:28.654 --> 01:38:34.998]  We'll have open phones and also your questions sent to Real Alex Jones will be brought up to him here on air.
[01:38:35.418 --> 01:38:37.739]  But first off, let's go to Julia.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:43.503]  Julia, you did some reporting for us out at Bilderberg, did a great job over there in Copenhagen this year.
[01:38:44.023 --> 01:38:44.984]  So much is happening.
[01:38:45.024 --> 01:38:48.586]  Before we get into Bitcoin, you're traveling the world right now.
[01:38:50.054 --> 01:38:58.916]  Give us your take on what's happening with Russia and Ukraine, ISIS, Obama acting as a dictator, the Federal Reserve.
[01:38:58.936 --> 01:39:12.560]  I mean, it's such a crazy time to be alive, and you believe things like Bitcoin are financial revolutions that could unseat the New World Order and make it as obsolete as a buggy whip when automobiles came in.
[01:39:13.501 --> 01:39:14.281]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:39:15.761 --> 01:39:16.561]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:16.581 --> 01:39:17.142]  Thanks for having me.
[01:39:17.162 --> 01:39:17.502]  How are you?
[01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:17.942]  Good.
[01:39:17.982 --> 01:39:18.542]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:39:20.061 --> 01:39:29.367]  Well, I guess a point that I'd like to make is something I recently realized is that economics and technology is very far advanced.
[01:39:29.527 --> 01:39:32.548]  It's generationally more advanced than political thought.
[01:39:32.989 --> 01:39:41.954]  So what we have is we're playing this game within the current systems of politics, which haven't changed that much since politics existed.
[01:39:42.494 --> 01:39:44.956]  But the way that we are interacting
[01:39:46.276 --> 01:39:53.443]  You know, with the internet revolution, with the information revolution, it's really thrown us into a completely new age.
[01:39:53.964 --> 01:39:56.006]  And we've left politics behind.
[01:39:56.146 --> 01:39:58.808]  The thought has been left behind in some ways.
[01:39:59.349 --> 01:40:07.537]  So this is where governments become nervous about things like Bitcoin and dark web and anonymity networks.
[01:40:08.277 --> 01:40:10.619]  And to me, this whole geopolitical
[01:40:12.322 --> 01:40:13.883]  I agree with you.
[01:40:13.903 --> 01:40:15.284]  Elaborate on that.
[01:40:29.924 --> 01:40:38.235]  So, okay, you always, and a lot of people who are quite into gold, they refer to Bitcoin as being fiat, so it's not backed by anything, right?
[01:40:38.596 --> 01:40:42.701]  And I just want to kind of talk about this because what's gold backed by?
[01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:45.024]  Well, gold has inherent value, right?
[01:40:45.064 --> 01:40:45.645]  That's what we say.
[01:40:46.025 --> 01:40:46.986]  What's inherent value?
[01:40:47.046 --> 01:40:48.887]  That's a very subjective thing, right?
[01:40:48.948 --> 01:41:00.477]  No, I mean, I get it that technically it's encryption, it's the limited amount of it, it's that people choose to use it as a medium of exchange, that you could claim Bitcoin is not truly fiat.
[01:41:00.957 --> 01:41:08.243]  I'm just saying that it is competing on the fiat plane with the fiat systems of the globalist.
[01:41:08.924 --> 01:41:09.885]  I don't think so at all.
[01:41:10.865 --> 01:41:13.808]  So let me just say why I think... Sure, sure, go ahead and elaborate.
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:30.678]  Yeah, so the best thing about Bitcoin, which is an application on the blockchain, so I'm just talking about the money aspect of Bitcoin, right, is it allows us to completely separate our financial interaction
[01:41:31.258 --> 01:41:35.363]  from the abusive systems of banking cartels and the state.
[01:41:35.663 --> 01:41:39.107]  So, you know, we have, we're supposed to have a separation of the church and the state.
[01:41:39.567 --> 01:41:46.395]  And now it's actually very plausible for us to have the separation of money and the state.
[01:41:46.915 --> 01:41:51.040]  Now, wow, that means that humans for the
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:57.486]  You know, humans worldwide for the first time in history have the ability to be their own bank.
[01:41:57.827 --> 01:42:02.391]  And with anonymity applications, we have the ability to be our own Swiss bank.
[01:42:02.872 --> 01:42:03.693]  So that's huge.
[01:42:03.713 --> 01:42:04.133]  I agree.
[01:42:04.534 --> 01:42:10.339]  And now our government is actually is mega banks who want to charge us to use our own money and have bail-ins.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.363]  This is the true revolution to create our own
[01:42:13.903 --> 01:42:20.470]  Financial systems period regardless of whether they be gold, silver, bitcoin or local currencies, state currencies.
[01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:24.974]  The answer is diversify how we transact whether it be barter.
[01:42:25.835 --> 01:42:31.160]  Competition is good because the best thing will win out and it doesn't mean it'll make everything else obsolete.
[01:42:31.361 --> 01:42:33.483]  There's definitely always going to be a place for
[01:42:33.943 --> 01:42:34.763]  Precious metals.
[01:42:35.004 --> 01:42:40.206]  There's definitely going to be a place for cash because it's the only true fully anonymous system of exchange.
[01:42:40.466 --> 01:42:41.866]  But cash can be anything.
[01:42:41.886 --> 01:42:42.847]  Cash doesn't have to be cash.
[01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:44.828]  It could be seeds or tokens.
[01:42:44.888 --> 01:42:47.049]  It's just the interpersonal exchange.
[01:42:47.469 --> 01:42:49.670]  Now, that's what's beautiful about Bitcoin as well.
[01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:50.770]  It's peer-to-peer.
[01:42:51.110 --> 01:42:52.311]  It's decentralized.
[01:42:53.491 --> 01:42:56.913]  It, again, empowers us on an individual basis.
[01:42:57.609 --> 01:43:02.035]  And another cool thing that I've been exploring lately is, what is Bitcoin?
[01:43:02.075 --> 01:43:06.440]  Bitcoin is a protocol, which is just language.
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.143]  And language is speech.
[01:43:09.644 --> 01:43:12.908]  And speech is protected under the First Amendment.
[01:43:14.089 --> 01:43:15.331]  Getting interesting, right?
[01:43:17.267 --> 01:43:28.353]  Well, the Supreme Court and others, and federal regulators have basically, from what I've seen, said both that it is money, but then that it's not, that it's property, or that it's like a collectible.
[01:43:28.373 --> 01:43:31.975]  Yeah, they're trying to put it into their framework of control of this.
[01:43:32.335 --> 01:43:33.116]  They're trying to
[01:43:34.921 --> 01:43:35.081]  Sure.
[01:43:51.843 --> 01:43:54.944]  And we can just circumnavigate them with using things like Bitcoin.
[01:43:55.024 --> 01:44:05.508]  And even if Bitcoin doesn't end up being, you know, one of the dominant global systems, it's on the road to that thought process and the road of breaking the monopoly of the mega banks and the state governments.
[01:44:05.828 --> 01:44:06.828]  It's a way out.
[01:44:06.928 --> 01:44:07.709]  It's a way out.
[01:44:07.749 --> 01:44:08.509]  And with
[01:44:08.809 --> 01:44:09.449]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:44:25.916 --> 01:44:38.983]  There is some problems of transparency with the exchanging Bitcoin, but Dark Wallet allows a new tool to make it much more safe to exchange Bitcoin between people.
[01:44:40.263 --> 01:44:49.448]  And actually the G7 released a document listing Dark Wallet as one of the number one concerns for money laundering.
[01:44:49.928 --> 01:44:53.090]  So the government is very worried
[01:44:53.570 --> 01:45:07.049]  They're very worried about these new systems and applications that they can't even comprehend because, like I said, economics and technology is superseding political thought and political structure on an exponential basis.
[01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:21.445]  Now expanding on Bitcoin, I know it's hard for you to believe because you're informed on it, but we have a lot of AM and FM affiliates and millions of listeners out there who might have heard the name Bitcoin, but it's very alien to them or Greek.
[01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:33.488]  Why don't you spend a few minutes about its basic history and what it is for people that don't know and where you believe it's going and some of the history of the attempts to suppress it or control it and where Bitcoin is right now.
[01:45:34.818 --> 01:45:35.118]  Sure.
[01:45:35.198 --> 01:45:40.722]  So I like to make the comparison that Bitcoin is almost like an online gold.
[01:45:40.782 --> 01:45:41.983]  It's deflationary.
[01:45:43.004 --> 01:45:45.125]  It's, in my opinion, non-fiat.
[01:45:45.285 --> 01:45:46.186]  It's limited.
[01:45:46.946 --> 01:45:51.129]  And it's mined, which is kind of a funny thing, right?
[01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:52.830]  It's very similar to gold.
[01:45:53.831 --> 01:45:59.755]  And its history, you know, the creator of Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto.
[01:46:00.495 --> 01:46:03.437]  And nobody knows who he or she or they are.
[01:46:05.139 --> 01:46:19.400]  This was a very very smart move because what I'm just gonna say he by default what Satoshi did was stay anonymous and he did it because he knew he was breaking the law by even creating a competing currency to the American government, right?
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.081]  That's illegal.
[01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:27.185]  And also, I think it was very clever because if he did pronounce himself, he would be very famous.
[01:46:27.245 --> 01:46:29.046]  But instead, he's infamous in history.
[01:46:29.666 --> 01:46:32.768]  And only a few people have had interaction with him.
[01:46:32.808 --> 01:46:35.869]  And one of these people recently died, Mr. Finney.
[01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:41.693]  And interestingly enough, Satoshi was libertarian.
[01:46:41.853 --> 01:46:47.016]  This, I mean, this is assumed, but there are certain things that he did that give away
[01:46:47.996 --> 01:46:49.738]  What I think to be is a fact.
[01:46:50.099 --> 01:47:04.355]  So one of the things is in the Genesis block, which is the first block hashed in the blockchain, Satoshi put in... Can you still hear me?
[01:47:05.831 --> 01:47:06.471]  Yes, I'm right here.
[01:47:06.812 --> 01:47:07.632]  Okay, good, good, good.
[01:47:07.712 --> 01:47:08.773]  My screen just went dark.
[01:47:08.793 --> 01:47:11.435]  I know it's so rare for me to shut up, but I'm listening.
[01:47:11.495 --> 01:47:13.776]  I know it is.
[01:47:14.257 --> 01:47:26.405]  So what he did is, in the Genesis block, he included in the code the headline of when the banks in England had their second bailout.
[01:47:27.515 --> 01:47:28.315]  Interesting, right?
[01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:36.258]  So he's criticizing the current banking system by including that into the very spirit of Bitcoin.
[01:47:36.678 --> 01:47:41.899]  So when people say it's not political, Bitcoin is incredibly political.
[01:47:41.999 --> 01:47:44.280]  And it's naive and silly to say that.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:48.842]  And people who say that Bitcoin isn't political, they're being intellectually dishonest.
[01:47:49.322 --> 01:47:53.383]  And the mere fact that they say Bitcoin isn't political is a political
[01:47:54.385 --> 01:47:57.517]  ...statement because they want to keep it neutral but it's not.
[01:47:58.189 --> 01:48:03.093]  So, anyways, went off there, because this is a big debate in the community.
[01:48:03.593 --> 01:48:14.342]  But I guess its biggest claim to fame, some of the biggest claims to fame, and when it became acknowledged by the mainstream, is when it's, you know, Silk Road.
[01:48:14.722 --> 01:48:16.363]  I first heard about it on Silk Road.
[01:48:16.383 --> 01:48:23.209]  I went on this, through the Tor network, I accessed this dark trading place of drugs, etc., just because I was curious.
[01:48:23.269 --> 01:48:26.191]  And I saw Bitcoin, and God, I wish I bought some, but I didn't.
[01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:39.223]  Um, then, so you're already seeing this undermining of law and law that kills people because right now we're prosecuting Ross Ulbrich, whose mother was on your show and she's a good friend of mine.
[01:48:39.363 --> 01:48:40.604]  Um, shout out to Lynch.
[01:48:40.684 --> 01:48:41.305]  You're wonderful.
[01:48:41.325 --> 01:48:42.246]  Keep up the good fight.
[01:48:43.487 --> 01:48:44.268]  What we should be.
[01:48:45.132 --> 01:48:54.420]  Uh, revering this man we should be, and Russell Brick may not be Dread Pirate Roberts, but whoever he was, whoever starts Silk Road, we should be thanking him for saving lives.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:03.847]  Because when you make, uh, exchange peer-to-peer, especially in a very violent market like the drug market, you take away the third violent party.
[01:49:04.228 --> 01:49:13.375]  So, all that happens is voluntary people are exchanging, uh, goods and value without somebody with a gun or, uh, without
[01:49:14.175 --> 01:49:42.692]  You know banks laundering money for all this he that is he's a freaking hero another thing that Bitcoin got famous for is when WikiLeaks was censored by PayPal and Visa and MasterCard and all of those fantastic payment systems so that they couldn't take donations Bitcoin stepped up and WikiLeaks was able to continue to have funding and exist providing a very very
[01:49:43.174 --> 01:49:43.456]  I'm good.
[01:49:46.773 --> 01:49:48.593]  And even your store, Alex.
[01:49:48.673 --> 01:49:52.454]  Imagine if, you know, I'm sure the government's not a big fan of yours.
[01:49:52.494 --> 01:49:58.856]  Imagine if they crapped down on you and they deny payment gateways like PayPal and the credit cards.
[01:49:58.916 --> 01:50:02.137]  Oh, they've already tried it before and I've had to threaten to sue people, sue people.
[01:50:02.697 --> 01:50:06.698]  I've been denied to sell Obama deception on Google shopping cart.
[01:50:06.718 --> 01:50:08.418]  And we're just constantly censored.
[01:50:08.458 --> 01:50:09.339]  It's just what they do.
[01:50:10.019 --> 01:50:10.659]  It is.
[01:50:11.419 --> 01:50:15.260]  But ISIS is allowed to use Twitter and Facebook, but we get censored.
[01:50:15.902 --> 01:50:16.142]  Right.
[01:50:16.362 --> 01:50:19.824]  But now you don't have to worry about it, because if they ever succeed in that, who cares?
[01:50:19.884 --> 01:50:21.824]  Because you can accept payment through Bitcoin.
[01:50:21.844 --> 01:50:22.505]  Like, who cares?
[01:50:22.725 --> 01:50:23.825]  This is what I'm talking about.
[01:50:23.865 --> 01:50:29.288]  No, that's why we now accept Bitcoin the last three weeks or whatever at InfoWarsTore.com, because we understand that.
[01:50:30.128 --> 01:50:32.189]  Yeah, so this is about, like, the fight.
[01:50:32.989 --> 01:50:35.950]  The age of barricades, physical barricades, is dead.
[01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:39.452]  We're not going to be fighting in the streets, you know.
[01:50:40.292 --> 01:50:41.372]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:50:41.432 --> 01:50:44.774]  It's not efficient, it's violent, and it just doesn't work.
[01:50:45.214 --> 01:50:46.014]  Look at history.
[01:50:46.775 --> 01:50:56.480]  Usually revolutions, physical revolutions, don't turn out to provide us with... There are alternatives to physical revolutions and we would rather keep it non-violent.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:03.743]  We will defend ourselves and have the moral high ground of being defensive, but we should aggressively pull out of the system.
[01:51:04.063 --> 01:51:08.346]  Farmers markets, shop local, Bitcoin, gold, silver, you name it.
[01:51:08.366 --> 01:51:08.866]  Stay with us.

[01:52:08.658 --> 01:52:10.700]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:24.050]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:52:25.111 --> 01:52:26.812]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:52:27.032 --> 01:52:29.213]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[01:52:29.233 --> 01:52:35.335]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:35.655 --> 01:52:43.679]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:52:44.239 --> 01:52:49.704]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:52:49.944 --> 01:52:56.810]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:57.231]  That's 877-532-5388.
[01:52:57.271 --> 01:52:58.271]  Or go to faketv.com.
[01:52:58.392 --> 01:53:00.033]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:10.875]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:53:11.155 --> 01:53:16.017]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:16.278 --> 01:53:24.101]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:28.703]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:53:28.903 --> 01:53:32.725]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:53:32.886 --> 01:53:38.589]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:53:38.829 --> 01:53:41.610]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:47.133]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:55.475]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:53:55.535 --> 01:53:55.816]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:53:55.856 --> 01:53:58.716]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:53:58.736 --> 01:53:59.697]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:54:16.306 --> 01:54:18.767]  Our guests will be with us this segment and the short one after that.
[01:54:18.787 --> 01:54:21.708]  Then William Benning, top of the NSA whistleblower, joins us live.
[01:54:23.088 --> 01:54:25.869]  And again, you can tweet your questions at RealAlexJones for him.
[01:54:26.269 --> 01:54:28.290]  And I guess the guys can grab those for me and print them off.
[01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:36.673]  So I'll ask four, five, six questions or more from listeners out there that tweet questions at RealAlexJones.
[01:54:36.693 --> 01:54:39.034]  In fact, we'll put out some hashtag on that or it's already been done.
[01:54:41.156 --> 01:54:51.223]  Some of the other news going on, F-15s escorted plane with unresponsive, Fox News Philadelphia reports, F-15s escorted plane with unresponsive pilot, officials say.
[01:54:51.623 --> 01:54:52.043]  Two U.S.
[01:54:52.083 --> 01:54:58.187]  fighter jets are escorting an unresponsive small aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean, defense officials say.
[01:54:58.707 --> 01:54:59.128]  The U.S.
[01:54:59.168 --> 01:55:00.329]  Northern Command tweeted
[01:55:01.289 --> 01:55:02.529]  At 12 46 p.m.
[01:55:02.569 --> 01:55:08.751]  today that the unresponsive aircraft took off this morning from Rochester, New York with a flight panned in Naples, Florida.
[01:55:08.771 --> 01:55:16.413]  Officials from NORAD said they suspect hypoxia or no oxygen or deprivation of oxygen may be the possible cause.
[01:55:16.993 --> 01:55:27.036]  It's a TMB 700 light business and utility aircraft so it's not one of the 11 missing planes over in the Middle East that ISIS grabbed
[01:55:28.427 --> 01:55:30.188]  Thanks to NATO putting him in charge of Libya.
[01:55:30.889 --> 01:55:34.771]  Also, NASA says an asteroid will pass very close to Earth on Sunday.
[01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:39.514]  Well, it's government's job to keep us safe, so they need some TSA agents out there to grope the asteroid.
[01:55:40.354 --> 01:55:45.237]  NASA announced that a small asteroid will safely pass very close to Earth on September 7th.
[01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:47.711]  Why are they calling it small?
[01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:49.792]  It's 60 feet in size.
[01:55:49.812 --> 01:55:56.055]  If it actually hit the earth, it would blow up the whole city, but interesting on that front.
[01:55:56.655 --> 01:56:12.544]  Okay, let's go back to our guest, Julia with braveoftheworld.com, a Bitcoin activist who does a lot of interesting pro-Second Amendment reports, you name it, and she's getting into, you know, really a revolution
[01:56:13.799 --> 01:56:17.101]  Against tyranny by simply going around it with our choices.
[01:56:17.782 --> 01:56:20.103]  20 years ago you couldn't find organic food on store shelves.
[01:56:20.543 --> 01:56:24.465]  Now it's supplanting all the GMO and they're taking corn syrup out of everything.
[01:56:25.686 --> 01:56:27.167]  Oh, corn syrup's safe, eat it, eat it.
[01:56:27.447 --> 01:56:28.088]  GMO's safe.
[01:56:28.108 --> 01:56:29.569]  Okay, well we're not going to eat it.
[01:56:30.749 --> 01:56:32.770]  And see, now we're destroying them that way.
[01:56:33.271 --> 01:56:34.311]  This is the answer.
[01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:35.232]  I agree with her.
[01:56:35.732 --> 01:56:36.953]  Other points that are important to make.
[01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:49.427]  Well, with Bitcoin and the technology behind Bitcoin, I think the term, I wouldn't use revolution because to me revolution means that you're trying to change the system.
[01:56:49.467 --> 01:56:52.009]  I agree, it's transcending, it's simply circumnavigating.
[01:56:52.650 --> 01:57:03.620]  It's transcending the system, it's leaving the system far behind in the dust while we're up here and to the point of where we just don't really care what the state does because it becomes obsolete and irrelevant.
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:04.981]  That's where I want to take it.
[01:57:05.201 --> 01:57:14.646]  But I forgot to mention a fun point for your viewers, because I know a lot of people are veering to gold that listen to you, regarding Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin.
[01:57:15.547 --> 01:57:25.472]  His symbolic birthday is actually the day that Roosevelt passed the Executive Order 6102, which forbade the hoarding of gold.
[01:57:26.653 --> 01:57:34.955]  I think maybe Satoshi is giving the gold bugs a shout out and the importance of having a gold-backed system.
[01:57:37.674 --> 01:57:45.081]  Well, I think it's good to have a diverse system, and I haven't sold any of the gold or silver I bought 15, 16 years ago as it went up or as it went down.
[01:57:45.141 --> 01:57:46.202]  It's a backup.
[01:57:46.562 --> 01:57:48.644]  But again, diversification is the answer.
[01:57:49.245 --> 01:57:54.630]  And I know the elites themselves are investing heavily in new cryptocurrencies and things.
[01:57:54.650 --> 01:57:58.253]  Yeah, diversify, decentralize, and disengage.
[01:58:00.779 --> 01:58:01.280]  That's right.
[01:58:02.544 --> 01:58:08.601]  Do you think Bitcoin's going to end up supplanting the Federal Reserve System like that Federal Reserve whistleblower said?
[01:58:11.297 --> 01:58:13.258]  Again, I just think it's going to be irrelevant.
[01:58:14.218 --> 01:58:16.139]  And you know, it's interesting.
[01:58:16.179 --> 01:58:19.701]  People say, oh, Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's transparent, blah, blah, blah.
[01:58:19.721 --> 01:58:21.322]  But that has its own application.
[01:58:21.342 --> 01:58:27.546]  So imagine if politicians started to use Bitcoin and governments and banks started to use Bitcoin.
[01:58:27.866 --> 01:58:28.326]  Interesting.
[01:58:28.366 --> 01:58:30.788]  You know, everything's recorded on a public ledger.
[01:58:31.308 --> 01:58:33.409]  So the transparency is there.
[01:58:33.809 --> 01:58:36.311]  So we could see what the
[01:58:37.131 --> 01:58:43.473]  The politician would give us an address to send our donations to, and we would see exactly what those nations are going to.
[01:58:43.613 --> 01:58:47.635]  Well, I want to hear how you think the Feds or the globalists might strike back against Bitcoin.
[01:58:48.035 --> 01:58:48.615]  Stay with us.
[01:58:48.635 --> 01:58:50.335]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:50.375 --> 01:58:51.536]  Five more minutes with our guests.
[01:58:51.576 --> 01:58:54.217]  Remember, we've got William Binney joining us.

[01:59:29.298 --> 01:59:32.799]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:36.921]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:38.702]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:39.022 --> 01:59:44.044]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:46.605]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:59:46.865 --> 01:59:47.726]  But for how long?
[01:59:48.006 --> 01:59:50.007]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[02:00:02.065 --> 02:00:03.990]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:23.048 --> 02:00:26.670]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.231 --> 02:00:31.333]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.833 --> 02:00:35.776]  Up on InfoWars.com, the ISIS Bucket Obama Challenge.
[02:00:36.296 --> 02:00:36.997]  And we have another
[02:00:38.189 --> 02:00:38.730]  Video.
[02:00:39.611 --> 02:00:45.018]  Man dressed as ISIS jihadi crosses borders, simulates beheading in a major city.
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.102]  Just to illustrate, the border's wide open.
[02:00:48.863 --> 02:00:51.626]  But then they've got the TSA groping everybody.
[02:00:51.866 --> 02:00:53.669]  The war on terror is a hoax and a fraud.
[02:00:53.949 --> 02:00:56.733]  This is meant to expose the hoax, not bolster it.
[02:00:57.914 --> 02:01:01.179]  I'm like the progenitor of exposing the war on terror as a hoax day one.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:02.841]  Not bragging the granddaddy of it.
[02:01:03.262 --> 02:01:05.826]  So fools out there going, hey, Al Qaeda works for the globalists.
[02:01:06.166 --> 02:01:10.653]  Yeah, I know, but it's like turning starving pit bulls loose on a bloody child.
[02:01:11.354 --> 02:01:13.477]  Just because you run the dogs doesn't mean they're not real.
[02:01:14.923 --> 02:01:15.724]  I'm trying to explain that.
[02:01:15.764 --> 02:01:21.329]  It's a globalist destabilization force, so people can't live on their own, so they beg for centralized government.
[02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:22.990]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:01:23.711 --> 02:01:29.916]  They try to create anarchy, so you beg for the state, instead of letting natural anarchy through free association grow.
[02:01:30.765 --> 02:01:33.727]  Now, Julia, other points that are important to make here.
[02:01:34.088 --> 02:01:39.252]  How do you see them striking back and how do you see Bitcoin making the old system obsolete?
[02:01:39.272 --> 02:01:47.999]  Because some could argue that they know the old system is going down, SDR is going to be fiat, that they actually might be behind Bitcoin because they want it to be the new system.
[02:01:49.437 --> 02:01:52.619]  Yeah, I just don't buy it because, you know, it's incredibly difficult.
[02:01:52.659 --> 02:01:53.999]  You can't control it.
[02:01:54.119 --> 02:01:55.320]  It's difficult to censor.
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:02:00.042]  And just like imagine doing an audit on Bitcoin.
[02:02:00.162 --> 02:02:03.904]  It's very, very difficult, much more difficult than the systems we have in place right now.
[02:02:04.204 --> 02:02:10.127]  What they would like is just a pure cashless society where we use credit cards for everything and government issued cards.
[02:02:10.367 --> 02:02:11.808]  Bitcoin is outside of that system.
[02:02:11.848 --> 02:02:15.610]  So I don't think it's favorable for that kind of, I don't think it fits into that
[02:02:16.050 --> 02:02:16.591]  I don't think so.
[02:02:34.733 --> 02:02:35.954]  It's the government conspiracy.
[02:02:36.054 --> 02:02:40.158]  I think it's giving governments way too much credibility.
[02:02:40.338 --> 02:02:41.279]  I just don't believe it.
[02:02:41.319 --> 02:02:48.786]  I think it's an individual or small group of individuals that are innovative and have had a freedom in their intention.
[02:02:49.406 --> 02:02:53.790]  And so let's talk about the regulation because this is a big deal right now.
[02:02:53.890 --> 02:02:54.331]  The New York
[02:02:55.011 --> 02:02:55.332]  We're good.
[02:03:11.207 --> 02:03:31.235]  It defines cryptocurrency very broadly and it states things like all the companies have to have fingerprints of all of their employees, background checks of people who are using their services, you have to
[02:03:32.636 --> 02:03:33.797]  I think so.
[02:03:49.071 --> 02:04:00.416]  They can't afford, you have to hire like three different regulation officers, compliance officers, so little companies are actually being, going to be destroyed if they do choose to stay in New York.
[02:04:00.716 --> 02:04:05.078]  And this is what happened in England with the automobile regulations.
[02:04:05.138 --> 02:04:05.658]  Guess what?
[02:04:05.678 --> 02:04:08.139]  America won the automobile race.
[02:04:08.559 --> 02:04:08.859]  Easy.
[02:04:08.879 --> 02:04:08.959]  Easy.
[02:04:24.987 --> 02:04:28.772]  Um, companies outside of New York are going to actually deny customers that live in New York.
[02:04:28.812 --> 02:04:38.665]  And then people will flee California and New York, come to Texas, and act just the same way, and ruin it again, not smart enough to know that they shouldn't crap in their own house.
[02:04:39.224 --> 02:04:39.884]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:04:39.964 --> 02:04:45.587]  And I have a good friend who's been in the headlines in the Bitcoin community quite a bit.
[02:04:45.847 --> 02:04:46.587]  And he had a business.
[02:04:46.667 --> 02:04:49.288]  And he's going to be moving to Austin, most likely.
[02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:49.928]  Awesome.
[02:04:49.968 --> 02:04:51.209]  Well, we've got to get you in studio.
[02:04:51.249 --> 02:04:54.510]  Julia Turiansky, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:04:54.810 --> 02:04:57.632]  The website is BravetheWorld.com.
[02:04:57.692 --> 02:04:59.052]  Julia Turiansky.
[02:04:59.352 --> 02:05:00.353]  That's BravetheWorld.
[02:05:01.053 --> 02:05:01.493]  All right.
[02:05:01.573 --> 02:05:01.933]  Absolutely.
[02:05:01.953 --> 02:05:03.054]  BravetheWorld.com.
[02:05:03.274 --> 02:05:04.094]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:04.594 --> 02:05:04.875]  All right.
[02:05:04.915 --> 02:05:07.316]  We'll be back with the top NSA whistleblower.
[02:05:07.536 --> 02:05:07.996]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.355 --> 02:05:19.558]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:05:19.919 --> 02:05:26.281]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:26.361 --> 02:05:28.602]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:28.702 --> 02:05:31.763]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:05:31.803 --> 02:05:38.665]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:42.693]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:42.853 --> 02:05:46.817]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:47.137 --> 02:05:48.598]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:48.918 --> 02:05:56.505]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:56.785 --> 02:05:57.626]  But for how long?
[02:05:57.926 --> 02:05:59.907]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:06:00.128 --> 02:06:04.171]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:06:04.551 --> 02:06:05.712]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:06:06.433 --> 02:06:07.374]  Just won't quit.
[02:06:09.483 --> 02:06:10.584]  Open your eyes.
[02:06:11.004 --> 02:06:13.905]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[02:06:14.426 --> 02:06:20.569]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:06:20.909 --> 02:06:28.853]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[02:06:29.253 --> 02:06:30.354]  Open your eyes!
[02:06:30.654 --> 02:06:45.668]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.
[02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:52.595]  Optimize the natural power of your eyes with the latest addition to the super high quality InfoWars Life formulations,
[02:06:53.035 --> 02:06:53.736]  Occupower.
[02:06:53.996 --> 02:06:59.222]  Go to Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com to order Occupower.
[02:06:59.502 --> 02:06:59.982]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:00.002 --> 02:07:00.403]  Occupower.
[02:07:00.443 --> 02:07:01.184]  Open your eyes.
[02:07:09.224 --> 02:07:15.172]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:15.392 --> 02:07:19.597]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:19.958 --> 02:07:24.524]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:24.924 --> 02:07:27.546]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:27.846 --> 02:07:33.030]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:33.291 --> 02:07:40.176]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:40.676 --> 02:07:44.439]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:44.819 --> 02:07:49.603]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:49.943 --> 02:07:50.784]  This is innovating.
[02:07:51.064 --> 02:07:58.352]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:58.553 --> 02:08:02.617]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:08:02.818 --> 02:08:07.983]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:08:16.104 --> 02:08:27.011]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:08:31.213 --> 02:08:33.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:54.545 --> 02:08:57.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:08:57.127 --> 02:09:03.111]  Thank you so much for joining us in this third hour of this Friday edition.
[02:09:03.211 --> 02:09:04.592]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:09:05.133 --> 02:09:09.896]  I'll be back this Sunday live in studio with a Sunday edition, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:09:09.956 --> 02:09:11.437]  Central Standard Time as well.
[02:09:11.917 --> 02:09:14.739]  InfoWars Nightly News is tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.402]  Well, a few months ago, it made big news across the world.
[02:09:18.462 --> 02:09:19.283]  Here was the headline.
[02:09:20.356 --> 02:09:24.739]  The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control.
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:28.262]  That's William Edward Binney.
[02:09:28.743 --> 02:09:32.446]  He's the former technical leader for intelligence with the NSA.
[02:09:32.466 --> 02:09:33.546]  That's at the very top of it.
[02:09:33.867 --> 02:09:35.408]  Before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001.
[02:09:37.478 --> 02:09:45.024]  After more than 30 years with the agency, Benny has been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:51.369]  Benny continues to speak out about the NSA's data collection policies and continues interviews in the media.
[02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:59.976]  And again, it's amazing that he's so high level and has the courage to speak out despite their attempts to silence him.
[02:10:00.436 --> 02:10:03.579]  ExposedFacts.org has some of his information there.
[02:10:04.915 --> 02:10:07.117]  I wanted to get him on the last few weeks.
[02:10:07.157 --> 02:10:11.501]  We're able to get him today because of headlines like this.
[02:10:12.061 --> 02:10:17.586]  Snowden, there's a holy S-word smoking gun revelation coming.
[02:10:18.246 --> 02:10:23.651]  Whistleblower says government believes there's information that would be the death of them all politically.
[02:10:24.091 --> 02:10:27.834]  Well then please release it because we've got a bunch of totalitarians running things.
[02:10:28.415 --> 02:10:29.816]  And he told Wired Magazine that.
[02:10:31.818 --> 02:10:33.139]  William Benny just came out.
[02:10:34.565 --> 02:10:43.732]  With a group that I know is associated with people high up in the government and top analysts like Ray McGovern.
[02:10:44.212 --> 02:10:47.255]  Ex-NSA director, U.S.
[02:10:47.315 --> 02:10:53.399]  intelligence veterans write open letter to Merkel to avoid all-out Ukraine war.
[02:10:53.779 --> 02:11:01.846]  Now the former ambassador to Russia has gone public saying the West is starting the war and has destabilized Ukraine.
[02:11:02.677 --> 02:11:03.597]  That's just the truth.
[02:11:03.877 --> 02:11:06.218]  So I want to get William Benning's breakdown on that.
[02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:19.743]  Also I want to talk to him about parallel construction where other agencies like the DEA are using NSA data totally illegally and then creating fake court cases so the courts don't know where they got the data.
[02:11:20.303 --> 02:11:22.944]  This is just beyond 1984.
[02:11:24.164 --> 02:11:26.285]  So that's some of what we'll talk about in the next hour.
[02:11:26.705 --> 02:11:30.046]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour we've got your questions that you're tweeting.
[02:11:31.223 --> 02:11:36.707]  To real Alex Jones, we put a hashtag out there so you can tweet your questions to William Binney.
[02:11:37.047 --> 02:11:38.769]  We'll also take a few phone calls.
[02:11:38.829 --> 02:11:40.890]  Specific questions for him, 800-259-9231.
[02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:41.070]  800-259-9231.
[02:11:41.290 --> 02:11:43.852]  Specific questions for William Binney.
[02:11:43.872 --> 02:11:47.035]  Mr. Binney, you heard me throw out that grouping of questions.
[02:11:47.135 --> 02:11:48.175]  Would you like to
[02:12:00.044 --> 02:12:04.827]  Answer one of those first, or what do you think is most important that's currently happening right now?
[02:12:06.808 --> 02:12:22.178]  Well, to me, all the data NSA is collecting and being used by the police forces is really the most threatening situation to our constitutional republic since the Civil War.
[02:12:23.019 --> 02:12:24.780]  So to me, that's the most important thing.
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.384]  Because it affects everything we do.
[02:12:27.424 --> 02:12:31.172]  It involves everything that everybody in the country is doing.
[02:12:31.292 --> 02:12:36.564]  So, I mean, that's contrary to the founding documents of this nation.
[02:12:39.309 --> 02:12:40.410]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:45.793]  Last year, we were given secret documents from Homeland Security sources in Seattle.
[02:12:46.133 --> 02:12:51.857]  They were putting up their own cell towers, letting the local police even have access to it, grabbing everyone's data.
[02:12:52.297 --> 02:13:01.884]  Now I see headlines in CBS News, you name it, going, no one knows what the mystery cell towers are, but it's not the government because it's illegal to do that.
[02:13:01.904 --> 02:13:04.405]  I mean, we know what's going on.
[02:13:04.445 --> 02:13:05.306]  Can you speak to that?
[02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:13.392]  Well, I think that's part of that is gathering information on movement of individuals.
[02:13:13.472 --> 02:13:22.375]  I mean, that's how you can track people moving around by basically putting up false towers and getting everybody to ping off your tower.
[02:13:22.435 --> 02:13:23.756]  That way you know they're in the area.
[02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:33.899]  And you can monitor who they are and map them over time by the machine access codes that they have and the phone numbers and things.
[02:13:33.979 --> 02:13:35.100]  So it's not a matter of
[02:13:36.144 --> 02:13:37.865]  You know, it's not a matter of them guessing anymore.
[02:13:37.885 --> 02:13:43.028]  They just track everybody, and it'd be a simple problem to align them, you know, with a program.
[02:13:43.788 --> 02:13:51.373]  Compile them and track everybody individually, and all you have to do is point to them and say, where have you been for the last month or two, and you can see what you've been doing.
[02:13:52.372 --> 02:13:52.852]  That's right.
[02:13:52.892 --> 02:14:00.495]  It's so good to talk to somebody that knows all of this and knows more than I even know because I mean I look at what's open source public every day.
[02:14:00.835 --> 02:14:04.936]  A decade ago the British put these up in London as a beta test as you know.
[02:14:05.516 --> 02:14:06.757]  They also did it in Berlin.
[02:14:06.797 --> 02:14:08.657]  They tracked everybody in real time for years.
[02:14:09.137 --> 02:14:10.078]  It's totally illegal.
[02:14:10.438 --> 02:14:13.339]  Now they're building this grid at billions of dollars of expense.
[02:14:13.899 --> 02:14:14.159]  Yeah, right.
[02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:16.061]  If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you.
[02:14:36.218 --> 02:14:45.622]  Tell folks what parallel construction is and why did you, I mean obviously you can't talk about a lot of it, but why did you leave the NSA when you were one of the top people, one of the directors of it?
[02:14:47.462 --> 02:15:02.388]  I left in October 2001 because they started spying on everybody and assembling information on everyone in the United States and it went first with phone numbers and then went into the internet later on and very shortly thereafter so it was very clear to me that they were
[02:15:03.089 --> 02:15:04.593]  They were pulling together all this knowledge.
[02:15:04.613 --> 02:15:07.199]  It was like a super Stasi state, basically.
[02:15:08.282 --> 02:15:11.771]  So, NSA was becoming the new Stasi agency, you know.
[02:15:13.574 --> 02:15:14.855]  That's their new term.
[02:15:14.875 --> 02:15:38.728]  I guess never say anything is now the new Stasi agency because even though their people are not necessarily using their assembling and making possible all this information and making it available to all the all the police state policing agencies of the federal government that they in turn make it local to the local accessible to the local and state police so it's really becoming a police state that's exactly what East Germany was with the Stasi.
[02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:42.121]  And it was the primary reason why they did it.
[02:15:42.201 --> 02:15:43.181]  That's why I left.
[02:15:43.321 --> 02:15:48.602]  So, I mean, that was the main reason I left, because I could see this coming.
[02:15:49.202 --> 02:16:01.384]  And parallel construction is the use of, is how the police forces, federal, state, and local, use the NSA-collected information, which fundamentally is not acquired with a warrant.
[02:16:01.445 --> 02:16:08.546]  And so, therefore, it is all inadmissible directly, inadmissible in a court of law.
[02:16:09.682 --> 02:16:27.156]  Uh, and so therefore what they do is they have to, uh, whenever they find something through the NSA data, they direct local police force to arrest them and say, now you do a parallel construction by using what you would consider normal policing techniques and, and like requesting things with warrants and things like that.
[02:16:27.236 --> 02:16:31.560]  And you get assemble that data and then you use that data to substitute for the NSA data.
[02:16:32.185 --> 02:16:34.066]  That was originally used to arrest them.
[02:16:34.607 --> 02:16:40.471]  And you substitute the parallel constructed data in the courtroom, which I've called perjury.
[02:16:41.131 --> 02:16:44.654]  They're lying to the courts and they're subverting our entire judicial process.
[02:16:45.435 --> 02:16:52.079]  And that's what happens when you allow this kind of assembly of information that's so much power, it's like J. Edgar Hoover on super steroids.
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:58.224]  So, you know, this is not compatible with any form of democracy at all.
[02:17:00.106 --> 02:17:08.054]  And whether it's Republican or Democratic administrations, Nixon or Obama, they all end up using the IRS, you name it, to persecute political enemies.
[02:17:08.574 --> 02:17:11.937]  Imagine what Hitler would have done with systems like this.
[02:17:11.977 --> 02:17:15.120]  These systems historically always end up getting abused.
[02:17:15.461 --> 02:17:22.607]  If you're just joining us, the former Director of Technical Intelligence with the NSA, I've heard it described as
[02:17:23.208 --> 02:17:24.909]  One of the top four jobs there.
[02:17:25.289 --> 02:17:29.552]  So one of the heads of the NSA, William Edward Benny, is on with us right now.
[02:17:29.572 --> 02:17:36.335]  And I mean, a much bigger whistleblower, you could say, even though he hasn't released a lot of secret info, than Snowden.
[02:17:37.096 --> 02:17:40.818]  And so the media somewhat has tried to ignore him, but he's so big they can't.
[02:17:41.418 --> 02:17:43.720]  Without getting into anything that was classified,
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:51.281]  But we are dealing with open totalitarianism, so it's almost treason for any of us, even if something's classified, to not talk about it.
[02:17:52.042 --> 02:17:53.882]  I mean, what was it like to be in there?
[02:17:53.902 --> 02:18:00.403]  I mean, did they come in and say, OK, we're going to flip on all the switches and spy on everything now and focus on U.S.
[02:18:00.443 --> 02:18:02.044]  citizens and politicians?
[02:18:02.064 --> 02:18:07.705]  I mean, can you tell us, was there a moment or was it a process when you're there heading up?
[02:18:09.125 --> 02:18:12.108]  The NSA, and who comes into you?
[02:18:12.128 --> 02:18:14.269]  Was it the Director of National Intelligence?
[02:18:14.650 --> 02:18:15.210]  Who was it?
[02:18:15.491 --> 02:18:16.271]  Was it the President?
[02:18:16.611 --> 02:18:22.536]  Okay, we're now going to totally break the law and spy on everyone, and then you say, I'm out of here?
[02:18:22.577 --> 02:18:23.257]  How did that happen?
[02:18:24.979 --> 02:18:32.545]  Actually, I was not supposed to know about this program at all, because I told them that I was going to leave in early 2002.
[02:18:34.272 --> 02:18:37.593]  So, I was not supposed to know about what they were doing.
[02:18:38.033 --> 02:18:49.398]  But the problem with that was that they had to use the programs that we had developed there under, that I had helped form, within the SIGINT Automation Research Center, which was my laboratory at the time.
[02:18:50.464 --> 02:19:05.715]  They had to use those programs, which meant they had to use the computer programmers that had developed it for me to install it in another place and get it up and running, because they were the only ones who knew how to make the code, set it up, make it running, and get data flowing in and working.
[02:19:06.656 --> 02:19:12.340]  So when they did that, they kept it all very secret, even inside NSA.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:15.022]  And the reason, of course, was because it was an impeachable act.
[02:19:15.928 --> 02:19:17.849]  I mean, after all, spying on the U.S.
[02:19:17.889 --> 02:19:20.211]  citizens was a violation of the FISA laws.
[02:19:21.031 --> 02:19:22.392]  They were keeping the courts out of it.
[02:19:22.452 --> 02:19:36.561]  They only informed four people in Congress, you know, the chair and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee, one of which was Nancy Pelosi, and that's why she later on said that impeaching George Bush is off the table, because she had agreed to these programs from the beginning.
[02:19:37.406 --> 02:19:40.789]  So, they were keeping it very secret, even from Congress.
[02:19:40.809 --> 02:19:48.696]  They didn't want any opposition, because when, that basically was the Total Information Awareness Program that was started in 2001.
[02:19:48.936 --> 02:19:50.257]  Admiral Poindexter.
[02:19:50.437 --> 02:19:53.500]  Yeah, and if you remember, Admiral Poindexter came out in, I think it was 2003.
[02:19:55.627 --> 02:19:58.570]  Advocating a TIA program, Total Information Awareness program.
[02:19:59.031 --> 02:20:03.996]  And that's when everybody came down on it and terminated it, and that's what Congress's reaction.
[02:20:04.016 --> 02:20:11.203]  But when they saw that reaction, they continued to see that they were, from their perspective, they were making the right decision by keeping it secret.
[02:20:12.044 --> 02:20:17.129]  It's just like their secret agreement, their secret interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
[02:20:17.702 --> 02:20:30.076]  The fellow who wrote the Patriot Act, Representative Sensenbrenner, has already gone publicly and said that he never intended them to be able to do what they are doing, the bulk acquisition of information, by using that Patriot Act.
[02:20:30.942 --> 02:20:45.367]  Well, that's violating the intent of Congress, and yet they're still doing that, and they're afraid to spell out to the American people exactly what they're doing and what their interpretation is of these laws that allows them to do it.
[02:20:45.907 --> 02:20:55.330]  They simply are assuming that if the Congress keeps passing these laws, then that's tacit agreement with what their secret interpretation is.
[02:20:55.470 --> 02:20:59.251]  And they don't have the guts to come out and tell the American people out in the open what they're doing.
[02:21:00.399 --> 02:21:01.519]  That's the real problem.
[02:21:01.719 --> 02:21:02.279]  Well, you're right.
[02:21:02.299 --> 02:21:20.883]  That was a major, as I was on air at the time, when Poindexter wrote the op-ed for the New York Times called Total Information Awareness, he said, your credit card, what you eat, where you go, everything you do, when you go to school, everything will be tracked in live time or the terrorists will kill you.
[02:21:21.523 --> 02:21:25.744]  People went, whoa, this is 1984 and you want private companies to run this?
[02:21:25.904 --> 02:21:26.544]  No way!
[02:21:27.284 --> 02:21:28.445]  So there was a backlash.
[02:21:28.465 --> 02:21:29.265]  So they tried
[02:21:30.285 --> 02:21:36.368]  To openly sell that, when it blew up in their face, as you said, they just went forward with it.
[02:21:36.408 --> 02:21:41.911]  But the biggest thing for me here is, it's come out in England, as you know, that they've got the same system.
[02:21:43.332 --> 02:21:45.053]  And they use it against the Parliament.
[02:21:45.953 --> 02:21:47.134]  The bureaucracy does.
[02:21:47.154 --> 02:21:48.515]  I mean, this is being used.
[02:21:48.555 --> 02:21:50.996]  This is not to stop Al-Qaeda or ISIS.
[02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:53.537]  This is pointed directly to American people.
[02:21:54.017 --> 02:21:56.679]  And now we've gone from it being secret to it being public.
[02:21:57.179 --> 02:21:58.600]  And then nothing's being done.
[02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:00.720]  I mean, where do you see this going?
[02:22:01.981 --> 02:22:04.181]  Well, I see this as a very sad state of affairs.
[02:22:04.201 --> 02:22:06.102]  This is not the America I grew up in.
[02:22:06.162 --> 02:22:10.223]  I tell you, I could never understand why people would tolerate this kind of stuff.
[02:22:10.884 --> 02:22:17.486]  I've been advocating if these bozos keep reinforcing by passing the same laws over and over again, that we the people should fire them.
[02:22:17.906 --> 02:22:22.428]  Get them out of office because they're incompetent and they're not living up to their oath of office.
[02:22:22.828 --> 02:22:23.748]  We need to get rid of them.
[02:22:24.443 --> 02:22:27.827]  I mean, it doesn't matter if Democrats or Republicans.
[02:22:27.907 --> 02:22:29.249]  The party has nothing to do with it.
[02:22:29.269 --> 02:22:33.114]  It has to do with whether or not you subscribe to the foundations of this country.
[02:22:34.889 --> 02:22:43.014]  Well, I remember a listener sent me the link to thomas.loc.gov in 1998 and said, look at this.
[02:22:43.034 --> 02:22:43.735]  He was an engineer.
[02:22:43.775 --> 02:22:45.036]  Engineers would feed me info.
[02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:49.799]  I mean, I had engineers that told me they had big hubs and all the telecoms listening to everything.
[02:22:49.839 --> 02:22:51.560]  They would bring me diagrams.
[02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:52.621]  I had no idea what it meant.
[02:22:52.701 --> 02:22:53.902]  Stick it in Schrader machines.
[02:22:53.922 --> 02:22:59.705]  Because I'm no engineer, but I've been exposing this since day one, having other whistleblowers on.
[02:22:59.765 --> 02:23:01.787]  But I remember
[02:23:04.004 --> 02:23:11.766]  You know, seeing this information and finding it so hard to believe, but reporting on it, and now it's just out in the open.
[02:23:11.786 --> 02:23:21.489]  And I remember being sent documents that they had done a grant for Austin to put up a thousand plus hidden microphones to listen to people.
[02:23:22.129 --> 02:23:30.631]  And they even had an algorithm program running locally that the feds had paid for that was NSA technology that you and others developed, I'm sure, that was keyword.
[02:23:31.764 --> 02:23:39.691]  And it was all there in the federal grant, just admission of microphones, key logging or word logging, whatever you call it.
[02:23:40.551 --> 02:23:43.914]  And I went on air and covered it, and people couldn't believe it.
[02:23:44.294 --> 02:23:50.239]  Then a week later, the local paper ran a big story whitewashing it, going, no, it's gunshot detector microphones.
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:53.522]  But the grant said it was microphones to listen to people.
[02:23:54.201 --> 02:24:01.405]  And then now, this year, they announced nationwide, they're putting microphones in, hidden in street sculptures.
[02:24:01.885 --> 02:24:14.432]  And it's in the Chicago Tribune, but they don't call it microphones, they go, the data clusters pick up wireless, environmental hazards, and listen to audio for signs of trouble.
[02:24:15.052 --> 02:24:18.355]  So it's just this mainlining of a 1984.
[02:24:18.735 --> 02:24:24.219]  Mr. Binney is a former director of one of the major areas of the NSA.
[02:24:24.239 --> 02:24:29.183]  I mean, microphones hidden is 1984, is it not?
[02:24:29.203 --> 02:24:44.234]  Yes, I mean, and of course it's not just the microphones with the audio and looking at the video, for example, those things, but it's also all the electronic backgrounds that goes with it.
[02:24:44.947 --> 02:25:02.663]  Anything you're carrying with you like a cell phone or any kind of transaction used with any kind of document like your your credit card transactions and all all those kinds of things are all assembled and that all becomes a Profile basically of you and by the way, they keep saying well, we don't build profiles of people.
[02:25:03.344 --> 02:25:05.466]  No, they don't the software does that?
[02:25:05.586 --> 02:25:07.508]  I mean once you put the data in the base and
[02:25:08.209 --> 02:25:11.191]  It builds relationships, and that, in fact, is the profile.
[02:25:11.231 --> 02:25:15.193]  So anytime they want to look at you, all they have to do is point at you and say, give me his profile.
[02:25:15.813 --> 02:25:16.393]  And you get it.
[02:25:17.073 --> 02:25:20.095]  So it's not a matter of them not having it.
[02:25:20.175 --> 02:25:21.976]  They have the profile on everybody.
[02:25:22.785 --> 02:25:23.946]  And it's not done by people.
[02:25:23.966 --> 02:25:25.588]  That's another word game they play.
[02:25:25.608 --> 02:25:28.150]  They play all kinds of word games with people.
[02:25:28.390 --> 02:25:32.934]  You know, it's like, we don't consider anything collected unless the person looks at it.
[02:25:32.994 --> 02:25:37.398]  Well, that doesn't stop them from collecting everything about everybody in the country.
[02:25:37.899 --> 02:25:39.020]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:43.524]  And they're doing it through a program called Fairview, which is the main input program they have.
[02:25:43.564 --> 02:25:44.805]  If you go on the web and do a
[02:25:45.445 --> 02:26:02.821]  A Google on Fairview, you know, and NSA, you'll get the slides that will show you all, there's like 80 to 100 tap points inside the continental United States, the lower 48 states, that show where they're tapping and collecting information off the fiber optic network.
[02:26:04.801 --> 02:26:13.568]  And that was being put in for when I was told and shown by engineers and later confirmed at the telecom hubs all over the country at taxpayer expense.
[02:26:13.629 --> 02:26:19.674]  Whole floors and whole rooms of cable companies, of AT&T, you name it.
[02:26:20.717 --> 02:26:37.041]  With all the data passing through it, just outrageous, and then Bush walking around on TV in 2006 saying, oh, we don't listen to anybody in America, and playing the word game that the computers do when they can go open your profile up.
[02:26:37.501 --> 02:26:40.742]  And see the whole menu of everything you do laid out.
[02:26:40.822 --> 02:26:44.503]  What movies you see, what books you read, all your emails.
[02:26:44.643 --> 02:26:46.624]  Google admits they open your emails and read it.
[02:26:47.004 --> 02:26:58.887]  Sir, what do you make of Amazon and Google and Microsoft and Apple and all of their admissions that they are data mining and using and selling the data?
[02:26:58.907 --> 02:27:00.388]  I mean, it's not just the NSA.
[02:27:01.581 --> 02:27:09.026]  Well, I mean, I look at that also as the same as the... It's not as bad as the government because they can't come arrest you or do violent things to you.
[02:27:09.086 --> 02:27:09.206]  Sure.
[02:27:09.766 --> 02:27:14.429]  But, I mean, it's still a fundamental violation of privacy rights of individuals.
[02:27:15.169 --> 02:27:26.496]  I mean, and that's against, I believe, the Electronic Privacy Acts, Electronic Security Acts, and all that stuff that all were existing laws to try to give privacy to people in their electronic age.
[02:27:26.596 --> 02:27:27.157]  So, I mean...
[02:27:29.610 --> 02:27:33.192]  Fundamentally, I don't think they should be allowed or permitted to do that either.
[02:27:34.172 --> 02:27:35.332]  I totally agree with you.
[02:27:36.133 --> 02:27:49.297]  And expanding on that, what do you make of Kate Upton and all these stars with sex tapes and naked photos that they thought it was safe to send sex videos around or naked photos on an Apple cloud?
[02:27:49.977 --> 02:27:51.958]  What do you make of this whole cloud revolution?
[02:27:52.745 --> 02:27:57.571]  Well, it's just another means of accessing more data about individuals.
[02:27:57.992 --> 02:28:08.466]  I mean, anybody who puts information out there should assume it's being scarfed up by the NSA and then made available to the FBI and DEA and other government agencies.
[02:28:10.442 --> 02:28:22.152]  Are our courts fundamentally now completely bankrupt if for a decade they've been, or more, creating fake cases with data they stole and then they lie and perjure to the court?
[02:28:22.713 --> 02:28:26.316]  I mean, that sounds like most of these convictions should be overturned.
[02:28:26.336 --> 02:28:28.918]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:28:28.978 --> 02:28:38.166]  I mean, and even the Solicitor General had to lie to the Supreme Court to get the case, you know, Amnesty International v. Clapper thrown out.
[02:28:39.238 --> 02:28:44.800]  And that was, again, challenging the issue of NSA collecting all this data without a warrant.
[02:28:45.700 --> 02:28:52.563]  And the Solicitor General lied to the court saying that anybody where this data was used against them, either in a court or wherever, they would be told.
[02:28:53.123 --> 02:28:54.203]  And that was simply a lie.
[02:28:55.064 --> 02:29:01.006]  And so now they're trying to scramble to figure out what to do about that, all the past thousands of cases that they've done this way.
[02:29:02.026 --> 02:29:05.749]  I think they're going to write those off and say, well, that's just collateral damage.
[02:29:06.049 --> 02:29:07.070]  Well, that shouldn't be.
[02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:11.133]  I mean, that's a violation of the Constitution, the foundation of this country.
[02:29:11.533 --> 02:29:19.359]  If our government wants to do that, if they want to violate our Constitution or change it, there's a process to do that, and they should follow that process.
[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:23.763]  Create an amendment, get it past Congress, send it around to the states to ratify.
[02:29:23.783 --> 02:29:25.924]  I mean, that's the procedure we're supposed to do.
[02:29:26.525 --> 02:29:30.468]  But our government is taking a totally different, very, very ugly path.
[02:29:31.482 --> 02:29:34.945]  A totalitarian revolution is really what it is.
[02:29:35.005 --> 02:29:36.527]  William Edward Benny is our guest.
[02:29:36.547 --> 02:29:44.094]  I'm going to come back and ask him about that famous statement of Clapper, the Director of Intelligence, to Congress saying, we don't spout on Americans, we don't collect any data.
[02:29:44.374 --> 02:29:45.895]  That's like saying the sun didn't come up.
[02:29:45.955 --> 02:29:48.238]  I mean, it's just, they're bad guys.
[02:29:48.258 --> 02:29:49.619]  I mean, that's what they are.
[02:29:49.919 --> 02:29:50.500]  They're villains.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:51.821]  It's not being done to protect us.
[02:29:52.441 --> 02:29:56.946]  ExposeFacts.org, William Benny, straight ahead, your calls and more.
[02:29:58.413 --> 02:30:01.399]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.419 --> 02:30:05.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.991 --> 02:30:16.079]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:16.179 --> 02:30:18.322]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:18.522 --> 02:30:23.628]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:23.808 --> 02:30:28.754]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:28.954 --> 02:30:32.015]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:32.275 --> 02:30:36.136]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:36.356 --> 02:30:40.597]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:40.657 --> 02:30:50.680]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:53.421]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:30:53.621 --> 02:31:01.665]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:01.825 --> 02:31:05.787]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:09.173 --> 02:31:15.122]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:31:15.342 --> 02:31:19.528]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:31:19.889 --> 02:31:24.456]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:31:24.876 --> 02:31:27.478]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:32.961]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:31:33.242 --> 02:31:40.106]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:31:40.626 --> 02:31:44.389]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:31:44.749 --> 02:31:49.552]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:49.872 --> 02:31:50.713]  This is innovating.
[02:31:50.993 --> 02:31:58.276]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:02.557]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:02.737 --> 02:32:07.919]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:08.735 --> 02:32:11.117]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:11.217 --> 02:32:17.721]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:32:17.921 --> 02:32:20.503]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:32:20.703 --> 02:32:22.464]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:32:22.644 --> 02:32:24.866]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:32:24.946 --> 02:32:29.149]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[02:32:29.409 --> 02:32:30.430]  I say, so what?
[02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:32.571]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:32:32.791 --> 02:32:35.913]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[02:32:36.154 --> 02:32:40.276]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:32:40.416 --> 02:32:46.100]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:49.302]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[02:32:49.502 --> 02:32:51.204]  The Info War is worldwide.
[02:32:51.324 --> 02:32:55.446]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[02:32:55.647 --> 02:32:59.269]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[02:32:59.349 --> 02:33:06.414]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[02:33:06.594 --> 02:33:08.216]  The truth will set them free!
[02:33:19.404 --> 02:33:23.587]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:24.288 --> 02:33:25.749]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.228 --> 02:33:28.589]  I've been on air 20 years.
[02:33:28.669 --> 02:33:30.009]  It'll be 20 years in about a month.
[02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:46.296]  And by 1996, as a libertarian promoting liberty, I had police chiefs contacting me in major cities, emergency managers, engineers, who were aware of all this stuff going into place behind the scenes.
[02:33:47.917 --> 02:33:51.018]  And I would go on air and talk about it, so I would get sent more data.
[02:33:51.039 --> 02:33:51.879]  Then I got syndicated.
[02:33:53.567 --> 02:34:07.972]  That's the reason I realized how much trouble we were in before a lot of other folks was because a lot of people out there in the system who knew more than I did were basically using me as a conduit to get stuff out of the public.
[02:34:10.253 --> 02:34:14.254]  So I can't take credit for being light years ahead of everybody else.
[02:34:15.970 --> 02:34:17.431]  But now we don't have an excuse.
[02:34:17.491 --> 02:34:30.675]  This stuff is out in the open thanks to heroes like William Edward Benny, who could make a lot of money working for the private contractors and the big companies that are making tens of billions of dollars a year milking this.
[02:34:30.695 --> 02:34:38.038]  800,000 people, the Washington Post reported last year, 840-something thousand, have access to all this spy data.
[02:34:38.358 --> 02:34:41.359]  And I'm no engineer, but I am a geopolitical researcher.
[02:34:42.518 --> 02:34:46.761]  It just sounds like insider trading, people harassing friends and family.
[02:34:47.682 --> 02:34:49.423]  It sounds like a way to corner markets.
[02:34:49.483 --> 02:34:54.107]  It sounds like a way for real terrorists or criminals to know if the good guys are after them.
[02:34:55.027 --> 02:35:05.055]  It just sounds like a devil's workshop on steroids with the helping of PCP to have 800,000 contractors in this.
[02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:08.538]  And now we know the NSA has used this stuff in other agencies.
[02:35:08.938 --> 02:35:11.520]  Remember, this is given to dozens of other agencies, federal and state.
[02:35:13.669 --> 02:35:23.082]  To then just go out and harass their wives, their husbands, their neighbors, their competition to plant stuff under sneak and peek and the Patriot Act on computers.
[02:35:23.362 --> 02:35:28.088]  I mean, it's just a Pandora's box of making us insecure.
[02:35:28.749 --> 02:35:30.270]  And destroying our free market.
[02:35:30.890 --> 02:35:40.555]  Again, I'm not some 200 IQ super brain like William Binney who headed up their major technical department and director of technical intelligence.
[02:35:40.635 --> 02:35:44.818]  I mean, that's the actual, use a Starship Trooper analogy, brain bug.
[02:35:45.358 --> 02:35:52.942]  Okay, but just at my gut level gestalt, sir, did I hit on anything that is important what I just said?
[02:35:54.218 --> 02:35:54.879]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:35:54.939 --> 02:36:04.689]  I mean, that's the whole point is that this is drifting toward a government, a central government that's like J. Edgar Hoover on super steroids.
[02:36:04.789 --> 02:36:12.957]  They have the knowledge and background of virtually everybody in the country and that gives them a basis for blackmail and influence peddling.
[02:36:13.717 --> 02:36:26.701]  So that's the way they can get things done, you know, leverage against individuals to make sure that, like for example, when Nancy Pelosi said impeaching George Bush is off the table, the leverage she had was she was a part of these programs, so she'd have to impeach herself.
[02:36:26.741 --> 02:36:31.983]  So they get everybody to be part of it, including local police, and now they're all part of the cult.
[02:36:32.563 --> 02:36:35.904]  Exactly, and now they all have to defend themselves, otherwise they all fall.
[02:36:38.342 --> 02:36:41.291]  That's how Julius Caesar took over Rome.
[02:36:42.014 --> 02:36:44.983]  Sir, is this not an orchestrated, diabolical plan then?
[02:36:46.498 --> 02:36:54.606]  It sure seems that way, at least it's being done, and the administrations as they come in keep perpetuating it.
[02:36:54.687 --> 02:37:08.120]  Well, I mean, from Russ Tice, who was a former, also an NSA whistleblower, he has been saying that for a long time that they've been transcribing phone calls and conversations and emails of U.S.
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:09.561]  Representatives and Senators.
[02:37:10.482 --> 02:37:13.706]  And judges in the federal courts as well as the Supreme Court.
[02:37:13.767 --> 02:37:14.668]  Well, that's now come out.
[02:37:14.708 --> 02:37:16.370]  The CIA is spying on the Senate.
[02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:18.853]  Yep, and that's just CIA.
[02:37:18.933 --> 02:37:20.595]  NSA is much more powerful at that.
[02:37:20.695 --> 02:37:26.463]  That just means that they're assembling all that blackmail information for leverage.
[02:37:28.058 --> 02:37:48.034]  And correct me if I'm wrong, doesn't having 800,000 contractors, just contractors, hooked into this, that, I mean, if I wanted to bring down a government or a country, I would let 800,000 people have access to this panopticon type system because it would then leak everywhere and then the country would be insecure.
[02:37:48.114 --> 02:37:53.719]  I mean, this sounds like the opposite of what I would want to do if I wanted to have a secure, safe country.
[02:37:55.322 --> 02:37:56.683]  Yeah, that's exactly correct.
[02:37:56.743 --> 02:38:02.706]  I mean, I objected to this in the late 90s when they first started doing this, outsourcing to contractors.
[02:38:03.346 --> 02:38:14.793]  I was objecting to it then because I didn't think it was a smart idea to do that, just under the principle of exporting, you know, giving away your trade secrets as a business to other companies.
[02:38:15.773 --> 02:38:21.717]  And that's fundamentally what it is, that you're giving away the trade secrets, how you acquire data, how you look at data, that kind of thing.
[02:38:21.737 --> 02:38:24.038]  And that's exposed to all these contractors.
[02:38:27.923 --> 02:38:35.404]  And imagine how easy it is for foreign states and foreign corporations to then penetrate and compromise the contractors.
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:36.760]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:38.781]  That's happened any number of times down through history.
[02:38:38.801 --> 02:38:43.824]  I mean, that is a kind of a weakness that, I mean, they could even hire the contractors, too.
[02:38:43.884 --> 02:38:49.807]  You know, later on, after their contracts were done with NSA, they could hire them as contractors over their way, too.
[02:38:49.907 --> 02:38:56.090]  Although, you know, they do have a non-disclosure agreement that says they won't disclose anything they've discussed.
[02:38:56.190 --> 02:39:02.954]  I mean, they take with them the knowledge of what they experienced while they were there, and they can apply that knowledge and techniques to other things.
[02:39:03.595 --> 02:39:03.855]  Incredibly.
[02:39:13.587 --> 02:39:15.748]  It's amazing to get your insight here on air.
[02:39:16.728 --> 02:39:18.229]  William Benny is our guest.
[02:39:18.869 --> 02:39:28.293]  I want to go to some phone calls, 800-259-9231, specifically questions for the highest level NSA whistleblower of all time.
[02:39:28.753 --> 02:39:33.595]  He was in the top four position there, some say even the number three position, the director
[02:39:34.656 --> 02:39:37.461]  The technical leader for intelligence with the NSA.
[02:39:37.481 --> 02:39:42.229]  I have a whole bunch of Twitter questions from real Alex Jones here for you, sir.
[02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:47.497]  But first off, anything else you'd like to add before we go to these calls?
[02:39:49.271 --> 02:39:55.320]  I just think we as a country and we as a people need to decide whether or not we're going to continue to tolerate this.
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:56.221]  I don't think we should.
[02:39:56.261 --> 02:40:01.068]  I mean, this is not consistent with our founding principles.
[02:40:01.128 --> 02:40:05.815]  We need to make this a major issue in the upcoming election in November.
[02:40:06.448 --> 02:40:20.455]  And when the politicians come around to solicit your votes and talk to you and all, you should raise these issues with them and say, look, if you don't start facing up and starting to live and protect and defend the Constitution, we are going to fire you.
[02:40:20.475 --> 02:40:23.577]  And we need to pass that message to them very strongly.
[02:40:23.637 --> 02:40:27.519]  Otherwise, they're going to sit there and drift along and do whatever they want to do.
[02:40:27.579 --> 02:40:29.100]  You have to threaten them with their job.
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:30.921]  That's the only thing that'll make them do anything.
[02:40:33.331 --> 02:40:34.712]  That's what I think we need to do.
[02:40:34.732 --> 02:40:36.393]  I mean, I don't see any other way out of this.
[02:40:36.833 --> 02:40:37.053]  Sure.
[02:40:38.333 --> 02:40:39.954]  I totally agree with your statement there.
[02:40:41.435 --> 02:40:55.482]  RC Patterson asked on Twitter, he says, Mr. Benny, any advice on how to mess or scramble the profile data with NSA is doing on us, i.e., web credit, purchase, etc.?
[02:40:55.582 --> 02:40:57.963]  I would just say everyone always thinks about how to get around it.
[02:40:58.988 --> 02:41:08.953]  How about we politically change it and stop the whole thing that's wrong, but until we get there, what would you do to protect your private information?
[02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:24.760]  Actually, I do absolutely nothing, and the reason is because there's virtually... I'm a target, and so there's virtually nothing I could do anyway, so anything they wanted to get from me, they could actively attack my computer to get it, or
[02:41:26.471 --> 02:41:32.034]  You know, doing other sneak-and-peek kind of invasions of my house like the FBI normally does.
[02:41:32.074 --> 02:41:37.577]  They do sneak-and-peeks to implant things in the house to listen to you and all that kind of stuff.
[02:41:37.597 --> 02:41:42.120]  So I know I'm a target, so therefore I don't really try to do anything at all.
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:46.242]  In fact, I don't want to because I want them to know everything I'm saying about them.
[02:41:47.003 --> 02:41:47.743]  I'm the same way.
[02:41:47.763 --> 02:41:49.104]  I have the exact same policy.
[02:41:50.825 --> 02:41:54.887]  Well, so I really don't know what anybody could individually do.
[02:41:54.907 --> 02:41:55.848]  I mean, I wouldn't
[02:41:57.213 --> 02:42:03.298]  As long as you don't make, as long as you don't become visible to them for some reason or other, they won't target you.
[02:42:03.338 --> 02:42:04.860]  I don't think they'll look at your profile.
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:10.104]  But if you do something that they irritate them, they'll call up your profile and start looking at you.
[02:42:10.364 --> 02:42:15.889]  So I don't, and I'm not sure really, I mean you could try to use Tor.
[02:42:15.969 --> 02:42:17.210]  Tor is an annoyance to them.
[02:42:17.450 --> 02:42:20.733]  It helps anonymize what you're doing on the web.
[02:42:21.592 --> 02:42:23.657]  That is some impediment.
[02:42:23.737 --> 02:42:25.261]  It causes them some difficulty.
[02:42:25.642 --> 02:42:28.811]  And if they target you, of course, they can go around that.
[02:42:29.775 --> 02:42:38.398]  So one way to do it is jamming it with disinformation, garbage, just creating totally random profiles, just doing weird things.
[02:42:38.758 --> 02:42:45.620]  That'll create kind of plaques of clouds that will, I think, alter the profile.
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:46.480]  But I'd say let it.
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:56.643]  Look, it's criminal, it's illegal, and have the profile full of stuff exposing them so they're aware with their sample rate just how many people are awake to them.
[02:42:57.145 --> 02:42:59.247]  Yeah, that's what I try to do.
[02:42:59.287 --> 02:43:05.131]  I make sure anything I say, if I refer to them, I refer to them in a way that makes it perfectly clear what I think of them.
[02:43:06.752 --> 02:43:09.934]  Well, it's organized crime in a revolution against our civilization.
[02:43:09.954 --> 02:43:11.415]  I mean, do you agree with that statement?
[02:43:11.435 --> 02:43:18.961]  They have organized in a racketeering operation to openly violate everyone's rights en masse, lie about it, get caught, and keep lying.
[02:43:20.182 --> 02:43:23.684]  Well, that certainly is an analogy that would work.
[02:43:23.764 --> 02:43:35.633]  I mean, I don't think they've taken the final step, like they haven't gotten what the Stasi does, like incarcerate you, but they discredit you and kind of try to embarrass you and get you out of the way.
[02:43:35.653 --> 02:43:39.415]  They just don't put you in the gulag or something, you know?
[02:43:39.916 --> 02:43:41.497]  That step has not been taken yet.
[02:43:41.877 --> 02:43:43.818]  Well, they're starting to try.
[02:43:44.219 --> 02:43:45.940]  Yeah, that doesn't mean it can't be.
[02:43:47.259 --> 02:43:47.720]  Absolutely.
[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:49.261]  Look at Dinesh D'Souza and his film.
[02:43:50.142 --> 02:43:51.323]  Let's go to a phone call again.
[02:43:51.383 --> 02:43:53.645]  William Benny, who is a real hero, is our guest.
[02:43:54.085 --> 02:43:55.186]  Catherine has a question.
[02:43:55.206 --> 02:43:55.567]  Go ahead.
[02:43:57.182 --> 02:43:58.043]  Yeah, actually I do.
[02:43:58.083 --> 02:43:59.623]  I have a question for Mr. Benny.
[02:44:00.224 --> 02:44:10.109]  I'm from Canada, which is not from USA, but geopolitically speaking, I'm scared that Russia's going to trench over the border.
[02:44:10.169 --> 02:44:13.672]  There's no oceans, there's no nothing to stop them.
[02:44:14.032 --> 02:44:19.615]  Should we be worried in Canada about Russia marching over the Arctic?
[02:44:19.815 --> 02:44:23.523]  Mr. Benny, you have had some things to say recently about the Russia situation.
[02:44:23.884 --> 02:44:26.730]  Russia is saying that they may take part of the Arctic that borders them.
[02:44:27.191 --> 02:44:30.539]  I don't see Russia in an offensive mode right now, but maybe you can correct me.
[02:44:32.064 --> 02:44:36.906]  No, I don't, but this is also one of my very... I'm actually an NSA advocate, okay?
[02:44:38.146 --> 02:44:41.307]  But I'm an advocate in the form of doing the right thing.
[02:44:41.588 --> 02:44:59.074]  Now, what's happened is when they went to this bulk acquisition of data that diverted the effort and intensity and investigation into areas that aren't relevant to anything that's important, and that takes away from other areas, like being able to watch the militaries of the Russians or any other country.
[02:45:00.014 --> 02:45:10.080]  And it reduces the capacity to do intelligence and to acquire and smartly assemble intelligence about those targets.
[02:45:10.801 --> 02:45:15.444]  So, that's hurting our ability to understand what they're doing or what they're intending to do.
[02:45:15.464 --> 02:45:18.526]  Well, that's what I was saying earlier, just as a layperson.
[02:45:18.826 --> 02:45:23.809]  When you're spying on 320 million Americans, how on earth could you be watching the Russians?
[02:45:25.185 --> 02:45:25.705]  That's the point.
[02:45:25.725 --> 02:45:27.466]  But actually, it's even worse than that, though.
[02:45:28.847 --> 02:45:35.611]  It's probably on the order of somewhere between 3 and 4.5 billion people around the world.
[02:45:35.651 --> 02:45:36.751]  300 plus million U.S.
[02:45:36.791 --> 02:45:40.853]  citizens, but the rest of the people in the world, too.
[02:45:40.873 --> 02:45:43.535]  That's really the thing that's destroying the capacity.
[02:45:43.555 --> 02:45:49.678]  You need to have a rich environment of information that's relevant to assess something that's ongoing.
[02:45:50.407 --> 02:45:51.388]  Or that's impending.
[02:45:51.769 --> 02:45:55.313]  And if you don't have that, it becomes very difficult to succeed.
[02:45:57.275 --> 02:45:59.057]  Which is what the globalists want.
[02:45:59.097 --> 02:46:01.660]  This is a sabotage plan against this country, in my view.
[02:46:02.381 --> 02:46:05.645]  Let's talk to David from Florida.
[02:46:05.665 --> 02:46:06.626]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:46:06.666 --> 02:46:07.627]  Question for William Benning.
[02:46:08.931 --> 02:46:15.174]  Hey, Mr. Benny, Mr. Jones, I really appreciate you immensely for your contributions to our society.
[02:46:15.214 --> 02:46:30.643]  I just wanted to mention that we've got Russia on the West, you know, really intensifying in Archangelou, where they put together a large part of their revenue to develop the largest world oil platform to go into the Bering Sea and the Antarctic.
[02:46:30.923 --> 02:46:33.444]  And let's face it, the Antarctic has the largest
[02:46:35.532 --> 02:46:38.514]  Troves of oil and gas, you know, on the planet.
[02:46:38.974 --> 02:46:52.661]  And we've got to back up a little bit because we know that Hitler and the whole World War II was put together in a deal because it was all CIA-based and we put all... I understand, but specifically, what is your question for the guest?
[02:46:53.382 --> 02:46:54.242]  My question is this.
[02:46:54.342 --> 02:47:00.646]  We put together all those Nazis into a place called Little America 4 in Antarctic.
[02:47:01.186 --> 02:47:02.366]  And I just want to know
[02:47:03.883 --> 02:47:05.865]  What do you think the outcome is going to be?
[02:47:05.885 --> 02:47:12.531]  Because the endgame, I think, is actually that the Russians, when the endgame comes, they're going for Antarctica.
[02:47:12.951 --> 02:47:14.493]  Well, they said they're getting ready to go for it.
[02:47:14.513 --> 02:47:15.233]  Look, I gotta go.
[02:47:15.253 --> 02:47:16.274]  We have a little bit of time.
[02:47:16.675 --> 02:47:18.216]  These are specific questions for Mr. Benning.
[02:47:18.756 --> 02:47:27.624]  You did join the intelligence professionals earlier last week, I know, I'm looking for the article, and basically came out and said that
[02:47:28.285 --> 02:47:29.508]  What is your take on Ukraine and Russia, sir?
[02:47:37.312 --> 02:47:42.074]  It looks like the Russians are playing a saber-rattling game.
[02:47:42.134 --> 02:47:43.575]  It's not really an invasion.
[02:47:43.715 --> 02:48:03.162]  I mean, if you had an invasion, like I was involved in analyzing all the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, if you're preparing to have an invasion or you're going to have something, then you've got to be there with a lot, in the case of Ukraine anyway, with a lot more in terms of capabilities, in terms of personnel and equipment.
[02:48:03.262 --> 02:48:06.043]  I mean, you can't just do it with the few tens of thousands they have.
[02:48:06.778 --> 02:48:09.660]  So, the point is, it's not really an invasion.
[02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:13.543]  What they're doing is playing games along the border and saber-rattling.
[02:48:14.163 --> 02:48:20.087]  The point is, I tend to agree with the President here that this needs to be solved diplomatically.
[02:48:20.942 --> 02:48:24.963]  And I believe that that's the correct route, rather than try to go to confrontation.
[02:48:25.023 --> 02:48:29.585]  I mean, I don't think the Russians... The Russians feel very threatened by the expansion of NATO.
[02:48:29.645 --> 02:48:30.565]  No kidding?
[02:48:30.725 --> 02:48:32.906]  And I would say, well, okay, fine.
[02:48:34.406 --> 02:48:37.687]  If you look at it from their perspective, they have some concern.
[02:48:37.867 --> 02:48:40.668]  Well, okay, why don't we invite them into NATO?
[02:48:41.610 --> 02:48:45.533]  Why don't we get all of us together in a mutual defense treaty?
[02:48:45.873 --> 02:48:47.474]  Instead of always fighting with each other?
[02:48:47.554 --> 02:48:52.377]  Instead of fighting with each other and looking and acting like they are really a threat.
[02:48:52.657 --> 02:48:55.319]  Why don't we include them instead of excluding them?
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:59.662]  Here's another question from Mike Headsroom on Twitter.
[02:49:00.463 --> 02:49:04.205]  He wants to ask you, Mr. Binney, has the NSA managed to break SSL?
[02:49:04.966 --> 02:49:06.967]  What is your preferred encryption algorithm?
[02:49:10.557 --> 02:49:17.801]  I don't believe any commercially available encryption system is necessarily safe.
[02:49:18.301 --> 02:49:19.561]  Of course, yeah.
[02:49:19.842 --> 02:49:30.127]  Simply because of the backdoors and the weakening that the NSA has done through a Bull Run program that's been part of the Snowden exposure.
[02:49:30.734 --> 02:49:33.877]  They had the Bull Run program to weaken all the encryption systems.
[02:49:33.917 --> 02:49:38.180]  That simply meant to give them weaknesses in the keys or in the way keys are generated.
[02:49:38.220 --> 02:49:40.742]  Well, don't they just pressure the developers to give them back doors?
[02:49:40.902 --> 02:49:41.703]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:49:41.803 --> 02:49:42.443]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:49:42.523 --> 02:49:43.324]  And that's how they get it.
[02:49:43.985 --> 02:49:54.733]  And my point is that you can take some very simple... You could use whatever is commercially available as a kind of a community cipher that you could use.
[02:49:54.833 --> 02:49:58.256]  But underneath that, you have to come up with some variation of your own.
[02:49:58.931 --> 02:50:05.334]  So that when they go through assuming that they have the right keys and everything with their when they're breaking all these things they end up with a mess.
[02:50:05.794 --> 02:50:06.055]  Wow.
[02:50:06.455 --> 02:50:28.526]  So that it's basically layers of complexity is what I'm and one of those layers can be a very simple thing like you simply take the binary stream of a text that you're trying to encrypt and just transpose the bits in a pattern and that destroys the integrity of the text so that even if they have the correct key coming through the different layers of encryption for for you
[02:50:29.491 --> 02:50:33.473]  They still end up with that transposed mess and they can't recognize it.
[02:50:33.593 --> 02:50:48.519]  So that's one way of that that I had to propose the defeating bulk or the brute force attack on a system just assuming a whole trillions of keys and going through keys and trying to see if you get any partial text.
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:50.340]  Well, in that case,
[02:50:51.380 --> 02:51:01.412]  If you do that bit transposition, that destroys the integrity so that any partial text you would get under any key assumption under that brute force attack would be absolutely wrong.
[02:51:01.652 --> 02:51:02.173]  Amazing.
[02:51:02.233 --> 02:51:02.633]  Stay there.
[02:51:02.713 --> 02:51:03.414]  This is incredible.
[02:51:03.434 --> 02:51:05.717]  We have more questions straight ahead.
[02:51:05.777 --> 02:51:07.159]  How secure is Blackphone?
[02:51:07.179 --> 02:51:08.140]  And more.
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:08.761]  Stay with us.
[02:51:09.301 --> 02:51:11.882]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:51:12.022 --> 02:51:16.023]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:51:16.323 --> 02:51:17.564]  SilverLungs.com.
[02:51:17.724 --> 02:51:20.204]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:51:20.404 --> 02:51:23.185]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:51:23.385 --> 02:51:25.526]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[02:51:25.746 --> 02:51:27.487]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:51:27.647 --> 02:51:32.968]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:51:33.208 --> 02:51:36.889]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[02:51:37.009 --> 02:51:38.510]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:51:39.450 --> 02:51:43.673]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[02:54:11.588 --> 02:54:13.630]  Alright, final segment in the full broadcast.
[02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:17.913]  Mr. Benny's agreed to do five more minutes with us into overdrive to finish these phone calls.
[02:54:18.354 --> 02:54:22.297]  Tyler, Lance, Melissa, Cee, Lee and others that are holding.
[02:54:22.337 --> 02:54:26.420]  I got a bunch of questions that have come in at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:28.122]  But look at this CNET News headline.
[02:54:28.562 --> 02:54:31.624]  Robot couch can drive you to the fridge and back.
[02:54:32.405 --> 02:54:34.467]  As if this country isn't already obese enough.
[02:54:36.038 --> 02:54:38.519]  Next they're going to have toilets in the couch like idiocracy.
[02:54:38.899 --> 02:54:42.181]  People need to really wake up and stop just going along to get along.
[02:54:43.161 --> 02:54:48.223]  And just because the majority of folks want to be decadent slobs doesn't mean the rest of us have to be slaves to this.
[02:54:48.263 --> 02:54:51.424]  William Binney, top NSA whistleblower, is our guest.
[02:54:51.864 --> 02:55:02.029]  Truth Justice Liberty on Twitter handle Occupy Earth Now says, do you know anything about Israel having direct access to NSA data?
[02:55:02.449 --> 02:55:03.809]  I know some of the phone company
[02:55:05.530 --> 02:55:13.396]  Caller ID systems do go back to Israel, and then that goes back to the infiltration via contractors by other governments.
[02:55:13.616 --> 02:55:14.476]  William Binney?
[02:55:17.659 --> 02:55:29.287]  There are of course international relationships, and of course that's been published again by the Stoughton material that they have relationships with Israel, but in general the
[02:55:30.595 --> 02:55:37.519]  Any exchange of information between any of those parties is done separately.
[02:55:37.719 --> 02:55:43.421]  No one has free access to one another's database, but those things are held kind of privately.
[02:55:44.002 --> 02:55:47.964]  If they want to share something, they put it off on a separate data set.
[02:55:49.198 --> 02:55:54.021]  Sure.
[02:55:54.161 --> 02:55:56.442]  We just saw the hack of the Apple Cloud.
[02:55:57.563 --> 02:56:01.245]  I wonder if there's been hacks of the CIA or NSA that we don't know about?
[02:56:09.568 --> 02:56:12.030]  And I think, for the most part, they do.
[02:56:12.150 --> 02:56:15.733]  But, you know, it's really, I mean, how many things are certain in this life?
[02:56:16.254 --> 02:56:17.875]  You know, that's the problem.
[02:56:18.235 --> 02:56:20.737]  They have very bad documentation of their network.
[02:56:21.698 --> 02:56:30.505]  In other words, one of the main things you have to do to ensure cybersecurity is you've got to have good documentation of your network.
[02:56:31.726 --> 02:56:36.470]  And that will tell you how people could access any of your components inside your system.
[02:56:37.488 --> 02:56:45.213]  And then you need to define what you want to protect, and then you surround and build within your system a protection system, you know, covering that.
[02:56:46.273 --> 02:56:49.975]  But those are two things that most agencies in the U.S.
[02:56:50.036 --> 02:56:50.956]  government do not have.
[02:56:50.996 --> 02:56:53.878]  They don't have a good set of documentation on their network.
[02:56:54.258 --> 02:56:55.579]  Sure, plus a lot of the chips.
[02:56:55.719 --> 02:56:55.939]  No.
[02:56:57.380 --> 02:56:58.560]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:58.581 --> 02:57:02.943]  But I mean, they have designed it that they wanted it closed.
[02:57:03.023 --> 02:57:06.065]  Now whether it effectively is, is another question, okay?
[02:57:09.164 --> 02:57:12.766]  Well, I can't really say for sure what is and what isn't there.
[02:57:13.767 --> 02:57:15.749]  Tyler in California, you're on the air.
[02:57:15.809 --> 02:57:16.209]  Go ahead.
[02:57:17.230 --> 02:57:18.070]  Hey there, gentlemen.
[02:57:18.611 --> 02:57:23.454]  I had a question for Mr. Benny, and obviously I have probably a million questions I could talk about.
[02:57:23.474 --> 02:57:23.855]  That's fine.
[02:57:23.875 --> 02:57:25.016]  Go ahead and throw your question out.
[02:57:25.536 --> 02:57:35.343]  Most important thing with the anniversary coming up of 9-11, I think that we need to look into what's going on with the continuity of government.
[02:57:35.503 --> 02:57:37.305]  And I'd like to know Mr. Benny's opinion.
[02:57:38.368 --> 02:57:38.949]  Um, yes.
[02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.710]  Sure.
[02:57:39.770 --> 02:57:42.153]  What about coup d'etat by COG?
[02:57:42.513 --> 02:57:44.075]  Kind of a reverse Valkyrie.
[02:57:44.415 --> 02:57:51.944]  We know that FEMA and others have basically set up their own governing system in the name of COG, but then that can be used to have a coup against the people.
[02:57:53.265 --> 02:57:56.709]  Well, I of course would certainly not hope that that would never happen.
[02:57:56.729 --> 02:57:57.991]  I mean, uh...
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:04.624]  You have to do, of course, you have to have ways and means of protecting yourself, that's for sure.
[02:58:04.724 --> 02:58:20.679]  I mean, and I believe that the, for example, the Congress has a police force that guards them, which in case of CIA, if they really wanted to do something that I don't think would be effectively an effective deterrent,
[02:58:22.867 --> 02:58:31.616]  But most of the people I know in CIA or any of these other organizations, at least the people at the working level, would never tolerate any kind of move like that.
[02:58:31.636 --> 02:58:36.461]  I mean, these people are really, most of them are very dedicated, honest, patriotic people.
[02:58:36.481 --> 02:58:37.422]  They would never do that.
[02:58:37.542 --> 02:58:37.983]  Exactly.
[02:58:38.003 --> 02:58:39.665]  They're compartmentalized, though.
[02:58:39.685 --> 02:58:43.569]  Yeah, it's the management of these agencies that's a real problem.
[02:58:43.969 --> 02:58:44.530]  Absolutely.
[02:58:44.590 --> 02:58:45.651]  How do we deal with that?
[02:58:45.671 --> 02:58:48.215]  We're going to come back in one minute in overdrive.
[02:58:48.515 --> 02:58:55.244]  William Benny, exposefacts.org is the whistleblower website with he and other hero whistleblowers.
[02:58:55.644 --> 02:58:57.366]  William Benny, exposefacts.org
[02:58:59.463 --> 02:59:05.406]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:59:05.626 --> 02:59:09.809]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:59:10.189 --> 02:59:14.771]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:59:15.172 --> 02:59:17.773]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:59:18.093 --> 02:59:23.236]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:59:23.536 --> 02:59:30.419]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:59:30.919 --> 02:59:34.680]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:59:35.041 --> 02:59:39.842]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:40.163 --> 02:59:41.003]  This is innovating.
[02:59:41.303 --> 02:59:48.610]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:59:48.770 --> 02:59:52.853]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:59:53.054 --> 02:59:58.599]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:59.940 --> 03:00:02.862]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.523 --> 03:00:06.746]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:19.185]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.825 --> 03:00:20.626]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.407 --> 03:00:22.288]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.969 --> 03:00:26.573]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.153 --> 03:00:31.218]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:42.568 --> 03:00:44.090]  Very exciting, talking to Mr. Binning.
[03:00:44.110 --> 03:00:45.611]  He might be able to write a book soon.
[03:00:46.612 --> 03:00:47.853]  Can't wait to have him on about that.
[03:00:47.953 --> 03:00:49.054]  William Binning is our guest.
[03:00:49.474 --> 03:00:50.575]  We're taking phone calls.
[03:00:50.995 --> 03:00:53.597]  Lance in Washington has a question.
[03:00:53.817 --> 03:00:55.118]  Go ahead, very quickly, please.
[03:00:56.159 --> 03:00:59.442]  Yes, Mr. Binning, thank you for being an informed warrior for this planet.
[03:00:59.662 --> 03:01:00.402]  You're a true patriot.
[03:01:01.633 --> 03:01:07.557]  I was just wondering if Obamacare and all the other agencies, do they actually know what their right hand is doing?
[03:01:07.577 --> 03:01:09.238]  You know, the left and the right hand?
[03:01:09.258 --> 03:01:10.619]  Oh, that's a good question.
[03:01:10.659 --> 03:01:16.562]  I mean, Obamacare admittedly surveils all your medical records and it just seems like everything is some new data snoop.
[03:01:18.203 --> 03:01:22.546]  Yes, I don't believe they have, it's not really, it's such a mess.
[03:01:22.686 --> 03:01:25.608]  I don't think they're really that coordinated, but you know,
[03:01:27.041 --> 03:01:36.511]  I think they certainly are trying to do something, but I think it's again a matter of collecting information on individuals.
[03:01:36.851 --> 03:01:41.115]  That's really what their whole objective is.
[03:01:41.135 --> 03:01:47.341]  I just think they're not very competent individuals at doing this kind of activity.
[03:01:48.682 --> 03:01:49.183]  I really don't.
[03:01:49.383 --> 03:01:51.245]  I don't think they have the competence to do it.
[03:01:53.072 --> 03:01:55.773]  EndPRISM on Twitter asked you this question.
[03:01:56.213 --> 03:01:59.113]  He says, is PRISM a weapon against the people of the United States?
[03:01:59.513 --> 03:02:00.253]  How is it a weapon?
[03:02:00.293 --> 03:02:13.536]  I would expand that question and simply say, is the NSA now basically operating as an enemy of freedom in this country in a corporate government management coup of the nation?
[03:02:15.696 --> 03:02:21.317]  I would say they are based fundamentally, if you look at it from a constitutional point, that that's exactly what's happening.
[03:02:23.095 --> 03:02:24.596]  All right, there's your answer.
[03:02:25.577 --> 03:02:29.099]  Let's go to Woody in Washington, one of the last callers for William Benning.
[03:02:29.119 --> 03:02:29.539]  Go ahead.
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:31.361]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:31.401 --> 03:02:35.683]  Mr. Benning, what's the extent of spying on our foreign leaders like Merkel?
[03:02:36.344 --> 03:02:39.746]  I know some news came out about that when Merkel was being spied on.
[03:02:39.926 --> 03:02:45.590]  And secondly, are you familiar with the program Maine Corps that was instituted under the Reagan administration?
[03:02:47.211 --> 03:02:48.372]  I'm sorry, could you say that again?
[03:02:48.492 --> 03:02:49.793]  He wants to know about Maine Corps.
[03:02:50.789 --> 03:02:53.030]  No, I'm not familiar with that.
[03:02:53.130 --> 03:03:00.153]  But as a general rule, leadership is always the target.
[03:03:01.634 --> 03:03:07.116]  So the leadership of basically any country in the world is always the target.
[03:03:07.156 --> 03:03:13.859]  I think their security will tell them that they are a target and warn them to ensure that
[03:03:14.557 --> 03:03:15.458]  Sure.
[03:03:15.498 --> 03:03:21.443]  They're covered and also provide the means to help them secure their communications.
[03:03:21.783 --> 03:03:26.387]  Sure, they even had Bush take his own toilet around with him because foreign governments wanted to get that.
[03:03:26.887 --> 03:03:27.387]  Yeah, sure.
[03:03:27.427 --> 03:03:29.149]  They want to know everything they possibly can.
[03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:31.531]  I mean, it's not unique to the United States.
[03:03:32.191 --> 03:03:37.656]  Every country, every government, every leader of the world is targeted.
[03:03:38.837 --> 03:03:39.938]  Alright, one last caller.
[03:03:39.978 --> 03:03:42.660]  Sorry to Melissa, we're going to C in Texas.
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:43.881]  You're on the air with William Benning.
[03:03:45.117 --> 03:03:45.657]  Hey, Alex.
[03:03:45.677 --> 03:03:46.278]  Hey, William.
[03:03:46.338 --> 03:03:47.159]  Thanks for being there.
[03:03:47.639 --> 03:03:49.160]  Alex, by the way, I'm a really good friend of Pat's.
[03:03:50.081 --> 03:03:52.863]  Hey, Mr. Benny, do you feel it will ever get to a point
[03:03:53.493 --> 03:04:16.809]  Where the fact that it's so easy for people to go in and manipulate data and possibly change up all sorts of facts on people's Facebook pages and social network sites where it just becomes so obvious to everybody that there could be plausible deniability by those people that they're actually spying on to come forward and say things so they're not blackmailed anymore.
[03:04:17.349 --> 03:04:19.651]  It just seems to me that they're reaching a point of
[03:04:20.282 --> 03:04:24.044]  You know, a critical mass, where they're hubris is almost a herculean... Sure.
[03:04:24.064 --> 03:04:25.625]  That is really an excellent question.
[03:04:25.665 --> 03:04:27.746]  We know they're using these systems to plant things.
[03:04:28.186 --> 03:04:30.828]  Won't that call into question the entire court system?
[03:04:30.848 --> 03:04:31.208]  You name it.
[03:04:31.808 --> 03:04:32.288]  Absolutely.
[03:04:32.308 --> 03:04:34.189]  I mean, that's what they did against us.
[03:04:34.289 --> 03:04:35.950]  They fabricated evidence.
[03:04:36.971 --> 03:04:39.532]  From factual evidence that they had assembled about us.
[03:04:40.092 --> 03:04:42.073]  They fabricated a charge against us.
[03:04:42.314 --> 03:04:46.896]  And that's basically what... The unfortunate part for them is that I caught them at it.
[03:04:47.685 --> 03:04:50.086]  That's the only reason I'm not in jail now, by the way.
[03:04:50.686 --> 03:04:51.487]  You're just a hero.
[03:04:51.547 --> 03:04:52.387]  I just keep saying that.
[03:04:52.427 --> 03:04:53.428]  You've got so much courage.
[03:04:53.488 --> 03:04:56.889]  I want to get you back up as soon as you can to tell your story, sir.
[03:04:57.169 --> 03:05:01.631]  You just tirelessly are out there working for all of us, traveling the country at your own expense.
[03:05:02.351 --> 03:05:03.952]  I just can't wait till you get a book out.
[03:05:04.492 --> 03:05:05.713]  God bless you, William Benny.
[03:05:05.753 --> 03:05:06.994]  I'll say bye to you during the break.
[03:05:07.014 --> 03:05:07.774]  Just amazing.
[03:05:09.861 --> 03:05:15.625]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.
[03:05:15.845 --> 03:05:16.985]  We thank you for listening.
