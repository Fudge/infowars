[00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:08.349]  Look at what the NSA surveillance boss just said about this.
[00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.311]  He said that the NSA has defined U.S.
[00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:19.137]  surveillance programs as part of a noble mission to protect the nation, and that any reports about what they're doing are simply sensationalized.
[00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:28.184]  Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA, said that not only was their mission noble, but that reports about what they're doing have been sensationalized.
[00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:32.687]  Well, there is absolutely nothing about a secret shadow government
[00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:34.475]  That is breaking the law.
[00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.096]  He's lied to Congress.
[00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.877]  He and James Clapper have lied to Congress about what they're doing.
[00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.078]  They're breaking the law.
[00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:42.940]  They're simply criminals who don't think they're subject to the law.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.304]  And we've seen how the NSA is using PRISM in conjunction with large Internet companies.
[00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:52.586]  But you're not even safe if you stay away from the Internet.
[00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.608]  We now learn that there are backdoors even in your computer processor.
[00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.371]  Take a look at this clip from Intel talking about their new generation of processors.
[00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:15.260]  Unlike software-only solutions that require PCs to be powered on and software agents running on a fully functional OS, a hardware-assisted approach enables PCs to be managed regardless of system state and without requiring software agents.
[00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:17.101]  The result?
[00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:31.196]  IT or IT service providers can diagnose and fix problems without a deskside visit, schedule PCs to power down at night to cut energy costs, and still have the ability to power them up for off-hours patching.
[00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:35.079]  So Intel reported about that, but it went again largely unnoticed.
[00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.802]  But in this article we have today on InfoWars, secret 3G Intel chip
[00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:39.723]  I think so.
[00:01:57.498 --> 00:02:02.062]  So it can individually turn on hardware components, and it can access anything on your computer.
[00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:04.124]  And it allows third parties to do this.
[00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:08.989]  In that video that you just saw, Intel is bragging about how it can be used for system management.
[00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:13.092]  And of course, like any technology, it can be used for good purposes or for bad purposes.
[00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:19.699]  But we've already seen how the NSA uses all the technology that it gets for evil purposes, for spying on people.
[00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.260]  It points out that the webcams can also be remotely accessed.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.581]  So any third party, and you can bet that an interested third party, is going to be the NSA.
[00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:38.723]  And, as a former NSA director said just ten days ago, they want to see our internet, he wants to see our internet, look more like China's.
[00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.263]  He said it's too much like the Wild West.
[00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:41.863]  Well, you know what?
[00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:47.085]  In the Wild West, in America's frontier past, we had respect for individual liberty.
[00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:48.785]  Not in China.
[00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:55.271]  If the government in China doesn't like what you're saying, they can grab you and force you to confess your crimes in public.
[00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.634]  Well, it's not just Internet dissenters that they're cracking down on in China.
[00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:03.156]  Of course, they crack down on people who are dissenting apart from the Internet.
[00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:07.139]  People who are speaking out about human rights violations against forced abortions.
[00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:15.565]  Now we're seeing the same pattern in the United States and in the UK, where they're going after dissenters and shutting them down or preventing them from speaking.
