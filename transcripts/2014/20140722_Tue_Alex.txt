[00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:10.228]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:11.829]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.369]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.612]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.741]  Well, I've got to say it, my head is spinning right now.
[00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:53.243]  The news is just unbelievable, off the charts, right now on this Tuesday, the 22nd day of July, 2014 Global Transmission.
[00:00:53.243 --> 00:01:00.645]  We've got one guest joining us in the one o'clock hour, and that is the mother
[00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:05.757]  By the man who's in jail accused of creating and running the Silk Road website.
[00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:10.699]  And the reason that's so important, she's in studio too, isn't she?
[00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:11.279]  On Skype.
[00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.960]  She's here in Austin.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:29.484]  Is that they could say if someone was talking about violence on my message board on PrisonPlanet.com or commenting on Infowars.com about violence that I'm guilty and that the whole media system is guilty here.
[00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:35.856]  Under this precedent they're trying to set.
[00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:56.626]  And police have been caught, especially in Seattle doing this, it even came out in mainstream news in the last decade quite a few times, that the Seattle police would sell each other drugs and then have that sealed, that a confidential informant would sell it to the officer to then get the bar or the restaurant.
[00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:07.058]  And the restaurant was involved in no type of drug dealing, and then the cops wouldn't even fence the seizure of the popular bar or restaurant.
[00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:13.502]  They would then personally own it, while being police officers.
[00:02:13.502 --> 00:02:20.367]  And it turned out over a hundred bars and restaurants were owned by cops that they'd stolen in Seattle, and it became a national scandal.
[00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:23.389]  That's what this is, but on the internet.
[00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.471]  And it's very, very, very dangerous.
[00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:32.275]  I knew a narcotics trafficking police officer when I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, outside Dallas.
[00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:37.458]  I went to high school there three years, then moved down here.
[00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:44.242]  And he owned a bar that he'd taken from somebody.
[00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:48.685]  And he was the guy running a bunch of the drugs.
[00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:53.548]  So I personally experienced it, and I wasn't even in the drug culture.
[00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.389]  It's just that you would see it go on.
[00:02:57.182 --> 00:02:58.904]  And people talked.
[00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:02.687]  And later a whole bunch of them did go to jail, so that's not just speculation.
[00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:04.429]  The feds busted them.
[00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:09.833]  But that's the pot calling the kettle black.
[00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:15.018]  The immigration news is off the charts insane.
[00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:18.982]  The Middle East news is off the charts insane.
[00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:22.425]  The shoot down of the airliner news is off the charts insane.
[00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:41.422]  The Russian government has released the radar scans and data showing that there were fighter jets in and around the doomed passenger liner MH17.
[00:03:41.422 --> 00:03:45.085]  And now Kiev has censored MH17 air traffic control recordings.
[00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:49.558]  Security services confiscated tapes immediately after incident.
[00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:51.219]  That is now confirmed mainstream news.
[00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.503]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up here today.
[00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:11.031]  So I've been saying, you know, probably the Russians shot it down just because it is a war zone and they weren't supposed to fly in that area and everybody's been asking, who has a brain between their ears, why was the plane redirected there?
[00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:11.972]  And a lot of people
[00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:26.582]  Helicopter pilots, police officers, air traffic controllers, the last few days have been telling me on and off air that, look, I bet they had jets order it by radio or force it into that zone.
[00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:29.926]  Just because that's what experiences they've seen before.
[00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:32.321]  And now that's coming out.
[00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:44.526]  So, that's why I opened the phones up to the former air traffic controllers, current ones, Air Force weapons systems people, police officer, helicopter pilots, because they know how stuff really works.
[00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:46.367]  And that's what's coming out here.
[00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:49.808]  And man, if NATO was involved in this, they are just so evil.
[00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:53.049]  Because I can see the Russians shooting a plane down in a war zone.
[00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:57.211]  I'm not saying it's a good thing, but... I mean, stuff happens in war zones, folks.
[00:04:59.437 --> 00:05:01.678]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:09.740]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.902]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:05:17.262 --> 00:05:21.865]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:32.493]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:38.998]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:41.559]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.202]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:47.302]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:51.463]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[00:05:51.463 --> 00:05:59.864]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:59.864 --> 00:06:05.965]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:10.526]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:15.087]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:18.428]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:23.870]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.252]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:35.393]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:06:35.393 --> 00:06:40.175]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:49.118]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:53.379]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.601]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:59.457 --> 00:07:00.718]  I can, like, taste dirt in it.
[00:07:00.718 --> 00:07:02.039]  God knows what's in there.
[00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.323]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:12.348]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.429]  That one is better.
[00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:14.670]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.151]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:16.652]  It's good water.
[00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:22.814]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:07:22.814 --> 00:07:30.137]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:32.878]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:40.921]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:42.241]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:07:42.241 --> 00:07:43.302]  It's good water.
[00:07:43.302 --> 00:07:43.782]  Refreshing.
[00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:44.222]  It's good!

[00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:07.072]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear.
[00:08:07.072 --> 00:08:09.715]  For Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:11.977]  Americans love television!
[00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:14.139]  They wean their kids on it!
[00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:20.104]  Listen, they love game shows, they love wrestling, they love sports and violence.
[00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:22.346]  So what do we do?
[00:08:22.346 --> 00:08:23.928]  We give them what they want!
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.761]  We're number one, Ben!
[00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:28.844]  That's all that counts!
[00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:31.987]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years!
[00:08:31.987 --> 00:08:35.611]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian.
[00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:37.733]  But I'm a quick learner.
[00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:41.537]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:47.564]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:08:51.707 --> 00:08:54.128]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:54.128 --> 00:08:57.529]  It is Tuesday, the 52nd day of July 2014.
[00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:07.713]  And we have a jam-packed radio slash television transmission simulcast for you today.
[00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:11.155]  I look at the headlines up on Infowars.com.
[00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:13.216]  I look at the headlines on CNBC.
[00:09:13.216 --> 00:09:19.518]  I look on the headlines at DrudgeReport.com, WorldNetDaily, countless other sites every night and every day.
[00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:19.578]  And
[00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:27.458]  Clearly what we're seeing is a world disintegrating.
[00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:28.859]  On many fronts.
[00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:33.463]  But for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, Newtonian physics.
[00:09:33.463 --> 00:09:35.344]  There are a lot of good things happening as well.
[00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:37.446]  A lot of renaissance.
[00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:45.013]  As the old dinosaur media implodes, the new true media is launching into a new golden age.
[00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:50.667]  So take heart for all the negative things we talk about here.
[00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:54.529]  There are so many good things happening as well.
[00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:57.370]  Look at these headlines at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.311]  Court rules Obamacare subsidies illegal.
[00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:13.455]  And so I went to look what Obama was saying, to check that out, and he's saying, oh, don't worry, the subsidies will just continue.
[00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:15.676]  The subsidies are not going to stop.
[00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:21.880]  Many legal analysts are calling it a potentially crippling blow.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.382]  A massive setback.
[00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:29.205]  Premiums poised to spike for millions.
[00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:35.050]  Almost everyone I know in pre-existing conditions was kicked off their healthcare and can't get it now.
[00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.633]  I told you it was written to put you on a death panel, just like the veterans.
[00:10:40.387 --> 00:10:43.428]  Newspapers are claiming it's a wording glitch.
[00:10:43.428 --> 00:10:47.569]  Obama law professor says, I wouldn't bet on law survival.
[00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:50.951]  Of course it wouldn't survive if there was any justice in this country.
[00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:54.272]  Here's the problem.
[00:10:54.272 --> 00:11:06.776]  Boehner, every time something is found unconstitutional, or found to be a total fraud, or found to be completely wrecking the system by design, goes in and says, we'll just pass a amendment.
[00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:10.008]  To, quote, fix it.
[00:11:10.008 --> 00:11:30.465]  Because the very same special interests that run Obama are the ones that wrote this bill, this bipartisan nightmare bill, written by the Blue Blood, Rhino, Neocon, Country Club, Kleptocrat, Crony Capitalist, Anti-Free Market, Anti-Gun, Knuckle-Dragon-Snot-Nosed Aliens.
[00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.530]  And by the way, I was introduced this last week into a term I didn't know about.
[00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:49.058]  I mean, I learned about Walmartians five, six years ago with that popular website that shows all the bizarre weirdos with back breasts and the rest of it at Walmart, and people walking around in their underwear.
[00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:54.302]  And I was introduced to a term called aliens.
[00:11:54.302 --> 00:11:55.723]  And I said, what's that, an illegal alien?
[00:11:56.892 --> 00:11:59.454]  And Anthony Gucciardi said, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:59.454 --> 00:12:00.475]  And he gave me the exact term.
[00:12:00.475 --> 00:12:01.396]  Go ask him the exact term.
[00:12:01.396 --> 00:12:02.717]  It's something alien.
[00:12:02.717 --> 00:12:12.585]  And it's these trust fund, multi-generational trust fund rich people who literally are completely disconnected from reality.
[00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:16.569]  They don't have any social skills and they just wander around
[00:12:18.348 --> 00:12:34.300]  You know, living in their mansions or their high-rise apartments and will just walk over to your table and start, you know, hitting on your girlfriend right in front of you and just have no connection to reality and don't realize how socially awkward and weird they are.
[00:12:37.975 --> 00:12:51.504]  And now that all these trendies are moving to Austin, all these trust fund people, who have been on trust funds for 50 years, and I'm meeting them and running into them, as a Texan, I'm not somebody who's been exposed to a lot of this.
[00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.505]  And these are weirdos.
[00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:54.246]  Hey Alex.
[00:12:54.246 --> 00:12:54.506]  Yes.
[00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:56.907]  The term is just aliens.
[00:12:56.907 --> 00:12:57.508]  It's just aliens?
[00:12:57.508 --> 00:12:58.368]  Just aliens.
[00:12:58.368 --> 00:12:59.649]  Explains it all.
[00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:01.230]  So you've heard of that too?
[00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.670]  Uh, no.
[00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.311]  Anthony pilled me in.
[00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:09.001]  But then people were talking to have dinner with, they all knew they were called aliens and I guess that's just the term.
[00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:13.785]  The younger variety is a trustafarian or a, you know, trust baby.
[00:13:13.785 --> 00:13:15.507]  When they get older, aliens.
[00:13:15.507 --> 00:13:17.168]  Exactly.
[00:13:17.168 --> 00:13:22.973]  These Republicans are a bunch of disconnected aliens.
[00:13:22.973 --> 00:13:28.799]  The trust fund Republicans have no idea how much danger they're in.
[00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:41.779]  And that when this system comes down, they're not going to be left alone by the Democrats they've made deals with under Cloward and Piven and the collapse of the society.
[00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:46.102]  And these people are just as weird as the Walmartians.
[00:13:46.102 --> 00:13:51.766]  And you've got all these billionaire and millionaire Democrats.
[00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:57.510]  You know, Democrats on average, I just saw an article in the Wall Street Journal last week about it, are richer and have more money than Republicans.
[00:13:58.407 --> 00:14:05.651]  Hillary Clinton's worth hundreds of millions of dollars that we know of, and then runs around giving speeches about how poor she is.
[00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:13.074]  And again, she made her money in inside swindles, and cattle deals, and frauds on record.
[00:14:13.074 --> 00:14:24.980]  Bill Clinton, in an audit last year, spends 50 plus percent of the 20, 30, 40 million, depending on the year, money that comes into his stinking foundation.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.341]  And what does he pay for?
[00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:32.371]  Mansions and private jets.
[00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.576]  You have to pull the report up from last year.
[00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:37.457]  We covered it.
[00:14:37.457 --> 00:14:41.581]  I want to say he spent $15 million of it or something on just the jets alone.
[00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:47.507]  $15 million on the jets to fly around
[00:14:48.646 --> 00:15:17.821]  to be paid twelve million dollars in speaking fees they just threw that headline up twelve million dollars in speaking fees and he won't even pay when he's going to get paid a million dollars as a delayed payoff to give a speaking uh... you know event bill clinton foundation has spent more than fifty million on travel expenses there you go new york post but it was it was fifteen million just last year to fly around
[00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:23.898]  And to be paid by governments and others a million dollars per speaking engagement.
[00:15:23.898 --> 00:15:27.160]  Hillary's paid a couple hundred thousand.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:36.066]  And then the money to fly there comes from people that gave money to his foundation to help black Haitian children.
[00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:38.628]  You're not helping black Haitian children.
[00:15:38.628 --> 00:15:44.172]  You're helping Bill Clinton on a wide-body $50 million jet with hookers.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.921]  You want to know where your money for Haiti went?
[00:15:46.921 --> 00:15:51.145]  It went to Bill Clinton on jets with hookers.
[00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:52.766]  Porn stars, you name it.
[00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:54.647]  That's where your money goes.
[00:15:54.647 --> 00:15:58.450]  Get that through your head.
[00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.573]  And I'll hand it to him, at least he's not raping women these days.
[00:16:02.573 --> 00:16:05.596]  At least he's paying them.
[00:16:05.596 --> 00:16:09.839]  The point is, I'm done with this fraud.
[00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:14.683]  These people are disconnected from reality and are building a system
[00:16:18.953 --> 00:16:22.294]  You know, I'm sorry.
[00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:24.635]  It's $106 million they've been paid in speeches.
[00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:26.816]  See, I'm just going from memory.
[00:16:26.816 --> 00:16:31.377]  Bill Clinton's $106 million speech circuit windfall, CNN.
[00:16:31.377 --> 00:16:32.118]  That was a year ago.
[00:16:32.118 --> 00:16:43.202]  And the reason I'm throwing out different numbers of $15 million here, $20 million there, $30 million there, is different articles will quote different time periods and, you know, different areas.
[00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:46.943]  Does Bill Clinton have a secret blonde mistress code named Energizer?
[00:16:48.123 --> 00:16:53.286]  I don't know, do bears live in the woods?
[00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:58.730]  I'm sorry, I've got all this news and I've now gone off the reservation as usual.
[00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.612]  How did I even get to this point?
[00:17:01.612 --> 00:17:08.096]  The Democratic leadership, the Republican leadership, the whole system is disconnected.
[00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:11.719]  There is a report out today from the Congressional Budget Office
[00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:26.243]  Looking at the number of green cards that the Senate Immigration Bill would provide, and it is enough to admit every single person in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
[00:17:26.243 --> 00:17:30.005]  Folks, that is twilight zone level.
[00:17:30.005 --> 00:17:32.227]  There's already 30 million people here.
[00:17:32.227 --> 00:17:33.127]  Let's bring in 150 million.
[00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:39.741]  The country will collapse before another 20 million are brought in.
[00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:44.324]  I mean, this is a military attack on the country.
[00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:53.910]  While Bill Clinton is flying around on luxury $50 million jets, costing $15 million a year, loaded with hookers.
[00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.172]  With money from little black kids.
[00:17:57.172 --> 00:17:59.613]  Stolen from little black kids.
[00:17:59.613 --> 00:18:02.135]  I mean, if there's a hot place in hell, we know where he's going.
[00:18:03.737 --> 00:18:04.677]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:18:04.677 --> 00:18:10.299]  You go out to the average black person, 90% vote for the Democrats, and they'll say, shut up, crackerhead.
[00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:12.660]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.600]  You're just mad.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.041]  He's the first black president.
[00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:30.525]  If you want to abort black people, if you steal the money from the black babies, if you are a total criminal, who's a racist on record, and part of the party that founded the Ku Klux Klan, then you're loved by the average black person.
[00:18:32.318 --> 00:18:34.280]  I mean, I can't take it anymore.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:44.468]  If your organization was founded to fight the Ku Klux Klan like the NRA, you're called by black commentators the KKK, by Jamie Foxx and everybody else.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:46.630]  I mean, you talk about ignorant.
[00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.911]  You talk about upside down.
[00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:50.673]  You talk about screwed up.
[00:18:50.673 --> 00:18:57.919]  You know how guilty I would be if I took any money for orphans and kept the money for anything but administrative?
[00:18:59.053 --> 00:19:00.413]  That's why I like the Salvation Army.
[00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:03.254]  They spend 90% of the money on the direct aid.
[00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:04.755]  That's where I give money.
[00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:07.135]  And I'm not saying they're perfect.
[00:19:07.135 --> 00:19:11.977]  But man, I tell you, Bill Clinton, 50 plus percent of the money is spent on him.
[00:19:11.977 --> 00:19:13.237]  Him!
[00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:14.857]  Him!
[00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:20.239]  Over 80%, look it up, is spent on the organization.
[00:19:20.239 --> 00:19:27.601]  I mean, these people are sickening, disgusting, filthy, just drugged out scum.
[00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:32.112]  Oh yeah, Bill Clinton's a total cokehead.
[00:19:32.112 --> 00:19:33.293]  Just look at him.
[00:19:33.293 --> 00:19:34.974]  What does his brother say about him?
[00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:43.298]  He said, my brother Bill's got a nose like a vacuum cleaner on the police video as he's doing a big cocaine deal.
[00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:48.140]  I've interviewed the CIA people that saw Bill Clinton loading the trucks with the cocaine when he was governor.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.580]  Oh, you bet.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:53.362]  He personally came and oversaw that every week.
[00:19:53.362 --> 00:19:55.023]  Oh man, this country's in trouble.
[00:19:55.023 --> 00:19:56.144]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.144 --> 00:19:57.684]  But the elite are disconnected, folks.
[00:19:57.684 --> 00:19:58.645]  They have no idea what they're doing.

[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.580]  Answer, yes.

[00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:28.965]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:33.447]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:33.447 --> 00:23:39.169]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:42.731]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:45.412]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:45.412 --> 00:23:50.373]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:23:50.373 --> 00:23:50.614]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:50.614 --> 00:23:51.994]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:18.960]  Well, here it's fine If you've got the time And the time to get your stuff in And here it's time
[00:24:26.906 --> 00:24:33.328]  Well, let's look at some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com before I get into some of the top stories that are incredibly important.
[00:24:33.328 --> 00:24:35.929]  Again, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:24:35.929 --> 00:24:52.755]  How Matt Drudge Changed the World, that video special report we premiered here on the air yesterday, is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as the top story right now with about 1,800 comments on it.
[00:24:52.755 --> 00:24:54.856]  And I wanted to do a whole article about it.
[00:24:56.137 --> 00:25:06.903]  But I think we're going to write that article and then add it to the video that Drudge is top linked to in the middle column at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:25:06.903 --> 00:25:17.229]  And about 97% of people on YouTube voted it thumbs up, but I noticed the 3% of trolls got very, very, very upset.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.143]  We're like, why are you groveling to Matt Drudge?
[00:25:24.143 --> 00:25:29.127]  See, they don't want us to celebrate victories we've had for freedom of the press.
[00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:35.552]  Because regardless of what you think about Matt Drudge, he is an icon of the underdog being successful.
[00:25:35.552 --> 00:25:40.175]  It's pure Americana, American drink.
[00:25:40.175 --> 00:25:49.783]  And we need to celebrate examples of where grassroots media has supplanted state-run media and has the establishment pulling their hair out.
[00:25:52.165 --> 00:26:00.269]  And I know I shouldn't even respond to trolls, but I just love explaining why I love to talk about our successes and other people's successes.
[00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:04.911]  You see, I revel in other people's successes.
[00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:11.754]  I revel in an inventor coming up with a Barrett 50 Cal in their garage and making billions of dollars.
[00:26:11.754 --> 00:26:16.416]  I revel in someone coming up with a better sprocket and making billions of dollars.
[00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:20.058]  I revel in someone writing a beautiful symphony and being celebrated.
[00:26:20.934 --> 00:26:26.757]  I revel in someone coming up with a pacemaker that saves millions of lives.
[00:26:26.757 --> 00:26:39.463]  When I see somebody with their private helicopter and their mansion on the hill who made their money the old-fashioned way, producing things to empower humanity, I absolutely celebrate them.
[00:26:39.463 --> 00:26:42.065]  But I don't just celebrate the fact that they have baubles.
[00:26:42.065 --> 00:26:46.147]  I celebrate the fact that they are winners.
[00:26:49.514 --> 00:27:05.140]  And did it swimming upstream, and is the major icon of the new media renaissance revolution.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.762]  Like they call it Gutenberg's Press, because Gutenberg invented it.
[00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:16.745]  When the histories are written, if humanity survives, Drudge will be the central name
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:29.864]  The logo, to a great extent, the symbol of the beginning of the end of information control.
[00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:32.886]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[00:27:32.886 --> 00:27:36.467]  And so we should do more videos celebrating that.
[00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:44.991]  When I get Joseph Farah on and I celebrate the Western Journalism Center, I mean, it was at the top of the list of the Clinton enemies list to be shut down.
[00:27:44.991 --> 00:27:47.692]  That was declassified this year.
[00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:58.753]  And Joseph Farah has thousands of pages of it and hasn't even released it all yet because it's so damning and so dangerous they're worried about being sued.
[00:27:58.753 --> 00:28:00.514]  The stuff and the names that are in there.
[00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:06.416]  Only 35 pages got released and it was shut down Joseph Farah, shut down WorldNetDaily.
[00:28:06.416 --> 00:28:10.017]  If they're able to grow, before WorldNetDaily, which is like 93, 94,
[00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:15.337]  If this happens, the people will have control of information.
[00:28:15.337 --> 00:28:17.057]  It will cause a revolution.
[00:28:17.057 --> 00:28:21.338]  It will cause a renaissance that will end our monopoly of information.
[00:28:21.338 --> 00:28:22.919]  I mean, those are quotes, man!
[00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:25.139]  This is heavy!
[00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:27.780]  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton wrote this thing.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:32.361]  It was sent out to the media to say, when someone questions us, you call them a conspiracy theorist.
[00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:33.541]  You call them an extremist.
[00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:35.462]  They still have that playbook today.
[00:28:40.484 --> 00:28:46.908]  So, I have WorldNet Daily on, even though they're not perfect, even though I don't agree with them on every issue.
[00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:48.409]  They don't agree with me on every issue.
[00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:49.470]  I'm not perfect.
[00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:56.255]  I hear rebroadcast all the time where I disagree with what I've said, because I didn't say it with the exact parlance that I intended.
[00:28:56.255 --> 00:29:05.501]  I mean, it's come out in Politico, how the Clintons get people kicked off MSNBC, that even mildly criticize them.
[00:29:05.501 --> 00:29:06.842]  They're thugs!
[00:29:06.842 --> 00:29:07.742]  They're scum!
[00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:25.195]  When I admire trailblazers and I admire the real John Wayne type characters of this nation's history, like George Washington, I detest the polar opposite, a 180 Hillary Clinton and people like that.
[00:29:25.195 --> 00:29:32.016]  I mean, there's no movies about George Washington, folks, because he was so epic, how incredible he was.
[00:29:32.016 --> 00:29:35.997]  They don't want you to know that you belong to something that cool.
[00:29:38.447 --> 00:29:43.492]  I mean, if they made a movie about it and it was accurate, it would be unbelievable.
[00:29:43.492 --> 00:29:46.796]  So, see, they don't want us celebrating our successes.
[00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:47.316]  Well, you know what?
[00:29:47.316 --> 00:29:48.718]  I'm gonna do it.
[00:29:48.718 --> 00:29:51.280]  Rick Perry is putting troops on the border.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.141]  That's coming up.
[00:29:52.141 --> 00:29:53.302]  The big news coming up.
[00:29:53.302 --> 00:29:54.444]  I'm gonna get to it!
[00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:55.264]  I'm gonna get to it!
[00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:03.201]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:10.625]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:21.453]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:30:21.453 --> 00:30:30.699]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:35.482]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:30:35.482 --> 00:30:39.244]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:30:39.244 --> 00:30:41.305]  Experience the new formula.
[00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:43.887]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:30:43.887 --> 00:30:45.207]  Shield your family.
[00:30:45.207 --> 00:30:47.029]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:14.571]  I think?

[00:31:59.244 --> 00:32:01.626]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:04.448]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:32:04.448 --> 00:32:10.632]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:32:10.632 --> 00:32:15.715]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:32:15.715 --> 00:32:20.599]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:32:20.599 --> 00:32:25.102]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:32:25.402 --> 00:32:34.006]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:32:34.006 --> 00:32:36.147]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:32:36.147 --> 00:32:47.332]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[00:33:03.453 --> 00:33:05.835]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:05.835 --> 00:33:09.057]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:09.057 --> 00:33:11.538]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.353 --> 00:33:33.774]  Yeah.
[00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:08.118]  Federal Appeals Court panel says most Obamacare subsidies illegal.
[00:34:08.118 --> 00:34:16.904]  It's basically the federalization of state healthcare systems, formerly run by the legislatures.
[00:34:16.904 --> 00:34:22.688]  That's CNBC and Obama's law firm has come out and said, well, we are just going to continue this.
[00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:26.190]  That's what the president plans to do.
[00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.732]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[00:34:30.029 --> 00:34:30.449]  I don't know.
[00:34:49.997 --> 00:35:01.440]  Governor Rick Perry says he's going to send the National Guard to the border, and then I guess have them hand them over to ICE, who will then put them on buses and bus them into the country.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:09.882]  See, that's the issue, is that ICE is over the deportation, and they have stopped basically all deportations.
[00:35:09.882 --> 00:35:12.082]  99% of them have been stopped.
[00:35:19.878 --> 00:35:40.663]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, with what's unfolding with the border situation, Senate immigration bill would provide enough green cards to admit every single person in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
[00:35:40.663 --> 00:35:43.524]  Hundreds of millions of people.
[00:35:43.524 --> 00:35:49.325]  This is the complete end of the country, and I know I just keep saying that, but it's too amazing.
[00:35:52.142 --> 00:36:02.571]  It is just too amazing that they're actually doing it.
[00:36:02.571 --> 00:36:06.615]  And what we have is an incredibly blackmailed government.
[00:36:06.615 --> 00:36:19.606]  We saw more NSA whistleblowers go public yesterday and document the fact that NSA intercepts illegally of all digital communications
[00:36:21.564 --> 00:36:25.885]  Have been used for decades to blackmail.
[00:36:25.885 --> 00:36:30.067]  You have to understand these systems are international.
[00:36:30.067 --> 00:36:39.910]  That's why Google and Microsoft and AT&T and Verizon and these companies are more of the NSA than the NSA itself because they straddle national lines.
[00:36:42.213 --> 00:36:48.155]  And they basically sell the data to the highest bidder, or access to mining that data.
[00:36:48.155 --> 00:36:59.378]  And here's a headline today, book, Israelis tried to blackmail Bill Clinton with Lewinsky tape.
[00:36:59.378 --> 00:37:05.019]  You see, that's why our country is in so much trouble.
[00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:07.920]  Because we are just so incredibly corrupt.
[00:37:09.642 --> 00:37:23.955]  And now, the special interests are so reckless, they're willing to bring in 30 million illegals, give them ID cards so they can vote, and then try to bring another 30, 40, 50 million.
[00:37:23.955 --> 00:37:30.121]  They want to issue over 100 million green cards in the new Senate bill.
[00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:34.665]  The bills that Bush brought forward and Obama brought forward have been basically the same bill in the last 10 years.
[00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.791]  They've done it five different times.
[00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:41.032]  Three times under Bush, now twice under Obama.
[00:37:41.032 --> 00:37:46.694]  And it lets everybody who's here then bring family members in.
[00:37:46.694 --> 00:37:58.779]  So by fiat, outside of law, because they can't pass that law, that bill, if you've got family in the U.S., you just tell the Border Patrol, I've got family in, say, St.
[00:37:58.779 --> 00:38:02.300]  Louis, Missouri, when you come into McAllen, Texas or Brownsville.
[00:38:04.298 --> 00:38:16.729]  And they say, okay, here's your unlimited voucher to go wherever you want in the U.S., just an open check on Greyhound.
[00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:23.014]  And they hand you the voucher, and they'll take any ID you've got, any consular matricula, you name it.
[00:38:24.642 --> 00:38:28.885]  I remember having the leader of the Republican Senate on like eight, nine years ago from Colorado.
[00:38:28.885 --> 00:38:43.316]  He'd done a stunt, the Denver Post reported on it, where he went out in one day and got four consula matriculas himself under different names at the Mexican consulate or Mexican embassy.
[00:38:45.916 --> 00:38:58.241]  You go down to Houston, you go to Dallas, there's big giant buildings with big Mexican flags flying on the top of them, and just huge parking lots full of people just going in getting any name they want.
[00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:00.322]  And by the way, Mexico runs like this.
[00:39:00.322 --> 00:39:02.943]  Mexico has collapsed.
[00:39:02.943 --> 00:39:05.304]  They say Cancun's not even safe to go to anymore.
[00:39:05.304 --> 00:39:08.746]  Travel advisories, the entire place.
[00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:11.147]  I was in Mexico four years ago, the last time.
[00:39:11.147 --> 00:39:11.967]  Let me tell you, it was scary.
[00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:23.802]  I was in Cozumel, where I'd probably been 20 times before, and it was scary.
[00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:30.367]  And then we got off in southern Mexico to go see some pyramids, and it was scary.
[00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:33.169]  And it hadn't been scary like that even 10 years ago.
[00:39:33.169 --> 00:39:38.653]  I remember the bus being pulled over, the tour bus, and Mexican troops demanding money
[00:39:41.843 --> 00:39:52.130]  From the bus driver, who then cried and gave them his day's tips from three different trips out to the pyramids.
[00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.892]  That's Mexico.
[00:39:54.892 --> 00:40:01.017]  And we're now going to live like that.
[00:40:01.017 --> 00:40:03.318]  Why are all these people fleeing the third world?
[00:40:03.318 --> 00:40:05.360]  Because it's the third world.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.443]  And by every measurement, every sociological measurement, look it up,
[00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.352]  The United States is now a third world country in most areas.
[00:40:15.352 --> 00:40:15.772]  Look it up.
[00:40:15.772 --> 00:40:21.534]  The United States trails last in income, last in education, last in test scores.
[00:40:21.534 --> 00:40:23.175]  We are a third world country.
[00:40:23.175 --> 00:40:29.837]  California is going to be the next Mexico City.
[00:40:29.837 --> 00:40:35.440]  Mexico City was the staging ground from Central and South America and Southern Mexico.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.740]  It was only 10 million people in 1980.
[00:40:39.693 --> 00:40:49.242]  Mexico City is now estimated at 35 million people.
[00:40:49.242 --> 00:40:54.868]  And now they've moved them to the Maquiladoras, and now they're being moved into the U.S., and then they will pivot and bring in their families.
[00:40:54.868 --> 00:40:58.271]  30 million is 60 million, they bring in their families.
[00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.973]  90 million, they bring in their families.
[00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:08.173]  180 million people within 10 years and that's in the Senate bill.
[00:41:08.173 --> 00:41:26.162]  180 million people in the next 10 years or the new birth rate of Latin America over the next decade transferred to us game over.
[00:41:27.466 --> 00:41:29.568]  The New World Order means to conquer us.
[00:41:29.568 --> 00:41:33.492]  They use ISIS to bring down the Middle East and Al Qaeda.
[00:41:33.492 --> 00:41:39.737]  They use former Nazis to bring down the Ukraine, overthrow it.
[00:41:39.737 --> 00:41:43.681]  And we're being conquered right now.
[00:41:43.681 --> 00:41:53.250]  And if Rick Perry just sends some people down to the border and engages in some grandstanding,
[00:41:58.072 --> 00:42:03.358]  That is not going to be enough.
[00:42:03.358 --> 00:42:15.753]  It's not going to be enough to have some National Guard stand around the border and then apprehend some illegals and then give them to ICE who then puts them on buses.
[00:42:15.753 --> 00:42:17.414]  And I don't even have the money or the reporters.
[00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:21.257]  Should send reporters to all of this in Arizona and Texas.
[00:42:21.257 --> 00:42:32.000]  But we're going to send the reporters back out to cover the supposed National Guard and to go back to the place where the buses come in to videotape that and show it's still going on.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.842]  And our ice whistleblower tells us it's still going on every day in multiple cities in Texas alone.
[00:42:38.842 --> 00:42:40.062]  And it's going on in California.
[00:42:40.062 --> 00:42:42.103]  And it's going on in Arizona.
[00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:49.872]  And if Sheriff Arpaio tries to stop them, the feds sue him and SWAT team raid them and search through all their goods.
[00:42:49.872 --> 00:42:55.196]  This is what our country has turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:55.196 --> 00:43:01.521]  Here's the headline, CBS News, Governor Rick Perry deploying up to 1,000 National Guard troops to border.
[00:43:16.172 --> 00:43:20.114]  We'll be covering more of that coming up.
[00:43:20.114 --> 00:43:25.657]  Budget to transport illegals across the USA approaches $100 million.
[00:43:25.657 --> 00:43:30.820]  And that's just been this summer.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:40.846]  They already want another $3.7 billion because they're going to run out early of the 2015 budget that's $5.508 billion.
[00:43:40.846 --> 00:43:45.669]  And that's from the Senate Appropriations Committee with that information.
[00:43:47.597 --> 00:43:58.059]  Again, Luis Gutierrez, I'm going to play this clip in a minute, to La Raza, Obama assured steps to take the deportation of our people to stop it.
[00:43:58.059 --> 00:44:00.400]  Of our people!
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:14.543]  You mean anybody who's got brown skin from south of the border is now the people under the Democratic Party who then get free goodies if they vote for gun control and socialism and Obamacare to rob everybody?
[00:44:14.543 --> 00:44:16.703]  This is a political takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:20.259 --> 00:44:27.722]  And of course, this is the new political ruling class, and it's not based on private property or the family or the right to self-defense.
[00:44:27.722 --> 00:44:39.928]  It is based on leftist ideology that flies completely in the face of what I would call Hispanic culture.
[00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:47.989]  That's pro-family, pro-private property, pro-male role models, female role models, traditional stuff.
[00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:59.405]  It's all run by these weird little socialist, globalist foundation creatures that Professor Hamamoto, who heads up his UC Davis Sociology Department,
[00:45:05.405 --> 00:45:15.153]  He's pointing out, I mean, he's from the Rockefeller Foundation, he's an insider, he's gotten awards from the system, that this is a political takeover.
[00:45:15.153 --> 00:45:17.836]  Because we're a democracy now, not a republic.
[00:45:17.836 --> 00:45:22.700]  If 51% vote to make the 49% slaves, according to the Democrats, that happens.
[00:45:23.325 --> 00:45:26.987]  Now in a republic, you can get 51% of people to vote to ban guns.
[00:45:26.987 --> 00:45:28.088]  It doesn't happen.
[00:45:28.088 --> 00:45:38.973]  Because you can't get rid of free speech, or the right to defense, or the right to private property, or the right to a jury, or a right to not be incriminated, or a right to not have your house searched without warrants.
[00:45:38.973 --> 00:45:41.214]  All those things are going by the wayside right now.
[00:45:41.214 --> 00:45:43.456]  And by the way, they don't have that in Latin America.
[00:45:43.456 --> 00:45:45.877]  They don't have any of that except maybe in Chile.
[00:45:49.045 --> 00:45:58.311]  IRS seeks help destroying another 3,200 hard drives.
[00:45:58.311 --> 00:46:01.112]  So they're still destroying everything.
[00:46:01.112 --> 00:46:04.174]  Engaging in the takeover.
[00:46:04.174 --> 00:46:06.275]  Here's another one on the border situation.
[00:46:06.275 --> 00:46:08.336]  Again, I mentioned this but I want to read from it now.
[00:46:08.336 --> 00:46:13.480]  Governor Rick Perry deploying up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the border.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.281]  Governor Rick Perry announced
[00:46:16.294 --> 00:46:25.722]  Last night, that he is activating up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as he accused the federal government of offering lip service on border security.
[00:46:25.722 --> 00:46:26.943]  Go all the way, Perry!
[00:46:26.943 --> 00:46:30.266]  They're shipping them in the buses into the country, part of a takeover.
[00:46:30.266 --> 00:46:35.971]  They've ended deportations effectively, except for super hardcore felons, and most of those have stopped.
[00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:41.536]  The announcement comes as the Obama administration is still struggling to deal with an influx of more than 50,000 unaccompanied
[00:46:42.535 --> 00:46:43.756]  Minors.
[00:46:43.756 --> 00:46:46.478]  It's about 100,000 a month we know of, folks.
[00:46:46.478 --> 00:46:47.818]  That's just the minors that count.
[00:46:47.818 --> 00:46:49.780]  It's adults, women, children, you name it.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.281]  See, because the minors then shut down the system.
[00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:56.944]  Most from Central America who have crossed the United States in the past year.
[00:46:56.944 --> 00:47:09.993]  The additional resources are not aimed at the children themselves, Perry said, describing them instead as force multiplier to help the Texas Department of Public Safety combat the brutal drug cartels that are preying upon our communities.
[00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:18.653]  Well, I know the guards have been down there before, and I know they don't shoot back when the cartels shoot at them.
[00:47:18.653 --> 00:47:20.674]  And I know the state police haven't been shooting back.
[00:47:20.674 --> 00:47:25.777]  They've been getting their boats shot up.
[00:47:25.777 --> 00:47:29.018]  This country, just, no other country bends over like this.
[00:47:29.018 --> 00:47:31.319]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:33.040]  Because it's part of the plan.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.661]  You want to grease the skids to implode the country.
[00:47:35.661 --> 00:47:40.764]  Now, let's play this clip where Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat of Illinois,
[00:47:42.233 --> 00:47:51.335]  Said President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was a down payment to the Hispanic community before more grants of amnesty for illegal immigrants.
[00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:53.476]  It is de facto legalization.
[00:47:53.476 --> 00:47:57.236]  They won't have immigration hearings for five years.
[00:47:57.236 --> 00:48:01.958]  They get given driver's license in Colorado and California and other places.
[00:48:01.958 --> 00:48:03.918]  It's game over in Illinois.
[00:48:05.438 --> 00:48:06.899]  And notice it's our people.
[00:48:06.899 --> 00:48:07.819]  They're branding it.
[00:48:07.819 --> 00:48:09.380]  This is how psychology works.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:19.304]  That if you are Hispanic, you support wide open borders and the Democratic Party and turning your guns in.
[00:48:19.304 --> 00:48:27.228]  So this new political class of El Jefe's can turn us into a mixture of Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela.
[00:48:27.228 --> 00:48:30.649]  I mean, have you been to Venezuela, folks?
[00:48:30.649 --> 00:48:34.211]  I've been to Guatemala and Honduras, and let me tell you, they're scary.
[00:48:40.128 --> 00:48:41.288]  Let's go ahead and go to Gutierrez.
[00:48:41.288 --> 00:48:42.809]  Here's the clip.
[00:48:42.809 --> 00:48:45.430]  You see that there is no progress on the issue.
[00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:48.671]  It's time for the President of the United States to step forward.
[00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:54.593]  He has the power to stop deportations, and we will fight.
[00:48:54.593 --> 00:49:01.615]  If I don't want to go, I would like to stay here.
[00:49:01.615 --> 00:49:02.676]  This is Chicago.
[00:49:02.676 --> 00:49:05.237]  I'm part of Chicago, and that's why I'm here.
[00:49:07.677 --> 00:49:08.818]  This is the genius of it.
[00:49:08.818 --> 00:49:12.321]  They've got these people fleeing desperate nations who just like living here.
[00:49:12.321 --> 00:49:15.284]  And I get it, compared to where they came from.
[00:49:15.284 --> 00:49:19.447]  But they're politically handled by monsters.
[00:49:19.447 --> 00:49:22.189]  By the big Chicago crime syndicate.
[00:49:22.189 --> 00:49:23.771]  By the New York crime syndicate.
[00:49:23.771 --> 00:49:24.331]  By the L.A.
[00:49:24.331 --> 00:49:25.012]  crime syndicate.
[00:49:25.012 --> 00:49:28.575]  They're being used, and the country will be collapsed.
[00:49:28.575 --> 00:49:33.119]  So he's in a lifeboat, going, I'd like to stay, to put a human face on it.
[00:49:36.004 --> 00:49:38.085]  But you need to free Latin America.
[00:49:38.085 --> 00:49:42.126]  You need to put in economic development there.
[00:49:42.126 --> 00:49:44.507]  But the IMF and World Bank goes, oh, we understand that, Mr. Jones.
[00:49:44.507 --> 00:49:45.268]  We want to do that.
[00:49:45.268 --> 00:49:50.350]  But now they want to put money into, again, decentralized systems that only make things worse.
[00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.591]  The globalists want us poor and bankrupted.
[00:49:52.591 --> 00:49:56.172]  They've done this on purpose in Africa and Latin America and Asia.
[00:49:56.172 --> 00:49:58.253]  I've interviewed the top technicians involved in it.
[00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.651]  I've interviewed the former chief economist of the World Bank, Joseph Stiklitz.
[00:50:03.651 --> 00:50:09.113]  I've interviewed John Perkins, who was an economic hitman over whole countries.
[00:50:09.113 --> 00:50:15.415]  He would go in and meet with the presidents and say, you either take this billion dollars in your Swiss bank account, or we're going to kill you.
[00:50:15.415 --> 00:50:17.716]  Is that clear?
[00:50:17.716 --> 00:50:25.879]  And if they didn't sign over all the infrastructure and then double and triple prices and break the country down with a list of demands that would make the country go bankrupt,
[00:50:26.724 --> 00:50:29.665]  So the globals would have a permanent poor client state.
[00:50:29.665 --> 00:50:40.087]  They would kill the president or prime minister or have the US Army or Marine Corps invade or fund rebels.
[00:50:40.087 --> 00:50:40.727]  You understand that?
[00:50:40.727 --> 00:50:42.808]  And people go, yes, see, America's evil.
[00:50:42.808 --> 00:50:44.908]  And then Americans get blamed for it.
[00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:45.528]  No, no, no.
[00:50:45.528 --> 00:50:46.809]  We're under the same thing.
[00:50:46.809 --> 00:50:48.589]  They're going to do this here now.
[00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:50.349]  Mark my words.
[00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:51.490]  And look, I'm smart.
[00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.870]  I'll be fine throughout all this.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.682]  But the general public just trying to work and live?
[00:50:55.682 --> 00:50:57.384]  You're screwed, okay?
[00:50:57.384 --> 00:50:58.826]  I mean, this is gonna hurt everybody.
[00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:05.112]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[00:51:05.112 --> 00:51:07.052]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[00:51:07.052 --> 00:51:10.714]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[00:51:10.714 --> 00:51:14.756]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[00:51:14.756 --> 00:51:21.279]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[00:51:21.279 --> 00:51:21.600]  Call 877-800-9986.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:21.880]  That's 877-800-9986.
[00:51:29.497 --> 00:51:33.019]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[00:51:33.019 --> 00:51:37.381]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[00:51:37.381 --> 00:51:39.703]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[00:51:39.703 --> 00:51:42.504]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[00:51:42.504 --> 00:51:45.146]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:48.147]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[00:51:48.147 --> 00:51:49.088]  Awesome!
[00:51:49.088 --> 00:51:51.449]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[00:51:51.449 --> 00:51:53.970]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.
[00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.452]  Get your Blocket Pocket at BlocketPocket.com.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:06.163]  By now you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:52:06.163 --> 00:52:07.304]  No bank needed.
[00:52:07.304 --> 00:52:11.165]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:52:11.165 --> 00:52:15.027]  Plus, a large number of businesses and merchants already accept Bitcoins.
[00:52:15.027 --> 00:52:18.589]  And Bitcoins are easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:31.113]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:53:31.113 --> 00:53:35.435]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:53:35.435 --> 00:53:36.836]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:53:36.836 --> 00:53:39.497]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:53:39.497 --> 00:53:42.499]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.761]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:53:46.761 --> 00:53:52.324]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:53:52.324 --> 00:53:56.126]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:53:56.126 --> 00:53:57.627]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:23.184]  Nicaragua, El Salvador have the highest overall murder rates in the world, right behind them.
[00:54:23.184 --> 00:54:33.130]  Mexico, Mexico has the highest total number, but per capita, Guatemala and El Salvador to the south have the highest.
[00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:36.032]  Kidnappings are now exploding all across the United States.
[00:54:36.032 --> 00:54:39.594]  I have a cousin who again has been in the military for 31 years, the Army.
[00:54:41.164 --> 00:54:47.126]  And the last few years he's been in operations on the border and in Mexico in covert operations.
[00:54:47.126 --> 00:54:48.566]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:54:48.566 --> 00:54:57.488]  And he just got in the mail a few months ago a photo taken of him on the street from the Mexican drug cartel saying, you're dead.
[00:54:57.488 --> 00:55:02.009]  And now the state police are getting those in the mail as well.
[00:55:02.009 --> 00:55:05.190]  And once the killing starts, it'll just happen.
[00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.911]  Our country is collapsing into a third world pit.
[00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:14.801]  And I have family getting photos in the mail saying we're going to kill you.
[00:55:14.801 --> 00:55:17.022]  See, this is how I'm being affected.
[00:55:17.022 --> 00:55:20.344]  I've had two family members die from superbugs this year.
[00:55:20.344 --> 00:55:23.245]  The hospitals were all full, literally full, mass death.
[00:55:23.245 --> 00:55:25.446]  Every medical doctor told me there's a huge plague.
[00:55:25.446 --> 00:55:27.187]  It's being covered up.
[00:55:27.187 --> 00:55:30.028]  Never in the news.
[00:55:30.028 --> 00:55:34.330]  Mexican drug cartel sends a photograph to the home address of my family.
[00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.652]  I knew about this months ago, I just got reminded of it.
[00:55:40.691 --> 00:55:44.453]  I mean, this is how I'm being affected.
[00:55:44.453 --> 00:55:49.416]  These are real things, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:49.416 --> 00:55:50.037]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:55:50.037 --> 00:55:58.802]  Honduras is number one, Venezuela, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica.
[00:55:58.802 --> 00:56:00.203]  Then it goes into some African countries.
[00:56:02.864 --> 00:56:04.826]  Honduras has the highest crime rate.
[00:56:04.826 --> 00:56:06.808]  You know, I don't know if I agree with those numbers, though.
[00:56:06.808 --> 00:56:08.650]  What is that, a World Factbook?
[00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:13.215]  Because if you look at Mexico, I don't know if that's the highest number of total dead.
[00:56:13.215 --> 00:56:13.796]  It's like 130,000 dead.
[00:56:17.619 --> 00:56:19.281]  Yeah, that's out of the Huffington Post.
[00:56:19.281 --> 00:56:20.161]  Anyway, side issue.
[00:56:20.161 --> 00:56:27.729]  The point is, Latin America is collapsing, and then we've got politicians going, our people need to be here!
[00:56:27.729 --> 00:56:38.139]  And then they literally take the dregs, the criminals, the homeless, the people that are crippled.
[00:56:38.139 --> 00:56:39.240]  So the nation will bankrupt.
[00:56:40.592 --> 00:56:46.955]  And then you always see these press conferences that the illegals are having with the people they voted for to get elected.
[00:56:46.955 --> 00:56:50.197]  And they're always looking so angry like they've been put down and treated bad.
[00:56:50.197 --> 00:56:53.118]  And how dare America not give them more?
[00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:55.579]  I mean, it's a joke, people.
[00:56:55.579 --> 00:57:01.082]  It's a joke.
[00:57:01.082 --> 00:57:05.704]  Former Border Patrol head came out this week and said, one in five illegals has a criminal record.
[00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:17.150]  I mean, I'm telling you, Americans that haven't been to Latin America, you have no idea how dangerous this is.
[00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.651]  No idea.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.802]  It shows the establishment has decided to sink this country.
[00:57:25.802 --> 00:57:29.604]  Coming up, Kiev censors MH17 air traffic control recordings.
[00:57:29.604 --> 00:57:32.085]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:57:32.085 --> 00:57:36.348]  Mystery white flags replace American flags atop Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:57:36.348 --> 00:57:41.511]  A great way to say America's in crisis and has run up the white flag.
[00:57:41.511 --> 00:57:44.453]  A demonstration about the open borders, probably.
[00:57:44.453 --> 00:57:45.973]  The police want to arrest whoever did it.
[00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:54.220]  I salute whoever did it, because this country's running up the white flag, endorsing Al-Qaeda, opening the borders, all of it.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.200]  That's all coming up.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.043]  So much other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:57:59.043 --> 00:58:10.412]  Briefly, we are running a special right now on the fluoride shield that has the nascent iodine and five other ingredients that chelate and detoxify the body with the survival shield.
[00:58:10.412 --> 00:58:14.695]  25% off both when you get them together at infowarslife.com.
[00:58:16.116 --> 00:58:19.577]  And we now have more of the silver bullet that's been gone for over two months.
[00:58:19.577 --> 00:58:23.179]  We just got a limited supply of the most powerful colloidal silver out there, bar none.
[00:58:23.179 --> 00:58:31.782]  And I've used a lot of colloidal silver and it's great, but this stuff is just super powerful and it's a very low price compared to all the competitors.
[00:58:31.782 --> 00:58:33.043]  It's about half the price.

[00:58:38.025 --> 00:58:38.785]  Second hour,
[00:58:43.107 --> 00:58:46.409]  Your phone calls, Paul Watson, it's all coming up.
[00:58:46.409 --> 00:58:49.652]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.652 --> 00:58:56.816]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:58:56.816 --> 00:58:59.178]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:58:59.178 --> 00:59:04.462]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:04.462 --> 00:59:09.405]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:09.605 --> 00:59:12.948]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:12.948 --> 00:59:17.011]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:21.335]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:21.335 --> 00:59:31.564]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:31.564 --> 00:59:34.086]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:59:34.466 --> 00:59:36.788]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:05.714 --> 01:00:10.558]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.558 --> 01:00:12.140]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.681]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.681 --> 01:00:17.885]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.885 --> 01:00:21.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:42.321]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live now into the second hour.
[01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:50.849]  I want to go through the top stories and I want to continue to break down major developments as they unfold.
[01:00:50.849 --> 01:00:56.595]  But I also want to open the phones up again for first-time callers.
[01:00:56.595 --> 01:01:01.099]  What do you think of Rick Perry saying he's going to put a thousand National Guard
[01:01:02.899 --> 01:01:08.621]  On the Texas border, because Obama, quote, doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:13.722]  No, no, Obama knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:01:13.722 --> 01:01:19.164]  And he says they're there just to help the border patrol and help the state police.
[01:01:19.164 --> 01:01:21.385]  He said that Obama's paying lip service.
[01:01:21.385 --> 01:01:21.805]  No, he's not.
[01:01:23.035 --> 01:01:30.538]  He's crushing the border, ending America as we know it, and bringing us into the North American Union, and then merging that with failed Central America.
[01:01:30.538 --> 01:01:34.940]  This is a form of siege on the country, cloured and piven.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:40.803]  That's what we need to hear from Rick Perry.
[01:01:40.803 --> 01:01:49.487]  And then have trucks load the illegals up, and drive them up to the Mexico border,
[01:01:51.624 --> 01:02:02.207]  Right there on the bridge and dump them out, and then not let them go back by, and then let a huge crisis start, and let the whole world see the border is collapsed, and that the Mexican troops will try to push them back over.
[01:02:02.207 --> 01:02:04.028]  Escalate it into a crisis.
[01:02:04.028 --> 01:02:10.910]  That's what Obama's done, creating the crisis, hoping now that we all just let this collapse accelerate.
[01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:18.592]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, Central and South America are in total collapse, and they're opening up a con...
[01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:20.530]  Do it.
[01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.111]  A corridor to bring down the United States.
[01:02:23.111 --> 01:02:25.592]  That is not rhetoric.
[01:02:25.592 --> 01:02:31.754]  We are red-level emergency right now.
[01:02:31.754 --> 01:02:48.941]  And then under political correctness, as everything's going bankrupt and cities are full of hundreds of thousands of illegals apiece begging for everything, the system will use them as a political football and will also exploit them to drive down wages and will exploit them to be a desperate political class totally dependent on them.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:56.863]  Segregation was a great evil, but under it, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:02:56.863 --> 01:03:03.647]  Black communities in many areas were becoming as wealthy or more wealthy than the white areas.
[01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:17.775]  By the 1950s, blacks basically owned their own universities all over the country, their own restaurants, hotels, businesses, and the segregation had made them wealthy.
[01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:28.178]  The Democrats switched from being the Klan to embracing them on record and domesticated them with welfare.
[01:03:28.178 --> 01:03:35.663]  And now blacks, on average, live in third world conditions in this country and have almost 90% of legitimacy.
[01:03:35.663 --> 01:03:37.965]  Everyone knows the numbers.
[01:03:37.965 --> 01:03:49.774]  So you take people from suits and ties, owning their own businesses, very proud of themselves, being very successful under open attack in many areas of the country.
[01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:56.491]  To now being failed.
[01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:57.591]  Failed.
[01:03:57.591 --> 01:03:59.751]  On average.
[01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:03.952]  That's the plan for everybody.
[01:04:03.952 --> 01:04:06.693]  You look at these trust fund kids.
[01:04:06.693 --> 01:04:08.473]  They're failed.
[01:04:08.473 --> 01:04:10.774]  I run into rich Hispanic trust fund kids.
[01:04:10.774 --> 01:04:11.954]  They're failed snot noses.
[01:04:11.954 --> 01:04:17.035]  I run into rich white trust fund snot noses.
[01:04:17.035 --> 01:04:18.276]  They're failed.
[01:04:18.276 --> 01:04:20.036]  But they're not failed in a ghetto with a gun.
[01:04:23.134 --> 01:04:26.695]  I'm not saying everybody with trust funds is bad, but everybody knows the statistics.
[01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:29.216]  Prosperity, ladies and gentlemen, creates monsters.
[01:04:29.216 --> 01:04:32.998]  Adversity creates men.
[01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:41.261]  And that is the great paradox of liberty, is that as we create liberty, it then creates slobs who then accept tyranny.
[01:04:41.261 --> 01:04:49.664]  So I want to give the number out to get your take on Rick Perry and what he should do about the border, and how we put pressure on him, and where you think all this is going.
[01:04:50.563 --> 01:04:52.463]  I think it's going according to the globalist plan.
[01:04:52.463 --> 01:04:53.344]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:53.344 --> 01:04:53.684]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:53.684 --> 01:05:01.645]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:05:01.645 --> 01:05:04.966]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[01:05:04.966 --> 01:05:06.286]  God knows what's in there.
[01:05:06.286 --> 01:05:10.527]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:05:10.527 --> 01:05:16.268]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:05:16.428 --> 01:05:17.508]  That one is better.
[01:05:17.508 --> 01:05:18.729]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:05:18.729 --> 01:05:20.169]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:05:20.169 --> 01:05:20.809]  It's good water.
[01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:26.791]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:05:26.791 --> 01:05:34.032]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:05:34.032 --> 01:05:36.733]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:44.655]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:05:44.795 --> 01:05:45.956]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:05:45.956 --> 01:05:47.036]  It's good water.
[01:05:47.036 --> 01:05:47.617]  Refreshing?
[01:05:47.617 --> 01:05:48.237]  It's good!

[01:05:55.302 --> 01:05:57.523]  I've always believed in nutrition and nerves.
[01:06:01.806 --> 01:06:17.038]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:06:17.378 --> 01:06:22.001]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:32.629]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:06:32.629 --> 01:06:39.114]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:39.114 --> 01:06:41.675]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[01:06:45.498 --> 01:06:47.439]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[01:07:14.514 --> 01:07:14.674]  I think?

[01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:57.911]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:08:01.607 --> 01:08:04.348]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.348 --> 01:08:16.411]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.411 --> 01:08:22.653]  If I sound a little hysterical here on air, it's for good reason, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:22.653 --> 01:08:24.053]  It's 100% clear now.
[01:08:24.053 --> 01:08:25.474]  Our worst fears are being realized.
[01:08:27.506 --> 01:08:32.710]  They plan on over a hundred million green cards in the new Senate Immigration Bill.
[01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:41.217]  That's directly from the Senate Budget Office and the committee handling it.
[01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:50.925]  They are advertising the borders open worldwide as a fiat amnesty to implode the country and bankrupt the nation.
[01:08:50.925 --> 01:08:55.009]  And the waves of illegals are only expanding and accelerating
[01:08:56.332 --> 01:09:08.383]  If the next few waves are allowed in, in the next few months, it will set the precedent, the numbers will be so overwhelming, we won't ever be able to basically stop it.
[01:09:08.383 --> 01:09:15.749]  And then it's political suicide for anyone who wants to have a stable country.
[01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:22.515]  Now, if you are the globalist, you love it because you live in Luxembourg, Switzerland, or London,
[01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:27.246]  Or Paris, and you live in big armored fortresses and you don't care.
[01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.528]  You fly to work on helicopters.
[01:09:29.528 --> 01:09:44.001]  Just like the elite of Mexico, like Carlos Slim, who made his money out of monopolies, and out of globalist deals, and out of the big banks and the money laundering.
[01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:49.666]  So this is a mobster system that we're going into headlong, and
[01:09:50.908 --> 01:09:55.990]  I don't know who put up the white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge today, but it was dramatic.
[01:09:55.990 --> 01:10:08.195]  And it got the whole city of more than 10 million people, I guess it's 18 million, the whole metro area, talking about why is there white flags flying over the Brooklyn Bridge.
[01:10:08.195 --> 01:10:10.976]  And then anti-terrorism teams went up.
[01:10:10.976 --> 01:10:16.738]  The flags were up there for two hours.
[01:10:16.738 --> 01:10:18.139]  And everyone's saying, what does it mean?
[01:10:18.139 --> 01:10:20.300]  Well, a black flag means no surrender.
[01:10:23.228 --> 01:10:30.130]  A black flag with a skull on it means no surrender, no quarter given.
[01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:34.271]  It means if you capture us, you need to kill us.
[01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:37.712]  And if we capture you, we're going to kill you.
[01:10:37.712 --> 01:10:44.234]  And then they started adding other things to the skull and crossbones to mean that we will torture you as well.
[01:10:46.687 --> 01:10:48.508]  But that's where the black flag comes from.
[01:10:48.508 --> 01:10:52.949]  It predates the pirates of the Caribbean a good thousand years.
[01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:56.931]  That's why Al-Qaeda uses a black flag.
[01:10:56.931 --> 01:10:59.252]  The white flag, everybody knows what that means.
[01:10:59.252 --> 01:11:03.934]  It means we surrender.
[01:11:03.934 --> 01:11:05.494]  We surrender.
[01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:11.617]  Unconditionally.
[01:11:11.617 --> 01:11:15.298]  Or it could mean you wish to parlay or have a conversation.
[01:11:19.306 --> 01:11:24.029]  And I would guess this was put up there because the country is wide open right now.
[01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:28.933]  And by every yardstick, we are in a crisis.
[01:11:28.933 --> 01:11:37.379]  That's why I think it's fine to have micro-FM stations in cities, as long as they don't interfere with other stations and private property.
[01:11:37.379 --> 01:11:40.601]  Because our nation is under attack and being destroyed.
[01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:43.864]  There won't be any future of freedom of the press if we don't stand together now.
[01:11:45.287 --> 01:11:47.749]  That's why it's time for civil disobedience.
[01:11:47.749 --> 01:12:08.645]  You decide what should be done yourself, but projecting things up on the side of big buildings at big public events, parachuting into public events to get attention like Lord Monckton did at the big UN power grab meeting in Durban, South Africa, when they were censoring free speech, running up white flags.
[01:12:09.818 --> 01:12:25.775]  So that then when the local town asks why later, you mail a letter in showing a photograph of you doing it with your back turned or whatever, or saying who you are, running it up on the police station, running it up at the city council, running it up at the post office.
[01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:31.941]  I mean, the illegals have been pulling down American flags, running up Mexican flags for about 10 years.
[01:12:31.941 --> 01:12:32.402]  They get it.
[01:12:34.275 --> 01:12:39.737]  So what you do is you hang the American flag upside down, but above it, the white flag.
[01:12:39.737 --> 01:12:46.700]  If you really want to get it right, America's in distress, we've effectively surrendered.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.682]  American flag on bottom, upside down.
[01:12:49.682 --> 01:12:52.863]  Or your state flag on bottom, upside down.
[01:12:52.863 --> 01:12:59.126]  And I know America has been bad and hadn't been perfect, but we had some ideas that the globalists want to get rid of.
[01:12:59.126 --> 01:13:01.387]  And everybody wanted to come here because we were exceptional.
[01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:18.447]  We're now exceptionally corrupt, exceptionally pathetic, exceptionally evil, exceptionally mesmerized in a trance state, obsessed with things that don't matter.
[01:13:18.447 --> 01:13:26.590]  I mean, when a grown man, when I'm at the gym, comes over and goes, hey, what'd you think of the baseball game last night or the football game?
[01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:28.330]  I go, sorry, I just don't have time to follow it.
[01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:29.751]  And they'll look at you like you're weird.
[01:13:31.348 --> 01:13:33.850]  And I'll say, man, you know, the whole country's collapsing.
[01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:37.113]  I'm just trying to protect myself, my family, and warn others.
[01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:40.716]  It's like weird and extraordinary to be informed.
[01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:44.420]  People are like, people ask, oh, aren't you that radio TV guy?
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.102]  Yeah, it's kind of weird what you talk about.
[01:13:47.102 --> 01:13:48.163]  It's kind of scary.
[01:13:48.163 --> 01:13:51.646]  I don't think I like to focus on negative things.
[01:13:51.646 --> 01:13:55.169]  And I'm like, yeah, well, that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.870]  You know, I get it.
[01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:57.971]  I could pull up Anchor.
[01:13:58.911 --> 01:14:12.877]  And live pretty cheap in some South Pacific island and go buy a dive shop just as a front for the fact that I'm really a political person running from persecution.
[01:14:12.877 --> 01:14:18.260]  And just have a little business and rent out scuba gear to people.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:24.103]  And just watch the world burn.
[01:14:24.103 --> 01:14:24.763]  So I get
[01:14:28.217 --> 01:14:33.543]  I get why you think it's a loser mentality to be involved or care.
[01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:39.006]  It's people that cared that built this country.
[01:14:39.006 --> 01:14:42.708]  It's people that stood up for ideas and values and are willing to die for it.
[01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:48.591]  That defeated the greatest empire the world had ever seen.
[01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:50.833]  And that's why that history is not even taught anymore.
[01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:53.614]  Because they don't want you to know why you were exceptional.
[01:14:53.614 --> 01:15:00.238]  They've taught you you're exceptional because you drink light beer, wear Levi's, and watch NFL football.
[01:15:00.238 --> 01:15:01.759]  They taught you you're exceptional
[01:15:05.066 --> 01:15:08.927]  Because you love Barack Obama.
[01:15:08.927 --> 01:15:14.909]  They taught you you're exceptional because you buy into the Republicans and John McCain.
[01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:29.154]  No, what you are is people living in a house, living in a fortress, living in a system that had the most inventions, the most science, the most trailblazers, the toughest fighters, the best people in the world.
[01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:35.337]  On average, we're in this country, and nobody wanted to mess with us.
[01:15:35.337 --> 01:15:54.833]  Because we came from slaves, and indentured servants, and political prisoners, and soldiers, and fighters, and inventors, and farmers, and people that couldn't be free in Europe and other parts of the world, who came here in the bottom of wooden ships with rats and sewage.
[01:15:56.479 --> 01:16:02.824]  To then carve out a new world in the middle of native tribes that were killing each other 24-7.
[01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:16.414]  Your ancestors are people that would crowd on ships when about a third of them were getting lost.
[01:16:16.414 --> 01:16:18.416]  And would come across the ocean.
[01:16:18.416 --> 01:16:21.018]  And a third of the people, sometimes more, would die on the ship.
[01:16:21.018 --> 01:16:22.059]  Look it up.
[01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:23.220]  You were black more than half.
[01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:30.536]  And you got here and you survived and you lived and your ancestors were tough as nails.
[01:16:30.536 --> 01:16:31.776]  And now look what you've become.
[01:16:31.776 --> 01:16:34.118]  Look what I've become.
[01:16:34.118 --> 01:16:36.339]  What have I become?
[01:16:36.339 --> 01:16:39.121]  My sweetest friend.
[01:16:39.121 --> 01:16:45.864]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[01:16:45.864 --> 01:16:48.026]  And you could have it all.
[01:16:48.026 --> 01:16:50.887]  My empire of dirt.
[01:16:50.887 --> 01:16:51.808]  I will let you in.
[01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:58.073]  I will make you hurt.
[01:16:58.073 --> 01:17:01.234]  And now we're at the end of the republic.
[01:17:01.234 --> 01:17:04.055]  And the fall of the empire has just begun.
[01:17:04.055 --> 01:17:13.298]  The long slide into third world, overlaid with technocratic hell.
[01:17:13.298 --> 01:17:19.580]  We're gonna go to Eric, Daniel, Fred, Chris, Tim, and others when we come back in the next segment.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.501]  But you are seeing just the epic fall of our country.
[01:17:23.553 --> 01:17:29.139]  And the Republican leadership, Rick Perry's being praised by Republicans.
[01:17:29.139 --> 01:17:38.169]  Ooh, he's getting tough with Obama, saying Obama's paying lip service to border security.
[01:17:38.169 --> 01:17:44.757]  Obama set a plan with the Mexican and Guatemalan president to open a corridor up with more than 15 trains a day.
[01:17:46.622 --> 01:17:58.668]  It's 15 on average, with thousands per train up to the country, and aircraft landing at military bases authorized to then ship the illegals all over the country.
[01:17:58.668 --> 01:18:01.009]  But the public says there's a crisis!
[01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.590]  We don't know what to do!
[01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:11.814]  So Rick Perry will deploy the National Guard to deliver the illegals to ICE to give them bus tickets!
[01:18:11.814 --> 01:18:13.355]  So, I'm gonna put a bounty out.
[01:18:17.624 --> 01:18:32.614]  $5,000 to whoever gets the footage and the interviews of the Border Patrol and the National Guard in Texas delivering the illegals to ICE.
[01:18:32.614 --> 01:18:34.896]  Then you stake out the ICE facility.
[01:18:34.896 --> 01:18:37.358]  They release them in buses at night.
[01:18:37.358 --> 01:18:38.058]  They know you're out there.
[01:18:38.058 --> 01:18:40.120]  They'll hold them until you're gone.
[01:18:40.922 --> 01:18:44.866]  And then you catch the buses getting out and you give us the footage.
[01:18:44.866 --> 01:18:53.573]  I'm sending reporters down there but they can't catch it every time because they stop shipping when they see that we're there.
[01:18:53.573 --> 01:19:05.023]  And then we'll have the footage of the entire circle being completed of Rick Perry helping Obama ship the illegals in.
[01:19:05.023 --> 01:19:06.745]  And those two met and I'm sure it's a plan.
[01:19:10.185 --> 01:19:13.466]  Just us talking about this may make Rick Perry do the right thing.
[01:19:13.466 --> 01:19:18.188]  But let me tell you something, Rick Perry is a gigantic snake, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:20.808]  He's a former Democrat.
[01:19:20.808 --> 01:19:23.930]  Flipped Republican.
[01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:27.511]  He used to support gun control when he was a Democrat.
[01:19:27.511 --> 01:19:30.992]  Anyone that ever supports gun control is a piece of trash.
[01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:37.314]  He also... By the way, I've been invited to be friends with, you know, with the whole Perry group years ago.
[01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:41.945]  Perry's come over to my table and tried to be friends.
[01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:50.148]  Listen, buddy, you ever turn over a new leaf instead of being a Bilderberg, New World or Schill, I would be nice to Perry.
[01:19:50.148 --> 01:19:52.988]  But I'm sick of his fake garbage.
[01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:56.069]  He tried to tell kids it was the law to take guard of still.
[01:19:56.069 --> 01:19:57.570]  That deadly shot, remember all that?
[01:20:00.177 --> 01:20:04.519]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfume detergents that irritate your skin?
[01:20:04.519 --> 01:20:09.261]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that gives your skin rashes?

[01:20:38.735 --> 01:20:39.516]  This capitalism?
[01:20:39.516 --> 01:20:45.679]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:22:01.512 --> 01:22:06.636]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.636 --> 01:22:14.763]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:19.288]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:19.288 --> 01:22:23.091]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.

[01:23:55.212 --> 01:23:56.373]  MyMagicMud.com
[01:24:00.815 --> 01:24:18.831]  You don't have to see for miles and miles anymore to see what's happening.
[01:24:18.831 --> 01:24:22.755]  Now we know your little tricks.
[01:24:27.756 --> 01:24:28.217]  I think so.
[01:24:42.381 --> 01:24:45.202]  They don't want to have a debate about what they're doing.
[01:24:45.202 --> 01:24:50.043]  They wanted to deny the border was open months ago and they'd ordered a stand down four months ago.
[01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:58.366]  They wanted to deny that they were basically ending deportations and releasing people for three to five years and giving them a driver's license.
[01:24:58.366 --> 01:25:00.466]  It's all out in the open now.
[01:25:00.466 --> 01:25:09.069]  And if we can make Rick Perry come out and tell the truth about what's going on in Texas, it's game over.
[01:25:09.069 --> 01:25:10.129]  If we had one leader
[01:25:11.854 --> 01:25:20.614]  Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are talking about how it's deliberate, and that's why their stars are rising.
[01:25:20.614 --> 01:25:21.276]  They're for real.
[01:25:23.444 --> 01:25:26.827]  Rick Perry knows exactly what's going on on the border.
[01:25:26.827 --> 01:25:29.069]  And he knows Obama isn't paying lip service.
[01:25:29.069 --> 01:25:33.093]  Obama is engaged in deliberate... Remember Perry said he wouldn't meet with Obama when he came?
[01:25:33.093 --> 01:25:34.794]  And wouldn't shake his hand?
[01:25:34.794 --> 01:25:36.156]  He did both!
[01:25:36.156 --> 01:25:37.497]  That's the thing about Perry.
[01:25:37.497 --> 01:25:40.760]  He always does the opposite of what he says!
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.502]  I've been under him for over 10 years!
[01:25:42.502 --> 01:25:44.043]  I know all about him!
[01:25:44.043 --> 01:25:45.724]  He's been on the show!
[01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.266]  Calling me a big fat pig!
[01:25:47.266 --> 01:25:49.068]  You gotta find that clip!
[01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:53.053]  One time he walks up and he goes, is that Alex Jones you're on the air with?
[01:25:53.053 --> 01:25:54.593]  Down at the Capitol, we had a reporter.
[01:25:54.593 --> 01:25:57.035]  Grabs him away and goes, you big ol' fat sweaty hog!
[01:25:57.035 --> 01:26:02.597]  I mean, Perry does not like me, folks.
[01:26:02.597 --> 01:26:06.839]  And I want to believe in Rick Perry.
[01:26:06.839 --> 01:26:10.461]  I don't want to just sit here and say he's a horrible person.
[01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:15.684]  And the state police have been down there stopping the hardened criminals and trying to shame ICE into deporting them.
[01:26:17.276 --> 01:26:22.257]  So, maybe Perry's doing some good, but I don't trust him.
[01:26:22.257 --> 01:26:23.658]  I'm sorry, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:26:23.658 --> 01:26:25.658]  Eric in Ohio on Rick Perry.
[01:26:25.658 --> 01:26:30.019]  What do you think he's doing saying he's going to send a thousand guard down there?
[01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:34.080]  Well, as a former member of the Ohio National Guard, I thought it was going to be a great thing.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.381]  I don't know a whole lot about the Governor of Texas.
[01:26:37.771 --> 01:26:41.337]  And now after listening to you talk about them, I don't know if it was a great thing or not.
[01:26:41.337 --> 01:26:46.887]  I mean... Well you notice, I mean before I even read the article this morning in CBS News, I knew what it was going to say.
[01:26:46.887 --> 01:26:50.953]  They're just there to be eyes and ears for the state police, not actually grab anybody.
[01:26:51.823 --> 01:26:55.987]  Well, see, I thought maybe, hopefully with him sending those troops down, maybe they'd start a trend in the Southwest.
[01:27:19.969 --> 01:27:23.992]  No, no, I agree.
[01:27:23.992 --> 01:27:30.116]  And see, it sounds like they're doing something, but Rick Perry's put the National Guard on the border before.
[01:27:30.116 --> 01:27:31.657]  And they don't do anything.
[01:27:31.657 --> 01:27:33.579]  Listen, it's like saying hire more Border Patrol.
[01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:42.582]  70% it came out last week of the Border Patrol now are running the aiding and abetting and giving papers to and releasing the illegals.
[01:27:42.582 --> 01:27:47.005]  So now the Border Patrol is an illegal alien importation agency.
[01:27:47.005 --> 01:27:53.630]  Remember the senior Border Patrol agent on Fox News last week said our job is now to complete the smuggling cycle.
[01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:55.211]  Remember that?
[01:27:55.211 --> 01:27:56.091]  Yes.
[01:27:56.091 --> 01:28:03.076]  So what I'm saying is this is a thousand troops to literally help conveyor belt the illegals in.
[01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:06.579]  Because who does the National Guard couple up to?
[01:28:06.579 --> 01:28:10.622]  The state.
[01:28:10.622 --> 01:28:12.903]  Yes, but they're going to be coupling up to ICE.
[01:28:12.903 --> 01:28:14.184]  Who are they going to give the people to?
[01:28:14.184 --> 01:28:19.327]  The Border Patrol.
[01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:20.548]  And then what does the Border Patrol do?
[01:28:20.548 --> 01:28:24.891]  Turn them over to the federal government.
[01:28:24.891 --> 01:28:25.951]  And what does the federal government do?
[01:28:25.951 --> 01:28:29.073]  Give them green cards.
[01:28:29.073 --> 01:28:32.756]  So, the National Guard will literally be like baggage handlers
[01:28:33.706 --> 01:28:37.309]  For the illegals.
[01:28:37.309 --> 01:28:45.297]  And that's the thing about it, I thought it was such a great thing, and I believe 100% of what you're saying, and that puts me to shame.
[01:28:45.297 --> 01:28:47.119]  No, no, no, don't be put to shame, sir.
[01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:50.082]  I study this 18 hours a day.
[01:28:50.082 --> 01:28:53.064]  But see how simple it is once you see it?
[01:28:53.064 --> 01:28:57.168]  And if we just get that across, the border patrol's all saying what I'm saying.
[01:28:57.168 --> 01:28:58.710]  The head of the union, the deputy head.
[01:29:00.146 --> 01:29:00.526]  Yes sir.
[01:29:28.298 --> 01:29:30.387]  So I don't think Rick Perry is that stupid.
[01:29:32.423 --> 01:29:33.824]  In fact, I know he's not.
[01:29:33.824 --> 01:29:35.064]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:29:35.064 --> 01:29:39.627]  Don't feel bad that... No, I got up, saw it, went, oh good, something's getting done.
[01:29:39.627 --> 01:29:42.728]  And a half second later went, Alex, read the article.
[01:29:42.728 --> 01:29:45.149]  He's gonna say they're not gonna be doing anything.
[01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:47.350]  And sure enough, that's what's going on.
[01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:49.191]  It is unbelievable.
[01:29:49.191 --> 01:29:50.932]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:29:50.932 --> 01:29:53.454]  Paul Watson, but I'm gonna race through your calls first.
[01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:56.935]  Daniel, Fred, Tim, Chris, we're gonna get to you.
[01:29:56.935 --> 01:29:58.116]  Then Paul Watson, stay with us.
[01:30:00.262 --> 01:30:06.431]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:06.431 --> 01:30:10.998]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:10.998 --> 01:30:15.565]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:15.945 --> 01:30:18.886]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:18.886 --> 01:30:24.328]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:24.328 --> 01:30:31.710]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:35.851]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:35.851 --> 01:30:40.953]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:40.953 --> 01:30:41.813]  This is innovating.
[01:30:42.113 --> 01:30:49.437]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:49.437 --> 01:30:53.839]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:53.839 --> 01:30:59.322]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:59.867 --> 01:31:00.167]  I didn't.
[01:31:00.167 --> 01:31:01.128]  I taste dirt in it.
[01:31:01.128 --> 01:31:02.469]  God knows what's in there.
[01:31:02.469 --> 01:31:06.732]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:31:06.732 --> 01:31:12.756]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:31:12.756 --> 01:31:13.837]  That one is better.
[01:31:13.837 --> 01:31:15.098]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:31:15.098 --> 01:31:15.398]  Yep.
[01:31:15.398 --> 01:31:16.559]  I know what good water tastes like.
[01:31:16.559 --> 01:31:17.059]  It's good water.
[01:31:17.179 --> 01:31:23.223]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:31:23.223 --> 01:31:30.567]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:31:30.567 --> 01:31:33.288]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:41.353]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:31:41.353 --> 01:31:42.814]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:31:42.814 --> 01:31:43.734]  It's good water.
[01:31:43.734 --> 01:31:44.195]  Refreshing.
[01:31:44.195 --> 01:31:44.635]  It's good!

[01:31:59.212 --> 01:32:02.273]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:02.273 --> 01:32:04.414]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:32:04.414 --> 01:32:10.596]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:32:10.596 --> 01:32:15.678]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:32:15.678 --> 01:32:20.560]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.

[01:32:25.382 --> 01:32:33.987]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:32:33.987 --> 01:32:36.128]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:32:36.128 --> 01:32:47.314]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.160]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:02.340]  Inc.
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.320]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.121]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:33:06.121 --> 01:33:09.622]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:33:09.622 --> 01:33:14.123]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[01:33:14.123 --> 01:33:15.623]  Target selection complete.
[01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:17.464]  Time on target sequence complete.
[01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:24.144]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[01:33:24.144 --> 01:33:30.509]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[01:33:30.509 --> 01:33:36.954]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[01:33:36.954 --> 01:33:38.335]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[01:33:40.726 --> 01:33:43.108]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[01:33:43.108 --> 01:33:44.109]  You bet!
[01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:48.433]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:48.433 --> 01:33:51.396]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[01:33:51.396 --> 01:33:56.841]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[01:33:56.841 --> 01:33:58.923]  Shall we play a game?
[01:33:58.923 --> 01:33:59.484]  How about...
[01:34:04.833 --> 01:34:09.677]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:11.979]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.560]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.202]  We are at a launch mode.
[01:34:15.202 --> 01:34:19.125]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[01:34:19.125 --> 01:34:23.489]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:34:23.489 --> 01:34:23.809]  We're in!
[01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:26.751]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:34:26.751 --> 01:34:29.293]  We have Soviet submarine watch detection.
[01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:31.335]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:34:31.335 --> 01:34:33.296]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[01:34:33.296 --> 01:34:37.759]  Friends and enemies, the only winning move is not to run.
[01:34:43.336 --> 01:34:56.741]  We're going to finish with some of your phone calls and get the latest from Paul Watson on the situation in Ukraine and then shift gears into an article he wrote last week dealing with the Silk Road website founder who's facing long prison sentence right now and is in jail.
[01:34:56.741 --> 01:34:59.002]  We have his mother coming on for 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:34:59.002 --> 01:35:04.524]  And again, can you be put in jail for what people do on your message board?
[01:35:06.704 --> 01:35:11.065]  Can the police take your restaurant because someone sold drugs to someone in your bathroom?
[01:35:11.065 --> 01:35:14.526]  According to these federal rulings, they can.
[01:35:14.526 --> 01:35:19.427]  And it's a very dangerous totalitarian, authoritarian, fascist precedent.
[01:35:19.427 --> 01:35:20.828]  We'll be breaking that down.
[01:35:20.828 --> 01:35:24.349]  News up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:35:24.349 --> 01:35:28.910]  Bitcoin dismissed as a currency for terrorist and drug dealers.
[01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:33.671]  That's what the establishment's putting out now, as ISIS declares that they're going to use it.
[01:35:35.401 --> 01:35:38.503]  But notice the West is actually funding ISIS.
[01:35:38.503 --> 01:35:40.844]  And of course they're told to do that just to demonize it.
[01:35:40.844 --> 01:35:43.385]  I mean, it's totally CIA run on record.
[01:35:43.385 --> 01:35:46.767]  A big article, how Matt Drudge changed the world with a video report.
[01:35:47.614 --> 01:35:57.503]  And again, even if you don't like Matt Drudge, most people do, he has the most diverse website of liberal, conservative, libertarian, foreign news, local news, videos shot on the street.
[01:35:57.503 --> 01:36:00.605]  He's been doing that since 1995.
[01:36:00.605 --> 01:36:08.092]  He had a big email list and stuff before that, back in the 92, 93, 94.
[01:36:08.092 --> 01:36:13.997]  But that's why we did this video report that's going viral, is to celebrate that you are the media.
[01:36:14.872 --> 01:36:36.169]  I mean, Matt Drudge is out there fighting to keep the media free and open, fighting to keep the internet free and open, fighting to defend journalists that are being persecuted, regardless of their political views, and then I see a bunch of leftists on InfoWars.com, they're a minority, but they're about 20% of the comments, basically calling for Matt Drudge to be shut down.
[01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:38.611]  You people are not liberals, folks.
[01:36:38.611 --> 01:36:41.534]  You are part of a totalitarian gang.
[01:36:43.117 --> 01:36:44.778]  That want to silence your opposition.
[01:36:44.778 --> 01:36:52.580]  Look at how the IRS has been used on pro-life, Tea Party groups, you name it, to bully everyone.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.020]  Shame on you.
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:57.101]  And if the Republicans were acting like this, I'd say shame on them.
[01:36:57.101 --> 01:37:00.642]  Where is your instinct to be free?
[01:37:00.642 --> 01:37:04.404]  Where is your instinct to not butcher the society?
[01:37:04.404 --> 01:37:07.925]  I mean, people are getting the $5,000 fines now from Obamacare.
[01:37:07.925 --> 01:37:10.025]  People are getting kicked off by the millions.
[01:37:10.025 --> 01:37:11.966]  People are finding out it's doubling your prices.
[01:37:13.999 --> 01:37:19.382]  Admit we were right about it being a giant screw job.
[01:37:19.382 --> 01:37:27.806]  And as long as the globalists can run the country and manage crises, they're going to keep creating crises to get what they want.
[01:37:27.806 --> 01:37:28.986]  Like the imploded border.
[01:37:28.986 --> 01:37:30.487]  Let's move quick through calls now.
[01:37:30.487 --> 01:37:33.008]  Daniel in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:37:33.008 --> 01:37:35.950]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:40.452]  I just wanted to touch base on Rick Perry, absolutely, and just
[01:37:40.993 --> 01:37:44.539]  How he's just two-faced is all hell, man.
[01:37:44.539 --> 01:37:51.712]  I mean, you were just posting the article a couple weeks ago about him talking about not even shaking Obama's hand or acknowledging him.
[01:37:52.606 --> 01:38:16.617]  You know here you got him cooperating with him so it's just like I'm so done with all these senators pointing fingers at him but you know that I mean holding his hand when the doors are closed it's like if you are if you're you're part of the problem if you're not helping and how you're not helping towards exactly the federal government's been hijacked it's ordered the drawbridge lowered
[01:38:18.271 --> 01:38:23.255]  Already, more people poured into the castle than can live in it.
[01:38:23.255 --> 01:38:40.728]  The lifeboat's sinking, and we can't even get a debate going about this being premeditated when scores of Border Patrol agents are being fired or being gag-ordered for going on television in this show and saying, no, we were ordered to stand down four months ago.
[01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:47.287]  And the Border Patrol said, go to this place, you will see the bus brought in, we give them vouchers.
[01:38:47.287 --> 01:38:48.669]  And we broke it!
[01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:49.890]  Info Wars!
[01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.853]  I don't deserve credit!
[01:38:51.853 --> 01:38:52.734]  I don't want credit!
[01:38:53.786 --> 01:38:57.607]  The media knows, folks, they know what's going on.
[01:38:57.607 --> 01:38:59.168]  Little info wars.
[01:38:59.168 --> 01:39:01.909]  And by little, we've got like seven or eight reporters.
[01:39:01.909 --> 01:39:06.030]  Counting news reporters, camera people, and writers.
[01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:14.653]  We have a tiny operation compared to even, you know, the Austin American Statesman that has like 800 employees or something and hundreds of writers.
[01:39:14.653 --> 01:39:17.734]  And a huge budget.
[01:39:17.734 --> 01:39:19.375]  They are doing it on purpose.
[01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:21.536]  They're not telling you what's going on.
[01:39:21.536 --> 01:39:21.856]  Go ahead.
[01:39:23.271 --> 01:39:24.071]  Absolutely.
[01:39:24.071 --> 01:39:26.692]  Another thing is that whole white flag thing.
[01:39:26.692 --> 01:39:31.074]  I mean, that's got Obama administration written all over it.
[01:39:31.074 --> 01:39:35.175]  I mean, just like the Hollywood subliminal messages of the New World Order.
[01:39:35.175 --> 01:39:36.995]  I mean, they're just teaching you to accept it.
[01:39:36.995 --> 01:39:39.916]  They're saying, hey, forget about your Second Amendment.
[01:39:39.916 --> 01:39:41.517]  Forget about your ammunition.
[01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:43.758]  Lay down and you won't die.
[01:39:43.758 --> 01:39:47.779]  I mean, they're throwing that white flag up in our own country.
[01:39:47.779 --> 01:39:51.000]  I mean, I think it's deteriorating so fast.
[01:39:51.914 --> 01:39:58.498]  That before the elections come in 2016, hell will be uncapped already.
[01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:01.960]  I mean, on American soil.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.720]  I agree with you.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.502]  I mean, I didn't think Obama would try to stay in office.
[01:40:05.502 --> 01:40:08.944]  I thought he would try to put in a permanent dictatorship of the bureaucracy.
[01:40:08.944 --> 01:40:14.307]  But it looks like he could go for a permanent dictatorship with everything we're seeing being deployed, all the preparations.
[01:40:14.307 --> 01:40:18.349]  And my gut told me it's somebody who's going to let it get a bunch of attention.
[01:40:19.392 --> 01:40:22.355]  Let it peak with, why is there a white flag?
[01:40:22.355 --> 01:40:29.921]  And they're gonna claim either we've given in to Al-Qaeda and ISIS, we shouldn't be working with them, or we've given in with our borders being open, or both.
[01:40:29.921 --> 01:40:35.226]  I think it will be... I think it will be that, but you're right.
[01:40:35.226 --> 01:40:44.434]  They're so in our face now, that this could be some sign where they allowed nukes to be brought into Manhattan, like Obama said a few months ago, that's his biggest fear.
[01:40:44.434 --> 01:40:46.076]  And that this was a message
[01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:59.376]  To Saudi Arabia or somebody that, you know, that, hey, you either post the big white flags, it looks like it was professionally done, you know, that's the sign that you're going to give in and do what we want or we're going to set the nukes off.
[01:40:59.376 --> 01:40:59.797]  I don't know.
[01:40:59.797 --> 01:41:01.978]  This is like a movie, folks.
[01:41:01.978 --> 01:41:02.899]  You're living in a movie.
[01:41:02.899 --> 01:41:05.501]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:07.562]  Fred in New York, what do you think the white flags are?
[01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:08.403]  What do you think of Rick Perry?
[01:41:09.255 --> 01:41:14.299]  Hey Alex, well I think it's just the front, what they're doing.
[01:41:14.299 --> 01:41:15.720]  Nothing is going to happen.
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:21.604]  You know, like you were saying, they're just going to put people right there just to look around and, you know, they're going to be like big flies.
[01:41:21.604 --> 01:41:26.588]  They're just going to go around them, they're going to look at them, you know, hand it to the Border Patrol and that's it.
[01:41:26.588 --> 01:41:27.268]  That's all it is.
[01:41:27.268 --> 01:41:31.011]  It's more taxpayer money being wasted and nothing.
[01:41:31.011 --> 01:41:32.753]  They're not going to do anything about it.
[01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:33.013]  Nothing.
[01:41:34.935 --> 01:41:35.476]  Oh, I agree.
[01:41:35.476 --> 01:41:52.930]  They're just going to let the border get worse and worse until every city and town has at least 50,000, 100,000 illegals in it, and then it'll all be about how we've got to take care of them, or we're racist, and we've got to turn our guns in, or we're racist, or we've got to support Obamacare, or we're racist.
[01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:56.013]  Remember you're racist if you say there's death panels?
[01:41:56.013 --> 01:41:57.854]  They're calling it a glitch at the VA.
[01:41:58.735 --> 01:42:03.579]  It's in the documents that it's a death list, and they decide to not give care.
[01:42:03.579 --> 01:42:08.343]  Oh, you got a brain tumor that's 95% operable if it's gotten out in two months?
[01:42:08.343 --> 01:42:11.325]  We're not gonna give you surgery for a year.
[01:42:11.325 --> 01:42:13.587]  That's the model in Europe.
[01:42:13.587 --> 01:42:18.431]  You're a 75-year-old veteran, you're a 50-year-old veteran, they're done with you.
[01:42:18.431 --> 01:42:20.332]  Go home and die.
[01:42:20.332 --> 01:42:20.913]  And you know what?
[01:42:20.913 --> 01:42:22.314]  America likes it!
[01:42:22.314 --> 01:42:24.916]  America's gonna take it!
[01:42:24.916 --> 01:42:27.198]  Because we have run up the collective white flag.
[01:42:29.605 --> 01:42:30.787]  We are a joke.
[01:42:30.787 --> 01:42:32.109]  Go ahead.
[01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:41.182]  Another thing that you are not mentioning too much that I think is very important is like you guys are talking about people coming from Mexico a lot in Central America.
[01:42:41.949 --> 01:42:59.994]  Uh, people do not realize that people in South America, especially Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia, the amount of Muslims and people from India they make across South America, they age over there, and they start moving up country to country, and they pay thousands of dollars to get here.
[01:43:02.196 --> 01:43:07.581]  I wouldn't be surprised if Al-Qaeda is all the way down in South America.
[01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:09.602]  They admit they are.
[01:43:09.602 --> 01:43:10.623]  They've caught them.
[01:43:10.623 --> 01:43:22.674]  They're catching all sorts of ISIS Al-Qaeda people from Jordan and Saudi Arabia and from Egypt and from Pakistan and that's happening.
[01:43:22.674 --> 01:43:23.755]  It's in the local news.
[01:43:25.113 --> 01:43:29.736]  Again, they're going to search you at the airport and check baby diapers, but the border is wide open.
[01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:30.616]  Great points.
[01:43:30.616 --> 01:43:32.777]  It's all a hoax.
[01:43:32.777 --> 01:43:37.600]  Homeland Security is the takeover army to end America.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.682]  To end the states when the country goes completely bankrupt by design.
[01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:43.183]  It's Cloward and Piven.
[01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:45.644]  It's Agenda 21.
[01:43:45.644 --> 01:43:48.205]  It's the wrecking of the country on purpose.
[01:43:48.205 --> 01:43:51.107]  And I'm going to tell the police something, and the bureaucrats and all of you.
[01:43:52.008 --> 01:43:57.532]  You're not going to get your pension funds, and the dollar's going to be devalued, but it's the only job you've got.
[01:43:57.532 --> 01:43:59.233]  You're going to go along with it.
[01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:00.734]  You're going to salute when you're told to.
[01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:02.095]  You're going to do whatever you're told.
[01:44:02.095 --> 01:44:11.662]  You're going to have a civil war with the American people, and you're going to be slaughtered, and you will follow the orders, because you don't have the moral courage to say no now.
[01:44:11.662 --> 01:44:13.443]  Now, that's a possible future.
[01:44:13.443 --> 01:44:15.345]  I'm not saying that's who you are.
[01:44:15.345 --> 01:44:17.166]  I'm saying that's what the elite think you are.
[01:44:20.592 --> 01:44:30.020]  Why, frankly, it's the Border Patrol and the military and the police are the ones that are saying the border's wide open and these are criminals and we're in a crisis.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.723]  And they're getting in trouble and getting fired over it.
[01:44:32.723 --> 01:44:37.346]  So, as usual, the American people have no idea what's going on, on average.
[01:44:38.283 --> 01:44:40.604]  Even the average Republican has no idea.
[01:44:40.604 --> 01:44:45.106]  I mean, they tune into these Republican talk shows where they're like, Obama's dumb!
[01:44:45.106 --> 01:44:48.127]  He doesn't know what's going on at the border!
[01:44:48.127 --> 01:44:50.068]  Why Al Qaeda could get in and get us!
[01:44:50.068 --> 01:44:54.330]  He doesn't know they set the deal up a year ago with Guatemala and Mexico!
[01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:56.311]  That's come out in the news!
[01:44:56.311 --> 01:44:59.252]  It's all on purpose!
[01:44:59.252 --> 01:45:02.194]  I'm trying not to get angry, because it exhausts me.
[01:45:05.626 --> 01:45:13.471]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson, then we'll go to Tim, Chris, Steve, Jason, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:45:13.471 --> 01:45:29.522]  Paul Watson, I want to get into Kiev sensors, MH17 air traffic control recordings, security services confiscate tapes immediately after incident, the Russians have now released everything on their end, videos of the rebels being shocked that it was a commercial plane.
[01:45:29.522 --> 01:45:34.125]  What does your gut tell you now, a week into this, or not quite a week, six days into this, really happened?
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:48.248]  I don't know what really happened, Alex, because there's been no proper investigation, but that hasn't stopped Kiev and Washington from basically basing their entire case on YouTube videos and Facebook posts.
[01:45:48.248 --> 01:45:59.995]  There's an amazing exchange, which is going to go up on InfoWars shortly after Get Off Air, I've just done the article, between US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Haaf and AP reporter Matt Lee.
[01:45:59.995 --> 01:46:02.717]  And credit to him, because he actually does his job
[01:46:03.318 --> 01:46:07.553]  ...and challenges authority, challenges the official narrative and he basically says, look...
[01:46:08.396 --> 01:46:16.962]  The Russians have just provided radar satellite imagery showing that there were these Ukrainian fighter jets following the plane shortly before it was shot down.
[01:46:16.962 --> 01:46:20.664]  What have you presented in terms of, quote, forensic evidence?
[01:46:20.664 --> 01:46:33.653]  And it's amazing because he basically backs her into a corner and she's forced to admit that their entire case rests on dubious YouTube videos and Facebook posts that have since been proven fraudulent.
[01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:36.795]  So it's a seven minute clip, maybe we'll get a chance to play it later on.
[01:46:37.515 --> 01:46:44.742]  But again, it just shows, you know, any questioning of the official narrative is derided as, quote, Russian propaganda.
[01:46:44.742 --> 01:46:53.531]  You know, we were called Assad propagandists last August when we said that the Ghouta chemical weapons attack couldn't have been launched by government forces.
[01:46:53.531 --> 01:46:56.995]  Turns out MIT report, which came out later, again,
[01:46:57.435 --> 01:47:05.022]  Not the Kremlin, not Russia Today, MIT said that that attack was impossible to have been launched from government forces in Syria.
[01:47:05.022 --> 01:47:10.626]  So were we Assad propagandists for pointing out the truth that was later verified in Triplicate?
[01:47:10.626 --> 01:47:21.816]  Again, are we going to be Putin-Kremlin propagandists for pointing out the fact that their entire case is based on YouTube videos and social media posts and they've just admitted it in a press conference?
[01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:38.327]  We're going to play that clip at the bottom of the next hour after our guest leaves us, Paul, but I tell you, what is your overall worldview right now on the dollar devaluation, on all the wars being started, on the border being collapsed?
[01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:39.988]  Clearly this is an orchestrated event.
[01:47:39.988 --> 01:47:42.732]  Where do you think it's going and how is it going for the establishment?
[01:47:44.107 --> 01:47:49.148]  Well, obviously they tried to seize on it immediately to control the narrative.
[01:47:49.148 --> 01:47:56.190]  In context, it occurred a day after the BRICS countries came out and announced their anti-dollar, anti-IMF system.
[01:47:56.190 --> 01:47:58.411]  I don't think there was any coincidence there.
[01:47:58.411 --> 01:48:04.673]  You've got Ukrainian forces losing battles in key areas of the country, so the timing was very coincidental.
[01:48:04.673 --> 01:48:08.394]  And then you've got the question of air traffic control tapes.
[01:48:08.894 --> 01:48:18.997]  Now in the case of the original Malaysian airliner that disappeared back in March, they released transcripts of the air traffic control tapes within three days of the incident.
[01:48:18.997 --> 01:48:24.059]  Here we are nearly a week later, we've got nothing whatsoever, no transcripts from air traffic control.
[01:48:24.059 --> 01:48:25.219]  And why is that?
[01:48:25.219 --> 01:48:36.003]  Well it's because Ukrainian security forces, the very first thing they did after the plane crash, was seize the air traffic control tapes, and we've heard nothing more of them since.
[01:48:36.563 --> 01:48:44.311]  So we've had this whole media propaganda firestorm about the rebels are preventing people from investigating when they've let all the international investigators in, you know.
[01:48:44.311 --> 01:48:48.515]  The rebels are preventing us from getting the black boxes, they've handed the black boxes over.
[01:48:48.515 --> 01:48:58.966]  And it's actually Kiev, Ukraine, that are concealing the evidence of the air traffic control tapes, which will tell us if that airliner was being followed by Ukrainian
[01:48:59.426 --> 01:49:04.829]  Jet fighters, but it seems they're very reticent to be transparent and release that information.
[01:49:04.829 --> 01:49:07.251]  Maybe because it disagrees with the official narrative.
[01:49:07.251 --> 01:49:16.357]  And the Russians have now released their radar files, computer files, showing that there were jets shadowing the Malaysian aircraft.
[01:49:16.991 --> 01:49:21.357]  Yeah, actual evidence, not Facebook posts that turn out to be fake.
[01:49:21.357 --> 01:49:32.772]  I mean, this State Department spokesman cited this Facebook post by Igor Strelkov, one of these Ukrainian rebel commanders, saying that he was bragging about accepting responsibility for taking down the plane.
[01:49:33.152 --> 01:49:42.354]  Turns out this Facebook page, the Russian equivalent, was a fake made by fans, according to rebels who spoke to BuzzFeed's Max Seddon.
[01:49:42.354 --> 01:49:45.254]  So the words can't even be attributed to the rebel commander.
[01:49:45.254 --> 01:49:50.995]  And the post makes reference to the shoot-down of a military transport plane, not a civilian airliner.
[01:49:50.995 --> 01:49:59.717]  So that's one of the key pieces of evidence that the US government is resting their narrative on, a fake Facebook post that's since been completely debunked.
[01:50:01.269 --> 01:50:03.251]  And it's not like we're just questioning the U.S.
[01:50:03.251 --> 01:50:04.792]  government for the first time.
[01:50:04.792 --> 01:50:08.675]  All they do is lie, when the truth would serve them better.
[01:50:08.675 --> 01:50:12.358]  And they overthrew Ukraine.
[01:50:12.358 --> 01:50:13.459]  They started all this.
[01:50:13.459 --> 01:50:14.820]  They're funding ISIS.
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.982]  It's not our government.
[01:50:16.982 --> 01:50:18.763]  And it's on Russia's doorstep.
[01:50:18.763 --> 01:50:20.665]  And Russia is not expanding.
[01:50:20.665 --> 01:50:22.426]  And Russia is leaving everyone alone.
[01:50:22.426 --> 01:50:25.509]  I mean, it's completely immoral.
[01:50:25.509 --> 01:50:27.630]  Our government is run by evil people.
[01:50:28.530 --> 01:50:30.193]  And the whole world is seeing it, Paul.
[01:50:30.193 --> 01:50:32.856]  And America's losing the moral high ground.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:38.563]  And it's giving evil communist Chinese the moral high ground.
[01:50:38.563 --> 01:50:40.044]  This is really bad, folks.
[01:50:40.044 --> 01:50:41.826]  This is really bad.
[01:50:41.826 --> 01:50:44.968]  I want to come back and ask you your take on the border situation.

[01:53:16.735 --> 01:53:17.235]  I think?
[01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:39.072]  This may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[01:53:39.072 --> 01:53:44.915]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[01:53:44.915 --> 01:53:46.975]  And history is about to repeat itself.
[01:53:46.975 --> 01:53:51.217]  Get my free report at babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[01:53:51.217 --> 01:53:51.397]  That's 888-507-8789.
[01:54:00.996 --> 01:54:06.838]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:06.838 --> 01:54:14.181]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:20.283]  Any preparedness cabinet, any medicine cabinet is incomplete, in my view, without colloidal silver.
[01:54:21.584 --> 01:54:24.805]  We have it in nano-sized particles, the strongest out there.
[01:54:24.805 --> 01:54:27.687]  We found the best laboratory, the strongest we could get.
[01:54:27.687 --> 01:54:30.068]  We've inspected it.
[01:54:30.068 --> 01:54:39.612]  It is extremely powerful and I personally used it with a chest cold that killed two members of my family and that I couldn't kick with antibiotics.
[01:54:39.612 --> 01:54:43.254]  That killed tens of thousands across the country this winter.
[01:54:43.254 --> 01:54:47.235]  And I believe it was the colloidal silver that finally defeated it.
[01:54:47.235 --> 01:54:48.316]  The antibiotics didn't do anything.
[01:54:51.235 --> 01:54:54.498]  It's sold out.
[01:54:54.498 --> 01:55:01.683]  We have a limited supply of Silver Bullet back in from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:01.683 --> 01:55:05.126]  And it's your purchase that funds this operation.
[01:55:05.126 --> 01:55:08.429]  We're here desperately on the front lines fighting.
[01:55:08.429 --> 01:55:16.736]  And see your purchase of Molon Labe t-shirts or Molon Labe belt buckles made in America as a donation to the Infowar.
[01:55:16.736 --> 01:55:19.478]  Plus you get great products when you buy the Pro-Pure water filters, you name it.
[01:55:20.071 --> 01:55:25.292]  Also, we have the Survival Shield X2 from the Deep Earth Crystals.
[01:55:25.292 --> 01:55:27.292]  No one else has this source.
[01:55:27.292 --> 01:55:29.853]  The super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:55:29.853 --> 01:55:31.273]  Hey, women out there, order some of it.
[01:55:31.273 --> 01:55:31.993]  Try it.
[01:55:31.993 --> 01:55:35.154]  You're gonna go, wow, Alex Jones really doesn't BS.
[01:55:35.154 --> 01:55:36.154]  No, I don't.
[01:55:36.154 --> 01:55:38.315]  All we've got is rave reviews, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:38.315 --> 01:55:39.075]  This is a new product.
[01:55:39.075 --> 01:55:42.155]  It isn't coming out yet, but I've been taking it for months.
[01:55:42.155 --> 01:55:43.196]  And boy, is it good.
[01:55:43.196 --> 01:55:49.317]  I'm mixing it all together in a nice little cocktail of a purified water.
[01:55:50.345 --> 01:55:56.707]  And I do this three times a day and it's been life-changing for me.
[01:55:56.707 --> 01:55:57.268]  Delicious!
[01:55:57.268 --> 01:56:03.230]  Notice our iodine doesn't taste horrible like other ones because it's true nascent iodine.
[01:56:03.230 --> 01:56:12.554]  Infowarslife.com, experience the purity, experience the ancient quality from these, they say it's 20-something million years old deposits.
[01:56:12.554 --> 01:56:13.554]  I don't know, it's just wild.
[01:56:14.099 --> 01:56:17.800]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:26.383]  And it's your purchase of the t-shirts, the books, the films, all the products at Infowarsstore.com and Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:26.383 --> 01:56:30.264]  It all takes you to the same place, but Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[01:56:30.264 --> 01:56:38.326]  Madein1776.com takes you right to the Made in America apparel and belt buckles and ball caps and the rest of it and water bottles and water filters.
[01:56:39.873 --> 01:56:42.715]  And, you know, other sub-sites taking places like that.
[01:56:42.715 --> 01:56:45.897]  The Longevity Products Discounter, Infowars, Health.com.
[01:56:45.897 --> 01:56:52.201]  Let's go back to Paul Watson in this segment, and then we're going to go to calls, and then go to our guest.
[01:56:52.201 --> 01:57:03.167]  But, Paul Watson, other points on just the big picture, because the globalists have the power and have the weapons, and still have the dollar, but PR-wise, they're failing on all fronts.
[01:57:03.167 --> 01:57:04.128]  How do you see this ending?
[01:57:06.562 --> 01:57:08.925]  I don't think there's going to be a massive, imminent war.
[01:57:08.925 --> 01:57:13.210]  I just think this is more of a regional pressure valve that they're trying to release.
[01:57:13.210 --> 01:57:18.537]  Because you've got to remember that, you know, Russia's economy is, what, one-thirtieth the size of the US.
[01:57:18.537 --> 01:57:20.840]  Their army is relatively weak in comparison.
[01:57:21.681 --> 01:57:28.748]  In a face-to-face war, that's not going to work out well for Russia, so I don't think it's going into that kind of apocalyptic scenario.
[01:57:28.748 --> 01:57:40.220]  But again, it definitely shows just the hubris and the arrogance of Washington in thinking that their credibility rests on their name alone when they've been caught lying innumerable times in the past.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:49.227]  Again, last year we almost went to war based on a complete fabrication which was again centered around YouTube videos.
[01:57:49.227 --> 01:58:02.198]  So Washington's standard for forensic evidence in situations that could very easily lead to war and conflict is now probably less solid than an internet conspiracy theorist.
[01:58:02.198 --> 01:58:07.602]  So that very pejorative term that they use against us, their evidence is even below that standard.
[01:58:07.842 --> 01:58:09.424]  It's beyond that, Paul.
[01:58:09.424 --> 01:58:21.834]  They say for two years, if you use chemical weapons Assad, that's the red line, and then they have the Saudi Arabians launch a chemical attack, they get caught in triplicate, even the UN says it's them, and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:58:21.834 --> 01:58:25.157]  Sy Hirsch came out and said the chemical attack was a false flag.
[01:58:25.157 --> 01:58:27.358]  That's two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.
[01:58:27.358 --> 01:58:29.660]  I mean, they just, of course, they do false flags all the time.
[01:58:30.697 --> 01:58:38.305]  It's like a child molester gets released from prison, and a kid gets molested by somebody that matches the ID, the cops are gonna go to the child molester's house.
[01:58:38.305 --> 01:58:40.046]  Our government's like a bunch of child molesters.
[01:58:40.046 --> 01:58:44.711]  I mean, they are just the scum of the earth.
[01:58:44.711 --> 01:58:48.154]  Those women at the State Department, I mean, they look like psychopathic witches.
[01:58:50.313 --> 01:58:53.097]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[01:58:53.097 --> 01:58:57.763]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[01:58:57.763 --> 01:58:59.806]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[01:59:05.293 --> 01:59:05.533]  I think?
[01:59:26.067 --> 01:59:33.014]  Months free, right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[01:59:33.014 --> 01:59:36.898]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[01:59:36.898 --> 01:59:43.525]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[01:59:43.525 --> 01:59:48.611]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:59:53.021 --> 01:59:55.428]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.428 --> 01:59:58.196]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.124 --> 02:00:10.969]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.969 --> 02:00:12.571]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.571 --> 02:00:14.093]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.093 --> 02:00:18.298]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.298 --> 02:00:22.382]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.812 --> 02:00:44.322]  Alright, Paul Watson, again we've got the mother of the Silk Road captive political prisoner coming up for a couple of segments and I promise I'll go to Tim and everybody else, Jason, Steve, MJ, Chris, we're going to get to all of you.
[02:00:44.322 --> 02:00:49.705]  Going back to Paul Watson, you had an article last week dealing with the Silk Road situation.
[02:00:49.705 --> 02:00:55.709]  I think this is really important because if they start arresting people for what other folks do on the message board,
[02:00:57.179 --> 02:01:09.712]  Whether it's file sharing or talking about drugs or whatever, or talking about violence, I mean that sets a precedent like the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, where if your neighbor does something wrong, you go to jail.
[02:01:09.712 --> 02:01:13.016]  This is classic autocratic totalitarianism in my view.
[02:01:13.016 --> 02:01:17.460]  Headline, Feds Hijack Silk Road Case in Bid to Dismantle Internet Freedom.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:18.682]  Tell us about what's coming up, Paul.
[02:01:19.878 --> 02:01:22.018]  Yeah, again, it's a chilling precedent.
[02:01:22.018 --> 02:01:35.001]  They're trying to use this case to create bad law, which is basically based around what they call transferred intent, which, as you said, is a website owner, for example, being responsible for criminal behavior of one of their users.
[02:01:35.001 --> 02:01:38.341]  So it could be just a violent comment threatening somebody.
[02:01:38.341 --> 02:01:41.242]  You would then be criminally responsible for that behavior.
[02:01:41.242 --> 02:01:47.803]  It could also be ISPs becoming responsible for their users' browsing habits.
[02:01:48.223 --> 02:01:54.047]  So if somebody visits a child porn website, then the ISP becomes liable for that behavior.
[02:01:54.047 --> 02:01:59.530]  And of course, we've seen with the internet filters, most of them have got nothing to do with child porn or whatever.
[02:01:59.530 --> 02:02:02.072]  They've blocked perfectly legitimate sites.
[02:02:02.072 --> 02:02:06.375]  So this is basically the entree to massive internet censorship.
[02:02:06.375 --> 02:02:13.179]  Some people have said that it's just a real threat of SOPR and PIPA, which attracted huge demonstrations and we actually won those battles.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.181]  flown under the radar.
[02:02:16.181 --> 02:02:30.351]  Aside from the legalities of Silk Road itself, the feds are trying to hijack this case to dismantle freedom on the internet and also push this trusted ID system where everybody has to get government permission basically to use the web.
[02:02:30.351 --> 02:02:32.992]  So it's a massive case.
[02:02:32.992 --> 02:02:33.753]  It is massive.
[02:02:33.753 --> 02:02:38.036]  We'll talk to the man's mother via Skype coming up in the next segment.
[02:02:39.096 --> 02:02:50.119]  But expanding on that, Google, you know, says that they scan your attachments and copy them, and so does Microsoft and all these systems when you use their email to make sure you're not sending something illegal.
[02:02:50.119 --> 02:02:54.481]  Well, that's like saying they're going to open all the mail to make sure there's not something illegal.
[02:02:54.481 --> 02:02:56.001]  It's prior restraint.
[02:02:56.001 --> 02:03:05.744]  It's guilty until proven innocent, and it's being done by groups with proven criminal intent to dominate and control markets and to steal intellectual property.
[02:03:06.952 --> 02:03:11.776]  I mean, if you tried to walk into government buildings without a warrant and search all their stuff, they'd get in your face.
[02:03:11.776 --> 02:03:18.721]  This, again, is an inversion of the basic things that this country was founded on.
[02:03:18.721 --> 02:03:19.622]  Well, exactly, and I mean...
[02:03:20.788 --> 02:03:24.589]  You know, they're watching us more than ever, yet they're becoming less and less transparent.
[02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:26.290]  That's the whole nature of government.
[02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:34.753]  We're expected to be more open, we're expected to have our email read, our phone calls listened to, and just be happy with it because, you know, terrorists or whatever reason.
[02:03:34.753 --> 02:03:41.536]  And yet government's becoming more and more secretive as it becomes more corrupt, which is a direct relationship that we know takes place, so...
[02:03:42.316 --> 02:04:03.433]  Again, this case is massive and it's a shame that it's not got a lot of attention, but I think the interview that you've got coming up will really bring some fresh light to it and make people understand that if Ross Ulbricht loses this case, they're going to then use this law to come after website operators and owners whose users commit so-called criminal behavior and they're going to be responsible for it.
[02:04:03.433 --> 02:04:06.075]  So it's going to have a massive chilling effect.
[02:04:06.075 --> 02:04:10.899]  We need to see the dinosaur press, the new media, all come together.
[02:04:11.832 --> 02:04:16.515]  I don't expect the whole dinosaur press to do it, but there are some people of conscience left there, like that AP reporter.
[02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:21.037]  You were talking about questioning the whole fake Ukraine shoot-down narrative.
[02:04:21.037 --> 02:04:30.203]  We need to all come together and say, look, we need to agree on freedom of speech, because they only want to take that away to then take the bank accounts, the financial freedom, the travel freedom.
[02:04:30.203 --> 02:04:32.284]  This is all part of a total package.
[02:04:32.284 --> 02:04:39.308]  And that's why I want to see an article tomorrow, Paul, really looking at what Matt Drudge has done for everybody's free speech in the last 20 years.
[02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:56.061]  Because he's under attack constantly, and I like the special report we put out the video, but I just don't think it does justice, you know, the little article to how important it is to stand together.
[02:04:56.061 --> 02:04:57.922]  So, great job, Paul.
[02:04:57.922 --> 02:04:58.303]  We'll be back.
[02:05:00.851 --> 02:05:03.133]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:05:03.133 --> 02:05:10.557]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:05:10.557 --> 02:05:21.385]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:05:21.385 --> 02:05:30.631]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:05:31.351 --> 02:05:35.434]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:05:35.434 --> 02:05:39.176]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:05:39.176 --> 02:05:41.237]  Experience the new formula.
[02:05:41.237 --> 02:05:43.819]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:05:43.819 --> 02:05:45.139]  Shield your family.
[02:05:45.139 --> 02:05:46.961]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:05:46.961 --> 02:05:50.122]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:50.122 --> 02:05:54.085]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:05:59.358 --> 02:06:03.180]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:04.420]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:05.741]  God knows what's in this.
[02:06:05.741 --> 02:06:10.003]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:06:10.003 --> 02:06:15.905]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:06:15.905 --> 02:06:16.966]  That one is better.
[02:06:16.966 --> 02:06:18.206]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:06:18.206 --> 02:06:19.667]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:06:19.667 --> 02:06:20.167]  It's good water.
[02:06:20.287 --> 02:06:26.249]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:06:26.249 --> 02:06:33.490]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:06:33.490 --> 02:06:36.191]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[02:06:36.191 --> 02:06:44.173]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:06:44.173 --> 02:06:45.693]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:06:45.693 --> 02:06:46.494]  It's good water.
[02:06:46.494 --> 02:06:47.074]  Refreshing.
[02:06:47.074 --> 02:06:47.414]  It's good!
[02:06:47.654 --> 02:06:51.855]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:06:51.855 --> 02:06:54.636]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:15.243]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:15.243 --> 02:07:18.145]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:18.145 --> 02:07:23.609]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:23.609 --> 02:07:30.994]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:30.994 --> 02:07:35.137]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:07:35.137 --> 02:07:39.900]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:48.845]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:48.845 --> 02:07:53.108]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:53.108 --> 02:07:58.571]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:16.658 --> 02:08:23.143]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:23.143 --> 02:08:31.129]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:33.010]  The Silk Road.
[02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:42.477]  A consumer website that became popular and part of its subculture for people discussing the effects of legal and illegal drugs.
[02:08:42.477 --> 02:08:43.317]  The Silk Road.
[02:08:44.298 --> 02:08:53.743]  You remember a lot of posts that were on there from John McAfee and things and debates about what he was talking about on that site.
[02:08:53.743 --> 02:09:03.248]  Well, his mother joins us, Lynn Albrecht, the mother of Ross Albrecht, the man accused of creating and running the Silk Road website.
[02:09:03.248 --> 02:09:08.631]  Silk Road is an anonymous, consumer-driven marketplace with few restrictions on items being bought and sold.
[02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:17.000]  Prohibited is anything intended to harm or defraud, such as child pornography, assassinations, or weapons.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.522]  The only currency accepted is Bitcoin.
[02:09:19.522 --> 02:09:25.907]  Although my son, she wrote, is in prison, accused of running it, Silk Road operates and thrives today.
[02:09:25.907 --> 02:09:29.090]  I have no private information about the case, but she wants to talk.
[02:09:30.991 --> 02:09:42.157]  About basically, this is what she sent us, about being in close communication with her son and the attorney and to give her view on what's happening.
[02:09:42.157 --> 02:09:50.862]  And she's learned of course it will set a massive precedent from the lawyers and her son and influence new law and impact our freedom and future of the internet.
[02:09:50.862 --> 02:09:53.224]  FreeRoss.org.
[02:09:53.224 --> 02:09:54.364]  FreeRoss.org.
[02:09:56.886 --> 02:10:04.430]  There's a war going on for the future of the press and the future of media and the future of communication and the future of the marketplace.
[02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:07.392]  We are based on the internet now.
[02:10:07.392 --> 02:10:24.822]  And if they can end the basic freedom of that and phase in the new systems of tyranny, Chinese-style net censorship openly being proposed in the US, SOPA, CISPA, it will become a draconian tool of total control openly run by the NSA and the corporations that have divided up the spoils.
[02:10:26.670 --> 02:10:32.735]  That said, understand, I've had the FBI here, repeatedly.
[02:10:32.735 --> 02:10:35.577]  I've had the Secret Service here, repeatedly.
[02:10:35.577 --> 02:10:37.478]  I've had the State Police here.
[02:10:37.478 --> 02:10:40.080]  I've had the ATF here.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.242]  I've had them all here.
[02:10:42.242 --> 02:10:47.606]  They come here and they say, what is this on your message board?
[02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:48.366]  Do you know about this?
[02:10:48.366 --> 02:10:49.787]  Are you part of this?
[02:10:49.787 --> 02:10:54.451]  And I look at them and I go, you know I have a website visited by millions of people a day.
[02:10:55.367 --> 02:11:08.332]  And you're trying to act like I've done something wrong to convince me I have so that you can act like I'm supporting someone on here saying they want to kill a cop.
[02:11:08.332 --> 02:11:12.834]  And if you have a subpoena for the IP address of that person, that's fine.
[02:11:12.834 --> 02:11:14.094]  I'm not going to fight that subpoena.
[02:11:14.094 --> 02:11:16.575]  The person shouldn't be on there saying kill cops.
[02:11:16.575 --> 02:11:21.517]  But don't try to connect me to it or claim that I am aiding and abetting this.
[02:11:23.151 --> 02:11:28.155]  When we have moderators and we use a third-party system.
[02:11:28.155 --> 02:11:30.596]  How dare you?
[02:11:30.596 --> 02:11:33.658]  That's why, again, they swat Team Amish.
[02:11:33.658 --> 02:11:38.982]  All over the country, they'll move FBI in, or others, next door, for some cases, a year and a half.
[02:11:38.982 --> 02:11:40.403]  Famous case a few years ago.
[02:11:40.403 --> 02:11:43.305]  We had the Amish folks on.
[02:11:43.305 --> 02:11:45.367]  And they kept begging, please give us cheese and milk.
[02:11:45.367 --> 02:11:47.748]  And the Amish would just keep giving them cheese and milk.
[02:11:47.748 --> 02:11:49.189]  They'd say, I feel bad.
[02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:51.451]  Just take money.
[02:11:51.451 --> 02:11:52.292]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:11:53.337 --> 02:12:01.743]  After a year of that, they got them to start selling them cheese, which they would then take across state lines and sell at a farmer's market.
[02:12:01.743 --> 02:12:06.106]  Then they SWAT teamed them, shoved them down, put guns in their head, for the jury!
[02:12:06.106 --> 02:12:08.027]  But tell you how the Feds work.
[02:12:08.027 --> 02:12:11.690]  The jury sees your SWAT team, well these Amish must be bad.
[02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.010]  See how freakish that is?
[02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:22.377]  And when the FBI comes in here, they'll go and try to get me to feel bad, like I did something, because someone said something violent on the website.
[02:12:23.899 --> 02:12:27.482]  And then there's a gag order in the subpoena, and so then I can't talk about it.
[02:12:27.482 --> 02:12:28.743]  I can just say the FBI was here.
[02:12:28.743 --> 02:12:31.426]  People go, oh, you liar, being a drama queen.
[02:12:31.426 --> 02:12:38.952]  And then a year later, some guy gets convicted in federal court of threatening to kill a cop and putting the guy's address out, and it talks about me and the FBI visit.
[02:12:38.952 --> 02:12:43.857]  I mean, I'm not, you know, I have to deal with this, folks.
[02:12:43.857 --> 02:12:45.118]  And I actually just laugh now.
[02:12:46.783 --> 02:12:50.747]  I mean, it hasn't happened that many times over the years, maybe 10 times, different agencies.
[02:12:50.747 --> 02:12:53.430]  And now they've got files or MO and don't even do that.
[02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:55.772]  They just go, here's a subpoena, give us a stop.
[02:12:55.772 --> 02:12:57.854]  And I'm here, want some coffee?
[02:12:57.854 --> 02:12:59.556]  Treat me normal, I'll treat you normal.
[02:12:59.556 --> 02:13:04.420]  Don't come in here and go, oh, so you're going along with these people wanting to kill cops.
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:06.402]  No, I'm not.
[02:13:06.402 --> 02:13:08.324]  Well, why'd you remove the post then?
[02:13:08.324 --> 02:13:09.766]  We have moderators that do that.
[02:13:11.749 --> 02:13:13.790]  We'll put the post back up.
[02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:17.191]  Oh, you want to get me to give the order to put up killing the cops so you can imprison me?
[02:13:17.191 --> 02:13:21.613]  You know, I got cameras in here, boys.
[02:13:21.613 --> 02:13:23.134]  Get out of my office.
[02:13:23.134 --> 02:13:24.554]  Give me the subpoena and get out of here.
[02:13:24.554 --> 02:13:32.638]  I mean, I don't know how these people sleep at night when they go out and set up innocent people all the time.
[02:13:32.638 --> 02:13:35.319]  It's shameful.
[02:13:35.319 --> 02:13:37.220]  Shameful!
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:37.940]  And disgusting!
[02:13:39.901 --> 02:13:43.683]  ATF, and I'm going to go to our guest, the ATF.
[02:13:43.683 --> 02:13:46.984]  The ATF!
[02:13:46.984 --> 02:13:49.265]  We'll have gun range toties at big gun ranges.
[02:13:49.265 --> 02:13:50.986]  There's famous cases of this.
[02:13:50.986 --> 02:13:54.187]  You've heard about them, we've covered them.
[02:13:54.187 --> 02:14:03.531]  And a guy will have an M4 semi-automatic .223 rifle, and sometimes they malfunction and shoot two rounds.
[02:14:05.438 --> 02:14:09.341]  They'll put him in federal prison, even admitting knowing it was an accident.
[02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:12.823]  Because the guy is a veteran with no criminal record.
[02:14:12.823 --> 02:14:14.285]  That's who they want, folks.
[02:14:14.285 --> 02:14:18.007]  That's why you know the government is evil.
[02:14:18.007 --> 02:14:22.911]  Now, that said, they could use a case that on the surface, you could say is a little more questionable.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:36.987]  But if he doesn't get out of this, and they're able to get this, it's going to set a precedent to put everybody in jail for what other people say or do on any platforms, including telecoms.
[02:14:36.987 --> 02:14:41.650]  This is the end of internet freedom as we know it, and it's extremely draconian.
[02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:47.193]  I want to thank Lynn Ulbricht for holding, again, the mother of the creator of the Silk Road, FreeRoss.org.
[02:14:48.974 --> 02:14:51.415]  And she joins us to talk about this important case.
[02:14:51.415 --> 02:14:57.097]  Paul Watson wrote the article last week, Feds Hijack Silk Road Case in Bid to Dismantle Internet Freedom.
[02:14:57.097 --> 02:15:06.201]  Government using charges against Rosh Ulbricht as Trojan Horse to pass chilling laws that would make website owners criminally responsible for users' actions.
[02:15:06.201 --> 02:15:12.643]  And again, I've already experienced the Feds trying to trick me into this, so this is serious, people.
[02:15:12.643 --> 02:15:16.765]  Thank you very much for coming on, ma'am, and we're sorry for what you and your family are going through.
[02:15:17.794 --> 02:15:20.956]  Thank you so much and thank you for the opportunity to talk about it.
[02:15:20.956 --> 02:15:23.417]  I really appreciate that.
[02:15:23.417 --> 02:15:32.401]  One of the things that Paul Joseph Watson wrote as well is that he said this is the biggest threat to the future of the Internet since SOFA and PIPA.
[02:15:32.401 --> 02:15:37.063]  That it's really very serious and that precedent will be set here.
[02:15:38.481 --> 02:15:47.186]  Another attorney, Scott Greenfield, on his blog Simple Justice, he said, this is the birth of law as applied to our digital future.
[02:15:47.186 --> 02:15:49.828]  Watch it as a spectator at your peril.
[02:15:49.828 --> 02:15:52.069]  So the lawyers are watching it.
[02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:54.230]  They know precedent will be set.
[02:15:54.230 --> 02:15:57.392]  And I'm trying to call attention to people.
[02:15:57.392 --> 02:16:03.115]  This is much bigger than a case of my son, one man, or one website.
[02:16:04.221 --> 02:16:13.906]  As you said, it is ushering in and could potentially usher in precedent that could affect everyone and the kind of internet we're going to have in the 21st century.
[02:16:13.906 --> 02:16:16.067]  Talk about your son's case for those that may not know about it.
[02:16:16.067 --> 02:16:19.248]  It's been publicized internationally, but for those who don't know, give us some background.
[02:16:19.248 --> 02:16:23.110]  You've been talking to him, how the case is going, where he's being held, how he's holding up.
[02:16:25.330 --> 02:16:30.353]  Yeah, he's being held at MDC Brooklyn, which is a transitional facility.
[02:16:30.353 --> 02:16:34.134]  It's the kind of place that people that come from federal prison go, when can I go back to prison?
[02:16:34.134 --> 02:16:36.215]  This place is horrible.
[02:16:36.215 --> 02:16:39.357]  And he's been there for nine months.
[02:16:39.357 --> 02:16:47.401]  He's only now recently been allowed to access discovery, the evidence that the prosecutors have.
[02:16:47.401 --> 02:16:49.242]  That was ordered in February.
[02:16:49.242 --> 02:16:50.763]  There was a five month delay.
[02:16:51.621 --> 02:16:55.063]  Well, we're waiting and waiting to have this so he can access it.
[02:16:55.063 --> 02:17:01.365]  His trial is November 3rd, so it's quite the, you know, time constraint.
[02:17:01.365 --> 02:17:05.867]  And so he's now working very diligently on that.
[02:17:05.867 --> 02:17:18.413]  I, on the other hand, and my family are working at raising funds to pay his attorneys, who are doing a great job and a mountain of work, really, working with us financially to fight this thing.
[02:17:19.446 --> 02:17:23.387]  So his case is interesting.
[02:17:23.387 --> 02:17:26.908]  There are some interesting aspects to it that we can talk about.
[02:17:26.908 --> 02:17:42.232]  One of the main things that Paul Joseph Watson addresses in his article and what you touched on is the principle of transferred intent, which makes one person responsible for the actions and even the intentions of another person.
[02:17:43.012 --> 02:17:55.865]  And so in this case it would be the website host provides a platform, makes him a conspirator and responsible for what users do on a site.
[02:17:55.865 --> 02:18:05.195]  And you can just imagine what kind of precedent that could set and the impact it could have on the Internet, making website hosts responsible for what users do on their site.
[02:18:05.715 --> 02:18:06.896]  And I remember when this all broke.
[02:18:06.896 --> 02:18:11.517]  I'd seen Silk Road before when McAfee was talking about it a few years ago.
[02:18:11.517 --> 02:18:12.318]  And I went and looked.
[02:18:12.318 --> 02:18:19.981]  I mean, it wasn't all discussions about drug culture and things that people were doing or how many Red Bulls to drink or whatever.
[02:18:19.981 --> 02:18:23.082]  There was a lot of stuff going on on there.
[02:18:23.082 --> 02:18:25.083]  But again, it would just set a precedent that
[02:18:25.743 --> 02:18:34.807]  That I'm guilty when somebody goes on Infowars.com out of a million plus people a day and, you know, says we ought to shoot the president.
[02:18:34.807 --> 02:18:35.828]  Well, I don't agree with that.
[02:18:35.828 --> 02:18:37.869]  I don't want to make Obama a martyr.
[02:18:37.869 --> 02:18:40.210]  I don't agree with offensive violence.
[02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:41.711]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:18:41.711 --> 02:18:44.892]  But I've had the feds here trying to imply I am.
[02:18:44.892 --> 02:18:46.153]  And it's really scary.
[02:18:47.785 --> 02:19:03.233]  Yeah, from what I understand from my research, I never was on Silk Road or, you know, I'm not that familiar with it directly, is that it was designed to be an anonymous marketplace that had some restrictions, as you mentioned, but basically was consumer driven.
[02:19:03.233 --> 02:19:12.158]  So if they wanted to sell on pasteurized milk and not drugs, I mean, it wasn't promoted as far as I can see as a drug website, although that is what the prosecution is alleging.
[02:19:13.381 --> 02:19:17.224]  It was basically, seems to me, a free market experiment.
[02:19:17.224 --> 02:19:19.566]  I'm not saying it was all benign.
[02:19:19.566 --> 02:19:20.047]  I'm just saying.
[02:19:20.047 --> 02:19:20.427]  Well, sure.
[02:19:20.427 --> 02:19:26.832]  I mean, that's why they're talking about, like, basically getting rid of Craigslist because sometimes people pick women up and kill them.
[02:19:26.832 --> 02:19:30.215]  Well, I mean, that could have been done in the old days with a phone book or at a bar.
[02:19:30.215 --> 02:19:35.359]  I mean, are you going to ban walking up and talking to a woman at the tennis courts because, you know, a killer might do it?
[02:19:37.133 --> 02:19:40.455]  I mean, Ted Bundy picked women up with his Volkswagen in front of malls.
[02:19:40.455 --> 02:19:46.018]  Are we going to ban going to malls because a bad guy might pick women up there and kill them?
[02:19:46.018 --> 02:19:48.400]  I mean, it's just so ridiculous.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.281]  That's all the internet is.
[02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:54.123]  It's the same as calling somebody on the telephone or going to a flea market.
[02:19:54.123 --> 02:19:58.065]  Are we going to ban flea markets because somebody might be selling pot at the flea market?
[02:19:58.065 --> 02:19:58.765]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.765 --> 02:19:59.166]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.356 --> 02:20:01.457]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:01.457 --> 02:20:05.939]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:05.939 --> 02:20:11.663]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:11.663 --> 02:20:15.245]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:15.245 --> 02:20:17.927]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:17.927 --> 02:20:22.890]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:22.890 --> 02:20:23.130]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:23.130 --> 02:20:24.491]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:30.314 --> 02:20:33.915]  How can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies?
[02:20:33.915 --> 02:20:37.136]  By having your own in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Rite.
[02:20:37.136 --> 02:20:41.137]  Now you can cut down on wasted food by freeze drying your leftovers.
[02:20:41.137 --> 02:20:41.857]  That's right!
[02:20:41.857 --> 02:20:50.280]  Create your own long-term food storage by freeze drying your own fruits, meats, vegetables, even complete meals with the Harvest Rite in-home freeze dryer.

[02:21:52.507 --> 02:21:57.552]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:21:59.002 --> 02:22:04.125]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[02:22:04.125 --> 02:22:07.267]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[02:22:07.267 --> 02:22:13.411]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[02:22:13.411 --> 02:22:15.613]  That's supernatural silver.

[02:22:29.103 --> 02:22:33.927]  And unlike harsh drugs and antibiotics, Supernatural Silver has no side effects.

[02:22:59.724 --> 02:23:01.325]  Time and time again.

[02:23:04.247 --> 02:23:05.708]  We need assistance.
[02:23:05.708 --> 02:23:06.529]  Please!
[02:23:06.529 --> 02:23:09.851]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:23:09.851 --> 02:23:16.516]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:23:16.516 --> 02:23:19.038]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[02:23:19.038 --> 02:23:22.621]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[02:23:22.901 --> 02:23:26.082]  We are hurting down here and we need help.
[02:23:45.289 --> 02:23:46.190]  Immediately!
[02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:50.973]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[02:23:50.973 --> 02:23:55.356]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[02:24:16.049 --> 02:24:18.674]  We're talking to Lynn Ulbricht.
[02:24:18.674 --> 02:24:22.081]  Her son, Ross, created Silk Road.
[02:24:23.772 --> 02:24:38.540]  He's facing, tell us exactly the latest on what he's facing, how long he's facing in prison and I guess they're claiming he was facilitating this message board and marketplace where some people might have been discussing selling each other drugs.
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:53.329]  You know, we've seen the famous cases in Seattle that if I was your lawyer, his lawyer, I would be using as the example if it went to jury or to shake up the federal prosecution that gets about a 98% conviction rate because they'll rig stuff.
[02:24:53.889 --> 02:25:04.979]  The only way to beat them is generally, and I've talked to top lawyers on this, is to bring out all their past corruption and to start campaigns against the prosecutors themselves and their corruption.
[02:25:04.979 --> 02:25:09.523]  Because they're usually so corrupt, if you start an investigation of them, they'll drop it.
[02:25:09.523 --> 02:25:11.064]  And I'm just telling you how people really win.
[02:25:11.064 --> 02:25:12.465]  It's because it's so rigged.
[02:25:12.465 --> 02:25:17.049]  I would bring up cops known and feds known for selling each other drugs in
[02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:26.778]  In restaurant or bar bathrooms, not telling the court that, that they're using a confidential informant, and then using this to take the bar.
[02:25:26.778 --> 02:25:33.924]  It's real famous in Seattle where over a hundred bars were owned by cops who had set up the bar themselves to take it over.
[02:25:33.924 --> 02:25:37.708]  But I'm just throwing out legal ideas here.
[02:25:37.708 --> 02:25:38.949]  What exactly is he facing?
[02:25:40.376 --> 02:25:45.219]  Well, one of the counts is a continuing criminal enterprise, which is the kingpin charge.
[02:25:45.219 --> 02:25:50.063]  I believe that has a mandatory minimum of 30 years, it may be 20.
[02:25:50.063 --> 02:25:55.967]  Well, I mean, you know, it gets to be, you know, kind of ridiculous because there's four counts against him.
[02:25:55.967 --> 02:25:59.429]  Holder needs a kingpin.
[02:25:59.429 --> 02:26:02.391]  I mean, Holder's name should be Kingpin Holder.
[02:26:02.391 --> 02:26:04.352]  In fact, from now on, that's his name.
[02:26:04.352 --> 02:26:06.714]  Kingpin Holder.
[02:26:06.714 --> 02:26:07.635]  I'm serious, go ahead.
[02:26:08.863 --> 02:26:19.049]  So Kingpin Holder, who lets all these big banks launder hundreds of billions of drug money every year, and all the rest of it, he wants to put your son in jail for 30 years as a kingpin.
[02:26:19.049 --> 02:26:26.353]  Yeah, and you know, that's usually reserved for mafia bosses and drug cartels.
[02:26:26.353 --> 02:26:32.677]  This is because he had a platform, allegedly, where other people did these things.
[02:26:33.539 --> 02:26:38.581]  One of the things I wanted to point out was the kind of language they use in their replies.
[02:26:38.581 --> 02:26:48.684]  One of the things they say is, well, it's okay that this doesn't really fit because federal laws are expansive and adaptable, especially when it comes to the internet.
[02:26:48.684 --> 02:26:54.726]  This is in writing, and I find that extremely alarming that they would think that in total opposition to the Constitution.
[02:26:54.726 --> 02:26:56.007]  Oh yeah, that's the season.
[02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:58.127]  Just be as blatant as you can.
[02:26:58.127 --> 02:26:59.888]  Just be open about the power grab.
[02:27:01.593 --> 02:27:02.414]  Right.
[02:27:02.414 --> 02:27:03.075]  They just say it.
[02:27:03.075 --> 02:27:09.784]  And they say the long arm of the law is far longer than you would imagine.
[02:27:09.784 --> 02:27:11.186]  This sort of thing.
[02:27:11.186 --> 02:27:12.428]  It's very ominous language.
[02:27:12.428 --> 02:27:15.171]  I wish that long arm would do something about itself.
[02:27:18.066 --> 02:27:20.267]  Count on that, right.
[02:27:20.267 --> 02:27:36.355]  The other interesting thing, you know, Congress passed in the 80s, the Communications Decency Act, Section 230, which protects website hosts from transferred intent, you know, being responsible for other people's actions and intentions, in civil cases.
[02:27:36.355 --> 02:27:41.038]  So if we're also being sued by an individual in civil court for the exact same conduct
[02:27:41.778 --> 02:27:43.020]  He would be immune.
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:52.212]  But because it's the federal government bringing the charges, criminal charges, in federal court, uh, criminal court, he's facing, you know, decades and decades.
[02:27:53.192 --> 02:28:09.056]  And our lawyer says this is arbitrary, discriminatory enforcement but as well opens up a very dangerous anomaly that will be part of setting precedent for other website hosts to be held criminally liable.
[02:28:09.056 --> 02:28:11.196]  Well it's also a great way to set people up.
[02:28:11.196 --> 02:28:14.957]  I mean you just send 20, 30 confidential federal informants
[02:28:15.917 --> 02:28:26.939]  On to the message board you don't like and have them all start talking about killing people or selling drugs or child porn and then you just go arrest whoever has that forum.
[02:28:26.939 --> 02:28:37.441]  Well that's really a good point because they say that intent, all they need to be sufficiently proven intent is what happens on the forum, what happens on the website.
[02:28:37.441 --> 02:28:40.801]  It doesn't have to be an actual act that they prove happened.
[02:28:40.801 --> 02:28:44.502]  Listen, I've had the FBI ask me why I let people
[02:28:45.382 --> 02:28:48.783]  Asked me why I let people threaten to kill cops on my website.
[02:28:48.783 --> 02:28:51.264]  And I said, well, number one, we have moderators and took it down.
[02:28:51.264 --> 02:28:55.326]  Number one, there's tens of thousands, about hundreds of thousands of posts a day.
[02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:57.746]  And I said, you know what?
[02:28:57.746 --> 02:28:58.967]  Just get out of here.
[02:28:58.967 --> 02:29:01.788]  But again, that's how bad they are.
[02:29:01.788 --> 02:29:04.889]  I mean, it's really creepy.
[02:29:04.889 --> 02:29:07.590]  Yeah, and they could use this to expand that.
[02:29:09.284 --> 02:29:13.647]  I thought that Paul Joseph Watson made some other very interesting points as well.
[02:29:13.647 --> 02:29:19.131]  He said it could lead to possible... Is a website host responsible for hate speech?
[02:29:19.131 --> 02:29:23.573]  Can they be taken, you know, held permanently liable for hate speech on comments?
[02:29:23.573 --> 02:29:26.875]  I want to do five more minutes with you, Lynn, if you can, then I'm going right to calls, folks.
[02:29:26.875 --> 02:29:29.297]  Another breaking news, and there is a bunch of breaking news.
[02:29:29.297 --> 02:29:34.160]  Border agent pulls gun on Boy Scouts detained for taking photos on the northern border.
[02:29:35.529 --> 02:29:40.773]  But the southern border is wide open and they let border agents get shot and they're not allowed to shoot it back.
[02:29:40.773 --> 02:29:47.639]  So the Mexican drug cartels shoot, the Border Patrol is told to run, but Boy Scouts are out taking pictures, so they come and point guns at their heads.
[02:29:47.639 --> 02:29:49.541]  That's Obama's Homeland Security.
[02:29:49.541 --> 02:29:50.922]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.922 --> 02:29:51.903]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.903 --> 02:29:53.985]  Obama's Homeland Security is trying to set me up.
[02:29:53.985 --> 02:29:55.786]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.786 --> 02:29:57.808]  Well, the border is wide open just because I want to live in a free country.
[02:30:00.287 --> 02:30:03.328]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:03.328 --> 02:30:05.489]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[02:31:02.776 --> 02:31:10.844]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:10.844 --> 02:31:17.991]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:31:18.371 --> 02:31:22.975]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.

[02:32:53.789 --> 02:32:58.852]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:33:11.078 --> 02:33:15.861]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:15.861 --> 02:33:26.208]  It's Alex Jones And again, I want to be clear.
[02:33:26.208 --> 02:33:31.692]  I'm not saying all FBI people are bad It's just when we had him calling up here going.
[02:33:31.692 --> 02:33:33.873]  What's the Obama deception?
[02:33:33.873 --> 02:33:35.695]  asking people questions and then
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:44.902]  When they showed up, they were asking us about the Obama deception and saying, you know, why are these people on your site threatening police?
[02:33:44.902 --> 02:33:45.943]  And I'm just like, come on, man.
[02:33:45.943 --> 02:33:49.084]  You've already talked to us.
[02:33:49.084 --> 02:33:51.745]  That's happened a couple times, by the way, just on that front, different groups.
[02:33:54.033 --> 02:34:00.035]  And you sit there and you start talking to him and you say, you're really trying to set me up for no reason?
[02:34:00.035 --> 02:34:12.520]  When you know full well I'm a good person, and full well that we have moderators that took that down, and full well that you're only here with a subpoena to find out who this person is and I'll comply with that subpoena.
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:16.022]  Because I don't agree with people doing stuff like that.
[02:34:16.022 --> 02:34:16.902]  What is your problem?
[02:34:18.584 --> 02:34:20.807]  They started asking Tim Fruge questions.
[02:34:20.807 --> 02:34:22.629]  I said, Tim, don't answer their questions.
[02:34:22.629 --> 02:34:24.871]  I think it's time for you guys to go.
[02:34:24.871 --> 02:34:26.593]  I hope someday you become real Americans.
[02:34:26.593 --> 02:34:29.416]  I don't know how you sleep at night.
[02:34:29.416 --> 02:34:32.980]  And one guy was laughing and I said, you don't know how corrupt the system is then?
[02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:35.563]  He goes, no, I don't know.
[02:34:35.563 --> 02:34:36.344]  I don't know.
[02:34:36.344 --> 02:34:37.205]  That was another case.
[02:34:38.345 --> 02:34:54.208]  He's being sarcastic, like it's funny, like you're on a winning team with the corruption, messing with the First Amendment, and messing with people that are trying to stop a civil war in this country, and trying to keep civilization afloat.
[02:34:54.208 --> 02:34:57.289]  It isn't a game, folks, when the border's wide open.
[02:34:57.289 --> 02:35:05.851]  But they're pointing guns at Boy Scouts that were taking photos of a bridge for a book report, so it just says in the local news report, federal agents
[02:35:07.068 --> 02:35:13.890]  Federal border agents, probably customs, ran over and put guns to their heads.
[02:35:13.890 --> 02:35:15.690]  Because they're trained like attack dogs.
[02:35:15.690 --> 02:35:20.331]  Citizens you go after, illegals you red carpet.
[02:35:20.331 --> 02:35:27.133]  Veterans get put on death lists, illegals get free health care.
[02:35:27.133 --> 02:35:29.673]  That's KCCI news.
[02:35:29.673 --> 02:35:32.834]  We wrote a story about it, Kit Daniels did, at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:32.834 --> 02:35:33.334]  Just broke.
[02:35:34.189 --> 02:35:35.590]  Now I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:47.879]  Lynn Ulbricht, the mother of Ross Ulbricht, FreeRoss.org, everyone should try to politically support this young man because the site's still up and running and operating.
[02:35:47.879 --> 02:35:51.602]  They just want to set the precedent to go after everybody else.
[02:35:51.602 --> 02:35:52.743]  They've been trying this for a while.
[02:35:53.974 --> 02:35:55.655]  And the problem is, it's like Aaron Schwartz.
[02:35:55.655 --> 02:35:58.717]  Man, I'm not trying to scare you, but I'm sure you've thought of this.
[02:35:58.717 --> 02:36:05.641]  When Schwartz said he was going to battle him, was going to defeat him, and got engaged to be married, I believe they went and killed him and hung him.
[02:36:05.641 --> 02:36:08.142]  And then his father said he killed him with the pressure.
[02:36:08.142 --> 02:36:20.170]  No, I believe they killed Aaron Schwartz because he was fighting similar things for publishing free open research at MIT that was 30 years old as an example of being able to share files the public has paid for.
[02:36:21.390 --> 02:36:29.779]  So, I think your son, because he's been chosen out of all this, and they've tried to set up these file-sharing sites and others for music, and they've lost recently.
[02:36:29.779 --> 02:36:38.207]  I think your son, Ross, is in danger, because he's in the hands of the real kingpins.
[02:36:42.475 --> 02:36:44.756]  We, uh, yeah.
[02:36:44.756 --> 02:36:46.837]  That's very sobering.
[02:36:46.837 --> 02:37:05.687]  I wanted to let you know, and the lawyer just told me, there's going to be another round of motions coming up at the end of July that's going to address cutting-edge Fourth Amendment issues in the case and build on the recent Supreme Court opinion on privacy in the digital age.
[02:37:05.687 --> 02:37:08.849]  You know, a lot of people are asking, how did the government find the Silk Road server?
[02:37:10.367 --> 02:37:14.388]  There's been lots of things floated about parallel construction in the case.
[02:37:14.388 --> 02:37:18.029]  And so far the government has not answered that question.
[02:37:18.029 --> 02:37:25.252]  So I think there's a lot more that's going to be addressed and coming out that will be very interesting.
[02:37:25.252 --> 02:37:26.532]  And meanwhile, we need your help.
[02:37:27.423 --> 02:37:31.666]  Because we have to fight this battle, and we're fighting a Goliath.
[02:37:31.666 --> 02:37:33.787]  They have unlimited resources.
[02:37:33.787 --> 02:37:40.632]  They have unlimited manpower, and we're a small group of people with very limited resources.
[02:37:40.632 --> 02:37:52.620]  And whatever help you can give, if you can go to our website and donate, we also need anyone to stand beside us with ideas, skills, anything you can offer to help us fight this.
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:54.321]  I feel like it's a battle worth fighting.
[02:37:54.321 --> 02:37:55.482]  It's going to impact all of us.
[02:37:56.055 --> 02:38:08.263]  Yeah, and for those that don't know, it came out in Reuters last year in August, just about a year ago, on August 5th, when I've been telling people that I was told by a mid-level DEA agent at the gym.
[02:38:08.263 --> 02:38:19.009]  One time, he was putting his shirt on with his badge around his neck, and he goes, I've been lifting weights with the guy for like a year, and he goes, Alex, don't tell anybody, I'm DEA, oh my God, and then he goes, and then I never told anybody I was DEA, like, big deal.
[02:38:19.009 --> 02:38:23.012]  And then later, he was pretty honest about it, he said, look, this is like 10 years ago, he goes, look,
[02:38:24.033 --> 02:38:25.034]  It's all listened to.
[02:38:25.034 --> 02:38:26.134]  We have access to everything.
[02:38:26.134 --> 02:38:28.455]  What you say is true.
[02:38:28.455 --> 02:38:31.117]  And we've got control of the switches at the telecoms.
[02:38:31.117 --> 02:38:35.379]  Well, that's exactly what Reuters then said, that they're in everything.
[02:38:36.664 --> 02:38:37.805]  Everything!
[02:38:37.805 --> 02:38:41.487]  Your webcams, everything you say on the phone, they're in the NSA.
[02:38:41.487 --> 02:38:48.692]  So they go lie in federal affidavits to judges, and the judges know, to certify it, to then go use illegal evidence in court.
[02:38:48.692 --> 02:38:52.114]  See, it's systematic criminal operations.
[02:38:52.114 --> 02:38:54.076]  And the argument is, well, we're stopping drug dealing.
[02:38:54.076 --> 02:38:54.796]  No, they're not.
[02:38:54.796 --> 02:38:57.978]  They're only shutting down small cowboys.
[02:38:57.978 --> 02:39:01.020]  And again, I have had family in the CIA
[02:39:02.622 --> 02:39:14.093]  Well, the Army, who did stuff with the CIA, who said that they finally quit back in the 80s when they were sent to engage in drug dealing and assassinations in Chicago.
[02:39:15.801 --> 02:39:18.943]  I mean, that's just an example of how corrupt the system is.
[02:39:18.943 --> 02:39:21.544]  The public is so naive.
[02:39:21.544 --> 02:39:23.426]  All you can do is decriminalize.
[02:39:23.426 --> 02:39:25.547]  And it's not the drug culture's good either.
[02:39:25.547 --> 02:39:26.708]  It's terrible.
[02:39:26.708 --> 02:39:39.817]  It's that the government, just like the mafia and the government ran prohibition with alcohol, and it tripled the size of the gangs and corrupted the government, when they ended alcohol prohibition, they brought out drug prohibition to be their new business.
[02:39:39.817 --> 02:39:41.438]  And it's been growing ever since.
[02:39:41.438 --> 02:39:43.919]  We have to discredit the whole system.
[02:39:43.919 --> 02:39:44.740]  Any comments to that?
[02:39:46.738 --> 02:39:53.823]  Well yeah, I think that there are so many people in prison who are either innocent or non-violent.
[02:39:53.823 --> 02:40:01.689]  And it just seems like it's draconian how there are repercussions for these things.
[02:40:01.689 --> 02:40:05.331]  And our prisons are just overflowing.
[02:40:05.331 --> 02:40:15.619]  And yes, I agree that we need to get back to the rule of law and have fair trials.
[02:40:16.784 --> 02:40:23.088]  And it's true, I've heard over and over, that the prosecution will throw everything at a person to try to get them to plead.
[02:40:23.088 --> 02:40:26.110]  To things they didn't necessarily do.
[02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:28.372]  And that just seems wrong.
[02:40:28.372 --> 02:40:32.174]  You have a right to a fair trial.
[02:40:32.174 --> 02:40:34.016]  And that's what we're trying to get for Ross.
[02:40:34.016 --> 02:40:41.180]  Again, Lynn Ulbrich, the mother of Ross Ulbrich, FreeRoss.org, the Silk Road creator.
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:43.862]  How are his spirits after nine months in the federal dungeon?
[02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:49.582]  Well, you know, Ross is a very positive person by nature.
[02:40:49.582 --> 02:40:51.303]  He's an Austin boy, by the way.
[02:40:51.303 --> 02:40:52.544]  Raised there.
[02:40:52.544 --> 02:40:59.046]  But very positive and resilient and sees the bigger picture in this.
[02:40:59.046 --> 02:41:00.947]  And he stays positive.
[02:41:00.947 --> 02:41:07.250]  He taught a physics class in there to inmates and a yoga class.
[02:41:07.250 --> 02:41:11.912]  Now, of course, concentrating on discovery since he's finally been given the material.
[02:41:11.912 --> 02:41:13.432]  So he keeps his spirit up.
[02:41:13.432 --> 02:41:14.413]  But it's a challenge.
[02:41:14.413 --> 02:41:14.993]  It's not easy.
[02:41:15.737 --> 02:41:21.321]  It's been very difficult, and I'm proud of him for how he's handling it, but yeah, it's hard.
[02:41:21.321 --> 02:41:40.156]  Well, he's taking it as a challenge in a boot camp, and we'll all pray for him, and I'm sure he'll get through this, and I'll be another political prisoner when the history books are written, when we defeat the globalists and bring them to justice, but we have grown a giant, vicious, unaccountable, evil, wicked, oppressive, sickening, kingpin government.
[02:41:41.116 --> 02:41:47.401]  Uh, that now wants to shut down our free speech, and they're trying to overthrow every country that they don't control right now.
[02:41:47.401 --> 02:41:48.382]  They've opened our borders.
[02:41:48.382 --> 02:41:49.723]  They're just illegitimate.
[02:41:49.723 --> 02:42:00.872]  And the good news is, most feds I talk to are not even bad men or women, but they have special cadres under the Justice Department that are the political operatives, and they're the folks going after your son.
[02:42:01.909 --> 02:42:03.409]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:42:03.409 --> 02:42:04.150]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.670]  What a sweet lady.
[02:42:29.636 --> 02:42:54.435]  Wow, and her son's very smart, built a very successful, powerful website, and I have personally experienced this myself, where they have gone around to almost every Liberty reporter out there, sending them, with different reporters' names, even spoofing their email addresses, child porn, trying to get people to open it.
[02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:05.003]  We just don't open any attachments here unless we've talked to somebody over the telephone about it and confirmed they've sent it.
[02:43:05.003 --> 02:43:14.668]  But the default position is, when that happens, we call the feds, file reports, and make them do work for sending it.
[02:43:14.668 --> 02:43:18.969]  So, if that ever happens to you, you just expose the fact that they're doing that.
[02:43:22.029 --> 02:43:24.250]  And I want to say something to everybody that's working with the system.
[02:43:24.250 --> 02:43:26.932]  This thing will come down, one way or another.
[02:43:26.932 --> 02:43:31.435]  And you've signed on to stuff that makes the Nazis look like amateurs.
[02:43:31.435 --> 02:43:34.957]  I mean, you're signed on to some really bad evil.
[02:43:34.957 --> 02:43:35.957]  Sky's the limit.
[02:43:35.957 --> 02:43:37.598]  You name it, it's going on.
[02:43:37.598 --> 02:43:44.282]  And by your tacit go-along, get-along, all of you, including the general public, not just the feds, you are now aiding and abetting this.
[02:43:44.282 --> 02:43:46.163]  I am not aiding and abetting it.
[02:43:46.163 --> 02:43:48.265]  I want to get as far away from this evil as I can.
[02:43:48.265 --> 02:43:50.386]  That's why I'm boldly fighting it.
[02:43:52.173 --> 02:43:53.514]  Boldly.
[02:43:53.514 --> 02:43:54.835]  Boldly.
[02:43:54.835 --> 02:43:56.837]  Boldly.
[02:43:56.837 --> 02:43:59.118]  Because I'm in a death battle here.
[02:43:59.118 --> 02:44:01.420]  I know they could set me up any moment, kill me, you name it.
[02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:02.401]  I'm ready.
[02:44:02.401 --> 02:44:03.342]  I don't like it.
[02:44:03.342 --> 02:44:06.884]  I don't even get off on the thrill of it.
[02:44:06.884 --> 02:44:09.707]  Long time ago I did.
[02:44:09.707 --> 02:44:12.048]  I'm committed to being a good person.
[02:44:12.048 --> 02:44:13.890]  I'm committed to being honorable.
[02:44:13.890 --> 02:44:16.292]  I'm committed to fulfilling my family name.
[02:44:16.292 --> 02:44:19.034]  And I'm committed to bringing down tyranny.
[02:44:19.034 --> 02:44:20.215]  I'm on the humanities team.
[02:44:22.827 --> 02:44:27.169]  And it's because that's what I'm made of.
[02:44:27.169 --> 02:44:34.391]  And I'm looking for a few good men out there, and women, who are looking for the same thing, and it's time to say no.
[02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:35.952]  It's time to turn the corner.
[02:44:35.952 --> 02:44:37.812]  Stuff's gonna get a lot worse a lot quicker.
[02:44:37.812 --> 02:44:43.274]  The system made us deny this was going on for a long time, while they grew their premeditated takeover.
[02:44:43.274 --> 02:44:46.335]  Well, we've caught them flat-footed.
[02:44:46.335 --> 02:44:49.736]  And the globalists know that, and they're freaked out, and all their communicators, they say that.
[02:44:49.736 --> 02:44:50.797]  They're losing the info war,
[02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:53.911]  Their own people are freaking out?
[02:44:53.911 --> 02:44:55.631]  It's a gut-check time.
[02:44:55.631 --> 02:44:59.812]  I mean, their own people now are faced with the fact of, whoa!
[02:44:59.812 --> 02:45:06.194]  This is really premeditated, America-destroying, family-destroying evil.
[02:45:06.194 --> 02:45:10.735]  Evil!
[02:45:10.735 --> 02:45:15.756]  And the government's being converted right now to just absolute corruption.
[02:45:15.756 --> 02:45:19.617]  There's a battle going on right now in corporations and governments and everywhere else.
[02:45:22.208 --> 02:45:25.429]  About the future we're gonna have.
[02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:35.151]  We're going to collectively together about the decisions we make, where we spend our money, who we support, what we do, who we stand up against.
[02:45:35.151 --> 02:45:36.532]  On whether this goes through or not.
[02:45:36.532 --> 02:45:49.395]  Complying, being cowardly, caring about political pressure, caring about peer pressure that media creates, political correctness, has brought us to the verge of a ruination.
[02:45:51.263 --> 02:45:54.605]  Of rack and ruin.
[02:45:54.605 --> 02:45:55.886]  We are on the verge.
[02:45:55.886 --> 02:45:58.587]  Everything you've seen is the table being set.
[02:45:58.587 --> 02:45:59.708]  The feast hasn't begun.
[02:45:59.708 --> 02:46:03.690]  But let me tell you, they're dinging the dinner bell right now.
[02:46:03.690 --> 02:46:05.791]  That's what all hell's breaking loose right now.
[02:46:05.791 --> 02:46:08.253]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[02:46:08.253 --> 02:46:12.575]  Dinner bell is activated.
[02:46:12.575 --> 02:46:14.917]  Dinner bell is activated.
[02:46:14.917 --> 02:46:18.319]  And in the minute it takes everybody to get up from the kitchen and the living room,
[02:46:19.198 --> 02:46:31.481]  And to go in and wash their hands and to sit down and start eating politically is about six months in my gut.
[02:46:31.481 --> 02:46:33.601]  They're going to start eating us politically.
[02:46:33.601 --> 02:46:36.642]  It's going to get bad.
[02:46:36.642 --> 02:46:41.003]  All the tyranny you've seen is just the prelude, the opening act.
[02:46:44.343 --> 02:46:46.904]  It's like seeing a thunderstorm blow in and you feel a little bit of wind.
[02:46:46.904 --> 02:46:48.805]  You smell ozone, it feels good on your cheeks.
[02:46:48.805 --> 02:46:52.266]  And 30 minutes later, windows are breaking and trees are falling over.
[02:46:52.266 --> 02:46:55.047]  All we've seen is just the wind.
[02:46:55.047 --> 02:46:55.647]  A little bit of wind.
[02:46:55.647 --> 02:46:58.208]  And now it's kind of, whoosh, kind of blowing us a little bit.
[02:46:58.208 --> 02:47:01.089]  We're like, ooh, that storm's strong.
[02:47:01.089 --> 02:47:10.353]  It's about to hit, like a hurricane, a typhoon.
[02:47:10.353 --> 02:47:13.014]  And I feel sorry for people that haven't battened down the hatches out there.
[02:47:14.414 --> 02:47:15.555]  Let's go to Tim in Maryland.
[02:47:15.555 --> 02:47:16.115]  Thanks for holding.
[02:47:16.115 --> 02:47:17.557]  You're a trooper.
[02:47:17.557 --> 02:47:17.877]  Go ahead.
[02:47:17.877 --> 02:47:19.538]  Can you hear me?
[02:47:19.538 --> 02:47:20.779]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:20.779 --> 02:47:21.800]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:23.201]  It's great to talk to you.
[02:47:23.201 --> 02:47:25.963]  I'm a big fan by a lot of your products.
[02:47:25.963 --> 02:47:26.684]  Thank you.
[02:47:26.684 --> 02:47:33.449]  I got a question, but I just wanted to put this out here for people that really just don't understand what's going on.
[02:47:33.449 --> 02:47:38.413]  A lot of people just don't know the language of the way these people speak to us.
[02:47:38.413 --> 02:47:40.395]  They're letting us know exactly what they're doing.
[02:47:41.024 --> 02:47:46.250]  You can see it in the Hollywood, the political people, all the demonic symbolism they use.
[02:47:46.250 --> 02:47:49.654]  They're telling you who they worship, what side they're on.
[02:47:49.654 --> 02:47:55.661]  And pretty much, I get, I get frustrated when people try to write you off by conspiracy theories.
[02:47:55.661 --> 02:47:56.162]  I'll be like, oh,
[02:47:57.048 --> 02:48:13.174]  You're crazy, you think the Illuminati's gonna get us, but like, when you really dig deep into it and do your research, like, the average person doesn't even know what the Illuminati is, or what it's even about, or who's the- what the spider is that they're in the middle of the web of the Illuminati.
[02:48:13.174 --> 02:48:24.118]  So once you figure that out, and you figure out that it's- it's more than a physical battle, and that it's really a spiritual battle that we're getting that- that's coming upon us, and I honestly feel like
[02:48:24.577 --> 02:48:28.059]  Like you said, about all the babies we've aborted.
[02:48:28.059 --> 02:48:31.101]  And I haven't done the right thing all my life, but I've got my life saved.
[02:48:31.101 --> 02:48:32.842]  I gave it to Christ.
[02:48:32.842 --> 02:48:35.183]  And I know He's forgiven me.
[02:48:35.183 --> 02:48:39.946]  You know, I was like 15 years old and I didn't know any better.
[02:48:39.946 --> 02:48:41.447]  I had an abortion.
[02:48:41.447 --> 02:48:43.428]  And you know, I ran the streets.
[02:48:43.428 --> 02:48:45.550]  I've done all sorts of stuff I'm not proud about.
[02:48:45.550 --> 02:48:53.855]  You know, like selling drugs and, you know, just being out on the corner, just not knowing that there's something better out here for all of us.
[02:48:54.502 --> 02:49:23.697]  Because like, you talk to a lot of people in the inner city, and I live in Baltimore now, and I grew up in Texas, so it's like, I go down to the city, and it's like you see a bum, and I don't mean no disrespect, but you see a bum on every corner, and it's heartbreaking, because like you say, people like George Bush, people give some kind of, they feel some kind of way when they give money to these people, like they're doing something good, but they don't know their real motives, they don't know their real agenda behind what they're doing,
[02:49:24.232 --> 02:49:36.517]  And then you see these veterans on the street, you see a guy with a missing arm, a missing leg, begging for money, and it really just breaks my heart how insensitive people are to the common man that's standing right next to you.
[02:49:36.517 --> 02:49:46.242]  But you're gonna willing to give your money to one of these, go listen to Hillary speak, or go buy the newest Jay-Z CD, and you don't even know what Jay-Z represents.
[02:49:46.242 --> 02:49:51.144]  And like I was talking about with the spiritual about it, people are getting caught up.
[02:49:51.144 --> 02:49:53.705]  I really feel like we're being judged right now, honestly.
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:50:00.367]  I feel like, I'm not saying God is taking his hedge of protection off of us or anything like that.
[02:50:00.367 --> 02:50:04.832]  Definitely not the righteous that are, you know, trying to do right.
[02:50:04.832 --> 02:50:07.195]  But I feel like he's judging us.
[02:50:07.195 --> 02:50:09.077]  And I feel like... Well I agree.
[02:50:09.077 --> 02:50:10.959]  The hedge is beginning to drop.
[02:50:10.959 --> 02:50:13.662]  And we've only got a very short period to hit our knees.
[02:50:14.611 --> 02:50:21.076]  Like, what is it, Hebrews 9, and seek God's face and repent of our wicked ways, and He will heal our land.
[02:50:21.076 --> 02:50:27.901]  And, you know, it's just like the thief on the cross, or the murderer, and Christ says, tonight you'll be with me in paradise.
[02:50:27.901 --> 02:50:30.443]  Changing your heart is what's right.
[02:50:30.443 --> 02:50:36.707]  Admitting you did wrong, wanting to be a good person, is the beginning of changing everything.
[02:50:40.472 --> 02:50:44.334]  You're absolutely right that this great time of corruption is now upon us.
[02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:45.134]  Great points, Tim.
[02:50:45.134 --> 02:50:49.136]  We're going to go to Chris and then we're going to go to Steve, MJ, Jordan.
[02:50:49.136 --> 02:50:54.119]  We'll do a little bit of overdrive as well so we can finish up with your phone calls.

[02:52:00.098 --> 02:52:05.260]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives Ed peace of mind.
[02:52:05.260 --> 02:52:08.762]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[02:52:08.762 --> 02:52:14.744]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:52:14.884 --> 02:52:27.133]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:52:27.133 --> 02:52:31.496]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[02:52:31.696 --> 02:52:33.497]  And they're so easy to use.
[02:52:33.497 --> 02:52:35.699]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:52:35.699 --> 02:52:39.422]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.

[02:52:47.648 --> 02:52:48.209]  Or FakeTV.com.
[02:52:48.209 --> 02:52:50.390]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:59.815 --> 02:53:05.137]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:53:05.137 --> 02:53:07.138]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:53:07.138 --> 02:53:10.919]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[02:53:10.919 --> 02:53:15.121]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[02:53:15.121 --> 02:53:21.844]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[02:53:21.844 --> 02:53:25.705]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[02:53:25.705 --> 02:53:27.246]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:53:29.449 --> 02:53:32.151]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:53:32.151 --> 02:53:36.474]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:53:36.474 --> 02:53:37.875]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:53:37.875 --> 02:53:40.537]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:53:40.537 --> 02:53:43.540]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:53:43.540 --> 02:53:45.901]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:53:45.901 --> 02:53:47.803]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:53:47.803 --> 02:53:53.367]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:53:53.367 --> 02:53:57.170]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:53:57.170 --> 02:53:58.671]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:54:15.851 --> 02:54:19.003]  We need to rally around free speech worldwide.
[02:54:19.003 --> 02:54:20.528]  The First Amendment.
[02:54:20.528 --> 02:54:21.993]  We need to rally around
[02:54:23.939 --> 02:54:31.025]  Getting people, political prisoners, like Ross Ulbricht, FreeRoss.org of the Silk Road, released.
[02:54:31.025 --> 02:54:33.507]  His mother pointed out when she went off air that he did not start it.
[02:54:33.507 --> 02:54:34.548]  I was incorrect.
[02:54:34.548 --> 02:54:35.629]  The feds are saying that.
[02:54:35.629 --> 02:54:36.410]  That's alleged.
[02:54:36.410 --> 02:54:37.731]  He didn't even start it.
[02:54:37.731 --> 02:54:40.933]  He just helped administer it and work on it.
[02:54:40.933 --> 02:54:43.315]  So that's an important point I should have made there.
[02:54:43.315 --> 02:54:44.937]  I misunderstood that.
[02:54:44.937 --> 02:54:47.999]  I haven't read their so-called case against him, just a lot of news articles about it.
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:52.201]  What the constitutional lawyers are saying about it, how dangerous it is.
[02:54:52.201 --> 02:54:53.902]  We're going to go back to your phone calls here in a moment.
[02:54:53.902 --> 02:55:00.184]  Please don't forget this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:55:00.184 --> 02:55:06.226]  Great high-quality non-GMO storable foods that come in unique packaging that's the best out there in my view.
[02:55:06.226 --> 02:55:08.807]  It's the choice I've made for myself and my family.
[02:55:08.807 --> 02:55:13.488]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex or 866-229-0927.
[02:55:13.488 --> 02:55:16.269]  The system wants you to be dependent on them.
[02:55:16.269 --> 02:55:17.510]  Try to become self-sufficient.
[02:55:18.530 --> 02:55:24.975]  And again, I'm having another dose, I love it so much, of the new mystery substance that won't be out for a few months.
[02:55:24.975 --> 02:55:33.801]  We've had hundreds of phone calls since I started putting this in my daily regimen that I take on TV, and I'm not going to tell you what this is.
[02:55:33.801 --> 02:55:38.444]  Everybody loves the color of it and says, what is it?
[02:55:38.444 --> 02:55:42.027]  I don't know what to call this yet, but I like it.
[02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:52.000]  Okay, we've been developing a bunch of different products with different pharmacists and scientists and doctors and people, and this has no food coloring in it.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.603]  Look at the color of it.
[02:55:54.603 --> 02:55:59.108]  I don't know if people can see that, but it is something special.
[02:55:59.108 --> 02:56:00.690]  And it gives me a lot of energy.
[02:56:03.975 --> 02:56:04.955]  That's coming up down the road.
[02:56:04.955 --> 02:56:06.936]  We've got some new products being announced next week.
[02:56:06.936 --> 02:56:11.418]  And the great part is they're great products and it funds our operation, Infowarslife.com.
[02:56:11.418 --> 02:56:13.819]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:13.819 --> 02:56:19.101]  And you're funding the very tip of the spear in the Infowar and getting great prices on super high quality products.
[02:56:19.101 --> 02:56:26.584]  From supplements to patriot apparel so that we can promote our culture and supplant the plastic, politically correct culture.
[02:56:27.683 --> 02:56:29.605]  Celebrate our culture of liberty.
[02:56:29.605 --> 02:56:31.726]  Celebrate our icons of freedom.
[02:56:31.726 --> 02:56:33.087]  Let's talk to Chris in Texas.
[02:56:33.087 --> 02:56:35.289]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:56:35.289 --> 02:56:37.211]  Alex, great presentation today.
[02:56:37.211 --> 02:56:38.652]  Thank you.
[02:56:38.652 --> 02:56:42.915]  I want to talk to you about the opportunity for opening up a new front in the Info War.
[02:56:42.915 --> 02:56:45.657]  Just a few quick thoughts on it.
[02:56:45.657 --> 02:56:56.646]  You often refer to the rites of passage, which men and women come across, that they cross over a threshold and develop into, you know, to the next level of themselves.
[02:56:57.433 --> 02:57:09.575]  And what I think we're dealing with, with a lot of the people that are coming to this country from third world nations, so to speak, is that we're dealing with a whole group of people that have never been, they're stunted.
[02:57:09.575 --> 02:57:15.816]  They've never been allowed to understand what freedom is and what self-determination is.
[02:57:15.816 --> 02:57:25.758]  And although I am not for the illegal immigration, I do believe that we have the opportunity to speak directly to these people in their languages,
[02:57:26.997 --> 02:57:27.797]  To them.
[02:57:27.797 --> 02:57:32.599]  Oh yeah, listen, the Democrats are reaching out to them, and that's how they're converting them over to them.
[02:57:32.599 --> 02:57:45.183]  That's why they want the poorest Latin Americans, who've literally lived in dirt shacks and are just desperate to get food, because they don't want the middle class Latin Americans coming up here, because they'd be great to get up here.
[02:57:45.183 --> 02:57:49.044]  I mean, they work hard, smart, you know, got it all together.
[02:57:49.044 --> 02:57:53.426]  They want unwashed people up here, because they'll fall right into the Democrats' hands.
[02:57:54.895 --> 02:57:56.917]  The Democrats are giving them a fish.
[02:57:56.917 --> 02:57:59.699]  Why don't we teach them how to fish?
[02:57:59.699 --> 02:58:04.143]  I agree, but the influx is so huge that we could never do that.
[02:58:04.143 --> 02:58:08.567]  I mean, even the feds aren't able to handle these numbers.
[02:58:08.567 --> 02:58:10.649]  Just a ground war, just another front.
[02:58:10.649 --> 02:58:18.276]  I agree with your views on the other points, and I'm not making a case for the illegal crossing and inundation.
[02:58:18.276 --> 02:58:20.578]  No, no, I hear you, but we've got to convert them to liberty.
[02:58:22.547 --> 02:58:24.928]  We don't want to be enemies with these people.
[02:58:24.928 --> 02:58:27.890]  We want to understand that they're being directed.
[02:58:27.890 --> 02:58:33.674]  And actually, I found that they're probably some of the most receptive people out there, actually.
[02:58:33.674 --> 02:58:34.495]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:58:34.495 --> 02:58:34.995]  Great points.
[02:58:34.995 --> 02:58:36.256]  Thanks for holding to say that.
[02:58:36.256 --> 02:58:37.317]  Steve, you're up next.
[02:58:37.317 --> 02:58:38.658]  Overdrive.
[02:58:38.658 --> 02:58:41.380]  Then we'll talk to MJ Jordan.
[02:58:41.380 --> 02:58:43.962]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.962 --> 02:58:44.442]  Stay with us.
[02:58:44.442 --> 02:58:45.163]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:45.163 --> 02:58:46.704]  We'll be back in one minute.
[02:58:46.704 --> 02:58:47.544]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:47.544 --> 02:58:49.586]  Not only news tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:50.512 --> 02:58:50.812]  I didn't.
[02:58:50.812 --> 02:58:51.774]  I taste dirt in it.
[02:58:51.774 --> 02:58:53.115]  God knows what's in this.
[02:58:53.115 --> 02:58:57.380]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:58:57.380 --> 02:59:03.408]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:59:03.408 --> 02:59:04.489]  That one is better.
[02:59:04.489 --> 02:59:05.751]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:59:05.751 --> 02:59:05.931]  Yep.
[02:59:05.931 --> 02:59:07.212]  I know what good water tastes like.
[02:59:07.212 --> 02:59:07.713]  It's good water.
[02:59:07.813 --> 02:59:13.875]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:59:13.875 --> 02:59:21.216]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:59:21.216 --> 02:59:23.917]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:59:23.917 --> 02:59:32.119]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:59:32.119 --> 02:59:33.580]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:59:33.580 --> 02:59:34.340]  It's good water.
[02:59:34.340 --> 02:59:34.960]  Refreshing.
[02:59:34.960 --> 02:59:35.320]  It's good!

[03:00:06.294 --> 03:00:11.136]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:11.136 --> 03:00:12.717]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.717 --> 03:00:14.277]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.277 --> 03:00:18.459]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.459 --> 03:00:29.383]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.383 --> 03:00:31.704]  We're in overdrive, checking your phone calls, moving quick.
[03:00:31.704 --> 03:00:33.465]  Stephen, New York, thanks for holding.
[03:00:33.465 --> 03:00:34.025]  You're on the air.
[03:00:35.071 --> 03:00:41.172]  Yeah, I think that Rick Perry and our Governor Cuomo up here are pretty much carbon copies of each other.
[03:00:41.172 --> 03:00:43.833]  They act the exact same way.
[03:00:43.833 --> 03:00:50.934]  The only thing that I wanted to say is that here last week on our local news, they have a mailing center up here.
[03:00:50.934 --> 03:00:53.534]  It's name is the Sikorsky Mailing Center.
[03:00:53.534 --> 03:00:57.895]  It's in Big Flats, New York at the Elmira Corning Regional Airport.
[03:00:57.895 --> 03:01:01.376]  They wanted to put an immigration facility in there.
[03:01:02.438 --> 03:01:07.219]  And the only reason why they got turned down, supposedly, was because of FAA regulations.
[03:01:07.219 --> 03:01:16.861]  And I'm just wondering if that might be a ruse to try to stop people from opposing it.
[03:01:16.861 --> 03:01:17.501]  Absolutely.
[03:01:17.501 --> 03:01:19.182]  They're putting them on military bases.
[03:01:19.182 --> 03:01:22.583]  We caught them building a huge secret FEMA camp on the border last week.
[03:01:22.583 --> 03:01:28.064]  Our reporters are going back down there right now to bust them there, get them ready, and then deploy them
[03:01:29.136 --> 03:01:45.709]  And then through different federal agencies with the 3.7 million Obama wants, just for the summer, they pay Democrat families $6,000 a month for a new business to then get the illegals, get them driver's license, and get them ready to vote to take the guns.
[03:01:45.709 --> 03:01:48.691]  So it's an organized, racketeering, criminal operation.
[03:01:48.691 --> 03:01:50.653]  That's what Obama's doing with the border.
[03:01:50.653 --> 03:01:55.256]  Organized criminal op, hiding in plain view, they should all be arrested.
[03:01:55.256 --> 03:01:55.476]  Agree.
[03:01:57.702 --> 03:01:59.383]  Yeah, that's pretty much all that I wanted to say.
[03:01:59.383 --> 03:02:00.424]  Great points, brother.
[03:02:00.424 --> 03:02:02.265]  Have a great day.
[03:02:02.265 --> 03:02:03.746]  MJ in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:02:03.746 --> 03:02:05.047]  Go ahead.
[03:02:05.047 --> 03:02:06.448]  Okay, right quick, Alex.
[03:02:06.448 --> 03:02:16.815]  When I heard about Rick Perry, I just wanted to say I didn't trust him because I think one of the reasons why he's doing this tactic is because I think he's positioning himself to potentially run for president in 2016.
[03:02:16.815 --> 03:02:17.675]  Of course.
[03:02:17.675 --> 03:02:19.316]  Yeah, that's why he wears glasses now.
[03:02:19.316 --> 03:02:21.037]  It's a reinvention of him.
[03:02:21.037 --> 03:02:23.119]  The big Republicans thought he would get in last time.
[03:02:23.119 --> 03:02:24.820]  I mean, they really like him.
[03:02:26.013 --> 03:02:27.273]  One other quick point, Alex.
[03:02:27.273 --> 03:02:30.094]  I have an issue with Ted Cruz.
[03:02:30.094 --> 03:02:32.735]  I diverted out with him as far as me trusting him.
[03:02:32.735 --> 03:02:43.579]  I know this past weekend the propaganda's Glenn Beck was on the border handing out the soccer balls and the stuffed animals with the kids serving meals and Ted Cruz was alongside with him.
[03:02:44.339 --> 03:02:50.663]  A few months prior, Ted Cruz was at dinner with Newt Gingrich and a couple of other neocon talk show hosts.
[03:02:50.663 --> 03:02:56.847]  Oh, I know, listen, he's a lawyer, he's a politician, he's positioning himself to run and win for president.
[03:02:56.847 --> 03:03:05.593]  I just know he actually votes for guns, he actually votes against abortion, he actually votes to audit the Fed, he votes good.
[03:03:05.593 --> 03:03:08.735]  So, I mean, Rick Perry has a bunch of good talk.
[03:03:09.577 --> 03:03:14.821]  I mean, Ted Cruz says Obama's imploding the border on purpose, and is scary and a tyrant.
[03:03:14.821 --> 03:03:16.782]  We don't hear that out of Rick Perry.
[03:03:16.782 --> 03:03:18.504]  We hear that out of Rand Paul.
[03:03:18.504 --> 03:03:21.786]  So, yeah, I mean, I totally trust Rand Paul.
[03:03:21.786 --> 03:03:23.687]  I'm 90% trust.
[03:03:23.687 --> 03:03:27.970]  I like Ted Cruz, but it's qualified, because we don't know him long enough yet.
[03:03:27.970 --> 03:03:30.873]  And then when you talk about someone like Newt Gingrich, I mean, give me a break.
[03:03:30.873 --> 03:03:35.736]  He wrote multiple books calling for world government and microchipping the entire population.
[03:03:35.736 --> 03:03:36.297]  I'm not kidding.
[03:03:37.157 --> 03:03:39.658]  So, I mean, Gingrich is horrible.
[03:03:39.658 --> 03:03:41.099]  I hear you.
[03:03:41.099 --> 03:03:43.039]  I appreciate your call, MJ.
[03:03:43.039 --> 03:03:45.600]  Jordan, in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:46.941]  Go ahead.
[03:03:46.941 --> 03:03:47.841]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[03:03:47.841 --> 03:03:49.222]  My name's Jordan.
[03:03:49.222 --> 03:03:50.382]  I'm from North Carolina.
[03:03:50.382 --> 03:03:51.083]  Welcome.
[03:03:51.083 --> 03:03:52.183]  I'm 20 years old.
[03:03:52.183 --> 03:03:55.244]  I just wanted to encourage you and thank you.
[03:03:55.244 --> 03:03:59.606]  You have young people listening, and I mean, I really feel like that's what matters right now.
[03:03:59.606 --> 03:04:06.189]  Not that other people and other generations don't matter, but I mean, my generation is the one that's going to have to deal with the majority of this.
[03:04:07.649 --> 03:04:08.069]  I agree.
[03:04:08.069 --> 03:04:11.212]  People have always said that, but now we're all going to get to deal with it.
[03:04:11.212 --> 03:04:12.132]  It's here.
[03:04:12.132 --> 03:04:18.317]  But yes, a lot of older folks have been set in their ways, and the globalists are targeting young people.
[03:04:18.317 --> 03:04:23.381]  Young people need to step up and be leaders like you're doing, and let people know what's happening.
[03:04:23.381 --> 03:04:25.162]  And Ron Paul talks about it.
[03:04:25.162 --> 03:04:27.524]  The young people are really waking up right now.
[03:04:27.524 --> 03:04:28.725]  So it's a very positive thing.
[03:04:29.633 --> 03:04:31.994]  Right, and exactly, that's what I'm getting at.
[03:04:31.994 --> 03:04:46.420]  I know this affects us all directly every day, whether we feel it, see it, or not, but what I wanted to ask you are what are things that I can really target on that are happening to my generation that I can be like, hey, look, this is right in your face, like whether you see it or not.
[03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:50.302]  I mean, it's so easy to try and talk to people about stuff like this.
[03:04:50.302 --> 03:04:56.065]  Yeah, people are ready to hear now, and a lot of people think they're disempowered, so they think, oh, what can I do?
[03:04:56.065 --> 03:04:59.026]  Well, to teach them they have power, like buying organic.
