[00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:13.457]  With all the talk in the news about Ebola, it's hard to know what information that you need to trust.
[00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:20.961]  That brings us to Ebola Chan, this creation by 4chan users, which is the, I guess, the embodiment of Ebola.
[00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.784]  It's even gone as far as some people believing that if they encounter this character online, they will contract Ebola.
[00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:31.706]  But I'm much less concerned about this prank and much more concerned about our nation's open borders.
[00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:33.867]  We did catch some people, I believe, from Liberia.
[00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:43.796]  During the 2013 fiscal year, statistics show Border Patrol agents apprehended 112 immigrants from Guinea, 231 from Liberia, and 145 immigrants from Sierra Leone, the three countries with the most cases of Ebola.
[00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.503]  And you may be saying, well, didn't Governor Rick Perry of Texas send National Guard troops down to the border?
[00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:56.523]  And yes, he did.
[00:00:56.904 --> 00:01:05.530]  But they're working in a support capacity to the Border Patrol, the Border Patrol who is too busy changing diapers and warming up bottles to really secure our nation's perimeters.
[00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.056]  Meanwhile, we can send 3,000 troops to Africa who simply took a crash course in HAZMAT protocol to secure the African continent.
[00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:15.437]  But we told you years ago that the U.S.
[00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.680]  will send troops into Africa under the guise of humanitarian aid.
[00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:25.754]  As well as setting up bases in Africa under the pretext of humanitarian aid.
[00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:30.320]  And dominate and occupy Africa through AFRICOM.
[00:01:30.993 --> 00:01:33.214]  Obama basically does a couple of things.
[00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.095]  One is, again, this idea, kick the Chinese out of Africa.
[00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:37.816]  Kick them out of Sudan where they get oil.
[00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:40.337]  Kick them out of Zimbabwe where they get raw materials.
[00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:44.699]  Start a civil war in Congo, another big source of raw materials.
[00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.360]  Al-Qaeda, an arm of the U.S.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.842]  intelligence community, is now active in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco.
[00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:55.824]  You've got a destabilization going on in Kenya around Odinga.
[00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:57.305]  That's Obama's cousin.
[00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:05.909]  So that's what you need to know about Ebola, but you can keep yourself informed by going to InfoWars.com and reading our natural ways to help fight this epidemic.
[00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.951]  Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:15.074]  You cannot get it from casual contact like sitting next to someone on a bus.
[00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:20.537]  You cannot get it from another person until they show the symptoms of the disease.
[00:02:20.937 --> 00:02:24.379]  That's why health care workers wear protection like gloves and masks.
[00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:39.372]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:49.521]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.602]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:58.843]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:05.424]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:08.044]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:11.145]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:17.026]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Infowar.
[00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:24.135]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:29.402]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:29.462 --> 00:03:30.704]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
