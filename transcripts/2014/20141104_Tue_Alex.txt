[00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:10.768]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:12.329]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.870]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.072]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:22.134]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.374]  Coming up today in election coverage...
[00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:43.823]  This is the big day, the midterms, 2014.
[00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:47.685]  What Drudge tweeted three years ago, 2014 is everything.
[00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:54.489]  And I absolutely agree with him, and now we're seeing how important it is as a major political realignment.
[00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:09.957]  We've got Tucker Carlson joining us in the third hour, and then we've got Project Veritas director James O'Keefe, an interview that Jakari Jackson just did that we're going to be premiering here on the radio today, and then more of that interview tonight.
[00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:24.601]  Six o'clock central, right through to midnight, I'm going to be hosting, with the rest of the reporters, roundtable discussions, interviews with people like Greg Palast, James O'Keefe, you name it.
[00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:34.844]  We're going to have Joe Biggs down at the race between the abortion queen, Davis, and the Republican she's running against.
[00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:39.885]  So we're going to be covering it all, but also looking at the news behind the news, the story
[00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:52.113]  Behind the story, because it's going to be reality, not delusion or illusion, as Dr. Stan Monteith always said, that's going to save this country and save this republic.
[00:01:52.113 --> 00:02:02.578]  We have effectively shot down the political god they were trying to create in Barack Obama, but they will simply give us new gods for old.
[00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:05.280]  That's why it's important to hold the Republicans' feet to the fire
[00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:16.260]  Coming out of this election, because they probably will get the Senate, Washington Post is saying 90% chance, that's what most of their analysts are saying right now.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.882]  But don't forget the secret weapon, that's the illegal alien voters.
[00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:29.126]  And I gotta tell you, I go around Austin and other areas of Texas, I actually don't mind seeing diverse crowds of people.
[00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:33.528]  I think it's interesting, except it's so overwhelming.
[00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:41.504]  And it's so much faster than it was before, and it's clearly organized and illegal.
[00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:56.068]  I walked into a Walgreens at about 8 o'clock last night, and it was like something out of an international airport in Bangladesh.
[00:02:56.068 --> 00:03:01.670]  There were people in Arab dress, Indian dress.
[00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.411]  There were folks obviously from Africa, not speaking English.
[00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.572]  And the people at the front counter barely spoke English.
[00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:11.333]  And there were people clearly from Mexico in there.
[00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:20.178]  And it's just a total, by design, flooding of the country with illegals.
[00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:31.245]  And the headline today is Law Enforcement Defines Elections as Referendum Says Obama's Amnesty Means Title Wave of Illegal Immigration.
[00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:32.385]  Listen, here's the deal.
[00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:34.987]  The Democrats are talking about a revolution.
[00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:43.933]  The Democrats are talking about tearing the country apart if they're not given total amnesty.
[00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:50.900]  And Illinois is trying to pass a law that's unanimously passed out of the Senate and passed out of the House to let foreigners vote.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.064]  If you can get here, you just can vote.
[00:03:55.064 --> 00:04:00.169]  Do you understand that they can bring in an unlimited group and then have them vote as political clients?
[00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:09.216]  For tax money they're given to do whatever the Democrats want, and the Republicans are bought and paid for by the same globalist interest, and they're going along with all this?
[00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.357]  This is premeditated.
[00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:19.784]  If India had the equivalent of hundreds of millions of people being brought in, because they're more populist, it would be the similar equation.
[00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:22.786]  They bring in 40, 50 million, or 300 million.
[00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:25.429]  Well, India's a billion, so you bring in a couple hundred million.
[00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:30.553]  Imagine bringing a couple hundred million people, say from China, and then just saying, you can vote in Indian elections.
[00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:34.158]  Indians would burn their cities to the ground.
[00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:40.960]  And, quite frankly, that's a normal instinct because you're being usurped, you're being conquered, you're being taken over.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.680]  No one would put up with stuff like this.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.721]  But here's the big enchilada.
[00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.961]  Obama's already opened the borders.
[00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:55.222]  So this is political cover to say you better, you know, illegals heckling him and stuff saying open the borders.
[00:04:55.222 --> 00:04:56.583]  He already did.
[00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:57.703]  It's all a smokescreen.
[00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.287]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:08.411]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:14.674]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:18.276]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:05:18.396 --> 00:05:22.619]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:27.943]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:28.944]  Not our iodine.
[00:05:28.944 --> 00:05:35.309]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.330]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.911]  See the informational videos.
[00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:40.873]  Read the information there compiled.

[00:05:47.998 --> 00:05:48.419]  We're good.
[00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:03.902]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:08.165]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:09.946]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:15.290]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.811]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:18.952]  But for how long?
[00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:21.174]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:06:21.174 --> 00:06:25.597]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:28.419]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:40.411]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:06:40.411 --> 00:06:46.873]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.214]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:06:49.214 --> 00:06:52.315]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:59.177]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:06:59.694 --> 00:07:09.358]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:09.358 --> 00:07:19.282]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:22.203]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:07:22.403 --> 00:07:23.024]  I think so.
[00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:39.441]  And because early voting runs through this Friday,
[00:08:06.408 --> 00:08:08.629]  You don't have to wait until Election Day.
[00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:11.611]  You can vote all week!
[00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:21.057]  The Rio Riva County Clerk's Office reported this afternoon that a voter trying to cast an early ballot in EspaÃ±ola today was told he had already voted three days prior.
[00:08:21.057 --> 00:08:30.223]  Activist on the tape goes on to suggest that discarded ballots could be collected from what she called Ghetto Aurora, saying that African Americans and Mexicans tend to throw out their ballots.
[00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:35.646]  And as for those programs we do need, I'll make them work better and I'll make them cost less.
[00:08:35.646 --> 00:08:44.111]  Thousands of federal workers are issued taxpayer-funded credit cards so long as they buy items that cost less than $3,000 or micro-purchases.
[00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:45.312]  Our review found about $20 billion.
[00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:54.187]  We'll save billions by cutting waste and improving management and strengthening oversight.
[00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:56.089]  I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.281]  By the end of my first term in office.
[00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:15.224]  The Independent Congressional Budget Office warning a new fiscal crisis is coming if Washington doesn't get its spending in check.
[00:09:15.224 --> 00:09:20.866]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:24.467]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:26.148]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:39.470]  Yeah.
[00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.372]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:09:44.372 --> 00:09:48.735]  First, Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:53.978]  Ebola is capable of entering human airway cells.
[00:09:53.978 --> 00:09:59.721]  Ebola is primed to be able to have respiratory transmission.
[00:09:59.721 --> 00:10:03.323]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:10:03.323 --> 00:10:05.264]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:10:05.264 --> 00:10:08.306]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:14.565]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:15.705]  to 2 p.m.
[00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:18.546]  Central, we're here live.
[00:10:18.546 --> 00:10:21.787]  And we have a policy of truth here.
[00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:27.909]  That is the name of our game, that is our pole star, our north star.
[00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:39.033]  There was a quote by George Washington, I'll paraphrase it, you guys could look it up, but he said, I have one goal in my life and one thing directs me and that is following the truth.
[00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:40.134]  That is my destiny.
[00:10:41.184 --> 00:10:42.285]  And that's what I'm looking for.
[00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:46.127]  Being true to myself, true to those around me, being honorable.
[00:10:46.127 --> 00:10:50.350]  And being honorable means standing up against evil and not being a coward.
[00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.211]  And telling the truth.
[00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:56.593]  Because that's what builds a better world and builds a better civilization.
[00:10:56.593 --> 00:11:03.037]  Thank you so much for joining us on Election Day 2014.
[00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:08.621]  And normally I don't get that excited about elections, but 2014 is everything.
[00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:10.422]  As Matt Drudge said a few years ago in a tweet,
[00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:23.769]  Because the country is already in such shambles and is already on its knees to such an extent and is being shut down by design so quickly that if we don't turn things around right now...
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:32.709]  Then we have to start going into modes of just not complying with the system at all and just trying to protect ourselves and digging in.
[00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:41.538]  Because this country is going third world 100% and you add to that the imperial nature of government and you add to that the largeness of government.
[00:11:41.538 --> 00:11:46.304]  See, wealthy free countries create so much tax money that it always grows a big government.
[00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.221]  It's a 50 year cycle or so.
[00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:56.783]  Then that government becomes so giant, it starts shutting down productivity, but it doesn't stop eating.
[00:11:56.783 --> 00:12:02.864]  Once the wealth runs out, it starts cannibalizing the society.
[00:12:02.864 --> 00:12:10.006]  So we're following a very predictable, historical, geopolitical, cultural,
[00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:21.194]  Path, and you add to it massive population, seven plus billion worldwide, because these patterns aren't just happening here, it's being repeated everywhere.
[00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:35.341]  You add to it the spoiled rottenness of the general public on average, the decadence, people not appreciating what they've got, even poor people on average in this country are
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.226]  Rich compared to third world standards and they feel so entitled and so upset and so angry.
[00:12:42.226 --> 00:12:51.777]  But I look at well-to-do people in nice restaurants and just how spoiled the women are and how bored they are and how unhappy they are.
[00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:54.279]  And the statistics all bear that out.
[00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:58.264]  This is a country clearly at every level rotted.
[00:13:00.578 --> 00:13:11.904]  The essence of renaissance is enjoying productivity and science and technology and working with others and wanting to be honorable.
[00:13:11.904 --> 00:13:18.648]  The essence of a declining empire is just decadence and a lackadaisical, arrogant, trendy attitude.
[00:13:20.336 --> 00:13:33.425]  Now, there's still huge sectors of Renaissance men and women working hard, who enjoy life, who work hard, who play hard, who have good sets of values, and who are building good communities.
[00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:43.913]  But sitting on top of that is corruption spiraling out of control, and no one can deny that.
[00:13:43.913 --> 00:13:46.595]  Let me tell you what corruption is.
[00:13:46.595 --> 00:13:49.657]  Now, we all knew this, but there was that New York Times headline two weeks ago.
[00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:58.236]  Law allows IRS to take bank accounts without charging people.
[00:13:58.236 --> 00:14:00.677]  I'm paraphrasing the headline.
[00:14:00.677 --> 00:14:04.338]  And then you read the five-page article and it just lists all these innocent people.
[00:14:04.338 --> 00:14:05.178]  There's the headline.
[00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.518]  Law lets IRS seize accounts on suspicion.
[00:14:07.518 --> 00:14:09.779]  No crime required.
[00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:12.939]  And you read it and they admit, yes, this woman had no criminal record.
[00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:17.360]  Yes, she owned a small cafe for 40 years.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.560]  She deposited $300 to $500 to $600 a day
[00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:26.994]  In the bank, where she thought it was safe, so the IRS took her $33,000 life savings.
[00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:29.956]  That was all she could prove!
[00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:31.057]  There's a court case.
[00:14:31.057 --> 00:14:33.919]  She could prove it was all after-tax money.
[00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:38.742]  She could prove that what was now in her account was that she'd paid taxes.
[00:14:38.742 --> 00:14:39.802]  They don't care.
[00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:47.607]  They said, well, we interpret the law that you made small deposits over a long period of time, so it's fraud.
[00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:55.849]  Well, what if you own a hot dog stand and never make more than $300 a day?
[00:14:55.849 --> 00:14:57.911]  And half of that's the cost of your food.
[00:14:57.911 --> 00:15:10.763]  So you're making $150 a day, you work 5-6 days a week, you make $1,000 a week, you try to take care of your family, and the government comes?
[00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:16.889]  Because, I mean, it's hot dog stands, it's small bookstores, it's mom-and-pops.
[00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:19.530]  They don't want mom-and-pops.
[00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.511]  Forbes Magazine five years ago asked, why is there a war on lemonade stands?
[00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:25.591]  Turns out the Justice Department's put out public memos.
[00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.632]  They don't want commerce.
[00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:29.332]  They can't totally surveil.
[00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:30.732]  They're going to get rid of cash.
[00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:32.413]  You're not going to drive your own car.
[00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:34.153]  Everything's going to be tracked and controlled.
[00:15:34.153 --> 00:15:37.234]  Samsung came out and announced what's already been going on for a decade.
[00:15:39.284 --> 00:15:43.426]  Microphones and cameras in the TVs, watching and listening to everything you do.
[00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:47.008]  Uploading it directly to the NSA.
[00:15:47.008 --> 00:15:50.289]  With keyword software logging stuff that they flagged to listen to.
[00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:53.991]  It's being sold off.
[00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:56.932]  Yes, if you tune in for the first time, this show sounds crazy.
[00:15:56.932 --> 00:15:58.033]  We're not crazy.
[00:15:58.033 --> 00:15:59.354]  Reality's crazy.
[00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:01.995]  Before I get into election news, look at this raw story.
[00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:06.197]  Basically, White House connected, uh, you know, disinfo platform.
[00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:17.702]  Alex Jones, Obama put out a green light, close quote, for, close quote, groups of black youths, close quote, to kidnap white women.
[00:16:17.702 --> 00:16:19.164]  That is not what I said.
[00:16:19.164 --> 00:16:23.411]  See, when you read something like that with quotes after each word,
[00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:25.737]  That's a straw man.
[00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:26.858]  That's not what I said.
[00:16:26.858 --> 00:16:40.903]  I said Obama and MSNBC created a racial climate where there's a green light to go out and attack white people, just like there was a green light before it was decried and prosecuted for whites to go out, groups of gangs, and attack black people.
[00:16:40.903 --> 00:16:43.623]  And I said black gangs all over the U.S.
[00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:50.746]  attacking white people, it's a well-known phenomenon all over local news around the country, is the equivalent
[00:16:52.003 --> 00:16:58.687]  of people that, well, I'm not a criminal, but I do go roll, you know, gays.
[00:16:58.687 --> 00:16:59.967]  They use another word.
[00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:14.235]  And then because you don't like someone, you go and two black guys, two white guys, whatever the case is, it's done in all cultures, go beat up some guys coming out of a gay bar that look like they're physically weak.
[00:17:14.235 --> 00:17:15.456]  That's predator activity.
[00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.392]  But it's okay because they're gay, so you're allowed to physically attack them.
[00:17:19.392 --> 00:17:20.412]  No, you're not.
[00:17:20.412 --> 00:17:22.453]  So it's wrong when the Klan does it.
[00:17:22.453 --> 00:17:26.914]  It's wrong when people go out and roll queers, is what it's called.
[00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:29.334]  And it's wrong when blacks go out and attack whites.
[00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:30.835]  And here's the deal.
[00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:37.717]  There is a green light, and no one dare politically correct talk about it nationally, but everybody knows.
[00:17:37.717 --> 00:17:38.137]  And yes,
[00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:50.864]  It was on the news that Max Cabrera, that's done computer work for us for years as a contractor, and his girlfriend got attacked by a group of four black males saying racial things to him and grabbing on her breast.
[00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:52.426]  And it's on video.
[00:17:52.426 --> 00:18:02.634]  Yes, it's true that Anthony Gucciardi had eight black guys pull a knife on him and start grabbing his girlfriend and calling him racial names and threatening to stab him in downtown Austin.
[00:18:02.634 --> 00:18:03.454]  And it happened to me
[00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:13.768]  Last Wednesday night, on East 6th, going to eat dinner, because they got some great restaurants over there, and a big black guy comes up to me and goes, I need money right now!
[00:18:13.768 --> 00:18:15.048]  I gotta have it!
[00:18:15.048 --> 00:18:15.928]  You understand?
[00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.049]  Give it to me!
[00:18:17.049 --> 00:18:24.971]  And I was like, whoa, and then we just stood there and he just stomped off.
[00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:28.672]  This is going on.
[00:18:28.672 --> 00:18:34.514]  Just like in places like Vyder, Texas, if a black person goes to the town, they get drugged behind a car until they're, it's wrong!
[00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:45.891]  It's wrong, but what it is, is it's criminals who are rationalizing doing what they're doing because you're black, you're white, you're gay.
[00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:51.595]  And that's what I said in my speech, not what you twisted and put in this article.
[00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:53.917]  And that's why you people don't have any credibility.
[00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:55.678]  It's why folks don't listen to you.
[00:18:55.678 --> 00:19:00.441]  It's why the so-called left is falling apart, because you're not the left, okay?
[00:19:00.441 --> 00:19:02.783]  You're a bunch of racial dividers, okay?
[00:19:06.508 --> 00:19:10.230]  98% of black people, I don't think are hardcore racist.
[00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.192]  I think about 80% aren't racist, period.
[00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:15.574]  But I think 98% aren't hardcore racist.
[00:19:15.574 --> 00:19:22.179]  But if you listen to a lot of hip-hop music, the whole culture that's being pushed, it is racial.
[00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:25.702]  And I'm just calling it like I see it, and that's a big no-no.
[00:19:25.702 --> 00:19:26.802]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:19:26.802 --> 00:19:28.764]  You don't control reality, Raw Story.
[00:19:30.236 --> 00:19:35.620]  And see, it isn't some set narrative where I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat, or I'm pro-black or I'm anti-black.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.701]  I'm pro-human.
[00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:43.405]  That's why I'm against creating race-specific bio-weapons to use on black people, or setting up abortuaries in all the black neighborhoods.
[00:19:43.405 --> 00:19:49.650]  Because I care about every person's soul and who they are as an individual, not off what color they are, but
[00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:57.835]  When groups are organizing to racially attack me because of what color I am, I'm gonna speak out against it, and I'm proud of it!
[00:19:57.835 --> 00:20:00.697]  So keep writing your stupid articles!
[00:20:00.697 --> 00:20:01.718]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:05.141]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water!
[00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:06.822]  Good thing we have the Berkey System!
[00:20:06.822 --> 00:20:08.503]  It's the cleanest, best water ever!
[00:20:08.763 --> 00:20:14.285]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:20:14.285 --> 00:20:15.426]  I know, right?
[00:20:15.426 --> 00:20:16.746]  You love it, too!
[00:20:16.746 --> 00:20:18.187]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:20:18.187 --> 00:20:19.207]  Let's go get some!

[00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:14.846]  As incomes drop, food prices rise, and job markets remain abysmal.

[00:24:29.788 --> 00:24:33.452]  We're also going to post at the top of that page the video player box.
[00:24:34.882 --> 00:24:43.769]  Where you can get the free feed, not just of this daytime show that's always there, the radio show, but of the nightly news.
[00:24:43.769 --> 00:24:58.041]  And if you want real in-depth analysis of what the candidates are really doing, what the election returns are showing, what this political realignment means, what we can expect Obama to do with executive orders, can we force the new Republican Senate, if they do take the Senate,
[00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:01.822]  Uh, to start prosecuting these criminals and turn the tide.
[00:25:01.822 --> 00:25:12.005]  Because we have to send a message to stop the arrogance and lawlessness and political persecution of the press, of the people, of the Tea Party.
[00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:15.226]  We have to reverse this or it's only going to get worse.
[00:25:16.544 --> 00:25:22.630]  We're already living in an age where the IRS says, yes, we come after people that don't want to turn their guns in.
[00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:28.256]  Yes, if you're in the Tea Party, we're going to come after you in an attempt to create fear and take over the nation.
[00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:31.780]  These are true totalitarian authoritarians.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.743]  I'll also send out a link at the end of the show today in the free newsletter.
[00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.984]  at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

[00:25:54.914 --> 00:26:00.517]  Now, I want to open the phones up here today to get your take on the election.
[00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.278]  Is this a political realignment?
[00:26:02.278 --> 00:26:03.539]  Do you have any hope that
[00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:10.825]  The hundreds of two-party candidates being elected each cycle to state government.
[00:26:10.825 --> 00:26:15.089]  The dozens being elected each cycle to Congress.
[00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:18.632]  The thousands being elected each cycle to local government.
[00:26:18.632 --> 00:26:28.422]  This is the big up-and-coming movement that has the Republican and Democratic leadership organizing, pooling funds, and going after them.
[00:26:29.542 --> 00:26:33.044]  That tells you they're the bombers that are over the target.
[00:26:33.044 --> 00:26:34.885]  Do you have any faith in that?
[00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:37.667]  Are you going to run for office?
[00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:40.489]  What do you expect to come in tonight's election?
[00:26:40.489 --> 00:26:49.954]  What do you think about all the massive news of electronic fraud going on for the Democrats mainly, and of ballots being handed out to illegals, and of James O'Keefe
[00:26:51.854 --> 00:26:54.857]  Being able to go out and vote 20 times.
[00:26:54.857 --> 00:26:58.280]  He got to the point of voting and then didn't commit the fraud.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.441]  But went and showed the fraud.
[00:26:59.441 --> 00:27:00.862]  He'd say, let me show you my ID.
[00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:02.904]  Oh no, sir, we don't want that.
[00:27:02.904 --> 00:27:08.269]  You can go online, get somebody off the rolls who's known to have not voted in a long time.
[00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:10.531]  It's all listed by the Democrats.
[00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:16.076]  They put out lists so you can go engage in fraud and then you dare try to show ID.
[00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:20.008]  To show it's you, that you registered.
[00:27:20.008 --> 00:27:21.309]  This is identity theft.
[00:27:21.309 --> 00:27:24.251]  You should want to have that proven.
[00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:25.912]  And they say, no.
[00:27:25.912 --> 00:27:28.254]  Only a couple states are demanding ID.
[00:27:28.254 --> 00:27:32.377]  Texas is one of them, and we're being sued.
[00:27:32.377 --> 00:27:35.159]  It's outrageous.
[00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:38.202]  To be usurped like this.
[00:27:38.202 --> 00:27:42.525]  And to talk to the illegals.
[00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:45.047]  And they openly say, like in the video Utopia,
[00:27:47.145 --> 00:27:53.586]  They say, well, we fled Central America because of socialism, but we're up here basically to get some of the free stuff.
[00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:55.447]  But you know socialism destroys your country.
[00:27:55.447 --> 00:27:57.867]  I know, but who can turn down free stuff?
[00:27:57.867 --> 00:28:04.028]  And then they vote for Democrats who will take their guns and who think their kids belong to the state.
[00:28:04.028 --> 00:28:05.869]  All because of short-term thinking.
[00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:10.670]  And it's the lottery ticket mentality that isn't just in the third world, it's here in America.
[00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:16.051]  It's wherever there's ignorance, wherever there's desperation, wherever there's poverty, wherever there's sewage running down the street.
[00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:27.422]  Wherever there's the end of prosperity, people want the get-rich-quick scheme.
[00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:31.564]  They want the scam.
[00:28:31.564 --> 00:28:46.074]  We've tried to go out and pick up homeless people that look, you know, half sane and take them to the mall and get them clothes and we never really air the specials because it would just be exploitive to lie and say it helped them and then they run right back in an hour later and try to sell the suit.
[00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:57.643]  To get even more money when we've just given them a couple thousand dollars and they're trying to go get them an apartment and then they won't even fill out the paperwork for the apartment basically.
[00:28:57.643 --> 00:28:59.305]  That happened years ago and then again recently.
[00:29:02.358 --> 00:29:05.021]  And you just can't help them, and they don't want to be helped.

[00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.399]  When the Republicans help write Obamacare?
[00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:36.904]  Really?

[00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:39.485]  Really?

[00:35:45.068 --> 00:35:47.849]  Let's go out there and sock it to them.

[00:35:59.374 --> 00:36:00.254]  Up 5 points from yesterday.
[00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:07.940]  Paper says, where did Obama go wrong?
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.821]  Well, he did his job.
[00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:10.984]  He's meant to take the blame for the globalist agenda.
[00:36:10.984 --> 00:36:12.986]  They'll hand it over to a new puppet.
[00:36:12.986 --> 00:36:17.750]  That's why they don't want the Tea Party, because it might not be totally controlled.

[00:36:41.522 --> 00:36:44.865]  You mean tidal wave after tidal wave.

[00:36:57.172 --> 00:37:00.535]  GOP win would put Fed under microscope.
[00:37:00.535 --> 00:37:02.998]  That's the private Federal Reserve that calls itself the Fed.
[00:37:02.998 --> 00:37:05.160]  Maybe I should just call myself the Fed.

[00:37:06.922 --> 00:37:09.465]  Guide to what to watch on election night.

[00:37:12.822 --> 00:37:14.643]  Fateful evening as he collapses.
[00:37:14.643 --> 00:37:19.084]  30-year-old Republican set to be youngest Congresswoman ever.

[00:37:23.305 --> 00:37:25.566]  Connecticut vote mess.
[00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:26.466]  No monitors.
[00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:27.986]  Missing registration books.
[00:37:27.986 --> 00:37:29.147]  Broken machines.
[00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:33.948]  Thieves steal digital voter info box from DC polling site.
[00:37:33.948 --> 00:37:35.309]  And then there's video.
[00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:36.389]  Vote for Republicans.
[00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:40.992]  Automatically registers for Democrats and there's video of it.
[00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:47.399]  We have much of that same news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on our elections page.
[00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:50.863]  But Drudge has it all front and center, easy to access.
[00:37:53.047 --> 00:37:57.510]  The globalists, like a teeter-totter, pass power back and forth, but their main agenda continues on.
[00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:04.734]  Carol Quigley wrote about that in Tragedy and Hope back in the 60s, that they want the illusion that you can have change, but that you don't really get it.
[00:38:04.734 --> 00:38:10.318]  Mark Twain famously said about politics that politics are like diapers.
[00:38:10.318 --> 00:38:14.080]  They should be changed often and for the same reason.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:20.124]  And to give you another Mark Twain quote, we have up on the front page of InfoWars.com in the Featured Stories area.
[00:38:20.124 --> 00:38:21.585]  If voting made any difference,
[00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:23.952]  They wouldn't let us do it.
[00:38:23.952 --> 00:38:47.863]  Well, if you vote and you try to keep integrity in the voting system, and if you get jury duty and grand jury duty, and if you are politically vocal and promote the ideas of freedom, and if people don't want to be pushed around or cheated, and don't put up with being pushed around or cheated by corporations or government, period, or other individuals, a nation of sheepdogs won't be ruled by wolves.
[00:38:47.863 --> 00:38:50.264]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by what?
[00:38:50.264 --> 00:38:52.245]  To quote Thomas Jefferson, wolves.
[00:38:53.712 --> 00:39:12.364]  So if we act like lazy, dumb, gullible, cowardly, stupid people that don't know how to skin a bucket around a trot line, or don't know how to run a business, or don't want to raise our kids, or won't stand up to somebody when they try to push us around, we will have a culture ruled by bullies, inherently.
[00:39:12.364 --> 00:39:15.386]  And that's what we now face.
[00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:17.187]  That's what we're now going under.
[00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:18.448]  It has a word.
[00:39:18.448 --> 00:39:20.810]  It has a name.
[00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.611]  Tyrannous.
[00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:22.971]  Tyrant.
[00:39:24.448 --> 00:39:26.448]  The Great Oppressor.
[00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:27.869]  The Dominator.
[00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:29.209]  The Strongman.
[00:39:29.209 --> 00:39:35.270]  And see, then it isn't about you building a better business or a better restaurant or a better quality product.
[00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.811]  It's about you got a bunch of guys with guns and nobody else has guns.
[00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:41.771]  Like Mao Tse-Tung said, political power goes out of the barrel of the gun.
[00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:43.112]  Biggest mass murder in history.
[00:39:43.112 --> 00:39:46.012]  The David Rockefeller praise in the New York Times when Mao Tse-Tung died in 1976.
[00:39:46.012 --> 00:39:46.332]  Or was it 77?
[00:39:50.834 --> 00:39:56.279]  And they're just sitting there, arming to the teeth, militarizing against us, saying, turn your gun in.
[00:39:56.279 --> 00:39:57.941]  Turn your gun in.
[00:39:57.941 --> 00:39:58.882]  Turn your gun in.
[00:39:58.882 --> 00:40:01.264]  Just let us run your kids, let us run your life.
[00:40:01.264 --> 00:40:03.146]  Live in a 200 square foot apartment.
[00:40:03.146 --> 00:40:04.047]  Don't have a car.
[00:40:04.047 --> 00:40:04.788]  It's for your good.
[00:40:04.788 --> 00:40:05.929]  It's trendy!
[00:40:05.929 --> 00:40:07.590]  It's fun!
[00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.853]  By the way, we're going to drive giant armored vehicles and live in palaces.
[00:40:11.906 --> 00:40:13.406]  Al Gore, all of them.
[00:40:13.406 --> 00:40:18.288]  This is a criminal network using your good nature to bamboozle you.
[00:40:18.288 --> 00:40:20.608]  And this is where it all really started.
[00:40:20.608 --> 00:40:26.370]  Americans were the most untrusting of government, the most inventions, the most aggressive.
[00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.030]  Other foreign countries wrote about it.
[00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:33.152]  The worst people to get in a fight with, the worst people to mess with, the best people to be in business with.
[00:40:33.152 --> 00:40:34.012]  We were exceptional.
[00:40:35.236 --> 00:40:57.607]  Because whether you were Native American, or a black person, or a white immigrant, or whoever, you came from incredible wars, and conflict, and you had to be tough, and it was rough, and people didn't play games, and if you were rude to somebody, they'd say, hey, apologize, or I want to meet you in the street right now with swords.
[00:40:57.607 --> 00:40:59.648]  You couldn't back down.
[00:40:59.648 --> 00:41:02.869]  You want to run your mouth outside now?
[00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:04.310]  Or do you want to use pistols?
[00:41:07.022 --> 00:41:10.043]  You just shot your mouth off!
[00:41:10.043 --> 00:41:11.104]  See?
[00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:15.726]  Everybody thinks of the old westerns based on the 1860s and 70s as where all that stuff went on.
[00:41:15.726 --> 00:41:19.267]  That's when they popularized it and I'll meet you outside and nobody will get in trouble.
[00:41:19.267 --> 00:41:21.508]  That was a duel.
[00:41:21.508 --> 00:41:24.089]  But that got phased out by the 1880s.
[00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:34.233]  Where all the real duels went on was in New York and Boston and in Virginia and all over that area of the country.
[00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:35.994]  There were duels every day in major cities.
[00:41:37.824 --> 00:41:43.449]  Can you imagine government treating someone rudely today?
[00:41:43.449 --> 00:41:47.272]  When the government bureaucrat, you'd say, I challenge you!
[00:41:47.272 --> 00:41:48.553]  Slap you in the face!
[00:41:48.553 --> 00:41:50.095]  Come outside right now!
[00:41:50.095 --> 00:41:52.757]  I'm gonna kill you!
[00:41:52.757 --> 00:41:54.819]  See, that's why people were so polite.
[00:41:56.567 --> 00:42:00.069]  And it was the same thing in Europe and it was the same thing in ancient Japan.
[00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:03.710]  You smarted off to somebody, you better be ready to fight to the death.
[00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:11.474]  Not because people were looking for trouble, people were very polite and very nice and were all about their name and all about having the high road.
[00:42:11.474 --> 00:42:16.756]  And let me tell you something, in successful quarters, in business and in life, that's what the people are like.
[00:42:18.393 --> 00:42:28.417]  And there's still that America that has businesses and companies and industries and it's still there operating but getting almost none of the money it produces to reinvest.
[00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:31.918]  So a lot of people are just turning off their factories, turning off their companies.
[00:42:31.918 --> 00:42:33.658]  They've got enough family wealth to retire.
[00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:36.119]  They're just disappearing or they're leaving the country.
[00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:37.860]  They're moving to places that have more freedom.
[00:42:41.442 --> 00:42:42.843]  So that's what's happening.
[00:42:42.843 --> 00:42:47.607]  And we are forgetting all those lessons and are acting like a nation of slaves.
[00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:50.690]  I want to get into your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:42:50.690 --> 00:43:02.521]  I want to get into Justice Department dispatches poll monitors for Election Day.
[00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:03.582]  But this happens.
[00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:10.429]  Almost every day on the street, it happens in emails every few minutes when we look.
[00:43:10.429 --> 00:43:14.933]  It happens in calls when we don't screen your calls, people calling off-topic.
[00:43:14.933 --> 00:43:18.155]  You hear the rave reviews of Survival Shield X-Tube.
[00:43:18.155 --> 00:43:21.777]  You hear the rave reviews of Super Male Vitality for Female Vitality.
[00:43:21.777 --> 00:43:25.480]  It's because other folks just put their money in their marketing.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.061]  They don't put it in the products.
[00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:33.766]  We only sell and promote and develop what is blow-your-doors-off powerful.
[00:43:35.015 --> 00:43:38.176]  Certified Bonafide.
[00:43:38.176 --> 00:43:39.517]  Oxy-Powder.
[00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:42.518]  That we're the main distributor for and are able to sell at the lowest price available.
[00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:44.739]  Dr. Group helped develop our other products.
[00:43:44.739 --> 00:43:46.360]  Oxy-Powder.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.881]  I saw this in a major Hollywood star's home.
[00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:53.382]  Didn't know what it was six, seven years ago.
[00:43:53.382 --> 00:43:54.643]  He kept pushing me to take it.
[00:43:56.594 --> 00:44:04.061]  And I don't want to get too technical here, but everybody around the office said, man, your stomach sure got smaller, even though it already lost a lot of weight.
[00:44:04.061 --> 00:44:06.243]  And I said, yeah, it's the oxy powder.
[00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:16.412]  It's time-release oxygen in the intestines, and it's not like the herbs that are painful and all the rest of it, or chitosan that scrapes the walls of your guts.
[00:44:16.412 --> 00:44:18.233]  This stuff just flushes it out painlessly.
[00:44:19.094 --> 00:44:24.755]  And John Wayne, you know, when he did his autopsy, reportedly had something like 45 pounds of undigested meat in him.
[00:44:24.755 --> 00:44:28.116]  I don't want to get technical here, but that's what's going on.
[00:44:28.116 --> 00:44:35.358]  And I saw Rob Dew this morning, and he said, man, he goes, I lost 12 pounds the last month on Oxy-Powder.
[00:44:35.358 --> 00:44:36.338]  And he's in good shape.
[00:44:36.338 --> 00:44:39.699]  We go tubing all the time, his kids, my kids, his wife, my family.
[00:44:39.699 --> 00:44:40.499]  And, you know, he's muscular.
[00:44:40.499 --> 00:44:42.880]  He has a little bit of potbelly.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.500]  A little one.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.320]  Tiny.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:44.760]  It's gone.
[00:44:46.667 --> 00:44:49.110]  Because there wasn't fat there, his stomach stuck out.
[00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.632]  It's gone.
[00:44:50.632 --> 00:44:52.394]  And I said, man, we gotta get you to do a testimonial.
[00:44:52.394 --> 00:44:57.279]  He goes, well, I'm getting ready to do the nightly news tonight, you know, six hours, you're gonna be hosting it.
[00:44:57.279 --> 00:45:00.262]  I said, come on, you're coming in studio.
[00:45:00.262 --> 00:45:05.789]  And so he's here to tell what happened, but OxyPowder, InfoWarsLife.com, you will just try it.
[00:45:07.412 --> 00:45:11.655]  I know you'll become a repeat customer because this is so revolutionary.
[00:45:11.655 --> 00:45:15.637]  And, you know, major Hollywood stars have come out and endorsed it before as well.
[00:45:15.637 --> 00:45:18.338]  And I just rolled my eyes because, man, I don't... I was like, oxygen?
[00:45:18.338 --> 00:45:22.521]  Until I understood it was time release, and I tried it, and it is life-changing.
[00:45:22.521 --> 00:45:27.664]  Rob Dube, in your own words, repeat to me what you said this morning and what OxyPowder did for you.
[00:45:27.904 --> 00:45:30.087]  Well, I'll go into a little more detail.
[00:45:30.087 --> 00:45:35.213]  Back in September, I decided I was going to take it.
[00:45:35.213 --> 00:45:38.997]  And I've been hovering between 220 and 215.
[00:45:38.997 --> 00:45:40.039]  Couldn't get any lower than that.
[00:45:40.039 --> 00:45:40.519]  You're a big guy.
[00:45:40.519 --> 00:45:42.041]  What are you, about 6'3"?
[00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:42.622]  6'3", yeah.
[00:45:42.622 --> 00:45:43.883]  And in college, I was about 185, 190.
[00:45:45.485 --> 00:45:49.186]  And I was playing basketball and doing all that stuff, and I was really in shape.
[00:45:49.186 --> 00:45:53.267]  So I had zero body fat, you know, could hike, could do anything.
[00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:55.628]  Just a lot of snowboarding.
[00:45:55.628 --> 00:45:59.169]  But anyway, over the years, having kids, you slow down a little bit.
[00:45:59.169 --> 00:46:00.550]  So I was up to 220.
[00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:06.431]  I think the most I got to was 230 at one point, and I started to develop, you know, like a double chin.
[00:46:06.431 --> 00:46:07.712]  A bullfrog chin like mine.
[00:46:07.712 --> 00:46:12.253]  Yeah, and one of my friends noticed it, and he's an older guy, he's like 50, and he calls me Funky.
[00:46:12.253 --> 00:46:14.734]  He goes, Funky, you're getting a little big there.
[00:46:15.114 --> 00:46:17.776]  And I hadn't really realized it, and I looked in the mirror, and I'm like, oh my God.
[00:46:17.776 --> 00:46:23.520]  So I've been trying to watch what I eat, taking different things, but I was still like at 215.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.063]  And when we started selling Oxy-Powder, I'm like, you know what, I'm going to give it a try.
[00:46:28.063 --> 00:46:31.606]  And I started off, I did five pills the first night, and nothing happened.
[00:46:31.606 --> 00:46:34.208]  And it says on there, you've got to find your dose.
[00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:35.449]  So the next night, I did seven.
[00:46:36.189 --> 00:46:41.351]  I woke up the next morning and basically you're going to be visiting the bathroom, but it's not uncontrollable.
[00:46:41.351 --> 00:46:44.033]  You're not going to, you know, whatever.
[00:46:44.033 --> 00:46:46.234]  You're not going to mess yourself anywhere.
[00:46:46.234 --> 00:46:53.037]  But it really does, what I think it does is it goes in there and like liquefies the stuff that's inside your intestines and then it just flows out pretty much.
[00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:56.378]  Not to get too graphic, but I did that for six days once I found it.
[00:46:56.378 --> 00:46:58.479]  And that stuff's rotting in there and that's what gives you cancer.
[00:46:58.479 --> 00:46:58.959]  Exactly.
[00:46:58.959 --> 00:47:00.180]  It's diverticulum.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.321]  And it gets rid of, it hurts your immune system, it does all kinds of stuff.
[00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:07.602]  It just, it keeps your digestive system from working properly, all that stuff in there.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:15.005]  So I did it for, took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that, and after that I was down to 202.
[00:47:15.005 --> 00:47:17.306]  And how fast did you lose 12 pounds?
[00:47:17.306 --> 00:47:19.327]  It was in six, seven days.
[00:47:19.787 --> 00:47:20.668]  Literally six, seven days.
[00:47:20.668 --> 00:47:22.709]  You had 12 pounds of filth.
[00:47:22.709 --> 00:47:23.290]  Gone.
[00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:24.330]  Yeah, and I was amazed.
[00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.012]  I did that right before I went to the beach.
[00:47:26.012 --> 00:47:28.353]  See, I'm glad I have you to say the story so I don't have to.
[00:47:28.353 --> 00:47:30.395]  Can you imagine the trolls getting close to me talking about it?
[00:47:30.395 --> 00:47:31.516]  Oh yeah, totally.
[00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:34.498]  But, you know, we went to the beach in early October and
[00:47:35.879 --> 00:47:37.821]  I look, my wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:40.244]  And I'm like, I know, I don't, I guess it's this Oxy powder.
[00:47:40.244 --> 00:47:41.526]  I've been trying to get her to take it.
[00:47:41.526 --> 00:47:42.727]  She's like, well, I don't know.
[00:47:42.727 --> 00:47:43.868]  I said, no, you're going to take it.
[00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:48.093]  So you did all this stuff and it got some of the weight down, but not the rest of the way.
[00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:53.199]  Well, I mean, for me, it's all a synergy, but I wish I'd have taken it years ago when they were henpecking me to take it.
[00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:59.243]  Yeah, I mean, literally, 12 pounds melted off in about a week, I'd say a week, seven days.
[00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.805]  And I've been able to keep it off, too.
[00:48:01.805 --> 00:48:04.948]  I measured myself last night, actually, and I'm like, well, let's see what I'm at.
[00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:05.288]  202.
[00:48:05.288 --> 00:48:06.949]  How often do you take Doxaparil?
[00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:11.993]  I haven't taken it since that one week time, but I'm going to take it probably after Thanksgiving.
[00:48:11.993 --> 00:48:14.154]  So I think every three months I'm just going to do it.
[00:48:14.154 --> 00:48:16.156]  So how many pills made you lose 12 pounds?
[00:48:16.796 --> 00:48:20.419]  Well, so you did 7 for 6 days.
[00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:21.019]  And 5.
[00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:22.580]  And then 5 the first day.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.883]  So, 7 times 5 is 35, plus 5, about 40 pills.
[00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:28.925]  So it's not even a quarter of the bottle, really.
[00:48:28.925 --> 00:48:29.806]  How many pills are in it?
[00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:30.206]  It's 120.
[00:48:30.206 --> 00:48:30.866]  Yeah.
[00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:34.629]  So literally, like, one bottle, if, you know, I don't take it every day.
[00:48:34.629 --> 00:48:36.991]  I did it intensely.
[00:48:36.991 --> 00:48:38.592]  And you really have to stick to it.
[00:48:38.592 --> 00:48:41.694]  And by the third or fourth day, you're like, I don't know if I want to keep doing this.
[00:48:41.694 --> 00:48:45.577]  If you just get through it, it's not bad at all, considering the weight I lost.
[00:48:45.697 --> 00:48:50.498]  I mean, I could never lose the weight doing any other way, you know, that quickly.
[00:48:50.498 --> 00:48:54.899]  Well, this is the final thing Hollywood stars do to lose that final amount of weight.
[00:48:54.899 --> 00:49:05.962]  Yeah, if you're going to, if you've got a wedding or something coming up, I'd say... And groups in here in the office, like months ago, going, look, see this star, she did it, and look at this, Alex Jones, I'm telling you, it's the best thing I got!
[00:49:05.962 --> 00:49:07.462]  You need to sell it!
[00:49:07.462 --> 00:49:08.622]  It definitely works.
[00:49:08.622 --> 00:49:10.563]  And, you know, I'm also doing the X2, and
[00:49:12.443 --> 00:49:23.655]  What's the other little DNA force but I mean the main thing that I saw the biggest fastest improvement was oxy powder and I'm I'm totally amazed with it now after Thanksgiving I'm going to do another round.
[00:49:23.655 --> 00:49:32.484]  Well we got to get my shirt off soon because I have total I was like 35 pounds someone come back I've now lost over 50 pounds and I'm gonna go down to below 200.
[00:49:32.944 --> 00:49:33.124]  I don't
[00:49:54.454 --> 00:49:59.060]  We can go out, research, bring people the most cutting-edge products, and then fund the operation with it.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.563]  It's a win-win-win, and then all we get is rave reviews.
[00:50:01.563 --> 00:50:03.225]  We never get negative reviews!
[00:50:03.225 --> 00:50:04.206]  We don't screen the calls!
[00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:13.277]  It's joke-level good that we can just bring people the very best stuff at very affordable prices, fund our operation, and then they love us!
[00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:14.098]  Yeah.
[00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:17.300]  I mean, what an old-fashioned idea to bring people quality.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.021]  Right.
[00:50:18.021 --> 00:50:21.364]  And then they help us, we help them, and everybody's lovey-dove.
[00:50:21.364 --> 00:50:22.865]  At a good price, too.
[00:50:22.865 --> 00:50:26.849]  You know, what would you pay to lose 12 pounds in a week?
[00:50:26.849 --> 00:50:27.890]  How much would you pay for that?
[00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:29.151]  That's what you gotta ask yourself.
[00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:32.534]  And then, with this, you still have, I still have three-quarters of the bottle left.
[00:50:33.328 --> 00:50:35.149]  So I've got another few sessions ready.
[00:50:35.149 --> 00:50:36.869]  I think you've got a third, I mean two-thirds left.
[00:50:36.869 --> 00:50:38.150]  Yeah, two-thirds left.
[00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.831]  So... Yeah, see, that's what I do.
[00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:41.811]  I do it for a couple days and then go, ehhh.
[00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:42.692]  I lose a couple pounds.
[00:50:42.692 --> 00:50:43.512]  You gotta just keep planning.
[00:50:43.512 --> 00:50:44.192]  I know, I gotta do it.
[00:50:44.192 --> 00:50:44.712]  You gotta do it.
[00:50:44.712 --> 00:50:48.914]  You gotta get that full six days in and really just go through the system.
[00:50:48.914 --> 00:50:50.775]  It says it on the back, where to start.
[00:50:50.775 --> 00:50:51.995]  OxyPowder.
[00:50:51.995 --> 00:50:53.196]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:53.196 --> 00:50:54.956]  And next time, dude, we'll just have a cam on.
[00:50:59.718 --> 00:51:00.219]  Haha, look at that!
[00:51:00.219 --> 00:51:02.921]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:51:02.921 --> 00:51:07.244]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:51:07.244 --> 00:51:08.645]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:51:08.645 --> 00:51:11.306]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:51:11.306 --> 00:51:14.309]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:16.670]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.572]  So stop paying for silver solutions.

[00:51:59.442 --> 00:52:02.183]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[00:52:02.183 --> 00:52:02.963]  No joke!
[00:52:02.963 --> 00:52:06.905]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor and if House Bill H.R.
[00:52:07.545 --> 00:52:09.007]  53-44 becomes law.
[00:52:09.007 --> 00:52:12.751]  You can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.

[00:52:55.222 --> 00:52:56.823]  The future of talk radio.
[00:52:56.823 --> 00:52:58.184]  Now at your fingertips.
[00:52:58.624 --> 00:53:02.608]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:53:02.608 --> 00:53:08.113]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:53:08.113 --> 00:53:10.516]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:17.610]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.713]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:53:19.713 --> 00:53:23.018]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:53:23.018 --> 00:53:24.300]  Children left with no homes.
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.082]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:53:26.082 --> 00:53:28.947]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:53:29.127 --> 00:53:29.527]  I think so.
[00:54:06.921 --> 00:54:09.465]  Look at your young men fighting.
[00:54:09.465 --> 00:54:13.011]  Look at your women crying.
[00:54:13.011 --> 00:54:15.455]  Look at your young men dying.
[00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:53.676]  If it's true the administration is hinting that after the midterms elections they might delay or stop outright millions of deportations, then it is possible that those who are maybe on the lam here or running out here could be prevented from being deported here.
[00:54:54.236 --> 00:54:54.636]  Right?
[00:54:54.636 --> 00:54:56.038]  Correct.
[00:54:56.038 --> 00:55:06.285]  And that is the larger issue that the President has already put out, that they have ordered all these green cards and work permits for post-election.
[00:55:06.285 --> 00:55:16.113]  10 plus million, 20 plus million of these green cards to be able to issue to all these people when he's already announced his executive action.
[00:55:16.113 --> 00:55:22.678]  So I've called on Congress, please stop this President from unilaterally taking action.
[00:55:22.678 --> 00:55:23.359]  Powers that he...
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.963]  I don't know why it would be in anyone's interest, though, Sheriff, trying to give the benefit of the doubt.
[00:55:28.963 --> 00:55:38.729]  If you know someone is a dangerous criminal or has anything from a burglary to manslaughter on his or her rap sheet, why it would be in our interest to keep them here anyway?
[00:55:38.729 --> 00:55:41.331]  Why would we do that?
[00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:45.854]  Well, Obama said these were the worst of the worst, that even he wanted to deport.
[00:55:45.854 --> 00:55:47.375]  Yeah, let's stop right there.
[00:55:47.375 --> 00:55:50.818]  That's Sheriff Babba, who we've had on the broadcast before.
[00:55:52.363 --> 00:55:53.923]  He's a really good guy.
[00:55:53.923 --> 00:55:57.884]  They are releasing aggravated felons.
[00:55:57.884 --> 00:56:01.605]  Rapists, arsonists, armed robbers.
[00:56:01.605 --> 00:56:09.907]  And if sheriffs call to have them picked up or even put in the database, the Democratic Party shows up and protests and flips out.
[00:56:09.907 --> 00:56:13.427]  That's like they have illegals going and protesting Obama that he's not doing enough.
[00:56:13.427 --> 00:56:15.868]  He's gutted the border, the Border Patrol gives him
[00:56:17.233 --> 00:56:18.894]  Vouchers to go anywhere they want.
[00:56:18.894 --> 00:56:23.298]  They've had high-level Border Patrol go on the news and say, we complete the smuggling process.
[00:56:23.298 --> 00:56:24.499]  That's not enough.
[00:56:24.499 --> 00:56:26.361]  See, it's all about being over the top.
[00:56:28.413 --> 00:56:30.615]  And so people say, why is this happening?
[00:56:30.615 --> 00:56:32.558]  People say, why is this going on?
[00:56:32.558 --> 00:56:35.060]  People say, why would they do something like this?
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:39.805]  Because they are absolute total criminals taking the country down.
[00:56:39.805 --> 00:56:44.070]  We're being conquered into a North American Union corporate governance.
[00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:49.396]  The private Federal Reserve is owned by the private European megabanks on record.
[00:56:51.075 --> 00:57:02.759]  And it wants to bankrupt this country and bring in a giant third-world population to checkmate anything that's left of Americana ideas.
[00:57:02.759 --> 00:57:04.699]  This is the end, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:04.699 --> 00:57:07.140]  You'll have to leave the United States.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.940]  They're always going to raise taxes.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.461]  They're going to take your guns.
[00:57:10.461 --> 00:57:12.482]  They're going to say your kids belong to them.
[00:57:12.482 --> 00:57:14.442]  They're going to have national conscription.
[00:57:14.442 --> 00:57:17.043]  We are going to be a giant cesshole.
[00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:20.257]  Where anything goes.
[00:57:20.257 --> 00:57:21.538]  They will take your bank accounts.
[00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:22.259]  They already do it.
[00:57:22.259 --> 00:57:23.480]  No judge, no jury.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.061]  They will take your kids.
[00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:28.103]  You understand the checks and balances are about to be gone.
[00:57:28.103 --> 00:57:35.289]  Televisions are being sold everywhere that listen to everything you do and upload to the government and they tell you in the terms of service.
[00:57:35.289 --> 00:57:37.191]  Watch what you say.
[00:57:37.191 --> 00:57:39.553]  You understand?
[00:57:39.553 --> 00:57:40.794]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:57:41.687 --> 00:57:43.689]  You're in 2014.
[00:57:43.689 --> 00:57:47.051]  It's more like 2040 with the technology the globalists have.
[00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:48.372]  This is all planned.
[00:57:48.372 --> 00:57:52.616]  And the cops and the military, on average, are going, this is total lawlessness.
[00:57:52.616 --> 00:57:59.121]  Even if you want to have open borders to people, you can't have the president just do it by executive fiat.
[00:57:59.121 --> 00:58:00.822]  Do you understand the magnitude?
[00:58:00.822 --> 00:58:10.550]  We're going to go to break and go to Vlad, Kevin, Robert, John, Reverend Bolt, and many others that are patiently holding today.
[00:58:12.113 --> 00:58:33.231]  But don't worry, the Justice Department that ran Fast and Furious, a false flag on the Second Amendment, and it persecutes people with the IRS, and tries to engage in election fraud everywhere, and persecutes anybody trying to give money to the Tea Party, they've got investigators out, so they can make up some stories about people trying to block the poor, dear, illegal aliens and others.
[00:58:33.231 --> 00:58:38.155]  Justice Department dispatches poll monitors for Election Day, second hour, coming up.
[00:58:40.461 --> 00:58:43.727]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.071 --> 00:58:51.332]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:51.332 --> 00:58:56.295]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:56.295 --> 00:58:58.976]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:58.976 --> 00:59:06.020]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.002]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:09.002 --> 00:59:11.983]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:11.983 --> 00:59:13.984]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:13.984 --> 00:59:16.806]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:16.906 --> 00:59:22.633]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:22.633 --> 00:59:26.137]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:26.137 --> 00:59:29.241]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:07.206]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.206 --> 01:00:08.967]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.967 --> 01:00:10.728]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.728 --> 01:00:12.309]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.869]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:18.052]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.052 --> 01:00:22.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:31.916]  It's election 2014, a major political realignment, or business as usual.
[01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:34.417]  What will lame duck Obama do in the new year?
[01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:36.159]  Executive orders on the second amendment.
[01:00:36.159 --> 01:00:37.920]  Executive orders shutting down energy.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.223]  Executive orders handing out 60 million green cards they now admit they've printed.
[01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:44.123]  60 million.
[01:00:44.123 --> 01:00:46.165]  That's from Senator Sessions.
[01:00:46.165 --> 01:00:47.225]  60 million.
[01:00:47.225 --> 01:00:51.228]  And all the leaks over the last decade he's put out have turned out to be accurate.
[01:00:52.745 --> 01:00:54.487]  Sixty million.
[01:00:54.487 --> 01:00:57.229]  More than three Central American countries.
[01:00:57.229 --> 01:01:01.913]  Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
[01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:04.155]  That's a bold move.
[01:01:04.155 --> 01:01:08.898]  And then they get to vote right away, and they got bills in Illinois to make it legal.
[01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:12.061]  This is hardcore conquering America.
[01:01:12.061 --> 01:01:12.682]  Vlad.
[01:01:12.682 --> 01:01:14.903]  Vlad's a cool name.
[01:01:14.903 --> 01:01:16.064]  Vlad in Washington.
[01:01:16.064 --> 01:01:17.806]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:21.274]  Hello Alex, I'm here in Washington.
[01:01:21.274 --> 01:01:24.496]  I just have a basic point about the current elections.
[01:01:24.496 --> 01:01:34.543]  For example, everyone has to vote for senators, for the presidential race, but back in the day when I moved here from Russia, only citizens couldn't vote.
[01:01:34.543 --> 01:01:39.145]  I couldn't vote, so I had to wait until I became a United States citizen until I was eligible to receive a ballot.
[01:01:39.145 --> 01:01:45.409]  Yeah, now the Democrats just give you somebody that's off the, you know, that's still in the voter roll but hasn't voted in 10 years, and you show up and just vote.
[01:01:45.409 --> 01:01:46.410]  That's the way it is.
[01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.433]  Yeah, that would piss me off if someone used my name to go vote for some Democrat.
[01:01:50.433 --> 01:01:52.254]  I'm not going to be voting Democrat.
[01:01:52.254 --> 01:01:53.955]  Well, that's because you're being racist.
[01:01:53.955 --> 01:01:55.596]  I mean, I think it's okay for her.
[01:01:55.596 --> 01:01:59.058]  A lot of people use the voter rolls for identity fraud, too.
[01:01:59.058 --> 01:02:01.480]  So you should let people steal your identity, sir.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.420]  No, no.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.721]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.342]  Listen, you didn't build your identity.
[01:02:05.342 --> 01:02:06.743]  Your parents didn't have you.
[01:02:06.743 --> 01:02:08.164]  Your name's not Vlad.
[01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:10.686]  You didn't even build yourself.
[01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:13.348]  When you suck air into your lungs, government did that.
[01:02:14.161 --> 01:02:15.282]  You understand that, sir?
[01:02:15.282 --> 01:02:17.844]  Do you understand government hung the moon?
[01:02:17.844 --> 01:02:21.427]  Government made your great-granddaddy meet your great-grandma.
[01:02:21.427 --> 01:02:23.569]  Government did everything.
[01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:24.090]  Well, they did.
[01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:27.032]  Hold on, government did this?
[01:02:27.032 --> 01:02:28.253]  I'm breathing air.
[01:02:28.253 --> 01:02:30.916]  I'm gonna drink some tea.
[01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:31.596]  Government did it.
[01:02:31.596 --> 01:02:33.198]  No, no, no.
[01:02:33.198 --> 01:02:34.519]  See, that's what they want you to believe.
[01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:37.882]  That's a load of horse garbage.
[01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:41.145]  You don't want to believe anything the government says these days because all they do is lie to you.
[01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:42.563]  No, they don't.
[01:02:42.563 --> 01:02:43.504]  They never lie.
[01:02:43.504 --> 01:02:44.645]  Oh, yes they do.
[01:02:44.645 --> 01:02:45.985]  Oh, racism.
[01:02:45.985 --> 01:02:47.586]  Racism.
[01:02:47.586 --> 01:02:48.607]  Oh, no.
[01:02:48.607 --> 01:02:54.030]  Look, I say 2 plus 2 equals 5, and you're a homophobe, sexist, racist if you don't agree.
[01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:55.911]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:02:55.911 --> 01:02:56.692]  I'm trendy.
[01:02:56.692 --> 01:02:57.792]  I control reality.
[01:02:57.792 --> 01:02:59.393]  You bow down and do what I say.
[01:02:59.393 --> 01:03:00.274]  Is that clear?
[01:03:00.274 --> 01:03:05.277]  We'll take your identity, and we'll vote with it, and then we'll take your tax money, and we'll take your property.
[01:03:05.277 --> 01:03:06.337]  You belong to us.
[01:03:06.337 --> 01:03:07.438]  That's called freedom.
[01:03:07.438 --> 01:03:09.259]  It's not called high-tech slavery.
[01:03:09.259 --> 01:03:10.220]  Is that clear, Vlad?
[01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:13.271]  That's called hardcore slavery right there.
[01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:13.951]  How dare you?
[01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:15.891]  They can call me a sexist.
[01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:17.212]  They can call me a bigot.
[01:03:17.212 --> 01:03:18.352]  I don't care what they call me.
[01:03:18.352 --> 01:03:22.233]  The reality is only United States citizens can vote in the United States.
[01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:24.434]  I came from Russia.
[01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:25.334]  I couldn't vote.
[01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.555]  Obama says there's no election fraud.
[01:03:28.516 --> 01:03:29.437]  Obama's a liar.
[01:03:29.437 --> 01:03:32.079]  Obama should be impeached and tried for treason.
[01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:32.299]  No.
[01:03:32.299 --> 01:03:32.959]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:03:32.959 --> 01:03:33.800]  He's heavenly.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.241]  I don't care what they say.
[01:03:35.241 --> 01:03:35.861]  Oh man.
[01:03:35.861 --> 01:03:38.723]  Did you hear Jamie Foxx?
[01:03:38.723 --> 01:03:41.886]  Jamie Foxx just said the word, Barack Obama!
[01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:45.208]  He says the name, he's having an orgasm.
[01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:48.530]  We're all giving honor to God.
[01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:50.832]  And our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama!
[01:03:50.832 --> 01:03:51.252]  Barack Obama!
[01:03:57.819 --> 01:04:00.680]  I love it when he says it!
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.680]  It's like just the proof!
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.940]  Hey, turn your guns in!
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.481]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:05.501]  Give me all your money!
[01:04:05.501 --> 01:04:06.561]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:06.561 --> 01:04:10.822]  I'm gonna put satellite trackers in your car and tax you by the mile!
[01:04:10.822 --> 01:04:11.683]  Well, I don't want to do that!
[01:04:11.683 --> 01:04:13.163]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:14.403]  I'm gonna open the borders up!
[01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:16.144]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.884]  I'm gonna fund Al-Qaeda!
[01:04:17.884 --> 01:04:19.504]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:19.504 --> 01:04:20.605]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:20.605 --> 01:04:22.245]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:22.245 --> 01:04:24.166]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:25.206]  Barack Obama!
[01:04:27.759 --> 01:04:29.761]  They want you to be under them.
[01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:35.805]  It's kind of like those people that have the mindset of conquering others without having anything to give for someone else.
[01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:48.135]  It's like when we had the Stalinist revolution in Russia, when we had Lenin, when we had all of the... Hey, Stalin had an awesome mustache, and I'm gonna come back to you, alright?
[01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:51.757]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have removed Alex Jones from the show.
[01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:54.439]  I am the new government-approved broadcaster.
[01:04:54.439 --> 01:04:54.980]  My name's Phil.
[01:04:59.904 --> 01:05:10.467]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:16.908]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:16.908 --> 01:05:19.249]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.349]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:29.211]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:05:29.716 --> 01:05:33.377]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:33.377 --> 01:05:37.658]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.658 --> 01:05:39.418]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:39.418 --> 01:05:44.760]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.280]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.421]  But for how long?

[01:05:50.641 --> 01:05:55.062]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:55.062 --> 01:05:56.923]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:05:56.923 --> 01:05:57.883]  Just won't quit.
[01:06:00.273 --> 01:06:01.753]  In the near future.
[01:06:01.753 --> 01:06:05.434]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:05.434 --> 01:06:06.274]  Security alert.
[01:06:06.274 --> 01:06:07.495]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.495 --> 01:06:09.495]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:09.495 --> 01:06:10.375]  Analysis.
[01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:13.196]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[01:06:13.196 --> 01:06:18.077]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:18.077 --> 01:06:20.658]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.658 --> 01:06:23.498]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.498 --> 01:06:26.759]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:26.759 --> 01:06:29.060]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:29.780]  These people are a
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:39.102]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:39.102 --> 01:06:41.703]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:41.703 --> 01:06:43.383]  You can feel it.
[01:06:58.922 --> 01:07:00.243]  The experts are clear.
[01:07:00.243 --> 01:07:07.369]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:13.635]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:13.635 --> 01:07:17.218]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:07:17.358 --> 01:07:21.580]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:26.883]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:07:26.883 --> 01:07:27.904]  Not our iodine.
[01:07:27.904 --> 01:07:34.247]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:07:56.541 --> 01:08:03.246]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.657 --> 01:08:25.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:08:25.139 --> 01:08:30.864]  We were just talking to Vlad, who moved here and is a citizen of the U.S., but originally from Russia.
[01:08:30.864 --> 01:08:36.408]  He was making parallels between tyranny and freedom and saying, you know, why can't illegals vote?
[01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.629]  He had to wait to be a citizen.
[01:08:37.629 --> 01:08:41.533]  We're going to go to Kevin Robert, Christy, Reverend Bolt, and others.
[01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:45.196]  We'll also walk through the latest election news as it unfolds.
[01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:56.644]  And the Justice Department is dispatching monitors to 18 states to look for racism and people preventing minorities from voting.
[01:08:56.644 --> 01:09:01.468]  No, what's going on, ladies and gentlemen, is they're letting illegals vote without IDs.
[01:09:02.532 --> 01:09:06.094]  With the voter rolls, and it's a total takeover.
[01:09:06.094 --> 01:09:09.577]  And that's what's happening, and they've been caught red-handed, and it's outrageous.
[01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:13.419]  Law enforcement defines elections as referendum.
[01:09:13.419 --> 01:09:16.942]  Obama's amnesty means tidal wave of illegal immigration.
[01:09:16.942 --> 01:09:20.744]  They've printed 60 million green cards for after the election.
[01:09:20.744 --> 01:09:22.365]  They've already opened the borders.
[01:09:22.365 --> 01:09:24.627]  They're just going to certify it all.
[01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:32.112]  The government's got the organization facilities at thousands of apartment complexes organizing it, preparing from all over the world.
[01:09:32.892 --> 01:09:35.173]  Used to, we're always talking about Latin America because that's the majority.
[01:09:35.173 --> 01:09:41.796]  Oh no, Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Africa.
[01:09:41.796 --> 01:09:46.298]  It's just a flood.
[01:09:46.298 --> 01:09:56.543]  An absolute flood and then huge government trough or mammaries, milkies, with taxpayer money
[01:09:59.952 --> 01:10:03.034]  It's just total robbery, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:10:03.034 --> 01:10:17.786]  The problem with pure democracy is, in Greece they had pure democracy in some of the city-states, and they would have one bucket of black rocks and one bucket of white rocks, and then the establishment higher class order was allowed to vote.
[01:10:17.786 --> 01:10:18.847]  You could be voted into their club.
[01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:20.288]  That was the first democracy.
[01:10:20.288 --> 01:10:21.289]  It was more like an oligarchy.
[01:10:22.626 --> 01:10:27.369]  And they would call them up and they would say, yeah, we think this philosopher has been rude to us.
[01:10:27.369 --> 01:10:31.312]  We're going to have a vote on throwing him off the cliff.
[01:10:31.312 --> 01:10:34.073]  Or sometimes we're going to make him drink Hemlock.
[01:10:34.073 --> 01:10:35.114]  These are real cases.
[01:10:35.114 --> 01:10:35.755]  And then they would vote.
[01:10:35.755 --> 01:10:38.556]  They'd say, yep, there are 10 more Black Rocks.
[01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:44.398]  Then there are white rocks, so we do not vote to kill you.
[01:10:44.398 --> 01:10:47.000]  Oh, there are seven more white rocks than there are black rocks.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.101]  Those are a yes vote.
[01:10:48.101 --> 01:10:49.962]  We're going to throw you off the cliff.
[01:10:49.962 --> 01:10:57.006]  Guards, march him up to that thousand foot parapet and throw him off.
[01:10:57.006 --> 01:11:00.308]  For corrupting the youth, criticizing the government.
[01:11:00.308 --> 01:11:06.152]  Most of the philosophers that got killed, a large percentage of them did get killed, the thinkers, was for criticizing the state.
[01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:11.511]  And they would either have you drink Hemlock or throw you off of a cliff.
[01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:13.833]  And they would vote on that.
[01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:15.054]  And that's pure democracy.
[01:11:15.054 --> 01:11:16.595]  That's why it's the howl of democracy.
[01:11:16.595 --> 01:11:26.742]  That's why in a republic you have the law, the Bill of Rights, that cannot be countermanded by a jury, a grand jury, a judge, a president, a mob, anybody.
[01:11:26.742 --> 01:11:30.125]  And now, there it is, the trial of Socrates.
[01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:34.228]  Socrates was ultimately sentenced to death by drinking Hemlock-based liquid
[01:11:38.206 --> 01:11:39.887]  Then they had a vote.
[01:11:39.887 --> 01:11:41.247]  And they gave him the hemlock.
[01:11:41.247 --> 01:11:44.148]  And then he drank.
[01:11:44.148 --> 01:11:47.189]  Out, out, brief candle, to quote Shakespeare.
[01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:49.249]  Okay, let's go back to Vlad and then Jim.
[01:11:49.249 --> 01:11:54.111]  Vlad, finish your point about the parallels of living in Russia as a young person and then being here in the United States.
[01:11:55.336 --> 01:11:59.458]  Well, my whole point was the fact that people need to be citizens to vote.
[01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:04.962]  And right now the Democrats are talking about voter ID laws, where they shouldn't have voter ID laws, where anyone should be able to just walk up and vote.
[01:12:04.962 --> 01:12:06.703]  Well, what about my vote?
[01:12:06.703 --> 01:12:10.585]  What if someone came and took my identity and went out and voted without an ID?
[01:12:10.585 --> 01:12:17.269]  The reality is every single person that does vote, they do need to provide physical government identification via passport or driver's license.
[01:12:17.919 --> 01:12:18.139]  I'm good.
[01:12:37.085 --> 01:12:49.552]  And the reality is that if we don't turn around and remove all these Democrats or Republicans or even Libertarians that break the law and reject the Constitution, we're all going to end up like Stalin in Soviet Russia.
[01:12:49.552 --> 01:13:03.099]  Well sure, and it's also about a divide and conquer, the old Tower of Babel story, where there were so many nationalities from so many countries that moved there, none of them could communicate anymore and basically things fell apart.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.483]  It's one thing if you're in India, and it's 95% Indians.
[01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.444]  It's a culture, you can adopt it, you know what it is.
[01:13:09.444 --> 01:13:12.126]  If you're in China, 97% are Chinese.
[01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:14.929]  You can adopt it, you can learn to navigate it.
[01:13:14.929 --> 01:13:17.411]  Or Mexico, you go down there, 97% are Mexican.
[01:13:17.411 --> 01:13:19.212]  You can get it, get into it.
[01:13:19.212 --> 01:13:20.613]  I mean, I like other cultures, but...
[01:13:21.354 --> 01:13:40.998]  When it becomes a Star Wars space bar, like Walgreens was last night, I mean I walked in this Walgreens and it was like dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
[01:13:49.438 --> 01:13:54.520]  It's just bizarre, and I see that everywhere now.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.541]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:13:55.541 --> 01:14:01.524]  I go down to the hike and bike trail, and used to, you'd see a few homeless people, but the cops have run them off.
[01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:13.349]  I'll be two miles down a hike and bike trail where there's nobody, and I'll come up on Guatemalan's fishing with a tin can and yarn, with a grandmother sewing, with a fire going, and five kids.
[01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:15.670]  Grandma, dad, mom, five kids.
[01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.351]  And you kind of, they're quaint, they're cute.
[01:14:18.686 --> 01:14:20.788]  I've been to Guatemala.
[01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:21.509]  I knew the hats.
[01:14:21.509 --> 01:14:22.470]  I knew they were Mayans.
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:23.711]  I said, Guatemala?
[01:14:23.711 --> 01:14:24.792]  They're like, see?
[01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:26.374]  They're all scared.
[01:14:26.374 --> 01:14:27.795]  So, in a way, it's true.
[01:14:27.795 --> 01:14:29.877]  A lot of the immigrants don't know how to work the system.
[01:14:29.877 --> 01:14:33.361]  They're living on the hike and bike trail.
[01:14:33.361 --> 01:14:38.066]  And fishing.
[01:14:38.066 --> 01:14:40.769]  And then I went, and I even, I've got video on my iPhone of them.
[01:14:42.193 --> 01:14:43.895]  But I didn't want to go up and just stick the camera in her face.
[01:14:43.895 --> 01:14:44.715]  I felt sorry for him.
[01:14:44.715 --> 01:14:51.601]  But see, the globalists are using the fact, hey, it's not my fault Guatemala is collapsing and is a literal hellhole.
[01:14:51.601 --> 01:14:54.524]  Is a hellhole.
[01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:59.128]  And they're being used as a weapon.
[01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:04.433]  But when you've got Guatemalans camping on the hike and bike trail in Austin, Texas, you got a problem.
[01:15:09.164 --> 01:15:13.466]  I mean, it's not just driving by Home Depot now that I'll see 50 to 100 illegals.
[01:15:13.466 --> 01:15:14.847]  At least they're out looking for work.
[01:15:14.847 --> 01:15:15.968]  There used to be 20, now it's 100.
[01:15:15.968 --> 01:15:24.833]  I just see it at gas stations and everywhere, and there's huge buses everywhere now that you didn't see five years ago just disgorging people from Central America.
[01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:27.554]  Folks, I'm here to tell you, I don't think it's 30 or 40 million.
[01:15:27.554 --> 01:15:30.996]  I think it might be like 100 million or something.
[01:15:30.996 --> 01:15:35.479]  Because I'm told all over the country it's like this, just buses pull up and just offload people.
[01:15:36.977 --> 01:15:40.860]  And the Border Patrol gives them the money, and it's just a staging ground.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:46.463]  And we broke that three months ago, four months ago, before even the New York Times had to admit it a month later.
[01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:47.464]  The Border Patrol said, come down here.
[01:15:47.464 --> 01:15:48.124]  Do you want to see something?
[01:15:48.124 --> 01:15:49.125]  Come here at night.
[01:15:49.125 --> 01:15:52.567]  There were all the scores of buses driving in, and people get off.
[01:15:52.567 --> 01:15:54.628]  The Border Patrol gives them the voucher.
[01:15:54.628 --> 01:15:55.149]  They get on.
[01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:58.471]  The Border Patrol stands there with their mouth hanging open, and the buses just drive in.
[01:15:59.482 --> 01:16:02.083]  To Democratic Party facilities, major churches.
[01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:13.370]  Then they deploy them from there, they sign them up for welfare, sign them up for free housing, and then those become command bases to then harbor the next group and complete the smuggling process.
[01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:16.932]  This is a communist takeover by offshore banks that want to put us under communism.
[01:16:16.932 --> 01:16:17.732]  They're exempt.
[01:16:17.732 --> 01:16:19.393]  This is the end of America.
[01:16:19.393 --> 01:16:26.557]  Just so you know, it's the equivalent of taking a straight razor right across somebody's neck and slicing both carotids, both jugulars, just
[01:16:27.585 --> 01:16:27.745]  Yes.
[01:16:45.424 --> 01:16:58.855]  Have like 1.5 kids so you know we are a dead country so we gotta have replacement race but not not a hundred million I mean it's just I could I could walk out of here and walk a hundred yards they'll just be illegals walking around I mean it's just everywhere I don't care where you are you can be in the middle of nowhere
[01:17:00.319 --> 01:17:02.020]  And the illegals are just running around.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:08.202]  And again, it's all being done while citizens are held to the highest nitpicking standard.
[01:17:08.202 --> 01:17:10.322]  You got a taillight out, your insurance is out.
[01:17:10.322 --> 01:17:11.283]  I'm bankrupt, man.
[01:17:11.283 --> 01:17:12.283]  I can't pay for it anymore.
[01:17:12.283 --> 01:17:12.703]  Get out of the car.
[01:17:12.703 --> 01:17:13.643]  You're going to jail.
[01:17:13.643 --> 01:17:16.144]  CPS those kids.
[01:17:16.144 --> 01:17:17.225]  Because you're a citizen.
[01:17:17.225 --> 01:17:18.165]  You're a mark.
[01:17:18.165 --> 01:17:18.965]  You're a chump.
[01:17:18.965 --> 01:17:20.406]  You're to be ridden down.
[01:17:20.406 --> 01:17:21.426]  You're the enemy.
[01:17:21.426 --> 01:17:23.827]  You're known as the right whale, the right one to hunt.
[01:17:24.977 --> 01:17:27.357]  Print me a Wikipedia and write well, please.
[01:17:27.357 --> 01:17:28.938]  Reverend Bolt, thanks for holding.
[01:17:28.938 --> 01:17:32.198]  Then we'll go to Robert, Kristen, Will, and others.
[01:17:32.198 --> 01:17:32.558]  Go ahead.
[01:17:32.558 --> 01:17:36.599]  Yes, good afternoon.
[01:17:36.599 --> 01:17:40.280]  I'm calling from the great Republic of Texas.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.980]  Well, welcome, terrorist.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:47.821]  You know full well it's FEMA Region 6, racist, and the unelected FEMA governor is in command.
[01:17:47.821 --> 01:17:50.382]  You submit to the governor, don't you?
[01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:52.187]  Oh, yes.
[01:17:52.187 --> 01:17:54.809]  Do you even know who the governor of FEMA Region 6 is?
[01:17:54.809 --> 01:17:58.090]  Uh, actually, no.
[01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:58.991]  Why don't you look it up?
[01:17:58.991 --> 01:18:00.071]  Is it Obama?
[01:18:00.071 --> 01:18:04.213]  No, it's a Fort Hood general, but you will learn to submit soon enough.
[01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:11.097]  The shadow governor of FEMA Region 9 is Herr Napolitano, your ruler.
[01:18:11.097 --> 01:18:12.558]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:18:12.558 --> 01:18:13.578]  Yes.
[01:18:13.578 --> 01:18:15.179]  The, um, two things.
[01:18:15.179 --> 01:18:21.282]  One, several months back, I started taking your, uh, mason iodine and your super meal.
[01:18:23.223 --> 01:18:28.010]  And prior to this, I was barely walking, having to use a walker.
[01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:32.477]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:18:32.477 --> 01:18:35.381]  Actually move around, enjoy life.
[01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:37.024]  Needless to say, it does wonders.
[01:18:38.373 --> 01:18:39.193]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:18:39.193 --> 01:18:42.415]  You know, we don't ask the callers to call these testimonials.
[01:18:42.415 --> 01:18:44.616]  In fact, it's almost becoming an issue, but thank you.
[01:18:44.616 --> 01:18:50.099]  They really are... If you have an iodine deficiency and you don't get enough of it, you'll end up dying of a complication.
[01:18:50.099 --> 01:18:51.300]  That's just a fact.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.220]  But they don't tell you that.
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:19:00.885]  They don't tell you that they put estrogen mimickers in basically everything, print paper, everything, to where males are suppressed.
[01:19:00.885 --> 01:19:05.648]  So you go on something like Supermail, that just makes you what you're supposed to feel like.
[01:19:05.648 --> 01:19:06.508]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:07.849]  Oh, that's okay.
[01:19:08.484 --> 01:19:10.065]  Works for me.
[01:19:10.065 --> 01:19:13.166]  Yeah, I went up, did my voting this morning.
[01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:23.811]  It is funny because I've talked with a lot of people, college-age students, in the past couple days, and I'd say better than 80% that I've spoken with.
[01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:27.132]  They're all so complacent and dumbed down.
[01:19:27.132 --> 01:19:30.154]  There's the old adage, you can't pick stupid.
[01:19:30.154 --> 01:19:33.455]  And just because they're getting an education doesn't mean they're intelligent.
[01:19:33.455 --> 01:19:35.276]  You're right, I've got to be honest.
[01:19:35.276 --> 01:19:36.797]  Young people working in
[01:19:37.978 --> 01:19:40.579]  A shop are super smart.
[01:19:40.579 --> 01:19:43.100]  And then I go down to UT and we do these interviews.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:46.701]  We can't find people that can talk.
[01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:48.582]  I mean, they they aren't humans anymore.
[01:19:48.582 --> 01:19:52.703]  They just look at their iPads and just go trendy, trendy, trendy.
[01:19:52.703 --> 01:19:53.984]  They aren't even people anymore.
[01:19:53.984 --> 01:19:54.684]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:54.684 --> 01:19:55.764]  Go ahead.
[01:19:55.764 --> 01:19:56.464]  Exactly.
[01:19:56.464 --> 01:19:58.685]  And with them, they're not voting.
[01:19:58.685 --> 01:19:59.065]  Oh, we don't.
[01:19:59.065 --> 01:20:00.426]  We're not going to vote.
[01:20:00.426 --> 01:20:01.426]  Why not?
[01:20:01.426 --> 01:20:01.726]  Why?
[01:20:01.726 --> 01:20:03.707]  Our vote don't count.
[01:20:03.707 --> 01:20:06.668]  Well, naturally, if you don't vote, it don't count.
[01:20:07.642 --> 01:20:09.803]  Well, voting's only one part of an overall plan.
[01:20:09.803 --> 01:20:11.584]  You're always in a fight for freedom.
[01:20:11.584 --> 01:20:12.384]  It's not perfect.
[01:20:12.384 --> 01:20:14.325]  A lot of people we get on say, don't vote.
[01:20:14.325 --> 01:20:15.365]  I can see their perspective.
[01:20:15.365 --> 01:20:16.266]  Vote with your dollars.
[01:20:16.266 --> 01:20:17.866]  Vote with not complying.
[01:20:17.866 --> 01:20:19.927]  There's a hundred ways to vote.
[01:20:19.927 --> 01:20:20.888]  There's more than a hundred ways.
[01:20:20.888 --> 01:20:22.589]  But voting is a big one.
[01:20:22.589 --> 01:20:27.611]  And, yes, it usually doesn't matter when they own both parties, but that's wearing thin.
[01:20:27.611 --> 01:20:28.751]  It's coming to the end of it.
[01:20:28.751 --> 01:20:30.312]  God bless you, Reverend Bolt.
[01:20:30.312 --> 01:20:31.693]  Let's talk to Robert in Florida.
[01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.293]  We just skipped the network break.
[01:20:33.293 --> 01:20:34.814]  Robert, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:20:36.018 --> 01:20:36.698]  Hello, Alex.
[01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:40.481]  Long time listener and trying to be a caller.
[01:20:40.481 --> 01:20:42.442]  Well, welcome to the airwaves.
[01:20:42.442 --> 01:20:43.022]  Thank you, sir.
[01:20:43.022 --> 01:20:43.682]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:43.682 --> 01:20:46.164]  I've been listening to you for about four or five years now.
[01:20:46.164 --> 01:20:49.165]  I went in and voted today for what good it's worth.
[01:20:49.165 --> 01:20:51.166]  And I live in a little town called Port St.
[01:20:51.166 --> 01:20:55.049]  Lucie, Florida, just on the East Coast, north of West Palm.
[01:20:55.049 --> 01:21:00.912]  And when I went in there, just out of curiosity, now don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with the ID thing.
[01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:08.540]  And I even had my ID out, but when I went in there, I asked them, I said, uh, they said, uh, okay, we need to see your driver's license.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:12.384]  I said, okay, can you show me the Florida law that says, you know, you have to have it.
[01:21:12.384 --> 01:21:18.272]  And he says, well, I don't know the law, but, but the law is, you know, you can't vote here unless you have a photo form of ID.
[01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:20.895]  And he, my guidelines are, and I interrupted him, I said,
[01:21:21.351 --> 01:21:25.152]  Well, your guidelines do not supersede our law.
[01:21:25.152 --> 01:21:25.872]  That's right.
[01:21:25.872 --> 01:21:34.093]  It's important to train everybody that you're going to show me the law and you're going to be specific about it so that these people start learning to actually look at the law.
[01:21:34.093 --> 01:21:35.334]  You're right.
[01:21:35.334 --> 01:21:35.574]  Right.
[01:21:35.574 --> 01:21:42.615]  And then I said, well, if I was a piece of Spanish illegal scum that come over here, would I have to show you ID or anything?
[01:21:42.615 --> 01:21:44.155]  And his jaw kind of dropped.
[01:21:44.155 --> 01:21:48.856]  And the ladies that were sitting there listening to all this, they kind of smiled and said, you know, I agree with you.
[01:21:49.714 --> 01:21:50.895]  And but this doesn't happen here.
[01:21:50.895 --> 01:21:59.542]  He says in this precinct, you have to have an ID and he stepped away and he brought back a paper that had the Florida statute that did say you have to have ID.
[01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:06.407]  But one of the things were if you don't have a photo ID, you have to use a piece of mail, something with your address on a credit card.
[01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:12.823]  So that doesn't really, you know, justify his idea in my book.
[01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:15.043]  If you can use a piece of mail that, you know... Well, that's right.
[01:22:15.043 --> 01:22:18.905]  Florida's like Texas, where you just, they want something.
[01:22:18.905 --> 01:22:24.386]  And that's meant to stop the serial vote fraud, where James O'Keefe could vote 20 times.
[01:22:24.386 --> 01:22:28.088]  He didn't actually vote, but he got to the point of getting the ballot to illustrate it.
[01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:31.789]  And by the way, we have a piece of the interview that Jakari Jackson just did with O'Keefe
[01:22:32.569 --> 01:22:36.133]  Exclusive with all the big election fraud he's breaking.
[01:22:36.133 --> 01:22:39.255]  We have the full interviews tonight during live coverage.
[01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:43.620]  We've got some other interviews we've taped with Greg Palast and others.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:48.484]  That's coming up tonight, 6 to midnight Central, 7 to 1 a.m.
[01:22:48.484 --> 01:22:49.545]  Eastern.
[01:22:49.545 --> 01:22:50.346]  That's 3 to, I guess,
[01:22:53.849 --> 01:22:56.391]  That'd be 9 Pacific.
[01:22:56.391 --> 01:23:05.235]  Infowars.com forward slash show or click on the elections link to find the free video feed that's already up and going right now simulcasting this transmission.
[01:23:05.235 --> 01:23:07.417]  I appreciate your call.
[01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:10.999]  Now I get your point saying that you're mad at people that are here illegally.
[01:23:12.043 --> 01:23:14.724]  Voting to disenfranchise you illegally, calling them scum.
[01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:21.366]  I think if you call someone scum who's voting illegally... If I was down in Mexico, illegally voting in their elections, I think they could call me scum.
[01:23:21.366 --> 01:23:27.389]  But if you mean they're scum because they're Spanish-speaking, I gotta be honest with you.
[01:23:27.389 --> 01:23:35.972]  People that are here legally, that I know from Latin America, are more moral and nicer than Americans.
[01:23:35.972 --> 01:23:37.192]  Just because they're more old-fashioned.
[01:23:37.192 --> 01:23:38.693]  Americans are so incredibly spoiled.
[01:23:41.676 --> 01:23:49.141]  There is a cliche that sold conservatives on having open borders that the illegals will work hard, and they will!
[01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:58.087]  But that culture is being phased out, and they want people that wear 6x underwear that are on welfare to get up here, who can barely get in a bus ride.
[01:23:58.087 --> 01:24:00.409]  They're advertising, want to have a baby?
[01:24:00.409 --> 01:24:02.170]  That's who they want up here.
[01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:02.791]  In my view,
[01:24:06.889 --> 01:24:12.497]  Well, you know, I told the story about, uh, I ran out of gas the other day, and I think the guy said he was from El Salvador, I forget.
[01:24:12.497 --> 01:24:19.467]  Really nice, I'm walking down the ramp, ran out on 290, and he took me to get gas.
[01:24:21.664 --> 01:24:26.546]  And when I came back, the cops were there saying, hey, you can't, this is blocking the exit ramp.
[01:24:26.546 --> 01:24:27.906]  I go, I know, I didn't want to run out here.
[01:24:27.906 --> 01:24:29.827]  It wasn't blocking, I was able to pull it over.
[01:24:29.827 --> 01:24:40.191]  And then the cops basically ended up, because of course the gas can at the place didn't go in the hole right, because it's the type that's sealed, and the cops just pushed the truck down over the hill and down to the gas station.
[01:24:40.191 --> 01:24:42.392]  So they were very nice and did service duty.
[01:24:42.392 --> 01:24:44.893]  See, it's not lowly to do service, it's a high calling.
[01:24:45.697 --> 01:24:47.098]  You know, it's good to help people.
[01:24:47.098 --> 01:24:49.458]  It's good to be a good Samaritan and do your job.
[01:24:49.458 --> 01:24:52.280]  But, I mean, I had a good experience with the police and with the guy.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.460]  And I said, are you here legally?
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.400]  And the guy was like, no.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:02.904]  He didn't speak much English, but he was pulling over to, you know, help me and give me a ride.
[01:25:02.904 --> 01:25:06.165]  Look, I mean, I'll take anybody over the UT students I've seen.
[01:25:06.165 --> 01:25:07.205]  And I'm not trying to be mean.
[01:25:07.205 --> 01:25:09.966]  I don't care if they're Chinese, white, black.
[01:25:09.966 --> 01:25:10.827]  We go interview them.
[01:25:10.827 --> 01:25:13.928]  They are so stupid and can hardly talk.
[01:25:14.804 --> 01:25:18.207]  But they know all the trendy buzzwords.
[01:25:18.207 --> 01:25:21.590]  We go down there and 9 out of 10 sign a petition to ban water.
[01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:26.113]  And they brag, yeah, I'm a chemist, you know, I got a degree from Stanford, yeah.
[01:25:26.113 --> 01:25:35.361]  The guy starts hitting on Leon McAdill on the jogging trail, and he's bragging that he's got a degree in chemistry, and he's saying, yes, I'll sign your petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[01:25:35.361 --> 01:25:38.644]  Dihydrogen monoxide is the scientific name of water, H2O.
[01:25:41.505 --> 01:25:42.927]  Nine out of ten people, we've done it.
[01:25:42.927 --> 01:25:52.598]  You go up and say, you know, it's very bad for the environment, we want to restrict it, we don't want to arrest anybody caught dumping it on the street in the wintertime, just to give them a hint.
[01:25:52.598 --> 01:25:54.280]  Sodium chloride is just, it's incredible.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.622]  It can burn your eyes, burn your skin.
[01:25:56.622 --> 01:25:58.264]  Oh, yeah, I want to ban that.
[01:25:58.264 --> 01:25:59.766]  It's table salt, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:02.529]  And I'm not a chemist!
[01:26:02.529 --> 01:26:05.550]  It's just... What's wrong with these people?
[01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:08.091]  Oh, they know how to run their channel remote, though.
[01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:11.291]  They know how to laugh when I warn them that the TV's listening to every word they say.
[01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:12.111]  On record.
[01:26:12.111 --> 01:26:14.712]  Patented, certified, hooked up.
[01:26:14.712 --> 01:26:16.552]  I'm gonna go back to your calls in a moment.
[01:26:16.552 --> 01:26:27.195]  The first really serious death threats I got were when... In fact, if I told the whole story, people wouldn't believe it.
[01:26:27.195 --> 01:26:27.775]  It's like a novel.
[01:26:30.734 --> 01:26:36.816]  Is that an engineer came to me in the parking lot of Access Television and said, here's the new digital cable box.
[01:26:36.816 --> 01:26:37.996]  It's coming out in a year.
[01:26:37.996 --> 01:26:39.257]  We're integrating them and testing them.
[01:26:39.257 --> 01:26:40.337]  It was a high-level engineer.
[01:26:40.337 --> 01:26:45.699]  Well, it's been so long, I could just say it.
[01:26:45.699 --> 01:26:50.260]  He was the lead engineer at a major cable company in Austin.
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.681]  At the time, there was only one.
[01:26:52.681 --> 01:26:56.142]  And he goes, there's a microphone in it that's voice print.
[01:26:56.142 --> 01:26:58.223]  And this next one's coming out, it's going to have a camera.
[01:26:59.158 --> 01:26:59.458]  I don't know.
[01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:26.032]  They are tracking what everybody's doing in live time, and these are going to roll out everywhere, part of a smart grid, and the NSA has hubs in all the telecoms.
[01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:28.513]  So I already talked to an AT&T guy about this, too.
[01:27:28.513 --> 01:27:37.398]  You notice later was an AT&T person in San Francisco, the head guy, the head engineer over the whole building, went public and said, no, whole floors are NSA.
[01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:47.207]  30 minutes into the transmission, they cut the feed at Time Warner and Master Control, because AXS TV ran through that.
[01:27:47.207 --> 01:27:51.249]  The phone starts ringing and they call me and they go, we're getting major heat.
[01:27:51.249 --> 01:27:56.373]  You need to, we're being threatened by Time Warner that you're giving out proprietary information and they may sue us.
[01:27:56.373 --> 01:28:06.200]  And I said, listen, they, and so I brought in a cable box, we've got to find these videos, they're so epic, and ripped it open on air and showed the microphone and the blueprints.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.922]  This is the type of shows I used to do back then by myself.
[01:28:08.922 --> 01:28:09.603]  Buckley used to help.
[01:28:10.523 --> 01:28:12.086]  When he could.
[01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.548]  And Mike Hanson.
[01:28:13.548 --> 01:28:17.234]  I tore it open on air.
[01:28:17.234 --> 01:28:18.076]  Tore it open on air.
[01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:21.131]  And showed everybody.
[01:28:21.131 --> 01:28:23.152]  And man, the death threat started.
[01:28:23.152 --> 01:28:32.136]  And I get these calls on my unlisted line going, listen Alex, you can have fun and have your show, but let me tell you, you've gone too far, buddy.
[01:28:32.136 --> 01:28:37.458]  You don't talk about that cable box, you little son of a bitch, or you and your family are gonna get it.
[01:28:37.458 --> 01:28:42.601]  And I'm sorry to talk like that, but I mean, serious old men can sound really evil, always real friendly.
[01:28:42.601 --> 01:28:48.804]  Imagine when they call up and go, listen, you little piece of, you got into stuff you're not supposed to be getting into, boy.
[01:28:49.404 --> 01:28:53.745]  And if you know what's good for you, you'll shut your mouth right now!
[01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:59.526]  Same thing when I exposed Dinecore and the child kidnapping rings that were in the news.
[01:28:59.526 --> 01:29:03.007]  Got the same kind of calls and stuff you wouldn't believe.
[01:29:03.007 --> 01:29:05.047]  It was causing incredible hell for my family.
[01:29:05.047 --> 01:29:08.868]  But somebody's got to expose this.
[01:29:08.868 --> 01:29:11.989]  People calling up saying, I just saw you let your dog out in the backyard.
[01:29:11.989 --> 01:29:13.149]  That's a nice little dog.
[01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:15.249]  I mean, the phone rings right as you close the door.
[01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.870]  Yeah, I heard your dad's in the hospital.
[01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:18.090]  Hope he effing dies.
[01:29:21.138 --> 01:29:24.842]  We're gonna cut your head off.
[01:29:24.842 --> 01:29:26.023]  You understand that?
[01:29:26.023 --> 01:29:28.526]  We're gonna cut your effing head off.
[01:29:28.526 --> 01:29:30.428]  See, that's who runs this country.
[01:29:30.428 --> 01:29:33.671]  They ship in the narcotics, they run the kids, they run it all.
[01:29:33.671 --> 01:29:40.318]  And they count on us being weak-minded while they got cable boxes listening to everything we do for 15, 16, 17 years.
[01:29:44.989 --> 01:29:46.111]  Did it stop 9-11?
[01:29:46.111 --> 01:29:46.653]  No.
[01:29:46.653 --> 01:29:47.514]  They run Al Qaeda.
[01:29:47.514 --> 01:29:49.258]  It's not our government.
[01:29:49.258 --> 01:29:50.460]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.166]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.166 --> 01:29:55.871]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.083 --> 01:30:09.749]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[01:30:09.749 --> 01:30:19.674]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:19.674 --> 01:30:22.596]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:22.816 --> 01:30:30.041]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:34.724]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:30:34.724 --> 01:30:39.707]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:30:39.707 --> 01:30:45.391]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:50.735]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:30:50.735 --> 01:30:52.656]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com
[01:30:52.956 --> 01:30:56.197]  Or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[01:30:56.197 --> 01:30:58.418]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:58.418 --> 01:31:10.743]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:31:10.743 --> 01:31:16.825]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:31:17.185 --> 01:31:19.527]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:31:19.527 --> 01:31:22.630]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:31:22.630 --> 01:31:29.957]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:31:29.957 --> 01:31:33.620]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:37.564]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:37.884 --> 01:31:39.665]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:39.665 --> 01:31:47.530]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:48.670]  But for how long?
[01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:55.314]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:31:55.314 --> 01:31:58.136]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:31:59.619 --> 01:32:01.519]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:32:01.519 --> 01:32:06.060]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:10.521]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:32:10.521 --> 01:32:17.823]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:32:17.823 --> 01:32:26.905]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:27.105 --> 01:32:32.647]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:40.251]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:32:40.251 --> 01:32:42.832]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:32:42.832 --> 01:32:47.914]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.

[01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:56.178]  DNA Force from Infowarslife.
[01:32:56.178 --> 01:32:57.619]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:32:57.619 --> 01:33:03.162]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.476 --> 01:33:29.596]  I do want to run through a lot of your calls and I'm customarily hogging up the time telling endless stories here on air.
[01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:33.491]  Before I go any further, it is time for my daily regimen.
[01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:37.112]  I do this at least twice a day, sometimes three times a day.
[01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:48.637]  For DNA force, that's known to repair telomeres and lengthen them and activate your mitochondria, which is the engine of the cell and detox the cell.
[01:33:48.637 --> 01:33:52.459]  Find out details and all the neutral medical facts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:53.809 --> 01:33:56.011]  It's been a few weeks since I took any oxy powder.
[01:33:56.011 --> 01:34:04.679]  I've decided, hearing Rob Dew's story earlier about losing 12 pounds of stuff in his gut in seven days.
[01:34:04.679 --> 01:34:09.343]  He lost 12 pounds a month or so ago.
[01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:10.664]  He told that story last hour.
[01:34:12.884 --> 01:34:16.405]  So I'm going to take some Oxy Powder right now as well.
[01:34:16.405 --> 01:34:17.945]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:34:17.945 --> 01:34:22.026]  I'm going to have it with my Aromante tea.
[01:34:22.026 --> 01:34:28.428]  Oh, and yeah, let me put a little bit of a Super Male Vitality in there.
[01:34:28.428 --> 01:34:29.308]  I need to get some new bottles.
[01:34:29.308 --> 01:34:30.008]  These are getting low.
[01:34:30.008 --> 01:34:35.469]  A little bit of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:42.411]  Since it's pure iodine, it doesn't taste bad like the other stuff that's out there that's bound with the alcohol and isn't real nascent iodine.
[01:34:44.688 --> 01:34:59.279]  And then Bon Appetit, gonna take my Oxy-Powder, my DNA Force, before I eat lunch.
[01:34:59.279 --> 01:35:03.903]  And I just take Oxy-Powder for a day or two every couple weeks.
[01:35:03.903 --> 01:35:05.084]  This is basic maintenance.
[01:35:09.764 --> 01:35:16.546]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:16.546 --> 01:35:22.847]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:36.210]  Just like the promo code WATER.
[01:35:37.543 --> 01:35:38.143]  That's right.
[01:35:59.532 --> 01:36:00.313]  I don't think so.
[01:36:14.981 --> 01:36:23.204]  Store.com or madein1776.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:23.204 --> 01:36:29.026]  We love to answer your questions when you call and take your order or tell you about any of the discounts or other specials that are running.
[01:36:29.026 --> 01:36:35.989]  Give us a call 888-253-3139 and we thank you for calling and thank you for all of your support out there.
[01:36:35.989 --> 01:36:42.031]  This is a one-off, one-of-a-kind organization and it's a house you built out there, the listeners.
[01:36:42.031 --> 01:36:42.772]  So God bless you.
[01:36:42.772 --> 01:36:43.312]  We salute you.
[01:36:43.712 --> 01:36:48.014]  Now, I'm going to shut up like I did with Steve Quayle last week for the last half of the hour.
[01:36:48.014 --> 01:36:48.754]  I did a pretty good job.
[01:36:48.754 --> 01:36:51.775]  I probably talked a minute or two in the next 25 minutes.
[01:36:51.775 --> 01:36:57.537]  I'm going to just go to your calls, hear your comment, and briefly try to answer any questions you have so we can get to a lot of callers.
[01:36:57.537 --> 01:36:59.498]  Christine in Minnesota, thanks for calling.
[01:36:59.498 --> 01:37:00.038]  You're on the air.
[01:37:01.929 --> 01:37:15.919]  Hi, I wanted to mention that I believe I'm kind of of the mindset of Jesse Ventura when he comes to the voting situation about not going for the right-left paradigm like you've talked about for years.
[01:37:15.919 --> 01:37:19.621]  I really think that it's about us having a voice.
[01:37:19.621 --> 01:37:26.766]  Even if we don't believe in the system and the voting, if you go there and you vote by your conscience,
[01:37:27.304 --> 01:37:38.330]  Like Joe Skelton mentioned, I think a lot of us do not, or in society, don't think with our conscience the way we should and vote what we really believe in.
[01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:52.018]  It's all about going, well, Republican, Democrat, whatever, but it's also about still showing them that we have a voice, even though I myself am discouraged with the system, the voting system altogether.
[01:37:53.462 --> 01:37:54.583]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:37:54.583 --> 01:37:55.984]  Look, it's a mix of things.
[01:37:55.984 --> 01:37:59.566]  People say either don't vote or only vote third party.
[01:37:59.566 --> 01:38:08.512]  Look, if you know there's a really good Tea Party Libertarian candidate in the Republican Party that the system's after, who has a chance at winning because you get behind him, vote for him.
[01:38:08.512 --> 01:38:10.833]  Or if you've got a chance to run for school board.
[01:38:10.833 --> 01:38:16.017]  Even if you don't win, you'll educate people and inject real issues.
[01:38:16.017 --> 01:38:17.598]  I mean, I tried to get a radio job.
[01:38:18.737 --> 01:38:24.381]  For two years, before I got one, and then I went, wait, why am I watching AXS Television?
[01:38:24.381 --> 01:38:29.905]  I'll just go show what I can do on AXS Television, use that to learn how to film make.
[01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:33.327]  I just wanted to tell people what was going on, so I'd use any venue I could.
[01:38:33.327 --> 01:38:43.495]  And that's why they've had so many trade publications say that I have pioneered so much of how to build a true independent media operation that can challenge the establishment.
[01:38:43.495 --> 01:38:46.377]  Because necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:47.710]  And so
[01:39:06.869 --> 01:39:09.091]  It's about scaring the globalist off.
[01:39:09.091 --> 01:39:14.415]  It's about not letting them officially legalize the 50 million, 100 million, whatever it is.
[01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:15.996]  I mean, I'm not joking, folks.
[01:39:15.996 --> 01:39:18.919]  It's wall-to-wall illegals everywhere, from everywhere.
[01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.961]  Just, I mean, you name it, just they're here.
[01:39:20.961 --> 01:39:22.702]  And it's all third world countries.
[01:39:22.702 --> 01:39:24.644]  Because people from other countries don't want to come here.
[01:39:24.644 --> 01:39:26.305]  We're like a third world country now.
[01:39:26.305 --> 01:39:27.146]  That's another thing.
[01:39:27.146 --> 01:39:30.448]  Being a third world country runs off all the good people.
[01:39:30.448 --> 01:39:34.632]  From Africa and Asia and Eastern Europe and Europe and Latin America.
[01:39:36.002 --> 01:39:40.966]  One nice part about Austin and San Antonio is we got all the rich Latin Americans, so that's good for business.
[01:39:40.966 --> 01:39:42.166]  They collapsed their countries.
[01:39:42.166 --> 01:39:44.068]  They all ran up here.
[01:39:44.068 --> 01:39:44.748]  They got money.
[01:39:44.748 --> 01:39:46.309]  They're nice.
[01:39:46.309 --> 01:39:50.432]  I care less if they got brown skin and speak Spanish.
[01:39:50.432 --> 01:39:51.873]  They got money and they're nice.
[01:39:51.873 --> 01:39:54.275]  I like them.
[01:39:54.275 --> 01:40:03.642]  But let me tell you, I don't want a bunch of poor people from a collapsed Eastern Europe or Asia or Latin America, Guatemala, who will go right into the system and go right along with communism.
[01:40:04.983 --> 01:40:05.824]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:05.824 --> 01:40:07.065]  Great points.
[01:40:07.065 --> 01:40:08.646]  Tim in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:40:08.646 --> 01:40:09.947]  Welcome.
[01:40:09.947 --> 01:40:10.808]  Alex Jones!
[01:40:10.808 --> 01:40:11.549]  Thanks, man.
[01:40:11.549 --> 01:40:16.233]  Hey, man, I really like that comic release you were doing earlier with the Barack Obama!
[01:40:16.233 --> 01:40:17.454]  Barack Obama!
[01:40:17.454 --> 01:40:19.155]  Here, let's play it one more time.
[01:40:19.155 --> 01:40:19.635]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:40:19.635 --> 01:40:21.317]  Jamie Foxx one more time.
[01:40:21.317 --> 01:40:24.580]  I mean, when he just says the name, it's like he's said
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.163]  Shazam, or Open Sesame, or Super Casual Fragilistic Expialidocious.
[01:40:31.163 --> 01:40:51.171]  I mean, he's speaking the power word that God used in his words to open up and create reality, that this is the fire of Prometheus, the ultimate elixir of truth, the name of Zeus writ large, Barack Obama!
[01:40:54.554 --> 01:40:56.115]  Oh, just to play the whole thing.
[01:40:56.115 --> 01:40:57.715]  Barack Obama!
[01:40:57.715 --> 01:40:59.276]  Oh, yeah!
[01:40:59.276 --> 01:41:02.977]  First of all, give an honor to God.
[01:41:02.977 --> 01:41:06.179]  And our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama!
[01:41:06.179 --> 01:41:07.479]  Yeah!
[01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:10.520]  Give it to him!
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:11.761]  Barack Obama!
[01:41:11.761 --> 01:41:12.761]  Yeah!
[01:41:12.761 --> 01:41:13.862]  Y'all stand up, everybody!
[01:41:17.694 --> 01:41:17.914]  Yeah.
[01:41:17.914 --> 01:41:21.235]  Oh, former Nixon insider, Tea Party, destroying Republican Party.
[01:41:21.235 --> 01:41:22.716]  That's right.
[01:41:22.716 --> 01:41:27.758]  We need to be nicer and tell a billion people to come here and vote to take our guns.
[01:41:27.758 --> 01:41:34.220]  I love Rand Paul, but he's got advisors telling him, we need to be more hip and with the young people and let foreigners like us.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.801]  Well, it's because it's already checkmate.
[01:41:35.801 --> 01:41:39.642]  You bring in unlimited foreigners, Rand Paul, they're going to vote for the commies.
[01:41:39.642 --> 01:41:42.203]  They ain't voting for you.
[01:41:42.203 --> 01:41:43.804]  It's checkmate.
[01:41:43.804 --> 01:41:44.404]  Don't you get it?
[01:41:47.924 --> 01:41:54.694]  I was talking about the, you know, the voting thing, you know, and up here in Oregon they just send us the ballots in the mail.
[01:41:54.694 --> 01:41:57.758]  So we don't, there is no polling stations or any of that kind of stuff.
[01:41:57.758 --> 01:41:59.521]  I mean, I don't know why they don't do that everywhere.
[01:42:01.155 --> 01:42:04.777]  Well, see, Oregon's already, you know, kind of taken over with the socialist game.
[01:42:04.777 --> 01:42:06.818]  But what's funny is that then they do some good things.
[01:42:06.818 --> 01:42:14.863]  There's some sensible things that liberals do, like GMO labeling and, you know, animal welfare, common sense stuff.
[01:42:14.863 --> 01:42:21.127]  So they get all the compassionate, well-meaning people working for their team, not knowing they're helping bring down the drawbridge.
[01:42:22.381 --> 01:42:23.822]  Good to hear from you, Jim.
[01:42:23.822 --> 01:42:27.085]  Will in Virginia, what's your take on Election 2014?
[01:42:27.085 --> 01:42:28.826]  A major realignment?
[01:42:28.826 --> 01:42:30.307]  Or just more business as usual?
[01:42:30.307 --> 01:42:41.275]  And what do you expect the Lord and Savior, Obama, Lord Obama, Lord Ebola, what are you expecting to do after he's a lame duck and he's got that pardon power?
[01:42:41.275 --> 01:42:43.317]  Well, I have two points if I could, Alex.
[01:42:43.317 --> 01:42:45.719]  I'm a naturopathic doctor in Virginia.
[01:42:46.457 --> 01:42:47.277]  I don't know.
[01:43:09.508 --> 01:43:22.352]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually repair the thyroid and not only protect it, we're seeing young kids reverse their homosexuality over a course of six to nine months, taking higher doses than you guys recommend.
[01:43:22.352 --> 01:43:25.032]  So it's great stuff.
[01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:38.256]  And my recommendation, or my second point about the election is, I almost see it as just this big scam because at the end of the day, if you look at who owns the election,
[01:43:38.866 --> 01:43:42.971]  Well, look, I never show ID for hardly anything except when it's your bank account or
[01:43:56.104 --> 01:43:58.585]  You know, you're getting on an international flight.
[01:43:58.585 --> 01:44:01.365]  You've got to prove who you are because of identity theft.
[01:44:01.365 --> 01:44:11.308]  And they are purposely making you show an ID for stuff you don't need to, but then not showing an ID for voting when it's your identity you supposedly registered.
[01:44:11.308 --> 01:44:14.668]  You've got to have these controls in there or there will be fraud.
[01:44:14.668 --> 01:44:18.909]  And then you've got the electronic voting machine fraud and flipping votes to Democrats.
[01:44:18.909 --> 01:44:21.370]  Clearly Democrats are in charge of the machine right now.
[01:44:22.330 --> 01:44:28.373]  And it could be like folks thought Harry Truman was going to lose and he ended up winning.
[01:44:28.373 --> 01:44:31.315]  I don't know if they're going to give the Senate to the Republicans.
[01:44:31.315 --> 01:44:37.578]  Now, it may be such a big landslide they can't stop them, but we could see some surprises.
[01:44:37.578 --> 01:44:40.639]  We'll find out by tomorrow morning, won't we?
[01:44:40.639 --> 01:44:42.320]  Thank you so much, Will.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.902]  Look at past stuff that's going on in this country.
[01:44:45.902 --> 01:44:47.023]  There's no telling what's going to happen.
[01:44:47.895 --> 01:44:51.640]  We'll have live coverage six o'clock central to midnight tonight.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.543]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:44:56.325 --> 01:45:00.768]  Click on the election button, right-hand corner of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:45:00.768 --> 01:45:03.430]  It'll take you to the live, free video feed that'll be up there.
[01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:09.514]  And we're going to have an audio feed linked up there as well tonight for folks that don't have high-level bandwidth.
[01:45:09.514 --> 01:45:23.183]  We will direct over the radio show and preempt the radio show refeed, if we're able to do that, and put out the audio feed of that as well tonight, 6 to midnight, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:24.504]  We'll cover the election.
[01:45:24.504 --> 01:45:26.285]  Jake in Arkansas, thanks for calling.
[01:45:27.606 --> 01:45:28.726]  Hi, Alex.
[01:45:28.726 --> 01:45:30.808]  My name is Jacob Holloway.
[01:45:30.808 --> 01:45:35.750]  I'm the Libertarian Party candidate for Arkansas Secretary of State.
[01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:37.091]  Oh, great!
[01:45:37.091 --> 01:45:40.973]  And what I'd like to talk about is something very serious.
[01:45:40.973 --> 01:45:46.597]  Something I was actually attacked for during my debate is the electronic voting.
[01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:52.360]  And I was actually against the electronic voting question in our debate.
[01:45:53.306 --> 01:45:59.949]  And I was attacked for this because I was asked, you know, how could we all vote on paper ballot?
[01:45:59.949 --> 01:46:10.394]  And today, just today in the news, I discovered, and now it's out in the media here in Arkansas, that the electronic voting machines in Arkansas are switching votes.
[01:46:10.394 --> 01:46:14.075]  Well, election fraud in Arkansas is like election fraud in Chicago.
[01:46:14.075 --> 01:46:17.837]  It's ubiquitous like water and wet.
[01:46:17.837 --> 01:46:19.058]  It is just famous.
[01:46:20.198 --> 01:46:39.205]  And people don't know, paper ballots are easier, and a lot of industrialized countries use them, because you tabulate them at the precinct, that is done in front of everyone, it's posted on the wall, and then all those numbers are then for the larger sector put together, and then there's total transparency.
[01:46:39.205 --> 01:46:42.946]  The only way you'll get somewhat of a fair election
[01:46:45.097 --> 01:46:48.698]  Because elections have always been a competition of fraud, to a certain extent.
[01:46:48.698 --> 01:46:56.119]  Is to have paper ballots counted at the precinct level, tabulated then at the county level, and publicly available info.
[01:46:56.119 --> 01:46:57.699]  Don't you agree?
[01:46:57.699 --> 01:47:00.160]  And that's exactly what I said during the debate.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.280]  That's what exactly I said to the press.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.660]  I was attacked for that.
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:04.820]  Well, of course.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:09.481]  I mean, if you said that you needed water in the Sahara Desert, the average trendy would call you a racist.
[01:47:09.481 --> 01:47:10.881]  Exactly.
[01:47:10.881 --> 01:47:14.302]  But I did make some good points, and I did point out we're not keeping data.
[01:47:15.012 --> 01:47:21.578]  On the votes that are changing, and we're not keeping track of the machines that are dysfunctioning.
[01:47:21.578 --> 01:47:25.221]  They're actually still using the machines that are dysfunctioning today.
[01:47:25.221 --> 01:47:32.487]  The Arkansas Secretary of State Board of Elections actually came out and said that they knew that the machines were faulty before they used them.
[01:47:32.487 --> 01:47:33.368]  Oh yeah, that's the tactic.
[01:47:33.368 --> 01:47:34.589]  They come out and admit it's all a fraud.
[01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:36.030]  See, here's what happens.
[01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:41.414]  You run for dog catcher, you run for city council, you run for Secretary of State, you run for Attorney General.
[01:47:41.414 --> 01:47:43.036]  Even if you don't win, and sometimes you will,
[01:47:44.497 --> 01:47:51.343]  Especially in this climate, you're there getting in the middle of their fake event, bombing it with truth.
[01:47:51.343 --> 01:47:54.466]  And so that's why everybody should just start running for office.
[01:47:54.466 --> 01:47:59.811]  Even if you don't like the system and don't believe in voting, go do it to crash their gates, to get in the fight.
[01:47:59.811 --> 01:48:01.352]  It's fun!
[01:48:01.352 --> 01:48:02.273]  Thank you so much, Jake.
[01:48:02.273 --> 01:48:03.274]  Tell us about your website.
[01:48:03.274 --> 01:48:05.115]  How do folks find out about you?
[01:48:05.115 --> 01:48:06.036]  You can look me up.
[01:48:06.036 --> 01:48:07.938]  I'm on Google.
[01:48:07.938 --> 01:48:11.401]  You just look up Jacob Holloway for Secretary of State.
[01:48:12.143 --> 01:48:13.584]  In Arkansas and you can find out.
[01:48:13.584 --> 01:48:14.605]  Very exciting.
[01:48:14.605 --> 01:48:15.526]  Very exciting.
[01:48:15.526 --> 01:48:18.148]  Maybe you can run against Family Malik up there.
[01:48:18.148 --> 01:48:19.409]  Shelby in Tennessee.
[01:48:19.409 --> 01:48:20.030]  You're on the air.
[01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:23.092]  Hello Alex.
[01:48:23.092 --> 01:48:24.333]  Hey brother.
[01:48:24.333 --> 01:48:25.374]  Enjoy your show man.
[01:48:25.374 --> 01:48:26.215]  Subscribe to you.
[01:48:26.215 --> 01:48:29.317]  But I listen to you on the podcast while I'm out and about every day.
[01:48:29.317 --> 01:48:31.499]  Well thank you brother.
[01:48:31.499 --> 01:48:34.661]  I just want to say something about the election going on.
[01:48:34.661 --> 01:48:35.522]  I went to vote.
[01:48:35.522 --> 01:48:40.886]  I have to vote early because I'm not at home you know very well very often.
[01:48:40.886 --> 01:48:41.387]  But anyway.
[01:48:42.399 --> 01:48:54.389]  Um, and I went and I voted in the early primaries back in the spring here, and the lady looked at me, of course, I told her who I was and everything, and she looked on the roll.
[01:48:54.389 --> 01:48:56.711]  She says, well, I can't find you.
[01:48:56.711 --> 01:48:58.112]  And I said, what do you mean you can't find me?
[01:48:58.112 --> 01:49:01.835]  I just voted back in the spring, and here's my license.
[01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.257]  And she says, oh, oh, we won't need that.
[01:49:04.257 --> 01:49:05.698]  Let me just keep looking for you.
[01:49:05.698 --> 01:49:06.879]  And I gave her my name again.
[01:49:09.204 --> 01:49:14.367]  And she called one of the other ladies over and she says, uh, I can't find him on the road.
[01:49:14.367 --> 01:49:17.709]  And I said, look, I just voted last spring.
[01:49:17.709 --> 01:49:18.910]  Here's my license.
[01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:20.931]  Oh, we won't need that.
[01:49:20.931 --> 01:49:28.476]  Well, then she says to me in the middle of this crowd, she says, what is your social security number?
[01:49:28.476 --> 01:49:31.457]  And I said, look, ma'am, I'm not going to tell you that.
[01:49:31.457 --> 01:49:32.878]  I'll write it down for you.
[01:49:32.878 --> 01:49:37.141]  I'll show you my card, whatever, but I'm not going to tell you what my social security number is.
[01:49:38.288 --> 01:49:41.551]  She got so freaking mad at me, Alex.
[01:49:41.551 --> 01:49:44.993]  She says, look mister, do you want to vote or do you not want to vote?
[01:49:44.993 --> 01:49:45.994]  We can have it either way.
[01:49:45.994 --> 01:49:49.957]  And I was like, what is going on?
[01:49:49.957 --> 01:50:00.465]  And one of the other older gentlemen that was there, he says, uh, he told her, he said, just look at your social security number, it all lines up, and you look at everybody's social security number.
[01:50:00.465 --> 01:50:05.149]  So she looks at her, and she says, well, there you are, right there.
[01:50:05.891 --> 01:50:07.052]  Well, there you are.
[01:50:07.052 --> 01:50:09.753]  Here's everything you need to go vote.
[01:50:09.753 --> 01:50:13.836]  And I was like, my gosh, what is going on here?
[01:50:13.836 --> 01:50:14.616]  You know?
[01:50:14.616 --> 01:50:18.959]  What happened is they didn't give it to you until you showed that.
[01:50:18.959 --> 01:50:21.900]  So they might have been in their own way trying to stop fraud.
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.003]  But I don't know the Tennessee law, but I don't think they make you show a social security number there, do they?
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.261]  Well, that was my point.
[01:50:28.261 --> 01:50:35.643]  That's when I told her, I said, I'm not going to blurt out my social security number just because you asked me for it.
[01:50:35.643 --> 01:50:40.345]  And the other fellow that was there, he said, show her your card or whatever.
[01:50:40.345 --> 01:50:42.266]  So I had my driver's license.
[01:50:42.788 --> 01:50:44.069]  We don't want your driver's license.
[01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:46.371]  Just give us the, give us the, so I did.
[01:50:46.371 --> 01:50:46.991]  Got it.
[01:50:46.991 --> 01:50:48.232]  Done my voting.
[01:50:48.232 --> 01:50:49.533]  I'm out the door.
[01:50:49.533 --> 01:50:53.355]  So I'm like, you know, this stuff here, they're talking about voter fraud.
[01:50:53.355 --> 01:50:54.396]  My gosh.
[01:50:54.396 --> 01:50:58.539]  If you gotta go through that because you're a legal citizen, I've been voting since I was 18, Alex.
[01:50:58.539 --> 01:50:59.260]  I hear you, brother.
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:50:59.800]  We're gonna come back.

[01:51:14.844 --> 01:51:17.164]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:30.253 --> 01:51:31.034]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:31.034 --> 01:51:32.855]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:32.855 --> 01:51:34.496]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.496 --> 01:51:37.318]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:37.318 --> 01:51:39.620]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:44.124]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:44.124 --> 01:51:48.067]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:53.911]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:51:59.235 --> 01:52:00.496]  Another major health threat.
[01:52:00.496 --> 01:52:05.458]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:52:05.458 --> 01:52:08.139]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:52:08.139 --> 01:52:15.182]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:52:15.182 --> 01:52:18.143]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:52:18.143 --> 01:52:21.125]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:52:21.125 --> 01:52:23.146]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:52:23.146 --> 01:52:26.007]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:52:26.067 --> 01:52:31.790]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:35.313]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:52:35.313 --> 01:52:38.394]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:52:38.394 --> 01:52:42.517]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:52:42.517 --> 01:52:43.157]  We're good to go.
[01:52:59.741 --> 01:53:05.105]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[01:53:05.105 --> 01:53:08.967]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[01:53:08.967 --> 01:53:14.111]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[01:53:14.111 --> 01:53:16.012]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[01:53:16.012 --> 01:53:19.495]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[01:53:19.495 --> 01:53:22.357]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[01:53:23.037 --> 01:53:29.025]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[01:53:29.025 --> 01:53:36.034]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[01:53:36.034 --> 01:53:38.417]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[01:53:38.957 --> 01:53:42.919]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[01:53:42.919 --> 01:53:43.840]  Wow!
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.220]  Call 888-988-3325.

[01:53:46.021 --> 01:53:46.501]  That's OneWorld.
[01:53:46.501 --> 01:53:46.941]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:54:07.483 --> 01:54:11.706]  Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving.
[01:54:11.706 --> 01:54:16.629]  Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving.
[01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:18.250]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:54:18.250 --> 01:54:20.091]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:54:20.091 --> 01:54:22.613]  Don't call your kinfolks to give me a talking to.
[01:54:22.613 --> 01:54:26.756]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[01:54:26.756 --> 01:54:28.236]  I'll be gone.
[01:54:28.236 --> 01:54:30.378]  I'll be gone like I said.
[01:54:30.378 --> 01:54:32.019]  Just lay there in your bed.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.965]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[01:54:36.965 --> 01:54:42.212]  Lay there in your bed, keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:54:44.083 --> 01:55:04.951]  That's a little sexist, out of control, homophobic Johnny Cash.
[01:55:04.951 --> 01:55:06.472]  Being sarcastic there.
[01:55:06.472 --> 01:55:11.934]  You want to know why the system's attacking the Tea Party and the Republican leadership's been lined up against it for years?
[01:55:13.177 --> 01:55:16.219]  Story out of Yahoo Finance, linked on Infowars.com.
[01:55:16.219 --> 01:55:20.702]  Former Nixon insider, Tea Party, destroying Republican Party.
[01:55:20.702 --> 01:55:31.349]  The ones that wrote Obamacare with Obama, the ones that funded Al Qaeda, the ones that passed the Patriot Act, the ones that helped the NSA spy on us, the ones that built all the prisons, the ones that... You mean the traitors?
[01:55:31.349 --> 01:55:32.730]  Oh, those.
[01:55:32.730 --> 01:55:38.574]  Aid to Imperial President trashes constitutionalists.
[01:55:38.574 --> 01:55:40.055]  If the polls hold, 2014 should be a
[01:55:42.338 --> 01:55:44.679]  Banner year for Republicans.
[01:55:44.679 --> 01:55:54.445]  But John Huntsman Sr., a self-described lifelong Republican and former special assistant to President Richard Nixon, is looking ahead with concern about the grand old party's 2016 prospects.
[01:55:56.189 --> 01:56:01.210]  The Tea Party has completely captivated and ruined the Republican Party.
[01:56:01.210 --> 01:56:02.911]  Oh, you're scared, aren't you?
[01:56:02.911 --> 01:56:12.473]  Today, and they'll show this in 2016, says Huntsman, author of Barefoot to Billionaire, unless a Jeb Bush comes in or a John Huntsman Jr., the Republicans don't have a prayer.
[01:56:12.473 --> 01:56:17.494]  Unless your son saves us.
[01:56:17.494 --> 01:56:24.616]  How disgusting to have one of these Nixonian slimeballs, one of these country club Republicans,
[01:56:25.765 --> 01:56:27.707]  I mean, boy, was Richard Nixon a racist, too.
[01:56:27.707 --> 01:56:28.427]  This whole crowd.
[01:56:28.427 --> 01:56:36.034]  That's when you got horrible Communist, Socialist Democrats that are racist, and you got all these old racist white people that are helping destroy the country.
[01:56:36.034 --> 01:56:41.398]  I mean, it's just a bunch of scum calling the Tea Party racist when all it wants to do is save the country.
[01:56:41.398 --> 01:56:42.759]  The Republicans have tried to take it over.
[01:56:42.759 --> 01:56:44.701]  They failed.
[01:56:44.701 --> 01:56:50.826]  So now they want to destroy it, but it's the reason the Republicans are popular is people think they might do something, like they might cut taxes.
[01:56:52.008 --> 01:56:53.829]  They might get rid of Obamacare.
[01:56:53.829 --> 01:56:57.110]  And I expect that immediately.
[01:56:57.110 --> 01:57:02.512]  People should be calling Boehner's office right now saying, you don't start repealing this, buddy, 100% of it.
[01:57:02.512 --> 01:57:05.413]  We want you impeached right now, scum!
[01:57:05.413 --> 01:57:07.854]  We need to immediately go after the Republican leadership.
[01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.795]  And that's going to happen.
[01:57:09.795 --> 01:57:11.536]  Because killing this country is a big deal.
[01:57:11.536 --> 01:57:13.037]  And you guys are really doing it!
[01:57:13.037 --> 01:57:13.677]  That's the thing.
[01:57:13.677 --> 01:57:18.579]  You're going to get a fight, boys, because you really are gutting the golden goose, morons.
[01:57:20.077 --> 01:57:21.918]  Because the globalists want to conquer the country.
[01:57:21.918 --> 01:57:23.299]  They're afraid of the free market.
[01:57:23.299 --> 01:57:26.901]  They're afraid of freedom because you might not run everything completely.
[01:57:26.901 --> 01:57:32.104]  It'd be better for the establishment to be rich and powerful and not run everything than run it in the ground.
[01:57:32.104 --> 01:57:35.366]  You people are morons!
[01:57:35.366 --> 01:57:42.510]  You have inherited the power structure that had problems but wasn't totally insane and you are running it in the ground.
[01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:44.151]  You are vandalizing this country.
[01:57:49.275 --> 01:57:50.475]  We got one minute before we go to break.
[01:57:50.475 --> 01:57:52.116]  We'll come back with more calls than Tucker Carlson.
[01:57:52.116 --> 01:57:56.598]  I forgot to play the interview with James O'Keefe, the exclusive.
[01:57:56.598 --> 01:58:03.221]  We'll play that at like 45 after or something with Carlson.
[01:58:03.221 --> 01:58:05.601]  And the whole thing will be on the Nightly News tonight when we do the news.
[01:58:05.601 --> 01:58:06.722]  I'm going to come back and go to break.
[01:58:07.739 --> 01:58:08.279]  We're going to go to break.
[01:58:08.279 --> 01:58:11.783]  I'm going to come back and take your calls without even getting to the James O'Keefe exclusive.
[01:58:11.783 --> 01:58:13.004]  We've got new breaking stuff.
[01:58:13.004 --> 01:58:19.810]  We should just take that five minutes we've got, put it on YouTube and have an article written about it, and then have the whole nightly, that nightly news piece, a powerful interview.
[01:58:19.810 --> 01:58:24.694]  We're going to have election coverage tonight, 6 to midnight central.
[01:58:24.694 --> 01:58:27.136]  That's 5 to 11 p.m.
[01:58:27.136 --> 01:58:28.878]  Mountain.
[01:58:28.878 --> 01:58:31.640]  That's 5 to whenever it is.
[01:58:33.303 --> 01:58:34.584]  Eastern.
[01:58:34.584 --> 01:58:36.005]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:58:42.569 --> 01:58:46.572]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:56.998]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:56.998 --> 01:59:02.140]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:10.863]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:10.863 --> 01:59:13.884]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:13.884 --> 01:59:17.045]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:23.959]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:59:23.959 --> 01:59:27.780]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.040]  Others don't.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.161]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:59:31.161 --> 01:59:32.941]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:32.941 --> 01:59:35.822]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:35.822 --> 01:59:42.463]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:59:45.164 --> 01:59:47.525]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:59:47.525 --> 01:59:48.025]  Others don't.
[01:59:51.901 --> 01:59:54.487]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.902 --> 02:00:10.743]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.743 --> 02:00:12.324]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.324 --> 02:00:13.864]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.864 --> 02:00:18.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.065 --> 02:00:29.348]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.348 --> 02:00:31.389]  Tucker Carlson's coming up in the Daily Caller.
[02:00:33.951 --> 02:00:37.974]  Say what you want about Tucker Carlson, but I've said good things and bad things over the years.
[02:00:37.974 --> 02:00:39.636]  He's an interesting guy.
[02:00:39.636 --> 02:00:40.796]  He's got a great website.
[02:00:40.796 --> 02:00:44.279]  A lot of good libertarian Americana ideas.
[02:00:44.279 --> 02:00:45.340]  A lot of breaking news.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.381]  Drudge loves it, obviously.
[02:00:46.381 --> 02:00:48.943]  It's on there every day.
[02:00:48.943 --> 02:00:52.166]  Damian in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:00:52.166 --> 02:00:52.826]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:52.826 --> 02:00:54.347]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:56.989]  Hi, my name is Damian Stanziano.
[02:00:56.989 --> 02:01:01.373]  I'm the libertarian candidate here in District 41 for Indiana State Senate.
[02:01:02.525 --> 02:01:07.106]  It's been a really tough battle, this whole campaign, trying to be recognized.
[02:01:07.106 --> 02:01:16.029]  The newspapers run several stories talking about the two candidates they're running, the Democrat and Republican, completely omitting the fact that I'm even in the race.
[02:01:16.029 --> 02:01:19.530]  I've contacted the NRA about being endorsed by them.
[02:01:19.530 --> 02:01:28.072]  I was told by the NRA that we're not interested in third-party candidates and basically told, you know, don't let the door hit you on the way out.
[02:01:31.525 --> 02:01:37.810]  Any charity or lobbying group that ends up giving money to third party candidates, the Federal Elections Commission comes after them.
[02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:42.795]  So it's a monopoly with the two parties over elections.
[02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:45.417]  It's a closed shop.
[02:01:45.417 --> 02:01:47.058]  And I understand the idea of breaking it up.
[02:01:47.058 --> 02:01:48.199]  I want to do that.
[02:01:48.199 --> 02:01:50.721]  But then we are faced with this election.
[02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:52.903]  And some libertarians are getting elected.
[02:01:52.903 --> 02:01:58.568]  That's why they're so scared of the Libertarian Party, America's largest and oldest third party.
[02:01:58.568 --> 02:01:59.729]  Well, I support
[02:02:00.439 --> 02:02:11.941]  Lowering your income taxes here in Indiana down to zero, just like Texas has, and increasing that homestead exemption up to 100%, like the governor candidate in Florida wants to do.
[02:02:11.941 --> 02:02:22.303]  So, I don't know what more to do to let the people know, let the voters know, that the Republican Party is not the party of Eisenhower anymore, and the Democratic Party is not the party of Kennedy anymore.
[02:02:22.303 --> 02:02:26.484]  They're both the same corporate, greedy, criminal parties.
[02:02:27.932 --> 02:02:33.257]  That's it, who are using government and selective enforcement to take over the economy and shut down their competition.
[02:02:33.257 --> 02:02:34.698]  They are cancer.
[02:02:34.698 --> 02:02:35.819]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:35.819 --> 02:02:38.602]  Wild man in Texas.
[02:02:38.602 --> 02:02:42.405]  Thank you for calling.
[02:02:42.405 --> 02:02:51.133]  Do you remember about five years ago, at least five years ago, when they had a national scoop of illegal aliens and they bust them all up and took them out of here?
[02:02:51.946 --> 02:02:55.108]  Yeah, I mean, it was a front before they tried to pass Amnesty.
[02:02:55.108 --> 02:02:57.890]  They'd bust a few meat packing plants and a few facilities.
[02:02:57.890 --> 02:03:01.312]  I mean, it was still just for show, but yes.
[02:03:01.312 --> 02:03:02.613]  Yeah, they did it up here.
[02:03:02.613 --> 02:03:03.373]  I'm in the Panhandle.
[02:03:03.373 --> 02:03:06.355]  They did it at Cactus, where there's a big packing house.
[02:03:06.355 --> 02:03:15.021]  Well, they did that, and they got them all out of here, and then they turned right around, and they got all the Somalians in, Guatemalans, and Afghans in here.
[02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:16.622]  And now that's who's messing with our food.
[02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:18.324]  You know?
[02:03:18.324 --> 02:03:19.885]  It is really, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:03:19.885 --> 02:03:23.428]  I almost get Mexicans coming in because they border us.
[02:03:23.428 --> 02:03:24.909]  It's been part of Mexico before.
[02:03:24.909 --> 02:03:27.251]  I mean, I get it.
[02:03:27.251 --> 02:03:34.738]  I don't get why the government ships massive amounts of Somalis in to just take over whole industries in Minneapolis, St.
[02:03:34.738 --> 02:03:36.780]  Paul, and other cities, or whole groups.
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:43.205]  I mean, they're just, the government is doing this on purpose to break the country up so none of us can communicate with each other.
[02:03:43.205 --> 02:03:43.946]  It's Tower of Babel.
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.521]  Yeah, and I mean, they're messing with our food.
[02:03:47.521 --> 02:03:49.742]  So these people, like you said, you know, the borders are open.
[02:03:49.742 --> 02:03:53.844]  They're letting all these thugs in now and stuff that are from God knows where.
[02:03:53.844 --> 02:03:54.644]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:03:54.644 --> 02:03:59.226]  They let felons go who've committed aggravated assaults.
[02:03:59.226 --> 02:04:02.848]  And then, you know, Fox News is asking the sheriff, why did they do this?
[02:04:02.848 --> 02:04:03.808]  They're just like, we don't know.
[02:04:03.808 --> 02:04:05.949]  No, because this is a criminal takeover.
[02:04:07.073 --> 02:04:10.915]  Stalin opened up the jails and got a bunch of people to work for him.
[02:04:10.915 --> 02:04:11.955]  Hitler did that at first.
[02:04:11.955 --> 02:04:13.876]  I mean, this is what they do.
[02:04:13.876 --> 02:04:16.517]  This is a criminal takeover.
[02:04:16.517 --> 02:04:18.859]  Castro sent them to us.
[02:04:18.859 --> 02:04:20.359]  And now everybody else is doing it again.
[02:04:20.359 --> 02:04:24.221]  And then they print 60 million green cards for these people.
[02:04:24.221 --> 02:04:28.063]  I don't know how many of them will actually do it or go vote because they're probably scared they'll get scammed.
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:30.142]  Well listen, listen.
[02:04:30.142 --> 02:04:32.004]  Newspapers all over Latin America, we've shown them.
[02:04:32.004 --> 02:04:32.484]  Advertise.
[02:04:32.484 --> 02:04:33.025]  Go to America.
[02:04:33.025 --> 02:04:33.906]  Here's how to do it.
[02:04:33.906 --> 02:04:35.688]  President Obama wants you free money waiting.
[02:04:35.688 --> 02:04:39.052]  In fact, in Spanish it's free money and a better life waiting.
[02:04:39.052 --> 02:04:39.272]  Go!
[02:04:40.926 --> 02:04:42.227]  I mean, they're going to take over.
[02:04:42.227 --> 02:04:43.129]  They're going to get our guns.
[02:04:43.129 --> 02:04:44.390]  I mean, this is it.
[02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:46.533]  And then they're going to go, we voted to take the guns.
[02:04:46.533 --> 02:04:47.294]  You won't turn them in.
[02:04:47.294 --> 02:04:49.557]  Homeland Security, kill the terrorists.
[02:04:49.557 --> 02:04:50.798]  Vehicles roll out against us.
[02:04:50.798 --> 02:04:51.759]  I mean, it's all been planned.
[02:04:51.759 --> 02:04:58.167]  I don't know if it's a year from now, 10 years from now, but they admit at the gun control groups, they're going to get our guns.
[02:04:58.167 --> 02:04:58.588]  They're coming.
[02:05:00.154 --> 02:05:03.816]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.816 --> 02:05:08.099]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:08.099 --> 02:05:09.860]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:15.204]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:05:15.204 --> 02:05:17.725]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:05:17.725 --> 02:05:18.866]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.866 --> 02:05:21.087]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:05:21.087 --> 02:05:25.510]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:28.332]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:29.813 --> 02:05:40.357]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:40.357 --> 02:05:46.819]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:46.819 --> 02:05:49.180]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:52.261]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[02:06:07.891 --> 02:06:14.177]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:14.177 --> 02:06:17.781]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:17.901 --> 02:06:22.104]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:22.104 --> 02:06:27.428]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:27.428 --> 02:06:28.449]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:28.449 --> 02:06:32.251]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:34.793]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:19.155]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:07:19.195 --> 02:07:19.815]  We're good to go.
[02:07:39.946 --> 02:07:40.306]  We're good.
[02:08:15.959 --> 02:08:28.893]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.893 --> 02:08:37.863]  Well callers, you're gonna get to talk to Tucker Carlson, and of course he's been a host on most of the big TV networks, Fox News, you name it.
[02:08:39.873 --> 02:08:46.480]  And he runs TheDailyCaller.com, one of the most visited news websites in the world.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:51.185]  And we're honored always to be able to get him to pop in with us, especially on Election Day.
[02:08:51.185 --> 02:08:52.846]  So I've got a lot of questions.
[02:08:54.099 --> 02:08:55.880]  A lot of comments.
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:02.503]  I know that callers are lined up to talk about the election, so you can chime in with your point and then we'll get Tucker's take on it.
[02:09:02.503 --> 02:09:08.065]  But before we go any further, Tucker, what do you think the biggest story of 2014 is?
[02:09:08.065 --> 02:09:09.826]  Is it the major political realignment?
[02:09:10.686 --> 02:09:16.128]  Is it going to be what the lame-duck president does with executive powers and amnesty?
[02:09:16.128 --> 02:09:23.951]  Is it going to be the Tea Party insurrection trying to unseat the rhinos and neocons like Boehner?
[02:09:23.951 --> 02:09:29.012]  Is it that they won't win the Senate tonight and there'll be a Harry Truman-esque upset?
[02:09:29.012 --> 02:09:33.514]  What do you think in your gut the big story is going to be tomorrow, Tucker Carlson?
[02:09:34.571 --> 02:09:36.155]  Well, first, hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:09:36.155 --> 02:09:41.767]  Second, I think the story over the next two years is going to be chaos.
[02:09:42.515 --> 02:09:46.658]  There is a lot of movement just beneath the surface in American politics.
[02:09:46.658 --> 02:09:47.979]  I think in American society.
[02:09:47.979 --> 02:09:50.501]  I think globally, actually.
[02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:54.504]  And that's evidence that things are realigning.
[02:09:54.504 --> 02:09:56.246]  And we're right in the middle of it, so it's hard to see.
[02:09:56.246 --> 02:09:59.288]  It's hard to step back and get perspective on what's happening.
[02:09:59.288 --> 02:10:01.890]  But the world is going to look a lot different in two years.
[02:10:01.890 --> 02:10:12.098]  Our assumptions now, you know, that Hillary Clinton is going to run against Jeb Bush, I think all of them will be proven wrong in the end as people start to move to places politically they never thought
[02:10:12.658 --> 02:10:17.120]  They would be, and that's one of the reasons that we're having so much trouble forecasting what's going to happen tonight.
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.063]  I mean, it should be, as you know, it should be a pretty clean sweep for Republicans.
[02:10:21.063 --> 02:10:23.184]  The President's incredibly unpopular.
[02:10:23.184 --> 02:10:24.864]  He's done a lot to earn that.
[02:10:24.864 --> 02:10:30.708]  People are terrified of the direction the country's moving, and so the party not in power ought to be the beneficiary of that.
[02:10:30.708 --> 02:10:35.610]  Obviously, that's always the way it's worked up until this year, and yet Republicans are having trouble sealing the deal.
[02:10:35.610 --> 02:10:36.771]  Why is that?
[02:10:36.771 --> 02:10:39.052]  Because things are just much more confusing than they've ever been.
[02:10:40.478 --> 02:10:41.979]  DailyCaller.com.
[02:10:41.979 --> 02:10:44.841]  I've got a stack of the breaking news you've got up there today.
[02:10:44.841 --> 02:10:54.709]  A lot of news about election fraud, vote flipping going on, pollsters says Obama may be the most destructive president to his own party.
[02:10:54.709 --> 02:11:00.133]  We saw what Ben Stein on Fox News saying he's the most racist president ever.
[02:11:00.133 --> 02:11:06.458]  I don't know if I agree with that, but he certainly has race baited and used race more than any president in recent history.
[02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:07.519]  Exactly.
[02:11:08.899 --> 02:11:10.600]  I have no idea what's in his heart.
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:14.420]  I have no idea what his true beliefs are, but it's very clear.
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:26.723]  They've made it as clear as it's ever been in the last two weeks that they're willing to use race to divide the country and get out the vote, and use racial fears to get their base, you know, out to the polls.
[02:11:26.723 --> 02:11:28.143]  And I think it's effective.
[02:11:28.143 --> 02:11:28.944]  It works.
[02:11:28.944 --> 02:11:29.544]  Fear works.
[02:11:29.544 --> 02:11:30.684]  It works for me, by the way.
[02:11:30.684 --> 02:11:31.584]  I'm motivated.
[02:11:31.584 --> 02:11:33.245]  When I'm afraid, it motivates me.
[02:11:33.245 --> 02:11:35.005]  I think human beings are all that way.
[02:11:35.525 --> 02:11:41.148]  But in the case of racial division, there's a consequence that lasts far beyond election day.
[02:11:41.148 --> 02:11:45.270]  If you stoke people up along racial lines, you get ethnic politics.
[02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:46.211]  And look around the world.
[02:11:46.211 --> 02:11:47.131]  You've traveled.
[02:11:47.131 --> 02:11:51.433]  You know practically every other country on the planet is divided by ethnic politics.
[02:11:51.433 --> 02:11:52.854]  We haven't been historically.
[02:11:53.494 --> 02:11:57.978]  Um, but we're moving in that direction, and it's really scary, because ethnic politics doesn't go away.
[02:11:57.978 --> 02:12:01.562]  If you and I disagree on an issue, the issue can be resolved, and we can become friends again.
[02:12:01.562 --> 02:12:04.564]  If we're divided by race, race is immutable.
[02:12:04.564 --> 02:12:05.245]  It doesn't change.
[02:12:05.245 --> 02:12:08.428]  We're always divided, and those divisions can be bitter.
[02:12:08.428 --> 02:12:09.409]  They can turn violent.
[02:12:09.409 --> 02:12:12.892]  I mean, you don't even want to play with that stuff, and they're doing it in a big way, and it's reckless.
[02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:25.291]  There was a Rasmussen poll yesterday reporting that 77% of Americans think that race-baiting is just a desperate tactic and a political diversion and they think it doesn't work anymore.
[02:12:25.291 --> 02:12:32.314]  I agree with you that it still works to a certain extent, that's why they're using it, but that time's running out for that.
[02:12:32.314 --> 02:12:35.956]  But there's a real attempt by the establishment, by the large elements of it,
[02:12:36.576 --> 02:12:54.441]  To kind of use the British great game of divide and conquer here on America, and that's why they want to flood us with all these illegals, not to bring in new blood and folks to pay Social Security, because we've aborted all our future, 50-something million people, but to create that balkanization.
[02:12:55.345 --> 02:12:57.187]  I don't think there's any doubt about it.
[02:12:57.187 --> 02:13:01.573]  There's no doubt that they see immigration as a source of political power.
[02:13:01.573 --> 02:13:02.474]  And that's scary.
[02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:07.301]  I mean, look, you know, like every American, I grew up on the border like you.
[02:13:07.301 --> 02:13:10.224]  I'm kind of pro-immigrant in a lot of ways.
[02:13:10.224 --> 02:13:11.226]  A lot of immigrants work hard.
[02:13:11.226 --> 02:13:11.967]  I'm totally for it.
[02:13:12.407 --> 02:13:19.034]  But massive amounts of low-wage, low-skilled immigration are exactly the opposite of what you want when you've got high unemployment.
[02:13:19.034 --> 02:13:24.399]  So they clearly just don't care at all about people who are earning a wage in the United States.
[02:13:24.399 --> 02:13:26.361]  They just don't care at all.
[02:13:26.361 --> 02:13:32.567]  It's a trade-off between helping the middle class, helping ordinary people, and shoring up their own political power.
[02:13:32.567 --> 02:13:33.828]  They don't think twice.
[02:13:33.828 --> 02:13:34.729]  You know what side they're on.
[02:13:35.882 --> 02:13:38.423]  Even though it'll end up hurting their children and grandchildren.
[02:13:38.423 --> 02:13:41.725]  Tucker Carlson, DailyCaller.com is our guest.
[02:13:41.725 --> 02:13:45.067]  I want to shift out of the election for a moment before we go back into it.
[02:13:45.067 --> 02:13:47.208]  What's the state of the media right now?
[02:13:47.208 --> 02:13:52.751]  Because we're seeing billions of web pages being created a year when it was just 30-something million back in 1996.
[02:13:54.372 --> 02:13:54.652]  I don't
[02:14:14.212 --> 02:14:20.158]  To the point they've now rigged Alexa to show our ratings dropping while our internal ratings show we're skyrocketing.
[02:14:20.158 --> 02:14:26.124]  But just like Nielsen's been caught fixing things for MSNBC, it just doesn't work on the final equation anymore.
[02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:31.128]  I mean, as you said, we are in a realignment, and so the earthquake's happening right now.
[02:14:31.128 --> 02:14:35.392]  We don't know what the landscape will be in a year or two, but we can kind of get some ideas.
[02:14:35.392 --> 02:14:36.413]  What do you expect
[02:14:37.274 --> 02:14:54.103]  Uh, the establishment media to do, because all the moves they're doing, doubling down on lying, doubling down on dumbing it down, that is causing an even faster exodus away from those traditional media outlets, and they seem to just be accelerating what's not working.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.980]  I think that's a really good analysis.
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:14:58.541]  They are hysterical.
[02:14:58.541 --> 02:15:01.641]  People who see the end coming tend to get hysterical.
[02:15:01.641 --> 02:15:06.062]  A lot of these are people who can't function outside the media.
[02:15:06.062 --> 02:15:08.103]  They never make it in a normal job.
[02:15:08.103 --> 02:15:11.664]  The only option for them is to go to some depressing PR firm.
[02:15:11.664 --> 02:15:12.704]  They know it.
[02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:15.585]  You know, they've had really easy jobs all these years.
[02:15:15.585 --> 02:15:19.045]  They've had a full monopoly on information in the country.
[02:15:19.045 --> 02:15:21.946]  And they're looking at retirement years that are pretty bleak.
[02:15:22.787 --> 02:15:25.691]  And so they're lashing out, I would say.
[02:15:25.691 --> 02:15:28.074]  And they've totally abandoned their standards.
[02:15:28.074 --> 02:15:32.080]  I mean, they've always been obviously aligned with the Democratic Party.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:33.122]  They've always been a liberal.
[02:15:33.122 --> 02:15:34.383]  Most journalists are liberal.
[02:15:34.383 --> 02:15:37.288]  But after the 2008 election, they just took the mask off.
[02:15:37.888 --> 02:15:44.973]  And they're just kind of openly cheerleading for one political party, and in so doing, as you just said, they devalue their own currency.
[02:15:44.973 --> 02:15:46.334]  Nobody believes them anymore.
[02:15:46.334 --> 02:15:49.757]  NBC is the least trusted news organization in the country.
[02:15:49.757 --> 02:15:50.677]  When did that happen?
[02:15:50.677 --> 02:15:52.538]  I mean, it didn't take long, by the way.
[02:15:52.538 --> 02:15:59.263]  I don't know exactly what the numbers were, but I bet 15 years ago NBC was probably number two behind ABC, another at the bottom.
[02:15:59.263 --> 02:16:04.487]  So that tells you what you get when you just decide, you know what, I'm no longer a news
[02:16:09.190 --> 02:16:10.931]  What does it mean for them?
[02:16:10.931 --> 02:16:12.752]  How do you see the fall of the dinosaurs?
[02:16:12.752 --> 02:16:14.513]  Because they're already in the desert.
[02:16:14.513 --> 02:16:15.994]  They already don't have any water.
[02:16:15.994 --> 02:16:17.915]  Some of them are starting to fall down and die.
[02:16:17.915 --> 02:16:21.737]  And they're in their death throes.
[02:16:21.737 --> 02:16:26.760]  And obviously government can't come in with censorship and regulation, though they're trying to save the day.
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:31.763]  No amount of stimulus money to MSNBC or NPR is going to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:16:32.463 --> 02:16:35.367]  So we're beginning to see rigor mortis set in.
[02:16:35.367 --> 02:16:45.821]  What do you expect the final death throes to look like and what is your gut as a successful media guy on your own independently and inside the system?
[02:16:45.821 --> 02:16:49.546]  What do you in your gut think things are going to look like say in five years?
[02:16:50.123 --> 02:16:53.648]  Well, I think, look, I'm 45, so I'm not that old.
[02:16:53.648 --> 02:17:02.400]  I remember when I started in this business, and my dad was in this business, I've been around it all my life, and I remember when I graduated college thinking, I want to work at Newsweek or Time.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:03.582]  I mean, that was a big deal.
[02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:07.988]  Those were the best places for a magazine writer to work, and I was a magazine writer.
[02:17:08.832 --> 02:17:10.973]  And now, they don't exist!
[02:17:10.973 --> 02:17:15.335]  I mean, I guess maybe they do technically exist, but they kind of slipped beneath the waves with almost no notice.
[02:17:15.335 --> 02:17:24.320]  Newsweek was bought by, you know, the rich husband of a Democratic Congresswoman, and then it kind of went bankrupt, and now it just exists online, I guess, sort of.
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:33.244]  I mean, they just kind of faded away, but they did so really, really quickly, and I think the same thing will happen maybe even faster to the broadcast networks, because the truth is,
[02:17:33.804 --> 02:17:35.905]  You and I could pull our money and put out a magazine.
[02:17:35.905 --> 02:17:41.649]  We couldn't pull our money and put out a TV channel, because it's really expensive to operate a television network, as you know.
[02:17:41.649 --> 02:17:43.750]  And so, a broadcast television network.
[02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:46.131]  So, I just think they're unsustainable.
[02:17:46.131 --> 02:17:47.632]  I mean, they will go away.
[02:17:47.632 --> 02:17:50.814]  I bet ten years from now, they won't exist.
[02:17:50.814 --> 02:17:52.475]  And it's kind of a shame.
[02:17:52.475 --> 02:17:53.696]  I'm talking about the news networks.
[02:17:53.696 --> 02:17:56.738]  There'll always be a role for entertainment, obviously, and sports.
[02:17:56.738 --> 02:18:00.480]  But the big-time news networks, I don't think will be here.
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:02.001]  And I think a lot of it's their fault.
[02:18:03.453 --> 02:18:04.593]  They don't get it, by the way.
[02:18:04.593 --> 02:18:12.777]  They are so... If you go... I mean, I spend a lot of time in that world, because I live in New York part of the week, and everybody in that world is exactly the same.
[02:18:12.777 --> 02:18:13.517]  There's no air.
[02:18:13.517 --> 02:18:18.859]  They never let the door open and let new ideas or fresh perspectives or people with different backgrounds in.
[02:18:18.859 --> 02:18:22.560]  They talk about diversity, but it is the most homogeneous group.
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:30.343]  Well, that is my next point, is they're like a cult of dodo birds that don't realize the sailors just arrived and they're all about to get eaten.
[02:18:33.382 --> 02:18:43.936]  And when I watch CNN or MSNBC especially, it is a revolving door of all these Democratic Party chiefs of staff and all these hacks.
[02:18:43.936 --> 02:18:49.303]  And it'd be one thing if they were well spoken or good looking or interesting or funny, but they're so selfish.
[02:18:49.984 --> 02:19:04.196]  They go advise the network heads to put them in, even though it only makes the ratings drop, but they don't care because even though it's a diminishing narcissistic platform, they don't care because they feel like they're successful when they go home for Thanksgiving with mom and dad.
[02:19:04.196 --> 02:19:13.043]  I mean, I tell you, I really think they've lost control, and I think that's why they're counting on the police state, Tucker, is because they think oppression will work.
[02:19:13.043 --> 02:19:14.305]  That's not going to work either.
[02:19:14.305 --> 02:19:16.907]  I think this political clash is basically done.
[02:19:18.018 --> 02:19:29.251]  Well, you know, I used to think, of course I agree with you completely, I think they're going to be replaced probably sooner than they realize because we're in this moment of convulsion and change for sure.
[02:19:29.251 --> 02:19:32.655]  But what I'm so struck by is how much liberals have changed when I was a kid.
[02:19:33.363 --> 02:19:37.486]  They were, or at least I believe them to be, you know, really kind of committed to free speech.
[02:19:37.486 --> 02:19:40.829]  I mean, they defended the right of the creeps to march at Skokie.
[02:19:40.829 --> 02:19:43.391]  They had some moral high ground.
[02:19:43.391 --> 02:19:46.453]  I'll die for your right to express yourself even if I disagree.
[02:19:46.453 --> 02:19:47.955]  Something happened along the way.
[02:19:47.955 --> 02:19:49.676]  I don't recognize modern liberals.
[02:19:49.676 --> 02:19:51.177]  They're fully authoritarian.
[02:19:51.177 --> 02:19:52.378]  They don't want you to speak.
[02:19:52.378 --> 02:19:53.819]  You're threatening me with your speech.
[02:19:53.819 --> 02:19:55.140]  I feel uncomfortable.
[02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:56.721]  You're making this an unsafe place.
[02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:58.123]  Be quiet or I'll arrest you.
[02:19:58.123 --> 02:19:58.603]  Really?
[02:19:58.603 --> 02:20:00.164]  They have no regard for the First Amendment.
[02:20:00.164 --> 02:20:01.045]  It's conservatives.
[02:20:04.426 --> 02:20:10.188]  Well, that's right, and that's why people liked liberals, even if you disagree with some of their politics.
[02:20:10.188 --> 02:20:11.268]  Hey, they're for free speech.
[02:20:11.268 --> 02:20:13.069]  Hey, they're for labeling GMO.
[02:20:13.069 --> 02:20:14.930]  Hey, you know, they're for diversity.
[02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:18.071]  Now, it's a cult, and that was another question I was going to bring up.
[02:20:18.071 --> 02:20:29.415]  I could play these clips, but back when the Boston bombing happened, they had a host on there say, on purpose, and they had the former head of the RNC on there with them agreeing with it,
[02:20:30.330 --> 02:20:37.078]  Yeah, they bombed it because they listened to Alex Jones, and he influenced the bombers, and he's deeply racist.
[02:20:37.078 --> 02:20:43.264]  And I went to my lawyer and he said, yeah, you can spend a million bucks, win a lawsuit, and win maybe two million dollars, kind of like Ventura did.
[02:20:43.264 --> 02:20:44.906]  He said, do you want to waste your time?
[02:20:44.906 --> 02:20:46.468]  It's going to be hell.
[02:20:46.468 --> 02:20:47.209]  Is your time worth it?
[02:20:47.209 --> 02:20:47.809]  And I said, no.
[02:20:48.810 --> 02:21:03.299]  And but but I came to realization MSNBC five years ago would have never come out and said that I'm involved in the Boston bombing and I'm deeply racist without showing some proof even if it was flimsy so yes there is a major shift now
[02:21:03.959 --> 02:21:12.943]  Where it's like they're trying to commit suicide politically in front of us and they don't see it because they're still in the big rotting facade.
[02:21:12.943 --> 02:21:17.325]  When I went and debated Piers Morgan, I'd been in those same studios a few years before.
[02:21:17.325 --> 02:21:18.125]  They were nice.
[02:21:18.125 --> 02:21:19.326]  It was rotting.
[02:21:19.326 --> 02:21:20.906]  The bathrooms were unclean.
[02:21:20.906 --> 02:21:24.588]  Everyone looked depressed, like a demoralized army that was about to collapse.
[02:21:25.328 --> 02:21:31.957]  And that's what I see them doing, but it's the wildness and the not caring and the no standard.
[02:21:31.957 --> 02:21:34.280]  I could have sued them and won.
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:38.185]  And I mean, guaranteed, my lawyer said he's one of the top lawyers in Texas.
[02:21:38.185 --> 02:21:41.729]  And they just, of course, I'm not suing them, but it shows a recklessness.
[02:21:41.729 --> 02:21:42.931]  What do you take from that rant?
[02:21:44.358 --> 02:21:47.540]  Well, I'm just, my jaw is open because they called you racist.
[02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:53.223]  I mean, it's one thing... I hate to say it, but that term has lost almost all meaning.
[02:21:53.223 --> 02:21:55.144]  It doesn't really mean anything anymore.
[02:21:55.144 --> 02:21:57.765]  Basically, it's a way of telling you to be quiet.
[02:21:57.765 --> 02:21:59.526]  We don't want to hear what you're saying.
[02:21:59.526 --> 02:22:01.767]  What you say threatens our power.
[02:22:01.767 --> 02:22:02.948]  Therefore, shut up.
[02:22:03.439 --> 02:22:06.443]  I mean, that's basically, that's the message of, you're a racist.
[02:22:06.443 --> 02:22:11.671]  It's not the beginning of a conversation about tolerance or diversity or what racism is.
[02:22:11.671 --> 02:22:16.097]  It's an attempt to end the conversation, to end your speech, by calling you names.
[02:22:16.813 --> 02:22:20.478]  And it's the most tired thing and the dumbest thing ever.
[02:22:20.478 --> 02:22:25.625]  I think it's very wise not even to bother with a lawsuit, you know, with them.
[02:22:25.625 --> 02:22:27.768]  That's just a drain on your energy.
[02:22:27.768 --> 02:22:29.590]  Lawsuits almost always are.
[02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:33.836]  Even when you win, you know, it saps all your mojo, I think.
[02:22:34.096 --> 02:22:37.221]  Sure, that's why I brought it up, but the recklessness.
[02:22:37.221 --> 02:22:41.507]  Like when I was on Nightline five years ago, they tried to fact-check, they tried to research.
[02:22:41.507 --> 02:22:46.715]  Yeah, they tried to discredit me, but they did a journalistic job at least half-baked.
[02:22:46.715 --> 02:22:48.338]  They don't even put the cake in the oven now.
[02:22:50.239 --> 02:22:54.120]  Because they don't have to!
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:55.661]  Because nobody cares.
[02:22:55.661 --> 02:22:57.021]  I mean, that's kind of the flip side.
[02:22:57.021 --> 02:23:00.222]  Whereas 15 years ago, NBC News was a big deal.
[02:23:00.222 --> 02:23:01.222]  It was respected.
[02:23:01.222 --> 02:23:06.024]  People expected that they would do diligence when they said things.
[02:23:06.024 --> 02:23:07.244]  Now, it's like, yeah, whatever.
[02:23:07.244 --> 02:23:08.125]  It's MSNBC.
[02:23:08.125 --> 02:23:08.725]  They're crazy.
[02:23:08.725 --> 02:23:10.045]  It's the Leon Trotsky Channel.
[02:23:10.045 --> 02:23:11.186]  Nobody cares.
[02:23:11.186 --> 02:23:11.806]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:11.806 --> 02:23:14.747]  Like, there really isn't an expectation that they're accurate in the first place.
[02:23:14.747 --> 02:23:15.647]  It's not as big a deal.
[02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:19.392]  But then Daily Caller can have millions of visitors every day.
[02:23:19.392 --> 02:23:21.414]  Infowars.com can have that.
[02:23:21.414 --> 02:23:26.678]  This talk radio show has conservatively, and it's a small show compared to a lot of them, 3 million people a day.
[02:23:26.678 --> 02:23:29.220]  You count, you know, YouTube and stuff.
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:33.503]  Every week it's like 15 to 18 million people tune in or watch.
[02:23:33.503 --> 02:23:39.548]  And then you look at CNN and others and they're just still... You've been inside there so much.
[02:23:39.548 --> 02:23:41.810]  Are they really arrogant or is it a front, Tucker?
[02:23:42.631 --> 02:23:43.451]  Oh no.
[02:23:43.451 --> 02:23:45.972]  Oh, the arrogance is bone deep.
[02:23:45.972 --> 02:23:48.314]  The arrogance is the one thing that's real.
[02:23:48.314 --> 02:23:50.234]  It's the one thing they all have in common.
[02:23:50.234 --> 02:23:54.656]  And again, it's a product of never meeting anybody who disagrees with you.
[02:23:54.656 --> 02:23:55.677]  I mean, you know what?
[02:23:55.677 --> 02:24:00.339]  Look, even in Texas, there are lots of people who don't share your views.
[02:24:00.339 --> 02:24:02.020]  There is political diversity in Texas.
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:05.481]  It's a pretty red state, but there are blue parts of it, you know?
[02:24:05.481 --> 02:24:07.721]  Especially where you live in.
[02:24:07.721 --> 02:24:10.442]  They live in a world where nobody disagrees with them.
[02:24:10.442 --> 02:24:13.862]  They never meet anybody with a different view.
[02:24:13.862 --> 02:24:23.644]  So, their impression is that outside of the west side of Manhattan, everyone's like a cannibal, or married to a sister, or handling snakes, or, you know, smoking meth.
[02:24:23.644 --> 02:24:26.185]  They have the lowest possible opinion of America.
[02:24:28.407 --> 02:24:30.769]  They really do underestimate America.
[02:24:30.769 --> 02:24:35.173]  So in the final equation before we shift back into the election, go to break, take some calls.
[02:24:35.173 --> 02:24:38.636]  We've got a short clip we're going to play of James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project.
[02:24:38.636 --> 02:24:42.599]  I want to get your view on what he's been doing as well.
[02:24:42.599 --> 02:24:49.745]  So do you expect him to try to then bring in some type of fairness doctrine over the internet?
[02:24:49.745 --> 02:24:51.347]  I know the Senate's been talking about that.
[02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:59.083]  Well, I mean, I think that is absolutely the goal, but it won't be done under the normal justification.
[02:24:59.083 --> 02:25:09.573]  The justification was before, for the Fairness Act, as you know, was, you know, we need the airwaves are a public trust, they belong to everybody, therefore you ought to have both sides on them.
[02:25:09.573 --> 02:25:17.541]  Now, the airwaves don't exist, everything is digital, you can't make that, you can't use that as justification, so now they will use some species of diversity.
[02:25:18.081 --> 02:25:28.745]  You know that this is a pluralistic country, it's a multi-ethnic country, and too many news organizations are owned by one group, and we need, the government is going to force equal representation on the airwaves.
[02:25:28.745 --> 02:25:31.646]  And that's, if I had to guess, that would be the justification.
[02:25:31.646 --> 02:25:42.029]  And then they'll break up News Corp, set the precedent to go after everybody else, they've been talking about that, and then they'll break up news websites and say you've got to have an area to show different views.
[02:25:42.029 --> 02:25:44.430]  In fact, you're right, that's what they've been proposing.
[02:25:44.430 --> 02:25:45.850]  Sure, and if you're against it, guess what?
[02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:47.631]  You're a, wait for it, racist.
[02:25:48.697 --> 02:25:51.099]  Well, I have a lot of problems with some of the things Rupert Murdoch does.
[02:25:51.099 --> 02:26:00.346]  I know you work for him, but at the same time, they're popular because they have a lot more Americana-type stuff being promoted than CNN, MSNBC, and all of them combined, but...
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:06.822]  I defended them during the hacking scandal because it was clearly political.
[02:26:06.822 --> 02:26:13.684]  It was clearly a witch hunt to try to bring them down and basically blackmail them to go along with the establishment.
[02:26:13.684 --> 02:26:19.806]  And now that's happening with statements out of, you know, Rupert Murdoch about how great Hillary Clinton is.
[02:26:19.806 --> 02:26:23.547]  I just don't understand why so many of these blue blood conservatives
[02:26:24.849 --> 02:26:27.957]  are attacking the Tea Party and going with this party line.
[02:26:27.957 --> 02:26:32.148]  I think the real Libertarian Tea Party is the hope of the Republican Party.
[02:26:32.148 --> 02:26:32.609]  What do you think?
[02:26:33.973 --> 02:26:35.394]  Well, I think that's absolutely true.
[02:26:35.394 --> 02:26:40.918]  I mean, there's a... I heard the smartest thing the other day from someone involved in Republican politics.
[02:26:40.918 --> 02:26:45.661]  He said, the Democratic Party is strong because there's perfect alignment between its donors and its voters.
[02:26:45.661 --> 02:26:50.965]  The rich people who fund the Democratic Party agree completely with the far left of their base, right?
[02:26:50.965 --> 02:26:54.387]  So George Soros agrees with your average primary voter in the Democratic Party.
[02:26:54.387 --> 02:26:59.671]  On the conservative side, Republican donors have total contempt for Republican voters.
[02:27:00.271 --> 02:27:06.114]  Who really, I mean, the base of the Republican Party is kind of a Tea Party, Libertarian, freedom-oriented people.
[02:27:06.114 --> 02:27:09.135]  You know, lower taxes, pretty socially conservative.
[02:27:09.135 --> 02:27:10.976]  That's not who funds the Republican Party.
[02:27:10.976 --> 02:27:19.280]  The Republican Party is funded by and large from business, Wall Street, and these are people who want lower taxes, less regulation for themselves, but they're certainly not above
[02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:23.062]  They're striking some sort of private deal with politicians to help their businesses.
[02:27:23.062 --> 02:27:25.643]  They're not at all socially conservative.
[02:27:25.643 --> 02:27:27.504]  They're as libertine as the Democrats.
[02:27:27.504 --> 02:27:32.406]  And so it's a problem when your funders hate your voters.
[02:27:32.406 --> 02:27:33.507]  You can see what I mean.
[02:27:33.507 --> 02:27:33.907]  Wow.
[02:27:33.907 --> 02:27:43.212]  What will happen if conservatives and libertarians realize for survival we've got to start really giving a lot of money to Patriot-type candidates?
[02:27:43.212 --> 02:27:44.352]  Well, we know what will happen.
[02:27:44.352 --> 02:27:47.154]  They'll send in the IRS to harass everybody.
[02:27:47.814 --> 02:27:52.459]  So we see the weaknesses of the Death Star by where they put their defenses.
[02:27:52.459 --> 02:28:03.430]  We blow up this political monopoly, this status monopoly, by not being intimidated by the IRS like the preachers are doing now, not being intimidated in politically giving, politically running.
[02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:09.956]  I think we become political animals, like I did 20 years ago, like you did 30 years ago, for basic survival.
[02:28:09.956 --> 02:28:11.157]  You either get involved
[02:28:11.958 --> 02:28:18.861]  Or we will basically go into a pure democracy where hordes of illegals will vote away our freedoms?
[02:28:18.861 --> 02:28:31.785]  Well, that appears to be... I mean, there's no... I mean, as someone who grew up in California and looks back at that state when I grew up in it, and I'm not that old, that state was the richest out of 50 and the nicest, had great schools, excellent infrastructure.
[02:28:31.785 --> 02:28:34.326]  It was pretty reasonable, you know, politically.
[02:28:34.326 --> 02:28:38.688]  Now it's a one-party state that's literally crumbling and has more poverty than any other state.
[02:28:39.328 --> 02:28:40.269]  Why is that?
[02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:45.451]  Well, there's only one thing that changed, and that's the composition of the population of California because of immigration.
[02:28:45.451 --> 02:28:54.114]  So immigration changes your politics dramatically, and there are a lot of people at the donor level, on the Republican Party side, I hate to say it, who really don't care.
[02:28:54.114 --> 02:28:59.317]  Because it means cheaper help for them at home, and it means more profits for their businesses, and I think it's a very short-sighted view.
[02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:01.090]  Well that's right.
[02:29:01.090 --> 02:29:04.658]  It'd be one thing if they were bringing in giant groups of people to build them up.
[02:29:04.658 --> 02:29:10.671]  Like Ross Perot documented, this level of immigration will bring us down and it won't even help the third world countries they're fleeing.
[02:29:11.334 --> 02:29:13.015]  No, and it won't help the immigrants themselves.
[02:29:13.015 --> 02:29:20.958]  I mean, look, at a certain point, you know, I'm for bringing in hard-working, smart people with a lot to contribute.
[02:29:20.958 --> 02:29:21.798]  I'm totally for it.
[02:29:21.798 --> 02:29:22.219]  Absolutely.
[02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:30.122]  What I'm totally against is in a post-industrial economy, bringing in people for whom there are no factory jobs, people with fourth-grade education, who are poor.
[02:29:30.122 --> 02:29:31.262]  Nothing against them personally.
[02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:33.123]  God loves them as much as he loves anybody else.
[02:29:33.123 --> 02:29:36.725]  But that's the issue, is the Democrats want people they can mold into whatever they want.
[02:29:37.685 --> 02:29:39.588]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.588 --> 02:29:41.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.001 --> 02:30:01.982]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:01.982 --> 02:30:06.503]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:30:06.503 --> 02:30:10.964]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:10.964 --> 02:30:18.286]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:18.286 --> 02:30:27.349]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:30:27.569 --> 02:30:33.112]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:30:33.112 --> 02:30:40.717]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:30:40.717 --> 02:30:43.278]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:30:43.278 --> 02:30:48.421]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWard.

[02:31:00.206 --> 02:31:09.870]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:19.794]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:19.794 --> 02:31:22.715]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:31:22.935 --> 02:31:23.215]  I think?
[02:31:45.495 --> 02:31:50.841]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[02:32:01.394 --> 02:32:06.358]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:06.358 --> 02:32:09.040]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:16.086]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:16.086 --> 02:32:19.088]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:19.088 --> 02:32:22.030]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:24.052]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:24.052 --> 02:32:26.854]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:26.954 --> 02:32:32.678]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:32.678 --> 02:32:36.200]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:39.302]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:32:39.302 --> 02:32:46.387]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:32:46.607 --> 02:32:49.813]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:33:20.806 --> 02:33:25.829]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:28.891]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.891 --> 02:33:29.892]  Look, it's very simple.
[02:33:29.892 --> 02:33:39.257]  You either have government of, for, by the people based on free market and basic values, or you have law of the jungle.
[02:33:39.257 --> 02:33:41.859]  Government of, for, and by conquest.
[02:33:43.323 --> 02:33:44.063]  And we've seen that.
[02:33:44.063 --> 02:33:51.845]  That's why there's such beautiful places all around the world that are in total squalor and have smart people with high IQs that live there.
[02:33:51.845 --> 02:33:57.566]  But they never had basic freedom, they never had basic values, so they're sitting in their own crap.
[02:33:57.566 --> 02:33:59.887]  I'm sorry to have to describe it that way.
[02:33:59.887 --> 02:34:03.207]  And listen, my family's all been successful.
[02:34:03.207 --> 02:34:08.808]  If America collapses just like we came here on the Mayflower and other ventures, I'll just go somewhere else.
[02:34:08.808 --> 02:34:11.049]  Even though globally there's not many other places to go.
[02:34:12.102 --> 02:34:18.089]  I'm really sad for the general public because the American dream is being stolen by fraud.
[02:34:18.089 --> 02:34:21.793]  And then those of us that produce are seen as the greedy enemies.
[02:34:21.793 --> 02:34:27.220]  And so many rich elites team up with that because they're crony capitalists.
[02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:32.206]  If you vote with your dollars, and you vote with your actions, and you vote by word of mouth, you could change the world.
[02:34:34.042 --> 02:34:38.369]  Fifteen years ago, you couldn't find organic food, as I've said a thousand times, almost anywhere.
[02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:42.576]  In restaurants, in grocery stores, there was little boutiques, whole foods were tiny.
[02:34:42.576 --> 02:34:44.599]  We each filled co-op.
[02:34:45.834 --> 02:34:51.776]  Fast forward, because people started buying it and supporting it, it expanded the market, drove down prices.
[02:34:51.776 --> 02:35:02.081]  With competition now, you go to a Target or a Walmart, they at least say it's organic or non-GMO, and the ketchup isn't, you know, it's sugar, it's not high fructose, you know, corn syrup.
[02:35:02.081 --> 02:35:07.023]  Just your voting over 15 years has almost overthrown their system.
[02:35:08.208 --> 02:35:14.592]  McDonald's is down 33% this year, 27% last year, and so is all the other major fast food.
[02:35:14.592 --> 02:35:17.274]  People are done.
[02:35:17.274 --> 02:35:20.415]  Just by voting and demanding some quality, you got it.
[02:35:20.415 --> 02:35:24.518]  Now, on so many other fronts, we don't demand it, so we get things degenerating.
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:34.048]  When you promote InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or DailyCaller.com or DrudgeReport.com or WorldNetDaily.com, none of us are perfect.
[02:35:34.048 --> 02:35:35.430]  We've got a bunch of writers.
[02:35:35.430 --> 02:35:37.772]  I say stuff that's wrong sometimes.
[02:35:37.772 --> 02:35:39.494]  I'm a different person than I was ten years ago.
[02:35:39.494 --> 02:35:40.975]  The point is I'm trying to be good.
[02:35:40.975 --> 02:35:42.177]  I'm trying to tell the truth.
[02:35:42.177 --> 02:35:43.798]  I'm trying to be honorable.
[02:35:43.798 --> 02:35:45.160]  I'm trying to have a future for my kids.
[02:35:46.497 --> 02:35:55.225]  And when you buy the books, the videos, the supplements, spread the word, support our local affiliates, you don't see it, but that's what grows the liberty movement.
[02:35:55.225 --> 02:35:57.587]  Just like with organic food or anything else.
[02:35:57.587 --> 02:36:07.917]  And if libertarian conservatives would just start running for office, even if you don't win to educate people, would just start giving money, not just to politicians or statesmen,
[02:36:08.786 --> 02:36:20.550]  But would start buying cases of books and giving them to people, and buying cases of the new film, Utopia, that we're distributing, that we're the exclusive distributor of, up until December.
[02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:22.771]  There's No Place Like Utopia, by Joel Gilbert.
[02:36:22.771 --> 02:36:26.753]  Excellent film about the free market, and the nightmare of socialism and collectivism.
[02:36:26.753 --> 02:36:28.053]  Everyone should see that.
[02:36:28.053 --> 02:36:29.334]  You know the truth.
[02:36:29.334 --> 02:36:30.554]  Your grandkids don't.
[02:36:30.554 --> 02:36:31.694]  Your kids don't.
[02:36:31.694 --> 02:36:34.355]  The library, donate it.
[02:36:34.355 --> 02:36:38.317]  It's, the only reason I've been successful, and I'm going to Tucker Carlson, and I want to get his take on what I just said,
[02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:47.253]  Is because no training in RTF, no nothing, and you can see that the first 10-15 years, I didn't want to turn my guns in.
[02:36:47.253 --> 02:36:51.195]  I saw them taking farmer's property, environmental groups, to turn around and build on it later.
[02:36:51.195 --> 02:36:52.595]  I saw mafia tactics.
[02:36:52.595 --> 02:36:53.496]  I got angry.
[02:36:53.496 --> 02:36:55.317]  I decided not to live in a ditch.
[02:36:55.317 --> 02:36:56.577]  I decided to stand up.
[02:36:56.577 --> 02:37:00.419]  I'm not living on my knees, folks.
[02:37:00.419 --> 02:37:03.320]  And I have reached hundreds of millions of people.
[02:37:04.369 --> 02:37:06.491]  Because of you supporting.
[02:37:06.491 --> 02:37:15.240]  So we're in a death battle right now with collectivists who want to finish the game, domesticate America, get 60% on welfare, get everybody dependent.
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:16.241]  They think it's game over.
[02:37:16.241 --> 02:37:17.042]  They think we're done.
[02:37:17.042 --> 02:37:19.664]  History shows evil is always arrogant.
[02:37:19.664 --> 02:37:26.171]  We have a very good chance of having a cultural revolution, not of communism, but of renaissance that will overthrow them.
[02:37:26.311 --> 02:37:34.897]  Now I'm ranting, Tucker Carlson of DailyCaller.com's on, but you talk to a guy that's got one of the biggest news websites out there, been successful in mainstream media, alternative.
[02:37:34.897 --> 02:37:47.425]  I'm really landing on the line here that this is the come-to-Jesus moment for everybody out there listening to do more, to click on our sponsors, but to start their own websites, to do their own YouTube channels, to do their own radio show.
[02:37:47.425 --> 02:37:53.489]  You can't just count on Tucker Carlson or Joseph Farah or Alex Jones or Glenn Beck.
[02:37:53.489 --> 02:37:55.090]  You've got to do it.
[02:37:55.090 --> 02:37:55.991]  Tucker, you've got the floor.
[02:37:57.392 --> 02:38:06.961]  Well, I mean, I completely agree with that, and one of the reasons I'm not a liberal is because I just despise whining and people playing the victim.
[02:38:06.961 --> 02:38:12.086]  I really don't like it, and in my worst moments I do it myself, and I'm ashamed when I do.
[02:38:12.086 --> 02:38:18.813]  But I guess my point is that if you don't like the media as you find them, and you shouldn't because they're pretty bad,
[02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:21.872]  Then you should make a change.
[02:38:21.872 --> 02:38:25.136]  Either read stuff that you think is honest.
[02:38:25.136 --> 02:38:26.257]  You know, get off the habit.
[02:38:26.257 --> 02:38:33.986]  Break the cycle of dependence on the big three networks, on a lot of the corrupt newspapers that people use to get their news.
[02:38:33.986 --> 02:38:37.250]  And go find news sources that are not lying to you.
[02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:39.913]  Or, as you just suggested, start your own.
[02:38:40.453 --> 02:38:41.294]  But do something about it.
[02:38:41.294 --> 02:38:41.994]  Don't be passive.
[02:38:41.994 --> 02:38:42.835]  I agree with that.
[02:38:42.835 --> 02:38:43.715]  Absolutely.
[02:38:43.715 --> 02:38:44.316]  Absolutely.
[02:38:44.316 --> 02:38:48.979]  I mean, the shock to me is not that the legacy media are collapsing.
[02:38:48.979 --> 02:38:49.739]  Of course they aren't.
[02:38:49.739 --> 02:38:52.701]  They're terrible, and their business model is unsustainable.
[02:38:52.701 --> 02:38:56.484]  What's shocking to me is that anybody goes there, that anybody's still watching.
[02:38:56.484 --> 02:38:59.686]  Like, the Today Show, yes, it's no longer number one in the morning.
[02:39:00.273 --> 02:39:01.734]  But it still exists!
[02:39:01.734 --> 02:39:03.676]  Who would watch something like that?
[02:39:03.676 --> 02:39:08.260]  I mean, it's not only propaganda, it's stupid and patronizing.
[02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:09.421]  So why does it have any audience?
[02:39:09.421 --> 02:39:10.862]  That's what I find distressing.
[02:39:10.862 --> 02:39:14.505]  I just hope people will move on and go to something new.
[02:39:14.505 --> 02:39:15.626]  That's part of my question.
[02:39:15.626 --> 02:39:20.331]  What I was really getting at is we don't just have the jury box, the grand jury box, and the voting box.
[02:39:21.443 --> 02:39:37.232]  We have voting with our dollars and voting with our action, and we're so close that if people out there really start doubling down to educate someone every week, to tell somebody about our websites every day, to put us on their Facebook, their Twitter, we're so close.
[02:39:37.232 --> 02:39:46.817]  They've got Zuckerberg and Google and everybody trying to kill the libertarian upsurge because they know we're coffin nails to their vampiric system.
[02:39:46.817 --> 02:39:48.798]  We're high noon to Count Dracula.
[02:39:49.498 --> 02:39:56.968]  And so folks, do you agree that it's key for folks to really support?
[02:39:56.968 --> 02:39:58.110]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:39:59.028 --> 02:40:03.773]  And it's key in general to be mindful about where you spend your money.
[02:40:03.773 --> 02:40:05.975]  Is it consistent with what you believe?
[02:40:05.975 --> 02:40:13.202]  I don't think you should politicize everything, and not every purchase is a political act, but I do think it's worth being thoughtful about it.
[02:40:13.202 --> 02:40:14.243]  Absolutely.
[02:40:14.243 --> 02:40:21.771]  If I can, when I spend my money, if I can spend it on something that advances ideas that I believe, that I think are true, that I think make people's lives better,
[02:40:22.291 --> 02:40:22.651]  I do it.
[02:40:22.651 --> 02:40:26.154]  I mean, I live in the District of Columbia, about 100 yards from the state of Maryland.
[02:40:26.154 --> 02:40:28.675]  There's a gas station right across the border.
[02:40:28.675 --> 02:40:30.056]  I don't go there.
[02:40:30.056 --> 02:40:32.237]  Because I don't agree with how the state of Maryland is run.
[02:40:32.237 --> 02:40:33.418]  I probably buy gas cheaper there.
[02:40:33.418 --> 02:40:34.058]  I don't.
[02:40:34.058 --> 02:40:36.020]  I don't patronize it.
[02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:39.262]  Because I don't want to give money to people I disagree with.
[02:40:39.262 --> 02:40:49.188]  And by contrast, like most people, I shop at places where I know the ownership and like them and approve of what they're doing, and I don't think your behavior online should be any different.
[02:40:50.151 --> 02:40:51.311]  And that's our real power.
[02:40:51.311 --> 02:40:53.672]  The system's trying to take that away from us.
[02:40:53.672 --> 02:40:57.753]  If we look at what Obama's doing with Cloward and Piven, they want us to go to the company store.
[02:40:57.753 --> 02:41:04.874]  They want us to go to the Soviet gulag, basically, and get our sausages and get our nylons.
[02:41:04.874 --> 02:41:06.195]  I just don't think that's going to work.
[02:41:06.195 --> 02:41:13.736]  Getting back into the election, how big a factor do you think election fraud is going to be with illegals getting caught voting everywhere?
[02:41:13.736 --> 02:41:17.417]  Here is a clip, I'm sure you saw it, probably talked about it on Fox News.
[02:41:17.657 --> 02:41:18.838]  I can say one thing before I forget.
[02:41:18.838 --> 02:41:21.200]  I just love your riff on McDonald's.
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:25.123]  I hate to say that, but I agree with you completely.
[02:41:25.123 --> 02:41:27.005]  I've never heard anybody say that before.
[02:41:27.005 --> 02:41:30.428]  I don't listen enough, obviously, but I totally agree with you.
[02:41:30.428 --> 02:41:33.510]  Well, thank you, but I'm not just picking on them.
[02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:39.295]  It's just that garbage, low-quality food, we need to just move away from it.
[02:41:39.295 --> 02:41:39.736]  I agree.
[02:41:39.736 --> 02:41:45.621]  I didn't used to agree with that, and I've gotten older, and I completely agree with you.
[02:41:46.474 --> 02:41:51.196]  Well, McDonald's didn't eat... When I was a kid, McDonald's hamburgers were greasy and beef and tasted good.
[02:41:51.196 --> 02:41:53.658]  Now it's like alien Martian food or something.
[02:41:53.658 --> 02:41:58.500]  I want to play this clip of Obama last week where I think he's hinting for people to vote repeatedly.
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:01.322]  But regardless of that's what he's doing, that's what's going on.
[02:42:01.322 --> 02:42:02.802]  Let's play the clip.
[02:42:02.802 --> 02:42:09.926]  And because early voting runs through this Friday, you don't have to wait till Election Day.
[02:42:09.926 --> 02:42:12.487]  You can vote all week.
[02:42:12.487 --> 02:42:13.648]  I mean, you can only vote once.
[02:42:16.085 --> 02:42:22.328]  It's in Chicago now.
[02:42:22.328 --> 02:42:24.789]  I'm teasing Chicago, I'm messing with you.
[02:42:24.789 --> 02:42:26.110]  Yeah, he's messing with us.
[02:42:26.110 --> 02:42:30.372]  What do you make of that statement and then what do you make of the real world evidence of fraud coming up?
[02:42:31.462 --> 02:42:34.024]  Well, there's an awful lot of fraud.
[02:42:34.024 --> 02:42:37.848]  And a lot of it, amazingly, nobody seems to care about.
[02:42:37.848 --> 02:42:45.874]  I mean, let me just make the obvious point that there's no justification for opposing voter ID laws except to abet voter fraud.
[02:42:45.874 --> 02:42:47.716]  Sorry, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:42:47.716 --> 02:42:50.879]  The idea that it's racist to ask for a driver's license, really?
[02:42:50.879 --> 02:42:53.401]  Then driver's licenses themselves are racist.
[02:42:53.741 --> 02:42:58.325]  Black Americans can't get access to driver's licenses, then why are we requiring one to drive a car?
[02:42:58.325 --> 02:42:59.746]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense at all.
[02:42:59.746 --> 02:43:06.472]  The only reason that you're opposing that is because you want more fraudulent voting, because you know it benefits Democrats, which it does overwhelmingly.
[02:43:06.472 --> 02:43:13.037]  But we also know that in the 2008 election, hundreds of thousands of non-citizens voted illegally.
[02:43:13.037 --> 02:43:14.078]  Hundreds of thousands.
[02:43:14.078 --> 02:43:14.519]  Maybe 700,000 voted.
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:19.202]  And so that's an almost definitive number.
[02:43:19.202 --> 02:43:21.864]  That's high enough that you can affect election outcomes.
[02:43:21.864 --> 02:43:26.547]  So there's no debate, really, among people who care enough to learn that it's happening.
[02:43:26.547 --> 02:43:29.890]  The debate is only between those who care about it and those who don't.
[02:43:31.221 --> 02:43:40.463]  What would the Democrats do if Republicans started going and getting the voter rolls of folks that hadn't voted in a while and started going in and voting fraudulently?
[02:43:40.463 --> 02:43:41.543]  How would they like that?
[02:43:41.543 --> 02:43:54.285]  See, why is it, and I'm not saying we should cheat, but why is it that Libertarians and Conservatives rarely cheat and with Democrats, they even have studies on fake environmentalists, they're like six times more likely to steal, to not be charitable.
[02:43:54.285 --> 02:43:58.846]  I'm just so sick of watching them run around and act corrupt while shaking their finger at us.
[02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:00.744]  Well, that's true.
[02:44:00.744 --> 02:44:05.688]  I mean, moral superiority is a huge part of the liberal program.
[02:44:05.688 --> 02:44:15.238]  So the idea is not only to amass power and then wield it, in other words, get the ability to tell other people what to do and make them live a certain way, but also feel virtuous while you do it.
[02:44:16.239 --> 02:44:19.623]  That has always been the part of liberalism that makes me sickest.
[02:44:19.623 --> 02:44:20.564]  The sanctimony.
[02:44:20.564 --> 02:44:31.358]  I mean, isn't it enough that you're bossing me around, making me wear a seatbelt, forcing me to put out my cigarette, taking half of my take-home pay in taxes, then you have to lecture me and call me names?
[02:44:31.958 --> 02:44:34.220]  And say, well, you know, you're not a working person.
[02:44:34.220 --> 02:44:34.980]  Really?
[02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:36.501]  Because I work an awful lot.
[02:44:36.501 --> 02:44:37.942]  Like, you're lecturing me?
[02:44:37.942 --> 02:44:38.863]  What is that about?
[02:45:02.739 --> 02:45:07.423]  Who is totally cut off from the reality of life in America.
[02:45:07.423 --> 02:45:11.407]  I mean, I don't think she has any idea where jobs come from, never having created one.
[02:45:11.407 --> 02:45:14.009]  I mean, she's all about command and control.
[02:45:14.009 --> 02:45:16.151]  And by the way, not even in an interesting way.
[02:45:16.151 --> 02:45:20.695]  Let's, you know, in one sentence, listen to the next Hillary Clinton speech that you can.
[02:45:20.695 --> 02:45:24.258]  And you'll, the first thing you'll notice is how totally banal she is.
[02:45:27.827 --> 02:45:28.627]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:45:28.627 --> 02:45:29.687]  I mean, I'm interrupting.
[02:45:29.687 --> 02:45:32.428]  She sounds like a broken robot or something.
[02:45:32.428 --> 02:45:33.708]  Totally unappealing.
[02:45:33.708 --> 02:45:34.608]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:45:34.608 --> 02:45:37.189]  I think there are a lot worse people in American politics than Hillary.
[02:45:37.189 --> 02:45:39.389]  Like, I don't wake up in the morning wishing her ill.
[02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:40.630]  I don't hate her.
[02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:42.330]  But she's just not impressive.
[02:45:42.330 --> 02:45:43.790]  And nobody says that out loud.
[02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:45.311]  You know, I think she's pretty tough.
[02:45:45.311 --> 02:45:45.591]  Okay, great.
[02:45:45.591 --> 02:45:47.411]  There are a lot of tough people in this world.
[02:45:47.411 --> 02:45:48.791]  You know, hard people.
[02:45:48.791 --> 02:45:51.612]  But she's not had an original idea ever.
[02:45:51.612 --> 02:45:55.473]  And I've watched her since I was at the newspaper in Arkansas more than 20 years ago.
[02:45:55.473 --> 02:45:56.733]  She's just not interesting.
[02:45:56.733 --> 02:45:57.093]  Period.
[02:45:58.646 --> 02:46:03.429]  Well, you're a very nice man to not say that you don't hate her, but I mean, come on.
[02:46:03.429 --> 02:46:05.430]  You can say that a trash can is tough.
[02:46:05.430 --> 02:46:10.054]  She is just... Why can't we get rid of Clintons and Bushes?
[02:46:10.054 --> 02:46:11.775]  I totally agree with that.
[02:46:11.775 --> 02:46:13.376]  320 million people in this country.
[02:46:13.376 --> 02:46:15.777]  Let's talk about the need for diversity.
[02:46:15.777 --> 02:46:17.078]  We're always yapping about diversity.
[02:46:17.078 --> 02:46:18.699]  How about some political diversity?
[02:46:18.699 --> 02:46:25.624]  I mean, I think, by the way, the founders were really worried, as you know better than anybody, they were really on guard against the very human impulse
[02:46:26.124 --> 02:46:28.185]  To worship temporal authority.
[02:46:28.185 --> 02:46:32.508]  They didn't want a dictator because they knew that the people, in many cases, want a dictator.
[02:46:32.508 --> 02:46:34.550]  They want a king.
[02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:40.413]  And the founders basically set up all these systems to prevent us from getting what we really want, which is a king.
[02:46:40.413 --> 02:46:47.678]  And we've kind of gone around all their safeguards and are setting up, we're not setting up a king, but we're, you're seeing this human impulse at work here.
[02:46:47.678 --> 02:46:49.839]  We want to keep rewarding people from the same families.
[02:46:49.839 --> 02:46:50.500]  Why are we doing this?
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:56.545]  Well, that's like the Israelites wanted a king, and God didn't want to give them one, and they finally got Saul.
[02:46:56.545 --> 02:46:59.347]  It's the same story, it just doesn't end well.
[02:46:59.347 --> 02:47:00.047]  It's so sad.
[02:47:00.047 --> 02:47:07.993]  I want to go to a few phone calls here, and then after you leave us in overdrive, I'm going to premiere that James O'Keefe piece, and then we've got the full interview coming up tonight.
[02:47:07.993 --> 02:47:11.897]  But first off, Mary in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with Tucker Carlson.
[02:47:11.897 --> 02:47:12.177]  Go ahead.
[02:47:13.905 --> 02:47:22.111]  Hi Alex, I have to apologize because I wanted to depart from the topic of the election for a moment because there's something I've always wanted to ask of Tucker Carlson.
[02:47:22.111 --> 02:47:33.018]  And I just wanted to say that the Daily Caller website is really an aberration in conservative media in terms of the disrespect towards women that it has on its website.
[02:47:33.018 --> 02:47:37.021]  It's essentially in a race to the bottom with the left with its policy of contributing to
[02:47:42.104 --> 02:47:49.249]  I mean, are you one of these people that thinks they should ban the statue of the sailor on the victory over Japan, kissing the woman?
[02:47:49.249 --> 02:47:50.690]  Because they're banning that everywhere.
[02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:52.231]  I mean, are you joking?
[02:47:52.231 --> 02:47:59.617]  I don't think anybody accuses Daily Caller of... I think Tucker gets accused of being almost too liberal sometimes.
[02:47:59.617 --> 02:48:01.138]  Now you're saying he's attacking women?
[02:48:01.138 --> 02:48:03.639]  He is being a man, period, attacking women.
[02:48:06.297 --> 02:48:07.238]  Well, what's wrong with that?
[02:48:26.517 --> 02:48:36.266]  There's nothing wrong with a woman in a swimsuit and look that's what advertisers have in their ads.
[02:48:36.266 --> 02:48:38.608]  Ma'am are you upset when you see a woman in a bathing suit on CNN?
[02:48:44.995 --> 02:48:52.720]  I would also say, by the way, we do surveys on this, if this makes you feel any better.
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:49:01.506]  Our female readers are some of the biggest consumers, the biggest repeat readers of our slideshows.
[02:49:01.506 --> 02:49:04.267]  Oh yeah, it's the women that are looking at it.
[02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:04.828]  Come on.
[02:49:06.778 --> 02:49:08.079]  Cosmopolitan Magazine.
[02:49:08.079 --> 02:49:15.207]  It's obviously geared toward women and it's filled with pictures of naked women that are much, much saucier than anything you'll find on our site.
[02:49:15.207 --> 02:49:16.428]  But no, we're not embarrassed about it.
[02:49:16.428 --> 02:49:18.050]  Listen, man, I appreciate your call, but I'm going to be honest.
[02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:24.217]  I think that was a seminar caller and I never say that, but I really do think that was just a cheap shot by some writer.
[02:49:24.217 --> 02:49:25.198]  It was pretty funny.
[02:49:25.558 --> 02:49:27.419]  Well, but I mean, give me a break.
[02:49:27.419 --> 02:49:33.861]  You guys have occasional slides on the sides of like, you know, a woman on a surfboard or something.
[02:49:33.861 --> 02:49:39.103]  I mean, I'm just... Notice how the left is like a cult, though.
[02:49:39.103 --> 02:49:45.346]  Like we're in some weird cult and we're about to be burned at the stake because you have Marilyn Monroe on your website.
[02:49:45.566 --> 02:49:46.787]  Well, they're all very uptight.
[02:49:46.787 --> 02:49:55.833]  I mean, we're happy to do a slideshow on the women of the IDF, for example, because it's hilarious and it's funny and interesting and whatever.
[02:49:55.833 --> 02:49:58.474]  We mean it in a very light-hearted way.
[02:49:58.474 --> 02:50:01.577]  There's nothing serious or creepy about it at all.
[02:50:01.577 --> 02:50:06.320]  And I just don't believe that things that are meant in good faith and as
[02:50:08.001 --> 02:50:14.864]  By the way, I have looked at the slideshow of the women of the IDF and think that they're very nice looking.
[02:50:14.864 --> 02:50:16.225]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:50:16.225 --> 02:50:17.565]  They certainly are!
[02:50:17.565 --> 02:50:18.786]  It's awesome!
[02:50:18.786 --> 02:50:19.847]  And it's funny!
[02:50:19.847 --> 02:50:21.347]  I mean, it's a riot!
[02:50:21.347 --> 02:50:25.229]  Every Yom Kippur, we do an IDF slideshow and it makes me laugh every year.
[02:50:25.229 --> 02:50:26.870]  People are offended by it.
[02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:28.311]  I think they're in a small minority.
[02:50:28.311 --> 02:50:30.652]  Yeah, lady, I don't think you're a regular listener.
[02:50:30.652 --> 02:50:33.694]  We've got more Tucker Carlson questions ahead.
[02:50:33.694 --> 02:50:35.415]  A preacher in Texas wants to talk to him.
[02:50:36.275 --> 02:50:39.518]  Just don't show slideshows of guys in underwear.
[02:50:39.518 --> 02:50:40.799]  Don't show that.
[02:50:40.799 --> 02:50:43.281]  Now that, I agree, is sexist, and I'm against it.
[02:50:43.281 --> 02:50:44.982]  We would never do that, ever.
[02:50:44.982 --> 02:50:47.824]  Don't, Tucker, or I'm going to quit reading it.
[02:50:47.824 --> 02:50:50.106]  I want to see.
[02:50:50.106 --> 02:50:51.187]  That's what I like, though.
[02:50:51.187 --> 02:50:53.909]  I like Marilyn Monroe, women in bathing suits.
[02:50:53.909 --> 02:50:57.372]  There's nothing wrong with celebrating feminine beauty.
[02:50:57.372 --> 02:50:58.773]  I just do not apologize for it.

[02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:17.210]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[02:51:17.210 --> 02:51:21.913]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[02:51:29.858 --> 02:51:32.939]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[02:51:32.939 --> 02:51:34.720]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:37.201]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[02:51:37.201 --> 02:51:38.802]  And your rights are at risk.
[02:51:38.802 --> 02:51:43.163]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[02:51:43.163 --> 02:51:45.344]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[02:51:45.344 --> 02:51:48.446]  We offer the most affordable Level 3 body armor on the market.

[02:51:57.829 --> 02:51:58.670]  Come and take it.
[02:51:59.270 --> 02:52:02.113]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:02.113 --> 02:52:07.217]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:07.217 --> 02:52:15.345]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:15.345 --> 02:52:19.889]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:19.889 --> 02:52:23.672]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:23.832 --> 02:52:29.776]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:29.776 --> 02:52:32.958]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:32.958 --> 02:52:38.322]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:52:38.322 --> 02:52:46.507]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:52:46.507 --> 02:52:46.687]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:52:53.732 --> 02:52:54.213]  We're good to go.
[02:52:59.525 --> 02:53:00.545]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:53:00.545 --> 02:53:06.048]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:53:06.048 --> 02:53:06.608]  I get it.
[02:53:06.608 --> 02:53:16.192]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:53:16.192 --> 02:53:17.592]  That's not what's happening.
[02:53:17.592 --> 02:53:26.056]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:53:26.056 --> 02:53:29.277]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:53:29.417 --> 02:53:33.658]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:53:33.658 --> 02:53:35.258]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:53:35.258 --> 02:53:39.219]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:53:39.219 --> 02:53:43.000]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:43.921]  You should, too.
[02:53:43.921 --> 02:53:45.061]  Find out what they know.
[02:53:45.061 --> 02:53:48.362]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:53:48.362 --> 02:53:48.422]  800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.422 --> 02:53:48.762]  800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.762 --> 02:53:48.942]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:54:06.332 --> 02:54:08.793]  Well, David Bowie said it, this is not America.
[02:54:08.793 --> 02:54:14.934]  This is collectivism, and it's collapsed every country that ever got involved with it.
[02:54:14.934 --> 02:54:20.476]  Hand out a bunch of free stuff for a while, and then government descends into gangs and counter gangs.
[02:54:20.476 --> 02:54:21.916]  Finishing up here with Tucker Carlson.
[02:54:21.916 --> 02:54:28.338]  We'll be back tonight, six hours, live, with a bunch of taped interviews and other things so we can take breaks, but it's gonna be powerful.
[02:54:28.338 --> 02:54:29.198]  The entire news team...
[02:54:30.399 --> 02:54:34.001]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, free video links.
[02:54:34.001 --> 02:54:36.101]  They're taking the show right now, so you can just go find it.
[02:54:36.101 --> 02:54:37.862]  We're going to be hosting out of the new studio.
[02:54:37.862 --> 02:54:40.503]  We're going to be hosting the radio show full-time soon.
[02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:44.685]  So we're launching everything here in just the next few months, years in the making.
[02:54:44.685 --> 02:54:50.688]  So see us here tonight, 6 o'clock Central, 7 o'clock Eastern, PrisonPlanet.tv and more.
[02:54:50.688 --> 02:54:53.929]  Also free audio feeds as well, InfoWars.com.
[02:54:53.929 --> 02:54:56.190]  Tucker Carlson, I want to take a few final calls from Preacher.
[02:54:56.850 --> 02:55:00.692]  Uh, Cory and a couple others that are holding, or not Cory, whoever's next up.
[02:55:00.692 --> 02:55:03.634]  But, do you think the Republicans will take the Senate?
[02:55:03.634 --> 02:55:07.336]  A and B, do you think they'll then try to reverse Obamacare?
[02:55:07.336 --> 02:55:10.798]  And C, will they get removed from office if they don't reverse Obamacare?
[02:55:11.622 --> 02:55:16.704]  Um, that is exactly the sequence of events that's most likely to occur.
[02:55:16.704 --> 02:55:17.824]  A, I'm not sure.
[02:55:17.824 --> 02:55:26.427]  I think, of course, the odds are in favor of the Republicans taking the Senate tonight, or in January when the recount in Georgia is done.
[02:55:26.427 --> 02:55:29.607]  But I'm not, you know, I wouldn't bet my house on it, actually.
[02:55:31.829 --> 02:55:37.075]  The numbers are pretty really confusing, but yeah, if I had to bet, I guess I would bet a limited amount of money that they'll win.
[02:55:37.075 --> 02:55:45.966]  No, they will not try to overturn Obamacare, because they don't think they can, and they don't think that it's politically popular to do so, and they won't.
[02:55:45.966 --> 02:55:49.831]  And yes, they will wind up disappointing a lot of their voters, because they always do.
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:55.063]  But people are getting fed up with him.
[02:55:55.063 --> 02:56:02.992]  I see a Tea Party takeover of the Republicans if they don't change over to our way, which is just basic survival.
[02:56:02.992 --> 02:56:11.381]  Yeah, I mean, look, the candidates who... I mean, the most popular senator in the United States, there's only one senator right now who's running unopposed, and that's Jeff Sessions of Alabama.
[02:56:12.310 --> 02:56:14.632]  And Jeff Sessions is not a good speaker.
[02:56:14.632 --> 02:56:16.893]  Jeff Sessions is not super charismatic.
[02:56:16.893 --> 02:56:18.054]  He doesn't pander to people.
[02:56:18.054 --> 02:56:22.877]  The only reason Jeff Sessions is truly the most popular person in the state of Alabama is because he's really principled.
[02:56:22.877 --> 02:56:23.918]  He says exactly what he thinks.
[02:56:23.918 --> 02:56:24.879]  He doesn't lie.
[02:56:24.879 --> 02:56:26.040]  And people like that.
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:27.200]  I think there's a market for that.
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:31.824]  I actually think you can get elected and keep your job if you are an honest man.
[02:56:32.364 --> 02:56:34.246]  Look at Ron Paul, another example.
[02:56:34.246 --> 02:56:34.967]  Exactly!
[02:56:34.967 --> 02:56:35.367]  Exactly!
[02:56:35.367 --> 02:56:38.650]  Talk about a guy... I mean, I've been to a lot of Ron Paul speeches.
[02:56:38.650 --> 02:56:44.536]  Ron Paul is one of the least inspiring speakers ever, and yet he inspires all these people.
[02:56:44.536 --> 02:56:44.776]  Why?
[02:56:44.776 --> 02:56:49.061]  Because you know when Ron Paul talks, whether you agree or not, he's being totally sincere.
[02:56:49.061 --> 02:56:50.002]  Integrity!
[02:56:50.002 --> 02:56:51.043]  Integrity!
[02:56:51.043 --> 02:56:53.605]  Let's talk to a preacher in Texas.
[02:56:53.605 --> 02:56:55.127]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Tucker Carlson.
[02:56:56.089 --> 02:56:56.650]  Hello, Alex.
[02:56:56.650 --> 02:57:04.238]  First of all, I want to thank you for all you do to get the information out to take down these people who are trying to oppress us.
[02:57:04.238 --> 02:57:12.027]  Second, Tucker, I am a follower of yours on Daily Caller, and I appreciate the work you do on Fox News.
[02:57:12.027 --> 02:57:12.627]  Oh, thanks a lot.
[02:57:13.704 --> 02:57:14.385]  Uh, yeah.
[02:57:14.385 --> 02:57:28.715]  Hey, I wanted to bring up a story that you put out on Daily Caller today I thought was pretty interesting that kind of shows the racism of the Obama family and that's Michelle going out and telling voters to go vote Democrat and then go have a piece of fried chicken.
[02:57:28.715 --> 02:57:30.056]  Now, is that not racist?
[02:57:31.249 --> 02:57:33.110]  Well, I don't know what the hell she was talking about.
[02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:45.013]  I mean, first of all, I mean, it sounds like part of a stereotype-laden joke, A. B, isn't that a direct violation of her Eat Kale for Breakfast program or something?
[02:57:45.013 --> 02:57:52.695]  Every time I see her, she's like eating the most fattening foods, and then the stuff she wants our kids to eat looks like rat feed or something.
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:58.842]  I mean, I couldn't even begin to decode what she said.
[02:57:58.842 --> 02:58:06.846]  I will say, my one sentence on Michelle Obama I've been thinking about all day is, here she's campaigning much more than Barack Obama, but you're not allowed to criticize her.
[02:58:06.846 --> 02:58:13.189]  She's a full-on political figure used by the Democratic Party to get votes for their candidates, but it's somehow out of bounds for you to say anything about it.
[02:58:13.189 --> 02:58:15.911]  Well, that's like saying, you know, she's a woman and she's black, so it's a double
[02:58:16.311 --> 02:58:17.031]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:02.443 --> 02:59:09.528]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:59:09.588 --> 02:59:10.209]  We're good to go.
[02:59:27.051 --> 02:59:29.674]  Fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[02:59:29.674 --> 02:59:40.485]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[02:59:54.943 --> 02:59:56.484]  You are!
[02:59:56.484 --> 03:00:01.507]  And here's our interview, more of it coming up tonight, with James O'Keefe of Project Veritas.
[03:00:01.507 --> 03:00:06.271]  Tell us where you are, what was going on, and what led you to this particular report.
[03:00:06.271 --> 03:00:19.380]  We're in the area surrounding Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, and we walked into these poll precinct locations and simply said the names of inactive voters and they told us, they offered us ballots
[03:00:20.020 --> 03:00:29.563]  We did this a total of about 20 times, and everyone offered us a ballot except one, and that person asked to see my driver's license, which is against the rules.
[03:00:29.563 --> 03:00:30.863]  You're not allowed to ask for ID.
[03:00:30.863 --> 03:00:35.044]  But when they did ask for ID, I was unable to get a ballot.
[03:00:35.044 --> 03:00:37.085]  I was unable to get someone else's ballot.
[03:00:37.085 --> 03:00:39.766]  So we demonstrated that in-person voter fraud is possible.
[03:00:40.726 --> 03:00:48.993]  This comes on the heels of a report we did last week where a worker was fired, a campaign worker was fired, for telling us to vote for non-citizens.
[03:00:48.993 --> 03:00:59.061]  And this comes two weeks after, in Colorado, a worker was fired for telling us to go dumpster diving for ballots of African Americans to vote in their names.
[03:00:59.061 --> 03:01:03.644]  So we really have done a big series on voter fraud, and it's having an impact on these races.
[03:01:03.644 --> 03:01:04.825]  But you demonstrate it perfectly.
[03:01:04.825 --> 03:01:07.427]  You can go vote as people who are even deceased.
[03:01:07.427 --> 03:01:07.928]  Is that correct?
[03:01:09.008 --> 03:01:17.970]  Yeah, I mean, anyone whose name is on the rolls, you could walk right up to the poll location, state their name, state their address, and you can get offered their ballot.
[03:01:17.970 --> 03:01:19.130]  You just have to sign the form.
[03:01:19.130 --> 03:01:23.091]  We didn't actually sign any forms because that would be a felony.
[03:01:23.091 --> 03:01:24.491]  But it is possible.
[03:01:24.491 --> 03:01:26.812]  There's 700,000 inactive voters.
[03:01:26.812 --> 03:01:32.953]  There's over 1,000 people in North Carolina who are registered to vote who are non-citizens.
[03:01:32.953 --> 03:01:36.934]  So this stuff is entirely possible and the elections are so close.
[03:01:36.934 --> 03:01:37.814]  It could make a difference.
[03:01:38.672 --> 03:01:43.119]  And when we talk about this voter fraud, it doesn't even have to be somebody who's necessarily not going to vote.
[03:01:43.119 --> 03:01:45.943]  Could it just be a circumstance where you get to the polls before they do?
[03:01:47.607 --> 03:01:49.808]  Very well could be, and many people don't vote.
[03:01:49.808 --> 03:02:04.456]  In Colorado, in the mail-in ballots, almost half or one-third of those ballots are thrown away or discarded, and one of the officials in the video says, yeah, you should go fill those ballots out, fill in those mail-in ballots.
[03:02:04.456 --> 03:02:11.020]  All you gotta do is checkmark someone's name and forge their signature, and congratulations, you're voting on somebody else's name.
[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:13.641]  It's possible.
[03:02:13.641 --> 03:02:16.262]  The Board of Elections is now investigating.
[03:02:16.262 --> 03:02:17.422]  It's really a simple ruse.
[03:02:17.422 --> 03:02:18.182]  We've done it before.
[03:02:18.182 --> 03:02:21.263]  We got offered Eric Holder's ballot two years ago.
[03:02:21.263 --> 03:02:28.546]  We went into Eric Holder's precinct and walked right up to the Attorney General, where he votes, and the poll worker said, here you go, Mr. Holder.
[03:02:28.546 --> 03:02:33.228]  And of course, we weren't Eric Holder, but they assumed we were because there's no photo ID.
[03:02:33.228 --> 03:02:38.750]  And then after we did this, they actually had a picture of Eric Holder put on his poll location.
[03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:39.270]  Are you serious?
[03:02:41.449 --> 03:02:45.071]  So they verified identity for Eric Holder, but nobody else.
[03:02:45.071 --> 03:02:46.012]  Yeah, I remember that one.
[03:02:46.012 --> 03:02:48.794]  You guys were like, I'll be back faster than you can say furious.
[03:02:48.794 --> 03:02:51.697]  But you know, it just shows how easy this thing is to manipulate.
[03:02:51.697 --> 03:02:53.738]  And people would say, you know, they try to criticize it.
[03:02:53.738 --> 03:02:55.840]  Well, you're showing people how to illegally vote.
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:02:59.623]  These people already know if they want to participate in these actions, how to do it.
[03:02:59.623 --> 03:03:05.427]  Because you don't, in the jurisdictions you're going to, you don't need a voter ID like you do here in the state of Texas.
[03:03:05.427 --> 03:03:06.988]  So let me ask you this.
[03:03:06.988 --> 03:03:08.870]  At any point, what surprised you the most?
[03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:16.156]  Was there a situation where you said, well, no, we're not going to get away with it this time, or just something happened that you didn't expect to happen at all?
[03:03:16.156 --> 03:03:20.260]  Well, the shock was, you know, there's a couple funny anecdotes.
[03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:34.852]  One time I was doing this in one of the areas, I believe it was Durham or Cary, North Carolina, and I was standing right in front of a sheriff or a police officer, and he stood there right behind me as I was doing this ruse.
[03:03:34.852 --> 03:03:36.594]  Of course, I wasn't breaking any laws, but
[03:03:37.034 --> 03:03:39.855]  There's always the presumption they arrest you and ask questions later.
[03:03:39.855 --> 03:03:47.319]  And the police officer had his hands on the side of his body and he was, it looked like, I basically said to myself, I'm pretty much screwed.
[03:03:47.319 --> 03:03:49.540]  He's gonna arrest me the moment I turn around.
[03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:54.783]  So I turn around, I get offered this ballot and I say, well, let me go out to the car and I'll be back.
[03:03:54.783 --> 03:03:56.904]  That was my excuse for getting out of the location.
[03:03:57.304 --> 03:03:57.564]  I don't know.
[03:04:12.782 --> 03:04:14.083]  What's the rule that she broke?
[03:04:14.083 --> 03:04:15.183]  That just simply asking for a photo ID?
[03:04:32.898 --> 03:04:37.801]  In North Carolina in 2014, you do not need to show a driver's license.
[03:04:37.801 --> 03:04:42.403]  And in some of the cases when we said, oh, you know, I would say, oh, do you need to see my driver's license?
[03:04:42.403 --> 03:04:48.646]  They would, almost like when you show garlic to a vampire, they would, they would jump back and say, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:48.646 --> 03:04:50.267]  I don't, I don't, I can't see your ID.
[03:04:50.267 --> 03:04:51.668]  I can't see your ID.
[03:04:51.668 --> 03:04:57.131]  So the notion that someone actually asked for ID is wrong.
[03:04:57.131 --> 03:04:59.652]  In the state of North Carolina, you're not allowed to do that.
