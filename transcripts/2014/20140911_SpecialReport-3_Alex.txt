[00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:14.310]  I am standing in Times Square, New York City, which is apparently the number one terror target, according to the online ISIS Jihadi magazine.
[00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.855]  Now, they've listed a number of target threats across the United States, as well as the globe.
[00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:25.880]  Don't forget, we've got 11 missing planes that could do any number of things with that, but this
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.881]  We're good to go.
[00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.664]  Coming up on the 13th anniversary of the 9-11 terror attacks.
[00:00:54.005 --> 00:01:02.730]  Now, this year's ceremony is going to be a little bit different because the Mayor's office and Mayor Bill de Blasio at City Hall, they're not going to be in charge of this ceremony.
[00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.831]  Guess who is?
[00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:14.177]  Now, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his top aides have been in control of this ceremony for the last 13 years, ever since terrorists toppled the two towers
[00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:15.977]  All those years ago.
[00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:33.301]  Well, just before he left office, he made sure to relinquish the control of this ceremony over to the 9-11 Memorial Museum and World Trade Center Foundation, of which he is the chairman.
[00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.902]  Now, we all know about Bloomberg.
[00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:36.502]  He is the ultimate nanny.
[00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:41.123]  He wants to control the size of soda that people here in New York can drink.
[00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:46.245]  He wants to control how the people of New York City can exercise their Second Amendment.
[00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:55.209]  So of course, he wants to make sure that he can continue exercising control over the official narrative surrounding 9-11.
[00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.532]  Now one of the ways he's going to do that is by controlling who has access to the plaza.
[00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:03.335]  This year, it's going to be closed off to the public.
[00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:11.804]  The only people who will be invited in are family members of the victims of 9-11, as well as politicians who've been invited in years past.
[00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:12.685]  That's it.
[00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.150]  Not on the invite list once again this year, and it's a source of
[00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.033]  Protests, basically, are the first responders.
[00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:23.495]  The first responders are not invited.
[00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:37.525]  Shouldn't this be a ceremony to not only remember the fallen of 9-11, but also those who risked their lives as first responders who were able to save so many more lives because of them putting themselves on the line.
[00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.126]  These people are not invited.
[00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:47.594]  Is that because Bloomberg is concerned that they're gonna cause a ruckus saying, well, what about all those explosions that we heard there on 9-11?
[00:02:47.614 --> 00:02:55.180]  It wasn't just the two planes hitting the towers, but all those anomalies surrounding the boom, boom, boom, as the firefighters described it.
[00:02:56.141 --> 00:03:05.448]  Also, could they be there to just draw attention to the fact that the health care that they had to fight for more than a decade to receive is about to run out?
[00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:06.108]  That's right.
[00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:08.930]  They were just granted this health care in 2010.
[00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.692]  It's about to run out 2014, 2015.
[00:03:13.553 --> 00:03:25.021]  Obviously, these are very hotly contested issues here, just along issues like the border, which as we have shown you many times, is wide open.
[00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:33.769]  Joe Biggs dressed up as an ISIS jihadist, bringing a head with him across the border.
[00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.211]  It's wide open.
[00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.473]  We are vulnerable to a terror attack.
[00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:41.376]  These are the things that they do not want you to see.
[00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.538]  These are the things that they want to control.
[00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.500]  This is the message they don't want to get out.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.062]  They want you to see what they want you to see.
[00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:52.106]  But that is not what we are going to bring you here at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:56.049]  We are going to bring you what they don't want to show you behind the scenes.
[00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:04.755]  Hopefully we're going to be speaking with some of those first responders, getting their take, seeing how they feel about being forced outside of the plaza.
[00:04:05.055 --> 00:04:09.979]  They risked their lives that day, and they're not even invited to the official ceremony.
[00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.481]  But we'll be right there, right there on the front lines.
[00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:16.824]  This is Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
