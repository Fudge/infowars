[00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:06.528]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com here right outside of Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:16.697]  Now so far what we know is schools on Friday sent the children home with extra homework just in case that the grand jury decision is released tomorrow.
[00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:23.083]  So they're expecting schools to be shut down in case it happens, if violence erupts throughout St.
[00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:23.923]  Louis and that area.
[00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:25.705]  So they're preparing for that in that way.
[00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.107]  We know that gun sales at some stores have gone up.
[00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:49.143]  One in particular we went to yesterday was the Metro Shooting Supply and their sales have gone up 300% and a lot of people who are buying from what I was told by the owner were actual Sheriff's Department family members who are buying up weapons because they are scared of the retaliation that will happen after what we all kind of think is going to happen.
[00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:57.248]  That Darren Wilson will be not charged with murdering Mike Brown and essentially allowed to go back to duty.
[00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:03.271]  Another thing as well is the social media chatter so far that I've seen on Twitter.
[00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:05.753]  A lot of people are saying prepare for war.
[00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:11.016]  A lot of the businesses, Jakari showed you when we initially got here, where they were trying to board them up.
[00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:15.619]  A few of the comments I've seen is, alright if you board your windows up, guess what we're going to do?
[00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.680]  We're just going to burn the entire building down.
[00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:22.864]  Right now, it's no longer a protest from what I'm being told.
[00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:35.435]  All the people who are the activists, the protesters, they're saying it's now a revolution, and that is what's going on here in Ferguson, and they're expecting it to spread through Atlanta, Chicago, New York, L.A., and eventually worldwide.
[00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:53.448]  Another thing, I got intel today as well, a Navy vet in Chesterville, Missouri was working at the Jury Inn and Thursday he was going into work, got in the parking garage and took some pictures because most people would see what he saw and think that's pretty suspicious, there's something up.
[00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:58.172]  What he saw was tons and tons of Department of Homeland Security vehicles parked there.
[00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:02.275]  He took pictures, took a video and posted it on Facebook on Thursday.
[00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:05.838]  Friday he was called into work and he was told to take them down
[00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:10.478]  Saturday he was called into work and told, hey, you're fired.
[00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:13.721]  You know, Department of Homeland Security came to us.
[00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:15.022]  We're going to be fined for this.
[00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:15.943]  You broke.
[00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:19.166]  Apparently they had a contract and didn't tell the workers that.
[00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:26.433]  They didn't trickle that information down, but they're getting fined for essentially leaking secret information about all that.
[00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:29.676]  So, you know, we have this hotbed here in Ferguson.
[00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.558]  We've got DHS surrounding the area.
[00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:34.801]  We know that there's 2,000 police officers on call for this.
[00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.524]  There's military in the area, National Guards at the airport.
[00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:42.507]  The past few weeks they've been seeing Apache helicopters flying overhead.
[00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:51.754]  And based off all this information, it goes down to tomorrow, Monday afternoon, we're expecting the grand jury decision to come out.
[00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:58.380]  And like I said, it looks like it's going to be in favor of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Michael Brown.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:10.327]  And it's going to erupt and there's going to be riots I assume and from what a lot of the people are saying is that they think it's going to be 10 times worse than the riots in LA after the Rodney King incident.
[00:03:10.747 --> 00:03:22.014]  So Jakari Jackson and I will be here live streaming tomorrow and putting up YouTube reports so make sure you go to the Alex Jones channel for our YouTube videos and continue to watch our updates on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:24.896]  Once again, I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
