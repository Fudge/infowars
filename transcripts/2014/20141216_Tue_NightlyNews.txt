[00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.433]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:25.577]  It's Tuesday, December 16th, 2014 and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:26.938]  Here is what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:35.748]  A Washington State Sheriff defends his deputy's controversial comments.
[00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.872]  Then, your social media activity factors in to your threat score.
[00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:45.496]  And, a new poll shows Americans want fewer gun restrictions.
[00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:49.819]  That's next, on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.925]  Anybody that's got a head on their shoulders is working to try to fix things politically while arming to the teeth and getting ready.
[00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:13.317]  Well you'll recall that yesterday we showed you shocking video that was provided exclusively to InfoWars showing a Washington State Sheriff's Deputy on camera saying that officers need all those MRAP vehicles because it was pesky
[00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:16.219]  Constitutionalists with firearms.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:29.191]  Now the video prompted thousands of comments and a nine-minute video response from Sheriff Ozzy Knezovich in which he claims that the video was being taken out of context.
[00:01:31.397 --> 00:01:46.913]  Today I'm here to talk to you a little bit about a Infant Wars report that states that Spokane County deputies stated that we need a armored personnel vehicle to deal with constitutionalists that have
[00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:49.602]  Stockpiled ammunition.
[00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:10.808]  That report in and of itself is very misleading.
[00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:35.984]  What you haven't been told is a particular interview started by a lady filming deputies at a charity function that were working with the MRAP and her whole contention was that we were trying to desensitize children to the fact that we had
[00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:37.445]  I think.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.903]  Because we are engaged in real journalism here.
[00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:02.985]  We go wherever the truth leads us.
[00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:07.868]  Now we've seen a long slide towards a paramilitary police state in this country.
[00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:13.971]  I've been talking about it for a long time, made four films on the subject since the late 1990s, and we are now here.
[00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:17.974]  They've gone from denying that this is happening to admitting it.
[00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:28.099]  The Department of Homeland Security is working with law enforcement to build a domestic army because the federal government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.363]  And don't forget, the FBI, the DHS, and the nation's police departments, they are being trained that we are the enemy.
[00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:41.807]  And look, I've got here a Department of Justice Constitutionalist Extremist Guide right here in my hand.
[00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:43.248]  This was published by the DOJ.
[00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.904]  And it says to look out for American citizens who are members of the Patriot Movement.
[00:03:52.945 --> 00:04:05.974]  This is a training manual that's titled Investigating Terrorism and Criminal Extremism, published by the DOJ, complete with terms and concepts to help recognize potential extremists.
[00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:09.677]  I'm going to read some of their bullet points, and you're not going to believe this.
[00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:13.360]  This is what they consider to be extremist speech.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:25.069]  Anyone who talks about black helicopters, well they are obviously prone to conspiracy theory beliefs and they should be monitored and considered a threat, according to the DOJ.
[00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:31.394]  If you talk about the Bilderberg Group, or the Trilateral Commission, or the CFR, you are a threat.
[00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:36.737]  Anyone who talks about the Illuminati or the New World Order, well, you're a threat.
[00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:45.664]  And if you stockpile food, water, and weapons, you might be an extremist, according to the United States Department of Justice.
[00:04:46.363 --> 00:05:03.311]  So rather than apologize for the comments made by his deputy, the sheriff essentially blames InfoWars for daring to report on this story and saying that this video was taken out of context, that the quote was taken out of context, even though it speaks for itself.
[00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:05.972]  The video in its entirety speaks for itself.
[00:05:06.092 --> 00:05:08.073]  He said exactly what he meant.
[00:05:08.113 --> 00:05:09.514]  There was no way to spin that.
[00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:10.754]  We let him say what he said.
[00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:19.941]  So joining me now is Washington State Republican Representative Matthew Shea, who was appalled when he was presented with this video.
[00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:29.949]  What did you think when you saw the initial video with the sheriff deputy saying that they needed these armored military vehicles to deal with constitutionalists with firearms?
[00:05:30.712 --> 00:05:31.673]  Absolutely appalling.
[00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:35.134]  It was actually unbelievable that somebody would say that on camera.
[00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:38.876]  And immediately I looked at the whole video.
[00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:42.077]  It's very clear that this is in context.
[00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:47.060]  In fact, I don't even know a context or a situation where such a statement would ever be justified.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.802]  So it was very appalling to me and to all of our community here in Spokane Valley, Washington.
[00:05:52.302 --> 00:06:05.672]  A lot of people are up in arms right now and asking the sheriff what on earth he is thinking and what his policies are that would lead a deputy to be so comfortable saying that in a public place like that and what he's going to do about it.
[00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:19.094]  Right, especially considering a lot of the backlash that deputies are facing just being on camera, being filmed by citizens to hear, to just so casually be able to offer up that as a response.
[00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:30.241]  And then of course you saw the nine minute video response there by Sheriff Knezevich and basically saying it was all taken out of context, we're fear mongering.
[00:06:30.721 --> 00:06:32.302]  What did you think about his response?
[00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:34.656]  Well, this is the smoking gun.
[00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:47.503]  Senator Rand Paul here just a couple weeks ago actually called out the people administering the grant program that sends these armored vehicles down to local law enforcement and asked the question, then, why do you need bayonets?
[00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:50.024]  Why do local law enforcement need bayonets?
[00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:52.585]  Give me one instance where they could use those things.
[00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:53.886]  And I think that that's what
[00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:57.869]  This particular individual, when they interviewed the deputy, was asking the same question.
[00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:02.052]  And the question has to be answered by him, not by the public.
[00:07:02.392 --> 00:07:14.280]  He's the one that has to defend why he's against being a constitutionalist, being against somebody that loves the rule of law, that loves the Constitution, being against somebody that believes that the Constitution means what it says.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.361]  He's got to defend that.
[00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:20.165]  And his deflection, which is what that nine-minute video was, was really kind of
[00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:31.028]  What he does here in Spokane County is a long pattern of behavior of bullying and intimidation and that's really the way it came across to me and many other elected officials out here in Spokane Valley.
[00:07:32.308 --> 00:07:34.349]  And this has larger implications.
[00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:48.493]  What do you think is the broader implications for this militarization of the police and this kind of mentality that they seem to be getting this training to fear veterans and fear those who are constitutionalists and
[00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:51.984]  I fear Americans exercising their Second Amendment right.
[00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:54.335]  Well, they want us to self-censor.
[00:07:54.395 --> 00:08:01.100]  I mean, that's the worst form of tyranny when we're so afraid to say anything or do anything that we self-censor.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.284]  And the MIAC report that came out here a few years ago, I mean, I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:08:06.424 --> 00:08:07.785]  I believe in the Constitution.
[00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:08.645]  I love it.
[00:08:09.025 --> 00:08:11.567]  I served my country in combat as a veteran.
[00:08:11.887 --> 00:08:12.708]  I'm pro-life.
[00:08:12.808 --> 00:08:13.469]  I'm pro-gun.
[00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:14.709]  I supported Ron Paul.
[00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.971]  So suddenly I'm on a list.
[00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:19.733]  And what's very startling about this particular share
[00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:19.973]  I think?
[00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:46.277]  I think that anytime we have somebody that is saying innocent citizens that have done nothing else other than love the Constitution are somehow the enemy, we don't live in a free country anymore.
[00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:49.982]  And when that is allowed to stand, then tyranny gets a foothold.
[00:08:50.182 --> 00:09:16.083]  I think that that's one of the reasons there's been such this great public outcry here in Spokane Valley, Washington, why there's going to be a protest in front of the sheriff's office this weekend, and why he needs to take action to do, I think, the right thing, which would be to apologize to the citizens, do some remedial constitutional rights classes, establish a citizen board to oversee the deployment of that MRAP, or even better yet, get rid of it and send it back.
[00:09:16.683 --> 00:09:18.845]  And also, to me, with the people he's a
[00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:19.205]  Thank you.
[00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:33.075]  Absolutely.
[00:09:33.576 --> 00:09:48.604]  Do you see any legislation or anything coming from just what we've learned in recent months about the 1033 program and just how outspoken they're being about what this military equipment is actually going to be used for?
[00:09:49.693 --> 00:09:50.434]  Well, we are.
[00:09:50.574 --> 00:09:52.916]  There's a group of Liberty legislators in Washington State.
[00:09:52.936 --> 00:09:58.381]  We have something called the Freedom Agenda, and we're working very closely together right now to address this situation.
[00:09:58.842 --> 00:10:01.724]  And I want to highlight one other thing that happened in October.
[00:10:01.764 --> 00:10:09.011]  Actually, October 20, 2014, our sheriff had a closing statement at the Central Valley High School Government Club debate, and here's what he said.
[00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:10.673]  This is an exact transcription.
[00:10:10.813 --> 00:10:14.296]  Quote, I, with the strike of a pen, can affect your freedom.
[00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:17.679]  I can also take your life in certain circumstances.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.681]  That is an alarming attitude.
[00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:29.730]  So I think that regardless of what legislation we introduce, we have got to change the attitude back to what it originally was, and that's being a peace officer instead of a law enforcement officer.
[00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:36.856]  And I think if that happens, we won't be having these discussions about MRAPs being used against constitutionalists anywhere in America.
[00:10:37.489 --> 00:10:42.912]  My goodness, that is absolutely chilling quote that you read, and that is the mentality.
[00:10:43.332 --> 00:10:53.538]  They are given a license to kill, and yet we see them again and again being able to get away with it, not being indicted because of this blue privilege.
[00:10:53.598 --> 00:10:55.619]  Representative, thank you so much for your time.
[00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.320]  Thank you for meeting with us last minute.
[00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.542]  Anything else we need to know about the protests?
[00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:02.003]  I know they're planned for this Saturday.
[00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:06.037]  This Saturday in front of the Valley Sheriff's Office at about two o'clock.
[00:11:06.597 --> 00:11:08.879]  And so far the response has been overwhelming.
[00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:10.840]  So I expect a very good turnout there.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.182]  A lot of elected officials are talking about attending as well.
[00:11:13.242 --> 00:11:19.447]  So I think this is a broad rejection and repudiation of how the sheriff is handling this entire situation.
[00:11:19.787 --> 00:11:20.308]  Absolutely.
[00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:21.969]  Well, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:22.709]  We'll speak soon.
[00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.553]  So, should you be concerned if you're not one of those armed constitutionalists?
[00:11:28.953 --> 00:11:29.594]  Well, yes.
[00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:35.638]  Considering that the police are now shooting people just because they feel threatened, what does that even mean?
[00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:37.799]  How do you even measure a threat level?
[00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:47.045]  Well, now police are using a new application that combs through all of your social media posts to determine your threat level.
[00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:52.370]  Law enforcement authorities have utilized an application called Beware since 2012.
[00:11:53.512 --> 00:12:01.461]  It takes just seconds to crawl billions of records in commercial and public databases to assign a threat rating to an individual.
[00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:02.862]  I think so.
[00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:32.148]  This has red flags everywhere.
[00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:39.355]  Not only is this setting up a society for pre-crime, but there's all sorts of opportunities for this to fail.
[00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:47.002]  What if the system doesn't update if a person moves out of their home and a new person with a different threat level moves into that home?
[00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:47.643]  We've already seen
[00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:57.589]  SWAT teams throw a flashbang grenade into the crib of baby Boo Boo because they didn't realize that a baby was in the home.
[00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:10.117]  They did that mistakenly and they got off scot-free when they threw a flashbang grenade into a crib that blew a hole in a baby's chest and face and put scars all over his body.
[00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:16.822]  So of course something like that could happen if they're using this to determine someone's threat level and it's not updated.
[00:13:17.322 --> 00:13:24.771]  And of course, if you get pulled over, now cops are going to be able to assess your threat level before they even step out of the vehicle.
[00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:32.680]  So this just gives us another reason to worry about being scared by a trigger-happy, too-scared cop.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.544]  But what also constitutes an offensive or threatening post online, people have been in jail for posting rap lyrics.
[00:13:42.064 --> 00:13:44.865]  So this is all, it's incredibly chilling.
[00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:50.908]  And the sheriff saying that constitutionalists are the biggest threat to America really doesn't fly.
[00:13:51.568 --> 00:14:05.160]  With the facts and the reality that Americans are nine times more likely to be shot by police officers than terrorists, and 5,000 people have been killed by police officers since 9-11.
[00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:13.288]  Now, according to a recent PBS poll, an overwhelming majority of Americans now favor gun rights.
[00:14:13.848 --> 00:14:15.730]  And this was a poll that was run by PBS
[00:14:17.031 --> 00:14:21.914]  The government funded PBS, might I say, and this was on the two-year anniversary of Sandy Hook.
[00:14:22.555 --> 00:14:33.642]  And basically they pumped readers full with pro-gun control statistics and then asked people whether they would like these similar gun control policies in their state.
[00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:37.304]  And of course they were probably shocked at the overwhelming response.
[00:14:37.324 --> 00:14:38.525]  95% of respondents believe that.
[00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:48.432]  Laws like this will unnecessarily punish lawful gun owners and will do little to prevent mass shootings.
[00:14:48.712 --> 00:14:50.334]  That was 79,000 votes out of a total of 83,000.
[00:14:50.414 --> 00:14:52.235]  So Americans can see the writing on the wall.
[00:14:56.198 --> 00:15:10.193]  Even when they're faced with irrefutable proof, their own sheriffs on camera admitting that they are gearing up for war with the American people, not for some foreign enemy, even then they want to backpedal and say, oh no, that's not what we meant.
[00:15:10.713 --> 00:15:14.397]  It's kind of like the government and our governmental agencies continuing
[00:15:14.817 --> 00:15:19.120]  To deny the fact that they are engaged in geoengineering.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:35.591]  Now we know many of you have already seen the strange phenomenon in the sky for yourselves, but coming up we're going to be speaking with two women who are investigating some really bizarre spiderweb-like filaments falling from military planes in the sky.
[00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:36.392]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:37.862 --> 00:15:49.005]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.

[00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:45.303]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:49.348]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:55.597]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:16:55.978 --> 00:16:57.440]  Using Super Oxygenation.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.321]  OxyPowder.
[00:16:58.621 --> 00:17:00.464]  Available through Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:01.786]  Gently cleanses the body.
[00:17:01.946 --> 00:17:03.867]  While you sleep with easy capsules.
[00:17:04.187 --> 00:17:09.870]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy-Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:15.592]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[00:17:15.912 --> 00:17:18.253]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:20.254]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[00:17:20.334 --> 00:17:20.895]  I'd say a week.
[00:17:21.055 --> 00:17:21.495]  Seven days.
[00:17:22.616 --> 00:17:23.677]  2015 can be different.
[00:17:23.797 --> 00:17:26.740]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.821]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.
[00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:31.944]  Secure your Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:32.205 --> 00:17:34.066]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:53.815]  For years, people have been trying to sound the alarm on geoengineering, solar radiation management, solar aerosols, chemtrails, whatever you want to call it.
[00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:56.037]  People refuse to talk about it.
[00:17:56.077 --> 00:17:58.519]  They just say it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:00.881]  But now with the internet and the...
[00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:15.132]  The fact that people all have cameras right there on their phones to be able to record these anomalies in real time, it's getting a little bit more difficult for people who refuse to look up into the sky to deny that there's something curious going on.
[00:18:15.732 --> 00:18:17.814]  Well, today we have two guests.
[00:18:18.174 --> 00:18:18.695]  We're good to go.
[00:18:34.557 --> 00:18:34.617]  I'm
[00:19:04.497 --> 00:19:04.577]  Sure.
[00:19:04.597 --> 00:19:07.479]  I happened to be standing outside when I heard an aircraft, very loud, unusual.
[00:19:21.224 --> 00:19:37.312]  And I looked up and coming directly over my property was a large KC-130 that was followed immediately and very close distance by two other planes and it was at a very low elevation so it was very loud.
[00:19:37.872 --> 00:19:41.114]  I happened to have my cell phone in my hand so I clicked it to camera
[00:19:42.054 --> 00:19:44.496]  And didn't even really have time to focus.
[00:19:45.076 --> 00:19:48.298]  I just hope that I got it in a shot of it, which I did.
[00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:51.140]  And that's what I sent to you.
[00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:58.504]  Maria is a friend of mine who lives about eight miles to the northeast, and that was the direction the planes were headed.
[00:19:58.544 --> 00:20:02.547]  So I called her and asked her if she would go outside to see if she could see them.
[00:20:04.273 --> 00:20:05.314]  And she did.
[00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:10.576]  And then within a few minutes, you know, she said, Oh, my, can you see that?
[00:20:10.616 --> 00:20:11.396]  Can you see that?
[00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:15.158]  And I at that time, I didn't know what she was talking about.
[00:20:15.198 --> 00:20:24.242]  And she described that the sky filled with these what to her look like long 50 foot raindrops.
[00:20:25.302 --> 00:20:28.584]  And so within a couple minutes,
[00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:29.808]  I don't
[00:20:47.330 --> 00:21:01.070]  Like a cobweb would look, although you know really long and it the sky filled it persisted for about an hour and these things were catching on all of the the vegetation and the trees and so forth.
[00:21:02.412 --> 00:21:03.293]  So that's how it started.
[00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:04.412]  Right.
[00:21:04.452 --> 00:21:06.373]  So just covering a swath of area.
[00:21:06.454 --> 00:21:13.718]  And you did send me a video that some other geoengineering activists have have dubbed these things chem webs.
[00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:24.446]  And I've noticed some of the pictures are the fibers are a little thicker than what we're seeing there with those filaments that look very much like like spider webs.
[00:21:25.626 --> 00:21:33.772]  Were those just kind of clumped together or was it a different something different that dropped from the planes or a different day or?
[00:21:34.412 --> 00:21:38.840]  No, there were three things happening that day when the sky filled.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.043]  There were the long, shimmery filaments.
[00:21:44.562 --> 00:22:08.292]  Then some of them had were, it would be like a long shimmer with a clump and then long shimmer and then there were some clumps, just plain clumps, kind of like as if you, if you have a pet and sometimes they pull a little bit of cotton batting out of a toy, a little fluff piece, there were some of those floating in the air as well.
[00:22:08.852 --> 00:22:09.072]  Right.
[00:22:09.873 --> 00:22:25.443]  And so Marie, you decided to collect some of these samples and do some testing and you also alerted the news media and you reported that other people also called into the news media to report seeing these fibers floating in the sky.
[00:22:25.463 --> 00:22:26.624]  Yes, yes.
[00:22:27.665 --> 00:22:27.685]  I
[00:22:30.459 --> 00:22:36.422]  After I saw this, these fibers falling, I was worried and I didn't want to touch them with my hand.
[00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:41.745]  Anything that falls from the direction of an aircraft can't be a very good thing to breathe or touch.
[00:22:41.845 --> 00:22:46.928]  So I went in and got some gloves and tried to find a mask, but I couldn't find one.
[00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:48.069]  I went back outside.
[00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:57.514]  I had a white piece of paper and I rolled it up somewhat and I wound the fibers around the piece of paper
[00:22:58.554 --> 00:22:59.494]  Over and over.
[00:23:00.195 --> 00:23:02.656]  These were long fibers.
[00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:07.977]  I couldn't even tell you how many minutes I could have kept winding around the paper.
[00:23:08.538 --> 00:23:10.318]  I had to break the fiber finally.
[00:23:10.338 --> 00:23:17.401]  Wow, so it was kind of like a thicker fiber that didn't just break apart like a spiderweb would, or it was like a thick spiderweb.
[00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:21.122]  It was very sticky and it was very thick.
[00:23:21.362 --> 00:23:21.742]  And long.
[00:23:22.322 --> 00:23:23.023]  Yes, and long.
[00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.950]  Wow.
[00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:34.778]  And I also collected it from the plants, trees, fences, and we had it tested.
[00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:39.002]  The very first thing we did, both of us, did call the EPA.
[00:23:39.682 --> 00:23:50.091]  I did reach, we're in Region 9, where the headquarters are in San Francisco, and the woman there told me, she said, look, because this is happening in real time in Arizona,
[00:23:50.891 --> 00:23:52.112]  You need to call someone closer.
[00:23:52.152 --> 00:23:55.014]  So call Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.
[00:23:55.854 --> 00:24:01.278]  And she gave me an inside name and number, as well as the main number for a backup.
[00:24:01.318 --> 00:24:02.619]  So that's where we started.
[00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:12.325]  And then there were many other calls, many other calls to the FAA, to air traffic control, to legislators.
[00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:16.367]  And then also Marie did contact the media.
[00:24:16.387 --> 00:24:16.447]  Yes.
[00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:22.178]  We contacted 94 members of legislature.
[00:24:22.198 --> 00:24:32.344]  I called probably five different news networks and we did hear back from CBS 5 in Phoenix.
[00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:34.406]  And so where are you with that?
[00:24:34.526 --> 00:24:41.370]  Any word from the EPA or the FAA or any of these politicians, anyone that you were able to get in contact with?
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:57.247]  Leanne, what I would tell you is that this is kind of a typical story of geoengineering where they delicately kind of dance around and we did, I did have a very long conversation with Congressman Gosar's aide.
[00:24:57.728 --> 00:25:02.650]  She was really good and she was going to, you know,
[00:25:03.522 --> 00:25:05.023]  Get in contact with the EPA.
[00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:10.946]  What I can tell you, though, is the story that CBS Channel 5 did really marginalized it.
[00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:21.091]  I asked them to please hold the story until all the facts were in, until our lab tests were returned and so forth, and they chose not to.
[00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:31.636]  So, their story really lacked integrity, and I think you already know that their conclusion, they said that these things were cattle bandages.
[00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:42.221]  That they looked at it under a 40x microscope and an infrared, which matches kind of a chemical signature to their database.
[00:25:43.002 --> 00:25:45.883]  And they said it was flour, gluten, and bacitracin.
[00:25:47.064 --> 00:25:56.949]  That really differs with the tests that we had done at Certified Lab and came back showing high levels of aluminum, barium, and strontium.
[00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:00.701]  Right, I have those lab tests here.
[00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:12.970]  It was just so shocking how completely different these reports were and you did ask them to please hold off on reporting this story until your lab tests could come in as well so you could show them side by side.
[00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.151]  They didn't do that.
[00:26:14.231 --> 00:26:21.136]  They went ahead with what their theory was and they even had a very leading photo in the beginning of the report.
[00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:25.800]  Someone standing in front of a cotton field or like an opening of cotton to already kind of
[00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:30.343]  That predictive programming for whoever's going to watch that report.
[00:26:30.704 --> 00:26:35.748]  Oh, this is what you saw that day when everyone called in and noticed that there were things falling from the sky.
[00:26:35.788 --> 00:26:39.691]  It was just cotton or, you know, just mysterious spider webs.
[00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:46.657]  And then they end the report saying that the theory is that these are dissolvable cattle bandages.
[00:26:47.338 --> 00:26:53.903]  But that's something that is very easily verified because you can just go get some samples from
[00:26:56.265 --> 00:27:09.079]  Yeah, and the other thing is, why would your sky fill with 10 to 20 foot long filaments for an hour's time after three military planes go over and
[00:27:11.817 --> 00:27:12.558]  Possibly.
[00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:15.119]  Possibly think it could be cattle bandages.
[00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:16.580]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:21.944]  The other thing is, there were three other independent eyewitness reports in Phoenix.
[00:27:22.064 --> 00:27:24.866]  We are 100 miles north of Phoenix.
[00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:27.028]  We're a high mountain area.
[00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:28.769]  Our elevation is a mile high.
[00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:31.351]  It's, you know, 5,400 plus feet.
[00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:34.213]  Phoenix is a desert valley.
[00:27:34.813 --> 00:27:36.634]  Their climate doesn't support cattle.
[00:27:38.175 --> 00:27:41.757]  And so they didn't mention that they had three people see the same.
[00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:49.640]  And you know, there are other people around the United States, Europe and Australia that are seeing the same exact things.
[00:27:50.615 --> 00:27:52.916]  Right, we're seeing persistent gaslighting.
[00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:59.818]  You know, it's a persistent gaslighting technique to tell you that you're not seeing what you are actually seeing.
[00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:08.120]  But, I mean, we have the internet now, everyone's got cameras on their phones, and more and more people are actively uploading these things in real time.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.961]  The planes are flying over, you're seeing them falling from the sky.
[00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:14.582]  And, I mean, we can see the video of it.
[00:28:15.262 --> 00:28:18.423]  They're glistening spiderweb-like things everywhere.
[00:28:18.643 --> 00:28:19.563]  I always say, what if?
[00:28:47.985 --> 00:28:50.466]  To the doubters, what if it's real?
[00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:56.327]  What if your children are inhaling these heavy metals?
[00:28:56.627 --> 00:28:59.067]  I just wouldn't take a chance.
[00:28:59.088 --> 00:29:00.148]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:29:00.628 --> 00:29:01.248]  Right, exactly.
[00:29:02.188 --> 00:29:10.310]  We always report on just the dangers of these heavy metals in your food and the dangers for pregnant women or for children who get these things in their vaccines.
[00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.571]  So here they are covering the entire sky or your organic garden.
[00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:17.433]  You know, farm land and everything.
[00:29:17.453 --> 00:29:19.935]  So this is obviously something that affects us all.
[00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:23.658]  Ladies, where can people go to get some more information?
[00:29:23.698 --> 00:29:32.965]  I know you're working on a Facebook page specifically for people who have just more proof to lend to this movement.
[00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:33.826]  Right.
[00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:40.071]  Yes, we're looking for lab tests for blood from the fibers.
[00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:41.892]  Do I have to name the Facebook page?
[00:29:42.052 --> 00:29:42.593]  Oh, go ahead, Cori.
[00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:48.624]  The Facebook page is called Geoengineering Fallout Evidence.
[00:29:49.505 --> 00:29:50.166]  Okay.
[00:29:50.406 --> 00:29:56.191]  We would encourage people to go to that if they have also witnessed this, if they have photographs, if they have lab tests.
[00:29:57.293 --> 00:29:58.954]  Videos would be really helpful.
[00:29:59.975 --> 00:30:04.980]  As a result of doing some of these interviews, other people have contacted us saying that they've seen the same thing.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.100]  Yes.
[00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:18.165]  Most interesting, Leanne, is a woman in Tennessee who has witnessed this for a year and one month in all seasons, she said, including Below Zero.
[00:30:18.885 --> 00:30:24.147]  So she's the one that the video that you saw, you know, it was really good.
[00:30:24.587 --> 00:30:26.868]  It was that was a pretty good capture of what it looks like.
[00:30:28.138 --> 00:30:41.189]  So where we are, you know, yesterday we had a disappointment, not a surprise, but a disappointment where the congressman sent an email of the contact that he had from the EPA saying that the EPA saw the CBS
[00:30:42.205 --> 00:30:47.830]  Report and felt that they could dismiss it, but you know, that was the conclusion.
[00:30:48.171 --> 00:30:55.698]  Can you imagine the EPA is, you know, our they are supposed to be our protection, right?
[00:30:55.858 --> 00:31:06.028]  And the scientists, they should not rely on a, you know, a marginalized mainstream media report.
[00:31:06.673 --> 00:31:07.434]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:18.986]  That doesn't even have a scientist seeing if her theory is correct by getting cattle bandages to see if it's the same material that she's dealing with.
[00:31:19.366 --> 00:31:21.588]  And you can Google geoengineering today.
[00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:23.831]  There's all sorts of articles today.
[00:31:24.531 --> 00:31:26.173]  You can see they're preparing people
[00:31:27.114 --> 00:31:32.936]  For geoengineering, they're saying it's going to be the only thing that's going to help the environment.
[00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:41.540]  It's the only thing that's going to help us with global warming and that they need to start allowing these programs to take place as if they aren't already.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:55.125]  So we see it's it's they know that there's, you know, just too many people that are aware of what is happening and asking questions and aren't going to just believe that random spider webs fall out of planes.
[00:31:55.385 --> 00:31:56.386]  And that's totally normal.
[00:31:57.062 --> 00:31:57.903]  That's correct.
[00:31:58.423 --> 00:32:09.432]  They're conditioning the public to start to become familiar with the term geoengineering or weather modification or solar radiation management.
[00:32:10.213 --> 00:32:14.716]  Like you said, they're not admitting that they've been using these programs since the 40s.
[00:32:14.797 --> 00:32:18.440]  They really amped up in the 90s and the last three years have been horrendous.
[00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:29.245]  They, you know, geoengineering has been causal to a lot of our climate problems, you know, the droughts and the floods and so forth.
[00:32:30.086 --> 00:32:32.591]  And but they're trying to solve this as a fix.
[00:32:34.102 --> 00:32:34.602]  Exactly.
[00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:39.965]  And that's exactly what the BBC reported in November or even just yesterday.
[00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.065]  There's just all these reports.
[00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:43.406]  I've got them pulled up, but that's what they're saying.
[00:32:43.426 --> 00:32:45.667]  This could be harmful to millions of people.
[00:32:45.727 --> 00:32:52.471]  We have no idea what they are putting in the sky or how it's going to affect our natural climate.
[00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:56.914]  Messing with the weather, making clouds brighter, or whatever they're doing.
[00:32:57.475 --> 00:33:02.700]  But the bottom line is, we're quite aware that something is happening and we deserve to know the truth.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:14.651]  We deserve to not be treated like children who are told that our eyes are deceiving us and that, you know, spider webs are now flying planes and making these huge webs across the sky.
[00:33:15.412 --> 00:33:17.154]  Tell me the name again of the Facebook
[00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:18.174]  Thank you.
[00:33:18.194 --> 00:33:19.375]  It's called Geoengineering-Fallout Evidence.
