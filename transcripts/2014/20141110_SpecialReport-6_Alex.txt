[00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.021]  People deserve to know whether the food we're feeding our families has been genetically engineered for heavy pesticides.
[00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.782]  GMO issues won the ballot in multiple states in 2014.
[00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:22.744]  And by genetic modification, I don't mean creating hybrids.
[00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:24.924]  That's been done throughout human history.
[00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.006]  I'm talking about transgenic genetic modification.
[00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:41.991]  Directly manipulating and combining the genes of dissembler organisms or even mixing the genes of plants and animals to create new chimera, new Frankenstein creations.
[00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:55.833]  Bills to let people know if there were genetically modified organisms in their food by requiring GMO labeling were defeated in Colorado 66 to 34 percent and narrowly defeated in Oregon 49.3 percent to 50.7 percent.
[00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:05.878]  In Oregon, 100% of the funding to stop labeling of GMO in food was out of state.
[00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.981]  100% of the funding to stop GMO labeling was from corporations.
[00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.244]  And spending was heavily skewed to keep consumers from knowing what's in their food.
[00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.606]  In Colorado, the spread was 12 million to 7 million.
[00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:20.567]  In Oregon this year, it was 20 million to 9 million.
[00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:24.209]  A year ago in Washington, it was 22 million to 8 million.
[00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:28.412]  In California in 2012, it was 45 million to 9 million.
[00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:38.818]  Monsanto and Big Agra have spent $100 million in just the last two years in just these four states to stop the public from knowing what's in their food.
[00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.556]  As a farmer and a new mom, accurate food labels are important to me.
[00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:45.499]  That's why I'm voting no on 92.
[00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:53.336]  Money spent on propaganda and lies to convince you that GMO is safe and it's too expensive to change a label.
[00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:56.878]  If GMO is so great, then why wouldn't they want you to know?
[00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:59.759]  And why wouldn't they want to feature it on their label?
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.121]  Look at how effective their propaganda is.
[00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.723]  The first poll in Oregon was taken in the summer before the massive propaganda campaign.
[00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:08.364]  77% in favor of labeling and only 12% opposed.
[00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:12.018]  U.S.
[00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:14.621]  food companies already label in 64 countries.
[00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:16.122]  Shouldn't they label here too?
[00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:18.184]  Why can't we have GMO labeling?
[00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:27.794]  We have required labeling of food for many things like artificial flavors and colors, chemical preservatives, fat, oil, the percentages and kinds of fats.
[00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:30.977]  But you can't know if it has GMO.
[00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.792]  There are a couple of forms of certifications now, but it can be confusing.
[00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:48.320]  If we look at the difference between USDA organic certification versus the non-GMO project, non-GMO is cheaper than organic, and some have accused it of blurring the line between organic and non-organic.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.084]  For example, chicken with the non-GMO project label could still have antibiotics and synthetic hormones.
[00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:57.207]  USDA Organic would have neither.
[00:02:57.527 --> 00:03:03.776]  The non-GMO project would also allow pesticides, as long as they're not GMO pesticides, to be sprayed on the crops.
[00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:11.547]  But, on the other hand, USDA Organic doesn't go back as many levels in the certification to see if there is any genetic modification.
[00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:12.949]  Are you confused yet?
[00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:22.794]  Wouldn't it be better if we could just stop the direct manipulation and mixing of the genes of plants and animals in order to create these kind of Frankenstein chimera in the first place?
[00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:26.656]  But that would require banning the practices of Monsanto.
[00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:31.299]  But they have a foothold on the American government and on the political process here.
[00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.480]  It would require defeating them on the ballot.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.561]  Is that impossible?
[00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:35.516]  No.
[00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:42.943]  Although attempts to get GMO labeling at the state and national level has failed, local bans at the county level have been successful.
[00:03:43.383 --> 00:03:46.907]  Before this election, there were already several county bans on growing GMO.
[00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:56.856]  Two counties in Oregon, one county in Washington, four counties and several cities in California were joined by Humboldt County, California, which also passed a ban on Tuesday.
[00:03:57.096 --> 00:03:58.377]  We're not mega farms here.
[00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:05.664]  Our small family farms and pasture-based dairies have a great advantage in the growing market for organic and non-GMO foods.
[00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:11.290]  I don't want to have to tell you that the food I'm raising for you has been cross-pollinated by GMOs.
[00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.615]  You can help our family farms continue to thrive by voting yes on Measure P.
[00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:25.909]  And there was a huge anti-GMO victory in Maui County, Hawaii as part of the 2014 elections.
[00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:34.194]  In spite of Monsanto and Dow spending $8 million, which was a new record for ballot measures in Hawaii, they were defeated.
[00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:36.816]  And by just a thousand votes.
[00:04:37.616 --> 00:04:40.198]  Monsanto outspent the people of Hawaii 87 to 1.
[00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.099]  $300 for every vote they got.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.280]  We're good to go.
[00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:02.897]  It was a ban on GMO farming.
[00:05:03.418 --> 00:05:04.158]  Big difference.
[00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.360]  The citizens part was also a lie.
[00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:11.025]  It was funded solely and exclusively by Monsanto and Dow.
[00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:13.847]  It wasn't a citizens against farming ban.
[00:05:14.408 --> 00:05:18.051]  It was two GMO corporations against a GMO ban.
[00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:19.212]  And they lost.
[00:05:20.151 --> 00:05:23.193]  And there's a lesson there that goes beyond GMO.
[00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:27.136]  Remember, efforts at the national level have fallen on deaf ears.
[00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:30.119]  Multiple state ballot measures have also failed.
[00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.902]  Only the Vermont legislature has passed a GMO label law.
[00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:40.106]  But there have been multiple victories at the county level, stopping GMO at the source.
[00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:42.888]  All politics is local.
[00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:49.674]  We can fight corporate and government intrusion into our lives very successfully at the local level.
[00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:59.400]  When pressed about what the GMO Corporation's Against Banning GMO Farming PAC was doing, their spokesman said, I'm not comfortable describing our campaign activities.
[00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:03.183]  They're also not comfortable describing what they're doing to our food.
[00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.665]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.498]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:30.651]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:34.754]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:39.977]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:46.562]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
