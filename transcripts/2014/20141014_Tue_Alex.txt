[00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:10.746]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:12.327]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:13.888]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:18.071]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:22.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:40.083]  It is Tuesday, the 14th day already of October 2014.
[00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.024]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:57.208]  The editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief, Joel Skousen, is going to join us to talk about geopolitical affairs, the Ebola outbreak, and the most survivable safe areas during a pandemic here in the United States and other parts of the world.
[00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:06.816]  When you're in a car wreck, once it starts, at least in the big car wrecks I've been in, unfortunately, things go into slow motion.
[00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:07.717]  They really do.
[00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:09.978]  You see that in movies, you read about that.
[00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:18.804]  If you've been lucky enough or blessed enough not to be in a really bad car wreck or train wreck or plane crash or something like that, then it's just Hollywood.
[00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:21.886]  But if you've lived it, it's real.
[00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:25.888]  Joe Biggs talked about being in Iraq and being in a huge IED.
[00:01:27.148 --> 00:01:39.758]  That blew the back wheels of their armored vehicle hundreds of yards behind him, seeing pieces of paper and dust drifting past his face in slow motion.
[00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:44.922]  And that's what this is like seeing the clearly.
[00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:52.388]  This morning I was reading over the news and watching CNN to track what they were putting out and it clicked 100%.
[00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:52.828]  This is scripted.
[00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:57.780]  Now, does that mean they released the Ebola to begin with?
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.001]  I don't know.
[00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.122]  They have a history of doing stuff like that, so they're prime suspects.
[00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.824]  What I do know is the response is scripted.
[00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:06.805]  It is a stand-down.
[00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:21.952]  And we've said this a lot already, but it really clicked that we are in the hands of a criminal bureaucracy that sees control of Western governments and major Fortune 100 corporations
[00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:31.675]  That for whatever reason is bringing Ebola here and letting Ebola spread.
[00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:35.977]  And the question we have to ask ourselves is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:02:35.977 --> 00:02:40.379]  Are we going to sit here while they fly more people in than have Ebola?
[00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.882]  And while they allow collapsing, collapsing, not my words, the President of Liberia's words, collapsing countries.
[00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:56.601]  Collapse into the United States because other nations won't take them.
[00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:00.384]  Other nations in Europe and the Middle East and Asia.
[00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:05.689]  Latin America is allowing the flights in and the head of South Com as you know last Monday
[00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:18.471]  Over a week ago now, eight days ago, we played the clip here, came out and said that they think it'll probably get into Central and South America, and if it does, there's gonna be a giant influx to come up here.
[00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:26.799]  So the United States has a big flashing neon sign, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, out front the diner, saying, hey, you're feeling bad, you think you got Ebola?
[00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:41.159]  Well, get on an airplane and come here and vomit and project blood out your rear end and everything else, projectile, diarrhea, all up and down the hallways of these hospitals.
[00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:48.405]  And then the hospital workers and the emergency workers and the police and everybody trying to contain it, they can all get it.
[00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:49.586]  Boy, that's a great idea!
[00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.580]  Just like it's a great idea to shut down most our power plants and double our power prices.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.362]  Just like it's a good idea to say that dads aren't good and break up families with tax incentives.
[00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:07.524]  Just like it's a great idea to give little kids 50-something vaccines by the time they're two years old and see an epidemic of neurological disorders.
[00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:14.486]  No, it's a horrible idea from the perspective of we the people, but it's a great idea from the perspective of the eugenicist
[00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:24.251]  That might as well be humanoid aliens from a distant star system here running our government, setting up a soft kill program to dumb us down and then kill us.
[00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:29.834]  I mean, they might as well be vampires or something from Planet X. They're not!
[00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:34.197]  They're psychopathic, sociopathic guilds working together.
[00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:37.676]  In just a big criminal swarm.
[00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.777]  It's not even really totally coordinated.
[00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:43.578]  They just all work kind of in the same parasitic way.
[00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:46.100]  And you can just see the fall of civilization.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.661]  Mass mental illness spreading like wildfire.
[00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:50.201]  Diseases spreading everywhere.
[00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.063]  I mean, we are a judged country.
[00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:54.143]  Like Pharaoh.
[00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:55.904]  I was thinking about that this morning.
[00:04:55.904 --> 00:04:58.525]  And the judgments that came upon Egypt.
[00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:10.604]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:17.069]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.410]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.512]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:29.377]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:34.161]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:38.944]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:40.265]  Talk about the effects.
[00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:41.766]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:43.708]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:44.809]  I feel like I look better.
[00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:45.529]  I feel better.
[00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:46.590]  I feel sexier.
[00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.551]  I love it.
[00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:50.533]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:55.737]  Consult your physician.

[00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:59.040]  This is life changing.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.042]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:11.287]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:16.710]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.232]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:21.333]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:33.255]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:37.537]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:37.537 --> 00:06:39.318]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:47.181]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.321]  But for how long?
[00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.522]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:06:50.522 --> 00:06:54.964]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:56.824]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:06:56.824 --> 00:06:57.765]  Just won't quit.
[00:06:59.076 --> 00:07:06.239]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.580]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.863]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:13.863 --> 00:07:18.885]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:22.348]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:26.432]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:30.756]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:30.756 --> 00:07:40.986]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:43.509]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:51.897]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:07:51.897 --> 00:07:55.880]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:28.812]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:39.657]  An even bigger issue than the virus Ebola itself, now spreading across the world,
[00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:45.758]  Because standard containment procedures were default turned off.
[00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:49.781]  Not that they tried to put them in place and they failed, they were turned off.
[00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:55.645]  There was a stand down, just like on 9-11.
[00:08:55.645 --> 00:09:03.951]  And there has been a stand down here, and the establishment thinks that we're so stupid, maybe they're right, that they're going to get away with this.
[00:09:05.453 --> 00:09:23.366]  As you know, over the weekend we learned that a nurse at the Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where the first Ebola victim, Patient Zero, died last Wednesday, he really died on Tuesday, they told us about it on Wednesday, had contracted it.
[00:09:24.369 --> 00:09:34.154]  And that at least 70 healthcare workers came in contact with him, not to mention him vomiting all over the apartment, vomiting all over the street, his children still being sent to school.
[00:09:34.154 --> 00:09:47.200]  I'm going to say this again, when they knew he had Ebola, I'll say that slowly, when they knew he had Ebola, at least one of the children was still sent to school.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.122]  Your child's got the flu or a cold, they say, don't go, but, oh, this time, send him
[00:09:53.297 --> 00:09:55.038]  And now, Ebola outbreak.
[00:09:55.038 --> 00:09:59.579]  UN health worker dies in German hospital.
[00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:04.781]  We have a health care worker contracting it from someone they brought in in Spain last week.
[00:10:04.781 --> 00:10:08.502]  And remember, this is a 21 day, 22 day incubation period.
[00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:12.564]  It may have mutated more to even go longer.
[00:10:12.564 --> 00:10:20.606]  And so, we'll really start finding out how many people he infected in about a week.
[00:10:20.606 --> 00:10:22.447]  Because he infects them a few weeks ago,
[00:10:24.192 --> 00:10:29.233]  14 days, 21 days, pops out in another 6, 7, 8 days.
[00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:30.874]  We should have a countdown here.
[00:10:30.874 --> 00:10:33.894]  From my guesstimations, dead reckoning, 6, 7 days.
[00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:34.695]  Get out a calendar!
[00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:42.396]  Hey guys, will you print me off a September, October calendar and then some of the dates of when he came in, when he went to the hospital.
[00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:44.657]  It was two weeks ago he went to the hospital, two and a half weeks ago.
[00:10:45.874 --> 00:10:49.558]  It's checked in the hospital a week and a half ago, dies last Wednesday.
[00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:52.121]  So we're talking two and a half weeks or so, yeah.
[00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:55.505]  I mean, we're talking four, five, six, seven days.
[00:10:55.505 --> 00:11:01.352]  But then they'll probably cover that up and just let those people continue to spread it.
[00:11:01.352 --> 00:11:04.515]  No attempt to track down who was on the airplane he was with or check them.
[00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:05.036]  No attempt.
[00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:09.970]  No attempt now to quarantine the other 70 medical workers.
[00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.252]  They're gonna let them spread it.
[00:11:11.252 --> 00:11:13.554]  And then you know what that means?
[00:11:13.554 --> 00:11:16.998]  It means that it goes viral.
[00:11:16.998 --> 00:11:21.542]  And not viral like your video goes viral for your rock band or your hip-hop group.
[00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:24.585]  The bad kind of viral.
[00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:28.830]  Hundreds of people exposed to him, including children.
[00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:33.750]  Now out there spreading it.
[00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.351]  And you know the bad thing about Ebola?
[00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:39.874]  Most diseases that are in animals aren't in humans.
[00:11:39.874 --> 00:11:45.998]  They don't cross the zoological bridge, as it's called.
[00:11:45.998 --> 00:11:51.682]  Well, Ebola can be carried by your dog or by your cat.
[00:11:51.682 --> 00:11:55.325]  Or pretty much anything else warm-blooded you've got.
[00:11:55.325 --> 00:11:57.887]  So that's another little added goody to it all.
[00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:27.709]  Is that your your animals can give it to stray animals and then it's in the population like it is in Africa where it's in the monkeys and the fruit bats and then it's quasi airborne because the bats fly over and urinate and defecate in the air and the virus lives in that and then you inhale it and you know the compassionate thing to do is going to be
[00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:42.789]  Bringing the children of Latin America, when it starts spreading in Latin America, in ideal conditions, South Com is saying, to come here, over the open border and to show up at the hospitals for the health care.
[00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:46.991]  And then I saw the headline last week, weeks after I pointed this out, it's just common sense.
[00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:50.752]  I just point that out so people don't think that I'm just extrapolating and it's not actually happening.
[00:12:53.677 --> 00:13:04.026]  There was a headline, Ebola in America, good for Obamacare, because it shows a federal response and a federal crisis, and only the feds can organize against it.
[00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:06.688]  Yeah, don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:13:06.688 --> 00:13:12.814]  Gee, you got seven African countries, it was four, then five, then six, now seven, that have Ebola in them.
[00:13:12.814 --> 00:13:17.978]  And Spain, and the US, and looks like they're covering cases up in Australia and other areas.
[00:13:17.978 --> 00:13:20.641]  But let's just say, eight countries right now.
[00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:22.143]  No, no, nine countries.
[00:13:22.143 --> 00:13:25.829]  Seven African, one European, one North American.
[00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:33.102]  So you've got nine, nine countries that we know have it.
[00:13:35.563 --> 00:13:40.425]  And it's all during the flu season with compromised immune systems.
[00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:45.628]  And it's clearly mutated over 300 times in the last six months.
[00:13:45.628 --> 00:13:48.669]  That's the CDC and World Health Organization's own number.
[00:13:48.669 --> 00:13:51.951]  326 times, I think, was the last mutation.
[00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:55.433]  Before, a big old... In years past,
[00:13:56.508 --> 00:14:04.190]  A large Ebola outbreak would be 6 people, 15 people, 21 people.
[00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.771]  That was the previous big one.
[00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:07.931]  Now it's clearly tens of thousands.
[00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:12.932]  They're covering up the numbers, still claiming that it's only 3,000 that have died.
[00:14:12.932 --> 00:14:18.214]  It's hundreds of thousands, if not millions, that have now been in contact with it and contracted it.
[00:14:19.219 --> 00:14:29.481]  And it's spreading and you don't block people out of those countries, day one, like the British and the French and others did almost two months ago.
[00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:46.184]  And then you advertise you're going to leave the flights open so that middle class and wealthy Nigerians who've got it and other folks from Africa, Sierra Leone, can then come over here.
[00:14:47.216 --> 00:14:52.837]  That is a guaranteed recipe to spread Ebola and now it's spread.
[00:14:52.837 --> 00:14:57.498]  And remember, Geraldo Rivera said, how dare you claim immigrants could bring Ebola?
[00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:59.158]  It's impossible.
[00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:01.859]  How dare you say that fish live in the ocean?
[00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.579]  It's preposterous.
[00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:09.820]  How dare you not support Obama's gun control agenda or you're racist?
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.961]  Just do whatever we say, even if it flies in the face of common sense.
[00:15:17.037 --> 00:15:20.901]  But now Southcom admits they think Ebola will probably come across the border.
[00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:24.404]  Now a second person has gotten it in the U.S.
[00:15:24.404 --> 00:15:26.827]  from patient zero.
[00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:33.053]  So the first person is supposedly officially contracted.
[00:15:33.053 --> 00:15:37.237]  And the World Health Organization is predicting 10,000 new Ebola cases per week.
[00:15:38.712 --> 00:15:39.412]  We've got an L.A.
[00:15:39.412 --> 00:15:42.693]  bus driver quarantined after a passenger yells, I have Ebola.
[00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:51.417]  So you're going to have lots of schizophrenics and attention whores running around declaring that they have Ebola.
[00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:58.559]  I think you could get trendies to sign a petition, like we're going to do this here in Austin, and we're going to do it down on the border.
[00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:02.141]  And you have to phrase it right.
[00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:04.942]  Obama, our gracious dear leader,
[00:16:07.486 --> 00:16:18.172]  He wants us to help the world, and as the CDC chief has said, leaving the borders open, letting the flights come in is the way to fight Ebola.
[00:16:18.172 --> 00:16:23.376]  So, shouldn't we all sign a petition to bring the Ebola patients, not just U.S.
[00:16:23.376 --> 00:16:31.941]  citizens, but of the world, to the United States, and to not make them feel ostracized, put them in schools with our children?
[00:16:33.345 --> 00:16:36.487]  And I think the Average Trendy will sign it.
[00:16:36.487 --> 00:16:39.829]  Because self-destruction is their religion.
[00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:43.592]  Failure and collapse is their God.
[00:16:43.592 --> 00:16:46.074]  Now let's go over some of these headlines.
[00:16:46.074 --> 00:16:49.416]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a story for InfoWars.com with video.
[00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:53.359]  Dallas nurse is Ebola airborne now.
[00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:58.022]  Scientific evidence Ebola virus transmitted via infectious aerosol particles.
[00:16:59.648 --> 00:17:15.755]  A three-year nurse at Dallas Presbyterian Hospital told a local television station she fears Ebola may be airborne because another nurse who religiously followed protocols in a hazmat suit still got it.
[00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:17.715]  That's what a lot of other top scientists are saying.
[00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:21.137]  We, of course, have been criticized for publishing those reports linked to the CDC.
[00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:27.509]  We've been attacked by the mainstream media for actually reporting facts, which is a badge of honor.
[00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:29.911]  Please keep throwing me in that briar patch.
[00:17:29.911 --> 00:17:30.571]  Most U.S.
[00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:34.214]  hospitals cannot safely handle Ebola patients.
[00:17:34.214 --> 00:17:37.436]  Another story, breaking that down on Infowars.com.
[00:17:37.436 --> 00:17:42.860]  Sick passengers on Boston flight prompt Ebola scare hazmat crews on scene.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.922]  So even bigger than the virus itself,
[00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:56.831]  Is the hysteria, that's what I meant to get to at the start of the segment, even bigger than the deaths, which are tragic, is the fear in the economy this is going to cause?
[00:17:56.831 --> 00:18:12.237]  And could they use, as I predicted before this happened, a bioweapon release as the pretext to smokescreen a worldwide economic collapse, blaming it on that, not the end of the fiat fractional reserve banking derivatives market?
[00:18:13.422 --> 00:18:20.204]  Another headline, AP, Ebola patient cared for by 70 hospital staffers.
[00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:26.245]  World Health Organization says Ebola is modern era's worst health emergency.
[00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:30.546]  Ebola epidemic has killed more than 4,000 people, they now say.
[00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:32.527]  Guaranteed much higher than that.
[00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:37.028]  Ebola camps, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, by Steve Watson.
[00:18:38.012 --> 00:18:41.397]  Fox Analyst calls for quarantine camps in every city.
[00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:41.837]  That's right.
[00:18:41.837 --> 00:18:43.340]  Don't control the border.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.601]  Don't stop the flights.
[00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:48.106]  Let it start spreading.
[00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:54.815]  And then lock up anybody who looks like they're a little bit sick with a bunch of people with Ebola, ensuring it spreads.
[00:18:56.027 --> 00:18:58.128]  I told you months ago that's what they do.
[00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:06.454]  Because whatever the most evil, evil out of control policy is to make the crisis as bad as possible, this political class will do it.
[00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:11.718]  It's how they operate, it's what their mindset is.
[00:19:11.718 --> 00:19:13.499]  So there's some of those headlines.
[00:19:13.499 --> 00:19:15.360]  Let me continue with the headlines.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.543]  After telling you it's no big deal, there's no crisis, there's no problem, CDC urges all U.S.
[00:19:20.543 --> 00:19:25.166]  hospitals to think Ebola and to get ready to respond to it after they brought them in.
[00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:25.547]  That's AP.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:34.124]  World Health Organization again says Ebola is modern era's worst health emergency.
[00:19:34.124 --> 00:19:35.786]  Just thought I would throw that out there.
[00:19:35.786 --> 00:19:47.754]  They let it get out of control and now it's going to give the UN and the federal government and all these central agencies more power when they openly say they want to reduce world population.
[00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:49.435]  We've got more on Ebola coming up.
[00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:58.470]  We will return and get to all the latest and some other news I haven't gotten to, cover some other news and fire out the number.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:02.667]  The human body is extraordinary.
[00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:06.849]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[00:20:06.849 --> 00:20:12.172]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon hardened body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:09.290]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.674]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:18.793]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:21:18.793 --> 00:21:20.895]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:21:20.895 --> 00:21:24.179]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:25.421]  Children left with no homes.
[00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:27.263]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:21:27.263 --> 00:21:30.107]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:30.887]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:04.082]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:14.670]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:30.724]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell our 30-day non-GMO emergency food supply for only $99 as long as we can.

[00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:02.292]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:23:02.292 --> 00:23:04.073]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:23:04.073 --> 00:23:06.554]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:23:06.554 --> 00:23:08.155]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:23:08.155 --> 00:23:12.516]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.

[00:24:10.179 --> 00:24:10.699]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:12.080]  Central.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.044]  We're here live back weeknight 7 o'clock Central.
[00:24:18.044 --> 00:24:19.165]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:19.165 --> 00:24:22.627]  The news websites again are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:26.161 --> 00:24:48.849]  The panic that is going to ensue out of Ebola being allowed to come to this country and spread is clearly engineered, clearly contrived, so Obama can put executive orders in, shutting down more power plants, going after the Second Amendment, putting our troops under NATO command outside Congress, launching more wars to support ISIS.
[00:24:48.849 --> 00:24:49.950]  That's in the news today.
[00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.571]  Turkish airstrikes hit Kurds, not ISIS.
[00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:55.639]  Turkey wants ISIS to conquer Syria.
[00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:57.480]  Yeah, they armed him to begin with.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.141]  North Korean leader has reappeared in public.
[00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:02.902]  That's some of the news that's coming up.
[00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:09.885]  But the United States and the whole world is sitting on top of a derivatives and a devalued currency bubble.
[00:25:09.885 --> 00:25:22.311]  And I've always said they could use a global pandemic outbreak, whether real or manufactured or exacerbated, or a large regional war as the political cover to implode the world economy.
[00:25:27.873 --> 00:25:39.385]  At this point, statistically, maybe 200-300 people have come in contact with patient zero.
[00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:45.170]  As they become infectious, let's say half of them become infectious, that's a high number.
[00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.633]  But let's just say half of them become infectious, that's 100-150 people.
[00:25:51.252 --> 00:26:03.455]  If they don't get instantly quarantined or allowed to run around and spread it, then you're talking 300, 400, 500 that end up getting it, and then thousands, and then tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, and then millions.
[00:26:03.455 --> 00:26:14.058]  And if it gets to the tens of thousands that end up having Ebola, with the way this country's been trained to panic and hide under the table, if the media shows us Osama Bin Laden sock puppet on TV,
[00:26:15.442 --> 00:26:26.131]  It will bring industry and schools and commerce to a standstill of panic.
[00:26:26.131 --> 00:26:29.913]  And then the CDC will roll out Obamacare.
[00:26:29.913 --> 00:26:35.718]  Who would have thought federalization of healthcare would have helped coordinate it and bring the epidemic under control?
[00:26:35.718 --> 00:26:37.980]  That's the type of quote she'll hear.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.422]  Because if they put real operations into place,
[00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.631]  That they should have done on a micro scale.
[00:26:43.631 --> 00:26:46.432]  On a large scale, it will end up stopping it.
[00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:56.535]  And now they've set up the model of medical tyranny and Obama's expanded executive order about disappearing anyone with a respiratory illness.
[00:26:56.535 --> 00:27:10.280]  That's why they have the headline out today that is so incredibly important in Bloomberg, where top scientists and others are very, very, very, very upset
[00:27:12.287 --> 00:27:18.330]  And are saying you should have had separate medical facilities to hold Ebola patients.
[00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.391]  You should have never brought Ebola patients here to begin with.
[00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:24.593]  And the medical workers have to be in full spacesuits.
[00:27:24.593 --> 00:27:28.694]  And you have BioShield government level 4 facilities.
[00:27:28.694 --> 00:27:35.978]  And so now they're saying they're going to take people to level 4 facilities and build camps around them.
[00:27:35.978 --> 00:27:38.659]  But they had to first let it get going, see.
[00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:41.190]  And so it's in the news.
[00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:49.816]  Oh, the CDC didn't follow its protocol by accident, but now they are, and they're re-looking at it, and they're building these emergency centers for you.
[00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:50.476]  Oh!
[00:27:50.476 --> 00:28:03.465]  But they're gonna keep the flights coming in to prime the pump as Africa, large areas of Africa, collapses with people piling onto the aircraft to come here.
[00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:04.586]  Until it gets out of hand.
[00:28:06.223 --> 00:28:11.446]  And they're going to have checkpoints with cops with thermometers, digital thermometers, scanning your faces.
[00:28:11.446 --> 00:28:12.887]  The cops are going to be in masks.
[00:28:12.887 --> 00:28:14.889]  They're going to be getting it.
[00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:18.051]  All because the criminals that run our government brought it here.
[00:28:18.051 --> 00:28:24.555]  And you're going to have the media saying, people were down on Obama at first, but his response to it, he looked like a great leader.
[00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:30.539]  Look at him in a hazmat suit visiting people at the Ebola camp in New Jersey.
[00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:31.880]  He's got a lot of courage.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.561]  Well, it's his dedication.
[00:28:34.835 --> 00:28:37.816]  Sally, back to you.
[00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:49.920]  I mean, you can see the whole stinking rollout of this scripted event and it makes me want to throw up.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:29:03.325]  Truly, truly insane that they would allow this to get to that point and only now come out and talk about
[00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:11.624]  Putting in the default procedures.
[00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:30.611]  But if they would have put the default procedures two months ago, like Europe did, and like the Arab countries did, this wouldn't have happened and we couldn't have had this non-citizen from Nigeria with a fever, vomiting, flying back to the US to try to go to the hospital to get treatment.
[00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:32.672]  And our healthcare system is so hopelessly broken
[00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:36.125]  I've had them try this with my kids before.
[00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:44.608]  They've got a bacteria or I mean they've got a virus and they try to give them antibiotics for a bacteria when they have a virus.
[00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:47.509]  They don't even test them to see if you have a virus or a bacteria.
[00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:49.049]  They just give you antibiotics.
[00:29:49.049 --> 00:29:51.710]  And then Jesse Jackson says it's racist.
[00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.510]  No.
[00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.191]  It's our screwed up system.
[00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:58.892]  I'm going to find that Bloomberg article here and come back with that because I can't find it.
[00:30:00.513 --> 00:30:10.157]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[00:30:10.157 --> 00:30:20.102]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:20.102 --> 00:30:23.023]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:23.223 --> 00:30:23.844]  I think so.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.440]  We're good.
[00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:09.406]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:09.406 --> 00:31:17.812]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:17.812 --> 00:31:22.695]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:22.695 --> 00:31:29.340]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:36.649]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:43.678]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:43.678 --> 00:31:48.023]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:31:48.143 --> 00:31:51.526]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:31:51.526 --> 00:31:57.831]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:31:57.831 --> 00:32:00.273]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.273 --> 00:32:03.795]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:12.042]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:12.042 --> 00:32:17.046]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:32:17.446 --> 00:32:19.951]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:32:19.951 --> 00:32:22.075]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:32:30.376 --> 00:32:34.017]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:34.017 --> 00:32:38.299]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:40.099]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:47.942]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:47.942 --> 00:32:49.082]  But for how long?
[00:32:49.082 --> 00:32:55.724]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:58.545]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:33:03.917 --> 00:33:05.779]  We are on the march.
[00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:08.941]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:18.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:22.473]  I'm going to be very candid and frank with you.
[00:33:22.473 --> 00:33:28.217]  I don't want to sound to be honest with you because I'm always honest with the audience.
[00:33:28.217 --> 00:33:30.940]  But sometimes I hold back the full truth
[00:33:32.475 --> 00:33:35.498]  Because I don't want to be alarmist.
[00:33:35.498 --> 00:33:43.946]  But I am so angry right now that I am beyond even physically showing it.
[00:33:43.946 --> 00:33:46.869]  I am so sick of our criminal government.
[00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:52.354]  I am so sick of the criminal special interest that would burn the country down if it gave them more power.
[00:33:54.659 --> 00:34:08.652]  And I am so sick of the compartmentalization where you can't even really hate the average big corporation, or the average police officer, or the average bureaucrat, because they're just compartmentalized and know less than we do.
[00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:10.314]  They're not part of it.
[00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:21.144]  It's how big and complex the world is, allows these con artists, and these crisis creators, these wreckers, these vultures,
[00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.813]  To literally sabotage and screw our society over.
[00:34:26.813 --> 00:34:33.517]  30 years ago, if there was an FAA air traffic disaster, people were fired.
[00:34:33.517 --> 00:34:37.580]  And if it happened again, they would fire the head of the FAA.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:46.665]  In third world countries, if a dam broke and killed people, they would fire the head of the dam and sometimes arrest them.
[00:34:46.665 --> 00:34:47.046]  Now,
[00:34:48.612 --> 00:34:51.714]  When there's melamine in the milk in the U.S., nobody gets in trouble.
[00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:55.376]  They execute people in China for that.
[00:34:55.376 --> 00:35:07.743]  When our government screws up on purpose in Katrina and orders a stand-down and a bunch of people die, FEMA got double the funding the next year in Congress for disaster relief.
[00:35:07.743 --> 00:35:09.644]  What does that incentivize?
[00:35:09.644 --> 00:35:10.184]  Screwing up.
[00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:29.860]  And then I see all the Bill and Melinda Gates, Monsanto preparation, like chickens with their heads cut off the last two years on Ebola and Ebola vaccines that are really live virus, nanotech, super science stuff.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:42.009]  From eugenicists that run Planned Parenthood and fund all the big gun control groups and openly say they want to break up the family, hardcore psychopath, exterminist, beyond anything you'll ever see in a movie or read in a book,
[00:35:43.114 --> 00:35:53.979]  They make Hitler look unsophisticated.
[00:35:53.979 --> 00:35:58.321]  I make a statement like that and I think of all the data to prove it and it makes my head spin.
[00:35:58.321 --> 00:36:01.122]  Makes my head swim.
[00:36:01.122 --> 00:36:11.287]  The Rockefellers that run the big tax-free foundations and run that whole program since 1906 and run the Bill of Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet Foundation
[00:36:12.429 --> 00:36:13.530]  On record.
[00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:17.171]  Funded the entire Nazi movement, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, everything.
[00:36:17.171 --> 00:36:27.276]  They run modern education, they founded the UN, gave them the property for it, they run every North American union, every Asia-Pac union group, they run everything.
[00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:32.338]  Along with the British and Dutch royal families and the Rothschilds.
[00:36:32.338 --> 00:36:36.540]  And they are flaming crazy people.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.781]  Now they would argue, no, we're in control and running the show, and we work 15 hours a day to do it.
[00:36:40.781 --> 00:36:41.622]  And it's actually true!
[00:36:42.523 --> 00:36:59.151]  I mean, I guess we've gotten to the point just feeding on all of them, going, okay, you can bring Ebola in, you can forcibly inoculate, you can come out with aerosolized vaccines and vaccines and food we can't escape, and we can see them hurting everybody, and no one stands up to you, so maybe it is survival of the fittest.
[00:36:59.151 --> 00:37:05.514]  Maybe social Darwinism is true.
[00:37:05.514 --> 00:37:07.254]  It's a cult with these people.
[00:37:07.254 --> 00:37:10.556]  David Rockefeller, I've had top scientists on and people this happened to.
[00:37:14.867 --> 00:37:30.232]  Would in the 70s and 60s and things just show up at a university, wouldn't even be Harvard or Princeton or MIT, show up there too, and would just show up in the lunch line to recruit, you know, the top 20-year-old scientist.
[00:37:30.232 --> 00:37:44.077]  But they're obsessed with test scores and who's the smartest and then they recruit them into this cult and they even tried to recruit my dad, it wasn't David Rockefeller, but it was the head of the botany department, into this literal eugenics cult and I'm here
[00:37:45.717 --> 00:37:48.059]  I'm telling you this, this is not a game.
[00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:51.561]  Do you understand how evil these people are?
[00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:53.983]  So I don't know if they released this Ebola.
[00:37:53.983 --> 00:38:07.512]  I know it's mutating like it's never done before, appears to be going airborne, and it kills 70% of people who get treatment in the West now, and more than that in Africa.
[00:38:07.512 --> 00:38:10.914]  And let me tell you, everybody thinks they're going to live forever, you think you're invincible?
[00:38:11.946 --> 00:38:17.512]  I buried three family members in the last 12 months killed by this mystery respiratory crap.
[00:38:17.512 --> 00:38:25.340]  It's just common mutated staph bacteria in these hospitals.
[00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:29.242]  You go to the hospital to visit somebody, you get it, you die.
[00:38:29.242 --> 00:38:32.144]  Family comes to see you, they all get it, they start dying.
[00:38:32.144 --> 00:38:43.470]  And because it was a real plague, and the hospital doctor said they'd never seen death like this, and it was all over the country, nothing in the news except a few local papers saying a lot of deaths and the hospitals are overtaxed.
[00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:46.511]  Because when it's a real crisis, they don't tell you it's a real crisis.
[00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:50.393]  And when it's not a real crisis, they tell you it is by default.
[00:38:50.393 --> 00:38:53.455]  And we're watching in slow motion like a car wreck.
[00:38:55.339 --> 00:39:01.062]  Or like watching a kid strapped down by Ted Bundy have their fingernails torn out slowly.
[00:39:01.062 --> 00:39:22.675]  We are sitting here, watching the government bringing in, watching the borders being wide open, watching the giant population being targeted by a tiny psycho elite who believe they're preparing to sweep the earth of the human disease, all their movies, all their TV shows, all their programs, lotting the world without humans, life after humans, all these preparations.
[00:39:28.104 --> 00:39:36.286]  I don't think that this will probably even be the big one.
[00:39:36.286 --> 00:39:40.106]  As I've said for over a decade on air on this subject, I know how they work.
[00:39:40.106 --> 00:39:54.269]  I said they would do medium-sized and smaller bio-releases that kill thousands or hundreds of thousands in the West, millions in Africa, because that's where they've already gotten away with, you know, 45% of some African countries having HIV.
[00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:55.069]  They go check the
[00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:02.685]  Sexual organs of the young girls, they've never had sex, and then they trace it right back to the vaccines.
[00:40:02.685 --> 00:40:04.106]  Even BBC had to admit that.
[00:40:04.106 --> 00:40:05.848]  It was probably six, seven years ago.
[00:40:05.848 --> 00:40:08.049]  They're giving it to them.
[00:40:08.049 --> 00:40:18.457]  So where they've got air superiority, where they control the media, where they've got the people under their control, oh, it's just a bunch of Africans, kind of a deep-seated liberal racism.
[00:40:18.457 --> 00:40:21.780]  They can get away with giving 45% of the country HIV and killing them.
[00:40:26.581 --> 00:40:47.392]  But they'll have it rolled out, as I predicted, with an Ebola, or a SARS, or a superflu, that kills tens of thousands at first, then hundreds of thousands the next season, then a medical tyranny is put in place, everyone accepts the government's the boss, they're in control, we've got to have total quarantine, total forced inoculation, or you don't want to happen what happened in 2015, do you?
[00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:54.277]  The winter of 2015, you know, where it spread all over the world and killed millions.
[00:40:54.277 --> 00:40:56.138]  I mean, you don't want that to happen again.
[00:40:56.138 --> 00:41:00.461]  You take your Bill and Melinda Gates shot, Alex Jones!
[00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:14.911]  And the public's not sophisticated enough to know they were behind the vaccine, behind the testing centers, in the country where it began to go viral and spread and mutate and go from three days to 21 days so it can spread further and farther before it's identifiable.
[00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:15.852]  But I may be wrong.
[00:41:15.852 --> 00:41:16.933]  It could go airborne this year.
[00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:28.112]  And then 70% of the people that get it will die.
[00:41:28.112 --> 00:41:32.013]  We're talking potentially about billions of dead people.
[00:41:32.013 --> 00:41:36.134]  And now they've got the armored vehicles in place, the checkpoints, the surveillance, all of it.
[00:41:36.134 --> 00:41:42.875]  I kept telling you for years, really about 17 years on the eugenics end, 10 years deeply on it.
[00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:45.216]  First few years I wasn't that learned in these things.
[00:41:45.216 --> 00:41:46.836]  I knew a lot about it, but nothing like I do now.
[00:41:49.124 --> 00:41:56.806]  That once they got their grid in place, once this system was in place, it would be the death of us all.
[00:41:56.806 --> 00:42:07.490]  You've got world leaders, Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Queen Beatrix, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, Senator Rockefeller, all of them talking about how they want to kill everybody.
[00:42:09.807 --> 00:42:14.548]  And before you idiot trolls out there watching make jokes about me starting to break down, listen, I got three kids.
[00:42:14.548 --> 00:42:21.030]  And all you stupid trolls who think you have a death wish, you won't really have a death wish when you're flopping around with blood spraying out both ends.
[00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:26.331]  Let me tell you something, the New World Order wants us all dead and this could be it.
[00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:28.711]  I told you Homeland Security wasn't for Al Qaeda.
[00:42:28.711 --> 00:42:34.833]  I told you it was for the Tea Party and gun owners and veterans and people that won't roll over to whatever it is they got planned.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:44.745]  And you got Dr. Pianka that gets these world awards, and at the time headed up the UT Biology Department, coming out and saying, it's coming soon, the airborne Ebola.
[00:42:44.745 --> 00:42:46.666]  I'm sad for my family, but it must be done.
[00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:48.407]  90 plus percent will die.
[00:42:48.407 --> 00:42:49.408]  I am ready.
[00:42:49.408 --> 00:42:50.489]  It is coming.
[00:42:50.489 --> 00:42:57.053]  And 90 plus percent of the people at the Texas Academy of Sciences in Houston stood and cried.
[00:42:57.973 --> 00:43:05.296]  In up to five minute standing ovations when he projected a wall of red skulls and said the mass death is coming.
[00:43:05.296 --> 00:43:16.461]  Young women, graduate students, ran and threw themselves at him like he was Elvis Presley or the Beatles!
[00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:22.824]  If my dad was in the top 125 test scores across the board in Texas
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:30.824]  And then they took the top six or seven out of that and brought them in a room at the University of Texas and said, well, there's really a world government.
[00:43:30.824 --> 00:43:34.807]  We're forming a eugenics operation, and it's not like Hitler did it.
[00:43:34.807 --> 00:43:37.208]  It's going to be for the betterment of humanity.
[00:43:37.208 --> 00:43:42.451]  Of course, my dad ended up meeting my mom, getting married, going the quick route to medical school.
[00:43:42.451 --> 00:43:43.452]  He was never in all of it.
[00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:49.558]  But then he wondered why, over and over again, the CIA would show up.
[00:43:49.558 --> 00:43:50.638]  We want you to work with us.
[00:43:50.638 --> 00:43:51.719]  We want you to work with us.
[00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:52.799]  We want you to work with us.
[00:43:52.799 --> 00:43:59.181]  It was only because he had been fingered early on, but he's nothing that special.
[00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:04.063]  Out of Texas every year, they're pulling hundreds of people for this kind of stuff.
[00:44:04.063 --> 00:44:06.224]  They've got a huge army in on it.
[00:44:06.224 --> 00:44:07.444]  Do you understand that?
[00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:10.365]  Brought into it when they're 18 years old.
[00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:12.886]  They brought my dad in when he was a junior in high school.
[00:44:12.886 --> 00:44:15.587]  He was already in a summer program at UT when they brought him in.
[00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:19.503]  Little Davy Jones.
[00:44:19.503 --> 00:44:21.425]  Do you understand how widespread it is?
[00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:24.367]  This is the real world, boys and girls.
[00:44:24.367 --> 00:44:26.328]  This is the real planet.
[00:44:26.328 --> 00:44:29.791]  This is where we live.
[00:44:29.791 --> 00:44:32.593]  And they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't think they could get away with it.
[00:44:32.593 --> 00:44:34.734]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:41.680]  Ebola has only come in with patient zero, and we know infected one nurse in Dallas, another nurse in Spain.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.361]  We're going to Joe Biggs here in a minute on the Texas border.
[00:44:46.636 --> 00:44:49.598]  We know that.
[00:44:49.598 --> 00:44:51.559]  But obviously they were around a lot of other people.
[00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:53.720]  I think it's fair to say it's going to be more cases.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.441]  And they did this deliberately to let it spread.
[00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:58.763]  That guy should have been locked up in a level 5 containment day 1.
[00:44:58.763 --> 00:44:59.523]  Level 4.
[00:44:59.523 --> 00:45:00.384]  Here it is, Bloomberg.
[00:45:01.414 --> 00:45:06.958]  Detected Ebola hospital or dedicated Ebola hospital sought after nurses infection.
[00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:07.258]  U.S.
[00:45:07.258 --> 00:45:11.942]  and local health officials want to set up dedicated hospitals in each state for Ebola patients.
[00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:18.187]  Part of a new emphasis on safety and health care workers after a nurse caring for an infected patient in Dallas tested positive for the virus.
[00:45:18.187 --> 00:45:23.010]  Folks, the CDC goes on to say they're rethinking its existing infection control.
[00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.233]  No, they turned off the default, which we've been telling you for months.
[00:45:27.608 --> 00:45:34.131]  We told you when they brought in people with Ebola, it was going to spread from them, and it is now.
[00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.232]  See?
[00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.312]  It was on purpose.
[00:45:36.312 --> 00:45:37.413]  They studied this.
[00:45:37.413 --> 00:45:38.373]  They're the experts.
[00:45:38.373 --> 00:45:38.973]  They knew.
[00:45:38.973 --> 00:45:46.517]  Our government wants Ebola spreading in America, and they think, here's the big one, that they're going to get away with it!
[00:45:47.622 --> 00:45:53.706]  Cops, firefighters, EMTs, medical workers, you're going to be the front lines of getting this.
[00:45:53.706 --> 00:45:59.710]  So remember what your loyalty to this suicidal system did when you get it and your kids get it.
[00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:00.811]  I'm sorry for your kids.
[00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:03.073]  I'll probably be blamed for trying to stop it.
[00:46:03.073 --> 00:46:03.773]  I understand how that works.
[00:46:03.773 --> 00:46:04.694]  I understand.
[00:46:04.694 --> 00:46:08.496]  So just remember, this is what giving in to the New World Order does.
[00:46:08.496 --> 00:46:10.638]  This is what living in fantasy land does, okay?
[00:46:11.516 --> 00:46:13.978]  And for the general public, hope you enjoy it.
[00:46:13.978 --> 00:46:15.379]  Hope you enjoy all of it.
[00:46:15.379 --> 00:46:26.067]  Because if we don't put massive pressure on them now to immediately lock up everybody who's come in contact with these patients, we're talking thousands of people have to be locked up now, they're going to let that spread and it's going to be millions.
[00:46:26.067 --> 00:46:31.972]  They want it to get to a critical mass, then they're going to clamp down and it's going to be hell!
[00:46:31.972 --> 00:46:34.554]  Now let's go to Joe Biggs down there with Josh Owens.
[00:46:34.554 --> 00:46:35.495]  I want to be clear, folks.
[00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:39.426]  The border region is not even the place that's a hot zone.
[00:46:39.426 --> 00:46:41.667]  The entire of America is.
[00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:43.548]  Hospitals are the hot zones.
[00:46:43.548 --> 00:46:45.709]  Clinics are the hot zones.
[00:46:45.709 --> 00:46:47.089]  Not the border.
[00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:53.552]  We're down on the border where people would come across who have it to go to the hospital.
[00:46:53.552 --> 00:46:57.673]  That's where the real hot zone is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:57.673 --> 00:46:59.154]  Joe Biggs, what are you singing down there?
[00:46:59.154 --> 00:47:02.255]  What's your take on what you just heard me talk about?
[00:47:02.255 --> 00:47:03.735]  Joe Biggs, Infowars.com.
[00:47:03.735 --> 00:47:05.156]  I'm at Andalusa Park.
[00:47:05.675 --> 00:47:06.596]  In Mission, Texas.
[00:47:06.596 --> 00:47:09.178]  Now right behind me is the Rio Grande, as you can see.
[00:47:09.178 --> 00:47:12.441]  And just across the water, that's Mexico right there.
[00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:17.445]  We're at the park where yesterday we were harassed by police for being here.
[00:47:17.445 --> 00:47:24.211]  And right now, if Josh pans around, you can see there's a police officer who's followed us over here to keep an eye on us.
[00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:25.132]  We're obviously media.
[00:47:25.132 --> 00:47:27.234]  We're sitting here filming and they're following us.
[00:47:27.234 --> 00:47:27.594]  Meanwhile,
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.862]  Tons of other vehicles are coming through and no cops are bothering them whatsoever.
[00:47:31.862 --> 00:47:33.283]  It's just us, the journalists, out here trying to cover the story.
[00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:35.925]  That's because they've caught, just like in Ferguson, the police.
[00:47:35.925 --> 00:47:38.006]  It's not looters that are the problem.
[00:47:38.006 --> 00:47:39.727]  It's press that are non-violent.
[00:47:39.727 --> 00:47:42.329]  Everywhere they're being programmed that we're the enemy.
[00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:44.870]  Yeah, because we're the ones who want to expose the truth, what's really going on.
[00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:45.451]  They hate that.
[00:47:45.451 --> 00:47:46.571]  They don't like that.
[00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:50.874]  We're the outlet for the truth for the entire people to see.
[00:47:50.874 --> 00:47:52.435]  They hate every single bit of that.
[00:47:52.435 --> 00:47:52.915]  Absolutely.
[00:47:52.915 --> 00:47:53.756]  Tell us what else you've seen.
[00:47:54.807 --> 00:47:58.310]  Well, yesterday, I took Josh to a couple spots.
[00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.452]  You know, I've been out here to McAllen quite a few times over the months.
[00:48:01.452 --> 00:48:06.396]  And, you know, over the past few months, we've been reporting how there's just been nobody, wide open areas.
[00:48:06.396 --> 00:48:07.497]  We got out there yesterday.
[00:48:07.497 --> 00:48:10.939]  There was army out there, Air Force.
[00:48:10.939 --> 00:48:16.763]  There was a soldier on each Humvee on top with binoculars looking, helicopters in the air.
[00:48:16.763 --> 00:48:21.347]  The park here where I'm at, there's, I would say, maybe 20, 30 police vehicles.
[00:48:22.106 --> 00:48:25.367]  Uh, boat set up, uh, helicopters are flying by every now and then.
[00:48:25.367 --> 00:48:28.467]  Uh, they've definitely amped up their security.
[00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:47.411]  And I don't know if this is for the cry about, uh, you know, what Governor Perry did trying to, uh, call in the National Guard, or is this because of what General Kelly said over the week talking about how the, uh, Ebola virus had come into Central America and then, uh, essentially start spreading through there and then pushing all the patients
[00:48:47.813 --> 00:48:51.035]  Well, that's good, because you're supposed to have the feds on the border.
[00:48:51.035 --> 00:48:52.575]  That's the only place they're supposed to be.
[00:48:52.575 --> 00:48:55.717]  You're supposed to have the army on the border.
[00:48:55.717 --> 00:48:59.379]  Now, were those big army or National Guard you saw?
[00:48:59.379 --> 00:49:04.962]  The army I saw was National Guard, because it had that little arrowhead patch with the T, so I think that's the Texas National Guard.
[00:49:16.425 --> 00:49:20.349]  But the Air Force, I'm not sure why they would be out here.
[00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:21.630]  Well, what type of aircraft were they?
[00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:24.152]  Probably running infrared, or what do you think?
[00:49:24.152 --> 00:49:27.456]  They just had a Humvee with some kind of device on top, so I'm not sure.
[00:49:27.456 --> 00:49:29.358]  Maybe some kind of listening device.
[00:49:29.358 --> 00:49:32.681]  That's all I could, you know, come to a... Well, great job on that.
[00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:37.846]  Try to get up there and interview some of those folks, or try to talk to their public affairs person.
[00:49:37.846 --> 00:49:39.527]  Yeah, I tried to talk to some of them yesterday.
[00:49:39.527 --> 00:49:41.029]  They said we couldn't talk to them.
[00:49:41.733 --> 00:49:46.276]  Uh, we couldn't film them, so, I mean, they didn't want us to be around them anywhere near this area.
[00:49:46.276 --> 00:49:49.438]  Well, by the way, they can't tell you that you can't film them.
[00:49:49.438 --> 00:49:53.221]  I mean, they can refuse an interview, but they can't tell you not to film them.
[00:49:53.221 --> 00:49:53.401]  Yeah.
[00:49:54.517 --> 00:49:55.858]  Did we get footage of them?
[00:49:55.858 --> 00:49:56.359]  Yes.
[00:49:56.359 --> 00:49:56.939]  Good, good job.
[00:49:56.939 --> 00:49:58.120]  Let's get those reports out.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:04.166]  Well, you heard me ranting earlier, and you were on air a month ago saying the same thing when you were down on the border.
[00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:12.134]  The default was to put them in special Level 4 emergency facilities they have under BioShield, 36 locations.
[00:50:12.134 --> 00:50:13.275]  They already are set up for this.
[00:50:14.296 --> 00:50:23.788]  It was never put Ebola patients in the mainline Atlanta hospital or the mainline Dallas hospital with people untrained to deal with it.
[00:50:23.788 --> 00:50:27.553]  Of course it was going to give healthcare workers the disease.
[00:50:27.553 --> 00:50:29.515]  So now they're letting them fly in.
[00:50:30.556 --> 00:50:34.798]  As reportedly people are coming off airplanes vomiting in Boston, New York, you name it.
[00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.738]  Out of Africa.
[00:50:35.738 --> 00:50:36.959]  People are on strike now.
[00:50:36.959 --> 00:50:38.079]  We're into week two.
[00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:41.421]  As airline workers freak out.
[00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:48.604]  Who knows how many Ebola victims that are carrying the disease as vectors are already in the U.S., Joe.
[00:50:48.604 --> 00:50:50.304]  What do you think's really going on here?
[00:50:50.304 --> 00:50:51.145]  Well, you gotta think, though.
[00:50:51.145 --> 00:50:57.367]  When this influx of the quote-unquote children were coming across the borders, what did we start building along the borders, Alex?
[00:50:57.367 --> 00:50:58.868]  All these different facilities to house them.
[00:50:59.335 --> 00:51:07.018]  Now we have that same facility that Don Kitt and John Bowne and I filmed when they were putting it up and getting it ready to bring in.
[00:51:07.018 --> 00:51:07.638]  It's still there.
[00:51:07.638 --> 00:51:08.658]  I drove by it this morning.
[00:51:08.658 --> 00:51:09.979]  I saw it yesterday.
[00:51:09.979 --> 00:51:10.719]  It's fenced in.
[00:51:10.719 --> 00:51:12.480]  They still have the FEMA bus in there.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.382]  There's not as many of the smaller Homeland Security buses.
[00:51:17.382 --> 00:51:19.382]  But they've still got something going on in there.
[00:51:19.382 --> 00:51:21.543]  It's secretive and it's shut off.
[00:51:21.543 --> 00:51:24.504]  So that's definitely a spot where they could be doing something like that.
[00:51:24.504 --> 00:51:26.085]  Disappearing people and putting them in there.
[00:51:26.857 --> 00:51:33.666]  Well, that's what the Border Patrol, from two different sources, have told us, one on record, as this has been going on for months.
[00:51:33.666 --> 00:51:39.513]  And again, it'd be one thing if they were quarantining people, they should be public about it, so it's not secret detainment.
[00:51:40.427 --> 00:51:43.109]  But then they would have default shut down the flights.
[00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:49.993]  If they shut down the flights, recording people day one and grabbing folks at the border, I'd say, well, it's sad, but it has to happen.
[00:51:49.993 --> 00:51:51.714]  This is a very deadly disease.
[00:51:51.714 --> 00:52:00.799]  But instead, they're leaving it open while running what looks like a training op on the border to me.
[00:52:00.799 --> 00:52:05.501]  It's mind blowing because, you know, all these other countries have nipped it in the bud already.
[00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:08.123]  Months ago, stopped those flights from West Africa.
[00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:12.627]  So the American people still are blind to the fact that this is a planned event.
[00:52:12.627 --> 00:52:18.291]  You know, our government's left the borders wide open down here where we're at now, and they've left the air completely open.
[00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:21.373]  They're letting the planes fly into our airspace from West Africa.
[00:52:21.373 --> 00:52:25.416]  They're allowing this to happen to create this huge outbreak, this pandemic.
[00:52:25.416 --> 00:52:29.359]  And like you said, once it gets to a certain point, that's when they enact those FEMA camps.
[00:52:29.359 --> 00:52:30.920]  That's when they start detaining people.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.042]  Every time you have a cough, you look like you have some kind of respiratory illness.
[00:52:34.042 --> 00:52:35.343]  Then President Obama's, uh,
[00:52:35.828 --> 00:52:44.499]  Executive order comes into play, then you start being detained, and next thing you know, everybody's getting scooped up by the busloads and ushered off to some camp.
[00:52:44.499 --> 00:52:45.620]  I think the verdict's clear.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:51.267]  I'm gonna open the phones up in the third hour after Joel Skousen leaves us, but there's no other way to look at it.
[00:52:52.714 --> 00:52:54.556]  The government is run by criminals.
[00:52:54.556 --> 00:53:07.550]  They have allowed people to come in to create a big crisis so they can have political distractions from all of Obama's scandals and bring in medical tyranny and a precedent for forced inoculation with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:09.612]  That's what this is.
[00:53:09.612 --> 00:53:11.333]  That's how you bring down a country.
[00:53:11.333 --> 00:53:13.015]  That's how you bring in tyranny.
[00:53:13.015 --> 00:53:17.458]  They used Al Qaeda that they funded and helped protect to bring in the police state.
[00:53:17.458 --> 00:53:21.241]  Now they're going to use the police state on the Ebola that they protected as well.
[00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:23.402]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, Joe.
[00:53:23.402 --> 00:53:25.804]  Well, they're using this as a way, too, to push the flu shot.
[00:53:25.804 --> 00:53:32.189]  Just two days ago on Fox, on that Judge Jeanine show, Justice, she had on a doctor from New York City, and he said,
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:40.287]  You know, right now, there's a huge scare because everybody that has a cough, they automatically get quarantined, brought into a hospital, and everyone's in a panic.
[00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:44.902]  And uh, Janine, or Judge Janine, she goes, well, what are we going to do to stop that?
[00:53:44.902 --> 00:53:47.224]  How do we, how do we stop the confusion?
[00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:50.146]  And he said, well, everybody needs to go get their flu shot.
[00:53:50.146 --> 00:53:51.587]  Everyone needs to get the flu shot.
[00:53:51.587 --> 00:53:53.588]  Everyone needs to get, he said like three times.
[00:53:53.588 --> 00:53:55.589]  So this is another way to push a vaccine.
[00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.990]  Exactly.
[00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:57.651]  And he said, this is how we determine now.
[00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:00.913]  He's like, if everyone gets their flu shot, then you're not going to get the flu.
[00:54:00.913 --> 00:54:04.736]  So the people that have flu like symptoms, we're going to already know, probably have Ebola.
[00:54:04.736 --> 00:54:05.657]  And that's how we stop that.
[00:54:06.257 --> 00:54:08.418]  Let's walk through that fraud for new listeners.
[00:54:08.418 --> 00:54:09.639]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:54:09.639 --> 00:54:25.627]  The flu shot that they have predicted the year before, that predicted mutation, has never picked the right mutation and on record lowers your immune system by 50% for at least one year when you take it against other viral pathogens.
[00:54:25.627 --> 00:54:29.429]  If you don't believe me, just type into Google, flu shot lowers viral immunity.
[00:54:30.029 --> 00:54:37.115]  University of Ottawa Studies, University of Texas Studies, Harvard Medical Center Studies.
[00:54:37.115 --> 00:54:45.923]  Okay folks, it lowers your immunity, so would you want to take a flu shot if it lowers your immunity to other viruses for at least a 12-month period, Joe?
[00:54:46.343 --> 00:54:47.644]  Well, this is the thing, though.
[00:54:47.644 --> 00:54:49.765]  I've been out of the Army almost two years now.
[00:54:49.765 --> 00:54:51.647]  Not once have I gotten the flu.
[00:54:51.647 --> 00:54:59.092]  When I was in the Army and I was lined up like cattle and forced to take the flu vaccine or the spray, I got the flu so many times.
[00:54:59.092 --> 00:55:01.614]  I would get the flu horribly one to two days later.
[00:55:02.054 --> 00:55:06.578]  Then I would finally get out of it and by then I've missed a week of work and lost weight.
[00:55:06.578 --> 00:55:08.820]  Then I would get it again mysteriously.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.022]  And then the military is like, why do you keep getting sick?
[00:55:11.022 --> 00:55:11.682]  You got the flu shot.
[00:55:11.682 --> 00:55:12.543]  Why do you keep getting sick?
[00:55:12.543 --> 00:55:14.064]  We're going to give you an article 15.
[00:55:14.064 --> 00:55:14.825]  You're trying to malinger.
[00:55:14.825 --> 00:55:15.705]  You're trying to get out of work.
[00:55:15.705 --> 00:55:18.047]  And I'm like, no, this flu shot makes you sick.
[00:55:18.047 --> 00:55:19.609]  Why can't you guys see that?
[00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:22.771]  Meanwhile, the guys who are telling me that aren't even getting the flu shot.
[00:55:22.771 --> 00:55:24.293]  The higher ranking people don't get it.
[00:55:29.958 --> 00:55:37.907]  I don't know any general enlisted that are for vaccines because of all the nightmares they've been through.
[00:55:37.907 --> 00:55:39.068]  That's why the military is so awake.
[00:55:39.068 --> 00:55:40.650]  They have been used as guinea pigs.
[00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.131]  They've been given the anthrax shot.
[00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:42.452]  All of it.
[00:55:42.452 --> 00:55:43.333]  It's disgusting.
[00:55:43.333 --> 00:55:44.294]  Joe, we're going to go to break.
[00:55:44.294 --> 00:55:46.156]  I want to come back and get five minutes with Josh.
[00:55:46.656 --> 00:55:52.820]  And then, great job, get out there, finish your reports, and then do that now on the street, and then come back to Austin.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:56.962]  Former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs now reporting from the border.
[00:55:56.962 --> 00:56:04.867]  The General Kelly, the head of South Com, says it's where they expect masses of people with Ebola to come if it starts spreading in Central and South America.
[00:56:04.867 --> 00:56:05.547]  Thank you, Joe.
[00:56:05.547 --> 00:56:09.709]  We're going to go to break here and come back and get Josh Owens' take as well.
[00:56:09.709 --> 00:56:12.111]  He's the camera guy, but he's a great reporter in his own right.
[00:56:12.111 --> 00:56:14.492]  I want to get his view on this.
[00:56:14.492 --> 00:56:15.513]  Before we go any further,
[00:56:16.837 --> 00:56:21.159]  You know what I'm personally doing from my research for myself and my family?
[00:56:21.159 --> 00:56:28.382]  I went home early from work yesterday and I went to a local community pool with my kids because it was sunny and I got them two hours of sun.
[00:56:28.382 --> 00:56:31.383]  I left early, I got them early, I went and I got them sun.
[00:56:32.398 --> 00:56:35.139]  All the major studies, all of it, sun is so important.
[00:56:35.139 --> 00:56:47.504]  That's why stuff spreads so bad during the winter because the different chemicals and different hormones and different vitamins that don't get released in your body and don't get produced in your body, you know, it's not just vitamin D without sun.
[00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:49.305]  So sun is numero uno.
[00:56:49.585 --> 00:56:50.966]  Can't live with it, can't live without it.
[00:56:50.966 --> 00:56:54.429]  Yeah, it ends up giving you skin cancer later, but that's just part of it.
[00:56:54.429 --> 00:56:55.690]  You're meant to get sun, folks.
[00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.894]  That's why white people that are from the north have white skin to get more of it, because you need it.
[00:56:59.894 --> 00:57:02.957]  If you're by the equator, you've got black skin because you don't need more of it.
[00:57:02.957 --> 00:57:04.578]  Comprende, folks?
[00:57:04.578 --> 00:57:07.801]  Especially white people need sun.
[00:57:07.801 --> 00:57:12.285]  And then you've got black folks with sunscreen and studies on them, it's even worse when they don't get it.
[00:57:12.285 --> 00:57:14.167]  So, you want to get cancer?
[00:57:14.167 --> 00:57:15.088]  You want to get sick?
[00:57:15.088 --> 00:57:16.349]  Bottom line, don't get sun.
[00:57:17.984 --> 00:57:18.804]  Vitamin B12.
[00:57:18.804 --> 00:57:21.405]  Vitamin D. That's what I'm doing for myself.
[00:57:21.405 --> 00:57:24.186]  I take the Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:57:24.186 --> 00:57:26.366]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:26.366 --> 00:57:27.406]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:27.406 --> 00:57:29.287]  What it's personally done for me and my health.
[00:57:29.287 --> 00:57:36.109]  Super Mel Vitality to work on my glands and block the estrogen mimickers that make you all bloated and weak and lethargic.
[00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:37.969]  Silver Bullet.
[00:57:37.969 --> 00:57:39.289]  Colloidal Silver.
[00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:43.931]  I just take it religiously now during the winter season and it's certainly been helping me.
[00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:44.771]  DNA Force.
[00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.292]  DNA Force, Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:48.292 --> 00:57:50.134]  I'll take my two tablets right now.
[00:57:50.134 --> 00:57:53.136]  It's got the Organic CoQ10.
[00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.757]  Just go read all the stuff it's got in it.
[00:57:54.757 --> 00:57:58.300]  The PPQ, the BioPQQ, all of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:59.423 --> 00:58:06.325]  I was in a pharmacy yesterday and they were playing ads for BioPQQ and how amazing it is, but to get a prescription for it.
[00:58:06.325 --> 00:58:07.665]  A lot of companies put it out that way.
[00:58:07.665 --> 00:58:09.246]  I mean, this is a nutraceutical.
[00:58:09.246 --> 00:58:10.486]  This is not a game.
[00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.887]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:12.887 --> 00:58:19.789]  You'll get this powerful BioPQQ and more at the lowest price it is out there with everything that's put together that we found.
[00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:22.950]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:27.751]  I'm going to take a big, nice drink of this right now.
[00:58:29.497 --> 00:58:30.918]  Squirt it all into the water.
[00:58:30.918 --> 00:58:32.119]  Mix it up and take it.
[00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:34.060]  Three times a day, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.161]  And it's had dramatic effects.
[00:58:35.161 --> 00:58:37.583]  You've heard the callers, what it's done for them.
[00:58:37.583 --> 00:58:38.824]  And it supports the broadcast.
[00:58:38.824 --> 00:58:40.525]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:40.525 --> 00:58:41.186]  Second hour.
[00:58:41.186 --> 00:58:44.388]  Get a quick pop-in from Josh Owens.
[00:58:44.388 --> 00:58:49.212]  And then we're going to sit there and talk to a lot of other folks.
[00:58:49.212 --> 00:58:49.572]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.760]  In the near future.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:57.242]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:58:57.242 --> 00:58:58.462]  Security alert.
[00:58:58.462 --> 00:59:00.483]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:59:00.483 --> 00:59:04.044]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[00:59:04.044 --> 00:59:06.525]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[00:59:07.025 --> 00:59:09.046]  We are the ones responsible.
[00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:11.606]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:11.606 --> 00:59:14.467]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:17.728]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:17.728 --> 00:59:20.009]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:20.009 --> 00:59:21.549]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:23.870]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:26.332]  They're never going to stop.
[00:59:26.332 --> 00:59:30.235]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:59:30.235 --> 00:59:37.501]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:37.501 --> 00:59:41.605]  Collectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:59:53.266 --> 00:59:55.648]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.648 --> 01:00:06.295]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.295 --> 01:00:07.596]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.596 --> 01:00:09.357]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:11.118]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.118 --> 01:00:12.719]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.719 --> 01:00:14.260]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:18.463]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.463 --> 01:00:22.526]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:30.154]  Well, nurses are openly worried that Ebola is beginning to go airborne.
[01:00:30.154 --> 01:00:33.396]  We'll get Joel Scalza's take on this coming up.
[01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:44.425]  Josh Owens, cameraman but also reporter for M4WarsNightlyNews, M4Wars.com and PrisonBlunted.com is down on the Texas border right on the Rio Grande with Joe Biggs.
[01:00:44.425 --> 01:00:46.887]  Give us your take, Josh, on what you've witnessed down there.
[01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:55.608]  Uh, well, yesterday when we were out here, we saw that the security, like Joe said, has been amped up.
[01:00:55.608 --> 01:01:02.790]  And when we were in Arizona, when we were in California, all along the border where we've been, we haven't seen, I mean, basically the border has been wide open.
[01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:14.232]  Not to say that the border isn't still wide open, but just in this area, in McAllen, where it's been open before, there seems to be heightened security, heightened border patrol, heightened police.
[01:01:14.232 --> 01:01:16.913]  And as people can see, the video we posted yesterday,
[01:01:17.932 --> 01:01:30.661]  We were pulled over just for simply driving around and shooting video, which is sad because it's not surprising to us, at least it's not surprising to me, because it happens all the time.
[01:01:30.661 --> 01:01:34.624]  But if you really step back and look at it, it's pretty ridiculous.
[01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:40.949]  When you're driving through a park, you're driving through a public place, even if it's not a public place, you're in an area trying to report what's going on.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.280]  And, I mean, there are plenty of other people driving around here.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.321]  They're not getting pulled over.
[01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:46.221]  They're not getting followed.
[01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:51.042]  We still have this cop right over here in front of me that's still sitting there just watching us.
[01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:56.002]  And, I mean, obviously we're being criminals by standing here talking.
[01:01:56.002 --> 01:01:57.663]  I mean, it's pretty ridiculous.
[01:01:57.663 --> 01:02:00.803]  And I believe, I don't see how anyone could disagree with how ridiculous that is.
[01:02:00.803 --> 01:02:09.125]  There is a war on the press everywhere and the police are being ordered, whether it's New York City or McAllen, Texas, it doesn't matter.
[01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.405]  Look what happened in Ferguson.
[01:02:11.403 --> 01:02:16.687]  Where we were even there, especially at first, you know, more pro-police as we're against looting and rioting.
[01:02:16.687 --> 01:02:21.992]  And then they would attack Ja'kari, attack Joe, attack you, attack Al Jazeera.
[01:02:21.992 --> 01:02:23.473]  And then now they've got folks in St.
[01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:27.996]  Louis running around looting, you know, racially motivated.
[01:02:27.996 --> 01:02:29.438]  It's really spiraling out of control.
[01:02:29.438 --> 01:02:33.741]  And we're not even sending reporters because we'll just be attacked by the crowd and by the police.
[01:02:33.741 --> 01:02:37.964]  I mean, it's like in America, the most horrible thing in the world is the press.
[01:02:37.964 --> 01:02:39.766]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:02:40.819 --> 01:02:44.300]  Yeah, it's sad when you come to expect it every trip we go on.
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.041]  You come to expect to just be harassed.
[01:02:46.041 --> 01:02:52.363]  And like you were saying with all the nurses being concerned about Ebola, my mom is a phlebotomist near the CDC in Atlanta.
[01:02:52.363 --> 01:02:55.644]  She's, you know, maybe 45 minutes outside of Atlanta.
[01:02:55.644 --> 01:02:56.605]  And she's concerned.
[01:02:56.605 --> 01:03:02.567]  And, you know, they are, I guess, forced to get the flu vaccine at the office.
[01:03:02.567 --> 01:03:05.048]  They can choose not to, but, you know, they're almost chastised.
[01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:09.250]  Well, then I've got to wear a mask all the time, which is a great idea.
[01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:15.131]  I don't want to wear a mask all the time working in one of those sick hospitals with all those deadly bugs in them.
[01:03:15.131 --> 01:03:21.373]  I would much rather wear a mask than have thimerosal mercury metals shot into my body, which is going to give me the flu.
[01:03:21.373 --> 01:03:24.694]  Everyone I know that gets the flu has gotten the flu shot.
[01:03:24.694 --> 01:03:28.495]  My mother used to be a triathlete like 15, 20 years ago.
[01:03:28.495 --> 01:03:30.215]  It almost killed her to get the flu shot.
[01:03:30.215 --> 01:03:33.576]  There's a reason nobody likes vaccines because you take it, you get deathly ill.
[01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:38.874]  Exactly, and like you've said, we'll see what happens.
[01:03:38.874 --> 01:03:56.012]  I mean, it seems like if this, if Ebola keeps spreading and more and more people keep getting it, which it seems like is highly likely, because they're quarantining some people, but it seems like other people, it's almost like the press conference we were at in Dallas.
[01:03:56.012 --> 01:03:56.413]  It was just
[01:03:56.877 --> 01:03:58.297]  Well, you know, it's not a big deal.
[01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:04.679]  Someone has to basically vomit into an open wound for you to get Ebola, which everyone knows is total BS and is not true at all.
[01:04:04.679 --> 01:04:08.860]  Because these nurses who are wearing the proper safety gear are still getting Ebola.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:19.222]  And I'm sure that they're... I mean, this isn't a fact, but it's just what I believe, is that at some point, they're being pressured to come out and say, oh, well, I accidentally touched my face.
[01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.542]  You know, I broke protocol.
[01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:21.582]  It's my fault.
[01:04:21.582 --> 01:04:25.423]  When, in all honesty, they're trying
[01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:29.317]  To make it seem as though Ebola is this...
[01:04:30.413 --> 01:04:34.116]  Look, somebody puts rags with all the blood and stuff.
[01:04:34.116 --> 01:04:35.437]  Some of it gets aerosolized.
[01:04:35.437 --> 01:04:36.618]  It goes out the door.
[01:04:36.618 --> 01:04:37.699]  Somebody breathes it.
[01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:38.520]  That's what's happening.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.222]  And that's not even technically airborne.
[01:04:40.222 --> 01:04:41.783]  It's in a particulate.
[01:04:41.783 --> 01:04:44.665]  But the question is, will the virus get to the point of actually being airborne?
[01:04:44.665 --> 01:04:46.107]  And that's what nurses are now asking.
[01:04:46.107 --> 01:04:54.214]  We'll play that video coming up and talk to the expert on strategic relocation, safe places in the U.S., Joel Skousen.
[01:04:54.214 --> 01:04:57.136]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.862 --> 01:05:07.508]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.508 --> 01:05:12.652]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.652 --> 01:05:21.379]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.379 --> 01:05:25.443]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:25.443 --> 01:05:27.705]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:29.864 --> 01:05:34.467]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:38.289]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:05:38.289 --> 01:05:39.530]  Others don't.
[01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:41.671]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.452]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:43.452 --> 01:05:46.354]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.354 --> 01:05:52.978]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:52.978 --> 01:05:55.680]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.041]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:58.922]  Others don't.
[01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:06.416]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:06:06.416 --> 01:06:09.839]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:06:09.839 --> 01:06:11.500]  Here we go, folks, I'm being responsive!
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:17.846]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:17.846 --> 01:06:23.751]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:27.853]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:30.915]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:06:30.915 --> 01:06:39.200]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.301]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:42.342]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:06:42.702 --> 01:06:51.675]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:06:59.935 --> 01:07:02.178]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:07:02.178 --> 01:07:10.228]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:10.228 --> 01:07:17.417]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:07:17.757 --> 01:07:22.360]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:32.987]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:07:32.987 --> 01:07:39.492]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:07:39.492 --> 01:07:42.053]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:07:42.053 --> 01:07:45.716]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:07:45.856 --> 01:07:47.797]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:51.959]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[01:07:51.959 --> 01:08:03.184]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[01:08:03.184 --> 01:08:09.807]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.807 --> 01:08:12.808]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.574 --> 01:08:30.715]  Well, the UN has different numbers.
[01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:36.478]  400,000, 1.4 million German virologists said I think 5 million people will end up getting Ebola.
[01:08:36.478 --> 01:08:49.404]  Whatever the case really is, the defaults of not letting people fly in from West African countries, of not putting Ebola patients in regular hospitals, all of that has been ignored.
[01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:58.836]  I believe so they can let it start to spread to create a big crisis to then try to force a vaccine that happens to come out in December.
[01:08:58.836 --> 01:09:01.498]  A whole new polio hysteria.
[01:09:01.498 --> 01:09:08.023]  My grandmother, Benny Hammond, got polio in the early 1950s.
[01:09:08.023 --> 01:09:11.966]  My mother was like four years old.
[01:09:11.966 --> 01:09:14.487]  One month after she took the polio vaccine.
[01:09:14.487 --> 01:09:16.409]  So there you go, boys and girls.
[01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:21.111]  And it's on record that a lot of people got polio from the vaccine.
[01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:26.335]  Nowadays they give the vaccine and they call it paralysis, not polio.
[01:09:26.335 --> 01:09:29.117]  Just like Guillaume Baret from the H1N1 shot.
[01:09:29.117 --> 01:09:31.218]  So it's a whole social engineering agenda.
[01:09:31.218 --> 01:09:37.203]  It's not that I don't believe that the science of inoculation isn't real, isn't valid, doesn't work in some cases.
[01:09:37.203 --> 01:09:40.205]  But there's always side effects, there's a cost-benefit analysis.
[01:09:40.205 --> 01:09:45.148]  They get up on the news and say no side effects, safe and effective, it's the law, take shots, to go to school.
[01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:46.189]  There is no law.
[01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:47.010]  They lie about it.
[01:09:48.615 --> 01:09:50.138]  And so I'm very, very suspicious.
[01:09:50.138 --> 01:09:53.263]  This was shot off Dallas television.
[01:09:53.263 --> 01:09:56.488]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:56.488 --> 01:10:00.374]  And the headline with Steve Watson is Dallas nurse.
[01:10:00.374 --> 01:10:01.816]  Is Ebola airborne now?
[01:10:01.816 --> 01:10:02.578]  Let's play that clip.
[01:10:04.778 --> 01:10:08.181]  And then we will, uh... We are wondering is it really contact?
[01:10:08.181 --> 01:10:13.325]  Is it contact and airborne or is it just really contact and there may have been a breach of protocol?
[01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:15.086]  We really don't know.
[01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:17.568]  We are wondering is it really contact?
[01:10:17.568 --> 01:10:22.712]  Is it contact and airborne or is it just really contact and there may have been a breach of protocol?
[01:10:22.712 --> 01:10:24.834]  We really don't know.
[01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:28.917]  Now that's Fox 4.
[01:10:28.917 --> 01:10:33.181]  The lady that caught this, Anna, was a nurse and was wearing full gear.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:40.822]  Now we have a nurse, as of last week, in Spain who got it.
[01:10:40.822 --> 01:10:46.345]  Again, the default from the CDC is you put them in level 4 facilities and government facilities.
[01:10:46.345 --> 01:11:00.010]  Now they're in Bloomberg today, dedicated Ebola hospitals sought after a nurse's infection, and they're saying, oh, the CDC's looking at putting them now at one of the 36 or more BioShield government labs.
[01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.211]  Yeah, that's already the default.
[01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:05.191]  So why did they ignore this?
[01:11:05.191 --> 01:11:07.672]  To have plausible deniability?
[01:11:07.672 --> 01:11:11.613]  Is this just a primer for another controlled outbreak later?
[01:11:11.613 --> 01:11:12.974]  Because they tend to do these in tests.
[01:11:12.974 --> 01:11:15.295]  They're scientists and they want to study the effect.
[01:11:15.295 --> 01:11:31.141]  Remember, we have a government with thousands of declassified tests on poor blacks, poor whites, Appalachia kids, Tuskegee blacks, troops, pregnant wives of GIs, oh here's some vitamin pills, really uranium, plutonium, strontium,
[01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:33.734]  Just to, quote, see what it would do to the babies.
[01:11:33.734 --> 01:11:42.658]  We had 36,000 Nazis after World War II brought over here on the rat line to not just run NASA, not just run the intelligence agencies, but run it all.
[01:11:42.658 --> 01:11:50.382]  So you have this scientific dictatorship in the West of eugenicists, from my research.
[01:11:50.382 --> 01:11:51.783]  Just pure devils.
[01:11:51.783 --> 01:11:55.684]  And then you've got them competing with other power blocs, as Joel Skousen has said.
[01:11:55.684 --> 01:12:00.567]  And Joel Skousen joins us, editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief, best-selling author,
[01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:12.787]  Undoubtedly, and we've had a lot of other top relocation and survivalists on, and I want to get Wesley Rawls on, by the way, as soon as he wants to come on, because he just wrote a book about a...
[01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:17.404]  Bio-outbreak and worldwide collapse.
[01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:17.985]  What timing?
[01:12:17.985 --> 01:12:20.887]  I think that came out last year, maybe earlier this year.
[01:12:20.887 --> 01:12:26.730]  But Joel Skousen's written the non-fiction book Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Saved Places, third edition.
[01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.051]  But he's lived all over the world.
[01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:33.075]  This has maps of the safest places, country by country, region by region.
[01:12:33.075 --> 01:12:40.380]  So powerful, two years ago we made a film with him that augments it and updates the book Strategic Relocation.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.642]  Joel Skousen tells the safest places to live and how to secure your home.
[01:12:44.743 --> 01:12:52.854]  Both the book and the film, discounted, I produced the film, are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:12:52.854 --> 01:12:56.439]  And if you already have the book or the video, you should re-watch it again.
[01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:59.003]  He, of course, is the worldwide bestseller of The Secure Home.
[01:12:59.764 --> 01:13:02.366]  Been a number one bestseller for decades.
[01:13:02.366 --> 01:13:05.228]  There's I think a third edition now we carry that just came out.
[01:13:05.228 --> 01:13:16.895]  So it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139 and your purchase supports the broadcast of what we're doing here.
[01:13:16.895 --> 01:13:24.160]  So I want to look at big picture first, what he thinks is going on with this Ebola, with its history.
[01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:28.288]  Clearly they want to create panic.
[01:13:28.288 --> 01:13:29.953]  They didn't want to until it was spreading.
[01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:33.016]  They don't want to let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:13:33.016 --> 01:13:34.397]  Clearly it's mutated.
[01:13:34.397 --> 01:13:41.741]  I don't know if it's airborne, but it chestates, it incubates for 21 days, not three, so it allows it to spread.
[01:13:41.741 --> 01:13:44.702]  Now, can bats fly over in Africa?
[01:13:44.702 --> 01:13:46.203]  Use the bathroom and then you breathe it?
[01:13:46.203 --> 01:13:48.204]  That's probably the main reason it's spreading.
[01:13:48.204 --> 01:13:50.646]  It's clearly becoming stronger.
[01:13:50.646 --> 01:13:54.928]  It was a weak virus outside the body, very strong inside the body, with a 70% morbidity
[01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.852]  Well, it's good to be with you again, Alex.
[01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:15.999]  I think the jury is out still on a number of issues that you've brought up.
[01:14:15.999 --> 01:14:24.263]  There are clear possibilities that the United States has tinkered with the Ebola.
[01:14:24.263 --> 01:14:30.985]  There's no reason to have a CDC patent on a particular strain of Ebola unless you're planning on weaponizing it.
[01:14:30.985 --> 01:14:31.546]  Or worse,
[01:14:32.557 --> 01:14:39.013]  You want to make sure that the powers that be have a proven vaccine so that they're protected.
[01:14:39.013 --> 01:14:40.417]  You know, bioweapons are very
[01:14:42.916 --> 01:14:44.816]  Indiscriminate in who they pick.
[01:14:44.816 --> 01:14:52.398]  And so, unless you're guaranteed that you have a level of protection, you don't let a bioweapon out in the world.
[01:14:52.398 --> 01:14:55.979]  I'm not sure this is it, in particular.
[01:14:55.979 --> 01:15:01.360]  It may be a preliminary to something bigger further on.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.581]  Really, to be a good bioweapon, it's got to be airborne.
[01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:21.100]  I think it's pretty clear that unless this mutation occurs that Ebola is not yet airborne except for the fact that micro droplets whether through a sneeze or a cough or even a laugh from an Ebola infected person
[01:15:22.176 --> 01:15:24.258]  does become airborne.
[01:15:24.258 --> 01:15:33.688]  It isn't to the same extent that other viruses like the flu are, where merely breathing around and it lingers in the air can infect somebody.
[01:15:33.688 --> 01:15:38.514]  But still it's clear that this is contaminating other people who have not had
[01:15:39.054 --> 01:15:39.254]  I think?
[01:15:58.008 --> 01:15:58.448]  Thank you.
[01:16:20.646 --> 01:16:26.010]  But you know, there are other treatments in the alternative field that are so much more effective than those.
[01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:33.375]  One of those is where you have an external body purifier, you know, almost like a heart-lung machine.
[01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:39.720]  Basically, you take the blood out of the body, put it through an ultraviolet light in a machine, and then they put it right back into the body.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.542]  That's what all the rich people do, just as a regular monthly treatment.
[01:16:43.638 --> 01:16:44.458]  And it really works.
[01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:57.844]  You know, I had a daughter with MSRA, a real tough staff affection, and she took a couple of these treatments and it cleared right up when nothing in antibiotics in the typical medical establishment would do it.
[01:16:57.844 --> 01:17:01.326]  So, what I'm worried about, ultimately,
[01:17:02.199 --> 01:17:02.379]  Yes.
[01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:27.335]  It's very difficult to maintain a purity when you're developing a vaccine in a mass thing.
[01:17:27.335 --> 01:17:34.120]  I think that for the elite, they probably have some very carefully sterilized vaccines that they can take with some safety.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:45.030]  Well, just to back you up, it came out during the H1N1 that the German elite and even the top brass, as well as the British and the Chinese, had, quote, a clean vaccine made in limited lots for them.
[01:17:46.308 --> 01:17:48.849]  Yeah, and I think that's real and very possible.
[01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:59.075]  I mean, clearly, as you said, the vaccine immunology is a proven technology, but it has been a disaster in terms of mass vaccination of people.
[01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:06.659]  And clearly, the adjuvants that are put in there and the preservatives, the mercury and the other things in there are damaging to people.
[01:18:07.339 --> 01:18:08.761]  Especially young children.
[01:18:08.761 --> 01:18:15.807]  You know, I think anybody who survives an inoculation does so because their immune system is tough enough to fight it.
[01:18:15.807 --> 01:18:26.497]  But you start giving this stuff to children and young people and babies, worst of all, who don't have a developed immune system, and I think that's criminal in its difficulty.
[01:18:26.497 --> 01:18:30.962]  I'm not sure, Alex, if this is going to turn into a worldwide panic.
[01:18:31.642 --> 01:18:34.704]  I personally, my gut feeling is it's not.
[01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:46.372]  But it's going to get bad enough that it's going to engage a great deal of government propaganda, a great deal of government mandatory action, and get people conditioned for obeying those orders.
[01:18:46.372 --> 01:18:59.602]  And so, as I've said a long time, you know, if there was ever a need for people to prepare in advance for strategic relocation, whether it's even for a friend, you've got to get out of big cities, you've got to do self-quarantine.
[01:19:00.672 --> 01:19:13.469]  If these things are coming to pass, you can't go to church, you can't send your kids to school, and you don't go into a big office building because the amount of contamination that you can get there is significant.
[01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:18.173]  You have to watch this carefully.
[01:19:18.173 --> 01:19:22.154]  You don't bail out of your job just because of the potential.
[01:19:22.154 --> 01:19:35.819]  But when people start to show up ill in the community, and there's a chance that it could be near an office, you're going to have to establish a policy of taking a leave of absence, hoping that your employer will understand.
[01:19:35.819 --> 01:19:38.199]  But you've got to get rural and very rural.
[01:19:38.199 --> 01:19:39.340]  That's right.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.580]  Joe Skousen, stay there.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:44.622]  I want, because you're one of the leading experts in the world on this, even the other experts we have on
[01:19:45.962 --> 01:19:47.604]  to say that.
[01:19:47.604 --> 01:19:50.126]  And of course you have your Marine Corps training and the rest of it.
[01:19:50.126 --> 01:19:57.794]  I want to get your view on how this collapse would work, what a real airborne Ebola outbreak would look like, and the type of disruption it would cause.
[01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:58.235]  Stay with us.

[01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:30.014]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.
[01:21:30.374 --> 01:21:35.216]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:21:35.216 --> 01:21:36.996]  That means big savings.
[01:21:36.996 --> 01:21:41.438]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:21:59.801 --> 01:22:04.467]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[01:22:04.467 --> 01:22:15.042]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[01:22:16.804 --> 01:22:31.120]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell our 30-day non-GMO emergency food supply for only $99 as long as we can.

[01:22:59.526 --> 01:23:04.828]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[01:23:04.828 --> 01:23:06.849]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[01:23:06.849 --> 01:23:10.631]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:14.813]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[01:23:14.813 --> 01:23:21.535]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[01:23:21.535 --> 01:23:25.397]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[01:23:25.397 --> 01:23:26.938]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[01:23:28.919 --> 01:23:34.881]  Nanoparasites, termed viruses, infect the iron poison population, for they require a host with iron to replicate.
[01:23:34.881 --> 01:23:38.563]  Parasites are propagated via the food and water supply and through vaccinations.
[01:23:38.563 --> 01:23:43.024]  Those born after 1945 have the vaccine parasites set to activate now.
[01:23:43.024 --> 01:23:49.167]  Due to unprecedented iron intake, officials prepare for pandemics because they know the vaccine parasites are activating on a mass scale.
[01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:50.807]  This is the extermination plan, people.

[01:24:10.976 --> 01:24:13.217]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:15.759]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWarp.
[01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:20.022]  Short segment, long segment coming up where we'll get into a lot of issues with Joel Skousen.
[01:24:20.022 --> 01:24:22.944]  But Joel, I forgot to ask one question before we get into...
[01:24:24.878 --> 01:24:33.806]  What a real mutated Ebola, let's just say it happens naturally, would look like and how the powers that be would try to respond to that.
[01:24:33.806 --> 01:24:39.290]  We know they've been testing it for 30 years, manipulating it, trying to create cures for themselves.
[01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:42.653]  We know a lot of cures get warehoused.
[01:24:42.653 --> 01:24:45.276]  We know that they create a lot of secret vaccines for themselves.
[01:24:45.276 --> 01:24:50.981]  Again, that was in the news five, six years ago with the H1N1 that the headline, if you type it into Google, was something like,
[01:24:52.262 --> 01:25:01.012]  Uh, you know, German elite or top government officials in Germany have clean vaccine and that they have their own little special vaccines.
[01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:03.194]  We know that goes on, but why?
[01:25:04.392 --> 01:25:11.235]  Would the CDC bring people in that have Ebola for the first time ever and then put them in regular hospitals?
[01:25:11.235 --> 01:25:15.057]  Why would they send this guy's kids to school for a few days?
[01:25:15.057 --> 01:25:17.238]  Why would they not clean out the ambulance?
[01:25:17.238 --> 01:25:24.182]  Why would they not follow the containment that is already federal law and federal policy?
[01:25:24.182 --> 01:25:28.184]  Why would they ignore the default?
[01:25:28.184 --> 01:25:29.685]  Well, it's a tough question.
[01:25:29.685 --> 01:25:31.466]  I do think there's a great deal of
[01:25:32.964 --> 01:25:33.445]  I think?
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:52.425]  And people are scrambling.
[01:25:52.425 --> 01:25:58.535]  I mean, for example, the first hospital that Duncan showed up at, and his symptoms weren't high enough.
[01:25:58.535 --> 01:26:02.120]  You know, I think Duncan came into the country absolutely knowing he had Ebola.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.604]  He quit his job without telling anybody he was leaving.
[01:26:05.615 --> 01:26:10.679]  That indicated that there was some ulterior motive there in getting to the United States.
[01:26:10.679 --> 01:26:20.547]  I think he checks himself into the hospital there and his symptoms weren't developed enough to get a conclusive diagnosis, even though he was eager to tell them that I'd come from Liberia.
[01:26:20.547 --> 01:26:21.648]  Should have been a warning signal.
[01:26:22.188 --> 01:26:25.369]  But I think we're dealing with people who haven't got into this.
[01:26:25.369 --> 01:26:28.210]  They've been given some general instructions if there's a pandemic.
[01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:33.391]  But when it comes right down to it and you're facing with something, there's a little bit of denial.
[01:26:33.391 --> 01:26:34.911]  People aren't up to speed.
[01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:38.392]  It takes one of these big mistakes in order to get people on notice.
[01:26:38.392 --> 01:26:49.055]  So it's more of a learned helplessness that the system has engineered into Americans to be totally unself-sufficient, totally spectator-based, that people are just blindsided?
[01:26:49.895 --> 01:26:52.900]  And totally dependent and trusting on the medical establishment.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:58.088]  That is the biggest mistake people can make, is to trust the medical establishment that they know what they're doing.
[01:26:58.854 --> 01:27:17.577]  They have a built-in hostility towards natural cures, and while I'm the first to admit that these things are really tough bugs, and that I'm not saying that a natural cure, once you get fully developed, Ebola is going to save you, but it certainly will help, you know, make your immune system stronger if you prepare.
[01:27:17.577 --> 01:27:21.478]  There's lots of information on the Internet.
[01:27:21.478 --> 01:27:23.798]  Here's an issue that we need to really discuss, though, Alex.
[01:27:23.798 --> 01:27:26.639]  It's about the mutated forms that happen.
[01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:27.419]  It's very difficult.
[01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:28.343]  Thank you.
[01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:53.600]  is trying to get a mutated form by allowing this to spread widely among the population.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:01.984]  Exactly, that's what a lot of experts are saying is that, oh no, what if bad actors or terrorists get a hold of any of these people and get a mutated virus?
[01:28:01.984 --> 01:28:11.088]  Well, the CDC and the UN are in there with tens of thousands of patients getting blood samples and you know those are being sent off to the bioweapons labs.
[01:28:12.108 --> 01:28:12.548]  That's right.
[01:28:12.548 --> 01:28:14.050]  Now, here's what happens, though.
[01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:23.357]  Remember that if you're going to do a bioweapon and you're going to protect yourself as the elite with a special vaccine, you really have to wait to get to that mutated form.
[01:28:23.357 --> 01:28:24.478]  And they haven't got there yet.
[01:28:24.478 --> 01:28:26.779]  They haven't got to the totally airborne.
[01:28:26.779 --> 01:28:32.184]  And once they get to the airborne formable, they've got to then develop a vaccine specifically for that.
[01:28:32.964 --> 01:28:40.907]  So you see, if you're going to put something out now and you're going to expect it to mutate to be a more bioweapon effective thing, this isn't the time to do it.
[01:28:40.907 --> 01:28:51.271]  I think that's why I'm saying I'm not very confident this is going to turn into the worldwide pandemic because it is so far very difficult to transmit.
[01:28:51.271 --> 01:28:56.197]  Well, Joel, I agree with you because I've just studied the modus operandi of the scientific technocracy.
[01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.398]  That's my word for them.
[01:28:57.398 --> 01:29:02.585]  I want to get your word for them, is they do test things incrementally and then build up.
[01:29:02.585 --> 01:29:06.890]  Like their false flags get bigger and more complex each time.
[01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:08.772]  They like to try to organize things.
[01:29:08.772 --> 01:29:09.633]  They're very OCD.
[01:29:11.124 --> 01:29:15.286]  Yes, and I'll agree, Alex, and I think we're in this process of testing and probing.
[01:29:15.286 --> 01:29:16.546]  It's just like chemtrails.
[01:29:16.546 --> 01:29:20.888]  Chemtrails are very real, but they keep changing the pattern, changing the chemicals.
[01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:24.149]  They're trying to do something and not necessarily succeeding.
[01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:25.910]  That's why they gave up on HAARP.
[01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:28.951]  It wasn't interacting and augmenting the effect as
[01:29:29.571 --> 01:29:30.792]  Previously desired.
[01:29:30.792 --> 01:29:33.694]  That doesn't mean they're going to stop chemtrailing.
[01:29:33.694 --> 01:29:36.977]  And it doesn't mean they're going to stop experimenting with bioweapons.
[01:29:36.977 --> 01:29:43.702]  But as I say, this is a progressive threat to us that won't happen until they're fully protected.
[01:29:43.702 --> 01:29:45.523]  All right, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:47.825]  Get the book and film at infowars.com.
[01:29:47.825 --> 01:29:50.527]  We'll be back with what would happen during a real outbreak.
[01:29:50.527 --> 01:29:51.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.652 --> 01:30:04.795]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[01:30:04.795 --> 01:30:09.338]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:30:09.338 --> 01:30:15.862]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:30:15.862 --> 01:30:19.845]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:30:19.845 --> 01:30:21.506]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:21.506 --> 01:30:25.489]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[01:30:25.649 --> 01:30:34.334]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:30:34.334 --> 01:30:42.439]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[01:30:42.439 --> 01:30:46.101]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[01:30:46.101 --> 01:30:51.905]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at
[01:30:52.045 --> 01:30:55.453]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:00.942 --> 01:31:04.584]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:08.865]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:08.865 --> 01:31:10.666]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:10.666 --> 01:31:18.509]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:18.509 --> 01:31:19.650]  But for how long?
[01:31:19.650 --> 01:31:26.293]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:31:26.293 --> 01:31:29.114]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:31:30.478 --> 01:31:33.981]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:33.981 --> 01:31:42.227]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:42.227 --> 01:31:47.652]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:47.652 --> 01:31:50.174]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:50.174 --> 01:31:52.276]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:32:00.495 --> 01:32:01.756]  Another major health threat.
[01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:06.738]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:32:06.738 --> 01:32:09.399]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:16.442]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:16.442 --> 01:32:19.463]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:32:19.463 --> 01:32:22.484]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:32:22.484 --> 01:32:24.405]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:27.266]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:27.346 --> 01:32:33.069]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:32:33.069 --> 01:32:36.571]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:32:36.571 --> 01:32:39.672]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:32:39.672 --> 01:32:46.996]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:32:46.996 --> 01:32:50.198]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[01:32:50.198 --> 01:32:56.481]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[01:32:56.601 --> 01:33:13.275]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:13.275 --> 01:33:19.301]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:28.451]  We really are being culturally colonized.
[01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:32.092]  The private Federal Reserve is de-industrializing the nation.
[01:33:32.092 --> 01:33:34.793]  We really are an occupied country.
[01:33:34.793 --> 01:33:41.075]  And only realizing that do we ever have a chance to begin to retake the nation via the states.
[01:33:41.075 --> 01:33:50.198]  But as Joel Skousen has said, globalism is so evil, so scientific, so manipulative, that our weakness is its strength.
[01:33:50.198 --> 01:33:52.218]  Our decadence is its power.
[01:33:52.218 --> 01:33:53.719]  And I'm certainly not on some high horse here.
[01:33:55.310 --> 01:34:02.556]  And so everyone should start thinking about ways to survive in a collapsed society.
[01:34:02.556 --> 01:34:04.898]  And we're going to talk about that coming up with Joel.
[01:34:04.898 --> 01:34:06.879]  We're not being doom and gloom here.
[01:34:06.879 --> 01:34:11.183]  It's hard to sustain a civilization this complex to begin with.
[01:34:11.183 --> 01:34:19.729]  That's not debated by any anthropologist, sociologist, social planner, city planner, economist.
[01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:21.411]  The more complex, the more fragile.
[01:34:22.461 --> 01:34:33.553]  You add to that the artificiality of Agenda 21 and artificial scarcity to consolidate power by these groups.
[01:34:33.553 --> 01:34:38.278]  The West not having 2.1 children, that will cause a collapse in and of itself.
[01:34:38.278 --> 01:34:38.979]  You've got to have 2.1 people.
[01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:47.033]  For every two people that are already alive to just have social security and the social safety network work.
[01:34:47.033 --> 01:34:48.354]  They're not going that direction.
[01:34:48.354 --> 01:34:54.255]  They're going into a command, in their words, command destruction model.
[01:34:54.255 --> 01:35:10.038]  And the way they've engineered society, I see it as a bioweapon release down the road, or them allowing something to develop and then opening the door, a 12 monkey scenario, as one of the main tools they might pull instead of a nuclear war with Russia.
[01:35:10.779 --> 01:35:12.600]  Because all the preparations are being made for that.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:21.226]  So Joel, if you would, go through your view, looking at the U.S.
[01:35:21.226 --> 01:35:25.609]  first, but then other parts of the world, of what would happen if real airborne Ebola
[01:35:26.676 --> 01:35:31.057]  Went viral in West Africa, let's say three years from now.
[01:35:31.057 --> 01:35:38.620]  Or if this was to mutate and go airborne, what you would expect to see, because we're already seeing panicking with only two people in the U.S.
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.680]  known to have had it.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.081]  One dead, one alive.
[01:35:41.081 --> 01:35:44.061]  What would happen if thousands started to get it?
[01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:46.082]  What would happen if it went airborne?
[01:35:46.082 --> 01:35:52.024]  And what would someone who was prepared do versus someone who wasn't prepared?
[01:35:53.598 --> 01:35:59.061]  Well, the first thing that would happen, you would have mandatory quarantine happening.
[01:35:59.061 --> 01:36:04.865]  And even before a mass vaccination, it takes them a certain time to gear up.
[01:36:04.865 --> 01:36:10.248]  If, in fact, they show up with millions of doses of vaccine in advance, then you know it was planned.
[01:36:10.248 --> 01:36:17.132]  There has to be a period of time for them to develop a vaccine and to go forward with it if it's real.
[01:36:17.132 --> 01:36:21.475]  But in any case, mass quarantine is the major problem that you face because
[01:36:22.175 --> 01:36:30.203]  As this sheriff's deputy he came in down with some flu symptoms and he got labeled potentially Ebola and put into quarantine.
[01:36:30.203 --> 01:36:45.076]  Had this happened in a mass quarantine situation where a lot of people are coming down sick with it and you happen to have the flu or cold or fever or something and get tagged and put into a mass quarantine, you're going to get the Ebola because you're put into a quarantine with other people.
[01:36:46.155 --> 01:36:58.823]  And just like the Superdome during Katrina, you're not going to have the kind of facilities, I don't care what the CDC says, you can't have extremely controlled medical protocols in mass quarantine situations.
[01:36:58.823 --> 01:37:01.505]  It simply overwhelms the medical system.
[01:37:01.505 --> 01:37:04.647]  Even in Liberia, you know, they're already out of hospital beds.
[01:37:04.647 --> 01:37:06.508]  And how do you build more facilities?
[01:37:07.408 --> 01:37:10.751]  to handle the exponential increase in clients.
[01:37:10.751 --> 01:37:15.015]  So what happens is you have to carefully watch this.
[01:37:15.015 --> 01:37:18.478]  At the first hint, it's going to be mass quarantine.
[01:37:18.478 --> 01:37:20.820]  You have to get out of Dodge.
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:27.045]  You have to then implement your strategic relocation plans to get out into the rural areas.
[01:37:27.045 --> 01:37:31.048]  It's going to be in the urban areas where those mass quarantines occur.
[01:37:31.048 --> 01:37:34.111]  You just don't want to have the risk of being in one of those drag nets.
[01:37:34.927 --> 01:37:39.734]  Once it starts to go airborne, it will rapidly multiply.
[01:37:39.734 --> 01:37:45.021]  They're talking now about 2 to 1, meaning it's doubling for every patient infects 2 more.
[01:37:45.021 --> 01:37:51.309]  Well, that's really quite a slow infection rate compared to the Spanish flu when it was 10 and sometimes 20 to 1.
[01:37:53.018 --> 01:37:55.539]  Now, it never gets to the whole population.
[01:37:55.539 --> 01:38:12.307]  At least 30% of the population, at least from historical statistics, has a tough enough immune system that they won't get sick, even, and didn't during the Spanish Flu, as tough as that was, and probably won't get Ebola, even if it's airborne.
[01:38:12.307 --> 01:38:17.269]  The airborne strains are always a little bit weaker than the contact strains.
[01:38:17.269 --> 01:38:19.110]  So even though they spread more rapidly,
[01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:24.813]  They're a little bit weaker form and so probably going to be more survivable.
[01:38:24.813 --> 01:38:27.495]  But clearly, you don't want to get into the arms of government.
[01:38:27.495 --> 01:38:29.036]  You don't want to go into a FEMA camp.
[01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:33.578]  You don't want to go into a medical camp or quarantine if you can afford it.
[01:38:33.578 --> 01:38:39.982]  Now, if you do get Ebola, real Ebola, you want to do self-quarantine and you keep yourself away from your family.
[01:38:39.982 --> 01:38:44.405]  You have to have provisions for that as well so that you don't infect other people.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.482]  Joel, though, entertain me for a moment.
[01:38:49.482 --> 01:38:52.004]  What would an airborne outbreak look like?
[01:38:52.004 --> 01:38:56.507]  What would that do to this civilization?
[01:38:56.507 --> 01:39:02.051]  It depends on how fast it replicates itself among other people.
[01:39:02.051 --> 01:39:12.359]  If it's a thing where one student comes in and all of a sudden half of the school is down with the illness and then the next week the rest of the school is down with the illness,
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.941]  That's going to be mass panic.
[01:39:14.941 --> 01:39:18.204]  I mean, people are going to be leaving the city in droves.
[01:39:18.204 --> 01:39:23.868]  They're going to be, without any preparations, they're going to be doing a strategic relocation.
[01:39:23.868 --> 01:39:26.330]  And that's what would happen in a mass panic situation.
[01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:32.155]  It would be the same thing happening as an EMP strike when you don't have electricity or food services.
[01:39:32.155 --> 01:39:33.576]  It could be devastating.
[01:39:33.576 --> 01:39:34.396]  Now, typically,
[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:36.950]  It doesn't happen that rapidly.
[01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:40.271]  Typically, it grows slowly enough.
[01:39:40.271 --> 01:39:46.773]  In other words, it starts with 1 in 3, then 1 in 5, and then 1 in 10, in terms of multiples.
[01:39:46.773 --> 01:39:54.575]  And at the point it gets to 1 in 10, the government is starting to put in mass quarantines and camps and other things.
[01:39:54.575 --> 01:40:03.798]  I think they'd love to do that, to have the excuse to build camps that can be used for other purposes in some future time, once the infection wears itself out.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:22.431]  But it's really impossible to tell, except to say, according to the speed, I predict that it would at least get to the point where the government would do mass people control and containment control strategies, which is devastating to your liberty, devastating to your rights.
[01:40:22.431 --> 01:40:29.856]  And that does give you time, however, to see the handwriting on the wall and say, I'm getting out of town now before I get stuck in one of those quarantine camps.
[01:40:30.359 --> 01:40:38.990]  Well, my gut, my instinct is, and I do have a little place out in the country, but, is to get even further out in the country, but I'm here in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:40.478 --> 01:40:43.901]  Trying to put on a defense of what's left of freedom.
[01:40:43.901 --> 01:40:55.192]  But at the same time, we need to divide our energies into fighting to restore the Republic, fighting to warn people worldwide, but also preparing ourselves.
[01:40:55.192 --> 01:41:02.559]  Because if folks that are aware of this information aren't somewhat prepared, then we're not going to be around at the end of this.
[01:41:03.952 --> 01:41:07.174]  When the UN and others come in and try to take control of society.
[01:41:07.174 --> 01:41:15.777]  But if we do have groups spread out in the countryside and other areas, those will end up being areas of stability into the future, as you've said, Joel.
[01:41:15.777 --> 01:41:16.638]  Well, that's right, Alex.
[01:41:16.638 --> 01:41:20.400]  You know, I've spoken to a lot of people around the nation like you have.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:27.883]  And the thing that worries me about our own constitutional conservative group is you get people talking about the positivism.
[01:41:27.883 --> 01:41:29.223]  We're going to restore the Constitution.
[01:41:29.223 --> 01:41:30.404]  We're going to beat this.
[01:41:30.404 --> 01:41:32.065]  When we get rid of Obama, we're going to win this.
[01:41:32.845 --> 01:41:38.148]  And this I'm going to win mentality is antithetical towards preparation.
[01:41:38.148 --> 01:41:40.389]  They just aren't preparing.
[01:41:40.389 --> 01:41:45.331]  One of the most ill-prepared groups are those that think that they're going to win this battle politically.
[01:41:45.331 --> 01:41:47.072]  Now, I'm not saying whether or not we are.
[01:41:48.573 --> 01:41:55.638]  Frankly, given the power of the globalists and the conspiracy that I see, I think it's unlikely that we're going to win as a nation.
[01:41:55.638 --> 01:42:02.724]  Doesn't mean that the Lord won't provide pockets of liberty for us, but we've got to survive the nuclear war that's coming.
[01:42:02.724 --> 01:42:06.206]  We've got to survive the pandemic that's coming.
[01:42:06.206 --> 01:42:11.110]  If you haven't prepared well in advance, these are preparations that you can't just do on the fly.
[01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:14.392]  It takes significant preparation in advance to do that.
[01:42:14.392 --> 01:42:15.993]  And like you, I'm afraid,
[01:42:17.254 --> 01:42:21.235]  As I say, as we prepare to fight for our liberty, we still have to prepare.
[01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:38.261]  You know, the kind of preparations that you and I have to do, Alex, in order to maintain a lifeline, I'm preparing to be able, through electronic or even radio means, to transmit my writing of brief if I have to go into seclusion, and have people who can then transmit that.
[01:42:38.261 --> 01:42:40.742]  And I think everyone who's got a mission in life
[01:42:41.956 --> 01:42:50.482]  Or is a target in life, like you and I are, have to prepare to be able to keep being effective even when you're kind of having to be underground?
[01:42:50.482 --> 01:43:04.873]  I want to shift gears before we look at geopolitical issues into further afield, not just the global crime syndicate, the globalist, the Anglo-American system, but the Russian power bloc, the Chinese power bloc,
[01:43:06.287 --> 01:43:16.190]  Some of the other sub-crime syndicates out there, or you look at a billion, 300 million Chinese, that's a giant laboratory right there of different mutations.
[01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:26.994]  We can see something naturally obviously mutate, and I don't know how the establishment would deal with that, but who else is out there that you're worried about?
[01:43:26.994 --> 01:43:30.115]  Who else might want to create some type of bioweapon?
[01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:35.312]  Well, I really think there are only three major predator centers.
[01:43:35.312 --> 01:43:48.419]  There's the Anglo-American globalists, there's Russia and there's China, and Russia and China are temporarily aligned in order to take down the West, and then they intend to tackle each other.
[01:43:48.419 --> 01:43:51.521]  They all have very active bioweapon programs.
[01:43:51.521 --> 01:43:55.403]  None of them seem to be experimenting on their own people, however.
[01:43:55.403 --> 01:44:00.686]  This seems to be only endemic to the unprincipled Anglo-American globalists.
[01:44:01.406 --> 01:44:09.033]  And of course they pick on the Filipinos as they did with that abortificant doped vaccine that they gave women in the Philippines.
[01:44:09.033 --> 01:44:10.535]  They pick on the Africans.
[01:44:10.535 --> 01:44:12.637]  They feel those are dispensable.
[01:44:15.706 --> 01:44:17.187]  So I think that's still preliminary.
[01:44:17.187 --> 01:44:29.417]  The fact that they are picking on these what they consider dispensable low-life populations indicates that they aren't yet ready to attack at least pandemic-wise the major ones.
[01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:31.499]  But I really don't see any other
[01:44:32.239 --> 01:44:33.820]  Predator forms out there.
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:42.022]  I don't think, in fact, even the mafia, these small criminal elements, most of those have some ties to governments that keep them in power.
[01:44:42.022 --> 01:44:48.164]  Sure, that's what Brzezinski's written a bunch of books on that, that they really allow the big syndicates to operate and launder their money for the big banks.
[01:44:48.164 --> 01:44:49.965]  That's even come out in Bloomberg.
[01:44:49.965 --> 01:44:55.787]  Hundreds of billions a year being laundered through Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and the like.
[01:44:55.787 --> 01:44:57.367]  Let me bring up this issue.
[01:44:57.367 --> 01:45:01.009]  How do you describe the most dominant power group, the Anglo-Americans,
[01:45:02.009 --> 01:45:10.255]  How do you describe their mindset, their vision from their writings, from your uncle's writings, Cleon Skousen, from your deep research?
[01:45:10.255 --> 01:45:13.358]  Because if you're a new listener, Joel Skousen is extremely well-read.
[01:45:13.358 --> 01:45:16.140]  I am extremely well-read and I learn stuff from him all the time.
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:19.482]  So he really does know what he's talking about with a lot of gravitas.
[01:45:19.482 --> 01:45:20.343]  So I want to get your view.
[01:45:20.343 --> 01:45:25.067]  From my research, at the top, they really are a scientific, eugenics-based,
[01:45:26.198 --> 01:45:39.891]  Cult believing that they're going to become God and merge with the machines and colonize space and that through this transcendence to this super sapien that the rest of us are profane and must be destroyed and die.
[01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:45.056]  So it's almost like a counterfeit of what God does saying he'll test us all on the planet and get his elect.
[01:45:45.056 --> 01:45:47.078]  Well they're saying we'll do it right here right now.
[01:45:47.939 --> 01:45:51.162]  And that's really who they are and what they're setting up.
[01:45:51.162 --> 01:45:55.446]  And I wanted to ask you, how many people do you think they've recruited into their cult?
[01:45:55.446 --> 01:46:04.794]  Because it's well known that David Rockefeller and others personally would go around to get the people with the highest test scores in college and recruit them into their organizations.
[01:46:04.794 --> 01:46:08.798]  My dad had some of the highest test scores across the board in Texas, and they tried to recruit him.
[01:46:08.798 --> 01:46:11.020]  It wasn't David Rockefeller, but it was the head of the botany department.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:24.245]  And that's why my dad would read John Birch Society stuff and knew how accurate it was, was because he was politically active, conservative, top of his class, and so they tried to recruit him.
[01:46:24.245 --> 01:46:25.786]  He was a junior in high school.
[01:46:25.786 --> 01:46:34.249]  We're point blank with him about some of the larger ideas, and you're going to be part of the scientific elite, and eugenics is bad with Hitler, but ours is a good eugenics.
[01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:40.312]  I mean the fact that even my dad was attempted to be brought into this, it must just be massive.
[01:46:40.312 --> 01:46:43.474]  How many people are part of the conspiracy and what is it?
[01:46:43.474 --> 01:46:44.034]  Who are they?
[01:46:45.216 --> 01:46:49.078]  Well, you know, the brain trust that they bring in, they always keep at lower levels.
[01:46:49.078 --> 01:46:55.061]  I don't know anybody in ever the scientific community within these that ever gets higher than second level.
[01:46:55.061 --> 01:47:07.567]  And the second level by mean people like Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski, Berent Scowcroft, Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbot, those national security advisors who manage and run presidents and call the shots.
[01:47:07.567 --> 01:47:13.810]  Henry Kissinger may well have moved into, you know, top areas like, top echelons like David Rockefeller.
[01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:24.412]  But clearly, I don't see them at the highest level as running this on a scientific basis, trying to manage the world themselves.
[01:47:24.412 --> 01:47:31.654]  Everything that the globalists tend to do is counter to anything that the most wealthy elite would normally do.
[01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:31.974]  What?
[01:47:31.974 --> 01:47:37.876]  Bring a nuclear strike against your own nation, destroying the very power base of your money?
[01:47:37.876 --> 01:47:43.077]  No one in their right mind who has solely the motivation, the power, greed, wine, women's
[01:47:45.471 --> 01:47:51.554]  And numerous locations around the world to vacation would do that to themselves.
[01:47:51.554 --> 01:48:12.523]  I think these people, the only thing that really explains their motive is, as you said, they are trying to escape the judgments of God, they've made a pact with Satan, and I think that it's revelatory from dark spiritual forces to these higher elite, probably less than a hundred at the most, that understand that satanic connection.
[01:48:13.203 --> 01:48:14.965]  But, you know, this has a generational effect.
[01:48:14.965 --> 01:48:28.416]  It's been going on for centuries, as you know, Alex, and there's no man who can project 200 years in advance a plan so diabolical as the globalists have done and expect it to be followed through.
[01:48:28.416 --> 01:48:32.800]  The mafia can't handle something through two generations, let alone three.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.682]  Not speaking of, you know, two centuries.
[01:48:34.682 --> 01:48:36.363]  And so it has to be revelatory.
[01:48:36.363 --> 01:48:38.265]  It has to be guided.
[01:48:38.265 --> 01:48:40.727]  And, you know, I think that there is not only
[01:48:41.511 --> 01:48:52.758]  The motivation of immunity that's given to people, and certainly Bill Clinton acted in the presidency as if he had total immunity, and so does Barack Obama for that matter.
[01:48:54.033 --> 01:48:56.716]  So that's how I think the thing operates.
[01:48:56.716 --> 01:49:12.035]  It operates on a satanic revelatory basis promising them that if you help me become the god of this world, I'll protect you not only in this earth from immunity, but in the life to come from the judgments of God.
[01:49:12.896 --> 01:49:22.002]  And that's of course the Faustian story, and at Bohemian Grove, the entire ritual that I caught on video, also Skull and Bones, has been caught.
[01:49:22.002 --> 01:49:32.869]  It's all about escaping judgment, and when I was standing with over a thousand wealthy men, movie stars, bank heads, former vice presidents, you name it, were there, they were
[01:49:33.929 --> 01:49:39.052]  More religiously in rapture than anything I've ever seen go into a Baptist church as a kid.
[01:49:39.052 --> 01:49:45.597]  I mean, they were really believed they were being given atonement and shielding from what they'd done on this earth.
[01:49:45.597 --> 01:49:46.737]  And they say that.
[01:49:46.737 --> 01:49:52.161]  The high priest, that was Walter Cronkite at the time, he's now dead, literally says this.
[01:49:52.161 --> 01:49:54.282]  The whole ritual is on video, folks.
[01:49:54.282 --> 01:50:01.027]  In my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, it's been on HBO, it's been on Trio Channel, it's been on Sundance Film Channel.
[01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:02.147]  I mean, this is real.
[01:50:04.755 --> 01:50:09.519]  For somebody like me, I was kind of giggling a little bit, and they looked at me like they wanted to kill me.
[01:50:09.519 --> 01:50:14.222]  They were so serious, Joel.
[01:50:14.222 --> 01:50:15.223]  Well, that's incredible.
[01:50:15.223 --> 01:50:19.306]  I think you did the world a great service by infiltrating the Bohemian Grove.
[01:50:19.306 --> 01:50:21.187]  We'll be forever grateful.
[01:50:21.187 --> 01:50:30.274]  But I think it's important to realize that very few people could handle that kind of knowledge that this is satanic in its orientation.
[01:50:30.274 --> 01:50:33.377]  People get very heavy, very corrupted, and higher up
[01:50:34.057 --> 01:50:36.439]  They'll do anything to maintain their position.
[01:50:36.439 --> 01:50:41.202]  They also know that people get eliminated when they get cold feet and they start to talk.
[01:50:41.202 --> 01:50:43.944]  And so that also keeps them in line.
[01:50:43.944 --> 01:50:49.068]  But most people are brought in, just like the scientific community, to do mind control experience.
[01:50:49.068 --> 01:50:51.490]  They're told there's some beneficial aspect.
[01:50:51.490 --> 01:50:52.170]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:52.170 --> 01:50:53.291]  Injustifies the means.
[01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:53.731]  Stay there.
[01:50:53.731 --> 01:50:56.053]  Joel Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com.

[01:51:30.043 --> 01:51:34.105]  You've forgotten to monitor BlocketPocket.com, haven't you?
[01:51:34.105 --> 01:51:36.727]  Oh, how quickly we forget.

[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:02.841]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:07.001]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:08.302]  What are you doing to prepare?
[01:52:08.302 --> 01:52:12.162]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[01:52:12.162 --> 01:52:13.723]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[01:52:13.723 --> 01:52:15.123]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[01:52:15.123 --> 01:52:25.125]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008, the too-big-to-fail banks are much larger, and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of
[01:52:25.145 --> 01:52:25.505]  I think so.
[01:52:47.145 --> 01:52:49.729]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:52.534]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[01:52:52.534 --> 01:52:53.836]  That's babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[01:52:59.184 --> 01:53:00.445]  Another major health threat.
[01:53:00.445 --> 01:53:05.429]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:53:05.429 --> 01:53:08.112]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:53:08.112 --> 01:53:15.138]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:53:15.138 --> 01:53:18.140]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:21.183]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:53:21.183 --> 01:53:23.104]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:53:23.104 --> 01:53:25.967]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:53:26.067 --> 01:53:31.751]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:53:31.751 --> 01:53:35.254]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:53:35.254 --> 01:53:38.356]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:53:38.356 --> 01:53:42.619]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:53:42.779 --> 01:53:45.663]  For every modern independently minded household.

[01:54:00.868 --> 01:54:04.732]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:54:04.732 --> 01:54:07.374]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:54:07.374 --> 01:54:17.865]  And Joel Skousen has agreed to stay with us 20 minutes in the next hour so we can take a few questions, specific questions for Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:54:17.865 --> 01:54:19.366]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[01:54:20.407 --> 01:54:26.249]  Again, the film, Strategic Relocation, that I produced with Joel Skousen, is a complimentary film.
[01:54:26.249 --> 01:54:40.573]  It complements Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places, third edition, that just has incredibly accurate information in it, from just the areas I've been in and lived in around the country, just amazingly accurate.
[01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:43.614]  And I've talked to other people that live in different parts of the world or the country.
[01:54:43.614 --> 01:54:49.156]  He's just done unparalleled research and intelligence, all available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:54:50.643 --> 01:54:55.566]  You can also call 888-253-3139 to order via the telephone.
[01:54:55.566 --> 01:54:57.667]  We can answer all your questions.
[01:54:57.667 --> 01:55:05.431]  And then separately, I personally for my immune system and my health, I'm taking survival shield, nascent iodine X2.
[01:55:05.431 --> 01:55:11.174]  Almost everybody out there is deficient in iodine and it just does so much in the body when you don't have it.
[01:55:12.174 --> 01:55:12.374]  I think?
[01:55:34.745 --> 01:55:38.326]  Bio PQQ and CoQ10 and so much more.
[01:55:38.326 --> 01:55:42.767]  A true nutraceutical, the oxy powder to flush out your intestines.
[01:55:42.767 --> 01:55:50.948]  It's all available at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:55:50.948 --> 01:55:59.250]  Joel, getting back into the spiritual nature of this, I grew up in the richest county in Texas outside Dallas.
[01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:01.750]  It was the richest county in Texas at the time, Rockwall.
[01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:04.051]  And I ended up knowing some of the kids of billionaires.
[01:56:05.029 --> 01:56:05.790]  Real Billionaires!
[01:56:26.345 --> 01:56:46.908]  But when you talk about Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, you talk about world leaders in rapture doing mock human sacrifices and believing that it atones them and that some goddess that they're praying to is going to remove their sins and protect them from what they've done and they put it on the body of this child that they're killing and burning just like they did in
[01:56:47.802 --> 01:56:51.047]  Leviticus, they say, give not your children the fires of Molech.
[01:56:51.047 --> 01:56:53.912]  They really are at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:56:53.912 --> 01:56:56.155]  It really is a satanic conspiracy.
[01:56:56.155 --> 01:56:58.139]  A few minutes on that and your research into it.
[01:56:59.994 --> 01:57:12.219]  Well, you know, there is some of that that is attributed just to satanic inspiration that talks to people's minds, you know, that drives them to suicide and dark thoughts and other weird type of things.
[01:57:12.219 --> 01:57:16.601]  But at the higher levels, the Faustian pact really is real.
[01:57:16.601 --> 01:57:21.603]  I mean, Satan does reveal himself to certain people who are susceptible, who leave them.
[01:57:21.603 --> 01:57:24.125]  I mean, this doesn't happen to anybody who's just trying to do the right thing.
[01:57:24.125 --> 01:57:27.026]  You've got to actually be actively seeking power.
[01:57:27.026 --> 01:57:29.247]  You've got to be seeking to get ahead in the world.
[01:57:30.147 --> 01:57:50.635]  You know, in my opinion, you take several of these, and there's been several books written on this about the New Age cults and relationship to the rock stars and who became rock stars and the dark agenda behind it, and there seems to be a revelatory agenda there that, you know, if you tie into my system, I will make you famous.
[01:57:50.635 --> 01:57:57.458]  I'll drive into your mind, you know, melodies that will become popular that will make you a star, and it happens.
[01:57:58.438 --> 01:58:05.102]  You take Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, it's filled with satanic, dark dreams.
[01:58:05.102 --> 01:58:13.268]  And they make Satan basically the image of the hero, trying to get recognition, making him the victim of discrimination.
[01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:26.215]  If there's ever a revelatory image of Satan trying to make it in this world, to dethrone God, and to become the hero, it's the theme in the Phantom of the Opera.
[01:58:26.215 --> 01:58:39.022]  And I can't help but think, when I look at the fact that many of those musical themes in the opera have been stolen from other pieces of music before, and the rest... Hold on, hold on, this is powerful.
[01:58:39.022 --> 01:58:40.163]  Joel Skousen's our guest.
[01:58:40.163 --> 01:58:41.403]  He's gonna stay with us.
[01:58:41.403 --> 01:58:43.384]  See how long he can stay in the next hour and take calls.
[01:58:43.384 --> 01:58:44.265]  See how long he wants to stay.
[01:58:44.706 --> 01:58:46.713]  Third hour, tell your friends and family to tune in.
[01:58:46.713 --> 01:58:47.396]  This is important.
[01:58:50.805 --> 01:58:54.468]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:58:54.468 --> 01:58:58.751]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:58:58.751 --> 01:59:00.532]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:00.532 --> 01:59:08.397]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:59:08.397 --> 01:59:09.538]  But for how long?
[01:59:09.538 --> 01:59:16.183]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:59:16.183 --> 01:59:18.985]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:59:20.325 --> 01:59:23.827]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:59:23.827 --> 01:59:32.072]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:32.072 --> 01:59:37.495]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:37.495 --> 01:59:40.017]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:40.017 --> 01:59:42.138]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:55.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:06.566]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:07.866]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.866 --> 02:00:09.647]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.647 --> 02:00:11.408]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.408 --> 02:00:12.989]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.989 --> 02:00:14.530]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:18.732]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.732 --> 02:00:22.814]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.639 --> 02:00:39.142]  When you turn on... Because I'll be honest with you, even ten years ago, I'm a Christian, but I didn't believe this was as widespread as it is, even though I'd run into it as a teenager.
[02:00:39.142 --> 02:00:46.144]  When you turn on MTV or the NFL and it's a full-on Egyptian ritual or satanic ritual...
[02:00:47.421 --> 02:01:02.111]  When you say it's satanic, they say, oh, you're a conspiracy terrorist, and they're teaching it in school, and the UN and others are persecuting Christians worldwide and bending over backwards, even when it hurts their own interests to wipe them out.
[02:01:02.111 --> 02:01:05.053]  And then you've got the infiltration of the major churches by the state.
[02:01:06.491 --> 02:01:17.558]  I think that's the most powerful testament out there, Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com, is that the world is persecuting real Christianity anywhere it's found.
[02:01:17.558 --> 02:01:18.159]  Why is that?
[02:01:20.151 --> 02:01:28.777]  Well, I think there is both a direct satanic agenda, a revelatory agenda to the globalists persecuting Christians.
[02:01:28.777 --> 02:01:30.999]  They view that as the enemy.
[02:01:30.999 --> 02:01:37.784]  And then there's that inspirational view that even people who aren't directly involved get
[02:01:39.545 --> 02:01:49.551]  The more you get involved with sin and alternative lifestyles and things that go against God's commandments, the more susceptible you become to those types of inspirations.
[02:01:49.551 --> 02:02:01.157]  And so, obviously, a lot of these people who are involved in a dark or a new age or a satanic agenda don't absolutely know it's satanic.
[02:02:01.157 --> 02:02:03.419]  They've already dumbed down their conscience.
[02:02:03.419 --> 02:02:05.280]  They're filled with chronic bad judgment.
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.422]  And what speaks to their mind is often satanic inspiration.
[02:02:10.422 --> 02:02:13.063]  So they get down a path and it's very hard to come back.
[02:02:13.063 --> 02:02:26.868]  It's amazing to read some of the books on the New Age conspiracy and how people get trapped into that and the few that have come out of that have given some very good descriptions of how you slowly get down into that area and it's hard to come back.
[02:02:27.288 --> 02:02:45.419]  And of course, you know, mind-altering drugs, Prozac and others, which dulls the divine center of conscience, has a great deal of effect in helping American people, or youth especially, who are on these drugs, get tied in with some alternate inspiration that is not good.
[02:02:46.678 --> 02:02:54.402]  Well, the Bible talks about how the magicians, the occultists, would use pharmakia to open themselves up to this.
[02:02:54.402 --> 02:03:00.445]  And you look at how the system pushes these drugs that are in the hallucinogenic family on the public.
[02:03:00.445 --> 02:03:02.766]  The general public is under a trance.
[02:03:02.766 --> 02:03:04.487]  I don't know how we break them out of it, Joel.
[02:03:06.707 --> 02:03:08.390]  Yeah, it's tough.
[02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:12.495]  One of the things, obviously, you don't get in public schools is discipline.
[02:03:12.495 --> 02:03:15.800]  You don't get any reminders about the workings of conscience.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.424]  Those are the only salvation morally in the nation.
[02:03:18.424 --> 02:03:21.548]  Unfortunately, as you pointed out, our churches have become so soft.
[02:03:22.509 --> 02:03:32.976]  Soft-pedaling the gospel, soft-pedaling politics, everything is feel-good, social networking and friendship in our Christian societies.
[02:03:32.976 --> 02:03:38.259]  We really need to alert and train youth from the youth up about the working subconscious.
[02:03:38.259 --> 02:03:46.024]  And I'm talking about the two major signals, the nervous feelings when something's not quite right, that's telling you to pull out, do something different, or the
[02:03:46.724 --> 02:04:07.348]  Pushing feelings the promptings to do something especially when you don't feel like it You know if I had known those two signals and been able to really relate to them as a teenager I would have got better grades wouldn't got into trouble, you know with my peers It's amazing how every time I made a mistake in my youth I had a warning in conscience before and I can go back and remember that I had a warning and
[02:04:07.948 --> 02:04:10.130]  That's what we need to train our youth in.
[02:04:10.130 --> 02:04:13.633]  It's not just catechism.
[02:04:13.633 --> 02:04:17.056]  It's not memorizing a systematic way to be good.
[02:04:17.056 --> 02:04:21.520]  It's listening to the voice of conscience, tying into that divine source of inspiration.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.042]  And that voice is never wrong.
[02:04:24.042 --> 02:04:31.469]  I realize in my life now that I'm always bucking against that voice, and the more I just go with it, I mean, that's the answer right there.
[02:04:31.469 --> 02:04:34.512]  How could people ignore something that powerful that's always right?
[02:04:35.782 --> 02:04:41.165]  Well, it's interesting, because it is a still, small voice, as the Bible says.
[02:04:41.165 --> 02:04:43.026]  It's not a shouting, screaming voice.
[02:04:43.026 --> 02:04:44.947]  It's a tiny whisper.
[02:04:44.947 --> 02:04:46.728]  And it's so easy to disregard.
[02:04:46.728 --> 02:04:50.450]  And that's why it also takes a great deal of self-control.
[02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.990]  Stay there.
[02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.450]  Incredible.
[02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:53.031]  A short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:04:53.031 --> 02:04:57.774]  I want to talk about that still voice, that quiet place at the most high.
[02:05:01.596 --> 02:05:08.238]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.238 --> 02:05:13.380]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:22.103]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.103 --> 02:05:24.444]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:24.444 --> 02:05:28.525]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.475 --> 02:05:35.197]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:35.197 --> 02:05:39.038]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:05:39.038 --> 02:05:40.278]  Others don't.
[02:05:40.278 --> 02:05:42.419]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.419 --> 02:05:44.200]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:47.081]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:47.081 --> 02:05:53.703]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.703 --> 02:05:56.404]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.404 --> 02:05:58.785]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:05:58.785 --> 02:05:59.645]  Others don't.
[02:06:01.167 --> 02:06:07.335]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:06:07.335 --> 02:06:11.901]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:06:11.901 --> 02:06:16.467]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:06:16.867 --> 02:06:19.790]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:25.235]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:06:25.235 --> 02:06:32.642]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:06:32.642 --> 02:06:36.766]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:06:36.766 --> 02:06:41.550]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:50.494]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:06:50.494 --> 02:06:54.756]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:07:00.558 --> 02:07:07.721]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:07.721 --> 02:07:10.062]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:10.062 --> 02:07:15.345]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:15.345 --> 02:07:20.287]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:20.507 --> 02:07:23.828]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:23.828 --> 02:07:27.909]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:27.909 --> 02:07:32.230]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:32.230 --> 02:07:42.453]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:42.453 --> 02:07:44.974]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:45.174 --> 02:07:53.384]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:53.384 --> 02:07:57.369]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:22.858]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:22.858 --> 02:08:28.040]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:29.761]  With Joel Skousen.
[02:08:29.761 --> 02:08:31.261]  I'm going to give the number out.
[02:08:31.261 --> 02:08:33.422]  He's agreed to stay with us through the entire hour.
[02:08:33.422 --> 02:08:36.903]  We'll start taking your phone calls actually in the next segment.
[02:08:36.903 --> 02:08:42.085]  Your specific question or comment directed at Joel Skousen, that's the topic that we're covering.
[02:08:42.085 --> 02:08:44.506]  It is a huge topic of preparedness, Ebola.
[02:08:46.261 --> 02:08:56.164]  Satanism being at the heart of this craven energy of destructiveness in the world system.
[02:08:56.164 --> 02:09:00.625]  Why have so many elites done things that are self-destructive in the end?
[02:09:00.625 --> 02:09:05.646]  Well, even if you don't believe in a physical God or a physical devil, the elite does.
[02:09:05.646 --> 02:09:15.829]  And so through humans' capacity to build things and to manifest things, it's real whether you believe it's real or not, because it's going on in the world.
[02:09:17.133 --> 02:09:39.455]  And I cannot tell you in my deep research over 20 plus years, 20 years on air, or like 25 years of research, that the bottom of the rabbit hole, every time, you could call it a they live conspiracy, whatever, the elites believe that they are channeling off-world intelligences.
[02:09:40.717 --> 02:09:43.819]  And it fits the entity we read about in the Bible.
[02:09:43.819 --> 02:09:46.720]  And quite frankly, it pops up in a lot of other cultures as well.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:53.904]  But most of those cultures end up following it, and it always says, build a pyramid and throw kids into a fiery pit.
[02:09:53.904 --> 02:10:08.272]  I mean, what is that, some genetic anomaly that whether it was Druids, or whether it was Aztecs, or other Mesoamericans in the Mayan culture, or whether it was ancient Chinese culture, they find human sacrifices, or they find human sacrifice all over Africa?
[02:10:10.914 --> 02:10:12.756]  What is going on here?
[02:10:12.756 --> 02:10:14.638]  What is manifesting?
[02:10:14.638 --> 02:10:18.341]  But notice the world doesn't want you to discuss that.
[02:10:18.341 --> 02:10:25.628]  And, you know, Joel is a former Marine Corps officer, fighter pilot, Vietnam, best-selling author.
[02:10:25.628 --> 02:10:29.873]  He's a very conservative guy in his own right.
[02:10:29.873 --> 02:10:32.996]  But he's saying at the bottom of the rabbit hole is this satanic conspiracy.
[02:10:34.184 --> 02:10:37.825]  And the atheists get so mad when you raise that.
[02:10:37.825 --> 02:10:47.428]  Well, listen, I'm sorry, as an anthropologist, if I was an anthropologist, or a sociologist, there aren't really any atheist leaders.
[02:10:47.428 --> 02:10:53.429]  It turns out Lenin was incredibly superstitious and into astrology and the occult.
[02:10:53.429 --> 02:10:54.410]  Stalin was.
[02:10:54.410 --> 02:11:01.011]  Hitler was obsessed with it and believed he was conjuring Norse gods to give him power.
[02:11:01.011 --> 02:11:02.592]  I mean, that's in the mainline literature.
[02:11:04.155 --> 02:11:07.156]  They were doing human sacrifice at the SS Castle.
[02:11:07.156 --> 02:11:09.817]  I mean, just bizarre stuff.
[02:11:09.817 --> 02:11:12.838]  Look at the black uniforms, the death.
[02:11:12.838 --> 02:11:14.339]  Every culture ends up doing this.
[02:11:14.339 --> 02:11:21.501]  And Joel, I want you to spend some time, because we never really do this, on what is at the bottom of the rabbit hole and how we pull the curtain back.
[02:11:21.501 --> 02:11:24.943]  Because do you get my point that even if somebody doesn't believe in this,
[02:11:26.034 --> 02:11:38.263]  As sociologists or anthropologists, we can research the fact that elites are obsessed with dark gods that demand blood and that destroy civilizations.
[02:11:38.263 --> 02:11:39.104]  Why is that?
[02:11:45.288 --> 02:11:50.754]  Kind of the poison that Satan puts out upon the earth to protect himself.
[02:11:50.754 --> 02:11:56.020]  Just as if we find in the media you are not allowed to bring up the subject of conspiracy.
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:03.508]  Even nominally conservative organizations like Fox News, O'Reilly, Hannity will come out and crucify you.
[02:12:04.088 --> 02:12:09.733]  If you mention conspiracy, or they even hint you're heading in that direction, which to me shows that they're on the other side.
[02:12:09.733 --> 02:12:12.955]  They're not just Rhino Republicans.
[02:12:12.955 --> 02:12:16.879]  They're actually on the other side masquerading as conservatives.
[02:12:16.879 --> 02:12:21.162]  But in the same sense, you look at the psychological profession.
[02:12:21.162 --> 02:12:33.012]  Psychiatrists cannot possibly help you in any great degree with mental problems because they are taught to deny the two most primal things that have to do with errant
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:35.340]  Mental behavior.
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:40.022]  They deny any discussion of your interaction with conscience.
[02:12:40.022 --> 02:12:44.843]  They'll never ask you, you know, what kind of signals you get for conscience, how you're interacting with it.
[02:12:44.843 --> 02:12:46.403]  They don't believe in conscience.
[02:12:46.403 --> 02:12:50.764]  They don't believe in divine inspiration or even satanic inspiration.
[02:12:50.764 --> 02:12:53.185]  And also they don't believe in the innateness of the soul.
[02:12:54.165 --> 02:13:02.827]  And what I mean by that is that we each come to earth with innate proclivities built in, hardwired, not genetically, not biologically.
[02:13:02.827 --> 02:13:03.908]  It's a spiritual thing.
[02:13:03.908 --> 02:13:09.189]  It comes from the spirit that comes from before we live.
[02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:10.790]  My mother had 10 children.
[02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:20.652]  Every one of us children had a different spirit, same parents, same environment, same biology, same DNA, completely different children.
[02:13:20.652 --> 02:13:22.073]  That's innateness.
[02:13:22.073 --> 02:13:22.833]  And when you don't
[02:13:23.653 --> 02:13:26.336]  Address people's innate set points.
[02:13:26.336 --> 02:13:31.062]  Some people are resistant naturally to the Spirit of the Lord, to the voice of conscience.
[02:13:31.062 --> 02:13:34.546]  Some people are innately attracted to evil.
[02:13:34.546 --> 02:13:38.670]  And that can only be explained by, you know, spiritual proclivities that they've picked up.
[02:13:40.289 --> 02:13:49.194]  In their own creative process, I happen to think that God, after creating spirits, you know, there's a lot of free market things up there.
[02:13:49.194 --> 02:14:02.320]  You're allowed to see what's going on on Earth, you get influenced by things, and that's why Patton thought he was at Thermopolis, he was at the Greek battles, he believed in, or he thought maybe reincarnation explained that.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:02.921]  But in fact,
[02:14:03.681 --> 02:14:13.647]  I think the spiritual innateness that we come to earth with, just like you, you have a passion, Alex, for liberty, and that's just not learned in school.
[02:14:13.647 --> 02:14:17.288]  That's not where I picked it up.
[02:14:17.288 --> 02:14:19.890]  It's not learned in school.
[02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:22.131]  We're inbred with some of those, and not equally.
[02:14:23.852 --> 02:14:35.497]  I think to understand ourselves, our society, we have to get down to the basics, and too often the solutions we have, whether they're political solutions or religious solutions, are mechanistic.
[02:14:35.497 --> 02:14:39.259]  They're checklists, and that just doesn't hack it.
[02:14:39.259 --> 02:14:44.241]  You've got to tie into the source of truth, and as I was telling, it's a very still, small voice.
[02:14:44.241 --> 02:14:47.282]  You have to have a great deal of self-control to listen to that voice.
[02:14:48.703 --> 02:15:01.056]  I don't need to concentrate, but you know, if you fill your life with raucous music, loud hyperactivity, and you can't... I had to teach my kids, for example, to kind of just slow down in life.
[02:15:01.056 --> 02:15:07.642]  Take it easy so that you could hear the voice of the Lord when it was prompting you, and you had enough time to react to it.
[02:15:08.283 --> 02:15:09.424]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[02:15:09.424 --> 02:15:16.071]  I noticed that when I get calm and go out in the countryside, then I feel really moral and good and have clarity.
[02:15:16.071 --> 02:15:26.100]  But working and living in the city and running around, it's when I get sped up and crazed that I even catch myself having really evil thoughts and acting vicious.
[02:15:26.901 --> 02:15:29.505]  And really turning into like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[02:15:29.505 --> 02:15:31.989]  I mean, I've experienced it myself.
[02:15:31.989 --> 02:15:39.419]  And that's why the whole system is about speeding us up, confusing us, getting us angry, never letting us slow down.
[02:15:40.376 --> 02:15:42.157]  And that's what rock music is all about.
[02:15:42.157 --> 02:15:47.459]  I don't care if it's got great melodies or a great beat.
[02:15:47.459 --> 02:15:49.260]  The point is, it's too hyper.
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:51.321]  It's too all-consuming.
[02:15:51.321 --> 02:15:57.644]  And it literally drives away any ability to perceive the Spirit of God in your life.
[02:15:57.644 --> 02:15:59.505]  And I'm not talking about religious things.
[02:16:01.104 --> 02:16:05.946]  99% of all that I get from God daily is about my temporal level.
[02:16:05.946 --> 02:16:06.586]  This is right.
[02:16:06.586 --> 02:16:07.486]  This is wrong.
[02:16:07.486 --> 02:16:14.768]  Or when I'm going through, you know, I get hundreds of emails a day from various sources around the world and I have to sift through that.
[02:16:14.768 --> 02:16:18.529]  I can sense when I'm reading a story, that's not quite right.
[02:16:18.529 --> 02:16:19.810]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:19.810 --> 02:16:21.150]  Or this needs more research.
[02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:22.331]  Check that out.
[02:16:22.331 --> 02:16:23.451]  You know, you just get help.
[02:16:24.051 --> 02:16:27.652]  You feel that, I'm sure, as you go through the news.
[02:16:27.652 --> 02:16:40.716]  That's the Lord helping us determine truth and evil, and when you cut out that voice, when you tell that voice, I don't want to hear that voice about weight control, I don't want to hear it about exercise, I don't want to hear that about discipline to my children.
[02:16:40.716 --> 02:16:45.398]  We're basically telling the Lord to get lost, and there's a penalty to be paid for that.
[02:16:45.398 --> 02:16:51.560]  I think he penalizes us in terms of the amount of truth that we get when we continue to tell him to get lost.
[02:16:53.922 --> 02:16:58.504]  Wow, it's so incredibly huge.
[02:16:58.504 --> 02:17:00.926]  I guess the 60s terms would be heavy.
[02:17:00.926 --> 02:17:10.951]  But I was downtown this week, looking at the big buildings, looking at the people, looking at helicopters flying around, and then a drone flew by.
[02:17:10.951 --> 02:17:13.572]  The drones are just all over the place now in Austin.
[02:17:13.572 --> 02:17:16.474]  A little toy drone, smaller drone.
[02:17:16.474 --> 02:17:22.137]  And it was the fantasticness of consciousness and being alive on this planet
[02:17:23.291 --> 02:17:32.776]  And then you see full-grown men only caring about SportsCenter, or only caring about, you know, partying, and I'm not on some high horse myself either.
[02:17:32.776 --> 02:17:45.923]  It's just that you really see how the whole world, the manufactured world, is meant to blind us from the real world going around in front of us that's so fantastical that if we ever just slow down for a minute,
[02:17:47.239 --> 02:17:52.521]  It's awe-inspiring that we're alive and conscious in the middle of all this.
[02:17:52.521 --> 02:17:54.061]  Of course we're spiritual.
[02:17:54.061 --> 02:17:56.122]  Of course there's something much bigger.
[02:17:56.122 --> 02:18:00.383]  And the whole system is telling us, no, there is nothing bigger.
[02:18:00.383 --> 02:18:05.965]  Because it doesn't want us to question and say there could be a conspiracy, or question and say there could be more.
[02:18:05.965 --> 02:18:08.666]  We're being told, no, only what the world gives you.
[02:18:08.666 --> 02:18:09.586]  That's all that's real.
[02:18:11.957 --> 02:18:27.265]  You know I get a chance fortunately to get away from the computer two or three times a day when I go out in the country to and fly around the country to analyze people's property and help them in strategic relocation and it's amazing how refreshing that is.
[02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:40.972]  I'm supposed to be working and I do work hard sometimes 14 hours a day with people and they're constantly bombarding me with questions and you know give me the answers to these but you know I still when I'm out in the country I come back refreshed.
[02:18:42.052 --> 02:18:56.869]  And I know you feel that that way too, Alex, but it's incredible how we have to break this urbanization mold that the society is trying to push upon us and realize that you need to get out at the end of the day into a more tranquil environment.
[02:18:58.018 --> 02:19:13.224]  Well, the Bible says the city's the place where you find the evil, and there is no doubt that it's just unnatural, and then you've got an unnatural system working through that unnatural template to try to break our basic human programming, the attack on men, on the family, on women, on children.
[02:19:13.224 --> 02:19:17.926]  It's so predatory, and I don't see how other folks can't see that it's predatory.
[02:19:17.926 --> 02:19:23.388]  Not that I've got all the answers or that you have it all, but just admit, folks, it's a predatory world system.
[02:19:23.988 --> 02:19:25.469]  We need to be analyzing it.
[02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:26.790]  We need to understand it.
[02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:27.871]  We need to not trust it.
[02:19:27.871 --> 02:19:30.172]  We need to double-check everything it puts out.
[02:19:30.172 --> 02:19:31.773]  And double-check what we say.
[02:19:31.773 --> 02:19:34.235]  Just don't let these predators have their way with you.
[02:19:34.235 --> 02:19:39.798]  Be aware that the danger is increasing any way you slice it.

[02:19:48.043 --> 02:19:48.084]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:57.636]  I'm your host Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[02:20:01.448 --> 02:20:02.449]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:20:02.449 --> 02:20:05.890]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:05.890 --> 02:20:07.551]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:20:07.551 --> 02:20:09.511]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:09.511 --> 02:20:15.353]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:15.353 --> 02:20:16.174]  I know, right?
[02:20:16.174 --> 02:20:17.494]  You love it too!
[02:20:17.494 --> 02:20:18.935]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[02:20:18.935 --> 02:20:19.955]  Let's go get some!
[02:20:19.955 --> 02:20:21.676]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:20:21.676 --> 02:20:22.056]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:20:22.056 --> 02:20:22.836]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[02:20:30.379 --> 02:20:33.180]  Listen up, all you preppers and survival enthusiasts!
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:44.622]  Sigma 3 Survival School has a brand new survival instructor training program that will teach you everything you need to know about survival, and then license you to teach our survival programs so you can make a substantial profit from it.

[02:21:00.046 --> 02:21:08.693]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:21:08.693 --> 02:21:15.218]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:21:15.218 --> 02:21:19.221]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:21:19.221 --> 02:21:20.222]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:21:20.882 --> 02:21:33.687]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:21:33.687 --> 02:21:41.770]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:21:41.770 --> 02:21:45.452]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:21:45.452 --> 02:21:50.794]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively
[02:21:50.794 --> 02:21:59.960]  Exclusively at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:06.024]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[02:22:06.024 --> 02:22:11.788]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[02:22:11.788 --> 02:22:18.753]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[02:22:18.993 --> 02:22:28.237]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[02:22:28.237 --> 02:22:31.238]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[02:22:31.238 --> 02:22:40.822]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[02:22:40.822 --> 02:22:44.684]  One World Whey is newly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[02:22:44.884 --> 02:22:50.955]  We believe One World Whey is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy internal body environment.
[02:22:50.955 --> 02:22:53.900]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:55.582]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:22:59.344 --> 02:23:00.325]  News Flash!
[02:23:00.325 --> 02:23:02.306]  Home invasions are on the rise.
[02:23:02.306 --> 02:23:05.189]  It takes less than 10 seconds to kick in a door.
[02:23:05.189 --> 02:23:07.971]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[02:23:07.971 --> 02:23:09.913]  And what would happen if you're not home?
[02:23:09.913 --> 02:23:13.275]  Easy Armor is the ultimate security solution.
[02:23:13.275 --> 02:23:15.257]  85% of break-ins are through a door.
[02:23:15.257 --> 02:23:17.619]  Protect your home now with Easy Armor.

[02:23:25.205 --> 02:23:26.106]  Easy Armor.
[02:23:26.106 --> 02:23:28.488]  Your security is our only business.
[02:23:28.928 --> 02:23:33.891]  Does advertising on the Genesis Communications Radio Network actually bring positive results?
[02:23:33.891 --> 02:23:36.332]  Let's ask Thomas Baldrick from Freestrike Eye.
[02:23:36.332 --> 02:23:38.834]  And do the GCN listeners let you know they heard your ad?
[02:23:38.834 --> 02:23:43.296]  Customers do let us know they've heard Freestrike Eye ads on GCN.
[02:23:43.296 --> 02:23:50.140]  They seem to be very loyal listeners to GCN and they stay with those shows and subsequently they stay with our business too.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:51.400]  Looking for positive results?
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:53.221]  Contact Lee Wickenhauser at 877-996-4327 extension 107.
[02:24:06.363 --> 02:24:08.089]  Yeah, I think.
[02:24:15.086 --> 02:24:17.407]  Joel Scouse is our guest, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:24:17.407 --> 02:24:21.408]  There's a lot of breaking news on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:21.408 --> 02:24:26.869]  Black conservative leader says Obama could declare martial law, cancel 2016 elections.
[02:24:26.869 --> 02:24:30.590]  They don't need to, the bureaucracy's already canceled the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:38.972]  Ebola camps, Fox Analyst calls for quarantine camps in every city, and now Bloomberg has a bunch of medical officials basically calling for the same thing.
[02:24:38.972 --> 02:24:41.973]  Dallas nurse with video asks, is Ebola airborne now?
[02:24:42.873 --> 02:24:43.634]  Most of U.S.
[02:24:43.634 --> 02:24:46.875]  hospitals cannot safely handle Ebola patients.
[02:24:46.875 --> 02:24:50.177]  Sick passengers on Boston flight prompt Ebola scare.
[02:24:50.177 --> 02:24:52.199]  Hazmat crews on scene.
[02:24:52.199 --> 02:24:55.641]  Seventy hospital staffers cared for Ebola patient.
[02:24:55.641 --> 02:24:56.721]  Ebola outbreak.
[02:24:56.721 --> 02:24:57.062]  U.N.
[02:24:57.062 --> 02:24:59.603]  worker dies in German hospital.
[02:24:59.603 --> 02:25:03.846]  Ferguson protesters hold surprise rally at Upscale Plaza.
[02:25:03.846 --> 02:25:08.208]  Shopping mall harass shoppers and say they want them to be uncomfortable.
[02:25:08.208 --> 02:25:10.490]  This is becoming very racial, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:11.258 --> 02:25:14.919]  And again, I'm against the Ku Klux Klan being racist, and I've protested them.
[02:25:14.919 --> 02:25:24.823]  I'm also against other groups being racist towards white people, and that's kind of the idea that, like, the only form of inequity or evil in the world is from a white person.
[02:25:24.823 --> 02:25:26.184]  Well, that's just ridiculous.
[02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:28.304]  People act pretty much the same everywhere.
[02:25:28.304 --> 02:25:37.248]  There's different cultural variances, but it's just to say that someone's inherently evil because they're black or inherently evil because they're white is just asinine, and it's really getting bad.
[02:25:38.154 --> 02:25:50.063]  A lot of really unsavory elements have gotten involved in the whole Ferguson situation now and the police have acted out of control as well but now they're getting shot so this is becoming an
[02:25:51.636 --> 02:25:53.618]  Really a destabilizing effect.
[02:25:53.618 --> 02:26:07.368]  Joel, we're going to go to phone calls from John in Oklahoma listening on KZLS and Joe and JD and Mark and Rick, but I want to start going to them at the start of the next segment because this is a short segment so we don't get cut off by a break.
[02:26:07.368 --> 02:26:10.511]  You write a lot about this and strategic relocation in the book.
[02:26:10.511 --> 02:26:11.812]  You talk about it a lot in the film.
[02:26:13.291 --> 02:26:22.730]  The way the establishment has created balkanization and exacerbated cultural and racial differences, and it really seems like this is getting worse than ever.
[02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:24.153]  What's your current take on that?
[02:26:25.310 --> 02:26:44.495]  You know there's a lot of talk about and hype about ISIS coming over the border and creating terrorist attacks and I predicted that there will be no such attacks any more than there's been any other attacks for the last, well forever, even since 9-11 and that's because this is controlled terror we're dealing with.
[02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:46.795]  You know we've got a wide open border with Mexico.
[02:26:46.795 --> 02:26:52.777]  What's to stop real terrorists from buying a ticket to Mexico and coming across the border and blowing themselves up in a
[02:26:53.637 --> 02:26:55.118]  In a shopping mall.
[02:26:55.118 --> 02:27:02.022]  The fact is that the American people would react very decisively and require that border be shut down tighter than a drum.
[02:27:02.022 --> 02:27:05.324]  And that's why they don't let the terrorists come across.
[02:27:05.324 --> 02:27:07.645]  And it proves that they are controlled.
[02:27:07.645 --> 02:27:12.267]  And that's why I'm saying the real purpose of that open border is this multicultural agenda.
[02:27:12.267 --> 02:27:18.431]  The increased crime, the increased stress, and to overwhelm conservative voting patterns in this country with
[02:27:19.611 --> 02:27:24.674]  The Democratic Socialist leaning voting patterns of uneducated Mexicans that come across.
[02:27:24.674 --> 02:27:27.635]  And by the way, Blue State brags and openly admits that.
[02:27:27.635 --> 02:27:35.879]  I mean, they say, we will get your guns within 10 years, and the Democrats organize around race while telling everybody else they can't.
[02:27:35.879 --> 02:27:43.743]  I want to organize around liberty and freedom, but as you said, these are third world countries that have never been free.
[02:27:43.743 --> 02:27:44.584]  This country's in trouble.
[02:27:45.546 --> 02:27:46.967]  Well, and the judges are upholding this.
[02:27:46.967 --> 02:28:06.657]  It shows that there's a conspiracy that goes clear into the judicial department because literally every judge where you take these cases to court to protest democratic registration or to enforce voter ID even, the judges are knocking down voter ID as if that's something unconscionable against the 14th Amendment, against people's rights.
[02:28:06.657 --> 02:28:06.997]  What?
[02:28:06.997 --> 02:28:10.178]  To require identification that you're an eligible voter?
[02:28:10.178 --> 02:28:11.439]  What could be more patriotic?
[02:28:11.439 --> 02:28:12.940]  What could be more American than that?
[02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:21.329]  But literally, we have 100% of judges voting down those voter ID laws, which shows that they're under the Democratic agenda.
[02:28:21.329 --> 02:28:24.313]  Well, it's actually a globalist agenda.
[02:28:24.313 --> 02:28:26.015]  They do the same thing under Republicans.
[02:28:28.223 --> 02:28:30.425]  The Democrats are the cutting edge, though.
[02:28:30.425 --> 02:28:31.406]  Yes, they are.
[02:28:31.406 --> 02:28:35.771]  Now, it's telling, though, that they get some things done more than others.
[02:28:35.771 --> 02:28:45.020]  You know, this rumor about Obama going to stay in office and there's not going to be an election in the future because he's going to take control has been going around for years, but it's bogus.
[02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:46.062]  Obama's a puppet.
[02:28:46.062 --> 02:28:47.643]  He's controlled by the globalists.
[02:28:48.564 --> 02:28:52.507]  And they know that there's a groundswell of reaction against Obama.
[02:28:52.507 --> 02:28:55.049]  They're not so stupid as to keep Obama in power.
[02:28:55.049 --> 02:28:58.452]  They're going to give us a controlled Republican next time around.
[02:28:58.452 --> 02:29:03.196]  I'm predicting that not only will Hillary Clinton run, but she will be defeated.
[02:29:04.187 --> 02:29:12.270]  I think the powers that be really like to have a compliant puppet as president, not someone like Hillary who really will try to run the presidency.
[02:29:12.270 --> 02:29:18.092]  But I think they really want to give relief to the country, false relief, in the form of a controlled Republican.
[02:29:18.092 --> 02:29:21.153]  Of course, they're trying to shove Chris Christie at us.
[02:29:21.153 --> 02:29:29.616]  There's another shades of what happened when they want to root out... Finish your US political view and we'll come back and we'll go right to calls.
[02:29:30.396 --> 02:29:38.398]  But you can see him also organized with the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership to destroy the real libertarian constitutional Tea Party movement.
[02:29:38.398 --> 02:29:41.118]  And you see Rand Paul being demonized as well.
[02:29:41.118 --> 02:29:44.919]  We'll get Joel Skousen's take on election 2016 and your calls.
[02:29:44.919 --> 02:29:50.060]  Joe, J.D., Mark, John, Rick, everybody, straight ahead.
[02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:51.461]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.461 --> 02:29:53.981]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.981 --> 02:29:56.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.942 --> 02:30:11.507]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:30:11.507 --> 02:30:17.950]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:30:17.950 --> 02:30:20.291]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:30:20.291 --> 02:30:23.392]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:30:23.392 --> 02:30:30.275]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:30:30.495 --> 02:30:35.116]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:30:35.116 --> 02:30:39.898]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:30:39.898 --> 02:30:41.218]  Talk about the effects.
[02:30:41.218 --> 02:30:42.739]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:30:42.739 --> 02:30:44.659]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:30:44.659 --> 02:30:45.760]  I feel like I look better.
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:46.480]  I feel better.
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:47.540]  I feel sexier.
[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:48.500]  I love it.
[02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:51.481]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:30:51.481 --> 02:30:54.422]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:30:54.422 --> 02:30:55.503]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:30:55.503 --> 02:30:56.683]  Consult your physician.

[02:30:59.064 --> 02:30:59.984]  This is life changing.
[02:31:00.624 --> 02:31:10.291]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:10.291 --> 02:31:20.217]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:20.217 --> 02:31:30.384]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives, or worse.
[02:31:30.404 --> 02:31:30.804]  I think.
[02:32:01.584 --> 02:32:02.945]  In the near future.
[02:32:02.945 --> 02:32:06.727]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:06.727 --> 02:32:07.427]  Alert.
[02:32:07.427 --> 02:32:08.127]  Security.
[02:32:08.127 --> 02:32:08.647]  Alert.
[02:32:08.647 --> 02:32:10.648]  This is Homeland Security.

[02:32:14.350 --> 02:32:19.232]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:19.232 --> 02:32:20.272]  Prime Directive.
[02:32:20.272 --> 02:32:21.813]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:21.813 --> 02:32:24.674]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:24.674 --> 02:32:27.915]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:27.915 --> 02:32:30.076]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:30.216 --> 02:32:31.737]  These people are assaulting us!
[02:32:31.737 --> 02:32:33.918]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:33.918 --> 02:32:36.520]  They are never going to stop.
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:40.542]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:32:40.542 --> 02:32:44.144]  Block free iPhone apps at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:44.144 --> 02:32:47.506]  Block free podcasts and video feeds.
[02:32:47.506 --> 02:32:48.487]  Imperative.
[02:32:48.487 --> 02:32:50.548]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[02:32:50.548 --> 02:32:55.010]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[02:32:55.010 --> 02:32:57.332]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[02:33:01.298 --> 02:33:07.907]  I would stand in line for this There's always room in life for this
[02:33:16.826 --> 02:33:19.488]  You're listening to InfoWars.
[02:33:19.488 --> 02:33:21.209]  Because there's a war on.
[02:33:21.209 --> 02:33:22.209]  For your mind.
[02:33:22.209 --> 02:33:23.790]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:27.233]  We're here Monday through Friday 11am to 2pm Central.
[02:33:27.233 --> 02:33:30.635]  Back weeknight 7 o'clock Central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:33:30.635 --> 02:33:33.897]  With our incredible news team of reporters and researchers.
[02:33:33.897 --> 02:33:37.259]  And don't forget the Sunday show live 4 to 6pm Central.
[02:33:37.259 --> 02:33:39.100]  I'll be live next Sunday.
[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:41.302]  David Knight was live this Sunday.
[02:33:41.302 --> 02:33:45.384]  Folks have probably noticed I've been missing a day here, missing a day there.
[02:33:45.384 --> 02:33:45.725]  I've had
[02:33:47.102 --> 02:33:52.047]  Some family illness issues with my grandmother, been helping take care of her with my parents.
[02:33:52.047 --> 02:33:58.414]  She's 89 and I've been dealing with that and some life transition things with her and a bunch of other family stuff.
[02:33:58.414 --> 02:33:59.975]  It seems to come in waves.
[02:33:59.975 --> 02:34:02.578]  You'll have more stuff go wrong with your family in a year than happens in 10.
[02:34:03.459 --> 02:34:05.921]  And then you'll have more good stuff happen in a year that happens in 20.
[02:34:05.921 --> 02:34:07.783]  It's just, it's one of those times.
[02:34:07.783 --> 02:34:08.984]  Best of times, worst of times.
[02:34:08.984 --> 02:34:15.910]  But thank God we've got David Knight who can do just as good a job or better than I. And Paul Watson's here visiting us from England and the rest of the amazing crew.
[02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:20.234]  This radio crew is the best I've ever had by leaps and bounds.
[02:34:20.234 --> 02:34:23.016]  Just the whole operation, I thank God for them all.
[02:34:23.016 --> 02:34:28.261]  And I'm humbled to be here, humbled to have our sponsors, humbled to have our affiliates, humbled to
[02:34:29.762 --> 02:34:35.425]  I have our just wonderful, wonderful listeners that are not just listeners, that are activists for freedom.
[02:34:35.425 --> 02:34:43.530]  I burn with a desire for all my foibles and all my warts to not be a slave and to not like to see con artists hurting innocent people.
[02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:46.152]  I just don't like bullies.
[02:34:46.152 --> 02:34:51.315]  And the New World Order, Luciferian trash, are just cosmic con artists.
[02:34:51.315 --> 02:34:53.116]  That's what my grandfather would always call it.
[02:34:53.116 --> 02:34:55.137]  You know, Satan's a con artist.
[02:34:55.137 --> 02:34:58.038]  A cosmic con artist who's conned all his people.
[02:34:58.038 --> 02:34:58.779]  He's going to save them.
[02:35:00.063 --> 02:35:04.487]  So that's the thing, people, they don't think the devil's going to lose, folks.
[02:35:04.487 --> 02:35:08.189]  And meanwhile, they want to convince you it doesn't even exist, so you're not even in the ballgame.
[02:35:08.189 --> 02:35:09.651]  They win by default.
[02:35:09.651 --> 02:35:10.952]  I don't want to go off and start preaching.
[02:35:10.952 --> 02:35:16.036]  We're going to go back to Joel to finish up his 2016 points, then we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[02:35:16.036 --> 02:35:18.478]  Again, John in Oklahoma, listening on KZLS.
[02:35:18.478 --> 02:35:19.739]  We'll be first here in just a moment.
[02:35:20.814 --> 02:35:28.160]  But first off, we have a proprietary super nascent iodine that doesn't have the alcohol or other fillers that taste so horrible.
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.063]  Turns bright blue on paper, not black or red, because it's real iodine.
[02:35:32.063 --> 02:35:41.531]  From the 99.999 crystals, from multi-million year old ancient crystal deposits, you know, 7 to 12,000 feet under the ground.
[02:35:41.531 --> 02:35:44.353]  It literally, when we manufacture it on a hot plate,
[02:35:45.094 --> 02:35:53.441]  It's manufactured in a big facility, but if you put a crystal in a petri dish or a beaker and heat it up past 90 degrees, it turns into purple gas.
[02:35:53.441 --> 02:35:58.745]  This just goes through your body and basically your whole body operates on it.
[02:35:58.745 --> 02:36:00.027]  The globalists are obsessed with it.
[02:36:00.027 --> 02:36:01.388]  They don't want you to know about it.
[02:36:01.388 --> 02:36:03.469]  It's changed my life health-wise.
[02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:12.217]  What it's done for my thyroid, my blood, my energy, detoxing, immune system, and we've never done this because it's our best seller, but
[02:36:13.248 --> 02:36:14.129]  Anthony had the idea.
[02:36:14.129 --> 02:36:17.072]  He said, listen, let's make it even more affordable.
[02:36:17.072 --> 02:36:21.497]  It's double the strength, half the cost of leading competitors that aren't even the real nascent iodine.

[02:36:53.991 --> 02:36:55.452]  We have the Lung Cleanse.

[02:37:04.098 --> 02:37:09.942]  And don't forget, we have the film I produced with Joel Skousen, Strategic Relocation, almost three hours.
[02:37:09.942 --> 02:37:12.224]  And then it integrates in with the color book.
[02:37:12.978 --> 02:37:16.184]  It's like a big coffee table book, just jam-packed with data.
[02:37:16.184 --> 02:37:21.334]  Strategic Relocation, the book and the Secure Home 3rd Edition.
[02:37:22.793 --> 02:37:37.023]  The latest that's out as well by Joel Skousen, the worldwide top consultant on secure homes to the elite, you name it, he's the expert, and we've got the film and the two books available discounted at infowarestore.com.
[02:37:37.023 --> 02:37:38.665]  It's just good to start thinking about this stuff.
[02:37:38.665 --> 02:37:42.727]  Start out with the book, the video, mull it around in your brain, and just think about it.
[02:37:42.727 --> 02:37:45.049]  That's what I've been doing, and I've made a lot of preparations.
[02:37:45.049 --> 02:37:49.833]  Some solar, a well, a wall, the firearms, not because I'm living in fear,
[02:37:50.834 --> 02:37:54.537]  But because I'm trying to live prepared like all my ancestors did.
[02:37:54.537 --> 02:37:58.962]  Everybody canned food, everybody knew how to be self-sufficient, or you were a loser.
[02:37:58.962 --> 02:38:01.244]  Now almost no one knows how.
[02:38:01.244 --> 02:38:05.768]  Well you can at least have water filtration and food, and know how to defend it.
[02:38:05.768 --> 02:38:09.511]  Because the plan is to incrementally collapse the society.
[02:38:09.511 --> 02:38:12.174]  The plan is to force you into the cities for a reason.
[02:38:13.314 --> 02:38:15.138]  Now, going back to Joel, and I want to get to calls.
[02:38:15.138 --> 02:38:17.141]  Again, thank you for spending so much time with us, Joel.
[02:38:17.141 --> 02:38:19.406]  The website's worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:38:19.406 --> 02:38:20.989]  He's the editor-in-chief there.
[02:38:20.989 --> 02:38:23.974]  Finishing up on what you see in 2016, then I want to go to calls.
[02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:35.774]  Well, they always start out trying to give us a phony Republican, like they started out with Rudolph Giuliani, a cross-dresser, globalist, involved in 9-11.
[02:38:35.774 --> 02:38:45.065]  The conservatives would have none of them, and so they resurrected McCain in 2008, just out of nowhere, in order to stop Mitt Romney from getting into the position.
[02:38:46.107 --> 02:38:49.830]  Six Democratic newspapers endorsing John McCain.
[02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:59.757]  And then, of course, in 2008, they couldn't stop Mitt Romney, so they had to pull about 8 million to 10 million votes in order to defeat him.
[02:38:59.757 --> 02:39:10.465]  I mean, here's a guy who was bending over backwards to please the establishment, ignorant about conspiracy, and yet they still didn't want him in the White House because they didn't have dirt on him.
[02:39:10.465 --> 02:39:11.526]  They couldn't control him.
[02:39:12.225 --> 02:39:15.227]  That's the same thing that's going to happen to Rand Paul coming up.
[02:39:15.227 --> 02:39:23.713]  They can't allow him to be in the White House no matter how much he bends over backwards to say Republicans need to reach out to Hispanics and to blacks and to every other minority.
[02:39:23.713 --> 02:39:28.776]  He's really trying to compromise to get ahead so that he can avoid what happened to his father.
[02:39:28.776 --> 02:39:29.917]  It won't do any good.
[02:39:29.917 --> 02:39:31.938]  They've got his phones tapped.
[02:39:31.938 --> 02:39:34.020]  They know he's real.
[02:39:34.020 --> 02:39:34.600]  Well, that's right.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:35.561]  But what I'm saying is that
[02:39:37.185 --> 02:39:38.266]  He's not going to get in.
[02:39:38.266 --> 02:39:40.468]  He's going to be the man to beat, I predict.
[02:39:40.468 --> 02:39:49.578]  But the fact that Mitt Romney is surging back into popularity shows that nobody's enthused about Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio yet.
[02:39:49.578 --> 02:39:53.862]  We're going to see a litany or a progression of them throwing us
[02:39:55.203 --> 02:39:55.604]  I don't know.
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:11.221]  What would they do if Iran Paul really got in?
[02:40:32.708 --> 02:40:34.328]  Boy, I tell you, that would be tough.
[02:40:34.328 --> 02:40:38.750]  I don't think that's even a possibility just because they control votes at the national level now.
[02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:45.931]  State votes are counted at the national level and they can simply eliminate as many millions of votes as they want electronically.
[02:40:45.931 --> 02:40:46.372]  That's right.
[02:40:46.372 --> 02:40:49.412]  VNS has been merged into another shadowy group, all secretive.
[02:40:49.412 --> 02:40:51.073]  They do compile them all at the federal level.
[02:40:51.980 --> 02:41:08.474]  Nobody can trace it, but I think if you had somebody like Rand Paul, who's very strong-minded, who is trying to compromise, but he would be a pretty strong Libertarian president once he's in, they'd have to assassinate him probably to control him, because otherwise it's quite difficult.
[02:41:09.793 --> 02:41:12.034]  Yeah, I've known Rand Paul since 1996.
[02:41:12.034 --> 02:41:13.335]  He is for real.
[02:41:13.335 --> 02:41:19.239]  He is compromising on a lot of fronts, but he's pro-Second Amendment, pro-sovereignty.
[02:41:19.239 --> 02:41:20.760]  He's done a lot of good things.
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:26.564]  What do you think of the Texas Senator, Ted Cruz?
[02:41:26.564 --> 02:41:28.825]  Well, Ted Cruz has said a lot of things.
[02:41:28.825 --> 02:41:33.108]  You know, his wife is tied to some of the big banks.
[02:41:33.108 --> 02:41:34.569]  Goldman Sachs.
[02:41:34.569 --> 02:41:35.449]  Yeah, Goldman Sachs.
[02:41:36.966 --> 02:41:40.228]  I don't think he has enough gravitas.
[02:41:40.228 --> 02:41:48.613]  He's certainly not savvy enough about the conspiracy to really do us some damage or do some damage to them.
[02:41:48.613 --> 02:41:51.055]  But he is a force to be contended with.
[02:41:51.055 --> 02:41:55.158]  Mike Lee's also a heavy, a lightweight, I'm sorry, a lightweight.
[02:41:55.158 --> 02:42:05.224]  His father, Rex Lee, the Solicitor General, was a pretty good compromiser, pretty bad compromiser in terms of not doing, not sustaining the Constitution when he was Solicitor General.
[02:42:05.424 --> 02:42:07.272]  Sure, but he was good at compromising, which is bad.
[02:42:07.272 --> 02:42:07.954]  I get your point.
[02:42:09.605 --> 02:42:12.046]  I think we focus so much on presidential runs, though.
[02:42:12.046 --> 02:42:14.006]  What about taking back counties and cities?
[02:42:14.006 --> 02:42:16.447]  That's where I've seen where we can have a real effect.
[02:42:16.447 --> 02:42:17.887]  Look at agenda 21.
[02:42:17.887 --> 02:42:22.048]  Just by people realizing there's a conspiracy, it's turned a lot of it back.
[02:42:22.048 --> 02:42:23.789]  Yeah, I'm in complete agreement.
[02:42:23.789 --> 02:42:31.211]  I really don't think they're going to let us control the national election ever again, nor congressional elections, except by a fluke here and there.
[02:42:31.211 --> 02:42:35.152]  But it's at the local level, both local legislators and county.
[02:42:35.992 --> 02:42:40.575]  Commissioners, where we can sustain constitutional sheriffs.
[02:42:40.575 --> 02:42:44.997]  That's another area that we really need to make sure we get principled sheriffs into office there.
[02:42:44.997 --> 02:42:48.379]  They're the last line of defense towards protecting our human rights.
[02:42:48.379 --> 02:42:51.941]  And you and I are going to need those someday when the SWAT teams show up at our doors.
[02:42:51.941 --> 02:42:56.664]  We need friends to be able to call a sheriff to say, back off feds, you don't have jurisdiction here.
[02:42:56.664 --> 02:43:02.407]  Well, we're seeing that more and more even in big cities in Texas where the county sheriffs and judges
[02:43:03.247 --> 02:43:08.329]  Are saying we're not going to go along with a gun confiscation and have ordered the Sheriff's Department to resist it.
[02:43:08.329 --> 02:43:09.249]  That's not radical.
[02:43:09.249 --> 02:43:11.970]  That's default position that would stop all this.
[02:43:11.970 --> 02:43:12.811]  I want to go to calls.
[02:43:12.811 --> 02:43:18.113]  One final point in my gut or my spirit.
[02:43:18.113 --> 02:43:23.975]  I feel like if we educated enough people about the true nature of the conspiracy, which is so public now,
[02:43:26.184 --> 02:43:34.993]  Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and Bill Gates all get caught meeting secretly to discuss life extension technology and world population reduction.
[02:43:34.993 --> 02:43:38.296]  ABC News, London Guardian, five years ago.
[02:43:38.296 --> 02:43:42.540]  A few months ago, Peter Thiel, the billionaire Bilderberger, says, I want to live forever.
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:46.624]  There it is, Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, on a mission to cheat death.
[02:43:46.624 --> 02:43:48.126]  When you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole,
[02:43:49.198 --> 02:43:52.908]  They all believe they're going to transcend humanity, that it's about to happen.
[02:43:52.908 --> 02:43:55.134]  They're going to accept a robot computer takeover.
[02:43:56.872 --> 02:44:12.944]  I mean, I say this fiction-based, but it's like aliens from the fourth dimension are speaking to these people, convincing them to build a technological kill grid that will reduce the world population, and they're telling them they're going to get eternal life out of it.
[02:44:12.944 --> 02:44:18.488]  That sounds like a science fiction plot from a horror movie or something.
[02:44:19.446 --> 02:44:21.026]  And now they're very public about it.
[02:44:21.026 --> 02:44:26.547]  Fifteen years ago when I was reading their internal writings, or more scholarly documents, that's all they talked about.
[02:44:26.547 --> 02:44:37.109]  But now, Joel, they're so public about, it's the end of humanity, it's an evolution, we're going to transcend, we're going to get rid of almost everybody, and only a tiny group will live forever.
[02:44:37.109 --> 02:44:44.671]  And you've now got kind of the scientific elite, for the first time, embracing, through revelation of the method, the externalization of the hierarchy,
[02:44:45.291 --> 02:44:57.896]  And actually saying, we want to join you and live forever, so I'm seeing a decompartmentalization from the top level into the mid-level and into pop culture, even if it's at a subconscious level.
[02:44:57.896 --> 02:45:00.817]  Why do you think they're being so public now about their master plan?
[02:45:01.690 --> 02:45:03.412]  Well, I think they're confident now.
[02:45:03.412 --> 02:45:15.884]  I mean, the mere fact that they've kept up on the CFR website the speech by James Jones admitting to conspiracy, admitting that he gets daily marching orders as the National Security Advisor from Henry Kissinger and Associates.
[02:45:15.884 --> 02:45:17.286]  They keep it right up on the website.
[02:45:17.286 --> 02:45:18.587]  It's still there.
[02:45:18.587 --> 02:45:22.231]  He said, I get my daily marching orders from the CFR and Henry Kissinger.
[02:45:22.691 --> 02:45:23.831]  That's right.
[02:45:23.831 --> 02:45:26.752]  Passed down through Brent Scowcroft and Sandy Berger, his associates.
[02:45:26.752 --> 02:45:30.112]  I mean, right there in public, and they haven't removed it.
[02:45:30.112 --> 02:45:32.193]  Of course, no media ever made an issue of that.
[02:45:32.193 --> 02:45:37.054]  No media talked about it, but the conspiracy is very confident that they can beat us now.
[02:45:37.054 --> 02:45:41.634]  And so, what we've really got to do is, you know, you are absolutely right.
[02:45:41.634 --> 02:45:46.075]  The only way to save this nation is not through restoring the Constitution.
[02:45:46.075 --> 02:45:46.995]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:45:46.995 --> 02:45:47.996]  I'm a Constitutionalist.
[02:45:47.996 --> 02:45:49.516]  So was my Uncle Cleon Skousen.
[02:45:49.516 --> 02:45:49.916]  But look,
[02:45:50.456 --> 02:45:53.321]  The lawyers themselves say, hey, I don't care if you restore the Constitution.
[02:45:53.321 --> 02:45:55.284]  We know how to interpret that.
[02:45:55.284 --> 02:45:57.047]  You can't restore it.
[02:45:57.047 --> 02:45:58.029]  It's already there.
[02:45:58.029 --> 02:45:59.271]  They just simply disregard it.
[02:45:59.271 --> 02:46:00.253]  They won't defend it.
[02:46:00.253 --> 02:46:01.675]  They've had a revolution against us.
[02:46:02.751 --> 02:46:03.572]  That's right.
[02:46:03.572 --> 02:46:08.276]  And so only preaching and giving credible evidence about conspiracy.
[02:46:08.276 --> 02:46:12.580]  And thank God we've got so much evidence in 9-11 to actually button down the case.
[02:46:12.580 --> 02:46:14.081]  That's why that's the big no-no.
[02:46:14.081 --> 02:46:15.963]  Never say that they could be bad.
[02:46:15.963 --> 02:46:17.644]  Never say investigate them.
[02:46:17.644 --> 02:46:19.906]  Never explain their master plan.
[02:46:19.906 --> 02:46:23.169]  They want to bring out their master plan in their words and sell it.
[02:46:23.169 --> 02:46:24.691]  They don't want us beating them to the pass.
[02:46:26.499 --> 02:46:26.899]  That's right.
[02:46:26.899 --> 02:46:28.520]  And so we are reaching a lot of people.
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:30.840]  You're reaching a tremendous amount of people, Alex.
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:37.122]  And I'll tell you, I have people almost every day call up and say, I saw you on a video with Alex Jones.
[02:46:37.122 --> 02:46:40.724]  I mean, that video has had so much play around the world.
[02:46:40.724 --> 02:46:42.144]  It's incredible, Alex.
[02:46:42.144 --> 02:46:44.525]  And we'll have to do another one sometime.
[02:46:44.525 --> 02:46:45.245]  We need to do it.
[02:46:45.245 --> 02:46:45.825]  We need to do it.
[02:46:45.825 --> 02:46:48.206]  I really enjoyed being in studio with your great staff.
[02:46:48.686 --> 02:46:49.346]  Well, you're awesome.
[02:46:49.346 --> 02:46:52.207]  We love having you here and going out to dinner as well.
[02:46:52.207 --> 02:46:56.969]  Another question, because we've got to go to calls, I've been hogging the time, is why do they let us live and operate?
[02:46:56.969 --> 02:46:59.770]  I mean, your plane crashed and you survived.
[02:46:59.770 --> 02:47:01.570]  A miracle, even mainstream news said.
[02:47:01.570 --> 02:47:03.731]  You probably don't think that was a setup.
[02:47:03.731 --> 02:47:04.631]  Might have been.
[02:47:04.631 --> 02:47:07.932]  I've had them openly threaten me and openly attack me physically before.
[02:47:07.932 --> 02:47:10.413]  But I mean, I think God is in control.
[02:47:10.413 --> 02:47:12.414]  I think that's the reason we're still alive, Joel.
[02:47:13.214 --> 02:47:15.336]  Yeah, you know, we're losing most of the battles.
[02:47:15.336 --> 02:47:19.739]  I mean, we're gaining some, but the powers that be are corrupting more.
[02:47:19.739 --> 02:47:31.349]  But I think even though God can't overwhelm a nation that perhaps deserves some tribulation to come, at least he can protect those of us who are trying to fight for liberty, and I feel the protection of the Lord.
[02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:33.290]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:34.731]  I don't feel like I deserve it.
[02:47:34.731 --> 02:47:36.092]  It's very humbling.
[02:47:36.092 --> 02:47:41.056]  Let's talk to John in Oklahoma, listening on 1640 in Oklahoma City.
[02:47:41.056 --> 02:47:41.677]  Go ahead, John.
[02:47:42.341 --> 02:47:43.683]  Yeah, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:47:43.683 --> 02:48:01.145]  Joe, you hit a really responsive note with me when you said that people should now be looking for some kind of refuge outside the cities because for about the next two years, I've been talking to people in this city of Enid, Oklahoma,
[02:48:02.179 --> 02:48:20.369]  Who are good churchgoers, very nice, likable people, that they should pull together their resources with two or three other families and go out into the way outside the cities and start looking for abandoned farms to reactivate.
[02:48:20.369 --> 02:48:24.911]  Because it's going to take about a year to reconstruct and add solar panels and
[02:48:25.421 --> 02:48:25.882]  I think so.
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:45.241]  Uh, without re-entering society, so to speak, or what's left of it.
[02:48:45.241 --> 02:48:48.042]  And let me throw that out, because we're going to skip this network break.
[02:48:48.042 --> 02:48:51.363]  The elites themselves, we didn't get into that, but that's even in mainstream news.
[02:48:51.363 --> 02:48:53.064]  But Joel told me about it a decade ago.
[02:48:53.064 --> 02:48:58.006]  They're all building armored redoubts or leaving the country or building fortresses in the Ozarks.
[02:48:58.006 --> 02:49:01.767]  They're digging in as well while telling us we shouldn't be dug in.
[02:49:01.767 --> 02:49:04.588]  Do you have a specific question for Joel Skousen?
[02:49:04.588 --> 02:49:06.308]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:49:06.308 --> 02:49:07.869]  Are you in real estate, Joe?
[02:49:09.191 --> 02:49:18.819]  No, but I do have an associate, Todd Savage, who runs strategicrelocation.com, which is a survival realty site.
[02:49:18.819 --> 02:49:23.602]  I highly recommend people go there to try to find real good preparedness properties.
[02:49:23.602 --> 02:49:32.189]  Yeah, what Joel does is he's an expert, not just in the U.S., but all over the world, on safer areas to live and the pluses and minuses of those areas.
[02:49:34.807 --> 02:49:37.669]  But I don't actually find specific property people.
[02:49:37.669 --> 02:49:38.689]  I consult with them.
[02:49:38.689 --> 02:49:42.972]  I will give them opinions if they find property and want me to analyze it.
[02:49:42.972 --> 02:49:45.814]  But I don't have time to actually go out and... All right.
[02:49:45.814 --> 02:49:46.815]  Thank you so much, John.
[02:49:46.815 --> 02:49:49.336]  Please spread the word there in Oklahoma City about the broadcast.
[02:49:49.336 --> 02:49:50.177]  Great to hear from you.
[02:49:50.177 --> 02:49:52.338]  Another great affiliate out there.
[02:49:52.338 --> 02:49:54.159]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California.
[02:49:54.159 --> 02:49:54.840]  You're on the air.
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:55.160]  Go ahead.
[02:49:56.583 --> 02:49:58.304]  Good afternoon, Alex and Joel.
[02:49:58.304 --> 02:50:01.366]  I kind of envy those who do have an escape plan.
[02:50:01.366 --> 02:50:06.429]  My finances kind of prevent that, but that's not really the point of my call here.
[02:50:06.429 --> 02:50:12.092]  I actually just kind of wanted to gather your thoughts about last year's repealment of the Smith-Mundt Act.
[02:50:12.092 --> 02:50:19.336]  That is the law that prevented the State Department from disseminating internally authorized news stories to the general public.
[02:50:19.896 --> 02:50:27.319]  And I think it's because of that why we're seeing a lot of hype in Ferguson and a lot of hype in, you know, regarding ISIS.
[02:50:27.319 --> 02:50:32.861]  Maybe a little bit regarding Ebola, but I think that's kind of a factor to consider.
[02:50:32.861 --> 02:50:43.265]  Well, I know that they've repealed laws to engage in domestic propaganda, but that was already going on, but explain it to me like I'm five years old.
[02:50:43.265 --> 02:50:44.205]  I don't quite get your point.
[02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:51.031]  Okay, well, what I'm noticing is that... Sorry.
[02:50:51.031 --> 02:50:57.254]  How is the State Department not issuing its internal propaganda caused something in Ferguson?
[02:50:57.254 --> 02:51:08.840]  Well, what I'm meaning is that it's because of that, is that now I've been seeing certain, you know, just the way the news is being disseminated about it, it's really, you know, really one-sided.
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:11.802]  Oh yeah, I mean, they've got the CIA and the Pentagon on record
[02:51:12.642 --> 02:51:12.802]  I think?
[02:51:32.270 --> 02:51:35.112]  You know, FBI informants making stuff up about you.
[02:51:35.112 --> 02:51:36.953]  I mean, they are out in force now.
[02:51:36.953 --> 02:51:41.956]  They're definitely putting their people on the street to come after folks.
[02:51:41.956 --> 02:51:43.937]  Joel Skousen, your comment on that?
[02:51:43.937 --> 02:51:54.503]  Well, I don't see any actual effect of that legislation because the State Department has been corrupt for many, many years prior to that and never would tell us the truth anyway.
[02:51:54.503 --> 02:51:56.725]  The media has also been controlled for decades.
[02:51:57.545 --> 02:52:08.929]  I really see that there's been a seamless disinformation pattern that's only continuing, not that there's been any particular cause and effect from that particular legislative change.
[02:52:08.929 --> 02:52:09.790]  Interesting though, caller.
[02:52:09.790 --> 02:52:11.450]  Thank you for calling.
[02:52:11.450 --> 02:52:13.591]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air with Joel Skousen.
[02:52:14.764 --> 02:52:17.166]  Yes, good afternoon Alex and Joel.
[02:52:17.166 --> 02:52:18.547]  Thanks for all your great work.
[02:52:18.547 --> 02:52:20.829]  Goes without saying, but thank you anyway.
[02:52:20.829 --> 02:52:34.922]  Alex, you've mentioned in recent weeks about a laboratory where there were pigs and sheep that were kept in two different locations in the laboratory, I believe, or they were sharing the same space.
[02:52:35.825 --> 02:52:46.871]  But one of these creatures, or types of creature, either the pigs or the sheep, spread the Ebola to the other group.
[02:52:46.871 --> 02:52:50.853]  Yeah, that was in Africa, I forget which country, it's mainstream news, years ago.
[02:52:50.853 --> 02:52:55.456]  And it was in 2012, there was a CDC report on it.
[02:52:55.456 --> 02:52:57.637]  It spread from monkeys to pigs.
[02:52:58.337 --> 02:53:07.967]  And they had another study where it spread from pigs to something else, but they believe that was just in the pigs sneezing or the monkeys sneezing, and then it drifts over.
[02:53:07.967 --> 02:53:09.268]  It's not truly airborne.
[02:53:11.646 --> 02:53:25.677]  Uh, if you go to 1990, go into their archives of public broadcasting systems, PBS, uh... Yeah, we've played the clip where it went airborne, monkey to monkey in a facility, but it was not a type of Ebola humans can get.
[02:53:25.677 --> 02:53:28.599]  But yes, I'm aware of that, uh, NOVA special.
[02:53:28.599 --> 02:53:30.261]  We've, uh, cue that clip up, guys.
[02:53:30.261 --> 02:53:31.382]  Uh, is that the point you're getting to?
[02:53:33.023 --> 02:53:44.591]  Actually, from there all the way up to the present, Alex and Joel, the lady, the nurse that treated Mr. Duncan, contracted Ebola, with full precautions.
[02:53:44.591 --> 02:53:59.481]  So, by process of elimination, I don't think it being very likely, I think it being definite that she caught it through her breathing, because I was the only inlet in that room from the man's condition.
[02:53:59.821 --> 02:54:07.260]  She could get on the face mask and then she goes to another room and takes it off with her hands or touches it.
[02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:09.184]  Let's go to Joel Scouse and get his take on this, Joel.
[02:54:10.467 --> 02:54:32.506]  Yeah, the reason that that has to be true, the break in the protocol, is that it clearly isn't just physical contact, but certainly if you have his micro drops on your mask and you put your hand up to take the mask off, or even touch your gloves as you're taking your gloves off, and then touch your mouth, etc., you can contract the virus.
[02:54:32.506 --> 02:54:37.931]  But we know, at least so far from the other people that have been incubated, that it isn't being transferred
[02:54:38.551 --> 02:54:41.013]  Very easily simply by being in the same room.
[02:54:41.013 --> 02:54:58.585]  I think it has to be micro droplets either through laughing or spitting But it's more transferable in the CDC's been saying that someone needs to vomit right on an open wound to get it That's that's just over-the-top Absolutely true Thank You caller good to hear from you Rick in Texas here on the air with Alex Jones and Joel Skousen.
[02:54:58.585 --> 02:55:02.328]  Thanks for calling How are you doing Alex good brother?
[02:55:03.672 --> 02:55:09.153]  Listen, Joe, I don't... Alex, you probably won't remember, but Joe, you might.
[02:55:09.153 --> 02:55:19.335]  Back in 67, 68, the Rolling Stones came out with an album called Satanic Majesty's Request.
[02:55:19.335 --> 02:55:23.756]  And there was a song that they did called Symphony of the Devil.
[02:55:23.756 --> 02:55:32.698]  Now, back in those days, in that psychedelic rock thing that was going on, and I remember because I was right in the middle of it, you gave your soul up.
[02:55:33.436 --> 02:55:49.231]  And what you did on Acid, you listened to these albums and, I mean, The Beatles, there was Crystal Blue Persuasion, all these groups back then, you would get a reward.
[02:55:49.231 --> 02:55:52.475]  And when you gave your soul up, I never did, I couldn't do it.
[02:55:53.248 --> 02:55:57.332]  By the way, John Lennon began to criticize it and say it was a satanic conspiracy.
[02:55:57.332 --> 02:55:58.173]  I've heard the recordings.
[02:55:58.173 --> 02:55:58.913]  I ought to play them here.
[02:55:58.913 --> 02:56:03.958]  I mean, they're out there, and that's when they went and killed him, from my view, is when he started, you know, turning against them.
[02:56:03.958 --> 02:56:06.781]  But definitely, out there, that's going on.
[02:56:06.781 --> 02:56:09.163]  I mean, most of the rock and roll and music, I don't think that's what's going on.
[02:56:09.163 --> 02:56:12.566]  But definitely, some of those groups are on record saying that's what they were doing.
[02:56:12.566 --> 02:56:14.108]  Let me get Joel Skousen's take on that.
[02:56:15.222 --> 02:56:17.023]  No, I completely agree with the caller.
[02:56:17.023 --> 02:56:23.047]  The Rolling Stones have had considerable documentation about the satanic and occult connection.
[02:56:23.047 --> 02:56:33.354]  But almost any of the great, whether it's from the Bee Gees or the Beatles, you know, have had their boost from some unknown source that really ties in there.
[02:56:33.354 --> 02:56:35.535]  And it's not very obvious.
[02:56:35.535 --> 02:56:38.177]  You can't prove these things by ordinary biographies.
[02:56:38.177 --> 02:56:40.619]  But the people who knew them and were close to them
[02:56:41.179 --> 02:56:49.366]  Have been able to document that something happened once they made a pact and went forward and rocketed to success.
[02:56:49.366 --> 02:56:55.972]  And part of it, of course, comes from the satanic inspiration in driving both words and music.
[02:56:55.972 --> 02:56:57.994]  Satanic inspiration, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:57.994 --> 02:56:58.975]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:56:58.975 --> 02:57:00.336]  Rick, thank you.
[02:57:00.336 --> 02:57:01.517]  JD in New Mexico.
[02:57:01.517 --> 02:57:02.137]  You're on the air.
[02:57:02.137 --> 02:57:02.518]  Go ahead.
[02:57:03.854 --> 02:57:05.536]  Thanks for the time, Alex.
[02:57:05.536 --> 02:57:11.962]  I actually have a question aimed to Joel, but I would love to get an answer from you as well, Alex.
[02:57:11.962 --> 02:57:15.225]  I'm a believer of the post-tribulation rapture.
[02:57:15.225 --> 02:57:21.191]  I was wondering how he feels if we're in the tribulation as of right now.
[02:57:23.146 --> 02:57:24.307]  I actually do not.
[02:57:24.307 --> 02:57:44.124]  I think the tribulation becomes much more horrific later on, probably after this nuclear preemptive strike on American military would get us into a global new world order, and the globalists give an order that we need to lock up those people who believe that we were responsible for this war, responsible for 9-11, lock up conspiracy believers.
[02:57:44.124 --> 02:57:44.464]  I think
[02:57:45.265 --> 02:57:56.992]  Constitutional conservatives and conspiracy believers will be the Jews of World War III, and that's where the real serious tribulation against real fundamentalist Christians who believe in truth take place.
[02:57:56.992 --> 02:58:01.955]  Powerfully said, because all the real preparation, not just here but worldwide, is not for radical Islam.
[02:58:01.955 --> 02:58:02.956]  They're funding that.
[02:58:02.956 --> 02:58:09.660]  It is to go after people that will not, you know, endorse abortion and endorse death and shine on to Satan.
[02:58:11.178 --> 02:58:22.623]  And I think the Savior has to come, really, to save the world that is almost totally under the grip of Satan, except in pockets of resistance, which are probably crying day and night for deliverance.
[02:58:22.623 --> 02:58:25.104]  Does that answer your question, caller?
[02:58:25.104 --> 02:58:29.046]  Do you believe that the rapture is going to be post-tribulation?
[02:58:30.020 --> 02:58:30.721]  Yes, I do.
[02:58:30.721 --> 02:58:32.242]  Yeah, a five-year-old could read the Bible.
[02:58:32.242 --> 02:58:33.764]  I mean, I'm sorry, and see, it says that.
[02:58:33.764 --> 02:58:38.328]  I mean, the beast wages war on the saints and overcomes them.
[02:58:38.328 --> 02:58:42.071]  I mean, it's right there that there's a war and you get persecuted.
[02:58:42.071 --> 02:58:45.935]  All these churches are state-run that tell you you're going to be teleported out of here, folks.
[02:58:45.935 --> 02:58:47.116]  Joel, you've already done two hours.
[02:58:47.116 --> 02:58:49.278]  Let's put bookends on it, five more.
[02:58:49.278 --> 02:58:49.699]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.768 --> 02:58:57.932]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:58:57.932 --> 02:59:00.274]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:59:00.274 --> 02:59:05.557]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:59:05.557 --> 02:59:10.740]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:13.762]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:59:14.042 --> 02:59:18.125]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:59:18.125 --> 02:59:22.449]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:59:22.449 --> 02:59:32.677]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:59:32.677 --> 02:59:35.199]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:59:35.339 --> 02:59:36.039]  Coast to coast.
[02:59:36.039 --> 02:59:36.779]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:36.779 --> 02:59:39.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.874 --> 03:00:08.174]  Big Brother.
[03:00:08.174 --> 03:00:09.955]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:09.955 --> 03:00:11.695]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.695 --> 03:00:13.295]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.295 --> 03:00:14.836]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.836 --> 03:00:19.017]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:19.017 --> 03:00:23.658]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.658 --> 03:00:27.779]  For those that don't know, there's been congressional hearings about it in the 70s and 80s.
[03:00:27.779 --> 03:00:32.700]  I grew up in Dallas around a bunch of the famous televangelists, hung out with their kids.
[03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:34.160]  They were just all incredibly wild.
[03:00:36.232 --> 03:00:37.332]  Almost all of them.
[03:00:37.332 --> 03:00:39.713]  Still joke about a preacher's daughter.
[03:00:39.713 --> 03:00:41.554]  The wildest one in the town.
[03:00:41.554 --> 03:00:42.614]  I mean, some famous ones.
[03:00:42.614 --> 03:00:44.255]  Household names, you know who those people are.
[03:00:44.255 --> 03:00:47.356]  And it was all just completely fake.
[03:00:47.356 --> 03:00:52.957]  And my parents were Christians, and they weren't, you know, Pharisee-type, saying how great they were, but they loved God.
[03:00:52.957 --> 03:00:55.558]  And, you know, we got a tear in their eye when praying.
[03:00:55.558 --> 03:01:00.320]  They were just abhorred, these people, that lived in and around us, in the community we lived in.
[03:01:02.265 --> 03:01:10.489]  And when you look at the churches today, in the last 200 years, teaching this pre-tribulation rapture, it's not in the Bible.
[03:01:10.489 --> 03:01:19.813]  Anybody could read Daniel or Ezekiel or Revelation and see that the devil sets up a world government, says pledge to it, and goes around killing people.
[03:01:19.813 --> 03:01:24.055]  And then, when Christ defeats the Antichrist, then the dead in Christ rise.
[03:01:24.055 --> 03:01:31.178]  And there's a thousand year reign with God's people, the people that went through it, who are still alive.
[03:01:32.273 --> 03:01:34.994]  The dead are risen, their spirits to them be with God.
[03:01:34.994 --> 03:01:46.360]  A five-year-old could read that, and it shows the grand delusion, because you can't have this happen unless the churches have been taken over and believe that they're not going to have to go through anything.
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:50.261]  Look at what happened to Christ and all the disciples in the Old Testament, how they were persecuted.
[03:01:50.261 --> 03:01:51.042]  Joel, I'm ranting.
[03:01:51.042 --> 03:01:57.965]  I wanted you to put bookends on this, because even if you were an anthropologist or sociologist or psychologist, let's say we don't believe in God, hypothetically.
[03:01:58.385 --> 03:01:59.525]  The elite do.
[03:01:59.525 --> 03:02:01.826]  World government's forming, just as the Bible said it would.
[03:02:01.826 --> 03:02:05.227]  Ten kingdoms, three regions, all of it.
[03:02:05.227 --> 03:02:08.068]  But the Christians all think, oh, thank God it's getting bad.
[03:02:08.068 --> 03:02:12.730]  We're going to be teleported up like to the star deck of the Enterprise any minute.
[03:02:12.730 --> 03:02:16.111]  What are they going to think when the chips start rolling out in the world government?
[03:02:16.111 --> 03:02:19.712]  I mean, what are they going to do when they keep thinking they're going to get raptured?
[03:02:19.712 --> 03:02:20.312]  Joel Skousen.
[03:02:22.073 --> 03:02:36.325]  Well, you know, I think Satan realizes that he can't actually destroy people's innate, inborn feeling that there is a God and their attraction to Christianity, so he has to corrupt it in the process, and he does so by what I call soft doctrine.
[03:02:36.325 --> 03:02:36.766]  In other words,
[03:02:37.446 --> 03:02:40.927]  You preach to people that Christ's love is totally unconditional.
[03:02:40.927 --> 03:02:45.469]  What I do, He loves us and loves Satan as much as anyone else.
[03:02:45.469 --> 03:02:48.590]  Personally, I think that God can only love that which is good and true.
[03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:58.973]  He can have an outstretched arm calling to those in charity to repent and giving them opportunities and sending them messages in conscience to try to bring them.
[03:02:58.973 --> 03:03:05.435]  But you know, He does love the pure in heart, as the Savior said, and that's where His true love is.
[03:03:06.115 --> 03:03:17.620]  But, you know, they also teach the doctrine that, you know, you've had a born-again experience, you don't have to do anything else, you don't have to follow the promptings of the Spirit, you don't have to follow the commandments, you're just saved.
[03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:26.544]  And while there is grace, that grace is that continual flow of revelation to us, of inspiration to try to keep us on track, and we are responsible.
[03:03:27.344 --> 03:03:30.345]  To listen to those prophecies.
[03:03:30.345 --> 03:03:44.931]  I've had this nightmare, you know, of getting on the other side someday and reaching the Savior and wanting to embrace Him and have Him put out His arm and say, now wait a minute, before you say you love me, you have to explain why you told me to get lost 150,000 times.
[03:03:44.931 --> 03:03:47.933]  And you know, we say is in the biblical scripture, wherein did I ask?
[03:03:48.999 --> 03:03:50.020]  Did you appear to me?
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:52.742]  Wherein did you ask me to do something?
[03:03:52.742 --> 03:03:54.063]  And it was in your conscience.
[03:03:54.063 --> 03:03:57.746]  It was those hundreds of thousands of little messages.
[03:03:57.746 --> 03:03:59.048]  And that's my message, you know.
[03:03:59.048 --> 03:04:00.869]  And I think this has been a great show today, Alex.
[03:04:00.869 --> 03:04:05.513]  We've talked about something, you know, we don't normally hear on this subject on the radio.
[03:04:05.513 --> 03:04:11.038]  But it's the core of what people need to do to survive in the last days.
[03:04:11.038 --> 03:04:12.959]  Yes, strategic relocation is important.
[03:04:12.959 --> 03:04:14.581]  Securing a home is important.
[03:04:14.581 --> 03:04:15.822]  Having a safe room is important.
[03:04:15.822 --> 03:04:17.143]  But if you don't have good judgment,
[03:04:17.763 --> 03:04:29.674]  If you aren't listening to the promptings warning you when the knock is coming next week to your door to be able to get out safely, then I think it will be for naught.
[03:04:29.674 --> 03:04:36.320]  I just, as the evil rises, I can feel my relationship to God getting stronger.
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:41.966]  And I'm just, once you have that discernment, you're like ashamed because you realize how evil you are.
[03:04:42.631 --> 03:04:45.393]  And I look at other people who just are totally worldly and care less.
[03:04:45.393 --> 03:04:46.935]  I just feel sorry for them, Joel.
[03:04:46.935 --> 03:04:49.417]  Because they have no idea what's coming, how real this all is.
[03:04:49.417 --> 03:04:51.659]  Joel Scouser, WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[03:04:51.659 --> 03:04:53.120]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:54.822]  Very powerful interview.
[03:04:54.822 --> 03:04:55.582]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:55.582 --> 03:04:56.983]  I've enjoyed it.
[03:04:56.983 --> 03:04:57.444]  All right, folks.
[03:04:57.444 --> 03:04:58.365]  Nightly News Tonight at 7.
