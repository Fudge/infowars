[00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:12.638]  The first patient diagnosed with Ebola has been confirmed here in the U.S.
[00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:16.881]  There is another enterovirus that has been spreading across the country.
[00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:20.144]  It's already claimed the life of one child today in Rhode Island.
[00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:28.430]  And now there is another mosquito-borne virus that's making its way up from Latin America and it could be a problem for the U.S.
[00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.151]  here shortly.
[00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:31.313]  This is the chikungunya virus.
[00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:34.634]  And it is an excruciating mosquito-borne illness.
[00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:40.555]  It arrived less than a year ago in the Americas, and it's already infected more than a million people so far.
[00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:47.797]  Sufferers complain of days of pain and misery, including joint pain so severe that it can be hard to walk.
[00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:52.658]  The carrier of the disease is the genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquito.
[00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:58.599]  Now, this mosquito was tweaked to help control populations of mosquitoes that carry dengue fever.
[00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.682]  But now this mosquito has a viral disease of its own.
[00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:06.165]  In 2010, we reported that the U.N.
[00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:13.451]  announced plans to combat dengue fever and other mosquito-borne illnesses with genetically modified mosquitoes.
[00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:20.838]  Now, these mosquitoes were designed to make them sterile or to simply just kill off the mosquitoes that carry dengue fever.
[00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:26.543]  Lo and behold, this project was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:36.086]  And as mosquitoes are seen mostly as a nuisance, there was very little debate about meddling with nature by introducing billions of new organisms into the system.
[00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:45.189]  Kind of like there has been very little debate about bringing patients with Ebola into America or refusing to block the flights from the Ebola zone.
[00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:53.032]  Or even enforcing a mandatory quarantine for those people who fly in to other countries from the Ebola zone.
[00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:58.575]  Seems a little crazy, unless that's your plan is to bring Ebola into the country.
[00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:07.219]  Now, the reason why I bring up this particular chikungunya virus is that the Aedes aegypti mosquito has been relevant before
[00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.260]  Particularly when it comes to Project Artichoke.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.841]  Of course, that is a secret CIA mind control program.
[00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:23.043]  And in this particular instance with the mosquito, they were seeking to find ways to spread a virus that could be an incapacitant.
[00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:30.386]  Not necessarily something that would be deadly for a population, but something that would, of course, destabilize a region.
[00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:34.248]  Dengue fever has a hidden history.
[00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:43.976]  It has been the intense focus of US Army and CIA biological warfare researchers for over 50 years, similar to the Ebola virus.
[00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:53.345]  Now as we've mentioned, we have bio-warfare centers in the Ebola zone doing human tests there in Sierra Leone.
[00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:58.467]  Coincidentally, at the exact same time of this current Ebola outbreak.
[00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:05.451]  Now, here is a great article titled, Dengue Fever Outbreak Leads Back to CIA and Army Experiments.
[00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:17.598]  Several CIA documents, as well as the findings of a 1975 congressional committee, reveal that several sites in Florida were used for experiments with mosquito-borne dengue fever.
[00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:25.964]  One site was Avon Park, which consisted of newly constructed public housing projects for low-income African American families.
[00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:35.070]  And it was here that specially equipped aircraft dropped 600,000 mosquitoes in purpose-built paper bags from above.
[00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:39.594]  And besides dengue fever, some of these mosquitoes were also carrying yellow fever.
[00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:48.517]  Now, just shortly thereafter, in the spring and summer of 1981, Cuba experienced a severe hemorrhagic dengue fever outbreak.
[00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:52.199]  They reported 10,000 people a day coming down with this disease.
[00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.399]  More than 100,000 people were hospitalized.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.662]  And this is in addition to a severe swine flu outbreak that Fidel Castro attributed to the CIA.
[00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:12.405]  Now Alvarelli reports that former Fort Detrick researchers told him that they performed advance work on the Cuba outbreak and that it was indeed man-made.
[00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:20.508]  The CIA was also accused of launching dengue epidemics in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nicaragua in the 80s as well.
[00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:32.256]  Now, release of these bioweapons, while not necessarily deadly, it could serve to incapacitate and destabilize those regions whose political ideology does not agree with ours.
[00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:33.357]  The U.S.
[00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:39.541]  government has subjected people to all sorts of experimentation in the past to further their agenda.
[00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:43.444]  There is highly documented historical evidence of malfeasance.
[00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:52.949]  So, it is justified to question their motives, especially considering the absolute power they have to enforce mandatory vaccines.
[00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.811]  So, just consider the track record of the U.S.
[00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:56.211]  government.
[00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:57.552]  They are morally capable.
[00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:00.074]  They are technically capable of doing this.
[00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:07.298]  They have no ethical concerns when it comes to using bioweapons on their political enemies as well as American citizens.
[00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:12.541]  It's becoming clearer by the day that the government sees its citizens as enemy number one.
[00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:25.571]  So, is it a stretch to say that they could create a deliberate Ebola pandemic that would not only enrich transnational pharmaceutical corporations, but it would also further their police state agenda?
[00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:39.709]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:49.917]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:53.920]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.182]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:05.784]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:06:06.104 --> 00:06:08.385]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
