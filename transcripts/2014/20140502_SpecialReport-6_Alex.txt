[00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:08.034]  An often overlooked link that ties many domestic terror suspects together is their relationship with federal authorities.
[00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.816]  Case in point, the recent shooter in Kansas.
[00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:20.701]  It's been reported that Frazier Glenn Cross, originally Frazier Glenn Miller, became a federal flunky to reduce his jail time for KKK activities years ago.
[00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:28.905]  Upon his release from jail, reports claim Cross became a paid informant until the shootings in Overland Park, Kansas, where he targeted the Jewish community.
[00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:38.388]  From shootings to bombings, lawyers for alleged Boston bomber Zohar Zarnaev say that the FBI had numerous contacts with their client's older brother Tamerlan.
[00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:47.292]  This fits in with the mother of the Zarnaev brothers stating that the FBI contacted Tamerlan after the bombings and before he was listed as a suspect.
[00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:57.597]  Not to mention Tamerlan attending CIA-sponsored workshops, and the DHS and FBI being briefed to Tamerlan's activities well before the bombing in Boston.
[00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.579]  But sometimes feds need their informants active on the digital plane.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:15.527]  Court documents show that Hector Monsinger, the FBI informant who ratted out hackers from the groups LulzSec and Anonymous, directed hundreds of cyberattacks against the government websites of Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Brazil, and others.
[00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:20.856]  And if you're convinced that all of the prior are simply isolated incidents, watch this.
[00:01:21.584 --> 00:01:34.907]  If you ask the leadership of the FBI, most of whose field agents are tireless, dedicated, Constitution-supporting professionals, it will tell you that it, the FBI, has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:42.189]  What it will not tell you is that there have been 20 foiled plots, and of them, three were interrupted by members of the public.
[00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.870]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.551]  One of the incidents Judge Napolitano goes on to point out is the underwear bomber.
[00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:57.513]  Info Wars talked with eyewitness Kurt Haskell about what he saw on the underwear bomber flight.
[00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:09.439]  In January 2010 we had hearings in Congress on this where we had Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy come out and if you watch the video of him it's pretty telling that he's
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.221]  Thank you!
[00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:28.196]  You know, we knew Abdulmutallab was a terrorist.
[00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:32.438]  We wanted to stop him from coming in the country and revoke his visa.
[00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:45.564]  There have been numerous cases where our unilateral and uncoordinated revocation of the visa would have disrupted important investigations that were underway by one of our national security partners.
[00:02:46.244 --> 00:03:03.910]  They had the individual under investigation and our revocation action would have disclosed US government's interest in that individual and ended our colleagues ability such as the FBI to pursue the case quietly and to identify terrorist plans and co-conspirators.
[00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.531]  But we had a request.
[00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:22.260]  from an intelligence agency and he didn't say which one what he said was we'll talk about in closed session and he said we had a request from an intelligence agency that they're tracking Abdulmutallab they want to let him into the US to follow him and to catch bigger fish
[00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:35.590]  And they honored that request in order to let whatever intelligence agency do their business so that they wouldn't knock out one lone soldier in the war on terror and they could essentially follow him in the U.S.
[00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.650]  and catch accomplices.
[00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.051]  So that's what they admitted to.
[00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:44.596]  But Patrick Kennedy went on to say there's more to this, we need to talk about it in closed session and that's kind of where it ended.
[00:03:46.777 --> 00:03:49.178]  Obviously, I don't believe that for a minute.
[00:03:49.698 --> 00:04:03.721]  What I believe through, and what's been shown through the evidence I believe, is that an intelligence agency gave Abdulmutallab an intentionally defective bomb and put him on the plane to stage a fake terrorist attack.
[00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:08.582]  And we'll end looking at the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
[00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:16.183]  Last winter, the FBI was praised for its speed in cracking the case of the World Trade Center bombing and bringing four suspects to trial.
[00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:26.071]  Now, there is some evidence that the FBI may have known of the plot in advance, through an informant, and might, might even have stopped the bombing that killed six people.
[00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:33.237]  FBI agents might have been able to prevent last February's deadly explosion at New York's World Trade Center.
[00:04:33.617 --> 00:04:41.883]  They discussed secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, but they didn't, according to the FBI's own informant, Imad Salem.
[00:04:42.524 --> 00:04:47.687]  Unbeknownst to the FBI at the time, Salem recorded many of his conversations with his handlers.
[00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:52.931]  You got paid regularly for good information, if that's what you think is fine.
[00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:59.624]  But I don't think that because we was start already building the bomb which is went off in the World Trade Center.
[00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:10.439]  It was built by supervising, supervision from the Bureau and the TA and we was all informed about it and we know that the bomb start to be built.
[00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:11.739]  By who?
[00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.660]  By your confidential informant.
[00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:15.702]  What a wonderful great case.
[00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:17.243]  Did you hear that?
[00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:22.048]  The informant claims he built the bomb under the direction of the FBI.
