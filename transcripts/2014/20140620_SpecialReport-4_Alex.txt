[00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:05.103]  So, I just had a few questions.
[00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:08.526]  We're out here doing this investigation of the illegal immigration.
[00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:13.310]  They come here, they're being picked up by these church groups, they're being housed in military facilities.
[00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:19.095]  So, yeah, I know it's nothing new for them to come across the border, but, you know, the influx, what do you think the real influx started?
[00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:21.557]  Well, an emergency, a huge influx.
[00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:24.019]  It didn't end with children.
[00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.680]  Children.
[00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:33.244]  What are you guys doing to help keep the diseases or the sickness to a minimum?
[00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:40.587]  Are you guys giving them any type of medication in your facilities?
[00:00:57.692 --> 00:01:06.757]  They go through a lengthy screening process, going through chest x-rays, septic fibrosis, things of that nature.
[00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:10.179]  And they're treated, for the most part.
[00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.063]  Most people are, they are mandatory detention.
[00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:22.105]  And see, that's where most of our bed space goes, from mandatory detention.
[00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:25.747]  Therefore, that's the reason why a lot of these females
[00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:27.977]  It's all about money.
[00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.089]  It's all about money.
[00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.070]  It's all Congress, man.
[00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.411]  It's all, you know, that's where it's going to go.
[00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:40.931]  I'm in Washington.
[00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:42.651]  It's where all the shots are called, man, you know?
[00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.352]  As an American, who wouldn't have any type of concerns?
[00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:10.573]  These issues are paramount man, you know what I mean?
[00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:13.935]  Not only that, medical benefits.
[00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:19.457]  Medical benefits that you see are being given, it's pretty far out man.
[00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:31.421]  Considering we have people here at home that need to... Just give me a final message to the American people, not so much to any particular politician, but if you could talk to the American people directly about this issue, what would you say to them?
[00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:34.182]  Put pressure on Congress.
[00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.011]  Elaborate on that.
[00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:51.121]  Well, Congress, they're the ones that determine the money.
[00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.903]  They're the ones that determine where the money is allocated.
[00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:56.765]  They determine everyone's budget.
[00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:00.127]  And without a larger budget, we can't do more.
[00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:03.390]  You staff more people on the board, you're going to catch more people.
[00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.586]  If you take more people away from the border, you're not going to catch as many people.
[00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:16.882]  I definitely appreciate your time and your willingness to speak to us on this issue, and I hope you guys get the help and the assistance that you need to secure our nation's border.
[00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:26.790]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.090]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.891]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.072]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:39.512]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:46.794]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:58.040]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.621]  We are the resistance.
[00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:01.262]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:03.183]  You are the info war.
[00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:07.465]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.326]  We are the true media.
[00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:12.048]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:15.789]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
