[00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:05.574]  The recent comments of the NBA's Donald Sterling have sparked much controversy.
[00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:18.345]  And while I don't agree with Sterling, the most interesting thing following his leaked phone conversation isn't that he's been asked to relinquish the LA Clippers, it's that it's set a precedent to go after anyone in the league for seemingly any reason.
[00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:28.468]  Doug Davos, whose family owns the Orlando Magic, is now being targeted for his support of traditional marriage, with pundits and activists alike deeming him a homophobe.
[00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:37.211]  Seems like the naysayers are much more concerned with thought crimes than physical crimes, such as US-funded jihadists crucifying Christians in Syria.
[00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:45.894]  In theory, this could have been an international news story if the jihadists had recorded themselves talking about the crucifixion instead of actually carrying it out.
[00:00:46.554 --> 00:01:01.949]  And finally, the thought crime in Oklahoma of someone having the audacity to donate the Ten Commandments to state Capitol grounds was so offensive to devil worshippers in New York that they want to place a quote, child-friendly Lucifer at the Capitol grounds as well.
[00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:08.275]  A member from the Satanic Temple says that one could even sit on the statue's lap and take a selfie with Baphomet.
[00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:13.561]  So it's not okay when Christians do it, but if Luciferians do it, then it's just fine.
[00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.825]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:30.987]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.350]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.052]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:42.338]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:48.364]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:52.247]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:55.370]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.536]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:05.858]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:06.959]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:16.048]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
