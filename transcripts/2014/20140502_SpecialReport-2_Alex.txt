[00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.251]  How certain are you that people got tickets they didn't deserve?
[00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.513]  Well I can tell you citizens got tickets that they didn't deserve.
[00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:14.756]  Smith says the issue is one of the reasons why he resigned from the department in December.
[00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:23.421]  Department officials meanwhile say they are confident that no citations were issued unjustly and that the concerns are unwarranted.
[00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:24.101]  That was
[00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:24.641]  Here's what's next!
[00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.373]  This is the Nightscope K5.
[00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:44.014]  It's an autonomous data machine.
[00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:47.056]  The intent is to predict and prevent crime.
[00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:52.040]  Then over on the side, we have a license plate recognition system.
[00:00:52.621 --> 00:01:04.029]  So the robot, as it's driving around, it can capture up to 300 license plates per minute, run those against either a white list or a black list, or even the national local criminal databases determine if there's anybody in the area who shouldn't be.
[00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:12.297]  Anyone who's ever had a ticket dispute knows how difficult the situation can be, even though you're talking with a human who, in theory, has reasoning skills.
[00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:19.783]  So what then, when this robo-revenue generator coldly issues you a ticket without taking into account real-life variables?
[00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:24.606]  I'm sure that some will point out how supposedly cost effective the bots can be.
[00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:30.169]  No sick pay, no vacation time, but that's not to say that the machines are otherwise perfect.
[00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.211]  Another recent Texas story shows a $250,000 drone crashing into water.
[00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:40.615]  How many man hours were needed to retrieve the supposedly cost-effective device?
[00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:44.576]  And that's not to mention the serious safety concern of a crashing drone.
[00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:56.561]  So with drones walking the streets, weaponized drones scraping the skies, and cameras monitoring cities in real time, looks like the only future in law enforcement will be monitoring the machines when they go bad.

[00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:12.900]  Friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.322]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:23.683]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:25.605]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
