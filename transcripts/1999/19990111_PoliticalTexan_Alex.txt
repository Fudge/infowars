[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.290]  There are global corporations.
[00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.111]  They have billions that they pay.
[00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.072]  To the greedy politicians who make sure things go their way.
[00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.272]  They tax us with the poverty we live from day to day.
[00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:19.453]  To send words you wouldn't share, you don't yet have a say.
[00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:23.314]  You want to crack this Constitution, is that what's in the plan?
[00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:27.317]  I'm going to take my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:35.162]  In every case in history, when genocide was slammed, the firearms were gathered up and the officers were banned.
[00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:38.905]  The tyrants made distractions and the people looked away.
[00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:49.893]  And by the time they realized they couldn't get away, the smiling face on my face said, We should all join hands and help create the future of a new world or the flag.
[00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:51.874]  Hello, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:52.855]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:56.816]  We are live this Monday evening right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:06.275]  my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.676]  Hello, Austin, Texas.
[00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:09.915]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:14.756]  We are live this Monday evening right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:20.155]  It is Monday, January 11, 1999.
[00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.030]  One day closer to victory.
[00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:27.254]  Now, Dateline NBC last night, a month late, aired a U.N.
[00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:27.894]  whitewash.
[00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:35.659]  We're going to play it in its entirety, 15 minutes long, and when we come back, we will critique it.
[00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.240]  I'll give you a few of the basic faults.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.181]  Number one, the moral is the U.N.
[00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:45.706]  needs more funding, more power, more international court jurisdiction because they can't control their peacekeepers.
[00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:49.488]  Number two, they need to have more training and more money.
[00:01:49.918 --> 00:02:00.285]  Number three and most important, the United Nations and its peacekeepers murdered at least 500,000 people or helped the Hutus do it in 1996.
[00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:05.047]  We've documented this ad nauseam for over two years since we were alerted to this.
[00:02:05.728 --> 00:02:10.511]  There have been convictions by Belgium, by Italy, and by Canada.
[00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:27.171]  This piece also doesn't go into any depth about how the UN defended these people, and it wasn't until the country's own judicial system brought them to trial and brought them to conviction because they videotaped some of the murders.
[00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.474]  You will only hear about Somalia.
[00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:33.137]  You will only hear about Haiti.
[00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:48.265]  Which is one-one-thousandth of the genocide that was perpetrated by the United Nations and caught the then-head of peacekeeping of the United Nations, who is now the Secretary General who filled the lofty shoes of Boutros Boutros Ghali.
[00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.266]  So again, we are live tonight.
[00:02:52.107 --> 00:02:58.390]  We are going until 10 o'clock, and then from 10 to 10.30, you want to tune over to C-SPAN.
[00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.291]  I forget which one of the C-SPAN channels.
[00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:02.732]  I believe we're carrying it in this area, and I believe C-SPAN is.
[00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.144]  And they're going to have Larry Flint bringing out a bunch of dirt.
[00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:07.605]  It'll be very entertaining for you.
[00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:19.432]  And also, it might be interesting, in his new non-pornographic issue called The Flint Files, Larry Flint, the publisher of Hustler and many other magazines.
[00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.733]  So that's going to be coming out with a lot of fireworks.
[00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:32.920]  If you want to see Bill Clinton in action with Terry Lindner, former CIA head counsel during NK Ultra hearings, and their minion, their way to put out this information, Larry Flint, you want to
[00:03:33.962 --> 00:03:36.244]  Check that out on C-SPAN from 10 to 10.30.
[00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:40.849]  Then you can tune away from that press conference in Larry Flynt's offices.
[00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.971]  We're told it's being carried in this area on C-SPAN.
[00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:46.415]  Back to, is it channel 10 or 16, Mike?
[00:03:49.478 --> 00:03:53.642]  Either 10 or 16, we believe it's 10, tonight at 10.30 for an hour and a half special.
[00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:57.266]  We're going to play the smart growth piece, maybe even the truck police piece.
[00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:02.006]  And we're going to replay this Dateline NBC piece and go back through this.
[00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:14.112]  We're also going to cover, in this hour, international police agencies, the trial of Bill Clinton beginning, and a lot of other vital information right here on the Freedom Report every Monday night from 9 to 10 o'clock.
[00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:16.193]  I want to thank the big crew we got up there tonight.
[00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:21.135]  I got here late, about 10 minutes before airtime, and I didn't have a lot of time to help out.
[00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:22.335]  I want to thank the crew.
[00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:25.477]  We've got a lot of good people back there.
[00:04:26.138 --> 00:04:27.019]  And this is live.
[00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.161]  We're going to go right to the Dateline NBC piece from last night.
[00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:35.584]  A massive whitewash live last night from Rockefeller Center.
[00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:40.768]  Dateline NBC based right above the United Nations.
[00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:46.071]  This is a huge whitewash, a soft soap, because they're losing credibility, guys.
[00:04:46.131 --> 00:04:47.452]  There's Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife.
[00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:51.315]  You heard the job that they had at the UN.
[00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:56.838]  They gave another Austrian SS officer, Kurt Voltheim, the job in 1972-82.
[00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.580]  This is what it comes down to, guys.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:12.768]  Live from Rockefeller Center, they broadcast this propaganda and really are trying to gain some of the credibility that they've lost because of alternative media like this program and hundreds of others across the nation.
[00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:14.969]  You see, this program just isn't seen here in Austin.
[00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.252]  It goes down to around 40 access stations that I know of and growing.
[00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.351]  Of course, it's delayed a month or so by the time it gets out and in place.
[00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:23.752]  But we're moving forward.
[00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:24.713]  I want to thank everybody.
[00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.093]  Take these programs.
[00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:27.274]  Send them to friends and family.
[00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.335]  We show you the twisting and the lies.
[00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:37.960]  We're going to play this part, and later tonight, if we have America's Tour by Design, I just thought of it, we'll play my piece, not as well, uh, lusciously produced with the
[00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:47.891]  $100 million studios at Rockefeller Center, but also have a lot of key information about the United Nations with NAMBLA, United Nations and murder, and much more.
[00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:50.291]  Genocide of 500,000 plus.
[00:05:50.692 --> 00:05:52.272]  It may even go up to 900,000.
[00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:54.573]  The UN murdering people in Rwanda.
[00:05:54.793 --> 00:05:56.073]  But that isn't in this report.
[00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:59.434]  But the court records are there from three separate nations.
[00:05:59.824 --> 00:06:01.487]  But the UN defended him.
[00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:03.089]  I will cease to babble.
[00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.812]  Please sit back and watch this.
[00:06:05.253 --> 00:06:07.236]  When we get back I want to hear your calls.
[00:06:07.577 --> 00:06:10.421]  I want to see if you notice anything that I missed in this report.
[00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:11.824]  This is the Freedom Report.
[00:06:11.844 --> 00:06:12.425]  We'll be right back.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:24.348]  ...put food into the hands of the starving to protect refugees from the bullets of warring factions, to alleviate suffering and to stop torture.
[00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:31.254]  But now, Dateline has uncovered evidence that some of the violence has been committed by the peacekeepers themselves.
[00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.139]  Here's Lee Thompson with a disturbing report about abuse of the powerless.
[00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:48.339]  But we should warn you, it contains graphic pictures of violence.
[00:06:48.254 --> 00:06:49.835]  They're called Blue Helmets.
[00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:54.317]  Peacekeepers from the United Nations send it to hot spots all over the world.
[00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.360]  Their work is hard.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]  They stop fighting.
[00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:03.121]  Deliver food and medicine.
[00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:05.222]  Protect human rights.
[00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:07.524]  And it's dangerous.
[00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:11.746]  More than 500 Blue Helmets have been killed in action in the last 50 years.
[00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:18.133]  These heroic soldiers have even won the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:21.155]  And all of us pay for this good work.
[00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:22.376]  Although the U.S.
[00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:29.800]  owes money to the U.N., American taxpayers still kick in more than $200 million a year for peacekeeping.
[00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:33.282]  I'm sorry.
[00:07:33.502 --> 00:07:34.603]  I had to run back in here.
[00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:35.564]  I apologize.
[00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:40.587]  We missed about the first 10 seconds about how loving and caring and the wonderful aims of the United Nations.
[00:07:40.887 --> 00:07:43.068]  This program, live from Rockefeller Center,
[00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:52.158]  All she had to do was walk downstairs, the reporter, Maria Shriver, Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife, was walk downstairs and tell you how loving they are.
[00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:55.661]  And notice they're saying it's the peacekeepers, rogue elements.
[00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:57.002]  We're rewinding that.
[00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:58.523]  I wanted to get that first part in.
[00:07:58.783 --> 00:08:00.244]  This is just disgusting.
[00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:06.029]  The Rockefellers started the United Nations, built the United Nations as an international imperialist arm.
[00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:07.730]  Now I sound like a communist.
[00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:11.463]  But it's key that I say something to everybody out there.
[00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:12.043]  I'm not.
[00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:13.083]  I'm free market.
[00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:21.346]  And today I was reading some communist magazines and they talk about how wonderful the international community is and how they should work with them.
[00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:22.627]  And I may read some of that tonight.
[00:08:22.927 --> 00:08:26.268]  These socialists don't realize that they work for the very corrupt interests.
[00:08:26.728 --> 00:08:29.489]  You see, the old money is not free market.
[00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:31.109]  The UN is their power arm.
[00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.730]  Now, if we're ready, we'll go back to this.
[00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.591]  I just had to get that first part in there.
[00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:36.611]  I want to play the entire piece.
[00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.572]  We missed the first ten seconds.
[00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:41.313]  This is last night, Dateline NBC, I apologize.
[00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:42.874]  When we get back, we'll take your calls.
[00:08:42.894 --> 00:08:50.941]  From our studios in Los Angeles, here is Maria Shriver.
[00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:52.162]  Good evening.
[00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:55.285]  They are charged with some of the most crucial work on Earth.
[00:08:55.705 --> 00:09:07.215]  For 50 years, UN peacekeepers have been deployed around the globe to put food into the hands of the starving, to protect refugees from the bullets of warring factions, to alleviate suffering, and to stop torture.
[00:09:08.385 --> 00:09:15.270]  Last time, they have Studio A, B, or whatever at Rockefeller Center, and she has hers out at Los Angeles.
[00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.752]  But that will come out in the rest of the program.
[00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:19.193]  I just don't want to sound like I'm full of bull here.
[00:09:19.453 --> 00:09:20.213]  Let's go back.
[00:09:20.313 --> 00:09:26.518]  I know you guys are going to kill me, but this piece makes me so, so angry.
[00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:32.882]  Now, without further ado, we will air this piece for all of you out there.
[00:09:33.183 --> 00:09:33.623]  Let's go ahead.
[00:09:34.258 --> 00:09:40.404]  Now Dateline has uncovered evidence that some of the violence has been committed by the peacekeepers themselves.
[00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:45.269]  Here's Lee Thompson with a disturbing report about abuse of the powerless.
[00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:52.769]  but we should warn you it contains graphic pictures of violence.
[00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:57.369]  [Music]
[00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:59.002]  They're called Blue Helmets.
[00:09:59.382 --> 00:10:03.465]  Peacekeepers from the United Nations send it to hot spots all over the world.
[00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:09.548]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:11.509]  I'm very sorry.
[00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:12.710]  I had to stop it.
[00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.791]  Mike, rewind the tape in front of everybody.
[00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:17.333]  For the first time anywhere on television.
[00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:20.094]  Now, I want you to hear this.
[00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:23.096]  For the first time seen on television.
[00:10:23.136 --> 00:10:24.657]  Now, this is the last time I'll stop it.
[00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:30.002]  I just, I just am so sick of the lie we've been airing it for over two years right here on the Freedom Report.
[00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:31.804]  To stop torture.
[00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:38.731]  But now Dateline has uncovered evidence that some of the violence has been committed by the peacekeepers themselves.
[00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:43.596]  Here's Lee Thompson with a disturbing report about abuse of the powerless.
[00:10:44.096 --> 00:10:55.816]  But we should warn you, it contains graphic pictures of violence.
[00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:57.310]  They're called Blue Helmets.
[00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.773]  Peacekeepers from the United Nations send it to hot spots all over the world.
[00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:06.816]  Their work is hard.
[00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:08.197]  They stop fighting.
[00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:10.578]  Deliver food and medicine.
[00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:12.700]  Protect human rights.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.001]  And it's dangerous.
[00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:19.144]  More than 500 Blue Helmets have been killed in action in the last 50 years.
[00:11:21.463 --> 00:11:25.586]  These heroic soldiers have even won the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:11:26.647 --> 00:11:28.628]  And all of us pay for this good work.
[00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:29.829]  Although the U.S.
[00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:37.254]  owes money to the U.N., American taxpayers still kick in more than $200 million a year for peacekeeping.
[00:11:38.294 --> 00:11:43.318]  But the noble goals of the United Nations are not always carried out by its peacekeepers.
[00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:49.302]  Daylor has found that some of the very same soldiers who are supposed to be protecting civilians
[00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:53.079]  have instead been accused of terrible crimes against them.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.647]  Everything from child prostitution to smuggling drugs and weapons, torture, rape, even murder.
[00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:04.793]  And what's worse, critics say, is that the United Nations is doing very little to stop them.
[00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:09.439]  As a result, crimes of war committed by soldiers of peace.
[00:12:11.604 --> 00:12:20.690]  For example, in the African nation of Somalia, peacekeepers on a U.S.-led mission were so brazen they actually took pictures of their atrocities.
[00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.752]  Selfie photos as souvenirs.
[00:12:24.513 --> 00:12:27.695]  They're seen here for the first time on American television.
[00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:36.617]  These Italian peacekeepers snapped away as they pinned a man to the ground and allegedly shocked his genitals with wires from a radio generator.
[00:12:37.078 --> 00:12:44.103]  Other Italian peacekeepers took photos as they bound a woman to an armored truck and allegedly raped her with a flare gun.
[00:12:44.483 --> 00:12:49.547]  These peacekeepers from Belgium were photographed roasting a boy over an open fire.
[00:12:50.248 --> 00:12:53.972]  A witness said he went into shock after his clothes caught on fire.
[00:12:54.532 --> 00:12:58.416]  The soldiers were acquitted of torture after the child couldn't be located.
[00:12:58.936 --> 00:13:02.920]  The peacekeepers claimed it was just a game to discourage the boy from stealing.
[00:13:03.562 --> 00:13:07.665]  These are only some of the cases we know about because peacekeepers took photos.
[00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:11.909]  Experts say many more cases of wrongdoing still haven't come to light.
[00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:19.214]  Not only were these soldiers committing these extraordinary crimes, but they're actually documenting their crimes themselves.
[00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:22.517]  John Hillen was himself a peacekeeper for the U.S.
[00:13:22.897 --> 00:13:30.283]  He's now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has written extensively on peacekeeping and believes in it.
[00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:36.709]  Killen points out bad soldiers from many armies have abused civilians and he says the number of U.N.
[00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:40.770]  peacekeepers who have committed crimes over the past 50 years is small.
[00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:45.352]  But he says in recent years incidents have increased greatly.
[00:13:45.732 --> 00:13:48.012]  It's become worse recently because U.N.
[00:13:48.372 --> 00:13:50.913]  peacekeeping happened in much greater scale and volume.
[00:13:52.474 --> 00:13:54.094]  Oh yes, oh absolutely.
[00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:54.774]  Only 500,000 plus killed in Rwanda in 96.
[00:13:58.499 --> 00:14:01.440]  Came out in court records in Canada and all over the planet.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.421]  But don't worry, they won't tell you about that here.
[00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:05.861]  Just some routine torturing and killing.
[00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:08.082]  They're about to get to the raping of children here in a second.
[00:14:08.102 --> 00:14:10.083]  But again, not a word about Rwanda.
[00:14:10.203 --> 00:14:12.083]  Only Somalia and Haiti.
[00:14:12.123 --> 00:14:12.904]  Back to the program.
[00:14:15.725 --> 00:14:21.747]  Kyle Brown was a peacekeeper, an elite Canadian paratrooper sent to Somalia on a U.S.-led mission.
[00:14:22.247 --> 00:14:25.568]  Part of his job was to help the starving people of Somalia.
[00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:32.815]  But Brown says that when desperate Somalis tried to steal their food, some peacekeepers in his unit turned violent.
[00:14:33.395 --> 00:14:36.136]  That seemed to be the only language that they understood, violence.
[00:14:36.156 --> 00:14:37.856]  I mean, these people live and die by violence.
[00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:49.281]  Brown says his commanders had issued orders to bluff off the locals, that the soldiers even set out food and water for bait to lure hungry Somalis into shooting range.
[00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:52.122]  You'll use the term turkey shoot?
[00:14:52.342 --> 00:14:52.482]  Yes.
[00:14:53.597 --> 00:14:56.239]  These Somalis were being hunted by these men.
[00:14:56.639 --> 00:15:00.782]  I remember hearing the troops yell, I got one.
[00:15:01.622 --> 00:15:10.047]  At this weapons bunker, nicknamed The Pit, the peacekeepers tied up a 16-year-old Somali boy who had been hanging around the compound.
[00:15:10.428 --> 00:15:18.373]  Brown says the corporal who was supervising him blindfolded the boy, bound his legs, and tied his hands behind his back.
[00:15:19.153 --> 00:15:20.494]  And he turns to me and says, what's this?
[00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.856]  According to Brown, the corporals kicked Du Bois and beat him with a baton with a lead pipe.
[00:15:28.038 --> 00:15:37.622]  Soldiers later testified that beating continued for hours, that more than a dozen different peacekeepers came by to watch, and some joined in, including Brown.
[00:15:38.223 --> 00:15:43.685]  In all, more than 80 soldiers heard the boys scream, and no one came to his rescue.
[00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:47.827]  But Peacekeeper Brown did pull out his camera and take pictures.
[00:15:48.407 --> 00:15:50.488]  He says it was his corporal's idea.
[00:15:51.028 --> 00:15:52.329]  Picture has a thousand words.
