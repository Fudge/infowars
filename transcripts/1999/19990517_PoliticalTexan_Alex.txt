[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.079]  [ Music ]
[00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:29.359]  So what?
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.740]  You must know all this.
[00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.562]  You don't need government missions for years.
[00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:37.706]  Now the people of one Texas town are out to expose what they call a conspiracy.
[00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.849]  There was a black helicopter spraying some white powder.
[00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.690]  It's a lie.
[00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.791]  It's like an invasion.
[00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:46.813]  What's behind this helicopter is hell.
[00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:53.619]  Now the strange sightings that have a lot of people in the Lone Star State coming up with a lot of conspiracy theories.
[00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.423]  Steve Langford reports on the helicopters and health problems that have hit Austin.
[00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.678]  It sounds just like a tornado.
[00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.121]  They were so loud that they would shoot the windows.
[00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:09.704]  That's how they know they're back.
[00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:10.865]  It was huge.
[00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:13.948]  You could see the machine gun nails going in there and everything.
[00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:14.689]  And they were black.
[00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.632]  The black helicopters.
[00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:20.534]  Nine children, all sitting down sick at the same time.
[00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.057]  The whole side of my car was just covered in dead mats.
[00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:29.445]  Austin, Texas is a peaceful, laid-back kind of place.
[00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.187]  Just like its favorite son, Willie Nelson.
[00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:34.408]  At least it used to be.
[00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:38.029]  Until the black helicopters arrived.
[00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.129]  It's bizarre.
[00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170]  It's like an invasion.
[00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:48.251]  Suddenly, people all over Austin started seeing them, with some saying they'd been harassed, and maybe even poisoned by the same.
[00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:53.213]  I can confirm black helicopters are swarming all over Texas and the rest of the U.S.
[00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:56.834]  harassing citizens, police, anybody that gets in their way.
[00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.135]  Black helicopters strike force the new world over.
[00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:10.238]  Alex Jones is a popular radio talk show host with Austin's KJFK, and he's been investigating and reporting on the mysterious black helicopter phenomenon for years.
[00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.950]  It reads like a science fiction novel, but it's really happening.
[00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:22.026]  Until recently, the government, the military, and law enforcement had denied the very existence of black helicopters.
[00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:25.648]  But now, authorities concede there really are such things.
[00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:27.849]  Yes, black helicopters are real.
[00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.730]  They're here to take care of you.
[00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.672]  They're for anti-terrorist training.
[00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:37.775]  But Jones and others suspect the black helicopters are the real terrorists.
[00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:41.657]  You're talking about the SS Cavalry right here in America?
[00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:54.454]  The sinister-looking unmarked choppers have been reported buzzing homes, following motorists, landing unannounced in schoolyards, and even dropping a mysterious white dust on Austin neighborhoods.
[00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.856]  See, it smears like paint.
[00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:03.582]  Norma Ruble says her car was covered with the dust after a black helicopter flew over her house.
[00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:06.024]  But that's to make it Sprite Painter's favorite.
[00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:12.258]  City officials examined the mysterious substance and declared it cedar ash from a nearby forest fire.
[00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.359]  There's no way it looked like cedar ash.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.641]  And she says nobody can explain what else she found on her car.
[00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.822]  Thousands of dead gnats.
[00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:22.043]  Some of them gilded.
[00:03:22.983 --> 00:03:29.226]  Meanwhile, others who have seen the black helicopters fly over their homes say the dust might have poisoned them.
[00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:32.587]  All of my kids and myself all got sick with stomach trouble.
[00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:36.189]  And the Hopkins family suspects a government cover-up.
[00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.830]  I think most people would like to be able to just say, well our government would never do that.
[00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.451]  Alex Jones insists it would.
[00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:48.833]  They've tested blood from straight out of helicopters and she has salmonella and other types of bacteria that she would find in garbage.
[00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:55.655]  Jones suspects it's all part of secret government preparations for a possible state of emergency.
[00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:59.896]  We see a lot of indicators that the military is preparing for martial law.
[00:04:01.414 --> 00:04:03.135]  And Jones is not alone.
[00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:09.140]  The government has more control than they need, and I think that the black helicopter's probably had something to do with it.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.062]  We're in the equivalent of 1936 Germany.
[00:04:12.082 --> 00:04:16.125]  But we're just now getting this powered, and they're getting ready to really clamp down.
[00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:22.489]  All right, guys.
[00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.591]  The station was struck twice by lightning.
[00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:26.652]  Hank's doing a great job keeping things going.
[00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:29.074]  John Stadtmiller, Mike Hanson, R.E.
[00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:33.467]  Of course, Scott, all the great crew and the other folks in there.
[00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:35.649]  Everybody's doing a fabulous job.
[00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.331]  We've got the fellow here tonight who's got me on in Dallas two hours a week.
[00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:45.316]  I'll tell you, I've sent my tapes to this one outfit up in Washington State and one in Michigan, and my tapes are on access stations all over the country.
[00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:48.559]  I want to thank all the great folks who tape the shows and send them out.
[00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.602]  Of course, this program originated right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:59.016]  And it's May 17, 1999, one day closer to victory.
[00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:00.577]  You can see I'm soaking wet.
[00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:04.158]  At the time you see this tape show, it was incredible.
[00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:05.498]  I had to drive from the radio station.
[00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:06.398]  I got off at 10.
[00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.259]  I didn't leave until about 8 minutes after.
[00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.560]  I had to do some stuff on my website, infowarriors.com.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.120]  I drove all the way from North Austin to down here.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.581]  I'll tell you, I want to thank God for helping me make it.
[00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:17.682]  I got fist-broke.
[00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:18.482]  You really can't see it.
[00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:21.383]  I got fist-broke out of battle the way I ran in.
[00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:22.243]  Just from the car to
[00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:24.905]  I mean, literally 15 feet.
[00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:30.107]  We've got a lot of news for you tonight about the New World Order and where it's all headed.
[00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.128]  We are live, as I said, May 17th, 1999.
[00:05:32.468 --> 00:05:36.810]  You can take in your calls at 477-2288.
[00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.471]  And a lot of news this evening.
[00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:43.013]  We'll talk a lot about the phony war in Kosovo.
[00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:47.214]  That's been put on the back burner in the public's eyes, but it's really being accelerated.
[00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:51.293]  they're now coming out of the land saying ground troops will probably be used
[00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:56.994]  to the sovereign country. They are now admitting that there is not the genocide going on quietly.
[00:05:56.994 --> 00:06:01.914]  Well, not again aside on the Serbian side; definitely on the NATO side.
[00:06:01.914 --> 00:06:07.114]  Even Mother Jones, even an extremely liberal publication, and they've been the ones cheerleading
[00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:08.114]  this whole thing.
[00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:10.794]  Not Mother Jones, but the phony liberals, as we call them.
[00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:11.942]  Again, they're all just labels.
[00:06:11.962 --> 00:06:20.264]  But Mother Jones, who I disagree with on some issues, has even come out and done a 180 and says, well, the name of the article is Reality Check Genocide.
[00:06:20.704 --> 00:06:22.445]  Whatever happened to Charters of Genocide?
[00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:25.286]  They've quietly shut up and they're not talking about genocide anymore.
[00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:26.706]  It's all manufactured.
[00:06:29.358 --> 00:06:30.679]  The Wall of Shame here.
[00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.560]  Don't tell me I left that in the automobile.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.941]  I'll tell you, it was incredible.
[00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.242]  I've got it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:36.403]  I'll serve you info.
[00:06:36.944 --> 00:06:38.965]  Serve you dash info dot com.
[00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:49.973]  And, uh, it, well, last Friday, I'm up late after Hard Copy came on, and I'm watching C-SPAN 2 on Channel 8 on Tom Warner Cable.
[00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:53.650]  And they're showing Serbian television.
[00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.773]  It shows all the dead children and all the dead Kosovo refugees.
[00:06:57.093 --> 00:07:02.497]  Every time they try to go back into Serbian proper or Kosovo proper, as far as the sovereign nation, they're bombed by NATO.
[00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:07.241]  And our pilots are at 30,000 feet because Clinton's told them to stay up there, or the Pentagon has.
[00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:12.604]  Number one, they don't get shot down by any aircraft missiles, but number two, they don't know what they're bombing.
[00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:17.606]  They're just told to target a grid, raise that target, drop that bomb, or fire that cruise missile.
[00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:18.867]  I forgot our cruise missiles are gone.
[00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:21.508]  I collected a shot of all those off and kind of got the new ones.
[00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:24.310]  It's insanity!
[00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:35.295]  And for NATO, NATO over and over again, if you read the archives of what they've done at any of the big news sites, or if you go to InfoWars.com, we've got a lot of them archived from the Washington Post, New York Times,
[00:07:36.363 --> 00:07:40.205]  London Times, London Telegraph, BBC, you name it, we've got it up there for you.
[00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:51.711]  I'm from the so-called Western Alliance, which has become totally criminal, and I'm so sad to see that, because I stand firmly against China and Russia and the rest of those barbarous murderers of their own people and others.
[00:07:52.832 --> 00:07:54.333]  This is all about globalism, though.
[00:07:55.333 --> 00:08:01.017]  And I was watching it, and it said six F-16s dropped eight pressure bombs
[00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:11.033]  Eight different kinds of cluster bombs over Kosovo are refugees that they've had to return in as the Serbian army left their own country, their own province of Kosovo.
[00:08:12.114 --> 00:08:15.436]  And it shows them coming back here, and they said six planes, they said eight bombs.
[00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:25.682]  NATO comes out, Jamie Shea, NATO's spokesperson, ah, this is ridiculous, we're sure that Serbia has been, you know, bombing them themselves using artillery.
[00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:30.585]  Well, quietly, two days later, they admit, yes, six F-16s, the US military did, not NATO,
[00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:34.038]  Yes, 6.016 zips off eight cluster bombs in an hour or so.
[00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:35.559]  It hit the wrong target.
[00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:43.143]  So you see, over and over again, in all these cases, bombing preschool buses, two hospitals, water treatment plants.
[00:08:43.163 --> 00:08:55.031]  Well, two and a half weeks ago, at the NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., where Clinton paraded around like our global leader, who has openly said he wants to be Secretary General of the U.N., he's parading around and
[00:08:57.057 --> 00:09:01.441]  They openly said, we are going to put them through a meat grinder, close quote.
[00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.484]  We are going to start targeting civilian targets with psychological warfare.
[00:09:05.604 --> 00:09:06.745]  Headlines, Washington Post.
[00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:13.170]  And then now they make us wonder why they're bombing all these civilian targets, most of it to the coat of arms.
[00:09:13.697 --> 00:09:21.097]  people in Kosovo, and that's to generate the refugees, to give you the pictures, to voice
[00:09:21.097 --> 00:09:25.857]  over the ridiculous stories for Christina Alamancour and all the rest of these people.
[00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.778]  By the way, here's the wife of Janey Shea.
[00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:32.076]  a state department uh... and and also pentagon spokesperson out there
[00:09:32.076 --> 00:09:33.417]  stealing his lines daily
[00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:37.157]  but hey, even mother jones, the village voice, the rest of these guys
[00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:40.437]  are finally getting on board, even in the statement today, on the opinion page
[00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:42.197]  they had a UT professor saying
[00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:47.356]  have you read the rambouillet accord? well i read it on the air, or read the five big points
[00:09:47.356 --> 00:09:50.356]  they don't want serbia to just give up
[00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.797]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:59.102]  Kosovo, which is part of their... that's where they held off all the Muslim invaders after the Crusades got pushed back.
[00:10:00.423 --> 00:10:04.927]  Their country, for thousands of years, that they fought for and died for, the Nazis came in.
[00:10:04.947 --> 00:10:08.589]  Until two million Serbs, they defiantly stood it as a haven for Jews and others.
[00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.252]  Like Madeleine Albright, who's now bombing them.
[00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:14.274]  It's just insanity to me, from the Nazis.
[00:10:16.603 --> 00:10:31.016]  Rabouillet wants a so-called security force, an international security force with diplomatic immunity to do whatever they want, as they did 500,000 to 800,000 killed in Rwanda alone by UN forces, or at the hands of UN forces, or shepherded into the camps to be killed by the Hutus.
[00:10:32.617 --> 00:10:33.658]  They want diplomatic immunity.
[00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:42.266]  They want a security force for the whole country and to take over Kosovo, which has $5 million a year of clean burning coal, according to the Washington Post and other publications, and gold.
[00:10:43.368 --> 00:10:50.152]  And, of course, we're hearing about how Malarkeyvick is, after he's removed, or maybe he'll be allowed to stay, this evil criminal.
[00:10:50.672 --> 00:11:00.278]  After he's removed, we are going to come in, we, the international banks, I've heard them all say it, and you've watched me in Lincolntown, you'll see it, and come in and help them rebuild.
[00:11:00.718 --> 00:11:01.779]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:11:01.819 --> 00:11:03.520]  It's about a sovereign nation.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.961]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.451]  Now, I hope equipment's all working good.
[00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.213]  Again, the reason I'm a little bit wet, and I don't know if you can see that, is because I've been coming through the rain.
[00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:15.113]  It was really raining hard.
[00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:17.554]  And it is May 17th, 1999.
[00:11:17.914 --> 00:11:18.975]  You see this tape, of course.
[00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:21.155]  And it's not May 17th, or no, it's not live.
[00:11:22.236 --> 00:11:24.877]  But if you are watching live, 477-2288.
[00:11:24.957 --> 00:11:28.659]  I know one of the cameras isn't working.
[00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:29.759]  I'm staring at the wrong camera.
[00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:30.459]  I never do that.
[00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:31.880]  Ah, that's the right one.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.842]  The lights and stuff aren't working because we've been struck by lightning, and I don't know that the phones are working good.
[00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:41.528]  So again, it's all about psychological warfare, guys.
[00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:43.510]  It's all about conditioning you.
[00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.491]  Now, here's the big news.
[00:11:46.552 --> 00:11:50.875]  This is out of the Washington Times, Washington Post, and that grudge of Fox News.
[00:11:52.696 --> 00:11:56.939]  China, in the last week, last week you might have heard the White House website was shut down.
[00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:58.320]  The Pentagon was having some problems.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.161]  They said, routine minor problems.
[00:12:00.722 --> 00:12:05.525]  Well, it's been leaked and now admitted to, and the Chinese have published it in their papers, that
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:22.843]  They launched an all-out cyber attack, hacker attack, on the federal government, on the Department of Defense, on the State Department, they launched it on the White House, they launched it... Well, it just goes on and on.
[00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:34.886]  And now, in shiny publications, they're saying, yes, our Liberation Army has developed information warfare capabilities designed to cripple high-technology weapons and support systems.
[00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:42.914]  Last week's attacks include Pentagon computer systems, which were disrupted last week by a mass attack by the Chinese.
[00:12:42.954 --> 00:12:47.339]  The official White House website was shut down after an attempt was made to break into the system operating page.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.501]  The official website of the U.S.
[00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:50.243]  Embassy in Beijing was crashed.
[00:12:50.844 --> 00:12:51.945]  We told you last week
[00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:56.089]  How they burned part of an embassy.
[00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.831]  And you didn't hear about that in the mainstream media.
[00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:06.640]  You had to get it from the South China Post, which is the free market newspaper out of what's west of Taiwan, off the coast of China, where they're doing their missile test.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:13.006]  Also today, North Korea, or yesterday actually, put a satellite into orbit.
[00:13:13.618 --> 00:13:19.564]  And they have their new intercontinental ballistic missiles given to them by China via the transfer by Clinton, and now this is all open.
[00:13:19.864 --> 00:13:22.546]  China says they're going to arm Iran, in fact, with some nuclear weapons.
[00:13:22.587 --> 00:13:23.868]  Too late, you already did.
[00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:25.830]  You see what's happening.
[00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.495]  Clinton wallowing with the Chinese government, not the Chinese people, the Chaitans, you can call them.
[00:13:31.515 --> 00:13:32.956]  It's clearly very command and control.
[00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:34.878]  They're not even confident that's a false word of the term.
[00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:38.842]  You've got all this being manifest now on a mass scale.
[00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:41.059]  For the entire population of the world.
[00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:47.885]  You have our forces being made the laughing stock and the hated demons of the world by Clinton.
[00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:51.689]  And he always said he'd avoid the military in his ROTC documents.
[00:13:52.369 --> 00:13:57.575]  He went and protested against this country with his big Karl Marx beard.
[00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:01.819]  He had all his laundry list of rapes all through Europe.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.081]  All this in police reports.
[00:14:04.668 --> 00:14:17.271]  All this happening, burning American flags, preaching down with America, visiting Russia in the late 60s, Northern Italy in the early 70s, and Communists start taking over.
[00:14:17.331 --> 00:14:21.052]  Realize the New World War comes out of Europe, and it's quite clear, it's like a teepee.
[00:14:21.132 --> 00:14:25.034]  It's got the so-called Capitalists and the so-called Communists, which are all command and control.
[00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:30.415]  Capitalism is, the way it manifests, and the definition they give you is not free market.
[00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:31.546]  Okay?
[00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:36.810]  It's criminal capital together to screw the little guy to use government regulators to attack their enemies.
[00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:42.434]  So when you vote for big government thinking you're hurting the rich guys, you're voting for a big stick they're going to bash you in the head with.
[00:14:42.874 --> 00:14:44.555]  So just be conscious of that.
[00:14:45.736 --> 00:14:56.404]  So again, China is openly attacking our computer systems, an open act of war, attacking our Pentagon, our Department of Defense computers, attacking our national security computers,
[00:14:57.606 --> 00:15:00.388]  And we've got all these articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:00.408 --> 00:15:02.829]  You can read them at your leisure.
[00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.312]  A lot of other news that is extremely important.
[00:15:07.412 --> 00:15:11.374]  This comes out of the Tampa Tribune, a mainstream newspaper.
[00:15:11.775 --> 00:15:12.775]  Got this offline.
[00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:14.817]  Soldiers speak same language.
[00:15:15.477 --> 00:15:21.481]  Soldiers from Central Asia and Europe are in Tampa this week to learn how to carry out peacekeeping missions.
[00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:23.702]  A decade ago, it would have been unthinkable.
[00:15:25.427 --> 00:15:30.691]  To have Cold War warriors jumping into combat boots and preparing to do battle.
[00:15:30.811 --> 00:15:30.891]  U.S.
[00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:36.755]  Central Command of MacDill Air Force Base ran the meeting, but most of the participants spoke Russian.
[00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:39.778]  Many of them came from nations that weren't part of the Soviet Union.
[00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:41.559]  It's a different world, indeed.
[00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:45.762]  Military representatives from twelve nations are in Tampa to participate.
[00:15:45.782 --> 00:15:46.483]  Did you hear that?
[00:15:46.503 --> 00:15:47.443]  To participate.
[00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:53.848]  Participating in a week-long seminar sponsored by the Central Command on how to
