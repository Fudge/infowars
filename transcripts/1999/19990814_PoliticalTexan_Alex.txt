[00:02:34.062 --> 00:02:37.203]  We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this important bulletin from the United Press.
[00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:40.925]  Flash, Washington... We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.
[00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:47.427]  The German News Agency... We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin... ...in some white powder... It's bizarre!
[00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.487]  It's like an invasion!
[00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:51.449]  What's behind this helicopter hell?
[00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:58.371]  Now the strange sightings that have a lot of people in the Lone Star State coming up with a lot of conspiracy theories.
[00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:03.173]  Steve Langford reports on the helicopters and health problems that have hit Austin.
[00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:06.255]  It's the sound.
[00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:08.416]  It sounds just like a tornado.
[00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:11.878]  They were so loud that they shook the windows.
[00:03:12.998 --> 00:03:14.479]  That's how they know they're back.
[00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:15.599]  It was huge.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.442]  You could see the machine gun mounts on them and everything, and they were black.
[00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:22.383]  The black helicopters.
[00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:25.305]  Nine children all came down sick at the same time.
[00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:27.866]  The whole side of my car was discovered with dead gnats.
[00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:36.930]  Austin, Texas is a peaceful, laid-back kind of place, just like its favorite son, Willie Nelson.
[00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.273]  At least it used to be.
[00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.875]  Until the black helicopters arrived.
[00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:43.936]  It's bizarre.
[00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:44.937]  It's like an invasion.
[00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:53.186]  Suddenly, people all over Austin started seeing them, with some saying they've been harassed and maybe even poisoned by the things.
[00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:57.969]  I can confirm black helicopters are swarming all over Texas and the rest of the U.S.
[00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.591]  harassing citizens, police, anybody that gets in their way.
[00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.413]  Black helicopters strike force the New World Order.
[00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:15.107]  Alex Jones is a popular radio talk show host with Austin's KJFK, and he's been investigating and reporting on the mysterious black helicopter phenomenon for years.
[00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:19.712]  It reads like a science fiction novel, but it's really happening.
[00:04:20.712 --> 00:04:26.776]  Until recently, the government, the military, and law enforcement had denied the very existence of black helicopters.
[00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:30.418]  But now, authorities concede there really are such things.
[00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.600]  Yes, black helicopters are real.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.501]  They're here to take care of you.
[00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.403]  They're for anti-terrorist training.
[00:04:38.364 --> 00:04:42.686]  But Jones and others suspect the black helicopters are the real terrorists.
[00:04:43.247 --> 00:04:46.449]  You're talking about SS Cavalry right here in America.
[00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:59.234]  The sinister-looking unmarked choppers have been reported buzzing homes, following motorists, landing unannounced in schoolyards, and even dropping a mysterious white dust on Austin neighborhoods.
[00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:01.595]  See, it smears like paint.
[00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:08.238]  Norma Ruble says her car was covered with the stuff after a black helicopter flew over her house.
[00:05:08.258 --> 00:05:10.599]  Looked like somebody took a spray painter and sprayed it.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.124]  City officials examined the mysterious substance and declared it cedar ash from a nearby forest fire.
[00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:19.065]  There's no way it looked like cedar ash.
[00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:23.388]  And she says nobody can explain what else she found on her car.
[00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:25.590]  Thousands of dead gnats.
[00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.790]  Something killed them.
[00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:33.935]  Meanwhile, others who have seen the black helicopters fly over their homes say the dust might have poisoned them.
[00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:35.156]  All of my kids and my
[00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:40.959]  And the Hopkins family suspects a government cover-up.
[00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:44.560]  I think most people would like to be able to just say, well, our government would never do that.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.221]  Alex Jones insists it would.
[00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.642]  They've tested what's been sprayed out of the helicopters.
[00:05:49.702 --> 00:05:53.523]  It has salmonella and other type bacteria that you would find in garbage.
[00:05:54.583 --> 00:06:00.425]  Jones suspects it's all part of secret government preparations for a possible state of emergency.
[00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:04.666]  We see a lot of indicators that the military is preparing for martial law.
[00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:07.876]  And Jones is not alone.
[00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:13.861]  The government has more control than they need, and I think that the black helicopters probably have something to do with it.
[00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:16.803]  We're in the equivalent of 1936 Germany.
[00:06:16.822 --> 00:06:20.702]  "Hitler's just now getting his power and they're getting ready to really clamp down."
[00:06:20.702 --> 00:06:25.962]  (Hitler's just now getting his power and they're getting ready to really clamp down.)
[00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.412]  Coming up... All right, guys.
[00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:30.493]  Coming up, it is in full wars.
[00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:32.735]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:33.703 --> 00:06:34.884]  A lot of information to get to.
[00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:36.645]  It is Monday, August 16th, 1999.
[00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:48.431]  It's a live program on the 16th, and you'll be seeing it taped on your AXS TV facilities all across this nation.
[00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:54.595]  And I would encourage viewers to tape the program and to pass it out to friends and family.
[00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:58.937]  And of course, research the information we bring forward on this program.
[00:06:59.778 --> 00:07:01.919]  Well, I have good news, bad news,
[00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.131]  And more news for you this evening.
[00:07:05.752 --> 00:07:09.654]  The mainstream media is heightening its offensive against the Second Amendment.
[00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:14.858]  Shades of Nazi Germany in the mid-1930s as Hitler accelerated his plan.
[00:07:15.258 --> 00:07:24.444]  Every case in history when genocide is planned, the firearms are taken up from the general public.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.002]  And once you've got the military and the police being the only ones that are armed, no one is safe.
[00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:33.542]  Police, military, or average citizens.
[00:07:33.602 --> 00:07:36.743]  Of course, we're now called civilians by law enforcement.
[00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:38.684]  That's changed just in the last five years.
[00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:41.364]  Ski masks being worn by our police routinely.
[00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:42.725]  Black uniforms has changed.
[00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:53.708]  The MJTF, multi-jurisdictional task forces, the melding together and centralized control of your police, is accelerating under this umbrella of some coming crisis.
[00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:56.331]  The truth is, school shootings are down.
[00:07:56.752 --> 00:08:03.100]  The incidences of drug-related shootings, just the average number of shootings, is actually way down.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.523]  But you are having more and more of these random shootings.
[00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:08.006]  Thus, they try to convince the general public
[00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:22.617]  Who has done nothing wrong, and is actually a bulwark of freedom and self-defense in this country, to give a little, and then give a little more, and then give a little more, and give a little more, until, incrementally, with successful approximation, we're all disarmed.
[00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:24.518]  It was Mao Zedong that said it.
