[00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:03.982]  Until the next legislative session.
[00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:12.051]  Brand new revelations about the firing into the Branch Davidian compound near Waco are setting off fires of a different sort.
[00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:17.137]  The recent discoveries are adding credibility to some groups that say this has been a cover-up since day one.
[00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.579]  KB24's Shelton Green joins us now with more.
[00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.864]  Shelton, after looking at the new evidence, some of these groups must be saying, we told you so.
[00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:25.324]  Absolutely, Walt.
[00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:32.269]  When the Branch of Idiom compound went up in flames six years ago, the FBI swore its agents never launched incendiary devices inside.
[00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.933]  But now their own footage, which just surfaced, is proving the agency wasn't telling the whole truth.
[00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:39.578]  10-4, copy.
[00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:40.499]  You can try it.
[00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:50.967]  The FBI says this footage and radio traffic was overlooked for six years during the Waco fire investigation, and it suggests the FBI was planning to use incendiary devices during the raid.
[00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:57.352]  We think the unit's position is relative safe to utilize this track for cover and attempt to penetrate it with military rounds.
[00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:03.409]  Roger, of course, if there's water underneath, we're just going to extinguish them, but we can try it.
[00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.070]  Byron Sage, the FBI's lead negotiator at the time, says use of incendiary tear gas was no secret in Washington.
[00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:21.252]  This tactical net, as it's referred to, would have been monitored at the command post, would have been monitored, I would believe, all the way up to and possibly the Washington, D.C.
[00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:21.532]  area.
[00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:25.593]  A former FBI profiler says this intense new interest could be dangerous.
[00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:31.246]  People that want to believe their government's against them, it's given them new fuel to believe that again.
[00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:32.347]  Waco right here.
[00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:35.968]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones says the government can't be trusted.
[00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:38.829]  Well from day one there's been massive evidence.
[00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.772]  The crime the federal government engaged in at Waco wasn't very cleanly done.
[00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:49.134]  And thank God there are a lot of good people in the government that leak this information.
[00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:52.255]  Information that's igniting the fires of Waco once again.
[00:01:53.291 --> 00:02:00.535]  Apparently, another aerial tape from that fiery day in Waco has resurfaced, and the FBI spokesperson says the agency hopes to release it tomorrow.
[00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:00.895]  Walt?
[00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:06.118]  Okay, Shelton, this new evidence will be the topic of Nightline tonight, immediately following... It's like an invasion!
[00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.020]  What's behind this helicopter hell?
[00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:15.984]  Now the strange sightings that have a lot of people in the Lone Star State coming up with a lot of conspiracy theories.
[00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:20.767]  Steve Lankford reports on the helicopters and health problems that have hit Austin.
[00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.850]  It's the sound.
[00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:26.011]  It sounds just like a tornado.
[00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.473]  They were so loud that they shook the windows.
[00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:32.054]  That's how they know they're back.
[00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:33.195]  It was huge.
[00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:36.256]  You could see the machine gun mounts on them and everything.
[00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:37.036]  And they were black.
[00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:39.998]  The black helicopters.
[00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:42.919]  Nine children all came down sick at the same time.
[00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.440]  The whole side of my car was just covered with deadnaps.
[00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:54.542]  Austin, Texas is a peaceful, laid-back kind of place, just like its favorite son, Willie Nelson.
[00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:57.946]  At least, it used to be.
[00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:00.469]  Until the black helicopters arrived.
[00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:01.550]  It's bizarre.
[00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.551]  It's like an invasion.
[00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:10.762]  Suddenly, people all over Austin started seeing them, with some saying they'd been harassed and maybe even poisoned by the things.
[00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:15.588]  I can confirm black helicopters are swarming all over Texas and the rest of the U.S.
[00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:19.192]  harassing citizens, police, anybody that gets in their way.
[00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:22.036]  Black helicopters, the strike force, the New World Order.
[00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:32.705]  Alex Jones is a popular radio talk show host with Austin's KJFK, and he's been investigating and reporting on the mysterious black helicopter phenomenon for years.
[00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:37.312]  It reads like a science fiction novel, but it's really happening.
[00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:44.361]  Until recently, the government, the military, and law enforcement had denied the very existence of black helicopters.
[00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:47.983]  But now, authorities can see there really are such things.
[00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:50.184]  Yes, black helicopters are real.
[00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:52.105]  They're here to take care of you.
[00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:55.007]  They're for anti-terrorist training.
[00:03:55.027 --> 00:04:00.290]  But Jones and others suspect the black helicopters are the real terrorists.
[00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.012]  You're talking about SS cavalry right here in America.
[00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:16.836]  The sinister-looking unmarked choppers have been reported buzzing homes, following motorists, landing unannounced in schoolyards, and even dropping a mysterious white dust on Austin neighborhoods.
[00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:19.196]  See, it smears like paint.
[00:04:20.317 --> 00:04:25.438]  Norma Rubel says her car was covered with the stuff after a black helicopter flew over her house.
[00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:28.219]  Would you like for me to take a spray painter and spray it?
[00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:34.737]  City officials examined the mysterious substance and declared it cedar ash from a nearby forest fire.
[00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:36.679]  There's no way it looked like cedar ash.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.005]  And she says nobody can explain what else she found on her car.
[00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:43.188]  Thousands of dead gnats.
[00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:44.370]  Something killed them.
[00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:51.540]  Meanwhile, others who have seen the black helicopters fly over their homes say the dust might have poisoned them.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.002]  All of my kids and myself all got sick with stomach trouble.
[00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:58.584]  And the Hopkins family suspects a government cover-up.
[00:04:59.124 --> 00:05:02.166]  I think most people would like to be able to just say, well, our government would never do that.
[00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:04.847]  Alex Jones insists it would.
[00:05:05.308 --> 00:05:07.249]  They've tested what's been sprayed out of the helicopters.
[00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:11.111]  It has salmonella and other type bacteria that you would find in garbage.
[00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:18.006]  Jones suspects it's all part of secret government preparations for a possible state of emergency.
[00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:22.368]  We see a lot of indicators that the military is preparing for martial law.
[00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:25.509]  And Jones is not alone.
[00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:31.452]  Government has more control than they need and I think that the black helicopters probably have something to do with it.
[00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:34.413]  We're in the equivalent of 1936 Germany.
[00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:42.233]  But Hitler's just now getting his power, and they're getting ready to really clamp down.
[00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:44.233]  Coming up...
[00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:47.818]  Is that a joke, Mike?
[00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:49.159]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:50.120]  We are live.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.042]  It is September 13, 1999.
[00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:55.363]  One day closer to victory.
[00:05:56.004 --> 00:05:57.445]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:03.810]  We are going until 1130 tonight, right here, broadcasting from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:09.364]  And I say that because at the time of this taping and this live broadcast, we're only going out in Austin, Texas.
[00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:16.006]  But in the near future, folks all across the country at 40-plus access television facilities will be able to see this program.
[00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:18.667]  And I suggest people watching this program tape it.
[00:06:19.307 --> 00:06:23.609]  Make copies of those tapes and pass them out to friends and family for the key information they'll be getting here.
[00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.610]  I mean, I've got too much to talk about when it comes to Waco.
[00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.112]  And Waco is not just about Mount Carmel, a religious group being smeared,
[00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:48.153]  A powerful government tagging and labeling them, attempting to engage the American people in an act of evil, and to get them to join in on the fun, like a group of Roman citizenry screaming at the gladiatorial games.
[00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:49.894]  This is sick.
[00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:52.155]  This is a lesson in propaganda.
[00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:56.438]  This is a lesson in the police state, and we'll be getting into it in the next hour.
[00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:58.893]  Well, where do I start?
[00:06:59.876 --> 00:07:02.624]  We all know what happened at Waco, at least the viewers of this program.
[00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:05.391]  The information has been being brought out here for almost six years.
[00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:09.299]  Mike Hanson and others have actually had Thrive and Brainstorm videos in studio here.
[00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:12.381]  I've interviewed them many times, dozens of times on the radio.
[00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:14.982]  Interviewed David Thibodeau tonight.
[00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:16.902]  He was inside for 51 days.
[00:07:16.962 --> 00:07:19.283]  Extremely articulate, mild-mannered gentleman.
[00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:20.884]  The lies are incredible.
[00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:22.745]  The government tells you these people are bad.
[00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:23.445]  Let's kill them.
[00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:26.926]  Sounds like Hitler labeling the Jews as bad.
[00:07:26.986 --> 00:07:27.527]  Let's kill them.
[00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:30.688]  And the people gleefully enjoying it and feeling official.
[00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:32.228]  Where do I start?
[00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:35.230]  I mean, we've got the Texas Rangers redacted report.
[00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.171]  The other stuff was top secret and couldn't be released.
[00:07:38.431 --> 00:07:41.893]  We have the Texas Rangers redacted report coming out today.
[00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:49.797]  Oh, they talk about the mine that was placed on top of the concrete vault area inside the Mount Carmel Church.
[00:07:50.997 --> 00:07:56.200]  And they actually are now posting photos where the mine blew a hole through the top of the structure.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.461]  And I guess later we'll try to get some close-ups, but not... Well, okay.
[00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:00.602]  It's kind of hard with these bright lights.
[00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:04.521]  But right there you see the hole blown in the top, and that's actually in the Ranger Report.
[00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:11.146]  There's a close-up of the hole, the rebar pointing back down inside with a shaped charge that was placed on top of it.
[00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:13.709]  So all very important news.
[00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:16.771]  We have Delta Force members that are dropping dead.
[00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:20.875]  In the space of Wednesday through Friday, three Delta Force members died.
[00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:23.317]  One, a Colonel, and of course,
