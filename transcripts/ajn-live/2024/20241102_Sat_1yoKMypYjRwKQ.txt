[00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:03.520]  We're good to go.
[00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.829]  Thank you.
[00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.530]  Thank you.
[00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.469]  Thank you.
[00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:40.930]  Thank you.
[00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.239]  Thank you.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.800]  Thank you.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.060]  The Alex Jones Network.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.039]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.879]  This is a Saturday emergency election broadcast.
[00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.500]  It is November 2nd, 2024.
[00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.039]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.319]  Coming to you from the Alex Jones Network backup studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.840]  We're obviously drilling and testing and getting ready.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.159]  And the potential of just 10 days from now, the shutdown of InfoWars in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.599]  So if you want to stay in touch during what will probably still be a contested election even then, that's where it's all pointing.
[00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.620]  We will be here at AJN Live on X and many other places.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.719]  I will leave it at that.
[00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.819]  But if the establishment thinks we're going down without a fight, they are grievously wrong, as they've already discovered.
[00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:12.539]  Myself, Trump, Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk, and others are only fighting harder than ever, and so are you.
[00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.269]  All right, here is the big news in this Saturday emergency live transmission.
[00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.569]  First off, we'll reach millions of extra people in the Infowar that's critical to everything.
[00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:26.430]  That's the key.
[00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:39.470]  If you take the live feed you're watching right now and share it on X and say Alex Jones is breaking major election news right now and share it on your email, your text message, everywhere at AJNLive.
[00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.610]  We're reposting all this as well at RealAlexJones.
[00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.649]  Exposure of what we're about to expose is what brings down the system.
[00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:56.930]  That's why they're so hell-bent on censoring us and others like you because they're losing the info war.
[00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:01.250]  Alright, the election has been in full swing for weeks.
[00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.149]  More than half the public, 55% this morning, are estimated to have already voted.
[00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:14.509]  And in battleground states, Trump is doing fabulously better than he did in 2016 or 2020.
[00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:27.310]  The system has been very, very concerned, but we are seeing confirmed election fraud of all different types happening all over the country, particularly in battleground states.
[00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.110]  We'll go over that, but that's well known.
[00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.730]  We'll hit that later and give updates on the latest developments.
[00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.569]  The big developments...
[00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:45.410]  Are the fact that, just like in 2020, Pelosi said over and over again, it doesn't matter what election night looks like, he will not be getting back in.
[00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.009]  It's a Red Mirage, Bloomberg publication.
[00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.050]  All of them said that.
[00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.370]  That was the war game.
[00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.509]  They said, we'll have whatever mail-in ballots we need, and we will get above Trump.
[00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.689]  We will beat him.
[00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.430]  And now, all over the country, Michigan, you name it, illegal aliens are allowed to vote.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.079]  Texas is open about it.
[00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.560]  They have all these extra phantom voters that aren't on the voter rolls in places like Michigan and every other major state.
[00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.879]  500,000 plus there that aren't on the voter rolls but are allowed to vote.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.379]  And there's more people, again, on the voter rolls than there are registered voters.
[00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:20.779]  So that's your big sign of fraud right there.
[00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.100]  You've got all these states like Nevada saying we're going to keep it open for days and days and days.
[00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.500]  We'll let mail-in ballots or other ballots that are dropped off without postmarks.
[00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.139]  Don't even know if they were even mailed.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.680]  We'll continue to...
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.579]  Count those.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:50.180]  Georgia has now admitted, and it's illegal, and the Republicans have filed lawsuits over that to put out all these special Democrat Party drop boxes in Democrat Party areas, and they are saying they're going to continue to count those for weeks.
[00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.319]  So, like I said a few weeks ago, first it'll be a few days, then a week, then a few weeks.
[00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.110]  That way they just keep the whole thing in turmoil.
[00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:18.310]  That's their backup plan, just throw the whole election into question and then try to stage some false flags and say Republicans or Trump supporters did it and then try to use the power of the presidency under whoever's really running things in the deep state Obama coup after they removed Biden and appointed Harris to then have their crackdown on the name of stopping a new January 6th.
[00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:28.889]  What they really want to do is just use enough fraud to overpower Trump and win decisively on election night and maybe even flip Texas via fraud with its 40-plus electoral votes.
[00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.129]  Then all the other battlegrounds won't matter.
[00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:38.509]  And they've been focusing a lot on Texas and claiming they can win when all the evidence shows they can't fair and square to convince you if they steal it, they have.
[00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:40.250]  They almost stole it in Texas.
[00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.970]  2020.
[00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:49.170]  They came very, very close, but there wasn't enough fraudulent votes in the database to allow them to do that.
[00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.230]  But here's the big news, and I'll walk through it all.
[00:07:53.149 --> 00:08:03.129]  Patrick Byrne is a very respected journalist and very successful businessman, and I've known him for many years, and he's got real sources.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:11.819]  And he says that the Democrats are telling their panicking machine, don't worry, she's going to win no matter what.
[00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:15.779]  And Pelosi said that again publicly back in 2020.
[00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.279]  Remember, over and over, you just type into a search engine, Pelosi says Trump will not be the president and will not be allowed to win.
[00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:21.500]  Don't worry, it's not going to happen.
[00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:22.560]  We'll have the votes.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.300]  Don't worry, they'll come after election night.
[00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:27.120]  And they said that would be it, the red mirage.
[00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:28.220]  It looked like he wins.
[00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.680]  They've been saying similar things.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.840]  So I don't just go off Patrick having a lot of great sources in D.C. and being accurate in the past.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.440]  We'll play the clip in a moment.
[00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.379]  It's gone viral today.
[00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.320]  We put this morning.
[00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:47.480]  It's that you can see them doing it and Raskin and all their other technicians and strategists saying, we're going to put this whole thing into turmoil.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.299]  We're going to have civil war conditions.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.259]  We are not going to accept it if he does win.
[00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:59.990]  And then you've got them getting all the illegal aliens and others registered and then denying it for years and then now admitting it in all these states.
[00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.169]  The Supreme Court, again, three days ago, did come out and say, okay, because Virginia got their suit to them.
[00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:07.909]  The others have been filed there, but they haven't heard them yet.
[00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:12.929]  And they said, yeah, they're illegal aliens confirmed on the voter rolls in Virginia.
[00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:17.029]  Virginia, and you have to take them off.
[00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:19.830]  So they overrode the federal court below them.
[00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:22.330]  But all the other federal court rulings have said, no, the illegal aliens can vote.
[00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:28.350]  And as you know, now five weeks ago, the Secretary of State in Texas said, people can vote with non-citizen IDs.
[00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.289]  And if it's illegal, just let them vote.
[00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.470]  So, and it just goes on and on in Georgia, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania.
[00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:39.549]  It's just insane.
[00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:42.210]  And judges have ruled in favor of the Republicans and Trump.
[00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:45.529]  And places like Pennsylvania this week saying, yeah, it's voter intimidation.
[00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:52.049]  The police are kicking people out at 11 o'clock and not letting them vote, but then bringing busloads of what looks like illegals into the front of the line.
[00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:58.230]  You've got to keep it open there for the early voting in the key Republican precincts that the Democrats control.
[00:09:59.669 --> 00:10:03.190]  Machines are broken, long lines, people waiting 8, 9, 10 hours.
[00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.730]  I mean, it's wild.
[00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.570]  And they show up at Democrat precincts.
[00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.730]  They just walk right in.
[00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:11.470]  It's like a red carpet.
[00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.370]  So there's all sorts of garbage going on.
[00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:26.429]  And you've got all but one county, all the keys to the computers, all the codes, the computers being leaked out by the same Secretary of State that tried to take Trump off the ballot.
[00:10:26.429 --> 00:10:27.789]  It's a total sort of operative.
[00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:39.429]  And then you've got the Dominion machines that do almost all the voting in Michigan, flipping split ballots of certain machines, confirming it's a nationwide problem.
[00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:44.149]  And then you've got the people that aren't voters but are allowed on the rolls.
[00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:46.669]  I've covered this all week long.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:48.309]  I know if you're a new viewer, you're like, that's impossible.
[00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:49.750]  Go check it in the Michigan News.
[00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:52.110]  They're like, yeah, they're just allowed to vote.
[00:10:52.289 --> 00:10:55.009]  Well, then some of those people are voting thousands of times apiece.
[00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:56.350]  You know, they're not people.
[00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:59.049]  And then they go, don't worry, we'll pull them out of the database.
[00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:12.990]  And so all these, and of course, you've got a bunch of states like Pennsylvania, where weeks ago they've caught all these fake voter registrations that are done, but the names had been put on the ballots or had been put in the database so they could vote.
[00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:29.409]  It's just total assault, and it looks to me like they're just trying to throw the whole thing into question, and then all those ballots that are in question get sent, and then an election official, and most of them are Democrats in every state, even when it's a Republican state, the Democrats care and they get in and are in control.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.720]  And then they review it and then they decide.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.940]  And the Supreme Court did a bad thing today.
[00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:41.840]  Refuses to stop counting of incorrectly completed ballots where the name's not on it or there's no postmark.
[00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:58.519]  So the Supreme Court is giving some wins to the Republicans, which are clear illegals shouldn't be voting, in some states but not in others, and refusing to say that ballots that aren't filled out will still be counted and the election official will decide that.
[00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:01.789]  So, the fix is in.
[00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.129]  You can see it everywhere.
[00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:15.009]  And if they did all the impeachments and all of the Russiagate garbage and all of the lawfare and the civil cases, the criminal cases, the fake conviction, all of it by people that ran.
[00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.809]  Like Fannie Willis and Letitia James, too, put Trump in prison, and then he didn't get fair trials.
[00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:22.129]  Even liberals admit that.
[00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.070]  I mean, even major courts, scholars, Jonathan Turley admit it.
[00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.129]  It's outrageous.
[00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:31.350]  And all of it, the mug shot, all of it backfired.
[00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.850]  So then they tried to kill him twice that we know of.
[00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:38.889]  They tried to take him out the ballot all over the place.
[00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:43.870]  When you can't do that, and the Constitution says you can't do that.
[00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:46.950]  You have to be convicted of insurrection to be pulled off a ballot.
[00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.870]  That's the only thing.
[00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.470]  He's never been convicted of that, not even charged with that.
[00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:54.710]  So, of course, they're desperate.
[00:12:54.909 --> 00:12:56.070]  Of course, they're not going to stop.
[00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:05.190]  Of course, they've committed all these crimes, and they've signed executive orders for martial law and using the military to kill citizens, whoever, again, is running the Obama administration.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.820]  Harris, Biden, White House right now where she was selected and appointed.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.440]  That's the coup.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.220]  It's already in place.
[00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.620]  It's not going to try to give up.
[00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:16.139]  They've authorized the military for civil unrest and killing citizens.
[00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:20.559]  While they say Trump's doing that, it's just wild.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.120]  They take a statement like, hey, you want to fight war so much, you go fight it.
[00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:24.899]  You face the guns.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.360]  That's a standard cliche about...
[00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:31.750]  People that are anti-war that say to hawk politicians, why don't you go fight it, old man, old woman?
[00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:33.250]  It's not threatening Liz Cheney.
[00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:41.149]  And now the Arizona Democrat AG is investigating Trump criminally for his war hawk comments as a death threat.
[00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.990]  So they're cornered.
[00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.370]  They have nothing to lose.
[00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.190]  They're going all out.
[00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.210]  So here's the big first chunk I want to cover.
[00:13:51.330 --> 00:14:03.070]  That's kind of a synopsis here on this live emergency transmission from the fledgling genesis point of the Alex Jones network, alexjones.network on the web.
[00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.429]  And that's being built up and updated and expanded.
[00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.370]  And then, of course, on X to follow us at AJNLive.
[00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.750]  Very key to do that.
[00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:21.769]  Because during this contested election, during the 76 days from the time he gets elected, if he is, until he gets inaugurated, they've said civil war conditions.
[00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.730]  James Carville said they want...
[00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:28.470]  Armed uprisings by black people because Trump's coming to kill you with no evidence.
[00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:33.809]  I mean, they're the ones throwing the violence and the gasoline on the fire.
[00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.830]  They're the ones that burn down cities and then say mostly peaceful.
[00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.590]  They're the ones that run Antifa and all the thugs.
[00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.149]  And they're the ones that do the lawfare and the censorship and the lawsuits and the control and the...
[00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.090]  We all know that.
[00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.970]  And there's a huge awakening, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:14:47.549 --> 00:14:58.070]  Globalists admit in their own leaked documents, and hell, even the Financial Times of London, one of their main mouthpieces, that there's a worldwide awakening to them, that they've got a big problem, and that almost no one believes the corporate media.
[00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:05.309]  So, continuing here, I want to play the clip from Patrick Byrne.
[00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.110]  Here's the headline.
[00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:08.830]  Bad news, Harris-Obama.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.559]  That's confirmed and true.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.580]  Republic being overthrown.
[00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:30.980]  Our one chance equals overwhelming the rigged machines.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.740]  Retweet.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:39.860]  Yeah, and I could spend an hour explaining why he's right each piece of this and how we have the background, and I trust him from his sources.
[00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:43.820]  He's never been wrong on what his sources have told him.
[00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:49.659]  But I can see everything he's saying already out there, and I see their statements already.
[00:15:49.659 --> 00:15:50.159]  They're arrogant.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.639]  And we saw it again in 2020, as I mentioned earlier, from Pelosi and others.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.539]  He will not be allowed to be president.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.220]  Nope, doesn't matter.
[00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:57.700]  He'll be gone.
[00:15:57.799 --> 00:15:59.279]  We'll have the votes we need, even if it's after election day.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:15:59.620]  Don't worry.
[00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:00.419]  He's gone 100%.
[00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:00.720]  Don't worry.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.159]  It's done.
[00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:08.259]  So, we've got to ask if they do steal it, what's going to happen?
[00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.899]  Well, they're going to stage January 6th.
[00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:31.080]  Much bigger, or going to try to, to then outlaw questioning them and say it's terrorism to question an election, which the Obama, it was his third administration with Biden, now he's got a new one with his fourth, if he steals this, put in the June report in 2021 saying questioning elections is white supremacy and white supremacy is terrorism.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.179]  And then questioning open borders, questioning...
[00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:40.860]  Lockdowns, questioning forced injections, that's all in the report.
[00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:49.120]  So they've been setting this up for a long time, years out, knowing this was coming, and then getting the military ready to come out with the American people and bring in martial law.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:56.460]  But it needs to be done under the auspices of quelling the riots and quelling violence that's happening, but isn't happening yet.
[00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:00.779]  So what are they going to stage or provocateur to get us to that point?
[00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:20.549]  So when Burns says the one chance is total landslide, even if they've got 500,000-plus people that aren't voters, they're leaving on the rolls to steal Michigan, if Trump wins by 60%,
[00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:23.349]  65%, even with fraud, you can then do the math.
[00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:30.160]  And if there's, you know, millions of voters in Michigan above what there were registered, no one will buy that.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.180]  You go, wait, they only have 500,000, now you're saying millions.
[00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:53.880]  Well, this is in NBC News, ABC News, but in Michigan, never hit the national news yet, that I've seen, maybe it has, I haven't seen it, nothing but read headlines, you know, probably eight hours a day, that Of the 500,000 that aren't voters but are allowed to vote,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.619]  most of them are just totally fake.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:05.859]  If not all, they're having cases where those people are voting over and over and over again, thousands of times apiece.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.019]  So they may be so arrogant and say like 100 million people vote for Harris in Michigan and it doesn't matter that there's only...
[00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:15.549]  You know, 8 million, 10 million.
[00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.430]  How many people live in Michigan?
[00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:19.609]  I don't know the number, but I mean, maybe they'll say a billion people voted for her.
[00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.069]  I mean, maybe they'll say 80 trillion people vote for her in the national election.
[00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.170]  They go, hey, Trump lost by 99.9% because 85 trillion people voted.
[00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.230]  I mean, for Harris.
[00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.950]  I mean, that's, you know, two men can have a baby.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.559]  You know, why not?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.599]  So, Harris is the smartest person ever.
[00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:42.420]  Biden's the smartest attack, smartest person in the world.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.240]  This is the best Biden.
[00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:46.099]  I mean, why not when you're living in a la-la land like this?
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.960]  So there's so many angles to this.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.339]  But they've said they're not going to accept Trump.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.940]  They've said they're not going to certify Trump.
[00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:55.619]  They've said that they're going to do all of this.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.160]  They said they're going to create civil war conditions.
[00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:10.180]  And now we're seeing fraud and garbage and the passcodes given out and just massive fake voting and the Democrats admitting illegals are voting and federal judges saying they can and the Supreme Court saying one state can't.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.839]  So at least, as bad as all this is, the mask is off.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.180]  The bad guys are being forced out into the open.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.849]  And So, we need to be calm.
[00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.930]  We're obviously not for violence.
[00:19:24.109 --> 00:19:26.049]  They've already cast us as violent.
[00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:27.730]  They already said we're going to be violent.
[00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.329]  While they build up and get ready for violence.
[00:19:30.849 --> 00:19:32.670]  So, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:38.210]  They could either have us all watching these battleground states and then they steal Texas and flip it.
[00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.029]  And then they win.
[00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.269]  It doesn't matter about the battlegrounds.
[00:19:41.609 --> 00:19:44.289]  They've sure been creeping around and acting like that and bragging that's going to happen.
[00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.289]  I don't know if they can do it.
[00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.349]  But that's their dark horse.
[00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.809]  That's their trick pony.
[00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:50.450]  That's their...
[00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.569]  Real upset thing.
[00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.289]  I'm not predicting.
[00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.509]  I'm saying they're certainly telegraphing a lot of activity around that.
[00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:06.549]  And they can just outright steal some of the battlegrounds, the spot of the poll showing the opposite, and say she's the winner early.
[00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:07.569]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:14.089]  No, they prepared and said, and Jamie Raskin months ago set up an event like a week and a half after.
[00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.549]  It's like November 16th, I think.
[00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.349]  You can look it up.
[00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:18.190]  We've covered it on air with Amy Wolfe.
[00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.750]  You know, America in crisis, chaos, undecided election symposium.
[00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.349]  He's one of their key strategists.
[00:20:25.569 --> 00:20:35.069]  So they're already having symposiums set in the middle of November about, oh, undecided, American chaos, and then they're already saying it's going to be chaos, it's going to be Civil War, and all the movies and all the crap.
[00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:42.690]  So 90% of the indicators pointed to that before the election started with early voting a month ago.
[00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:49.849]  And as we get closer, and already half the folks in America have voted, so it's basically already in the third quarter here.
[00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:55.680]  Of this football game, that's what everything points at.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:13.579]  And if I had to make a guess, they'll just drag out these key states, stage Republicans being violent, activate their Antifa and Islamists and burn down half the country,
[00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:18.619]  and then try to put enough pressure on the Supreme Court and everybody not to certify a Trump victory.
[00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:21.130]  And they've said that's their plan.
[00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:23.869]  So it's not like I'm like saying, oh, that's probably what's going to happen.
[00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.750]  And then if it happens, God, how did Jones know this again?
[00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:30.950]  And I understand it's scary to sit around and talk like this.
[00:21:31.589 --> 00:21:34.650]  I understand it's not fun that we're in this position.
[00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:42.529]  But if you don't point out they've been pre-programming all this, then as they roll out each new stage of it, it's like...
[00:21:46.609 --> 00:22:02.069]  If you're a high school teacher and you know they're doing rehearsals of Romeo and Juliet, and then you don't even need to read the high school bulletin, you know, well, I bet this year or this quarter or this semester or this half year,
[00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:05.089]  the play that they're doing is Romeo and Juliet.
[00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.710]  And I mean, so it's that script.
[00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:15.339]  I mean, we've been watching them dress rehearsal, And practice all this stuff and say it's going to happen.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.480]  And then now it's happening.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.500]  And other people just want to say, we'll see.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.319]  Who knows?
[00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:26.019]  And then I see 30 clips a day of the Democrats saying we're not going to accept it.
[00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:26.720]  We're going to have a civil war.
[00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:27.920]  We're going to have armed uprisings.
[00:22:28.059 --> 00:22:29.559]  Oh, but the Republicans are going to kill us.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.960]  And it just sounds like, to me, they're going to try to start a fight and start a civil war and then brand us as the terrorists.
[00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:41.650]  To me, it just seems like we should be exposing that We should be talking about that.
[00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:48.990]  We should be discussing that and trying to get ahead of that.
[00:22:50.970 --> 00:23:07.309]  So I'm going to air the Patrick Byrne comments, and then I'm going to back-to-back play Greg Reese's new vote fraud report, and then I'm going to come back and get into all the technicals and the news and the rest of it.
[00:23:07.309 --> 00:23:09.130]  But I'm going to explain to the hardcore viewers right now.
[00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:25.349]  The fact that you're hovering around Infowars.com, the fact that you're hovering around Infowars on X, the fact that you're hovering around Relox Jones or at AJN Live, you're the proud folks that are really on target and know how serious the world is.
[00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.670]  You're not focused on football or Netflix or golf right now.
[00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.049]  I'm not saying you're bad if you like that stuff.
[00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:31.589]  I like it too.
[00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:46.450]  You're focused on your future and a total totalitarian takeover that's already happened We're good to go.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.920]  But the whole thing's illegal to begin with.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.400]  So they're just trying to continue on their coup and expand it.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.900]  And because there's an awakening to it, they want to clamp down even harder once they get in.
[00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:02.619]  And she said again yesterday, price controls, seizing people's businesses.
[00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:10.059]  I mean, they're going to go, if you think you've seen totalitarianism out of the left so far in America, they're all globalist programmed and controlled.
[00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:14.240]  We can look at other countries, Australia and Europe and other places and see where they are a few years ahead.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.579]  It gets 1984 on steroids.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.920]  You know, it's illegal to alter an official White House transcript of a president's address.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.880]  Federal law, I'll show it to you in a minute.
[00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:29.019]  White House altered a transcript of Biden's garbage remark.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.000]  AP, they admit, even AP admits, they altered it.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.359]  The head guy said, it's not my fault.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.180]  I was ordered to do it because he could get charged with a felony.
[00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:37.500]  And then AP goes, yeah, they just altered it.
[00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:37.819]  Big deal.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.019]  Justice Department will do nothing.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.859]  Now, you can say, well, let them censor.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.579]  We've exposed them.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.380]  It's their right to do it.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.220]  Yeah, we know they did it.
[00:24:44.779 --> 00:24:49.460]  But the point is, they pass a law like that, and then when they violate it, it's okay.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.700]  But that's 1984, when they're going in and saying, oh, we didn't really call you garbage.
[00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:59.200]  And then when they say, Trump said, put her in a firing squad and kill Cheney.
[00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:06.740]  No, he said, if she loves war so much, wants to feed a bunch of our men in to get killed with all these guns pointed at them, let her go face them.
[00:25:06.779 --> 00:25:08.339]  That is the most clichéd statement ever.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.160]  But they take it out of context, because they're deceivers.
[00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:12.819]  And you know that.
[00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:16.960]  So this is an over-the-top, most exciting and dangerous time of my life.
[00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.099]  These people are starting World War III. They're completely out of their minds.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.220]  Mainline analysts, top diplomats.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.500]  You know, said this is leading to World War III. Even Kester, before he died, said it should stop.
[00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:29.119]  It leads to World War III. They're like, yeah, we'll just go ahead and do it.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.160]  Russia came out today and said, we're getting closer to direct conflict with the West every day.
[00:25:33.259 --> 00:25:33.900]  This needs to stop.
[00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:39.799]  And you look at the collection of morons, you know, that the globalists use as front people.
[00:25:40.569 --> 00:25:43.490]  You actually study the globalists themselves, this thing's on autopilot.
[00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:44.809]  This is a runaway train.
[00:25:46.349 --> 00:25:50.109]  So, yeah, I believe what Patrick Byrne's saying, because that's their past behavior.
[00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.150]  They've made the statements already.
[00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.009]  That's how they're acting.
[00:25:52.589 --> 00:26:05.829]  And even if they're not totally confident that they can't defeat Trump with fraud, they have to act confident at the last minute, like Hillary did, so that their people stay confident in their criminal operation.
[00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.190]  They don't sit there and tell people, hey, we could lose this.
[00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.549]  We could be, you know, taken over here.
[00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.410]  No, they're like, no, no, we're invincible.
[00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.109]  You know, earlier, oh, my God, he's a criminal.
[00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:17.650]  He's a murderer.
[00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.269]  He's Nazi.
[00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:19.950]  He's going to put us all in camps.
[00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:22.630]  But then down to the wire, actually, he's terrible.
[00:26:22.769 --> 00:26:23.430]  Everybody hates him.
[00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.250]  You know, we're going to win.
[00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.869]  So that's what they do.
[00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:30.809]  They lie to their members.
[00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.910]  They lie to their crew.
[00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:33.049]  They lie to their constituents.
[00:26:33.309 --> 00:26:34.509]  So here's the clips back to back.
[00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.650]  Folks, I've got some bad news for you and I'm gonna give it to you straight.
[00:26:40.089 --> 00:26:46.430]  I have sources inside the Kamala Harris operation and I can tell you this.
[00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:51.490]  As of this morning, Kamala Harris and her people are 100% confident.
[00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.109]  They're not in the least bit worried.
[00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:58.410]  They are 100% confident and they're saying, do not worry about it.
[00:26:58.569 --> 00:27:00.569]  Don't worry about the polls.
[00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:01.730]  Don't listen to the polls.
[00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.029]  We have this in the bag.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.200]  And the Kamala Harris transition team has already been staffed, and it's all Barack Obama's staff.
[00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:12.500]  It's Barack Obama.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.599]  It's his entire staff.
[00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:17.720]  I mean, the entire transition team is Barack Obama people.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.180]  And they are not in the least bit worried.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.480]  They are 100% confident.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.640]  And that's the word that's reached me from somebody extremely well placed.
[00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:29.460]  Extremely well placed that they know and trust.
[00:27:30.969 --> 00:27:33.890]  And I've been told it's actually shocking how confident they are.
[00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.630]  It's almost with a little smirk that they're saying, do not believe anything you're hearing.
[00:27:38.329 --> 00:27:39.910]  We got no problem at all.
[00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:41.250]  Wait till you see what happens.
[00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:51.000]  And it's because they are 100% confident in the ability of the machines to They can make these machines stand up and whistle, Dixie, as I've told you before.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.619]  The only way to defeat this is with a massive turnout.
[00:27:54.619 --> 00:28:01.220]  I swear to God, I'm not doing this to manipulate you or get you worried unnecessarily.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.839]  I'm telling you they are not in the least bit concerned.
[00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:14.269]  They're cool as cucumbers and they believe they have this in the bag and do not believe and there's no worries at all about what the polls say, what this say, what that.
[00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.470]  This election is done in their minds.
[00:28:16.569 --> 00:28:18.109]  They're picking out drapes for the White House.
[00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:19.630]  They're not the least bit concerned.
[00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.109]  You know what to do.
[00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.630]  Share this video.
[00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:28.140]  And share this video and get out there.
[00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.940]  Look, I've lived in communist countries.
[00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:32.759]  You guys have no idea what's coming for you.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:40.480]  You are going to regret to your dying day, which may be sooner than you think, if you do not get out now and give this not just the old college try.
[00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:42.819]  It's time to go teeth, toes, and fingernails.
[00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:44.759]  They are 100%...
[00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:47.039]  Kamala Harris' team is not in the least bit worried.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.559]  They are 100% confident that they're winning this.
[00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:53.420]  And the transition team is all Barack Obama.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:18.019]  After Osho, a foreigner to this country, used his cult to bus in thousands of homeless people to vote in his favor during a local election, the Federal Election Commission ruled that it did not violate federal election laws.
[00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:25.720]  Voter fraud is as old as voting itself, and voting machines have been designed to make fraud easier.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:40.920]  After witnessing election irregularities associated with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we decided to direct time and resources to Cartel del Sol links to U.S. and global election fraud.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.460]  It is indisputable.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:30:00.779]  Smartmatic Election Systems was created at the direction of now-deceased Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, and its source code, the basis of its operating system, developed jointly by Venezuela's Consejo National Electoral and Smartmatic,
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:07.539]  was designed to allow election results to be altered without the knowledge of voters and the public.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:20.039]  Colorado Secretary of State Jenna Griswold posted a spreadsheet that listed the password of the state's voting systems and after she was caught, she said it's not a security threat.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.680]  To be very clear, we do not see this as a full security threat to the state.
[00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.019]  This is not a security threat.
[00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:32.890]  This is not the first time that your office has made mistakes that have damaged voters' confidence in our elections.
[00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:40.029]  In 2022, your office sent out mailers to 30,000 noncitizens, inviting them to register to vote.
[00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.369]  They, of course, are not eligible.
[00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.150]  To register to vote.
[00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:55.769]  That same year, your office used Colorado's ballot tracking system to send messages to specific Coloradans encouraging them to vote when in fact they had already voted, causing confusion that had to be cleaned up by the county clerks.
[00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.549]  And now this leak of the voting system passwords.
[00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:06.549]  Given your office's repeated errors that have damaged confidence in our elections, which you say is paramount, will you resign?
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.940]  Absolutely not, Kyle.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.299]  And now we are seeing videos of voting machine glitches.
[00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:32.190]  At this year's DEFCON conference in August, hackers found security gaps in voting equipment, but it hasn't been fixed.
[00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.730]  But voting machine fraud is old news.
[00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.269]  The new election fraud tool is non-citizen voters.
[00:31:40.829 --> 00:31:47.430]  Catholic charities have not only been managing the illegal border crossings, they have been registering them to vote.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.700]  Groups of non-citizens have been seen early voting with the help of NGO handlers.
[00:31:54.119 --> 00:32:00.779]  The Texas elections chief told poll workers to give ballots to people who show non-citizen IDs.
[00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:17.059]  And while the Supreme Court decided to allow Virginia to remove non-citizens from voter rolls, the poll workers are being instructed to submit a special form for them to vote, which will tie results up for another week after Election Day.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:25.099]  I signed up to work this November 5th election poll here in the county that I live in, in Iowa.
[00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:31.539]  I wanted to see firsthand for myself if illegal immigrants are actually being allowed to vote.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.960]  This is what we've been instructed.
[00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:41.940]  Even if they say that they're a U.S. citizen and I still question it, any of us question it, they still are allowed to vote.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.470]  They will be given This.
[00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.890]  This is a provisional ballot.
[00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.690]  Basically, what that means is you still get to vote.
[00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.009]  The voting stops at 8 o'clock.
[00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:06.670]  At 8 o'clock, however many of these provisional ballots that we have, those are accumulated and then they are all shoved in an envelope together, sealed, and then they go somewhere else.
[00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:17.569]  They have, from November 5th through November 12th, To bring information to verify that they're actually a U.S. citizen.
[00:33:19.069 --> 00:33:20.369]  Let me repeat that.
[00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.289]  They have until 12 p.m.
[00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:30.549]  on November 12th to present the proper identification to prove that they're a U.S. citizen.
[00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:33.670]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:33:35.089 --> 00:33:37.009]  All right, again, folks, you're watching us.
[00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.390]  It's 530 Central while we're live on air.
[00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:46.589]  This will refeed, obviously, until I'm live tomorrow out of the InfoWars Battle Studios at 4 p.m.
[00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.890]  Central to 8 p.m.
[00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.529]  InfoWars can be shut down on the 13th.
[00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.589]  It's up for sale, ordered by a bankruptcy court.
[00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.349]  And all the Democrat Party lawfare that's going on.
[00:33:56.529 --> 00:33:58.769]  And that's why we have the AJN Network here.
[00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:00.990]  We've got a podcasting studio being set up.
[00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:02.190]  We've got backups.
[00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:03.710]  A lot of other things.
[00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:09.090]  And that's why your support is critical with our sponsors that are outside of the Infowars system.
[00:34:09.289 --> 00:34:16.110]  And that, of course, is thealexjonesstore.com, thealexjonesstore.com, and drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:23.929]  You can find all the links of those at the top of my X page at realalexjones and at ajn.com.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.360]  Live on X. Those are coordinates.
[00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:36.139]  During this will probably be, the Democrats have said they'll make it one, so they're successful, which it looks like they will be at least in disputing it and creating, quote, civil war conditions.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.940]  I mean, that's just amazing that that's going on.
[00:34:40.019 --> 00:34:42.619]  You also have the URL, alexjones.network, with a lot of links on it.
[00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:46.699]  It'll be a news site as well with videos every few hours, just like InfoWars.
[00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:51.949]  Regardless of what happens, we're going to be expanding, whether M4 continues on or whether it's shut down.
[00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.530]  I'm not just going to continue on.
[00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.489]  We're going to expand to face the enemy because the Great Awakening is here.
[00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:07.030]  So you saw the Patrick Byrne And I've got Patrick Byrne on the Sunday show tomorrow at 4 p.m.
[00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.389]  Central.
[00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:14.409]  I've got Naomi Wolf coming back on as well and things tomorrow, so be sure and watch that space.
[00:35:14.969 --> 00:35:27.360]  Okay, so we have all these Democrat states aren't doing voter ID. That's the law you can't ask for in California.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:35.619]  You have the battleground states saying we let illegal aliens vote, other than Virginia, to the Supreme Court.
[00:35:36.019 --> 00:35:38.360]  And then you've got headlines like this one.
[00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:41.960]  Why are Mexico's voter ID laws stricter than ours?
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.659]  Well, that's because Mexico doesn't want people that aren't Mexican voting.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.940]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:55.619]  Migrants voting would allow Democrats to win 12 more seats in the House right now.
[00:35:55.699 --> 00:36:00.119]  It also, immediately, when they apportion new congressional seats off the census...
[00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.230]  Give them more blue seats as well.
[00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:05.110]  So that's the admitted game plan.
[00:36:05.269 --> 00:36:20.489]  We've had Democrat Congress people admit they're going to use the illegals to take over and basically create a one-party state in America where the Democrats are always in charge, Republicans are this little vestigial party, but through Trump and the Tea Party before that and through what we're doing, what you're doing.
[00:36:21.289 --> 00:36:23.030]  We're trying to take over the Republican Party.
[00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.150]  We're very close to that.
[00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:26.349]  And then we can reform the Democratic Party.
[00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:27.949]  But I don't see how you ever even do that.
[00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.289]  You wouldn't outlaw the party.
[00:36:29.449 --> 00:36:35.349]  It'll just be so corrupt and horrible it falls apart and some new party rises up in that place.
[00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:36.269]  And they know that.
[00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:38.769]  There was a big New Yorker magazine article on Friday.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.860]  With all these TV executives and others saying we're basically dead.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.079]  The mainstream media is dead.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.760]  And they'll say I'm threatening to kill them there.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.639]  It's a term.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.900]  They're saying they're dead, meaning people don't like them.
[00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:50.280]  Almost no one reads them.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.159]  No one believes them.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.380]  And so this is really the end of their system, whether they steal this election or not.
[00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.280]  And look, I want to fix things.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.159]  And I hope Trump gets in and can turn things around.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.920]  And I'm not trying to get you ready for a Trump defeat.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.699]  I just want people to know that he'll be handed a disaster when he gets in, and that's not going to be a bed of roses either.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:14.980]  But it'll be far worse if Kamala gets in with the war and the borders, and it'll be very hard to ever fix this country.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.340]  And that's what they know, because they'll bring in...
[00:37:17.909 --> 00:37:21.869]  If you think, you know, 25 million illegals the last four years is bad, I mean, they'll bring in 100 million.
[00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.409]  I mean, it's in the UN replacement migration plan.
[00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.070]  Go to the UN website, type in replacement migration.
[00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:31.949]  2000, 2001, the official plan they're carrying out in Europe and here.
[00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.730]  So they'll just bring in a giant mass of people.
[00:37:33.889 --> 00:37:40.010]  They said they want 650 million people by 2045 in North America, the U.S. and Canada.
[00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.489]  And they're on pace to get to that number.
[00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.570]  So, yeah, I mean, that's...
[00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:56.210]  Almost triple the population of Canada and the United States right now by 2045.
[00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:02.150]  So let that sink in for you.
[00:38:03.329 --> 00:38:08.789]  And this is how the globalists are conquering formerly free Western nations is with third world countries.
[00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:21.860]  They control the IMF World Bank, collapsing them with debt controls, COVID lockdowns, and then bringing them in here as refugees of their own policies, I think?
[00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:37.750]  So, that's what we're facing.
[00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:41.929]  And I mentioned a lot of this earlier, but now let me go over some of the documents for you.
[00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.550]  This came out yesterday.
[00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:59.250]  Georgia Republican Party, Fulton County, that's Atlanta, plans to illegally accept ballots and say they're going to take them for weeks after the election that violates the law and that they put out all these drop boxes in Democrat areas that aren't even legal.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:10.809]  Barger Taylor Greene says it's completely unacceptable that Fulton County has chosen to openly defy Georgia state law by opening four election offices exclusively Democrat Majority areas.
[00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:19.510]  Not only did Fulton County make this unlawful decision, but they did so without public notice and initially barred Republican poll watchers from observing the process.
[00:39:19.769 --> 00:39:27.710]  Republican poll watchers have since been granted access, but only this happened after mounting public pressure and a pending lawsuit.
[00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:31.969]  Georgia state officials must act immediately to shut down these illegal drop-off sites.
[00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:36.329]  Why is the Democrat Party Never playing by the rules.
[00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:41.789]  Update, Georgia working with SOS and AG. We have been able to confirm that observers will be allowed.
[00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:43.289]  That's Laura Trump.
[00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:52.369]  And of course, court orders Arizona to release lists of over 200,000 registered voters who did not provide proof of citizenship, and the word is they're illegal aliens.
[00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:54.349]  And people out of state they're Democrats.
[00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:58.090]  So this is a big deal.
[00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.489]  And we'll continue to track that.
[00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.989]  Another report.
[00:40:02.809 --> 00:40:05.710]  Amish possible key demographic in Trump winning Pennsylvania.
[00:40:05.849 --> 00:40:09.570]  They're reportedly going to vote almost 100% for Trump.
[00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:17.849]  But at the end of the day, it's still all up in the air.
[00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:23.849]  What an exciting, insane time to be alive.
[00:40:23.849 --> 00:40:25.650]  And then you've got a lot of wild cards.
[00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:28.789]  Not just Biden calling all Trump supporters garbage.
[00:40:33.739 --> 00:40:37.260]  But now we've got the squirrel.
[00:40:38.059 --> 00:40:53.780]  And this story is so important because it's a window into everything wrong by design, not just here, but by the leftist, green cult,
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.099]  transhumanist, Great Reset, New World Order system.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.159]  So we'll get to social media star, Peanut the Squirrel, euthanized after a siege from New York home.
[00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:04.320]  Trump responds.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:14.059]  We'll get into Peanut and the poor family that had a SWAT team raid them and kill the squirrel that was very famous.
[00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:15.079]  That's why they did it.
[00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:19.639]  And I'm going to explain why they would do something so evil in New York, knowing it would backfire.
[00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:22.639]  There's a methodology to this.
[00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:26.539]  And People say, oh, the left's stupid.
[00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:26.900]  Why would you?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.880]  No, no, they have a reason.
[00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:28.820]  I'll get to that coming up.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.300]  But first, Elon Musk tweeted last night.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.579]  It's got 50 million views.
[00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:35.219]  When I checked this morning, it's probably 100 million now.
[00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:39.840]  But this is a very powerful documentary that I reposted at Real Alex Jones.
[00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:44.920]  And I think that we should download it ourselves and re-upload it because we'll get even more viewers that way.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.739]  All of you should as well.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.619]  You should watch it.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.599]  The Man You Don't Know.
[00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:57.239]  And the documentary, even though I didn't really have time to watch it, I watched almost all of it very early this morning when I got up.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.860]  I kind of listened to it while I was researching, but I did watch part of it at least.
[00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:03.780]  Maybe I was watching it 10% of the time, but listening to it the rest.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.920]  Really amazing film.
[00:42:06.019 --> 00:42:14.179]  I think I'm going to go home tonight, and after my 7-year-old goes to bed, I think I'm going to watch it on the big screen.
[00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.690]  In the bedroom and actually absorb it because it was really powerful.
[00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:22.150]  And just when you think you know it all, you realize how much you don't know.
[00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.590]  And then you also realize what you've forgotten.
[00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:28.769]  So everybody should see the documentary.
[00:42:28.989 --> 00:42:29.750]  And Elon tweeted it.
[00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:30.489]  It's easy to find.
[00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.170]  And I've reposted it up on Real Alex Jones.
[00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:38.590]  But everybody should see this.
[00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:42.769]  This is just a few minutes from the long film.
[00:42:44.010 --> 00:43:00.510]  It's over two hours long, dealing with Trump and the mugshot and why the system didn't know that locking up Robin Hood wouldn't be a popular thing and that Trump is a folk hero now.
[00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:02.090]  Here's a clip from the film.
[00:43:06.219 --> 00:43:10.920]  The indictment brings felony charges against Donald John Trump.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:18.260]  He called me in this moment, as he's on the way to have this mugshot taken, he's like, I don't know, honey, what do you think?
[00:43:18.519 --> 00:43:19.679]  What do you think about all this?
[00:43:19.719 --> 00:43:21.519]  And I was like, I think you're a badass.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:27.500]  I think the fact that you're going in right now, you're showing up, and he's like, let me tell you, there's a lot of support out here.
[00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:29.699]  There are people lining the streets excited to see me.
[00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:34.769]  You know, I don't know really how to feel about it, but we're gonna go do it, and it's gonna be okay.
[00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:42.690]  I was like, gosh, what a great attitude to have when you're on the way to have a mugshot taken, which, by the way, greatest mugshot in history.
[00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.610]  Rivals even Elvis Presley's.
[00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.010]  When I saw you got a mugshot, it was crazy.
[00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.650]  I went online and bought one right away.
[00:43:50.809 --> 00:44:00.789]  The idea of the mugshot was obviously to try to demoralize him, to try to just be, you know, as debasing, to perp walk him in and parade him in for these nonsense charges.
[00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.849]  It was sort of interesting how that all really backfired.
[00:44:06.929 --> 00:44:09.190]  How could you ever top that photograph?
[00:44:09.369 --> 00:44:11.369]  You know, defiant, strong...
[00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:11.789]  Trump.
[00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:13.219]  He crushed it.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.920]  He smashed the mugshot, okay?
[00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:16.119]  He looked amazing.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.260]  He's, like, mean mugging it.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.019]  Looks gorgeous.
[00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:18.920]  Hair is perfect.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:24.679]  And he turns it into one of the most iconic photographs that this country has seen.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.940]  Do you respect Trump?
[00:44:26.119 --> 00:44:29.460]  I think that his gangster is ridiculous.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.079]  There is no one more gangster than Trump.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:40.980]  I like to think that I have thick skin, but what that guy goes through on a daily basis, It went everywhere.
[00:44:41.019 --> 00:44:54.280]  And a moment that was supposed to be just sort of soul-crushing ended up being an exhilarating, powerful moment that helped move his whole political movement forward.
[00:45:00.079 --> 00:45:01.380]  Did you like my mugshot?
[00:45:01.539 --> 00:45:02.579]  Did you like the mugshot?
[00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:03.159]  Lovely.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:10.760]  The biggest-selling mugshot ever.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:19.039]  My father's mugshot stands for a system that will do anything to take out a political adversary.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.599]  That mugshot's beloved by millions and millions of people.
[00:45:28.769 --> 00:45:30.630]  Alright, so you definitely want to see that documentary.
[00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:38.090]  In fact, Chase, retweet it and say, absolute must-watch documentary, Discover the Real Donald Trump.
[00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:39.909]  I'm going to put that back out on X again.
[00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.110]  People can find it really easy at Real Alex Jones.
[00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.809]  Let's also retweet it at AJNLive.
[00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.150]  Okay.
[00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:57.710]  When I watched this this morning and read about this news story, I would like to make a documentary about Peanut.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.480]  Because there are certain stories that I call a keyhole into the larger world.
[00:46:05.039 --> 00:46:21.739]  Or, as you know, for hundreds of years, nobody could read Egyptian hieroglyphs until finally they found the Rosetta Stone buried that was a decoder or basically like an encyclopedia or an alphabet is what it was.
[00:46:22.139 --> 00:46:23.119]  So you could read it.
[00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:26.900]  So you see a story like I'm about to break down.
[00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:37.130]  Where there's a popular YouTube Instagram channel with hundreds of millions of views and a super popular trained squirrel.
[00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:46.969]  My dad's brother found two baby crows and had several baby squirrels he found that had fallen out of trees that he raised.
[00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:53.050]  And both crows got killed because crows are in groups and they count.
[00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.630]  They're one of the smartest birds because owls kill them.
[00:46:56.519 --> 00:46:59.980]  So that's why crows are like, they stay in groups and are always watching.
[00:47:00.679 --> 00:47:06.199]  Because even though owls, like great horned owls, don't even eat crows, they just kill them.
[00:47:06.679 --> 00:47:12.400]  And my uncle, when he was like 10 and then later when he was like 16, he had two different crows, they were both called Mr.
[00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:14.360]  Crow, that he would feed as babies.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.960]  He would say to his mother they fell out of trees.
[00:47:18.039 --> 00:47:19.579]  He wouldn't get up the trees and got them.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.860]  He was like Jungle Boy.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.239]  And...
[00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:25.519]  So we had two crows.
[00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:27.119]  In fact, my dad's older than my uncle.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.320]  Side story, it's just really interesting.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:37.280]  And so when my mom was dating my dad in college, she would go to their ranch, their farm, and she thought his brother was really cool with like pet squirrels and pet crows.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.260]  And the reason I bring that up is, and Mr.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:45.860]  Crow would get on her shoulder and he'd come and whisper to her and he'd come and peck at her ring and he was asking her for it.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.960]  And you could like give him a Spearmint wrapper and fold it up.
[00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:54.400]  He'd be real happy and run and hide it outside and come back and beg for more shiny things.
[00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:55.940]  I mean, blackbirds are really cool.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.460]  Ravens are in the same family, even smarter.
[00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:04.260]  But the point is, is that this is something done through Culture Forever.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.679]  People have pet squirrels.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.460]  People have pet crows.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.699]  And people have pet raccoons.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:25.059]  And I can see, like, if somebody's got a bunch of pet chimpanzees and you hear that people aren't taking care of them and sometimes they tear your face off, maybe you send animal control, you give them a fine, you say, hey, we got a sanctuary for the chimpanzee.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.559]  But here's the issue.
[00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:28.860]  There's a thousand angles.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.320]  Because when I say it's like a Rosetta Stone, you could talk about it forever.
[00:48:34.519 --> 00:48:38.860]  You've got New York with millions of illegal aliens totally collapsing.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:48.170]  They're spending $45 Billion dollars a year just on the East Coast, legal aliens.
[00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:51.409]  4.5 billion a year just in New York City alone.
[00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:56.449]  15 billion of that 40 plus billion on the East Coast is New York State alone.
[00:48:56.889 --> 00:49:04.150]  Total nationwide, we spend over 145 billion a year And people are like, come on, Jones, you don't have a teleprompter.
[00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.989]  How do you know that stuff?
[00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:05.550]  Just look it up.
[00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.170]  I see it all the time.
[00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:07.510]  Just type in a search engine.
[00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:09.989]  U.S. spends over $140 billion a year on illegals.
[00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:11.389]  And there's maps of it.
[00:49:11.469 --> 00:49:12.769]  The East Coast is over $40-something billion.
[00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:17.730]  New York and New York State together are the biggest chunk.
[00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:19.610]  But I'm digressing.
[00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:22.010]  There are just illegal aliens everywhere.
[00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.710]  You know all about it.
[00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:23.550]  They give them driver's licenses.
[00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:24.349]  They get caught voting.
[00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:25.949]  Democrats say they should be allowed to vote.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.440]  Nobody gets prosecuted.
[00:49:28.579 --> 00:49:29.579]  There's crime everywhere.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.340]  You've got all these Soros DAs, not just in New York, but in Buffalo and other cities.
[00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:37.519]  People rape and kill, and they're out and just sometimes on bail in a few days.
[00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:38.780]  Sometimes they don't even get jail time.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.059]  If you do defend yourself, you go to prison.
[00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:42.920]  You know all those famous cases.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.380]  And it's crazy.
[00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:49.599]  But they've got money...
[00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:58.869]  To watch a popular YouTube channel for years with a pet squirrel that does tricks.
[00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:03.150]  And people with pet squirrels is a pretty common thing.
[00:50:03.289 --> 00:50:06.210]  I mean, everybody I know knows somebody's had a pet squirrel.
[00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:09.789]  I know, like, off the top of my head, like four or five people I know...
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.559]  In my life that have had pet squirrels.
[00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:14.599]  But the point is, it's not a vicious animal.
[00:50:14.599 --> 00:50:15.619]  It's not bad.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.139]  It's not like they're keeping a poisonous king cobra.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.760]  You've got some argument.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.079]  You get out and bite the neighbors.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.659]  No, they're control freaks.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.119]  And they've got all this money for illegal aliens.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.300]  And all the illegal aliens are bringing in drug-resistant TB and all these diseases.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:29.900]  That's fine.
[00:50:30.059 --> 00:50:32.639]  And committing all these murders and hit-and-runs and drunk driving.
[00:50:32.659 --> 00:50:33.659]  And we've got to pay for it all.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.860]  And they're getting all this welfare.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:35.760]  That's all fine.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:49.980]  And We got hundreds of thousands down a year from fentanyl, and we're starting World War III, and there's homeless veterans all over the streets and trash everywhere, and you call the cops in most areas, they won't even respond, and the Democrats want to defund the police.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:57.900]  And have in many areas, but in the most liberal areas of the country, like San Francisco, a decade ago, they banned fireplaces.
[00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.400]  Even if you have one, they'll come give you a fine.
[00:50:59.619 --> 00:51:12.679]  I saw reports last week, it's all over the country, code enforcers under Agenda 21, the UN creates the code, whether in Australia, Germany, England, Canada, the US, in liberal areas, they come and say, hey, what are you doing with a barbecue pit in your backyard?
[00:51:12.679 --> 00:51:14.420]  You're not allowed to have smoke going up.
[00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:23.559]  And then you hear New York wants to ban by 2028 charcoal-fired pizza ovens.
[00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:25.480]  And you go, why would they want to ban a pizza?
[00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:28.440]  Because they want the power to ban making fire.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:35.480]  They want you in an electric car, not knowing how to grow food, not knowing how to fight, not knowing how to skin a buck.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.739]  They admit they want you domesticated.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.659]  Remember, years ago, they had a plan to ban range stoves.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.380]  They have under the EU in a bunch of countries.
[00:51:42.969 --> 00:51:43.650]  Gas stoves.
[00:51:43.769 --> 00:51:44.829]  Oh, they're not going to do that?
[00:51:44.929 --> 00:51:45.469]  Then they try.
[00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.150]  And then New York's still trying.
[00:51:47.389 --> 00:51:50.449]  So they have a methodology.
[00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:56.650]  And they banned, over a decade ago in Europe, gas-fired space heaters.
[00:51:56.929 --> 00:51:59.369]  I told you it's coming here, and now a bunch of cities have done that.
[00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:05.869]  California banned all new gasoline lawnmowers and tractors last year.
[00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:12.750]  EU's banned any new gas vehicles after being made after 2033.
[00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.289]  I mean, this is really going on because they want full power.
[00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.630]  Now, Trump says they're going to ban the beef.
[00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:21.530]  And they go, he's crazy.
[00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:24.349]  You type in, we need to ban beef to save the earth.
[00:52:24.449 --> 00:52:30.670]  New York Times, London Guardian, they're already going to get rid of 80% of the cows in the next six, seven years in the Netherlands, in Ireland, in Sri Lanka.
[00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.989]  I mean, they already got rid of 10% of them this year.
[00:52:35.539 --> 00:52:40.340]  In the per capita, the highest yield farming area in the world is the Netherlands.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.400]  They're freaking green thumbs.
[00:52:43.539 --> 00:52:46.239]  They're like the third biggest food producer in the world, the Netherlands?
[00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:51.800]  And they're going to shut down half their farms and get rid of most of their cows because they're bad for the earth?
[00:52:53.219 --> 00:52:57.159]  So, yeah, Austin and Houston eliminate meat and dairy consumption by 2030.
[00:52:58.639 --> 00:52:59.940]  That's mainstream news.
[00:53:00.159 --> 00:53:03.260]  I mean, see, and then Trump says it, and he goes, that's freaking crazy.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.519]  He's like, you want to ban fracking?
[00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:06.739]  That's nuts, Kamala said in the debate.
[00:53:07.019 --> 00:53:08.440]  You want all the semi-autos.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.199]  I never said that.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.539]  Why, I got a Glock, and why, Tim Walls loves to hunt.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.500]  Trying to put shotgun shells in a 12-gauge in the back of the butt of the gun.
[00:53:18.119 --> 00:53:18.860]  Freaking nuts.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:26.079]  So, that's all they've got, and they do it over and over again.
[00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:27.800]  Yeah, Austin's part of C40 City's.
[00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.769]  Climate Action Plan, Global Green New Deal.
[00:53:32.849 --> 00:53:41.050]  Central banks will not give you loans or money if you don't sign on to the ESG, Global Corporate Social Credit Score.
[00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:45.489]  And of course, it is crazy to do things like that.
[00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:47.670]  So people go, oh, they're nuts.
[00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:48.610]  Oh, they're crazy.
[00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:49.929]  What's wrong with New York State?
[00:53:51.159 --> 00:53:54.780]  And then they send a SWAT team, armed men, they break in.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.300]  Where's the raccoon?
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.079]  Where's the squirrel?
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.639]  Because they see them on television, and New York's got a law banning people having wild animals.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.079]  Bunch of the illegal aliens act like, you know, stuff a lot more dangerous than that.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.780]  But the point is, you know, dumping their prisons out worldwide.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.219]  Venezuela, two years ago, said, you can leave, you gotta go to America.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.619]  Murders, rapists, arsonists, kidnappers, bank robbers.
[00:54:18.579 --> 00:54:20.280]  But you're worried about a squirrel.
[00:54:21.989 --> 00:54:31.869]  And so then you say, well, that's really bad PR. They want to condition you to do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.010]  Like funding all over the Western world.
[00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:35.070]  That's an ESG score.
[00:54:35.769 --> 00:54:37.650]  BlackRock sets up the global thing.
[00:54:37.809 --> 00:54:38.570]  You don't get loans.
[00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:40.409]  You don't get support if you don't follow this.
[00:54:40.469 --> 00:54:42.789]  If you have a high ESG score, you get basically free money.
[00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.610]  And they engineer everything they want.
[00:54:46.329 --> 00:54:48.070]  Total control of every fastest society.
[00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:52.329]  And they want farming shut down.
[00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:55.610]  They want independent power generation shut down.
[00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.010]  They want fossil fuels shut down.
[00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.170]  They want meat and dairy shut down.
[00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:06.269]  Because that's the infrastructure of the population that's left and they're vertically integrating and consolidating society.
[00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.710]  That's how you conquer someone is feudalism.
[00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:20.630]  The most common form of government in the last 7,000 years of recording history, whether it's in Asia or Africa or what is Europe today or what is Latin America today, Mesoamerica, was feudalism.
[00:55:20.809 --> 00:55:24.809]  The rulers and they had their military and they kept the little people.
[00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:28.989]  They were always smaller than the lords because they had generations of malnourishment.
[00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:33.469]  On subsistence level, barely surviving to keep them down.
[00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:34.650]  That's feudalism.
[00:55:34.809 --> 00:55:37.690]  So this is just a modern form of feudalism.
[00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:39.969]  That's what this is.
[00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:43.190]  And they admit they're building back better.
[00:55:43.269 --> 00:55:44.469]  They admit it's a great reset.
[00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.730]  They admit you'll own nothing and, quote, be happy.
[00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:48.269]  They say you'll eat the bugs.
[00:55:48.389 --> 00:55:50.489]  And I told people that 20 years ago in documentaries.
[00:55:50.489 --> 00:55:52.730]  It was the plan to get rid of meat and make you eat bug protein.
[00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:53.829]  That's freaking nuts.
[00:55:53.949 --> 00:55:54.570]  It's in their documents.
[00:55:56.789 --> 00:56:12.369]  And now, in the last two years, every major top food producer, Tyson, General Mills, all of them, are putting bug protein instead of other proteins in cereals, breading for chicken, everything.
[00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:13.869]  There's whole reports.
[00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:15.829]  It's in everything now, and it's toxic.
[00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:17.670]  And they have movie stars.
[00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:18.510]  Oh, I love bugs.
[00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.449]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:20.230]  Oh, eat bugs.
[00:56:20.409 --> 00:56:24.889]  And in England and Canada, the more leptis areas, they're making kids eat bugs in school.
[00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.530]  It's all meant to see what you'll put up with.
[00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:29.170]  Will you put up with two men having a baby?
[00:56:29.409 --> 00:56:30.170]  Will you believe that?
[00:56:30.269 --> 00:56:31.190]  There's no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:32.050]  Will you be in the cult?
[00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.329]  Will you suspend logic?
[00:56:33.889 --> 00:56:36.050]  Will you believe that there is no gravity if they tell you?
[00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:38.070]  Are you in the cult?
[00:56:39.969 --> 00:56:46.789]  Will you take a shot that erases your immune system and doesn't protect you from the COVID? And still, when it comes out, it's a lie, still go get the shot?
[00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:51.409]  So they do this to break your will.
[00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:56.949]  They do this to do horrible things out in the open, have election fraud, stay in power, and get you to give up.
[00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:05.030]  And the hallmark, remember 15 years ago or so at the Super Bowl, they had a green police ad for Audi.
[00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:12.630]  And all over the world, it's the same uniform they wear, green pants, white shirts, all UN-approved, UN-standardized, but it's local, but it's a UN policy run.
[00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:20.869]  And it showed them arresting people for a hot tub that was too hot or a rain stove or any of that or buying meat at the grocery store.
[00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.409]  And then now everything in that's actually being done.
[00:57:28.489 --> 00:57:31.469]  So they're building giant factories everywhere.
[00:57:31.949 --> 00:57:34.110]  Bill Gates is behind it to make you eat bugs.
[00:57:34.449 --> 00:57:35.750]  They're not playing games.
[00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:42.590]  So when you hear about Peanut, I'm sorry, they killed the squirrel.
[00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:43.230]  It's just up front.
[00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:48.610]  They sent a SWAT team and then they took the squirrel and then they euthanized it.
[00:57:48.889 --> 00:57:50.449]  Made a big thing about it.
[00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:52.170]  Oh my God, we're the government.
[00:57:52.389 --> 00:57:54.230]  We saw your popular show.
[00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:56.409]  We'll go kill your beloved squirrel.
[00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:05.380]  I mean, I remember when I was a little kid They had all these local TV shows on that kind of copied nationwide Captain Kangaroo.
[00:58:05.619 --> 00:58:07.619]  They were off the air by the time I was 6 or 7.
[00:58:08.199 --> 00:58:15.619]  But when I was really little, I'd get up at like 4 or 5 in the morning before my parents got up and they'd take me to school or daycare or wherever they were both working.
[00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.500]  And I would turn on the television.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:26.880]  And really late at night, like 4 a.m., it'd be like some Africa, some old 50s movie.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:38.900]  But then later, at 6 a.m., Captain Kangaroo or something would come on, and they'd have little pet monkeys and little pet squirrels and pet raccoons that come out and do tricks.
[00:58:40.539 --> 00:58:44.699]  Imagine a SWAT team busting in there and then taking it and killing it.
[00:58:44.739 --> 00:58:47.420]  It's all about just raw insanity.
[00:58:48.889 --> 00:58:52.809]  Just absolute viciousness.
[00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.550]  That's a black squirrel, rock squirrel.
[00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:55.289]  Those are really cool.
[00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:00.369]  And this is sick.
[00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.489]  So there they are with their cat.
[00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:05.329]  And by the way, you say, oh, well, at least they didn't get the cat.
[00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:12.099]  All the leftist organizations in PETA want to outlaw The private ownership of pets.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.119]  Because that's the luxury you don't deserve.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.320]  And they say because the meat you're feeding them is bad for the earth as well.
[00:59:17.519 --> 00:59:20.559]  And they have TV ads in England and stuff going, we need to ban your pets.
[00:59:20.639 --> 00:59:21.619]  And they're moving to do it.
[00:59:21.739 --> 00:59:25.119]  So there's nothing these people won't take.
[00:59:25.219 --> 00:59:30.800]  So they see this happy woman with her squirrel, with her husband, and the squirrel doing tricks.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.320]  Just good wholesome fun.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:33.659]  And they showed you.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.579]  They sent arm SWAT team.
[00:59:35.719 --> 00:59:36.500]  They took it.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.719]  And they killed it.
[00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:52.090]  Well, my God, they've passed laws in a whole bunch of states to take people's kids as young as seven because the parents don't like the school brainwashing them into transitioning, and then under the Oregon law, they don't even tell you where the kid's gone.
[00:59:53.230 --> 01:00:01.369]  But they say they put them in these facilities with a bunch of other kids they're torturing and sterilizing and brainwashing and later going to cut their genitals off.
[01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:08.570]  I mean, this is a cult, and they're just normalizing this hellish crap that, oh, you'll get censored if you speak out.
[01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.369]  Oh, your ESG score will get censored.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.159]  And it's just about normalizing absolute total evil.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:21.820]  So you just got Peanut the Squirrel download, and again, I want everybody else to get this.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.039]  People go, oh, that idiot government, that mean government.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.800]  They want to train you.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.960]  They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.440]  What about, you worry about the squirrel?
[01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:34.019]  I am too, because it just shows how evil they are.
[01:00:35.059 --> 01:00:37.079]  Well, they won't deal with all the real serious stuff.
[01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.019]  They want to defund the police.
[01:00:38.139 --> 01:00:39.559]  It won't come to your house when it's getting broken into.
[01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:41.739]  But damn it, we saw your TV show.
[01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.579]  And you know the bureaucrats got pissed because his wife's hot.
[01:00:45.039 --> 01:00:49.519]  And yep, they're all trained and brainwashed as the Green Police, as the code enforcers.
[01:00:49.639 --> 01:01:02.860]  And under the UN-UNESCO Global Agenda 2030 program, the code enforcers are the total control system and the enforcement of the ESGs of the social credit store.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:11.940]  It's a social worker slash code enforcer that's going to take you away when you protest lockdowns in the future, the UN has said.
[01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:14.840]  And Tedros was on TV last week saying it again.
[01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:16.519]  And so was Dr.
[01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:17.179]  Peter Hotez.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.239]  And so was Eric Schmidt of Google and Alphabet.
[01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:26.460]  Oh, we're going to use the UN to censor NATO and probably need some NATO and UN troops here.
[01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.960]  It's all actually happening.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.019]  Talking about UN troops in America or any other country?
[01:01:33.579 --> 01:01:37.440]  And the head of the UN Rapid Reaction Force says we need to go into the countries and go into the houses and get the kids.
[01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:39.079]  Oh, the UN's not here as soldiers.
[01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:39.860]  They got guns, though.
[01:01:40.099 --> 01:01:41.940]  They're here to help you from the pandemic.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.320]  They cooked up and released.
[01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:53.199]  So, and they said decades ago, we'll use the pandemic to bring in world government and bring in the world ID that's then tied to everything else.
[01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.090]  So that's why this is important.
[01:01:57.269 --> 01:02:05.250]  But we have 325,000 kids they admit in the last four years brought in the government, disappeared their names, disappeared of many of them in slave labor and sex slavery.
[01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:07.449]  So you're worried about a squirrel?
[01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.349]  People think that's bad?
[01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:14.869]  These are people that smuggle, many of them kidnapped when they got here, and disappear little kids on record, and it's not a bigger issue.
[01:02:14.949 --> 01:02:15.530]  It's like a footnote.
[01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:19.090]  And then Kamala and Mayorkas did this.
[01:02:29.949 --> 01:02:37.070]  So, that is the reality of how you're being conditioned, how you're being trained, how you're, even though you don't like it, they're still getting you used to it.
[01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:44.210]  What do you think after they stage 9-11 and the borders are wide open, but then they grope your genitals, put you in body scanners, have you take your shoes off to go to the airport?
[01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:50.309]  That's a humiliation ritual of internal checkpoints, which they admit they're going to expand to highway checkpoints, bus terminals, everywhere.
[01:02:50.949 --> 01:02:51.929]  And it's happening worldwide.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.239]  The border's wide open.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.619]  Illegals can fly without any ideas.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.619]  But you are going to get groped.
[01:02:57.679 --> 01:02:58.480]  You're going to get controlled.
[01:02:58.639 --> 01:02:59.300]  You're going to get dominated.
[01:02:59.559 --> 01:03:01.820]  It's all about grooming you.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.420]  Just like a pedophile slowly grooms a child.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.599]  Look at this.
[01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:07.579]  Rest in peace, Fred.
[01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:09.460]  Oh, they killed the raccoon, too.
[01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.739]  And Peanut, the squirrel, euthanized by the New York government.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.639]  These are sick, evil people.
[01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:29.900]  By the way, my dad's cousin that lived across the street at the ranch, Pat Lynn, he had pet squirrels too.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.619]  I forgot about that.
[01:03:30.679 --> 01:03:32.099]  That's where Joe Lynn learned about it.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.360]  I come from Rednecks.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.320]  Pat Lynn, Joe Lynn, Jerry Earl, David Ross.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.380]  And they're all named.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:39.980]  I love it.
[01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:40.860]  I actually like it.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:44.039]  They're all named after their grandfathers or fathers.
[01:03:44.139 --> 01:03:45.119]  So you just mix the names.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.340]  It's how that works.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:47.920]  Joe David.
[01:03:50.449 --> 01:03:52.050]  But, yeah, Pat Lynn.
[01:03:52.369 --> 01:03:53.070]  God, what a great guy.
[01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.949]  I wish he didn't die.
[01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:55.429]  These people are great, man.
[01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.250]  They had stuff like...
[01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:59.789]  What was the other thing they told me about?
[01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:00.570]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:03.530]  One time he found a baby skunk, Pat Lynn did.
[01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:05.489]  And...
[01:04:09.199 --> 01:04:14.940]  They said it lived about four years, but they got hit by a car because they lived by pretty close, not a highway, but a county road.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.380]  And what was that squirrel?
[01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:18.960]  What was that skunk's name?
[01:04:19.099 --> 01:04:22.420]  I used to love to hear these kids when I was a kid, these stories when I was a kid.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.800]  They had this female skunk, and it would...
[01:04:31.019 --> 01:04:36.760]  The problem is they had to let it out at night or it would always come whisper and like, you think a cat gets in your ear and demands you get up?
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:46.980]  And it would also, but also it would bring you things it knew you liked, like it would bring Pat Lynn his cigarettes and then it would start scratching at the pantry door for food.
[01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:59.360]  Or it would bring him something he liked, like a tangerine, and then it would climb up on the table, because it could get food, but it would ask permission to get the food.
[01:04:59.699 --> 01:05:03.619]  I mean, damn smart skunks.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.940]  But the point is, is that...
[01:05:09.619 --> 01:05:10.440]  Oh my God, look at this.
[01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:10.920]  I love this.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.099]  Put this on little boats.
[01:05:13.719 --> 01:05:15.099]  That's so mean to do that.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.480]  And look, there's nothing wrong with shooting squirrels either.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.500]  They're wild.
[01:05:18.639 --> 01:05:19.059]  You shoot them.
[01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:19.780]  They're dead in one second.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.320]  You go eat them.
[01:05:21.929 --> 01:05:26.210]  Just like you can have, you know, some people never even kill their cows because they come like pets.
[01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:32.170]  You know, smaller farms and the kids are petting the cow and we're not going to do that.
[01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:35.309]  But my point is, is that it's our business.
[01:05:35.550 --> 01:05:36.969]  They're taking away our freedoms.
[01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:38.849]  They're totally enslaving everybody.
[01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:40.010]  It's pure crap.
[01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:45.929]  So I've spent a lot of time on this during the election emergency update, but they're going to take everything.
[01:05:45.929 --> 01:05:54.239]  If you list, if you look at the list of everything that they're going to take away under the ESG system, It's the sky's the limit, and they're always adding more.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.940]  And you say, well, I'll just comply with their social credit score.
[01:05:57.139 --> 01:05:58.500]  Well, they're always going to raise the bar.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:09.260]  It's about shutting down civilization while the globalists vertically integrate power, creating dystopia, and then offering you euthanization.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:14.460]  And in the case of Canada, the Netherlands, and other places, they're now saying, oh, you're on welfare.
[01:06:14.659 --> 01:06:15.579]  Oh, you got a broken back.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.920]  The state's going to make you a war to the state, even though you're mentally there, and we're going to kill you.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.659]  They tried to pass that this year.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.119]  It narrowly got beat in Canada.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.900]  Their doctors finally stood up and said, okay, we're not going to do that.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.119]  So Trudeau said it's tabled till 2027.
[01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:41.570]  I mean, even liberal newspapers are like, well, I mean, you can't have the state with a disabled person, you know, and it showed people they were trying to kill.
[01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:52.369]  Well, this guy, you know, Fred was in a car wreck six years ago, and he got reconstructive surgery on his back, but he's in incredible pain and has trouble walking, and, you know, he's been on welfare, and Fred doesn't want to die.
[01:06:52.590 --> 01:07:05.230]  And he goes, and they just keep, here's the letters, they keep telling me I need to choose to die, and they're not going to give me money anymore, and all I get is like a thousand bucks a month, but they got Plenty of money for all the illegal aliens and all their wars and Ukraine and all the rest of it.
[01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:16.449]  And again, they get you in a liberal system, they get you on a social credit score, they get you on universal basic income, universal basic income, and then they dictate everything to you through that.
[01:07:17.489 --> 01:07:25.329]  So yeah, if you don't have a dog or cat, kids, or you sterilize your kids and you do whatever they say, for a while you get put ahead because you're doing what they want.
[01:07:25.869 --> 01:07:30.150]  Just like a mouse that eats the cheese, they're not giving the mouse cheese because they like it.
[01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:33.150]  Or a worm on a hook for a fish, they're not giving it to you because they like it.
[01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:38.110]  And there's the naivete of the people that go along with this system.
[01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:41.090]  But we had so much freedom before.
[01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:45.550]  People get decadent and dumbed down and don't understand it because they are domesticated.
[01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:49.409]  Just like a domesticated deer, you can raise a deer in your backyard, bring it in the house.
[01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:50.769]  It has no fear of humans.
[01:07:50.769 --> 01:07:52.210]  You go dump it out of deer season.
[01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.030]  In the middle of nowhere, it's dead in 10 minutes.
[01:07:54.389 --> 01:07:58.230]  But the deer that know to stay in the woods during the day during deer season, only eat at night, they're fine.
[01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:02.789]  And see, a domesticated person doesn't recognize threats.
[01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.510]  And because the system pats on the head and says, oh, it's for your own good.
[01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:06.250]  People are bad.
[01:08:06.329 --> 01:08:06.909]  We're saving the earth.
[01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:07.949]  That's why we're doing this.
[01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.570]  Yeah, you take your shot.
[01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.869]  Good.
[01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:10.929]  Oh, you're dying of heart attack?
[01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:11.369]  That's okay.
[01:08:14.769 --> 01:08:15.989]  So it's a big deal.
[01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.609]  I want to shift gears back into everything else I've got here.
[01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:24.010]  But this is really, really important.
[01:08:24.369 --> 01:08:27.170]  And it's important to recognize, I mean, are you domesticated?
[01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.229]  And we're all domesticated to a certain extent.
[01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.130]  Are you civilized, what they call it?
[01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.170]  But do you know how to do basic things?
[01:08:35.369 --> 01:08:46.630]  And a lot of being dialed in, street smart, is not knowing how to skin a buck or run a trot line or wire electricity or fix an engine or grow crops or any of that.
[01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:47.149]  That's all important.
[01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.199]  Do you know how to recognize tyranny?
[01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:56.979]  Do you know how to recognize BS? Do you understand that people wanting to get control of your life are not your friends?
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:06.060]  I mean, where all the globalist stuff comes from at the top, they admit it's about getting you weak, isolating you, to suck the money out of you and kill your ass.
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.279]  And you've got to admit those ruthless people exist.
[01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.020]  You've got to look at history and admit that's more common than freedom.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:17.859]  And you've actually got to go look at what the globalists say and are doing, and they're openly saying that, and they think you're so stupid.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:25.600]  They write best-selling books and do speeches about depopulation and world government and how you're all scum and how you're all trash and how they need to use shots to sterilize you.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.100]  Oh, don't worry what I just said, sweetheart.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.239]  You just take this shot.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:31.579]  So...
[01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:41.460]  I get it's scary to admit all this, and they just think people will choose in denial while they set all this up, and it gets closer and worse and more intense and more obvious.
[01:09:42.659 --> 01:09:44.199]  And in many cases, it's not close.
[01:09:44.199 --> 01:09:45.159]  It's on top of us.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:45.579]  It's here.
[01:09:45.699 --> 01:09:46.399]  Been here a while.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:53.279]  And you're the frog, and it's starting to boil, and I'm already jumped out, and I said, listen, you need to jump out of there, Bob, Fred, whatever the...
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.760]  Frog's name is.
[01:09:54.859 --> 01:09:56.220]  You're like, no, I actually like hot tubs.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:57.600]  It would pass out and die.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.600]  And a lot of people have already politically and culturally passed out.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:07.880]  Hell, a lot of them gotten killed by the GMO and killed by the 5G and killed by the mRNA shots and killed by all the food additives.
[01:10:08.039 --> 01:10:10.500]  I mean, you know, this is serious business.
[01:10:11.899 --> 01:10:16.140]  People, you know, all the time say, man, you really get excited.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.380]  You got a lot of energy.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.479]  I had Dale Comstock, really famous badass soldier, Delta Force leader, all that stuff.
[01:10:24.899 --> 01:10:30.920]  And he's watching me for a couple hours before he goes on in the green room and he comes out there and he's behind the scenes giving orders and documents and articles.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.800]  He goes, man, you got a lot of energy.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.399]  What's going on?
[01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.319]  He's kind of looking at my eyes.
[01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:35.300]  I'm like, no, I'm not on drugs.
[01:10:35.659 --> 01:10:36.800]  Had a couple cups of coffee today.
[01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:42.340]  I said, I'm not fired up when I'm not at the office or I'm at the house of my family.
[01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:43.680]  I'm actually sitting around.
[01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:46.720]  I go to parties and just sit there for like two hours, watch people talk.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.720]  I go to a party.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.359]  People go, God, this guy doesn't even talk.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:11:06.220]  No, when I'm up here talking about them SWAT teaming people's houses and killing their squirrels while the damn border's wide open and they're cutting all the energy supplies off and killed 30 million people and the insurance actuaries admitted with a poison shot they know does it that also accelerates cancer and infertility.
[01:11:06.739 --> 01:11:12.579]  And of course we knew back when they put fluoride in in the late 40s it creates cancer and infertility and dumbs you down.
[01:11:12.619 --> 01:11:14.619]  Now the government admits that and says we're keeping it in there anyways.
[01:11:16.649 --> 01:11:25.130]  I'm like, I said to him, I said, I bet you get fired up, you know, when you need to.
[01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:26.229]  And he goes, well, yeah.
[01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.750]  And I'm like, yeah.
[01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:28.350]  I was like, this is a fight right now.
[01:11:29.069 --> 01:11:30.989]  And I need to get people out of their comfort zone.
[01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:34.949]  And I don't deliberately act like this when I get up here on air.
[01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:40.489]  I do it because my physiology is I'm warning people.
[01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:42.010]  And I guarantee you, your ancestors...
[01:11:43.439 --> 01:11:58.899]  Whether you're from Africa or Europe or wherever you're from, I guarantee you, 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, 500 years ago, you had ancestors that lived on a coastline somewhere or lived inland,
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:11:59.180]  wherever.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.939]  And you've got your tribe, maybe it's a couple thousand people, and you've got your little villages.
[01:12:05.079 --> 01:12:17.270]  And you heard stories from your grandfather about when the tribe from over the mountains Came and attacked and how they had their shields and swords and what you saw.
[01:12:17.369 --> 01:12:18.390]  And you've never really seen that.
[01:12:18.909 --> 01:12:31.989]  In fact, you'd only seen traders come through every few weeks or so and trade beads or things for food or furs or whatever, or maybe for dried fish or dried elk.
[01:12:32.989 --> 01:12:35.149]  And let's say you're in ancient Europe.
[01:12:36.489 --> 01:12:43.670]  But your grandpa said, you know, in his time, when he was a kid, these raiders came over the hill and how they were dressed and what they did and how they...
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.600]  Killed a bunch of men in the village.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.140]  The men fought back, but they didn't know they were coming.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.819]  And then they stole a bunch of stuff and ran off with some of the women and kids.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.880]  That's just the standard thing that went on.
[01:12:57.739 --> 01:13:01.079]  Get a bunch of women, get a bunch of kids, make the kids slaves, make the women slaves.
[01:13:03.619 --> 01:13:05.380]  Because every culture had caste systems.
[01:13:05.659 --> 01:13:08.279]  Africans, Vikings, all of them the same thing.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.380]  This tribe wouldn't grab that tribe and would say, you guys are the slaves.
[01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:14.369]  Could be cousins related to each other.
[01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.949]  It didn't matter.
[01:13:15.369 --> 01:13:16.869]  Back then, everybody was making everybody slaves.
[01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:17.489]  How the world worked.
[01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:20.069]  And there were lots of little villages.
[01:13:20.289 --> 01:13:22.649]  But, you know, not everybody's in the village when it gets attacked.
[01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:23.489]  Some are out fishing.
[01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:24.329]  Some are out in the woods.
[01:13:24.489 --> 01:13:24.789]  Some are out.
[01:13:24.869 --> 01:13:25.750]  You know, the women run.
[01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:26.449]  Some get away.
[01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.149]  And so, you know, they've still got a few swords and a few spears.
[01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:31.449]  But nobody really has to fight.
[01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:33.869]  And they're just out there having a good time.
[01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:34.890]  And everybody's kind of nice.
[01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:35.710]  And then...
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:53.960]  But you heard your grandpa talk about when he was seven years old, how they came, and so you're hunting off further that time, and you know, people will go hunt sometimes for days and days, and so you're 20 miles off, and you've only a few times with your dad and grandfather been to this gorge and seen this valley where he said they came from,
[01:13:54.039 --> 01:13:59.579]  and you know, you've got your sights on this deer or whatever it is you're hunting.
[01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:03.500]  And all of a sudden, you hear some men talking, you hear some stuff going on, and you go, wait a minute.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.680]  I don't see people a lot.
[01:14:04.699 --> 01:14:06.680]  Let me just hide behind this boulder and see what I see.
[01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:09.229]  And it's getting near dark.
[01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:19.569]  And all of a sudden you see these men with shields and spears dressed the way your grandfather said come walking through the valley and they're about 50 yards away because you heard them.
[01:14:19.949 --> 01:14:22.390]  They're coming around the bend and you sit and you wait and you watch.
[01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:29.630]  And then you sit there and watch for an hour as 3,000 of them go by or 1,000 of them go by.
[01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:34.989]  And then you wait and you creep out and you follow up another mile or so and they've got a camp.
[01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:36.750]  Under the lee of the mountain.
[01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:39.810]  And you know your family is just about 15 miles away.
[01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:40.869]  So what do you do?
[01:14:41.489 --> 01:14:43.130]  You don't sleep.
[01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:44.850]  You get down.
[01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:46.609]  And you sneak around them.
[01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:48.210]  And you go through the passes at night.
[01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:49.270]  Maybe even fall down.
[01:14:49.409 --> 01:14:51.270]  Because, you know, cloud over the mountain was hard even during the day.
[01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.949]  But you get there.
[01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:53.710]  And you get there at dawn.
[01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.710]  You go nonstop 15 miles.
[01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:58.430]  And you say, Raiders are coming!
[01:14:58.670 --> 01:14:59.529]  Raiders are coming!
[01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:01.569]  And everybody's just like...
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:04.400]  Raiders.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:11.180]  You know, like, yeah, Grandpa, you know, and others, and everybody runs around the camp, and, you know, people try to talk to a few elders.
[01:15:11.319 --> 01:15:13.739]  Yes, that's, and then the elders say, well, how were they dressed?
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.079]  And then half the group decides to leave, run.
[01:15:22.399 --> 01:15:26.239]  The other half, though, just says, eh, you're not sure.
[01:15:26.399 --> 01:15:27.479]  You're just crying wolf.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.600]  Yeah, we're going to, we'll post some guards down there.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:29.979]  We'll see.
[01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:33.409]  And so half the people survive.
[01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.510]  The other half, they wait.
[01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.470]  But they do post some guards.
[01:15:40.909 --> 01:15:42.850]  And maybe they see them coming.
[01:15:42.909 --> 01:15:43.250]  Maybe they don't.
[01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:44.670]  Maybe they go to sleep at night and get raided.
[01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:49.810]  But at least some of them were sleeping with their eyes half open or one eye open, so some of them survived.
[01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:51.229]  But that's what this is.
[01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:56.869]  So see, people that have for 50, 60 years not been raided, that's a million years ago.
[01:15:57.189 --> 01:16:00.630]  Most of the people that are dead that ever saw it, it becomes a fable.
[01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:02.409]  You don't really want to believe it.
[01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:07.649]  And see, they're one generation or two domesticated.
[01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:10.289]  They're domesticated.
[01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:14.510]  Because, you know, 65 years since the last raid is like a million years.
[01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:17.229]  And to them, that's never going to happen.
[01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:18.270]  There's a normalcy bias.
[01:16:20.989 --> 01:16:33.689]  Oh, yeah, they burned the village down and, you know, killed the men and were raping the women in front of you, and they had black shields with a bear head on it, and yeah, sure, and the men had sharpened their teeth, and yeah, right, sure.
[01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:39.369]  Yes, we're just out here fishing and hunting in a happy little village, because you ain't warlike.
[01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:52.430]  And because your culture didn't build up to 50,000 people in a city 100 miles away, and they've got an outpost 30 miles away, and now they've run out of resources, and they're expanding, and they're not going to come share it with you.
[01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:56.689]  They're going to kill you and take your women and children, you dumb fucks!
[01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.569]  So here's how it works.
[01:17:00.689 --> 01:17:01.750]  I got instincts.
[01:17:01.989 --> 01:17:03.470]  A bunch of you people don't.
[01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:07.970]  Now, most of the people tuned in here have instincts, life experience, and are smart.
[01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:19.109]  But the reason I get up here and I get pissed off is because I've seen the enemy, I've watched him, and I didn't just see him for a minute and hear Grandpa tell me about it.
[01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:35.649]  I've studied history, I've researched it, I understand it, I've experienced the tyranny, I've watched what they've done to everybody else, I've watched what they're doing to us right now and normalizing it, and when the village doesn't listen to me, I start saying, hey, you dumb sons of bitches!
[01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:39.850]  And then some people say, well, if they're that dumb, let them die.
[01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:41.510]  Let's get out of here.
[01:17:42.109 --> 01:17:51.489]  Well, if I could get with my wife and kids and leave the village and had a map and even knew what's 50 miles away, maybe we run to another tribe.
[01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:52.750]  Because back then they didn't know.
[01:17:52.909 --> 01:17:53.729]  They kind of stayed in their area.
[01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.409]  It kind of got dangerous to go somewhere else.
[01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:59.850]  But yeah, you'd haul ass.
[01:18:00.029 --> 01:18:01.529]  There's nowhere to haul ass to.
[01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:04.489]  It's a global government that poisons your water and food.
[01:18:04.649 --> 01:18:05.369]  They're assholes.
[01:18:05.869 --> 01:18:08.069]  But to them, they're like, just get rid of all these people.
[01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:11.289]  We're not going to have a world of amusement parks and video games.
[01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:13.029]  Everybody lays around robots, takes care of them.
[01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:14.930]  They say that for decades.
[01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:15.329]  I've read it.
[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:16.449]  Every publication you can imagine.
[01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:18.149]  Bill Joy, Wired Magazine, all of them.
[01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:20.149]  And they just repeat the same thing.
[01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:25.449]  We don't need too many Posh Wab robot polishers.
[01:18:26.279 --> 01:18:28.340]  Yeah, they don't need robot polishers, okay?
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.100]  They've decided your ass is gone.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.800]  Human life has always been cheap.
[01:18:32.979 --> 01:18:34.220]  Now it's seen as garbage.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.239]  It's negative value.
[01:18:36.659 --> 01:18:38.100]  Other than body parts for them.
[01:18:38.579 --> 01:18:40.159]  They can grow those in labs now.
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.699]  So they don't need you.
[01:18:41.779 --> 01:18:42.520]  They don't want you.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:47.239]  And if you won't stand up for yourself and organize in a pro-human system to stop these people, you're dumb.
[01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:48.920]  So here's the thing.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.800]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.840]  I don't have courage.
[01:18:53.819 --> 01:18:55.619]  I'm not joining them because I'm not evil.
[01:18:55.779 --> 01:18:56.840]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[01:18:57.619 --> 01:19:03.439]  Literally, the Kissinger group invited me to go literally work for them in front of the producer, John Harmon.
[01:19:05.539 --> 01:19:08.279]  So I'm not joining these people.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.439]  And so what am I supposed to do?
[01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:22.250]  And people say, well, the globalists say what villagers would say that we're actually going to leave, but they would say similar, but from their perspective, look, the public's dumb.
[01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:24.029]  You're smart because you understand this.
[01:19:24.109 --> 01:19:24.649]  Just join us.
[01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.689]  No, I'm not smart like you.
[01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:28.850]  You're evil.
[01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:33.510]  And the system you're building will end up destroying you, too.
[01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:38.050]  So we don't need conquest.
[01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:41.050]  We need renaissance.
[01:19:41.989 --> 01:19:44.050]  We need expansion that Elon Musk is talking about.
[01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:53.149]  We have unlimited resources, but again, they want to make resources limited so you'll act like an animal and do the things they want you to in a resource war.
[01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:56.350]  An angrier world that Klaus Schwab talks about.
[01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:58.109]  So, I'm laying it on you.
[01:19:58.189 --> 01:20:00.289]  And you see the minions of the left.
[01:20:00.449 --> 01:20:00.989]  They're dumb.
[01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.689]  They're evil.
[01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:02.609]  They're out of control.
[01:20:04.449 --> 01:20:05.770]  The wages of sin are death.
[01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:11.949]  So, If you can't have a pet squirrel and a TV show about it, are you in a free country?
[01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.949]  No.
[01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:21.550]  And if they can normalize that and do that, well, then they can take farmers' property and they can take your kid and sterilize them, and they are.
[01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:26.729]  So that's kind of a snapshot on peanut.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.380]  And by the way, I wasn't bashing Dale Comstock.
[01:20:31.479 --> 01:20:32.060]  He's a great guy.
[01:20:32.239 --> 01:20:36.859]  But to him, it's like, well, I'm cool when I'm not having to do a mission or cool when you're doing a mission, too.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.000]  What is this?
[01:20:40.079 --> 01:20:42.140]  Well, this is someone jumping up and down.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.899]  I mean, let's say I'm a chimpanzee and a lion is coming into the woods.
[01:20:53.939 --> 01:20:55.460]  And I see it 100 yards away.
[01:20:55.979 --> 01:21:02.840]  Well, I mean, a monkey or a chimpanzee, chimpanzee's an ape, is not going to take its time to come up and have a little whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
[01:21:03.699 --> 01:21:07.739]  It's going to scream its head off and run to the top of a tree and warn all the others.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:15.840]  Now, he genuinely cares about the other apes, but it's empathies built into him that sometime he might have his back turned.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.000]  So he's going to listen to his buddies when they run up in a tree.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.340]  But see, he's not domesticated.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.539]  He's surviving.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.859]  He knows lions are real.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.680]  He knows jackals are real.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.199]  He knows panthers are real.
[01:21:31.039 --> 01:21:32.600]  He knows hyenas are real.
[01:21:34.319 --> 01:21:36.899]  He knows 15-foot-long king covers are real.
[01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:47.489]  So when his buddies scream and warn people, guys, let's pull up a chimpanzee warning call.
[01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:51.750]  It sounds like a woman's scream.
[01:21:53.579 --> 01:21:54.699]  But even more intense.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.880]  I can do it, but it won't hurt my throat.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.680]  And see, they're not domesticated.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:06.460]  But I'm doing a chimpanzee warning call, but in modern human parlance with all the data on top of it.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.079]  But I'm going...
[01:22:07.079 --> 01:22:11.420]  And it's all funny, isn't it?
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.100]  It's cute.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.979]  While I watch everybody mutate and fall apart in front of me, including myself, all the damn poison they're hitting us with.
[01:22:17.239 --> 01:22:18.560]  The freaking geoengineering.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.640]  It's all public, Department of Energy, but oh, there's no such thing as chemtrails because they don't call it that.
[01:22:24.119 --> 01:22:35.579]  Like if you called a gunshot wound a hot mess, and you go to the FBI statistics and said there's no such thing in the FBI statistics as a hot mess.
[01:22:37.439 --> 01:22:41.340]  Well, you go call it, I've got a Freedom of Information Act about chemtrails.
[01:22:41.439 --> 01:22:42.539]  They go, sorry, no such thing.
[01:22:43.079 --> 01:22:44.180]  It's geoengineering.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.039]  It's aerosol atmospheric spraying.
[01:22:51.419 --> 01:22:53.819]  So, again, they play these games.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.680]  Like, oh, no, no.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.399]  That UN tree doesn't set up global government.
[01:22:58.159 --> 01:23:02.420]  It sets up the global governance for the planet, the exact same meaning.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.399]  But they play these games with you.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.000]  And people keep responding to it like it's true or have a debate with it.
[01:23:10.199 --> 01:23:13.199]  They're damn liars, predators out to get you.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.920]  So, I'm here warning you.
[01:23:25.079 --> 01:23:27.880]  And my job's gotten easier because stuff's getting really bad.
[01:23:28.899 --> 01:23:31.880]  But still, people don't even get one-tenth how bad it is.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.579]  And none of it's done by accident.
[01:23:33.819 --> 01:23:35.319]  None of it's done by incompetence.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.560]  It's all completely organized and evil.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:49.619]  And if you just reject everything they say and everything they do and anywhere you can don't support them and warn everyone about them constantly and just people are ready, we will beat them.
[01:23:50.119 --> 01:23:56.100]  And it doesn't mean we've got some utopia because they just went along with our own decadence that was already there with civilization.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:02.140]  They know that hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make bad times.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:02.760]  They know that.
[01:24:05.319 --> 01:24:08.659]  So, they're exacerbating, and they were right about that.
[01:24:08.819 --> 01:24:10.199]  They're making our behavior worse.
[01:24:10.399 --> 01:24:15.100]  So, part of all this freedom and all this largesse is like being on a Mars mission with no gravity.
[01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:16.520]  You can be in the best shape of the world.
[01:24:16.579 --> 01:24:18.039]  You get there six months later, you can barely walk.
[01:24:18.439 --> 01:24:24.600]  So, freedom, decadence, is what comes out of freedom, is a paradox, so we get weak and stupid and domesticated.
[01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:32.479]  And so even when we got rid of the New World Order overnight, we're so decadent and stupid, it's kind of a process like the old CLs, you're making our point, kill them all.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.680]  Yeah, but you're even the worst of all of us.
[01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:36.439]  Start with yourself.
[01:24:36.439 --> 01:24:39.260]  No, you've got to build in a competitive society.
[01:24:40.399 --> 01:24:46.800]  You've got to have all the archetypal rituals that Carl Jung talked about that are absolutely part of what we need to do.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:25:03.239]  You've got to have very amazing human goal potentials that you don't make people do, but with the right leaders inspiring people, you won't be able to stop people wanting to do very dangerous space exploration and extremely, just wild stuff we can be doing.
[01:25:03.359 --> 01:25:05.159]  And we can volunteer for all that stuff.
[01:25:05.279 --> 01:25:08.899]  And groups can volunteer that want to go merge with robots and go build a base over here.
[01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:12.010]  But you've got to go, as an adult, admit that and go do that here.
[01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:30.590]  And if there's a group that wants to do this, and you're very public about all the super technology and all the stuff, and groups that want to be primitive and live like real humans, you should absolutely have the maximum protection and be given the freest reign to build operations for standard real human colonies.
[01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:32.210]  And you can do everything.
[01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:33.770]  And just be completely honest about it.
[01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:44.750]  But you've got to go maximum exploration, maximum innovation, open the floodgates up, and even if we do all that, there's a good chance we're going to blow the planet up.
[01:25:44.949 --> 01:25:45.970]  So Elon Musk is right.
[01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:48.750]  We've got to launch type one civilization operations immediately.
[01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:52.189]  Instead of suppressing all this technology, you've got to bring it all out.
[01:25:52.710 --> 01:26:02.390]  And then you've got to end the welfare, end the decadence, end the crap, and end these stupid wars, and instead have super insane competitive technology races.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.079]  And that's how it needs to be done.
[01:26:07.359 --> 01:26:11.340]  I mean, we are a competitive creature, just like you need to work out or you'll fall apart.
[01:26:11.479 --> 01:26:12.920]  We have to make it human.
[01:26:13.079 --> 01:26:14.460]  We have to do it human.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:19.739]  And if people want to give up or augment their humanity, that's going to be their right.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.500]  People say, oh, Elon Musk is evil and bad.
[01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:23.319]  He's doing all this cyborg stuff.
[01:26:23.319 --> 01:26:27.659]  And I think those are back doors and will always be turned to evil and will take you over.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.800]  But people have a right to do it.
[01:26:31.779 --> 01:26:32.939]  And it's a very complex issue.
[01:26:33.039 --> 01:26:34.439]  It's like, do I like calculators or not?
[01:26:34.659 --> 01:26:36.180]  Well, everybody can do math until they came out.
[01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:36.880]  Now nobody can.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.260]  The point is, all this stuff's killing us.
[01:26:40.659 --> 01:26:52.060]  And I say, once we break through this next technological level, we can like, very quickly, very quickly, you know, okay, there's set up all sorts of, you name it.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.119]  And I think humanity will discover in the end, going back to basics is the way to do it.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:04.369]  And still have technology, but Pro-human technology that doesn't dominate you.
[01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:10.510]  And Frank Herbert envisioned this in his, the first Doom book's great, the others get, you know, just for money, and they weren't as well-written.
[01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:24.449]  But like, they've already had machines take them over and enslave them, so they've still got machines, but they're still powerful, but they're limited and human-controlled to empower the human and make the human be more advanced, not the machine make you weaker than replace you.
[01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:34.779]  Because, yes, we are building towards obsolescence of humans, Even though we're the incredible creatures that created all of this, because the globalists are deploying all of this to remove humans from the equation.
[01:27:34.979 --> 01:27:39.899]  Not just your farm, not just your cows, not just your squirrel, not just your son or daughter being sterilized.
[01:27:39.979 --> 01:27:41.079]  They want you gone.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.520]  They don't want your competition.
[01:27:42.939 --> 01:27:48.779]  They want access to all this super technology for them to organize, and they don't want a big open debate about it.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.279]  They want it reservationed.
[01:27:50.939 --> 01:27:54.520]  I think?
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.319]  All right, I'm getting into futurist analysis and what's really going on in the world.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.340]  But here's the thing.
[01:28:11.699 --> 01:28:15.239]  If you're not having a real debate or discussion about this, you're not a serious person.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:23.899]  You do not even get listened to seriously by the good guys or the bad guys or the people that are just pragmatic if you don't understand how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.699]  So I just told you how all this worked.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:37.199]  And if you want a post-human world and you want to have your food and water cut off and your energy cut off and you want to be drugged up and sterilized and finally killed and given poison shots, then these people are for you.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.020]  And that's what they're setting up.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.399]  And if adults wanted to kill themselves in the global system, that's their right.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.739]  But you don't have a right to induct the children into it.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.539]  We're here to protect them.
[01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:54.810]  And that's where I stand.
[01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:57.989]  I get the sick eugenics thing of these people are so dumb, let them do this.
[01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:00.649]  And I get the left, the main ones dying left and right from the shots.
[01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:01.430]  I get it.
[01:29:01.529 --> 01:29:03.510]  But that's just wrong to let them do that.
[01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.909]  And they're giving it to kids too.
[01:29:05.109 --> 01:29:07.829]  So I don't want to hear the joke about the lefts all dying from the shots because they are.
[01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:12.250]  Those are our weaker people that were childlike, that got caught in Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:15.489]  And it's our job to try to reach out to the ones that we can, okay?
[01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:17.130]  Jesus.
[01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:18.090]  Excuse me.
[01:29:19.329 --> 01:29:19.689]  No.
[01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:26.770]  So we're doing emergency transmission here.
[01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:31.909]  I appreciate the crew working so hard to get this studio, backup studio, fired up and ready.
[01:29:31.909 --> 01:29:33.649]  We got some other stuff as well up the sleeve.
[01:29:34.689 --> 01:29:37.869]  And we want a big giant studio.
[01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:38.630]  We can have one too.
[01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:41.750]  And we've got a bigger studio here for guests and stuff.
[01:29:41.829 --> 01:29:42.590]  But this is the news desk.
[01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.329]  It's very cozy.
[01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:44.409]  I like it.
[01:29:44.449 --> 01:29:45.510]  We got a lot of stuff we can add in here.
[01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:47.850]  And I can interview guests right here.
[01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:52.470]  They can cut over and I can talk to them right over there on that camera or on that screen.
[01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:58.630]  Over the shot, shoulder shot for me.
[01:29:58.729 --> 01:29:59.090]  There it is.
[01:29:59.170 --> 01:29:59.310]  Boom.
[01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:02.369]  And a lot happened.
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:06.399]  So I forgot this screen doesn't ever switch off.
[01:30:06.539 --> 01:30:07.800]  So I'm like, where am I? Go to that shot.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.279]  Oh, there it is.
[01:30:08.539 --> 01:30:10.539]  So there's a lot of fun stuff going on.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.399]  And boom, from right here to all the radio and TV stations, they don't take us off any of those.
[01:30:14.939 --> 01:30:17.060]  That's really the big ace in the hole, isn't it?
[01:30:17.239 --> 01:30:18.520]  Those dumbasses I'm going to think about.
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.760]  Because they can't surveil talk radio like they can on the Internet, so it doesn't even affect them.
[01:30:22.939 --> 01:30:25.319]  Like, oh, that isn't over there because I can't really see it.
[01:30:25.399 --> 01:30:26.560]  Well, other people can.
[01:30:27.079 --> 01:30:28.420]  They're still dialed into that.
[01:30:29.239 --> 01:30:29.840]  And that's the thing.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:35.100]  We need diversity of culture, diversity of media, diversity of ideas, scalability of everything, competition.
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:36.300]  That's what it's all about.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:36.939]  All right.
[01:30:37.039 --> 01:30:37.880]  I didn't get to the squirrel.
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:44.119]  And if one of the crew members tomorrow or whenever, I think the squirrel needs to be responded to, or maybe viewers can do this.
[01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:47.979]  Take those last 30 minutes or whatever I did on the squirrel.
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:54.500]  Understand, understanding peanut, the squirrel is understanding the universe.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.539]  How I discovered peanut.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:00.159]  The answers to the universe through Peanut the Squirrel.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.520]  How I understood the New World Order's plan.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:06.220]  How the murder of Peanut brought down the New World Order.
[01:31:07.159 --> 01:31:08.300]  Just kind of cut it down.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.319]  I know we're live right now.
[01:31:09.479 --> 01:31:14.119]  And then just put the newscast maybe up front so we can kind of cut to the chase.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:15.699]  I can get back to the massive election fraud.
[01:31:15.819 --> 01:31:21.079]  And while we're doing this emergency broadcasting here, tune in to hear about has Kamal already stole the election and what's really happening.
[01:31:21.119 --> 01:31:21.619]  Is that true?
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.699]  And I'm spending a long time on peanut and squirrel.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.380]  But it's important to kind of get into that larger understanding, isn't it?
[01:31:27.479 --> 01:31:29.220]  And I'm telling you, what I'm saying is not my opinion.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.640]  This is how the world works, how the globalists operate in their response to it.
[01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:44.369]  And Everybody else just kind of operates these little side cul-de-sacs of disinformation and brainwashing and false paradigm rabbit trails.
[01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:57.550]  And that's why they don't like me, because I've read their main publications and their main philosophers and where they get their philosophies from and their studies and their ideas and who they are, and it's kind of a regurgitation over and over again.
[01:31:57.649 --> 01:32:00.729]  Well, we're not God yet, but we don't want everybody else to have all this power.
[01:32:00.869 --> 01:32:01.810]  We'll blow ourselves up.
[01:32:01.869 --> 01:32:02.649]  Humans are too dangerous.
[01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:07.930]  Let's kill almost everyone, and then we'll bring the technology for ourselves, the chosen ones who deserve it.
[01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.770]  It's the most selfish, crazy crap.
[01:32:11.119 --> 01:32:13.920]  And you know the globalists don't want to just kill 80% of the world population.
[01:32:14.199 --> 01:32:17.159]  When you get deeper in their documents, they're like, well, humans will be gone.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.399]  We're just going to merge the machines.
[01:32:18.539 --> 01:32:24.739]  And there'll probably be two of us, these super beings, that will battle each other finally to decide who is supreme.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.500]  Megalomaniac bullshit.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:31.699]  Your Reich will not last a thousand years, New World Order.
[01:32:32.239 --> 01:32:38.840]  All of you delusions of grandeur megalomaniacs will all drown in your own stew.
[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:46.789]  To quote Thulzidun, they'll all drown in lakes of blood.
[01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:49.270]  Of their own making, not in my hand.
[01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:52.029]  I just don't want to drown in lakes of blood while they're drowning.
[01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:53.510]  I want to go over there and destroy themselves.
[01:32:53.789 --> 01:32:57.250]  I wish they would turn back, but just think, well, you go over there, you're so smart.
[01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.050]  Oh, yes, you're so prideful, so powerful.
[01:33:00.789 --> 01:33:07.710]  The dark side of the Force is a gateway to abilities some would call unnatural.
[01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:09.710]  And look what it turns you into.
[01:33:10.789 --> 01:33:11.449]  You're not powerful.
[01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:12.189]  You're a joke.
[01:33:12.449 --> 01:33:13.449]  The devil's a joke.
[01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:15.449]  The paradigm of the Satan is a joke.
[01:33:16.949 --> 01:33:19.170]  But that's why God allows it to exist.
[01:33:19.369 --> 01:33:21.069]  And you can argue, well, God's a sadist.
[01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:22.050]  No, God gave me free will.
[01:33:22.789 --> 01:33:26.710]  And Satan is there to test the free will.
[01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:32.409]  All right, so let's go ahead and go to the Peanut, who's very sad for Peanut.
[01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:34.369]  Peanut was cute and smart.
[01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:37.729]  I'm sad, really, for the family and the folks.
[01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:40.550]  But I'm really sad for all of us because we're all peanut.
[01:33:40.909 --> 01:33:44.369]  And if the scroll owners don't have rights, we don't have rights.
[01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:47.590]  And it's all just about raw, mindless execution of power.
[01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:49.010]  We'll end with peanut.
[01:33:49.130 --> 01:33:50.369]  Then I'm going to come back with all the other big topics.
[01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:52.090]  And we haven't played anything here.
[01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:53.789]  We haven't played any ads to fund the operation.
[01:33:53.789 --> 01:33:54.569]  That might be important.
[01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:56.970]  Let's play the new Dagger ad.
[01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:57.550]  Here it is.
[01:34:02.489 --> 01:34:06.609]  We just learned that they have euthanized peanut.
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:08.159]  And the raccoon as well.
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.479]  And the raccoon as well.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.619]  I am so sorry.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.500]  This must be really difficult for you.
[01:34:16.699 --> 01:34:22.920]  It not only tears my family apart, but Peanut was the cornerstone of our nonprofit, Animal Rescue.
[01:34:23.699 --> 01:34:28.460]  And 10 to 12 DEC officers raided my house as if I was a drug dealer.
[01:34:28.779 --> 01:34:31.880]  I was sat outside my house for five hours.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:35.180]  I had to get a police escort to my bathroom.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.300]  I wasn't even allowed to feed my rescue horses breakfast or lunch.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:57.579]  I was sat there like a criminal after they interrogated my wife to check out her immigration status, then proceeded to ask me if I had cameras in my house, then proceeded to go through every cabinet nook and cranny of my house for a squirrel and a raccoon.
[01:34:57.739 --> 01:34:59.300]  They got a search warrant?
[01:34:59.479 --> 01:35:01.039]  They got a search warrant.
[01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:07.989]  Four departments and a judge signed off on a search warrant for a squirrel and a raccoon.
[01:35:09.029 --> 01:35:10.850]  And then they took them and killed them.
[01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:20.050]  Why did they go through all that to get a search warrant for an animal that had been with you very safely and the world witnessed this for seven years?
[01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:25.829]  Why now suddenly did they show up with a search warrant and take these animals?
[01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:27.369]  We haven't a clue.
[01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:30.470]  We don't know who made the complaints.
[01:35:30.970 --> 01:35:34.470]  Again, Peanut was an indoor squirrel not harming anybody.
[01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:36.149]  He's been with us for seven years.
[01:35:36.329 --> 01:35:38.810]  Not a single complaint was ever filed for this animal.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.960]  We had him for seven and a half years.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.939]  He became the world's most famous squirrel.
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:45.039]  We weren't hiding him by any means.
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.479]  He was all over TikTok.
[01:35:46.739 --> 01:35:49.659]  He became the first squirrel on TikTok to ever hit a million followers.
[01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:53.000]  He did every news station around the world.
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.640]  He's helped people.
[01:35:55.319 --> 01:35:57.640]  He's helped kids gather joy.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:07.800]  And then we started a non-profit animal rescue called Peanuts Freedom Farm to help animals like Peanuts fight a good fight when they're in a neglected case or they're sitting in a slaughter auction.
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:10.899]  And he was the cornerstone of our life and our organization.
[01:36:11.279 --> 01:36:15.939]  We used his platform to help raise money for the 300 animals we have at our sanctuary.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:27.819]  Peanut was not a convicted murderer from Venezuela, so Peanut had to be killed, and we're sorry about Peanut.
[01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:30.479]  We're really sorry about the 30 million dead from the poison shot.
[01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:37.079]  Speaking of that, we have a new t-shirt at our great sponsor, thealexjohnstore.com, limited edition justice for Peanut.
[01:36:37.979 --> 01:36:44.319]  And when you get the shirt at thealexjonesstore.com or any of the great supplements like Ultimate CMOS and more, you fund the operation.
[01:36:44.319 --> 01:36:54.300]  But if you go to our other great online store that has exclusive stuff only available there, realalexjones.com, you will find it.
[01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:58.810]  Amazing limited edition products that fund the Infowar.
[01:36:58.949 --> 01:37:06.350]  And we're going to show you that here in just a moment and then get back into the news on this live Alex Jones network transmission.
[01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:08.729]  But real Alex Jones, be sure and check that out.
[01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:09.130]  We'll go to that in a moment.
[01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:11.689]  But right now, Justice for Peanut.
[01:37:13.529 --> 01:37:14.289]  That's right.
[01:37:16.369 --> 01:37:20.930]  I'm surprised the Democrats don't have a mugshot for Peanut.
[01:37:22.569 --> 01:37:24.609]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:30.470]  Now, here is a little preview of what is at realalxjones.com.
[01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:44.789]  On November 13th, Infowars, by order of a federal bankruptcy court, goes up for sale.
[01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:49.130]  And the bad guys say they're going to buy it.
[01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:51.189]  The money's not even really the question for me.
[01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:52.170]  The question is...
[01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:56.189]  With your verdict, take Alex Jones' platform away.
[01:37:56.670 --> 01:38:00.390]  Will this suit be successful at stopping him from being on the national stage?
[01:38:00.710 --> 01:38:01.930]  Take him out.
[01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:08.409]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[01:38:08.789 --> 01:38:11.909]  Some good folks are going to try to buy it as well, but we don't know what's going to happen.
[01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:16.970]  But I'm not going to just sit here and roll the dice on the fate of the information war.
[01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:21.750]  Infowars is a lot bigger than just a website or a building or equipment.
[01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:40.470]  It's the listeners, the viewers, the guests, the activists, our crew, the films we've made, the work we've done, the tens of billions of views we've gotten online conservatively, and the admitted fact by the globalists that Infowars launched It was the zenith point for the global revolution we see against the New World Order right now.
[01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:50.630]  And that credit is not to me, it's to the entire InfoWars family, that includes the listeners and viewers, the men and women who aren't spectators but have been in the arena in their support of the broadcast.
[01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:53.289]  So I want to just tell you what's happening right now.
[01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:57.329]  We need to raise funds at realalexjones.com.
[01:38:57.529 --> 01:38:59.550]  It's an amazing online shopping cart.
[01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:07.489]  It's got all the same stuff as at thealexjonesstore.com, but then it's even got more exclusively there, and a lot more is going to be added.
[01:39:09.079 --> 01:39:16.859]  That is a funding mechanism for the new studio, for being able to fund the crew, the satellite uplinks, the legal bills, everything.
[01:39:17.039 --> 01:39:18.920]  It takes money to fight a war.
[01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:29.699]  So the Ultimate CMOS, all the other great supplements, all the great Patriot t-shirts, the limited edition InfoWars shirt, it's all there at realalexjones.com.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:36.100]  And to tell you about the special stuff that's there, limited edition, limited number have been made.
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.800]  I named this the 1776 Devastator.
[01:39:39.939 --> 01:39:45.960]  If you want to know a real knife to defend yourself, and a real knife that's about taking care of business, this is it.
[01:39:46.079 --> 01:39:48.820]  It's got the guard that's Knuckles.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:51.180]  We've got the skull crusher also to break out a windshield.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.520]  You can attack and defend yourself in any direction with this.
[01:39:54.899 --> 01:39:59.180]  This is a World War I updated 2024 trench knife.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:01.239]  This is highly rated.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.319]  This is powerful.
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:05.220]  It's got the Betsy Ross flag on one side, 7076.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.319]  Alex Jones signature on the other side.
[01:40:07.479 --> 01:40:08.779]  This is pure Americana.
[01:40:09.039 --> 01:40:12.880]  Now, there's a limited number of these at realalexjones.com.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.039]  Scabbard, all of it.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:14.880]  It's really amazing.
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:16.840]  And it's a great conversation piece as well.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:29.420]  And then three limited edition posters, printed and made right here in America as well, that, well, one's a fun poster, kind of a Star Wars-esque, you know, maybe for your study or where you play pool or whatever, or your office.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.779]  It's limited edition.
[01:40:30.899 --> 01:40:31.880]  There'll be no more of these printed.
[01:40:31.979 --> 01:40:33.220]  There's the number that's there and that's it.
[01:40:33.579 --> 01:40:42.420]  And then two limited edition InfoWars posters that are very iconic, look great hanging on the wall, and that remind you of the great fight we've been through together.
[01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:46.229]  And whether Infowars survives or not, you know you're funding the future.
[01:40:46.369 --> 01:40:52.130]  And if Infowars does survive, you're helping fund its expansion against all the globalist attacks and attempts to shut us down.
[01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:59.649]  And so one of the classic iconic posters says Infowars lives forever, no matter what the system tries.
[01:40:59.850 --> 01:41:05.829]  And the other says 1776 worldwide, 2024, because this revolution against the globalist is worldwide.
[01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:10.949]  And I want to salute you all for being part of Operation 1776 that I launched just about 20 years ago.
[01:41:11.439 --> 01:41:16.319]  So those are all exclusive items at realalexjones.com.
[01:41:16.819 --> 01:41:18.180]  I cannot do this without you.
[01:41:18.319 --> 01:41:19.079]  They're great items.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.079]  And I just want to thank the Enforge family for all you've done over the years.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.960]  I need your help right now to continue on this fight.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:24.859]  I'm fighting for you.
[01:41:25.079 --> 01:41:25.859]  We're in this together.
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:31.579]  So please visit realalexjones.com and check out these amazing historic mementos.
[01:41:31.739 --> 01:41:36.479]  And from the bottom of my heart, I thank you for your support so we can continue on in the fight against the globalists.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:54.180]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[01:41:54.659 --> 01:41:58.960]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information!
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.960]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[01:42:06.079 --> 01:42:09.340]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.939]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[01:42:12.199 --> 01:42:15.220]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:18.920]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:26.460]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[01:42:26.739 --> 01:42:29.500]  They've declared war on us and we accept them.
[01:42:35.169 --> 01:42:38.909]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:43.050]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[01:42:43.289 --> 01:42:49.750]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:53.649]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:58.109]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:02.550]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:11.260]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank everybody tuned in tonight for this emergency election transmission.
[01:43:13.399 --> 01:43:17.600]  Huge, massive, incredible news just broke.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.600]  Oh, we got to get Trump in there.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:29.380]  On January 20th, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:34.520]  Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss...
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.239]  Neurological Development Disorders and Thyroid Disease.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:48.760]  President at Real Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump want to make America healthy again at Michael P. Conant.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:53.779]  Man, he's that famous toxicologist scientist that we had on many, many years ago.
[01:43:53.899 --> 01:43:54.739]  Is he still alive?
[01:43:54.859 --> 01:43:56.659]  I mean, he was good shape to him at old.
[01:43:56.859 --> 01:43:58.699]  We got to get Michael Conant back on.
[01:43:59.279 --> 01:44:02.819]  Remember, do like 13, 14 years ago, we interviewed him a bunch, got him in studio.
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:06.439]  Wow, Rob is up here working Saturday night right now.
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.239]  So, that is exciting.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.800]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:16.739]  Yeah, federal court rules against EPA in lawsuit over fluoride and water.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:22.840]  That's the feds, that article, in September, telling the...
[01:44:25.079 --> 01:44:27.359]  EPA, who came out and said, we better take it out.
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:29.899]  It's actually lowering IQ and causing cancer at the levels we put it in.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:32.279]  The Fed said, no, it stays in.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:33.899]  So that's the new article.
[01:44:34.079 --> 01:44:36.520]  What we want to put into the search engine is this.
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:46.640]  FDA study says fluoride in water lowers IQ. Here, I'll pull it up.
[01:44:46.859 --> 01:44:48.180]  No problemo.
[01:44:48.659 --> 01:44:50.159]  That's the great part about document cams.
[01:44:50.279 --> 01:44:51.399]  I will get it.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.060]  But this is a big deal.
[01:44:58.579 --> 01:45:00.359]  Let's type in fluoride in water.
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:00.640]  There it is.
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:04.800]  U.S. government reports that fluoride at twice-recommended limits is linked to lower IQs.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:12.159]  Well, they call for it at one level, but the cities put it in at three times the level.
[01:45:12.319 --> 01:45:12.560]  So...
[01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:16.789]  They're putting it in the average water supply higher than what they admit is dangerous.
[01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:19.430]  And of course, none of it's good.
[01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:21.149]  It's hydrofluorosilic acid.
[01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:24.710]  It's not calcium fluoride that you need a little bit of that's good for you.
[01:45:25.069 --> 01:45:28.829]  It is the acid form of poisonous sodium fluoride.
[01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:31.010]  And they knew it back in the 40s when they put it in the water.
[01:45:31.529 --> 01:45:34.550]  But it's all part of a massive conditioning operation.
[01:45:34.810 --> 01:45:38.430]  So, I was just talking about fluoride an hour ago, and now this.
[01:45:39.699 --> 01:45:45.100]  And that's why the globalists, with their foot on our neck, know that this is a real revolution.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.539]  America's the most unhealthy country in the world because of this.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:53.239]  Our sperm counts the lowest in the world because of all this garbage, the diatrazine, all of it.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.000]  And because we've been targeted.
[01:45:55.119 --> 01:45:56.340]  We're the globalist testing ground.
[01:45:56.479 --> 01:45:57.260]  They export it worldwide.
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:58.399]  Oh, look, America does it.
[01:45:58.439 --> 01:45:59.100]  You should do it.
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:02.300]  And then all the other countries are adopting it as well, and they get all the same diseases.
[01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:04.260]  So...
[01:46:05.770 --> 01:46:06.869]  They're hitting on all cylinders.
[01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:08.369]  I know what Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:10.829]  has been criticized by his own anti-vax folks.
[01:46:10.949 --> 01:46:17.369]  You're covering fluoride and you're covering 5G and you're covering GMO and poison.
[01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:18.630]  He's always covered that.
[01:46:18.789 --> 01:46:20.829]  It's all part of the same attack.
[01:46:21.609 --> 01:46:23.550]  All right, let me recap the big news here.
[01:46:23.670 --> 01:46:25.229]  That's why most of you I know are tuned in.
[01:46:25.449 --> 01:46:31.989]  Not to hear me talk about domestication and anthropology and sociology and archetypes.
[01:46:32.989 --> 01:46:41.500]  You see the headline on X? There's several headlines that will be launched on Infowars and on the AJ Network, AJN Live.
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:49.319]  And many sources are saying that the Democrats are already measuring the drapes and they've already stolen the election.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.899]  And they're sure as hell trying and saying that they're going to try to hold it up and not accept Trump in civil war conditions.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:03.000]  And Patrick Byrne, you know, is the main guy that has been talking about that, Patrick Byrne.
[01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:05.810]  And he has great source.
[01:47:05.949 --> 01:47:06.970]  He's always been a great source of info.
[01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:10.989]  I believe him because I've seen Pelosi and others say Trump will not be allowed to be in.
[01:47:11.069 --> 01:47:11.649]  We will stop him.
[01:47:11.729 --> 01:47:13.270]  We'll have all the votes we need after Election Day.
[01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:14.109]  And that they're doing it again.
[01:47:15.130 --> 01:47:16.630]  So yeah, they will try to steal it.
[01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.029]  They've done all these horrible things to Trump.
[01:47:19.829 --> 01:47:23.149]  They are never going to, you know, stop with all of that until we remove them.
[01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:23.949]  This is a death cult.
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.920]  And again, the fraud is massive.
[01:47:27.119 --> 01:47:27.920]  It's everywhere.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:28.880]  This is a revolution.
[01:47:29.079 --> 01:47:30.579]  And we're trying to fix it peacefully.
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.640]  So they've geared up the military and signed the executive orders for martial law and the military to kill us.
[01:47:34.739 --> 01:47:37.840]  And that's all public while they say Trump's going to kill you with the military.
[01:47:38.439 --> 01:47:39.319]  With no evidence.
[01:47:40.319 --> 01:47:47.920]  And then spin some Nancy Pelosi, excuse me, same demon, Liz Cheney comment that Trump made.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.699]  About, hey, she wants war so much she can go face the enemy and all those guns.
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.779]  That's a standard cliche.
[01:47:54.319 --> 01:47:56.340]  You say it, chicken hawk, war hawks.
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.720]  And they go, oh my God, he's going to kill her criminal investigation.
[01:48:03.979 --> 01:48:05.260]  Let me pull up this video.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.819]  I didn't tell the crew to pull this up, so let's see if they can find it.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:08.399]  It's on the list.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:11.659]  Democrats call for violence.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.560]  There's so many compilations of this.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.579]  But it's on the list, I believe.
[01:48:17.579 --> 01:48:25.500]  While we find that, let's go ahead and play the Cardi B clip.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.319]  You know what?
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:28.659]  Let's do clip 23 first.
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:38.460]  Let's do the panda comment because that's really important because it shows how popular the truth is getting.
[01:48:39.199 --> 01:48:54.079]  And this is the former head of the Kennedy campaigner, his VP, Nicole Shanahan, who's a very smart lady, big tech guru, talking about panda eyes.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:02.500]  And that's a pedophile signal for torturing kids and black eyeshadow all around a kid's eyes, dripping, and then panda bears on the bed.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:04.159]  That's known in the FBI files.
[01:49:04.399 --> 01:49:08.060]  And it's a public thing that that means you're a pedophile or a kid that's been abused.
[01:49:08.279 --> 01:49:17.500]  And if a kid's got a panda on them, Or, you know, kids got a, you know, younger, has a, like a sticker on them at the pool.
[01:49:17.659 --> 01:49:22.239]  It doesn't always mean that because kids regularly do it, you know, of a Mickey Mouse.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.819]  And of course, they use pizza and they use all these codes.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:26.859]  That's in the FBI files.
[01:49:27.319 --> 01:49:28.479]  Oh, Pizza Gate doesn't exist.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.060]  No, that's what they're talking about.
[01:49:30.819 --> 01:49:31.199]  So...
[01:49:32.369 --> 01:49:43.850]  Here she is talking about this in front of a crowd of 20,000, 30,000 people at a Trump rally when it went mega viral with Joe Biden.
[01:49:45.329 --> 01:49:49.130]  And you've got Joe Biden with Jill Biden dressed up like a panda bear.
[01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:50.550]  And maybe it was innocent.
[01:49:50.989 --> 01:49:53.829]  It's just that Joe Biden is a known pedophile.
[01:49:53.989 --> 01:49:55.489]  It's in his daughter's diary, all of it.
[01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:56.930]  He's biting on kids' feet.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:58.800]  At the same event.
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.699]  So the guy is a total and complete freakazoid.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.220]  Here's the clip.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:08.340]  The parading of Jill Biden in a panda suit yesterday.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.359]  Right in front of our eyes.
[01:50:12.319 --> 01:50:15.399]  What the hell is this mockery?
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.119]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[01:50:20.659 --> 01:50:23.479]  And we know what they're doing.
[01:50:23.739 --> 01:50:24.899]  They know what they're doing.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:28.359]  And they're trying to just taunt us But it's not working.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:31.979]  We are going to continue peacefully to expose these monsters.
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:41.560]  And no amount of Cardi B's and other P. Diddy folks is going to convince people to go to the establishment.
[01:50:41.779 --> 01:50:44.939]  So here's Cardi B at a Harris rally.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.859]  And they love doing these bait and switches.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.060]  People are supposedly going to show up to sing and then they don't.
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:51.479]  And then people boo and leave.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.020]  And then the teleprompter goes out.
[01:50:55.079 --> 01:50:56.420]  And so she's unable to talk.
[01:50:56.819 --> 01:50:59.479]  These are actors, actresses, musicians.
[01:50:59.739 --> 01:51:02.340]  I'm not saying all musicians are bad, but this is what they do.
[01:51:02.439 --> 01:51:04.800]  They read and say what they're told.
[01:51:04.939 --> 01:51:06.359]  They play the music they're told to play.
[01:51:07.039 --> 01:51:08.119]  These are not leaders.
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.260]  These are repeaters.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:11.880]  These are teleprompter readers.
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.079]  Just like me.
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.420]  Without a teleprompter, I can't talk.
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.420]  My God, I'd have to shut up immediately.
[01:51:19.159 --> 01:51:20.300]  Actually, I can't shut up.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:22.060]  Anyways, go ahead and play the clip.
[01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:25.550]  I believe in every word that comes out of her mouth.
[01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:32.670]  She's passionate, she's compassionate, she shows empathy, and most of all, she is not delusional.
[01:51:33.949 --> 01:51:34.510]  Yeah.
[01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:37.050]  Yeah.
[01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:46.369]  Kamala recognized that this country is at risk, that the economy needs to get stronger, that the cost of food and the cost of living is too high.
[01:51:46.630 --> 01:51:48.170]  Damn, it's even high for me!
[01:51:51.319 --> 01:51:57.319]  I believe her when she says, under her, buying eggs and milk won't break the bank.
[01:51:57.939 --> 01:52:01.680]  Because she's gonna pass a ban on price cards and on groceries.
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.460]  And she told me that in my face.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:07.680]  So she better not lie to me in my face.
[01:52:12.079 --> 01:52:12.840]  And this happens.
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:15.800]  I always send the crew way more clips than I ever play.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.399]  I send them like 100 today.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:18.060]  Poor crew.
[01:52:18.579 --> 01:52:20.220]  And they got to download them and get them ready.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.659]  And so maybe I send them a page that had multiple clips and they got the wrong one.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.300]  It is even worse.
[01:52:25.619 --> 01:52:29.939]  The teleprompter breaks and she sits there for like a minute going, hey, I can't talk.
[01:52:30.039 --> 01:52:30.960]  The thing.
[01:52:31.159 --> 01:52:32.380]  And she's going, the thing.
[01:52:32.739 --> 01:52:33.520]  The thing.
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:35.300]  Like the plane.
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:36.000]  The plane.
[01:52:36.199 --> 01:52:38.340]  Like the midget in the...
[01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:41.750]  Fantasy Island, I guess I'm dating myself.
[01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:43.649]  Ricardo Autobahn.
[01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:48.189]  And then they just give her a phone and she reads off that.
[01:52:48.529 --> 01:52:50.729]  But there's something bigger in this.
[01:52:50.869 --> 01:52:53.210]  It's like Easter eggs or Russian dolls.
[01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:54.409]  It just builds on itself.
[01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.949]  Did you hear?
[01:52:59.850 --> 01:53:06.750]  Kamala promised me to my face that she gonna put controls on the prices so it's not gonna be expensive anymore.
[01:53:07.979 --> 01:53:10.779]  So Kamala just admitted price controls again.
[01:53:10.899 --> 01:53:12.220]  She's been telling people again.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:23.239]  Remember, she got discredited, but she still say it on TV. I can put price controls like Venezuela or Russia on the thing, and then you won't have to.
[01:53:23.479 --> 01:53:25.239]  You will be cheap now.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:26.859]  Yeah, that's why you have it.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.539]  Department through my feet.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.340]  Isn't that great?
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:37.560]  There's another video of her.
[01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:40.180]  You know what?
[01:53:40.539 --> 01:53:41.680]  This is not on radio.
[01:53:42.159 --> 01:53:42.359]  I don't know.
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:43.960]  Some stages may be picking it up, but we're not.
[01:53:44.079 --> 01:53:45.920]  We haven't hooked this network to radio and TV feeds yet.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.220]  We're putting equipment in a couple days.
[01:53:48.619 --> 01:53:50.539]  But I couldn't air this clip normally.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.840]  I said, go to X and get it.
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:54.680]  It's on the Real Alex Jones.
[01:53:55.399 --> 01:53:56.979]  I made the comment on it.
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:59.100]  I said, Kamala has trained her well.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:01.539]  We're going to play this clip.
[01:54:02.979 --> 01:54:08.039]  Because all I'm saying is, this is a low-grade moron right here.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.819]  And she's on there going...
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.500]  It's hilarious.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:17.720]  I shouldn't laugh at this lady.
[01:54:20.199 --> 01:54:22.060]  Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:33.760]  But, but, and, and if you look at that crowd of people, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, they're all just dumber than hell.
[01:54:33.939 --> 01:54:36.880]  And the globalists even say, yeah, we'll rob and kill these people.
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:42.689]  I'm like, no, we'll, Give you a rubber helmet and, you know, let you go out to pasture or whatever.
[01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:43.710]  But, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:44.109]  Okay.
[01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.989]  We'll play this in a minute.
[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:50.090]  But first, play the clip that I saw, the one I thought I sent.
[01:54:50.949 --> 01:54:53.010]  Why they give her a phone to read off of it.
[01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:57.909]  Because she can't talk without the teleprompter, so then they run over and give her the phone.
[01:54:57.989 --> 01:54:59.250]  So here's the larger clip.
[01:54:59.289 --> 01:54:59.630]  Here it is.
[01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:05.729]  One second, guys.
[01:55:05.789 --> 01:55:06.529]  One second.
[01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.950]  Okay.
[01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:24.250]  So I don't take lightly the call.
[01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:27.649]  Sorry, guys.
[01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:28.430]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:55:29.710 --> 01:55:31.189]  I'm a little nervous, guys.
[01:55:31.630 --> 01:55:33.970]  I've been waiting for this moment this whole life.
[01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:35.069]  My whole life.
[01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:36.670]  Why don't we make her president?
[01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:38.470]  Looks like she's a little bit smarter than Kamala.
[01:55:39.810 --> 01:55:42.050]  Or we can make that chick from North Carolina.
[01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:43.090]  Remember that blonde?
[01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:44.369]  Hey, find the dumb blonde, too.
[01:55:44.409 --> 01:55:44.829]  We'll play her.
[01:55:48.079 --> 01:55:50.460]  I need patience over here!
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.840]  I mean, she is...
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.579]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:55:58.619 --> 01:55:59.680]  How you guys doing tonight?
[01:56:01.239 --> 01:56:06.359]  Man, she's not an ugly woman, but she is so gross to me because she's so stupid.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.199]  I'd rather go with an ugly woman who's smart than a...
[01:56:11.199 --> 01:56:12.840]  Can you imagine being with this idiot?
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:15.119]  Having a kid with her?
[01:56:15.199 --> 01:56:16.140]  How dumb your kid would be?
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:21.659]  Because we're going to make sure we have Kamala Harris in office for a year.
[01:56:23.779 --> 01:56:24.539]  Thank you.
[01:56:24.739 --> 01:56:26.199]  Who's just been in power for four years.
[01:56:26.399 --> 01:56:28.779]  I believe in every word that comes out of her mouth.
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.119]  She's passionate.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:31.100]  She's compassionate.
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:31.560]  All right, just stop.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.079]  That's enough.
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:32.619]  Thank you.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:35.460]  Okay, this is a vulgar clip.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.359]  And I don't play it just because it's vulgar.
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:45.399]  It shows you that this woman does not know what planet she is on.
[01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:52.229]  You talk about low-information voter, I mean, this lady is it.
[01:56:53.449 --> 01:56:59.289]  And it's fitting that she's the spokesperson for Kamala, because obviously they've both been in the same line of work.
[01:56:59.369 --> 01:57:02.569]  Which I'm not putting down, you know, ladies of the night.
[01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:07.710]  But the point is, they're not just...
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:09.560]  Whores, sexually.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.319]  They're whores to the New World Order that want to whore me and my family out.
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.119]  Or they want to pimp me, actually.
[01:57:14.359 --> 01:57:15.539]  She wants to be my pimp.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:16.659]  Control my life.
[01:57:17.039 --> 01:57:17.859]  Listen, dumbass.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:18.659]  You're not going to do that.
[01:57:21.039 --> 01:57:21.920]  Hey, dumbass.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:26.239]  Every time there's price controls, there's no food, you stupid idiot.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:30.100]  The food doesn't cost more money because they're ripping you off.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:38.579]  It's because of inflation, because of deindustrialization and the energy being too much and printing too much money, dumbass!
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:39.939]  Dumbass!
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.960]  You dumb moron!
[01:57:44.479 --> 01:57:46.039]  Now listen to her.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.659]  And I guess at the end of the day, this is kind of a...
[01:57:50.609 --> 01:57:51.869]  It is a good tip, though.
[01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:55.489]  I mean, it is true, ladies.
[01:57:55.810 --> 01:57:58.510]  You do need to brush your teeth more.
[01:57:58.989 --> 01:58:00.029]  I guess we all do.
[01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:00.550]  Here it is.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:03.659]  So y'all can keep y'all pussy on WAP. You know what I'm saying?
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.399]  A lot of you bitches got to dab dry ass pussy because y'all pH balance is off.
[01:58:07.479 --> 01:58:08.220]  And you wanna know why?
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.600]  It's not because you born with it.
[01:58:09.659 --> 01:58:12.060]  It's because y'all keep fucking these dirty ass niggas.
[01:58:12.159 --> 01:58:15.100]  And y'all bitches is shy to tell these niggas that they dick is hot.
[01:58:15.279 --> 01:58:18.340]  You gotta tell, babe, yo, your dick smell like mustard, my nigga.
[01:58:18.439 --> 01:58:19.840]  You wanna throw my pH balance off.
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:22.100]  Y'all bitches be fucking these little dirty ass niggas.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.659]  Y'all be sucking they dick and shit.
[01:58:23.939 --> 01:58:25.079]  Y'all be gagging on it.
[01:58:25.159 --> 01:58:27.039]  Y'all think y'all gagging on it because the dick is big.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:28.920]  But no, bitch, it's because it stinks.
[01:58:29.199 --> 01:58:35.460]  Another thing is, right, why your pH balance is throwing off, because y'all bitches need to fucking brush y'all teeth before you suck dick.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:44.960]  Y'all eating barbecue ribs the whole day, bacon, egg, and cheese, then you suck your nigga dick, and right after, he directly put it inside your pussy, now you got bacon, egg, and cheese grease inside your pussy.
[01:58:45.039 --> 01:58:45.520]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:50.359]  I'm only giving y'all this advice because I love you, and you don't want to take advice, I ain't them, bitch.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.060]  Roll the dice and keep walking around with that dehydrated pussy.
[01:58:53.319 --> 01:58:57.239]  Like I said, I love y'all, and this is for y'all to keep the walk.
[01:59:02.010 --> 01:59:06.229]  And by the way, she did, at the Kamala Harris thing, talk about her fat pussy.
[01:59:06.789 --> 01:59:08.130]  So that's good for kids.
[01:59:08.329 --> 01:59:10.250]  I mean, actually, better than Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:59:10.529 --> 01:59:14.630]  I mean, maybe they should make her the head of Health and Human Services instead of Admiral Levine.
[01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:16.989]  At least she won't promote pedophilia, right?
[01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:18.050]  And here's the deal.
[01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:19.930]  What she told women is true.
[01:59:19.949 --> 01:59:21.590]  So she'd give them a little hygiene help.
[01:59:22.829 --> 01:59:23.229]  So...
[01:59:24.769 --> 01:59:28.489]  So she understands that you don't want to shove bacon and eggs in your pussy.
[01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:32.550]  But that's not healthy, folks.
[01:59:33.489 --> 01:59:37.829]  Of course, you also don't want to cut little boys' penises off and say they're girls, too.
[01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:38.829]  That's probably a little worse, right?
[01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:43.729]  But she doesn't understand that...
[01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:49.810]  When Biden blamed gas stations when he first got in and gas prices doubled, oh, the gas stations, they're ripping you off.
[01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:54.930]  Anybody that knows anything knows gas stations on average make no money and break even or lose money.
[01:59:55.090 --> 01:59:57.630]  On average, they break even on gas.
[01:59:57.930 --> 02:00:00.750]  They make money off of the stuff inside the store.
[02:00:01.590 --> 02:00:08.890]  The milk, the eggs, the ice cream, the lottery tickets, the cigarettes, the energy drinks, the Snickers bars.
[02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:09.470]  I'm getting hungry.
[02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:12.189]  But I guess...
[02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:13.050]  I'm sorry.
[02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:14.289]  I guess I just...
[02:00:14.289 --> 02:00:16.569]  I mean, I live in the real world.
[02:00:16.670 --> 02:00:17.390]  I actually know how things work.
[02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:17.649]  Sorry.
[02:00:18.949 --> 02:00:23.869]  You know, like when you pull up to charge your electric car and there's a big fence around diesel generators.
[02:00:25.869 --> 02:00:27.329]  Oh my God, you people.
[02:00:27.529 --> 02:00:27.729]  What's...
[02:00:27.729 --> 02:00:29.810]  Diesel generator, baby!
[02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:31.170]  That fit my pussy!
[02:00:35.329 --> 02:00:36.289]  We got a woman...
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:38.680]  Don't you promise me?
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.060]  I can't even do the voice.
[02:00:41.239 --> 02:00:45.979]  It's like, she gonna make the, that doesn't cost money no more.
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:47.020]  I can't even do her voice.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.680]  This one, this one is just as entertaining.
[02:00:50.979 --> 02:01:01.039]  And again, all the women in my family, like my grandmothers and my mother, know more history and are better spoken than I am.
[02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:03.250]  I mean, super smart.
[02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:09.949]  So it's not that women are dumb, but when women grow up around idiots and then they just soak it up, they become these people.
[02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:12.449]  And quite frankly, hey, women voting, great.
[02:01:13.050 --> 02:01:16.810]  But at a certain point, the smart women are going to join with the men.
[02:01:16.909 --> 02:01:17.850]  There's plenty of dumb men, too.
[02:01:18.010 --> 02:01:21.289]  But statistically, I mean, women vote for their own enslavement.
[02:01:21.369 --> 02:01:22.569]  And it's a survival mechanism.
[02:01:23.930 --> 02:01:24.989]  It's Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:32.149]  So, all I'm saying is, do you want women voting if they're like Cardi B and this lady?
[02:01:32.449 --> 02:01:33.069]  I can see the headline.
[02:01:33.369 --> 02:01:35.170]  Jones asked if women should be allowed to vote.
[02:01:36.329 --> 02:01:38.710]  Yeah, I don't think Kamala Harris should be able to vote.
[02:01:38.710 --> 02:01:39.529]  She's a vegetable.
[02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:45.329]  I mean, do we let seriously mentally retarded people fly airplanes?
[02:01:45.789 --> 02:01:48.649]  I guess, actually, the airlines are saying they're going to hire mentally retarded people to fly.
[02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:50.289]  All right, I'm politically correct.
[02:01:50.409 --> 02:01:51.829]  I want mentally retarded people to fly airplanes.
[02:01:52.819 --> 02:01:53.340]  SpaceX.
[02:01:53.739 --> 02:02:01.399]  I think they ought to fire Elon Musk and I think they ought to put Cardi B in over the rockets along with Kamala Harris.
[02:02:03.119 --> 02:02:04.220]  Oh my God.
[02:02:04.859 --> 02:02:05.920]  Oh my God.
[02:02:06.899 --> 02:02:11.800]  You know what Cardi B's thinking about when she sees the Falcon Heavy landing that big, big hand grab it?
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:16.840]  I've got to stop right now.
[02:02:18.039 --> 02:02:20.140]  Oh my God, what have we become?
[02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:24.689]  Go ahead and play.
[02:02:24.789 --> 02:02:25.250]  Here she is.
[02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:40.930]  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps.
[02:02:40.930 --> 02:02:56.039]  And I believe that our education, such as South Africa and Iraq, everywhere such as, and I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S.,
[02:02:56.039 --> 02:03:04.420]  or should help South Africa, and should help Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future for our children.
[02:03:04.859 --> 02:03:06.600]  Thank you very much, South Carolina.
[02:03:12.039 --> 02:03:17.180]  So, let's say you got 140 IQ, you have a kid with her, it's going to have about 80.
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:20.680]  So, not attractive to me.
[02:03:21.119 --> 02:03:22.239]  Not attractive at all.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:23.220]  In fact, she's ugly.
[02:03:23.859 --> 02:03:25.220]  And I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:27.479]  But man, I can see some woman.
[02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:30.810]  Who doesn't even have classically good-looking features.
[02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:33.529]  And they're smart.
[02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:34.630]  I think it's sexy.
[02:03:34.869 --> 02:03:38.210]  Now, they gotta have the junk in the trunk.
[02:03:38.409 --> 02:03:39.770]  I mean, you know, let's get down to business here.
[02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:46.590]  But the point is, is that I'd rather have an ugly woman in the face than be within 100 yards of those women.
[02:03:46.770 --> 02:03:50.229]  They are disgusting because their brains are ugly.
[02:03:51.210 --> 02:03:51.649]  Disgusting.
[02:03:51.930 --> 02:03:53.630]  There's nothing worse than an ugly brain.
[02:03:55.569 --> 02:03:56.170]  All right.
[02:04:01.619 --> 02:04:04.619]  Are you ready for the Democrats to steal the election?
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.180]  It's going on right now.
[02:04:08.939 --> 02:04:10.760]  And it's going to only get worse for them.
[02:04:11.039 --> 02:04:14.100]  But it doesn't matter because they're so evil and stupid they don't even realize it.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.159]  So their reign of terror is just getting started.
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:27.399]  And I should just be more of a comedian and just kind of be the court jester and just kind of be the commentary on the collapse of civilization.
[02:04:28.619 --> 02:04:33.199]  But I do care about the children, so I occasionally become like this, and I'm sorry.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:37.279]  This is why I started doing only daytime shows.
[02:04:38.319 --> 02:04:43.140]  Because at night, I start becoming a little more bad.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:45.640]  I don't know why, it's just the way it is.
[02:04:45.779 --> 02:04:46.760]  It's always been that way.
[02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:49.039]  Now to see me at midnight.
[02:04:51.989 --> 02:04:52.569]  Red eyes.
[02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.789]  I'm joking.
[02:04:54.829 --> 02:04:55.430]  I'm not Joe Biden.
[02:04:57.250 --> 02:05:09.310]  I'm not happy about what's happening, but at a certain point, I mean, Cardi B, Kamala promised me that it's going to be cheap now because she made the price low.
[02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:12.409]  Remember, Kamala was asked, how are you going to lower the prices?
[02:05:12.590 --> 02:05:14.489]  I'm going to order them to lower the prices.
[02:05:15.489 --> 02:05:16.770]  That's a really smart guy.
[02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:27.560]  I order you I order you to get an ounce of gold out of a mountain for cheap.
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:31.600]  And the companies just go, well then hire somebody else to do it because we can't.
[02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:44.119]  I mean, if you look at industrial level production farms and stuff, they're all operating on like 30% margins and then they pay all these bills and stuff.
[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.220]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:05:47.079 --> 02:06:02.289]  And The fact that these people don't know that stuff costs more because Biden and them cut off most of the energy and increased spending, and that if you don't have cheap energy,
[02:06:02.289 --> 02:06:09.390]  you're going to have a bad economy, and then you add inflationary spending and money printing on top of not having enough energy?
[02:06:09.590 --> 02:06:10.850]  Baby, you're screwed!
[02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:14.859]  Let me explain something to Cardi B. Cupcake.
[02:06:15.539 --> 02:06:23.840]  If energy on average costs twice as much as it did four years ago, what do you think plows the fields that create the grain that feeds the chickens?
[02:06:24.039 --> 02:06:25.960]  What do you think heats the chicken coops?
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:27.899]  What do you think pays for the electricity?
[02:06:28.159 --> 02:06:29.979]  What do you think pays to get them butchered?
[02:06:30.119 --> 02:06:31.739]  What do you think pays to get them packaged?
[02:06:31.939 --> 02:06:33.439]  What do you think pays to get them shipped?
[02:06:33.659 --> 02:06:42.000]  What do you think runs the grocery store that has the lights and the bills and how people get to the grocery store and how the trucks get to the grocery store and how all of that is done?
[02:06:42.779 --> 02:06:43.859]  That's just a few of the steps.
[02:06:44.079 --> 02:06:46.659]  It's called energy, dumbass!
[02:06:47.199 --> 02:06:53.880]  And if there's less energy, it then costs more, and then that makes the prices go up, sweetheart!
[02:06:55.479 --> 02:06:58.680]  So you got everything figured out, how to have a big old juicy pussy.
[02:06:59.079 --> 02:07:01.460]  And people might be saying, that's not a good kid's show.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:07.899]  Well, hell, she's in front of the Democrats, but Kamala Harris literally saying two days ago, I got a big old juicy pussy, everybody!
[02:07:08.439 --> 02:07:09.699]  Whoa, juicy pussy!
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:10.699]  Juicy pussy!
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.939]  Okay, so if you can figure out how to have a big old juicy pussy...
[02:07:15.449 --> 02:07:17.430]  And keep your engine running clean, sweetheart.
[02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:25.289]  If you can figure out that, then you sure as hell can figure out cutting the goddamn energy off of the people isn't just going to raise prices.
[02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:29.430]  It's starving hundreds of millions of people to death in the third world, you dumb witch.
[02:07:29.590 --> 02:07:35.170]  And now they're getting organized by the UN as refugees to come up here and collapse us, you dumb fat ass.
[02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:43.810]  Now, tell me more about your big juicy pussy.
[02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:47.250]  Headline, Jones attacks.
[02:07:47.609 --> 02:07:50.189]  Democrat female talking about her pussy.
[02:07:50.909 --> 02:07:52.529]  Misogynistic attack on the pussy.
[02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:56.310]  You're the one talking about your goddamn pussy in front of kids!
[02:07:58.590 --> 02:07:59.550]  But I can't wait.
[02:07:59.670 --> 02:08:00.609]  Throw me in the briar patch.
[02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:03.289]  Jones, he's being investigated.
[02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:04.109]  It might have been a threat.
[02:08:04.369 --> 02:08:07.229]  He said put her pussy up in front of a firing squad.
[02:08:07.489 --> 02:08:08.630]  Oh no, that's Trump.
[02:08:08.850 --> 02:08:10.630]  Oh yeah, that's Liz Cheney.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.279]  Speaking of Liz Cheney, I don't think she's got a big old juicy pussy.
[02:08:15.939 --> 02:08:17.819]  Probably got cobwebs all over it.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:22.140]  Probably got the spirits of dead soldiers and dead Iraqi kids probably live in it.
[02:08:22.319 --> 02:08:23.680]  In fact, that's probably the entrance to hell.
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:28.479]  No, Trump didn't say put her in front of a fire squad.
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:33.140]  He said let her go over and fight and face all that death instead of our troops.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:36.380]  The cliche, you war hawks, you go fight the fucking war.
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:37.779]  All right, I'm done.
[02:08:40.449 --> 02:08:41.470]  But I warned everybody.
[02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:43.449]  I've been trying to behave myself.
[02:08:44.409 --> 02:08:45.909]  I've been working on it.
[02:08:46.289 --> 02:08:48.050]  And I've been working on it.
[02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:53.350]  But you know what?
[02:08:55.289 --> 02:08:56.449]  I'm not going to be nice.
[02:08:56.829 --> 02:09:02.130]  All right.
[02:09:02.289 --> 02:09:03.289]  We're going to end this transmission.
[02:09:03.489 --> 02:09:04.510]  Great job to the crew.
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:13.119]  They've been really busy on top of all the work and election coverage and all the attempted shutdowns and our crew cut down and all the attacks.
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:15.399]  I need to be able to continue on.
[02:09:15.979 --> 02:09:17.319]  They need to continue on.
[02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:19.140]  We need funds to prosecute the war.
[02:09:19.239 --> 02:09:20.739]  We make it damn easy with great products.
[02:09:22.399 --> 02:09:26.979]  And so our products will not give you a big juicy pussy.
[02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:30.649]  Well, actually, hydroforce will.
[02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:32.729]  I'm going to tell Cardi B something.
[02:09:32.970 --> 02:09:37.250]  You need hydroforce with all of the highest quality electrolytes and vitamins and minerals.
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:50.239]  We're good to go.
[02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:02.189]  Super hot thing.
[02:10:02.329 --> 02:10:03.369]  We private label it.
[02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:04.930]  One of the top companies in the nation.
[02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:08.409]  So when you get Ultimate Seamoss, it's an amazing superfood.
[02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:14.270]  And it's good for all of your glands and all of your body and your immune system and everything.
[02:10:14.649 --> 02:10:24.289]  Your brain cells, your eyes, your intestines, just your skin and other parts.
[02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:35.500]  So that's my message to Cardi B. Cardi B, you need Ultimate CMOS, and you need HydroForce, and you need Gut Cleanse, and you need probiotics.
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:41.779]  While you're eating all that stuff, you were talking about the ribs and the macaroni and everything else.
[02:10:41.899 --> 02:10:42.560]  I hear you, I'm getting hungry.
[02:10:42.899 --> 02:10:48.039]  Well, that's what you got your probiotic for, to help make sure a little good bacteria, help process.
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:49.640]  You're like, bacteria in my gut?
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:50.819]  No, you're actually probably pretty smart.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.420]  You probably know about that.
[02:10:51.479 --> 02:10:52.720]  You were telling other girls about stuff.
[02:10:53.119 --> 02:11:08.420]  So, it's all available, everything for Cardi B. Everything from Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney, all you girls that want to be healthy, you don't want to take those COVID shots, you don't want to drink that fluoride,
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:13.119]  you want to listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you want to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:11:13.319 --> 02:11:15.020]  And I'm going to end this transmission here.
[02:11:16.689 --> 02:11:18.170]  And I'm going to be serious tomorrow, I promise.
[02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:22.470]  I was serious the first hour, and then I just am commercial-free in here.
[02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:23.470]  And kind of the Mr.
[02:11:23.590 --> 02:11:24.609]  Hyde comes out sometimes.
[02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:27.689]  This is just a little small edge of Mr.
[02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.909]  Hyde.
[02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:30.130]  You look over the little eyes, kind of look around the edge.
[02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.850]  Something's looking at me.
[02:11:31.930 --> 02:11:33.210]  Oh, here comes the whole thing around there.
[02:11:33.329 --> 02:11:34.510]  Oh, kind of bad.
[02:11:35.369 --> 02:11:39.270]  So, it's like in that Twilight Zone movie remake they did.
[02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:40.270]  They go, you want to see something scary?
[02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:42.729]  Who is that?
[02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:44.069]  Dan Aykroyd.
[02:11:44.449 --> 02:11:45.149]  I'll show you something scary.
[02:11:46.829 --> 02:11:49.310]  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden biting kids' feet.
[02:11:49.689 --> 02:11:51.609]  So, yeah, the craziness has made me go crazy.
[02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:53.930]  Of course, the last 10 minutes was satire.
[02:11:55.489 --> 02:12:01.489]  Cardi B's parts were not hurt in the production of this, and we wish her well.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.100]  All right, let's go ahead and go out with some very important announcements here.
[02:12:07.199 --> 02:12:14.760]  Let's play clip Y and T and then DMO. Y, T, and then it's a new offer, by the way, on knives.
[02:12:15.079 --> 02:12:23.800]  The DMO knife is like a top collectible knife company, and they only put out one knife at a time, and they put us one out four or five months ago.
[02:12:23.859 --> 02:12:25.979]  They put out new limited editions, only a few hundred of these.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:32.380]  And it's not out until Election Day, but you can get on the email to be given an alert the minute they go up for sale.
[02:12:32.579 --> 02:12:34.539]  And that's dmonives.com.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:36.619]  And here it is right here.
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.439]  This is the Outback.
[02:12:40.659 --> 02:12:41.640]  It's the Breacher.
[02:12:41.939 --> 02:12:44.880]  It's highest quality steel, highest quality production, super sharp.
[02:12:44.979 --> 02:12:50.439]  This is a super high-grade knife, and it funds the info war at dmonives.com.
[02:12:52.289 --> 02:12:56.229]  And so we'll put that URL up when that ad plays after all the others.
[02:12:56.390 --> 02:13:06.029]  But let's go ahead and go to the contest situation, the CMOS, so Cardi B can learn more about that, and Superfood, and then the Outback, and then that's it for this transmission.
[02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:16.229]  And if you want the super serious stuff, it's in the first hour with all the election fraud, and are they really stealing it, and is Kamala already measuring the drapes, and is Obama running her campaign?
[02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.810]  That's admitted.
[02:13:17.369 --> 02:13:32.909]  And yeah, they're trying to steal it, and they think they will, and they're going to try to cause the Civil War to stay in, even if it's so overpowering, and Crump had such a big landslide, and now it's all come out, they've got illegal aliens voting, and it's all confirmed, and just mass hacking and fraud, just more fake ballots in Michigan than real ballots, and it's just all completely cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[02:13:33.610 --> 02:13:37.630]  But the media said you're not allowed to talk about it, so all these other Fox and stuff barely talk about it.
[02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:39.050]  But on the local news, it's like, oh!
[02:13:39.529 --> 02:13:45.270]  And the Secretary of State gets up and goes, yeah, all the machines, you know, all over the country, they're having big problems with this company.
[02:13:45.449 --> 02:13:48.649]  And yeah, there are more votes than there are fake ones than there are real ones.
[02:13:48.710 --> 02:13:50.670]  And yeah, there's more people in the voter rolls than there are voters.
[02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:51.930]  And it's just, well, it's all fun.
[02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:52.489]  Everything's great.
[02:13:52.810 --> 02:13:54.050]  And bull ride's good for you.
[02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:55.069]  And GMO's good for you.
[02:13:55.289 --> 02:13:56.369]  And world government's good for you.
[02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:57.050]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:13:58.990 --> 02:14:06.369]  So, but the good news is, Trump has pledged to take the poison floor out of the water, and that is a big victory.
[02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:10.689]  But it's kind of been stabbing us with that for 80 years.
[02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:14.050]  And then they're like, okay, oh God, we'll stop doing that.
[02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:18.630]  And then while they're beating us over the head with all the other poisons and crap they're hitting us with.
[02:14:19.090 --> 02:14:22.029]  All right, fabulous superlative job for the crew.
[02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:33.489]  And please follow us on the AJ Network, AJN Live on X. Oh, we're going to have total election coverage and info wars.
[02:14:33.609 --> 02:14:35.449]  Isn't it great they didn't shut us down before the election?
[02:14:35.630 --> 02:14:36.470]  Well, they're really pissed off.
[02:14:36.550 --> 02:14:39.670]  We're going to be on with live coverage, all these huge guests, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[02:14:39.869 --> 02:14:41.810]  I think it's going to be contested and going for a long time.
[02:14:41.989 --> 02:14:43.210]  Certainly the Democrats have their way.
[02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:45.810]  So we're just going to be on until the 13th.
[02:14:45.970 --> 02:14:49.470]  And if bad guys sell it, the people that want to buy it that are bad have said, can we have it?
[02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:50.550]  Can we have it instantly?
[02:14:50.829 --> 02:14:51.810]  Can we have it as soon?
[02:14:51.890 --> 02:14:55.149]  And they said, yes, as soon as your wire clears, you can turn him off.
[02:14:55.630 --> 02:14:57.750]  And those go, oh, oh, how?
[02:15:00.690 --> 02:15:01.609]  Oh, God!
[02:15:01.829 --> 02:15:02.470]  Help me!
[02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:05.989]  Anakin will tell you the Jedi to hang over!
[02:15:06.369 --> 02:15:06.869]  I'm too weak!
[02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:08.949]  Anakin, he's going to kill me!
[02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.789]  Help!
[02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:10.130]  Help!
[02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.989]  Power!
[02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:13.250]  Unlimited power!
[02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:14.550]  Sorry.
[02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:22.109]  Truth is, we win one way or another now.
[02:15:22.289 --> 02:15:23.229]  We've blown them worldwide.
[02:15:23.369 --> 02:15:24.170]  Populism has exploded.
[02:15:24.329 --> 02:15:27.010]  Unless they start World War III and kill the surface of the Earth, we have won.
[02:15:27.149 --> 02:15:28.090]  I've passed the Rubicon.
[02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:29.670]  I know it in my gut and my cells.
[02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:32.250]  So, however it matters.
[02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.850]  It doesn't matter.
[02:15:32.989 --> 02:15:33.430]  They're done.
[02:15:33.550 --> 02:15:33.930]  They're over.
[02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:35.069]  They served Satan.
[02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:36.090]  They've already been defeated.
[02:15:37.289 --> 02:15:37.890]  All right.
[02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:40.090]  I'll see you tomorrow night with a serious transmission.
[02:15:40.090 --> 02:15:40.750]  Completely serious.
[02:15:40.869 --> 02:15:43.270]  The first episode is serious at 4 p.m.
[02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:43.510]  Central.
[02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:47.149]  From the Embattled Infowars Studios tomorrow night.
[02:15:47.329 --> 02:15:53.010]  But from the fledgling launch of the Alex Jones Network Studios.
[02:15:53.689 --> 02:15:54.229]  Bye-bye.
[02:15:54.449 --> 02:15:55.270]  Good luck, my friends.
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:00.100]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:06.659]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, yellowshownstore.com.
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:20.399]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, and I, because I hadn't really, you know, there's other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, J6ers, you name it.
[02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:23.630]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:27.609]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[02:16:28.270 --> 02:16:38.569]  So, if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alishonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[02:16:39.219 --> 02:16:41.600]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:46.040]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[02:16:46.159 --> 02:16:49.399]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.100]  Monthly member credits.
[02:16:51.459 --> 02:16:56.799]  Every month as a VIP member you get $40 of free store credit.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:58.219]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:16:58.680]  That's right.
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:02.559]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[02:17:02.969 --> 02:17:06.889]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.
[02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.989]  That's $10 you make.
[02:17:08.209 --> 02:17:19.489]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[02:17:19.930 --> 02:17:23.530]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[02:17:24.049 --> 02:17:30.889]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value.
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.680]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced on the 30th this month.
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:36.680]  You want to win?
[02:17:36.899 --> 02:17:37.819]  I know you do.
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:40.579]  The VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[02:17:40.879 --> 02:17:43.219]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:45.459]  Exclusive VIP only giveaways.
[02:17:45.659 --> 02:17:47.360]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[02:17:47.479 --> 02:17:50.959]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:52.700]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:55.500]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[02:17:55.819 --> 02:18:00.780]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[02:18:00.979 --> 02:18:02.020]  You're in the know.
[02:18:02.319 --> 02:18:04.340]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[02:18:04.819 --> 02:18:05.559]  Free shipping.
[02:18:05.559 --> 02:18:08.719]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[02:18:08.719 --> 02:18:10.100]  It just goes on from there.
[02:18:17.409 --> 02:18:19.649]  We're fighting the new world order.
[02:18:19.770 --> 02:18:21.530]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:26.250]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:27.709]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:35.750]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[02:18:36.069 --> 02:18:45.250]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[02:18:45.409 --> 02:18:52.850]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[02:18:52.989 --> 02:18:55.010]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[02:18:55.549 --> 02:18:58.049]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:59.350]  We've already...
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:01.299]  Just devastated them.
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.479]  I mean, world government, the new world orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:06.059]  The whole world's turning against them.
[02:19:06.559 --> 02:19:07.639]  They're super dangerous.
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:10.479]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[02:19:10.959 --> 02:19:21.540]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:23.379]  So, again, I don't give up.
[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:26.260]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:29.879]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:32.319]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[02:19:32.479 --> 02:19:33.819]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:42.579]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:47.540]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[02:19:48.659 --> 02:19:50.940]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[02:19:52.579 --> 02:19:53.540]  I mean, it's just...
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:54.780]  This is a joke.
[02:19:55.059 --> 02:19:56.260]  This is ridiculous.
[02:19:56.719 --> 02:19:57.819]  We're changing the world.
[02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:00.780]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[02:20:04.930 --> 02:20:09.770]  I'm shooting this update on Tuesday, October 14th, 2024.
[02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:17.450]  In 28 days, Infowars goes up for sale and the bad guys say they're going to try to outbid the good guys and shut us down.
[02:20:17.889 --> 02:20:22.290]  Well, regardless of what happens, I'm going to stay on the air.
[02:20:22.649 --> 02:20:29.569]  And I know those of you watching and listening think the same thing because you love America, you love freedom, and you're not rolling over to the globalists.
[02:20:29.729 --> 02:20:34.770]  You're not rolling over to their censorship and their bullying and how they've terrorized the American people.
[02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:38.709]  You're fired up and you are part, you are at the heart of the Great Awakening.
[02:20:39.559 --> 02:20:46.780]  We make it really easy to ensure no matter what happens to InfoWars, we stay on the air and keep fighting without missing a beat.
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:51.739]  And the way to do that is to support our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:59.819]  With incredible t-shirts, amazing ball caps, hoodies, you name it, that spread the word and promote a message of liberty.
[02:20:59.819 --> 02:21:01.700]  And you also meet like-minded people while you do it.
[02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:04.399]  There's also incredible supplements for years.
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:06.399]  Irish Seamoss.com.
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:17.000]  has been all the rage as the superfood because just in the concentrated moss itself, it's full of one of the best types of iodine that is such a key in our entire body.
[02:21:17.219 --> 02:21:21.159]  But then it's got all of these other superfoods and ingredients in it.
[02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:27.559]  That just turbocharged the entire body, particularly the thyroid and all of your hormones in your body.
[02:21:27.799 --> 02:21:37.479]  The endocrine disruptors, the weed killers, the atrazine, all the glyphosate that's in the food, the water, everywhere, suppresses that and blocks that.
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.299]  That's why using the compounds God gave us does incredible things.
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:50.100]  Now, we sold out of the first round Of concentrated gummies, Irish Sea Moss, Ultimate Sea Moss, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:21:50.319 --> 02:21:51.860]  But more is coming in next week.
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:22:08.579]  But they just got in yesterday the powdered capsules of it that don't taste great like the gummies but dissolve in your stomach so you never taste it so it doesn't matter that are twice as strong when it comes to the iodine and the other key compounds in it.
[02:22:08.879 --> 02:22:09.920]  Now the gummies are amazing.
[02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:10.700]  People are going to love them.
[02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:14.000]  You get instant energy from them but it takes a few weeks for the iodine to really kick in.
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:21.319]  We're good to go.
[02:22:21.319 --> 02:22:22.680]  We're good to go.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:32.479]  We're good to go.
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.899]  Trace elements in it so it really gets into your blood, really gets into your cells.
[02:22:36.059 --> 02:22:43.180]  I was already incredibly excited about our CMOS because I know about the rave reviews, but since I've been taking it, it is insanely good.
[02:22:43.399 --> 02:22:49.219]  I've just now started taking yesterday the capsules and they're even more incredible than the gummies.
[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:58.260]  So for adults, for children, for old folks, for everybody, you want to get Ultimate CMOS at thealexjonesstore.com and it funds our operation.

[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:33.399]  This is a classic, but if InfoWars shuts down, it's going to be quite a collector's item, quite the memento of history, but if we survive, it'll be even cooler.
[02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:35.600]  So please, make your mark in history.
