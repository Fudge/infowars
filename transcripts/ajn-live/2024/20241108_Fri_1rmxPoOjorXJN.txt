[00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.050]  We're good to go.
[00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.090]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.850]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country, and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.109]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.929]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.549]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.989]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:09.810]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.950]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.590]  Listen.
[00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.930]  I don't know how long this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.420]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.579]  Broadcasting to all patriots who refuse tyranny, you're listening to Alex Jones Live.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.579]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, an emergency Thursday transmission.
[00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.159]  It is 8 p.m.
[00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.180]  and one minute Central Standard Time.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.500]  We are now two days into the historic victory against the deep state and the globalists.
[00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.680]  They are in absolute disarray and lashing out.
[00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:22.349]  At every level, whether it is the Soros-controlled prosecutors or the federal prosecutors or the private head of the Federal Reserve, they are all apoplectic right now.
[00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:29.580]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I came in here for this emergency transmission tonight from our backup emergency studios.
[00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.699]  InfoWars could be shut down next Wednesday on November 13th.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.860]  We've been forced to be sold into bankruptcy at an estate sale, even though the company's been successful and profitable.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.939]  The Democrats that sued me and had their fake rigged judgments in kangaroo trials, where I was already found guilty before the trial, said openly they did not want money, they want us shut down.
[00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.150]  But regardless, we continue on here at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.349]  Follow me on X at AJNLive.
[00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.229]  And of course, at Real Alex Jones, they tried to take that and my name.
[00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.550]  So far, the federal courts have said they can't take my name.
[00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.610]  It's a violation of the 30th Amendment.
[00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.349]  So they withdrew those suits but promised to bring them back.
[00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.250]  That's how insane these people are.
[00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.229]  So they do not want you to be hearing this information.
[00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.800]  I don't want you to be seeing this information that we're bringing you tonight.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:22.460]  So remember, however you're watching us right now, take the live link and share it on your email, your text message on X. That's how we reach tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.479]  And we are right now because everything I talked about for 30 years and warned you about is now out in the open.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.159]  But I also told you that humanity has power and the globalists are pushing stuff that is completely illegal and unpopular.
[00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:44.870]  And we knew they would actually launch all this stuff and we'd have great credibility once they launched their new world order from Beta, Agenda 21, into Agenda 2030, the official global government takeover plan.
[00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.889]  And they have now done it.
[00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.969]  And so the credibility has totally exploded.
[00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.009]  We are now the dominant main cultural force in the world.
[00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:59.830]  All of the best people from Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and myself and all of you, Are speaking about the globalists and saying no.
[00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:09.669]  You all know Harari, the high priest of the WEF, said three days ago that if Trump was elected, it would devastate the world government and people would not pledge allegiance to their world government.
[00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.449]  That is a quote.
[00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.449]  You look the quote up.
[00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.050]  It's all over the place.
[00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.469]  I played it.
[00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.409]  Three or four times the last few days.
[00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.490]  I may have played again tonight.
[00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.850]  And then, of course, Trump did get elected and overrode their massive fraud.
[00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:25.790]  He didn't win in a landslide, but they had a lot of fraud baked in, so it was only a moderate landslide, but still huge.
[00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.310]  The trifecta, the House, the Senate, the executive branch, and I'll even show you maps of California, not in California.
[00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.910]  40-plus years has it been this red.
[00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.709]  Despite all the fraud, it overrode it in many counties and in many cities.
[00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.149]  That is all coming up.
[00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.970]  Trump has picked his new chief of staff, the first person, the first time it's been a woman.
[00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.540]  And I'm told by Roger Stone and others that she is a great lady.
[00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.560]  And so we're going to be looking at Susie Wiles and more here tonight.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.420]  The private head of the Federal Reserve that Trump's been critical of said that if Trump even tells him to quit, that he will refuse to resign.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.379]  This is a big deal, and I'll explain why coming up as well.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.230]  Also, Just like they did when they tried to launch monkeypox two and a half years ago.
[00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.970]  They did it again earlier this year, as you know, for the election, but nobody bought it.
[00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.870]  They called it M-Pox when they did the second rollout.
[00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:27.410]  But the first rollout a few years ago, they said a truck in Pennsylvania had dumped over with monkeys that had monkeypox.
[00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.350]  Of course, it was just made up to scare people.
[00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.569]  Now they're like, oh, more monkeys.
[00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.430]  Maybe with monkeypox escaped in California.
[00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.250]  And oh, people might have monkeypox in England.
[00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.290]  Oh, global emergency.
[00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.569]  Oh, the UN. Oh, new pandemic.
[00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.220]  That all starts getting high within 24 hours of Trump winning the presidency.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.079]  We also now are learning that the CDC planned quarantine camps nationwide and is still planning them under UN treaties.
[00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.939]  COVID 2.0, new monkeypox variant in the UK as 40 rhesus monkeys escape.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.339]  A Carolina, not California, research facility.
[00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.839]  There is so much more we're going to be getting into in this emergency Thursday transmission.
[00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.120]  You are the resistance.
[00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:09.759]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:23.459]  When you decide to magnify this live transmission, when you decide to share, when you decide to take clips out of it that you think are the most pertinent and share it, that overrides the sensors and we reach hundreds of millions of people in the last three days on X alone.
[00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.089]  In one day, we reached over 300 million people with our clips and live feeds.
[00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:35.329]  If you add the last three days together, it is conservatively over 500 million people on our Major X channels.
[00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:36.069]  So great job.
[00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.170]  Everybody, folks are very, very interested in the truth and historic things are happening.
[00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:50.490]  I want to invite all those viewers to start following us in case they take over the Real Ox Jones channels or trying in court and shut down Infowars next week at AJN Live.
[00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.050]  At AJN Live.
[00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.209]  You can see it there on screen.
[00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.529]  But first, I have exclusive information from multiple sources.
[00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:01.670]  And this is a big deal.
[00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.769]  Alfie Oaks, who's in Naples, Florida, who is a pillar.
[00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.029]  We'll show you some B-roll of the raid on his home today.
[00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:16.149]  Alfie Oaks, who is a pillar in the community where he lives in Naples, Florida.
[00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.050]  Good friend of mine.
[00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.209]  Huge Trump booster.
[00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.149]  The guy that got fluoride taken out over a decade ago in their water.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.459]  The guy that's pushing organic farming nationwide.
[00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:26.040]  His dad created the first organic grocery store.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.399]  He got started in his own separate business at 15, selling watermelons on the side of the road.
[00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:32.939]  He's got some of the biggest farms in Florida.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.759]  Doesn't just supply his own grocery stores, but he supplies many of the other grocery stores with organic food.
[00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.319]  He's working with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.300]  This is exclusive.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:57.779]  And they were talking to him about In the last 48 hours, whether he would want to be the new head of the Department of Agriculture, to actually have a farmer and businessman there, because they tried to get Congressman Massey to do it, but for reasons of family and things, he's saying that he's probably not going to do it.
[00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:05.879]  So they were talking to him about doing it, and less than 48 hours later, obviously Trump's phones are all tapped, Kennedy's are all tapped, they'll go after Kennedy next to kill his dad and uncle.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.160]  I'm predicting they're going to go after him big time, pray for him.
[00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:12.920]  That they raided his home, and Here's where it gets crazy.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.899]  You never see this.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.560]  The Department of Defense, you just pull in, just go to Google, Alvy Oaks, raided, and then type in Department of Defense.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:45.190]  The Department of Defense, the FBI, the IRS, and other agencies raided him at his home and He has been indicted supposedly for IRS violations and some type of computer crimes but they won't tell him and I talked to him today,
[00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.190]  and he said, I have no idea even what's going on here.
[00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.690]  He goes, I've got a big company, a lot of moving parts.
[00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.789]  You know how the IRS is.
[00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.129]  They can claim anything's criminal, but he doesn't know why the military's there.
[00:08:55.549 --> 00:09:01.809]  You know, Biden signed that executive order to use the military on us and kill U.S. citizens, then blamed Trump for it, said he was planning it, or actually Kamala did.
[00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.690]  Well, he did as well.
[00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.870]  So a lot of bizarreness going on.
[00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.110]  Very, very rare.
[00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:12.509]  IRS, other federal agencies swarm Alvy Oaks, Naples Home Businesses, U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General.
[00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:23.299]  It says agents are on the scene at Alfie Oak's home and packing house where they pack vegetables and fruits in Naples.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.720]  So this is crazy.
[00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:33.429]  Then I made some other phone calls, because I guess part of this is already in the news, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:39.029]  is helping Trump come up with real candidates to drain the swamp, and they're trying to get those in the transition.
[00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:42.649]  Trump has not announced anybody in his transition yet until about an hour ago.
[00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:49.350]  His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, the first female chief of staff in U.S. history, she's Reportedly very, very capable.
[00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:50.710]  Got a great job with Trump.
[00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.210]  He loves her.
[00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:52.289]  So that's great.
[00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:53.389]  I don't care if she's a woman or a man.
[00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:55.129]  She's good, and Trump likes her and trusts her.
[00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:55.529]  That's great.
[00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:04.129]  But the point is that they're trying to get the other people ready, and also folks for confirmation in 73 days when he's the president.
[00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.269]  Not just president-elect, but actually sworn in on January 20th, just in 73 days.
[00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:24.230]  So The fact that the Defense Department's there, the fact that they went and is safe, reportedly took the gold out of it, the fact that they're doing all of this, He doesn't know.
[00:10:24.629 --> 00:10:28.169]  He said he has no idea, but obviously it looks political.
[00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.429]  He is very, very close to General Flynn.
[00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.610]  Also, he's been criminally investigated for paying for buses for the big January 6th event at the Ellipse with Trump.
[00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.070]  A million people came, hundreds of thousands went to the Capitol.
[00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.990]  You all know how that was a setup.
[00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:44.230]  Only maybe 100 fought back with the police, most of them provocateurs.
[00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:48.190]  Then they said the whole million people were all criminals, even though most of them weren't there.
[00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:52.080]  But they've talked about indicting him for that.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.159]  He's done an investigation for that.
[00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:55.080]  You can just type in Alfie Oaks, January 6th.
[00:10:55.159 --> 00:11:02.559]  There's a bunch of news articles in the last four years about maybe he'll get indicted because, ooh, he sent people in buses to First Amendment.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.220]  I mean, there's nothing more evil than that.
[00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.000]  So again, he said, I don't know.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.340]  He said, this is bizarre.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.580]  Everything he does is run by accountants and above board.
[00:11:14.699 --> 00:11:20.940]  So, Owen is, of course, been a January 6th political prisoner, did nothing wrong, didn't go in the building, was there trying to keep people going in.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:31.179]  And he thinks, and that's what most of the people I know that know Alfie in Naples, and I've got a crew member who's got a family that's worked there and knows Alfie very, very well.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.379]  They're friends of the family.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.399]  And I talked to some other folks that live in Naples.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.379]  You know, got some info from Shemaine Nugent.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.039]  They're friends with him.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.779]  They live close to him in Naples.
[00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:40.220]  They're friends.
[00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.029]  And they're getting intel.
[00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:43.610]  So I'm getting this from a lot of sources.
[00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.750]  And, you know, the word is the feds are really pissed about January 6th.
[00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:53.649]  They're pissed about him being the first major stores to say we're not wearing masks, we're not making our employees take shots.
[00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.269]  And they're really upset about him, you know, set to perhaps be in the Trump administration.
[00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.809]  And so they had this investigation on the shelf, and I guess they went ahead and launched it.
[00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:09.250]  Anything coming out of this current Justice Department is political, in my view, can't be trusted.
[00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.450]  This man has no criminal record as a pillar in the community.
[00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:14.649]  And I've had them trying to indict me.
[00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:17.529]  I've had them put my co-host in jail for no reason.
[00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:22.769]  And in the filings, they just said all these public lies, like Owen Schroyer does not work for Alex Jones.
[00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.429]  When he says he's a journalist there with Alex Jones that day, it's not true he doesn't work for Alex Jones.
[00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:32.169]  And he worked for me when they indicted him since 2016.
[00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:36.509]  And that was, I guess they indicted him in like, it was 2022.
[00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:41.669]  So he'd worked with us for six years when that happened.
[00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:47.110]  So, now he's worked with us over eight years.
[00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:50.029]  But that's like, he's a well-known, popular talk show host.
[00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.549]  And it says in the filing, Your Honor, he doesn't work with Alex Jones.
[00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:53.669]  He's not a talk show host.
[00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.850]  This is not true, sir.
[00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:55.570]  He's not a journalist.
[00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.350]  They said Mr.
[00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.529]  Jones is in the filing, but he does not work with him.
[00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.070]  What?
[00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.009]  My employee.
[00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:05.809]  So, these level of lies, they just don't care.
[00:13:06.009 --> 00:13:08.990]  It's the same folks that tell you that two men...
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.720]  Can have a baby.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.779]  And so, it's a cult.
[00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:21.960]  And they're desperate.
[00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:25.580]  And Owen seems to think, and that's what most people have talked to that don't know.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.700]  Alfie, he says he doesn't know.
[00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:27.720]  He's completely dumbfounded.
[00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:37.570]  They won't tell anyone supposedly he's done while they're rummaging through his house that they want to tie this to Jan 6 and Flynn and Trump somehow.
[00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.870]  Jamie Raskin said they want to call Trump an insurrectionist.
[00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.769]  He's got to be convicted of that to be barred from being the president, but they need some excuse to challenge it.
[00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:53.629]  Remember Obama said he was going to help with the transfer of power to Trump, but then attacked him with his intelligence agencies behind the scenes, illegal wiretapping setups of General Flynn and others.
[00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:57.850]  And you heard the same script from Biden and from Harris.
[00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.669]  Yesterday and today.
[00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.429]  So there is no telling.
[00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:08.070]  But I mean, this is definitely, definitely political.
[00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.950]  And what is the military doing there?
[00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.190]  So we're going to learn more about this.
[00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.429]  I asked Alfie to come on tomorrow.
[00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:15.789]  He says, I got to talk to my lawyers.
[00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:16.970]  I said, I got to figure out what's going on.
[00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:17.929]  He said, I will if I can.
[00:14:18.809 --> 00:14:20.730]  And I was just like, well, you've done nothing wrong.
[00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:21.450]  I mean, oh, you're a good guy.
[00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:22.029]  He goes, I know.
[00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:27.070]  But he just said, I just, I'm dumbfounded.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.080]  And so that's basically what's going on there.
[00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:35.940]  And he's merging with the Maha movement.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.740]  He fits perfectly into it, the Make America Healthy Again, with President Trump's Make America Great Again.
[00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:44.159]  And so they were very scared of this guy.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:15:06.600]  Owen thinks that now in their last two and a half months in power, they're going to try to launch a whole bunch of other criminal investigations against Trump supporters instead of a dragnet to try to get new charges because they've had to drop all the other charges, not just because he's the president and that's federal law, that the only way to get rid of a president is unelect them or impeach them,
[00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:22.269]  or you'd have every two-bit attorney general or prosecutor taking down the executive branch and So they had to do that because of law,
[00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.850]  but also their cases had all completely disintegrated and fallen apart.
[00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:31.190]  Now, let's move on to the really big news.
[00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:33.110]  There's a lot of it, but this is huge.
[00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:46.750]  Jerome Powell, the head of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve, was asked at a press conference today about the monetary policy of the U.S. and our future, and he said, this is unsustainable.
[00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.870]  We're going to go bankrupt soon.
[00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:48.649]  We don't stop this.
[00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.730]  And then another reporter, which is true, but it's been the Federal Reserve policy that did that.
[00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.409]  Another reporter said, if Trump asks you to resign or tells you to step down, will you do it?
[00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.190]  I'll play the clip in a moment.
[00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.230]  And he said, no.
[00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.649]  Now, a lot of people freaked out by that and said, well, this is crazy that the president can fire him.
[00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.049]  No, he can't.
[00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:28.429]  The Private Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was passed by three senators on Christmas Eve and We're good to go.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.700]  Years ago, this happened.
[00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:48.960]  And before that, the Constitution says that Congress sets monetary policy and sets the taxes and that silver and gold will be legal tender.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.639]  But since then, they've taken us completely off of that and we're under this Federal Reserve Banking Cartel.
[00:16:55.299 --> 00:17:02.460]  And when he was leaving Alan Greenspan, it was about 15 years ago, the clip's out, but just type in Alan Greenspan and says the Fed's above the law.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:12.670]  He was on the Laird News Hour on PBS. And he says, you know, they say, what is the relationship with the president and the Congress and the government with the Fed?
[00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.750]  He says, there is none.
[00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:18.049]  No court, no president, no one in Congress has anything to say about us.
[00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.609]  We're our own branch of government, and we can do what we want.
[00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:22.750]  Well, that's not true.
[00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:42.410]  The president, under the Federal Reserve Act, cannot fire the head of the New York private Federal Reserve, because you have the regional banks that are a subgroup that advise the government, but the actual owner of the Federal Reserve is the board of the New York Fed that reports to the private owners.
[00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:43.309]  And this is on record.
[00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.049]  Read the charter of it.
[00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:45.349]  1913, it's in the bill.
[00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.250]  This is not debated.
[00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.690]  So there's Federal Express or Federal Ammunition or Federal Plumbing.
[00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.150]  Or, you know, federal cleaners.
[00:17:54.109 --> 00:17:56.230]  Or, you know, federal payday loans.
[00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:57.529]  I mean, whatever you want to call it.
[00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.630]  It's not federal.
[00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.849]  And it's insane.
[00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:06.029]  And that's a big deal.
[00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.369]  Federal Reserve chairman admits agency is above the law and the president.
[00:18:09.849 --> 00:18:11.670]  Well, that's the same headline I put out.
[00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:12.890]  I know Pew Research did that.
[00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.869]  I put out the same headline on X today.
[00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.769]  I shot a report before I came to this studio.
[00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.029]  That's my headline.
[00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.609]  Federal Reserve...
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.339]  Private Federal Reserve head announces the Fed is above the law.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.700]  Now, you ask how did this happen?
[00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:36.380]  Well, there is a clause that they have no authority over it, but because they created it, because Congress has the power to control monetary, they can abolish it.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.819]  But that's all Congress can do in the Federal Reserve Act is abolish it.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.799]  I guess nationalize it.
[00:18:44.059 --> 00:18:44.960]  It's a trust.
[00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:45.839]  It's a monopoly.
[00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:50.380]  We have the 1906 Antitrust Act, Sherman Antitrust Act of Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.660]  It is as obvious as the nose on my face or yours that it is a monopoly.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.839]  It's secretive.
[00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.380]  It has private shareholders.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.339]  They've run this country to the ground.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.740]  They give their own private banks that are subsidiaries, unlimited money at no interest.
[00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:04.980]  Then they loan it to us at interest.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.920]  It is beyond fractional reserve banking.
[00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:08.200]  It is total fraud.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.839]  And they've got all the derivatives and all the rest of it, and they're vertically integrating the economy.
[00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:15.220]  They are only giving money to the elite groups.
[00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:20.940]  They're using the ESG score to control all the companies in the U.S. and around the world that they're connected to.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.880]  BlackRock's just a front group of these people, and they want to control our behavior.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.750]  Like Larry Fink said last year at the Global Government Forum, In Davos.
[00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.490]  He said, we're going to control people's behavior with these systems.
[00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:35.569]  So it's the social credit score.
[00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.430]  It's already a corporate social credit score.
[00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.309]  And the Federal Reserve is...
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.819]  Owned by the same people that own the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, it's the same group.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.579]  And that's who owns BlackRock.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.859]  That's who controls BlackRock.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.119]  They're the main shareholders in that that then goes out and enforces all this.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.880]  So they just get more and more power, more and more control.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.140]  They want to make you eat bugs.
[00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:56.900]  They want to say you can't have a car.
[00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.460]  They want to ban gasoline cars.
[00:19:58.579 --> 00:19:59.660]  They want to ban your rain stove.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.359]  You wonder why all these policies of drag queen story time and all of it around the world happen.
[00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:07.839]  It's literally the ESG score of BlackRock that is the corporate front of these people.
[00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:09.380]  And there he is.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:16.759]  BlackRock CEO slammed for forced behaviors comment after a 2017 interview reemerges about DEI. And he said it again last year.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.319]  He said, I'm under attack for this, but I agree with it.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.779]  He knows best for you.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:28.140]  It's like Bill Gates is your doctor and he's going to control your body and going to release deadly mosquitoes and going to block out the sun and chemtrail you.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.440]  But none of it exists, even though he announces he's doing it all.
[00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:31.960]  So...
[00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:36.509]  They act like they're above the law.
[00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:38.829]  They also act like they're a branch of government.
[00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.390]  No, they're not a forged branch of government.
[00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:51.690]  Congress used its power, and the Supreme Court should have come in with a constitutional crisis and blocked us, and said, yeah, we can give the control of this to a private group and call it the Federal Reserve.
[00:20:52.759 --> 00:21:07.960]  So when he says, Trump can't fire me, that's true, but Trump can put pressure on Congress to not just fire his ass, but abolish it, and on the same day, nationalize it, and then make the policy public, and it's a monopoly,
[00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:14.140]  go in and audit it, and then show that it's basically BlackRock and the globalist.
[00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.529]  So, this is a huge deal.
[00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:20.170]  And look, I've been on there 30 years.
[00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.210]  When I was growing up and learning about the New World Order, everything's about the Federal Reserve.
[00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.190]  It's the heart of their takeover, the heart of their power.
[00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.470]  I've talked about it so much.
[00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:31.900]  It shows Ron Paul, it makes my, you know, Vocal cords ache.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.660]  But now Ron Paul's coming into the administration, advisory role.
[00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:37.960]  I'm told that's done with Elon Musk.
[00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:38.619]  Very exciting.
[00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:40.619]  Musk is about to be on Ron Paul's show very soon.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.200]  In Houston, that's very exciting.
[00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:46.180]  And this is how we really take our country back.
[00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:46.940]  How about the deep state?
[00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:49.220]  The original deep state in this country is the Federal Reserve.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.319]  Then they got the 1947 National Security Act, the CIA to operate in secrecy.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.940]  And from there, it just gets worse and worse.
[00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:58.480]  And now, literally, the Carnegie Endowment, the big tax-free foundations that...
[00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.470]  They're controlled because they're owned and funded by the families that own the Federal Reserve and BlackRock.
[00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:12.630]  They're the ones pushing all the anti-family agenda, the transgenderism, all of it to control you, poison you, slowly dumb you down, and finally depopulate.
[00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:18.470]  And Bill Gates is their little science advisor who's the front man from all of this.
[00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:19.869]  Yeah, G. Edward Griffin can really speak to this.
[00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:20.809]  We should get him back on.
[00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:25.710]  And expose this and talk about what Powell said.
[00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:38.789]  So by him arrogantly saying, and he looks scared while he's saying it, he's now made a firestorm here, and Trump's been critical of him and his policies, and not cutting interest rates enough.
[00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:46.849]  And so he's really jumped the shark here, because there's already major moves to go after this.
[00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:52.400]  So we busted up Standard Oil, we busted up AT&T, Bell Telephone.
[00:22:52.839 --> 00:23:00.500]  And we should be able to bust this up because monopoly-wise, you know, Microsoft got broke up.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:09.299]  AT&T and Standard Oil, compared to this monopoly, are like a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.460]  The Federal Reserve is a 10.
[00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:19.619]  Above the law, private secrets snuck it through Congress in 1913, the middle of the night, literally, with three senators voting on it.
[00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:23.589]  And then now it's running all the policy into the ground and controlling our lives.
[00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.630]  It's the head of the snake.
[00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:28.869]  And so these guys are really revealing themselves.
[00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:33.750]  Then we got Rachel Maddow calls on military media and millions of Americans to defy Trump administration.
[00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.210]  So that's where this is going.
[00:23:38.309 --> 00:23:44.809]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Fed Chair Powell says he won't step down if Trump asks for his registration.
[00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:45.369]  Here it is.
[00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.390]  Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico.
[00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:53.869]  Some of the President's elects advisors have suggested that you should resign.
[00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:56.650]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:57.430]  No.
[00:23:58.529 --> 00:24:04.170]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:04.849]  No.
[00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:16.130]  The clip you just saw, I'm about to play the full clip in a moment, is from just a few hours ago, where the head of the Federal Reserve at a press conference was asked, if Trump tells you to step down, will you?
[00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:17.190]  And he says, no.
[00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:22.849]  And people are blown away saying, wait a minute, the president can't remove somebody?
[00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.450]  And that's actually the truth.
[00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:34.069]  The president cannot remove the head of the private Federal Reserve set up in 1913 that Ron Paul and countless others have been exposing.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.740]  It is in control of the monetary policy of the United States.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.220]  It is not part of the three branches, legislative, executive, and judicial.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.839]  It's not in the Federalist Papers.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.079]  It doesn't exist.
[00:24:46.339 --> 00:25:03.789]  In 1913, a private consortium of banks lobbied Congress, and on December 23rd, 1913, in a quorum called only three senators to Pass the monetary coup or hijacking of our nation.
[00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:14.930]  Now, Powell at that same press conference said U.S. fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path, but they're the ones that are behind this unsustainable path.
[00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:39.650]  So just like the Trump re-election, everything that's happened in this country the last few years is a wake-up call for people, the general public is now waking up to the fact that, indeed, The Federal Reserve is private, run for profit, and is owned by private banks and has been consolidating power and vertically integrating the economic future of Americans into their hands in a criminal,
[00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:43.769]  crony capitalistic transfer of wealth.
[00:25:43.950 --> 00:26:01.019]  So I'm going to play you the full clip And I'm going to play a clip from Alan Greenspan more than 15 years ago when he had just left the private Federal Reserve, asked the same question on PBS, and he said the relationship of the government, the president, any of it, with the president and with the government,
[00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:06.539]  the Federal Reserve, is zero because no branch of government has any effect over them.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.759]  So really, they're dictators, aren't they?
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:16.279]  If they control monetary power and voters, Congress, the courts, the executive, the states, can do nothing.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:23.119]  But see, that's true to a certain point, but they never tell you the fine print.
[00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:31.940]  Congress created the Federal Reserve, and Congress could abolish the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.539]  And that's what's exciting.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:56.890]  Right now, Ron Paul is talking to Elon Musk and Trump about coming into the administration on monetary policy and developing a plan with the Elon Musk office that's going to be designed to work on efficiency to develop a plan to return the power of the purse to Congress.
[00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.670]  And that's in the Constitution.
[00:26:59.529 --> 00:27:06.289]  So there's been a long-term coup in this country for over 100 years, but now we're waking up to it and preparing to remove it.
[00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:12.009]  And at the heart of the permanent bureaucracy corporate deep state is the private Federal Reserve.
[00:27:12.309 --> 00:27:20.430]  So today we learn about BlackRock with over 80% of world assets under its control being more powerful than governments.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:31.500]  You have to understand that the main shareholders of BlackRock are also the same private families that set up the U.S. Federal Reserve and that control the other private central banks of most of the nations of the earth.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.079]  This is the new world order.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.200]  These are the people that are in control of our planet.
[00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:37.920]  These are the people that created the United Nations.
[00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:46.000]  They're the ones setting up an unelected world government, a global cash flow society, central bank digital currencies, social credit scores, universal incomes.
[00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:52.529]  They're the ones that are pushing the anti-family tyranny and the wars.
[00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.670]  They're the ones that admittedly want you poor and the Great Reset.
[00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:03.890]  So here is the head of the private fellow reserve saying he doesn't care about the president or anybody else for that matter because he's above the law.
[00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:08.250]  And then here's Alan Greenspan acting like he's outside above the law.
[00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.390]  But they're not.
[00:28:10.009 --> 00:28:14.670]  Yes, the law says they operate and basically are more powerful than anybody in the government.
[00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:22.710]  But they're not the government, and the government can't stop them or interfere unless you abolish it.
[00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:29.089]  It's time to audit, expose, and then abolish the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.650]  Here's Powell, the current chairman, and then Alan Greenspan.
[00:28:33.109 --> 00:28:40.650]  The U.S. federal government's fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path.
[00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:44.269]  The level of our debt relative to the economy is not unsustainable.
[00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.769]  The path is unsustainable.
[00:28:47.829 --> 00:28:58.170]  Do you believe the president has the power to fire or demote you and has the Fed determined the legality of a president demoting at will any of the other governors with leadership positions?
[00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:59.930]  Not permitted under the law.
[00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.410]  Not what?
[00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:03.609]  Not permitted under the law.
[00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:04.069]  Thank you.
[00:29:04.589 --> 00:29:11.210]  Another economic hangover after the pandemic is a sharp increase in the national debt.
[00:29:11.859 --> 00:29:20.900]  Thirty years from now, it is projected to be $144 trillion, or $1 million per household.
[00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:23.660]  How do you assess the national debt?
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:34.140]  We mostly try very hard not to comment on fiscal policy and, you know, instruct Congress on how to do their job when actually they have oversight over us.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.720]  But is the national debt a danger to the economy, in your view, in the long run?
[00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.069]  The U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal path.
[00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.529]  The U.S. federal government's on an unsustainable fiscal path.
[00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.470]  And that just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy.
[00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.569]  I have the sense this worries you very much.
[00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.990]  Over the long run, of course it does.
[00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.109]  You know, we're effectively, we're borrowing from future generations.
[00:29:56.509 --> 00:30:01.809]  It's time for us to get back to putting a priority on fiscal sustainability.
[00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.210]  And sooner is better than later.
[00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.769]  You know, we don't want the labor market to soften much from here.
[00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:14.029]  We don't think we need that to happen to get inflation back to 2%.
[00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:15.829]  Victoria.
[00:30:19.009 --> 00:30:20.890]  Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico.
[00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:26.430]  Some of the President-elect's advisors have suggested that you should resign.
[00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.150]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:29.930]  No.
[00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.190]  Can you follow up on...
[00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.650]  Do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:37.349]  No.
[00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:46.430]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a Chairman of the Fed and a President of the United States?
[00:30:47.650 --> 00:31:01.750]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:21.480]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:25.319]  And I've had very good relationships with presidents.
[00:31:28.289 --> 00:31:38.950]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government.
[00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.130]  All right, that's enough.
[00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:43.529]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.430]  Now, you notice Powell told 60 Minutes, well, Congress has oversight.
[00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.730]  They've never audited them, nothing.
[00:31:50.369 --> 00:31:54.250]  And they actually don't, other than the Constitution, that they could abolish it.
[00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:11.180]  So, technically, as I've watched the hearings, I've talked to Ron Paul, they would have to basically, the best thing to do is just say, pass the law, it's abolished, we're nationalizing it, give us all the files, do the audit, and Ron Paul tried to get audits,
[00:32:11.259 --> 00:32:11.700]  all of that.
[00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:13.019]  This is just...
[00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:15.210]  Outrageous.
[00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:22.210]  But the good news is, finally, everything we tried to get people to wake up to decades and decades ago, and we slowly did wake up people, but it was exponential.
[00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.369]  So the growth curve is like this over the last 30, 40 years.
[00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.710]  And I was like, straight up.
[00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:29.789]  More people are waking up in a week now than used to wake up, you know, in years.
[00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:35.250]  So this is a very, very magic moment we're in, a very, very exciting moment we're in.
[00:32:35.309 --> 00:32:35.829]  It's scary.
[00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:43.349]  And the corrupt agencies that interface with these big private banks and BlackRock think they're God.
[00:32:43.569 --> 00:32:48.410]  And their answer to control us is to control our behavior through the money and through a social credit score.
[00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:49.750]  I mean, I can pull Fink up for you.
[00:32:49.829 --> 00:32:53.210]  The crew did a great job when I mentioned it, pulling up articles where he got in hot water for saying it.
[00:32:53.430 --> 00:33:00.589]  And now all these states are moving, attorney generals, to pull the state pension funds and other things out of BlackRock's management.
[00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:10.009]  So it has private owners It wants to socially control all of us with a social credit score that they pioneered and have in China for now seven years.
[00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:12.470]  It's hell on earth, where we don't do exactly what they say.
[00:33:12.609 --> 00:33:18.289]  You can't have a job, can't go to a doctor, can't get in a taxi, can't get in a bus, can't fly on a plane.
[00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.150]  And they have big jumbotrons everywhere, face-scanning people.
[00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:26.009]  You just type into YouTube, you know, social credit score China, and it's totally dystopian.
[00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.849]  They're going to X and type it in.
[00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.970]  The left's like, this is good.
[00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:29.630]  We need this here.
[00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:31.450]  So it's not coming.
[00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:32.009]  It's here.
[00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:33.910]  And it's totally totalitarian.
[00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:35.970]  It's absolutely out of control.
[00:33:36.609 --> 00:33:40.890]  And it should be easy to just say no to these people.
[00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.049]  And it's starting to happen.
[00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:52.369]  I mean, they're promoting illegal, horrible, totalitarian, oppressive, control freak, nightmare, mark of the beast scenarios.
[00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.490]  You can say, well, I don't believe the Bible.
[00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.609]  Okay, well, it believes in you.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:55.609]  Revelation.
[00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:09.190]  And it's all described, a world government, you gotta worship the beast, do what it says, and it's a system and the beast can be seen as a big image all over the world by all the people, like a hologram or a television, a computer screen.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400]  What do they have in China?
[00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:11.940]  It's like...
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.420]  It'll be like a person in a military uniform.
[00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:17.800]  And it's translated, you know, you did not pay your taxes.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.139]  You may not walk down the street.
[00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:21.059]  And then police are being called.
[00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:21.460]  Everyone.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.079]  This person is...
[00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:24.880]  You know, it'll show their face.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.780]  I mean, there's hundreds of those videos.
[00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:28.780]  Yeah, you can pull them up everywhere.
[00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.119]  And you try to use the bathroom.
[00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.619]  It won't let you use the bathroom.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.079]  All the toilets are paid.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.739]  Or turn the water on.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.420]  I mean, just imagine the hell of this.
[00:34:38.539 --> 00:34:41.099]  It's like Dark Mirror, the episode on steroids.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.159]  But they didn't get the idea from this for Dark Mirror.
[00:34:43.519 --> 00:34:45.840]  This was already being put in in China when Dark Mirror came out.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.019]  They're just programming you and showing you How this operates.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:35:00.500]  So we're just standing up for common sense and saying no to the prison these globalists are building around us, and it all goes back to the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.960]  All right, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:09.559]  They're definitely trying to launch a new pandemic in fear.
[00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.050]  And they tried it with Monkey Pox two and a half years ago.
[00:35:13.269 --> 00:35:13.730]  That failed.
[00:35:13.889 --> 00:35:15.869]  They tried it again earlier this year with Monkey Pox.
[00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:16.730]  No one bought into it.
[00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:18.570]  They kept saying everybody's sick with Monkey Pox.
[00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.369]  Close the farms.
[00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.429]  Wear hazmat gear.
[00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:22.070]  Nobody had the Monkey Pox.
[00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.710]  It wasn't real.
[00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:23.510]  It wasn't true.
[00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.630]  Just total fraud.
[00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:29.670]  And the first time they released it two and a half years ago, you can pull up the article.
[00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:30.530]  I think it was Pennsylvania.
[00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.090]  It was like, in the middle of the night.
[00:35:32.269 --> 00:35:38.110]  Did you guys just type in, monkeys escaped from truck?
[00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:39.150]  Or in...
[00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:42.409]  Truck damage and accident.
[00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:45.369]  Monkeys with monkey pox escaped.
[00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.389]  That was two and a half years ago.
[00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:48.230]  I forgot to print it before I went on air.
[00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:58.369]  And then they use that, oh my God, they're out, and you've got it, and oh, everybody can get it, and oh, actually, it's 100% gay men that are eating each other's poop.
[00:35:59.429 --> 00:36:00.130]  I'm not joking.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.380]  And yeah, that is all animals are accounted for after a truck carrying a hundred lab monkeys crashed in Pennsylvania.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.679]  So I remember it was right, but at first it was, oh my God, monkeypox is going to get us.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.599]  And it's the same, same story again here.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.079]  They just keep running it.
[00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:18.820]  But monkeypox, that name was already used two and a half years ago.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.579]  So this year it was, it's called mpox and it's worse.
[00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:29.320]  Remember that Simpsons thing like 20 years ago where it goes, we need a new virus, a new viral scare.
[00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:34.789]  We'll call it You know, house cat fever or something like that.
[00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.750]  And, I mean, that's really what they do.
[00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:46.769]  So, COVID 2.0, new monkeypox variant, UK. 40 research monkeys escaped in Carolina research facility.
[00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:47.949]  So, it's just, oh my God.
[00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.949]  And we're all, you know, going to get it.
[00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.750]  And then later you find out, none of it's true.
[00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.559]  So, This is how they scare you.
[00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:56.679]  This is how they control you.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.780]  It's how they hit Trump last time.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.139]  And he didn't understand what was going on then, so he went along with part of it, woke up later to it.
[00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:08.199]  And they're going to probably try the viral scare again, if you ask me.
[00:37:08.739 --> 00:37:15.280]  The U.N. always said for decades, disease access will bring in world government, get control, get rid of national sovereignty, let the U.N. run everything.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.900]  Well, their treaty didn't pass, so they're saying, don't worry, a new pandemic's coming.
[00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:25.960]  So as you know, Six months ago, the UN declared a new global emergency for monkeypox, but that didn't scare people.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:32.840]  And so now they're back again, clearly trying to launch this.
[00:37:33.539 --> 00:37:35.260]  So it's just absolutely insane.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.219]  And then on top of that, we have this news.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.619]  And this is really old news, but it broke mainstream today.
[00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.409]  The UN said four and a half years ago, we're going to set up a global treaty.
[00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:52.570]  We're going to lock people up that don't agree with lockdowns, not just people that they claim might have COVID. And now New York and other states are trying to pass laws without even proof you have any disease.
[00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.969]  They can lock you up anytime they want.
[00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.670]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[00:37:55.789 --> 00:37:59.530]  So it's their cover for, in a martial law scenario, disappearing people.
[00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:03.510]  And now this, the CDC's planned quarantine camps nationwide.
[00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.929]  No matter how bad you think COVID policies were, they were intended to be worse.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.539]  And they did intend to just lock down anybody they wanted anytime indefinitely.
[00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:19.460]  And they would have used that with a CDC-run establishing nationwide quarantine camps.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.099]  Consider the vaccine passports alone.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.139]  Six cities were locked down to include only the vaccinated in public indoor places.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.579]  And other countries did it entirely.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.340]  They were New York, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.
[00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:36.380]  The plan was to enforce this with a vaccine passport.
[00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:42.650]  It broke once the news leaked that the shot didn't stop infection and transmission.
[00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:46.070]  The planners lost public support and the scheme collapsed.
[00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:50.929]  It was undoubtedly planned to be permanent and nationwide, if not worldwide.
[00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:53.730]  Instead, the scheme had to be dialed back.
[00:38:53.869 --> 00:38:55.030]  And that all came out.
[00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.110]  And Australia was the worst in New Zealand.
[00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.929]  Don't look at the sunshine.
[00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.230]  Don't look at the sunset.
[00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:00.090]  Don't talk to your neighbor.
[00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:01.690]  We're the only source of information.
[00:39:01.809 --> 00:39:02.489]  Only come to us.
[00:39:03.899 --> 00:39:08.440]  And they said, oh, you'll have to have phones to leave your house when we let you after years of lockdown.
[00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:12.139]  So they said, this is the global ID. Bill Gates and the U.N. are behind it.
[00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:15.000]  But even there, people started resisting.
[00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:15.480]  It didn't happen.
[00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:17.619]  So they tried to put the chains on us forever.
[00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:19.059]  And they're saying they're going to try again.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.940]  It was undoubtedly planned to be permanent and nationwide, if not worldwide.
[00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:26.039]  Instead, the scheme had to be dialed back.
[00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:32.630]  Features of the CDC's edict did incredible damage and imposed the rent moratorium.
[00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:36.130]  It decreed the ridiculous six feet distance and mask mandates.
[00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:57.079]  It forced plexiglass at the We're good to go.
[00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:02.570]  You can read the document right there.
[00:40:02.969 --> 00:40:06.510]  People were to be isolated, given only food and some cleaning supplies.
[00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.130]  They would be banned from participating in any religious activities.
[00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:12.570]  The plan included contingencies for preventing suicide.
[00:40:12.769 --> 00:40:17.929]  There were no provisions made for legal appeals or even the right to legal counsel.
[00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:21.369]  The plan's authors were unnamed and included 26 footnotes.
[00:40:21.449 --> 00:40:23.570]  It was all the UN. The UN actually admitted they had the global plan.
[00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:23.909]  Dr.
[00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.550]  Ryan ran it.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.179]  They're head of global rapid response to emergency.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.900]  They're head of global rapid response, emergency rapid response.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.559]  It was completely official.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.739]  The document was only removed on March 26, 2023.
[00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:41.360]  During the entire intervening time, the plan survived on the CDC's public site with little to no public notice or controversy.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:50.159]  It was called the Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing and Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.559]  By absence or empirical data, the meaning is nothing.
[00:40:56.519 --> 00:40:58.059]  Nothing like this has ever been tried.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:04.059]  The point of the document was to map out how it would be possible to alert authorities to possible pitfalls to be avoided.
[00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:10.519]  I'll cover this all in full detail coming up on tomorrow's main Infowars show.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.880]  We could be easily shut off.
[00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:19.059]  Wednesday, when it's up for sale, if a good guy doesn't buy it, there's been all sorts of tricks, all sorts of dirty pool.
[00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:23.239]  Fed's coming without warrants or orders 14 weeks ago to close this.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.219]  I stood up against him, said, give me your court order.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:26.659]  They didn't.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.500]  The judge fired him.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.769]  The U.S. trustee from the Justice Department The Justice Department asked me in my case.
[00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:32.809]  Under law, they can come in.
[00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:33.690]  The judge can fire them.
[00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.690]  They tried to do that outside of law.
[00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.150]  Literal vigilantism.
[00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:39.909]  So I knew they were about to kill Trump when that happened.
[00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.389]  I said, they're going to try to kill him imminently.
[00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:42.829]  They're getting ready for martial law.
[00:41:42.909 --> 00:41:43.670]  This isn't about me.
[00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:45.369]  What's the Justice Department here doing this?
[00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.489]  They've been ordered to do it.
[00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.110]  And now the Federal Reserve says it's above the law.
[00:41:49.409 --> 00:41:53.409]  And Rachel Maddow is calling on military media and millions of Americans to defy Trump administration.
[00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:54.449]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.909]  This is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:16.030]  So all of these quarantine plans and all this monkeypox crap, all of this is coming together right now, and I think it's one of the main ways they're going to try to derail Trump, either assassinate him, launch a large, massive war to distract us all, a new viral release.
[00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.389]  I mean, you can just see it.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.179]  Absolutely coming down the pike.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.440]  And we have to get ahead of this and point this out and say, we're not going to buy it this time.
[00:42:25.639 --> 00:42:33.679]  And remember, last year, from sources in the TSA and then the Border Patrol, I broke in August.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:43.099]  They were planning by September and October to start mandates in blue cities, then masks, then the six feet crap, and then quarantines on COVID-19.
[00:42:44.019 --> 00:43:01.239]  And hyping up and turning up the PCR test and sending those out and then setting them to 35 times what they're supposed to be set so somebody who's totally healthy has COVID or people tested papayas and tomatoes and watermelons and they all had COVID because you just turn up the sensor and it says everybody's got it.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.320]  The same one with the metal detector.
[00:43:02.739 --> 00:43:05.500]  You can set it to gold, silver, steel, iron.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.320]  You can just go buy them at the store.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.820]  You can be going around a field set low.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.860]  It'll actually be fine.
[00:43:11.019 --> 00:43:11.460]  Beep, beep, beep.
[00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:13.000]  A little piece of silver, a little piece of gold.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.659]  Little piece of iron.
[00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:22.000]  But you can put one up in the air where there is no silver or gold or iron and turn up a sensitivity all the way and it goes...
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.619]  Because the sensitivity is turned up so much, it just sees everything as gold or silver or iron.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.940]  And that's what the PCR test is, basically.
[00:43:31.019 --> 00:43:31.639]  It's more sophisticated.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:40.369]  So you set it 25, 40 times that, you get more COVID. And then when people had regular colds or flus, they wouldn't let them into the hospital or to the doctor.
[00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:41.690]  They said, sorry, COVID only.
[00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:46.909]  And then those would progress and kill people because they have no immune systems anymore from all the previous antibiotics and drugs.
[00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.969]  Now they've got to have them to live when they get a regular sickness.
[00:43:49.389 --> 00:44:00.489]  That's why you need the elderberry and the vitamins and the minerals and the CoQ10 and all those things because that's the natural things to boost what's already been attacked.
[00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.170]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.760]  And I wanted to come in tonight.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.119]  You know, I'm exhausted.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.079]  Only slept...
[00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:14.070]  Couple hours Monday, couple hours Tuesday, got a little bit of sleep last night.
[00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:19.110]  I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open here, but we have to have maximum effort against the globalists.
[00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:35.949]  We can't have this beachhead and this big victory with Trump and overriding their fraud and all the rest of it, and then just sit here and say, well, we hope he gets in in 70-something days, and we hope he gets good people in, and we hope somebody doesn't kill him, and we hope they don't release a new virus, and we hope they don't launch a new war when all that's on the table.
[00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:39.840]  While the regime is still in power for 70-something days.
[00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:41.380]  They are so pissed.
[00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:43.820]  They know Trump's going to put good people on the Justice Department.
[00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:46.900]  And they're going to try to make their moves.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.699]  And people shouldn't be so naive.
[00:44:49.699 --> 00:44:59.280]  Now, when I learned that they were going to try all that last year, we went on air, we exposed it, and they didn't even care that I'd expose it.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.039]  It was a huge story.
[00:45:01.429 --> 00:45:02.510]  And then people went, wait.
[00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:07.429]  And like two weeks later, other witnesses came out and said, yeah, we were told it's coming in a couple months too.
[00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:15.670]  And then they still rolled it out and tried the lockdowns and the masks and the blue cities and all of it and the distancing and the plexiglass.
[00:45:15.869 --> 00:45:17.550]  And people went, wait, Alex Jones said that.
[00:45:17.869 --> 00:45:21.550]  And then Congress came out and Trump came out and said, don't do it again.
[00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:27.610]  And so that's a perfect example of getting ahead of these people.
[00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:29.550]  And that's what we've got to do.
[00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:30.510]  All right?
[00:45:32.739 --> 00:45:33.840]  Look at this Maddow story.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.039]  MSNBC Maddow calls on military media and millions of Americans to defy Trump administration.
[00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:47.679]  Democrat news anchor news tells citizens to get back in shape so they can physically fight an authoritarian Trump regime.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.760]  You know, I meant to tell you guys to grab this video.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.099]  Grab it.
[00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:50.760]  I want to play it.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.719]  Let me know when you got it.
[00:45:52.159 --> 00:45:53.840]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:55.699]  So we're the ones that are going to be violent.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.320]  We're the ones that are going to kill you with the military.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.840]  We're the ones that are going to, you know...
[00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:14.710]  Do all this, and then they're the ones that sign executive orders for martial law, killing U.S. citizens, and that administration, the Harris-Biden coup, That stole the election four years ago, failed a few days ago.
[00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:17.150]  They're the ones that sign all this and get it ready.
[00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:22.050]  And then now Carville said we're going to have armed uprisings if Trump gets reelected.
[00:46:22.389 --> 00:46:24.510]  Black men need to rise up because Trump's coming to kill you.
[00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.909]  I played the clip like 25 times.
[00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.269]  It was three weeks ago.
[00:46:27.449 --> 00:46:27.949]  You want to see it again?
[00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.110]  Don't believe me?
[00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.630]  Just type it in.
[00:46:29.769 --> 00:46:31.030]  Carville calls for armed uprisings.
[00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.789]  It's everywhere.
[00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:38.289]  And Raskin, one of their main technicians in Congress, says they're not going to certify and that he's going to attack everybody.
[00:46:38.289 --> 00:46:42.610]  That means they're getting ready for false flags during this 70-something days, obviously.
[00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:44.230]  It doesn't make sense if they don't.
[00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.809]  To blame Trump and his supporters.
[00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:50.210]  And the Justice Department still has got all the crooks at the top.
[00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:57.130]  They're going to, you know, obviously try to persecute Trump supporters more to intimidate people or threaten to put them in prison if they don't lie about Trump or General Flynn.
[00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.489]  I think that's what the Alfie Oaks thing's about.
[00:46:58.570 --> 00:46:59.590]  That's what everything points at.
[00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:09.969]  And so everybody thinking just because they conceded and, you know, say we want to be nice and friendly, their surrogates are all out there saying, no, we're not.
[00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.670]  So let's read over some of this.
[00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:21.030]  Oh, okay.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.659]  But we're supposed to censor everybody and legal stuff, though, to submit to the liberals.
[00:47:38.179 --> 00:47:43.559]  Speaking of Democrats feeling dismayed by the outcome of this week's election, Manow said, history doesn't end.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.840]  Time doesn't stop.
[00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:48.760]  Now we have the benefit of knowing how this has gone in every other country.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.320]  Oh, yeah.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.900]  That's what they're doing.
[00:47:51.079 --> 00:47:54.239]  That has been through a democracy to authoritarian transition.
[00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:55.000]  That's what they're doing.
[00:47:55.099 --> 00:47:56.059]  This is all projection.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.760]  And sadly, there are a lot of them.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.960]  We have the benefit of seeing what's happening in those other countries.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:12.420]  And we know that the more ground the authoritarian takes, the harder it is to ever get that ground back.
[00:48:12.679 --> 00:48:14.780]  Wow, I could have said that about them.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.760]  I mean, that's really what they're doing.
[00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:29.909]  We're good to go.
[00:48:39.099 --> 00:48:42.860]  The country is going to let them go without pushing back, without protest.
[00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:50.159]  So Trump just wants to control the border, defend the sovereignty of the nation, stop the wars, find the stolen children.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.639]  And they're the ones that have been censoring and attacking and arresting and all this.
[00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:57.719]  But they're saying Trump's going to do that.
[00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:14.869]  And then she goes on to say the mainstream media anchor tried to mobilize Harris supporters saying they're counting on all those tens of millions of Americans to be despondent, to feel powerless, which of course would mean letting them do what they want.
[00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.690]  I'm sorry, there's a Bitcoin graphic on here that doesn't let me read it.
[00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.070]  Can we put that on screen since we can't have the video?
[00:49:21.989 --> 00:49:31.110]  Yeah, just put it on screen and then scroll down to the paragraph right here because the way this printed with this Bitcoin icon, I can't read that.
[00:49:32.849 --> 00:49:33.889]  All right, stop right there.
[00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:39.590]  You know what?
[00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.489]  I'm going to get the clip.
[00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:43.909]  Aaron ad, I'm going to...
[00:49:45.179 --> 00:49:46.300]  Okay, the Man Out Crip is ready.
[00:49:47.519 --> 00:49:48.280]  I'm just exhausted.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.260]  This crew is exhausted, too.
[00:49:49.639 --> 00:49:58.639]  I just want to show you this, and I want to be able to go over this, because these are sick people, and they're criminals, and they're not going to give up.
[00:49:58.639 --> 00:49:59.440]  They think we're stupid.
[00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:06.059]  Now, more and more people are waking up, and they're not going to win no matter what they do, but it's going to get really bad if these people stage violence and get a civil war going.
[00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:08.219]  And so I'm really trying to stop them.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:08.659]  Thanks, guys.
[00:50:08.719 --> 00:50:09.360]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:09.679]  Here it is.
[00:50:10.679 --> 00:50:12.059]  But now history doesn't end.
[00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:12.980]  Time doesn't stop.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:22.760]  Now we have the benefit of knowing how this has gone in every other country that has been through a democracy to authoritarian transition.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.980]  And sadly, there are a lot of them.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.960]  We have the benefit of seeing what's happened in those other countries, though.
[00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:37.179]  And what we know is that the more ground the authoritarian takes, the harder it is to ever get that ground back.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:48.019]  And so the first order of business is to stop them from taking any uncontested ground right from the outset when it comes to what our system of government is and what our democracy is.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:48.400]  Right?
[00:50:48.539 --> 00:51:02.460]  From other countries' experiences that quickly, I mean now, in the next few weeks, if not the next few days, they are going to start pushing to see how far the country is going to let them go without pushback, without protest.
[00:51:04.159 --> 00:51:09.199]  Part of this is because it's just psychologically advantageous for them to do this now, right?
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:16.119]  They're counting on the half the country that voted against them, the half the country that doesn't want to give up our system of government.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:22.039]  They're counting on all those tens of millions of Americans to be despondent, to feel powerless, to check out.
[00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:28.199]  Which, of course, would mean letting them do what they want, letting them run the table.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:36.230]  What they really don't want It's for the half the country that voted against them, the half the country that wants to keep our democracy.
[00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:43.250]  What they really don't want is for those tens of millions of Americans to wake up tomorrow feeling scrappy as hell.
[00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:54.769]  Feeling, sure, regretful about the election outcome, but also, frankly, freed up from having to spend all of our time working on the election, so now we can work full-time on being freaking pirates.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:03.079]  I'm being a thorn in the side to anyone who now intends to try to turn this country into some tin pot tyranny.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:24.139]  What they want least of all is to realize that half the country went to bed sad tonight, but then woke up tomorrow fired up with a new sense of purpose, knowing that apparently this is what we're on this earth to do as American citizens in this generation.
[00:52:24.869 --> 00:52:26.630]  Because history did not just end.
[00:52:26.849 --> 00:52:28.309]  Time did not just stop.
[00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:46.090]  We just got marching orders from the university and the electoral college that as of today, American citizens who do want to hold on to democracy, we know exactly what we're going to be spending the next days and weeks and likely years of our life working on.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:59.739]  And the strategic first moves come into focus quickly when you think about what other countries have shown us about how hard it is to regain democratic ground once an authoritarian leader has taken that ground.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:09.739]  And the work has to be done now, the work that has to be done now, it has to happen in sort of every aspect, every corner of our society.
[00:53:10.579 --> 00:53:21.940]  The U.S. military needs to give the American people Binding assurances that they will not deploy US military force against the civilian population in this country.
[00:53:22.159 --> 00:53:25.260]  They can give those assurances and now they should.
[00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:34.630]  The free press needs to give the people of this country assurances that they will not become state TV, that they will stand and fight together.
[00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:38.449]  They will put aside rivalries and petty professional differences.
[00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:45.670]  They will stand and fight together as the free press, as the fourth estate, as an institution that is a pillar of our demise.
[00:53:45.869 --> 00:54:01.369]  As these guys on the other side inevitably start picking off individual journalists, individual publishers, individual news organizations to try ultimately to turn us all into some American-accented version of RT. I mean,
[00:54:01.449 --> 00:54:02.309]  this is just stunning.
[00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:06.590]  Everything she said on my main show tomorrow, I'm going to spend like 30 minutes on this.
[00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.269]  I'm going to start it and stop it.
[00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:11.050]  Because they've been picking us off.
[00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:11.989]  They've been arresting us.
[00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.869]  They've been censoring us.
[00:54:12.969 --> 00:54:13.769]  They've been surveilling us.
[00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:14.730]  They've been harassing us.
[00:54:14.949 --> 00:54:23.849]  Back under Obama, Lois Lerner, hundreds of thousands of conservatives audited and harassed and many arrested and conservative organizations by the IRS. And they said, yeah, it's political.
[00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:24.550]  Of course it is.
[00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:29.050]  And we elected Trump, despite all your fraud.
[00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:31.329]  But you heard what she said there.
[00:54:31.989 --> 00:54:38.530]  She said, don't use the military on the people when they've signed the orders and have the military ready for martial law and to kill citizens.
[00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:44.050]  That was done in September by whoever runs this administration that's still in power for another 73 days.
[00:54:44.889 --> 00:54:51.789]  And then Blumenthal said a year ago, if Trump gets back in, they've introduced a bill that he can't deploy the military domestically when they have an uprising.
[00:54:51.929 --> 00:54:52.829]  So it's clear.
[00:54:52.969 --> 00:54:55.210]  They're going to false flag some minorities.
[00:54:58.289 --> 00:55:01.449]  We're good to go.
[00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.449]  I mean, they've told you what they're planning.
[00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:25.329]  I don't know exactly how they're going to execute it or when, but it's the final pieces as I've been harping and harping and harping.
[00:55:25.409 --> 00:55:31.349]  I told everybody, he's winning in a landslide, but it's got to be a landslide to override the fraud.
[00:55:31.429 --> 00:55:33.150]  There's only so much fraud they can bake in.
[00:55:33.289 --> 00:55:37.469]  I've interviewed all the professors, the scientists, the computer scientists, the voting experts.
[00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.190]  I've been covering elections for over 30 years.
[00:55:40.369 --> 00:55:41.769]  Listeners kept saying, which is it?
[00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:43.349]  Is it they're going to steal or they aren't?
[00:55:43.469 --> 00:55:45.269]  No, they're going to try to steal it.
[00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:48.610]  And we've got to override him.
[00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:53.289]  And he still had a moderate landslide, the popular and the electoral.
[00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:54.769]  So we did daily.
[00:55:56.250 --> 00:56:00.349]  And Trump came out the day after I did last Saturday, came out Sunday and said, they're trying to steal it.
[00:56:00.429 --> 00:56:00.949]  You got to vote.
[00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:02.269]  And he said, they do steal it.
[00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:03.170]  We got to expose it.
[00:56:03.269 --> 00:56:04.550]  We'll never have a free election again.
[00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:09.489]  And people were like, oh, because people Saturday like, wait, you're saying they're going to steal it.
[00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.530]  And I said, no, they're trying to steal it.
[00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.530]  And so you have to admit it.
[00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.210]  You have to have the poll watchers, the lawyers.
[00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.909]  Trump did it.
[00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:18.170]  You supported Trump.
[00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.750]  They took over the RNC with his daughter-in-law, and we did it.
[00:56:22.989 --> 00:56:24.389]  And let me show you some more here.
[00:56:24.909 --> 00:56:25.670]  Look at this.
[00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:34.809]  Trump didn't just win in every swing state, but he also atomized decades of Democrat apparatus building.
[00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:35.789]  This is California.
[00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:38.610]  Because of MAGA, it's now in play for future cycles.
[00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.130]  And that's because California's really red, folks.
[00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:41.849]  Everybody hates it.
[00:56:41.949 --> 00:56:42.349]  Almost everybody.
[00:56:42.809 --> 00:56:45.750]  But they control the election machines completely, like New York.
[00:56:46.449 --> 00:56:47.369]  So it's very hard.
[00:56:47.429 --> 00:56:52.030]  But you can override it because there's only so many votes in the system, so much they can flip, then they can get caught.
[00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:53.570]  That takes an hour to describe.
[00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:56.289]  But people need to get sophisticated and understand that.
[00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:57.849]  This is what it was four years ago.
[00:56:57.969 --> 00:56:58.510]  This is it now.
[00:56:58.610 --> 00:56:59.210]  I mean, look at that.
[00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:00.989]  Look at that.
[00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.409]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.510]  This is progress.
[00:57:06.329 --> 00:57:07.550]  This is us winning.
[00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:10.070]  And it's very exciting.
[00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:15.550]  And I wouldn't be here, you know, 10 years ago promoting the Republican Party.
[00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:16.929]  They were almost as bad as the Democrats.
[00:57:17.389 --> 00:57:21.050]  But the Democrat Party is now completely New World Order, literally at war.
[00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:24.889]  And her whole thing was the other half of the country are your enemies.
[00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:25.909]  They're totalitarians.
[00:57:25.989 --> 00:57:26.550]  Get in shape.
[00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:27.469]  Get scrappy.
[00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.150]  Get ready.
[00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:29.210]  And that's like kill Trump.
[00:57:29.469 --> 00:57:31.750]  I mean, that's we're going to war.
[00:57:31.889 --> 00:57:33.130]  We need the military to be ready.
[00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:34.369]  We got to get scrappy.
[00:57:34.429 --> 00:57:35.329]  We got to get in shape.
[00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.550]  We got to be pirates.
[00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:40.039]  Pirates, rob and kill people.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.940]  I mean, that was a declaration of war by Matt O. That was a big deal.
[00:57:47.699 --> 00:57:48.679]  That was disgusting.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.380]  That was sick.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.440]  Now, I've been trying to get Mike Benz on a lot.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.079]  He's really smart.
[00:57:53.079 --> 00:57:53.820]  I agree with him.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.760]  He covers everything I've been covering for decades, but he does it in a really eloquent way.
[00:57:57.099 --> 00:58:02.199]  He said some nice stuff about me today on X, so maybe he'll stop ignoring my producers and we can get him on.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.980]  But he...
[00:58:05.019 --> 00:58:08.440]  Talked about social media interference and how you deal with it.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.260]  And this is the law.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:14.619]  It's illegal to have the government instructing private corporations to censor people.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.119]  Now, if you own a newspaper and you don't want to publish what somebody says, you own it, you can do it, you're a publisher.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:25.260]  But under the federal law, these utilities, and that's what Google and all of them operate as, like a telephone...
[00:58:29.019 --> 00:58:29.940]  They're not allowed to do that.
[00:58:30.199 --> 00:58:32.360]  That's all serious felony crimes.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.780]  That came out in Congress the last few years.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.320]  I experienced it, told you many years ago it was happening because we have the documents.
[00:58:38.619 --> 00:58:49.659]  But this is what Trump needs to do with these executive orders, and it's not totalitarian to use executive power when it's in the Constitution to say the government doesn't illegally go around telling companies what to do.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.059]  The government's supposed to have warrants, court orders.
[00:58:53.559 --> 00:59:00.480]  Just like when the Justice Department 14, 15 weeks ago ordered us shut down without a court order and sent a private security firm in.
[00:59:00.579 --> 00:59:05.960]  When this private security firm came in with guns on their sides and said, you know, they were just nice, normal people.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]  We're here to shut this down.
[00:59:08.119 --> 00:59:08.960]  I said, well, where's your court order?
[00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:12.250]  Well, there's a...
[00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.250]  And they got on the phones and they're like, well, the lawyer says she's a U.S. trustee.
[00:59:17.469 --> 00:59:20.530]  And I've done interviews with them online and been interrogated about them.
[00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:21.090]  I met them in person.
[00:59:21.269 --> 00:59:23.150]  When they talk to you, there's a big Justice Department...
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.260]  There was a shield behind them.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:36.059]  So they got on the Zooms with the owner of this company and told them, no, I'm on the phone with the owner of the company going, listen, you can't just come in some place without a, well, this person's with the Justice Department.
[00:59:36.219 --> 00:59:36.880]  Well, that's illegal.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.300]  And did you ever hear of someone shutting a business down?
[00:59:41.059 --> 00:59:44.139]  And it's not the federal marshals or the constable?
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:44.900]  It's the county?
[00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:46.360]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:46.880]  We're not doing it.
[00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:51.139]  So, and I told listeners that, and they're like, where's the video?
[00:59:51.679 --> 00:59:53.739]  This sounds crazy and impossible.
[00:59:55.059 --> 01:00:00.239]  I wasn't trying to escalate, and I was there.
[01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:04.059]  I went on air while they were there, and I said, I'm going to call the police if they try to kick us out of here.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.940]  And then I knew if I didn't sleep there, they'd try to do it again the next day, and they did.
[01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:15.590]  So, and then a week later, it was in federal court that it was all the news.
[01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.670]  They had indeed done it.
[01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:26.650]  And he said to the U.S. trustee and to their CRO, which again, the Justice Department can come into a bankruptcy if it's a corporation.
[01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.170]  They don't do it, hardly ever.
[01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.429]  But like Enron or something, they do.
[01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:31.929]  And so they're in the depositions.
[01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.389]  They're there.
[01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:35.610]  They can assign these people.
[01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:38.570]  And they assign them.
[01:00:38.849 --> 01:00:43.170]  And then just through color of law, They just said, shut us down.
[01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:45.969]  That's vigilantism.
[01:00:46.289 --> 01:00:49.750]  And what you just saw from Maddow is vigilantism.
[01:00:49.949 --> 01:00:51.050]  We're going to be pirates.
[01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.889]  We're going to get tough.
[01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.130]  The military is going to do this.
[01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.650]  We're going to go after these people.
[01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:55.610]  We're getting in shape.
[01:00:55.769 --> 01:00:56.570]  We're ready for war.
[01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.190]  These people are Nazis.
[01:00:58.349 --> 01:01:00.250]  These people are going to overthrow our country.
[01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:01.510]  They're going to come after everybody.
[01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.230]  We're not going to let them have an inch of ground.
[01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:05.610]  And they're all saying it.
[01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:06.630]  Carville said it weeks ago.
[01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.369]  He's coming for the black men.
[01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:09.610]  He's coming for them.
[01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.349]  We've got to have an uprising if he gets president-elect.
[01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:14.210]  And I'm like...
[01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.530]  And Raskin's saying similar things.
[01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:24.369]  And now they've raided Alfie Oaks that's friends with Flynn and a big Trump booster who sent a bunch of buses to January 6th.
[01:01:24.469 --> 01:01:27.050]  Not to the Capitol, but to the public speech.
[01:01:27.449 --> 01:01:30.110]  And they're in the news before saying maybe he'll get indicted.
[01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:30.949]  Maybe he's involved.
[01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:32.190]  Maybe he's the new Proud Boy.
[01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:34.010]  Ridiculous.
[01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:38.730]  So, and the military was there today.
[01:01:39.809 --> 01:01:42.309]  And I said that earlier in a post.
[01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.269]  It was in the report.
[01:01:43.469 --> 01:01:44.090]  And it was there.
[01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.289]  The military's not there.
[01:01:45.429 --> 01:01:46.289]  Jones, let me see the proof.
[01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:47.530]  Well, watch the damn report.
[01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:48.690]  It was only like five minutes long.
[01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:51.030]  We can put it on screen for you.
[01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:53.849]  Look, I know this isn't normal.
[01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:54.710]  I know.
[01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:55.869]  It sounds crazy.
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:01.969]  There's 325,000 missing kids that Kamala Harris brought in with Mayorkas on record and disappeared on purpose.
[01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:04.210]  I mean, that doesn't sound true, but it's all admitted now.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.519]  I mean, saying two men can have a baby doesn't sound real.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:11.139]  Bill Guy, the science guy, his new kid show, says there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.900]  That's complete horse crap.
[01:02:14.199 --> 01:02:16.900]  So, I mean, I'm sorry these people are out of control.
[01:02:17.059 --> 01:02:19.199]  I'm sorry they got plans to put you in quarantine camps.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.079]  I mean, I'm sorry all this is going on.
[01:02:21.139 --> 01:02:22.280]  I'm sorry we got a case of tyranny.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:26.539]  But these self-appointed globalists Like Mr.
[01:02:26.679 --> 01:02:29.679]  Maddow, we're raised and put in colleges and told they're the ruling class.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.099]  You're supposed to do what they say.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.440]  They're the totalitarian.
[01:02:32.619 --> 01:02:33.139]  They're the boss.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:33.760]  They're the master.
[01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:36.980]  You know, if you take the shot, you can't get COVID and you can't spread it.
[01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:37.880]  So take the damn shot.
[01:02:38.059 --> 01:02:40.639]  Who's getting paid $89,000 a day to say that?
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.679]  Buy Pfizer separately from her paycheck.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:44.860]  All right.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.860]  I want to salute the crew.
[01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:48.800]  They have been busting their ass.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.659]  We just really appreciate them.
[01:02:58.539 --> 01:03:09.039]  And I've been striving to raise money so that if we do get shut down next Wednesday, I can continue with the folks we're working for and working with.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.300]  And that's our sponsor, thealksonstore.com.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.440]  Just bigly, one of them's a J6 for himself, facing six years in prison.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.840]  There's a police shield, fell down, and he just picked the shield up and gave it to a cop.
[01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:21.460]  It's on video.
[01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:27.079]  So they're hardcore patriots, big Trump supporters, some of the top t-shirts and products.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.840]  They are helping do all this.
[01:03:31.159 --> 01:03:36.840]  And so when you get the t-shirts, all the new Trump one gear, you get the great supplements at the Alex Jones store.com.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:44.920]  That lets us have the satellite uplinks and the servers and all the stuff and the rebuilding of new websites and a new band.video.
[01:03:45.179 --> 01:03:46.880]  And we're not going to just count on X being there.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.699]  And it costs a lot of money to do that.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.920]  And the legal to battle these globalists while they try to shut us down.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.079]  And we can do it if you stand with us.
[01:03:53.179 --> 01:03:53.719]  These are great products.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.099]  You need them.
[01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:55.360]  The Alex Jones store.com.
[01:03:55.519 --> 01:03:57.320]  But everybody should become a VIP member.
[01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:59.159]  You get 40 bucks a month.
[01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:06.250]  When you sign up month to month for $30, you make $10 on top of it that you can spend on the supplements, on the products.
[01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:13.570]  You get special sales, special offers, special products when you become a VIP there.
[01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.849]  All right, that's it for this emergency transmission.
[01:04:16.949 --> 01:04:23.730]  I've got a couple little announcements that I'm going to play right here, but I just want to remind you all that this is how we find the operation.
[01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:29.030]  Separately, there is another URL run by the same folks.
[01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:36.429]  That has particular fundraising things on it, like limited edition InfoWars posters.
[01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:43.929]  And it's just like a mug if you're a communist globalist and you want to support NPR, PBS, and the mug costs them $5, $6.
[01:04:44.949 --> 01:04:48.530]  But, you know, they say make a $50 donation or $100 donation, you get the mug.
[01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:50.329]  Or the T-shirt might cost them $15.
[01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:51.969]  Give them $100, you get the T-shirt.
[01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:56.250]  Or maybe if you give them $1,000, you get a set of luggage that costs them $300.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.480]  It's great deals at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:03.519]  I mean, hell, when you get the three packs, 75% off, we're not making much money off that.
[01:05:04.159 --> 01:05:13.840]  But when you go to realalexjones.com, it has the three limited edition, historic Alex Jones Infowars posters.
[01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:15.820]  I really love the red and black ones.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.420]  I designed those.
[01:05:16.519 --> 01:05:17.280]  The other one's fun, too.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.099]  I came up with the concept, but they're all fun.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.119]  They're 50 bucks.
[01:05:22.039 --> 01:05:32.960]  That way, when we sell a t-shirt that costs $15 to make, and then you got to pay for the crew and the advertising and their crew and everything, we're not making like five, six bucks a t-shirt that ever actually gets to us.
[01:05:33.099 --> 01:05:34.320]  You got to sell a lot of t-shirts.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:40.780]  But when you have a poster that's glossy and beautiful, and they're actually at the studio now, I need to shoot ads with them tomorrow.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:41.980]  It's been so busy with the election.
[01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:44.320]  You got big, nice posters, frame them.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:49.139]  Those cost like four bucks the poster, a couple more bucks for the tube, and then the ship, you know, all that.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:53.880]  We're going to make 40-something bucks On those, and you know you've donated.
[01:05:54.039 --> 01:05:55.679]  You know you helped keep us on the air.
[01:05:56.539 --> 01:06:03.320]  If InfoWars survives, then it's a piece of history that, you know, the ongoing incredible historic operation, you helped keep it going.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.679]  But if it doesn't survive, you know the spirit of it continued on with the Alex Jones Network.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.619]  So we need to sell these.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.760]  This is a fundraiser.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.000]  There's like thousands, a few thousand of each one.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:22.369]  And the Alex Jones limited edition collectible fundraiser poster and the two InfoWars historic posters They're there.
[01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.289]  And this is how we fund the operation.
[01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:32.449]  And one poster says on it, let's punch those back up because I'm going for memory.
[01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:33.389]  I'm teleprompter free here.
[01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:36.530]  I came up with both designs, but I'm very tired right now.
[01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:38.289]  Infowars lives forever.
[01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:39.750]  And my signature.
[01:06:40.469 --> 01:06:43.050]  That's the white on black with the red signature.
[01:06:45.489 --> 01:06:48.849]  Then there's the red on black that's my favorite.
[01:06:50.699 --> 01:07:00.780]  And it's got another message, 1776 Worldwide, Freedom Worldwide, with my signature as well.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.480]  So they look great.
[01:07:02.599 --> 01:07:03.000]  They're amazing.
[01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.519]  I can't wait to show them to you in the real world.
[01:07:05.619 --> 01:07:06.219]  It's been so busy.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.480]  And then there's this.
[01:07:08.639 --> 01:07:12.639]  Now, there's only 800 and something of these, and already 200 are gone.
[01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:16.550]  This is the 1776 Devastator.
[01:07:16.889 --> 01:07:32.000]  In my view and research, if you had to get into serious defense and the real deal and fighting for your life, This is the classic World War I, World War II, updated, a little more modern design, with a double-edged, basically Roman short sword.
[01:07:32.519 --> 01:07:35.219]  And this is the real deal.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.599]  It's got the brass knuckles built into it.
[01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:39.880]  It's got the skull crusher.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.519]  And you can attack in any direction and defend yourself with this.
[01:07:42.699 --> 01:07:45.780]  This is a short sword.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.980]  This is basically a little bit bigger than this.
[01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:50.159]  This is what Colonel Travis had at the Alamo.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.659]  Something just like this.
[01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:52.750]  All right?
[01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:55.269]  So this is how you do business.
[01:07:55.570 --> 01:08:01.969]  This is how you defend yourself from pirates and criminals and the like, and they attack you.
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.269]  Got my signature on it.
[01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:11.650]  When I say, okay, these posters are really big fundraisers because there's a huge markup, this It doesn't have the giant markup.
[01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:13.989]  I mean, it's got some in it, but this is a really great deal.
[01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:17.810]  The fact that it's signed, it's got 1776, the Betsy Ross flag.
[01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.710]  This is something you really want.
[01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.729]  And this is a promotion only for the Alex Jones Network.
[01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:25.250]  This is only being shown here.
[01:08:25.409 --> 01:08:29.409]  The people over my regular daytime show do not know about the posters yet.
[01:08:29.489 --> 01:08:30.869]  They do not know about the knives.
[01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:32.869]  I wanted to do this for everybody here.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:42.079]  For a lot of reasons, but I also wanted to gauge, you know, just this here, you know, what the support is so I can figure out what we can budget, what we can do.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.960]  And so this will be gone at current sales rates in about a week.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.579]  And we're really, really proud of it.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.319]  I mean, this is an Alex Jones-esque knife.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.340]  I mean, this is something else right here.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.020]  So you got to take care of your family.
[01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.289]  This is it right here.
[01:09:01.949 --> 01:09:02.510]  All right.
[01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:08.289]  And of course, there's also DMONives.com, an Arkansas designer award-winning knives.
[01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:09.829]  They only make a few hundred knives at a time.
[01:09:10.329 --> 01:09:13.689]  This is the DMO Outback.
[01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:17.449]  Super high-quality handmade knife over the top.
[01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:18.989]  There's only 500 of these.
[01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:19.770]  Half of them have sold.
[01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:21.430]  DMONives.com.
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:23.170]  And you know you got a piece of history.
[01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:24.350]  You know you stood up for the Republic.
[01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:30.649]  You know that When it came to game time, you bet on the horse that keeps winning.
[01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.430]  And we are under massive attack.
[01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:35.949]  I don't pull punches one damn bit on what I cover.
[01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:39.550]  I just trust in God, and I trust in God to work through you to support us.
[01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:42.210]  But I really want to keep the full crew employed.
[01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:46.890]  I really want to be able to finish the other bigger studio that's being built.
[01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:49.989]  So much goes into this.
[01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:51.569]  And we're winning in court now.
[01:09:51.569 --> 01:09:52.729]  That's why you don't see it in the news.
[01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.189]  We have a lot of stuff going on that's never even hit the news.
[01:09:55.689 --> 01:09:58.409]  My lawyers are like, well, if it hadn't hit the news, just wait because they don't know what to do.
[01:09:58.949 --> 01:10:00.670]  I mean, we countersued them, everything, folks.
[01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:01.390]  It's not even the news.
[01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:06.310]  So I'm on the offense like you want, but I can't do it without you.
[01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:10.390]  And then also there's another great sponsor that I don't own and it's not me.
[01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:13.289]  It's quite the story.
[01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:18.189]  But, you know what, I was going to air the shorter one, but, you know, the story's pretty cool.
[01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:20.229]  Maybe we should play that first.
[01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:26.550]  Yeah, let's play the long CBD ad, and then I've already talked about the Devastator.
[01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.989]  We don't need to do that.
[01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:32.449]  Let's just play the long CBD ad, because it's an interesting story after this, why you're getting the best deal out there, literally, for quality.
[01:10:33.289 --> 01:10:36.850]  And then there's also the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:38.369]  There is the...
[01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:48.510]  Both fundraiser shirts, those shirts a little bit more there, those two shirts, the others, if you want to pay more, it's kind of like the poster we actually get some real money in.
[01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:49.590]  So there's that.
[01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:50.970]  All right, I'm going to go home.
[01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:55.439]  I'm going to try to get to sleep because I've not had real sleep in three days.
[01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:57.779]  It's so historic.
[01:10:57.899 --> 01:11:00.180]  I can't quit fighting because we're affecting the battle space now.
[01:11:00.279 --> 01:11:02.319]  We're exposing their new plans now.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.939]  We can't sit on our hands now.
[01:11:04.119 --> 01:11:06.399]  I've got tens of millions of new people listening a day conservatively.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.260]  Trump's listening.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:07.939]  They're all listening.
[01:11:08.159 --> 01:11:09.300]  They're agreeing with me.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.779]  I'm interfacing with folks.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:16.060]  30 years of work is just coming to fruition now.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.739]  The crew is putting up with me.
[01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:20.479]  They haven't gotten a bonus in years.
[01:11:21.159 --> 01:11:23.159]  I wish I got some giant Bitcoin donation.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.539]  I'd give them huge bonuses and raises.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.819]  Instead, I'm up against the wall.
[01:11:27.319 --> 01:11:28.539]  So these are great products.
[01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:29.399]  Take action now.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.319]  It's not like you're betting on a pony that doesn't win.
[01:11:31.439 --> 01:11:33.220]  It's not like this is some entertainment show.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.100]  This is a bunch of bull.
[01:11:34.279 --> 01:11:35.079]  I need your help.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:35.800]  You need the products.
[01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:43.550]  DMOKnives.com, TheOxialStore.com, and for all this stuff you really want to help us in the fundraiser where the stuff, you know, it's got some good markup.
[01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:46.710]  Well, not with the knife, but the poster's a gigantic markup.
[01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:47.369]  And what is that?
[01:11:47.829 --> 01:11:49.930]  With the tube and all this stuff, it's probably seven, eight bucks.
[01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:52.529]  So we're making like 40-something bucks on it.
[01:11:52.949 --> 01:11:58.130]  And there's the processing and the maker and the shipping place gets it and, you know, and our partners get part of it.
[01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:02.210]  But with that, they set that side up for us where we get the majority of the money.
[01:12:02.569 --> 01:12:10.939]  And so you go buy one of those babies, you know, we're getting like, I think the number was like $35.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.300]  I mean, that is substantive.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.899]  You buy thousands of those, I can do what I need with that.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:21.779]  And it's a good-looking poster, so why would you not want to have that piece of history and know you had skin in the game?
[01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:22.979]  Because I'll go all the way.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.140]  I'll never stop.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:24.899]  I can put a gun to my head.
[01:12:24.939 --> 01:12:25.260]  You know that.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:25.760]  I'm not stopping.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.079]  But I could give out.
[01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:28.859]  All right, I'm done.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:29.840]  Thank you, respectfully.
[01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.220]  Great job to the crew.
[01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:43.890]  So much more coming, and Lord willing, Harrison Smith tomorrow morning, 8 a.m., myself, 11 a.m., Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m., and we were in that storied building, and, man, I like the crew.
[01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:54.630]  I love the crew, but I'm sick of being there all the time, 15 years, same building, and it gets stressful, and I kind of add some PTSD to it, but, man, them trying to take it away the last 15 weeks and all we've been through and getting so close to the crew.
[01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.750]  I just love them to death, and I love the building now, and I love it all.
[01:12:58.369 --> 01:13:00.329]  So you don't know what you got until it's gone.
[01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:01.010]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:02.109]  I'm like, well, they shut it down.
[01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:02.869]  Let's do something else.
[01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:06.590]  But they see it as a symbol, a Roman standard they want to get.
[01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.369]  They're fighting hard to get some victory.
[01:13:08.989 --> 01:13:10.210]  Let's not give them the victory.
[01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:12.409]  Let's come roaring back here at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:15.590]  And if we get a good buyer and we don't get shut down, that's all great.
[01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.170]  We'll have a new studio for podcasting and stuff.
[01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.670]  But here's the deal.
[01:13:18.609 --> 01:13:20.130]  You can't trust stuff like that.
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:26.869]  You can't just sit there and hope that, oh, maybe the person says they're good and then I got to figure out maybe they say they're good and they come in.
[01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:29.729]  And then they're there.
[01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:31.890]  And, you know, I mean, I have no idea.
[01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:33.529]  I know some of the groups that are good folks.
[01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.250]  They say they're buying it.
[01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.770]  We'll see if they do.
[01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:36.289]  There's some other people say they're good.
[01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.630]  And, you know, once they own your company, I have no idea.
[01:13:39.789 --> 01:13:40.649]  I just know this.
[01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:42.430]  Nobody's getting me to do what they say.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:52.640]  I already had this, you know, the Democrat Party people with the front groups that did the fake lawsuits against me say in mediations, yeah, we just want you to stop doing what you do, stop supporting Trump, stop supporting the Second Amendment.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.319]  My lawyers are like, you can't repeat that.
[01:13:54.439 --> 01:13:55.119]  We had to sign an agreement.
[01:13:55.279 --> 01:14:01.260]  Then my lawyers later called me in Texas and, well, it was mainly in Connecticut, and said, no, you talk about it now.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.020]  They just called us and just ordered it over the phone, demanded it, and said the same crap.
[01:14:06.159 --> 01:14:07.699]  I said, and they didn't even care.
[01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:12.770]  In fact, they admit in the news they don't want me, you know, doing political stuff or whatever.
[01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:13.970]  They want me off the air.
[01:14:14.109 --> 01:14:18.869]  So they're so disconnected, so totalitarian that they're like, we don't care about the money.
[01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:21.510]  Just don't be Alex Jones anymore and you can still do your show.
[01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:25.130]  What am I going to talk about how I love Karl Marx or I love pedophiles or something?
[01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:29.869]  And now I want to disarm old ladies while politicians have armed guards paid for by taxpayers?
[01:14:31.989 --> 01:14:34.250]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.090]  No, I can't join you.
[01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:36.710]  It's spiritual.
[01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:40.109]  It's in my DNA. It's in my bones.
[01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:45.770]  Like Ezekiel says in Ezekiel, he's out prophesying and telling them they're doing wrong stuff.
[01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:47.569]  And they said, we're going to kill you.
[01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:51.930]  And he says to God, he says, God, they're going to kill me.
[01:14:51.989 --> 01:14:53.550]  I don't want to die, but I can't stop.
[01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:55.250]  It's burning in my bones.
[01:14:57.210 --> 01:14:58.470]  I'm exactly the same way.
[01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:59.409]  I'm not saying I'm Ezekiel.
[01:14:59.489 --> 01:15:00.529]  I'm saying I can't stop.
[01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:12.069]  I mean, you don't think I don't know the stuff that I do is super dangerous when I'm running around with Trump and Flynn and organizing that we prosecute Mayorkas and the whole rings and it's all out in the open.
[01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.529]  We'll get them.
[01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:13.529]  We'll bring down their whole system.
[01:15:13.689 --> 01:15:14.750]  I mean, that's the Death Star.
[01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:16.189]  You blow them up move.
[01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:18.069]  They don't like that.
[01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.590]  They're arrogant.
[01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.649]  They want our children.
[01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:21.609]  They think they own us.
[01:15:21.829 --> 01:15:23.470]  They poisoned us with poison shots.
[01:15:23.569 --> 01:15:24.310]  They knew what they were doing.
[01:15:24.529 --> 01:15:25.390]  They think we're lab rats.
[01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:27.189]  They want us dead so the planet's there.
[01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:29.430]  They're little pencil neck control freak monsters.
[01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:30.590]  Screw them!
[01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.909]  Fuck them!
[01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.109]  God damn it!
[01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:35.050]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:38.449]  Zapata and many others said it.
[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:39.729]  So people say, who first said it?
[01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:40.829]  I mean, Julius Caesar said it.
[01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:44.069]  It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:52.710]  Well, in my experience, in studying history and culture in my own life, you end up dying on your knees a lot quicker than you do living on your feet.
[01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:53.630]  So I'll say this.
[01:15:53.770 --> 01:16:05.109]  I'm going to live and be successful and victorious over the tyrants with God's help and guidance and discernment while you little globalists can die on your knees.
[01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:06.649]  Okay?
[01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:10.649]  So, I'm winning on my feet, not dying on my knees.
[01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:13.949]  It's better to win on your feet than die on your knees.
[01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:17.430]  So, burning in my bones, baby.
[01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:20.989]  Alright, that's it for the transmission.
[01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:21.750]  Great job, crew.
[01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:24.409]  I'll be arrested tomorrow.
[01:16:24.609 --> 01:16:26.729]  I'm going to go to town on this because I'm sure of their plan now.
[01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:29.770]  I was already sure, but now I'm totally sure they're going with it.
[01:16:30.109 --> 01:16:33.930]  False flags are imminent, but we're many steps ahead of them and we just admit it.
[01:16:36.609 --> 01:16:37.329]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:37.949 --> 01:16:44.130]  Remember, I called to the minute when Trump was going to come out on the stage hours before.
[01:16:44.529 --> 01:16:45.170]  How'd I do that?
[01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:47.649]  Ask yourselves how I did that.
[01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:50.529]  And I saw people go, oh, this is...
[01:16:50.529 --> 01:16:51.850]  What is this?
[01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:53.909]  I mean, I know what it is.
[01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:56.649]  And I'm awed by it.
[01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:57.750]  I don't understand it all.
[01:16:58.069 --> 01:17:00.689]  But this stuff happens to me all the time, and I just kind of keep it in my vest.
[01:17:01.289 --> 01:17:02.789]  So I'm told God...
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.720]  I mean, I'll do it 50 times in a row if you want, because it's never wrong.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.340]  But it's like the presence, like, instead of the back of my hair standing up, if it's evil or demonic, and we've all felt that.
[01:17:14.479 --> 01:17:18.199]  It's like a warm but pressure, and it's like right on the back of my head and neck.
[01:17:18.359 --> 01:17:20.279]  It's like, ooh, okay.
[01:17:21.159 --> 01:17:28.100]  If I follow what the angels, God, you know, tells me it's never wrong.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:38.500]  So if I feel that right now, and then God tells me, this is a way for you to show people, that's how God kind of puts the finger on the scale with folks.
[01:17:39.119 --> 01:17:41.880]  And, I mean, let me explain something to you.
[01:17:42.869 --> 01:17:45.930]  I've already shared some of this, okay, but I've not shared a lot of it.
[01:17:46.569 --> 01:17:49.050]  I've told the story probably 50 times in the last year alone.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:54.479]  Of 25, 26 years ago, after my Access TV show, I already had a local radio show.
[01:17:54.739 --> 01:17:56.239]  I was at a little restaurant.
[01:17:56.979 --> 01:17:57.760]  Nobody was in it.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.479]  Nine o'clock at night.
[01:17:58.579 --> 01:17:59.199]  Got a chicken fried steak.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:17:59.800]  Got a nice tea.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.659]  Ladies mopping, cleaning.
[01:18:02.079 --> 01:18:05.060]  And all of a sudden, I felt this big presence in the room.
[01:18:05.119 --> 01:18:05.960]  Like, it's bigger.
[01:18:07.079 --> 01:18:08.279]  Like, you can see it.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:08.800]  It's like...
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.359]  I was like, oh, what's going on here?
[01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:11.720]  And I was like, did somebody put something in my drink?
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.500]  All of a sudden, it's like...
[01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.840]  You want, you really want to fight evil?
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:24.659]  And it's like in my mind, but like each word is like super complex and all this information is like, and then it's like download.
[01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:34.479]  And then first it's like sign the contract and this is what's going to happen to you depending on the different futures that you will decide and the public will decide in free will because it's a bunch of different futures.
[01:18:34.989 --> 01:18:39.449]  And God already knows what future you're going to take, but you're still given the free will to make those decisions.
[01:18:39.909 --> 01:18:49.810]  And so I'm showing all these different futures, different scenarios, different horrible things that could happen to me, just like real fast, like bam, [...] because, you know, my spirit could see it.
[01:18:49.949 --> 01:18:53.210]  My cerebral cortex is just a limited focus in this body, so it couldn't even understand it.
[01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:58.340]  But I was like, uh, and then it's like, Now, do you agree to do the thing?
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.239]  Do you want this?
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:00.239]  You've been praying for this.
[01:19:00.359 --> 01:19:00.840]  You've been asking for this.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.899]  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to sign it.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:02.739]  Boom.
[01:19:02.979 --> 01:19:03.239]  Okay.
[01:19:03.619 --> 01:19:04.060]  Get ready.
[01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:09.960]  And then, you know, for days, just kind of like driving the car, I had to pull over.
[01:19:12.619 --> 01:19:21.239]  And it was just because, you know, it has to limit it in print on the spirit, but also, you know, the brain's getting this, so it's electrochemical, like loading the information.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.659]  And then I was just like, a different person.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:30.539]  And now I'm It's happened other times throughout my life, but then I could be in bed, I could be walking.
[01:19:31.779 --> 01:19:42.189]  About three weeks ago, I was in a little warehouse in the office, and I went and got a Topo Chico, and I was walking out in the morning, and I was all of a sudden like, Get ready.
[01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:49.550]  And it was like, and instead it was just like being empowered, like energy and understanding.
[01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:50.750]  And I was like, wow, thank you.
[01:19:50.989 --> 01:19:54.270]  I was just like, I had to like lean up against the wall for about two minutes.
[01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:56.510]  I mean, this is amazing, people.
[01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:58.630]  You really want to worship God.
[01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:00.390]  You really want to ask the Holy Spirit in your heart.
[01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:02.909]  And because this is an adventure.
[01:20:03.069 --> 01:20:05.449]  I mean, you're like, go be scared of these people.
[01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:06.630]  I mean, I don't want to die.
[01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:07.350]  I like living.
[01:20:07.489 --> 01:20:08.930]  I want to be here to take care of my kids and everything.
[01:20:10.029 --> 01:20:12.170]  But I'm just kind of like, you know what, I'm going to die anyway someday.
[01:20:12.289 --> 01:20:13.189]  I'm like, screw it, whatever.
[01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:15.489]  You're going to come kill me, put me in prison, whatever.
[01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:18.270]  Man, hey, I'll be directly jacked into this.
[01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:19.109]  I'm not worried about it.
[01:20:19.909 --> 01:20:21.829]  And God's like, yeah, it's the children.
[01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:24.029]  You said you care about children.
[01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:25.289]  You said you want to stand up for the children.
[01:20:25.489 --> 01:20:26.350]  You ready to do it?
[01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:28.489]  Yes.
[01:20:28.689 --> 01:20:32.909]  Okay, I'm going to just show you a little bit here because God's not like the devil that tricks you and does all this.
[01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:37.710]  If God's really going to ask you to go on a crusade, God's going to say, let me just give you a little idea here.
[01:20:38.569 --> 01:20:40.109]  And I'm like, why is there all these scenarios?
[01:20:40.329 --> 01:20:40.710]  It's instant.
[01:20:40.829 --> 01:20:41.930]  You know, I'm showing you different futures.
[01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:46.289]  And I'm like, while I'm doing this, I'm learning how the universe works just in the data.
[01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.989]  It's not just that.
[01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:52.010]  I'm being taught how to interpret it in live time and getting all this above the horizon, over the horizon knowledge.
[01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:53.829]  I'm like, wow, this is incredible!
[01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:56.130]  Brain boost, folks!
[01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:08.930]  Look, and as the enemy throws everything they've got against us, God's just going to turn up our gifts.
[01:21:10.109 --> 01:21:11.130]  That's how this works.
[01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:11.789]  All right, I'm done.
[01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:12.409]  Love you, crew.
[01:21:12.829 --> 01:21:13.510]  Love everybody.
[01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:15.649]  They're getting ready for total martial law.
[01:21:15.789 --> 01:21:16.529]  We're going to stop them.
[01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:18.909]  We're breaking their will with God's power right now.
[01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:20.270]  Stay with us.
[01:21:21.489 --> 01:21:27.270]  What I'm about to break down can benefit you in multiple ways, three different ways.
[01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:44.250]  Number one, it will keep this transmission against the globalists that they absolutely hate on the air and will keep a broadcast and news information system that is credited by the most evil people on earth as being one of the main thorns in their side.
[01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:50.369]  So you keep us out there fighting for you, fighting for ourselves, fighting for our future when you get this product.
[01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:52.569]  Now here's the other two big benefits.
[01:21:53.409 --> 01:22:08.409]  Everybody knows That CBD from the hemp plant is absolutely incredible, anti-inflammatory, great for mental clarity and focus, but also being relaxed at the same time, just so good for your immune system, all your cells,
[01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:09.069]  your whole body.
[01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:10.510]  It is a gift from God.
[01:22:10.689 --> 01:22:12.109]  So everybody knows that.
[01:22:12.449 --> 01:22:14.250]  Hell, medical doctors are prescribing it everywhere.
[01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:18.949]  But then here's the other part, and this is the part you may not know.
[01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:28.390]  When you see the high-end 1,000-milligram CBDs out there, And they're retailing at $120 or $140 or $150 from your doctor.
[01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:31.850]  These are the discounted brands for $75.
[01:22:32.449 --> 01:22:34.750]  That's about the market rate.
[01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:38.229]  That's a good deal compared to $120 or $150.
[01:22:38.729 --> 01:22:42.130]  But, ladies and gentlemen, there's a ton of markup in there.
[01:22:42.369 --> 01:22:51.609]  One of the top manufacturers in the country that has scores of companies private labeling their highly rated product is owned by a listener.
[01:22:52.399 --> 01:23:23.529]  And so I've been talking to them really for over a year but the last six months we got serious with one of my sponsors for them to go and private label them from them and for us to be authorized to bring you the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high quality CBD. So I want to introduce to you jonescbd.com jonescbd.com ladies and gentlemen This 1,000 milligram concentrated
[01:23:23.529 --> 01:23:31.829]  nanotincture, which means it's way more highly absorbable, could easily retail for $120 and sell all day.
[01:23:31.949 --> 01:23:33.850]  And some people will pay more if they think it's better.
[01:23:34.069 --> 01:23:34.409]  No.
[01:23:34.649 --> 01:23:42.270]  This same CBD is sold by different people that probably label it from $140, $120, $75.
[01:23:42.949 --> 01:23:46.029]  Nobody, even when they discount it, is going below that.
[01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:49.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Ultra Green.
[01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.329]  Ultra Green.
[01:23:49.539 --> 01:23:56.380]  This is a 1,000-milligram, high-end, nano-process, so it goes into the cells.
[01:23:56.619 --> 01:23:58.479]  Much better statistics here.
[01:23:58.579 --> 01:23:59.239]  It's on the website.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.159]  And this is all documented, all certified.
[01:24:02.859 --> 01:24:09.100]  This is the best steel you're going to find anywhere, and it's only $47.95.
[01:24:09.319 --> 01:24:12.680]  And when you combo it, it's even less.
[01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:15.300]  So let me read some of the facts off here.
[01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:22.550]  It's nano-sized bioaventability, supercharged, delivering eight to nine times the absorption of standard formulas.
[01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:28.310]  If you're done with watered-down, underpowered products, Ultra Green is here to bring you the real deal.
[01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:29.710]  Demand the best.
[01:24:29.909 --> 01:24:34.810]  Grab Ultra Green Nano CBD at jonescbd.com today.
[01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:46.960]  And then there's another great product that's even less, $39.95, and it's got the Nano CBD in it and then a whole bunch of other known concentrated herbs that give you deep Restful sleep.
[01:24:47.199 --> 01:24:50.380]  And the CBD does that as well.
[01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:53.760]  So I'm up to sell you on CBD. I'm up to sell you on supporting the broadcast.
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.899]  All I'm asking you to do is to try this, and what do you have to lose?
[01:24:58.899 --> 01:25:12.729]  You've funded the broadcast, you're fighting tyranny, and when you get a great response from this CBD, and you take it and it works better than CBD that costs twice as much or more, You're going to say, Alex Jones did not steer me wrong again.
[01:25:13.029 --> 01:25:17.729]  I didn't bring a silver or gold sponsor on until about 13 months ago.
[01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:19.970]  I've been in silver and gold for 30 years.
[01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:27.489]  For 12, I haven't promoted it because the silver and gold market was down and most of the dealers were overcharging.
[01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:29.689]  So I didn't promote silver or gold for 12 years.
[01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:44.649]  When I knew it was going to explode, and I was sure of it with all the indicators, as I read the economists work across the board every day, I got a sponsor that's highly rated on, and silver, since he came on, is up almost 50%.
[01:25:44.649 --> 01:25:46.090]  Gold's exploded as well.
[01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:49.109]  So, I don't steer you wrong.
[01:25:49.489 --> 01:25:59.409]  And when I tell you that if you already like CBD, and most folks do and know how great it works, this is high-end, high-quality, at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:03.210]  This is just some of the products that are at jonescbd.com.
[01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:19.130]  We are very excited about this, and it is helping fund The Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X and the studios, the satellite uplinks for radio and TV, the crew, the legal, everything we're doing.
[01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:20.710]  So it is a match made in heaven.
[01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:34.229]  All you've got to do is go to jonescbd.com, buy the product, you support the broadcast, you win right there, you get it, and you take it, and you get a great experience.
[01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:35.430]  It works great.
[01:26:35.609 --> 01:26:37.010]  Believe me, I use it all the time.
[01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:38.329]  My family uses it.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.819]  And then I want you to do something else.
[01:26:41.979 --> 01:26:44.720]  If you've not known how good CBD was, you're going to go, this is great.
[01:26:44.819 --> 01:26:45.680]  You're into CBD now.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:52.920]  Go out and get one of the other brands that's even more money and then just see if this doesn't work better or just as good.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.640]  Because this is high end.
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.220]  The same company.
[01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:00.890]  All day long.
[01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:05.869]  Now, again, if you are a CBD person, you'll know immediately when you take it that is high quality.
[01:27:06.109 --> 01:27:10.270]  Now, can you pay three times as much and get 3,000 milligram and even more concentrate?
[01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:12.489]  Yeah, but it becomes overkill.
[01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:20.029]  So instead of taking, you know, four or five drops of the super strong stuff, you take six, seven, eight drops of this, and it's just as good.
[01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.829]  You got a lower price.
[01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:25.399]  And again, 1000mg is very high on the spectrum, is already very strong.
[01:27:25.539 --> 01:27:27.920]  But to be honest, there's stuff even stronger out there.
[01:27:27.979 --> 01:27:31.199]  But this is high quality, it's nano, it funds the operation.
[01:27:31.539 --> 01:27:36.119]  This is, hands down, the best deal there is out there.
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:42.739]  So please visit jonescbd.com today and keep this transmission on one way or another.
[01:27:42.899 --> 01:27:44.340]  I humbly thank you.
[01:27:44.439 --> 01:28:00.939]  I respectfully thank you for what you've done because I can't do this without you and we are funding Our operations against the globalists, the retail sales, and as you know, it's been all over the newspapers, have spent close to $80 million of lawsuits and garbage trying to shut us down the last seven years.
[01:28:01.159 --> 01:28:05.300]  And because of your support, we have been able to fight them off and stay on air.
[01:28:05.399 --> 01:28:12.180]  But now is our most critical time to ensure that this new system is able to stay on air, regardless of what happens to Infowars.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.159]  So this is a time for action.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.039]  And you don't just vote for Trump.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.220]  You also support the independent organizations that are exposing the globalists.
[01:28:21.359 --> 01:28:26.640]  That's why they're obsessed with censorship because with the truth getting out there, their lies cannot stand.

[01:28:47.269 --> 01:28:50.470]  Wear a Trump t-shirt, put a sign on the lawn, wear a mega hat, you know?
[01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:53.010]  And then if people confront you, say, yeah, that's right.
[01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.489]  Elon Musk is absolutely right.
[01:28:55.989 --> 01:29:05.130]  We need to show our support for President Trump as a champion against a globalist, as the champion, by wearing his shirts out in public and not being ashamed.
[01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:10.010]  Because the majority of Americans, the number of shows, support Trump, but they're still scared to say it.
[01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:13.170]  You will meet so many like-minded people when you wear President Trump shirts.
[01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:15.090]  We've got some great ones at thealexshonestore.com.
[01:29:15.579 --> 01:29:23.180]  But Infowars shirts are recognized by patriots and tyrants alike as the symbol of the resistance.
[01:29:23.539 --> 01:29:27.119]  Old school, true rebels, true mavericks against tyranny.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:33.180]  Now when you go to thealexjonesstore.com, there's amazing hoodies, ball caps, new designs getting out every few days, amazing t-shirts.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:41.640]  But two of the shirts are marked up a little more than $25, $30 or so, so that you can really know you helped fundraise.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:49.899]  And it's the classic InfoWars red on navy blue, and it is the Punisher shirt right here that everybody really loves.
[01:29:50.279 --> 01:29:51.239]  Because it's true.
[01:29:51.939 --> 01:29:55.800]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God, 1776.
[01:29:56.079 --> 01:29:58.039]  So both of these shirts are our best sellers.
[01:29:58.199 --> 01:29:59.439]  I want to thank those of you that are supported.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:05.119]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't supported to get them both at thealexjonesstore.com right now at this critical time.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.960]  InfoWars should be shut down in just 21 days as the time I'm taping this.
