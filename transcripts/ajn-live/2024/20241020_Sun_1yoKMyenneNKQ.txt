[00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.810]  It's Sunday, October 20th, 2024.
[00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.150]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.549]  This is a major World War alert.
[00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.209]  InfoWars.
[00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:26.109]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.390]  We are 15 days out.
[00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.530]  Hard to believe.
[00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.670]  The most important election in world history, hands down.
[00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.849]  We're 23 days out of the potential shutdown of InfoWars.
[00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.969]  And then, of course, once Trump's elected, we're able to get through all the fraud.
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.430]  76 days of hell where the left is promising civil war conditions and is making clear preparation for it.
[00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:18.039]  Trump for 76 days will not be the president, and the Biden-Harris Obama administration has put martial law Provisions in place that I've been covering for three weeks since we discovered them on air.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:29.340]  And finally, they got a lot of attention this week, but only the part about the U.S. military being authorized for domestic operations and killing U.S. citizens.
[00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:37.979]  Not the whole document that gets into martial law in America.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.009]  And yesterday, I re-read the entire 50-plus page document.
[00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.710]  Then I went and looked at the executive orders that tied to it to have the specifics.
[00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:59.949]  And it is the preparation and really the beginning, if you have to put it in motion, of martial law.
[00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.669]  They'll call it a civil emergency.
[00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.750]  But that's really the big news, isn't it?
[00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:10.310]  And they could use a big war to do that, a giant cyber attack, a bunch of false flag terror attacks, a contested election.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:20.180]  And you got all these different think tank heads and congresspeople like Jamie Raskin and Pelosi saying we will be in Civil War conditions.
[00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.900]  I mean, that alone is super ominous.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.919]  And I talk about it because it's not getting...
[00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.219]  Sure, it trended one day at the top of X. And it was in some of the news and Fox covered it and said, oh, what's this?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.979]  The military will kill Americans during an emergency.
[00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:46.360]  But the fact that they're setting all that up While blaming Trump simultaneously claiming he's going to, quote, use the military on the American people is incredible.
[00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.699]  Now, the good news is Friday's show just on X alone had over 30 million views.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.639]  So it is getting out.
[00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.520]  I really shouldn't complain.
[00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:03.340]  But it would be nice to see Trump and Elon Musk and others talk about it because they really got the big bully pulpit, the big bullhorn, don't they?
[00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.719]  Now, that fits into tonight's big developments.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.920]  Yesterday morning, I got up at 5 a.m., got a cup of coffee, went and got on my desktop, and boom!
[00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.639]  Right out of the mouth of Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist dictator, in battle fatigues.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.560]  He's never done that.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.360]  He's not one to play soldier, usually.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.000]  Reviewing all the different military forces in two different speeches that we've got for you in Chinese and Mandarin.
[00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.180]  Saying war is imminent.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.199]  We are prepared right now and I want you to get ready for war as soon as tomorrow.
[00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.720]  He said imminent war with the United States.
[00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:57.180]  And that type of talk's not gone on in China since during the Korean War that was fought between China and the United States.
[00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:06.949]  And then only when the United States threatened to use nuclear weapons did China sign the ceasefire that's been in place More than 60 years.
[00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.110]  That's the demilitarized zone between South and North Korea.
[00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.910]  So that's kind of a big deal.
[00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.569]  And then you ask, why would he do that?
[00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.089]  Well, why did North Korea last week blow up a whole bunch of the bridges and railways into South Korea?
[00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.670]  They said because we're, quote, preparing for war.
[00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.589]  Here's the headline.
[00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.350]  North Korea threatens to declare war.
[00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.269]  Chinese President Xi Jinping orders military to prepare for war.
[00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.790]  Why is that?
[00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.170]  Well, we got it right here, don't we?
[00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.089]  Right here.
[00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.990]  Remember we covered this Friday when it was just in the foreign news.
[00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.870]  And I said, let's wait and see what's said.
[00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.910]  But now the White House came up today and said, no, it's real.
[00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.990]  We're going to find out who leaked it.
[00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:53.149]  Pentagon documents that Israel planning to strike Iran proper, the actual nation of Iran, with heavy bombardments before the election.
[00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.970]  Talk about October surprise, but it gets crazier.
[00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:04.709]  Bill, the most respected publication in Germany, got documents and reports that NATO is going to give nukes in the next two weeks to Ukraine.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:16.519]  Irish sea moss has been all the rage in the last five years because when folks started discovering it, it took the country and the world by storm because of the incredible effects it has.
[00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:23.259]  It's probably the greatest superfood out there, full of organic-based iodine and a whole bunch of vitamins and minerals.
[00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:42.149]  And we've got the gummies and the capsules now We're good to go.
[00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, your support of our sponsor will make sure I am able to stay on air.

[00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.029]  Now, thanks for the support.
[00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:30.129]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.790]  It's Sunday, October 20th, 2024.
[00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.889]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled InfoWars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:06.329]  And the intensity of the attacks on this independent pro-human Team Humanity broadcast are emblematic and are just symptoms of the larger attacks on humanity.
[00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:13.410]  We are 15 days, 7 hours, 53 minutes, 6 seconds, the most important election in world history.
[00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.810]  Then, President Trump will be president-elect, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:20.629]  In 91 days, he'll be sworn in.
[00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:27.709]  But in the 76 days, when he is president-elect, the Democrats have prepared for martial law.
[00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:34.490]  And the implementation of U.S. troops on the streets, seizing control of all infrastructure, and the killing of Americans.
[00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.190]  It's all public.
[00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.129]  I warned you of this for decades.
[00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.730]  And now, the secret plans they've been constructing and building and perfecting in the shadows are being revealed.
[00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:53.169]  The knife, the dagger, the sword of tyranny has been unsheathed and is now pointing at the heart of our republic and the entire world.
[00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.809]  And that's not hype what I just said.
[00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.850]  That's the point in history that we are alive right now.
[00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:09.149]  So yeah, we're not in the final countdown to some wonderful thing here, are we?
[00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:25.169]  We're in the final countdown to a collapsing globalist elite that wants to keep total control, not just over us, but the rest of the world, that has good people, bad people, horrible people like the Communist Chinese, ready to go to war with them because the Anglo-American establishment, that's what they call themselves,
[00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:30.330]  doesn't mean white people, it's the name of the British Empire merged with the United States Empire in their own documents.
[00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:32.769]  Putin refers to it as the Anglo-American elite.
[00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.549]  They think they run the entire world, and they are the big alpha predator.
[00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:42.929]  They've got the most money, the most weapons, the most propaganda, and they got us under their boot.
[00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:49.490]  But we are wiggling out from under it right now and biting on the boot, not licking the boot.
[00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:51.110]  All right.
[00:09:51.429 --> 00:10:03.090]  In just the last 36 hours, it has been confirmed what broke three days ago Pentagon leaked documents, big national security investigation.
[00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.769]  The White House confirms it's true.
[00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:09.590]  They would have denied it if they weren't the ones that leaked it.
[00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.129]  I'll explain in a moment my perspective and view on that.
[00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:14.870]  I don't know that for sure, but you can bet the farm on it.
[00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:26.149]  That the White House, and this is a real staple when they say this, does not want Israel to bomb Iran proper because they know what that means and what that's going to trigger.
[00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:41.879]  So they're really upset that That Netanyahu, to stay in power, has already taken out the main enemies and proxies of Iran around Israel before they go after Israel itself.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.899]  We talked about this on Friday before it was confirmed.
[00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.080]  I said I thought it was probably accurate.
[00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.419]  It hit the foreign news.
[00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:53.559]  The secret documents were leaked on Telegram.
[00:10:55.269 --> 00:11:11.950]  And now it was confirmed yesterday morning by the White House that indeed U.S. intelligence has Israel's battle plan, shared with them by Israel, to strike Iran with a heavy bombardment inside Iran and their military bases and their nuclear facilities before the election.
[00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.990]  That's sometime in the next 15 days.
[00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:24.830]  Now, if we knew about this Friday and the White House admitted it Saturday, do you think North Korea knew six days ago, seven days ago when they blew up?
[00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:36.990]  The highways and roads and bridges and rail lines over the DMC and that river between South and North Korea?
[00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:50.370]  Do you think when Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist dictator for life, came out Saturday and said, prepare for total war with the West, do you think they're talking about that?
[00:11:51.110 --> 00:12:07.240]  Israel's plan to attack their ally, Iran, And I'm no fan of the mullahs, but they've been extremely restrained in Israel, cleaning their clock, killing their proxy leaders, just doing a show of force with some missiles that,
[00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.720]  thank God, didn't kill anybody.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.700]  Remember Netanyahu said he will do an investigation of October 7th once the war's over.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:25.360]  Well, let's hope the world's not over by the time we find out why Israel stood down for seven and a half hours on October 7th, which doesn't lessen what Hezbollah did backing Hamas.
[00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:28.679]  And I said it was Iran the whole time, obviously.
[00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.929]  But there's a lot of geopolitical wrangling going on right now, and the end of the old financial order is here.
[00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:41.529]  And so Russia and China and the BRICS want it to be their new cashless central bank digital currency, social credit score.
[00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:48.690]  And the United States, what's left for the British Empire and Europe, the Anglo-American establishment, the Five Eyes, have got their plan.
[00:12:49.169 --> 00:13:06.580]  And what happens in history in World War I and World War II and big wars before that, when big financial interest I believe that was von Bismarck.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.799]  My memory sometimes fails.
[00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:09.539]  It used to be photographic.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.019]  It's not anymore.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.759]  It's still really good.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.679]  Guys, look up.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.500]  War is an extension of politics by other means.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.480]  I believe that's von Bismarck, but others have said similar things, and it's true.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.500]  There's other quotes that war is an extension of business and politics.
[00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.990]  So, you have Israel getting ready to strike Iran proper, and Israel's already promised they are.
[00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:37.889]  Then, you know, he said, you know, when the time is right, they'll decide and pull those clips up in the last few months.
[00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:40.009]  Oh, we will strike Iran proper.
[00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.250]  That is the nation of Iran.
[00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:43.889]  But we'll pick the time in the best way.
[00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.769]  Probably said it 10 times I've seen him on TV say it.
[00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:48.350]  Hell, he said it to Congress.
[00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:51.269]  But would that be enough?
[00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.490]  Yeah, Carl...
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.419]  One Klawitz.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.759]  That's another one that said it.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.259]  So, another German statesman.
[00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:11.379]  But the point is, is that, is that enough to get Xi Jinping to say, prepare for imminent war?
[00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:24.330]  Probably, because of the defense agreements they've got, both Russia and China with Iran, that if it struck proper, they would then respond.
[00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.149]  But what else would do it?
[00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:43.210]  Well, it broke a week ago in Bild, the most respected publication in Germany, and by that, most corporate media is not very respectable, and Bild still puts out social propaganda, but when they report news, it's usually accurate, and Bild talked to senior NATO and EU diplomats that said,
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:15:00.620]  That NATO's looking at basically giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine in the next two weeks so they can threaten to use them on Russia if Russia doesn't leave, and that, oh, don't worry, there's plausible liability because they can just say that because of the nuclear reactors that Ukraine has,
[00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.120]  that they could build their own.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.799]  Wink, wink.
[00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:08.870]  Kind of like when the West got caught blowing up Nord Stream pipeline a few years ago, they now blame Ukraine.
[00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:11.090]  They need that plausible deniability.
[00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.769]  Like China has always, it's come out in policy reports, said they would use North Korea as the trigger on the world stage.
[00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:24.809]  A conflict there to launch nuclear war, total war, just like they did back during the Korean War in the 50s.
[00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:34.289]  And that was a war between the United States and China, and we're still at war that was just a ceasefire.
[00:15:36.149 --> 00:15:42.610]  Zelensky calls for nukes, then denies nuke plan, but Hungary believes he will trigger nuclear war, World War III. Here's the headlines.
[00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.350]  First Ukraine nuke ready in weeks, build reports.
[00:15:51.529 --> 00:15:53.870]  So Zelensky a few weeks ago saying, I'm going to have nukes soon.
[00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.029]  I'm going to get nukes.
[00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.309]  And then I was like, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.070]  We don't have nukes.
[00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:58.029]  We're not getting nukes.
[00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.049]  And I've told you for years, Saudi Arabia has nukes.
[00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:03.029]  Iran has nukes.
[00:16:06.409 --> 00:16:08.129]  Now South Korea wants nukes.
[00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.269]  They're handing them out like hotcakes.
[00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.490]  Israel still claims they don't have nukes.
[00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.210]  They've got thousands.
[00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.909]  That's been confirmed.
[00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.970]  That goes back to JFK. Right around that time, they got them in 63.
[00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.169]  So, you talk about a Mexican standoff, that's where everybody's pointing guns at each other and nobody wins.
[00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:32.049]  That's mutually assured destruction.
[00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:35.769]  So, we'll leave this overhead shot right here.
[00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.049]  Chinese President Xi Jinping orders military to prepare for war.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.200]  Chinese President Xi Jinping orders military to prepare for war.
[00:16:56.799 --> 00:17:01.120]  Xi Jinping asks troops prepare for war as battle drills intensify around Taiwan.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.640]  Xi Jinping orders Chinese troops to boost war preparedness.
[00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:10.859]  China's Xi calls for troops to boost war preparedness.
[00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.059]  AP, Reuters, all of it.
[00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:14.160]  North Korea threatens to declare war.
[00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.940]  China slams illegal U.S. sanctions.
[00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.099]  South Korea needs nukes.
[00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:28.589]  Leaked documents show U.S. intelligence on Israel's plans to attack Iran, sources say.
[00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.769]  CNN, before the election, Iran warns U.S. over Israeli strikes.
[00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.789]  Iran, weakened by attacks on its allies, braces for Israeli strikes.
[00:17:40.289 --> 00:17:42.509]  Has Iran just tested a nuclear weapon?
[00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:57.509]  They had a big earthquake in the region, and the seismologist that looked at it, it's been reported all over the news, said that it looks like An atomic or hydrogen weapon was detonated underground,
[00:17:58.089 --> 00:18:03.970]  creating a 4.6 on the Richter scale detected in the Siman region.
[00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.009]  U.S. government leaks Israeli strike plans to Iran.
[00:18:11.349 --> 00:18:12.250]  That's really what happened.
[00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:15.309]  Great report by Raw Egg Nationalists at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.130]  That really breaks it down.
[00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:20.349]  Netanyahu promises retaliation following assassination attempt on his home with a drone.
[00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.029]  Fox News.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.019]  Hezbollah drones target Netanyahu's home.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.559]  He says, agents of Iran try to assassinate me.
[00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:31.519]  Blowback, how Israel went from helping Hamas to bombing it.
[00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:35.720]  How Israel decimated Hamas and Hezbollah leadership in three months.
[00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:39.099]  Israel's historical role in the rise of Hamas.
[00:18:39.279 --> 00:18:40.279]  This is all mainstream news.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.119]  Okay, so that's just some of what's going on there.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.380]  Just to give you an idea, this is all unprecedented.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:06.140]  This is the greatest combination of crises we've seen that even mainline historical analysts say is the signature of a new world war.
[00:19:06.839 --> 00:19:08.200]  And then I mentioned this.
[00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:08.599]  Here it is.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.259]  First, Ukraine nuke ready in weeks.
[00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:15.539]  Bill newspaper reports from diplomat sources in NATO and the European Union.
[00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.380]  And then we've got articles pushing it.
[00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.130]  Ukraine could rebuild nuclear arsenal after Clinton Obama disarmed it.
[00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:25.250]  Well, it was always part of Russia's arsenal.
[00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:26.730]  It was just taken out at the end of the Cold War.
[00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:29.130]  And of course, you know, they kept a few.
[00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:32.690]  German news publication claims Ukraine could have nuclear weapons within weeks.
[00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.009]  Germany and the UK signed a historic defense pact.
[00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:42.690]  Over 100 Ukrainian drones down just last night attacking Russia.
[00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:46.269]  Starting to see how this war is just spiraling quickly.
[00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:48.940]  Out of control.
[00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:55.759]  Now, I don't normally play clips, but it's a short clip that are in a foreign language but has subtitles.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.960]  But this is historic enough.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.680]  I'm going to play it in the Mandarin Chinese.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.519]  And again, TV viewers can read the subtitles, but I don't like to tell you something this big.
[00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:11.140]  I like to actually show you it so it's on record, kind of like the media will say, Trump said he hates all Mexicans.
[00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:11.740]  Where's the clip?
[00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:16.400]  Doesn't exist.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.019]  Trump says he used the military on citizens.
[00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:19.920]  Doesn't exist.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.839]  Or Alex Jones said go pee on dead kids' graves.
[00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:23.460]  Where's the clip?
[00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:23.960]  Doesn't exist.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.880]  So I'm not like the corporate media that tells you something but doesn't show it to you.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:43.779]  Here is Xi Jinping yesterday addressing the Combined Armed Forces of China, the largest military on Earth, second largest Navy on Earth, with the third largest nuclear arsenal on Earth, with submarines off our coast, saying prepare for imminent war.
[00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:44.220]  Here it is.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.140]  Today, I'm going to go to the military center of the military.
[00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:01.480]  I want to make a difference.
[00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:08.089]  We're good to go.
[00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:22.690]  We're good to go.
[00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:54.109]  全軍要貫徹新時代黨的強軍思想貫徹新時代軍事戰略方針堅持戰鬥力這個唯一的根本的標準全部經歷向打仗聚焦全部工作向打仗用盡加快提高打贏能力堅決捍衛國家主權安全發展利益完成好黨和人民賦予的各項任務 Alright, so that's put out by the Chinese Communist government itself.
[00:21:55.289 --> 00:21:58.569]  Ukraine can build bombs in a few weeks, nuclear bombs, atomic bombs.
[00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.430]  Looks like Iran just tested one.
[00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.309]  Starting to figure out where we're going here.
[00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.430]  Now, South Korea wants nukes.
[00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:05.930]  North Korea is threatening to attack.
[00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.730]  And people are like, well, they've been doing that for a long time.
[00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:16.069]  But the escalations have never gotten anywhere near this, and you don't have the West financial bubble beyond collapse.
[00:22:16.529 --> 00:22:19.470]  The Chinese are in total collapse, even worse than the West.
[00:22:20.329 --> 00:22:21.450]  That's not even disputed.
[00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.150]  This is when big wars start because that keeps the regimes in power.
[00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:32.630]  You'd think you could throw regimes out during wars, but historically that actually props up the regime.
[00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:50.880]  So why would the Biden, Harris, Obama, whoever's running things up there, deep state, legitimately, because it's come out in cables and it's been leaked over the years and we know that John Kerry was working on With Iran as a shadow ambassador when Trump was in office as president trying to derail,
[00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:52.539]  you know, Trump cutting off Iran.
[00:22:54.559 --> 00:23:04.539]  A large arm of the globalist system really thinks that a total war with Iran will get out of hand and that they've got enough sleeper cells in the West to actually bring things to a standstill.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:11.759]  They'll also block those major canals where half the oil in the world goes through.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.279]  And so there's a large camp doesn't want full war with Iran.
[00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:25.460]  And then there's another camp in the US and Europe and of course Netanyahu that does want it and thinks they can defeat Iran.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:32.720]  And you notice the last few months Israel's really destroyed the forces and proxies in four different countries around Israel.
[00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.910]  And they've taken out the leaders of all those groups.
[00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:41.029]  And so, Iran's tentacles have been cut off.
[00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.250]  And that has emboldened Netanyahu.
[00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.529]  And so, you can read the documents.
[00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.529]  They're on Infowars.com.
[00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:48.369]  They're all over the news.
[00:23:48.849 --> 00:23:56.390]  That Israel is telling the Pentagon they're planning to hit before the election in the next 15 days.
[00:23:56.569 --> 00:24:02.329]  So, I believe the Biden administration, the people running it, did leak this information.
[00:24:02.329 --> 00:24:03.390]  They're confirming it's real.
[00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.170]  See, if it was real...
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.000]  And then they denied it.
[00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:07.319]  That means they didn't want it out.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.279]  But they're, of course, famous leakers.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.220]  Now, here's another piece of why this is happening.
[00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:13.440]  You can look these numbers up.
[00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:16.799]  Kirk Elliott's going to go over this with us coming up in the next hour and all the other big economic developments.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.220]  They're some of the most intense ever.
[00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:18.940]  Update.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.299]  Collapse is coming.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.500]  Unrealized losses at U.S. banks are seven times at least higher than during the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:31.059]  And if you look at the graphs there, that is what's currently happening.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.240]  Since 2008.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.240]  So the bailouts didn't do what they were supposed to.
[00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:35.940]  It made it worse.
[00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:51.579]  And that's why you have the FDIC last year, in December, at their final meeting, the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation, that, you know, what is a quarter million backs up each one of your bank accounts, saying, well, we got to get the public ready for bail-ins.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.180]  They're coming sooner rather than later.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.180]  But we don't want to tell the public.
[00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:57.660]  And they go, well, then why are we telling them on this?
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.539]  Oh, they won't notice.
[00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:02.640]  Because they record it and then post it on their website.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:17.339]  That means them nationalizing all your accounts, your assets, your stocks, your bonds, pooling them, creating derivatives out of them, and then you don't own your stocks and bonds and money.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.400]  It's pretty much already like that, but it makes it official.
[00:25:20.099 --> 00:25:27.859]  Just like the property tax, you don't really own your house, you rent it, and then they push it all into the new central bank digital currency tokenized money.
[00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.609]  They can decide where you can spend it.
[00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.569]  It surveils everything you do.
[00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.390]  They can devalue it.
[00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.569]  They can increase the value of it.
[00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.269]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:25:35.369 --> 00:25:37.970]  U.S. banks' unrealized losses soared to seven times.
[00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.890]  That's even in the media, not just the graphs.
[00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.529]  Seven times.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.619]  Higher than during the 2008 financial collapse.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.339]  Meanwhile, gold breaks 2,700 barrier for first time on safe haven demand.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:00.579]  A bunch of new articles on that and what's really happening in the economy coming up next hour.
[00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.400]  We're going to really go to the documents.
[00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:11.390]  I've got a huge, huge Stack of news.
[00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:14.470]  Hong Kong to bring in measures to boost gold trading.
[00:26:15.349 --> 00:26:23.809]  Then I've got all the big banks in the U.S., I say all JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, all of them saying, oh my God, the consumers are about to all want it.
[00:26:23.829 --> 00:26:24.869]  It's the new bull market.
[00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:34.369]  And that's why they, for the last few years, have been hoarding it and buying it as much as they can until they can't suppress it anymore.
[00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.630]  Then they say, go to town.
[00:26:37.659 --> 00:26:40.099]  ABC News, gold prices hitting all-time highs.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.420]  That's what I've been telling you.
[00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:50.720]  When the public finally figures it out, less than 2% of the population owns any gold as a commodity or as an asset, it is going to...
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:27:00.019]  And that all signifies they can't hold back the illusion that inflation isn't actually much worse than they say.
[00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:03.599]  I mean, folks, I went yesterday to a barbecue place I've been going to for...
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.240]  25 years at least.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.859]  Gosh, no, wait, since high school.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.640]  I mean, I'm getting old.
[00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:13.660]  It's probably an older place, but I discovered it 32 years ago.
[00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:19.640]  Still there, though they're now going to tear down the whole park, business park and build condos.
[00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:21.079]  They're moving and they don't know where.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.720]  The point is, I go in there yesterday because my seven-year-old daughter said, I want brisket.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.640]  And I said, sure, honey.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.039]  I'm never going to turn that down.
[00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:33.119]  So I get in the car and drive over there.
[00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:34.380]  And I got...
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:46.660]  And I see this everywhere, but two pounds of brisket, two pounds of turkey, one pound of jalapeno sausage, and then like quarts, just four quarts aside.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.400]  It's not that much.
[00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:49.440]  200 bucks.
[00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:58.880]  And I asked them, I said, I said, you know, like 10 years ago, this would have been like 70 bucks, 60 bucks.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.319]  They said, yeah.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.519]  And I said, like a year ago, it was like 100.
[00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:03.079]  They go, yeah, we held back prices, but we're going to go bankrupt.
[00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:04.140]  It's just, it's all that expensive.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.259]  I go, I know, I know.
[00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:08.640]  So like food, enough, because I wanted some leftovers.
[00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:09.599]  We had it again today.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.359]  Enough food for like six people?
[00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:12.900]  $200?
[00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:15.680]  And this is not some, you know, fancy pants place.
[00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:16.700]  It's great food.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.220]  But how do people pay for that?
[00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:28.400]  I mean, a McDonald's, Big Mac fries, and large drink is $18 plus now.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:35.759]  And notice they held back, and I don't eat there, but I read it in the news, and I've certainly driven by and seen the prices and saw it for myself.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.160]  So, that's insane.
