[00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.580]  And so, of course, they were going to try to shut us down this morning.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.060]  And maybe we'll get it back next week, and maybe we'll be broadcasting from those studios next week, and maybe not.
[00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.539]  And maybe we'll only have it back for a little bit, and then it will really go away, and then maybe not.
[00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.600]  But it doesn't even matter, because today we reached a record audience.
[00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.350]  On a completely new network.
[00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.530]  On all the same stations because of you, the listeners.
[00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.190]  And this was all made possible because over the course of the last several months, you went to the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.109]  You signed up for the VIP club to ensure that we'd have recurring revenue.
[00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.329]  You bought the shirts.
[00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.289]  You bought the supplements.
[00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.869]  You supported us on the AlexJonesStore.com because that was the first thing they tried to do.
[00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.149]  They made it impossible for the Infowars store to order new inventory.
[00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.450]  So we couldn't even buy product to sell in order to support The organization, Infowars, Free Speech Systems.
[00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:03.570]  And after they did that, I was fortunate enough that I'd done a podcast with the Hodge twins, who also work with Bigly, American heroes at Bigly, by the way.
[00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:10.609]  We're good to go.
[00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.719]  And they ordered and fulfilled products.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.140]  They designed t-shirts.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.540]  I mean, amazing work.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.420]  Unbelievable work.
[00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:33.640]  And it kept us on the air for the last three months and ensured that this broadcast was a record broadcast from Alex Jones.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.239]  I am so proud to work with this crew.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.920]  I am so proud to work with Bigly.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.719]  I am so proud to work for Alex Jones.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.980]  And the longer that I work here for Alex Jones, the more resolved I am in him, the more confident I am in him, the more assured I am that I made the right decision.
[00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.730]  It's not even about what he says even.
[00:01:50.849 --> 00:02:06.810]  Even if I disagreed with everything he said, which I don't, but even if I did disagree with everything that Alex Jones said, I would still be proud to work here because he has become a symbol of freedom of speech itself and I would die for anyone's right to speak their mind, to express themselves,
[00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.110]  especially if I disagree with them.
[00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:16.099]  We want the likes of CNN and MSNBC and NPR to be canceled because nobody watches them.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.879]  We don't want to hijack them using lawfare and sue them on some trumped up bull crap.
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.759]  We're not trying to weaponize the government against our media opposition, against our political press.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.400]  We're just trying to beat them in the information war by winning all of their listeners over.
[00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.460]  And frankly, it's very obvious that that's happening.
[00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.110]  What, 2 million viewers on one of our X accounts alone?
[00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.090]  Not counting the Real Alex Jones one?
[00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:45.590]  On AJN Live, we've had over 2 million viewers today, just on AJN Live on X. Plus, it was on Real Alex Jones.
[00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.289]  Plus, it was on Ad Infowars.
[00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.569]  Plus, we were on Rumble.
[00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.090]  It was record numbers there.
[00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.229]  Plus, we're on radio.
[00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.169]  Plus, we're on TV. We have a greater audience than these mainstream outlets.
[00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.430]  Jake Tapper's being denied raises.
[00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:04.930]  There's rumors going around of mass layoffs coming again, including top talent at these major networks, CNN and others.
[00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.629]  But Alex Jones is still on the air after they mocked him for years.
[00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:09.389]  He's going to be canceled.
[00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:10.030]  He's going to be canceled.
[00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.169]  They have fallen like flies.
[00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.110]  From their own networks, their own esteemed establishment networks.
[00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.889]  It's so safe and professional to work for Fox News with our tacky boomer graphics.
[00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:29.870]  They make fun of Donald Trump because he's got gold all over and he's got an elaborate taste and the way that the inside of his house is designed.
[00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.530]  They say, oh, his taste is so tacky.
[00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.449]  His taste is so tacky.
[00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.430]  Well, they have the just most dated looking news outlets I've ever seen in my life.
[00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.889]  At least Infowars is cool.
[00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.949]  At least Infowars has some balls.
[00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.389]  I mean, brass balls.
[00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:47.710]  Actually cool stuff.
[00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.669]  Actually fighting.
[00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.990]  Actually running around trying to save freedom of speech as threats of sending the police in to shut us down or force us out.
[00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.469]  As they actually, literally, pull the plug so that Infowars.com is down.
[00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.870]  I don't even know if Bandot Video is down.
[00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.949]  We had to shut down the Infowars store today to not take any more orders because we don't know if we're going to be able to fulfill them.
[00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.430]  But the Alex Jones store, we certainly can.
[00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.030]  That place is the number one place to fight for freedom.
[00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.930]  The AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.069]  Get whatever you want, whatever you can.
[00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.500]  Absolutely amazing stuff.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.040]  But they literally pulled the plug on Infowars today.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.379]  I never thought I'd seen anything like it.
[00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:27.540]  I mean, I felt like I was watching a movie that I just happened to be in today.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.439]  Today was 100%.
[00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.189]  The happiest and the saddest day of my life at the same time.
[00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.370]  Certainly the most exciting.
[00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:49.870]  It's sad in that perhaps the opposition, the enemy, will get the trophy of the logo, or the trophy of the domain names, or the trophy of however many terabytes of B-roll we have in some server.
[00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.750]  It's sad that they get to claim that they have this trophy, that The Onion can come out and make their satirical articles.
[00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:59.620]  I'm happy for them that for the first time in at least a decade, people have actually read their content.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.000]  That's good for them, but it's sad, you know, I get it.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:11.139]  But at the same sense, it's such a blissful, euphoric feeling to break free from chains.
[00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:35.689]  And Infowars for years, even years before I started working there last year, it has been a network, a broadcast, a business operating in chains, trying to ink out decisions, choices, business moves with the approval of a court system and bad people being sent in by the courts in the States pretending to be our friends and they're bad actors on the inside.
[00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.730]  They almost shut us down in June.
[00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.529]  You've heard about it from Alex countless times.
[00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:48.589]  And now we have liberated ourselves, like in Gladiator, when all the Gladiators liberated themselves, like in Spartacus, when Spartacus had that rebellion.
[00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.930]  And we are capable of doing so much more.
[00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:01.509]  I said yesterday to the crew, because we were speculating, as co-workers do, as family does, really feel that these guys are family, what was going to happen?
[00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:04.490]  I kept saying, no matter what happens tomorrow, we win.
[00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.470]  If we keep InfoWars, we win.
[00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.589]  If they take it and shut it down, we win.
[00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:10.449]  And today, we won.
[00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:18.410]  Because of you, the listeners, you who believe in truth, you who believe in free speech, freedom of expression, we won.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.680]  Now, the Infowars never won or lost.
[00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.120]  You're either winning it or you're losing it.
[00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.040]  But today we won a battle akin to the battle that we won on Election Day last week.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:35.279]  This was a landslide victory for freedom of speech because you, the audience, proved that no matter what kind of shit they pull, we're still going to win.
[00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.899]  We're still going to stay loyal to Alex.
[00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:41.959]  We're still going to stay loyal to free speech and our principles and our founding fathers and our culture.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:57.100]  And I tell you what, out of all the problems and miracles that have happened over time, all the donations on Bitcoin, all the supporters who funded or donated, the prayers did actually work the most.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.050]  Because we didn't know when we flipped the switch on today, Whether or not it was going to be a ghost town.
[00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:04.629]  And it wasn't.
[00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.730]  It was like Mardi Gras out there with the audience.
[00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.370]  The replies, the comments.
[00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:09.689]  I am just so pleased.
[00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:10.709]  I am so proud.
[00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:16.290]  The only thing that sucks about today is that I'm going to have a terrible time going to sleep tonight because I'm so excited.
[00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.670]  I'm going to be exhausted in the morning when we hit it again.
[00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.709]  When we win again.
[00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:30.149]  But every day that you listen, every day that you tune in to Alex Jones, whether you're on radio, TV, X, Rumble, wherever, or at AlexJones.network, you can watch as well.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.399]  Every day that you tune in is a major victory for patriotism, for freedom for America.
[00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:44.399]  And it's all so fresh that, frankly, I'm at a loss for words as to what to say.
[00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.939]  I'm inspired.
[00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:46.600]  I'm excited.
[00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:52.120]  They're going to make movies about this in 50 years, what happened today, if Hollywood isn't a satanic pedophile cult anymore.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:07.560]  I mean this is cooler today what I saw than what you see in movies like Wolf of Wall Street or other rags to riches stories of struggle in the beginning and then bootstrapping and resilience and conviction and then overcoming and then success.
[00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:22.480]  This was the coolest thing I ever could have dreamed of and I had no idea when I started my podcast after January 6th of 2021 that that was eventually going to lead me to this place and it's all God.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.980]  Many of you have probably seen the video of Charlie Kirk after he heard that Donald Trump won the election.
[00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:39.340]  And the first thing he said after he had his face in his hands for some time, just shocked and delighted, was that it's all God.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.279]  And it's true, it's all God, but it's God working through you.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.000]  People talk about God's miracles and his ability as divine intervention in our reality.
[00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:55.059]  But it's not some magical thing, it's his will through those willing to follow it.
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.740]  For years I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right?
[00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:06.139]  You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone until you get what you want.
[00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:08.960]  Because you all deserve it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.379]  You know this f***ing deal that I'm about to sign?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.879]  The f*** is that, you know?
[00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:20.470]  I'll tell you what it is.
[00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.789]  It's me taking no for an answer, you know?
[00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:30.210]  It's them selling me, not the other way around.
[00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:34.129]  It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
[00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.330]  So...
[00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:49.190]  You know what?
[00:09:58.129 --> 00:09:58.809]  I'm not leaving.
[00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:02.889]  I'm not leaving!
[00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:13.210]  They show those up!
[00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:17.169]  This is my home!
[00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:22.149]  They're gonna need a wrecking ball to take me out of here!
[00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.549]  Thank you.
