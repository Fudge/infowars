[00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:18.940]  Now, that is the new X handle, in case they shut down Infowars, of where the new network, the Alice Jones Network, is going to be growing from.
[00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.250]  We just did an hour-plus emergency breakdown, but there was one huge point I forgot to make.
[00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.210]  In the federal filing that's in Bloomberg articles, AP Reuters, look it up.
[00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.090]  They say, Jones does not have 13th Amendment rights.
[00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.090]  We can own his name and own Israel Ellis Jones, even though the courts have always said you can't do that.
[00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.189]  And all the major social media companies say someone cannot transfer their personal account to someone else.
[00:00:47.210 --> 00:01:00.979]  But they're As part of my personal bankruptcy, this is a major attack on the 13th Amendment, banning indentured servitude and slavery after the Civil War in the late 1860s.
[00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.959]  And they even admit that in the article, that this is a full frontal assault, but that's okay because it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.079]  He doesn't have the same rights as other people.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.180]  And they hope that you don't defend me and that Elon Musk doesn't defend me.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.879]  So they set the precedent, just like they did with the deplatforming seven, eight years ago.
[00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:35.189]  Then I started thinking when the live feed ended here at the Alex Jones Network that, wait a minute, we just saw in Brazil where they said, we want all these accounts banned and all the tyranny of that and the EU trying to make Elon Musk bow and Australia trying to make him bow.
[00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.689]  Now, Musk beat the EU so far and Australia, but they were arresting, you know, Twitter crew and totally banning it there.
[00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:58.099]  So he capitulated there because the State Department's helping him On record now,
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.700]  the documents are public, running that.
[00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:22.979]  So, look, Musk can't win them all, and so I didn't really criticize Musk when he fought valiantly, but finally I mean,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.419]  this is more intense than what Brazil is doing now that I think about it.
[00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.449]  They are not just saying ban accounts, which is what they admittedly want.
[00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.710]  They know Musk will shut it down.
[00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.090]  They're saying they own Real Alex Jones and the name Alex Jones and Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.449]  And the U.S. trustee, who's the new good guy, you know, the last guy tried to shut us down on a court order and all the rest of it.
[00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.969]  It's crazy.
[00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.310]  Said, oh, no, no, you own your name.
[00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.909]  We can't do that.
[00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.389]  You own your own private social media.
[00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.110]  But I predicted my lawyers they would come back and do this.
[00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.409]  And now they filed in federal court to do that in Houston.
[00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.490]  The live transmission I did from 7 o'clock a little bit into 8 o'clock p.m.
[00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:06.969]  Central Time tonight.
[00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.349]  And then just ask yourselves, is this normal?
[00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.969]  I mean, if the Pentagon signed a document based on executive order by Biden for martial law and killing American citizens, unprecedented in our history.
[00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.560]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:26.240]  You've got Hillary Clinton and all the rest of them, like John Kerry saying, ban the First Amendment.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.719]  You've got the New York Times saying, get rid of the Constitution.
[00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.560]  Don't do your own research.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.240]  I mean, these are real headlines going on.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.699]  These are real things happening.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.659]  They're really trying to do this.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.500]  And just as my deplatforming, they admittedly, was a precedent for everybody else, now they're doing this.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:53.569]  And then, oh, if I work with folks that are That?
[00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.689]  I mean, it's just preposterous.
[00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.449]  Now, the Streisand effect is going to kick in.
[00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.750]  It's going to backfire on them like they're indictments and fake convictions of Trump if you get upset about this and realize this is an attack on you.
[00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.969]  This is a big deal.
[00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.430]  And I've had folks high up at X reach out.
[00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:09.449]  They understand what's going on.
[00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.270]  And so this is very, very precedent setting.
[00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.370]  People didn't understand this seven years ago.
[00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.149]  It really started about nine years ago, but got intense seven years ago with my deplatforming and the attacks and the lawfare and all of it, and the rigged courts, and found guilty by judges.
[00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.129]  They had show trials on HBO, movie productions.
[00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.509]  I mean, it's just wild.
[00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:34.709]  And I couldn't even believe how bad it was until I was in the middle of it and saw both judges with scripts they were following, the same scripts.
[00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:51.850]  So, this is next level stuff, so follow us here at AJNLive, at AJNLive, here on X, and the great folks I'm working with, and if the enemies of freedom think they're going to shut me down, they got nothing coming, because I'm working with three different groups,
[00:04:52.009 --> 00:05:07.430]  and I can work with whoever I want until you declare full martial law and pull the internet kill switch, which we know you're close to doing, while saying Trump's going to call out the military and have martial law, while Biden, who just got removed in a coup, By Harris, who got installed.
[00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.750]  So when we hear Biden just did an order, and based on that order, the Pentagon put out a directive to prepare for war with the American people using legal force.
[00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:16.910]  That's not even really Biden.
[00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.290]  Who loads Kamala's teleprompter?
[00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.689]  She melted down on Brett Baer tonight.
[00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.810]  Who controls her?
[00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.209]  She flounders and all this.
[00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.589]  I mean, who is in charge?
[00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:26.110]  Well, we know.
[00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.990]  The big BlackRock CEOs.
[00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:30.800]  BlackRock's owned by a handful of real Rich families.
[00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:32.459]  They control 87% of world assets.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.600]  And they just want a global social credit score.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.699]  But to get that and their system of AI, mark of the beast surveillance and social credit score, they need to get people like me out of the way.
[00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.720]  And they've said, we're going to own his catalog.
[00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.000]  We're going to ban all his old videos and material.
[00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.420]  It's always been free to air.
[00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.600]  It's always been free speech.
[00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.040]  It's again like Linux.
[00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:55.939]  They put it out for free.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.660]  If the head of Linux, the developer of it, ever declared bankruptcy, they couldn't say, well, Linux belongs to us now.
[00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:02.259]  He made it.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.279]  He said it's a free license to the world.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.319]  If I wrote a book and said, there's no copyright.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.220]  It's free to the world.
[00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.819]  Republish it like people do with the Bible.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.540]  You don't own that.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.959]  No one owns the King James Version.
[00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.360]  It's free to the public.
[00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.550]  So that's always been my intent.
[00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.189]  The documents and legal posts have been on the site for over 20 years, and we've got to fight them, and we are.
[00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.490]  That's why you need to go to my legal defense fund to battle this at realalexjones.com.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.120]  That gives him go.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.040]  It's going to cost...
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.339]  There's five fights I've got with them right now.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.519]  They spent $70 million trying to shut me down in the last seven years.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.819]  We spent $15 million.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.779]  I've got really good lawyers that are not gouging me right now.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.399]  It'll cost a million bucks to beat them right now on not just this, but the other four things that are going on.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.600]  So this is a serious fight.
[00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.079]  Trump needs hundreds of millions to beat them a quarter.
[00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:49.879]  I need millions.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.879]  It's real simple.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.540]  I've totally proven what I've said.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.660]  They said I had hundreds of millions.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.420]  Don't support me.
[00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.230]  And then, of course, the New York Times admit, Jones has made your assets.
[00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.050]  He didn't have much money.
[00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.410]  Yeah, I was spending it all on the fight.
[00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.689]  That's all I care about.
[00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:02.410]  I got a $9 million Bitcoin donation.
[00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.829]  We would have shut down without it three years ago.
[00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.550]  It made us survive two and a half years.
[00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.149]  It was the exact amount we needed.
[00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.689]  It turned out in accounting later to survive.
[00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.949]  So God's working through people out there.
[00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.589]  You can go to alexjones.live.com.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.660]  And it's got the Alex Jones store.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.180]  It's got drjonesnaggles.com.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.120]  It's got the Vimeo.
[00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.000]  It's got my new Bitcoin directly to me.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.000]  It's got all the places you can donate and support and get great products at alexjones.live.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.300]  It's got that link to realalexjones.com.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.199]  But it's all there in one spot.
[00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:31.980]  It will be updated.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.560]  The sites, videos, a lot of stuff's going on.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:44.319]  I'm busy hosting my main show, fighting for InfoWars, working with other folks to build infrastructure, battling illegal fights, taking care of the family, exercising, developing new products.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.819]  Chicken ass!
[00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:59.060]  And in the spirit of 1776, and as the founder of the U.S. Navy, John Paul Jones said, while his ship was sinking, one-third the size of the British frigate, they had to double the soldiers he did, he was sinking, and they hailed over across the bullhorn.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.560]  They weren't electric, they had old-fashioned bullhorns.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.279]  Would you like to give up now?
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.199]  Would you like quarter?
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.259]  And he said, surrender, I've only begun to fight.
[00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:10.860]  And then he tied the ship to them, they took the ship, and then saved both ships.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.360]  That's where I'm at.
[00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.639]  So I've only begun to fight.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.600]  People see it.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.959]  Streisand Effect's taking place.
[00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:19.120]  But we can't get punch drunk to this tyranny and just say, well, that's Alex.
[00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:20.019]  He's a punching bag.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.939]  They're always attacking him because the president's being set for you.
[00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:26.100]  RealAlexJones.com to donate for Legal Defense Fund.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.100]  But you can find all the links at alexjones.live, which is a subpage on alexjones.network.
[00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:39.840]  So, a bigger attack by the Democratic Party through the federal government in court to set the precedent to get rid of the 13th Amendment.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.399]  They actually say it and say Alex Jones and anybody else who's prominent has no rights to the 13th Amendment.
[00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:47.299]  And so he's a special case.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.580]  They actually say Alex Jones is special.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.779]  Yeah, special in that I'm the test case.
[00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:56.480]  They admit that on CNN and MSNBC. Don't let them take your rights away.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.759]  If one American loses their rights and the system perfects its tyranny, you're next.
[00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.200]  They're not trying to get me.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.120]  They got to get through me to get to you, as President Trump says.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.320]  And Infowars, they know, rebooted America.
[00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:11.220]  Our listeners relaunched, got Trump in in 2016.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.419]  The Democrats admit that.
[00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:13.340]  Trump has said that.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.000]  And they'll never forgive me for it.
[00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.330]  And now they've got Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan to deal with.
[00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:19.950]  And now everybody sounds like Alex Jones.
[00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.870]  But they want to silence me to get our catalog of material off the internet because it's not evergreen.
[00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:27.269]  Evergreen just means it stays good.
[00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.870]  It's ultragreen.
[00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:30.269]  Ultragreen.
[00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:33.110]  Ultragreen, which means it gets better over time.
[00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:34.149]  So save all the clips.
[00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:35.190]  Download InfoWars.
[00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:36.269]  It's always been free to the world.
[00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.649]  Share it with everybody you know.
[00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.830]  And just know that they're scared of what's at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.289]  They're scared of what's at Man.Video.
[00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.950]  I sat there and told the U.S. trustee in a meeting two weeks ago.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.279]  He said, well, and we're going to sell Bandot Video and all the content.
[00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:51.980]  I said, it's 95% other contributors.
[00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.340]  There's a contract on it, like YouTube, that we're just a...
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.080]  platform for them, like a utility, and they go, well, we're still saying we own it all.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.500]  So anybody on Bandot Video, you might want to follow the federal court in objection because they're saying they own your documentaries, your shows, your interviews.
[00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:16.879]  We're just another platform like Rumble or, you know, like X, but they're saying, nope, we own that too because it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.759]  So that's what they're doing.
[00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:21.980]  And the U.S. Trustee said, oh, we're not going to try to get real Alex Jones.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.480]  Oh, no, no.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.820]  Well, yeah, actually we are.
[00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:28.590]  So That's how it's going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:30.929]  That's how it's going down.
[00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.690]  That's how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:35.450]  People tell me, hey, you better be nice to do you.
[00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:36.110]  That's just to you.
[00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.110]  He's still over your personal bankruptcy in your house and all that.
[00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.549]  Hey, you put a gun to my head.
[00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.029]  Establishment, I'll never back down off the truth.
[00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:44.909]  I'll never waver.
[00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.669]  I'll never falter.
[00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.549]  I'll never give up.
[00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.590]  We're closing them.
[00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:57.330]  We can stop them together.
[00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.590]  And don't just think there's 19 days of the election and it's all over.
[00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.250]  Then there's a 76 days of always president-elect where they say they're going to have civil war conditions.
[00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.870]  When all the civil war comes, they go, oh, look, we told you Trump was going to do it.
[00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:45.460]  When they're the ones setting it all up and portraying the military literally Clothes
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.539]  of garlic to vampires.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.299]  Silver to werewolves.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.159]  Water to witches.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.779]  I'm melting.
[00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:54.360]  I'm melting.
[00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:56.259]  I'll get you and your free speech, too.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.600]  And I'll get your identity, too.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.000]  My pretty.
[00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:01.139]  There's a special one for you.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.659]  I'll see you in the fight.
