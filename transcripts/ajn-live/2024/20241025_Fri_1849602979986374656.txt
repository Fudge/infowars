[00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.790]  Is the United States currently at war with North Korea?
[00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:06.870]  The answer is yes.
[00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:13.630]  I'm not talking about the Korean troops massing in Russia that have now reportedly invaded Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.
[00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.089]  Putin just confirmed the North Korean troops are there.
[00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.309]  No, I'm talking about the fact that on July 27th, 1953, there was a ceasefire in the Korean War between the US and South Korea's allies and North Korea and China.
[00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.870]  That war never ended.
[00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:38.070]  And now, North Korean dictator said last week, Kim Jong-un, that they're about to go to total war with South Korea and the United States.
[00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:49.210]  And now, the reports of massing Korean troops inside Russia are confirmed, and now Ukraine and NATO are saying that the Ukrainians are now facing North Koreans on the battlefield.
[00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.750]  This is a completely insane escalation.
[00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:04.269]  So the answer is, yes, we're at war with North Korea, and now it's going hot again because U.S. forces and other NATO forces have been confirmed to be on the ground fighting Russians as well.
[00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.819]  That means Western forces Are now fighting North Koreans as well as Russians.
[00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:10.799]  This is insane.
[00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.859]  It leads right to full conflict and nuclear war.
[00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.920]  We're about to break it down right now.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.900]  It's official.
[00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.159]  North Korean troops have been massing inside Russia for at least two weeks.
[00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.040]  Putin confirmed today that they are in the country.
[00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:49.670]  And Ukraine and NATO have both reported that they've been massing on the western border of Russia with Ukraine, and Ukrainian forces are now reporting that they have been coming into the country and may already be involved in combat operations.
[00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.890]  Now, let me explain for folks that don't study military history or current military postures what this means, okay?
[00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.909]  This is what a world war looks like.
[00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.090]  And you have NATO 13 years ago overthrowing the Ukrainian government and then having an ongoing proxy civil war going on.
[00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.349]  This is all admitted.
[00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.469]  George Soros has gone on CNN and bragged about it, Hillary Clinton, Victoria Newland.
[00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.509]  This is on record.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.240]  And then the Russians said, if you enter NATO or get ready to, we will invade and take part of the country as a security zone.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.520]  And Putin's been very open about that.
[00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.180]  What, six years ago, he came in and took a large part of southern Ukraine that's always been part of Russia.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.560]  And now they've got that area of control that they want in eastern Ukraine, that buffer zone.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.539]  And so NATO has been sending in French troops and British troops and others and giving them heavier and heavier weapons.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:06.180]  And five weeks ago, Biden authorized with Keir Starmer of the UK the transfer of the joint U.S.-British-made Storm Shadow missile, which Russia said is a huge escalation, so that they would escalate as well, and that if any of those missiles hit Russia, they might reserve the right,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.360]  or might use nuclear weapons.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.599]  So, this is massive escalation.
[00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.379]  So, first it was a rumor a few weeks ago that North Koreans were there.
[00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.300]  Then it was confirmed a few days ago.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.520]  Now it's confirmed they're on the border.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:27.129]  It's confirmed that there are special operations troops that Kim Jong-un's been showing off in these different, you know, kind of karate-esque Videos he's been putting out.
[00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.210]  I mean, this is insane stuff.
[00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:39.430]  And then two weeks ago, North Korea blows up a bunch of the bridges and railway bridges into South Korea, saying they're prepared to declare and launch total war.
[00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.409]  And then South Korea comes out a few days ago and says, well, if there are North Korean troops, we may send a bunch of heavy weapons into Ukraine to counter that.
[00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.909]  And so now North Korea is threatening South Korea more.
[00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.669]  This is how you get these world wars.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:16.660]  You have all these different competing factions that are lined up on different sides, and as it continues to ratchet up, the danger only intensifies, and you hit a certain point where all that is left is direct military confrontation between the main powers that were using the proxy powers for their hybrid war.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.290]  These are all technical terms, and so there's a Rand Corporation Threat ladder continuation of war.
[00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.810]  There's a bunch of other war games that have been similarly done by the Pentagon, and that model's followed by the Russians, the Chinese, everybody.
[00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.829]  The model's been around since the 1950s.
[00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:33.009]  It's always been updated, and it's very, very accurate.
[00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:37.649]  And that model, the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon, has been followed so far.
[00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:48.709]  And so it's rapidly accelerating into major armies attacking each other, the tactical nukes, and then regional theater nukes, and then all-out nuclear commitment.
[00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:55.470]  In most war games, once tactical nukes are used, within about an hour, total global nuclear war starts.
[00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.889]  And once that starts, the Indians and the Pakistanis are going to hit each other.
[00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:01.970]  China and India are going to hit each other.
[00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.860]  It's just, Israel's got a bunch of nukes, Iran's got them, so does Saudi Arabia.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.720]  It will just absolutely descend into thermonuclear Armageddon.
[00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:28.920]  And so yes, we are sleepwalking into this, and the reason earlier generals and NATO did not push up all the way to Russia's borders like this, they already expanded a lot, but not to this point, was because they said it will quickly ratchet up into a full war.
[00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.529]  We're now right at the full war part.
[00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.810]  In fact, I'm debating whether saying World War III has already begun with the North Korean troops, who are completely militaristic, completely brainwashed.
[00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.009]  The Korean War never ended.
[00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.009]  It's a ceasefire.
[00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.889]  It was a proxy war between the United States and China.
[00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:49.250]  It was a U.N. police action, but it really was a war.
[00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.829]  Millions of Chinese, three million came across, pushed the U.S. forces down to the river.
[00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.050]  MacArthur threatened to use nukes.
[00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.910]  Truman fired him because MacArthur was going to not follow the order and still use the nukes or atomic bombs at that time, and it barely got stopped.
[00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.730]  So, it's been said that in history, wars never end.
[00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.970]  They just get postponed to a later date.
[00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.970]  It's kind of like halftime.
[00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:27.730]  Most experts have, throughout the last few decades, and I agree with them because I studied quite a bit myself, have said that either Korea will be the trigger for nuclear war, or These Eastern European NATO expansions will.
[00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:29.810]  Well, now you've got both of the ingredients.
[00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.829]  I never heard or imagined that there'd be North Korean troops in Central Europe.
[00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.750]  I mean, that's a Red Dawn scenario out of a Hollywood movie.
[00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:53.589]  Millos put out, by the way, it's a great movie, but I mean, you've got this mix of North Koreans and Chinese and Cubans and Russians inside the United States.
[00:06:53.769 --> 00:07:05.449]  Of course, that really comes from the Weathermen plans that came out in court where they were planning in the 70s to break down the US by breaking down the economy, the welfare, have it collapse, cloud, pivot, and then bring in a consortium of Cubans and North Koreans and Chinese.
[00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.269]  I mean, that was testified to, that came out in their documents.
[00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:18.629]  So that's actually based on some of the wild fantasies of the Communist Party USA I never thought that you would actually see something like that unfolding.
[00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:21.189]  I mean, this is Really dangerous.
[00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.029]  So it is NATO that started the conflict over 13 years ago.
[00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:28.569]  It is NATO that tried to expand itself and did this.
[00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.430]  Now there's open talk about nukes being given or Ukraine allowing you to develop their own.
[00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:37.089]  And they were nuclear power, but that was the old Soviet Union as part of that block.
[00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.189]  And those weapons were given up decades ago.
[00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:46.250]  So that's all there is left to escalate is major armies and no more proxy war, just direct armies.
[00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.649]  And then that leads to a nuclear war.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.540]  And I just can't believe we're even to this point in 2024.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.399]  Oh, and then you've got Israel, you know, leaking a few weeks ago and being confirmed last week, planning to strike before the election, Iran.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:06.019]  And you've got all of that incredible destabilization going on and a perfect October surprise for the campaign.
[00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:21.300]  And then you've got the Harris, Biden, Obama blob, whoever's really running it, Putting out executive orders and then corresponding Pentagon directives for civil unrest and shooting American citizens.
[00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:29.259]  And then they're strangely saying, Trump's going to kill American citizens with the military with no evidence, just out of clear blue sky, while they're the ones gearing up for it.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.259]  They're planning some big stuff.
[00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.029]  Full war with Russia?
[00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.389]  Israel attacking Iran?
[00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:36.470]  Already basically on the table.
[00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:38.769]  Economic collapse?
[00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:42.250]  Will the deep state do some false flags and blame Trump supporters?
[00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:47.509]  I was watching Fox News 10 minutes ago, getting a cup of coffee, and it was Harris.
[00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.450]  Trump's racist.
[00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.289]  He's going to get you.
[00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.610]  He's going to use the military again.
[00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.230]  What?
[00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.850]  Trump's going to do something to black people?
[00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:55.269]  Trump's going to use the military?
[00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.570]  Where is this coming from?
[00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.529]  They are pre-programming this, not just Kamala and Biden, because they're total kooks and say random stuff sometimes.
[00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:03.190]  No, no, no.
[00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.370]  The people loading the teleprompters, the talking points are saying this.
[00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.590]  So, is the trigger false flags blamed on Trump supporters?
[00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.509]  Mass shootings, bombings of black churches or something?
[00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.570]  Is it total war?
[00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:17.850]  Is it a financial collapse?
[00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.710]  Is it all of it?
[00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:27.110]  And then Raskin, another top Democrat strategist, have said, and so has Carble, it's time for a violent uprising if Trump wins and we're not going to accept it.
[00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:28.289]  We're going to have civil war conditions.
[00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:29.389]  These are all quotes of them.
[00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:29.970]  You've seen it all.
[00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.889]  This is all widely publicized.
[00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.909]  And they're not going to certify Trump's re-election?
[00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:37.950]  And now it's going to take weeks and weeks for the election?
[00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.950]  They're already trying to steal it.
[00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.549]  They're already putting it into crisis.
[00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:42.450]  This isn't coming.
[00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:45.370]  It's not a question in 10 days, 11 days at the election.
[00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:47.529]  It's happened.
[00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.370]  So I kept warning.
[00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:50.909]  Four years ago, it was 79 days of hell.
[00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:57.350]  This time it's 76 between the election November 5th and January 20th, 21st when Trump gets inaugurated.
[00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:03.649]  And if you add it all together, 10, 11 days and 76, I mean, there we are.
[00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.529]  It's that number of days.
[00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:06.690]  80-something days.
[00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:22.210]  That we've got to deal with here when there's just an open power war going on between the people that want prosperity to stop World War III and control the borders and stop the human trafficking and all the drag queen pedophile time and the devalued dollar and the inflation and the insanity.
[00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:39.759]  With these big globalist BlackRock bankers that feel insulated because they've got lawyers and military and intelligence agencies carrying out their operations, they're admittedly in control, and they feel like in their ivory towers and on their 300-foot super yachts and their castle-top chateaus that they're insulated,
[00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:41.899]  and you're not insulated from nuclear war.
[00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:44.019]  You're not insulated from bioweapon releases.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.940]  You're not insulated.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.059]  So, I've been on there 30 years, I've studied history, and I've never seen a time in world history this dangerous.
[00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:54.240]  And I don't think anybody can disagree with me.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.519]  Left, right, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:05.419]  And even if somebody calls themselves a leftist and supports Kamala and the Ukraine war and all this insanity, you can't pull back and admit this isn't good.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:12.320]  I mean, you do know the West started the war, overthrowing the elected government in Ukraine decades ago, 13, 14 years ago.
[00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:13.740]  I mean, that is admitted.
[00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:28.549]  And then you notice these escalations just, okay, first it's a coup, then it's a proxy revolution and civil war, and then it's, and then now we've got Ukrainian-trained U.S. mercenaries trying to kill Trump.
[00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:35.190]  We've got memos from the FBI saying, oh yeah, you know, Ukrainians in the U.S. might do terror attacks or Russians during the election.
[00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.629]  There's going to be cyber attacks.
[00:11:37.049 --> 00:11:39.230]  All hell has already broken loose.
[00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:51.909]  And I'm simply saying everybody better start focusing on all of these crises and how they're all coming together in a perfect storm and de-escalate this craziness now.
[00:11:52.049 --> 00:12:00.870]  Because in the big think tanks, in the big tax-free foundations, they create the policy for the intelligence agencies, the corporations that implement the globalist system.
[00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.789]  They're also specialized on their little area.
[00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:12.480]  But when you look at all the different sectors together, Everything the West has been doing is killing the dollar, destroying soft power of the West.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.240]  Our elites are totally discredited and hated because they deserve to be.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.500]  And they're busy trying to start wars with the Chinese, the Russians, the American people.
[00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:27.600]  They're sending the FBI into churches and Catholic churches and harassing parents at school board meetings.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.419]  They don't want critical race theory taught or having some trans student rape their daughter.
[00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:35.500]  I mean, this is lunatic asylum stuff.
[00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.059]  I thought Hitler was crazy.
[00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:41.480]  I mean, he loses in North Africa and he's losing the Battle of Britain.
[00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:47.009]  And so he turns and attacks Russia with Operation Barbarossa in 1942.
[00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:52.210]  And within a year, the Germans' military knew they were going to lose, and they said it'd take a few years.
[00:12:52.450 --> 00:13:00.210]  They told Hitler, and if Hitler was told that, he would have those generals executed, hung by piano wire, or made to take cyanide.
[00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.870]  And I'm like, why did Hitler do that?
[00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.129]  I mean, I look at the current establishment and they're like a fat person in a buffet.
[00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.230]  They're like, well, let's start this war.
[00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.909]  Let's start that fight.
[00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:11.409]  Let's do this.
[00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:11.929]  Let's do that.
[00:13:12.309 --> 00:13:16.289]  And the tighter they squeeze, the more of their globalist power slips out of their fingers.
[00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:20.210]  And so if you're an accelerationist, you can say, well, that's a good thing then.
[00:13:20.789 --> 00:13:22.230]  That's a wonderful thing.
[00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:30.409]  You can't accelerate something that's dangerous and cut off the food supply and the energy and start all these wars, which they're doing.
[00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.700]  And then hope, oh, they miscalculated the takedown of civilization will get the globalists too.
[00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:45.759]  See, the public needs to know this destabilization is not good, and the globalists need to know that the pit they've dug for us, they've already fallen in.
[00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:47.720]  I mean, they're getting the blame, and they deserve it.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.440]  So, this is crazy, town.
[00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:58.659]  And they think blaming some false flags and claiming all these crises come to a head with some type of race conflict, as they're openly saying?
[00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:01.809]  Is going to somehow make everybody divert onto that?
[00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:12.450]  Just because you produce an Obama movie on Netflix about white on black stuff and you got, you know, Civil War that's based on that with a high budget, you think now like, oh, it's in a movie.
[00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.309]  We're going to buy that story now here.
[00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.309]  No.
[00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:19.980]  People know you cooked up COVID. We know you released it.
[00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:21.220]  We know you gave us poisoned shots.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.740]  We know there's 30 million dead from the shots.
[00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:24.419]  We know it destroys your immune system.
[00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:25.679]  We know you're bad.
[00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:26.639]  We know you're a death cult.
[00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.580]  We know you're out to get us.
[00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.480]  Elon Musk knows it.
[00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:29.279]  Tucker Carlson knows it.
[00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:30.200]  Joe Rogan knows it.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.620]  I know it.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.899]  All the most popular talk show hosts are talking about it.
[00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:36.120]  The public has awoken and they're getting more awake by the minute.
[00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:47.840]  And I just want to tell the people on the fence still serving the establishment, all you educated idiots and you think you know everything academics and people, You're going to end up waking up.
[00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:51.259]  The question is, how bad is it going to have to get?
[00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:53.620]  Does it have to be nuclear war?
[00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:58.039]  I mean, you got Sean Penn, two years ago going, well, nuclear war needs to still be on the table.
[00:14:58.139 --> 00:14:59.700]  We need to, you know, go ahead and maybe have one.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.379]  What?
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.059]  That's liberal?
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.179]  That's crazy!
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:14.500]  So, you guys are crazier than Hitler, already getting beaten, so he turns and attacks Russia.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.940]  And you know how that ended.
[00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:26.299]  Okay, North Korean troops are in Russia for combat, reportedly according to the Ukrainians, and I believe it because they're there for war.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.019]  You can see them massing, there's special forces, and they're going in.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.799]  And let's just say this.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.879]  This is just a test.
[00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:41.460]  I guarantee you the North Koreans have told Putin that he wants 500,000 troops because they got a three million person army.
[00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.299]  And that's standing, that's not their auxiliary.
[00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:45.620]  And they are brainwashed.
[00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:49.200]  I mean, it's not good.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:59.740]  And I guarantee you, I guarantee you that you already see the Ukrainian lines have already collapsed.
[00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:03.919]  So some are saying this is going to be Russia taking all Ukraine.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.679]  Russia doesn't need Ukraine.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.580]  They don't want Ukraine.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.700]  They've been very clear about that.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.419]  But they are going to go ahead and this continues and fully crush the Ukrainian military.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:21.779]  Because they know that NATO is starting to move in foreign troops, so they may have to occupy even more of Ukraine to stop that.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.519]  And that's why NATO said it's going to be a 20-year war.
[00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:30.379]  They said the new economy in Europe, officially, NATO, the French leaders, others, it's going to be war.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:38.519]  And they believe that ongoing crisis will be their pretext to crack down domestic populations, raise taxes, and have control because of the Russian boogeyman.
[00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:52.120]  But the Germans know it was the U.S. government with NATO that blew up the Nord Stream pipeline, which they now admit they did, which doubled prices of energy for electricity and heating in Europe, in Western Europe.
[00:16:52.259 --> 00:17:01.710]  So the globalists don't care about anybody but themselves, and if they feel insulated from all this, they will continue to push the world into Total destruction.
[00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:07.230]  The good news is, I believe Saner Mines will win out at the end of the day.
[00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.130]  All I know is, we have to get this out to people.
[00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.910]  Just because you're watching this and you're informed, that's why you sought this out.
[00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:19.930]  Now we need to get this to people that are still thinking Netflix is important or the NFL is important, and explain to them what all this means.
[00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.769]  Because the old financial system is coming to an end.
[00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:23.410]  The globalists admit that.
[00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:29.829]  And so there's other systems being launched, like the BRICS, and that's when you get these big global conflicts, is when these different empires collide.
[00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:31.650]  China's economy's shot.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.680]  Europe's economy is shut.
[00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:40.019]  The political elites here have been consolidating power on purpose, but they've overdone it.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.640]  So the economy is really shut.
[00:17:41.859 --> 00:17:44.980]  And what do politicians and elites do when they're cornered?
[00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.619]  They always go for the war trigger.
[00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:56.299]  And I see the globalists just warming up martial law, warming up civil unrest, warming up the military to kill citizens, all this craziness.
[00:17:56.599 --> 00:18:00.799]  And it's just every front you look at is just maximum insanity.
[00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.130]  And then you look at the caliber of the managerial class.
[00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:12.049]  It's a bunch of crazy front puppets and then a bunch of different bureaucracies that can't even agree with each other.
[00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.690]  And this whole thing is on autopilot.
[00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:17.329]  Like a steamroller that doesn't have a driver.
[00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:25.710]  And you can smell and see and taste and intellectually analyze the doom we're talking about.
[00:18:25.869 --> 00:18:26.230]  So...
[00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.910]  I'm wringing my hands here.
[00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.049]  I just...
[00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:32.779]  What war do you need to see?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.279]  Well, maybe you need to see mushroom clouds.
[00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.980]  And that's what I'm really trying to avert.
[00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:36.819]  Because I like living.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.740]  I like civilization.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.519]  I like life.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:46.259]  And I'm sure if there is a nuclear war, the survivors down the road will really be anti-war in the future.
[00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.160]  I mean, I guess that will finally...
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.519]  But I guess we have short memories.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:50.920]  Who knows?
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.180]  We might have a nuclear war now and maybe have one another 100 years.
[00:18:53.619 --> 00:18:56.319]  You know, once we reconstitute some type of civilization, even if we survive.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.900]  Because you know it's not just the nukes that aren't that radioactive after they dissipate.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.839]  There's 450 something big reactors and they'll all melt down in nuclear war.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.940]  So that's Chernobyl times 400 and something.
[00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:18.839]  And then there's all these secret reactors, government reactors, military reactors, and then a lot of other little small research reactors.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.539]  There's thousands.
[00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:25.029]  And in a breakdown of civilization, most of those are going to have big problems.
[00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.789]  So that stuff will make the surface of the earth unlivable for hundreds of thousands of years.
[00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.309]  And maybe people think that's fun and cool.
[00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:43.950]  So, hey, civilization was good while it lasted, but I guess we're not really meant to sit here and just watch Netflix, the NFL, NFL all day.
[00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:51.500]  And if we get so decadent and don't care about our futures, we let a crazy political elite destroy us, then I guess that's just God's way of cleaning up the earth.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:57.680]  I mean, I guess in prophecy we're told God promised never to destroy the earth by water, but by fire.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.599]  So, maybe it's all just a big barbecue and we're going to be the hamburgers on the grill.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.099]  Alright, I'm being a little bit macabre here, a little bit of dark satire.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:14.559]  We really must stop this for our species, for our ancestors, more importantly for our children and future generations.
[00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:24.539]  We don't need to do this to each other, but we have to admit it's a real threat and not have a normalcy bias about it and just let these psychotic elites who need to have the keys of power taken away from them be in control.
[00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:33.049]  And I really need you to follow us right here at RealAlexJonesOnX and to get others to follow and to share the reports as you are doing.
[00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.150]  I want to commend you.
[00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.549]  We're having a big effect right now, thanks to you.
[00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.630]  And then also, we've launched something really important.
[00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.450]  It's already got a lot of original content and reports on it, but there'll be a lot more starting next week.
[00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.849]  And that's the Alex Jones Network, and that's AJN.com.
[00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:54.069]  Live, just at AJNLive, right here on X. A lot of powerful global forces around to take away the Real Elks Jones channel.
[00:20:54.250 --> 00:21:00.049]  They don't really have a claim to that, but regardless, it's important that in the face of these attempts to cut off our head, we just grow two or three more.
[00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:07.809]  We've got some other things like that happening as well, so be sure and follow all our work right here at AJNLive, at AJNLive.
[00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:11.059]  And please support the broadcast as you've been doing.

[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.140]  Thank you so much.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.180]  We are announcing Ultimate Hydroforce.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.920]  Now, this is not just electrolytes, okay?
[00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:32.180]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.680]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:53.589]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.029]  and more.
[00:21:55.309 --> 00:21:56.930]  Potassium, the list goes on and on.
[00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.890]  And it's all the highest quality sources of it on top of that.
[00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:08.359]  And then it funds my broadcast, And the crew and all of us continuing on.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.799]  So we need your support if InfoWars shuts down November 13th to continue on.
[00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:16.000]  Regardless, it's gonna help us up our game if InfoWars survives.
[00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:24.759]  So please, go check out this amazing supplement, the highest quality you're gonna find, with big discounts and other great supplements at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:37.210]  We sought out The very best, highest quality, rehydrating product for pre-workout, post-workout, you name it.
[00:22:37.509 --> 00:22:41.490]  And we found a top company with top reviews with Let Us Private Label It.
[00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.170]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.950]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.589]  It's a superfood.
[00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.509]  It's a pre-workout.
[00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:50.470]  It's a post-workout.
[00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.269]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[00:22:54.849 --> 00:23:04.230]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydroforce.
[00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:11.069]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:13.390]  This baby is next level.
[00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:19.390]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:30.470]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:32.950]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[00:23:33.069 --> 00:23:34.369]  So there's a line out the door.
[00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:42.869]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.470]  And why is that?
[00:23:44.569 --> 00:23:45.170]  Well, it's simple.
[00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:49.130]  This is called Ultimate Hydroforce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:53.390]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, pre-workout.
[00:23:53.569 --> 00:23:57.230]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you'd say.
[00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:03.829]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.170]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at TheAlexYoungStore.com.
