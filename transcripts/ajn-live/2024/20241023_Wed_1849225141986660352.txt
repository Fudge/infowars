[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.699]  Just days before President Trump was grazed by an assassin's bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th, I went on air, on record, and said they are going to try to kill Trump imminently because they were openly saying he's going to be a dictator.
[00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.000]  He's going to use the military against the American people.
[00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.839]  He's going to use the military to kill the American people.
[00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.390]  It's so obvious that they're trying to legitimize the murder of President Trump.
[00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.429]  And Glenn Beck came out today.
[00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.109]  It's a short clip.
[00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.870]  I'll play in a moment.
[00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.369]  And did a great job explaining what he and his great security team, the former military, are seeing as well.
[00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.829]  The best way to take out Trump, if you're the deep state, God forbid, is a service-to-air missile.
[00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:44.310]  Then you blame it on Iran.
[00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.670]  But I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.159]  But look at the backdrop of what we're now seeing.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.600]  They're back with an Atlantic Monthly publication, and that is literally the CIA, if you look into it, totally connected to Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:15.939]  I mean, the real bowels of the worst parts of the permanent state that is the swamp, it's D.C., As you know, they came out last night and recycled, but nobody pointed that out, an already debunked story by General Kelly that came out in his book two years ago that I'll show you in a moment,
[00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.959]  that Trump basically likes Hitler.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.659]  But all the witnesses in the meeting said it wasn't true.
[00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.140]  Kelly's a disgruntled globalist, a New World Order mole.
[00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.290]  Kamala comes out today and says that, oh, Trump loves someone that killed six million Jews.
[00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.150]  It's absolutely preposterous.
[00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.189]  Trump has always been pro-Israel his entire adult life.
[00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.930]  His daughter, you know, has converted to Judaism.
[00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.730]  He moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.909]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:46.689]  He got the Abraham Accords.
[00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.650]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:01:49.769 --> 00:02:04.829]  But Then they add this new lie that when Trump offered to pay for a Hispanic veteran that got brutally murdered on a US base, a nice thing Trump did, they reportedly heard that the bill was $60,000 and said,
[00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.250]  that's too much for a damn Mexican.
[00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.599]  And all the witnesses that now come forward and said that's not true, including Mark Meadows.
[00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.699]  It's debunked.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.360]  It's a hoax.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500]  But the Democrats are already running TV ads everywhere and aren't going to retract it.
[00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.979]  So lawsuits are now reportedly going to be filed, including by the family members of this lady who were also there and said none of this happened.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.000]  I mean, this is...
[00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.370]  Even if Trump was some closet racist, why would he just offer to pay for a Hispanic veteran's funeral?
[00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.610]  And why would he then shoot his mouth off in front of all these other people knowing they would go talk about it?
[00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.270]  I mean, this is just ridiculous, but it's the same recycled lies over and over again.
[00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.750]  So before I play the Glenn Beck clip, let me show you a few of these articles.
[00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.030]  Kamala Harris, incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler.
[00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.969]  And it's a five-minute...
[00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.159]  Statement of a teleprompter.
[00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.139]  It's disgusting.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.979]  Most of you have already seen it.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.500]  Here's the London Guardian article from two years ago in August of 2022.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.939]  Old recycled lie.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.319]  Trump wanted Pentagon generals to be like Second World War Nazis.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.060]  Same thing.
[00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:16.800]  They just put it in this new article with the other hoax about Trump talking bad about a dead veteran.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.120]  Mark Meadows denies report on Trump's funeral cost comments.
[00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:23.860]  Here's another one.
[00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.379]  So that's what Atlantic Monthly does.
[00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.580]  They lie, they lie, they lie again and expect to see more of this desperation garbage.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.860]  But separately, you've got Carville on TV saying we want an armed uprising.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.479]  Trump's going to come after the black people.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.460]  You've got Harris again yesterday and four or five times last week saying Trump's coming to kill you with the military.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.319]  And then we've got this from last month.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.120]  That we've been covering for over a month that finally got coverage in the last week.
[00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:29.680]  It is DOD manual 5240.01 that takes the executive orders put out by Biden, reissued and expanded, to prepare for civil unrest, quote, and lethal force against American citizens.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.620]  Go read page 14, 13, and 12.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.620]  But it also gets into total takeover.
[00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.829]  I mean, this is absolutely crazy stuff.
[00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:43.410]  Overhead shot.
[00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.029]  I'm going to show TV viewers right from the document.
[00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.449]  Here's page 14.
[00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.870]  I mean, it's all right here.
[00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.790]  And it's admitted they've done this.
[00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.350]  So they're claiming Trump is getting ready for all this, to do all this, and he's doing nothing.
[00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:06.490]  And then they're the ones openly preparing and calling for civil war conditions, Jamie Raskin said.
[00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.329]  All these other pundits saying we need to have a violent uprising.
[00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.250]  This is so dangerous.
[00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.589]  But I totally agree with Glenn Beck.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.879]  And his great security folks, I've met some of them, retired Navy SEALs, Army Special Operations, you name it.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.879]  They've concurred with my warning of service-to-air missiles.
[00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:31.720]  And I said before the media started saying Iran may shoot Trump down with a smuggled service-to-air missile when he takes off her lands, it's the easiest place to get him.
[00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.139]  I said they're going to start hyping that and blame Iran.
[00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.120]  Sure enough, they're doing it because they want to hit Iran as well.
[00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.180]  That way they can get two birds.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.759]  With one stone.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.620]  So they're the ones promoting martial law.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.220]  They're the ones promoting civil unrest.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.899]  They're the ones promoting all of these armed uprisings while saying Trump's gonna do it.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:03.199]  And I gotta say, I love Trump and he does an A-plus job, but where is Trump responding to Kamala and Tampon Tim and all their surrogates constantly saying that he's gonna send the military to kill you?
[00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:04.879]  Hell, Biden said it yesterday.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.379]  And then so we gotta lock him up before he kills us.
[00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:16.879]  They just took the Supreme Court ruling saying he has executive immunity, which is in the Constitution, when acting as the president.
[00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.879]  But he doesn't have immunity from impeachment, and he doesn't have impeachment from not being reelected.
[00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.389]  If the executive doesn't have immunity from basic things, it can't ever operate because the other branches will take it over.
[00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.389]  Trump never said, I can kill anybody I want, and that's not what that power does.
[00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:40.589]  If he doesn't have immunity, the Secretary of State of Maine or anywhere like they've done could take him off the ballot.
[00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.319]  So this is just a wild, wild time.
[00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.000]  They're desperate.
[00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.740]  They don't know what to do.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:07:05.500]  They're now pulling the same playbook in 2020 now of all these phantom voters, hundreds of thousands per major state, 500,000 in Michigan that they said weren't there, but the Republicans paid to have the rolls looked at and 500 plus thousand have never been on the voter rolls and are just phantom names on there,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.339]  but they get to vote.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:16.639]  Texas Secretary of State says illegals can vote if they've got a non-state, you know, non-illegal ID, non-citizen ID, just any ID, they can vote.
[00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:33.620]  I mean, this is crazy, and it's all happening right now, and it's just being normalized to live under this level of censorship and control, and the government smuggling 325,000 kids they admit are missing, and covering the tracks of where they went, many in slave labor and sex slavery,
[00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:38.750]  and that's all Kamala and And Mayorkas and Biden, I mean, these are real villains.
[00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.649]  And look, I've been covering this 30 years.
[00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:41.550]  I knew they were bad news.
[00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:47.850]  But the openness of it, the craziness of it is simply next level.
[00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.910]  So get this report out.
[00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:56.389]  We need Trump to come out and respond and say, Kamala, you're the one or whoever's running your administration that's part of this coup.
[00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.069]  You've been illegally appointed.
[00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.250]  Biden had a medical emergency, disappears.
[00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.829]  A fake resignation letter comes out.
[00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:10.009]  And then eight days later, he kind of halfway steps down, and Pelosi says the letter's fake, and it's not from Biden.
[00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.870]  Anybody can see that.
[00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.910]  It wasn't a White House letterhead.
[00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.610]  It wasn't his signature.
[00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:15.449]  So they're all covering their ass, saying they don't know where the letter came from.
[00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:20.029]  And based off this fake letter, she now is the nominee with zero votes?
[00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:26.170]  And then whoever's running the White House in this coup is preparing the military for martial law to kill citizens?
[00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.949]  Well, then they say Trump's doing it?
[00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.570]  I agree with Glenn Beck, and I agree with many others.
[00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.669]  I mean, they are gonna take another shot in the next 12 days against President Trump.
[00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.190]  So, how do we stop that from happening?
[00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.129]  And what do we do if they're successful?
[00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.070]  Well, you know they're gonna stage false flags and say that we did something violent because we're mad.
[00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.149]  Don't do that.
[00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.929]  That's what they want.
[00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:50.450]  But they're gonna provocateur it.
[00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.110]  They're gonna set it up.
[00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:52.049]  They're gonna make sure it happens.
[00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.929]  And then also...
[00:08:54.559 --> 00:09:00.139]  We've now learned for months Trump's been trying to get a C-130 or other aircraft when he comes in for landing or takes off.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.899]  That's where a surface-to-air missile would get you generally.
[00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:10.700]  You know, the shorter-range ones the Iranians could, or the deep state could have and then blame the Iranians for, is when he comes in for landing or takeoff.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.940]  And if you have a C-130 or other aircraft that has those flares, they pick up a missile launch, they launch the flares, it's 99% protection on average.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.139]  Well, it turns out Biden said he'd give Trump the protection, still hasn't done it.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.399]  I confirmed it today with the campaign.
[00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:38.370]  So Trump has a tiny Secret Service detail, no protection, and they can smuggle a bomb on the plane, they can have somebody posing as a worker put one inside the fuselage, up in the landing gear, or they can use a service-to-air missile and then blame Iran.
[00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:43.110]  So this is an emergency, and I'm glad Glenn Beck is talking about this.
[00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.549]  We need more people to talk about service-to-air missiles, service-to-air missiles, service-to-air missiles.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.000]  And we also need people to talk about she was installed.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.899]  It's a coup.
[00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:52.879]  It's already in place.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.340]  And now it's going to try to stay another four years at least.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.580]  And it goes back to George Herbert Walker Bush and the CIA coup.
[00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:59.860]  They tried to kill Reagan.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.340]  Once he got into office in 88, it's been Clinton who's CIA and then right on through.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.639]  And then Trump interrupted that and made them so upset.
[00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:10.539]  So here's Glenn Beck.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.039]  This is important.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.279]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:16.799]  We've got to raise awareness that we know it's the deep state.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.460]  And if they know the public's aware, they may back off and let Trump win the election and not kill him.
[00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:26.419]  And then they just hand him the collapsing economy, and they'll go after him that way.
[00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:29.419]  But still, we've got a lot better chance to turn this around peacefully that way.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.539]  So let's work as hard as we can.
[00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:33.279]  Please share this report right now.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.820]  Here's Glenn Beck.
[00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:38.399]  And I saw his security, and they have greatly beefed it up.
[00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:43.870]  But when I left, My security, I think, is some of the best in the world.
[00:10:44.149 --> 00:11:03.870]  I have my two head guys were the domestic protection, head of the domestic protection, and then the other was the foreign protection of, let's just say, a name you know and one of the top five richest people in the world.
[00:11:04.049 --> 00:11:05.250]  They both worked for me.
[00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:19.580]  And when they left that event, And seeing Secret Service and then seeing the airport and everything else, the head of my security said, I don't, I have a very bad feeling, Glenn.
[00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:20.940]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.080]  And he's never said anything like this before.
[00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:24.580]  I have a very bad feeling.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.019]  I'm not sure he's going to make it to January 20th.
[00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:34.100]  He was specifically worried about Donald Trump's airplane being shot out of the sky.
[00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:38.360]  But as he has said, it could happen a million ways.
[00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:44.620]  You have the leaders of this country juicing people up.
[00:11:45.169 --> 00:12:00.649]  You have AI and algorithms that can so easily find, I could say to Google today, find people in this state that are disturbed, don't like Trump already,
[00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.649]  maybe a little schizophrenic and likes guns.
[00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:07.389]  I could have that within a minute, the name.
[00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:22.389]  Now, take these five names and coax them into, without anybody knowing, ephemeral coaxing, so there's no record of it, and coax them into thinking they have to shoot the President of the United States.
[00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:24.529]  That's all real.
[00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:28.149]  What is Kamala Harris doing?
[00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:31.330]  What aren't they willing to do for power?
[00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:38.029]  When you see people hungry for power that they will do that, God help us.
[00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.309]  God help us.
[00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:41.110]  Don't give them more power.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.940]  Glenn, we are out of time.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.039]  I agree with you.
[00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.559]  I think they're going to try to kill Trump again before Election Day.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.980]  The surge is out of control right now, as with early voting.
[00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:55.899]  The vibes are gone and the joy is gone.
[00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:57.399]  And you are right.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.399]  This is a point that our mutual friend Dennis Prager has made for as long as I've been following him.
[00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:04.539]  If you believe somebody is Hitler, what wouldn't you do?
[00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:14.019]  What it is, is a dog whistle to every single sleeper cell and every crazy person out there, every schizophrenic person that might have a firearm.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.559]  It's okay now to go after Donald Trump.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.860]  These are desperate people.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.600]  These are the worst of society.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.360]  Yes, 20 seconds, Glenn.
[00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.450]  This is what Propaganda Wars is really about.
[00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.529]  They've pushed mental illness onto this country.
[00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.210]  So many people are still wearing masks.
[00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:41.330]  They have taken maybe even a third of the country and just locked them into crazy town.
[00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:43.889]  People say they have a bad feeling.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:57.480]  Your subconscious brain is, on average, it's estimated by a neurologist, about 100 times more powerful than your focused cerebral cortex that just takes all that knowledge your brain's got and all the processing going on and then focuses it into your attention.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.399]  When you have a bad feeling, it's because your brain has already percolated all this information.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.740]  It makes the best AI look like a joke.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.480]  And you have a bad feeling because you've already collated the data, you're just not consciously looking at it.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.740]  But back...
[00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:13.570]  Walk through some of the evidence there.
[00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:21.289]  The feeling is based on this climate of them calling Trump Hitler and paving the way for him to, quote, deserve to die.
[00:14:21.409 --> 00:14:22.470]  So it's got to be exposed.
[00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.529]  They're also trying to keep Steve Bannon in prison.
[00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.049]  They're trying to shut down everybody.
[00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.149]  And they're very close to doing it at Infowars.
[00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:35.269]  But regardless, if they shut down Infowars on November 13th, there are other operations, other backup systems that have been set up.
[00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.009]  But it takes funds to run those.
[00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:40.629]  So we make it easy to support my broadcast one way or another.
[00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:48.940]  And the way you do it is by following us on X. A lot of exclusive information is posted there at AJNLive.
[00:14:49.399 --> 00:15:01.200]  Be sure and follow that and tell other people to follow that because if you go to InfoWars or somewhere and it's gone, they're even trying to take my X. So be sure and follow the AJ Network.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.759]  They're AJNlive at AJNlive.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.679]  And separately, support our great sponsors that are separate from InfoWars.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.779]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:11.960]  My dad's a retired doctor.
[00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:13.980]  He helped develop a lot of these top supplements.
[00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:18.360]  Most of them are just private labeled, already top brands out there that we bring you at lower prices.
[00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.179]  A lot of them, we get the companies to soup them up, make them even stronger.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:29.059]  But one of the products that's proprietary It is simply amazing, and that is next-level foundational energy.
[00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:32.399]  Again, this is not a stimulant, so there's no letdown, no jitters, none of that.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:43.940]  It is concentrated, highest-quality, organic methylfolate that is the breakdown in the cells of what cells do with folic acid that's in spinach and stuff like that.
[00:15:44.019 --> 00:15:45.039]  That's why Popeye's so strong.
[00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:47.539]  Strong to the finish, because I eat my spinach.
[00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:49.059]  Popeye the Sailor Man.
[00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:53.559]  But seriously, The cells break it down to methylfolate.
[00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:57.700]  Well, most people can only break down a little bit of the methylfolate, particularly Anglos.
[00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:59.679]  Just search that and look it up.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.340]  It's a well-known genetic issue in white people, but everybody gets great energy from this.
[00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:07.679]  It's got a key B complex and other things that help supercharge into the cells.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.720]  No letdown.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:17.899]  You will be blown away on next-level foundational energy, particularly if you have some of the genetic absorption issues that most Europeans have, particularly Northern Europeans.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.019]  I know I had my genetics tested.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.059]  There's four genes associated with...
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:27.700]  We're good to go.
[00:16:38.419 --> 00:16:40.279]  Bouncing off the walls, but still sleep right on it.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.720]  So be sure and get your next level of financial energy at drjonesnaturals.com.

[00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:56.159]  So good for your immune system.

[00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.490]  It's got five-star reviews.
[00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.549]  But even if you don't have trouble sleeping, it will make it deeper and more restful.
[00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.369]  It's powerful.
[00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.410]  You need to try RocketRest, and it funds the operation.
[00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.890]  This is historic what's happening.
[00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.730]  We need your support right now to make sure we stay on the air.
[00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:18.609]  Go to drjosedactuals.com and get your RocketRest.

[00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:59.309]  I'm not going to lie, any really normal, powerful stimulant will have a little of that down, but it's nothing compared to some of the garbage that's out there.
[00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.789]  It's powerful, folks.
[00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:02.109]  Top Brain's not a game.
