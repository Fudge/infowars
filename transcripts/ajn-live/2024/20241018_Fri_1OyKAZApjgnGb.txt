[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]  Today, October 17th, 2024.
[00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.740]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:19.339]  We're only 25 days out now from the potential shutdown of InfoWars, and we are 18 days, really in a few hours, it'll be midnight, we are 17 days away from this pivotal referendum against the New World Order.
[00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.370]  And then we've got the 76 days when he's president-elect, when the Democrats have promised civil war conditions.
[00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.170]  They've signed executive orders and have the Pentagon put out reports for martial law to kill American citizens.
[00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.030]  And then crazily, they're everywhere saying Trump's going to do that.
[00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.729]  Clearly, they're telegraphing and preparing to try to steal the election again.
[00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.170]  They've said they're not going to certify a Trump win.
[00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.810]  They are going to create, in the words of Jamie Raskin, top Democrat strategist and congressman, and serious criminal in my view, civil war conditions.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.979]  They follow Saul Alinsky's rule for radicals, that's their handbook, admittedly, for the Clintons and all of them, to blame your opponent for what you are doing.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.379]  You're listening to Real Alex Jones, unfiltered, uncensored, and unrelenting truth, right here on the Alex Jones Network.
[00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.079]  I don't fight charity because I hate the tyrants.
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180]  Oh, I do hate them.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.540]  I do it because I love the people behind me I'm defending.
[00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.780]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.060]  I've been holding back my real capabilities.
[00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.140]  I'm most ashamed of it.
[00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:33.159]  It's a little scary.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.219]  I have decided, and I'm just now accessing the genetic memory codes to release my full potential against the new world.
[00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.579]  Good luck, globalists!
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.519]  Because if you thought Alex Jones was a problem before, I want you to throw everything you've got at me.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.860]  We're good to go.
[00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.110]  Whoever loads the teleprompters, whoever controls the executive orders in the Pentagon right now, is openly preparing martial law.
[00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.189]  What are you talking about saying, I'm going to do that, when you're actually, for the first time in U.S. history, putting out orders saying, get ready for it.
[00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:58.229]  So, patriots, populists, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, capitalists, people that just aren't insane, who are anti-globalists, anti-democratic party, anti-republican, neocon establishment, Need to understand, they're not running around the last few months intensifying in the last week through a cacophonous crescendo.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.620]  Of totally freaking out about civil war and martial law while they prepare it.
[00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.159]  Obviously, they're going to try to pull false flags, major crises, cyber attacks.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.879]  They're already saying the Trump supporters are going to launch with Putin.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:25.580]  I mean, all of this is total comic book nonsense, but they're the ones that have the motive to do it, and they're in control of the intelligence agencies and the big corporations that just gave us the giant COVID tyranny and years of lockdowns and poison shots and 30 million dead.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.800]  And that's why they want me off the air is because I study these people.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.620]  I told you decades ago they were trained in the military to take on the American people.
[00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.819]  I showed you secret documents.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.949]  And this new document is just a compendium of all those publicly You're like, well, what's new?
[00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.569]  It's new because they're publicly putting it out there and getting the military publicly ready for it.
[00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.870]  They're going from it being hidden to being revealed, which means they're considering going operational.
[00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:00.250]  I intend, I hope you intend, to expose them and to get Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else talking about it so that they're checkmated and can't make that move.
[00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.689]  But if they can pre-program, there's going to be civil war and martial law because it's Trump's fault.
[00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.409]  Low-information voters will think what's coming and all these crises they've cooked up are Trump's fault.
[00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.969]  So I've hammered this and hammered this, but now let's look at why they're so panicked.
[00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:30.490]  You've got the major polling indexes, you've got the major international betting indexes, have a 70% to 57% number of Trump winning, and Kamala is down in the low 40s or high 30s.
[00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.569]  This is some of the latest numbers out today.
[00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:49.449]  And the numbers are showing that the public thought she did a terrible job on that fiasco on Bret Baier, where they panicked yesterday and ended the so-called hour-long interview 27 minutes in and gave her the hook, though they then spun it, that she had this giant victory.
[00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.430]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:00.329]  But in case you're wondering who they are, here's a short compilation posted at Real Alex Jones right now, and we'll also post it here on the Alex Jones Network.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.160]  AJN on X at AJN Live.
[00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:04.519]  Be sure and follow us there.
[00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:09.759]  I want to thank those that are following us there because they're trying to shut down Infowars and take over my X account right now.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.920]  That's totally illegal, totally unconstitutional, violation of the 13th Amendment.
[00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:24.560]  Well, regardless, we're going to continue on air just like we are right now here at the AJN Network, AJN Live on X. So let's play this important little short compilation.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.279]  I hope you share it with everyone.
[00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:27.800]  Here's Waltz.
[00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:33.069]  And they're real statements on what they think about free speech here in America.
[00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.769]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation.
[00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.329]  If they don't moderate and monitor the content, we lose total control.
[00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.189]  Our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just hammer it out of existence.
[00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:54.850]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:56.230]  And that has to stop.
[00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.959]  Together, we can end free speech!
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.100]  Maha Alliance is responsible for the content of this advertising.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:14.199]  Think about how astounding those openly totalitarian, hyper-tyrannical statements are, and that's just a small sampling of their recent statements in the last few weeks.
[00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:15.800]  There's a lot more where that came from.
[00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.230]  They accused Trump of wanting to get rid of free speech and arrest everybody and weaponize the DOJ. They've done all that.
[00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.949]  They accused Trump of wanting martial law, civil war conditions, while they openly promote it.
[00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:30.870]  Elon Musk gets what's happening.
[00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.990]  He's all in.
[00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:38.970]  At a rally today in Folsom, Pennsylvania, he describes the process of tyranny at a town hall.
[00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.589]  The Second Amendment is there to protect the First Amendment.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.839]  As soon as the government can disarm the people, they can do anything they want.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.920]  We've seen this in one country after another.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:03.399]  They take the guns away from the people, then they do fake elections, and then the people try to protest and they just get shot.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:19.850]  Now, for anybody that's informed, anybody that can form a cognizant thought in their craniums, Kamala Harris in all of her interviews, unless it's off a teleprompter, she even does town halls for a teleprompter, Makes no sense.
[00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.990]  With Brett Baer yesterday, he said, why are you against IDs to vote?
[00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.930]  You need them for packed cigarettes, liquor, get on an airplane.
[00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.629]  They wanted you to have them, you know, during the COVID lockdowns, even go to the grocery store.
[00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:35.529]  And she said, well, because people in rural areas don't have photocopiers.
[00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:38.350]  Well, so you get driver's license from photocopiers?
[00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.629]  And let me assure her, it's not the Beverly Hillbillies in the country, almost everywhere.
[00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:52.319]  I mean, I... Grew up spending the summers on my grandmother's ranch in the 1980s, and they had personal computers and all sorts of stuff.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.879]  They knew how to skin a buck, run a trot line, and fix a truck, and they had degrees.
[00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:06.300]  So it just shows how ignorant they are as well in this idea that it's green acres or something for people that live in the rural areas, and it doesn't even make sense.
[00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:17.879]  So I wanted to play a little meme video here before Governor Newsom tries to have us arrested for False political news, obviously this is a meme, it's a sick joke, but it actually dovetails with reality.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.939]  Here is a discussion of the Democratic Party and how they are completely retarded.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.639]  Usually, the mentally retarded are divided into classifications.
[00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:47.789]  The educable, The trainable and the custodial.
[00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:56.330]  Obviously, we can only assess the abilities or potential of the mentally retarded on an individual basis.
[00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:04.889]  Seemingly random motions and movements are fairly common among the custodial retarded, and they may take many forms.
[00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:13.639]  Sometimes there are motions which seem to have no meaning whatever and may even cause unintentional Self-inflicted injuries.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.700]  The vast majority of the mentally retarded are intelligent enough that they can be taught a great many things.
[00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:27.059]  However, there's a wide range of ability, even among those considered educable.
[00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:32.980]  And their ability to learn obviously varies according to their level of intelligence.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.000]  Equally important is a stimulating environment.
[00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:43.600]  However, we must remember to set realistic standards that are not too high for the individual.
[00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:54.360]  Many of the trainable retarded can learn to take certain kinds of household responsibilities, some of which may be more complex than they are usually given credit for.
[00:09:55.379 --> 00:10:00.740]  It would be wrong to expect a mentally retarded person to become a master craftsman.
[00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:03.039]  The standards are too high.
[00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:11.559]  But even in the skilled trades, for example, The mentally retarded can be trained to become valuable assistants.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.100]  Who are the mentally retarded?
[00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.519]  They are people.
[00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:21.539]  They come in both sexes and in all sizes, shapes, creeds and colors.
[00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:25.759]  Wherever people live, there also live the mentally retarded.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:11:04.019]  Now, I've got one more piece of video I want to play that just came out a few hours ago where a very interesting man makes a really central point about Kamala Harris and the Brett Baer interview yesterday, and it's that he's never seen somebody talk over somebody and try to dominate things with her ignorant arrogance so much who had nothing to say.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.840]  Here's the clip.
[00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:11.250]  Did y'all see the Kamala video yesterday, the interview with Brett Dale?
[00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:13.169]  This is my question.
[00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.169]  This is my question.
[00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.009]  How can somebody...
[00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.070]  This is a riddle.
[00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:18.509]  This is a riddle.
[00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:27.470]  How can somebody never shut the fuck up and still never say nothing at the same time?
[00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.970]  That's what I took from that interview.
[00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:33.750]  She would not shut the fuck up, but she ain't say nothing.
[00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:36.360]  Somebody answer that for me out there.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:47.580]  Now, I want to hit some more important overarching strategy news about where the globalists are, what they're doing, why they're so panicked, and how we need to counter them right now.
[00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:51.100]  And remember, I've got a pretty good track record of predicting what the globalists are going to do.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.460]  But I don't want to just predict what they're going to do.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.600]  I want to expose their plans and stop it.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:11.370]  And we've been able to do that just in the last year or so because we've gained such a large audience, despite all the censorship, And because we have so much credibility, and most importantly, wonderful people like you are boosting our reports and our content and really are the MVPs of this fight.
[00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:28.690]  I saw this video today that made my mind explode with so many different angles, and it's posted on X if you want to see it and share it, you know, separate from this emergency news transmission we're doing here at the Alex Jones Network here on X. There are two types of dogs.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.779]  Now, of course, we know technically there are many different breeds of dogs, many different types of dogs.
[00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:38.240]  We've got the toy dogs and we've got the hunting dogs and we've got the retrieving dogs and we've got the...
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.700]  Herding dogs.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.100]  But there really are two different distinct types of dogs.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.899]  There are the domesticated dogs and there are the undomesticated dogs.
[00:12:50.039 --> 00:13:10.009]  And even within some of the so-called domesticated breeds, like the German Shepherd or the Alsatian, similar to it, it's really just a standard wolf that has been bred, not to lose the wolf-like agility, skill, cunning, but that has been Bred to be friendly to humans and to follow orders.
[00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:15.210]  And no dog exemplifies this like the German Shepherd.
[00:13:15.409 --> 00:13:18.610]  You can also talk about collies when it comes to the highest intelligence.
[00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:19.549]  They're just incredible.
[00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.570]  But in this video, you see a German Shepherd just doing spectacular things.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:38.419]  We're good to go.
[00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:45.690]  But other than a companion, it's totally worthless when it comes to any type of job.
[00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:58.629]  The truth is, dachshunds are badger hounds, and they're totally vicious when they're dealing with another animal, if they get attacked, and they are sent down holes to grab badgers by the nose, and then with their little tough legs, drag them out.
[00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:08.370]  I worked for a veterinarian for several years, a small animal vet, also a large animal vet later, and let me tell you, when they bring in a dachshund to sedate them, to spade or neuter them, or do a surgery...
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:23.500]  We're good to go.
[00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.549]  But still, you get my point.
[00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:45.330]  We've all seen that meme, maybe we can find it and pull it up, where it shows wolves 10,000 years ago, since 10,000 years ago, and the wolves are looking at cavemen around a fire cooking a deer.
[00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.110]  And they say, what could be the harm of, you know, going down there and getting some scraps?
[00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:55.990]  10,000 years later, it shows a pug wearing birthday, you know, suits or bunny rabbit ears.
[00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:56.909]  There's a bunch of those memes.
[00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.950]  Now, you look at that, what's happened to humans?
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:19.120]  We're good to go.
[00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:27.039]  Now, you could say we've mentally, our brains have gotten bigger, but in the last 500 years of industrialization, actually, that's not happening.
[00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:28.259]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.639]  We're getting weaker.
[00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:31.320]  We're getting lazier.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.179]  We're getting stupider because we're not out there actually carrying out tasks that aren't just...
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.019]  Physical, the physical's also tied to the mental.
[00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:49.779]  And I'm not up here saying I'm some paragon of being a physical Adonis or some specimen, because it's not just physical degeneration we've seen, it is...
[00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:01.029]  We're good to go.
[00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:12.409]  That they openly talk about now, have said, we don't even need people anymore.
[00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:15.129]  We're not just going to let them play video games and get drunk and high.
[00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:22.110]  We're going to depopulate them with slow-kill poisons in the food and water, like atrazine and others, to just get them out of the way.
[00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:35.350]  And people are so domesticated, even though these documents come out, the WEF says the future's not human, and they admit they're engaged in this process and have New York Times headlines about the end of humans and natalism's bad, loving children and families and caring about culture.
[00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:41.799]  That we've become so domesticated that we are now a worthless animal to the globalists.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.039]  We should stop acting like a worthless animal.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.759]  We should stop acting like an idiot.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:58.799]  We should stop giving over our destiny and we should rediscover our life force and our will and our drive to not just survive but to thrive and innovate.
[00:16:59.549 --> 00:17:02.429]  So we need to challenge ourselves, myself included.
[00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:04.170]  When I'm lecturing you, I'm really lecturing myself.
[00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:08.170]  So much of this broadcast is just kind of my inner dialogue with me chattering away.
[00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:14.369]  But you like the show because you've done your own research and you resonate with what I'm saying and you want to learn more.
[00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.230]  I want to learn more from you.
[00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:16.829]  This is a symbiotic relationship.
[00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.329]  So we all know this is true.
[00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:20.569]  So we don't want to be wild wolves.
[00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:32.329]  We also don't want to be mindless domesticated pugs or French bulldogs, and we certainly don't want to be sheep fed on by the globalists like the H.G. Wells allegory of the Morlocks and the Eloi.
[00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.690]  So here's the amazing clip I was just mentioning.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:08.259]  One of the biggest ways we've been domesticated is that we've been given filters of information we can get.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.940]  Remember, when someone else is being censored, they're not just being silenced.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.819]  You're being censored in what you are allowed to listen to and see or read.
[00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:20.059]  You're being treated like a slave.
[00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:32.220]  So much of domestication is about taking an animal Training it, breeding it to be servile and submit, and putting it in an artificial environment where it is dependent on those that are farming it.
[00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:43.160]  So, so much of not being domesticated is knowing how to fix a car, knowing how to roof a house, knowing how to grow a garden, knowing how to do basic medical procedures, knowing how to metal urgy.
[00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:45.500]  Knowing how to gunsmith.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.619]  Knowing how to midwife.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.059]  And you don't have to have everybody have every skill.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.380]  We can create communities again, which people are doing all over the world.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:19:10.680]  There's a real instinctive push back to this basic survival where one guy in your little hamlet or woman are great at mechanic work or great at electrical or great at farming or great at fertilizer or great at medical or great at teaching or great writers or...
[00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.579]  Great musicians.
[00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:16.559]  Everybody has these different talents, different gifts that we bring together.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.000]  But under the globalist system, they attack our gifts.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:29.559]  They divide and conquer us, not based on the meritocracy of what we individually bring, regardless of what color we are, but based on what color you are.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.720]  And that's why FEMA said, oh, in that clip a few weeks ago, so incredible, we ought to play it again.
[00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:35.940]  In fact, we'll find it and play it.
[00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:40.390]  Well, we used to be egalitarian and try to help everybody and be fair.
[00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.549]  Now we all want to take care of the LGBTQP, Satan.
[00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:46.230]  P for pedophile, S for Satan.
[00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:51.329]  And it's such average, you know, standard...
[00:19:54.249 --> 00:19:55.390]  Fair for the left.
[00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.230]  When I say average, that's not the right word.
[00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:05.049]  It's just so commonplace now that they make these outrageous totalitarian cultic statements.
[00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:06.849]  Oh, we're not fair anymore.
[00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:08.970]  We only want to help the black people.
[00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:10.650]  Of course, they're not going to help anybody.
[00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:24.619]  It sparked a few things in my mind thinking about preparedness and how you said, you know, LGBTQIA people and people who have been disadvantaged already are struggling.
[00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:28.160]  They already have their own things to deal with.
[00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:34.819]  So you add a disaster on top of that, it's just compounding on itself.
[00:20:35.779 --> 00:20:43.420]  And I think that is maybe the why of why we're having these discussions is because it isn't being talked about.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.039]  It isn't being socialized.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.900]  We're not paying attention to this community.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.940]  Thank you so much.
[00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:50.539]  Maggie.
[00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.910]  Thank you.
[00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.809]  There are a couple of things that are intersecting in my mind here.
[00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:03.630]  One of them is the culture of emergency management as an organization, as an industry in the United States specifically, not abroad.
[00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:11.009]  This has, and my cat sometimes does this, she gets really loud suddenly, so you'll have to just allow for the little meowing in the background.
[00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:24.829]  The shift that we're seeing right now is a shift in emergency management from utilitarian principles where everything is designed for the greatest good for the greatest amount of people to disaster equity.
[00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.950]  But we have to do more, right?
[00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:48.250]  And so this topic is intersecting, I think, with a number of other topics where we have to look at policies And understand to what extent they have disadvantaged communities that had less assets, communities that had pre-existing vulnerabilities in accessing disaster-related recovery supports.
[00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:50.960]  I think?
[00:22:11.219 --> 00:22:13.180]  Formulas of domestication.
[00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:19.880]  Again, a microcosm, the first level of domestication, is feeding an animal, is baiting it.
[00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:26.529]  So when you put a worm, you go and buy worms for five bucks at the gas station, Or the sporting goods store.
[00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:28.970]  And you go and you put your line in the water.
[00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.569]  And you've got that worm that probably costs you 30, 40 cents.
[00:22:32.869 --> 00:22:39.710]  You're not giving the fish a worm because you want to make it fat and happy and have a long life.
[00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.750]  You are putting it on a hook that it can't see to hook it to then catch it and then eat it.
[00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:52.609]  Because your small 30 cent investment is going to give you four or five dollars of meat that it would cost the store.
[00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:55.569]  That's the first level of domestication.
[00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:02.549]  That's how it first started, where our ancestors would bait animals to bring them in so they could be killed.
[00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.410]  Then they'd say, hey, let's keep these goats around.
[00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.769]  We can milk them and get milk and then also eat them When we need to.
[00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.329]  Or let them have babies and then eat the parents.
[00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.150]  So again, you can say, well, that's what we do to animals.
[00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:16.470]  The globalists are farming us.
[00:23:16.589 --> 00:23:24.930]  And once you see it and understand their operations and how they see you, you are opting in to being a farm animal.
[00:23:25.569 --> 00:23:27.369]  And now they're saying there's too many of us.
[00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.910]  Not only is life cheap, they're saying it's a negative thing like garbage.
[00:23:32.329 --> 00:23:33.730]  That needs to be taken out.
[00:23:34.309 --> 00:23:37.170]  All right, finally, I just want to say this to the viewers and listeners.
[00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.130]  Some nights I'm going to come in here and I'll do three hours and we'll have special guests and more.
[00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:52.170]  Other days, you'll just see a 30-minute report, maybe a 10-minute report, but I pledge to you at least five days a week here on the Alex Jones Network, here in just the next few weeks, you will see us here.
[00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:54.519]  And that's obvious.
[00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:56.880]  It's because they're trying to shut down Infowars.
[00:23:57.039 --> 00:24:00.519]  We're only 20, now 25 days out from potentially being shut down.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.660]  Very good chance it will be.
[00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:03.680]  That's a whole other story of tyranny.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:21.640]  But if you simply support the sponsors that are backing the Alex Jones Network, alexjones.network, if you simply go to alexjones.live, that's a sub-page on the Alex Jones Network that has all the sponsors, the Gibson Go Legal Defense, the Vimeo, how you subscribe to X to be a subscriber and support.
[00:24:22.099 --> 00:24:24.900]  And we've got a lot going on, but I do intend to do more stuff for the subscribers.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.960]  We're very thankful to all of you.
[00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:28.680]  We're in a fight, and I don't want to be a slave.
[00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.349]  And if I'm not going to be a slave, it means I'm going to stand up for your rights so you're not a slave.
[00:24:33.569 --> 00:24:41.410]  This is a symbiotic relationship, and I really don't believe, I know, Infowars has been one of the biggest thorns on the side of the New World Order.
[00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:48.009]  We have broken 9 out of 10 of the major stories of our age that are now out in the open.
[00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:58.430]  And my research and my angle and my understanding of the New World Order from research and their own documents and activities is being adopted by the main resistance globally.
[00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:00.609]  Elon Musk sounds just like Alex Jones.
[00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.150]  So does Tucker Carlson.
[00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.950]  It's not because they're just listening to me, though they do.
[00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:08.849]  It's because now they've got the perspective of just how dire and just how diabolical the globalists are.
[00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.829]  And that takes a lot for the average man or woman who is not a psychotic or sociopath.
[00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:15.180]  Or sadist, to understand.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:21.839]  But once you think like a general and then get in the mind of the enemy and study their mind, you can then not just...
[00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:23.900]  Understand their next move.
[00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:28.619]  You can understand their next move better than them by getting into that war mode.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.140]  But they're not expecting you to think.
[00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:32.559]  They're counting on you being a low-information voter.
[00:25:32.579 --> 00:25:34.400]  They're counting on you being mindless.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.319]  They're counting on you not seeing Kamala say dozens of times, I'm going to ban fracking in her official policy platform.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.059]  And then say to Trump, you're crazy.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.859]  I don't want to ban fracking.
[00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.559]  Or her saying days before the debate, I'm going to ban all semi-autos.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.859]  And she tells Trump, you're crazy.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.720]  Me and Tim Walls love guns.
[00:25:50.609 --> 00:25:53.049]  Even though he doesn't even know which end of the shotgun to put those shells in.
[00:25:53.849 --> 00:25:56.869]  Or, you know, she says, I was the best border czar.
[00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:57.730]  I was the border czar.
[00:25:57.809 --> 00:25:58.970]  Now I was the best border czar.
[00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:00.069]  I built the wall.
[00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.569]  That's an insult to you.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.700]  That she thinks you're that stupid.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:14.900]  All she has is her arrogant con artist bravada that is a mile wide, an inch deep, or as we say here in Texas, all hat and no cattle.
[00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:20.460]  And she's emblematic of the rotting, vapid hubris of this system.
[00:26:20.619 --> 00:26:25.039]  And I'm not a victim of this, though they've tried to make me their victim.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.799]  I'm an overcomer because I don't give up and I believe in you.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:36.799]  But I'll tell you, the only thing missing in the equation, and it's not missing, but we need more of it, it can be a lot stronger, is your support.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:44.960]  Word of mouth, prayer, and going to thealexjonesstore.com and getting great supplements like the Superfood of Superfoods, and we have the best of it all.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.960]  Look at the reviews, period, for our CMOS, and look at ours, it's the best.
[00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:58.200]  The powder capsules, the gummies, the Patriot t-shirts, all of it is critical to us continuing on one way or another, thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:01.410]  So, we're not going to give up.
[00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:08.170]  But the fact that the EU says they're going to start taking over Elon Musk, other companies, if he doesn't censor free speech, that was announced today.
[00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.650]  They're copying what Brazil successfully did to X and to Elon Musk.
[00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:15.569]  Our answer is fully backing Musk, fully backing Trump.
[00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.670]  Yeah, they're imperfect.
[00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:18.700]  So am I, but so are you.
[00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:30.819]  And just understand, the evil, corrupt, openly out-of-control establishment that signed executive orders and put out Pentagon orders to prepare for martial law and killing Americans, because everybody's been covering that.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.960]  We first talked about it with Elijah Shaper, first broke it.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.099]  We first broke it on the big audience two weeks ago.
[00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:38.299]  Finally, it gets covered on Fox yesterday.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.500]  Trends to the top of X and everywhere else.
[00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.630]  And then you read the whole document.
[00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.450]  It's all about martial law and surveillance and control and rounding people up and civil unrest.
[00:27:49.109 --> 00:27:52.690]  It's not just military training and preparing and authorizing to kill Americans.
[00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.890]  It's training for martial law under Democrat orders.
[00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.089]  And then they're saying Trump's doing that with no evidence.
[00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.710]  Again, I know I've already talked about this three times in 30 minutes.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.259]  Or less.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.579]  I talked about it all day for four hours on the air with Roger Stone for one hour.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.720]  And he finally said, hey, I got your message.
[00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:14.079]  And I said, Roger, you're smart, but do you have my message?
[00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:24.740]  Because there's no response from Trump when on every channel, every hour, everywhere, Biden, Harris, all of them are saying Trump's going to use troops to kill American citizens.
[00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:25.559]  He said it two days ago.
[00:28:25.599 --> 00:28:26.539]  I played the clip two days ago.
[00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:27.759]  Look it up.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.519]  He's typing Kamala Harris says...
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:47.779]  Trump to use the military on the citizens with no context, no evidence, no nothing, while we have the smoking gun of them gearing up for it, which means they're going to create the crises or crisis to do it and then blame him for it and blame the American people.
[00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:59.200]  And the FBI says MAGA is going to terror attack during the election and then we catch the FBI and CIA Running operatives that are planning to attack during the election who turn out to be working for them.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.200]  So we're in the most dangerous critical juncture ever right now.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.160]  And they already tried to shut me down 14 weeks ago without a court order.
[00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:08.099]  We stood up to it.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:08.920]  You stood up with us.
[00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:12.039]  And then now they're trying to take it over and shut me down.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.900]  And then they want me even off X after that because they do not want me on air.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:23.980]  They do not want you speaking out during the time that he's president-elect for those 76 days from November 5th to January 20th.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:35.660]  And that's going to be even crazier in the Democrats' own words like Raskin, Jamie Raskin, one of their main operatives, one of their main generals, of civil war conditions.
[00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:37.900]  And they're not going to certify Trump, they've said.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.720]  Pelosi said it.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.500]  So this is just, and it'll be the vice president who refuses to do it.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:51.259]  Kamala, over her own election, kind of like you saw in Arizona, where the lady running for governor against Carrie Lake certified her own election.
[00:29:51.839 --> 00:29:53.880]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:54.920]  This is dangerous.
[00:29:56.129 --> 00:29:56.569]  Crazy.
[00:29:56.829 --> 00:30:01.190]  And the good news is they've been forced to go operational and take the mask off, so it's all on the open.
[00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:07.650]  But we have to recognize the signs, the red flags, the alarm bells that are going off in front of our faces.
[00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:12.190]  So that's it for this emergency news update tonight.
[00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:14.230]  Kamala is in free fall.
[00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:19.650]  The deep state is in total panic and is openly preparing civil unrest martial law.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.640]  And America never having a real election again.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.200]  I don't see them winning.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.880]  I don't see them getting away with it.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:45.079]  If we're aware and if we've gotten out ahead of this, but instead there's no response from Republicans or Trump, do they wonder why Kamala runs around saying he's going to kill us all and use the military and civil war martial law while they then say in their own white papers they're going to have martial law and civil unrest to block Trump?
[00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:48.319]  I mean, they're telling you what they're going to do.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.940]  And I've always been, I think, the best with a big audience.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.140]  I don't like being number one because it's a dangerous position.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.000]  Number one when it comes to nailing it.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.420]  To just say what has to be said and cut right through all the chatter.
[00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.440]  We got a hundred times more talk and it's interesting.
[00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:04.200]  I did talk about it.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.740]  I'm not blaming people.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.680]  About Brett Baer and Kamala being a moron.
[00:31:06.859 --> 00:31:07.859]  We already know that.
[00:31:09.579 --> 00:31:12.099]  The issue is they're planning some nasty crap.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.319]  So please keep me on the air one way or the other.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.720]  Please share this report.
[00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.109]  Do your own reports.
[00:31:19.309 --> 00:31:22.789]  The answer, I see all these new citizen journalists popping up everywhere, beautiful all over the world.
[00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:25.670]  Australia, Europe, Africa, Latin America.
[00:31:25.849 --> 00:31:26.349]  It's amazing.
[00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:43.200]  We're good to go.
[00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.799]  Then what's going to happen if you stand up to them?
[00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:56.660]  The only path forward is to stand up.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720]  That's the safest path.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.619]  I don't do this out of courage.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.779]  I do it out of self-preservation and to be an honorable person.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.140]  And because my instincts make me want to fight these people because I hate tyrants and control freaks.
[00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:08.240]  All right.
[00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:08.839]  God bless you.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.759]  Great job with the crew.
[00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:14.859]  Please help keep the crew working no matter what happens to Infowars.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.240]  And you do that at...
[00:32:18.189 --> 00:32:19.069]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.029]  You make legal donations that we really need with all these fights we've got going on.
[00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:24.029]  You'll decide whether we win or not.
[00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.069]  And we win by just continuing to fight.
[00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.190]  And that's at realalexjones.com.
[00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:31.230]  You can find all the places at alexjones.live.
[00:32:31.609 --> 00:32:34.089]  All right, that's it for this emergency news alert.
[00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:41.609]  Now the ball's in your court to research what I've said, to find out it's all true, much worse than I said, quite frankly, and then to share the information.
[00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.930]  God bless and good luck, my Paul Revers.
[00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.549]  History is happening now.
[00:32:46.809 --> 00:32:51.730]  We are just weeks away from the most important election, not just in our lifetimes, but in history.
[00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:58.109]  And the EU is now trying to take over X and Elon Musk's other companies for, quote, allowing free speech.
[00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:07.329]  The Democratic Party has filed in federal court to take my name and real Alex Jones on X. Infowars could be shut down as early as November 13th.
[00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.430]  But regardless, I am going to continue fighting on.
[00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:11.250]  I'll never surrender.
[00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:23.190]  If I'm homeless on the side of the road, I'll be preaching about the New World Order and exposing the whole globalist agenda and trying to stop World War III and the pedophile rings and everything that we've been exposing for so long.
[00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:26.910]  And now the Pentagon comes out under orders from whoever's in control of the White House.
[00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.250]  There's been a coup, as you know.
[00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.849]  And says, yeah, we're preparing for martial law and for killing Americans.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.519]  Then they blame Trump and say he's planning that.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.839]  Everything I've talked about, unfortunately, has now come true.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.839]  Because the globalists made good on their promises decades ago to bring in this tyranny.
[00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:47.450]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction to no tuning.
[00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:50.349]  In physics, there's a giant awakening happening.
[00:33:50.589 --> 00:33:51.509]  Everybody sees it.
[00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.410]  Populars are getting elected around the world.
[00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:55.750]  The tyrants are in trouble.
[00:33:55.869 --> 00:33:57.650]  They know the initiative has turned against them.
[00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:03.069]  So, it's critical online to engage in free speech and to support InfoWars.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.700]  But it's also critical in the third dimension on the street to exercise your free speech.
[00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:21.760]  So our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, no matter what happens to Infowars, is going to ensure that I stay on air and that if we get enough funds, the crew continues on, the other shows, our investigators, the special reports, everything that reached tens of millions of people a day.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.920]  So I'm going to do my job.
[00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:31.130]  I'm humbly asking you to do yours, keep spreading the word, pray for the operation, and Support us by going to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:36.829]  There are so many new great t-shirts made by one of the top patron designers out there bigly at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.909]  This one, Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.
[00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.969]  It's got the new backup site that's being built out, realalexjones.com, and so much more.
[00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.010]  Let me show you some of the other new shirts that just came in.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:54.679]  Now the FDA came out a month ago and said fluoride does lower your IQ and does cause cancer and doesn't help your teeth.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.960]  So we brought back the classic, there's poison in the tap water.
[00:34:58.139 --> 00:34:59.760]  Now the public's ready to be awakened.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.099]  It's being removed all over the country.
[00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:04.440]  Get the shirt, theallocshowstore.com, and save some lives.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.860]  We've got this limited edition election bad boy.
[00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:11.239]  I'm with the outlaw and the hillbilly at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.519]  Limited edition fentanyl the dragon.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.900]  Here are stupid Americans.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:20.539]  If you want to meet like-minded people and trigger tyrants, the I Love Alex Jones shirt will surely do it.
[00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.730]  Many of these designs come from fan requests, like this one, The Alex Jones Was Right Jar.
[00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:29.610]  I've just shown you a few of the amazing designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:36.449]  We're adding new ones all the time, so check out the great designs, keep the broadcast on the air, and promote freedom in America and worldwide.
