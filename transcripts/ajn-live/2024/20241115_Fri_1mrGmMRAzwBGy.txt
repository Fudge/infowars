[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]  But we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.400]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:19.760]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.500]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.879]  You need to go to the AlexJonesStore.com Beautiful black shirt with an American eagle and gold, says Trump won.

[00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:36.880]  White with Trump won.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.679]  Today is your Independence Day, 127.
[00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.530]  25.

[00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.670]  When we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.750]  That's great.
[00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.689]  So many new hats.
[00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.149]  All of it made right there in Arkansas.

[00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.329]  It's already being made right now.

[00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.109]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.950]  Not our sponsor.
[00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.909]  They're ready right now.

[00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.539]  the front lines of the information ward, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.259]  We're good to go.
[00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.990]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.930]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intermission.
[00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.669]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.909]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.569]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.569]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.270]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.569]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order.
[00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.120]  They declare war on us and we accept the challenge!
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.879]  We're taking the country back!
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.039]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.199]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.919]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.819]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, they've got another thing coming.
[00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:02.280]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.680]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:25.180]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.740]  That's what matters.
[00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:38.949]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.550]  That is punishment.
[00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.810]  That is deterrence.
[00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.689]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.189]  And there's going to be a day when that child doesn't come home from school.
[00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.170]  And we know it and it's sad, and that's the reality.
[00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.290]  And the question's going to be, where is Alice Jones when that happens?
[00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.610]  Is he in his studio?
[00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.009]  Getting ready to bounce?
[00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.850]  Or will you stop him?
[00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.889]  That's going to be in your hands.
[00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.079]  And when we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back Because that's what justice is in this case.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.040]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.680]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:55.459]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.759]  I believe it.
[00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.519]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.399]  Yeah, there's going to be a resolution made under what these claims are valued at.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.480]  And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.500]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards...
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.540]  Is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.339]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:28.680]  Jones.
[00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.120]  Because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.920]  And if, you know, some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the can...
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:56.319]  The one thing I want you to do, if I could ask you to do anything for America and Alex and this network and this crew, the one thing I would ask you to do, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club.
[00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:00.430]  It's $30 a month, but you get $40 in store credit.
[00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:07.209]  So if you're going to buy a $35 shirt, you might as well sign up for the VIP club so that you can get that extra $10 and just get the shirt that you want.
[00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:13.009]  That is going to ensure that we can fund this operation, fund the next operation, ensure that Alex always has a voice.
[00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.490]  They can try to steal his identity.
[00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.850]  They can try to steal his business.
[00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:17.410]  They can try to steal America.
[00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.730]  They can try to sacrifice humanity in nuclear genocide.
[00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:31.980]  But if you go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club, they'll never take away our voice, they'll never take away our freedom, they'll never take away free speech, and we can save America together.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.620]  Please, go now and be the reason Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:48.300]  The Alex Jones Network.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.360]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.319]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:33.840]  We're good to go.
[00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.850]  We're good to go.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.080]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:49.460]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.620]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:23.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, November 15th, 2024.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.220]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:36.500]  And right before I went live, I received some incredible information.
[00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.590]  And this information is a lot bigger than me.
[00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.389]  It's a lot bigger than you.
[00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.350]  It's about all of us.
[00:10:44.049 --> 00:10:55.669]  And it's just incredibly over-the-top incredible and amazing and devastating to the establishment.
[00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:03.129]  I'm coming to you from the backup studios at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:07.889]  It is 11.09 Central Standard Time.
[00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:20.779]  And literally as I was going live on air, that's why we had some confusion, I had to take some phone calls and confirm some things that have now transpired.
[00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:22.360]  We already knew a lot of it yesterday.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.179]  We learned a lot more once I got off air last night.
[00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.120]  And then this morning there has been a lot of activity.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:53.639]  And you can see the headlines on Real Alex Jones at X. You can see the headlines at the Alex Jones Network on X. But if I can just do an overhead shot, and I had wanted to show the headline that was in there from Bloomberg,
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.340]  and here it is for you.
[00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:58.659]  Angry Judge orders transparency.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.820]  Angry Judge questions transparency of Onion Bid for InfoWars.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.960]  Now, that's what I told you was going on yesterday.
[00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:17.340]  And people are like, really?
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.960]  And the judge said this was not a real auction.
[00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:25.299]  And he said the sale has not happened.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.960]  And the corporate media would not pick that up, even though we have the transcripts and my lawyers were at the hearing and Elon Musk lawyers were there.
[00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:45.350]  So now the documents have been turned over by the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department of what they actually did, and it's way worse than what is even in the news.
[00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:52.669]  And I just started learning this at 7.45 this morning, and I've been just going over all of this.
[00:12:52.830 --> 00:13:00.230]  And quite frankly, I am basically speechless right now.
[00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:12.370]  I've also basically been authorized that, yes, what I'm saying is completely accurate, on its face, on the record.
[00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:15.950]  And what is that?
[00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:25.230]  What was done is cut and dry, absolutely criminal in every aspect.
[00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:37.559]  And then, right before I went live on air, A few minutes before I got the news, and I got it from very good sources.
[00:13:38.179 --> 00:13:39.639]  I double-checked it.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.159]  And...
[00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:55.970]  Anytime you're in a new studio that you haven't been using, and it's a nice studio and works well, there's issues and new crews working together.
[00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.389]  Same old crew, but mixed in.
[00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:59.570]  And there's little issues.
[00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.529]  And I get really ready to launch before I go on air.
[00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:05.889]  And it's like a thought process starts going.
[00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:09.269]  And if there's one screw-up at the start, I can handle it.
[00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.210]  Two, three, four, five, it starts getting to me.
[00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.730]  And I'm not mad.
[00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.370]  I'm just not at a place to be able to do the show right now.
[00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:15.950]  And I'm just being honest with you as a listeners.
[00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.710]  I'm going to have to...
[00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.710]  Get my composure.
[00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.049]  And I'm going to have to relaunch the live show.
[00:14:23.289 --> 00:14:23.990]  We're here.
[00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:25.789]  We're on the radio stations, the TV stations.
[00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.149]  They're hijacking the building yesterday and cutting off the satellite feeds and all of that.
[00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:30.769]  We had backups.
[00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.309]  We got most of the stations to switch over.
[00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:34.029]  I apologize to the stations for that.
[00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.490]  This is historic what's happened.
[00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.090]  I've not announced what's happened yet, what has been discovered.
[00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:44.289]  And I was almost not going to cover it right away so I could think about it some.
[00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:50.490]  And then that must have been God telling me When everything that we did just wouldn't even go out over air.
[00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.049]  So I'm not meant to be on air right now.
[00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:53.750]  That's God.
[00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:57.149]  Actually, that's God telling me that I shouldn't do the show right now.
[00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.889]  And that's what's going to happen now.
[00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.250]  So we've got really important information and news while I'm reflecting.
[00:15:04.409 --> 00:15:04.970]  Might be five minutes.
[00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.450]  I might not come back on today.
[00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.809]  So that's just where we are.
[00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:21.200]  So I am trying my best here.
[00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:26.360]  And it's not that I'm even angry.
[00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:39.299]  It's that we have been living under corruption for so long, and then the public's finally waking up to it, that it's really a cathartic experience as the global awakening purges and explodes and goes into hyperdrive.
[00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:42.379]  And so that's incredibly positive news.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.639]  And I also don't want to make this broadcast with all the historical things happening be just about what's happening to InfoWars right now.
[00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:52.759]  But it needs to be talked about because it affects everybody.
[00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:53.500]  It's a big deal.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:10.460]  And it's just another signpost on where we're going as the corruption collapses, as they turn on each other, as the truth comes out, that we have a bureaucracy, corporate, governmental, in this country, medical,
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.960]  that...
[00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:29.639]  It has been doing whatever it wants to anybody at any time for decades and decades and decades, and it has gotten worse and worse and worse and more [...] intense.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.480]  So, that's what all of this goes to.
[00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:48.690]  Now, We have a lot of incredible news, very positive news on World War III front that's basically the biggest yet in years.
[00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:54.730]  Zelensky said he's ready to end the war, which we knew as soon as he got a U.S. president not telling him to continue the war, he'd stop.
[00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.090]  That's massive.
[00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:58.470]  That's pop out the champagne right there if this goes through.
[00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.669]  Because we're so close to nuclear wars, all the top analysts agree.
[00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:04.390]  We've then got all these great appointments.
[00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.609]  Most of them are really good.
[00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:11.329]  Trump's sitting on all cylinders, but both publicly and behind the scenes, he's really going after the globalists.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.220]  And we also have RFK Jr.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:28.700]  and Health and Human Services and Moderna and Pfizer and all the big poison mRNA shot companies, stocks plunging.
[00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:31.539]  So that shows you how real all of this change is.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.039]  So...
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.319]  Really want to thank everybody that has stood with us over the years, all that we've gone through.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.680]  And there is more intense issues that we have to face in the future, obviously.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.539]  But we have turned the tide.
[00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:23.740]  So yesterday, I learned they're closing the building without a court order.
[00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:35.950]  And that the U.S. trustee had exceeded his authorization by the judge by a million miles, which the judge said yesterday in the emergency hearing after I already made those points on air because I could see what's going on.
[00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.970]  And basically everything I said on air was totally accurate, other than it was worse than I was saying.
[00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.869]  And there we are with them ordering the crew to just turn off the studio.
[00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.349]  I'm live on air with Steve Bannon.
[00:18:51.329 --> 00:18:53.549]  So I'm going to air a little bit of that.
[00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.869]  Just for the historical nature of it, and then we learned a lot more.
[00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.750]  It was worse than we thought.
[00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:04.730]  And then I'm going to come back at the bottom of the hour, and we'll see if we can do the show.
[00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.410]  And then I have some big, I mean, these are huge announcements.
[00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.349]  I mean, this is going to blow you away.
[00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:34.970]  You want to take the feed at Real Alex Jones and the feed at Alex Jones Network that is AJNLive on X. You want to follow that.
[00:19:35.069 --> 00:19:42.869]  You want to share the live feed right now and the Infowars feed from X. And if you're listening on a local radio station, you want to tell people around you to tune in.
[00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:43.369]  It's important.
[00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:49.190]  And if you're listening other places, you know, just share it.
[00:19:49.309 --> 00:19:51.890]  That's how we create the chain reaction.
[00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:54.519]  But there's the headline breaking now.
[00:19:54.619 --> 00:19:59.480]  Sale of info was blocked by a federal judge after hijacking and closure of the news organization's headquarters yesterday.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.339]  Alex Jones is live right now breaking massive news.
[00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:04.500]  That's the Alex Jones Network headline.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.819]  That's the folks that have just tuned in on those streams now.
[00:20:07.819 --> 00:20:09.180]  It'll be millions in just a few hours.
[00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:10.559]  Tens of millions by this evening.
[00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:13.140]  And then let's go to the real Alex Jones headline.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.779]  I want to read that one to you as well.
[00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:27.500]  And Again, the Bloomberg headline people think is shocking.
[00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:30.460]  Because I said this while the hearing was going on yesterday.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.339]  Angry judge questions transparency of Onion bed for Infowars.
[00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:38.500]  No, he said the auction wasn't real and didn't happen.
[00:20:39.579 --> 00:20:44.700]  Judge halts the Onion's Infowars takeover to review bankruptcy auction process.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.470]  Now, You have to understand, that's not even the big news.
[00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.250]  That would normally be the big news.
[00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.410]  The Onion didn't buy Infowars Wednesday.
[00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.029]  They didn't have an auction.
[00:21:01.369 --> 00:21:02.690]  They didn't pay money.
[00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.769]  They were given it.
[00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.630]  It was a sham on its face, prima facie.
[00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.569]  But that's not even the big news.
[00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:23.440]  So, that's what evil does, is it pushes, and it pushes, and it pushes, and it gets away with stuff forever.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.220]  And then when people wake up and start opposing it, it still thinks it can get away with it.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.019]  And it's not.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.000]  So, there's really three big stories I'm about to break that affect everybody.
[00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:42.359]  And the first one is, Trump's taking the gloves off.
[00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:44.299]  Elon Musk has taken the gloves off.
[00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:57.559]  And the other two are about what has been discovered and what has happened and what has already been done about 25 minutes ago.
[00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:07.279]  Now, I told the bad guys yesterday, and I put up videos last night before this was 100% confirmed.
[00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:14.539]  I mean, the corruption, that there wasn't an auction, that it was bid collusion, felonies, all that just opened and shut, done.
[00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.230]  Red-handed.
[00:22:17.589 --> 00:22:19.029]  Rats leaving a sticky ship, turning on each other.
[00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:20.069]  That happened today.
[00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:23.170]  Oh, yeah.
[00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.970]  Oh, yeah.
[00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.849]  We got it all.
[00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.589]  So, that's there.
[00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.609]  And I told the bad guys, I said, you're going to look like fools.
[00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:46.029]  When I shot these reports last night, you know, close to midnight, I said, you just wait.
[00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.109]  You just wait.
[00:22:50.589 --> 00:22:53.130]  Well, turns out we didn't have to wait too long.
[00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.170]  So here's part of this.
[00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:58.849]  Steve Bannon with me co-hosting.
[00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.210]  This is all going on yesterday morning.
[00:23:00.369 --> 00:23:03.390]  And then I'm going to come back, restart, relaunch, and do the broadcast.
[00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.890]  Here it is.
[00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:11.049]  Thursday, 14 November, year of early, 2024.
[00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:15.029]  We're going to start with a big presentation about Matt Gaetz and others.
[00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:17.930]  But breaking news, yesterday, a historical day.
[00:23:18.069 --> 00:23:19.589]  Today, a historical day.
[00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:25.730]  It may be the last moments of Alex Jones' massive platform, Infowars.
[00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.130]  Let's go.
[00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.829]  Alex, do we have Alex Jones?
[00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:28.509]  Alex, are you there?
[00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.369]  All right.
[00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.930]  Brother, tell me what's happening, sir.
[00:23:35.689 --> 00:23:40.730]  Thank you, Steve, for getting fired up so quickly in emergency transmission on your end there at thewarroom.org.
[00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:43.710]  We are in the literal final minutes, probably.
[00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.410]  Let me tell you what happened.
[00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.049]  This is incredible.
[00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:53.750]  As you know, federal judge, the U.S. trustee in June tried to shut us down without- Can you all send us a solo shot of Bannon?
[00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.529]  Alex Jones owns them.
[00:23:56.509 --> 00:23:58.049]  There could be a liquidation.
[00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:06.940]  They brought in a new trustee, and they said it'll be a public auction on November 13th to the highest bidder.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:14.319]  And then the groups we were working with went and filed all the paperwork, put in deposits, proved their credit.
[00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:18.440]  And I said, watch, they're going to pull a fast one because that's all that ever happens in the deep state.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.660]  That's all that's happened in the law fair against me and you and everybody else in Trump.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.440]  Then Monday at 3, we get a call and emails from the U.S. trustee and says, now it's different.
[00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:31.200]  It's a secret auction, not an online auction with a big company.
[00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:32.920]  Over it.
[00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.049]  And it's now gonna be just envelopes.
[00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:37.109]  You have until 10 a.m.
[00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.829]  yesterday to put them in.
[00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:44.609]  The highest bidder gets it, but the U.S. trustee reserves the right to give it to somebody for a lower amount if he chooses.
[00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:46.750]  Well, I thought, well, that obviously, we know what's happening there.
[00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:49.670]  They don't want to be upbid by people that are ready to come in with big money.
[00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.009]  So we wouldn't be allowed to upbid.
[00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:53.569]  How is that an auction, Steve?
[00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.190]  And it's secret.
[00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.829]  And they said we can sell it to somebody for less.
[00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.970]  So I told the crew, that's it, Thursday morning.
[00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.369]  I said, I would imagine within one day we'll be shut down.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:13.480]  Because we've been told by the US trustee months ago, if bad guys got it, you can call them bad guys, but I call them that, that they had said we want it shut down immediately before there's even a court order, before money's even wired in.
[00:25:14.259 --> 00:25:22.039]  Now, if the good guys got it, my buyers, folks I was working with were told, in writing and on record, it would take a month for them if they bought it to get control.
[00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:24.200]  But if the other side got it, they were gonna get it instantly.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.019]  So that's this system.
[00:25:26.659 --> 00:25:32.960]  That's pissed off the American people and caused this giant political awakening and realignment, not just here, but globally, and the giant landslide of President Trump.
[00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:47.119]  And so, sure enough, I get a call at 737 this morning, or 727, and by my lawyers and people who just met with the US trustee in Austin down the road at a hotel conference room.
[00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:50.000]  And they said, we're coming to shut it down right now.
[00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:52.660]  It's gonna be off the air, no hard feelings.
[00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:55.160]  We wanna meet with Alex Jones at 830 in the morning.
[00:25:56.099 --> 00:25:57.799]  I was a mile away.
[00:25:58.539 --> 00:26:00.779]  Some of the crew slept here because they knew this was coming.
[00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:01.519]  I told them it was.
[00:26:01.839 --> 00:26:02.700]  I get here.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.359]  I go on the air at 8 a.m.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.539]  And I've been on the air for an hour.
[00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:09.180]  They are in the building.
[00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:23.519]  They told the office manager, and they're calling me right now, that they have ordered the IT providers to cut all the IT off, to shut InfoWars down, banned out video, and to pull the plug on everything right now.
[00:26:24.089 --> 00:26:26.470]  And I had the witnesses in there that just were told this.
[00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.470]  Buy them.
[00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:33.410]  I could get with a live camera right now and go show you the US trustee and the auctioneers and all the people here.
[00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:35.410]  And so this is historic.
[00:26:35.569 --> 00:26:36.789]  They did not buy it.
[00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.589]  The judge has not certified it.
[00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.450]  They changed the last minute how the auction worked.
[00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.329]  This is ridiculous.
[00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.470]  And so we've set up the Alex Jones Network with great sponsors.
[00:26:47.929 --> 00:26:49.990]  As a backup, we have a mini-studio.
[00:26:50.089 --> 00:26:51.369]  The bigger studio is almost done.
[00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:53.490]  It's down the road from these offices.
[00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.650]  It's owned by other folks.
[00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:57.109]  They'll have big trouble shutting that down quick, though they'll try.
[00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:01.789]  They filed months ago in federal court to own the name of Alex Jones if they were able to buy it.
[00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.670]  They tried to get it that day with the judge.
[00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:07.750]  They actually filed in federal court, the US trustee with the Democratic Party.
[00:27:08.349 --> 00:27:14.150]  Law firms, they said, quote, the 13th Amendment against Indigenous servitude and slavery does not apply to Mr.
[00:27:14.309 --> 00:27:14.549]  Jones.
[00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:17.440]  It applies even more to public figures.
[00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:19.319]  They said they own my likeness.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.960]  I did not sign a 360 record deal like Prince did with Sony where they did own his name.
[00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:26.259]  You can contract away your rights, but I never did.
[00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:29.579]  It's absolutely an affront, 100% ridiculous.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.220]  It's a giant power grab.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.779]  The judge shut that down and said, no, I'm not giving you his name and stuff.
[00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:38.579]  And real Alex Jones on X, that's his private account.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.259]  And the judge stopped that.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.359]  But they wanted that in the takeover.
[00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:43.789]  That just happened.
[00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.869]  They said, because their mission is to shut us down, to silence us.
[00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:56.109]  I have a short compilation if we have time, it's three minutes long of them saying that in Connecticut and Texas in the rigged court cases where I was found guilty by judges in default.
[00:27:56.269 --> 00:28:00.349]  And they had show trials literally scripted and run by HBO with scripts in the judge's hands.
[00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:12.849]  And I went there to expose it with show trials, didn't realize it was a complete show trial, the likes of which never been seen in the world to my knowledge, where it's actually an HBO production run by HBO. They have bitten off way more than they can chew.
[00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.910]  This is so incredibly historic.
[00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:17.990]  The Streisand effect is in maximum effect.
[00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.009]  And we are victorious.
[00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:25.690]  We have forced their hand to do this in an absolutely insane, ham-fisted maneuver.
[00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:32.569]  But yes, it's being confirmed now that they're going to cut the power.
[00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:35.809]  So that's where we are any minute.
[00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.710]  The power will be cut off.
[00:28:39.609 --> 00:28:43.089]  There's a few little surprises there, but I'm gonna just stop right there.
[00:28:45.939 --> 00:28:48.579]  Because we've been anticipating this because we're not naive.
[00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:50.000]  We know the enemy we're up against.
[00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:50.799]  We're not stupid.
[00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:52.119]  We're not gaslit.
[00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:56.000]  And it's not just Steve Bannon who's street smart and Alex Jones is street smart.
[00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:58.400]  It's now the American people that are street smart.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.880]  And we're in a historic moment.
[00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:01.940]  And so everybody can follow me at RealAlexJones.
[00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:05.819]  Everybody can follow me at the new Alex Jones Network at AJNLive.
[00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:07.769]  We have the satellites.
[00:29:07.769 --> 00:29:09.549]  They're pointed at the radio and TV stations.
[00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.890]  The contract is signed.
[00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:13.390]  We're waiting to flip the switch.
[00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:14.150]  That will happen.
[00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.470]  There may be a hiccup on the radio and TV stations today.
[00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.910]  But most of us, we have to tell them where the new feed is.
[00:29:19.289 --> 00:29:24.150]  But my affiliate relations man who's been here 22 years, John Harmon, is calling them right now.
[00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.410]  We didn't want to panic anybody or jump the gun.
[00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:29.910]  We wanted to just step off of our sinking ship.
[00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:36.670]  Like John Paul Jones, as he took the larger, with twice the troops, British ship.
[00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:39.690]  When his ship was sinking, they said, would you like to surrender?
[00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:41.410]  He said, I've not yet begun to fight.
[00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.849]  I've only begun to fight.
[00:29:43.049 --> 00:29:48.430]  And then they took the ship, tied their sinking ship to it, saved both ships, and took both ships, founder of the US Navy.
[00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.809]  And so we are literally sinking, tied up to the new boat.
[00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:54.059]  And we're taking both ships right now.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.720]  Steve Bannon, God bless you, my friend.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.359]  It's so great you answered.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.980]  I know you're very busy because I feel like kindred spirit with you because we've been in basically the same position.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.099]  And we're the only people that have been persecuted anywhere close to Trump.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.019]  So I wanted to get your gravitas at this moment.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.700]  We are still on air.
[00:30:08.819 --> 00:30:09.539]  They can pull a plug in a minute.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.099]  So I'm going to give you the floor right now.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:20.819]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, November 15th, 2024.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.579]  Massive news that affects all Americans.
[00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:29.019]  You're going to be blown away straight ahead after this quick break.
[00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:32.980]  Everybody on X, share the links from Real Alex Jones and at AJN Live.
[00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:34.140]  This is History.
[00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:36.240]  Share the links now, back in four minutes.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:54.119]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, Infowars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:03.579]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.940]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.579]  Who knows?
[00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:11.559]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:26.200]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.619]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:39.930]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexshonestore.com, We're good to go.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.000]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:05.359]  But that's going to get announced.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.559]  The winner here in just a few days.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.740]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.380]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:15.240]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.079]  So now...
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:24.420]  We're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the darkest hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.110]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:23.530]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.869]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:35:27.769 --> 00:35:33.110]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35:53.870 --> 00:36:06.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Friday, November 15th, 2024 edition of the Alex Jones Show and of InfoWars.
[00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.889]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:14.210]  Now, as you know, the top story in the country yesterday...
[00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:29.710]  It's not the big fight over Matt Gaetz as the Attorney General.
[00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:31.849]  Those were some of the top stories.
[00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:47.219]  The top story, rated everywhere, was the shutdown and takeover and sale of InfoWars and Alex Jones' media empire to the Democratic Party, That admittedly is involved,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:55.920]  and their front group, The Onion, and the leftist Kamala Harris booster owner, who said, we are taking over Alex Jones' identity.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.880]  We're going to have flying saucers and chupacabras and Bigfoots.
[00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.230]  And we are going to make him look like a fool.
[00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.949]  We now are in his skin.
[00:37:06.269 --> 00:37:16.030]  And they said in filings, we want him off the air, and we want to discredit the name Infowars, which they failed to do with all their lawfare and lies and PR firms and Justice Department activities.
[00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:32.280]  Now, we learned yesterday morning at 7.30 Central Time, roughly, 7-27, and we want to be technical,
[00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:48.360]  the email and the phone calls by the U.S. federal trustee that they had, quote, sold Infowars, the name, the studios, the equipment, to the, quote, Sandy Hook families, and that is the Democratic Party,
[00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:55.579]  the Justice Department that created the lawsuits, the PR firms that ran it all, and they were using as their front group the Onion.
[00:37:56.659 --> 00:38:02.420]  Whose express mission was to discredit me and make fun of us and maybe people think that I'm talking about flying saucers and Bigfoot.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.159]  They actually said that.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.579]  We want to destroy his identity.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.360]  So they want to silence you and then create a fake you.
[00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:08.739]  That's what I've told you for years of the plan.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.619]  They admit that.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.079]  I'm going to break massive news here in a moment for new viewers.
[00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:14.679]  I'm recapping.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.900]  This is complex and people get confused.
[00:38:18.289 --> 00:38:29.170]  By the way, everything I'm saying now is already breaking in the news except for three huge things I'm going to break that will be all over the news within an hour, maybe sooner.
[00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:43.780]  The last federal trustee in the bankruptcy in late May, on a Friday, All this private security showed up at the building.
[00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.079]  I said, what's going on?
[00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.099]  They said, we're told we're closing you and kicking everybody out of the building at 9 to 9.
[00:38:51.219 --> 00:38:53.099]  I said, do you have a court order?
[00:38:53.179 --> 00:38:53.739]  Do you have a warrant?
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.960]  I said, if that was happening, it would be the constables or Travis County.
[00:38:58.639 --> 00:38:59.980]  That's who they send in Austin, Texas.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.320]  They said, we know.
[00:39:01.519 --> 00:39:03.460]  I get on the phone with the owner of the security company.
[00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:06.119]  He says, I've got a lady who says she's from the Justice Department.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.460]  Here's her name.
[00:39:07.519 --> 00:39:08.420]  I said, yeah, I know her.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.199]  Melissa Hazleton and her lawyer.
[00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:17.510]  Saying that we don't need orders, shut them down, kick them out of the building.
[00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.530]  I said, you understand that's illegal and I'm going to call the police if you try it.
[00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:30.289]  I'm not going to physically confront your people, but you're going to get in a lot of trouble because that'll be a crime.
[00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:34.449]  And they said, no, we agree with you and we're not doing it.
[00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:51.980]  So the order of the private security company I'd had for seven, eight years, The security other places around Austin, nice folks who are not part of Infowars but are there in the building and have a car and, you know, wearing uniforms to have guns, to do that.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.780]  Then I announced they're here trying it.
[00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.300]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.179]  It does sound unbelievable.
[00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:02.599]  Then they had an emergency hearing a few days later and admitted they've done it.
[00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:05.059]  The judge said, I'm having a full hearing on this June 14th.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:12.059]  Two weeks later, he has the hearing, hears all this over six hours, fires the federal U.S. trustee that the Justice Department had appointed.
[00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:13.559]  They can bring them in, but the judge can fire them.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.019]  They're not on most bankruptcies.
[00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:15.699]  They were brought into mind.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:23.980]  He fires the U.S. trustee, fires the CRO, Pat McGill, and hands the company back to me.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:33.820]  But because I was in personal bankruptcy, the judge said, There needs to be a liquidation because your assets have to be liquidated.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.360]  That's the law.
[00:40:34.519 --> 00:40:35.199]  I said, I understand.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.699]  He said, I need future hearings on when the liquidation will be.
[00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:41.380]  They didn't do that.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:49.500]  They put in a filing, the new U.S. trustee, to sell the name Alex Jones, which you can't do under law, violence the 13th Amendment against slavery.
[00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:50.940]  That's on record.
[00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:52.780]  It's just in stone.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.840]  And that's what the, quote, families wanted.
[00:40:56.639 --> 00:40:57.579]  The Democratic Party.
[00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:05.440]  Then when the judge said no to that, they said, fine, we object to the sale.
[00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:06.400]  The judge said no.
[00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:08.159]  In another hearing, it goes forward.
[00:41:08.719 --> 00:41:17.860]  But I'd put in objections, wanting it in stone, because the U.S. trustee was still trying to say he owned my name and real Alex Jones on X that Elon Musk has now gotten involved in.
[00:41:18.019 --> 00:41:19.780]  It was in our court hearing yesterday, Elon Musk lawyers.
[00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:29.000]  I'll get into that for X. The judge says clearly in the last hearing a month ago, he said, we need to have future hearings.
[00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:30.360]  There's only somebody ironed out.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.980]  What's legal to sell?
[00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:32.579]  What's not?
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.780]  But he said, you can't sell his name.
[00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:35.880]  That's obvious.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.420]  They didn't stop.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.260]  They didn't have the hearings.
[00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:42.760]  They went ahead with the quote auction.
[00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:46.690]  And said, November 8th, all bids have to be in.
[00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:48.789]  You have to file, sign non-disclosures.
[00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.269]  Anybody that wants to bid has to put money down.
[00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:52.909]  They have to show their bank account.
[00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.070]  They have to have a credit check.
[00:41:55.449 --> 00:41:58.550]  And you sign, under penalty of perjury, federal documents.
[00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.429]  Because it's felonies when you lie on this stuff.
[00:42:02.909 --> 00:42:03.750]  Get to that in a moment.
[00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.610]  Then...
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:18.699]  On November 11th at about 2 p.m., emails go out from the U.S. Trustee Chris Murray to my lawyers and to the other prospective buyers and the good guys we're working with.
[00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:21.579]  All your bids don't matter.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.980]  None of those contracts matter.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.199]  All that auction's canceled.
[00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:29.320]  The auction will still be Wednesday, November 13th.
[00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:47.489]  You have until 10 a.m., two days from then, this is on the 11th, to put in one bid, and there will be one bid, Per person, per group, and we will open it at 1030, and we will decide there will be no future bids.
[00:42:48.329 --> 00:42:49.969]  You can't bid up like a real auction.
[00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:54.650]  Definition of an auction on Webster Dictionary, look it up, is a sale to the highest bidder.
[00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:56.309]  Okay?
[00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.590]  Look up, definition, auction, it's that.
[00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:00.269]  I'll show you in a moment.
[00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.889]  And the judge said that yesterday in a hearing, so this is on an auction, and the sale didn't go through.
[00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.269]  The press would not report those quotes, but they did say the judge halted it.
[00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:10.030]  I'll get to that in a moment, but I have the actual quotes.
[00:43:15.809 --> 00:43:22.130]  So, then we learned, and we finally got the documents last night, that not only...
[00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:38.389]  We then learned that not only was it on a real auction, but that...
[00:43:40.550 --> 00:44:00.750]  You had had the Democrat law firms, the so-called plaintiffs, and this Democrat Harris operative get together and come up with a scheme to not pay money that the judge's order said in the future the auction would be cash.
[00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:20.309]  In a federal order, they We're pledging his future earnings, which you can't do under law, to the purchase of this.
[00:44:23.769 --> 00:44:25.630]  So it wasn't a real auction.
[00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:31.929]  It was a private secret sale with a cover of an auction to try to fool the judge, clearly.
[00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:35.420]  That's what the judge was talking about yesterday.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.400]  Very upset.
[00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:39.539]  And the guy that does never get upset, very upset, but his face in his hands.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.239]  Saying, quote, an auction's where people can bid in public.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.099]  And then he said, what was the final bid by the winners?
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.940]  And the U.S. trustee said, I don't know.
[00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:55.010]  Well, he did know.
[00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.690]  We got the documents last night.
[00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.409]  So he told the judge he didn't know.
[00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.409]  So he said who the winner is.
[00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:08.969]  He didn't know because he didn't want to tell the judge they had pledged my future earnings for them to get the company.
[00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:20.170]  When the order says cash and under the law, once the agreements are signed, they had to tell other prospective bidders that it was no longer a cash option, but they could say credit.
[00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.329]  And it goes on from there.
[00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:23.550]  But the big news is about to break.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.400]  There was no auction.
[00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:28.699]  The Onion did not get it.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.119]  The judge said that yesterday.
[00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:33.340]  He wants an evidentiary hearing with all of it next week.
[00:45:33.619 --> 00:45:35.079]  He set the day tomorrow.
[00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:38.239]  I mean, today, for next week.
[00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:45.059]  And you have this giant hoax that InfoWars was sold, and then it was an auction.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.440]  And they said it was for cash.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.159]  It wasn't.
[00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:52.019]  And then the judge asked, well, what did they pay?
[00:45:52.159 --> 00:45:53.539]  And he says, I don't know.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.599]  Quote, I don't know.
[00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:08.489]  When under the rules, they had to give at the end of the auction to the other bidders what was there by the winner.
[00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:10.190]  They did last night.
[00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.250]  And it's signed by him.
[00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:30.420]  So he told a judge he didn't know in a federal court with Elon Musk lawyers and everybody else there in Houston yesterday at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon central That he didn't know.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:47.519]  So, on Monday, they end the regular public bid online auction, which is a real auction, change it and claim, oh, you still get the bid, just put in, but you can't bid up, but we can take a lower one if we want.
[00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:48.920]  I said, the fix is in.
[00:46:49.539 --> 00:46:50.840]  They're not even going to really even pay anything.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.119]  I said that these people are just, believe they're above the law.
[00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.329]  And then we, exactly what I said Monday when we learned this happened.
[00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:04.110]  And then Chris Murray's all over the news.
[00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.550]  Bloomberg AP being quoted by the media is talking to him.
[00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.849]  And he's saying, well, it wasn't about the most money.
[00:47:09.949 --> 00:47:11.349]  It was about the best thing to do for the families.
[00:47:11.469 --> 00:47:12.610]  This is what they wanted.
[00:47:12.809 --> 00:47:13.429]  These are quotes.
[00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.530]  And so we just gave it to them.
[00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:22.429]  Oh, but you acted like there was an auction so you could slip it by the public and the judge.
[00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:23.969]  And you just thought we'd take it.
[00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:25.309]  And you showed up.
[00:47:25.929 --> 00:47:28.190]  And cut the, cut the, cut the shows off.
[00:47:28.389 --> 00:47:31.889]  And I'm telling the guy, he's there yesterday to him, to his face.
[00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.210]  He left when I, he was there, then he left.
[00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:36.130]  Then I talked to him on the phone.
[00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:37.750]  I recorded it.
[00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:45.309]  And he said, I'm going to tell the judge you're violating the stay and violating court orders if you don't leave.
[00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:49.409]  And I said, the judge said, I was listening to the hearings.
[00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.389]  I wasn't there.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.199]  Watch the hearings.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.699]  And I said, I've talked to my lawyers.
[00:47:53.719 --> 00:47:55.960]  He said you had to have more hearings before an auction.
[00:47:56.059 --> 00:47:57.420]  He doesn't even know about this auction.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.239]  I said, you're in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.099]  And I said, you were supposed to have more hearings.
[00:48:04.219 --> 00:48:06.840]  He doesn't even know you did this, which we now know is confirmed.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:13.719]  And I said, and you're telling me to leave, and you're telling me to go, or you're going to tell the judge I'm violating his orders.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.039]  You've exceeded your authority.
[00:48:15.619 --> 00:48:26.880]  But I said, since you've already turned the website off, cut the servers off, And had gone around the building telling my employees they could get in big trouble if they didn't do it.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.199]  I'm not going to put them on the spot, but you're doing this for your color of law.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.579]  You're in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.460]  And I don't know why you thought you could do this, but I said, I'm going to drive down the road and do my show from there.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.199]  But I said, I'm going to go sign off here.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.400]  Are you going to make the claim that I violated federal law and all this stuff?
[00:48:48.519 --> 00:48:49.639]  And he goes, no, no, that's okay.
[00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:53.710]  I just wanted to get him saying it on tape.
[00:48:53.989 --> 00:49:10.449]  I go in, get on Harrison's show, sign off, and as I walk out the door, they order the last IT guy in the building to flip it off, to turn the servers,
[00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.369]  to turn the equipment off.
[00:49:16.329 --> 00:49:24.369]  Cutting our feeds on X. I get here, we get the show going, the rest is history.
[00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.789]  Then the hearing happens, goes on for a couple hours.
[00:49:29.949 --> 00:49:33.530]  My lawyers, other lawyers, Musk lawyers, they're all there.
[00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:37.889]  We need time to go over the transcripts, look at this to make sure what we saw actually happened.
[00:49:38.449 --> 00:49:42.369]  Then Murray gives the documents to the highest bidder, which he's supposed to do by law, finally.
[00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.110]  They actually get what he did.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.179]  Pledging my future earnings.
[00:49:48.699 --> 00:49:50.079]  Those cases are in appeals.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.619]  You can't pledge somebody's earnings if you've won the case.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.280]  The Supreme Court said Jones is, you know, liable.
[00:49:55.539 --> 00:49:56.099]  That hasn't happened.
[00:49:56.239 --> 00:49:58.000]  But you can't pledge that.
[00:49:58.539 --> 00:50:00.179]  In the 13th Amendment, a bunch of other laws.
[00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:09.980]  And we learn at 8 o'clock at night just how bad it was.
[00:50:11.519 --> 00:50:17.150]  Then I learn from individuals who High up.
[00:50:18.429 --> 00:50:24.530]  Multiple sources that there's major interest in this by President Trump and by Elon Musk.
[00:50:24.849 --> 00:50:40.389]  Then my lawyers start getting calls and other lawyers start getting calls from the media saying they hear this and that there is a criminal investigation of this already going on by the federal government in Houston.
[00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:44.750]  Then I get more calls this morning.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:59.400]  And the people involved have now reached out and said, we didn't know this was illegal.
[00:50:59.699 --> 00:51:01.079]  We were told to do this.
[00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:02.500]  We'll give you everything.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.320]  We don't want to go to prison.
[00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:17.400]  Then I get the call.
[00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.489]  That the judge could do an emergency hearing now today.
[00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.150]  And a lot more I'm not going to get into yet.
[00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.090]  And then three minutes before we go live.
[00:51:34.429 --> 00:51:35.750]  This has been going on for hours.
[00:51:35.929 --> 00:51:37.610]  I hadn't been told because people are busy.
[00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:44.050]  The U.S. trustee Chris Murray calls and says, look, I made a mistake.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.360]  We shouldn't have shut down InfoWars.
[00:51:50.619 --> 00:51:52.460]  We shouldn't have turned off the broadcast.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.960]  The judge said it didn't have the authority.
[00:51:57.079 --> 00:51:58.579]  You can go back to your studios.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.420]  We're putting InfoWars back up.
[00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:01.420]  Now let's put it on screen.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.940]  InfoWars.com is back up live.
[00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:07.099]  If that isn't proof, everybody, what I'm saying here, there it is.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.960]  They put it back up 50 minutes ago.
[00:52:13.059 --> 00:52:14.019]  Right as we went live.
[00:52:14.519 --> 00:52:16.820]  And they went in there and flipped back on the satellites.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.920]  I'm told the power is on.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.320]  They're like, come back, come back, come back.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.699]  I'm not a vengeful person.
[00:52:24.259 --> 00:52:34.420]  But the federal prosecutors, that's who runs the case, former federal prosecutors and Senator Blumenthal, up at those law firms in Connecticut, the biggest ambulance chasers on the East Coast.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.420]  The head of the law firm told me in a mediation, I'm like the mafia.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.219]  We're like the godfather.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.219]  You'll never win.
[00:52:41.219 --> 00:52:42.440]  We're going to destroy you.
[00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.960]  And I'm like, well, what do you want?
[00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:46.699]  Well, we want you to stop talking about the Second Amendment and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:52:47.369 --> 00:52:49.090]  And that was in a sealed deal with a federal judge.
[00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:49.949]  I couldn't talk about it.
[00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:52.230]  That was with a federal judge in a mediation.
[00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:56.489]  But later he said it publicly, and they said it publicly, and they said it in the mediation in Texas.
[00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:59.150]  And then they said it to my lawyers outside of mediation.
[00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.849]  And my lawyers said, no, it's no longer, they don't even care.
[00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:04.110]  They want you to stop doing what you're doing, this will all end.
[00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.210]  I mean, you get the idea of how bad this is.
[00:53:07.409 --> 00:53:15.309]  And the main federal, former federal prosecutor that runs all this was on national news last night saying, this is just the beginning of Alex Jones' lessons.
[00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:17.530]  See, they don't want money.
[00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:24.190]  They want the standing to harass me and attack me and claim I'm attacking them and use me for fundraising and to build their names up.
[00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:27.610]  And I've been in their jaws for seven years.
[00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:34.750]  So they all thought they could get with the U.S. trustee, like they obviously did, we were told, with the last one.
[00:53:34.949 --> 00:53:42.610]  I remember they said, well, the families are mad at you, and they want you closed now, and that's why you're closed.
[00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:46.610]  When they tried to close the doors of no court order in late May on that Friday.
[00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:54.670]  And then they were so arrogant about it, they were bragging, and I'm literally being told this by the lawyers on their side and their people.
[00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:55.789]  You messed up.
[00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:58.409]  You're bucking this whole process.
[00:53:58.929 --> 00:54:05.349]  You didn't mediate and give them money and promise to not talk about the Second Amendment.
[00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:06.269]  And I said, oh, and what else?
[00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:07.130]  Well, there's a big list.
[00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:08.329]  Are you open for that?
[00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:13.579]  That was in Fort Worth in a federal courthouse with an acting federal judge in that mediation.
[00:54:14.039 --> 00:54:15.000]  You can get those.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:17.139]  Went on for two days.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.699]  They had the FBI head counsel in the back that ran the whole thing.
[00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:27.559]  I got up with the judge and said, he runs it all, Your Honor.
[00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:28.280]  They don't want money.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.059]  I got clips.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.780]  I never said that guy's name.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.679]  They gave him a $130-something million judgment.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:33.579]  We never talked about it.
[00:54:33.579 --> 00:54:34.300]  We didn't know who he was.
[00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:38.130]  He made it on the stand in Connecticut two years ago.
[00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.929]  He ran the whole thing.
[00:54:39.269 --> 00:54:40.889]  Then the CIA got caught being involved.
[00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:44.929]  So I'm giving you all the details here.
[00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:52.030]  So I told you, the judge halted it and said there was no auction and that he did not authorize it.
[00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.070]  They were supposed to have more hearings.
[00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:54.949]  They tried to sneak this through.
[00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:59.750]  They acted like it was an auction when it was already an agreed-upon secret private sale.
[00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:04.349]  Murray is in the news going, well, I figured the families deserved to have this, so I gave it to them.
[00:55:05.239 --> 00:55:06.880]  So you acted like you had an auction.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.039]  You violated the judge's orders.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:12.019]  You went through with a fake auction when the judge didn't even know what was happening.
[00:55:12.139 --> 00:55:13.719]  He was like, what, there was an auction yesterday in the hearing?
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.440]  I mean, think about how crazy these people are.
[00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:17.780]  Because I'm the bad guy.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.539]  Just do whatever you want.
[00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:19.420]  No, I'm not the bad guy.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.639]  You may say, I mean, if I was somebody else that knew me well, I'd say, that's frickin' Mr.
[00:55:25.179 --> 00:55:25.699]  Captain America.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.059]  I mean, I'm a nice person.
[00:55:27.239 --> 00:55:28.340]  I'm also not a wimp.
[00:55:28.659 --> 00:55:29.840]  And I'm also pretty smart.
[00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.949]  So I know you globalists aren't used to straight shooters and stuff, but this is how my family is.
[00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:37.289]  And I'm going to tell you right now, we win in the end.
[00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.469]  I'm talking about going back to England 500 years ago, baby, running the show.
[00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.429]  So you guys are in a lot of trouble.
[00:55:49.909 --> 00:55:50.550]  A lot.
[00:55:52.289 --> 00:55:54.190]  So praise God.
[00:55:54.449 --> 00:55:55.949]  Thank everybody for supporting us so long.
[00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.989]  I don't know exactly how this is going to shake out.
[00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.449]  Criminal investigations going on.
[00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.429]  Rats leaving sinking ships.
[00:56:04.949 --> 00:56:06.469]  Caught right in the middle of this.
[00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.449]  And then they go, it's yours.
[00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:08.969]  Come back.
[00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.630]  You're right.
[00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:10.550]  It was wrong.
[00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:11.829]  Stop the presses.
[00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:20.010]  So I think we should send some crew back over there.
[00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:21.769]  I know we have limited crew here.
[00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:23.929]  We'll talk during a break.
[00:56:24.889 --> 00:56:26.690]  And get InfoWars fired up.
[00:56:26.769 --> 00:56:30.429]  I don't know, since we're already streaming on X and everywhere, if that'll mess the streams up.
[00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.889]  If we go back over to that studio, technicians decide.
[00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:34.969]  There's a lot of moving parts.
[00:56:35.409 --> 00:56:37.949]  We got satellite uplinks here, satellite uplinks there.
[00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:40.090]  So you guys decide if that'll work.
[00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:41.250]  If not, I'll just stay here today.
[00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:47.869]  But regardless, I'm going over there when my show's over at 3, and we're firing that son of a bitch up as a celebration of victory.
[00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:54.070]  I mean, I'm telling everybody yesterday that there was no auction.
[00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.030]  It's all fake.
[00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.070]  And people are like, Jones is crazy.
[00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:57.809]  There's no way.
[00:56:57.809 --> 00:56:59.650]  I'm like, I'm not lying to you.
[00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.289]  And I'm not going to say any more.
[00:57:04.429 --> 00:57:10.650]  But let's just say Trump and Elon Musk have already met about this.
[00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:18.809]  And I got chewed out, actually, yesterday morning.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.599]  Because they didn't understand exactly what was going on.
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:33.579]  And they, you know, nice folks were, say, behind the scenes, you know, some folks were like, what do you need?
[00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:43.239]  And I'd already told them, I said, this is all rigged, and I'm not going to, you know, I said, it should be better if you want to help launch this big network and stuff, which we're ready to do.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.460]  Let's just wait, and let's let this process play out.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.940]  I said, I've got a gut feeling they're going to bite out more than they can chew.
[00:57:51.019 --> 00:57:56.099]  And so the big dogs did not enter this.
[00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:03.719]  And I told the people that I'm loyal to, that I worked with for seven years, that were coming in to help us, that are great people.
[00:58:04.099 --> 00:58:05.300]  I told them, you're not getting it.
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:05.860]  It's all fake.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.860]  And I told them before they made the change Monday, and it made it a fraudulent, non-existent auction.
[00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:14.019]  Private sale masquerading is that.
[00:58:14.159 --> 00:58:16.900]  And people are like, I'm not bragging or anything, but people are in awe.
[00:58:17.039 --> 00:58:18.019]  They're like, you called it.
[00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:19.539]  I called the crew days before.
[00:58:19.659 --> 00:58:21.559]  I said, we'll be shut down about 8 a.m., I would guess.
[00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:39.699]  The fraudulent auctions, you know, at 10.30, they'll want to get their BS in place, they'll sneak attack in the morning, thinking we're not ready, be here, you know, before 8 o'clock, ready to go, at the Infowars studios when they show up to shut it, and have crew here ready so I can drive over here, and we literally caught them exactly as I just,
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:50.000]  you know, it's not me, it's the Holy Spirit, and now that I'm more and more just completely turning loose to it, it's powerful, and it's all God.
[00:58:51.099 --> 00:58:53.889]  So, That's where we are.
[00:58:54.849 --> 00:59:03.980]  And I've got to really watch my security, the gut, the Holy Spirit's telling me, Right now because they are pissed.
[00:59:04.239 --> 00:59:05.219]  I'm not talking about these people.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.059]  I mean, they're bosses.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.079]  Trump's got to be really careful because we are routing them.
[00:59:09.179 --> 00:59:10.539]  Trump's going to really drain the swamp.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.960]  This is insanely amazing.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.400]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:16.099]  Please stay with us.
[00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.719]  Everybody you know and those you don't know, tune in now.
[00:59:18.099 --> 00:59:18.760]  This is incredible.
[00:59:19.019 --> 00:59:20.300]  InfoWars is back.
[00:59:20.739 --> 00:59:22.699]  InfoWars is back in Alex Jones' ownership.
[00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:33.389]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:36.530]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.869]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[00:59:38.969 --> 00:59:40.650]  You exercise your free speech.
[00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:42.590]  You stand up to the bullies.
[00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:46.909]  You exercise your will.
[00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:53.050]  And it keeps this broadcast, if we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:59:53.969 --> 00:59:57.409]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[00:59:57.409 --> 00:59:58.409]  It's all set up.
[00:59:59.519 --> 01:00:07.659]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[01:00:08.719 --> 01:00:13.059]  So you're literally in the information war refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[01:00:13.909 --> 01:00:21.429]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[01:00:22.329 --> 01:00:26.190]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.

[01:00:42.909 --> 01:00:47.349]  25, yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day, when we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:48.429]  That's great.

[01:00:57.809 --> 01:00:58.570]  They're ready right now.

[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.960]  I'll tell you what it is.
[01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:07.300]  It's me taking no for an answer, you know?
[01:02:09.489 --> 01:02:12.750]  It's them selling me, not the other way around.
[01:02:12.969 --> 01:02:16.670]  It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
[01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:23.789]  So...
[01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:31.730]  You know what?
[01:02:40.659 --> 01:02:41.320]  I'm not leaving.
[01:02:44.159 --> 01:02:45.440]  I'm not leaving!
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:55.760]  The show goes on!
[01:02:58.159 --> 01:02:59.719]  This is my home!
[01:03:00.219 --> 01:03:04.719]  They're gonna need a wrecking ball to take me out of here!
[01:03:34.039 --> 01:03:37.579]  Alright, my friends, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.440]  We are now into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:42.320]  Let me just recap.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.059]  They had a fake auction with fake money.
[01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.400]  They did not buy InfoWars.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.219]  They thought they'd sneak it past the judge.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.320]  They got caught.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.400]  It violates so many laws, it makes your head spin on its face.
[01:03:56.739 --> 01:03:59.079]  The guys that did it are now claiming they didn't know.
[01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:03.469]  And they said, oh my God, go back to your studios.
[01:04:03.889 --> 01:04:05.170]  InfoWars is turned back on.
[01:04:05.449 --> 01:04:07.849]  And that was at 11 a.m., an hour and two minutes ago.
[01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:13.690]  So this is a huge deal.
[01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:26.449]  And I'm told by multiple sources, and the media is calling around about this, because I wasn't going to go with this until the media started calling lawyers about it before I'd said a word that they've heard there's criminal investigations going on.
[01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.630]  Not of me, of them.
[01:04:29.929 --> 01:04:32.690]  I mean, these people have thought forever they're above the law.
[01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:36.489]  And they bully a bunch of other people into going along with them.
[01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:40.030]  So, they want to teach me a lesson?
[01:04:40.869 --> 01:04:43.849]  Oh, I've been taught a lesson about how corrupt the system is, don't you worry.
[01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.369]  And I've been taught to fight harder than ever with the truth.
[01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:53.929]  But I got a little secret suspicion that people have been trying to teach me a lesson are going to get taught their own lesson legally and lawfully, peacefully, not violently.
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:59.500]  So, I am not going to back down or roll over to any of this stuff.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.659]  Elon Musk and his lawyers are now involved coming into the case.
[01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:07.000]  And they were there yesterday in Houston.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.400]  And Trump is pissed.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.599]  And they're all watching this.
[01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:13.219]  All right?
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.480]  So this is a big deal.
[01:05:16.659 --> 01:05:19.519]  And Trump has pledged to criminally go after anybody.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.900]  Guys, pull up the video.
[01:05:21.969 --> 01:05:42.010]  From him, he said it a year and a half ago, a year ago, six months ago, a month ago, he's announced and put policy papers out that he's going to criminally go after anybody in government colluding with private organizations and courts to violate the rights of citizens' civil rights in conspiracies against rights.
[01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:47.989]  What did Trump's lawyer say a week ago about Letitia James with new criminal fake cases against Trump?
[01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:55.119]  He said, you go ahead and create more lawfare Go ahead and do more fake charges and we're going to lock your fat ass up.
[01:05:56.239 --> 01:05:58.760]  We're going to lock your fat ass up.
[01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:08.340]  That George Soros witch that ran on putting Trump in prison with all this cooked up horse manure.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.980]  So, I don't know how this is all going to end, but the globalists want to fight.
[01:06:16.409 --> 01:06:17.570]  They better believe they got one.
[01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:21.050]  And if you want one with Donald Trump and Arnold K. Jr.
[01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:31.530]  and Tulsi Gabbards and Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and Alex Jones, you came to the right place because you got one.
[01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:32.989]  Stay with us.
[01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:34.329]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:55.119]  The one thing I want you to do, if I could ask you to do anything for America and Alex and this network and this crew, the one thing I would ask you to do, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club.
[01:06:56.039 --> 01:06:59.199]  It's $30 a month, but you get $40 in store credit.

[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.780]  That is going to ensure that we can fund this operation, fund the next operation, ensure that Alex always has a voice.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.280]  They can try to steal his identity.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.639]  They can try to steal his business.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.199]  They can try to steal America.
[01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:19.500]  They can try to sacrifice humanity in nuclear genocide.
[01:07:20.699 --> 01:07:30.780]  But if you go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club, they'll never take away our voice, they'll never take away our freedom, they'll never take away free speech, and we can save America together.

[01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:44.199]  Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.

[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.039]  Massive bombshell.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.320]  Illegal sale of Infowars now under criminal investigation.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.319]  Alex Jones set to break massive news live on air now.
[01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:22.640]  And I just broke it in the last hour.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.279]  Absolutely stunning.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.479]  Infowars.com now back up.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.899]  We've been told, oh, come back to your studios.
[01:08:29.039 --> 01:08:29.960]  Yeah, the sale didn't happen.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.600]  So there's your headline.
[01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:38.600]  The Onion, the Democrats, didn't have a sale, didn't have an auction, wasn't real, wasn't real money, totally insane.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.979]  Judge didn't know about it.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.779]  Judge didn't authorize that auction.
[01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:43.060]  He said there could be one in the future.
[01:08:43.079 --> 01:08:44.260]  He wanted hearings.
[01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:51.340]  We had filings disputing what they were claiming, and they had been caught with their pants completely down.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.979]  And this is now a national scandal.
[01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.500]  And look at the corporate media.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.720]  Say what you want about Bloomberg.
[01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:00.800]  They're wily.
[01:09:01.119 --> 01:09:02.220]  That's why they're the business news.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.840]  And they wouldn't report on this at first.
[01:09:05.659 --> 01:09:10.439]  And then they came out today and said, Judge Angry believes sale illegal.
[01:09:11.239 --> 01:09:12.819]  You know, it could be illegal.
[01:09:14.119 --> 01:09:15.579]  Sale did not happen.
[01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.819]  Order is evidentiary hearing.
[01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:27.000]  Well, if you actually read the transcripts or listened or watched the hearing, a lot worse than that.
[01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:35.449]  So, I am seriously having trouble even doing the broadcast right now.
[01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.210]  I mean, this is, I don't even know what to say.
[01:09:39.409 --> 01:09:47.689]  I mean, I've known this has been going on against me for a long time, and, you know, it's blowing me away.
[01:09:47.909 --> 01:09:53.510]  I mean, understand, I'd already worked from 8 a.m.
[01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:55.569]  till about 6 p.m.
[01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:56.350]  on a Friday night.
[01:09:59.239 --> 01:10:01.560]  Guys, look up the last Friday of May.
[01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:02.279]  That was the date.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.380]  Look up the 2024 May calendar because I'm going to get the date exactly right.
[01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:06.800]  It was the last Friday of May.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.159]  I don't know what day that was, but it hit the newsletter about it.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:18.199]  And I got my little bag.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.039]  It's got some clothes and stuff I'm taking home in it.
[01:10:22.779 --> 01:10:24.720]  It was the 31st, so it was the last day of May.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:35.840]  And all of a sudden, I see these cars pulling up, private security, and we usually only have a certain number, and I see more, and I go, what's going on?
[01:10:37.479 --> 01:10:48.579]  They're kind of looking at me weird, and I go in, and I go back in and call my lawyers, and they say, yeah, we just got calls.
[01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:53.100]  The U.S. trustee wants to talk to us, and the CRO calls us right back.
[01:10:53.399 --> 01:11:00.359]  So I go talk to one of the guards that I've known a long time, not the extra ones that are showing up, and they go, yeah, I don't know.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:06.659]  They just told us that they're closing the building and changing the locks and everything at 9 p.m.
[01:11:06.739 --> 01:11:08.239]  to 9, and we've got to get you guys out of the building.
[01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:09.539]  And I said, hmm.
[01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:18.750]  So I went, and before I call the lawyers, they just call back, they go, Pat McGill, the CRO, and the U.S. trustee are shutting things down.
[01:11:20.069 --> 01:11:20.850]  I talk to them.
[01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:21.810]  They go, let me get back on the phone.
[01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.189]  So I'm sitting in my office, talk to them like 20, 30 minutes later.
[01:11:25.449 --> 01:11:29.850]  And they go, yeah, they say the families are mad and you're saying things you shouldn't say.
[01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:31.329]  And they later said that in court while they were doing it.
[01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:32.529]  So I was saying, I'm innocent.
[01:11:32.569 --> 01:11:33.590]  You're setting me up.
[01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:35.510]  You make your money off me.
[01:11:35.649 --> 01:11:36.689]  You do fundraisers.
[01:11:36.989 --> 01:11:52.579]  And I'm saying to my lawyers, why would the Sandy Hook lawyers and people be on the phone with a U.S. trustee from the Justice Department And the CRO, the chief restructuring officer that had been literally shutting the place down and doing all this crazy stuff in the last year and a half slowly,
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.439]  creating infighting, trying to set me up, all this stuff he got caught in.
[01:11:57.819 --> 01:12:00.699]  And why are they saying, I mean, there's no court order.
[01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.279]  And my lawyers are like, oh, this is crazy.
[01:12:04.479 --> 01:12:06.279]  And I said, well, I'm going to say I'm going to call the police.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.020]  And they said, well, don't do that yet.
[01:12:08.119 --> 01:12:09.260]  I said, no, I said, let me finish.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.460]  I'm going to call the police and they tell me to get out of the building.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.960]  And they go, yeah, no, definitely.
[01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:15.989]  So then I go talk to him.
[01:12:16.069 --> 01:12:17.569]  I say, get the head of your security company on the phone.
[01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:18.250]  I get him on the phone.
[01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.810]  I say, listen, you've been here eight years.
[01:12:21.029 --> 01:12:21.970]  You don't have a court order.
[01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:23.010]  He goes, listen, I agree.
[01:12:23.069 --> 01:12:24.369]  I wasn't going to kick you out.
[01:12:24.569 --> 01:12:25.869]  This is what we're being told.
[01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.750]  Because I was kind of yelling at him.
[01:12:27.789 --> 01:12:28.770]  He said, hey, man, stop yelling at me.
[01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:29.270]  Let me talk.
[01:12:29.789 --> 01:12:30.590]  I agree with you.
[01:12:30.689 --> 01:12:32.789]  I was just on the phone with him saying there's no court order.
[01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:33.489]  What are you talking about?
[01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:35.430]  He says, well, stop it!
[01:12:35.789 --> 01:12:36.970]  Sort of screaming back at me.
[01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:40.390]  And he says, so don't you effing accuse me of doing this.
[01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:41.770]  That's what they told us to do.
[01:12:41.829 --> 01:12:42.750]  We didn't say we're going to do it.
[01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:45.010]  Don't you effing go off half-cocked on me.
[01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:46.329]  And I said, whoa, whoa, I get it.
[01:12:46.369 --> 01:12:46.890]  I'm pissed off.
[01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:47.590]  He goes, don't worry.
[01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:48.369]  We're not doing that.
[01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:53.600]  And so he settled down and he goes, yeah, this is crazy.
[01:12:53.739 --> 01:12:55.079]  So he starts telling me all the stuff.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.579]  He's like, yeah, they got this trustee.
[01:12:57.779 --> 01:12:58.779]  I'm saying no to her.
[01:12:58.859 --> 01:12:59.979]  He goes, I'm just on the phone with her.
[01:13:00.899 --> 01:13:04.319]  And she's saying, I mean, she's got her lawyer on saying, we're a lawyer.
[01:13:04.439 --> 01:13:05.220]  You know, I'm a lawyer.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.560]  I'm a U.S. trustee.
[01:13:06.819 --> 01:13:08.140]  I don't need a court order.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.460]  Shut it down.
[01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:11.039]  And he's like, no.
[01:13:12.359 --> 01:13:14.840]  And then she's like, well, you're going to violate stuff in the court.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.859]  He was telling me, he goes, so listen, I'm already pissed off.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.020]  He said, look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.920]  He goes, I was just yelling at her.
[01:13:21.909 --> 01:13:23.750]  And he said, I totally agree.
[01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:24.670]  Don't call the police.
[01:13:24.949 --> 01:13:26.109]  You don't have to tell me this.
[01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:26.569]  I know that.
[01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:27.069]  I go, okay.
[01:13:28.989 --> 01:13:31.989]  We were just told get ready for something big, and then now we're being told this.
[01:13:32.109 --> 01:13:35.930]  So I learned basically before he did, they just said get more security there.
[01:13:36.609 --> 01:13:41.390]  Then I learned they created a fake report that somebody had a gun in the building.
[01:13:41.529 --> 01:13:45.989]  He later said this on the stand weeks later in the emergency hearing when the federal judge fired these people.
[01:13:48.079 --> 01:13:48.500]  Big deal.
[01:13:48.659 --> 01:13:50.319]  A U.S. federal trustee being fired off the case.
[01:13:50.439 --> 01:13:51.739]  The CRO kicked off the case.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.100]  The news didn't really report it like that, but that's what happened if you were there.
[01:13:57.579 --> 01:14:03.060]  So that's what we've been dealing with is this level of just wildness.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.260]  And again, you know the government's corrupt.
[01:14:09.399 --> 01:14:10.279]  You know it's out of control.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:16.159]  But until you see it at the grassroots level, like up close with people that have been around...
[01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.909]  I mean, he was there six months, a year and a half ago.
[01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:24.729]  The, quote, CRO, who was really just the trustee's minion.
[01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:31.569]  And I had an ad agency, you know, an ad group.
[01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:34.550]  And John Harmon, that's been here 22 years, does affiliate relations.
[01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:39.390]  But in the old days, I would just have different crew members kind of handle sponsors and make sure the ads got produced.
[01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:40.250]  He's a great video editor.
[01:14:40.449 --> 01:14:41.569]  He does a lot of great stuff.
[01:14:41.850 --> 01:14:43.210]  Cuts up liners and stuff at the stations.
[01:14:43.329 --> 01:14:44.149]  He's, you know, he's a hard worker.
[01:14:44.409 --> 01:14:45.710]  So I told John...
[01:14:46.279 --> 01:14:47.439]  It's going like 15 years ago.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.420]  I said, hey, why don't you get a sponsor or two and handle those?
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.359]  You'll do a better job than even these outside ad agencies and groups.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.500]  You know, sometimes the ad agency makes it, sometimes the sponsor makes it.
[01:14:55.659 --> 01:15:01.760]  And I said, when we're making one for somebody and, you know, I don't have time to talk to the sponsors and deal with it and see what's working best for them, you handle it.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.619]  So Harmon's probably had 20 sponsors over the years he's handled or more.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.619]  He handles the satellite phone people and, you know, a lot of stuff.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.439]  Does a great job.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.939]  And so first we're in corporate bankruptcy.
[01:15:14.619 --> 01:15:21.479]  And I can have it outside ad agency, but that was declared to the bank and to the court and to all the systems.
[01:15:21.899 --> 01:15:31.159]  But when I went into personal bankruptcy about six months into the corporate one, because I was totally upside down, and I was sick of them lying about all these hundreds of millions I had and my parents had.
[01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:34.739]  I wanted to just lift our skirts, say, see, we've been totally truthful, which we were.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.939]  And they said, oh, he's going to go to jail.
[01:15:36.039 --> 01:15:36.439]  We got him.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.479]  And none of that was true.
[01:15:37.579 --> 01:15:38.819]  And I got a huge tax return.
[01:15:38.939 --> 01:15:39.720]  It turned out I'd overpaid.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.819]  And it was like, wow, this is rare.
[01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:43.350]  And he...
[01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:44.710]  Just give me an idea of these people.
[01:15:48.329 --> 01:15:51.789]  From day one, I say, hey, I've got my deal here.
[01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.789]  There'd been another CRO that the judge fired.
[01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:57.649]  Not because of me.
[01:15:58.210 --> 01:15:59.550]  The judge said we were doing what we're supposed to.
[01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:01.590]  The first CRO wasn't a bad guy.
[01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:07.630]  He just had told the court that he'd been a CRO a bunch.
[01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:10.909]  And he'd never been one, basically.
[01:16:11.329 --> 01:16:14.010]  So I think it was like a restaurant that bankrupted or something.
[01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.510]  But that's who said to the court they were there, and that's how it works.
[01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:19.350]  You claim you're this, you're in the rotation.
[01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:26.909]  Most people didn't want to do this for Alex Jones, so a bunch of people refused it in the draft, you know, in the pull.
[01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:28.649]  What's the word you'd call it?
[01:16:29.909 --> 01:16:37.189]  You know, it's just in lines, just rotating, rotating, in the rotation.
[01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:41.340]  So the judge found that out and said, you're not really who you say you are.
[01:16:41.479 --> 01:16:43.220]  Plus, he was not doing a very good job.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:43.840]  Nothing against the guy.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.260]  He was nice.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:49.659]  But I had a deal with him that was pretty standard that, you know, I've still got all these advertisers.
[01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.100]  I get a piece of it.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.619]  My salesman does.
[01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:54.119]  I need money to file the stuff.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:54.560]  Standard.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.939]  I have these sponsors.
[01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:57.699]  And so I had a deal to do that.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.960]  Well, the new guy comes in and now I'm in personal bankruptcy.
[01:17:00.399 --> 01:17:05.340]  And my personal bankruptcy people who are top of the line great said, now you've got to bring all that in.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.300]  You've got to get a new agreement.
[01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:11.609]  Of course, I had already declared it all in my personal bankruptcy to the T. Incredible filings.
[01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:12.609]  The judge said they were amazing.
[01:17:12.909 --> 01:17:14.569]  So it's all reported to the court.
[01:17:15.029 --> 01:17:22.970]  And for at least six months, we have meeting after meeting with my lawyers and with this Pat McGill guy going, hey, we got $50,000.
[01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:24.569]  Then it builds up $100,000.
[01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.930]  Six months later, $200 and something thousand dollars.
[01:17:27.029 --> 01:17:28.069]  It was like $245,000.
[01:17:28.409 --> 01:17:30.909]  And we're like, hey, we need to give this money into the company.
[01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:33.329]  And I'm in personal bankruptcy.
[01:17:33.329 --> 01:17:34.189]  I've declared it.
[01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:36.189]  You need to take the money.
[01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.710]  He goes, ah, just keep it.
[01:17:40.449 --> 01:17:41.310]  To me personally.
[01:17:41.529 --> 01:17:43.430]  And my lawyer's like, you need to watch out.
[01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:45.409]  You do not be in the room alone with that guy.
[01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:46.890]  Because they've been in the meetings with him.
[01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:48.229]  They've got emails and they're witnesses.
[01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:49.050]  They're writing notes.
[01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.689]  And later, you know, they're like, this guy, something's going on.
[01:17:53.329 --> 01:17:56.670]  We've been doing this a long time, but we think, you know, this guy's probably trying to set you up.
[01:17:57.699 --> 01:18:04.199]  And I mean, my main bankruptcy lawyer, he's still awesome, but he's been like the top guy in the country at once.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.920]  I mean, for like huge corporations, all right?
[01:18:06.979 --> 01:18:11.420]  I mean, like oil, like $10 billion bankruptcies and stuff, back when that was like a trillion.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.520]  And he's like, man, my senses are off the charts.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.859]  This is a setup.
[01:18:17.119 --> 01:18:19.840]  This guy's with the feds, blah, blah, blah, probably, you know.
[01:18:20.439 --> 01:18:23.600]  And I'm like, really?
[01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:24.500]  It's down that?
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.039]  He goes, yeah.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.979]  So he goes, we're going to file again with the court that you got this money and try to get the court to make him do something with it.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:41.159]  He then publicly files in the court that he caught me with this money, even though we have all these filings and all these meetings and all these reports.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.560]  Then says, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:18:44.739 --> 01:18:45.699]  You know, I'm your buddy.
[01:18:45.859 --> 01:18:46.800]  I need you to disclose this.
[01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:48.460]  Everybody goes, whoa, don't ever meet with him alone.
[01:18:48.579 --> 01:18:48.939]  Watch out.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:57.800]  Then months later, he files a secret report with the judge saying he caught me in all this stuff.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:07.020]  Meanwhile, the judge knows there's all these filings going back like a year, and that he needs to take control of the company and be the sole managing member.
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:15.720]  And the judge later said in court, when he fired him on June 14th, he goes, under federal law, until something's been ordered, sold, and sold, until the day it's gone, Mr.
[01:19:15.819 --> 01:19:23.909]  Jones is a LLC. He is the owner, the managing member, 100%.
[01:19:23.909 --> 01:19:25.170]  You are not in charge.
[01:19:25.949 --> 01:19:29.550]  But he did a secret filing to make the judge make him in charge.
[01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:34.750]  The judge told him later on in the sand, he goes, I told you then and I'll tell you now, I cannot do that under federal law, Mr.
[01:19:34.869 --> 01:19:35.109]  McGill.
[01:19:36.369 --> 01:19:38.829]  This whole time, you've been operating outside your bounds.
[01:19:41.789 --> 01:19:49.010]  So then the media starts running with this stuff.
[01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:55.170]  And finally he took the money, which is what you're supposed to do.
[01:19:55.289 --> 01:19:58.229]  I mean, you think I'm going to like hide money from a bankruptcy court?
[01:19:58.569 --> 01:19:59.930]  Even I wouldn't do that normally.
[01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:06.939]  I mean, with giant spotlights and auditors and everyone in my life literally searching my house, the attic.
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.579]  I mean, I agreed to it.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.619]  They had people in my house for a day tearing through everything.
[01:20:10.819 --> 01:20:15.739]  They found a stack of cash I'd forgot to take to Italy once in an envelope.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.220]  They go, man, you're really honest.
[01:20:17.319 --> 01:20:18.539]  Yeah, we dug through it all and found this.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.439]  I mean, it's because I wanted to be 100% white glove inspection.
[01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:28.300]  All our storage things, the company, my parents audited, sued, harassed, nothing.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.239]  Turned out my dad had taken less money than they said.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:39.199]  They're like, well, your dad was taking like a half million bucks a year and had a half million bucks in legal fees every year?
[01:20:40.699 --> 01:20:46.779]  Yeah, my dad was basically making no money, just surviving and then using his retirement, which has gone now from suing him.
[01:20:47.439 --> 01:20:51.180]  So they claim he had hundreds of millions of dollars hidden.
[01:20:52.119 --> 01:20:56.779]  So it's always, I'm a criminal, I'm a fraud, I'm hiding stuff, I'm doing this, this is going on.
[01:20:57.979 --> 01:20:58.939]  And then...
[01:21:00.119 --> 01:21:04.000]  I call him when I'm on Tucker Carlson, you know, this is six months ago, eight months ago, whatever it was.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:10.079]  Remember, I'm in the car, driving to Tucker Carlson's house in Florida, and his studios are by his house.
[01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:16.060]  And my lawyer calls and says, check your email.
[01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:18.479]  We've been trying to call you all day.
[01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:21.520]  I've been in a very important meeting in Florida with somebody else, leave it at that.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.340]  So we're driving across the state back over there.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:39.939]  And It's the secret filing he put in to the judge that he caught me and I'm a crook and I can't run the company and I'm a horrible person and he needs to get full control, which he never had.
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.020]  And the judge sends it to us.
[01:21:44.439 --> 01:21:46.840]  And I call McGill and I recorded it, played it on air later.
[01:21:47.279 --> 01:21:49.680]  And I said, hey man, why don't you file this with the court?
[01:21:49.819 --> 01:21:51.800]  I told you before, you lied about that.
[01:21:51.899 --> 01:21:53.819]  You know, he said, Alex, I didn't record any.
[01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.859]  He said, Alex, I didn't file anything on you.
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.380]  I swear to God, that's not real.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:05.539]  I said, funny, it's got the judges sealed and sent it to us from the court, and all the other lawyers got it.
[01:22:05.619 --> 01:22:08.939]  He goes, Alex, I promise you, you've heard the tape.
[01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:11.659]  It was like 50 minutes long.
[01:22:11.819 --> 01:22:16.939]  He said it many, many times, like more than 10 times, that, Alex, that's just not true.
[01:22:19.039 --> 01:22:22.140]  Then, a few months later, he never comes back to the office.
[01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:24.680]  He's usually there like once every two weeks.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.380]  He has them show up and try to close the building.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.840]  And so I'm sitting there watching this, and then the judge puts in a new federal trustee, because the Justice Department wants that.
[01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:43.409]  Because I'm such a crook.
[01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:49.510]  And they said yesterday, they said, my lawyers are like, you need to get him back on.
[01:22:49.649 --> 01:22:50.229]  They don't own this.
[01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:51.609]  You just said it wasn't a real sale.
[01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:54.390]  You need to get Infowars back to Alex Jones.
[01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:55.390]  Well, this is all being decided.
[01:22:55.529 --> 01:22:56.489]  You need to get back on the air.
[01:22:56.609 --> 01:22:57.670]  You need to turn his websites back on.
[01:22:58.789 --> 01:23:01.729]  And the judge says, yeah, I mean, you have to do that, but we need to have an evidentiary hearing.
[01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:08.890]  And they get up, their lawyers, and say, we think his crew will rob the building.
[01:23:09.069 --> 01:23:09.970]  They actually said that.
[01:23:10.529 --> 01:23:11.609]  The judge says, what's your evidence of that?
[01:23:11.789 --> 01:23:15.430]  So the last time somebody's got a gun, we've got to be closed.
[01:23:16.029 --> 01:23:17.930]  This time we're going to rob the building.
[01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:24.689]  And the judge got completely pissed and said, and what's your evidence of that?
[01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:31.529]  So that's what we're dealing with here.
[01:23:34.939 --> 01:23:42.300]  Then these people, the U.S. trustee, had a fake auction that didn't take place.
[01:23:42.779 --> 01:23:53.920]  The people that had a lower bid was for fiat non-existent money, pledging my future earnings for them to buy my company.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.260]  The judge's order said that they would have hearings before an auction.
[01:23:58.479 --> 01:24:00.180]  He didn't even know this auction happened.
[01:24:00.399 --> 01:24:01.859]  It wasn't an auction.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.359]  It was a fake sale.
[01:24:06.719 --> 01:24:09.000]  Masquerading as a auction.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.260]  You can't get bigger than that.
[01:24:12.939 --> 01:24:15.840]  In violation of the judges' orders in federal law.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.819]  Cut and dry.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.439]  And then you got the bid collusion, that's a felony.
[01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:36.789]  And they're in the news yesterday and today being interviewed, the Onion, the Democrats, the Democrat law firm, the federal trustee, going, well, it's not the biggest bid, but it was the best.
[01:24:36.909 --> 01:24:38.670]  The families wanted to have it.
[01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:49.850]  The families think Justice Department, CIA, deep state, Democrats using the plaintiffs.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:58.699]  So they just admitted that, hey, it's for the families.
[01:24:58.699 --> 01:24:59.239]  It's okay.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:13.640]  I mean, we did have a fake auction, and we had already agreed to give it to them, and we told people at the last minute it's a new auction where it's not public, and you can't upbid, and you just give us an envelope, and we decide, but it doesn't have to be the biggest.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.539]  And I said on Monday, I said, it's over.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.239]  They gave it to them.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.600]  I said, I bet they don't even pay money.
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.340]  Lawyers are like, come on, I've never heard of something like that.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:22.640]  I said, watch.
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.699]  I said, they'll shut me down 8 a.m.
[01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:25.199]  on Tuesday.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.000]  They held it, of course, to the minute.
[01:25:27.939 --> 01:25:29.560]  I mean, I just know these people.
[01:25:29.979 --> 01:25:37.960]  So, you think of the worst thing you can when you understand the mechanisms they've got, and that's what they'll do.
[01:25:38.039 --> 01:25:48.789]  Because they sit around and they come up with the most horrible, bad, It's twisted, bizarre, I mean, a fake auction for a fake purchase.
[01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:53.909]  Not just that they didn't get the purchase, the media said they got it, as the judge said.
[01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.369]  No, no.
[01:25:54.569 --> 01:25:58.550]  I mean, it wasn't even real money that they put at a lesser amount to get it.
[01:25:58.689 --> 01:25:59.829]  I mean, that's like perfect.
[01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:02.470]  Like perfect inversion.
[01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:04.970]  Like God is perfect and Satanism is inversion.
[01:26:05.329 --> 01:26:08.010]  It's like everything is a lie.
[01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:10.770]  Everything is BS. It's a work of art.
[01:26:10.909 --> 01:26:18.289]  It's like, how do you, I mean, and I get why with other people this works because it's just, it's like New York Times articles.
[01:26:18.489 --> 01:26:19.250]  I use this one all the time.
[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:23.029]  There's been so many, but it's like, oh, I worked for Alex Jones.
[01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.970]  It was terrible or whatever.
[01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:27.010]  And then it's like you read it and 99% isn't true.
[01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:38.310]  But it's this elaborate fantasy land of lies and twisted BS, and it's so complex, and you're reading it about yourself going, is any of this?
[01:26:38.449 --> 01:26:39.310]  No, none of that ever happened.
[01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:40.090]  What?
[01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:41.090]  What?
[01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:49.750]  Jones walks into the coffee room and grabs the black woman's ass and says, I want to have babies and marry you.
[01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:52.189]  What?
[01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.550]  Zero happened.
[01:26:58.090 --> 01:27:00.409]  Jones was mad at employees for not working hard.
[01:27:00.909 --> 01:27:07.329]  So he walked up to a fish tank, called them into a conference room, and grabbed the goldfish out and ate it and said, get to work.
[01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:10.689]  And I went, that's the Wolf of Wall Street!
[01:27:10.909 --> 01:27:11.590]  Any idiot!
[01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:14.569]  Literally, they're like, let's put Wolf of Wall Street in there!
[01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:15.789]  And they go, wait, it's better.
[01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:17.590]  Let's add Finding Nemo.
[01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:23.989]  The fish was about to be given to that employee's niece.
[01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:27.529]  There was never a fish tank in the building.
[01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:30.550]  There was no fish being eaten.
[01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:32.289]  There was no niece.
[01:27:35.369 --> 01:27:36.829]  But you read that.
[01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:43.880]  And it's some kind of, I think the CIA must be writing these or something, because when you really read it, you're saying, wait a minute, those are movies.
[01:27:44.039 --> 01:27:46.000]  They know everybody already knows about Wolf of Wall Street.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.279]  They already know about Fighting Nemo, but they don't remember.
[01:27:48.479 --> 01:27:51.220]  When you read that, people feel like they've seen that before.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.159]  Oh, yeah, I eat the goldfish.
[01:27:53.739 --> 01:27:55.359]  Oh, yeah, it was for the niece.
[01:27:55.539 --> 01:27:59.619]  And the whole thing is about Fighting Nemo, you know, the fish...
[01:28:00.079 --> 01:28:01.600]  You know, being grabbed for the niece.
[01:28:02.239 --> 01:28:06.539]  And then you start reading other articles by other people, and you see, wait, wait, that's from a movie.
[01:28:06.619 --> 01:28:07.359]  That's from a movie.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.300]  That's from a movie.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.020]  So they're not just plagiarizing.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.619]  I figured it out.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:22.100]  They're doing that because people who are unconscious, and most of the public's now in kind of a mesmerized near-sleep level, there's studies out on that, from all the TV and stuff, people are like, ugh, kind of NPCs.
[01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:27.380]  An NPC reads that and goes, yeah, yeah, because their brain has seen that.
[01:28:28.159 --> 01:28:33.819]  Their brain knows somebody ate the fish that was the nieces.
[01:28:35.659 --> 01:28:37.140]  And you're like, wow.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.760]  The people's names they put on these didn't write these.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.579]  Their names just put on it.
[01:28:43.479 --> 01:28:45.239]  And that's why they want to interview people.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.659]  Every time I interview about the mainstream media, they never put really anything I said in it.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.659]  They just act like they talk to me to give it some type of credibility.
[01:28:52.859 --> 01:28:54.680]  And I know most people are going, yeah, we already know all this, Alex.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.800]  But that's what I'm saying is, And they just assault you with just, you know, two men can have a baby.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.180]  There's no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.539]  There's no inflation.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.600]  It's Trump's fault there's inflation.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.920]  Inflation was higher under Trump.
[01:29:10.039 --> 01:29:10.439]  Not true.
[01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.359]  All the Mexicans are criminals.
[01:29:13.479 --> 01:29:14.180]  Never said that.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.039]  He said the KKK are fine people.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:16.960]  Never said that.
[01:29:18.079 --> 01:29:19.960]  But it just becomes this thing.
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.060]  Jones sent people to attack people's families.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.340]  Jones had people pee on graves.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.920]  There's no proof anybody attacked them or peed on graves.
[01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:28.409]  And I didn't do any of that.
[01:29:29.609 --> 01:29:34.109]  All they ever show in the news is me saying, yeah, that looks like acting to me.
[01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:35.789]  Yeah, I mean, so much stuff's fake.
[01:29:35.949 --> 01:29:36.750]  Yeah, it probably is.
[01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:41.630]  They got like two clips, a billion and a half dollars.
[01:29:41.949 --> 01:29:44.850]  But again, they're the victims and they tie it to you.
[01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:46.529]  And then they run this media stuff.
[01:29:46.649 --> 01:29:56.029]  That's what thousands of articles and TV shows and programs and lies and just, oh, because it's all a big Democrat Party fundraising thing run by Obama.
[01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.369]  They admit that.
[01:29:58.369 --> 01:30:01.850]  Raising hundreds of millions of dollars for their projects, for their operations.
[01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:05.390]  That's why it's in Hunter Biden's laptop and it came out on Biden.
[01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:11.180]  How they're using different Democrat charities and things to, you know, carry out their operations.
[01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:18.140]  And that's pretty good, you know, if you're an organized crime syndicate, you know, to use stuff like that.
[01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:19.890]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:29.270]  But once you know that you're dealing with supervillains that run it, not the minions on the bottom that are useful idiots, then you're like, think like a supervillain, think like a supervillain, and then you got it.
[01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:30.029]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:32.069]  Follow me on X at Rolex Jones.
[01:30:32.369 --> 01:30:33.409]  InfoWars is back up.
[01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:36.149]  For now, it's being given back to the rifle owner.
[01:30:36.369 --> 01:30:36.869]  Yours truly.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:54.579]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:31:04.039]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[01:31:04.649 --> 01:31:08.430]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:09.050]  Who knows?
[01:31:09.569 --> 01:31:12.029]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[01:31:12.489 --> 01:31:26.670]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:31.090]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:34.189]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:47.130]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:04.470]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:08.029]  But that's going to get announced, the winner, here in just a few days.
[01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:12.210]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:15.710]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.
[01:32:15.949 --> 01:32:16.550]  So now...
[01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:24.869]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the darkest hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:30.770]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.

[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.180]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[01:34:33.439 --> 01:34:34.340]  God bless you all.

[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:04.659]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:09.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:35:12.609 --> 01:35:17.470]  All right, so I've just spent an hour and a half breaking down what really happened to InfoWars.
[01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:19.729]  As of 11 a.m.
[01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:23.470]  Central this morning, we're about 10.55.
[01:35:25.489 --> 01:35:26.489]  It had already happened.
[01:35:26.529 --> 01:35:27.189]  I got the calls.
[01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:29.109]  They're like, come back to your studios.
[01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:30.529]  InfoWars is yours.
[01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:31.670]  The sale didn't go through.
[01:35:31.949 --> 01:35:32.869]  The judge said so.
[01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.609]  You're right.
[01:35:33.609 --> 01:35:34.149]  We're sorry.
[01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:34.729]  We didn't know.
[01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:35.409]  We're not criminals.
[01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:38.310]  You know, that's what's going on.
[01:35:39.369 --> 01:35:41.010]  And it's beyond epic.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:56.039]  And it's been open season on me and Trump and the American people and our veterans and poison shots and hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors fired because they wouldn't take an experimental shot when the damn federal law says it violates serious federal law, Nuremberg II, Geneva Convention.
[01:35:56.819 --> 01:35:58.340]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[01:35:59.699 --> 01:36:02.239]  And now Elon Musk is everywhere with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.439]  saying we're going to get big pharma, we're going to arrest the pharma heads.
[01:36:06.779 --> 01:36:10.300]  He's been doing that since last week, like he moved from one target getting Trump into the next.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.960]  It almost killed his brother the shot.
[01:36:12.779 --> 01:36:19.199]  Elon Musk, big lawyers, came to our thing yesterday and said, you're not getting his social media, we're ready to go to war.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:29.020]  So, and then I confirmed that Trump, Elon Musk are, quote, upset about what they did to Infowars.
[01:36:30.239 --> 01:36:33.899]  And I didn't talk about that when I learned that yesterday, very early in the day.
[01:36:34.699 --> 01:36:38.539]  In fact, I got bitched out, basically, because they didn't understand exactly what was going on.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.180]  And these people are pissed.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:44.859]  I mean, Trump is on a war path.
[01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:49.260]  And they thought I was going along with it.
[01:36:49.439 --> 01:36:50.840]  I was like, no, I'm not.
[01:36:53.039 --> 01:36:54.659]  So, I mean, that's how pissed they are.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.579]  And that's good when your leaders are so...
[01:36:56.579 --> 01:37:00.640]  I mean, that's the attitude you want.
[01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:05.409]  So, I mean, Trump is on war path.
[01:37:06.909 --> 01:37:24.369]  And you're not going to have to wait for the new Attorney General for stuff on this and other things, because Trump has made it a centerpiece, just like the border, ending World War III, going after Big Pharma that set him up with RFK Jr.,
[01:37:24.369 --> 01:37:27.050]  which I told you behind the scenes was done.
[01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:28.710]  We're never going to get an apology from Trump.
[01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:29.489]  You're just going to get this.
[01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:47.789]  And Trump is going on the total warpath with executive orders, day one, to fire federal employees who've been caught, and it's already happened in Congress, all the documents, more coming out, with the weaponization hearings, that worked with big tech illegally in collusion.
[01:37:47.789 --> 01:37:48.770]  That's a felony.
[01:37:49.090 --> 01:37:51.930]  They're going to be fired, and many of them will be prosecuted.
[01:37:52.050 --> 01:38:09.630]  And I'm telling you, Trump is prioritizing shutting down the border, fighting the missing kids, stopping World War III, stabilizing the dollar, getting energy prices cut, getting inflation under control, and Making America healthy again and going after the censors.
[01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:13.949]  And boy, did the Democrats just tee this up.
[01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:18.449]  I mean, you just teed it up real nice for Trump and Musk.
[01:38:20.159 --> 01:38:22.979]  And I mean, I know we're a big show, and I know this is important.
[01:38:23.119 --> 01:38:25.140]  If I was a small show, what they did is horrible.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:31.380]  But looks like it's, I'm going to say, looks like it's going, it's happening.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.159]  Unless they kill Trump or something.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:34.800]  Which they're sure going to try.
[01:38:35.399 --> 01:38:39.399]  Marty F. So, this is a big deal.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.399]  And people really screwed up.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.760]  So, They think because they wave kids around and act like I killed kids or something.
[01:38:49.859 --> 01:38:50.500]  I'm Adam Lanza.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.000]  They can just do anything they want to me and set the precedent.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.239]  People know.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:56.819]  The majority of people now that know about this know what went on.
[01:38:57.079 --> 01:38:59.439]  They know about the rigged trials where I was already found guilty.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.939]  They know I didn't do the things they said.
[01:39:01.079 --> 01:39:02.119]  And people don't like it.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.600]  Just like the Mendez brothers, I use that as an example.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:14.279]  The government, the police, the judges knew he'd been brutally raping them since they were babies, still raping them every few days, doing things that are just horrible.
[01:39:15.239 --> 01:39:19.340]  And the police confirmed it all, still sent them to prison.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.680]  I mean, who would blame them for what they did?
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.140]  Now, those are people that, you know, murdered their parents.
[01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.949]  What have I done?
[01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.789]  Nothing.
[01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.869]  I mean, literally.
[01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.829]  Nothing.
[01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:34.369]  Nothing they said I did, I did.
[01:39:34.449 --> 01:39:35.430]  I did nothing.
[01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:48.210]  And they attached themselves to me to be victims of Alex Jones and exaggerated and twisted stuff to the 10th degree to get all this money and attention.
[01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:53.270]  And then they knew that I didn't have all this money.
[01:39:53.489 --> 01:39:55.930]  And then they said, we don't want money.
[01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:56.670]  We want him off the air.
[01:39:58.130 --> 01:40:03.130]  And then they wouldn't even come in with their endless money and buy info or to shut it down.
[01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:07.189]  They're so entitled that they bullied with threats of lawsuits.
[01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:10.649]  We now know that because people are talking.
[01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:16.430]  Hey, they were threatening to sue me and they got a lot of money and I'm just a federal trustee and I'm just trying to be nice to them.
[01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:21.630]  I mean, they didn't want to pay money and we wanted to give it to them and I just gave it to them.
[01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:24.470]  He's telling the press, I just gave them.
[01:40:24.829 --> 01:40:26.590]  I mean, you're the bad guy.
[01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:28.590]  No hard feelings.
[01:40:30.529 --> 01:40:33.409]  They just get anything they want.
[01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:38.649]  It's a house of cards.
[01:40:39.729 --> 01:40:41.550]  And that's what always happens.
[01:40:42.909 --> 01:40:46.489]  And God always brings light to darkness.
[01:40:47.609 --> 01:40:58.199]  And so, I don't know how all this is going to permeate and how it's going to roll out and how it's all going to go, but It's going down.
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:07.619]  And Trump has pledged to fire thousands of federal employees, caught censoring, and the whole censorship industrial complex.
[01:41:07.659 --> 01:41:08.359]  It's massive.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:08.920]  So let me say this.
[01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:10.600]  I'm going to play a clip from Trump and then get into all the other news.
[01:41:10.619 --> 01:41:11.640]  I'm going to stop talking about this now.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:20.539]  And General Flynn is coming up in 35 minutes, 15 after next hour.
[01:41:22.359 --> 01:41:22.760]  Roughly.
[01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:27.149]  I'm not plugged an hour and 39 minutes in.
[01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:30.569]  It takes money to fight the new world order.
[01:41:31.069 --> 01:41:33.229]  It takes money to go after the globalist.
[01:41:33.369 --> 01:41:34.590]  I cannot do it without you.
[01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:38.829]  Plus, we have great products that make it easy for you to be part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:41:39.069 --> 01:41:42.689]  At thealexjonesstore.com, there's another super truck up there.

[01:42:02.859 --> 01:42:03.960]  He can really help us.
[01:42:04.439 --> 01:42:05.819]  So we get some real funds in on those.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.800]  There is so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:42:19.539 --> 01:42:23.439]  The ultimate CMOS, people that don't know about CMOS go, oh, CMOS, I'll bomb your boat.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.359]  Irish sea moss is, hands down now, the superfood.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.659]  It's as miraculous as hemp, the stuff that it does.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.460]  And it's how God made it and how it has the best organic iodine that goes right to your blood system.
[01:42:35.479 --> 01:42:44.279]  And it's got these other key trace vitamins and minerals that just, energy, libido, immune system, skin, hair, just everything.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:45.539]  I mean, I'm on it right now.
[01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:53.229]  And we've got, from a top-rated firm in the country, that's what we do with our sponsors, or when we have supplements that I've come out with, we just go, what's already highly rated?
[01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:55.369]  Okay, there's, you know, hundreds of brands of this.
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:56.390]  Here's the top two or three.
[01:42:56.609 --> 01:42:57.430]  We start calling.
[01:42:57.489 --> 01:42:58.890]  Will you private label it for Alex Jones?
[01:42:59.050 --> 01:42:59.810]  One of them says no.
[01:43:00.069 --> 01:43:00.710]  One of them says maybe.
[01:43:00.789 --> 01:43:01.729]  The other says, hell yeah, I will.
[01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:02.229]  I love you.
[01:43:03.170 --> 01:43:04.250]  Well, we really need funds.
[01:43:04.329 --> 01:43:05.329]  We give us an even better deal on it.
[01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:07.170]  Sure, if you order, you know, 10,000 bottles of it.
[01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:09.390]  So it's how Fight Club works.
[01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:10.170]  Hey, you don't want to work with us?
[01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.350]  Great.
[01:43:10.449 --> 01:43:10.930]  We know that.
[01:43:11.329 --> 01:43:11.609]  Okay?
[01:43:12.170 --> 01:43:12.449]  So...
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.079]  And it's one of the top rated.
[01:43:15.319 --> 01:43:18.100]  So it's already all tested by the FDA and all that crap.
[01:43:18.119 --> 01:43:20.319]  But the point is, when you get the highest rated, people already love it.
[01:43:20.359 --> 01:43:21.140]  You already know it's good.
[01:43:21.279 --> 01:43:22.079]  You already know it's the best.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.500]  So you're not reinventing the wheel.
[01:43:23.659 --> 01:43:25.039]  We slap our label on it.
[01:43:25.979 --> 01:43:26.260]  Boom.
[01:43:27.039 --> 01:43:28.039]  Then you find our operation.
[01:43:29.039 --> 01:43:31.520]  You want to take CMO. People say, man, your skin's glowing.
[01:43:31.619 --> 01:43:31.840]  You're whatever.
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.920]  I'm gobbling all the supplements.
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.359]  I always forget to take my own supplements.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.140]  I take them here and there.
[01:43:36.239 --> 01:43:38.739]  No, I religiously take them now.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:42.760]  Okay, so you want Ultimate CMOS at thealexandestore.com.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.420]  The powdered caps are twice as strong as the gummies.
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:46.779]  People love the gummies.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.420]  I love them too, but they're sold out.
[01:43:49.819 --> 01:43:52.159]  But the powdered is twice as strong.
[01:43:52.439 --> 01:43:57.939]  The gummies are the equivalent of 20 grams of CMOS per serving, which is two gummies.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.560]  This is twice as strong.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.619]  It's the equivalent of 40 grams per serving, which is two pills.
[01:44:05.359 --> 01:44:08.399]  The concentrated CMOS, 40 grams.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.260]  That's a lot.
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:11.960]  Okay, so it's strong.
[01:44:12.899 --> 01:44:16.180]  All right, you can just eat regular CMOS. In fact, this is concentrate.
[01:44:17.439 --> 01:44:18.520]  You want to get it.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.359]  It's amazing.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.260]  Ultimate CMOS, the AlexJonesStore.com forward slash VIP. Anybody that's buying anything, there should be a VIP member.

[01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:57.390]  drjonesnaturals.com has game-changing supplements like Next Level Foundational Energy, the highest quality quercetin, and CoQ10.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.180]  Basically half off what similar high-quality brands are selling.
[01:45:02.359 --> 01:45:04.420]  The stuff of this quality sells for $60 all day.
[01:45:04.539 --> 01:45:09.060]  It's $30 right now for the Corsetin, for the CoQ10.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.060]  Energizes your cells, whole body.
[01:45:11.159 --> 01:45:12.340]  Everybody should be on it, especially in the winter.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.159]  I'm about to tell you about CoQ10 and Corsetin.
[01:45:14.319 --> 01:45:18.619]  This is high-quality, private-labeled, big-top-rated brand, private-labeled by my dad.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:19.579]  So you know it's great.
[01:45:19.659 --> 01:45:21.000]  You buy it from us, you get a great deal.
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:23.060]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:45:23.670 --> 01:45:24.649]  Critical to the fight.
[01:45:24.789 --> 01:45:26.729]  So celebrate this fight against the globalists.
[01:45:26.869 --> 01:45:27.989]  Go to just the initials.
[01:45:28.029 --> 01:45:28.750]  We'll put it on the screen if we can.
[01:45:29.329 --> 01:45:30.590]  D.R. Jones Naturals.
[01:45:30.689 --> 01:45:31.489]  You don't spell it doctor.
[01:45:31.989 --> 01:45:41.970]  Just drjonesnaturals.com is the URL. Thank you for your support.
[01:45:43.329 --> 01:45:46.970]  drjonesnaturals.com or the alexjonesstore.com.
[01:45:48.069 --> 01:45:48.710]  All right.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.859]  Let me play this Trump clip, and then I'm going to, before Flynn comes in, get into all the other big news.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.340]  And I've got to stop just talking about this, even though we have record listeners on X right now.
[01:46:01.619 --> 01:46:02.739]  People want to hear about this.
[01:46:02.739 --> 01:46:03.699]  This is a big victory for everybody.
[01:46:03.699 --> 01:46:13.319]  We haven't fully gone through what it means, but, I mean, they are, I mean, they are, this is wild.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.840]  If you just tuned in, InfoWars is back.
[01:46:18.159 --> 01:46:20.159]  We got word as we went on air.
[01:46:20.319 --> 01:46:20.899]  Hey, come back.
[01:46:20.899 --> 01:46:21.340]  It's yours.
[01:46:21.479 --> 01:46:21.739]  You're right.
[01:46:21.819 --> 01:46:22.699]  The cell didn't go through.
[01:46:23.239 --> 01:46:24.159]  InfoWars is yours.
[01:46:25.119 --> 01:46:25.760]  For now.
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:30.460]  And then the debate, well, will there be another auction that'll really be real and transparent?
[01:46:30.659 --> 01:46:35.579]  Or did the real winner that got blocked, that's what the law says.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.880]  The good guys get InfoWars.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:41.939]  So, that's the bare minimum.
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:43.260]  One of those two things.
[01:46:43.859 --> 01:46:44.899]  That's what everybody's saying.
[01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:47.489]  That's what the judge basically said.
[01:46:47.670 --> 01:46:48.630]  There's not been an auction.
[01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:50.229]  This isn't an auction.
[01:46:50.489 --> 01:46:51.270]  It's not public.
[01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.989]  You can't bid up.
[01:46:53.069 --> 01:46:54.510]  He's like, he asked the yesterday.
[01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:56.270]  He goes, okay, what's the winning bid paid?
[01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:57.369]  He goes, I don't know.
[01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:01.630]  The judge goes, well, I'd like to see that bid.
[01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:03.829]  I'll try to get that for your honor.
[01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:05.829]  And then we got it.
[01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:09.010]  The Patriots got it last night, the other bidders.
[01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:16.750]  And I can know why he didn't want to tell the judge what was paid.
[01:47:18.909 --> 01:47:20.069]  Can you guess what was paid?
[01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:23.989]  The winning bid?
[01:47:24.729 --> 01:47:27.630]  You know, an auction, the definition of an auction is sold the highest bidder.
[01:47:27.789 --> 01:47:28.390]  That's the definition.
[01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:37.789]  They pledged Fingazi, what's that Italian term for air?
[01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:39.729]  Nothing made up.
[01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:50.729]  They pledged a fraction of their billion and a half dollar judgment that's on appeal, that's ridiculous, the money doesn't exist anyways, to buy the company.
[01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.789]  Nothing.
[01:47:54.489 --> 01:47:56.449]  Can you imagine that?
[01:47:57.279 --> 01:48:08.100]  When the judge's order said the auction was for cash and he hadn't authorized the auction yet, he'd authorized there to be an auction in the future after hearings to iron it all out so there would not be litigation.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:27.619]  And then you've got on its face bid rigging Where the U.S. trustee, I guess when he thought he was in the clear yesterday or didn't know what he was doing, he's a lawyer, maybe he doesn't know.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.640]  Maybe he even had a stroke recently.
[01:48:29.859 --> 01:48:32.199]  I'm not saying he has, but maybe he just, I don't know what happened to him.
[01:48:32.199 --> 01:48:35.840]  Maybe it was the men in black, a racist memory or something.
[01:48:36.439 --> 01:48:41.060]  But he's telling the media, well, I mean, I like the family, so I gave it to them.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.920]  It's not the best, it's not the biggest bid.
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.380]  It's the best bid.
[01:48:45.479 --> 01:48:45.859]  That's a quote.
[01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:49.270]  It's not the biggest bid.
[01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:50.310]  It's the best bid.
[01:48:50.449 --> 01:48:51.590]  And the judge's like, what is that bid?
[01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:53.729]  I can't tell you, sir.
[01:48:55.770 --> 01:48:56.130]  Funny.
[01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:58.590]  You had all the paperwork filled out with your signature on it.
[01:49:00.710 --> 01:49:04.989]  And the other bidders under law, you did give it to them last night, I guess, when you started to figure something out.
[01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:09.689]  Did you just hear what I just said?
[01:49:12.449 --> 01:49:13.949]  And it's all hitting the news right now.
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.880]  Well, here's what Trump says is coming.
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:22.859]  When government and media and the system collude together, here's what Trump's pledged to do.
[01:49:23.039 --> 01:49:27.380]  If we don't have free speech, then we just don't have a free country.
[01:49:27.659 --> 01:49:29.020]  It's as simple as that.
[01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:38.140]  If this most fundamental right is allowed to perish, then the rest of our rights and liberties will topple, just like dominoes, one by one.
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:39.119]  They'll go down.
[01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:45.479]  That's why today I'm announcing my plan to shatter the left-wing censorship regime.
[01:49:45.989 --> 01:49:49.609]  And to reclaim the right to free speech for all Americans.
[01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:55.090]  And reclaim is a very important word in this case, because they've taken it away.
[01:49:55.489 --> 01:50:12.930]  In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of deep state bureaucrats, Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists, and depraved corporate news media have been conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people.
[01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:20.470]  They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to public health.
[01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:28.109]  The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed, and it must happen immediately.
[01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:29.510]  And here is my plan.
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:48.619]  First, within hours of my inauguration, I will sign an executive order banning any federal department or agency from colluding with any organization, business or person to censor, limit, categorize or impede the lawful speech of American citizens.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:56.899]  I will then ban federal money from being used to label domestic speech as mis or disinformation.
[01:50:57.399 --> 01:51:12.560]  And I will begin the process of identifying and firing every federal bureaucrat who has engaged in domestic censorship, directly or indirectly, whether they are the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health,
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:17.529]  Human Services, the FBI, The DOJ, no matter who they are.
[01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:34.270]  Second, I will order the Department of Justice to investigate all parties involved in the new online censorship regime, which is absolutely destructive and terrible, and to aggressively prosecute any and all crimes identified.
[01:51:35.090 --> 01:51:50.529]  These include possible violations of federal civil rights law, campaign finance laws, federal election law, securities law and antitrust laws, the Hatch Act, and a host of other potential criminal, civil, regulatory,
[01:51:50.949 --> 01:51:53.029]  and constitutional offenses.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:52:00.960]  To assist in these efforts, I am urging House Republicans to immediately send preservation letters.
[01:52:01.279 --> 01:52:12.779]  And we have to do this right now to the Biden administration, the Biden campaign, and every Silicon Valley tech giant, ordering them not to destroy evidence of censorship.
[01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:26.069]  Third, upon my inauguration as president, I will ask Congress to send a bill to my desk revising Section 230 to get big online platforms out of censorship business.
[01:52:26.909 --> 01:52:38.909]  From now on, digital platforms should only qualify for immunity protection under Section 230 if they meet high standards of neutrality, transparency, fairness, and non-discrimination.
[01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:56.670]  We should require these platforms to increase their efforts to take down unlawful content such as child exploitation and promoting terrorism while dramatically curtailing their power to arbitrarily restrict lawful speech.
[01:52:57.319 --> 01:53:07.020]  Fourth, we need to break up the entire toxic censorship industry that has arisen under the false guise of tackling so-called myths and disinformation.
[01:53:07.539 --> 01:53:16.460]  The federal government should immediately stop funding all non-profits and academic programs that support this authoritarian project.
[01:53:17.029 --> 01:53:38.729]  If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election interferences in the past, such as flagging social media content for removal of blacklisting, those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student loan support for a period of five years and maybe more.
[01:53:39.399 --> 01:53:53.020]  We should also enact new laws laying out clear criminal penalties for federal bureaucrats who partner with private entities to do an end run around the Constitution and deprive Americans of their first...
[01:53:54.510 --> 01:54:00.109]  Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, in other words, deprive them of their vote.
[01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:06.909]  And once you lose those elections, and once you lose your borders like we have, you no longer have a country.
[01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:22.989]  Furthermore, to confront the problems of major platforms being infiltrated by legions of former deep staters and intelligence officials, there should be a seven-year calling-off period before any employee of the FBI CIA,
[01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:34.550]  NSA, DNI, DHS, or DOD is allowed to take a job at a company possessing vast quantities of US user data.
[01:54:35.569 --> 01:54:40.369]  Fifth, the time has finally come for Congress to pass a digital Bill of Rights.
[01:54:40.630 --> 01:54:44.850]  This should include a right to digital due process.
[01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:56.510]  In other words, government officials should need a court order to take down online content, not send information requests such as the FBI was sending to Twitter.
[01:54:56.949 --> 01:55:12.649]  Furthermore, when users of big online platforms have their content or accounts removed, Throttled, shadow banned, or otherwise restricted, no matter what name they use, they should have the right to be informed that it's happening,
[01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:19.770]  the right to a specific explanation of the reason why, and the right to a timely appeal.
[01:55:20.489 --> 01:55:33.569]  In addition, all users over the age of 18 should have the right to opt out of content, moderation, and curation entirely and receive an unmanipulated stream of information if they so choose.
[01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:41.829]  The fight for free speech is a matter of victory or death for America and for the survival of Western civilization itself.
[01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:50.520]  When I am president, this whole rotten system of censorship and information control We'll be ripped out of the system at large.
[01:55:50.819 --> 01:55:53.039]  There won't be anything left.
[01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:58.539]  By restoring free speech, we'll begin to reclaim our democracy and save our nation.
[01:55:58.859 --> 01:56:01.100]  Thank you, and God bless America.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.199]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:09.060]  And we are exposing the tyranny of the globalist here today.
[01:56:09.239 --> 01:56:12.079]  General Flynn is coming up.
[01:56:12.199 --> 01:56:14.539]  All right, I have dozens of stories I need to get to now.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.279]  Here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:17.409 --> 01:56:17.930]  Breaking.
[01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:21.810]  UN manager claims war is the only way to make serious cash.
[01:56:22.029 --> 01:56:30.970]  Says lazy staff were rooting for Nikki Haley for US President over Trump because they want a war.
[01:56:32.829 --> 01:56:39.449]  And now we have Zelensky coming out, the dictator of Ukraine.
[01:56:39.449 --> 01:56:43.449]  He's banned his opposition, didn't have an election, stayed in power.
[01:56:44.050 --> 01:56:46.630]  The war will end faster under Trump administration.
[01:56:48.810 --> 01:56:55.770]  It's very important for us to have a just peace so that we do not feel that we have lost our best because of the injustice that's been imposed on you.
[01:56:55.989 --> 01:57:00.689]  The war will end, but there is no exact date, certainly with the policies of this team.
[01:57:00.789 --> 01:57:02.689]  We will now lead the White House.
[01:57:02.850 --> 01:57:04.090]  The war will end sooner.
[01:57:04.289 --> 01:57:08.510]  This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it's also very important to them.
[01:57:08.789 --> 01:57:09.789]  And he goes on.
[01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:12.850]  So here is the clip.
[01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:22.689]  Project Veritas released undercover video of a U.N. manager admitting that war is the only way to make serious cash and that lazy staff are rooting for warmonger Haley to be president over Trump.
[01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:27.770]  The United Nations manager of peacekeepers has said the quiet part out loud.
[01:57:27.850 --> 01:57:30.630]  Yeah, the peacekeepers are the warmongers.
[01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:32.550]  This is powerful.
[01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:35.869]  The full report is going up on Infowars.com.
[01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:36.770]  Now back up.
[01:57:37.569 --> 01:57:39.090]  The sale did not go through.
[01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:40.829]  It was not a real auction.
[01:57:41.329 --> 01:57:50.050]  As I told everybody, And these are my personal views and analysis and opinions, but that's what I see, and that's what's basically being reported.
[01:57:51.170 --> 01:57:53.869]  So, this is a big deal.
[01:57:54.710 --> 01:57:56.930]  All right, let's go ahead and roll this clip.
[01:57:57.329 --> 01:57:58.810]  U.N. finds a lot of squatters.
[01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:03.630]  I would say, like, a good portion of the people that are squatters.
[01:58:03.829 --> 01:58:08.750]  In my opinion, like, my interpretation.
[01:58:08.989 --> 01:58:09.750]  But what do you do?
[01:58:10.409 --> 01:58:12.380]  Explode the U.N. Right.
[01:58:12.659 --> 01:58:14.859]  I look at innovation and peacekeeping.
[01:58:15.119 --> 01:58:21.819]  So obviously we have missions across the world where we, in theory, are trying to keep conflict at bay.
[01:58:22.539 --> 01:58:23.100]  Amazing.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:25.859]  And it's also a people game, right?
[01:58:25.939 --> 01:58:27.260]  Like we have peacekeepers on the ground.
[01:58:28.029 --> 01:58:31.029]  So people are employed at the UN that actually don't work?
[01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.909]  Really?
[01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.949]  Really?
[01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:43.069]  It's an environment where, again, you have a stable job.
[01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:45.289]  You're not going to be fired.
[01:58:45.810 --> 01:58:47.090]  You also don't get evaluated.
[01:58:47.649 --> 01:58:50.850]  The only way you make money in the UN is if you go to war.
[01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:55.250]  A war for a country, you get paid more.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:56.520]  Really?
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:02.060]  If you're living in, like, dark horror and you could die, they're going to pay you more.
[01:59:02.979 --> 01:59:03.340]  Amazing.
[01:59:03.619 --> 01:59:13.300]  Like, you're wondering why you've got the perspective of seeing these lazy, lazy workers at the UN and the benefits that they are making.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.819]  Like, how does that stick with you?
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:16.520]  I must hate it.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:19.600]  Well, I don't hate it, but, like, I hate both of you.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.560]  The UN finds a lot of squatters.
[01:59:34.199 --> 01:59:41.699]  Hey, this is Jeff with DMO Knives and we're proud to come back to you with our second partnership with Alex Jones.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:53.539]  The DMO Outback Alex Jones Edition is 10.5 inches in total length, 5.10 blade length, and 11.8 ounces in total weight.

[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:14.840]  Alex Jones signature on one side and the answer to 1984 is 1776 on the other.
[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:28.359]  This beautiful stone washed Outback starts as a piece of steel and we go through the grinding process, four steps of heat treatment, Among other things to get this out the door to you in your hands as an everyday carry.

[02:00:43.119 --> 02:00:44.880]  I would like to keep it as simple as possible.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:54.180]  So, at checkout, you have the option for this, which is a nice acrylic stand, really super easy to put together if you would just simply like to display your knife.

[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:26.619]  American made by American people right here at our workshop in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:29.319]  They are built to never fail the operator.
[02:01:51.039 --> 02:01:58.300]  Let's finish up with the major peacekeeper manager saying we want war to make money.
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:04.119]  And they just caught another, James O'Keefe did a few months ago, the head U.N. spokesperson saying, everybody hates us.
[02:02:04.619 --> 02:02:06.100]  95% of the world wants to get rid of us.
[02:02:06.199 --> 02:02:06.960]  We're total criminals.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:08.779]  We're a giant fraud.
[02:02:08.899 --> 02:02:10.979]  We just run around enslaving and robbing everybody.
[02:02:11.579 --> 02:02:12.720]  And now you got this.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.420]  Let's finish the clip.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:16.859]  In my opinion, like 90%.
[02:02:16.859 --> 02:02:17.539]  90%?
[02:02:17.939 --> 02:02:18.359]  90%.
[02:02:18.359 --> 02:02:20.180]  Wow.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:21.779]  For retirement, right?
[02:02:22.399 --> 02:02:24.119]  Like, pay attention.
[02:02:24.359 --> 02:02:25.880]  They're fixing their retirement.
[02:02:36.129 --> 02:02:42.670]  I mean, the UN does such great work otherwise.
[02:02:43.770 --> 02:02:44.869]  It's all right here, yeah.
[02:02:45.449 --> 02:02:45.850]  It doesn't?
[02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:47.409]  I think it could work better.
[02:02:47.970 --> 02:02:48.310]  How so?
[02:02:49.130 --> 02:02:51.310]  It's a bureaucracy and, like, it's...
[02:02:51.989 --> 02:02:53.229]  It's fairly inefficient.
[02:02:56.229 --> 02:03:01.210]  It's 190-some countries trying to negotiate.
[02:03:03.710 --> 02:03:06.770]  You can barely negotiate one person, let alone 194.
[02:03:07.630 --> 02:03:09.510]  And so everything just takes a lot longer.
[02:03:09.630 --> 02:03:12.890]  And you kind of look at right now, what's happening with the Middle East.
[02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:14.909]  And they just can't figure it out.
[02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:17.609]  It's a very archaic organization.
[02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:19.550]  Does the UN get involved in the politics?
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:20.840]  Uh, no.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:26.840]  Even as an employee, I'm not allowed to, like, campaign for anyone or have any protocol.
[02:03:27.239 --> 02:03:28.479]  Like, I think I can vote.
[02:03:28.939 --> 02:03:29.079]  Right.
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:29.979]  That's kind of where it ends.
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:32.000]  Why wouldn't they get involved?
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:34.840]  Because the whole notion is, what is an independent entity?
[02:03:35.199 --> 02:03:37.260]  And the people who work there are supposed to be a vote.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:38.199]  Hmm.
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:41.760]  And so, like, by virtue, your allegiance is now to the UN. Right.
[02:03:42.039 --> 02:03:45.100]  Um, not to your, your home country.
[02:03:45.359 --> 02:03:48.159]  But there must be some thoughts behind those doors.
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:49.979]  Who do you have to refer to?
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:55.700]  Yes.
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:04:01.760]  As an organization, there's nothing we've ever written about who the leadership prefers.
[02:04:01.979 --> 02:04:05.880]  So the UN definitely does not want Trump to be president, just like the rest of us.
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:08.760]  Just like half the country.
[02:04:09.939 --> 02:04:14.380]  What do you think of the whole, yeah, the primary thing?
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:21.979]  If the U.N. could pick who could be president, who's better for the U.N.? Or even like, I guess, like, what's her face?
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.600]  Because she was the ambassador to the U.N. Right.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.260]  Like, no something, I guess.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:33.560]  I was very proud of Nikki.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:34.340]  Really?
[02:04:34.539 --> 02:04:36.220]  Until she endorsed the outcome.
[02:04:37.279 --> 02:04:40.720]  The U.N. is not on the America First platform at all, obviously.
[02:04:46.819 --> 02:04:51.939]  The U.N. is not on the America First platform at all.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.300]  They're not anyone first.
[02:04:55.119 --> 02:04:56.319]  They're everyone equal.
[02:04:56.539 --> 02:04:57.439]  Everyone equal.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.640]  It's an amorphous body of nothingness.
[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:04.819]  The UN is an enormous body of nothingness.
[02:05:04.939 --> 02:05:08.680]  It's just like the CIA, a big robbery, a big pirate organization.
[02:05:08.979 --> 02:05:20.020]  So there's the UN, multiple people, you know, in the last month have been caught admitting this, high level, saying, we want Nikki Haley, we want war, we want to make money.
[02:05:20.739 --> 02:05:22.239]  What do you think Ukraine is?
[02:05:22.279 --> 02:05:26.939]  A giant black hole with hundreds and hundreds of billions and then probably a million people dead?
[02:05:28.829 --> 02:05:30.029]  That's what the new order is all about.
[02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.970]  Parasitic and evil.
[02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:31.970]  Let's go out to break.
[02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.930]  You know, there's not time now.
[02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:35.149]  I got Joe Rogan on something really big.
[02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:37.590]  General Flynn's coming up with the Joe Rogan thing first.
[02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:42.569]  We should just be so happy right now about RFK Jr.
[02:05:43.210 --> 02:05:46.489]  being the Health and Human Services Secretary pick.
[02:05:46.649 --> 02:05:48.850]  In fact, pull up the latest Moderna and Pfizer stock.
[02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.930]  I want to show this when we come back.
[02:05:50.130 --> 02:05:53.050]  They're all in free fall because this is real.
[02:05:53.250 --> 02:05:58.109]  The system knows this is real and their reign of terror against people is coming to an end.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:01.939]  And you're just going to see it everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:03.039 --> 02:06:10.479]  Folks just think they can act however they want in companies, bureaucracies, the UN, all this stuff, and we're not going to take it anymore.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:12.439]  We're not going to let you define us as the bad guys.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.220]  We're doing nothing.
[02:06:13.579 --> 02:06:22.300]  And then you're in all these globalist organizations raping the limit snot out of us, literally, figuratively, culturally, spiritually, intellectually, informationally.
[02:06:22.939 --> 02:06:26.399]  All right, General Flynn coming up with huge news and so much more.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:29.539]  We're entering the third and fourth hour later.
[02:06:29.979 --> 02:06:31.659]  Other big guests coming up as well.

[02:07:15.689 --> 02:07:16.729]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:21.109]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.

[02:07:24.409 --> 02:07:26.310]  And it goes on and on.
[02:07:26.489 --> 02:07:27.989]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[02:07:28.090 --> 02:07:29.149]  They're concentrated.
[02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:30.229]  They're incredible.

[02:08:02.779 --> 02:08:07.939]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:33.489]  Now there's a headline up on Infowars.com.
[02:08:34.850 --> 02:08:37.750]  Alex Jones to retain control of Infowars.
[02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:45.289]  And I have been told by multiple sources that there are criminal investigations about that that's being looked into.
[02:08:46.739 --> 02:08:49.920]  And the media has been calling around asking people about this.
[02:08:50.199 --> 02:08:55.020]  And I was hearing yesterday from people that, oh, people are pissed.
[02:08:56.619 --> 02:09:08.659]  Before I knew Elon Musk, lawyers were going to be at the hearing yesterday about the attempted impartial hijacking of Infowars, unlawfully, definitely exceeded their authority with what went on.
[02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:26.430]  I mean, I was getting, you know, calls about this, and high-powered people were saying, no, we hear this is, you know, this is going on, and this is going to happen, and Trump's pissed off, and then I heard Musk was pissed off, and then I'm told, I wouldn't at the hearing or anything,
[02:09:26.489 --> 02:09:46.090]  I'd later listen to it, and, you know, read some of the news, you know, clips about it, or I just had the crew tell me about it, but the point is, talked to my lawyers about it and all that stuff, and they Just are just flabbergasted about what's going on.
[02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:53.710]  And I didn't know that Elon Musk's lawyer was there and said, you're trying to take his social media like you've been trying.
[02:09:53.829 --> 02:09:54.109]  We're here.
[02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.949]  We're going to be at these hearings.
[02:09:55.090 --> 02:09:55.550]  It's not happening.
[02:09:56.210 --> 02:10:05.970]  And again, the law is 100% clear they can't take somebody's private social media handle and certainly can't get it and operate as that person as they said they wanted to do.
[02:10:06.090 --> 02:10:08.289]  I mean, they've said, we own your name, Alex Jones.
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:11.039]  And the judge already said no, and that couldn't be in the auction.
[02:10:11.159 --> 02:10:13.020]  He wanted future hearings on it before the auction.
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:18.840]  And they just had this fake auction that was a private secret sale masquerading as an auction.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.840]  Now, let me just say that's my opinion.
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:32.739]  And it was my opinion last night that I would be given InfoWars back and that we would be put back on the air because I could see what the judge said.
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.960]  I could read the news articles that had quotes of him.
[02:10:35.079 --> 02:10:36.439]  I could talk to my lawyers that were there.
[02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:41.430]  And he said this wasn't an auction, and we got to have a hearing on this.
[02:10:41.550 --> 02:10:44.189]  So if that wasn't an auction, they didn't get Infowars.
[02:10:44.529 --> 02:10:45.510]  Now, I'm not a lawyer.
[02:10:45.689 --> 02:10:46.329]  That's my opinion.
[02:10:46.489 --> 02:10:47.350]  Well, now that's admitted.
[02:10:48.630 --> 02:10:51.229]  So does that mean down the road something might happen?
[02:10:51.329 --> 02:10:53.649]  Does that mean the judge might just be sick of it and say, shut it down?
[02:10:53.729 --> 02:10:54.329]  That could even happen.
[02:10:55.489 --> 02:10:57.069]  Does it mean they're going to have another auction?
[02:10:57.649 --> 02:11:00.270]  Does it mean they're going to say, well, the real highest bidder got it?
[02:11:00.449 --> 02:11:02.770]  That's probably what everybody thinks should happen in the law.
[02:11:03.029 --> 02:11:03.689]  I don't know.
[02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:05.930]  That's my opinion of what might happen.
[02:11:09.970 --> 02:11:14.130]  You know, Chris Murray's, the trustee's lawyer was calling up my lawyers.
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:17.659]  And saying, oh, Jones is saying Chris Murray apologized to him.
[02:11:17.699 --> 02:11:18.239]  He didn't do that.
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:24.359]  I said a lot of stuff in the first hour on a teleprompter, and I haven't gone back and reviewed it, but that was not my intent either.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:32.340]  He said to me on the phone in front of Bob yesterday, and he told Bob, oh, I know I'm sorry this is a bummer or whatever, but no hard feelings.
[02:11:32.399 --> 02:11:34.100]  Not like, I'm sorry for what I did.
[02:11:34.399 --> 02:11:36.619]  I'm sorry this is a big hassle for you.
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.560]  I know no hard feelings.
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:38.739]  That's what I remember him saying.
[02:11:38.899 --> 02:11:39.819]  I got it recorded.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:42.039]  I mean, we'll see if that was exactly what was said.
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:46.119]  But that's what they're calling up about saying isn't true.
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:49.239]  Oh, okay, so did you...
[02:11:49.239 --> 02:11:51.000]  What else was wrong?
[02:11:51.079 --> 02:11:52.199]  Because you can come on, Chris Murray.
[02:11:52.399 --> 02:11:52.899]  I got your number.
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:53.380]  I can call you.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:54.000]  Would you like to come on?
[02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:54.979]  Right now.
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:55.939]  Come on the show.
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:56.600]  I mean, I mean that.
[02:11:57.319 --> 02:11:58.420]  I don't want to fight with you.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:02.060]  I said earlier, I said maybe you didn't know what you were doing.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:03.760]  Because that...
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.960]  Other people involved are now saying that.
[02:12:07.439 --> 02:12:08.800]  And I'm not going to say their names.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:12.000]  But you can probably imagine...
[02:12:15.330 --> 02:12:18.170]  And so everything I said is a piece of this, a piece of that.
[02:12:18.449 --> 02:12:24.449]  All the people I've talked to, in my view of what's most accurate, doesn't mean I'm God, doesn't mean everything I said is absolutely perfect.
[02:12:24.449 --> 02:12:25.069]  My opinion.
[02:12:26.409 --> 02:12:29.670]  My opinion last night, 1130, put up a video.
[02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:32.449]  You guys saying you got InfoWars.
[02:12:32.569 --> 02:12:34.189]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, in my opinion.
[02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:38.029]  The judge said the sale didn't go through, so I think I might get it back tomorrow or next week.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:40.819]  And I said, for a time.
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:42.279]  It happened this morning.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.500]  Was that my opinion last night?
[02:12:44.659 --> 02:12:46.420]  You bet it was my opinion last night.
[02:12:47.539 --> 02:12:49.300]  Is it my opinion at 11 a.m.
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:49.760]  this morning?
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:52.699]  Two hours ago?
[02:12:53.319 --> 02:12:53.720]  No.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:54.779]  It happened.
[02:12:55.859 --> 02:12:57.300]  So I'm going to explain this again.
[02:12:58.119 --> 02:13:01.760]  We get a call, and it's...
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.039]  Chris Murray, I apologize to you.
[02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:04.939]  And I start thinking about five minutes.
[02:13:05.079 --> 02:13:06.100]  I take air a tape.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:07.920]  I was going to air it anyway, but the UN... Let me think about that.
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:12.880]  I'm sorry, this shouldn't have happened.
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:17.020]  No, it was like, I'm sorry, I know this is horrible for you, but it's just the way it is.
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:21.079]  That's what I was relaying, and that happened.
[02:13:21.819 --> 02:13:25.859]  So, in my memory, and in front of the witness, who I talked to, he said, no, he did say that.
[02:13:26.119 --> 02:13:28.100]  I talked to the witness, that's basically what he said, yeah.
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:32.250]  So, see, That's what they're down to now, little things like that.
[02:13:32.489 --> 02:13:43.149]  So did you change the auction from being a regular auction where you can have higher bidders and stuff to a secret one two days before and then take a lower bid that was my money pledged in the future?
[02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:44.350]  Did you do that?
[02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.750]  Yeah.
[02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:48.390]  That's in the news now.
[02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:53.609]  So did the last federal...
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:58.800]  Trustee, order my building shut and us kicked out by armed security without a court order.
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:13:59.699]  Yeah.
[02:13:59.859 --> 02:14:01.159]  That come out in court later, like I said?
[02:14:01.399 --> 02:14:01.640]  Yeah.
[02:14:01.859 --> 02:14:03.079]  In June 14th?
[02:14:03.439 --> 02:14:04.819]  Did the judge fire those people?
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:05.279]  Yeah.
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:07.699]  Here, let's talk about what else went on.
[02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:17.579]  Did I talk to folks that say the word is there's a criminal investigation, it's being investigated now by some big people.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:20.319]  I wonder who is pissed off about this.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.109]  Gee, And has pledged to do something about this.
[02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:26.989]  And then I never said that on air yesterday.
[02:14:29.229 --> 02:14:32.010]  And then I start getting calls.
[02:14:33.329 --> 02:14:35.270]  Other lawyers start getting calls.
[02:14:36.329 --> 02:14:40.729]  They start calling my lawyer saying, hey, have you heard there's a criminal investigation?
[02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:52.710]  Because we got Bloomberg calling us up asking yesterday, last night, And then there's the Jedi mind trick.
[02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:54.050]  There is no criminal investigation.
[02:14:54.689 --> 02:14:56.869]  I just said, I hear that's going on.
[02:15:00.210 --> 02:15:02.409]  I mean, abracadabra, it doesn't exist.
[02:15:02.649 --> 02:15:03.949]  Okay, that's my opinion.
[02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.250]  No.
[02:15:05.890 --> 02:15:11.109]  It is my opinion that where there's smoke, there's fire, and that there should be a criminal investigation.
[02:15:11.609 --> 02:15:22.869]  And The judge said in the hearing on the 14th when he fired him, paraphrase, going from memory, but he said repeatedly over and over again, I told you you didn't have the authority to do this.
[02:15:24.529 --> 02:15:31.729]  I'm not going to say you violated bankruptcy law, but you better explain why you did this.
[02:15:32.289 --> 02:15:34.529]  You better explain how you could do this.
[02:15:36.449 --> 02:15:41.210]  So that's a real nice way of a judge saying that to a bunch of other people.
[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:47.279]  So, I know this stuff's hard to follow for even people that study it.
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:49.319]  Believe me, it gives me a headache.
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.920]  But all I know is I've been told to get out of a building with no court order.
[02:15:54.699 --> 02:15:59.260]  All I know is I was kicked out of there and it was clearly not a real auction.
[02:15:59.380 --> 02:15:59.920]  I said that yesterday.
[02:16:00.039 --> 02:16:00.960]  I don't think this is a real auction.
[02:16:01.279 --> 02:16:05.119]  Now the judge says, hours later, he said, quote, this is not an auction.
[02:16:05.539 --> 02:16:08.260]  He said, quote, I'm going to remember, but it's basically exactly...
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:12.739]  An auction is where you have it public and people can bid up.
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.979]  The judge actually was giving you the definition.
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:16.539]  Let's put Webster definition back on screen.
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:20.640]  Now, I said all that yesterday.
[02:16:22.039 --> 02:16:23.279]  That was my opinion.
[02:16:23.479 --> 02:16:24.939]  Today, it's happening.
[02:16:25.659 --> 02:16:29.119]  Auction, noun, a sale of property to the highest bidder.
[02:16:29.939 --> 02:16:31.720]  Webster, Merriam-Webster.
[02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:42.989]  So, it's my opinion yesterday that the judge would say this was not a real auction, and that's when I didn't even know how bad it was.
[02:16:43.989 --> 02:16:45.170]  Let's get General Flynn on.
[02:16:48.069 --> 02:16:50.370]  All right, moving off of this for a moment.
[02:16:51.790 --> 02:17:00.989]  Joe Rogan made a great point in a recent podcast that This phenomenon where people are scared to say they publicly support Trump, but he has way bigger support than is admitted.
[02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:07.649]  They've done big studies, and it's something like 10-15% more, depending on the study, support Trump than what will say it publicly, but they'll still vote for him or support him.
[02:17:08.569 --> 02:17:13.209]  And it was those people that don't usually vote that pushed him over the top, and that's what Charlie Kirk's talked about.
[02:17:14.409 --> 02:17:26.149]  Of the great folks at TPUSA, instead of targeting the suburban moms that are hard to get to wake up and their Stockholm Syndrome, they just went after people that hadn't voted that were Hispanic, black, or white.
[02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:29.389]  Men and women in just regular areas.
[02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:35.690]  Don't go off the target maps they've got of where the leftist women are and try to turn them around and try to get them to wake up.
[02:17:35.909 --> 02:17:39.090]  No, you just go after people that have been given up and are out of the game.
[02:17:39.170 --> 02:17:40.569]  You give them hope and you bring them in.
[02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:42.309]  And that was an incredible thing.
[02:17:44.079 --> 02:17:46.120]  So, people better find their courage.
[02:17:47.059 --> 02:17:50.680]  I mean, I know for a fact, George Strait is a super patriot, super smart.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:55.319]  I've talked to his band, Ace in the Hole, over the years.
[02:17:55.479 --> 02:17:57.739]  They have their own separate band called Ace in the Hole, but that's who plays his music.
[02:17:57.959 --> 02:17:59.479]  And I didn't single out him.
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:01.540]  I just said he's an example.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.180]  George Strait needs to come out for Trump.
[02:18:03.299 --> 02:18:04.120]  This country's on the line.
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:05.159]  World War III's on the line.
[02:18:05.659 --> 02:18:06.520]  Sylvester Stallone did.
[02:18:06.959 --> 02:18:08.159]  Got a clip of that coming up.
[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:08.920]  Really powerful.
[02:18:10.559 --> 02:18:13.540]  So, I mean, this is the time to be all in.
[02:18:13.639 --> 02:18:18.540]  And I'm not mad at people like George Strait.
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.280]  I just wish that he'd gone all the way.
[02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:25.860]  Like Sylvester Stallone or General Flynn or other heroes.
[02:18:26.379 --> 02:18:28.299]  Here's a clip of Rogan, then we're going to get General Flynn on.
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:31.879]  There's a lot of people that don't speak their mind.
[02:18:32.079 --> 02:18:33.600]  Do you know how many artists...
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:37.239]  That have reached out to me that are like fucking hippies, man.
[02:18:37.459 --> 02:18:46.959]  Like artists, like musicians, comedians, that thanked me for endorsing Trump because they can't do it.
[02:18:47.139 --> 02:18:49.879]  They said they want to, but they don't want to be attacked.
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:51.000]  They can't say it.
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:53.420]  They think the country's going in the wrong direction.
[02:18:53.420 --> 02:19:06.520]  They think that this control of social media by the government, which we would have had pretty much fully if it wasn't for Elon buying Twitter, that this is a dangerous precedent to set, whether it's a right-wing government or a left-wing government.
[02:19:06.639 --> 02:19:12.620]  And that what you see that's happening in the UK where people are being imprisoned for tweets and Facebook posts is fucking crazy.
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:16.299]  Yeah, and the UK is the part that's mind-bending about it to me.
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:16.780]  Mind-bending.
[02:19:16.819 --> 02:19:21.959]  The whole thing is nuts, and it's a dangerous path that we were on.
[02:19:22.139 --> 02:19:23.340]  We were on that path.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:40.940]  Trump has vowed to have free speech become a very important part of what he's standing for, and that this censoring of information needs to stop, and that we need to stop all government influence in what people have to say.
[02:19:41.149 --> 02:19:41.610]  Yeah, look.
[02:19:41.829 --> 02:19:42.469]  That alone.
[02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:46.450]  That shouldn't be as revolutionary as it is.
[02:19:46.530 --> 02:19:46.809]  I know.
[02:19:46.909 --> 02:19:48.549]  It should be a core tenet of what...
[02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:49.989]  I mean, it's essentially the First Amendment.
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:53.180]  All right, so there is Joe Rogan.
[02:19:53.299 --> 02:19:54.260]  We've got General Flynn with us.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:55.159]  He's very gracious.
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:20:00.540]  He always, you know, commands a huge audience, but he came on with us three or four times last week.
[02:20:00.719 --> 02:20:05.399]  Over, conservatively, 150 million views on X. Everywhere else, just key info.
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:06.360]  It really broke through.
[02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:08.319]  I know he advises President Trump.
[02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:10.780]  We're so blessed to have him, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:13.340]  We haven't talked to him now in almost a week.
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:20.200]  Updates on Trump, updates on what the globalists are up to, what we should be watching for, what we should be expecting.
[02:20:21.229 --> 02:20:22.930]  Just to get an update from him is so amazing.
[02:20:23.350 --> 02:20:25.329]  And we're also going to put his website on screen.
[02:20:25.649 --> 02:20:26.950]  Such amazing information there.
[02:20:27.389 --> 02:20:29.010]  They're still trying to steal Pennsylvania.
[02:20:29.290 --> 02:20:36.290]  They're illegally voting and letting illegals vote and counting them in violation of federal and state laws and Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling.
[02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:39.729]  So this is an amazing time where the truth is being forced out in the open.
[02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:40.469]  And then you have...
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:49.079]  The hijacking of Infowars, a fake auction that was a secret sale that wasn't even a sale, and now they're saying, okay, go back to your studios.
[02:20:49.219 --> 02:20:49.860]  Go back on air.
[02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:50.680]  You're right.
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.979]  The judge is, quote, pissed, according to Bloomberg, and just incredible things.
[02:20:56.079 --> 02:20:57.260]  And I'm told Trump's really mad.
[02:20:57.420 --> 02:20:57.879]  Elon's mad.
[02:20:57.920 --> 02:20:58.739]  I was told that in the morning.
[02:20:59.059 --> 02:21:00.159]  In fact, I was chewed out.
[02:21:00.299 --> 02:21:01.459]  Like, somehow I went along with this.
[02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:02.020]  I didn't.
[02:21:02.559 --> 02:21:13.780]  And then Elon's people, I was told Elon's, you know, he's going to be very involved in this, Elon's lawyer, One of them was at the hearing saying this is BS. So the cavalry's here.
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:14.620]  Trump's pissed.
[02:21:15.239 --> 02:21:21.520]  General Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former National Security Advisor, President Trump, thank you for graciously giving us an update.
[02:21:21.620 --> 02:21:24.260]  I'm trying to give you the floor to go wherever you want, sir, with a limited time.
[02:21:26.059 --> 02:21:31.079]  Yeah, so Alex, first of all, thanks for having me on and let me come back on to your great audience.
[02:21:31.479 --> 02:21:47.049]  You know, everything that is happening, I think what people need to understand I've had so many people in the last probably six months, if not the last three months,
[02:21:47.129 --> 02:21:52.850]  that have come up to me, people that I've known a long time, whispered in my ear and said, I'm voting for Trump.
[02:21:53.069 --> 02:21:56.629]  I can't talk about it, but I'm letting you know I'm voting for Trump.
[02:21:56.750 --> 02:22:07.139]  So let's just get that Sort of off the table because that is one of the big, big reasons why Trump got such a mandate.
[02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:17.719]  It's, you know, it's his hard work and dedication to getting out there for the last, you know, certainly the last 60 days every day, multiple times a day at rallies and such.
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:22.379]  All the stuff that a lot of our different grassroots organizations have done over the last...
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:35.659]  We're good to go.
[02:22:36.379 --> 02:22:45.079]  And, you know, it's metaphorically, because the left will go bananas, and they'll think, you know, that I'm trying to, you know, create something that I'm not actually talking about.
[02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:54.079]  We are in an information-dominant type of war right now, where the narrative—and frankly, we own this narrative.
[02:22:54.079 --> 02:23:07.260]  We stole the narrative back from this enemy and this opposing force— And now what they're trying to do, whatever the games are, I was watching you some yesterday, and I'm thinking, something's not right about this.
[02:23:07.399 --> 02:23:17.299]  And lo and behold, it turns out that it wasn't right, because I just felt like I'm somewhat familiar with the way they do these types of things.
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:20.540]  So anyway, where are we going forward, right?
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.860]  So there are going to be what they call fits and starts, right?
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:26.620]  Fits and starts.
[02:23:26.799 --> 02:23:36.040]  On the battlefield, you know, when you develop these great plans, and then you cross the line of departure, which we've already started to do.
[02:23:36.219 --> 02:23:37.659]  So troops have landed.
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:41.200]  We're bringing in reinforcements, but we've crossed the line of departure.
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:44.420]  We're up into the I used the Normandy invasion the other day.
[02:23:44.559 --> 02:23:45.920]  We're up into the hedgerows right now.
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:47.239]  We're breaking out of the hedgerows.
[02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:51.059]  In this case, we got this metaphor.
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:52.879]  We got the Germans on their heels a little bit.
[02:23:53.159 --> 02:23:55.239]  They don't know which direction we're going to come from.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:05.159]  Trump is really being, I think, very masterful in the deployment of those people that he is choosing to lead some of the forces forward, right?
[02:24:05.379 --> 02:24:13.260]  But I want to remind everybody, I want to remind the American people, the millions and millions of people, One man cannot do this alone.
[02:24:13.559 --> 02:24:14.959]  Donald Trump cannot do this alone.
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:17.340]  He's going to put together a great team of people.
[02:24:17.559 --> 02:24:18.620]  He's not done yet.
[02:24:19.059 --> 02:24:22.500]  You know, below that team of people, there's going to be another thousand or so.
[02:24:22.959 --> 02:24:29.379]  Although, frankly, I do not believe that they need as many people as they typically, conventionally need to hire.
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:30.680]  I don't believe we need that.
[02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:42.850]  In fact, I believe what we do need is go with a much smaller, a much leaner footprint, and then get into these organizations like Elon and Vivek, In this doge are doing, right?
[02:24:43.049 --> 02:24:48.350]  So this government effectiveness task force that is going to be so crucial.
[02:24:48.629 --> 02:24:59.520]  And I do think that There has to be decisions on the minute one, not just day one, but minute one going forward after the inauguration.
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:02.100]  So let me just take this in phases, if you don't mind.
[02:25:02.319 --> 02:25:05.200]  So we've already completed phase one, which was the election.
[02:25:05.379 --> 02:25:06.100]  Win the election.
[02:25:06.379 --> 02:25:11.280]  Now we're into phase two, which is basically this transitionary period of time.
[02:25:11.459 --> 02:25:13.780]  And there's going to be a lot of problems.
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:16.479]  We are going to be attacked constantly.
[02:25:16.479 --> 02:25:17.639]  We're going to be probed.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:21.020]  There's going to be people inside of these different camps, right?
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:23.799]  Inside of the Trump transition camp, there's going to be leaks.
[02:25:25.979 --> 02:25:33.719]  Just like in warfare, you have these opposing forces, and they're trying to continue to defeat each other.
[02:25:33.879 --> 02:25:35.760]  This is not times as normal.
[02:25:36.049 --> 02:25:52.909]  Back underneath the 2016-2017 timeframe when Trump defeated Hillary and we moved into the Obama transition period, Obama, he hired around 2,500 people that were moved from government-appointed positions,
[02:25:52.969 --> 02:25:59.750]  many of them, over into government servant positions to undermine and usurp The presidency of Donald Trump.
[02:25:59.950 --> 02:26:06.149]  I have already been told by a close friend in one of the major departments that this is already beginning.
[02:26:06.329 --> 02:26:09.549]  And I've called for Speaker Johnson and I've called for others.
[02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:11.649]  We should have a hiring freeze.
[02:26:11.889 --> 02:26:23.489]  And if they don't do a hiring freeze, then everybody that is hired or brought in or some personnel shift between the 5th of November and the inauguration day, those people ought to be told, thank you for your service.
[02:26:23.629 --> 02:26:24.590]  You're on your way out the door.
[02:26:24.889 --> 02:26:26.069]  And don't let it hit you.
[02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:31.629]  You might even want to go even further back, because these people are shrewd in how they plan.
[02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:33.909]  So this is phase two transition.
[02:26:34.270 --> 02:26:37.469]  There's going to be some bumps.
[02:26:37.850 --> 02:26:39.729]  Trump is going to experience some bumps.
[02:26:39.809 --> 02:26:43.909]  But don't let those bumps stop our forward momentum.
[02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:46.790]  So I want people to understand, we've broken through the hedgerows.
[02:26:46.889 --> 02:26:51.829]  We're going to push these guys back, but we cannot declare victory over Europe just yet.
[02:26:51.829 --> 02:26:54.889]  I love the fact that Trump is operating out of Mar-a-Lago.
[02:26:55.290 --> 02:27:02.469]  The fact that he's operating on a monologue, personally for me, makes me feel better for his own security.
[02:27:02.850 --> 02:27:11.329]  Because there will be people, there will be structures that are going to be out there that are going to be looking to take this man out.
[02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:12.629]  And I mean that.
[02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:16.149]  I don't have anything off the top of my head that I'm aware of.
[02:27:16.229 --> 02:27:18.950]  If I did, that would be immediately possible.
[02:27:19.970 --> 02:27:25.110]  Reported and gotten to the right folks, but they've tried it before.
[02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:37.799]  You know, the one guy, this is why I keep telling the American people, we can't You know, we can't just stop and go, okay, we got him elected, you know, let him pick his team and let him get in there and govern.
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:38.239]  No.
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:41.459]  We have to keep our voices moving.
[02:27:41.579 --> 02:27:43.639]  We have to keep the momentum moving.
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:57.399]  We have to keep this forward movement with our narrative, you know, the The information narrowed that we have stolen back, we have taken control of from the mainstream corporate woke media.
[02:27:57.659 --> 02:28:00.920]  They are collapsing as I speak right now.
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:02.120]  That's very important.
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:12.860]  The third phase, so this transitory phase, I call it phase two, you know, we're going to go through this period, like I said, It's like a boxing match.
[02:28:13.139 --> 02:28:18.600]  We might have to change position and go from one side to another here, if nothing else.
[02:28:18.719 --> 02:28:21.280]  But there's going to be some...
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:27.299]  And there may even be some sacrifices on some of the people that do come in that have to find themselves.
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:36.059]  Because this is one of these very difficult times, and you start to pick people, and all of a sudden somebody goes, well, we didn't quite tell you the whole story.
[02:28:36.649 --> 02:28:38.530]  And so, somebody falls out.
[02:28:38.729 --> 02:28:44.250]  There are going to have to be a wide net, like net fishing, right?
[02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:52.670]  The net fishing around this country of people who love, deeply love this country, who are experts in various capabilities.
[02:28:52.930 --> 02:29:01.069]  We do not want to go to Washington, D.C. and keep plucking from Washington, D.C. just because they happen to live there.
[02:29:01.209 --> 02:29:01.430]  No.
[02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:10.510]  We're going to have to go around this country, get the best of the best, those people that want to serve, Ask them to come into government and then help them transition.
[02:29:10.729 --> 02:29:13.229]  As a military guy, I've served all over the place.
[02:29:13.350 --> 02:29:15.309]  I know what moving requires.
[02:29:15.489 --> 02:29:18.149]  I know you got to go to this duty station or that duty station.
[02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:24.829]  For the American people that are listening to this broadcast today, I want you to understand that, you know, be prepared.
[02:29:24.829 --> 02:29:37.889]  If somebody reaches into you and says, hey, look, we'd like to have you come and serve as an assistant something or an undersecretary of something because you have an expertise and we've heard you, we've seen you, we've gotten to know you, you're going to have to be prepared to pick up and move.
[02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:41.250]  That all by itself is an essential task.
[02:29:41.729 --> 02:29:50.950]  And by the way, General, I know a lot of prominent people in business, but also other folks who are patriots and in the Justice Department, you name it, they're being tapped right now by Trump.
[02:29:51.069 --> 02:29:54.649]  I mean, I know people that are like, wow, they've been watching what I've been doing for years.
[02:29:54.829 --> 02:29:58.969]  I mean, Santa Claus has been making a good list and not just a naughty list.
[02:30:00.130 --> 02:30:00.530]  Exactly.
[02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:01.010]  Exactly.
[02:30:01.309 --> 02:30:08.489]  So let's pray for the security and protection of Trump as he goes through this very challenging period of time.
[02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:10.549]  He's already been through this one time.
[02:30:10.729 --> 02:30:17.370]  So, you know, like I said in an article I wrote the other day about where I talked about Obama and I said, you know, Obama fooled us once.
[02:30:17.489 --> 02:30:18.049]  Shame on us.
[02:30:18.170 --> 02:30:19.350]  He's not going to fool us again.
[02:30:19.549 --> 02:30:21.250]  General, General, please stay right there.
[02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:23.090]  Do a few more minutes with us when we come back.
[02:30:23.409 --> 02:30:25.250]  I've got a few other key questions for you.
[02:30:25.409 --> 02:30:26.090]  Please stay with us.
[02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:27.229]  General Flynn will be right back.
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:43.940]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:56.479]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[02:30:56.639 --> 02:30:58.319]  They are a private agency.
[02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:02.819]  Some of the president-elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:05.600]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[02:31:05.959 --> 02:31:06.379]  No.
[02:31:07.579 --> 02:31:13.120]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[02:31:13.479 --> 02:31:13.799]  No.
[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:34.319]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[02:31:34.479 --> 02:31:38.959]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration.
[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:46.360]  We're good to go.
[02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:55.420]  We're good to go.
[02:31:55.450 --> 02:31:58.549]  At the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[02:31:58.829 --> 02:32:05.909]  Now, in closing here, InfoWars is set to be sold at auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[02:32:06.049 --> 02:32:08.750]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[02:32:08.909 --> 02:32:11.209]  But regardless, backups are being set up.
[02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:13.569]  New systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[02:32:13.809 --> 02:32:22.889]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[02:32:23.989 --> 02:32:29.850]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[02:32:30.129 --> 02:32:40.409]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition, that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:41.530]  Here it is on screen.
[02:32:42.149 --> 02:32:42.709]  Iconic.
[02:32:42.909 --> 02:32:53.229]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[02:32:53.969 --> 02:33:04.969]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:11.450]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with...
[02:33:12.100 --> 02:33:14.739]  Three simple words at the bottom.
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:16.799]  Back to back to back.
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:17.799]  That's right.
[02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:20.940]  He's the only president to ever run three times.
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:25.680]  And he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[02:33:25.899 --> 02:33:26.819]  He won in 16.
[02:33:26.819 --> 02:33:27.799]  He won in...
[02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:36.670]  We've won the battle.
[02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:40.010]  Now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[02:33:40.149 --> 02:33:46.299]  And to do that he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:51.600]  The most reach we've ever had, thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:56.379]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:10.020]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get the Trump Patriot apparel, get the posters, there's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[02:34:10.319 --> 02:34:12.899]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[02:34:13.079 --> 02:34:14.120]  Thanks for your support.
[02:34:14.319 --> 02:34:15.600]  God bless and good luck.
[02:34:15.819 --> 02:34:19.819]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[02:34:20.059 --> 02:34:20.739]  Thank you so much.
[02:34:57.079 --> 02:35:03.280]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, the Alex Jones Network tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:05.799]  You're listening to Alex Jones Live.
[02:35:17.249 --> 02:35:19.209]  So I said, fine, we're going to our backup.
[02:35:19.430 --> 02:35:20.170]  This is wrong.
[02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:21.030]  I believe this is illegal.
[02:35:21.209 --> 02:35:22.409]  I believe the judge will overturn this.
[02:35:22.569 --> 02:35:25.770]  The judge had an emergency hearing, said, yeah, the sale didn't go through.
[02:35:25.989 --> 02:35:27.750]  The media is not reporting on that.
[02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:33.430]  The judge said that he halted the sale, but not that all the other stuff he said in the hearing.
[02:35:34.209 --> 02:35:35.850]  And so the studios are back.
[02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:37.149]  We've been told they're ours for now.
[02:35:37.489 --> 02:35:38.629]  I'll be leaving here.
[02:35:39.479 --> 02:35:47.120]  At 3 o'clock from these studios going back to the InfoWars studio to do an emergency broadcast on all this and so much more.
[02:35:47.979 --> 02:35:53.239]  And it is my view that this was absolutely unlawful.
[02:35:53.879 --> 02:35:57.440]  And everything I said yesterday has now been proven today.
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:36:01.200]  What I'm saying about what's happening today is my opinion, but we'll see what happens tomorrow.
[02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:03.799]  But I said last night, look, we're going to be back at InfoWars.
[02:36:03.979 --> 02:36:04.959]  You're going to look like fools.
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:08.200]  And the corporate media does not even know what to do.
[02:36:08.299 --> 02:36:10.979]  And as General Flynn just said, he's only got a few minutes left, about seven, eight minutes left.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:12.520]  Very busy man.
[02:36:13.079 --> 02:36:14.479]  He said, we have the initiative.
[02:36:14.879 --> 02:36:17.020]  We've taken the narrative back from the liars.
[02:36:17.139 --> 02:36:17.760]  We have the truth.
[02:36:18.239 --> 02:36:19.500]  Global realignment, it's there.
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:20.079]  They admit it.
[02:36:22.559 --> 02:36:23.959]  Yeah.
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:32.840]  Yeah.
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:44.360]  What we can do, but we really shouldn't be second-guessing Trump.
[02:36:44.579 --> 02:36:45.360]  We know he's for real.
[02:36:45.559 --> 02:36:52.600]  They're going to try to get us to attack Trump, to think he's not real, but we've got to get him time to get in there, and all I'm seeing is good signs, General.
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:55.379]  Yeah, it's very good signs.
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:37:02.399]  I want people to remember that the globalists, they are not done trying to achieve their objective, okay?
[02:37:04.019 --> 02:37:11.719]  Again, 2016, Trump got in the way in a big way, and everybody figured out he was done after 2020, and he came back, right?
[02:37:12.239 --> 02:37:14.559]  I think you just showed it, the back-to-back-to-back.
[02:37:14.659 --> 02:37:15.120]  I love it.
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:19.379]  So we won this past week.
[02:37:19.579 --> 02:37:20.219]  We're winning.
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:21.879]  I want people to understand that we are winning.
[02:37:21.979 --> 02:37:22.959]  We got them on their heels.
[02:37:23.139 --> 02:37:24.799]  They don't know quite how to act.
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:27.719]  So they're a little bit frantic.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:31.260]  They get their minions like the Mike Pence's out there.
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:39.000]  There's also going to be other, you know, there's going to be other sort of sheep in wolf's clothing that are on the Republican side.
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:41.979]  And, you know, the Democrats, we know their game plan.
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:43.899]  It's the globalist game plan.
[02:37:44.159 --> 02:37:46.799]  You're going to have sort of the Republican establishment.
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:49.620]  Got to be very careful about the smiling, right?
[02:37:49.719 --> 02:37:51.059]  The smiling assassins, right?
[02:37:51.459 --> 02:37:53.000]  So we're in phases.
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:55.860]  The phase that we're in right now is the transition phase.
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:38:05.659]  I can tell you, as a matter of fact, transition on the battlefield, on the physical battlefield, is the most difficult operation to conduct.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:19.799]  So politically, we are in a very difficult transition with an adversarial government bureaucracy, fourth estate, you can call it, whatever you want to call it.
[02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:28.030]  But it is a body of people that do not see eye to eye with this president-elect's, again, agenda.
[02:38:28.229 --> 02:38:30.850]  And they are going to try to thwart it at all levels.
[02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:34.590]  Now, the next thing is the people that Trump is choosing.
[02:38:34.850 --> 02:38:43.889]  And Trump is clearly not just choosing for now, but it's the way you kind of talk about how you do the news, Alex, on your network.
[02:38:44.049 --> 02:38:45.870]  You always talk about what's going to happen.
[02:38:46.069 --> 02:38:55.190]  So one of the things that I believe that Trump is projecting in these picks is a youthfulness to a degree that also projects us into the future.
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:12.979]  So he is preparing a battlefield, not just for now to take this globalist cabal on and reshape and re-correct our government and get our country back on the rails, but he's also starting to really go into the youth movement of our talent.
[02:39:13.159 --> 02:39:18.600]  And I do think that we're going to see people that have never served in government that are going to be serving in government.
[02:39:19.059 --> 02:39:20.120]  I'm all for that.
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:27.680]  We need fresh ideas, fresh faces, and fresh, innovative solutions for the kinds of things that we have.
[02:39:27.879 --> 02:39:35.879]  The next big phase, though, and this is where I'll kind of end it with you guys and your great audience today, Alex, is execution, right?
[02:39:36.139 --> 02:39:36.579]  Execution.
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:38.920]  So we got up on the...
[02:39:39.479 --> 02:39:42.899]  On the beaches of Normandy, we've broken through the hedgerows.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.340]  We've got the enemy a little bit on their heels.
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:46.739]  They are going to reform.
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:51.299]  They're going to try to do some fancy things to us.
[02:39:52.239 --> 02:39:55.180]  We're about to have the battle of the bulge.
[02:39:56.579 --> 02:39:57.340]  Big time.
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:39:57.899]  Big time.
[02:39:58.059 --> 02:40:05.149]  And so what we're going to move into is we're going to move into an execution phase But we're going to have to get our forces together.
[02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:18.969]  And this is where the people that are being chosen to lead these various organizations, they have to form as one entity, and they have to follow the lead of President Donald J. Trump and follow that agenda.
[02:40:19.229 --> 02:40:21.549]  We can't have these people taking these big jobs.
[02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:34.959]  These are big jobs, large organizations, lots of resources, We can't have them going and isolating themselves because when they begin to isolate them, believe me, the bureaucracy will surround them with security.
[02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:35.799]  I said this earlier.
[02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:37.440]  They'll surround them with security.
[02:40:37.559 --> 02:40:39.719]  They'll pile on the briefings.
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:42.639]  They'll tell them everything you can and can't do, particularly.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:48.840]  And next thing you know, the person wakes up and they're 30, 60, 90 days into the job and they haven't accomplished anything yet.
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.319]  So we've got to be careful not to be isolated.
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:56.180]  The people that are being chosen by Trump, they're going to have to constantly work together.
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:02.360]  And this is really where, you know, the leader in this case, Donald J. Trump, he has mastered this.
[02:41:02.479 --> 02:41:11.620]  I really see such an important change in his mentality and his ideas, the videos that he's putting out, the types of messaging that he is doing.
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:17.139]  The decisions he's making is showing he is battle-hardened and super-seasoned.
[02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:18.579]  Exactly.
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:31.040]  I mean, this is a George C. Marshall moment where George C. Marshall was an aide to Pershing during World War I as a colonel, and then he went through years of watching things and learning.
[02:41:31.219 --> 02:41:38.360]  And when he was put in charge of the entire war effort, right— He knew exactly what needed to be done.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:40.899]  And there was, again, there were some fits and starts.
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:42.180]  There were some tough times.
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:43.139]  There were some tough moments.
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:48.639]  But here we are, and we've got the best leader in what I call this arc of history.
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:55.139]  And had we not gotten this election right, we would have basically, it would have been existential to our country.
[02:41:55.579 --> 02:41:59.399]  We were in an existential moment had we not won that victory.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:04.020]  And now what we have to do is we have to take advantage of it.
[02:42:04.079 --> 02:42:08.040]  And like I keep saying, you never just attack, you never just seize the objective.
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.700]  You fight through the objective.
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:22.860]  And so right now, we the people, your audience, those influencers out there, those big-name people that are not in the government just yet, everybody's got to Stand your toes.
[02:42:23.079 --> 02:42:24.180]  Keep moving forward.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:25.659]  Keep the narrative alive.
[02:42:26.219 --> 02:42:38.200]  Help the analysis of what is happening by people like Elon, by people like Vivek, by people like Bobby Kennedy, and by Tulsi Gabbard, by these other people that are being chosen for the administration.
[02:42:38.559 --> 02:42:40.100]  They cannot do this alone.
[02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:53.559]  They know that they have to coalesce together as one team, because any of them that goes off on their own and thinks they can do it on their own, The deep state, the bureaucratic state will isolate them and then destroy them.
[02:42:53.799 --> 02:42:54.979]  And that's what will happen.
[02:42:55.100 --> 02:42:56.260]  And I've been through that.
[02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:58.139]  And I don't want that to happen.
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:01.340]  I want us to succeed, but it's not going to be easy.
[02:43:01.639 --> 02:43:03.940]  So you're saying God's given us the ball.
[02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:06.319]  And of course, they tried to isolate Trump.
[02:43:06.399 --> 02:43:07.399]  They tried to isolate you.
[02:43:07.559 --> 02:43:10.899]  And then by the end, they all just deserted him and no one was even there except you.
[02:43:11.379 --> 02:43:14.440]  Literally those last days, you know, you were even out of the administration coming to warn him.
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:18.500]  And they were taking executive orders he would sign and throw them in the trash can.
[02:43:18.579 --> 02:43:22.459]  But he's wise to them now, as he said in his speeches, and we're seeing it.
[02:43:22.899 --> 02:43:24.600]  General Flynn, thank you for the time.
[02:43:24.639 --> 02:43:27.360]  Everybody should follow you on X. We'll put your URL up there.
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:29.799]  Everybody should get your books on fifth generational warfare.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:35.879]  The work you're doing, building the runway for this victory is so incredible.
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:38.040]  We've secured the House, the Senate.
[02:43:38.239 --> 02:43:39.299]  We've got the executive.
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:40.840]  We've got the judicial.
[02:43:41.079 --> 02:43:42.299]  God has handed us the ball.
[02:43:42.559 --> 02:43:43.959]  Thank you so much, General Flynn.
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:45.979]  God bless, Alex.
[02:43:46.139 --> 02:43:46.879]  Thank you, and good luck.
[02:43:47.139 --> 02:43:47.680]  Thank you, sir.
[02:43:48.399 --> 02:43:48.719]  All right.
[02:43:51.479 --> 02:43:58.700]  He talks about this time and Trump really being a mythological figure.
[02:43:59.639 --> 02:44:06.420]  By the time he was in, who he was, the fact that he's strong, the fact that he is extremely stubborn.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:10.180]  I mean, Scott, mom's Scott, the dad's German.
[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:14.159]  I mean, the guy is just stubborn as the day is long.
[02:44:15.069 --> 02:44:17.049]  And that's a good point and a bad point sometimes.
[02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:18.870]  But that's why they don't like him.
[02:44:18.989 --> 02:44:21.389]  And he's not out to get people and he wants prosperity and peace.
[02:44:21.790 --> 02:44:23.069]  He likes his grandchildren.
[02:44:23.229 --> 02:44:23.909]  He likes your children.
[02:44:24.049 --> 02:44:25.170]  He likes having a future.
[02:44:25.850 --> 02:44:33.530]  And he thought he could just come turn the country around and let the establishment stay in and get them even richer, which they got even richer when he was in.
[02:44:33.610 --> 02:44:34.229]  But they didn't want that.
[02:44:34.290 --> 02:44:37.270]  They wanted power over people.
[02:44:38.149 --> 02:44:42.110]  And I've known folks that have known Sylvester Stallone for a long time.
[02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:44.129]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:44:44.290 --> 02:44:46.909]  I had a chance a few times to work out at his private gym.
[02:44:47.149 --> 02:44:52.110]  Very nice, very gracious person in LA back when I was doing some shows and movies there.
[02:44:52.530 --> 02:44:55.030]  Gosh, that's got to be 15 years ago or so.
[02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:57.690]  And he's just a real patriot.
[02:44:58.469 --> 02:45:01.850]  And has just always been Americana all the way.
[02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:08.149]  And he saw what was happening and left California for Florida and has really been, you know, supporting Trump.
[02:45:08.350 --> 02:45:12.809]  And he's the example of people saying, hey, I'm all in for America.
[02:45:12.809 --> 02:45:13.909]  I don't care if you attack me.
[02:45:13.989 --> 02:45:14.889]  I don't care if you demonize me.
[02:45:15.459 --> 02:45:16.639]  And, you know, I love Willie Nelson.
[02:45:16.899 --> 02:45:18.979]  You've been friends with him, spent a lot of time with him.
[02:45:19.059 --> 02:45:25.100]  But, you know, Willie really believes liberal BS. And he's just been out of his, you know, been over the hill for at least a decade.
[02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:27.020]  Willie Nelson I knew when he was 75.
[02:45:27.020 --> 02:45:28.299]  It's not the Willie Nelson's day.
[02:45:28.479 --> 02:45:29.620]  Obviously, they just wheel him around.
[02:45:30.180 --> 02:45:37.159]  But I'm less mad at Willie Nelson as I am at other iconic Texans I know that I know are listeners.
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:42.639]  And they will not do anything publicly because they want to stay out of a fight.
[02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:43.760]  Well, the fights come for you.
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:46.719]  And I single out George Strait for that.
[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:48.799]  Just to say, you know, I love George Strait.
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:49.399]  God, I love him.
[02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:50.719]  But look at this.
[02:45:50.799 --> 02:45:53.879]  I mean, he says he's retired, but he still has occasional concerts.
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:57.299]  And I've been to a lot of George Strait concerts since I was like 12 years old.
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:45:58.559]  Probably been to 15 of them.
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:00.520]  Right when he got big, I was listening to him.
[02:46:00.579 --> 02:46:02.120]  And I'm just like, no, we're not going to see George Strait.
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:07.940]  And it's not that I'm mad at George Strait with American flags, give money to veterans, and all this rah, rah, rah stuff.
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:15.290]  It's just that it gets me too upset To know that we're losing everything here.
[02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:16.750]  So I'm not singling him out.
[02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:18.149]  I'm just saying that's an example.
[02:46:18.350 --> 02:46:19.969]  And there's so many people like him.
[02:46:20.889 --> 02:46:23.729]  And, you know, Hank Williams Jr., big listener of the show.
[02:46:23.850 --> 02:46:24.409]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:46:24.709 --> 02:46:25.889]  And his son, a big listener.
[02:46:26.549 --> 02:46:29.149]  And, you know, a couple of times they contacted us.
[02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.930]  He's ready to come on.
[02:46:30.030 --> 02:46:31.569]  And then, well, family told him not to.
[02:46:31.649 --> 02:46:31.889]  He didn't do it.
[02:46:31.969 --> 02:46:34.129]  I'm not singling out Hank Williams Jr.
[02:46:34.229 --> 02:46:34.870]  Love his dad.
[02:46:35.010 --> 02:46:35.450]  Love him.
[02:46:35.549 --> 02:46:36.450]  Love his music.
[02:46:36.549 --> 02:46:37.809]  Your son's got great music.
[02:46:38.699 --> 02:46:40.079]  Shooter Jennings, you know, big listener.
[02:46:40.239 --> 02:46:40.719]  He's been on the show.
[02:46:40.979 --> 02:46:42.780]  Welling Jennings, son, years ago, many times.
[02:46:42.899 --> 02:46:44.979]  He's defended me against all the attacks the last few years.
[02:46:45.059 --> 02:46:45.920]  We should get Shooter back on.
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:48.079]  But I respect people.
[02:46:48.219 --> 02:46:50.899]  Of course, his dad's the outlaw country guy, so he's got to be smart and hardcore.
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:59.000]  But I'm just saying that I'm just talking about country music.
[02:46:59.950 --> 02:47:04.090]  Because they're supposedly these American patriots, but what are they doing?
[02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:10.270]  And then, you know, Hank Williams criticized Obama, and then they took him off Monday Night Football, and he kind of went away.
[02:47:10.729 --> 02:47:16.409]  I would have loved to see more from Hank Williams Jr., because behind the scenes, you know, we had Charlie Daniels on three or four times.
[02:47:16.969 --> 02:47:24.649]  I was in a documentary with him that he, you know, was the main person on, about Agenda 21 and the New World Order, Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:47:25.770 --> 02:47:27.649]  And, you know, I mean, he's gone now.
[02:47:27.770 --> 02:47:30.489]  But it's great that Charlie Daniels fought for America.
[02:47:31.229 --> 02:47:34.069]  Charlie Daniels saw a threat and got involved.
[02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:36.590]  Imagine if all these guys did.
[02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:42.670]  And I'm just looking at country music because that's a popular pro-America genre.
[02:47:43.809 --> 02:47:44.790]  We were this close.
[02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:49.770]  We didn't really try hard, but Merle Haggard had been a Democrat but got more awoken.
[02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:52.090]  And his last song was about Kim Trails and the New World Order.
[02:47:52.149 --> 02:47:53.010]  He was that close.
[02:47:53.209 --> 02:47:54.229]  He was in Texas.
[02:47:54.690 --> 02:47:56.110]  We almost had him on the show.
[02:47:56.250 --> 02:47:57.709]  He said, next time I'm in Austin, he's coming on.
[02:47:58.129 --> 02:47:58.950]  Tell Alex I love him.
[02:47:59.049 --> 02:47:59.850]  And he died of pneumonia.
[02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:02.170]  And again, I love country music.
[02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:04.149]  I'm kind of getting to something I'm obsessed with.
[02:48:05.069 --> 02:48:07.190]  And it's just like, come on, man.
[02:48:07.290 --> 02:48:09.290]  We need Hank Williams Jr.
[02:48:09.569 --> 02:48:11.129]  We need George Strait.
[02:48:11.370 --> 02:48:12.110]  I mean, we know...
[02:48:13.090 --> 02:48:16.030]  There's leftists out there, like Garth Brooks.
[02:48:16.170 --> 02:48:18.270]  We'll just let him be there and do that.
[02:48:18.489 --> 02:48:20.649]  But the leftists are out there.
[02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:22.270]  Why are they not intimidated?
[02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:24.370]  Where are the conservatives here?
[02:48:24.610 --> 02:48:24.829]  Okay?
[02:48:25.290 --> 02:48:26.909]  And so here is...
[02:48:28.449 --> 02:48:42.610]  Sylvester Stallone, a couple nights ago with Trump, knocking it out of the park, making the point that Trump, because of the time he's in and what he's done and all the trials he's been through, it's like Herculean.
[02:48:43.350 --> 02:48:54.690]  We'll play the short clip with myself interviewing Trump saying the same thing many years ago, and then I just back-to-back play the full Sylvester Stallone speech after this, and then I've got more to say.
[02:48:54.790 --> 02:48:55.030]  Here it is.
[02:48:56.250 --> 02:48:56.790]  Guess what?
[02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:58.649]  We got the second George Washington.
[02:48:58.909 --> 02:48:59.350]  Congratulations!
[02:49:00.129 --> 02:49:08.129]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real, and you understand you're in danger, and you understand what you're doing is epic.
[02:49:08.290 --> 02:49:10.690]  It's George Washington level, and you understand that office.
[02:49:11.010 --> 02:49:18.290]  Well, I think this, I think that, sadly, I think that if we don't get it right this time, I think this is going to be the most important election our country's ever had.
[02:49:18.799 --> 02:49:22.620]  You'd have to say George Washington was right there, you know, the couple of pretty important elections, right?
[02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:28.260]  But this is certainly in the last, in the modern era, this is the most important election our country's ever had.
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:29.659]  All time, who's your favorite?
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:30.879]  Well, all time.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:39.479]  I'd say Ronald Reagan, shorter term, I would say, well, you know, you look at Lincoln and you look at Washington, you have to go with, they're the classics, right, Alex?
[02:49:39.639 --> 02:49:43.780]  You know, you think in terms of the great classics, you have to go with the Lincolns and the Washingtons.
[02:49:43.899 --> 02:49:46.340]  I agree, as a man's man, George Washington was a badass.
[02:49:47.959 --> 02:49:55.879]  When I did Rocky, if you remember, the first image was a picture of Jesus, and it says, Resurrection AC Club.
[02:49:56.079 --> 02:49:59.739]  I found a church that had been converted to a boxing ring.
[02:49:59.899 --> 02:50:04.319]  So the image pans down from Jesus onto Rocky being hit.
[02:50:04.559 --> 02:50:09.360]  And at that moment, he was a chosen person, and that's how I began the journey.
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:11.100]  Something was going to happen.
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:17.760]  This man was going to go through a metamorphosis and change lives, just like President Trump.
[02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:28.690]  We are in the presence of a really mythical character.
[02:50:29.010 --> 02:50:30.110]  I love mythology.
[02:50:30.610 --> 02:50:34.069]  And this individual does not exist on this planet.
[02:50:34.409 --> 02:50:38.069]  Nobody in the world could have pulled off what he pulled off, so I'm in awe.
[02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:44.629]  And I'll just say this, and I mean it.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:53.200]  When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world.
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:57.200]  Because without him, you can imagine what the world would look like.
[02:50:57.459 --> 02:50:57.940]  Guess what?
[02:50:58.180 --> 02:50:59.819]  We got the second George Washington.
[02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:00.459]  Congratulations!
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:04.559]  But...
[02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:17.170]  An American where at least I know I'm free.
[02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:21.129]  And I won't forget the men who died.
[02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:28.889]  Gave that right to me and I'll gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
[02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:34.610]  Please welcome the President of the United States, Donald Trump!
[02:51:35.389 --> 02:51:38.549]  It's the real deal, it's happening.
[02:51:40.469 --> 02:51:42.069]  God's handed us the ball.
[02:51:43.450 --> 02:51:46.350]  And defend her still today.
[02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:52.409]  God bless!
[02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:12.010]  Bad guys messing with me a little too much.
[02:52:17.239 --> 02:52:18.940]  I've been a little afraid to do it.
[02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:26.360]  But I went ahead and flipped the switch.
[02:52:29.579 --> 02:52:31.940]  And everybody's flipping the switch right now.
[02:52:33.219 --> 02:52:34.719]  It's called an uprising.
[02:52:36.579 --> 02:52:38.200]  It's called a global awakening.
[02:52:39.780 --> 02:52:41.600]  It's called humanity coming back.
[02:52:48.659 --> 02:52:49.139]  All right.
[02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:53.379]  Let's talk about R.O.K. Jr.
[02:52:55.680 --> 02:53:00.440]  A lot of people told Trump, don't try to get him a cabinet position.
[02:53:01.799 --> 02:53:17.860]  Just have it be advisory like Musk with his government efficiency office, Department of Government Efficiency, which is even more powerful because it can be on the outside and then you can just go into reviews and they're just scared to death of that.
[02:53:19.370 --> 02:53:21.229]  But to have RFK Jr.
[02:53:21.549 --> 02:53:27.030]  at Health and Human Services and the appointment and them trying to stop him will just have massive views.
[02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:28.110]  It'll be spectacular.
[02:53:28.110 --> 02:53:30.629]  He will destroy them.
[02:53:31.010 --> 02:53:32.129]  He's super smart.
[02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:33.629]  He's dead on.
[02:53:34.729 --> 02:53:36.209]  And he's on our team.
[02:53:37.350 --> 02:53:43.209]  And then when he gets in there, he's going to release...
[02:53:45.799 --> 02:53:52.139]  All the secret studies they've got, they know they have, on what they're really doing with these shots, because this is social control, social engineering.
[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:53.879]  They're not vaccines.
[02:53:54.879 --> 02:53:58.620]  It's never been about your health for at least the last 40 years.
[02:54:00.459 --> 02:54:16.049]  And that's why Moderna and all the big stocks went yesterday, because they know this is a real fight, the party's over, and two months before they released COVID, Actually,
[02:54:16.090 --> 02:54:29.469]  about a month before, before they admitted it was out, in December of 2019, the head UN agency over vaccines met in Switzerland, and it was like a two-day thing.
[02:54:29.469 --> 02:54:30.729]  I watched almost all of it.
[02:54:30.770 --> 02:54:32.129]  I played hours of it on air.
[02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:35.899]  And the head of the vaccine program said, most of our doctors don't want to give them.
[02:54:35.979 --> 02:54:36.639]  It's hurting people.
[02:54:36.719 --> 02:54:37.780]  We don't know what this is.
[02:54:38.159 --> 02:54:40.540]  Big Pharma is in control of us through SETI and Bill Gates.
[02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:42.020]  We just give this to people.
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:42.739]  It's hurting them.
[02:54:42.860 --> 02:54:44.899]  Our own nurses and doctors worldwide will not give them.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:46.879]  We have had a collapse of confidence.
[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:50.120]  Little do they know, oh, we'll make them love it again.
[02:54:50.219 --> 02:54:51.180]  We'll give them a pandemic.
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:52.319]  We'll give them a fear monger.
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:53.739]  We'll give them this operation.
[02:54:57.409 --> 02:55:03.610]  And that was their desperate attempt to go ahead and launch their disease exit they wanted to get total control with just to prop up their system.
[02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:05.989]  And it worked for a while, but then blew up in their face even bigger.
[02:55:07.909 --> 02:55:12.930]  And so now their system is in a lot of trouble.
[02:55:15.129 --> 02:55:16.469]  And that's very, very exciting.
[02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:18.750]  So here's a couple of clips I want to play.
[02:55:18.829 --> 02:55:19.809]  Here's RFK Jr.
[02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:29.850]  reveals the Trump DOJ will launch RICO against pharma, and then just dovetail that with a former CDC director cries over RFK Jr.
[02:55:29.989 --> 02:55:33.049]  And he noticed he's like, he's going to take away your Medicare and Medicaid.
[02:55:33.329 --> 02:55:34.709]  He wants to hurt old people.
[02:55:34.809 --> 02:55:34.889]  No.
[02:55:35.649 --> 02:55:46.489]  The COVID and the COVID shots are mainly, they got a lot of things, attack fertility, cardiovascular, all that, but they really killed predominantly more old people, which they want to get rid of so you don't have to pay your Social Security.
[02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:50.090]  So here they are, just all of it is a lie.
[02:55:50.250 --> 02:55:51.010]  All of it is crap.
[02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:52.889]  All of it is BS. All of it is fraud.
[02:55:53.629 --> 02:55:55.590]  And that's all they've got, and it's not going to work.
[02:55:55.649 --> 02:55:56.790]  They are so scared of this man.
[02:55:56.930 --> 02:55:57.389]  Pray for him.
[02:55:57.489 --> 02:55:58.069]  They killed his father.
[02:55:58.149 --> 02:55:58.770]  They killed his uncle.
[02:55:59.670 --> 02:56:11.409]  And I am just so proud to be alive at this time and just so proud of the fact that My views, the facts on the Big Pharma and the New World Order are identical to this is the truth.
[02:56:12.090 --> 02:56:17.770]  And I just am, you know, a admirer of what he's doing.
[02:56:18.329 --> 02:56:19.649]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[02:56:20.629 --> 02:56:22.489]  But let's just say this.
[02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:24.370]  We're simpatico.
[02:56:25.069 --> 02:56:27.329]  And it's exciting.
[02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:30.049]  So they thought they'd shut Alex Jones down.
[02:56:30.229 --> 02:56:32.450]  I mean, you got RFK Jr., super-powered.
[02:56:33.030 --> 02:56:35.569]  Elon Musk blown up like a titan.
[02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:37.719]  All of it.
[02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:39.340]  I mean, it's just good luck.
[02:56:39.420 --> 02:56:41.440]  You thought you'd get me off the air and you'd stop this.
[02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:43.639]  And people say, why are we all the same?
[02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:44.420]  Why do we say the same thing?
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:46.200]  Because we study this.
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:47.940]  We're telling you what's going on.
[02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:48.780]  You don't have to believe us.
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:49.319]  Just look.
[02:56:49.739 --> 02:56:50.360]  Here's the clips.
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:57:19.250]  My initial inclination would be to use the Justice Department and the moral authority of the office, but also, you know, the Justice Department should immediately Call in, begin an investigation of the medical boards and the collusion between the pharmaceutical industry and the medical boards that are de-licensing these physicians who actually try to heal patients and try to treat them.
[02:57:22.930 --> 02:57:52.149]  The Justice Department will also call in the medical journals that are Corrupted by the pharmaceutical industry and explain to them that they're all going to be subject to criminal and civil RICO actions if they don't show us a way that they're going to stop revoking studies and refusing to publish studies that challenge the mercantile interests of pharmaceutical companies.
[02:57:53.430 --> 02:57:57.879]  We're going to change the way business is done at NIH. All right.
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:01.540]  Let me play the CDC clip where we're coming up because I want to start and stop it.
[02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:04.719]  It's about three minutes long, but it'll take about probably 10 minutes to go overall.
[02:58:04.860 --> 02:58:06.979]  It's really important to decipher these liars.
[02:58:08.719 --> 02:58:13.319]  If you're just tuned in or maybe you're a new viewer, seeing what this is all about, InfoWars is back.
[02:58:13.739 --> 02:58:15.360]  It was falsely taken over.
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:17.200]  It was not sold to the Onion.
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:20.000]  The corporate media doesn't even know what to do right now.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:26.079]  We could have already been in those studios today, but I learned right when we were going on air out of the Alex Jones Network backup studio systems.
[02:58:26.659 --> 02:58:34.180]  And so when I get off here in an hour, in four minutes or three minutes, I'm going to drive over to the other studios at either 3.30 or 4.00 a.m.
[02:58:34.260 --> 02:58:34.260]  Central.
[02:58:34.399 --> 02:58:36.639]  Just look for the feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:37.430 --> 02:58:38.770]  Band out video should be back up.
[02:58:38.850 --> 02:58:39.549]  They took that down too.
[02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:40.190]  I think that's back up.
[02:58:40.229 --> 02:58:40.969]  Guys, look at band out video.
[02:58:41.549 --> 02:58:43.229]  And we're back in there.
[02:58:43.770 --> 02:58:45.489]  And the fight continues on.
[02:58:45.829 --> 02:58:47.809]  But I'm not going to be gaslit about what they did.
[02:58:47.809 --> 02:58:48.850]  I have my views on it.
[02:58:48.870 --> 02:58:49.469]  It's pretty clear.
[02:58:49.709 --> 02:58:50.829]  Saw everything I said yesterday.
[02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.569]  Came true today.
[02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:52.530]  Was already true then.
[02:58:52.850 --> 02:58:55.149]  I'm saying a lot of stuff today that I'm 99% on.
[02:58:55.620 --> 02:58:57.860]  And there's a lot happening there, and it's in the news.
[02:58:58.020 --> 02:58:59.120]  They're talking about criminal investigations.
[02:58:59.120 --> 02:58:59.979]  That's what I've been told.
[02:59:00.360 --> 02:59:01.659]  They're going on and what just happened.
[02:59:01.959 --> 02:59:02.780]  And so much more.
[02:59:02.860 --> 02:59:04.959]  Please remember, I can't fight without funds.
[02:59:05.079 --> 02:59:09.100]  We make it easy for you to support us with great products, incredible supplements, Patriot t-shirts, and more.

[02:59:22.489 --> 02:59:22.829]  It was amazing.
[02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:25.729]  That's drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:59:25.770 --> 02:59:27.329]  So be sure and support that sponsor as well.
[02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:41.559]  Hey, this is Jeff with DMO Knives and we're proud to come back to you with our second partnership with Alex Jones.

[03:01:21.649 --> 03:01:26.489]  American made by American people right here at our workshop in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[03:01:26.930 --> 03:01:29.170]  They are built to never fail the operator.
[03:01:50.329 --> 03:01:53.170]  Well, the establishment thought all these attacks would shut us up.
[03:01:53.270 --> 03:01:54.290]  It's only made us fight harder.
[03:01:54.649 --> 03:01:57.010]  The fighting spirit of humanity is now awakened.
[03:01:57.569 --> 03:01:58.549]  Some stations don't carry.
[03:01:58.549 --> 03:02:02.629]  The 400-plus radio stations we have now and TV stations don't carry this first five.
[03:02:02.649 --> 03:02:05.829]  So I'm going to talk about some stuff here and then get into the big CDC thing I was talking about.
[03:02:05.829 --> 03:02:07.809]  A lot more coming up.
[03:02:07.909 --> 03:02:10.329]  There's a lot of news I haven't gotten to, a lot of clips, a lot of breaking news as well.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.700]  But please, I didn't have time to plug it last segment.
[03:02:13.299 --> 03:02:15.680]  We're only here because of our sponsors and you supporting them.
[03:02:15.799 --> 03:02:22.260]  And when I tell you the very best supplements and amazing products are at my dad's supplement company based right here in Austin, Texas, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:23.000]  That's not a joke.
[03:02:23.159 --> 03:02:26.959]  You want next-level foundational energy, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:32.079]  You also really want to get high-quality corset and high-quality CoQ10.
[03:02:32.299 --> 03:02:33.260]  Don't have to sell you on that.
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:34.200]  Everybody knows how good it is.
[03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:37.920]  We have the highest-quality private label in this company for $30.
[03:02:38.809 --> 03:02:42.909]  This stuff sells the same stuff that we private label for $60 retail all the time.
[03:02:43.010 --> 03:02:45.030]  Because high quality corsets costs money.
[03:02:45.209 --> 03:02:46.709]  And CoQ10 costs money.
[03:02:46.850 --> 03:02:48.370]  And it just cleans out your cells.
[03:02:48.489 --> 03:02:50.670]  Incredible energy, focus, you name it.
[03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:54.870]  So I want to encourage everybody to go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:02:55.069 --> 03:02:56.809]  And there's the great fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.649]  There's so much there.
[03:02:58.739 --> 03:02:59.719]  He's a great sponsor.
[03:03:00.159 --> 03:03:01.399]  He's helped keep us on air.
[03:03:01.659 --> 03:03:10.139]  He helped develop and get the other supplements that weren't private labeled, you know, 13, 14 years ago when we launched InfoWars Life Products and InfoWars Health Products.
[03:03:10.899 --> 03:03:14.840]  But he's launched a lot of other great products that aren't available at InfoWars.
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:17.739]  And people have asked, can you go to InfoWarsStore.com?
[03:03:17.899 --> 03:03:19.040]  Can you get products there?
[03:03:19.139 --> 03:03:22.049]  Yeah, if you order those, You will still get them.
[03:03:22.329 --> 03:03:24.209]  Even when they shut everything down, they didn't shut that down.
[03:03:24.290 --> 03:03:27.450]  So if you order and we still get it shut down again, you will get your product.
[03:03:28.309 --> 03:03:31.629]  But it's in a no man's land between the two things.
[03:03:32.149 --> 03:03:34.170]  And I told you they didn't really buy it.
[03:03:34.209 --> 03:03:35.250]  I told you that wasn't real.
[03:03:35.469 --> 03:03:37.190]  I learned right before we went while I'm on air today.
[03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:40.930]  So I need more than 30 minutes to go over there and get ready.
[03:03:41.129 --> 03:03:43.010]  So in an hour, I'll leave here.
[03:03:43.149 --> 03:03:46.989]  I'll go over, get loaded for bear, not just about what happened to us, but everything else.
[03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:49.010]  And I'm going to do at least two hours.
[03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:51.489]  4 p.m.
[03:03:51.649 --> 03:03:52.510]  Central today.
[03:03:53.129 --> 03:03:54.250]  This is a big deal.
[03:03:54.569 --> 03:03:56.870]  And I'll recap all that's happened, the new developments.
[03:03:57.329 --> 03:03:58.790]  I need some time to get off the air.
[03:03:59.129 --> 03:04:00.069]  They're coming in.
[03:04:00.629 --> 03:04:01.850]  Doesn't look good for the bad guys.
[03:04:02.969 --> 03:04:04.969]  And we'll cover it all.
[03:04:05.090 --> 03:04:06.989]  But now's the time for action.
[03:04:07.129 --> 03:04:09.729]  I want to really thank those that have supported and encouraged people.
[03:04:10.229 --> 03:04:12.370]  You'd want these products if it wasn't from us.
[03:04:13.729 --> 03:04:19.510]  Why not support people that think like you, that fight like you, that have had victory and that are standing up and you're seeing the results?
[03:04:19.809 --> 03:04:24.270]  So we are just as important in the information war as Trump is.
[03:04:24.350 --> 03:04:25.670]  We magnify what he's doing.
[03:04:25.930 --> 03:04:27.770]  We support what the president's doing.
[03:04:27.850 --> 03:04:29.329]  We're watching the bad guys.
[03:04:29.329 --> 03:04:30.809]  We know the bad guys' brains.
[03:04:31.030 --> 03:04:32.209]  We know how they operate.
[03:04:32.209 --> 03:04:33.549]  And we're in their heads.
[03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:34.329]  We got their number.
[03:04:34.489 --> 03:04:35.350]  We got their name.
[03:04:35.930 --> 03:04:38.930]  And so they hate us and they want us off the air.
[03:04:39.069 --> 03:04:40.290]  We're champions of liberty.
[03:04:40.489 --> 03:04:42.149]  The enemy's coming after us.
[03:04:42.770 --> 03:04:44.250]  And this is not a spectator sport.
[03:04:44.250 --> 03:04:51.030]  When you share the articles, when you share the videos, when you pray for us, when you, on your email list, a text message, say, hey, this is the forbidden show.
[03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:52.489]  Tune into it or send them clips.
[03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:54.229]  That helps wake them up.
[03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:57.750]  It gets them into the show and it builds the resistance movement.
[03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:59.090]  We are the Paul Revere's.
[03:04:59.170 --> 03:05:00.129]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[03:05:00.209 --> 03:05:01.049]  We are the resistance.
[03:05:01.209 --> 03:05:05.069]  If you're listening to this transmission or watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:05:05.250 --> 03:05:07.450]  So in a war, it takes money to win.
[03:05:08.219 --> 03:05:09.659]  You want to have a Patriot uniform.
[03:05:09.899 --> 03:05:11.340]  You want to meet like-minded people.
[03:05:11.479 --> 03:05:15.940]  You want to support one of the motherships, one of the main frigates, one of the main capital ships in the fight.
[03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:19.139]  We're seen by the bad guys as one of the main capital ships of a major fleet.
[03:05:20.659 --> 03:05:24.639]  Get the shirts at the great site, thealextelmstore.com.
[03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:26.959]  Hundreds and hundreds of designs.
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:27.840]  More at it every day.
[03:05:28.040 --> 03:05:28.979]  Made in Arkansas.
[03:05:29.459 --> 03:05:29.819]  Patriots.
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:31.079]  They're funding us.
[03:05:31.959 --> 03:05:33.739]  They're great products, great supplements there.
[03:05:34.579 --> 03:05:36.760]  Thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:38.200]  Take action.
[03:05:38.559 --> 03:05:41.540]  And just a little side note, my dad never had a ton of money.
[03:05:42.420 --> 03:05:45.840]  And they lied to the media and said he had hundreds of millions of dollars that I hid with him and all this.
[03:05:45.899 --> 03:05:46.600]  They sued him.
[03:05:46.920 --> 03:05:51.680]  They had all the audits, all the crap, destroyed a little bit of retirement he had.
[03:05:52.579 --> 03:05:53.579]  And he's not mad.
[03:05:53.639 --> 03:05:54.219]  He's mad at them.
[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:55.579]  He loves me more than ever.
[03:05:55.659 --> 03:05:56.799]  My mom said, fight harder than ever.
[03:05:57.649 --> 03:05:59.770]  But he's got the products, and they're operating.
[03:05:59.909 --> 03:06:01.709]  But he spent everything he had in the lawyers.
[03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:03.649]  He's now beat them, and it all came out that they were wrong.
[03:06:03.690 --> 03:06:04.590]  They've left them alone now.
[03:06:04.850 --> 03:06:08.549]  But it's almost a pyrrhic victory because he's shot to hell.
[03:06:09.510 --> 03:06:13.409]  And he literally doesn't even order a new product when he's forward.
[03:06:13.489 --> 03:06:14.290]  He doesn't even have that.
[03:06:15.149 --> 03:06:16.129]  And that's a shame.
[03:06:16.129 --> 03:06:17.409]  The product we have is in stock.
[03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:20.229]  So go get the products at NewYardTrustNatural.com.
[03:06:20.940 --> 03:06:24.979]  If you appreciate what I've done, plus you want great products, it's not just about the funding of us here and now.
[03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:29.659]  I need my parents to just at least get back where they don't lose their house.
[03:06:29.959 --> 03:06:33.000]  I mean, these people have really attacked the hell out of us.
[03:06:33.079 --> 03:06:35.440]  So please help my folks and get great products.
[03:06:35.540 --> 03:06:36.879]  Please go to New YorkJourishNaptors.com right now.
[03:06:36.959 --> 03:06:37.200]  Thank you.
[03:06:40.489 --> 03:06:54.590]  The one thing I want you to do, if I could ask you to do anything for America and Alex and this network and this crew, the one thing I would ask you to do, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club.
[03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:58.690]  $30 a month, but you get $40 in store credit.
[03:06:58.829 --> 03:07:05.450]  So if you're going to buy a $35 shirt, you might as well sign up for the VIP club so that you can get that extra $10 and just get the shirt that you want.
[03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:11.250]  That is going to ensure that we can fund this operation, fund the next operation, ensure that Alex always has a voice.
[03:07:11.350 --> 03:07:12.750]  They can try to steal his identity.
[03:07:12.870 --> 03:07:14.110]  They can try to steal his business.
[03:07:14.350 --> 03:07:15.690]  They can try to steal America.
[03:07:15.690 --> 03:07:18.969]  They can try to sacrifice humanity in nuclear genocide.
[03:07:20.170 --> 03:07:30.250]  But if you go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club, they'll never take away our voice, they'll never take away our freedom, they'll never take away free speech, and we can save America together.
[03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:33.850]  Please, go now and be the reason Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:49.780]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:50.420 --> 03:07:56.559]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:00.319]  Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet.
[03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:04.620]  You make the night, I always cross the line.
[03:08:04.819 --> 03:08:07.819]  Times are bells, abuse the cells.
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:12.260]  Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf.
[03:08:12.459 --> 03:08:15.159]  Another day, some other way.
[03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:22.739]  We've had enough.
[03:08:37.860 --> 03:08:46.959]  Evil is in a lot of trouble right now.
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:09:00.440]  The love of freedom, people finding their life force, their instincts to not submit to tyranny, has been ignited.
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:06.079]  And now, the real battle is about to be joined.
[03:09:07.459 --> 03:09:17.440]  Just like General Flynn said last hour, what an exciting time to be alive.
[03:09:18.930 --> 03:09:27.850]  It's very important that we thank God Almighty for the great awakening that is happening right now.
[03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:33.750]  All right, I got a bunch of other key news to hit that I've been mentioning, and a lot we haven't gotten to that I haven't mentioned.
[03:09:34.149 --> 03:09:42.170]  But I got to tell you, I got to make the announcement one more time because just on X with our three, four streams, I just looked.
[03:09:42.690 --> 03:09:45.409]  You know, that's a nice four or five million people tuning in right now.
[03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:47.170]  That's a nice little juicy number.
[03:09:47.770 --> 03:09:55.090]  And what would happen if all of you watching on X right now just simply said, hey, Al Shones is covering forbidden information right now.
[03:09:55.930 --> 03:09:56.610]  Or, hey...
[03:09:58.030 --> 03:10:04.989]  As of this morning, InfoWars was given back to Alex Jones, and the whole corporate media is not reporting on it.
[03:10:05.569 --> 03:10:08.030]  Gee, that's quite a scandal, isn't it?
[03:10:08.370 --> 03:10:10.290]  I think you ought to tune in.
[03:10:11.809 --> 03:10:17.690]  Breaking now, Salem InfoWars blocked by a federal judge after hijacking and closure of the news organization's headquarters yesterday.
[03:10:17.909 --> 03:10:20.510]  Alex Jones is live on air, breaking massive news now.
[03:10:23.069 --> 03:10:29.010]  And let's go ahead and let's go look at the post I just put, the tweet I just put out a minute ago before I went back live on air.
[03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:32.829]  I said 2 million people on this one stream right now.
[03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:34.569]  That's just one of the streams.
[03:10:35.149 --> 03:10:36.229]  What would happen?
[03:10:36.409 --> 03:10:38.069]  Gee, I'd hate it if you all shared it.
[03:10:38.629 --> 03:10:40.149]  2 million views on this stream.
[03:10:40.309 --> 03:10:40.989]  Please watch and share.
[03:10:41.450 --> 03:10:43.090]  InfoWars is back in our hands.
[03:10:43.549 --> 03:10:47.569]  The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
[03:10:51.370 --> 03:10:57.149]  So, Is that news?
[03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:59.090]  You heard it got sold.
[03:11:00.209 --> 03:11:02.069]  You heard it was taken away.
[03:11:03.170 --> 03:11:06.510]  You heard I was crazy when I said it hadn't yesterday.
[03:11:07.889 --> 03:11:08.489]  Morning.
[03:11:09.829 --> 03:11:16.329]  And now you go to Google or Bing or wherever, you type in Alex Jones, let's do it for TV viewers.
[03:11:17.450 --> 03:11:20.909]  And all you see is, ha ha, we got your website.
[03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:26.110]  We're going to confuse people now and talk about space aliens and Bigfoot and make you look stupid.
[03:11:27.569 --> 03:11:29.629]  We own all your videos and your name.
[03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:32.409]  We're going to stay where you, said the new owner.
[03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.950]  Really?
[03:11:35.049 --> 03:11:39.209]  You can license my likeness because you claim you bought my show?
[03:11:39.450 --> 03:11:40.829]  Funny, I'm a free speech show.
[03:11:40.909 --> 03:11:41.950]  Everything I ever said was free to air.
[03:11:42.760 --> 03:11:49.879]  Even if you could twist that, you could never use me, even though you got my site, without licensing it for me, that's cut and dry.
[03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:53.440]  And they tried to get my name.
[03:11:53.780 --> 03:11:56.100]  Oh, they really wanted that.
[03:11:56.299 --> 03:11:58.280]  And they wanted real Alex Jones.
[03:11:58.459 --> 03:12:02.340]  Oh, but I'm afraid Elon Musk lawyers were in the hearing yesterday.
[03:12:03.139 --> 03:12:10.579]  Oh, I'm afraid this battle station will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
[03:12:19.159 --> 03:12:24.340]  By the way, you know this studio, the Auctions Network, you think that's the only backup?
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:28.440]  You don't think we've been knowing this is going on for a while?
[03:12:33.020 --> 03:12:35.260]  And so the Streisand effect is there.
[03:12:35.819 --> 03:12:41.540]  To show how controlled the corporate media is, the judge said yesterday, this was not an auction.
[03:12:41.719 --> 03:12:42.860]  This has not been an auction.
[03:12:43.739 --> 03:12:46.000]  We're going to have a major investigation of this.
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:48.260]  And that's a criminal investigation.
[03:12:48.639 --> 03:12:52.379]  Because these are criminal potential issues here.
[03:12:52.979 --> 03:12:55.760]  And bankruptcy crimes, potentially.
[03:12:56.459 --> 03:12:58.979]  And, you know, like a bear craps in the woods, potentially.
[03:12:59.299 --> 03:13:00.540]  A fish swims in the ocean, potentially.
[03:13:04.180 --> 03:13:07.500]  And everybody can play dumb all day.
[03:13:07.579 --> 03:13:09.579]  I'm not going along with that scenario.
[03:13:11.459 --> 03:13:11.979]  So...
[03:13:13.819 --> 03:13:29.500]  It's kind of like a wolf or a coyote grabbing a rattlesnake in its mouth, and then the rattlesnake goes pow and attaches to the side of the wolf's face and sinks a couple of little veins in there and starts going psst,
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:30.399]  psst, psst.
[03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:32.379]  And the wolf goes, Woo!
[03:13:32.879 --> 03:13:34.260]  I better let that go.
[03:13:34.399 --> 03:13:36.020]  I don't feel too good.
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:39.920]  Oh, well, you're the one who snapped your fangs on me, and I'm supposed to...
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:41.059]  While you pet me...
[03:13:41.059 --> 03:13:43.100]  Oh, you have hard feelings.
[03:13:45.159 --> 03:13:46.100]  Oh, okay.
[03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:49.459]  You just want to destroy me and my family.
[03:13:50.579 --> 03:13:52.739]  Yeah, I'm going to be real nice now.
[03:13:55.680 --> 03:13:56.200]  So...
[03:14:00.739 --> 03:14:13.899]  Boy, they got a big problem on their hands because all the corporate media can pretend like the Onion owns Infowars with the Democratic Party.
[03:14:20.590 --> 03:14:25.129]  And where's the clarification from Reuters and AP and everybody else?
[03:14:25.389 --> 03:14:28.030]  Oh, well, Bloomberg never did what they did.
[03:14:28.649 --> 03:14:29.569]  Bloomberg waited.
[03:14:29.850 --> 03:14:32.489]  And Bloomberg's a globalist publication, but it's business.
[03:14:32.729 --> 03:14:36.649]  So it's, you know, they'll spin it.
[03:14:36.829 --> 03:14:38.090]  But you can read it right there.
[03:14:38.170 --> 03:14:38.790]  You can read what the judge said.
[03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:40.149]  Kind of a big deal.
[03:14:40.209 --> 03:14:41.090]  Here, let's show you a couple of these headlines.
[03:14:41.969 --> 03:14:46.030]  Angry judge questions transparency of Onion bid for Infowars.
[03:14:46.809 --> 03:14:48.590]  Oh, does that say they bought it?
[03:14:48.670 --> 03:14:49.450]  Does that say it's theirs?
[03:14:49.729 --> 03:14:51.030]  No, it doesn't say that.
[03:14:51.969 --> 03:14:52.950]  Here's Variety.
[03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:56.110]  It's a business publication for media to know and entertainment.
[03:14:56.530 --> 03:14:59.670]  Judge halts the Onion's Infowars takeover to review bankruptcy actions.
[03:14:59.870 --> 03:15:05.030]  And it has quotes of the judge saying, no one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.
[03:15:08.649 --> 03:15:10.790]  And he goes on, say it's not an auction.
[03:15:12.690 --> 03:15:14.629]  And it was changed the rules, the secret.
[03:15:15.719 --> 03:15:16.819]  Here's another one, Daily Mail.
[03:15:17.159 --> 03:15:19.979]  Sale of Infowars halted by judge over transparency concerns.
[03:15:21.100 --> 03:15:21.340]  Oh.
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:25.940]  Angry judge questions transparency of onion bed.
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:26.979]  Angry.
[03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:30.780]  New York Post.
[03:15:30.879 --> 03:15:34.459]  Infowars sailed with the onion held up in courts as Alex Jones' rants.
[03:15:34.579 --> 03:15:35.780]  His sights have been hijacked.
[03:15:35.879 --> 03:15:36.780]  Well, I mean...
[03:15:36.780 --> 03:15:41.680]  Oh, they gave it back to me this morning.
[03:15:41.899 --> 03:15:43.780]  No, they didn't give it back to me.
[03:15:46.239 --> 03:15:49.959]  They realized that I was right.
[03:15:50.899 --> 03:15:54.920]  See, you don't sit there and tell me your narratives.
[03:15:58.079 --> 03:15:59.139]  Oh, they're all upset.
[03:15:59.219 --> 03:16:00.340]  You're calling us bad.
[03:16:00.639 --> 03:16:05.040]  I mean, you got up in court yesterday when the judge is like, well, where are the employees?
[03:16:05.139 --> 03:16:05.639]  What are they doing?
[03:16:05.780 --> 03:16:07.500]  Well, would you shut off a media company?
[03:16:07.700 --> 03:16:10.379]  Well, sir, they might steal the equipment.
[03:16:16.399 --> 03:16:22.299]  No, I said that's ours, and you didn't really get it, and we don't need that equipment.
[03:16:23.260 --> 03:16:25.520]  By the way, the average equipment over there is 10 years old.
[03:16:26.659 --> 03:16:28.440]  This equipment's brand new.
[03:16:31.280 --> 03:16:35.440]  So it's the hassle of having to put a studio in.
[03:16:36.079 --> 03:16:36.879]  That's all.
[03:16:37.500 --> 03:16:41.510]  So again, Oh, you got my website.
[03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:42.430]  I read it yesterday.
[03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:47.110]  The owner, the new owner, says we're going to confuse people and make fun of him.
[03:16:47.209 --> 03:16:47.709]  Oh, really?
[03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:50.889]  I'm going to sue your ass into the ground.
[03:16:53.170 --> 03:16:55.250]  And that's something I forgot before at the end of the news.
[03:16:56.940 --> 03:16:58.200]  Fight for Alex.com.
[03:16:58.340 --> 03:16:58.979]  Let's put that on screen.
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:05.219]  That's a give, send, go, specifically to go on the offense and defense in legal.
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:07.920]  And you've heard the leftist Democrat Party lawyers go, don't give him money.
[03:17:08.020 --> 03:17:08.719]  He's going to lose.
[03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:11.079]  No, they don't want to keep fighting.
[03:17:11.620 --> 03:17:18.000]  And we filed counteractions a month ago that have never hit the news because they don't want you to know for my civil rights violations.
[03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:19.219]  And I didn't get a fair trial.
[03:17:19.379 --> 03:17:20.520]  It wasn't a real trial.
[03:17:20.780 --> 03:17:21.819]  Cut and dry.
[03:17:25.069 --> 03:17:29.030]  And all the collusion and the rest of it.
[03:17:29.170 --> 03:17:30.829]  So yesterday I plugged this once or twice.
[03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:32.049]  We've raised $60,000.
[03:17:32.329 --> 03:17:33.110]  That sounds like a lot.
[03:17:34.090 --> 03:17:34.610]  It's not.
[03:17:34.770 --> 03:17:36.209]  But I want to thank those that did donate.
[03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:38.350]  I want you to print off some of the people who want their comments for me.
[03:17:38.409 --> 03:17:41.329]  I need to read those when I get on the 4 o'clock show today in the InfoWars studios.
[03:17:42.479 --> 03:17:44.940]  I need everybody that wants to win a war.
[03:17:45.180 --> 03:17:46.639]  That's why you donated to Trump.
[03:17:46.719 --> 03:17:47.440]  You went out and vote.
[03:17:47.579 --> 03:17:48.319]  You wore the shirts.
[03:17:48.459 --> 03:17:49.659]  You stood up for him.
[03:17:49.780 --> 03:17:50.579]  That's why we're winning.
[03:17:50.760 --> 03:17:51.659]  Well, we're key in the fight.
[03:17:51.899 --> 03:17:53.440]  So you take action.
[03:17:53.600 --> 03:17:54.719]  You're not giving something up.
[03:17:54.819 --> 03:17:55.559]  You're in the game.
[03:17:56.559 --> 03:17:57.700]  You're in a wider world.
[03:17:57.879 --> 03:18:02.639]  When you go to fightforalex.com, it takes you to Gibson Go and make a dollar, $100, $1,000.
[03:18:02.959 --> 03:18:04.899]  There's all these people with money out there that sit on it.
[03:18:05.100 --> 03:18:07.319]  We got Trump and Bitcoin's exploding, everything else.
[03:18:07.700 --> 03:18:11.059]  See how you have to defend your rights by backing media.
[03:18:11.299 --> 03:18:15.879]  That's why all the big globalists spend hundreds of billions in propaganda every year to control you.
[03:18:16.079 --> 03:18:34.739]  You've got to spend money Whether you're a working class person or a wealthy person, a wealthy person should be spending, a person making millions of dollars a year should be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year backing candidates for liberty and media organizations and TPUSA. We've got some big backing.
[03:18:34.879 --> 03:18:35.340]  Look at that.
[03:18:36.739 --> 03:18:37.219]  Winners.
[03:18:37.379 --> 03:18:38.760]  I know the great folks funding them.
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:39.260]  Great job.
[03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:43.920]  I mean, the point is, you should be backing James O'Keefe.
[03:18:43.959 --> 03:18:44.979]  You should be backing me.
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:47.319]  You should be backing all these people.
[03:18:47.659 --> 03:18:54.799]  And when it comes to narrative shattering and kicking New World Order arse, wear the tip of the spear.
[03:18:55.020 --> 03:18:56.559]  Fight for Alex.com.
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:18:57.920]  Are you going to fight for yourself?
[03:18:58.700 --> 03:19:00.299]  You got to get this in your mind.
[03:19:00.379 --> 03:19:00.979]  And I know I'm right.
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:01.420]  Listen to me.
[03:19:02.860 --> 03:19:10.299]  Not donating, not spreading the word, not supporting people that are kicking New World Order ass is stupid.
[03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:16.430]  So if you don't support me, go support Trump.
[03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:17.850]  Support Charlie Kerr.
[03:19:21.450 --> 03:19:22.010]  Support...
[03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:25.069]  And I'd say support Tucker.
[03:19:25.250 --> 03:19:26.690]  Spread his words, share his articles.
[03:19:26.790 --> 03:19:27.850]  Tucker's awesome, the best.
[03:19:28.850 --> 03:19:35.870]  Tucker's not even pushing for money because he's not on the pike like I am.
[03:19:35.909 --> 03:19:37.430]  He's not in the jaws of the enemy.
[03:19:40.110 --> 03:19:40.670]  So...
[03:19:42.519 --> 03:19:44.780]  Elon, supporting, great products, great guys.
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:48.940]  He's not in the jaws of the enemy right now.
[03:19:49.059 --> 03:19:50.059]  I'm in the jaws.
[03:19:50.139 --> 03:19:52.360]  I need you to pull me out, please.
[03:19:53.020 --> 03:19:57.100]  And I've struggled out with them, like, completely in the mouth.
[03:19:57.100 --> 03:19:58.879]  And now they got me by a leg.
[03:19:59.299 --> 03:20:02.260]  And I'm stabbing him with a political non-violent dagger in the nose.
[03:20:02.420 --> 03:20:03.819]  And I'm like, will you help me?
[03:20:03.959 --> 03:20:05.719]  And when you donate, you spread the word.
[03:20:05.959 --> 03:20:06.979]  It's like a video game.
[03:20:07.079 --> 03:20:08.639]  My power level goes.
[03:20:08.639 --> 03:20:10.280]  Like Super Mario Brother when he eats a mushroom.
[03:20:11.379 --> 03:20:15.700]  And if you give me enough money, I mean, we're talking about a couple million bucks, folks.
[03:20:16.040 --> 03:20:17.459]  Took Trump billions for this win.
[03:20:18.200 --> 03:20:21.360]  Then I'll like Super Mario for the next six months.
[03:20:22.299 --> 03:20:23.399]  I'll be.
[03:20:23.399 --> 03:20:25.000]  Get bigger, stronger.
[03:20:25.559 --> 03:20:28.120]  Because all it does is magnify what I'm already doing.
[03:20:29.219 --> 03:20:30.500]  And we've got them so close.
[03:20:32.110 --> 03:20:33.709]  But I'm sitting there like I'm...
[03:20:33.709 --> 03:20:34.829]  I did it this morning.
[03:20:34.909 --> 03:20:35.870]  I haven't run out of gas in a couple of years.
[03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.809]  I'm so busy.
[03:20:36.850 --> 03:20:37.569]  So much going on.
[03:20:37.649 --> 03:20:39.149]  I'm like, oh, I got enough gas to get to the...
[03:20:39.149 --> 03:20:45.110]  And then I'll sit and look, and I literally run out of gas on the road to the office, 200 yards from the office.
[03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:46.229]  And I'm...
[03:20:46.229 --> 03:20:48.750]  I was like...
[03:20:48.750 --> 03:20:52.270]  Luckily, there was some gas in here, and I went and got it and got some gas.
[03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:55.329]  Gas in the warehouse, and I went...
[03:20:55.329 --> 03:20:58.030]  That was the old office that's the new office again.
[03:20:58.370 --> 03:20:59.709]  I was over at M4s this morning.
[03:21:00.829 --> 03:21:02.549]  Not at these backup studios, the Alex's Network.
[03:21:03.270 --> 03:21:05.329]  And I was just like, that's what it's like.
[03:21:05.530 --> 03:21:07.389]  And I don't want to be while I'm fighting the New World Order.
[03:21:07.870 --> 03:21:17.909]  Let's say I'm like a starfighter blasting the enemy TIE fighters, and my energy level's way down, and I just ignore it because I'm like going around in the fight, and all of a sudden, ship turns off, and I'm like, ah.
[03:21:18.569 --> 03:21:26.629]  And so I'm like watching it, blink, blink, energy, energy, danger, danger, danger, and I'm like, you know, destroying the enemy, and I'm down to like a half a life.
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:29.780]  I'm like, hey guys, I got half a life left.
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:32.079]  Will you put one more on, like you're playing Galaga?
[03:21:33.319 --> 03:21:36.620]  You know, you're down to one life, and I'm like, oh, all of a sudden you go, bloop, oh, another life.
[03:21:36.719 --> 03:21:37.280]  Oh, thank you.
[03:21:37.719 --> 03:21:41.520]  I love it when you're playing Galaga, there's like six lives, you know what I mean?
[03:21:42.620 --> 03:21:44.600]  But you do play harder when you're down to that one life.
[03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:45.780]  I've always noticed that.
[03:21:45.819 --> 03:21:46.620]  I'm not a huge video game, man.
[03:21:46.620 --> 03:21:50.420]  I played a lot of Galaga as a kid, and Somewhere around here, I had it in the house.
[03:21:50.639 --> 03:21:51.959]  I had the video console.
[03:21:52.079 --> 03:21:52.799]  It's the old-fashioned game.
[03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:54.120]  It's got like 20 games on it, Galaga.
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:58.040]  And I noticed when I'm down to one life, I just passed seven levels with one life.
[03:21:58.680 --> 03:22:00.819]  Maybe that's why God always keeps me at one life.
[03:22:01.639 --> 03:22:03.959]  I was just like, this is stressing me out.
[03:22:04.059 --> 03:22:07.459]  And you want me up here like, give me money, give me money, give me money, give me money.
[03:22:07.540 --> 03:22:07.899]  And I'm watching it.
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:11.219]  And I hate that, but what I really hate is watching one life.
[03:22:11.979 --> 03:22:14.059]  And I'm like, I really don't want to start back.
[03:22:14.299 --> 03:22:17.579]  Yeah, because I hate losing money.
[03:22:18.729 --> 03:22:20.329]  More than I hate begging.
[03:22:20.909 --> 03:22:24.309]  And it's not like I'm a baby bird sitting there in the nest doing nothing, going, Mommy, give me food.
[03:22:24.409 --> 03:22:28.950]  Meep, meep, [...] meep.
[03:22:29.250 --> 03:22:30.190]  Go to the document cam shot.
[03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.549]  I like that.
[03:22:30.690 --> 03:22:33.829]  Meep, meep, [...] meep.
[03:22:34.090 --> 03:22:35.729]  I'll just keep doing it until we go to the document cam shot.
[03:22:36.129 --> 03:22:38.049]  Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.
[03:22:38.110 --> 03:22:38.489]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:22:51.260 --> 03:23:00.180]  I was a big Sesame Street fan when I was a kid because it kind of already come out when I was bigger.
[03:23:01.879 --> 03:23:03.239]  I just never liked it compared to Looney Tunes.
[03:23:03.340 --> 03:23:04.540]  I guess it was out when I was very little.
[03:23:04.639 --> 03:23:06.239]  I guess it came out in 1974, I was even born.
[03:23:06.319 --> 03:23:18.239]  The point was, I didn't really like Sesame Street, but I liked Cookie Monster, and I liked the aliens would show up occasionally, and they would go, remember those guys?
[03:23:18.579 --> 03:23:20.659]  All right, I'm getting a little giddy here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:23:21.860 --> 03:23:23.559]  Oh, so much serious news to cover.
[03:23:24.219 --> 03:23:36.739]  I just can't get over the fact that they had a secret fake bed, got caught, thought they'd sneak it past the judge, and then they literally unlawfully, they didn't, oh, here, here's your InfoWars back.
[03:23:36.840 --> 03:23:37.500]  You can broadcast.
[03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:38.840]  Oh, thank you.
[03:23:39.780 --> 03:23:41.200]  Oh, you're so sweet.
[03:23:41.719 --> 03:23:43.120]  Here, let me turn my back again.
[03:23:47.260 --> 03:23:49.500]  So, I'm done.
[03:23:50.709 --> 03:23:59.090]  And these people are trying to figure out how to get me to lower my guard again so they can slip in the political blade in between my ribs.
[03:23:59.829 --> 03:24:02.209]  And I'm just saying no thanks, okay?
[03:24:03.069 --> 03:24:05.209]  So get this through your head.
[03:24:08.010 --> 03:24:08.969]  Trump's not stopping.
[03:24:09.370 --> 03:24:10.370]  I'm not stopping.
[03:24:10.829 --> 03:24:11.850]  None of us are stopping.
[03:24:12.309 --> 03:24:14.709]  Get that Jordan Belfer clip that Chase came up with.
[03:24:15.129 --> 03:24:15.889]  Let me be clear.
[03:24:16.129 --> 03:24:18.989]  I don't think the Wolf of Wall Street, what he did, was cute.
[03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:21.049]  I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio.
[03:24:21.149 --> 03:24:23.510]  He's a horrible globalist, though, as an actor, I do like him.
[03:24:24.209 --> 03:24:25.569]  He's one of the worst globalists.
[03:24:26.129 --> 03:24:32.270]  And I didn't, you know, glorify the stuff in Wolf of Wall Street, though I've been blamed for some of the stuff in it, you know, eating people's goldfish.
[03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:38.489]  But this is a good little allegory or analogy or parable.
[03:24:38.809 --> 03:24:41.409]  So let's play that, then I'm going to get refocused and cover the news.
[03:24:42.069 --> 03:24:44.370]  But InfoWars is back for now.
[03:24:44.489 --> 03:24:47.170]  I don't know what chicanery is going to happen in the future, but imagine...
[03:24:47.890 --> 03:24:48.510]  It's shut.
[03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:49.229]  It's over.
[03:24:49.329 --> 03:24:50.389]  We've taken his identity.
[03:24:50.590 --> 03:24:51.649]  We're going to do all this to him.
[03:24:51.770 --> 03:24:56.670]  And then 24 hours later, like a car wreck noise, a record skip.
[03:24:57.290 --> 03:24:58.030]  It's not.
[03:24:58.209 --> 03:24:59.090]  And here we are.
[03:24:59.489 --> 03:25:00.670]  Where's the corporate media?
[03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:02.309]  How are they going to spin that?
[03:25:02.549 --> 03:25:03.030]  Well, guess what?
[03:25:03.149 --> 03:25:03.829]  They don't matter.
[03:25:05.179 --> 03:25:19.920]  Because there's 400 plus radio stations carrying us, and a bunch of cable and TV stations, and number one on cloud TV, and five, six million people watching on X right now, and the clips will get 20 million views, and it'll be 10 million, 20 million, because it just builds watching tonight.
[03:25:20.299 --> 03:25:24.000]  And I'll go do another show that gets 10 million, 20 million views, conservatively.
[03:25:24.180 --> 03:25:26.860]  I mean, we just take clips out of the show, it'll have 100 million views today.
[03:25:27.399 --> 03:25:31.600]  So, CNN's main shows have a million viewers.
[03:25:32.260 --> 03:25:36.540]  But they're the CNN making the announcement to everyone, explaining how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:25:39.280 --> 03:25:47.379]  And I'm literally, most of the crew understood this and believed that they seem to be right a lot, plus they see how everything's getting done, that they're smart.
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:49.079]  But I love the crew.
[03:25:49.399 --> 03:25:53.079]  Some of the crew, though, was, a few of them were like, literally, no, it's over.
[03:25:53.219 --> 03:25:53.659]  It's over.
[03:25:53.780 --> 03:25:55.879]  I'm like, no, no, it's not over.
[03:25:56.540 --> 03:25:58.540]  And we'll probably be back in the, of there next week.
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:03.979]  And I was telling them they'd shut us down Monday on Thursday morning.
[03:26:04.159 --> 03:26:05.159]  I nailed that.
[03:26:05.819 --> 03:26:10.600]  And then I'm like, we'll go through all this, but it's so crazy what they're doing.
[03:26:10.719 --> 03:26:12.120]  I think they changed the rules.
[03:26:12.239 --> 03:26:13.000]  I don't think it'll be a real bid.
[03:26:13.079 --> 03:26:15.719]  I bet they don't even pay money, which they didn't.
[03:26:16.079 --> 03:26:20.459]  And it's just so nuts because they're so entitled and so used to just controlling everything.
[03:26:21.200 --> 03:26:23.020]  And I said, I bet we're back there next week.
[03:26:24.100 --> 03:26:27.340]  And it was sooner than I thought.
[03:26:28.120 --> 03:26:31.250]  And People said, no, that's just not true.
[03:26:32.809 --> 03:26:35.290]  Alex, you just never stopped fighting.
[03:26:35.549 --> 03:26:37.049]  You still know when you're finally beat.
[03:26:38.829 --> 03:26:40.290]  And I'm just like, okay.
[03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:42.069]  All right.
[03:26:42.389 --> 03:26:43.290]  Well, that's what you believe.
[03:26:44.610 --> 03:26:50.909]  And listen, I don't blame you for abandoning the ship in our moment of triumph.
[03:26:51.389 --> 03:27:01.409]  But because no matter what happens to us, the moment of triumph Is that we never give up.
[03:27:01.610 --> 03:27:04.170]  The journey is the destination.
[03:27:04.989 --> 03:27:10.850]  But with what's happening now, we get to actually have the victory here in the third dimension, not just the spiritual victory.
[03:27:11.010 --> 03:27:26.690]  But I could lose everything and be totally defeated temporarily, but my soul and my energetic actions are the only signature, interdimensionally, intergalactically, multivariate, that God sees.
[03:27:28.569 --> 03:27:30.790]  I don't want to hear talk, I want to see action.
[03:27:33.649 --> 03:27:34.469]  That's what you're getting.
[03:27:34.889 --> 03:27:35.569]  Here's the clip.
[03:27:37.069 --> 03:27:41.030]  For years I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right?
[03:27:41.250 --> 03:27:47.430]  You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone until you get what you want.
[03:27:48.889 --> 03:27:50.229]  Because you all deserve it.
[03:27:52.370 --> 03:27:54.670]  You know this f***ing deal that I'm about to sign?
[03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:01.799]  I'll tell you what it is.
[03:28:02.020 --> 03:28:06.079]  It's me taking no for an answer, you know?
[03:28:08.180 --> 03:28:11.500]  It's them selling me, not the other way around.
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:15.420]  It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
[03:28:22.500 --> 03:28:22.899]  So...
[03:28:22.899 --> 03:28:30.520]  You know what?
[03:28:43.430 --> 03:28:44.170]  I'm not leaving!
[03:28:49.290 --> 03:28:54.489]  The show goes on!
[03:29:36.209 --> 03:29:41.909]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[03:29:42.209 --> 03:29:46.649]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[03:29:48.530 --> 03:29:53.590]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[03:29:53.709 --> 03:29:56.829]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[03:29:56.989 --> 03:29:59.450]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[03:29:59.709 --> 03:30:02.450]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:30:02.690 --> 03:30:06.170]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[03:30:06.690 --> 03:30:13.489]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the New World Order and BlackRock.
[03:30:22.699 --> 03:30:24.860]  AlexJones.network is...
[03:30:24.860 --> 03:30:28.059]  Alright, we're going to break in a minute.
[03:30:28.120 --> 03:30:29.040]  I'm going to come back with all the news.
[03:30:29.620 --> 03:30:30.760]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:30:30.879 --> 03:30:31.659]  History is happening now.
[03:30:32.680 --> 03:30:33.899]  Humanity is fighting back.
[03:30:34.059 --> 03:30:35.180]  Humanity has awoken.
[03:30:35.379 --> 03:30:37.840]  Follow me on Exit Real Alex Jones and at AJNLive.
[03:30:37.979 --> 03:30:38.600]  Stay with us.
[03:30:39.729 --> 03:30:54.670]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[03:30:54.930 --> 03:30:57.950]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public.
[03:30:58.700 --> 03:31:04.139]  And people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[03:31:04.620 --> 03:31:08.379]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might say tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[03:31:08.540 --> 03:31:09.020]  Who knows?
[03:31:09.540 --> 03:31:12.000]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[03:31:12.299 --> 03:31:18.100]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty.
[03:31:18.840 --> 03:31:26.680]  Having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[03:31:26.920 --> 03:31:31.100]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:34.159]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjohnstore.com.
[03:31:34.809 --> 03:31:45.510]  With incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network where we won't miss a beat.
[03:31:45.709 --> 03:32:00.250]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at thealexjonesstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[03:32:00.680 --> 03:32:04.479]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[03:32:04.559 --> 03:32:05.840]  But that's going to get announced.
[03:32:05.959 --> 03:32:08.040]  The winner here in just a few days.
[03:32:08.200 --> 03:32:12.219]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[03:32:12.260 --> 03:32:13.860]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[03:32:14.040 --> 03:32:15.700]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[03:32:15.899 --> 03:32:16.559]  So now...
[03:32:17.180 --> 03:32:24.879]  We're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:25.239 --> 03:32:30.780]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[03:32:30.959 --> 03:32:32.239]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[03:32:32.399 --> 03:32:33.379]  It's a beautiful truck.
[03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:39.309]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.

[03:34:27.860 --> 03:34:33.299]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[03:34:33.540 --> 03:34:34.459]  God bless you all.
[03:34:34.680 --> 03:34:35.620]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:34:58.940 --> 03:35:02.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, from the Infowars.com studios.
[03:35:02.739 --> 03:35:07.020]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:35:07.399 --> 03:35:09.420]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:35:10.180 --> 03:35:12.940]  All right, in the first hour...
[03:35:14.389 --> 03:35:24.049]  I talked about how I was told by people that Trump and Elon Musk were upset and they were getting folks to begin looking into this as a criminal investigation.
[03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:36.670]  And when you've got the real president and Elon Musk, an Elon Musk lawyer at the hearing yesterday in Houston, the bankruptcy emergency hearing about the hijacking of M4s, which is now admitted, saying that's going on.
[03:35:36.829 --> 03:35:41.090]  And then we had a bunch of news colleagues forever talked about it saying they hear that's going on.
[03:35:41.530 --> 03:35:42.389]  Bloomberg, others.
[03:35:44.149 --> 03:35:46.110]  Calling lawyers, you're calling others.
[03:35:46.329 --> 03:35:48.110]  I'm saying, criminal investigation.
[03:35:48.350 --> 03:35:50.649]  The judge said, I want to investigate this.
[03:35:50.649 --> 03:35:52.149]  I want an evidentiary hearing.
[03:35:52.350 --> 03:35:53.510]  That means an investigation.
[03:35:54.510 --> 03:35:58.709]  And all the lawyers I talked to said, oh yeah, this is bad.
[03:35:59.190 --> 03:36:06.690]  So that's my opinion in the first hour, is that this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and I've been told it's going on.
[03:36:07.649 --> 03:36:11.340]  So, The crew goes, well, let's see if that's going on.
[03:36:11.459 --> 03:36:12.260]  I'm not even looking.
[03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:13.600]  I mean, I already have all these calls.
[03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:14.340]  People tell me this.
[03:36:16.479 --> 03:36:24.559]  Jeffrey Clark, former assistant AG, director of U.S. trustee program, will be investigated over Alex Jones' bankruptcy handling.
[03:36:25.280 --> 03:36:32.239]  And we know that the Justice Department got involved, told my lawyers, we're going to, you know, never let Alex have access to this.
[03:36:32.379 --> 03:36:33.299]  He's not going to do it.
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:34.500]  This comes from the top, they said.
[03:36:34.559 --> 03:36:36.760]  They were dumbing up and sending emails two years ago saying that.
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:42.260]  And then I experienced what the trustees have done the whole time, just coming after me, man.
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:47.500]  And the judge has fired one, removed two other CROs.
[03:36:47.579 --> 03:36:48.799]  I mean, it's not been fun.
[03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:55.540]  I mean, you know, and so I figured it out pretty quick what was going on.
[03:36:56.799 --> 03:37:00.639]  And then now they've done this again with a clearly fake auction that didn't happen.
[03:37:00.979 --> 03:37:02.979]  They've now said InfoWars is back in my hands.
[03:37:04.290 --> 03:37:09.889]  I didn't know that you had this former assistant AG saying this.
[03:37:09.989 --> 03:37:11.969]  I didn't know it was on Good Morning America this morning.
[03:37:12.010 --> 03:37:13.170]  I didn't know all this.
[03:37:13.450 --> 03:37:15.149]  And we're finding a whole bunch more.
[03:37:15.149 --> 03:37:17.069]  So this is what I was hearing, too.
[03:37:17.770 --> 03:37:22.110]  So, oh, from my opinion to what he's saying, here is Jeffrey Clark.
[03:37:24.430 --> 03:37:35.690]  at the end of the Trump administration, argue a case about the U.S. bankruptcy trustees, who are the same folks here who are bedeviling Alex Jones and went in and shut him down.
[03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:47.780]  And look, as you were describing, they have, in connection with the private trustees that are set up and that they supervise, Fiduciary duties to make sure that they get a maximum return for the creditors, right?
[03:37:47.959 --> 03:37:59.860]  And so if what Alex Jones describes is correct, Steve, that there were other bidders, you know, maybe led by Roger Stone and he's a hero for putting them together to try to rescue Infowars.
[03:38:00.020 --> 03:38:06.670]  And if they had the highest bid and that was ignored, You know, that's a serious legal issue that will need to be examined.
[03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:10.649]  I was looking at who the current director is of the U.S. trustee program.
[03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:13.790]  It's a woman named Tara Twomey.
[03:38:13.930 --> 03:38:26.850]  And you better believe that when the Trump administration starts, That she's going to get investigated, that how this bankruptcy of Alex Jones was investigated, how it was dealt with, is going to be investigated.
[03:38:27.370 --> 03:38:31.649]  This is something that hopefully the judge will shut this down and say, look, I got to review this.
[03:38:31.770 --> 03:38:33.290]  Don't do anything precipitous.
[03:38:33.549 --> 03:38:41.309]  But if he doesn't, because he's been working on these proceedings for a long time and judges eventually get to the point where they want to get things off their docket.
[03:38:41.690 --> 03:38:48.409]  You know, what the trustees seem to be doing here to me, you know, and these are people who are part of the Justice Department, right?
[03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:54.389]  I don't think that's well known that the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Program is part of the Justice Department.
[03:38:54.430 --> 03:38:57.190]  The Justice Department's span is truly enormous.
[03:38:57.810 --> 03:38:59.510]  You know, that needs to be investigated.
[03:38:59.510 --> 03:39:06.409]  And I think that we can probably count on Matt Gaetz as Attorney General to do that kind of deep investigation, Steve.
[03:39:06.610 --> 03:39:15.590]  And so they're trying to clearly rush this out and shut Alex Jones down as a kind of demonstration of they're still in charge for the next 67 days or so.
[03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:18.190]  And, you know, they could live to regret that.
[03:39:18.350 --> 03:39:25.549]  And so I think people should be looking over their shoulder and thinking about whether they really want to be doing this to shut down an important media operation.
[03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:28.389]  He said that this morning.
[03:39:28.590 --> 03:39:30.409]  I just learned about it recently.
[03:39:31.649 --> 03:39:34.610]  That's what I was hearing yesterday morning, last night, and today.
[03:39:35.450 --> 03:39:39.350]  And now they've said, oh yeah, it didn't go through here, it's yours.
[03:39:39.690 --> 03:39:42.829]  Well, you can't halfway rob a bank.
[03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:47.069]  You can't halfway hijack a media company and turn it off and kick them out.
[03:39:47.209 --> 03:39:48.469]  And you know what happened?
[03:39:49.149 --> 03:39:50.389]  You're not half pregnant.
[03:39:51.629 --> 03:39:53.549]  So that guy nailed it.
[03:39:53.549 --> 03:39:57.620]  Except Roger Stone in the group, I'm not going to say who.
[03:39:58.620 --> 03:40:01.559]  They were ready with big money.
[03:40:02.200 --> 03:40:07.479]  And I said to them, I said, I've already got people I've worked with for years.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:10.940]  I've already told them that no amount of money is going to go through.
[03:40:12.159 --> 03:40:13.120]  This is rigged.
[03:40:14.739 --> 03:40:17.840]  And then on Monday, it came out that, oh, we don't take the highest bidder.
[03:40:17.959 --> 03:40:19.780]  And now the old auction's over.
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:20.620]  And now it's secret.
[03:40:20.819 --> 03:40:22.239]  And all this garbage.
[03:40:22.440 --> 03:40:23.840]  And the judge said this is not an auction.
[03:40:26.329 --> 03:40:28.790]  And I said, listen, you want to invest in a network?
[03:40:28.889 --> 03:40:29.510]  You want me involved?
[03:40:29.629 --> 03:40:29.950]  It's me.
[03:40:30.030 --> 03:40:30.950]  It's not Infowars.
[03:40:31.049 --> 03:40:32.229]  I said, just watch.
[03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:33.409]  This is not happening.
[03:40:33.930 --> 03:40:34.850]  And now they're all like...
[03:40:35.739 --> 03:40:37.079]  First, they're like, how the hell did you know that?
[03:40:37.159 --> 03:40:38.180]  What the hell's going on there?
[03:40:38.239 --> 03:40:39.360]  You freaking let them do this?
[03:40:39.399 --> 03:40:40.059]  I said, no.
[03:40:40.559 --> 03:40:41.639]  And they're like, oh, we apologize.
[03:40:41.819 --> 03:40:42.399]  God, this is crazy.
[03:40:42.520 --> 03:40:43.040]  They're getting a lot of trouble.
[03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:44.620]  The president's very upset.
[03:40:45.020 --> 03:40:47.180]  So, Elon Musk, and I was like, really?
[03:40:47.440 --> 03:40:48.940]  And then all of a sudden, Elon's Musk lawyers are there.
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:49.799]  I'm like, whoa.
[03:40:50.100 --> 03:40:52.239]  And then I make them get the other phone calls.
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:55.340]  And I'm like, it's a hornet's nest over this.
[03:40:55.739 --> 03:41:05.559]  So, they just hung their ass out as a giant target and We're good to go.
[03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:23.590]  And the bid that the other people put in was not money.
[03:41:23.729 --> 03:41:29.909]  It was like pledging my money someday as an IOU to pay for them getting it when the judge's order was cash.
[03:41:30.069 --> 03:41:34.229]  And the judge said in the hearing yesterday, I did not say that there was going to be an auction right now.
[03:41:34.329 --> 03:41:36.690]  I want to have hearings about it because it's being challenged what you're saying.
[03:41:37.409 --> 03:41:38.569]  He goes, there was an auction?
[03:41:39.149 --> 03:41:39.909]  Well, okay.
[03:41:40.270 --> 03:41:41.450]  Who was the highest bidder?
[03:41:42.170 --> 03:41:43.610]  Okay, well, what was the winning bid?
[03:41:43.729 --> 03:41:44.530]  We don't know.
[03:41:45.489 --> 03:41:46.510]  You don't know?
[03:41:47.860 --> 03:41:54.479]  And then last night, they figured out they couldn't do this, so they gave the highest bidder that had already been leaked to CNN two days before, showing there's moles.
[03:41:55.340 --> 03:41:58.760]  The people that were buying it that I would work with would not tell me the bid.
[03:42:00.579 --> 03:42:03.959]  They would say, listen, we're not really going to talk to you.
[03:42:03.959 --> 03:42:06.000]  We were just following this so by the book.
[03:42:06.819 --> 03:42:11.540]  Because one of the owners of the company is one of the top bankruptcy guys in the country.
[03:42:12.609 --> 03:42:19.209]  So he's like, we are not going to, I mean, it was just like, okay, well, I've been working with this company you co-owned for seven years.
[03:42:19.329 --> 03:42:20.930]  I'm just telling you, as long as you don't censor me.
[03:42:21.489 --> 03:42:25.969]  And so I had a contract with them that the trustee was letting on about, an employment contract.
[03:42:26.889 --> 03:42:32.489]  And as long as I had full editorial control, they're going to do this, whether they shut this down or not.
[03:42:33.010 --> 03:42:33.370]  Okay.
[03:42:35.229 --> 03:42:38.569]  But that is congruent on them getting the company and then going forward.
[03:42:39.510 --> 03:42:42.709]  And then we had plans regardless, but they're not my employer yet.
[03:42:43.870 --> 03:42:47.989]  So I told everybody this on air as well, you know, that we had stuff going on.
[03:42:48.370 --> 03:42:55.709]  And so I couldn't then just jump in with this new group with even more money and stuff and write in to connect it to Trump big time.
[03:42:56.149 --> 03:42:58.690]  You know, Trump trying to help, let's just say that.
[03:42:59.290 --> 03:43:02.090]  And I was just like, your work's too important.
[03:43:02.350 --> 03:43:03.469]  This is a fiasco.
[03:43:03.610 --> 03:43:04.530]  You don't want to get near this.
[03:43:04.649 --> 03:43:05.569]  This is the feds.
[03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:07.969]  And I briefed them and said what I believe they would do.
[03:43:08.049 --> 03:43:09.409]  And they just know I'm pretty smart.
[03:43:09.409 --> 03:43:11.709]  And it happened exactly as I said.
[03:43:11.989 --> 03:43:15.010]  And then they kind of flipped out and were like, how'd you know all that?
[03:43:15.090 --> 03:43:15.829]  Or what are you...
[03:43:15.829 --> 03:43:17.649]  I was like, no, I explained it.
[03:43:18.110 --> 03:43:19.290]  They're like, oh, okay, we're sorry.
[03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:20.229]  I got yelled at yesterday.
[03:43:21.190 --> 03:43:24.229]  So that's...
[03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.790]  People are pissed.
[03:43:25.170 --> 03:43:26.389]  They're tired of this.
[03:43:27.209 --> 03:43:28.350]  And so...
[03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:32.409]  I mean, look, you don't need to be a rocket scientist.
[03:43:32.569 --> 03:43:37.989]  I already knew this months ago, and a few weeks ago is when I was like, clear, you know, no, this is Prasada non grata.
[03:43:38.549 --> 03:43:49.110]  And then on Monday, when we get told, oh, all the old bids are gone, it's not public, and a lower person can win, I was like, okay, this is going to be rigged.
[03:43:49.290 --> 03:43:53.590]  And I said, okay, they say the auction, the fake auction's over at 10.30 a.m.
[03:43:53.690 --> 03:43:53.950]  Central.
[03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:56.090]  I said, I don't think they'll shut us down that day.
[03:43:56.250 --> 03:43:57.510]  I had some crew sleep at the office.
[03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:58.950]  I said, they could come in all the night.
[03:43:59.670 --> 03:44:00.610]  You know, don't resist them.
[03:44:00.770 --> 03:44:05.209]  Just, you know, just tell them they don't have documents or court order that, you know, you think it's BS, call me.
[03:44:06.149 --> 03:44:09.010]  And, but I said, they'll probably come at like 8 in the morning.
[03:44:11.049 --> 03:44:12.909]  They literally walked to the door at 8 a.m.
[03:44:13.270 --> 03:44:14.770]  I was there at like 7.32.
[03:44:15.170 --> 03:44:17.590]  I was driving there when this all happened.
[03:44:18.090 --> 03:44:23.989]  Or at the gym and then ran out like I was, you know, like a World War II pilot running out of the tarmac to get in my Spitfire.
[03:44:24.090 --> 03:44:24.510]  I was like, ugh.
[03:44:27.299 --> 03:44:28.280]  And I just ran.
[03:44:28.360 --> 03:44:29.379]  I said, get it fired up.
[03:44:29.559 --> 03:44:30.879]  I'm taking over Harrison's show.
[03:44:31.139 --> 03:44:32.239]  The crews are, okay, what's going on?
[03:44:32.319 --> 03:44:33.700]  I was like, they'll be here in minutes.
[03:44:33.860 --> 03:44:34.600]  Go, go, go.
[03:44:34.719 --> 03:44:35.879]  They're going to say we're not supposed to be on the air.
[03:44:35.959 --> 03:44:36.600]  They're going to say it's the law.
[03:44:36.659 --> 03:44:37.159]  They're going to threaten you.
[03:44:37.219 --> 03:44:37.860]  You can do what you want.
[03:44:38.120 --> 03:44:39.399]  I'm telling you, it's fraud.
[03:44:39.620 --> 03:44:40.079]  Let's go.
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:40.520]  Let's go.
[03:44:40.620 --> 03:44:40.959]  Let's go.
[03:44:41.879 --> 03:44:42.979]  And that's what happened.
[03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:47.649]  And I called up Bannon.
[03:44:48.370 --> 03:44:50.629]  I said, I need you to, you know, I'm on air.
[03:44:50.729 --> 03:44:53.649]  I need you to call, you know, folks at the real White House.
[03:44:53.709 --> 03:44:53.989]  Let them know.
[03:44:54.030 --> 03:44:54.750]  He goes, yeah, of course.
[03:44:55.170 --> 03:44:56.530]  I said, as soon as you're ready, come on.
[03:44:57.430 --> 03:44:58.889]  And then 10 minutes later, he came on.
[03:44:59.530 --> 03:45:00.649]  And I mean, I'm under attack.
[03:45:00.770 --> 03:45:01.989]  I'm like, Imperial troops are under the base.
[03:45:02.110 --> 03:45:03.569]  I said, call Trump.
[03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:05.010]  Tell him Imperial troops are under the base.
[03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.750]  Literally.
[03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:09.549]  Because that's what you do.
[03:45:12.329 --> 03:45:16.270]  We're so used to taking it and just, oh God, the Justice Department's here.
[03:45:16.450 --> 03:45:29.809]  You heard that former federal prosecutor, Assistant AG. He just said that he was a prominent, high-powered guy.
[03:45:29.909 --> 03:45:32.340]  He just said You don't know.
[03:45:32.459 --> 03:45:33.360]  This is the Justice Department.
[03:45:33.840 --> 03:45:35.379]  This is what Alex has been dealing with.
[03:45:35.520 --> 03:45:36.760]  So he hears my show.
[03:45:37.100 --> 03:45:38.139]  He knows it.
[03:45:38.159 --> 03:45:39.180]  He goes, that guy knows what he's talking about.
[03:45:39.260 --> 03:45:40.000]  He goes and checks.
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:41.620]  He says, this looks really bad.
[03:45:41.739 --> 03:45:47.379]  And for a prosecutor, he was saying, you better start getting ready for your prison uniforms.
[03:45:51.340 --> 03:46:00.159]  And he said, if you're dumb enough to still do this to show you're the big gorilla, you are in a lot of trouble.
[03:46:00.899 --> 03:46:03.959]  Now, I said all that yesterday before he said it.
[03:46:04.659 --> 03:46:06.719]  My opinion...
[03:46:06.719 --> 03:46:18.879]  So, it's good that they got some sense and said, oh, actually, the shell didn't go through it.
[03:46:18.899 --> 03:46:19.579]  It's yours for now.
[03:46:20.559 --> 03:46:29.219]  But if you don't think they're running around scheming of how they're going to respond to this and what they're going to do, you're dumb.
[03:46:29.219 --> 03:46:30.000]  And I know you're not dumb.
[03:46:31.200 --> 03:46:38.000]  So, it's on like Donkey Kong, and this is a major scandal.
[03:46:38.180 --> 03:46:42.739]  Now, the celebration started yesterday, but it kind of started ending this morning.
[03:46:43.559 --> 03:46:59.079]  Here is the owner of Infowars, Knot, and some of these other guys, the Onion CEO Ben Collins in every town,
[03:47:00.760 --> 03:47:09.700]  For the gun safety president, John Finblatt, joined ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America for a sit-down interview Friday.
[03:47:10.420 --> 03:47:16.700]  We claim to own InfoWars and tripped over his words while falsely alleging his group offered the highest bid.
[03:47:16.899 --> 03:47:17.600]  That's funny.
[03:47:19.360 --> 03:47:26.360]  Onion CEO stumbles when asked about highest bid for InfoWars and Judge Halting Sale.
[03:47:26.379 --> 03:47:26.840]  Here it is.
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:33.399]  Start it over.
[03:47:33.620 --> 03:47:33.840]  It's okay.
[03:47:33.940 --> 03:47:35.159]  We didn't have audio, but first, it's all right.
[03:47:35.219 --> 03:47:36.260]  New studio, stuff like that happens.
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:37.639]  Back it up.
[03:47:37.719 --> 03:47:38.420]  Let's just take our time.
[03:47:38.540 --> 03:47:48.760]  Hey, let's take five minutes just to break, just to relax, focus, just kind of chill, relax.
[03:47:50.139 --> 03:47:52.659]  Now, here's the article on Infowars.com.
[03:47:53.319 --> 03:47:57.979]  Onion CEO stumbles when asked about highest bid for Infowars and judge halting sale.
[03:47:58.100 --> 03:47:58.399]  Here it is.
[03:47:59.510 --> 03:48:05.530]  Now to the satirical website The Onion announcing that it has won a bid to buy Alex Jones' Infowars in a bankruptcy auction.
[03:48:06.030 --> 03:48:10.170]  Jones was forced to pay $1.4 billion to the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims.
[03:48:10.590 --> 03:48:15.409]  Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion, has teamed up with John Fineblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, on this project.
[03:48:15.569 --> 03:48:16.149]  Welcome to you both.
[03:48:16.270 --> 03:48:18.329]  Thank you for coming in this morning.
[03:48:18.409 --> 03:48:21.989]  I had to say, Ben, when I saw this headline yesterday, I was pretty startled at first.
[03:48:22.129 --> 03:48:25.329]  Explain why you wanted to buy this site, what you plan to do with it.
[03:48:25.430 --> 03:48:29.590]  Yeah, so we thought it would be the funniest joke of all time, basically, when we heard about it.
[03:48:29.649 --> 03:48:31.250]  And I think that's borne out, frankly.
[03:48:32.069 --> 03:48:32.670]  Explain why.
[03:48:32.770 --> 03:48:35.750]  Explain to everybody what's behind the Infowars and what you want to do with it.
[03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.930]  Sure.
[03:48:36.069 --> 03:48:40.110]  So Infowars is a clearinghouse for lies and nonsense in a bad way.
[03:48:40.329 --> 03:48:44.870]  Like, the garbage that they've put out over the last two decades has really hurt a lot of people.
[03:48:45.190 --> 03:48:49.510]  You know, they've targeted the families of the Sandy Hook victims.
[03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:50.190]  No, they didn't.
[03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:53.750]  That's what led to that defamation case that allowed this to be up for auction.
[03:48:54.540 --> 03:48:56.520]  We do lies and garbage in a different way.
[03:48:56.719 --> 03:48:58.020]  We have a lot more fun with it than they do.
[03:48:58.180 --> 03:49:03.520]  We're very excited to take it over and, you know, create a new, better path for this website.
[03:49:03.739 --> 03:49:05.420]  And the Sandy Hook family support this move?
[03:49:05.620 --> 03:49:06.020]  Absolutely.
[03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:07.239]  They were behind this.
[03:49:07.399 --> 03:49:11.239]  And, you know, Ben and I may seem like strange bedfellows.
[03:49:11.399 --> 03:49:11.719]  The Onion...
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:13.700]  And every town.
[03:49:13.940 --> 03:49:19.139]  But the truth is, we've got at our fingertips the facts, the stories, the data, the research.
[03:49:19.420 --> 03:49:30.159]  But what they've got is a really broad audience and humor, which is what you need sometimes to break through the misinformation, the fear that is so permeated mainstream thinking.
[03:49:30.479 --> 03:49:38.680]  Overnight, the judge in charge of this put a hold on your purchase, raising questions about the process, raising questions about transparency in the bidding process.
[03:49:38.899 --> 03:49:39.760]  What do you make of that?
[03:49:39.819 --> 03:49:41.299]  Are you confident this is still going to go through?
[03:49:41.540 --> 03:49:42.540]  Yeah, look, we won the bid.
[03:49:42.940 --> 03:49:46.079]  We own InfoWars, and we are very excited about that.
[03:49:46.139 --> 03:49:47.340]  But is it true that you didn't have the highest bid?
[03:49:47.899 --> 03:49:53.360]  We did have the highest bid when you take into account the family's concessions here.
[03:49:53.479 --> 03:49:59.180]  They made a concerted effort to make this the best and highest bid for everybody involved.
[03:49:59.780 --> 03:50:02.059]  So we're very excited to take that over.
[03:50:02.159 --> 03:50:03.959]  And look, it's Alex Jones.
[03:50:05.420 --> 03:50:09.979]  If he just handled this graciously and moved away, that would be the funniest part of this whole situation.
[03:50:10.459 --> 03:50:12.940]  Obviously, that is not something that he's going to do in this situation.
[03:50:13.059 --> 03:50:14.479]  So you're confident this is going to go through?
[03:50:14.700 --> 03:50:14.879]  Absolutely.
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:17.620]  And what role is Everytown for Gun Safety going to play in all this?
[03:50:17.620 --> 03:50:18.940]  We're going to be the main advertisers.
[03:50:19.500 --> 03:50:26.079]  And that means anything from a banner ad to a link to video to creating content together.
[03:50:26.459 --> 03:50:31.319]  And the goal here is really to cut through the misinformation and the fear.
[03:50:31.420 --> 03:50:36.540]  You know, the American public, every poll shows that they believe In gun safety.
[03:50:36.799 --> 03:50:45.280]  But what's happened is misinformation, hate, fear has so permeated thinking in this country that it's really distorted reality.
[03:50:45.280 --> 03:50:49.399]  And we're going to use humor to cut through that and to set the record straight.
[03:50:49.559 --> 03:50:51.219]  That's the best way to stop Alex Jones?
[03:50:51.459 --> 03:50:52.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:53.639]  I used to be a disinformation reporter.
[03:50:53.819 --> 03:50:55.379]  I used to cover him from the other side of this.
[03:50:55.780 --> 03:50:59.459]  You can present as many facts as you want to Alex Jones himself, and he's just not going to listen.
[03:51:00.159 --> 03:51:14.899]  But if you make fun of these people in a way that cuts through, and if you maybe show a funhouse mirror basically to what he's trying to do, trying to get you really afraid so you can buy some supplements, maybe if we rip the facade off this thing, show the wires underneath it, maybe we can make some real change.
[03:51:14.899 --> 03:51:16.739]  He's spread his funds out all over the place.
[03:51:16.799 --> 03:51:18.659]  Is there any real way to stop him?
[03:51:19.789 --> 03:51:20.709]  You can try.
[03:51:21.290 --> 03:51:23.190]  It's not worth it giving up, in my opinion.
[03:51:23.610 --> 03:51:25.290]  I think that's what the reaction was yesterday.
[03:51:25.290 --> 03:51:26.770]  You didn't believe it when you saw your phone.
[03:51:26.930 --> 03:51:28.729]  But maybe you felt like, oh man, that's pretty funny.
[03:51:28.969 --> 03:51:30.069]  There's some hope in this.
[03:51:31.909 --> 03:51:35.469]  It's felt pretty hopeless in the last couple of months recently for a lot of people.
[03:51:35.790 --> 03:51:38.149]  And we wanted to say, actually, good things can happen.
[03:51:39.090 --> 03:51:41.489]  There can be a good fight to win.
[03:51:41.610 --> 03:51:42.809]  And that's why we wanted to be here.
[03:51:43.159 --> 03:51:47.479]  Yeah, the bottom line for this is, when you think about Alex Jones, this is karmic justice.
[03:51:47.879 --> 03:51:52.920]  The idea that every town would be taking over all the advertising of Infowars.
[03:51:53.100 --> 03:51:54.079]  After all that disinformation.
[03:51:54.459 --> 03:51:57.500]  After all that disinformation, after calling Sandy Hook a hoax.
[03:51:58.100 --> 03:51:59.440]  Thank you both for coming in today.
[03:51:59.680 --> 03:51:59.860]  Thanks.
[03:52:00.659 --> 03:52:05.139]  All right, so the whole Sandy Hook thing is a big Democrat Party, anti-gun, anti-free speech combine.
[03:52:05.819 --> 03:52:11.420]  When I go back live today at 4, I'm live right now, but in 10 minutes, this live show ends and will restream from the start.
[03:52:11.559 --> 03:52:18.379]  Really key information the first hour, especially about 30 minutes into it, because all this was breaking and I was digesting it and processing it then.
[03:52:18.620 --> 03:52:21.860]  When I go live at 4 o'clock, I'm going to go through that piece by piece.
[03:52:21.979 --> 03:52:25.260]  You can teach a college course on lies and how the deep state works.
[03:52:25.659 --> 03:52:27.440]  So, this big Democrat Party...
[03:52:28.450 --> 03:52:43.819]  Gun control, anti-free speech groups merging MSNBC disinformation specialists Merging to be the advertisers of the new Infowars and to take my identity, he said that in other interviews and in a press release,
[03:52:44.299 --> 03:52:45.520]  and misrepresent me.
[03:52:46.180 --> 03:52:50.040]  They've tried in court positioning this to say they own my name and they want my identity.
[03:52:50.239 --> 03:52:52.139]  I've told you the whole time that's what this is.
[03:52:52.700 --> 03:52:53.319]  Silence me.
[03:52:53.659 --> 03:52:54.520]  Create a strong man.
[03:52:54.700 --> 03:52:55.280]  Demonize me.
[03:52:55.639 --> 03:52:56.719]  Kill the folk hero idea.
[03:52:57.100 --> 03:52:58.600]  Kill the legend.
[03:52:58.840 --> 03:52:59.899]  This is how things work.
[03:53:00.100 --> 03:53:01.020]  The mythology.
[03:53:02.100 --> 03:53:04.819]  And There he is.
[03:53:04.979 --> 03:53:05.819]  Oh, we own it.
[03:53:05.899 --> 03:53:06.299]  We have it.
[03:53:06.399 --> 03:53:06.579]  Really?
[03:53:06.700 --> 03:53:08.200]  Is that why it was given back to me today?
[03:53:08.479 --> 03:53:10.979]  Is that why Infowars.com is back up, buddy?
[03:53:12.680 --> 03:53:13.899]  Is that why that is?
[03:53:14.059 --> 03:53:16.520]  Is that why you stumbled when you said you had the highest bid?
[03:53:17.559 --> 03:53:23.760]  They pledged my money to them to buy it in the future.
[03:53:23.940 --> 03:53:25.260]  The judge didn't say that in the auction.
[03:53:25.420 --> 03:53:26.159]  It was cash.
[03:53:26.440 --> 03:53:28.260]  And he hadn't even authorized the auction.
[03:53:28.459 --> 03:53:29.540]  The hearing happened yesterday.
[03:53:30.260 --> 03:53:37.399]  And there they are this morning, up on television, And then Stephanopoulos, he spread his money out everywhere.
[03:53:37.659 --> 03:53:38.760]  Remember that story?
[03:53:39.100 --> 03:53:41.840]  Jones has $360 million hidden.
[03:53:41.979 --> 03:53:42.959]  His parents have it.
[03:53:43.059 --> 03:53:43.540]  Sue them.
[03:53:43.860 --> 03:53:44.540]  Attack them.
[03:53:44.719 --> 03:53:45.940]  Make them be audited.
[03:53:47.540 --> 03:53:53.360]  Turned out my dad and the supplement company overpaid me $400,000 over a few years.
[03:53:54.200 --> 03:53:56.540]  And he has no money.
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:00.020]  And there was less than a million dollars at the start of all this in the company.
[03:54:02.739 --> 03:54:04.399]  So, in Dr.
[03:54:04.479 --> 03:54:09.159]  Jones Naturals, in his company, that's the website, PQPR. So that's the initials of his grandparents.
[03:54:09.979 --> 03:54:21.860]  And there he is with the old lie, and the other prosecutor that runs all this, that's the head lawyer, he's a former Democrat prosecutor, he gets up and says, Alex Jones is a crook, his business is corrupt.
[03:54:22.219 --> 03:54:25.799]  Hey, how you like defamation suits, big guy, your lesson's about to begin.
[03:54:26.610 --> 03:54:31.930]  So that's why you go to fight4alex.com and you donate not just to defense.
[03:54:32.010 --> 03:54:33.489]  We've gone on offense.
[03:54:33.809 --> 03:54:36.190]  Month ago, filed countersuits, all of it.
[03:54:36.409 --> 03:54:37.889]  Haven't heard a word, have you?
[03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:43.350]  Just like the media isn't announcing that it's been, Infoward's been given back to me.
[03:54:45.010 --> 03:54:45.790]  For now.
[03:54:46.510 --> 03:54:50.569]  But have I been accurate or have they been accurate?
[03:54:50.969 --> 03:54:53.030]  Did I tell you Monday I think that it's a fraud?
[03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:54.110]  They're going to take it over.
[03:54:55.600 --> 03:54:57.420]  Told my lawyers, I bet they don't even pay money for it.
[03:54:58.299 --> 03:55:05.260]  And then now the big Democrat Soros gun control group, that's who funds that and runs that, is behind this.
[03:55:06.139 --> 03:55:10.879]  It wants the name Infowars.com to run around like my head on a pole.
[03:55:10.979 --> 03:55:11.739]  We got him.
[03:55:11.879 --> 03:55:13.079]  We got the Roman standard.
[03:55:13.260 --> 03:55:14.079]  Oh, we got him.
[03:55:14.579 --> 03:55:15.399]  Hip, hip, hooray.
[03:55:17.930 --> 03:55:20.450]  I mean, is that not incredible?
[03:55:21.409 --> 03:55:23.309]  Jones has his money all spread out.
[03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:25.049]  Hey, Stephanopoulos, you didn't get the memo.
[03:55:25.129 --> 03:55:26.290]  Show the New York Times if you can find it.
[03:55:26.889 --> 03:55:27.750]  A couple months ago.
[03:55:28.049 --> 03:55:29.909]  Turns out Jones had meager assets.
[03:55:30.129 --> 03:55:31.889]  Turns out Jones never had all that money.
[03:55:31.969 --> 03:55:33.170]  I can't believe they even admitted it.
[03:55:35.069 --> 03:55:39.329]  I told you at the trials, the show trials, they're like, you have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:55:41.250 --> 03:55:42.489]  Actually, I'm in bankruptcy.
[03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:43.329]  I'm negative.
[03:55:43.530 --> 03:55:44.290]  That's a lie.
[03:55:44.530 --> 03:55:46.729]  You just think you get up here and say things that makes it true.
[03:55:46.850 --> 03:55:48.229]  The judge said, you are lying.
[03:55:49.889 --> 03:55:51.350]  You are not bankrupt.
[03:55:51.829 --> 03:56:00.989]  Last time I heard, being in the hole and being under attack and bringing in less money than you got is bankrupt.
[03:56:01.250 --> 03:56:03.229]  And I am officially bankrupt.
[03:56:04.129 --> 03:56:06.409]  I am officially out of personal bankruptcy.
[03:56:09.399 --> 03:56:12.420]  And they got it all, which I don't give a rat's ass about.
[03:56:12.780 --> 03:56:17.659]  A tiny lake house that I used to live in that I never had time to go to.
[03:56:19.079 --> 03:56:21.979]  A little farm in case we had an emergency to go to.
[03:56:22.319 --> 03:56:23.139]  Never had time to go there.
[03:56:23.479 --> 03:56:23.719]  Beautiful.
[03:56:24.260 --> 03:56:25.659]  On the San Marcos River.
[03:56:27.780 --> 03:56:30.319]  Bought it like six years ago, went there like ten times.
[03:56:33.219 --> 03:56:34.020]  It meant nothing.
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:37.340]  That's what you got, a few million dollars.
[03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:43.190]  And see, remember they said in federal and state court, they go, Mr.
[03:56:43.270 --> 03:56:44.670]  Jones, what'd you do with that $9 million Bitcoin donation?
[03:56:44.829 --> 03:56:47.350]  I said, I put it all in the company.
[03:56:47.430 --> 03:56:48.129]  Well, what'd you do with it?
[03:56:48.270 --> 03:56:49.290]  I mean, I put it in the company.
[03:56:49.409 --> 03:56:50.709]  We had shortfalls.
[03:56:50.809 --> 03:56:51.389]  Some people needed money.
[03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:52.250]  It helped keep us on air.
[03:56:52.809 --> 03:56:53.209]  Uh-huh.
[03:56:53.370 --> 03:56:54.329]  You didn't put it right in your pocket?
[03:56:55.170 --> 03:57:02.870]  And I went, yeah, I bought a $25,000 video console editing system for my show at my house.
[03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:06.129]  Oh, so you, yeah, it was for being on air, yeah.
[03:57:06.870 --> 03:57:08.909]  Well, Okay.
[03:57:08.909 --> 03:57:12.209]  Well, you know, the Justice Department doesn't believe you, and you're going to be talking to some people.
[03:57:12.250 --> 03:57:14.610]  This is on national TV. I'm just like, go ahead, Justice Department all day.
[03:57:15.770 --> 03:57:18.709]  I could have kept all the $9 million it was given to me personally.
[03:57:19.229 --> 03:57:26.770]  They couldn't believe that I would give $9 million to stay on air and fight these people and have victory, and now Trump's in.
[03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:28.350]  I mean, what do you think I'm doing here?
[03:57:28.750 --> 03:57:29.729]  I'm for real.
[03:57:30.809 --> 03:57:33.129]  But Stephanopoulos, his money's spread out everywhere.
[03:57:33.329 --> 03:57:33.850]  Oh, yeah.
[03:57:35.290 --> 03:57:35.649]  Yeah.
[03:57:36.930 --> 03:57:39.290]  I love this mail-order $25 shirt.
[03:57:39.450 --> 03:57:40.170]  Looks pretty good, doesn't it?
[03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:42.290]  I don't give a damn.
[03:57:42.850 --> 03:57:58.530]  I care about freedom and victory and not surrendering and not backing down, and I've got an audience of badass people more and more getting off the bench and sharing our information and praying for us and defending us and defending Trump and buying products at thealexlumstore.com, which they hate because you're going to love them,
[03:57:58.569 --> 03:58:03.870]  and donating to our Gibson Go for the legal offensive at fightforalex.com.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:08.180]  And we've only begun to fight, to quote John Paul Jones.
[03:58:08.280 --> 03:58:11.559]  All right, I didn't get to the CDC head attacking Kennedy.
[03:58:11.659 --> 03:58:12.260]  I'll do that.
[03:58:12.360 --> 03:58:14.260]  I'll get to everything I didn't get to and more that's breaking.
[03:58:14.319 --> 03:58:18.159]  And I'll have updates for you in one hour and three minutes.
[03:58:19.139 --> 03:58:22.920]  But I'm going to leave the streams going at Real Alex Jones and Alex Jones Network.
[03:58:24.719 --> 03:58:29.139]  We're going to put the streams out at band.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:58:30.440 --> 03:58:32.959]  And we're going to put it out on Infowars.com.
[03:58:33.020 --> 03:58:34.780]  That's where you'll get that stream.
[03:58:35.319 --> 03:58:36.280]  That's where you'll find it.
[03:58:36.360 --> 03:58:37.959]  You go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:58:38.579 --> 03:58:39.760]  Did we check Band.Video?
[03:58:39.899 --> 03:58:40.780]  Did they turn that back on?
[03:58:40.840 --> 03:58:41.520]  They turned it off yesterday?
[03:58:42.440 --> 03:58:43.440]  Oh, it's up.
[03:58:43.680 --> 03:58:44.760]  So we'll stream on that.
[03:58:45.540 --> 03:58:46.440]  Band.Video.
[03:58:46.739 --> 03:58:47.420]  Band is the word.
[03:58:47.579 --> 03:58:48.120]  Band.Video.
[03:58:48.760 --> 03:58:51.420]  And Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:58:52.840 --> 03:59:01.620]  And InfoWars on X. And then we'll just let tens of millions more pour into the streams of this looping, looping, looping, looping.
[03:59:01.680 --> 03:59:03.620]  Then I'll come tomorrow to another live show and Sunday.
[03:59:03.780 --> 03:59:07.620]  And then we'll get Harrison, everybody back in here Monday in the regular studios.
[03:59:09.020 --> 03:59:10.399]  God knows what they're going to pull though.
[03:59:10.559 --> 03:59:11.600]  I don't think they're beat yet.
[03:59:11.799 --> 03:59:14.280]  We're winning battles, but we haven't won the war.
[03:59:14.420 --> 03:59:16.440]  That's why we fight, fight, fight.
[03:59:17.639 --> 03:59:18.780]  I salute the crew.
[03:59:19.000 --> 03:59:22.860]  I thank God for providence and pray for more divine protection.
[03:59:23.500 --> 03:59:25.319]  Humbly on my knees, Father.
[03:59:26.459 --> 03:59:27.299]  God bless you.
[03:59:34.190 --> 03:59:41.709]  Hey, this is Jeff with DMO Knives and we're proud to come back to you with our second partnership with Alex Jones.

[04:01:21.780 --> 04:01:26.620]  American made by American people right here at our workshop in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[04:01:27.000 --> 04:01:29.319]  They are built to never fail the operator.
[04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:54.430]  Americans know in their gut that the despotism demonically possessing the federal government is only getting started.
[04:01:54.670 --> 04:02:01.610]  According to the FBI, Chinese hackers have prepared a barrage of imminent strikes on critical US infrastructure.
[04:02:01.950 --> 04:02:05.790]  The purpose of the hacking was not to gather intelligence.
[04:02:06.270 --> 04:02:14.709]  The purpose was to install malware that once activated would disrupt or damage the infrastructure.
[04:02:15.360 --> 04:02:27.979]  Meanwhile, the effects of China's biological warfare via COVID-19 and the resulting now blatant evidence of a genocidal vaccine rollout of epic proportions enters a new chapter.
[04:02:28.319 --> 04:02:31.780]  The Australian Bureau of Statistics is our statistical agency.
[04:02:32.659 --> 04:02:39.979]  It shows, its own figures now show around about 26,000 deaths, excess deaths for 2022.
[04:02:40.020 --> 04:02:42.299]  And no one is asking why.
[04:02:42.549 --> 04:02:48.729]  Another conspiracy theory becomes reality as AstraZeneca is now pulling its COVID vaccine from the market.
[04:02:48.989 --> 04:02:50.850]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[04:02:51.809 --> 04:02:56.850]  And it is self-assembling nanotech in the body.
[04:02:57.049 --> 04:03:06.649]  And we were finding this stuff decades ago, but right when they rolled out the COVID hysteria four years ago, we had all the literature and they were keeping secret what was in the Pfizer shots and the Moderna shots and the rest of it.
[04:03:08.050 --> 04:03:13.809]  But whistleblowers actually released, it's later been confirmed, what was in it, and it was a giant test.
[04:03:13.950 --> 04:03:17.950]  They were changing thousands of times at Moderna and Pfizer run by the Pentagon.
[04:03:18.250 --> 04:03:19.209]  They were just front companies.
[04:03:20.530 --> 04:03:24.270]  What they were putting in it, they were testing all sorts of stuff.
[04:03:25.079 --> 04:03:29.040]  Ebola, Marburg, all sorts of bird flesh.
[04:03:29.579 --> 04:03:34.000]  As Natural News reports, world-renowned Belgian virologist Dr.
[04:03:34.200 --> 04:03:53.340]  Geert van den Bosch predicted a soon-coming massive tsunami of illness and death among those who got vaccinated, unleashing a wave of long COVID that will overwhelm the healthcare sector, not to mention the economy-wide impact in terms of eventual total economic failure and social chaos.
[04:03:53.760 --> 04:03:55.719]  The truth will surface.
[04:03:56.120 --> 04:04:02.399]  This has been a large-scale experiment of gain of function.
[04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:05.030]  On the very human population.
[04:04:05.190 --> 04:04:12.469]  As the lights are turned on and the vaccine roaches are scurrying, the panic goes live and the big guns are put into play.
[04:04:12.909 --> 04:04:25.989]  As Adan Salazar reported, a top meteorologist is warning government weather modification could unintentionally spark conflicts between nations where weather would be used in warfare among countries.
[04:04:26.170 --> 04:04:32.850]  Plots, droughts and wildfires last year were just a preview of what is to come.
[04:04:33.200 --> 04:04:47.659]  According to Kister senior meteorologist John Jacques, the cloud-seeding debacle that precipitated the Dubai floods should serve as a reminder that government influence on the weather can lead to consequences that aren't fully predictable.
[04:04:48.280 --> 04:04:59.440]  Jacques says if we're not careful, unrestrained use of this technology could end up causing diplomatic instabilities with neighboring countries engaging in tit-for-tat weather wars.
[04:04:59.639 --> 04:05:01.879]  Pay insufficient attention.
[04:05:02.709 --> 04:05:17.709]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[04:05:17.930 --> 04:05:21.110]  Power outages they blame on the Russians, cyber attacks, they're going to go for broke.
[04:05:21.250 --> 04:05:23.850]  We are on the edge of just a nightmare situation.
[04:05:23.909 --> 04:05:33.110]  But if the governors and the legislatures and the people and the Republicans that are awake, that's about half of them in power, see this and address this as it really is, the globalists are done.
[04:05:33.229 --> 04:05:39.090]  They're going to have a cyber attack, a cyber attack, claiming Russia working with Trump supporters just took down the East Coast grid.
[04:05:39.799 --> 04:05:46.040]  I told you that two years ago, and then a year later, the FBI goes, we've got intel that the Russians with Trump supporters are going to cut the power.
[04:05:46.559 --> 04:05:47.860]  I'm in their mind, folks.
[04:05:47.940 --> 04:05:48.420]  I've got them.
[04:05:48.500 --> 04:05:48.940]  I've got them.
[04:05:49.159 --> 04:05:54.819]  The minute you see Trump hit the ground, the false flags, the power outages, the cyber attacks.
[04:05:55.020 --> 04:05:56.120]  I want to get back to the global
