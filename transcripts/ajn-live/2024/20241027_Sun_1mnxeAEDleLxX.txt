[00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.099]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, the Alex Jones Network tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.660]  You're listening to Alex Jones Live.
[00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.269]  And as I said, ladies and gentlemen, it is Saturday, October 26, 2024.
[00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.670]  I am your embattled host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the Alex Jones Network.
[00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.670]  Thank you so much for joining us this evening.
[00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.109]  All right, this is going to be a quick, fast-paced emergency.
[00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.829]  News transmission will still probably take a little over an hour because I've got a whole bunch of what I think are the very best things that were talked about, most important things.
[00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:52.890]  An incredible Joe Rogan interview yesterday here in South Austin with the real President of the United States, Donald Trump.
[00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.109]  We are nine days out from the election, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.869]  Now, that's going to be the main body of the transmission here tonight.
[00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.729]  That's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.650]  We'll go through those clips and I'll give you my take and analysis of it.
[00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.989]  But also something really huge happened today.
[00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.250]  You know, I've been working with Dale Bigtree and his great team of just some of the top filmmakers and researchers out there, like the great Mickey Willis.
[00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.069]  And this morning I was meeting with those folks and Dale's on the show.
[00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.810]  Dale Bigtree's on the show coming up on Monday in studio.
[00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.489]  He's also with the great Higher Wire Transmission based here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.260]  And they said, hey, why don't you just go ahead and put out the new Maha ads that they put out, public information ads that Elon Musk funded.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.519]  And I said, absolutely, let me see them.
[00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.819]  These are hands down the most truthful, accurate, and best produced ads I've seen so far.
[00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:51.159]  They've already put out some amazing ones.
[00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:57.379]  We've exclusively posted four of those at Real Alex Jones, and they'll be dropping everywhere else tonight.
[00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.500]  I want you to...
[00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.840]  Download them, repost them to your channel, not just retweet us.
[00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.340]  I don't care about the credit.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.200]  They don't care about the credit.
[00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.560]  They just want to warn the people.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.599]  It's on World War III. One of the ads is the plan to draft women that's public unanimously by the Democrats.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.699]  That's a pretty big deal.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.560]  They're not talking about.
[00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:26.919]  There's also another one exposing the incredible police state, witch-like nature of Kamala Harris and just how truly vicious she is to minorities, women, and parents as well, when she was number two in charge of California and what she still believes today.
[00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:37.930]  There's also another one exposing, that's probably the most powerful, all the lies or just a large selection of lies and hoaxes against President Trump by the enemy of the people of the corporate media.
[00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.990]  Another one getting into what the repeal of Roe v.
[00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.949]  Wade really did that shows how a lot of leftists and women have been gaslit.
[00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.800]  That's just Four of the ads, more are coming in the next few days with nine days left of this incredibly important election.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.680]  So there's that as well, but I'm not going to play those here.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.500]  They're incredible.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.240]  If you want to see them, they're at Real Alex Jones right now.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.960]  Go get those and share them.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.360]  And again, download them, re-upload them to your channel.
[00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.659]  That gets even more reach.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.680]  Just get them out.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.300]  Post them on every other platform, Facebook.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.879]  Instagram, Google, YouTube, TikTok.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.639]  This is an information war.
[00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.419]  The real power lies with the people.
[00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.120]  And when you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.240]  We're reaching conservatively right now, just at Infowars, 100 million extra people a week on top of a regular audience of 20 million a day or so.
[00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.800]  And 100 million is a conservative estimate.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.979]  That credit goes to you, the audience of activists, men and women of every race, color, and creed who are in the arena, and I salute you.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.599]  Also, for people wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses, it happens pretty much like clockwork at the last two elections, four years ago and eight years ago.
[00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:52.300]  I get so fired up and so stressed out that my Right eye always blows out for a few days, and I had a blood vessel burst yesterday on air because I was so fired up.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.780]  So for all my enemies dreaming me of having a heart attack because I get so fired up, well, not a heart attack, but an eye attack.
[00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:06.379]  So you got me going Joe Cool here because the light's a little bit painful on my eye, though it's already turned the corner and is getting better, but that's...
[00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.120]  Kind of like an egg timer.
[00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:14.879]  When you're in a critical election like this, with everything on the line, I get so fired up that only two other times in my life has done this.
[00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.199]  And it was right before the 2016 election, as you saw on air famously.
[00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.579]  You got news reports then.
[00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.379]  And four years ago, it also happened again.
[00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.720]  And here we are, 10 days out yesterday, and it happens yet again.
[00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.560]  So there you go.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.160]  Kind of scary for Halloween there.
[00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:30.160]  All right.
[00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.579]  Now, let's go ahead and plow right into it.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.540]  Overhead shot.
[00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:35.759]  Boom.
[00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.300]  Just call it a glitch.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:48.240]  Pennsylvania's online registry that officials use to determine who is registering to vote crashed yesterday while a statewide investigation is going in multiple counties.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:05:04.160]  In just one county alone, they found over 2,000-plus ballots that are fake, where people, an organized group, We're good to go.
[00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.509]  If you want to go pull that up, just a Pennsylvania election database glitch.
[00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:35.149]  But who said two months ago that they thought the evil Russians or someone would go and disrupt the election and all over the country, the feds predicted, target the voter integrity computers of states that have in the databases who are registered voters and who aren't voters.
[00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:37.290]  Now, remember what happened four years ago.
[00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:44.930]  Republicans in different counties in Michigan said, and other states, counties, said, we had a bunch of people that weren't on the voter rolls that were still voting.
[00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.709]  We don't know how they got voter registration cards that were not in the voter rolls.
[00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:57.920]  And Michigan denied that, and the Soros Attorney General there denied it, and Governor Whitmer denied it, and then staged a fake kidnapping against herself and all the rest of the same FBI. They said that's not true.
[00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.100]  Well, two weeks ago, the Republicans had paid to do the canvas and check the computers and the state database.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.439]  By law, they were allowed to.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.300]  The Democrats fought it.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:15.259]  And they found that 500,000-plus phantom voters that had never voted before and that shouldn't be in the database were on the database but weren't registered voters.
[00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.699]  And Michigan said, we're going to let that go forward and maybe fix it.
[00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.410]  Down the road.
[00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.750]  Also, you have the Texas Attorney General three weeks ago saying, yeah, the Fed's threatened us, so we're going to let people vote with non-citizen IDs who are illegal aliens.
[00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.209]  So, get that straight.
[00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.110]  It's going on.
[00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:36.089]  The Fed's threatened a bunch of people, federal judges in Alabama and Georgia and a bunch of other states, made them put illegals back on the...
[00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.110]  So the good news is we're forcing all this out in the open.
[00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:42.470]  The bad news is the fraud is still continuing.
[00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.589]  And here are the articles.
[00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.810]  One of them is directly from Homeland Security and the FBI. Feds deliver stark warnings to state election officials ahead of November.
[00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.529]  This is back in February, right through August.
[00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.449]  I'll show you the articles.
[00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:01.310]  And they said, oh, the cyber terrorists will target the databases so that fraudulent voters can vote.
[00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.769]  Well, who's always getting caught doing that?
[00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.009]  Here it is.
[00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:12.610]  CISA and FBI released joint PSA putting potential DDoS attacks during the 2024 election cycle in context.
[00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.589]  That's from CISA.gov.
[00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.209]  And the federal government saying, again, they're going to attack the voter integrity databases.
[00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.230]  Oh, who does that help?
[00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:25.350]  FBI and CISA warn of threats to election systems that could compromise voters.
[00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.170]  And it goes on to say the databases so that frauds can vote.
[00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.449]  So that's a big deal.
[00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:56.899]  And then we've got this big news that broke yesterday, and magically the database of the state went down as more of the counties, they've now found three counties since this broke, that had a whole bunch of organized fraud, thousands and thousands per county that they've caught, sending in bundles of voter registrations to get people on The voter rolls who they go and contact the people and know they never did that.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.459]  So this is fraud.
[00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.139]  In some cases, it's not even real people's names.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.420]  We've seen that in California and Oregon where a cat is registered to vote.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.980]  So some of that stuff going on.
[00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:12.379]  I want to play you just one of the clips out of Pennsylvania in just one city and one county.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:23.019]  Where I was just five weeks ago with Tucker Carlson, because the event was in Redding, but it was actually, we stayed in the town 30 miles away, and that's actually where this is going on.
[00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:26.480]  So let's go ahead and play a clip from that press conference yesterday in Pennsylvania.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.139]  Here it is.
[00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.180]  Good morning, everyone.
[00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.459]  District Attorney Heather Adams.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:42.440]  On Tuesday afternoon, I was contacted by Krista Miller, who is our chief clerk of elections regarding potentially fraudulent voter registration applications that had recently been received by her office.
[00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:53.360]  At that time, she informed me that the elections office received approximately 2,500 applications at or near the deadline for registering to vote.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:13.490]  While preparing to process these applications, staff noticed that numerous applications Some of them appeared to have the same handwriting, were filled out on the same day with unknown signatures, and some were previously registered voters, and the signatures on file did not match the signatures on the application.
[00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:24.750]  So before I begin to summarize our preliminary findings, I must remind everyone that this is an ongoing investigation, and for that reason I will be limited in the details that I can provide.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:34.820]  Lancaster County detectives began investigating the voter registration applications and immediately found applications that were indeed fraudulent.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:47.360]  Indicators of fraud included inaccuracies with the addresses listed on the applications, false personal identification information, as well as false names.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.980]  A number of the applications also contained names that did not match the provided Social Security information.
[00:09:54.679 --> 00:10:08.179]  In some cases, applications contained correct personal identification information, such as the correct address, correct phone number, date of birth, driver's license number, and Social Security number.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:19.879]  But the individuals listed on the applications informed detectives that they did not request the form, they did not complete the form, And verify that the signature on the form was not theirs.
[00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:32.159]  At this point, it is believed that the fraudulent voter registrations are connected to a large-scale canvassing operations for voter registrations that date back to June.
[00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:38.320]  However, the majority of the applications received are dated August 15th and after.
[00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:45.620]  Those canvassing for voter registrations were employed and paid to obtain voter registration applications.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.799]  The majority of the applications were from residents in the City of Lancaster.
[00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:57.279]  However, applications were also received from residents in Columbia, Elizabethtown, Mt.
[00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:04.279]  Joy, Akron, Ephrata, Stevens, Strasburg, as well as other locations across Lancaster County.
[00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:14.279]  The canvases themselves took place at various shopping centers, parking lots of grocery stores and businesses, sidewalks and parks.
[00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:21.340]  During this preliminary investigation, detectives were able to verify some of the applications were indeed legitimate.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.940]  In these instances, the applicant verified that they did provide information to a canvasser.
[00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:38.740]  For these applications, we will immediately advise voter registration and that we confirm that they are legitimate requests and voter registration will process that application.
[00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:48.539]  Thus far, of the investigations that we have completed, we have determined that 60% have been fraudulent.
[00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:50.720]  That is of the investigations that we've completed.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:12:01.919]  We do have more to do today, and my understanding is that voter registration is still going through the box of 2500, but should be completed sometime here today.
[00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.049]  As I said, the investigation is ongoing.
[00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:11.870]  We are aware of at least two other counties that receive similar applications that are currently being investigated.
[00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:17.909]  At this point, we have confirmed violation of our crimes code as well as our elections code.
[00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:22.289]  We have all available detectives working on this.
[00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.809]  We are all hands on deck so that we can properly assess the validity of these applications in a timely manner.
[00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:32.460]  If needed, we will request additional assistance from our local police departments.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.519]  Go back real quickly to the SURE database.
[00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:43.080]  One of the things that's curious about that is we have a statewide effort right now where we're checking mail-in ballot applications.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.620]  And we're checking to make sure that the people are residents and that they're qualified electors.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.600]  And we're also checking that they're in the SURE database.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.460]  And just today, you know, while the SURE database was up, we get daily reports of mail-in ballots.
[00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:05.669]  We found 200 just in our county Mail-in ballot applicants that weren't on the SURE database.
[00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:08.009]  This is happening throughout the state.
[00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:14.090]  Chester County, we've got people checking Montgomery, Fayette, Westmoreland, Washington County.
[00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:26.629]  So we have people all over the state checking these mail-in ballot applications and there's a very, very big disparity between people who are being sent mail-in ballots and people who are actually on the voter rolls.
[00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:31.029]  So, a little bit suspicious that we've been filing these letters every day.
[00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:40.309]  We informed Our county, that there was 200 people that had been approved for mail-in ballots that weren't even on the voter registration database.
[00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:43.889]  So in my opinion, the timing is suspect on that.
[00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.990]  And I think they've pulled out all of the stops on cheating in this election.
[00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.950]  And I don't know how much time we have, but we can talk about other issues there as well.
[00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.419]  Well, we have about a minute.
[00:13:57.559 --> 00:14:04.840]  I just want to get to the fact that everyone is celebrating the early voting data, particularly in the state of Pennsylvania more than anywhere else.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:23.899]  But now the left and the corporate media has coined a new buzz phrase called a rural tsunami, suggesting that the Trump voters have already come out to vote in early voting, which sounds to me like they're laying the groundwork to say that his same-day voting is not going to be as overwhelming as it typically is.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.539]  It's election-day voting.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.559]  Well, there's competing opinions on that.
[00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:33.320]  My opinion varies from others.
[00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:48.350]  I think people should show up on election day and vote in person because we have a lot more visibility at the precinct level into the audits and able to do recounts and be able to You know, audit the vote.
[00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:59.789]  As opposed to voting in early, all ballots are processed into a centralized counting center that's a black box, which for the past four years we haven't had visibility into.
[00:15:00.049 --> 00:15:07.009]  So if they do cheat, which I expect they're going to, then we're not going to have any visibility for all those early voters.
[00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.970]  I hope it works out, but I have, I strongly doubt that it will.
[00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:13.950]  We all hope it works out.
[00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:15.590]  We're all praying it works out.
[00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:24.129]  And I know you're doing your best to create a contingency plan with your Supreme Court filing that if it doesn't, that it actually has to be investigated.
[00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:25.570]  Thank you so much, Greg Stentrum.
[00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.370]  You can go to theparallelelection.com to learn more about he and Leah's work.
[00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:30.830]  Leah couldn't join us today, unfortunately.
[00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:39.309]  Or you can go to patriot.online where you can find the actual Supreme Court filing because Greg and Leah put everything up there, which is super helpful for all of us.
[00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:39.809]  Thanks, Greg.
[00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:41.330]  All right.
[00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.450]  And there's a lot more going on as well.
[00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.429]  That's why they're in such complete and total panic mode.
[00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.009]  Here's a headline.
[00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:56.250]  CNBC, Jeff Bezos killed Washington Post's endorsement of Kamala Harris paper reports.
[00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.330]  And you have the LA Times refusing to endorse her and hundreds of other big papers because...
[00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:08.309]  They can see the writing on the wall, a Trump win, unless the massive fraud is big enough for them to be able to override that.
[00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.110]  I don't think that's the case.
[00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.750]  So they've tried to kill Trump twice in the last four months that we know of.
[00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.529]  So she's going to lose.
[00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:22.389]  And remember, they had Hillary with a 98% chance going to beat Trump before.
[00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.409]  That was all a fraud.
[00:16:23.529 --> 00:16:25.350]  There wasn't as big a turnout for Trump in 2020.
[00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:27.710]  He still won, but not by a landslide.
[00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.649]  That's how they were able to steal it.
[00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.250]  But they don't have enough fraudulent voters and ballot stuffing and the rest of the scams.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.340]  If there's a landslide, all evidences will be a bigger landslide than 2016.
[00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:47.240]  Also, appeals court ruled yesterday all mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day in order to be counted.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:54.519]  But the Democrats are promising the election is going to go on for weeks after, and then they're going to try to stir up A lot of civil unrest.
[00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.940]  I believe states have false flags to blame Trump supporters.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.099]  And they say even if Trump gets elected, they're then going to have civil uprisings, armed uprisings that Carville's called for, James Carville.
[00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:13.339]  Raskin said they won't certify his election, so they're the ones that are going to try to Throw the country into civil unrest and they want civil war.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.279]  We're trying to stop that.
[00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.079]  Here's another report.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.640]  There's a video.
[00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:16.640]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:17.619]  I'm not going to play it here for time.
[00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.960]  Iowa poll watcher sounds alarm on illegal aliens being allowed to vote.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.319]  Well, yeah, I mean, Texas, not just blue states, is saying people can vote with non-citizen IDs.
[00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.920]  So this is all happening right now.
[00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:36.289]  Now, I want to go into the huge Joe Rogan-Trump interview yesterday that was over three hours long.
[00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.450]  We're not going to play three hours of it.
[00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:39.789]  We'll probably play about 25 minutes of it.
[00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:40.890]  Most of these clips are a minute long.
[00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.009]  Some are three or four minutes long.
[00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:44.289]  But they're all really, really important.
[00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.970]  But the first clip I want to play is not from the podcast...
[00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:52.519]  That taped in the afternoon yesterday and dropped at about 9 p.m.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.759]  Central at night.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.339]  It's already reached over 100 million people on different platforms.
[00:17:56.759 --> 00:18:03.519]  I want to play Sam Tripoli, a friend of mine, another talk show host, who was on Joe's show Friday.
[00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:06.440]  And I'd ask Joe personally.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.059]  He didn't get around to it.
[00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:09.720]  I understand a lot was going on.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.539]  But he did bring it up to Sam Tripoli at the start of the podcast.
[00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:18.819]  Friday, I talked to Joe Wednesday and Thursday and said, listen, you've got these martial law plans.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.779]  You've got these documents.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.380]  You've got Kamala getting the military ready to guard for American people.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:29.079]  You need to raise this to Trump because Kamala and Biden and all of them are saying Trump's going to use the military to kill people with no evidence.
[00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:35.160]  But for the first time in history, you've got the deep state preparing martial law for when Trump was president-elect, but they still have control.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.619]  He did raise it with Sam Tripoli, unfortunately not with Trump.
[00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:41.480]  So I want to play that clip first.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.779]  Here is Joe Rogan raising the subject with Sam Tripoli.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:53.740]  The thing that the Biden administration pushed through, this new martial law thing, this is very disturbing.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:12.980]  Jamie, please Google this so we can find out what the actual law states, but it's DOD Directive 5240.01, giving the Pentagon power, for the first time in history, to use lethal force to kill Americans on U.S. soil who protest government policies.
[00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.430]  What are they expecting?
[00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:20.089]  Is that what it is?
[00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:21.829]  Did I tell you what it is?
[00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.210]  I'm sorry.
[00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.650]  524.01.
[00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.549]  DoD directive.
[00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.990]  This is from RFK Jr.
[00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:34.690]  Posted this on Twitter and I'm finding out about it because people are blowing me up about it.
[00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.589]  That's fucking...
[00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:37.839]  Terrifying.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.940]  That is a terrifying thing to push through for the first time in U.S. history, giving the military the ability to shoot.
[00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:47.720]  So, see, that's how you get things done.
[00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:49.500]  Yeah, I blew him up about it and sent him all that.
[00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:52.519]  So, again, they're blaming Trump for that.
[00:19:53.279 --> 00:20:00.759]  Because they're planning to stage events or provocateur events, much worse than January 6th, or the fake Whitmer kidnapping plot that came out to be fake.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.380]  Guaranteed.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.299]  Because that's the final piece of the puzzle.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.059]  With no evidence, makes no sense.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.180]  Trump's going to use the military.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.980]  He's coming to kill the black men.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.000]  Carville, all of them been saying it.
[00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:10.680]  Biden, Harris.
[00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.599]  I mean, she said it like three more times last week.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.079]  I saw.
[00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.440]  Must be her standard thing.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.180]  People don't ask, why are you saying that?
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.680]  Well, they're signing orders, an executive order, that then the DOD put out a manual on.
[00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.150]  This is a big, big, big deal.
[00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:30.849]  So I'm glad that got out there, and it shows the power of being on air and our audience getting the word out.
[00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.589]  Now, RFK Jr.
[00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.990]  is covering.
[00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:33.329]  I'm told Trump's going to cover it soon.
[00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.170]  We've got to get ahead of this.
[00:20:35.329 --> 00:20:40.430]  All right, now let's get to the actual mega-podcast, Joe Rogan and President Trump.
[00:20:40.509 --> 00:20:47.049]  I'm going to play these clips and give you my brief comments on them, and you kind of get the boil-down synopsis here, but I suggest you watch the whole three hours.
[00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.369]  And I watched over two hours of it last night and then had to go to bed.
[00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:51.009]  I actually...
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.140]  I say Joe didn't cover it.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.220]  I had the crew watch the whole thing again, and they didn't see him talk about it with Trump.
[00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:57.240]  So maybe he did.
[00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:57.859]  Maybe I missed it.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.720]  But regardless, at least he covered it Friday.
[00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:04.640]  He taped it Thursday, aired triply Friday, and then I guess put two out Friday.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.880]  So it did get out there.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.700]  So good job, Joe Rogan.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.700]  Let's go to a really important point that more people aren't making, but finally they are.
[00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:17.470]  95%, look it up, of the corporate donations have been to Kamala Harris.
[00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.170]  Trump's average donation is less than $50.
[00:21:21.089 --> 00:21:23.069]  The entire corporate media is against Trump.
[00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:24.109]  Hollywood's against Trump.
[00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.250]  The big banks are against Trump.
[00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.549]  BlackRock's against Trump.
[00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.769]  The Justice Department's against Trump.
[00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.190]  And then they act like he's the establishment.
[00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.990]  And then Kamala says, if you're tired of the last four years, elect me.
[00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.730]  Well, Trump hasn't been in power for four years.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.819]  So it's just preposterous.
[00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:41.359]  Remember, she was installed, too, in a coup, totally illegal.
[00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:42.779]  That's just hiding in plain view.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.740]  That is the crazy town that we are in right now.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:54.099]  So the point is made that it is populist Republicans, not the blue-blood neocons, because we haven't taken the Republican Party over yet.
[00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:56.400]  The Democrat Party is pure evil, totally controlled.
[00:21:56.519 --> 00:22:04.059]  We've got a big beachhead with Trump, and we've gotten about 80% of the way there of getting control of the Republican Party and beginning to drain the swamp.
[00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:04.900]  But we're not there yet.
[00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:14.589]  But the grassroots of the Republican Party are populist, are nationalist, are capitalist, are just common sense people.
[00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:16.470]  And we are the Mavericks.
[00:22:16.529 --> 00:22:17.329]  We are the rebels.
[00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.589]  We're the people of the Justice Department coming after us, not us doing that to them.
[00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.750]  Everything they say about us, they're doing.
[00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.690]  Here it is.
[00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:26.730]  The rebels are Republicans now.
[00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.589]  They're like, you want to be a rebel?
[00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.750]  You want to be punk rock?
[00:22:29.769 --> 00:22:31.569]  You want to buck the system?
[00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.849]  You're a conservative now.
[00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:34.049]  That's how crazy.
[00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:40.490]  And then the liberals are now pro- They're pro-silencing criticism.
[00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.589]  They're pro-censorship online.
[00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:48.710]  They're talking about regulating free speech and regulating the First Amendment.
[00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.450]  It's bananas to watch.
[00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:52.490]  Joe, they come after their political opponent.
[00:22:52.869 --> 00:22:54.470]  I got more guys.
[00:22:54.809 --> 00:22:57.549]  I always say, you know, I kid, but I'm not kidding.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.880]  I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.079]  He was the meanest of them all.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.420]  He'd kill you in two seconds if he didn't like you, right?
[00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:11.059]  I've been under investigation more than Alphonse Capone, only because it's political opponent stuff.
[00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:11.640]  And I've won.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.480]  I won the big case in Florida.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.980]  I'm winning the other stuff.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.400]  You win.
[00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:17.400]  But you know what they did?
[00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:20.099]  They did something that's only done in third world countries.
[00:23:20.259 --> 00:23:22.059]  They came after their political opponent.
[00:23:22.259 --> 00:23:24.140]  I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
[00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:29.839]  Well, not only that, but they're weaponizing it by saying that that's what you're going to do once you get in office.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.579]  Ignoring what they're doing right now.
[00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:33.220]  It's crazy.
[00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:35.819]  Somebody was defending me today.
[00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:38.819]  They say, that's what you're doing to him.
[00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.740]  They're going, he's going to put us in jail.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.700]  He's going to invest...
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.099]  That's what you're doing.
[00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:45.400]  That's what you're doing to him.
[00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:45.660]  Yeah.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.779]  A lot of people say, will you do that?
[00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:50.660]  Will you do that to them if you win?
[00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:53.559]  You know, the presidency has tremendous power.
[00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:55.940]  I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.660]  I respected that you didn't because what you said was it would be bad for the country.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.940]  But now it's a coup by the bureaucracy that won't leave power.
[00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:08.119]  So the leadership of the global is due to be prosecuted.
[00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:10.160]  Or they're just going to keep launching attacks.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.160]  They've got so many victims.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.700]  So, it's got to be done, but not out of vengeance, out of justice.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.460]  I mean, come on.
[00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:17.859]  All right.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:18.700]  Powerful.
[00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:22.059]  Now, here's a longer clip, and it's a great question by Joe.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.940]  What are you going to do your first day in the White House?
[00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:31.119]  And I'm going to comment on this, because this is really important, because the real first day of the White House has already started.
[00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.170]  And when he's president-elect, that's when you've got to get your teams ready.
[00:24:35.309 --> 00:24:39.190]  The real draining of the swamp is who you put in under you, not just your cabinet.
[00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:43.170]  And there's some big inside baseball I'll give you an exclusive on in a moment, but here's a clip.
[00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:45.940]  Nobody really can prepare you for that.
[00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:50.680]  When you're running for president, you don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office.
[00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:53.519]  What did you think it was going to be like?
[00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:55.339]  So do you mean in office or when I decided to run?
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.519]  No, when you got in.
[00:24:57.039 --> 00:25:01.200]  So when I was in and won and was in the White House, essentially.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.059]  Well, first of all, it was very surreal.
[00:25:04.859 --> 00:25:05.380]  I would imagine.
[00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:06.160]  It's very interesting.
[00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:08.000]  When I got shot, it wasn't surreal.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.259]  That should have been surreal.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.140]  When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.920]  I knew exactly where I was hit.
[00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:18.440]  They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.160]  You would know that better than anyone.
[00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:21.500]  When they get the ear torn up...
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.359]  Ears bleed a lot, yeah.
[00:25:23.019 --> 00:25:24.319]  Anyway, so...
[00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:26.559]  And I was thinking the other day...
[00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:30.299]  When that happened, I really knew where I was.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.859]  I knew exactly what happened.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.099]  I said I wasn't hit anywhere.
[00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:39.079]  With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience, okay?
[00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:40.480]  And what's day one like?
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.980]  You win, you get inaugurated.
[00:25:43.099 --> 00:25:44.400]  Holy shit, I'm the president.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.460]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.720]  So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.420]  I just built a building on Pennsylvania.
[00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:51.819]  You know, the hotel, the old post office it was.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.160]  We called it Trump National Post.
[00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:59.950]  We sold it to the Waldorf Astoria, and it was a wonderful thing.
[00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.990]  But I'm driving down, I'm passing the hotel.
[00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.569]  You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military.
[00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:08.910]  You know, it was a major thing.
[00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:13.230]  I got off really the first time I used Air Force One, landed.
[00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.529]  And we're coming down, and it was very beautiful.
[00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:18.609]  I mean, it was incredible.
[00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.069]  And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction.
[00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:25.609]  You know, normally you're used to going one way, and all of a sudden you're going the other way.
[00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:33.509]  The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out, and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart.
[00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:36.529]  You know, it's a little bit dangerous, right?
[00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.089]  I mean, when you watch, like, Kennedy and some others, right?
[00:26:40.289 --> 00:26:40.410]  Yeah.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.420]  But I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.
[00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:48.380]  And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.000]  I thought it was very important to do.
[00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:54.359]  And Melania got out with her beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.880]  People loved it and barren and were walking down the street.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.920]  But where it really got...
[00:27:02.769 --> 00:27:03.190]  Amazing.
[00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:07.849]  We get to the White House and now it's a little bit before dark.
[00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:08.369]  Beautiful.
[00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:12.890]  And we went up to the president's quarters.
[00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:14.470]  They call them the presidential quarters.
[00:27:15.009 --> 00:27:18.829]  And I'm standing in this beautiful hallway.
[00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:20.109]  You know, it's funny.
[00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.210]  Nobody ever talks about the White House as being beautiful inside.
[00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.470]  You know, you think it's going to be everything's going to be all metal doors and stuff.
[00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:26.930]  It's not.
[00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:29.059]  It's so beautiful.
[00:27:29.259 --> 00:27:31.559]  I made my money largely on luxury.
[00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:34.779]  The hallway is like 25 feet wide.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.339]  The ceiling heights are...
[00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:38.160]  It's so beautiful.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.960]  But I was standing there and I said to the guys, I want to see the Lincoln Bedroom.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.460]  I had never seen the Lincoln Bedroom.
[00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:46.000]  I'd heard about the Lincoln Bedroom.
[00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:48.970]  And I was standing with my wife.
[00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:51.069]  I said, do you believe it?
[00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:52.450]  This is the Lincoln bedroom.
[00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:55.470]  I mean, it was like...
[00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.509]  It was amazing.
[00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:59.529]  Because it's...
[00:27:59.529 --> 00:28:01.950]  Look, if you love the country, but here you are.
[00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:03.849]  The Lincoln bedroom.
[00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:05.650]  And the bed, you know, he was very tall.
[00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.849]  He was 6'6", which then would be like...
[00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:09.269]  Like Barron.
[00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.829]  Right.
[00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.329]  It would be like Barron Trump.
[00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:15.410]  He's 6'9", but 6'6", he was very tall.
[00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:16.670]  Then on top of that, he wore...
[00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.049]  There it is.
[00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.329]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:23.789]  It's a long bed, elongated bed, because people were shorter than...
[00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:27.490]  You see some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground, actually.
[00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:35.069]  But he had the long bed, and you had the Gettysburg Address right under that.
[00:28:35.089 --> 00:28:39.250]  You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address.
[00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:43.890]  And this is the original, and I'm looking, and I just looked around.
[00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.509]  I said, do you believe this?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.900]  I was never a politician.
[00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:50.940]  First of all, even if you were a politician, but I was never a politician.
[00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:53.019]  I sort of just started, right?
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.180]  And all of a sudden, I'm standing in the White House.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.099]  And it was very, very surreal.
[00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:00.640]  Okay, so that's a great question.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.420]  And obviously, Rogan's wanting to point out, Trump's already said this, he wasn't ready to understand the swamp.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.759]  I take it to the next level.
[00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:10.640]  I would have said, what are you going to do your first day back in?
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.259]  On January 21st, 2025.
[00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:29.119]  We're good to go.
[00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:36.250]  And that's why they're already gearing up and getting ready to get the right people in and then go in and take the globalists out.
[00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.789]  Whenever Biden said last week, Trump's going to kill us with the military, he's also going to fire every civil servant.
[00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:51.609]  He's not going to fire every park ranger and FBI agent and air traffic controller, but he does need to get rid of the deep state globalists who all have records of working with different criminal groups like Soros.
[00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:54.529]  And so that's how you really drain the swamp.
[00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:58.849]  And so much of what is about to happen is going to rest on that.
[00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:05.109]  Just getting Trump in and being handed this disaster and the inflation and the wars and all of it is just the start.
[00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.970]  But we'll be there watching very, very closely who they bring in.
[00:30:09.069 --> 00:30:12.690]  We were instrumental in Infowars exposing Globals in the White House, getting them removed.
[00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.049]  It's one reason they came after us.
[00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.250]  It's one reason it's important we stay on air.
[00:30:16.369 --> 00:30:30.910]  So regardless of what happens to Infowars, We are launching with some great folks, the Alex Jones Network, or alexjones.network, online for the URL, alexjones.network, and then, of course, follow us on x at AJNLive, and that's where you see us here right now.
[00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.430]  Regardless, we've got other studios that set up as a little pocket, you know, Studio 4.
[00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:38.880]  And I can interview guests over here, punch them up.
[00:30:39.019 --> 00:30:42.519]  That way we've got another studio that's been set up as well.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.259]  So we're there, backups, all of it and a lot more.
[00:30:46.259 --> 00:30:49.940]  Thanks to all of your support and with our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.680]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to another clip.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:00.500]  Let's go to clip 32 on Joe Rogan talking about the propaganda machine of the media.
[00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:01.519]  Here it is.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.799]  I was talking about the auto industry.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.960]  It's a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our auto.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.640]  And I said, it's a bloodbath.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.680]  They said, oh, he used the word bloodbath.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.500]  He said, if you don't win, it's going to be a bloodbath because they're going to take over.
[00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:18.380]  That's exactly what you said.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.240]  It's a terrible thing they do.
[00:31:19.369 --> 00:31:32.650]  But that's the problem with propagandists, because they take things out of context, and ultimately what they do is they diminish their own credibility, because people don't want to listen to them anymore, because they see that they've done that, and they recognize what's going on, and they feel insulted.
[00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.529]  Their intelligence is getting insulted.
[00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:37.119]  You know, shows like yours...
[00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:41.420]  So I have a son who's very smart and tall, barren, right?
[00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:44.160]  And he knows all about you.
[00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:46.000]  He knows about guys I never heard of.
[00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:48.660]  He said, Dad, you don't know how big they are.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.119]  They're big.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.599]  I said, who the hell is he?
[00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:52.460]  Like Ross.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.960]  He said, Dad, he's a great guy.
[00:31:55.319 --> 00:31:56.759]  I mean, guys that are doing...
[00:31:56.759 --> 00:31:58.980]  It's a whole new world out there.
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.880]  It's a different world.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.740]  You know, I'm on TikTok now.
[00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:02.509]  Congratulations.
[00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:04.069]  And I've done really well.
[00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.430]  No, but you know the crazy...
[00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.650]  Have you seen the numbers?
[00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.769]  Billions, like billions of hits.
[00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:10.549]  It's crazy.
[00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:10.869]  I'm sure.
[00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.309]  TikTok's a wild application, though.
[00:32:12.309 --> 00:32:14.630]  And I've gone up 30 points.
[00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:18.029]  A Republican is always down 30 with young people.
[00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:21.680]  I'm plus 30, and I'm on TikTok.
[00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:23.380]  It's had a huge impact.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.480]  I think young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit.
[00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:29.539]  Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:35.799]  They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.539]  People are upset.
[00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:43.430]  There's a big difference now, but even in just a couple of years, I was shaking hands with people that are young people.
[00:32:43.529 --> 00:32:45.250]  The rebels are Republicans now.
[00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:47.069]  They're like, you want to be a rebel?
[00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.230]  You want to be punk rock?
[00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:50.069]  You want to, like, buck the system?
[00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.349]  You're a conservative now.
[00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.549]  That's how crazy.
[00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.869]  All right, so let's go ahead now.
[00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.349]  We're kind of going back over some little ground there.
[00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:02.809]  Let's go ahead and now go to Trump on Kamala doing Rogan and why she chickened out, because she's a teleprompter reader.
[00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.349]  As Mel Gibson just said last week, she's dumbered in a fence post.
[00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.789]  Here it is.
[00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.690]  Can you imagine Kamala doing this show?
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.740]  I could imagine her doing the show.
[00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:14.900]  She was supposed to do it and she might still do it and I hope she does.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.039]  I will talk to her like a human being.
[00:33:17.259 --> 00:33:22.720]  If she did this kind of an interview with you, I hope she does because it would be a mess.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.980]  She'd be laying on the floor comatose.
[00:33:25.339 --> 00:33:26.980]  You'd be saying, call in the medics.
[00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:28.859]  I think we'd have a fine conversation.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.740]  And now we'll play a clip of Rogan calling out the legacy media, more like the dinosaur media.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.400]  Here it is.
[00:33:36.069 --> 00:33:37.529]  It's a creepy, corrupt business.
[00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:42.630]  And the media, to a large extent, acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party.
[00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.130]  It's not even believable.
[00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.369]  Yeah.
[00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:46.750]  I mean, it's bizarre to watch.
[00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.029]  And, you know, most young people, I think, are aware of it.
[00:33:50.089 --> 00:33:55.849]  I think most boomers still, unfortunately, read the newspapers and believe in CNN. But it's getting younger.
[00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:56.410]  Yes.
[00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.549]  It's getting for us, for a conservative.
[00:33:59.869 --> 00:33:59.970]  Yes.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.759]  But you know why that is?
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.839]  It's the internet.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.680]  It's because the internet's giving people information that they're not getting from anywhere else.
[00:34:06.859 --> 00:34:13.079]  And the very fine people hoax, the Russiagate hoax, all these different things that they've done that tried to pin on you.
[00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.940]  It's a clear distortion of what you actually said.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.019]  The bloodbath hoax.
[00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:18.320]  Yes.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.679]  I was talking about the auto industry.
[00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:26.829]  It's a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our order.
[00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.510]  And I said, it's a bloodbath.
[00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.570]  They said, oh, he used the word bloodbath.
[00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.389]  He said, if you don't win, it's going to be a bloodbath because they're going to take over.
[00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.250]  That's exactly what you said.
[00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.150]  It's a terrible thing they do.
[00:34:35.289 --> 00:34:48.530]  But that's the problem with propagandists because they take things out of context and ultimately what they do is they diminish their own credibility because people don't want to listen to them anymore because they see that they've done that and they recognize what's going on and they feel insulted.
[00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:49.969]  Their intelligence is getting insulted.
[00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:50.570]  Well, look at the ratings.
[00:34:50.909 --> 00:35:05.969]  And so now, the last really eight years, the dinosaur media owned by the big Black Rocks, literally one big group, is wanting to censor everybody in a lifetime and has been and then debank people and pass all these laws in Europe and everywhere else to arrest people for their speech.
[00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.429]  I mean, the UK is like North Korea now.
[00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:12.650]  They're arresting peaceful people that break silently across the street from abortion clinics.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.300]  That's the level that this has reached, and it's not working.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.639]  It's causing a global acceleration, a mass awakening.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.820]  But one of the really exciting things is RFK Jr.
[00:35:23.539 --> 00:35:38.909]  and the Make America Healthy Again Maha Movement That with Elon Musk is putting out all these devastating ads exposing World War III, the poison food, the poison shots, the fact that we're not living as long, that our kids are dying, all this is happening.
[00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.389]  This is exciting.
[00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:45.650]  Here is Rogan and Trump talking about the MAGA-MAHA alliance.
[00:35:46.530 --> 00:36:01.230]  First of all, I love this idea of you teaming up with Robert Kennedy, and I love this Make America Healthy Again idea, because there are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries, because they've been shown to be toxic.
[00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:14.289]  There's pesticides and herbicides, and there's a lot of shit that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary, and there's a lot of health consequences that people are suffering from a lot of these things.
[00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.610]  I've read this chart for you.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.119]  Beautiful.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.519]  Because I had a feeling you'd be asking me.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.019]  Thank you.
[00:36:18.139 --> 00:36:18.599]  Look at this chart.
[00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.519]  These are healthier countries.
[00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:21.840]  Look where the United States is.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.639]  I'm going to send this to RFK Jr.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.420]  Look at this.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:37.300]  I was actually talking to RFK today, and he told me that more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health.
[00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:38.750]  I could see it.
[00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:39.510]  That's crazy.
[00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:40.550]  A lot of it's obesity.
[00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.969]  So here's the life expectancy versus health expenditure.
[00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:45.170]  Same chart.
[00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.730]  Yeah.
[00:36:45.889 --> 00:36:46.489]  Did you see that?
[00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:47.489]  USA. Wow.
[00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.429]  That's pretty good.
[00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.050]  Jamie's the best.
[00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.789]  He's very good.
[00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.530]  He's the best.
[00:36:51.389 --> 00:36:52.230]  But look at that.
[00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.929]  Look at the USA. Not good.
[00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:54.849]  And that's our food.
[00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.769]  That's our diet.
[00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.389]  That's sedentary lifestyle.
[00:36:57.389 --> 00:36:58.230]  That's our diet.
[00:36:58.369 --> 00:36:59.769]  That's the chemicals we ingest.
[00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.050]  That's what that is.
[00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:05.250]  But RFK is going to be very, you know, I think he's a great guy.
[00:37:05.429 --> 00:37:07.329]  I love the fact that you guys teamed up.
[00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:11.409]  And are you guys completely committed to have him a part of your administration?
[00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.889]  Oh, I am.
[00:37:11.989 --> 00:37:16.420]  But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is The environmental.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.199]  Because, you know, he doesn't like oil.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.420]  I love oil and gas.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.960]  Just keep him out of that.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.059]  So I'm going to sort of keep him out of it.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.179]  I said, focus on health.
[00:37:25.539 --> 00:37:26.820]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:30.659]  But I've got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold, you know?
[00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:31.800]  All right.
[00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:34.420]  Trump being very, very truthful there.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.780]  Now we're going to get into Trump and election fraud and illegals voting and polls being fake and more in a moment.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.539]  And then Trump on consequential presidents, the ones that the system tries to kill.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.500]  But here's Trump on the income tax and tariffs.
[00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:50.739]  And I've got something to say about this.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.179]  Here it is.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:57.559]  Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.420]  Well, okay.
[00:37:58.539 --> 00:37:59.300]  Were you serious about that?
[00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:00.039]  Yeah, sure.
[00:38:00.219 --> 00:38:00.699]  But why not?
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.860]  Because we, ready?
[00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:08.559]  Our country was the richest in the, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.860]  A president who was assassinated named McKinley.
[00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:13.539]  He was the tariff king.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.159]  He spoke beautifully of tariffs.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.079]  His language was really beautiful.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:29.320]  We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price.
[00:38:29.579 --> 00:38:31.139]  And the big price is tariffs.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.380]  And he'd speak like that, but he was right.
[00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:39.780]  And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]  And you know why?
[00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:43.800]  Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.820]  We don't want to pay tariffs.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.400]  Please don't.
[00:38:45.519 --> 00:38:48.360]  You know, they, believe me, they control our politicians.
[00:38:49.039 --> 00:39:01.420]  If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make then and now, but we had a commission meeting in the, I think it was 1887.
[00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:02.539]  Think of this problem.
[00:39:03.329 --> 00:39:04.369]  We were so rich.
[00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.650]  We had so much money.
[00:39:06.849 --> 00:39:07.969]  We didn't know what to do.
[00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.309]  So they set up a blue ribbon commission on tariffs.
[00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.769]  And the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had.
[00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:21.869]  We were so rich because we were taxing other people for coming in and taking our jobs.
[00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:24.090]  And China does it.
[00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.909]  That's what China did.
[00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:31.110]  If you want to open a factory and sell cars, if you build a factory or have a factory, they don't take our cars.
[00:39:31.289 --> 00:39:32.369]  They wouldn't take our cars.
[00:39:32.489 --> 00:39:37.110]  But if you build a plant in China, you can do that.
[00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.929]  Elon did that.
[00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:44.849]  And this is a long discussion, but the controlled corporate media always tells you the Great Depression happened because of tariffs.
[00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:48.489]  The Great Depression triggered it right as the tariffs came in right after.
[00:39:49.529 --> 00:39:57.369]  Now, Trump has always, when he was president, done selective tariffs when a country won't accept any of our goods, like France wouldn't accept any of our appliances.
[00:39:57.809 --> 00:40:03.550]  He called up the president, this is on record, and said, I'm going to double the tax on your wine.
[00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:06.530]  I'm going to put 100% tariff on it if you don't take this off.
[00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.909]  Because first he called them and said, hey, please let our stuff in.
[00:40:09.389 --> 00:40:10.309]  And they said no.
[00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:15.170]  So he said, okay, well, I'm going to give you one day to reverse that.
[00:40:15.269 --> 00:40:16.829]  That's the executive power in France as well.
[00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.869]  Or I'm going to put 100% tariff on each bottle of wine.
[00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.989]  Call back three minutes later, let the appliances in.
[00:40:24.099 --> 00:40:26.099]  So these are total screw jobs.
[00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:35.139]  And then we have all these regulations and all these taxes on energy, so it's too expensive to even have a factory here to begin with, and all the regulations.
[00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:37.579]  And then that just destroys us.
[00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:41.480]  So people also say, well, tariffs won't raise enough money to fund the federal government.
[00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:42.039]  Let me explain something.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:49.420]  Since Bretton Woods, then we went off the gold standard in the mid-70s and all of that, none of the income tax money you pay goes around the country.
[00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:51.880]  It's a social engineering operation.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.760]  If you go to 50 CPAs with your taxes, it'll give you 50 different answers.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.619]  I don't care if you make $100,000 a year or $10 million a year.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.099]  If that's well-known, look it up.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.699]  Anybody that pays taxes knows that.
[00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:02.000]  50 different answers.
[00:41:02.199 --> 00:41:05.860]  It's written, so the big mega-register don't even basically pay any taxes to begin with.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.340]  So Trump's no tax on, you know...
[00:41:10.809 --> 00:41:17.550]  Workers, hospitality workers, masseuses, golf caddies, waiters, you know, the list goes on and on.
[00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:21.969]  That's a great idea because little people don't pay hardly any of the taxes to begin with.
[00:41:21.989 --> 00:41:25.550]  And when you look at the taxes on the income tax, none of it goes around the country.
[00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.690]  They just monetize the debt and create it out of thin air.
[00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.489]  All right?
[00:41:29.789 --> 00:41:31.329]  That's what needs to be dialed back.
[00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:38.010]  And the big central banks just give themselves unlimited money and then give the other banks unlimited money to loan out to us and interest in control.
[00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.429]  So the whole system's a fraud.
[00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.090]  The income tax is a fraud.
[00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:42.469]  It's in the Communist Manifesto.
[00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.510]  We didn't get it until 1913.
[00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.210]  Same year we got the private federal reserve.
[00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.190]  It is for social control and to keep the small people down.
[00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:51.449]  It is time to get rid of it.
[00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.510]  And I totally agree with President Trump.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.019]  Alright, I'm going to play these clips back-to-back.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:10.300]  This is Trump on illegals being brought into swing states, voter ID and how the majority of Americans support it in common sense, polls, most polls being fraud, and then we'll get into Trump on consequential presidents.
[00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:11.219]  Here it is.
[00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:22.949]  One of the things that's been very clear is that they've moved a large percentage of these migrants that are coming across the border illegally, they've moved them to swing states.
[00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:25.889]  This is what's going on with Springfield, Ohio, right?
[00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:26.949]  They're in swing states?
[00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.090]  Well, that's not a swing state.
[00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.610]  I'm going to win Ohio by a lot.
[00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.789]  So that's not a swing state.
[00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:33.050]  But it's called Springfield, Ohio to be exact.
[00:42:33.329 --> 00:42:47.500]  And Springfield, Ohio, Is this very nice community of 52,000 people that just had 32,000 migrants that don't speak the language dropped into their community.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.719]  You can't get into a hospital.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.199]  You can't get into a school.
[00:42:51.559 --> 00:42:55.139]  It's gone from a beautiful little place to a horror show.
[00:42:56.009 --> 00:42:57.590]  And the mayor is a nice guy.
[00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:00.809]  And the mayor says, we're looking for interpreters.
[00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.110]  I said, no.
[00:43:02.489 --> 00:43:05.030]  You've got to remove them and bring them back to their country.
[00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.730]  Mostly Haitians in this case.
[00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.329]  But they speak no language.
[00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.889]  They speak no English.
[00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:15.230]  In fact, even the language they do speak, I mean, they can't get interpreters.
[00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:16.030]  They can't do anything.
[00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.030]  And the mayor is trying to be politically correct.
[00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.909]  They're all trying to be.
[00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:24.360]  In Aurora, Colorado, You have the worst, probably the worst gang.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.500]  MS-13 might even be, you know, those two are the worst gangs.
[00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:28.760]  These are Venezuela gangs.
[00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:34.280]  They have taken over apartment complexes, and they're going to want to take over the whole thing.
[00:43:34.519 --> 00:43:39.500]  And you have a weak governor, a pathetic governor, who's a radical left Democrat.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.460]  He doesn't know what the hell to do.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:47.559]  But you have it in many other communities, but they don't like to talk about it because it's bad for the community to talk about it.
[00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:52.219]  These people have been let in here by this imbecile.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.440]  I mean it.
[00:43:54.559 --> 00:43:56.619]  She's a low IQ person.
[00:43:57.659 --> 00:44:00.579]  Low IQ. Right, but it's also obviously not just her.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.679]  There's a strategy that's involved in letting these people in.
[00:44:03.679 --> 00:44:04.480]  Well, she was in charge of the border.
[00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.250]  That certainly is a problem.
[00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:09.610]  Mail-in ballots are a problem.
[00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:18.769]  Another problem is voter ID. Voter ID is the most bizarre argument that I've never seen anybody articulate in a way that's convincing.
[00:44:18.909 --> 00:44:20.110]  Because they want to cheat.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.920]  Well, it doesn't make sense any other way.
[00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:26.000]  I've tried to straw-man it, or I've tried to steel-man it, rather.
[00:44:26.159 --> 00:44:33.940]  I've tried to, like, look at it from a position, like, why would you not want people to have ID? And a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.360]  You need an ID to get a driver's license.
[00:44:36.519 --> 00:44:37.800]  Okay, but here's now the next step.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:47.840]  Gavin Newsom, one of the worst governors in the world, and I used to, frankly, I used to get along, but I don't get along with him, because he's just too, you know, it's just a whole con job.
[00:44:48.079 --> 00:45:01.329]  But Gavin Newsom, The other day signed a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person, even ask them whether or not they have a voter ID. Now, what could be a charitable reason why anybody would want that?
[00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:01.750]  Because they want to cheat.
[00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:03.869]  That would be the only thing that makes sense.
[00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:05.590]  But that's taking it to the next level.
[00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.849]  Right.
[00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:12.250]  Now, you know, you have ID. The Democrat National Convention, when they had it the last time, I saw...
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:19.960]  They had a sign, like a billboard, or the name of the person, where they live, how they live, who the hell their boyfriends are.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.880]  Every single...
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.320]  And a big picture.
[00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:24.679]  That's for their...
[00:45:24.679 --> 00:45:28.539]  They have an ID, a big ID. It was hanging like you were a prisoner.
[00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:31.860]  They had these massive cards, everything.
[00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.510]  And yet, when it comes to the vote, in theory, the most important thing we do, okay?
[00:45:36.849 --> 00:45:42.289]  When you go to a grocery store, you give ID. But for a vote, it's supposed to be a sacred thing.
[00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:43.809]  And it should be a sacred thing.
[00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.449]  No voter ID because they want to cheat.
[00:45:46.889 --> 00:45:49.590]  Well, it doesn't make sense in any other way.
[00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:50.750]  I've tried to look at it.
[00:45:50.849 --> 00:45:51.269]  There's no other way.
[00:45:51.909 --> 00:45:54.889]  There's no argument that anybody's presented that makes any sense.
[00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.210]  Why?
[00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:56.510]  You know the funny thing, Joe?
[00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.650]  The Democrats, the people.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.559]  They all think you should have it.
[00:45:59.659 --> 00:46:00.679]  In other words, you should have it.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.059]  If you go to the people, Mrs.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.059]  Schwartz, Mrs.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.079]  Smith, Mr.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:05.440]  and Mrs.
[00:46:05.739 --> 00:46:07.760]  Jones, they say, of course, yeah.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.920]  Democrats, they say yes.
[00:46:10.239 --> 00:46:12.199]  It's the politicians that don't want it.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.960]  Like Schumer and these guys, they don't want it.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.619]  Because they want to be able to cheat.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.380]  Because you know what?
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.440]  If they didn't have it, okay.
[00:46:19.019 --> 00:46:21.539]  Who is going to vote for somebody that wants open borders?
[00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:26.199]  Who's going to vote for somebody that wants to have men playing in women's sports?
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:35.280]  You know, I have never had one person come up to me and say, President, you've got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports.
[00:46:36.049 --> 00:46:36.789]  Have you ever?
[00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:38.750]  Just like I've never been called by a pollster.
[00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.630]  I told you my little theory on pollsters, okay?
[00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:43.889]  I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things, but I don't really care.
[00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:50.730]  Nobody's ever come up to me and said, we want to have men playing women's sports.
[00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:53.349]  But, you know, I have a theory.
[00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.309]  These poll says they charge you a lot of money, too.
[00:46:55.429 --> 00:47:00.449]  You know, they charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid poll, and they interview like 251 people.
[00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.989]  I don't think they interview, in many cases.
[00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.730]  I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.
[00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:05.329]  You think it's bullshit?
[00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:09.670]  No, I think they sit there, they make a deal, they get a half a million bucks, and they say...
[00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.170]  Trump's leading 51 to 49.
[00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:15.110]  They announce it and everybody says, oh, do you understand?
[00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:17.769]  I don't think they...
[00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:19.070]  I think in a lot...
[00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.670]  Look, I'm a very common sense person.
[00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.210]  I think that they probably don't always poll.
[00:47:25.449 --> 00:47:27.289]  Some of them probably never poll.
[00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:33.429]  What's the difference between 49 to 51 and 47 and a half...
[00:47:33.679 --> 00:47:36.280]  Well, it's also a tiny percentage of the population.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.519]  I don't think it's representative of the overall population.
[00:47:39.699 --> 00:47:40.260]  I just don't think it is.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:44.300]  I don't know of one person in my whole life that ever got called by a pollster.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:44.559]  Exactly.
[00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:52.449]  Well, there are scientific polls, and they've got AI systems and the betting markets that are very accurate, and they've got Trump winning in the landslide.
[00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.469]  That's why the system is so panicked.
[00:47:54.550 --> 00:48:03.949]  That's why the major newspapers are not endorsing Kamala Harris, and that's why they're now talking about not certifying the Trump win or making the election go for weeks and weeks and weeks and holding it up and hoping there's civil unrest.
[00:48:04.469 --> 00:48:06.949]  We're about to be in some very insane times.
[00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.230]  If you think things are crazy right now, just get ready.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.980]  All right, one more clip I want to play from the Rogan Trump podcast.
[00:48:14.199 --> 00:48:15.079]  You should go watch the whole thing.
[00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:15.619]  It's amazing.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.280]  Very informative.
[00:48:17.719 --> 00:48:20.239]  Trump's a really, obviously, genuine, real person, says Rogan.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.539]  Here's Trump on consequential presidents.
[00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:25.539]  They only try to kill presidents.
[00:48:25.639 --> 00:48:28.099]  They actually try to be the president and stand up for the people.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.860]  They always try to kill or kill our best presidents.
[00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:31.639]  Here it is.
[00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:33.150]  It's funny.
[00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:38.289]  You need at least the attitude of a comedian when you're doing this business.
[00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.670]  This is a very dangerous business, first of all.
[00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:41.670]  It's a very tough business.
[00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:43.530]  It's the most dangerous business.
[00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.750]  Yes.
[00:48:43.809 --> 00:48:45.010]  Well, for a job?
[00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.449]  Yes.
[00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:51.150]  I mean, other than going to war and being a firefighter or being a cop, it's the most dangerous business.
[00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.690]  It's the most dangerous.
[00:48:51.889 --> 00:48:53.630]  Being president is the most dangerous.
[00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:54.309]  Especially you.
[00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.309]  I mean, you haven't even got to the election.
[00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:58.969]  There's been two assassination attempts.
[00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.969]  And they've...
[00:49:00.429 --> 00:49:02.469]  Brush those out of the news like it was nothing.
[00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:03.909]  Yeah, they'd rather not talk about them.
[00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:16.449]  Imagine if there was assassination attempts on Biden, how hard people would be attacking the right, how they would be trying to get guns taken away from people, they would try to ramp up gun laws, they would try to figure out some way to blame you.
[00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:21.469]  If there was attacks on Biden, if Biden got shot in the ear, we would have never heard the end of it.
[00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:25.150]  But I think he's in good shape because it's only consequential presidents.
[00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:33.489]  If you take a look at what's happened, look, I'm for having countries pay us billions and billions and trillions even dollars.
[00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:35.929]  I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China.
[00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.269]  Nobody took in 10 cents, not one other president.
[00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:44.050]  I do things that make it, I mean, that don't necessarily make me so popular.
[00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.030]  I just do what's right.
[00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.690]  That's right.
[00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:48.630]  He cuts out the globalist middlemen.
[00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:51.829]  That's what Trump found was that China wasn't getting the most money.
[00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:53.909]  The people of America weren't getting the most money.
[00:49:54.230 --> 00:50:08.489]  The globalist middlemen that went in there and opened up China in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s made deals and then used the slave labor of China to leverage out everybody and that they were getting the majority of the money and then buying up infrastructure with it and everything else.
[00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:17.800]  That's why BlackRock's got, with State Street and Vanguard, it's all the same company behind the scenes, 87% of all the world's wealth, and now they want to control your body and your life and everything.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.500]  I mean, they're literally consolidating everything.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:26.139]  That's what the Great Reset is, is shutting down all the other economies so everything implodes, and they're the only ones with the resources, and they vertically integrate.
[00:50:26.179 --> 00:50:28.219]  That's how they economically conquer you.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.360]  That's what globalism is.
[00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:30.289]  All right.
[00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:38.309]  I've got some final news I want to hit here and some more tonight, but I promised everybody that we'll start coming in here at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:43.269]  Regardless of what happens to InfoWars coming up on the 13th of November, they're trying to sell it.
[00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.329]  I'm going to explain that there's been some big developments.
[00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.510]  AP, Bloomberg, Reuters, all from Friday.
[00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:49.409]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.190]  Big deal to all of you.
[00:50:51.489 --> 00:50:54.110]  It hasn't gotten the attention in the Patriot media.
[00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.090]  The real media, it should.
[00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:58.829]  I mean, like a week ago, Joe was asking about it.
[00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:01.880]  I found it hard to believe when I was telling them about it.
[00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:03.639]  I mean, here it is.
[00:51:03.719 --> 00:51:06.619]  It's hit the news and people are like, what?
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.760]  So we'll tell you about that in just a moment.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:22.000]  But first, the great folks at the Maha Alliance, D.L. Big Tree and others that are working closely with President Trump, working closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:51:22.239 --> 00:51:28.500]  on the ideas, but they independently have gone out with help from Elon Musk and are making all these bombshell public service announcements.
[00:51:28.699 --> 00:51:34.599]  I mean, I would even call these political ads that are trying to stop World War III and a draft for women as well.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.760]  The Democrats unanimously are trying to pass.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.840]  Did you know that kind of big deal?
[00:51:38.219 --> 00:51:38.800]  Oh, yeah.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.039]  Women, you can do everything, including, you know, get blown up fighting Russia, China, North Korea.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.699]  And just all these other, exposing the media lies about Trump, what really has gone on with Roe v.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:59.739]  Wade, the horrible, evil background of Kamala Harris, who is just such a vicious, evil witch, and so many of the horrible police state ideas that have gone across the country started with her as the number two person in California.
[00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:07.820]  So here's one of the Maha Alliance videos that's at Real Alex Jones that you should share to everybody that just went up today that are going viral.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.219]  Here it is.
[00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:14.789]  Dear Kamala Harris, Let's get one thing crystal clear.
[00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:20.469]  The vast majority of American men have no issue with electing a female president.
[00:52:22.019 --> 00:52:24.300]  Our issue lies solely with you.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:28.719]  You were second in charge of California for 13 years.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:37.360]  As California's Attorney General, Harris promoted enforcement of a law that allowed prosecutors to seek jail time for parents of truant kids.
[00:52:37.559 --> 00:52:40.820]  As a prosecutor and law enforcement, I have a huge stick.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.579]  So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.239]  I thought that was crazy.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.739]  I was like, how can you lock parents up?
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.699]  If you don't go to school, Kamala's gonna put you and me in jail.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.099]  Yes, we achieved an intended effect.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.480]  I opened the door and I see at least seven or eight cops that wanted to arrest me.
[00:53:06.579 --> 00:53:07.360]  As a matter of fact, they did.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.059]  And frankly, you know the prosecutors in my office who volunteered to do this?
[00:53:11.739 --> 00:53:13.480]  My homicide prosecutors.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.780]  My gang prosecutors.
[00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:19.599]  And they went over there and I said, when you go over there, look really mean.
[00:53:20.039 --> 00:53:28.599]  She had me arrested and prosecuted because my handicapped daughter was sick in the hospital and had me some days of school.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:36.400]  I learned That with the swipe of my pen, I could charge someone with the lowest level offense.
[00:53:36.639 --> 00:53:38.219]  That person could be arrested.
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:42.280]  They could lose time from work and their family maybe lose their job.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.739]  They'd have to come out of their own pocket to help hire a lawyer.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.900]  They'd lose standing in their community.
[00:53:48.179 --> 00:53:52.920]  I lost my job and couldn't pay rent and we got evicted.
[00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:58.469]  Weeks later, I could dismiss the charges, but their life would forever be changed.
[00:53:58.769 --> 00:53:59.869]  I became homeless.
[00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:01.889]  We had to move into a motel.
[00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.849]  All because of the swipe of my pen.
[00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:11.489]  I don't agree what Kamala Harris did to my mom, and I don't agree with what she's done to other parents as well.
[00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:15.050]  You were second in charge of the United States for four years.
[00:54:15.269 --> 00:54:20.769]  If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
[00:54:21.949 --> 00:54:29.650]  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.
[00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:32.889]  Inflation is hitting the highest level in 39 years.
[00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.989]  A record high number of illegal crossings.
[00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.070]  Crime's been surging across the nation.
[00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.610]  Huge spikes in homicides.
[00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:47.110]  Could we be heading toward World War III? After 17 years of failed leadership, you are now asking us to trust you as first in charge of our country.
[00:54:47.619 --> 00:54:50.079]  I am concerned and focused on big issues.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:55.659]  Elementary and middle school truancy is actually a big issue if we're trying to save the state money.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:02.139]  Because of truancy, California public schools lose $1.4 billion a year in funding.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.539]  I want money.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:12.019]  My message to all Americans, do not trust Kamala Harris.
[00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:34.349]  All right, and more of those extremely informative, truthful, powerful public service announcements.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.980]  All right.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.880]  Let me hit some news that affects everybody.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.340]  If this was happening to anybody else, I'd be covering it just as much.
[00:55:51.539 --> 00:55:52.559]  In fact, probably more.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.300]  Overhead shot.
[00:55:54.239 --> 00:55:58.139]  Alex Jones trustee bid to sell his social media paused by judge.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.019]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:05.909]  Here's AP. Alex Jones fighting attempt to sell his social media accounts, writes at Infowars auction.
[00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:10.630]  Now, I showed the federal filing yesterday on air.
[00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:19.909]  There was a hearing Friday morning in Houston dealing with all of this.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:36.559]  And it is very important to understand that in the law you can't do this, but the Democrat Party law firms and others have filed to say they own the name Alex Jones and that they own my private social media,
[00:56:36.679 --> 00:56:39.599]  RealAlexJonesOnX, with 3 million followers, a right of 3 million followers.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.019]  That violates the 13th Amendment against indentured servitude and slavery.
[00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:44.079]  We fought the Civil War over it.
[00:56:46.339 --> 00:56:57.420]  And they're saying, because of their red court cases where I was already found guilty in the fake billion-and-a-half-dollar judgment that we're appealing and fighting, that in the bankruptcy, they don't just get Infowars.com or the equipment.
[00:56:57.699 --> 00:56:59.000]  They want my name.
[00:56:59.869 --> 00:57:01.989]  Well, I never signed a 360 contract like Prince.
[00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:08.050]  You can't sign away your rights to a record company and say, my name is now yours, and if I ever leave, I can't use my name.
[00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:09.010]  Well, my name's Alex Show.
[00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:09.630]  It's on a stage name.
[00:57:10.329 --> 00:57:14.289]  And all of my media and all of my films and all of my shows have always been free to air, a gift for the world.
[00:57:14.429 --> 00:57:17.010]  Just like you can publish a book and say there's no publishing rights to it.
[00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:17.849]  This is a gift for the world.
[00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.849]  You can republish it, use it, do whatever you want.
[00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:22.909]  It's the same thing for me.
[00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:25.309]  And I put contracts on the site saying that for decades.
[00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:26.309]  It's a fact.
[00:57:26.469 --> 00:57:28.590]  And I've been telling the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department that.
[00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:30.929]  And I've been saying, you can't sell my name.
[00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:34.449]  You can't sell the archives of my shows.
[00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:36.010]  And the Democrats have said they want to buy it.
[00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:42.190]  George Soros through Media Matters and go out and find the whole catalog and clips of me that are so powerful now because everything I talked about has come true.
[00:57:42.449 --> 00:57:44.070]  They want to expunge that off the web.
[00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.329]  They've said that in the news.
[00:57:45.429 --> 00:57:45.849]  You can look it up.
[00:57:46.969 --> 00:57:52.050]  And they can't do that either, but they sure as hell don't own my name, and they sure as hell don't own real Alex Jones.
[00:57:52.409 --> 00:57:59.510]  And the terms of service that X and every other social media say, it's your private account, you can't sell that or have it taken, and someone take your identity.
[00:57:59.869 --> 00:58:07.570]  So they don't want to just take my name, they want to take my identity, and then say my followers belong to them, and they brag they're going to send you anti-gun information.
[00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:10.539]  Anti-American globalist propaganda.
[00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:11.960]  I mean, Musk will just shut it down.
[00:58:12.219 --> 00:58:13.239]  But that's not going to happen.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.659]  So I've hired good IP lawyers.
[00:58:14.739 --> 00:58:15.559]  They say it's cut and dry.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:23.639]  We've been fighting them in court, and they tried on Friday, the Democrats and the U.S. trustee to just say, oh, well, we'll just say we own it, and he can litigate it later.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:24.199]  Oh, great.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.000]  Have a judge certify that you can sell my name.
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.000]  The judge said, no, I want to see your proof of this.
[00:58:30.019 --> 00:58:31.320]  I don't believe this is even possible.
[00:58:31.539 --> 00:58:31.960]  He said that.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.059]  It's in the articles.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.119]  And he said, so there's going to be a hearing November 1st in Houston.
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.059]  And we're going to see all this come out.
[00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:41.320]  So that's the end of next week.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.079]  I guess it was Thursday or Friday in Houston, so look up November 1st.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.820]  And that's just a few days before the election.
[00:58:48.179 --> 00:58:56.599]  So it'll probably put off the auction of the equipment and the Infowars infrastructure and Infowars.com and Infowarsstore.com, which I've looked at the law.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:10.090]  There's some argument that you could sell that and get that, except there's a big Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Case where a group sued the NAACP and then tried to, after they won, take their name and all the rest of it.
[00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:18.530]  The judge said, no, you can't do that, especially if your mission is to shut them down And it's not even a business interest, just pure spite.
[00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:21.829]  Well, Democrats have said in federal and state court, they want me off the air.
[00:59:21.929 --> 00:59:22.530]  That's what this is all about.
[00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:23.849]  They've said it's vandalism.
[00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:28.170]  So when you hear, oh, pay them the money you owe them and all the rest of this, A, I don't owe it to them.
[00:59:28.269 --> 00:59:28.889]  It's all a fraud.
[00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:30.130]  Judges found me guilty.
[00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:32.130]  They had show trials, HBO film cameras.
[00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:32.849]  It was all scripted.
[00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.869]  That's all come out.
[00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.889]  The FBI ran it all.
[00:59:34.949 --> 00:59:36.130]  That's come out in court testimony.
[00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:37.510]  The CIA got caught being involved.
[00:59:37.769 --> 00:59:39.210]  I mean, look it up if you don't believe me.
[00:59:39.269 --> 00:59:39.610]  It's crazy.
[00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:40.829]  It's hard to believe, but it happened.
[00:59:41.389 --> 00:59:42.369]  All this stuff's crazy.
[00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:47.579]  And That's their mission is to take me off the air.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:54.039]  And then they think if they take my name and take social media and just keep doing that, somehow it's going to be successful.
[00:59:54.179 --> 00:59:57.179]  And you know, whatever they do to me, they end up trying on everybody else.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.119]  So this is a big deal.
[00:59:58.719 --> 01:00:00.099]  So I want to encourage everybody.
[01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:15.750]  And I want to ask everybody to keep spreading the word about the broadcast and sharing the articles and the videos and the live feeds at RelOxJones and to follow us at AJN Live for the AJ Network, Alex Jones Network, AJN Live on X. That's very important.
[01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:28.710]  And of course, alexjones.network is the URL. You can also go to the AJN Network at alexjones.network and there is a page right there for support.
[01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.369]  And there's a Bitcoin support button.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.380]  And there is the shopping carts and our sponsors and Vimeo and everything right there.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.559]  This is a real fight.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.280]  We're fighting for the country.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.320]  We're fighting the globalists.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.440]  We're exposing everything they're doing.
[01:00:42.619 --> 01:00:51.820]  The open borders, the human trafficking, the World War III, the pedophilia, the devaluation of the dollar, the incredible inflation, the entire New World Order death cult.
[01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:54.019]  Hates my guts massively.
[01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:56.139]  And so it's very simple.
[01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:58.559]  You can also go to thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:48.019]  All-natural fruit punch.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.219]  It's there.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.199]  We have the great gut cleanse, parasite cleanse.
[01:01:53.639 --> 01:01:57.420]  We also have a high-quality 60 billion full-spectrum probiotic.

[01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:02.340]  That's why we have such good products.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.239]  We just go, what's the top rated?
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.039]  What's the highest thing?
[01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:05.260]  We go out and approach them.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.480]  They'll let us private label it.
[01:02:06.519 --> 01:02:07.000]  We bring it to you.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.719]  Some of our stuff's proprietary, like DNA Force over M-Force, but these are not.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.420]  These are just private labeled the best that are out there.
[01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:13.380]  This kind of price.

[01:02:20.929 --> 01:02:21.849]  And this is crazy.
[01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:23.309]  It's a lost leader, but it's a sponsor.
[01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:23.869]  They're doing it.
[01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:24.610]  I don't own the company.
[01:02:24.769 --> 01:02:25.809]  They're just supporting us.
[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:31.650]  They're doing 20% off for a limited time just for like four more days at checkout on top of the discount.
[01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:35.309]  So some of these, you get like three bottles, 55% off.
[01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:36.429]  That's a lost leader.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.639]  We're selling this stuff at cost or below in some cases at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.920]  And we have limited edition InfoWars shirts and others that are fundraisers as well.
[01:02:46.019 --> 01:02:48.619]  So check it all out at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:50.960]  That's what's making all of this possible.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.780]  All right, I want to thank the crew for coming in on Saturday evening.
[01:02:54.999 --> 01:03:00.280]  And we'll still at Infowars for another 17 days until it can potentially be shut down on November 13th.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.300]  So I'll have my Sunday night show, 4 p.m.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:02.679]  Central.
[01:03:03.139 --> 01:03:06.179]  It'll go for four hours, and I'll just be right through to the election.
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.559]  It's hard to believe.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.800]  The election's nine days out.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.719]  That's just crazy.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.579]  But it's not really nine days out because the Democrats, as we predicted, they denied they were going to do it.
[01:03:14.619 --> 01:03:15.019]  Now they are.
[01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:20.659]  We're going to hold it up for weeks in battleground states and try to create insurrection or false flags they blame on us.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.260]  And then they're going to have uprisings if Trump is elected and they can't block it.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.139]  They've all said they will.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.360]  I mean, this is just going to be a wild time.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:38.460]  And it's critical that we be on the air Thanks for your prayer, your word of mouth, your support, and sharing the live links at RealAlexJones and at AJNLive.
[01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.610]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:43.469]  It is really miraculous, so praise God.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:49.369]  All glory goes to God, but God's working through you, so I support you and thank you and salute you for everything you're doing.
[01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:54.170]  Some of the shirts today at thealexjohnestore.com are $20 or $30.
[01:03:54.809 --> 01:03:55.610]  They're high-quality.
[01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.929]  They cost like $15 just for the shirt itself for us, and then they have to print on it.
[01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:06.130]  But some of the shirts, like the InfoWars Classic that's limited edition, Boy, it'll really be amazing if we survive.
[01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:10.030]  It'll be cool to know you saved us, but if we don't, it'll be a piece of history.
[01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.090]  That's 50 bucks.
[01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:12.170]  That's the fundraiser shirt.
[01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:15.630]  Again, it all fundraises, but that's more so you really know you supported.
[01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:27.429]  That and the Rebellion to Tyrants' Obedience to God Punisher shirt are both marked up 50 bucks so we get some real money in here to fund the operation for the legal defense and for the new systems and grids and reporters and everything.
[01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:28.730]  I don't want to lose our crew.
[01:04:28.989 --> 01:04:30.510]  They do such a great job of reporters.
[01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:35.420]  Owen Schroyer, Harrison Smith, Chase Geyser, the people behind the scenes, they make it all possible.
[01:04:35.559 --> 01:04:38.719]  So again, for myself, the crew, and our great mission, I thank you all.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.519]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:04:40.619 --> 01:04:41.320]  Take action now.

[01:05:38.539 --> 01:05:40.699]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:44.659]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[01:05:45.219 --> 01:05:55.460]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.

[01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:20.860]  Free shipping.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.019]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[01:07:24.199 --> 01:07:25.440]  It just goes on from there.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.539]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:34.889]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:36.769]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:41.489]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:42.929]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:44.650]  Theallowshowstore.com.
[01:07:45.210 --> 01:08:12.590]  It's up to you whether you want to back We've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:08:12.969 --> 01:08:13.869]  We've already...
[01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:15.800]  Just devastated them.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.960]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.520]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:08:21.039 --> 01:08:24.819]  They're super dangerous because they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:35.479]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.279]  So again, I don't give up.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.159]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:43.779]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.239]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.720]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:56.439]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score, and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.420]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[01:09:02.539 --> 01:09:04.800]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:08.579]  I mean, it's just, this is a joke.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.119]  This is ridiculous.
[01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.680]  We're changing the world.
[01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:14.640]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:31.020]  I was sent home with a sample of this thinking it was just a, almost like a vitamin mineral fusion type of, you know, vitamins and minerals and just healthy stuff to help make up for the lack of nutrients in the food and Water and air that we breathe.
[01:09:31.739 --> 01:09:36.579]  Everything we consume is just completely destroyed nutritionally and so this will make up for it.
[01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:39.659]  What I didn't realize is it gives you incredible energy.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:48.470]  So I drank it at night and then laid in bed from about 8pm to about 2am just going What did I, did I drink a Red Bull after dinner?
[01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:50.369]  And I'm like, oh wait, it's called Optimal Human.
[01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:51.310]  And it's amazing.
[01:09:51.449 --> 01:09:52.170]  It was incredible.
[01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:56.710]  I didn't realize how much pure, powerful energy it gives you.
[01:09:56.909 --> 01:09:58.390]  So just be careful.
[01:09:58.529 --> 01:09:59.630]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:09:59.869 --> 01:10:01.029]  Use advisedly.
[01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:03.010]  See, I just thought it was going to be vitamins and minerals.
[01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:05.489]  Instead, it's just incredible energy.
[01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:06.369]  Optimal Human.
[01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:07.729]  There it is.
[01:10:08.489 --> 01:10:09.310]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:10:10.489 --> 01:10:11.510]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:10:11.649 --> 01:10:13.069]  Yeah, so I got a canister of that.
[01:10:13.789 --> 01:10:15.569]  Put a scoop and here's what you do.
[01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:16.250]  Here's what I did.
[01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:19.069]  About half a lemon worth of lemon juice.
[01:10:19.369 --> 01:10:24.590]  Get some lemon juice, put it in the Optimal Human because the Optimal Human taste is kind of, it just tastes kind of like a black tea.
[01:10:24.869 --> 01:10:25.970]  It's good by itself.
[01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:28.369]  But man, I added some lemon juice and it was actually delicious.
[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:32.770]  And then it kept me up all night because it was incredibly good energy.
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:41.689]  So if you need some energy and want to make up for the lack of nutrients in the modern food supply, make your way to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:42.869]  Get yourself some Optimal Human.
[01:10:43.069 --> 01:10:45.050]  It really is powerful stuff.
[01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:45.949]  Optimal Human.
[01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.090]  It is really incredible.
[01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:52.949]  It's one of the things like, you know, it's not a placebo effect because I wasn't expecting it to give me a ton of energy.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.920]  I just thought it'd be giving me vitamins and nutrients.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:06.819]  I didn't do my research, but yes, it has a lot of stuff in here for incredible natural energy, and I felt it last night, and I'm feeling it today as well.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.399]  It's got prebiotics and probiotics.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:16.659]  Ashwagandha Optimal Human combines the power of prebiotics, probiotics, digestive enzymes, antioxidants, and adaptogens.

[01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:48.420]  It's going to be cumulative and the longer you take it, the more you're going to feel it and it really Hit you a couple days after taking it regularly.
[01:11:48.779 --> 01:11:49.859]  That's not one of these.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.460]  That's not what Optimal Human is.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.119]  Optimal Human is something that you feel right away and all day.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.680]  It's really, really powerful stuff.
[01:12:01.579 --> 01:12:04.060]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is where you can get it.

[01:12:11.079 --> 01:12:12.000]  Go check it out.
[01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:13.039]  Do your own research.
[01:12:15.609 --> 01:12:23.909]  Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the pesticides that are in our food and our water destroy natural gut health.
[01:12:23.989 --> 01:12:29.710]  Not to mention all the chlorine and chemicals in the tap water that then also gets into the crops and the food.
[01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:30.649]  It's just all around us.
[01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:33.989]  So the globalists have been doing this by design.
[01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.789]  Bill Gates...
[01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:42.869]  Is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:43.689]  It's insane.
[01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:50.090]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:59.029]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby.
[01:12:59.289 --> 01:13:00.970]  Ultimate Gut Cleanse.
[01:13:01.909 --> 01:13:04.229]  These are both private labeled, some of the top brands in the country.
[01:13:04.449 --> 01:13:07.109]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:11.310]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:13.310]  This is amazing.
[01:13:13.329 --> 01:13:14.689]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[01:13:15.489 --> 01:13:22.210]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[01:13:23.479 --> 01:13:34.840]  Proprostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the sawpaw meadow.
[01:13:34.979 --> 01:13:41.270]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, sawpaw meadow is It's insane.
[01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.729]  Look it up.
[01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:44.270]  So this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.470]  It's got the trifecta going.
[01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:55.470]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[01:13:55.609 --> 01:14:00.489]  And you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:07.649]  Or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.640]  Mike in Florida.
[01:14:15.779 --> 01:14:16.420]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:14:16.579 --> 01:14:23.159]  With respect, Alex, to what you're talking about, about funding the operation and just funding wars in general, I got a question for the audience.
[01:14:23.279 --> 01:14:27.800]  Yeah, you, the audience member that's never donated or spent a dime at the store.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:33.020]  What if the New World Order succeeded because you weren't willing to put up $50?
[01:14:33.659 --> 01:14:38.300]  What if the New World Order succeeds because you weren't willing to put up a $20 donation?
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.340]  Would you be able to live with yourself?
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:15:09.029]  Because I can tell you as an 18-year listener, Alex, I probably spend about A thousand dollars a year at the store right now and anytime you ever release something I'll just buy it just because and maybe I'll give it away as a gift or whatever but to the people that are not funding this are you aware because you live in a capitalistic society just every time that you purchase something that you're giving credibility to whatever that is so instead of going to Amazon why don't you just go to the Alex Jones store why don't you just get Why don't you just get t-shirts?
[01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:10.170]  What's the issue with that?
[01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:14.770]  So ask yourself the question, are you going to let 50 bucks stand in the way between you and the New World Order?
[01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:25.489]  The globalist master plan, the key to all their power, they admit, is the global social credit score, where they track everything you buy, tell you what you can buy, and then use that for total control.
[01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:31.229]  So they already know that the real voting power is in what you buy, what you promote, what you support.
[01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:42.359]  And that's what I'm saying is in this war, Imagine if we'd have kept Trump in, inflation would have been much lower, and everybody would have saved tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:53.220]  So people lose money by not backing good political candidates, not supporting good companies, not backing groups and organizations that tell the truth.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.539]  That sabotages the entire globalist operations.
[01:15:56.659 --> 01:15:57.439]  You hit the nail on the head.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.800]  Thank you so much for the call, Mike.
[01:15:58.939 --> 01:16:03.659]  They wouldn't be trying to shut us down if they were so powerful, if things were hopeless.
[01:16:04.399 --> 01:16:05.100]  It's that simple.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:05.960]  Take action.
[01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:07.399]  Action defeats tyranny.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.279]  Keep the tip of the spear on air.
[01:16:09.819 --> 01:16:13.939]  Energize me now, and I swear to you, to give you 110%!
