[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.460]  As most of you know, the tyrannical, deep state-controlled Democrats and the corporate, prostitute, whore media have been celebrating Infowars to be potentially shut down November 13th when it goes up on the chopping block for auction.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.539]  Well, guess what?
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.339]  My guests, myself, my crew are the Infowar.
[00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.980]  The Infowar goes on no matter what happens to a website or a shopping cart or this equipment.
[00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.030]  And they haven't broken our fighting spirit one bit.
[00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.149]  In fact, they've only hardened my resolve massively to fight even harder with our weapon, the truth.
[00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.770]  And man, the whole world is listening now.
[00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.829]  Populous movements are getting elected.
[00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.710]  Nationalists all over the world.
[00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.789]  All the most prominent people.
[00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:46.390]  All the top talk show hosts.
[00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.710]  And people like Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.
[00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.770]  The list goes on and on and on and on.
[00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.049]  I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.929]  And with that, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones.
[00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.350]  Even Megyn Kelly sounds like us now.
[00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.569]  Even Andrew Cuomo.
[00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:14.189]  Everybody is talking about the New World Order and the globalists, the depopulation plan, and the death cult because of Infowars in our 30 years.
[00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.090]  We even get the credit from the good guys and the bad guys.
[00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.590]  That's why the bad guys want us shut down.
[00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.750]  It's like the old Terminator movie where they try to send the Terminator back in history to kill John Connor.
[00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.879]  Well, guess what?
[00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:33.159]  It's too late because now there's thousands of prominent John Connors and hundreds of millions of others that know the truth.
[00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.719]  Skynet is done.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.459]  The only question is, can they start World War III to try to claw humanity down into hell with them?
[00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.219]  So, as most of you know, November 13th, InfoWars is up for sale.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.739]  If the bad guys get it, it's gone.
[00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.810]  But we have great sponsors that have pledged and committed one way or the other to get me right back on air.
[00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.469]  And a lot of stuff's been happening behind the scenes.
[00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.150]  So if Infowars survives, all that new great stuff that's been set up with some other great people will be rolled right into it.
[00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:04.409]  But regardless, I'm not going to count on that.
[00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.330]  We are going to fight as hard as we can on air and off air to get all this infrastructure going.
[00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.669]  and systems in place to reach the hundreds of radio affiliates and the TV and cable affiliates.
[00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.990]  Oh yeah, we're on a lot of that, reaching tens of millions a day.
[00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.770]  And to continue with our reporters and crew.
[00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:31.370]  So, we have launched a new link to a site, alexjones.network and there'll be a lot of announcements and a lot of information there in the near future.
[00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.750]  It's bare bones right now.
[00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.979]  It's just a place for you to bookmark and understand that that's one of the key genesis points Of what's coming in the near future, regardless of what happens to InfoWars.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.060]  And then, there's another URL that takes you to a subpage at alexjones.network, and that is alexjones.live.
[00:02:48.379 --> 00:03:03.879]  When you go to that page, you will see our sponsors, the alexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com, my Vimeo account, a new Bitcoin account, will go directly to me so I can continue to fight at every level, both legal and for broadcasting, and so much more.
[00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:08.539]  And then there's some other key links there as well to X, We can become a subscriber.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.080]  And however you've donated, however you've supported with your time, your word of mouth, your prayer, or financially, I want to thank you all.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.159]  But the products are really amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.800]  Game-changing supplements, amazing patriot apparel to spread the word and meet like-minded people.
[00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:32.539]  DR Jones Naturals, cutting-edge supplements, and fluoride-free toothpaste full of essential oils, nano-silver, and so much more at drjonesnaturals.com.

[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.240]  The Democratic Party suing me at every level has even filed in federal court to take real Alex Jones away from me on X. Terms of service say they can't do that.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.439]  Elon Musk will just shut it down.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.900]  We'll have to set up a new one.
[00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.099]  But all the lawyers and experts say they can't have my identity.
[00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.340]  It violates the 13th Amendment.
[00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:14.330]  But regardless, they're trying because they've been given the walking orders through the FBI, through the Justice Department, through the CIA, remember it all came out in court, to shut me down.
[00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.110]  But they're literally picking a fight with the American people.
[00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.709]  So when you respond and make a donation to our legal defense fund at realalexjones.com, And again, it's all linked on one page at alexjones.live.
[00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:39.069]  Or when you buy a supplement or buy a t-shirt, you are literally backing an organization and a group of people that will not surrender ever, that cannot be bought off, that cannot be intimidated, but could collapse.
[00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:40.610]  We could give out.
[00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.480]  And that is all up to you.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:53.600]  So please bookmark alexjones.network and alexjones.live, as well as our Give, Send, Go Legal Defense Fund, realalexjones.com.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.160]  But again, if you just go to alexjones.live, it's all listed right there, and all the sites are getting built.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.600]  They're all getting expanded.
[00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.870]  We got great people we're working with and we will not be silenced.
[00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.170]  Without giving out too much strategy, more will be announced in the days and weeks to come.
[00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.649]  But just remember what happened to Tucker Carlson.
[00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.350]  They kicked him off Fox, the number one news show in the world.
[00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.870]  He got conservatively 10 times bigger when they did that.
[00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.550]  And now he's got arenas full of tens of thousands of people.
[00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.850]  His average show gets about 50 million viewers.
[00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.310]  When his Fox show got 5 million.
[00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.750]  It's just crazy.
[00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:34.480]  Because the people didn't desert Tucker Carlson, and I know you're not going to desert me either because you understand we're on the same team.
[00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:38.620]  So for myself and the crew here, InfoWars is not a website.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.019]  It's not a name.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.019]  It's not a shopping cart.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.019]  It's not this equipment.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:57.870]  It's myself and the crew and the supporters and all of us together and all the incredible guests and the documentary films and the books and the articles and the information we've put out That is recognized as some of the most accurate, over-the-horizon, tomorrow's news,
[00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.870]  today information anywhere.
[00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:04.790]  So, I promise you to redouble my efforts in the fight.
[00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:06.269]  Humanity's waking up.
[00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.430]  We have the initiative.
[00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.410]  We're going to win.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.620]  But it takes a commitment from we the people.
[00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:23.139]  So at this critical juncture of history, I thank you for your past support, however you've done it, and ask you from the bottom of my heart to realize we're at the most crucial point in the battle and the war for liberty right now, and your support isn't just critical.
[00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.959]  It is absolutely essential.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.180]  Without it, we fail.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.339]  With it, we win.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.560]  We are all in this together.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.920]  You are modern Paul Revere's, and if you're watching, listening to me, you are the resistance.
[00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.040]  God bless you, and I humbly thank you.
