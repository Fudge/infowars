[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.280]  MUSIC PLAYS Thank you.
[00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.020]  We're good to go.
[00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:21.049]  We're good to go.
[00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:50.640]  We're good to go.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.080]  Thank you.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.960]  We're good to go.
[00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.090]  Thank you.
[00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.509]  Thank you.
[00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.829]  Thank you.
[00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.899]  Thank you.
[00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.649]  You're listening to Real Alex Jones, unfiltered, uncensored, and unrelenting truth, right here on the Alex Jones Network.
[00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.449]  Today, October 16th, 2024.
[00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.689]  We're only 20 days out from the most important election in world history.
[00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:27.370]  Hell, 19.
[00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.189]  And I am honored to be here with you.
[00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.110]  Alright, this is a major news-making broadcast you're watching right now.
[00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:48.329]  Because what's happening to me in the last really nine years of intense deep state attacks, they admit on CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, PBS, everything.
[00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:49.490]  You've seen it everywhere.
[00:06:50.050 --> 00:07:01.430]  Unrelenting attack is a beta test that if they can do it to me as a training tool for the public and for the deep state, the corporations and government working together under BlackRock, they can do it to anybody.
[00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.050]  So...
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.680]  I'm going to reveal a lot of exclusive information here tonight.
[00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:21.740]  And I can tell you, while I was on air today, I got a call from a very important lawyer that happens to represent a very important person who's fighting the deep state at a level I've never been able to.
[00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:23.300]  Now, who else could that be?
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.120]  It's not Tucker Carlson, not Joe Rogan.
[00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:28.319]  Who else could it be?
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.220]  Who owns a big giant social media company?
[00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:32.819]  Oh, I'll just leave it for you to figure out.
[00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.490]  And I said, what's this call about while I was on air?
[00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:38.509]  And they said, don't you know what's breaking right now?
[00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:39.649]  Call us back later.
[00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:50.129]  Because they understand how that affects everybody, especially those trying to bring free speech back in this age of great tyranny.
[00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:53.110]  So this is a lot bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:59.430]  And we have all the lies of the federal government and the big corporations.
[00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.189]  We have all the proof of what they're doing.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.639]  In the last 14 weeks, it has been something out of a dystopic novel, what we've gone through.
[00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:12.939]  But you have to understand, they're trying to get through me, as Trump always says, to get to you.
[00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:22.860]  So, without recapping all the ancient history, this is where we are.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:36.950]  On the 13th of November, Federal Bankruptcy Court has authorized the sale of Infowars, the website, the shopping cart, the equipment, to the highest bidder.
[00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.669]  And George Soros, through Media Matters, has said he plans to buy it and shut it down.
[00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.070]  And I knew what they would do because the Democratic Party funded these lawsuits.
[00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.870]  The FBI ran it, created it all.
[00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.169]  They testified to that in court.
[00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.970]  The CIA got caught in hidden video admitting it all earlier this year as well.
[00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.049]  That was a big national story.
[00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:08.039]  And they said on the courthouse steps after they won their rigged trials, where the judges already found me guilty in Texas and Connecticut and key Democrat jurisdictions, that we don't want money.
[00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:09.879]  We want Alex Jones off the air.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.200]  I'll play those clips again, just some of them for you.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.059]  But then they simultaneously in the news say, he won't pay us money.
[00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:19.580]  He has hundreds of millions of dollars he made off us, totally made up.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.820]  The New York Times even had to admit two months ago, turns out Jones was fully reviewed by the bankruptcy court outside accounting firms.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.919]  He had meager assets.
[00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:26.519]  He told the truth.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:38.559]  But they still spin it like InfoWars is being sold to pay debts to these people when it's all an appeal and all the even mainline lawyers say will be overturned.
[00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.899]  But in the process, they're trying to shut me down.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:55.679]  Now, I said to my lawyers months and months and months ago when the judge ordered InfoWars up for sale after the feds tried to shut the doors without even a court order and he fired the federal trustees from the Justice Department that were over it.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.759]  Remember, they came to the studio with armed security to lock it, and I said, I'm calling the police.
[00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:00.480]  You don't have a warrant.
[00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.019]  You don't have a judge's order.
[00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:02.419]  You have nothing.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.820]  Then they went to the judge and said, fine, we just want it closed.
[00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:09.940]  He said, no, but since Jones is in personal bankruptcy, he's already liquidated his assets that were meager.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.899]  If he owns this company, it'll go up for sale.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.220]  And then I said, you watch to my lawyers before I even announce this on air.
[00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:18.179]  They said, don't give them any ideas.
[00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:19.019]  I said, no, just watch.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:26.659]  They will claim they own my name, Alex Jones, and they will claim they own any social media or anything I say or do in the future.
[00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:29.399]  They then filed in court.
[00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:34.820]  To take real Alex Jones, my personal account, and a bunch of others.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.659]  And the judge said no to that.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:53.399]  Now, as of the last couple days, they got the new federal trustee, the judge fired the last one, Chris Murray, who I'm not saying is a villain at this point, but the Sandy Hook people, the Democrats and others, coming wanting to buy it, said,
[00:10:53.519 --> 00:11:10.830]  we want you to file in the court, which they did this morning, it's all over the news, And say, you heard my defense a few weeks ago, 13th Amendment against slavery, say that this doesn't violate the 13th Amendment and that his private social media and his name,
[00:11:10.929 --> 00:11:13.470]  Alex Jones, does not belong to him.
[00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.090]  And I will show you the federal filing.
[00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:22.029]  I will show you the quotes in Bloomberg where the U.S. trustee, the new one from the federal government, says, Jones is different.
[00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:23.289]  He doesn't own his name.
[00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:24.629]  He doesn't own his social media.
[00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.639]  Now, the courts have ruled.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.940]  All the social media rules are clear.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.279]  So is X. You have a personal account.
[00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.379]  You can't transfer it.
[00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:33.120]  You can't sell it.
[00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:33.679]  You can't do that.
[00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:40.320]  I got real Alex Jones back when Twitter was started, what, 2010 or whatever it was.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.559]  Yeah, 2010.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.419]  And it's always been my private thing that I put out stuff.
[00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:48.100]  And, of course, I link to stories and info wars, but it's everybody else.
[00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:48.679]  Go look at it.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.860]  But they don't care.
[00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:55.980]  So the judge hasn't done this, but the trustee wanted to get more money at the sale.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.320]  He just says in the filing, Alex Jones is different, doesn't cite any case law.
[00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:12.500]  He just says that we're going to sell his name and we're going to take over his social media, including real Alex Jones.
[00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:24.919]  Now, that's why within an hour of this breaking, ring, ring, ring, Big, high-powered, well-known lawyer for you-guess-who calls me and says, have you seen this?
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.480]  I said, no.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.480]  And then, bing, bing, bing, my lawyers are calling.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.879]  They'd already been interviewed by the news this morning and everything else, but they're good guys, but hadn't gotten around to calling me.
[00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:36.980]  And the call is, hey, do you need some more counsel?
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:46.740]  Because obviously, the folks here at X understand this is pointed at Elon Musk and all of you.
[00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:59.159]  So, back when they set the precedent to demonize me, lie about me, take me off everything, steal my identity, then misrepresent who I was, that was a test for everybody else.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.299]  They later admitted that on MSNBC, CNN, and everywhere else.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.340]  Played the clips many times.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.940]  And they said it was never about money.
[00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:10.700]  So, they misrepresented what I said in the past.
[00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:15.299]  I only covered what the internet was doing and not believing in a mass shooting, which everybody's right to do.
[00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.379]  Didn't believe Jussie Smollett.
[00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:19.029]  I was attacked either.
[00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.929]  I was right about that.
[00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:21.169]  But you're allowed to be wrong.
[00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.889]  The point is, is that I wasn't the progenitor of that.
[00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:29.529]  They hired PR firms, later bragged about it, to run all these thousands of stories that I was attacking people and doing things I never did before they sued me.
[00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:31.309]  Then sued me.
[00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:34.730]  Had the judges find me guilty in default.
[00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.970]  For not giving them discovery, which none of that was true.
[00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.889]  There was no discovery of, what's your marketing plan on Sandy Hook?
[00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:42.529]  Marketing plan on news I cover?
[00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:44.070]  There is no plan.
[00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.330]  When we plug products and sponsors, it's 100% clear, here's a sponsor.
[00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:49.710]  When I covered a news article, nothing to do with a sponsor.
[00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:57.070]  So, the judges said, well, you didn't give us your marketing material, you're defaulted.
[00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.289]  Because it didn't exist, but that was their whole case.
[00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.409]  And I barely even talked about these people.
[00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:06.129]  They attached to my name years before And ran ads everywhere saying he's bullying.
[00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.110]  He's being mean right now.
[00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:07.690]  Give us money.
[00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.169]  They reportedly raised hundreds of millions of dollars off my name.
[00:14:10.769 --> 00:14:12.529]  And then said I was attached to them.
[00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.429]  And then had HBO TV movie cameras in both courts.
[00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:18.730]  And the judge said you can't say you're innocent.
[00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.409]  Here's a whole list of things or I'll throw you in jail.
[00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:30.529]  You saw all of that happen over and over and over again.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.779]  So now this is bigger than just free speech.
[00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:51.620]  They have filed saying that if a prominent person has private social media under the new Alex Jones case, the federal government has, the Justice Department, that's who controls these trustees, that all of you can have your personal name taken.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.820]  They say the name Alex Jones belongs to them in this filing that I will show you.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.059]  And it's linked up on Exodus, linked to the Bloomberg article.
[00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:03.600]  Read it for yourself.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.340]  They don't cite any law, nothing.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.840]  Just, well, Alex Jones is different.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.679]  13th Amendment doesn't apply to him.
[00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:11.159]  Read it.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.179]  I will read it to you in a moment.
[00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:14.500]  I'll read the whole article and then show you the document.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.759]  So, that's where we are right now.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.740]  And people didn't really rally to my aid.
[00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:31.279]  When they did all this to me, going back starting eight, nine years ago, and the deplatforming six years ago.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.820]  Since then, people figured it out.
[00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:37.200]  They figured out what I actually said and did and went, wow, this guy's been dead on.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.320]  And that's another thing they've said.
[00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:40.500]  They said, anything you ever said in the past, we own it.
[00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:43.419]  We're going to take that off the internet because that stuff's beyond evergreen.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.799]  It doesn't just stay powerful.
[00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:45.759]  It gets more powerful.
[00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:48.039]  It's ultra green, a term I've coined.
[00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.889]  Of course, I've always been free to air.
[00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.990]  It'd be like if you published a book and said anybody can publish it, it's free to the world.
[00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.889]  They couldn't later say that person's bankrupt and they own that book because the book was given freely.
[00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:09.490]  We have all the documents and letters I put out on the site 20 years ago, 10 years ago, because people wanted to air my stuff on local TV and stuff, and they demanded a letter saying this is free to air.
[00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:10.590]  Everybody can use this.
[00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.230]  This is owned by the world.
[00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:14.970]  So we're going to defeat them in court.
[00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:15.889]  That's just going to take funds.
[00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:21.340]  But they're acting like I'm Prince, who signed a 360 record deal.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.220]  I think it was with Sony, owning his name, his likeness, everything.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.720]  So he had to call himself the artist formerly known as Prince.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.559]  They're trying to use entertainment law, which is the closest thing to slavery, 360 deals is what they're called, to apply it to me.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.940]  I've never been in the entertainment business.
[00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:38.379]  I'm in the news and information and punditry and analysis and free speech.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.240]  Free speech systems is the name of my company.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.820]  So this is outrageous.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.100]  It's extremely dangerous.
[00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:56.940]  And that's why I have announced the Alex Jones Network, AlexJones.network.
[00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:07.319]  Now, I've got folks that want me to work with them in Florida and in other areas, and big groups want to give me jobs, and that's all fine and dandy, and I appreciate that.
[00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.299]  But I have my crew.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.559]  I live here in Austin.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.619]  My parents live here.
[00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:12.160]  My four children live here.
[00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:17.549]  And in the interim, there's already been a backup studio for years.
[00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:18.490]  We're in that right now.
[00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:22.670]  There's other systems being set up right now that are more elaborate.
[00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:23.849]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:36.859]  And that is going to take the public supporting us and supporting our sponsors that aren't free speech and that aren't owned by these people So that we can do this.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.039]  Just like when Tucker Carlson got fired, he created the Tucker Carlson Network.
[00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:54.240]  And I intend to keep my show going, the shows we have, and I intend with the folks we're going to work with, because I will work for other folks now, to expand in the face of the enemy because everything we've talked about is so...
[00:17:55.399 --> 00:17:57.660]  Credible now and is exploding everywhere.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.720]  That's why they want everything I said in the past gone.
[00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:13.259]  That's why they're fighting like the devil to get it off air because the stuff I said 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago, a month ago is all happening now and it's all going mega viral and they are in complete panic mode.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.099]  Now, obviously, I'm not going to give up, so this is going to stride and affect them.
[00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:26.480]  It's going to blow up in their face, but they got big money and the Democratic Party and the CIA and the FBI on record running all this and the Justice Department, so they're not going to stop.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.039]  Well, that's fine.
[00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:30.160]  We're not going to stop either, and you're not going to stop because you understand you're being targeted.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.599]  But just like in World War II, 60% of the whole war happened in one city, Stalingrad.
[00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:37.200]  Look it up.
[00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:40.349]  20-plus million Germans got killed, 20-plus million Russians.
[00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:50.609]  More than half of them, upwards of 60%, and 90% of the war happened between Russia and Germany, look it up, happened in Stalingrad.
[00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.150]  That's where they decided to slug it out.
[00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.750]  That was where they decided to, boom, the hill to die on.
[00:18:56.549 --> 00:19:03.289]  The globalists have decided Trump is the hill to die on, they've decided I'm the hill to die on, and they've decided Elon Musk is the hill to die on.
[00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:08.380]  But I'm not Trump and I'm not Elon Musk.
[00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:11.079]  I don't have all these resources, though I do reach masses of people.
[00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:16.319]  So they think taking away a website or a shopping cart or something or some equipment isn't going to do anything to us.
[00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:18.680]  And they figured out that's not going to work.
[00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:21.740]  And they didn't ever want to settle for more money than we've ever made.
[00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:24.819]  And I told my lawyer, sure, settle for that giant number.
[00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:25.319]  They'll say no.
[00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.390]  And it's in the news.
[00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.609]  They came back and said, okay, 70 million.
[00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.589]  You want 70 million over 10 years?
[00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.349]  Oh, actually, we want 80 million.
[00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.230]  And we want you to agree to not talk about the Second Amendment.
[00:19:36.349 --> 00:19:37.029]  And I said, let me guess.
[00:19:37.069 --> 00:19:37.710]  There's a bigger list.
[00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:38.609]  Yeah, there's a bigger list.
[00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:44.710]  They said that in mediation, which you're not supposed to talk about, except then the lawyers told my lawyers that outside of mediation, so I can tell you about it.
[00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.589]  Imagine that scandal.
[00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.289]  Openly saying, we'll drop all this.
[00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:53.049]  What, do you want me to have a show on MSNBC? Maybe I can...
[00:19:54.289 --> 00:20:00.109]  Co-host with Rachel Maddow and tell you that there's more than two genders and that there's no X and Y chromosomes?
[00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:02.230]  Maybe I can support drag queen story time.
[00:20:02.329 --> 00:20:03.630]  Maybe I can support World War III with Russia.
[00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.769]  Maybe I can support the destruction of the dollar.
[00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.210]  Maybe I can support giant human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.109]  Nope.
[00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.589]  You know what?
[00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.450]  On second thought, hell no, never.
[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:15.569]  So they also want to make it...
[00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:19.369]  Example out of me to scare other people.
[00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.769]  Because they think you're a bunch of cowards like they are.
[00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:22.950]  But instead, it's backfired.
[00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.170]  America was asleep to the global tyranny when they were bullying us.
[00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.930]  And now America's waking up and the bullying's just pissing people off.
[00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:32.630]  How's the bullying working on Elon Musk?
[00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:34.289]  How's the bullying work on Donald Trump?
[00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.529]  So you think you're going to get Alex Jones.
[00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.089]  Well, look at your bigger problems you got.
[00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:40.130]  I'm like a hundred foot Godzilla.
[00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:42.450]  Trump's like a ten thousand foot Godzilla.
[00:20:42.849 --> 00:20:43.670]  And globally...
[00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.980]  Elon Musk is a 20,000-foot Godzilla.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.180]  Tucker Carlson's a 500-foot Godzilla.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.680]  And there's all these other giant Godzillas forming against your new world order, destroying you.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.759]  So good luck.
[00:20:56.039 --> 00:21:02.759]  But they've been trying to get me the hardest of anybody else in the media.
[00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:08.480]  They have been absolutely going for broke.
[00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.450]  With everything they've got, and they're just pissed they haven't hammered this one nail down in.
[00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:16.869]  So they see it as a tug-of-war.
[00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.430]  That's why you need to see it as a tug-of-war and share this live video.
[00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.950]  Share the report when we archive it.
[00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:26.150]  Share the backup X accounts and media organizations I'll be working with.
[00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:29.089]  I mean, don't they even get if they took real Alex Jones?
[00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.390]  It's in the terms of service.
[00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.910]  Elon Musk will shut it down like that.
[00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:33.210]  Well, they already know that.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:40.920]  They want to set the precedent to take all of your social media accounts through lawfare.
[00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:44.359]  It's insane.
[00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:58.200]  Now also, I'm going to play a couple of video clips here.
[00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:08.960]  And then I'm going to come back and I'm going to break down all the news and information and read over the documents for you and get into the specifics here.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.180]  But I cannot stress to you enough how real this is.
[00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:19.500]  Now, you notice I reported this a couple years ago and no one seemed to care.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:28.279]  And then Biden issued an executive order and off that executive order, the Pentagon put out a policy paper saying they will police America and kill Americans.
[00:22:29.779 --> 00:22:33.619]  Now that's taken weeks since that new document was put out to actually become big news.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.500]  It happened in September.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.920]  But it's finally there and it's in the documents and people are blown away.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.160]  I got a clip of Ron Paul on that.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.980]  But that's what I've been telling you forever.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:52.140]  I've been telling you for decades about atrazine, the second most used herbicide that is literally sterilizing people in mass and bending gender.
[00:22:53.809 --> 00:22:55.150]  And it's all now admitted.
[00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.309]  The FDA came out a month ago and said, you know, fluoride causes brain damage and we should get out of the water.
[00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:00.869]  We were wrong.
[00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.990]  Federal judge says it stays in the water.
[00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.569]  And they do this over and over again.
[00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:12.289]  So every subject that other people knew about and were covering too and writing books about and I was interviewing them all.
[00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.630]  But my show reached the most people the first.
[00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.109]  We popularized reality.
[00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:22.150]  We exposed the globalist master plan, death cult for world government depopulation, all of it.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:29.920]  And they are fundamentally pissed at me going and protesting them at Bilderberg and covering them and ferreting out info and exposing their operations.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:38.500]  And so if you don't back the champions, and I'm not trying to say I'm some perfect guy, but I am a champion of liberty.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.000]  I'm seen as a folk hero by people that love freedom, and it's growing all over the world.
[00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:46.380]  And the enemy knows that, so they need to destroy me.
[00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:49.400]  They need to harass my family.
[00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:51.140]  They need to sue my parents.
[00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:52.880]  It's been incredible.
[00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.539]  But that only pissed my family off and told me to fight even harder.
[00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:01.500]  So, I'm going to go over all of this.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.000]  But just think about mainstream headlines.
[00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:07.539]  U.S. military now authorized to kill Americans on U.S. soil.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.039]  And it's not Trump getting ready to do it.
[00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:10.380]  It's the Democrats preparing it.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.900]  While they say Trump, last night, Kamala said, is preparing to use the military on the American people.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.339]  Well, if they get power and keep control, they will do that.
[00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:20.880]  They know Trump isn't going to do that, so they're saying he is.
[00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:24.839]  Whatever they say Trump's going to do or I'm going to do, they're going to do.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.539]  These are real villains, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.519]  And they're going for broke and they're committed to what they're going to do and they'll do anything.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.380]  The Democratic Party is now the party of World War III, the party of human trafficking, the party of sex slavery, the children.
[00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:49.019]  And They literally counter my lawyer's arguments that are crystal clear and 100% dead on.
[00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.920]  We went and looked at all the case law.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:25:00.259]  That we get rid of the 13th Amendment to take somebody's likeness and name and their private social media and do that.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.180]  But they're in the article saying Alex Jones and in the federal filing is different.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.019]  With him, his name belongs to us.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:08.960]  It's a commodity.
[00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:27.240]  So, that's what they're doing and they want to use these AI bot systems they have that have been around forever to be able to go out and expunge everything of me off the internet so that they can claim Ownership of it and try to stop you.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:40.259]  Remember what Drudge came like 10 years ago on air, nine years ago, and said he met with Clarence Thomas and Clarence Thomas told him he'd been in the meetings and the feds were telling him then, oh, we're going to use copyright law where if you even quote an article or link to it, we'll shut you down.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.160]  Well, that never got done, so now they're just going to say, well, we're just going to go out and own your likeness.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:54.259]  That's why the Democratic Party spent over $70 million the last six years suing me and doing all this crap and all this insane stuff.
[00:25:56.359 --> 00:26:08.420]  So, we're live right now, and I'm here, and on the 13th, the bad guys are trying to buy InfoWars, and they're saying they're going to shut it down and do all this harassment and stalking of me and the rest of it.
[00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:13.140]  Regardless of whatever happens with that, I intend...
[00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:15.859]  To stay on the air one way or another.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.460]  But this attack against me is just a broadside attack on all of you and is a harbinger, and I'm a canary in the coal mine, of the larger things they want to do.
[00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:41.000]  Hell, Hillary's on TV twice the last month, and John Kerry and all of them, Eric Schmidt of Google, I mean, they're all there saying, we want to use UN troops and NATO to censor Americans, and we want to shut everybody down and put them in prison and put people in camps during the next...
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.759]  Fake pandemic if they criticize our response.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.640]  I mean, these are real clips we've played.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:57.960]  This is the normalization of serious, hardcore, totalitarian garbage, and they know I've been the tip of the spear.
[00:26:58.099 --> 00:27:02.859]  Our guests, our crew, our reports, the films, the special reports, the articles.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.299]  And they know.
[00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:10.420]  That InfoWars is an internet archive of this critical knowledge.
[00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:11.579]  So go to InfoWars.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.240]  You still can.
[00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:12.880]  Download it.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.380]  Mirror it.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:13.759]  Save it.
[00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:14.940]  It always belongs to the people.
[00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.000]  It belongs to you.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.220]  Celebrate it.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:17.900]  Share it.
[00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:20.299]  And this will backfire on these tyrants and we will beat them.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:29.240]  But this is a serious war of wills between these control freak sicko tyrants and the people of America and the world that just want to be free.
[00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:41.190]  They are turning the tyranny up to maximum because they're losing everywhere and populists are being elected all over the globe and the system is in absolute total panic mode.
[00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:50.150]  So I'm working with a lot of new folks and I'm working with folks that don't care if they get targeted and it's all done properly.
[00:27:50.730 --> 00:28:06.390]  Outside sponsors, outside groups, outside organizations that own and run The Alex Jones Network, alexjones.network, and working with outside groups that are launching Real Alex Jones,
[00:28:06.609 --> 00:28:13.670]  totally separate group, realalexjones.com, and other groups that are going to be behind alexjones.live.
[00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:24.069]  And it is my intention now to do three shows a day, seven days a week, to counter this response.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.500]  Instead of one show, three shows.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.480]  And you notice I'm feeling great, looking good, enjoying things.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.539]  I was kind of asleep.
[00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.529]  You know, I was always counting on others to finally win the big war, but I realize it's my responsibility.
[00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:53.650]  I realize we're so prominent and so effective against the enemy that I just have a responsibility to my children, and by extension all of you, because my children will grow up in a world with your children, that I'm just turning it on ultra-maximum.
[00:28:53.769 --> 00:29:02.029]  Because watching Trump at 78 work harder than me, and I'm hard-working, has really made me up the bar.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.859]  So I hiked six miles today, got up at 5 a.m., and I swam a mile.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:16.880]  And after my youngest daughter goes to sleep tonight, I'm going to go ahead and swim another mile.
[00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:20.319]  And it's so enjoyable.
[00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:21.519]  I love it.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.240]  Because I'm doing it not because I hate the globalists to break their will.
[00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.819]  That's a side derivative.
[00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:29.640]  I'm doing it because I love humanity.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.299]  I don't fight tyranny because I hate the tyrants.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.500]  Though I do hate them.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.839]  I do it because I love the people behind me I'm defending.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:48.339]  So, as I've told you a thousand times, and I'll say it again, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.559]  I've been holding back my real capabilities.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.480]  Almost a shame of it.
[00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:12.769]  It's a little scary, but I have decided, and I'm just now accessing the genetic memory codes to release my full potential against the New World Order.
[00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:27.609]  Good luck, globalist, because if you thought Alex Jones was a problem before, I want you to throw everything you've got at me.
[00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:35.089]  Whatever you think it is you need to do, under my very life, I am committed to this fight.
[00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:35.990]  I'll never commit suicide.
[00:30:36.349 --> 00:30:43.210]  But I am 100% committed to maximum resistance to you because history is happening.
[00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:51.670]  And we're actually seeing victory and we have the initiative and humanity is turning the tide against the pedophile, transhumanist, Satanist.
[00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.930]  And we are going to win.
[00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.349]  So I'll say it again.
[00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:58.450]  I do know how this is going to end.
[00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.549]  The New World will be defeated.
[00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.950]  The question is how long and how costly will it be?
[00:31:02.769 --> 00:31:09.730]  And if you want to fight, you better know you got one, you've been getting one, and you're about to get a lot more of them.
[00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:14.150]  So I want everybody now watching me.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.420]  And watching this when it's archived later, everywhere, to re-upload it.
[00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:21.259]  My shows have always been copyright-free.
[00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:22.339]  They've always been free to air.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.420]  This belongs to you, all of this.
[00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:30.960]  And we have ironclad documents and contracts on the website, and we filed in federal court and said, you can't sell my name.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.579]  You can't get real Alex Jones.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.380]  You can't do it.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.200]  We're going to block it.
[00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:35.839]  And the U.S. proceeds, okay, we won't do that.
[00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:36.140]  You're right.
[00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:37.279]  Oh, God, I just did it.
[00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:39.480]  Oh, God, well, you'll figure it out later, huh?
[00:31:40.339 --> 00:31:45.579]  Because they don't care how much money they gotta spend just having that claim to try to come in and set that precedent.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.039]  But everybody's gonna see it, and a Streisand effect has now been triggered.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.539]  This is a big deal.
[00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:53.240]  This affects all of you.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.460]  So go to our sponsor, separate from InfoWars, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:54.450]  I'm defending all these federal attacks, all these deep state operations.
[00:32:55.250 --> 00:33:00.789]  We are in federal and state court with them claiming they own my name and own my social media.
[00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:07.009]  And it will cost, up against their tens of millions a year they spend suing me, a million to defeat them.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.160]  And the cavalry's coming and a lot of other stuff's happening.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.640]  But I tend to rely on myself and the crew.
[00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:19.319]  So go to realalexjones.com and make a donation right now to the Legal Defense Fund.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.259]  This is your fight.

[00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:30.690]  AlexJones.live.
[00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:37.989]  And again, just in these studios, we've got this nice little broadcast area, areas for guests, all the side cameras.
[00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.449]  You can interview people right here on this screen.
[00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.630]  Cut back to this camera, please.
[00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.280]  And there's a whole podcasting area and all the rest that we haven't shown you yet.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.199]  Pretty cool here.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.219]  This is just an escape ship.
[00:34:51.059 --> 00:34:56.059]  We like to keep the Death Star behind the planet until the globalist fleet arrives.
[00:34:56.539 --> 00:35:04.280]  But there's a lot of stuff going on, and that's why your support is absolutely critical.
[00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:08.280]  And I'm just very pleased the enemy's completely walked into all of our traps.
[00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:11.880]  And again, you see Liberty rising and the...
[00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:16.400]  Zuckerbergs are capitulating and groveling and rolling over right now because they sense our victory.
[00:35:17.159 --> 00:35:23.000]  And the criminals will be brought to justice for all the things they've done to myself and others and to you.
[00:35:23.139 --> 00:35:24.199]  But we don't do it out of vengeance.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:31.940]  We do it out of justice to protect other people in the future from these criminals, from these packs of scum and what they've been doing to us modern pirates.
[00:35:34.019 --> 00:35:34.420]  So...
[00:35:37.219 --> 00:35:39.980]  The media warns Trump is going to come after the American people.
[00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:41.000]  Kamala Harris does.
[00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:41.679]  Biden does.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.300]  All of them.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.340]  But who's really coming after you?
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.599]  The federal government with the military training to kill the American people.
[00:35:48.739 --> 00:35:50.440]  Not our military themselves.
[00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:51.599]  They're being trained.
[00:35:51.679 --> 00:35:52.360]  They don't like it.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.679]  But the criminals that run the system.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.380]  So I first want to play Ron Paul.
[00:35:58.619 --> 00:35:59.880]  Talking about this.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:21.039]  U.S. military now authorized to kill American citizens and operate in the U.S. And then I'm going to come back with media warns if Trump wins, every possible bad thing will happen, though they're the ones doing everything they claim is happening while they collapse the border and start World War III. And then I'm going to play a short clip of the Democrat Party lawyers admitting it's not about money they want me shut down before they then are in the news saying,
[00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:21.860]  oh, we need money.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.019]  He won't give us the money.
[00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:25.210]  They didn't want money.
[00:36:25.289 --> 00:36:34.429]  They wanted me to bow to them and become their creature and let them fully possess my identity and turn me into a puppet, a marionette.
[00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.210]  Never going to happen.
[00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.809]  Hell will freeze over.
[00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.449]  You can put a gun to my head.
[00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.469]  It won't happen.
[00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:41.210]  Impossible.
[00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:42.789]  Cannot do it.
[00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:44.210]  Cannot sell out.
[00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:45.230]  Cannot back down.
[00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.010]  Cannot make me run.
[00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:51.010]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:56.860]  Because these old bears raised on shotguns But I could give out.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.760]  That's why it's so obvious.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:04.019]  If you don't back Alex Jones, everything I've said has come true, and I'm telling you the next enemy operation, and they can't stand it.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:12.079]  If the enemies of freedom can't stand this broadcast, what the hell are you doing not flooding us with word of mouth, prayer, and support?
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.179]  The AlexJonesWord.com.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.340]  The Legal Defense Fund.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.800]  Flood it.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.340]  Look at this.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:16.980]  It's happening right now.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.019]  I've got to fight these bastards.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.800]  They spend ten times the money we do.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.480]  We still beat them.
[00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:23.019]  Long term, we are.
[00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:24.420]  Look at their law figures.
[00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:25.800]  Everybody else destroys them within a year.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.460]  Not us.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.360]  And we're getting smarter by the day.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.139]  And we got whistleblowers getting ready to come out from inside their operations.
[00:37:33.099 --> 00:37:38.500]  Oh, and other big ones, probably in the next few days, on something even bigger with Tim Walls.
[00:37:39.539 --> 00:37:41.139]  The October surprise.
[00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:43.760]  Hillary's been worrying about so much.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:49.440]  No matter what happens to me, I'm afraid the information will come out.
[00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:07.340]  So, let's go ahead and play these clips, and then I will return with the actual documents.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:07.820]  Stay with us.
[00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:15.179]  U.S. military now is authorized to kill Americans on U.S. soil.
[00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:16.480]  Send in the troops.
[00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:18.559]  We need you to shoot a couple of these people.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.300]  They're opposing our policies.
[00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:26.360]  They're demonstrating against COVID rules or something they'll come up with.
[00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.699]  So I think it's very, very dangerous.
[00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:31.400]  Hopefully people wake up.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:37.780]  Maybe people say, well, this was just a political stunt for the campaign or something like that to act tough.
[00:38:38.239 --> 00:38:44.320]  But I tell you what, sometimes they come up and nobody warned us that they were going to do this.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.800]  It wasn't discussed in the Congress and it's been sitting there.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:57.039]  The main thing that most people should have known about is that you're supposed to use the federal military to enforce laws.
[00:38:57.549 --> 00:39:05.510]  Yeah, honestly, when you first sent it over, I started over the weekend, I was looking at it and I thought, surely this is a hysterical exaggeration.
[00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.769]  This guy, you can actually put up that first link if you can in a second when you get back over there.
[00:39:11.429 --> 00:39:16.829]  But I thought for sure this was someone just kind of, you know, a little bit too conspiratorial.
[00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:40.789]  Again, I thought this has got to be an exaggeration.
[00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:45.650]  I went and looked and actually go to the next one because this explains what it is.
[00:39:45.889 --> 00:39:46.809]  Now, it's not a law.
[00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.050]  It's a DOD directive.
[00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.829]  So this is, you know, the administrative state where they take over.
[00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.170]  They don't pass laws.
[00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:55.730]  They are laws unto themselves.
[00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.829]  Go to the next one if you can because this is what they're talking about.
[00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.010]  And I went and I read this secondly.
[00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:04.530]  And it talks about a reissued DOD directive.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.539]  That was reissued just on September 27th, 2024.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.380]  It governs the Department of Defense intelligence activities and now includes provisions authorizing lethal force in certain circumstances.
[00:40:19.699 --> 00:40:23.880]  And it supplants the 2016 version, which did not mention that.
[00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:26.480]  So I read all of this too, which is someone else's analysis.
[00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:28.840]  I said, okay, this sounds even more troubling.
[00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:31.079]  I want to go look at the document itself.
[00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:32.610]  And so, go to the next one.
[00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.449]  I actually went and looked at the DOD Directive.
[00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:49.769]  It's DOD Directive 5240.01, DOD Intelligence and Intelligence Related Activities and Defense Intelligence Component Assistance to Law Enforcement Agencies, et cetera, et cetera, and other civil authorities, September 27th.
[00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.030]  Now, go to the next one.
[00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.929]  I'm just gonna get to this really quick so I can, just so people, this is on their own website.
[00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.409]  Now, this is Section 3 of that directive.
[00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:02.860]  Assistance to law enforcement agencies and other civil authorities.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.539]  Now go to the next one.
[00:41:04.659 --> 00:41:06.119]  Now this is levels of authority.
[00:41:06.699 --> 00:41:08.199]  This is section 3.3.
[00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:29.190]  Defense intelligence components may provide personnel to assist a federal department or agency including a federal law enforcement agency or a state or local law enforcement agency when lives are in danger in response to such a request For such assistance in accordance with the following approval authorities.
[00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:30.610]  Now here are the authorities.
[00:41:30.769 --> 00:41:33.250]  I'm sorry to get so far into the woods here, but go to the next one.
[00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:50.789]  Now you go down here to section C. Assistance in responding with assets with potential for lethality, and I underline this, I highlighted it,
[00:41:51.030 --> 00:42:03.510]  or any situation where it is reasonably foreseeable that providing the requested assistance may involve the use of force that is likely to result in lethal force, including death or serious bodily injury.
[00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.610]  I'm sorry to bog the discussion down with that, Dr.
[00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:09.210]  Paul, but I really wanted to hone in on this as their actual document.
[00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.670]  It's not just someone's analysis.
[00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:16.639]  What would a second Donald Trump term look like?
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.000]  Well, he cannot be the next president.
[00:42:20.179 --> 00:42:22.019]  Because if he is...
[00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:24.860]  You can't imagine the things that he's going to do.
[00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:26.639]  Mexico, Canada.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.739]  We can't go to Canada because eventually Canada will become annexed to America.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.739]  And shoot visitors to the White House.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.059]  Yeah.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.099]  That means he can shoot the First Lady.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:41.139]  We're going to see violence the likes of which we didn't even see on January 6th.
[00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.889]  Make it illegal to run against him, to throw his opponents in jail, to shut down the media.
[00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.170]  He will make himself into the Fuhrer and he will make everybody raise their hand and salute him.
[00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:54.769]  Using martial law against the American people.
[00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:56.150]  Terminate the Constitution.
[00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.050]  Rewrite the Constitution.
[00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.909]  Create mass internment camps.
[00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.269]  Throw everyone into Gitmo.
[00:43:03.429 --> 00:43:08.650]  Might be sent to jail or their rights might be suppressed, especially minority groups in society.
[00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:11.969]  You might have any number of things happen to you and your family.
[00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.670]  Every one of us, our freedom, our liberty, none of us is safe.
[00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:19.070]  It's going to have people around him executing against an enemy's list.
[00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.190]  Assassinate generals.
[00:43:21.469 --> 00:43:25.349]  Ordering troops to attack American citizens.
[00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.269]  Trump's very well armed and extremist base will try to kill people.
[00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:31.929]  He's going to basically burn the House down.
[00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.550]  He will unravel the institutions of our democracy.
[00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.989]  Draw similarities between Mussolini and Hitler.
[00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:40.570]  Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.
[00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.409]  Makes Donald Trump even more dangerous.
[00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:43.750]  Wants to take away your vote.
[00:43:43.949 --> 00:43:46.130]  Senate and the House are immediately going to be paralyzed.
[00:43:46.409 --> 00:43:49.150]  People will begin in their minds to censor themselves.
[00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.070]  They might say, well maybe I shouldn't say this.
[00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.309]  This is the end of democracy.
[00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.730]  I think that could be the end of our democracy.
[00:43:55.909 --> 00:43:58.829]  Democracy is dead if Trump is re-elected.
[00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:01.130]  Goes you up to Putin, that democracy will be at risk.
[00:44:01.329 --> 00:44:05.250]  The absolute destruction of the Justice Department as we know it.
[00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:08.409]  The Justice Department could be entirely transformed.
[00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.210]  I am really concerned about that.
[00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:14.389]  Every person who was associated with the attempted coup elevated in the administration.
[00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.230]  He's reelected.
[00:44:15.269 --> 00:44:17.090]  He will curb transgender rights.
[00:44:17.369 --> 00:44:18.550]  The end of the rule of law.
[00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.750]  Arrest political opponents.
[00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:24.190]  To persecute, not prosecute, but persecute his enemies.
[00:44:24.429 --> 00:44:26.329]  Take a wrecking ball to the rule of law.
[00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:29.210]  He's going to make the law everyone else will have to follow.
[00:44:29.429 --> 00:44:33.730]  Vote for Donald Trump may mean the last election that you ever get to vote in.
[00:44:33.809 --> 00:44:38.369]  To go after the independent and free parts of American civic life.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.139]  He would tear down our institutions.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.280]  Burge the government of employees.
[00:44:42.539 --> 00:44:46.739]  Department by department effort to weaponize the powers of the government.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.320]  To use the military to quash protests.
[00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:52.699]  Reading the government of all democratic safeguards.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.199]  Junking American democracy as we have always known it.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.539]  That he would try to stay in office beyond a second term.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.219]  He would never leave office.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.099]  There's no question.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.219]  Trump is re-elected.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.820]  He won't leave.
[00:45:04.019 --> 00:45:06.320]  Donald Trump will never leave office voluntarily.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:17.639]  And what that means is that everybody who wants us to remain a republic has to put every other thing aside and work together urgently right now to stop that from happening.
[00:45:19.579 --> 00:45:25.880]  All right, so here we are at 7.35 Central Standard Time on 10-16-24.
[00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:31.440]  And coming up on November 5th is the most important election in world history.
[00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:34.449]  Less than 20 days away.
[00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.250]  And you just saw them saying Trump's a dictator.
[00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:38.269]  He's going to use the military on you.
[00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.909]  He's going to get you.
[00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.590]  Kamala Harris said it again last night.
[00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:45.110]  And then here they are with Biden telling the military to prepare for martial law and kill Americans.
[00:45:45.449 --> 00:45:47.250]  First time they put that in an official document.
[00:45:47.409 --> 00:45:51.250]  I mean, that is just sensational information.
[00:45:52.429 --> 00:45:53.449]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:45:54.670 --> 00:46:12.230]  The globalists want Americans to know, and they do this in Europe as well, anybody that resists, that they're going to destroy anybody Anybody that opposes them, anybody that criticizes them, anybody that exposes their operations because they can't stand anybody pointing out the hypocrisy and the lies and the fraud.
[00:46:12.429 --> 00:46:14.269]  So they're targeting truth tellers.
[00:46:14.369 --> 00:46:15.269]  And I know I'm stating...
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.860]  The obvious here, but people don't need to cower from this.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:27.059]  We need to unify and organize and get in the face of these tyrants politically, culturally, legally, and demand our rights and our freedoms.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:43.400]  These people are a dying, collapsing, corrupt bureaucracy that's been in control of this nation and Western world for decades and is trying to parlay our wealth and our name and our power into global government, a horrible, dystopic Anti-human,
[00:46:43.579 --> 00:46:47.460]  anti-natalist, anti-family crime syndicate, a cult.
[00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:52.900]  So I'm going to read now the documents that I was talking about if you just joined us.
[00:46:53.769 --> 00:47:04.969]  Oh, the new federal trustee told me this wasn't going to happen, and oh, don't worry, when they sell the assets of InfoWars, everybody knows you own your name, even though the Democrats had asked in filings to own it, and real Alex Jones on X, don't worry.
[00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:12.190]  And now they've put a filing in saying, yep, 13th Amendment, they actually say, I'll show it to you, does not apply to Alex Jones.
[00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:20.590]  That was passed at the end of the Civil War, saying no indentured servitude or slavery, and you can't own someone's likeness, and you can't make someone work for you.
[00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:27.679]  But they're saying, oh, we're owed a billion and a half dollars, so we need to shut his company down.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760]  They didn't want a settlement.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.179]  We need to shut him down everywhere because we don't want money.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.019]  But we own everything, including him.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.320]  It's just outrageous.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.719]  But they told you they owned your bodies with the poison shots.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.860]  They told you the poison shots would protect you when they erased your immune system and they got a UN tree to take control of your body and put people in camps.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:55.260]  So here's just a short compilation of the Democrat Party-funded lawyers, the same ones that are suing Elon Musk and Donald Trump.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:55.739]  Look it up.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.260]  One of the things that woke up Musk, that what he'd heard about me wasn't true.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.139]  It was run by PR firms, and he learned all that.
[00:48:04.719 --> 00:48:08.039]  So that's the good news, is they got a lot bigger enemies now than Alex Jones.
[00:48:08.159 --> 00:48:11.079]  But I'm right up there under Trump and Elon Musk, okay?
[00:48:11.659 --> 00:48:16.380]  It's like, you know, Elon Musk and Trump, and then Tucker Carlson, and then Joe Rogan, and then there's Alex Jones.
[00:48:17.179 --> 00:48:21.179]  But when it comes to hardcore info, I influence all those people.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.460]  And they admit that.
[00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:23.880]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.440]  Say, Alex Jones.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.360]  I talk to him all the time.
[00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:27.320]  He influences me.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.059]  He woke me up.
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.039]  Russell Brand.
[00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:29.980]  The list goes on and on.
[00:48:30.179 --> 00:48:31.679]  Megyn Kelly now saying Alex Jones is right.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.559]  They don't want me to be on air covering all of these things.
[00:48:36.679 --> 00:48:48.059]  So be sure and follow the great folks I'm working with and the great network I'm working with folks on at X at AJN, Alex Jones Network, just AJN Live.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.139]  And tell everybody else, hey, they're trying to take real Alex Jones.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.800]  They totally legally shouldn't be able to do that, but they're going to try.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.460]  We're going to fight them.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.019]  That takes money.
[00:48:58.139 --> 00:48:58.679]  We're going to do it.
[00:48:58.739 --> 00:48:59.239]  We need the support.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.840]  But regardless, I can work for other folks.
[00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.889]  I can work for other networks, and there's a lot in the works and a lot going on.
[00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:13.150]  Three different paths, three different operations, three different systems.
[00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.190]  Cut one head off, three grow.
[00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:19.849]  See how they like that.
[00:49:20.989 --> 00:49:31.690]  So, you've got my total commitment, but the last ingredient I need is your word of mouth, your prayer, and your support at thealexjonesstore.com and to follow The new stuff we're doing is going to be rolled out.
[00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:33.730]  Just like with Tucker, it'll take some time and only a few months.
[00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.349]  Regardless of what happens, Infowars survives.
[00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:39.250]  New groups, I'm sure, will work with Infowars and the new owners there.
[00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:43.670]  But I'm not putting anything up to hope or roll of the dice or any of this stuff.
[00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:47.969]  And I haven't even begun to fight, as John Paul Jones, the founder of the U.S. Navy, said.
[00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:51.289]  So, surrender?
[00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.889]  Never.
[00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.030]  I've only begun to fight.
[00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.789]  And I'm not putting a good face on that.
[00:49:54.929 --> 00:49:55.809]  We have the initiative.
[00:49:55.969 --> 00:49:57.010]  The world's waking up.
[00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.190]  Infowars' credibility is stronger than ever.
[00:49:59.269 --> 00:50:00.849]  And Infowars just means information war.
[00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.090]  They can try to own a website.
[00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:03.210]  They don't own that name.
[00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.449]  And they think taking that away will shut me down.
[00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:07.469]  Now they know it doesn't.
[00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.550]  So now they want to say, anywhere I go, they own the social media.
[00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:11.889]  Anything I get, they grab.
[00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.769]  I can have no personal name.
[00:50:14.389 --> 00:50:16.030]  I can't have the tools of my trade.
[00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.590]  Total violation of the 13th Amendment.
[00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.949]  So they're now not just attacking free speech with surveillance and censorship.
[00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:31.130]  They are literally saying the 13th Amendment does not apply in a federal filing by the U.S. trustee at the behest of the Democratic Party.
[00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.829]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:36.929 --> 00:50:38.769]  Okay, so let's play this short clip.
[00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:43.760]  Sandy Hook lawyers, Democrat Party lawyers, shut him down.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.820]  And then I'll show you going, he won't give us money.
[00:50:46.119 --> 00:50:47.940]  We want him to work for us and make us money.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.920]  No, that's not what they want.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.599]  So they play both of it.
[00:50:50.679 --> 00:50:51.659]  Oh, we want to shut him down.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.139]  Oh, we don't do settlements.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.460]  Oh, we want him to stop saying what he says.
[00:50:55.739 --> 00:50:57.280]  Oh, God, he won't give us money.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.960]  We have to get his real Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:01.099]  We can't have anything.
[00:51:01.539 --> 00:51:02.599]  We own that now.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.739]  It's in the terms of service.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.920]  Musk will shut it down if a court ordered them to hand it to him, which they won't.
[00:51:07.699 --> 00:51:12.000]  And don't worry, Elon Musk knows what this is, so you're going to have him to deal with.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.179]  Oh, yeah.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.360]  Just like I told you, Elon Musk was going to come out against the New World Order three years ago.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:21.840]  Did he do it?
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.940]  A little birdie tweet he told me right here in Austin.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.840]  Just like I told you, RFK Jr.
[00:51:31.059 --> 00:51:31.920]  would endorse Trump.
[00:51:32.929 --> 00:51:35.449]  On that Friday, on that Monday, people thought I made that up.
[00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:38.590]  It came directly from the highest levels of the campaign.
[00:51:39.269 --> 00:51:40.710]  And of course it came true, like I said.
[00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.530]  So, the globalists are getting their ass routed.
[00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:53.409]  It's not comfortable for Alex Jones or Rudolph Giuliani or Steve Manning or Owen Schroer.
[00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:58.449]  But as long as we're willing to take the heat, it's fine.
[00:51:58.769 --> 00:52:00.329]  All I ask is for you to back us.
[00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.210]  You got a good horse in the fight.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:08.760]  A good horse in the race, but I'm only as strong as you are.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.099]  And of course, I didn't barely even cover any of this thing on the main show.
[00:52:13.719 --> 00:52:23.300]  I'm trying to focus on all the other big, huge issues, getting Trump in, stopping World War III, finding where the 325,000 missing kids under Kamala and Mayorkas and Biden are.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.340]  But this is a big story.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.400]  If this was happening to anybody else, I'd be all over this like white on rice, like flies on shit.
[00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.429]  And you should be all over it.
[00:52:33.489 --> 00:52:34.170]  Holy Toledo.
[00:52:34.909 --> 00:52:38.389]  I told you you were next when they started taking off everything seven years ago.
[00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.250]  And now you see.
[00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.409]  All right, so overhead shot, please.
[00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:49.030]  I'm going to start reading this Bloomberg article and I'll actually show you the document itself.
[00:52:49.389 --> 00:52:50.289]  So here it is.
[00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:55.489]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee to sell social media accounts.
[00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.250]  I'm going to go through this.
[00:52:56.389 --> 00:52:57.070]  It'll probably take 20 minutes.
[00:52:57.329 --> 00:52:58.869]  So let's look back at what happened.
[00:52:58.969 --> 00:53:09.070]  I declared personal bankruptcy two years ago, and the company declares bankruptcy, and they go in and tell the judge I'm hiding $400 million and I'm a criminal and my dad's hiding all this money and we're master criminals.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:23.659]  And I'd go in there and file in the federal court, okay, I got $3 million and a small piece of property and a lake house in my house, and I'm worth, you know, total, everything, $10 million, if you exaggerate what I had.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.619]  And I said, I've never hidden that.
[00:53:25.679 --> 00:53:27.119]  I've never said anything about that.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:33.559]  Yeah, over the years, we've sold hundreds of millions of dollars of product, but we make like 35% on water filters and stuff like that.
[00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:34.920]  I mean, it's not gross.
[00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:35.699]  I mean, it's gross.
[00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:36.900]  It's not what you keep.
[00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:40.650]  And so the judge believes him, the federal judge.
[00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.710]  He appoints three different outside accounting firms that literally dig through everything.
[00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:50.829]  The IRS comes in and audits me, goes through everything, and finds out that exactly what I said was true.
[00:53:50.889 --> 00:53:56.289]  You think I'm going to lie in a federal court in sworn testimonies and being at the depositions?
[00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:58.329]  It was like seven or eight of them with the Justice Department there.
[00:53:58.429 --> 00:53:59.190]  Yeah, they got involved.
[00:53:59.949 --> 00:54:02.690]  Reading the U.S. Code, if you say one thing untrue, we're going to put you in prison.
[00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.250]  I'm like, I got mainline accounts and CPAs.
[00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:05.929]  I don't even touch the money.
[00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.590]  I'm so busy, I never had time to go to a little fishing house.
[00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:16.010]  I used to live there 10 years ago, and I bought a piece of property outside Austin.
[00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:16.769]  I never had time to go there.
[00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:17.730]  Okay, take it away.
[00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:19.409]  All I care about is freedom of speech.
[00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.809]  And they came to me and said, listen, you ready to sell out?
[00:54:22.929 --> 00:54:26.289]  You ready to, literally in the mediation, you ready to do what we say?
[00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:27.030]  I said, hell no.
[00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:29.010]  Well, no amount of money you can pass.
[00:54:29.929 --> 00:54:32.389]  And then they were dumb enough outside mediation to say that to my lawyers.
[00:54:32.449 --> 00:54:33.130]  They said, you can say it now.
[00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.170]  They said to us, outside mediation.
[00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:36.969]  So what a scandal that is.
[00:54:38.929 --> 00:54:47.269]  So, the first trustee, because they come through a wheel, a whole bunch of people wouldn't take the job to be a U.S. trustee.
[00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.989]  They can refuse it.
[00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.730]  Okay?
[00:54:50.889 --> 00:54:55.889]  So, they got the trustee, and then they've got a CRO that comes in, chief restructuring officer.
[00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.329]  Usually, it's a company that actually doesn't have money.
[00:54:58.909 --> 00:55:10.010]  And they immediately get rid of all of our sponsors and start making aspersions about me and claiming I'm a crook and filed in federal court that I had hidden sponsors from them that were on the air that I already put in a federal filing.
[00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:15.349]  I had as sponsors personally that I was trying to put into the bankruptcy, but Pat McGill wouldn't accept it.
[00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:24.309]  So we'd filed in court that we had this money months and months and months before, and then he still went and filed that he found secret money, and the judge thought that was really weird that he said that.
[00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:25.590]  They were trying to say I was a crook.
[00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:26.570]  They were desperate to find something.
[00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:34.329]  And then, 14 weeks ago, I see more security showing up, armed security, and I say, what's going on?
[00:55:34.389 --> 00:55:36.210]  They say, oh, it's being shut down tonight.
[00:55:36.409 --> 00:55:37.289]  I call my lawyers.
[00:55:37.369 --> 00:55:42.130]  They just heard Pat McGill and the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department ordered the company shut.
[00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:43.909]  I said, well, where's the court order?
[00:55:43.989 --> 00:55:44.750]  Well, it's not.
[00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:45.730]  He just says he can do it.
[00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.650]  And I go on air and I say, they're out here doing it.
[00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:50.389]  I'm having to sleep here.
[00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:51.010]  They don't have an order.
[00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:51.730]  I'm going to call the police.
[00:55:51.929 --> 00:55:54.530]  The private security company goes, yeah, that's actually true.
[00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:55.409]  We're not going to shut you down.
[00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:01.030]  We're good to go.
[00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:07.030]  We're good to go.
[00:56:10.099 --> 00:56:19.920]  Then they file another thing to shut us down, and on June 14th, it's all over the news, InfoWars will be shut down today, and the judge tells the U.S. trustee and the CRO, you can't do that to Alex Jones.
[00:56:20.039 --> 00:56:20.840]  He owns his company.
[00:56:21.099 --> 00:56:22.239]  He's in private bankruptcy.
[00:56:22.239 --> 00:56:26.579]  If you guys won't settle, then we can liquidate the assets, but that's it.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.199]  And of course, without Jones there, they're not worth really anything.
[00:56:31.269 --> 00:56:31.889]  And they go, that's fine.
[00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:32.469]  We want to shut down.
[00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:34.489]  The judge said, no, I'm going to leave Jones in control.
[00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:36.250]  They said, don't give him his bank accounts.
[00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:37.070]  He'll steal all the money.
[00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:43.130]  And he goes, you said this for two years and hired three outside accounting firms that his company had to pay for at the cost of $3 million.
[00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:45.949]  And it was all, everything he said was true.
[00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.510]  You never filed one thing of proof.
[00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.510]  The judge said, he talked for 40 minutes at him.
[00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.030]  He said, you're fired.
[00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.730]  You're fired.
[00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:54.530]  Hand Mr.
[00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:56.030]  Jones's bank accounts over today.
[00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.309]  But he said, I'm going ahead with the sale.
[00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.730]  Then they decided they didn't want that because Patriots might buy it.
[00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:05.070]  So the feds, the Justice Department, look it up.
[00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.150]  Justice Department seeks to block sale of InfoWars.
[00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.789]  And the judge says, no, I have the power to do that.
[00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:12.250]  I'm doing it.
[00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:15.030]  So then I said to my lawyers, watch.
[00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:17.849]  They'll start filing saying, okay, Soros is going to buy it.
[00:57:17.929 --> 00:57:19.570]  Sure as hell, Soros comes in through Media Matters.
[00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.610]  People go, how do you know this?
[00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:21.090]  I know.
[00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.429]  I know.
[00:57:21.869 --> 00:57:22.550]  That's what I do.
[00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:23.050]  I study them.
[00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.469]  He's always a State Department CIA bag man.
[00:57:26.469 --> 00:57:27.030]  He's the front guy.
[00:57:27.699 --> 00:57:30.940]  He's a zombie, so he's a son, but they're the placeholder.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.039]  And they say, we own Alex Jones, we own everything.
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.639]  And I go file, and the judge says, we're not doing that.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.539]  And the new U.S. trustee goes, oh yeah, that's not reasonable to say they own your name.
[00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:41.760]  File his 13th Amendment, you're right.
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:48.119]  And I told my lawyers, I said, watch, right before the sale, they'll sneak in a new filing saying, actually, we are selling his name, and we do own Alex Jones.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.400]  Get it today!
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.579]  And I'd imagine at the online auction, good guys will be locked out.
[00:57:55.599 --> 00:57:56.000]  It's online.
[00:57:56.119 --> 00:57:56.800]  They won't be able to bid.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:57.940]  Their computers will go down.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.920]  And the bad guys will get it.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.460]  That's just what's going to happen.
[00:58:02.539 --> 00:58:03.460]  Unless we expose it.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.099]  I mean, that's what I do.
[00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:06.340]  I know the enemy next move.
[00:58:07.059 --> 00:58:09.000]  And I'm not even saying the auction company would do that.
[00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:11.099]  What I'm saying is, this is what they do.
[00:58:11.239 --> 00:58:19.780]  When Elon Musk had a poll, tens of millions of voters, in the first hour, should Alex Jones be brought back, they DDoSed it and shut it down because 93% were saying, bring Alex Jones back.
[00:58:20.869 --> 00:58:26.510]  And Musk said, well, they attacked the poll, but we had tens of millions of votes and 90 plus percent Alex Jones, he's back.
[00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:29.170]  This is what they do.
[00:58:29.269 --> 00:58:31.190]  They're DDoSing, attacking InfoWars today.
[00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:32.530]  We're attacked every day.
[00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.409]  So, if it's nasty, if it can be done, they'll do it.
[00:58:36.429 --> 00:58:38.809]  It's the CIA that came out in court and the FBI running it all.
[00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:47.190]  So, I'm like, okay, well, I don't think they're going to allow good guys to buy this.
[00:58:47.969 --> 00:58:49.989]  They've already spent 70 plus million trying to shut me down.
[00:58:50.210 --> 00:59:00.570]  But, you know, maybe if we talk to the auction house and make sure and have them ready and have backup connections, you know, for folks and a whole new system they can fire up during or take, you know, stuff over the telephone.
[00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.170]  I know the enemy's got them on the line steps.
[00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:03.690]  They're already one step ahead of us, but it's okay.
[00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:05.889]  I'm just predicting that'll happen.
[00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:08.570]  So hopefully that doesn't happen because we're, you know, ahead of it.
[00:59:11.559 --> 00:59:21.920]  But really, the deep state, the Democrats will just try to buy it for a huge amount, and then through the charities it's given to, put it back in as donations to Democrats, because they're allowed to do all that, even though, you know, nobody else does, because it's illegal.
[00:59:22.639 --> 00:59:23.820]  I mean, I know all the tricks.
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.639]  That's what I do is study them.
[00:59:25.679 --> 00:59:26.860]  So here, I read you the headline.
[00:59:27.239 --> 00:59:33.139]  Let's continue analyzing this here tonight, live, uncensored, unfiltered, teleprompter-free, unlike Kamala Harris.
[00:59:35.139 --> 00:59:36.099]  So, that's what they said.
[00:59:36.099 --> 00:59:45.599]  So, the new trustee, who's got a name as a fair guy, won't do you any favors, but he's got major pressure on him, just told me in my face, no, no, we know you own Real Alex Jones.
[00:59:45.659 --> 00:59:46.400]  We know you own your name.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.639]  We'll carve that out for you.
[00:59:47.699 --> 00:59:48.179]  This is months ago.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.019]  Don't worry, Alex.
[00:59:49.019 --> 00:59:49.460]  This is not going to happen.
[00:59:49.739 --> 00:59:50.780]  And then now he files today.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.099]  Actually, that is the thing.
[00:59:52.619 --> 00:59:53.300]  We're saying that.
[00:59:53.559 --> 00:59:56.900]  So, they'll have him in a sale saying they own my name and own Real Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.480]  Have a following right here?
[01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:00.920]  Perfectly happened, like I said.
[01:00:02.159 --> 01:00:04.219]  So, That's where we are.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:10.860]  So there's some truth in this article and then a bunch of bull, but it's good to go through the history.
[01:00:11.019 --> 01:00:12.420]  You can kind of review the history of each paragraph.
[01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:14.400]  So let's start, may we?
[01:00:15.199 --> 01:00:18.500]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee aims to sell social media accounts.
[01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:21.940]  And then later they say, including his name.
[01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:34.219]  The trustee, federal, overseeing liquidation of Alex Jones' assets has sought bankruptcy court approval to sell the right-wing provocateur's personal social media accounts, plus his book and video game rights, which aren't big.
[01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:35.320]  And that you can do.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:43.119]  Jones' 16 social media accounts, book rights to the Great Reset and the War for the World, and the video game Alex Jones...
[01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:53.760]  Now Wars, which I don't even own, should be, I don't care, let's put that in there, should be added to the ongoing sale process for Jones Infowars Media Empire.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.480]  The empire is the giant audience, it's me, not some websites.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:05.159]  Trustee Christopher Murray told the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in a motion Tuesday that hit the news today.
[01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:15.909]  The trustee is tasked with liquidating Jones' assets that the Infowars parent company, Free Street Systems LLC, To help pay down the $1.5 billion defamation judgment.
[01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:16.510]  It wasn't a judgment.
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.250]  I was already found guilty.
[01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:24.690]  Related to the statements Jones made calling the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting a hoax.
[01:01:24.769 --> 01:01:26.170]  I just covered other people saying it.
[01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:28.269]  Even if I did do that, the way they say it's my right.
[01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:37.050]  Murray, in September, was given the green light by a Houston bankruptcy court to start auctioning off property for Jones' InfoWars Media platform.
[01:01:39.159 --> 01:01:43.579]  Including Infowars, intellectual property, the studio production equipment, according to the auctioneer website.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.559]  Now, they haven't claimed they own the crew next, but I'll imagine that's next.
[01:01:48.019 --> 01:01:56.139]  In fact, they've already said, oh, we want them to sign something and we'll give them a little severance, which I'm sure will be non-compete and that they are owned by the Democratic Party or something.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:07.239]  Murray has said Jones' personal IP has attracted interest from potential bidders and that adding it to the Infowars assets already on sale will increase recoveries.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:21.179]  Meanwhile, an auctioneer for the Infowars assets already set up a sale has said there has been a large volume of inquiries ranging from media companies to supplement and other e-commerce businesses and general investors like Media Matters and George Soros.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:28.579]  Now, that's on record in New York Post, AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, So everything I'm saying, you can pull up.
[01:02:29.219 --> 01:02:34.199]  Now, again, they're saying Alex Jones' IP is all of his words, all of his shows, all of his films.
[01:02:34.599 --> 01:02:39.019]  They list my films that a bunch of them are owned by the companies that distribute them.
[01:02:39.079 --> 01:02:41.000]  They don't even care if the video game's not owned by me.
[01:02:41.019 --> 01:02:41.980]  They just say it's theirs.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:42.920]  Why not?
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.260]  Hell, they own everybody.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.320]  They own your body, don't they?
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.599]  Hell, they got the military trained to kill you and take your guns.
[01:02:49.719 --> 01:02:50.860]  It's now official, public.
[01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:52.940]  Then they say Trump's going to do it.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.639]  So it's all just a giant legal lawyer deep state power grab.
[01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:03.699]  But the documents, three inches stick, are on InfoWars.
[01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:04.980]  We ought to show them.
[01:03:05.059 --> 01:03:06.559]  In fact, I'll do it on my main show tomorrow.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.840]  But we have contracts on the website going back decades and updated saying anything I do is free to air.
[01:03:12.099 --> 01:03:17.739]  The show, anything, you can tape it, air it anywhere you want, free to air, because people like to take my show and air it on commercial TV stations and stuff.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.480]  They got to have it for the station to say we're allowed to air this.
[01:03:20.599 --> 01:03:23.679]  So, again, it's like Linux creator said this is free to the world.
[01:03:24.139 --> 01:03:28.199]  They can't then say the creator's gone bankrupt so they own Linux because he made it and said it's free.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.119]  Like if I did a symphony or a painting or a song and said this belongs to the world, no rights.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.000]  I have no rights.
[01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:35.840]  You have all the rights.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.539]  But I have my own rights by giving it to everybody, including me.
[01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.469]  I pioneered that.
[01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.869]  Not even on purpose, because I wanted just to get it out to everybody.
[01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:45.230]  Been on the air 30 years.
[01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:48.489]  Back then, people wanted a letter with a law firm saying it.
[01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:50.710]  And we've told them all that, and they don't care.
[01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:53.510]  Because they now have admitted media matters.
[01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:59.650]  Oh, we want to get in and go in and ban him everywhere and say we own everything he ever said, because it's so devastating to them.
[01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:14.869]  The trustee and his advisors have received interest in His advisors, that's the Democratic Party, Sandy Hook people, from multiple parties in purchasing the social media accounts, in particular, the trustee said Tuesday.
[01:04:15.429 --> 01:04:24.010]  The rumble, the gab, the ex, all of them say, you can't transfer your private social media or sell it.
[01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:26.969]  It goes away.
[01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.949]  But they know that.
[01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:31.429]  They want to shut it down, like I just showed you them saying earlier.
[01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:38.489]  Jones' social media accounts that could go up for sale include his account on X, previously known as Twitter.
[01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:39.849]  Oh, his account.
[01:04:39.989 --> 01:04:40.769]  See, and they listed in there.
[01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:41.869]  Real Alex Jones.
[01:04:42.449 --> 01:04:48.050]  As well as accounts on Gab, Telegram, and former President Donald Trump's true social media company.
[01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:50.730]  Jones likely to fight sale.
[01:04:50.909 --> 01:04:56.929]  Jones maintains that his personal social media accounts aren't property of the bankruptcy estate and can't be sold.
[01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:06.210]  His bankruptcy lawyer, Vicki Driver of Elliott, Thompson& Gibson, LLP, told Bloomberg Law via email today, they are unalienable personal property and cannot be sold.
[01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:09.460]  Unwound from his name, image, and likeness, Driver said.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.840]  Further, the contracts with the social media companies do not allow for anyone other than Mr.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:22.440]  Jones to operate the personal accounts, and any third party doing this would violate the terms and conditions of such accounts, opening them up to liability.
[01:05:22.659 --> 01:05:32.719]  But they don't care, just like illegally spying on you and the FBI telling, and the White House, you know, having 50 million people censored on Facebook alone.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780]  That all came out in Congress.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.219]  Totally illegal, all of it.
[01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:38.760]  Just like disappearing 325,000 kids is illegal.
[01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:47.139]  Just like the U.S. trustee saying, the one before Chris Murray, just shut it down, sending armed men, we're here, get out of the building.
[01:05:47.199 --> 01:05:49.039]  I'm like, no you're not, I'm calling the police.
[01:05:49.619 --> 01:05:51.139]  Where's your document, dumbass?
[01:05:51.559 --> 01:05:53.619]  They weren't dumbasses, they were like, yeah, where is the document?
[01:05:54.119 --> 01:06:02.519]  I told the federal government, told me that, I had to call, I said, hey, you're not a dumbass, I actually said, you better call your company, you better call your boss, what are you doing?
[01:06:04.099 --> 01:06:06.500]  They're like, yeah, that's actually, well, whatever.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.800]  Well, they told us we need to get more people here, too, because you might cause a problem.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:17.000]  And then McGill gets up in that June 14th hearing, and he goes, we were just scared that Mr.
[01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:18.000]  Jones would cause a problem.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.099]  You know, there are guns in the building.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.139]  And the judge goes, what do you mean?
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.519]  Well, there's guns.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:24.760]  Mr.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.760]  Jones has guns.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.400]  So I got a safe gun.
[01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:38.650]  With shotguns and self-defense rifles in it, and I've got an instant-access pistol safe in my office, and my crew has concealed carry.
[01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:39.789]  Some of them wear them on their sides.
[01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:40.289]  Big deal.
[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.750]  We know we're a target.
[01:06:43.809 --> 01:06:47.590]  But again, implying violence, and the judge goes, well, that's not illegal.
[01:06:49.429 --> 01:06:58.489]  So they come with armed security to shut us down without an order, without a ticket, without a citation, without one stick of bubblegum wrapping.
[01:06:59.789 --> 01:07:00.989]  Not a piece of toilet paper.
[01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:01.969]  Not birdcage liner.
[01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:05.530]  That's how crazy they are.
[01:07:06.929 --> 01:07:11.730]  It's illegal for Kamala Harris in Mayorkas to disappear through 25,000 kids, many found in sex slavery.
[01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:17.949]  New York Times admits in slave labor, as young as 10 years old, sleeping at factories on the floor.
[01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:19.349]  You're like, how is that?
[01:07:19.809 --> 01:07:20.989]  They're just doing it.
[01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:24.050]  Biden authorized a month ago heavy U.S. missiles to start bombing Russia.
[01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:24.869]  They backed off.
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:28.710]  Because Russia threatened nuclear war, but I mean, these are crazy people.
[01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:34.090]  They've announced in executive orders and Pentagon announcements they're training to kill the American people and take your guns.
[01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:37.789]  They're going, oh, martial law, Trump, martial law, oh God, the military.
[01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:41.550]  Did Trump kill Ashley Babbitt and other U.S. citizens at the Capitol that day?
[01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:42.510]  Two women, two men?
[01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:53.130]  Jones' social media accounts could go up for sale, including his account, his account, on X, previously known as Twitter.
[01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:59.190]  As well as accounts on Gab, Telegram, and former President Donald Trump's social media company, True Social.
[01:07:59.429 --> 01:08:00.630]  Jones likely to fight the sale.
[01:08:00.769 --> 01:08:01.389]  And I read over that.
[01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:14.809]  In a video posted on X account on Wednesday, Jones said he plans to launch the Alex Jones network in response to the potential closure of InfoWars on November 13th, the auction date set for InfoWars assets sale.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.819]  My guests, myself, and my crew are the info war, Jones said.
[01:08:19.079 --> 01:08:24.739]  The info war goes on no matter what happens to a website or a shopping cart or this equipment.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:31.420]  Murray said he only seeking to sell the estate's interest in the social media accounts.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:39.439]  Oh, the interest in the accounts, but not license the use of Jones' persona or force him to post content on the accounts.
[01:08:39.579 --> 01:08:42.939]  No, just take it away and shut it down when it's mine and personal.
[01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:45.250]  Because it's clear they can't do that.
[01:08:45.409 --> 01:08:46.710]  So now they're taking the first bite.
[01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:50.989]  Oh, well, just the state's interest in his name.
[01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:53.409]  We just own a piece of it.
[01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:58.270]  I'm like saying black people are two-thirds human.
[01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:01.329]  I'm one-third human.
[01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:02.970]  I got a little right.
[01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:06.430]  They could take everything away from me, but you're still free to die in the ditch.
[01:09:08.159 --> 01:09:18.640]  Murray said he's only seeking to sell the estate's interest in the social media accounts, not for license or use of Jones' persona or force him to post content on the accounts according to the motion.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:28.279]  The social media accounts are primarily used by Jones to promote the InfoWars broadcast and brand his books and video game and therefore are integral to free speech systems business.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:39.199]  Yeah, I personally have been using my social media to promote my free speech, which is on InfoWars, but almost all the posts are other people.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.279]  Let's pull up my X account and show people right now.
[01:09:42.619 --> 01:09:44.760]  Trump, Elon Musk, common people.
[01:09:45.659 --> 01:09:50.119]  Other people's articles, other people's speeches, other guests I'm having on.
[01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:52.180]  It's about exposing evil.
[01:09:53.159 --> 01:09:58.520]  But they say, oh, because he linked to Infowars, that's ours too.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.560]  Flimsy garbage argument.
[01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:16.350]  Here's the key.
[01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:35.270]  The liquidation comes after the bankruptcy court in June, converted Jones' personal 11 to Chapter 7, and tossed out free speech systems' separate bankruptcy, allowing the Sandy Hook victims' families, because, you know, I killed the kids, and others to pursue their judgments in state courts.
[01:10:35.489 --> 01:10:45.970]  The Chapter 7 trustee is represented by Jones-Murray LLP and Pointer-Hedges LLP. Is the feed frozen?
[01:10:46.069 --> 01:10:47.689]  Because I see myself frozen up there on screen.
[01:10:52.449 --> 01:10:53.430]  Well, we'll take a break.
[01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:56.569]  Slight crash.
[01:10:56.729 --> 01:10:58.350]  We're just testing out the backup system.
[01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:59.189]  So we're still on air?
[01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:02.470]  All right.
[01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.949]  Fabulous.
[01:11:04.109 --> 01:11:04.710]  All right.
[01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:07.270]  Well, this studio's been here for years.
[01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.930]  This is a backup.
[01:11:08.449 --> 01:11:14.130]  We're not going to reveal the other stuff till certain points, obviously, with the great folks we're working with.
[01:11:15.789 --> 01:11:18.729]  And I'm, you know, certain they'll continue to attack that.
[01:11:18.789 --> 01:11:19.149]  That's fine.
[01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.149]  People are here for the fight.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:29.880]  But continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, let me actually show you now the actual document.
[01:11:31.039 --> 01:11:34.920]  You know, did I bring that filing?
[01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:35.939]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:37.920]  Here it is.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.460]  So, let me actually show you the document.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.779]  I think we posted this on the next.
[01:11:41.859 --> 01:11:43.239]  I'm not sure if we did, but it's all over the news.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.600]  It's a link to the Bloomberg article.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.220]  Because I've been telling people about this for months, and they're like, let's see the document!
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.159]  When I'd already put each document up ten times, but it wouldn't be in my show talking about it.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.340]  I'd be just referencing it.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.539]  Oh, that's not happening.
[01:11:55.939 --> 01:11:56.539]  Yeah, right.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.300]  Nobody's trying to take your social media.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.739]  Yeah, nobody's trying to use your name and say they own it.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.020]  I mean, come on, man.
[01:12:02.199 --> 01:12:03.060]  This is America.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.720]  That's not going on.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:14.199]  And it's all right here where they say, oh, it doesn't violate his 13th Amendment to take his name, the Alex Jones Show.
[01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:19.180]  It doesn't violate the 13th Amendment to say we take away his social media.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.300]  No, no, no.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:28.239]  It's all just fine what we're doing.
[01:12:35.659 --> 01:12:40.550]  Now, I'm going to take a break.
[01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.289]  And I'm going to air clip one.
[01:12:47.069 --> 01:12:47.569]  Okay.
[01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:57.850]  And then I will continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:06.899]  You know, we've all been brought up watching TV and sports and everything's fine and we're in a quasi-free country and everything's woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.579]  Are you noticing how it's getting dark?
[01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.220]  Are you noticing the tyranny all around you?
[01:13:11.279 --> 01:13:14.880]  Are you noticing the crime and the homelessness and the police not responding?
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.560]  I mean, are you noticing the inflation?
[01:13:16.739 --> 01:13:18.060]  Are you noticing the death?
[01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:21.539]  Are you noticing your neighbors dropping dead from heart attacks when they're 35 years old?
[01:13:21.739 --> 01:13:31.470]  Are you noticing all of the garbage that That is unfolding and happening and going on.
[01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:39.949]  Because it's only going to get more intense As all of this unfolds.
[01:13:40.069 --> 01:13:41.829]  And I don't know what I can say.
[01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.770]  I don't know what I can do.
[01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:47.289]  I don't know what it's going to take for you to wake up.
[01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:49.529]  But they are preparing martial law.
[01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.350]  They are preparing all the control grids.
[01:13:51.449 --> 01:13:54.069]  They are preparing the total enslavement systems.
[01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:57.850]  They are working out the kinks here tonight.
[01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:59.310]  That happens anywhere.
[01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.649]  And I mean, I just don't even know what to say.
[01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.050]  It's so in your face.
[01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:04.869]  It's so obvious.
[01:14:05.109 --> 01:14:06.090]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:14:06.899 --> 01:14:17.539]  So I hope that you will follow the new operations and folks I'm working with at AJNLive on X. Obviously, there's going to be a big fight where they try to take real Alex Jones.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.779]  It's going to blow up in their face.
[01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:24.560]  And they're going to try to take a new handle of, I get it, and Musk is going to have to come in in court and beat them.
[01:14:24.859 --> 01:14:27.460]  And it's very heartening to be reached out to by those folks.
[01:14:28.199 --> 01:14:30.800]  And because they understand this is an attack on everyone.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.840]  And that's basically just what it comes down to.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:34.520]  So...
[01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:41.109]  I'm just very, very thankful for all of the incredible support.
[01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:45.689]  I'm very, very thankful to all the people that have supported us.
[01:14:45.789 --> 01:14:55.909]  I'm very thankful to the crew and the work that they have done and how tirelessly they have been through hell in this fight as well.
[01:14:55.989 --> 01:15:04.489]  But they understand that freedom isn't free and that history is happening right now in front of everyone, in front of the world.
[01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.229]  And we'll go live again tomorrow night.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.640]  We're going live again tomorrow night to work the bugs out here.
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:15.260]  As I told you, I'm going to start multiple shows a day in the interim to see what happens to Infowars.
[01:15:15.579 --> 01:15:17.479]  And we've got the podcasting area set up.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.220]  That's really cool.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.979]  And a lot more that we'll be debuting here with the folks that we're working for, working with.
[01:15:24.819 --> 01:15:27.560]  And, you know, the system will try to say, oh, we're going to shut them down too.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.359]  Well, the law is 100% clear on that too.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.479]  I can work for people.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.439]  I've got my First Amendment.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.180]  Sure, Hillary Clinton and the Deep State and all of them are trying to get rid of it.
[01:15:34.819 --> 01:15:36.260]  They're trying to shut it all down.
[01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:46.619]  But if we simply do not submit and simply do not roll over to the globalists, we can and we will have a future.
[01:15:46.779 --> 01:15:52.680]  But Our forebearers were not cowardly, dumb idiots that wanted to roll over and die.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.819]  And Zapata said it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:03.420]  In my experience historically, looking at history and my own experiences, people that live on their feet live longer and better than those that try to live on their knees.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.640]  People that live on their knees get fed on by the wolves.
[01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:07.750]  So this is really common sense.
[01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:08.909]  I'm going to end the broadcast now.
[01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:10.630]  I appreciate everybody.
[01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:12.489]  Appreciate everybody tuning in.
[01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:17.649]  And we're going to archive this now to X. I hope that everybody shares it.
[01:16:17.789 --> 01:16:18.810]  We'll do a hard cut here.
[01:16:18.989 --> 01:16:20.869]  And I appreciate the crew coming in tonight.
[01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:30.949]  And now you've seen the history of them saying the 13th Amendment does not exist for Alex Jones, literally in the federal filing that's linked in the Bloomberg article that I showed you 10 times.
[01:16:32.609 --> 01:16:33.869]  So thank you very much.
[01:16:34.069 --> 01:16:34.829]  God bless you all.
[01:16:44.949 --> 01:16:51.090]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a golden driver
