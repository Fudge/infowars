[00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.710]  The mysteries of the universe.
[00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.929]  The age-old questions.
[00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.589]  Where did humankind come from?
[00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.989]  What is our ultimate destiny?
[00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.010]  The answers to these fundamental questions are hiding in plain view.
[00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.370]  We came from the universe.
[00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.850]  We came from all that is creation.
[00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.750]  We are part of the universe.
[00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.770]  We come out of this creation.
[00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.009]  The answer to the question of our existence is wonderment.
[00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:49.429]  The planet Earth is home to our species, orbiting a standard sun two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.390]  Here you see a super galaxy, a cluster of galaxies.
[00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.130]  Each one of these a galaxy on its own.
[00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.590]  Hundreds of millions photographed by Hubble.
[00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.409]  And Hubble isn't even getting out of our backyard.
[00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.469]  We are in the middle of wonderment, the middle of incredible creation.
[00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.549]  Humanity has not even dreamed or the mind imagined the potential of our species.
[00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:23.689]  People say they want to travel to space as if it's some distant place when we are part of the universe living on an incredibly rich and gorgeous planet.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:35.500]  In the middle of a universe with hundreds and hundreds of billions of photographed galaxies, themselves containing hundreds of billions of stars and planetary systems very similar to our own.
[00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.540]  Our planet is like a grain of sand at an endless beach.
[00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:49.450]  But still, despite the fact that it's so tiny, all of our species history has taken place on this globe.
[00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:59.709]  All the kings, all the tyrants, the heroes, the families, the little children, the discoveries, the passions that were felt.
[00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.090]  All of those experiences have taken place here on this planet.
[00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:14.729]  And though our individual lives are finite, We are connected to our ancestors and their discoveries, their triumphs, their misfortunes.
[00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:19.289]  And we reach forward into the future, towards our future progeny.
[00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:24.669]  And as long as our species is not destroyed, we truly live forever.
[00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.469]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.650]  We've got some difficult days ahead.
[00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.270]  But I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.789]  I just want to do God's will.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.379]  And he's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:48.960]  And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land.
[00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:59.919]  I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.419]  We gotta come together.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.319]  Whether you believe in that or not, you gotta decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.259]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will day in and day out make pure mistakes in governing themselves.
[00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.180]  I'm gonna say it right now, real clear.
[00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.680]  I love everybody.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.159]  No matter what color your beautiful skin is, what I care about is your heart and your guts and your mind.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.460]  And you're under attack by these Satanists, and they want to kill you, and they want to kill your children.
[00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.159]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:48.289]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.949]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.650]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.370]  So if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
[00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.310]  I want unity.
[00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:20.720]  Under a code of freedom and liberty and justice and coming together and working together and being strong and that's what InfoWars is and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much because we love God and God loves humanity.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.699]  And I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.480]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.259]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI. What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.139]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:50.500]  We will keep all the stars.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.660]  We will colonize.
[00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.680]  We will green dead worlds.
[00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.319]  We will go interdimensional.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.160]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.980]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:10.949]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, In a race for the future.
[00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.709]  And we will break the enemy.
[00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.569]  We will break the pedophiles.
[00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:22.250]  We will break the Satanists because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it.
[00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.470]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through.
[00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:28.870]  And now we're going to go through what Christ did.
[00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.610]  And we're going to go through it and we're going to be destroyed but reborn on the other side.
[00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.029]  So that's the question.
[00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.769]  Will we become extinct like so many other species?
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.199]  We can go to space.
[00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.040]  We can create computers.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.560]  We can theorize quantum mechanics.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.939]  Picasso, Beethoven.
[00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.680]  Can we take control of our destiny?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.699]  Can we have a species-wide debate about our system?
[00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.980]  Or is death of humankind all that's waiting in our future?
[00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.000]  That decision, to a great extent, depends on you.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.459]  So the ball is in your court.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.339]  We're good to go.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.920]  is simply game-changing.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.519]  Now, as you know, green superfoods for decades have been all the rage because they really work and because you absorb things better in the gut.
[00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.019]  And there's a lot of great ones out there.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.259]  But ladies and gentlemen, Optimal Human has the highest quality ingredients, 90 plus ingredients.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.279]  It does amazing things.
[00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.980]  I've been taking it for months and I want you to get it.
[00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.120]  And understand this, it's leading competitor is amazing.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.540]  And I've been using it and love it.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:08.480]  But this has the same ingredients and even more, and it's stronger, and it's the same serving amount, but for a lower price.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.759]  So the leading competitor, everybody knows their name.
[00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.079]  It starts with A and ends with G. This is amazing.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.680]  Go to the AlexJonesStore.com and get Awful Human.
