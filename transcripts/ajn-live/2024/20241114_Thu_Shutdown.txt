[00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:09.250]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.990]  All of us together are going to lift the curse off of this country and we're going to send the globalists to prison!
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.199]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.039]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.379]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:33.380]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.119]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.219]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.899]  Listen!
[00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.820]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.060]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.859]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.599]  All of us together are going to lift the curse off of this country and we're going to send the globalists to prison.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.819]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.640]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.019]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.980]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.700]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:38.859]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.519]  Listen!
[00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.400]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.680]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:13.120]  Many of the supplements available at thealexjonesstore.com are the latest cutting edge, highest rated game changers that have been discovered through research.
[00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.280]  And that's wonderful.
[00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.789]  But many of the products there are known, tried-and-true staples like elderberry.
[00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:36.530]  It's just that ours is high quality, very strong, concentrated, and at a competitive price, especially if you get more than one model, then it's some of the best prices you'll find anywhere, and your purchase funds are operations against the globalists, a 360 win.
[00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.330]  So get your concentrated elderberry, particularly right now in the fall and winter, and you take it as a preventative Ahead of time.
[00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.629]  And what the wives' tales said hundreds of years ago, now with modern science, we know it boosts your immune system.
[00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:51.669]  It's antiviral.
[00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.689]  So now, high-quality, ultimate elderberry, scientific name Sambuscus, available right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.050]  It's good for your body, and it funds the info war.
[00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.949]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.509]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.330]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.210]  I'm still not in shape.
[00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.349]  Alex, how are you doing?
[00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.590]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:21.349]  I'm not going to bite it.
[00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.969]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:26.770]  Oh, no.
[00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.669]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.669]  Listen, I did it all.
[00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.780]  From the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.719]  That's why, right here.
[00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.080]  Ultimate Seamoss.
[00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.539]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.000]  Of the ocean.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.340]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.280]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.979]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.340]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next to...
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.520]  I'm not going to get it.
[00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.699]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.039]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
[00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.590]  We are announcing Ultimate Hydroforce.
[00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.289]  Now, this is not just electrolytes, okay?
[00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:18.550]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:24.009]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:40.009]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:41.449]  and more.
[00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.350]  Potassium, the list goes on and on.
[00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:49.250]  And it's all the highest quality sources of it on top of that.
[00:04:49.250 --> 00:05:13.389]  And then it funds my broadcast, We sought out...
[00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:23.629]  The very best, highest quality, rehydrating product for pre-workout, post-workout, you name it.
[00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:27.910]  And we found a top company with top reviews that would let us private label it.
[00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.529]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.370]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.029]  It's a super food.
[00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.910]  It's a pre-workout.
[00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.889]  It's a post-workout.
[00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.670]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:50.639]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:57.480]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.819]  This baby is next level.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.800]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:16.819]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.339]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:20.800]  So there's a line out the door.
[00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:29.300]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.879]  And why is that?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.579]  Well, it's simple.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.560]  This is called Ultimate Hydroforce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.750]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, pre-workout.
[00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.629]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you'd say.
[00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:50.230]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.589]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at TheAlexYoungStore.com.
[00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.410]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:20.949]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:22.790]  They are a private agency.
[00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:27.290]  Some of the president-elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.069]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.850]  No.
[00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:37.569]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.269]  No.
[00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:58.680]  The Federal Reserve is an independent...agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:08.259]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration on monetary policies and to also dismantle the Federal Reserve.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.839]  But that's where all this predatory garbage comes from.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.779]  It's where the ESGs come from.
[00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:17.399]  It's where the global governance comes from, the corporate social credit scores, all of it.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.759]  And President Trump is striking right now.
[00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:22.949]  At the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:30.310]  Now, in closing here, Infowars is set to be sold at auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:33.169]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.610]  But regardless, backups are being set up.
[00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.990]  New systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:47.309]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.769]  And...
[00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:54.289]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[00:08:54.549 --> 00:09:04.850]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.970]  Here it is on screen.
[00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.149]  Iconic.
[00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:17.669]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:29.440]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election, and that's exactly what happened.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:39.220]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with three simple words at the bottom.
[00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.299]  Back to back to back.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.259]  That's right.
[00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:50.139]  He's the only president to ever run three times, and he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:58.360]  He won in 16, he won in 2020, and he won in 2024, but this time the landslide was so big they could not stop him.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.259]  This is historic.
[00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:10.769]  We've won the battle, now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp, and to do that he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:16.070]  The most reach we've ever had, thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.850]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:27.929]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get started.
[00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.590]  The Trump Patriot apparel.
[00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:30.690]  Get the posters.
[00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.490]  There's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:37.370]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:38.590]  Thanks for your support.
[00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.070]  God bless and good luck.
[00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:44.289]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:45.210]  Thank you so much.
[00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.830]  Show.
[00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:17.230]  We brought in a lot of money at the AlexJonesStore.com to our sponsor.
[00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.470]  And they're great guys.
[00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.210]  They're great marketers.
[00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:19.710]  They're bigly.
[00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:24.230]  They produce the best Trump shirts and are big sponsors for Stephen Crowder and the Hodge Twins and so many others.
[00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:27.549]  I had little talks with them, though, because I see the numbers.
[00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:31.049]  I'm like, you're selling the CMOS for 55% off.
[00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:34.570]  And then you give VIP members another discount?
[00:11:34.809 --> 00:11:35.870]  And I go, let me see the numbers.
[00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.610]  Oh, actually, some of these deals, we lose money, but we're getting new customers.
[00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.149]  They're going to love it.
[00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:40.629]  I'm like...
[00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:47.649]  Okay, let's have a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are 50 bucks so we actually, you know, get 20-something bucks.
[00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:50.129]  You know, after all the cost.
[00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.009]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.
[00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.909]  So, I had an idea two weeks ago.
[00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.210]  We'll do a wide shot so you can see these.
[00:11:56.769 --> 00:12:05.169]  And I said, okay, I want a red on black classic InfoWars that says 1776 worldwide, 2024, my signature.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.580]  Historic.
[00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:07.419]  Looks great in your office.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.059]  Great wherever.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.039]  You know you support us.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.460]  Whatever happens to M4s, it survives.
[00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:11.100]  It's even cooler.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:11.919]  It doesn't survive.
[00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:12.620]  You've got the memento.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.440]  It helps fund the future.
[00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:17.200]  An Alex Jones-style Star Wars fun thing we came up with.
[00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:21.679]  And then the other thing I designed, white on black Infowars lives forever with my signature.
[00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:22.919]  It's right there.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.220]  There are only a few thousand of each one of these.
[00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:26.259]  They're limited edition.
[00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:29.980]  This is literally you knowing you back the second American Revolution.
[00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:31.000]  It's such a critical time.
[00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:34.500]  While we've gone over the top, while we have the initiative, while this is all happening.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.139]  So these things cost like $5 to print because they are high quality and they're on like a poster boards.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.940]  They're thick.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.399]  They're nice.
[00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:42.620]  It's like a particularly good movie poster.
[00:12:44.279 --> 00:13:12.340]  and then the tube and all that's like six seven bucks seven eight eight bucks per unit with 50 bucks and we're getting like you know they get part of their operations but we're getting 20 something bucks for each poster for the operation so if folks just go buy the posters i i if people buy them right now you'll hear me when i come back on sunday and money i won't be up here please please help me help me help me if you go get those we'll have the money and some runway out a few months But the legal everything else.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.259]  So if you want to keep the show on the air, this is the action point.
[00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.480]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:24.039]  And all the supplements are great, and all the t-shirts are great, and just, you know, everything's amazing.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:34.419]  It's just when they're selling a t-shirt for $25, $30, and the t-shirt costs $15, or if it's an XXXL, $17, and then they've got their expenses, and their crew, and the legal, and all this stuff, and then we...
[00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:37.029]  Not a lot of money.
[00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:41.769]  So these are the things you get if you really want to support us.
[00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.690]  And all the Trump gears in, it's amazing.
[00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:44.289]  Trump won.
[00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:46.029]  I think these are the best designs out there.
[00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.990]  I'm proud of these guys.
[00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:48.429]  I love the work they're doing.
[00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:50.970]  And it's all there.
[00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:54.870]  So the AlexJonesStore.com, three limited edition posters.
[00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:57.250]  I designed the red one and the white one.
[00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.129]  I mean, I've literally made those.
[00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:02.090]  And they're simple and they're very strong, very clean.
[00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:04.820]  It's my original design for them four's logo.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.539]  And then the middle one, I said, why don't we have a Star Wars one?
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.080]  Kind of a fun thing, you know, for somebody like if you've got a little arcade in your house with video games or pool table or whatever.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.620]  I used to have a bigger house, but I don't have a room for a pool table now.
[00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:19.960]  But if I did, that'd be hanging in my house.
[00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:20.440]  That's fun.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.320]  And so it's all there.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.559]  To me, it's a no-brainer.
[00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:26.840]  I want to thank you respectfully for everything you've done.
[00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:29.179]  I want to thank God for leading, guiding, directing.
[00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:29.539]  It's been incredible.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.039]  I want to thank the crew for putting up with me because...
[00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:34.639]  They understand, but I've been a jerk lately.
[00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:35.200]  I'll admit it.
[00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:36.000]  I try to repent.
[00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:38.440]  I try to not be so angry, but this is our whole future.
[00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:39.620]  If they get it, they're pissed off too.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.399]  They've been busting their ass, and I'd sure like to not just, whether we survive or have to set up a new operation, it'd be nice to give these guys a bonus and maybe a raise.
[00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:52.919]  They haven't had bonuses or raises in over two years, and they're a badass team, so I salute them.
[00:14:53.039 --> 00:15:00.600]  So for all of us here at the Infowars family, whatever happens, it's all in God's plan, but God works through you, so take action now and be part of the fundraiser.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.860]  Get the posters now.
[00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:12.629]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight, and we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, DallasJonesStore.com.
[00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:26.309]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, and I, because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks own this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, J-sexers, you name it.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.500]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:07.259]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.220]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intermission.
[00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:18.950]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:16:19.049 --> 00:16:22.149]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.809]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.809]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:31.529]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:38.870]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:42.470]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:51.320]  We're taking the AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.460]  Infowars to be shut down in just a few weeks.
[00:16:55.659 --> 00:17:02.159]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJN Live on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.059]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, they've got another thing coming.
[00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:10.420]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJN Live.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.940]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:32.140]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:34.519]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.559]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.529]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:06.509]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA. A few weeks ago when I saw you...
[00:18:06.509 --> 00:18:08.509]  Information War.
[00:18:08.829 --> 00:18:10.470]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:14.009]  I'm a good fucking fan.
[00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.549]  I'm a good fucking fan.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.640]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago when I saw you...
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.339]  Information War.
[00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.099]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:58.119 --> 00:19:04.380]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago when I saw you...
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.119]  Information War.
[00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:08.019]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.059]  Incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, theallishownstore.com.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:32.759]  There's a VIP... I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:37.319]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.119]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.019]  I'm still not in shape.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.880]  How are you...
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.319]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.400]  Don't tell me eating right.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.259]  I'm not gonna buy that shit.
[00:19:46.009 --> 00:19:48.769]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.609]  Oh, no!
[00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.470]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:59.569]  I did it all from the alexjonesstore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:00.509]  That's why, right here.
[00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:06.349]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.150]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.750]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:20.029]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.509]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:26.849]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
[00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:37.220]  We're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.140]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:48.500]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value.
[00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.049]  Thank you.
[00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.809]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is Beyond Epic.
[00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:38.509]  And I just want to say the Intrepid Infowars crew has done an amazing job despite the insane information warfare battleground that they have been in for years that really came to a head spectacularly today.
[00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:42.470]  So it is 11.09 Central Standard Time.
[00:23:43.849 --> 00:23:59.019]  And what happened today is just an incredible story that happened in live time that is a saga of In the second American revolution to restore our republic from the globalists.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.160]  It is absolutely wild and incredible.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:10.599]  And I predicted this is exactly what would happen because I study the globalists.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.779]  I study how they operate.
[00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:13.579]  This is what I do.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.839]  And massive numbers of people are tuned in right now.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:27.039]  To the streams going out on X and the satellites, the radio and TV stations that pick up the broadcast.
[00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:35.940]  We had a little bit of hiccups at the first because a lot of behind the scenes stuff going on to try to keep us off the air.
[00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:51.559]  So this is an incredibly historic time to be alive and And I have seen things unfold today that even amaze me.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:25:06.119]  Absolutely epic, over-the-top, crazy, in the annals of the broadcast history of this transmission.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.099]  Now, I want to show TV viewers this right here.
[00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:10.000]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.200]  This is the live show from InfoWars.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.500]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:25:15.579 --> 00:25:15.880]  There it is.
[00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:19.289]  1.3 million viewers just on that stream.
[00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.130]  And have you ever seen a stream from X that's a black screen?
[00:25:24.369 --> 00:25:25.309]  Before that, it was static.
[00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.990]  So that's not out of the Infowar studios.
[00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:34.450]  That's not out of our studios.
[00:25:36.089 --> 00:25:40.829]  That broadcast started at 8 a.m.
[00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.730]  Central today.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.539]  Harrison Smith's regular show.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.180]  I came in and hosted most of it.
[00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:49.759]  And I'm going to tell you, everything that unfolded, that's the best way to understand what just went down.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.079]  It's insane.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.140]  And here's what happened.
[00:26:06.099 --> 00:26:21.309]  Six years ago, the Democratic Party openly and publicly sued me For things I didn't do, they rigged courts and had judges find me guilty by default and then had jury show trials.
[00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.369]  Everybody knows about that.
[00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:24.130]  It's been insane.
[00:26:27.349 --> 00:26:31.789]  And then when we went into bankruptcy, they said, he's a crook.
[00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.289]  We're going to find hundreds of millions of hidden dollars.
[00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.130]  He's going to go to prison.
[00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:36.230]  Of course, none of that was true.
[00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:44.049]  They made us use our own money to pay for three outside accounting firms to come in and tear everything apart going back over a decade.
[00:26:45.369 --> 00:26:50.289]  They had us audited by the IRS. We got a $4.3 million tax return.
[00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.029]  They said, this is very rare, where we'd overpaid taxes for five years.
[00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:55.309]  That all went into the bankruptcy.
[00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.809]  And then they publicly said, we don't want money.
[00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.009]  We don't want to settle with Mr.
[00:27:00.109 --> 00:27:00.329]  Jones.
[00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.609]  We want him off of the air.
[00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.789]  And that was all over TV, and we played those clubs many times.
[00:27:06.869 --> 00:27:07.329]  We've seen those.
[00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.410]  I'll play them again today.
[00:27:10.009 --> 00:27:24.410]  Then, in late May, the U.S. trustee, assigned by the Justice Department, because they can come into a case like this if they want to, ordered the private security we'd had for seven, eight years without telling us to close the doors and kick us out on a Friday night.
[00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:26.509]  Well, I was up there.
[00:27:26.569 --> 00:27:28.589]  I saw it going on, said, no, where's your court order?
[00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.529]  I'm going to call the police.
[00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:32.109]  They called and said, yeah, we can't do this without a court order.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.460]  Then the judge fired the U.S. trustee and CRO at a hearing a few weeks later.
[00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:49.220]  Then the Democrats filed in federal court again to take the name Alex Jones, saying they own me, which violates the 13th Amendment against slavery, literally.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.160]  They said in the filing, 13th Amendment doesn't apply to Mr.
[00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:53.799]  Jones because all the case law says they can't do that.
[00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:54.779]  They said it doesn't apply to him.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.299]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.380]  Novel law trying to create precedence.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.960]  They then said they own real Alex Jones on X and they wanted that.
[00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:01.680]  The judge said no.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:09.420]  And the judge said, but because Alex Jones is in private bankruptcy, personal bankruptcy, and he owns InfoWars, that can be put up for sale.
[00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:12.559]  So, it's federal law how they did it.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.500]  They had a public auction.
[00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:18.420]  They said people had to go get qualified for it.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.400]  They had to show they had the money for it.
[00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:31.799]  And they said on November 13th, there will be a public online with a big auction place online, one of the biggest, of it, and whoever gets the highest bids wins.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:40.640]  Then, Monday at 3 o'clock, we get calls from the trustee and all the people, my lawyers, and they say, well, now we're changing that.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.799]  It's going to be secret bids.
[00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:51.019]  All the bids had to be in by November 8, according to their rules, but now they changed the rules, and it has to be in by November 13 at 10 a.m.
[00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:53.420]  They will open the bids at 10.30 a.m.
[00:28:53.859 --> 00:28:57.640]  There will be no future bids, unlike an auction where you can keep bidding up.
[00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:58.140]  No, no, no.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:58.839]  That's just final.
[00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:00.480]  So, see what that is.
[00:29:01.599 --> 00:29:08.019]  And then the highest bidder will be announced.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:22.599]  I said to my lawyers, and I said to the crew, and I said on air, if it sounds like it's rigged, I would imagine they'll even end up giving it to the Democrats, which they did, and even they'll pay less, which they just admitted they paid less.
[00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:26.440]  Wow, that sounds like an auction to me.
[00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:35.140]  It was a secret, and then whoever they want to give it to, they give it to, and oh, by the way, the new owners want you shut down now.
[00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:54.730]  And so I'm working out at 7.27 or so in the morning, get a call from my lawyers, and they say, the feds are on the way to your office, and they plan on closing today.
[00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.069]  I'm about a mile and a half away.
[00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.670]  I drive in, Harrison's show's about to start.
[00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.809]  I go in, tell everybody what's going on, talk about it.
[00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.430]  Steve Bannon comes on and others.
[00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.490]  Owen comes in, we talk about it.
[00:30:07.829 --> 00:30:13.849]  Then I hear, I get a text message from my folks saying, hey, the feds have left.
[00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:23.930]  So I go off air, I go, I call them and talk to my folks, Chris Murray, talk to him and my folks.
[00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:27.730]  And first time I've talked to him in weeks.
[00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.829]  And He says, oh, listen, I'm friends.
[00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:32.569]  Everything's great.
[00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.269]  You know, we're just...
[00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:42.130]  It's our position that this is now owned by somebody else, and we don't want you to use the equipment here, and we want you to basically go off air.
[00:30:42.829 --> 00:30:44.190]  And I said, well...
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:31:02.480]  It's my position that you didn't do this auction right and that the people that have put in bids and qualified and done down payments will have rights to challenge that in court and have already filed, as of then, an emergency injunction in the federal court in Houston and Chris Lopez's court.
[00:31:03.079 --> 00:31:04.099]  He says, yeah, we know that.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.440]  We're on our way back to Houston to do it right now.
[00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:07.259]  And I said...
[00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:14.329]  I said, you know, I already have a backup system set up with folks and things like that.
[00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:16.390]  I said, it's my position, you're wrong.
[00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:28.230]  But until we get into court, I mean, I think you've really made a big mistake here.
[00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:34.829]  And of course, later on the phone with the lawyers, I was like, oh yeah, it's really, I'm not going to tell people what exactly went on.
[00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:38.509]  But these people just think they can do whatever they want.
[00:31:39.579 --> 00:31:42.099]  And they think it's open season on Alex Jones and the American people.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.859]  Well, they saw the referendum on that with President Trump's landslide.
[00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:55.460]  So they already cut off the website, were cutting off the power, cutting off the...
[00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:02.390]  And so I said, well, I'm going to go over and sign off and explain what's happening.
[00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:09.150]  I think this is wrong, but since you turn everything off and you have control of the infrastructure, I'm not quitting.
[00:32:09.329 --> 00:32:12.369]  I'm just going to get back on air with the Alex Jones Network.
[00:32:12.849 --> 00:32:15.630]  I said, but to be clear, you don't have a problem with me signing off.
[00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.329]  He said no and had witnesses and obviously...
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.019]  Everybody's recording it.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.220]  And he said, yeah, that's fine, because they're going to misrepresent.
[00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:24.059]  You know, I'm this hijacker of my own company and stuff.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.400]  And, you know, oh, how dare you not, like, in May, trying to shut it down with no court order, which the judge admitted was wrong.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.619]  And the judge wouldn't give my name, and real Alex Jones said he couldn't do that, and that was wrong weeks ago.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.740]  And all this is all over the news.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.779]  This is not my opinion.
[00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:38.619]  Anybody can look this up.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.819]  But I said, since you're doing this, okay.
[00:32:41.099 --> 00:32:45.140]  So I go over, sign off, and explain to people I'm going to be over here.
[00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:47.940]  And then I leave.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:58.359]  And I get over here 10 minutes later to the backup studios, the Alex Jones Network studios, bigger ones are being built right now, almost done.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:06.839]  And I walk up here and I look at the feeds and they're static.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.859]  Now, that's on my X account.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.839]  Not theirs, not Infowars.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.880]  So I call the crew and they go, we don't know.
[00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:22.859]  The power is turned off in the control room.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:31.559]  So I guess somebody, and we've got to go get the surveillance cameras, because my crew's here, just went in and turned stuff off.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.339]  So that's the level of this.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.819]  And that's what's happening.
[00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:44.200]  So we relaunched streams on Real Alex Jones and AJN Live.
[00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:47.849]  And those streams are there.
[00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:51.789]  And of course, tens of millions are now starting to dial in.
[00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.650]  And by this evening, I would imagine the streams will have 10 million people on them and the clips will everywhere.
[00:33:55.809 --> 00:34:04.109]  But whoever did that, because when you kill an encoder, streams, it just stops at X and then starts from the start and loops it or archives it.
[00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:07.230]  That's all gone.
[00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:17.150]  But of course, there's Rumble backups and other things, so we'll be sure and put that out and say, here's the final Infowars broadcast that just magically got taken down.
[00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.309]  So, this is wild.
[00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:22.889]  So, I'm going to say this again.
[00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.050]  Several good guy groups...
[00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:43.429]  Said they wanted to buy InfoWars and keep me on the air and keep that equipment and let us keep fighting for Trump and America and the Great Awakening and make sure he gets actually into office on the 20th of January and make sure the good agenda of liberty continues on and all the rest of it.
[00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:48.929]  And so we follow the rules to a T. I never knew what the other groups were going to bid.
[00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.650]  You're not supposed to know that.
[00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:51.570]  They wouldn't tell me anything.
[00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:55.030]  So I don't know what that group, Roger Stone, did.
[00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.230]  I don't even know if they put a bid in.
[00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:58.590]  I think they did because they said there were quite a few bids.
[00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:02.960]  I was working with another group I'd known forever that had been a great sponsor over the years.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.639]  They didn't tell me the bids because the owner's a lawyer.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.000]  And bankruptcy lawyer at that, one of the owners.
[00:35:12.659 --> 00:35:20.639]  And so followed absolutely like a Boy Scout to the T. And I called them yesterday.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.239]  And I said, the fix is in.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.579]  No matter how much money you put in, you're never going to get it.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:32.780]  And I said, you notice CNN... Already is reporting about the bids and knows what the bids are, but we don't even know.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.760]  You've not even told me.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.380]  And so there's a fox in the henhouse.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.159]  They said, yeah, this looks bad.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:48.840]  And then Chris Murray called and wanted to talk to the financial guy with my lawyers that's been in there helping with everything in the last year.
[00:35:49.219 --> 00:35:50.579]  I wanted to meet with him at 7 a.m.
[00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:51.440]  this morning in Austin.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.699]  And I said, no matter, there could be a trillion dollars.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.579]  We're not getting it.
[00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:58.190]  But I said, that'll be a big issue.
[00:35:58.269 --> 00:35:59.250]  And they said, oh, don't be paranoid.
[00:35:59.429 --> 00:36:00.289]  I said, no, that's going to happen.
[00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:11.969]  And I said, two days before, 48 hours before, they say, oh, all those filings and documents and non-disclosures everybody signed, and you put money down to these people and put deposits in and all this stuff.
[00:36:12.489 --> 00:36:13.929]  Now you're told none of that counts.
[00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.269]  You now have to put new bids in.
[00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:16.170]  This is Monday evening.
[00:36:16.289 --> 00:36:17.510]  And you have until 10 a.m.
[00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:28.230]  Central on Wednesday, that's yesterday, November 13th, to Put in your one bid, and then whoever's is above it gets it.
[00:36:28.469 --> 00:36:33.489]  But the U.S. trustee, Chris Murray, reserves the right to give it to a lesser bidder.
[00:36:33.789 --> 00:36:36.769]  So I said, that right there means they're going to do that.
[00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:38.329]  I mean, that's just so obvious.
[00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.630]  Like, well, we'll see.
[00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.170]  I sat there like 40 minutes ago on the phone with Chris Murray.
[00:36:45.389 --> 00:36:45.869]  Yeah.
[00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.929]  And he admitted it all.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.320]  In front of witnesses.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.500]  And that, well, it's his authority and that's just the way it is.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.119]  So, I mean, they literally think I'm Satan.
[00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:06.219]  I don't know if he does, but the process is...
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:16.440]  Guys, you can pull up the Bloomberg article for the exact headline, but just type in Chris Murray, Bloomberg, Alex Jones, and it was from like three weeks ago.
[00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:17.659]  I made a big deal about it.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.920]  You can find it on X. My report's on it on X. Just type in, Alex Jones has no 13th Amendment.
[00:37:25.659 --> 00:37:27.639]  And it's in the filing.
[00:37:27.719 --> 00:37:32.639]  I showed it a bunch on air, and it says, Alex Jones does not have 13th Amendment rights.
[00:37:32.699 --> 00:37:33.820]  He's a different case.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.360]  No proof, no precedent, just Alex Jones does not have a 13th Amendment.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.219]  They actually said that.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.239]  Well, the judge said you can't have his name.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.239]  You can't have real Alex Jones.
[00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:46.900]  And so they wanted that.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.380]  They wanted that off the air right now.
[00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:51.139]  They didn't get that so far.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.599]  And he'd always promised he wasn't going to do that when they were asking for it months before that.
[00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:56.800]  But then he did do that.
[00:37:57.639 --> 00:37:59.539]  Then when the judge said no, he took that out of the sale.
[00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:01.880]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:05.679]  Alex Jones' social media accounts are not the ordinary accounts of a private citizen.
[00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:14.260]  The sale of Jones' bankruptcy of state interest in the social media accounts does not require Jones to perform any personal services that would otherwise violate the 30th Amendment.
[00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:17.940]  So, of course, none of that's true.
[00:38:18.519 --> 00:38:19.420]  And that guy's a lawyer.
[00:38:19.519 --> 00:38:19.960]  He knows that.
[00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:21.440]  He'd said before, obviously, no.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.159]  So, that is where we are.
[00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:29.179]  And we're going to have to battle all this in court.
[00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:30.780]  This is a fight.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.880]  This is not a regular show where, oh, Alex, just do your show or whatever.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.659]  No, we have reporters.
[00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.280]  We have crew.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.119]  We have researchers.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.940]  We have the legal to battle as we're constantly attacked.
[00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.780]  Their mission is take me off the air.
[00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:54.500]  So they can then build a straw man that I'm not and use a folk hero anti-globalist person as a demon to attack liberty in the future.
[00:38:54.619 --> 00:38:56.079]  And they've admitted in the news they want my identity.
[00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:57.340]  They admit they want our archives.
[00:38:57.519 --> 00:38:59.539]  They admit they say they own everything I ever said or did.
[00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:01.099]  So it's not enough.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.980]  They don't just exile people or silence you.
[00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:09.599]  They then steal your identity and then wear your skin and then masquerade as you.
[00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:11.480]  Okay, so...
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.340]  That's what's going on.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.840]  And obviously, the onion is just a front group.
[00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:26.639]  I said that this morning that it came out, the Democrats, the quote, Sandy Hook parents are involved in it.
[00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.500]  And there you go.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:36.139]  And despite this, they're still going to chase me the rest of my life with their fake judgments, which we're going to get overturned on appeal.
[00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:39.300]  And say, he won't give us money.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.079]  He won't give us money.
[00:39:40.179 --> 00:39:42.780]  As if you don't remember, they said they don't want money and want me off the air.
[00:39:43.039 --> 00:39:47.820]  So they want to blow the thing up that would have made them money and then still say, I won't give them money.
[00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:52.880]  So this is all Democratic Party run by Senator Blumenthal.
[00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:53.360]  It's come out.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.659]  The FBI created the lawsuits.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.739]  They testified that in court.
[00:39:57.559 --> 00:40:00.539]  Just to hide it in plain view, the CIA got caught being involved.
[00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:02.219]  You know about all that.
[00:40:02.619 --> 00:40:05.800]  And this is the tyranny as a society.
[00:40:06.929 --> 00:40:22.070]  As a culture that we are dealing with, and again, someone went in after I left,
[00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:28.190]  and I'm going to find out, and turned the power off in the control rooms.
[00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:34.050]  And we were already jumping at 11 a.m.
[00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:39.170]  onto our feeds To continue on.
[00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:45.769]  But the way this was done, it just destroyed all of that, though we have backups of it.
[00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:57.570]  And so there they are, reaching in, whoever did it, into X, into our show, into what we're doing that is a major public interest.
[00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.570]  And this is a conspiracy against my rights.
[00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.489]  And we've already filed civil rights actions.
[00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.829]  We've already filed counter suits almost a month ago.
[00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.769]  It's not been in the news because they don't want to talk about it.
[00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:09.510]  My lawyers are like, just wait and see what they do.
[00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:13.050]  These people did some really bad stuff to me and my crew and my family.
[00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:21.909]  They all got together, rigged court cases, had the media, PR firms, the Justice Department, just like the lawfare with Trump was all coordinated from the White House.
[00:41:23.789 --> 00:41:26.869]  And before that, by Obama and the Democratic Party, that's all come out.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.380]  And Trump's getting ready to go after him for conspiracy against his civil rights.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.340]  It's a felony.
[00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:42.440]  So all these federal prosecutors and people both on the lawfare side, coordinating with the Justice Department people, have just done some very un-American things.
[00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:56.000]  And they are so desperate to have some win that they've raided the projection betting site, Polymarket, yesterday.
[00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.630]  They're going after all these other Trump supporters.
[00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:00.130]  Deep State's not letting up.
[00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:01.570]  They're just used to being bullies.
[00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.530]  They're used to being in control.
[00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.550]  I mean, I expect anything by these people at this point.
[00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:06.650]  We're going to be peaceful.
[00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.849]  We're going to win in the information war.
[00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.010]  But we will continue on with the Alex Jones Network.
[00:42:13.329 --> 00:42:14.130]  I don't own it.
[00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.389]  And under the law, they can't see stuff and take stuff down that I don't own.
[00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.570]  I've got all sorts of offers, you know, with major groups to go to Florida and other places.
[00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:25.769]  My family's here.
[00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:26.590]  I love the crew.
[00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:28.809]  Um...
[00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:45.179]  And so at this point, wherever the Alex Jones Network goes, whatever it turns into, I intend to add with the folks we're working with, but I'll be the program director, more hosts, more reporters, more crew, and we will be bigger and more effective than ever.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.739]  Because quite frankly, you know, until they did all this to me, I was not even trying to get bigger.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.960]  I knew we were waking everybody up and other people would do the job.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.739]  And I just saw myself as kind of John the Baptist out in the wilderness that would trigger the big revolution, which we did.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.039]  You triggered it with me.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.320]  We're gonna go to break in a moment.
[00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:01.960]  And we're going to come back and go over all of this.
[00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.260]  But this has been wild.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.019]  This has been absolutely insane.
[00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:09.840]  But I couldn't have done it without the listeners and supporters.
[00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:12.159]  Couldn't have done it without the great crew who's been through hell.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.019]  So pray for us all.
[00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:14.880]  But this is historic.
[00:43:15.539 --> 00:43:18.519]  And we literally, in my view, just got hijacked this morning.
[00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:19.699]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.260]  Stay with us.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.480]  But hey, they played their hand.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.980]  I mean, we went down like the Viking warrior with a sword in hand and the infoward.
[00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:40.750]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.230]  And we've come out with it.
[00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:47.550]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, make America great again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.210]  But I personally like this one.
[00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:54.469]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the info war and supports President Trump.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.539]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.

[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.300]  They can try to steal his identity.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.659]  They can try to steal his business.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.219]  They can try to steal America.
[00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:07.519]  They can try to sacrifice humanity in nuclear genocide.

[00:48:22.289 --> 00:48:36.769]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.269]  That's what matters.
[00:48:40.369 --> 00:48:50.550]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.170]  That is punishment.
[00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:55.469]  That is deterrence.
[00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.329]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[00:49:12.869 --> 00:49:14.829]  And there's going to be a day when that child doesn't come home from school.
[00:49:14.989 --> 00:49:16.809]  And we know it, and it's sad, and that's the reality.
[00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.909]  And the question's going to be, where is Alice Jones when that happens?
[00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:23.250]  Is he in his studio?
[00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:25.650]  Getting ready to pounce?
[00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.510]  Or will you stop him?
[00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:35.550]  That's going to be in your hands.
[00:49:36.969 --> 00:49:43.730]  And if we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back Because that's what justice is in this case.
[00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:50.750]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:49:51.929 --> 00:49:55.349]  I hope that with your verdict, he can go away.
[00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:07.190]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[00:50:07.989 --> 00:50:09.489]  I believe it.
[00:50:11.539 --> 00:50:16.199]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.059]  Yeah, there's going to be a resolution made under what these claims are valued at.
[00:50:20.219 --> 00:50:26.159]  And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.500]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards...
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:36.239]  Is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.059]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:43.860]  Jones, because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:55.559]  And if, you know, some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand, I can only imagine what federal receiver's going to do.
[00:50:56.299 --> 00:50:58.440]  So yeah, it's gonna get interesting from here on out.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.420]  It's gonna get really interesting, that's for sure.
[00:51:02.019 --> 00:51:07.320]  It's already super interesting, but like we say, it's the end of the beginning.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.599]  And boy, are these clients happy about it.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.900]  There was certainly a message sent out of this courthouse today, that's for sure.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:52.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:51:53.179 --> 00:52:00.139]  I am your embattled host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the Alex Jones Network.
[00:52:04.019 --> 00:52:05.840]  Love you all, my friends.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.480]  We have forced the globalists out in the open.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.179]  The world is waking up.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:16.159]  The Streisand Effect is turned on 11.
[00:52:16.599 --> 00:52:21.980]  And the greatest days of American Renaissance are now upon us.
[00:52:22.179 --> 00:52:22.980]  Yes!
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:22.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the top stories in the world right now is the forced sneak attack, shutdown of the fabled InfoWars studios in South Austin.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.000]  Right down the road from Joe Rogan Studios, Elon Musk, you name it.
[00:53:26.519 --> 00:53:30.099]  16 years in that building, 27 years of Infowars as a website.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.340]  When I went and registered, nobody thought to get it.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.039]  Obviously, we're in an Infowar.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:39.980]  30 and a half years on air, and we are reaching more people than ever.
[00:53:40.199 --> 00:53:51.590]  And with almost no hiccup, We stayed on air despite all their actions on the satellites, to the radio and TV stations, uplinks here, all of it.
[00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:55.150]  And we're having hundreds of stations.
[00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.829]  Extra calling right now, wanting the show.
[00:54:02.849 --> 00:54:05.090]  Think about the globalists trying to kill Trump twice.
[00:54:05.289 --> 00:54:06.190]  Think about all the lawfare.
[00:54:06.329 --> 00:54:07.510]  Think about the fake impeachments.
[00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.150]  Think about the Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:54:09.409 --> 00:54:11.309]  Think about all the stuff they did to him and his family.
[00:54:11.469 --> 00:54:19.489]  Did that make the American people, I mean, they thought, I remember on the news, corporate media, dinosaur media, oh boy, once there's a mugshot of him, Trump's over.
[00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:20.849]  Let's pull up the mugshot of Trump.
[00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:26.369]  The justice they've long awaited and fought for.
[00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.130]  They barely even never talked about Sandy Hook.
[00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:31.710]  They did none of the things they said I did.
[00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:48.949]  They attached themselves to me after Trump won, raised money off me saying I was doing stuff to them I never did, ran fundraisers, and then they had judges find me guilty in rigged courts and have show trials where they told the juries I was already guilty.
[00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:54.730]  No evidence can be put on, just all their BS. Turned out the FBI, Justice Department, the CIA ran the whole thing.
[00:54:54.809 --> 00:54:55.630]  That's mainstream news.
[00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:59.150]  Then they tried in late May to shut us down without a court order.
[00:54:59.269 --> 00:55:00.949]  I didn't take that bluff.
[00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:07.130]  And now without a court order this morning, they had their stuff in place and just turned off the internet.
[00:55:10.429 --> 00:55:12.969]  And I knew they were going to do that, so I said, what you're doing is wrong.
[00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.010]  I'm going to see you in court.
[00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.170]  You made a big mistake.
[00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:18.809]  I'll go sign off because they were just coming in.
[00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:22.289]  Everything was being pew, pew, pew, info wars, band-up video, everything.
[00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:30.639]  And then I left And they go in there and just flip the studios off.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.699]  So that's desperate.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:43.679]  And then you've got the whole other giant issue of how all this was done.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.579]  I mean, no court order trying to shut us down in late May.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.659]  That was so insane, people didn't believe us until they admitted it weeks later in court.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.880]  Yeah, Your Honor, we ordered it to shut down.
[00:55:56.039 --> 00:55:56.519]  Did you have the authority?
[00:55:56.639 --> 00:55:56.820]  No.
[00:55:58.119 --> 00:55:58.760]  Well, why'd you do it?
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.519]  Well, it was a security threat.
[00:55:59.579 --> 00:55:59.940]  Well, what was that?
[00:56:00.019 --> 00:56:01.179]  Well, somebody said there was a gun.
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:02.920]  Really, did somebody do something wrong with the gun?
[00:56:03.219 --> 00:56:04.420]  Well, we can't talk about it.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.480]  It's made up.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.039]  Well, you're fired, the judge said.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.519]  So, then they bring in a new trustee.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.900]  The left comes in and says, we want his name and everything now.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.119]  The judge goes, no, Mr.
[00:56:17.219 --> 00:56:18.639]  Jones still owns InfoWars.
[00:56:19.019 --> 00:56:19.960]  He's in private bankruptcy.
[00:56:20.119 --> 00:56:22.760]  It can be liquidated at auction.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.340]  And I told everybody, I said, we'll never get this at auction.
[00:56:25.579 --> 00:56:30.139]  You can, you know, it just buys us time, you know, to go work with other people, set up other stuff.
[00:56:30.579 --> 00:56:33.320]  And then I had the crew here Tuesday afternoon at the backup studios.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:34.599]  The auctions don't work.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:35.900]  They're building a bigger one right now.
[00:56:36.719 --> 00:56:40.380]  And I said, it'll be a fake auction.
[00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:43.840]  And no matter what happens, the bad guys will get it.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.139]  And then it'll take them overnight.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.079]  They'll hit in the morning.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.000]  So I said, I need everybody here at 8 a.m.
[00:56:49.019 --> 00:56:55.360]  We won't be able to do Harrison's show because, you know, it'll be like fish out of water trying to get ready for this.
[00:56:56.539 --> 00:57:01.119]  And I said, in case they don't get around to it quite yet, he'll still be on air before they come turn the power off, probably.
[00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:04.500]  And I said, so just be ready to go at 10 a.m.
[00:57:06.639 --> 00:57:07.420]  And I love the crew.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.840]  They work their ass off through the job at, you know, twice as many people.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.550]  But I learned all this at like 727 today.
[00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.869]  I'm down the road a mile away.
[00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:21.230]  I come in, the morning crew's there, and I go, hey, I've got word they're coming right now to tell me to shut it off.
[00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:23.090]  They haven't told me yet, but that's what I've been told.
[00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.150]  I'm going to go on the air here.
[00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:27.130]  And I said, can you get everybody in?
[00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:31.269]  Because I totally nailed it again.
[00:57:31.469 --> 00:57:32.869]  I just don't know how I do it.
[00:57:33.369 --> 00:57:34.090]  Well, actually, I do.
[00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.010]  I study evil criminology.
[00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:41.079]  And I already knew the law as gestalt.
[00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:50.719]  And so then I called a whole bunch of people that are involved in lawyers and they said, we've never seen anything like this and the way it was done is crazy.
[00:57:52.369 --> 00:57:55.449]  Oh, it's a public auction, and you've got to go get certified.
[00:57:55.590 --> 00:58:00.090]  You've got to show who you are, and you've got to put a down payment on, and you've got to have it in by November 8th.
[00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:02.090]  You've got to be pre-qualified way before that.
[00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:05.090]  And these other Patriot groups, they went and did all that.
[00:58:05.409 --> 00:58:08.269]  And then I said, something's going to happen over the weekend.
[00:58:08.269 --> 00:58:09.449]  I said, prepare to shut down.
[00:58:10.489 --> 00:58:12.230]  They'll just cut the power.
[00:58:13.369 --> 00:58:14.130]  And then...
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.920]  Three o'clock, get off the air.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.119]  They got a call at like two o'clock, my lawyers.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.179]  And they said, yeah, it's totally been changed.
[00:58:23.639 --> 00:58:28.099]  Everything we were told, all the contracts, everything out the window.
[00:58:28.699 --> 00:58:38.619]  You have folks that have already bidded now have till Wednesday morning, November 13th, at 10 a.m.
[00:58:38.639 --> 00:58:39.719]  to put in their new bid.
[00:58:40.059 --> 00:58:46.480]  It's one bid, one filing, and then whoever has the biggest gets it.
[00:58:47.719 --> 00:59:01.099]  But there was a proviso in the new rules, like you're in the third quarter of a football game, last three minutes you're ahead, and they say, hey, we're just going to, you know, give the other side 20 minutes on the field with no other opposition just to run touchdowns.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:10.500]  And the key was that little proviso there, oh, and we don't have to take the biggest bid.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.099]  And I said, isn't that interesting?
[00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:25.329]  And so they've already, I guess, got their scalper mounting our head on the wall.
[00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.550]  And then now they're just going to make jokes over there.
[00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:32.590]  And they're making a joke because it's the onion.
[00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:33.429]  Oh, it's funny.
[00:59:33.429 --> 00:59:34.130]  It's friendly.
[00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:35.730]  Oh, yeah.
[00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:38.449]  You know, oh, and the Sandy Hook people, the Democrat Party.
[00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.369]  Oh, it's just funny now.
[00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:41.570]  So just move on from that.
[00:59:42.989 --> 00:59:45.389]  And they think like the mugshot of Trump.
[00:59:47.199 --> 00:59:50.059]  And all the lies about Trump and all the fake embarrassments of Trump.
[00:59:50.199 --> 00:59:50.699]  Take it down.
[00:59:51.539 --> 00:59:56.340]  They think that that's going to be a victory for them.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.320]  They think that's going to make you cry on your pillow.
[00:59:58.699 --> 01:00:00.739]  They think that's going to be a big joke.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.480]  Trying to parade around with what they think is the head of Infowars.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.679]  That's a website.
[01:00:07.039 --> 01:00:07.840]  That's equipment.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.039]  That's studios.
[01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:17.849]  And since everything I've been told by the new U.S. trustee and everyone I've been told by the last one was never the case, They're like, oh, you've got weeks.
[01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.289]  Work with us to get your stuff out.
[01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.190]  All this other stuff.
[01:00:22.929 --> 01:00:25.210]  We'll probably go back over there later and I'll be locked out.
[01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.849]  So...
[01:00:27.849 --> 01:00:29.269]  And then I'm going to call the police.
[01:00:30.989 --> 01:00:33.809]  Because I've got recordings, all of it, in front of witnesses saying all this.
[01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.349]  I'm not putting up with this anymore.
[01:00:38.389 --> 01:00:38.710]  So...
[01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:43.989]  That's how this works, and that's how the establishment sees the American people.
[01:00:44.449 --> 01:00:56.650]  And people that work for the system, most of them think this system can do no wrong, it can do whatever it wants, Kamala Harris can smuggle in 325,000 kids they admit and purposely disappear them, many of them in slave labor and sex slavery, Senate report.
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:04.750]  They just think they can start World War III, they can devalue the dollar, the big tech can censor you, the government can spy on you without warrants.
[01:01:05.889 --> 01:01:06.750]  They can human traffic.
[01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:12.230]  They just think that they can do whatever they want, that it's open season, that they got a blank check.
[01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:17.250]  And that's all coming to an end with Trump, no matter what they pull or what they do, whether they kill him or not.
[01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:18.630]  People are awake.
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.230]  They're getting more awake every moment, not just here.
[01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.150]  There's a global realignment.
[01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:22.750]  All the big think tanks know it.
[01:01:23.489 --> 01:01:40.769]  And this grabbing of Infowars is so emblematic And just blazons in fire, not in highlighter, how ridiculous all this is.
[01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.630]  And it's just epic beyond belief.
[01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:56.969]  I mean, if I was going to try to discredit myself the very worst way I could, if I was trying to explode the Alex Jones Network as much as I could, I would do exactly what they just did.
[01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:59.150]  And like I told them, back then I'm on record, I said...
[01:02:00.159 --> 01:02:02.159]  They're like, oh my God, the mugshot will destroy Trump.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.099]  It'll all be over for him.
[01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:04.780]  And I'm just like going, are you kidding me?
[01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:10.739]  He was already the underdog, already the Robin Hood, already the Maverick, already the Jesse James.
[01:02:12.039 --> 01:02:15.320]  And everybody was starting to see through it, even more waking up every day.
[01:02:15.539 --> 01:02:30.050]  And then to put his mugshot up that they thought that that Would be the destruction of Donald Trump is the stupidest thing they could have ever done, but they can't help it.
[01:02:30.769 --> 01:02:36.110]  Because they got BlackRock and the private Federal Reserve and the old corporate media, and they still think that's dominant.
[01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.550]  They still think that's in control.
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:45.610]  They still think that they can, like a woman loading the kids in the car to leave the husband forever, you know, beats her.
[01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.070]  She ain't coming back.
[01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:55.929]  And, you know, he thinks beating her up in the parking lot in front of the neighbors is going to bring her back.
[01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:57.090]  No, dude, the cops are coming.
[01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.750]  You're going to jail.
[01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:09.550]  And so this is, I mean, if they'd have come in, done this, waited until the money came in, put it in front of the judge, it would have, you know, had some kernel, maybe, of legitimacy.
[01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:13.110]  But saying, oh, here's the bid.
[01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:13.869]  It's all about board.
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:16.130]  Bait and switch 48 hours before it.
[01:03:17.949 --> 01:03:20.170]  Little fine print, by the way, we can give this to whoever we want.
[01:03:21.469 --> 01:03:24.989]  It's the facade that I had trials for defamation.
[01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:28.530]  It's the facade that there was an auction.
[01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.389]  There's the facade.
[01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:38.750]  It's like calling this hourglass a Falcon 9 heavy rocket.
[01:03:38.869 --> 01:03:39.170]  It's not.
[01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.150]  It's an hourglass.
[01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:44.329]  And the tables are turned on the globalists.
[01:03:45.699 --> 01:03:47.639]  And time is running out.
[01:03:48.519 --> 01:03:57.079]  And I knew time was running out when I first got on air 30 years ago because I could study history and megalomaniacs always think they're invincible once they get in power and grab too much.
[01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:57.900]  And I believed in you.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:05.699]  And so now, now ladies and gentlemen, time is running out for these guys.
[01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:12.800]  And yeah, they can throw fits and overturn the chessboard and They can come after me more and all that.
[01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:15.880]  All you notice just pisses me off more, makes me fight harder.
[01:04:16.239 --> 01:04:17.940]  Mess with my family only makes them fight harder.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:44.440]  But now is the time because I'm going to go politically, economically, legally, through the courts on an absolute crusade and I'm going after all these groups for violation of citizens' rights,
[01:04:44.719 --> 01:04:46.360]  conspiracy against rights.
[01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:49.900]  I'm going after everybody.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:05:07.139]  If the listeners understand this is your fight, if the listeners understand that if you support me, and if you go to thealexjonesstore.com, and if you go to drjonesnaturels.com and get great supplements and t-shirts and the limited edition fundraiser posters,
[01:05:08.869 --> 01:05:14.269]  That have a markup on them that's big so we get funds so you know you donated at the key point.
[01:05:15.869 --> 01:05:22.769]  Just like when you're a communist or globalist and hate America so you give money to the NPR, you get a $5 coffee cup for $50.
[01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:25.449]  It's the same thing you get a badass limited edition poster.
[01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:32.090]  There's one of Trump back-to-back-to-back victories with a great graph of how Harris tried to steal it but failed.
[01:05:33.489 --> 01:05:35.989]  And there's the Alex Jones-esque...
[01:05:38.619 --> 01:05:44.139]  Star Wars poster style, and there's the classic InfoWars posters that belong to the public.
[01:05:44.639 --> 01:05:48.500]  Everything I read was free to air, always an open license with contracts on the website.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:58.980]  Just like if I was the publisher of Linux, the creator of it, and I give Linux away to the world, and 30 years later, he declares bankruptcy for something else, people can't come say we now own Linux because it was given free to the world.
[01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:01.619]  They're totally screwed, nothing to stand on.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.840]  The name InfoWars doesn't even matter to me because it belongs to the public.
[01:06:06.639 --> 01:06:07.719]  It's a name, like Titanic.
[01:06:07.719 --> 01:06:17.400]  You can't take the name Titanic or you can't trademark or copyright a name like Jesus or George Washington or Tree or Rock, though they're trying.
[01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:24.960]  So it'll only make everything I've ever done more powerful, everything we've ever covered stronger, and we're going to go after them in court.
[01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:27.519]  We're going to expose it all on every front.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:40.119]  If you understand this is the heart of the fight for free speech in the future of our country, If you go right now to the alexjonesstore.com and show the world that you support what we're doing and you want to see this continue on.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.119]  Why did Trump win?
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.360]  Because people gave him in small donations billions of dollars.
[01:06:44.579 --> 01:06:49.599]  The enemy outspent him at least two to one, not counting all the corporate media and all the other hidden stuff.
[01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:53.260]  But they had the lawyers and the people to mitigate a lot of the fraud.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:07:01.500]  And to back them into a corner so they couldn't steal as big as they did in 2020, and he won in a landslide overriding the fraud they found and caught in.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:08.980]  That's because you got up, you took action, you donated to Trump, you spread the word, you weren't ashamed to wear the shirts, you weren't ashamed to promote him.
[01:07:10.219 --> 01:07:11.159]  That's how you did it.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.579]  They didn't bully you anymore.
[01:07:12.579 --> 01:07:16.099]  You broke the trance, you broke the control, not just in yourself, but in other people.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:25.840]  And so that's what you do now because the enemy sees Infowars as the genesis point of so much of what's happened because it is.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.519]  And now they think demonizing me, shutting me down, trying to shut me down to something.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.099]  They got Elon Musk to deal with.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.619]  They got Tucker Carlson.
[01:07:33.739 --> 01:07:34.860]  Joe Rogan's totally awake.
[01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:35.739]  Told you that years ago.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.280]  Now you see it.
[01:07:37.039 --> 01:07:38.159]  Because people want freedom.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.880]  They really know there's an evil global corporate black rock system that we're going to remove peacefully.
[01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.800]  And we're aware of their dirty tricks and their false flags and their plans.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.400]  And it's not a...
[01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.789]  Easy road we're going down, but it's a lot better than being slaves.
[01:07:52.750 --> 01:08:07.510]  So they're having their ridiculous celebration to try to lampoon and make everything a joke and then try to use my name to flood everywhere with fake news and to say, oh, InfoWars, it's that joke.
[01:08:08.469 --> 01:08:10.829]  Oh, I thought it was the guy that killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.420]  People think of that in my name.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.139]  It doesn't work anymore.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.900]  Didn't do anything they said I did.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.000]  Had show trials.
[01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.579]  So now it's, oh, InfoWars is a joke.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.500]  And I think they'll just muddy everything with that.
[01:08:22.659 --> 01:08:23.680]  It's not InfoWars.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.380]  It's the whole world.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.039]  It's Elon Musk.
[01:08:25.039 --> 01:08:25.479]  It's you.
[01:08:25.659 --> 01:08:26.220]  It's me.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:31.560]  And the fact that everything I ever said and did has basically come true.
[01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:37.220]  And the old shows are not evergreen, meaning they keep their value.
[01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:38.220]  They're ultra green.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.039]  They're infinity green.
[01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.149]  They're victory green.
[01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:49.670]  And it just gets more powerful because it all comes through.
[01:08:50.770 --> 01:09:00.529]  And so in their attempts to silence us and to stop our free speech and their conspiracy against our rights, they have really stepped into it.
[01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.310]  Absolutely stepped into it.
[01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:13.689]  And I've just got to listen to myself, because I listen to other people some, and I'm just always more right to pretty much anybody else when it comes to this stuff.
[01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:16.369]  Because we've got great backers and groups, and people want to do something.
[01:09:16.409 --> 01:09:17.350]  They're like, oh, come on.
[01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:20.810]  They're not going to cheat on the auction.
[01:09:20.989 --> 01:09:23.770]  If they do above us, we get to overbid, and bid above it, we're going to win.
[01:09:24.329 --> 01:09:25.250]  And I was like, it's not going to happen.
[01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.489]  I'm like, we just need to get everything big set up now.
[01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:31.069]  Well, I'll just use that backup for now.
[01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:32.470]  We'll do it if it doesn't work, which is fine.
[01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:34.069]  The other bigger studio is almost done.
[01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:36.319]  They shut this down.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.199]  There's a whole other thing.
[01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:38.380]  It just makes it bigger.
[01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:42.779]  But now's the time I've got to be physically really careful because they're in full panic mode.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:50.000]  They do not want me on air when they try to kill Trump again, when they try to start a war again, when they're trying to get globalists in his administration.
[01:09:50.079 --> 01:09:50.939]  They don't want us.
[01:09:51.039 --> 01:09:51.699]  They're spotlighting it.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.479]  But I will say this.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:10:00.260]  Ten years ago, 95% of the big stories against the globalists were broke by us, and we were like the fountainhead of most of the resistance.
[01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:02.750]  It's like half now.
[01:10:03.029 --> 01:10:05.609]  And within a month, I'll be 40%.
[01:10:05.609 --> 01:10:11.390]  So I've always, and 30%, I've always said that my job is to become obsolete.
[01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:12.430]  And we're not yet.
[01:10:13.529 --> 01:10:15.350]  And we're here to, you know, promote freedom.
[01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.470]  And we got the make America healthy again thing.
[01:10:17.609 --> 01:10:18.770]  And the globalists are in deep trouble.
[01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:20.149]  They're going to ban the fluoride in the water.
[01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.189]  They're coming after Pfizer and all of them.
[01:10:23.369 --> 01:10:28.789]  So this is an epic time to be alive, and the bad guys have just shown they're not going to sue for peace.
[01:10:28.869 --> 01:10:30.390]  They're not going to try to capitulate.
[01:10:30.569 --> 01:10:38.149]  Some are, like Zuckerberg and Bezos and Fetterman saying, you know, he's basically with Trump now.
[01:10:38.829 --> 01:10:40.470]  Trump's God-level trolling.
[01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:42.890]  He's trying to act like a Trump guy now.
[01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:47.510]  So a lot of people are coming over to us in the system, but that's because they can see we're winning.
[01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:54.109]  But the hardcore globalists Are not going to get away with this.
[01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:59.149]  So I'm asking everybody on X, everybody everywhere else, shoot your videos in support of the Alex Jones Network.
[01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.350]  We're all Spartacus.
[01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:03.630]  You know, when they were trying to find Spartacus to kill him, true story.
[01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.850]  It's in the great Stanley Kubrick movie with Kirk Douglas.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.420]  It's a true story.
[01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:11.239]  Romans wrote about this.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.859]  They were trying to find Spartacus so they could crucify him.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.060]  And he was about to get up and say, I'm Spartacus.
[01:11:16.159 --> 01:11:17.420]  And everybody else said, I'm Spartacus.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.000]  I'm Spartacus.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.659]  So everybody just say, I am in full wars.
[01:11:20.739 --> 01:11:22.039]  I don't believe the mainstream media.
[01:11:22.199 --> 01:11:23.039]  I tell the truth.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:23.920]  I do research.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.260]  I'm the new media, meaning you.
[01:11:27.399 --> 01:11:29.300]  And just everyone, I am Infowars.
[01:11:29.399 --> 01:11:30.359]  I am the Infowar.
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.359]  I am the Infowar.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.300]  I am the Infowar.
[01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:33.239]  I am the Infowar.
[01:11:33.319 --> 01:11:34.199]  I am the Infowar.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:44.319]  And then you just community notes and fact check The Onion, who's not been relevant forever, a has-been that never was, as the front group for Soros and these groups.
[01:11:44.399 --> 01:11:45.520]  They admit, you know, funded it.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.439]  And that's it.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:48.960]  They're a joke.
[01:11:49.399 --> 01:11:51.060]  They want to convince us we just lost.
[01:11:51.159 --> 01:11:52.539]  They want to convince us to lay down and die.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.380]  And nope, that's not what's happening.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.579]  That's not what went down.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.239]  And they took down somehow the first three hours of the emergency broadcast.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:01.880]  We've got that.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.680]  It's going back up.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:03.359]  Censored.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.500]  It'll blow up ten times bigger.
[01:12:04.819 --> 01:12:05.579]  So good luck.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.060]  We'll be right back.
[01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:20.899]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.039]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:26.359]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.159]  You exercise your free speech.
[01:12:28.359 --> 01:12:30.100]  You stand up to the bullies.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.439]  You exercise your will.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.579]  And it keeps this broadcast, and we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.920]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.939]  It's all set up.
[01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:55.170]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.579]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[01:13:01.439 --> 01:13:08.920]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[01:13:09.859 --> 01:13:13.680]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.579]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.180]  Beautiful black shirt with an American eagle and gold.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.060]  Says Trump won.
[01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:22.779]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.180]  People are going crazy over that.
[01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:26.039]  White with Trump won.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.859]  Today is your Independence Day, 127.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.819]  25, yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day, when we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[01:13:35.319 --> 01:13:35.920]  That's great.
[01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:39.340]  So many new hats, all of it made right there in Arkansas.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.520]  So you get this stuff quick.
[01:13:40.619 --> 01:13:41.479]  It's already being made right now.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.439]  A lot of new Trump shirts and stuff.
[01:13:43.439 --> 01:13:44.300]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.100]  Not our sponsor.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.060]  They're ready right now.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.779]  So your order's in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:13:49.819 --> 01:13:52.119]  So many amazing designs, thealexjohnstore.com.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:14:03.220]  And when you sign up at thealexjohnstore.com forward slash VIP or just click the VIP link at the top on the right hand side that's in red, when you do that, you get $40 each month to spend in the store for $30.
[01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:12.000]  So if you're going to buy the great supplements, going to get the great Patriot gear, going to support the broadcast, you've got to be VIP. It's month to month, $30, canceling time.
[01:14:12.359 --> 01:14:41.670]  So if you're going to be a supporter, everyone should be a VIP. Liberty thrives.
[01:14:41.829 --> 01:14:47.689]  And now, for the man the globalists fear most, it's Alex Jones, live on the Alex Jones Network.
[01:14:54.789 --> 01:14:56.369]  Hey, Wills, what is this place?
[01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:06.310]  It's a school for remarkable misfits, not unlike yourself, Donny J. Here, we turn the autistic into leaders, patriots, and heroes.
[01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:07.729]  Let me give you a tour.
[01:15:08.359 --> 01:15:11.539]  You had me at autistic, lead the way professor?
[01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:16.819]  We've gathered the best and brightest from around the world to combat the forces of darkness.
[01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:20.800]  Let me get a roll call already, you delightful cripple.
[01:15:22.399 --> 01:15:25.659]  Take Alex, for example, his powers identifying globalists.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.800]  That's a globalist.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.260]  Well done, Alex.
[01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:36.810]  Impressive.
[01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:39.569]  Show me more, you low-altitude genius.
[01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:41.729]  This is Josie.
[01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:44.689]  She's a constitutional scholar who isn't afraid to call people retards.
[01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:45.750]  Very promising.
[01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:48.569]  I don't find that uninspiring.
[01:15:49.289 --> 01:15:49.850]  Totally.
[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:51.350]  Then there's Joshua.
[01:15:51.569 --> 01:15:54.069]  He's a future senator who currently teaches counter-propaganda.
[01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.289]  His colleague Poso is impressive as well.
[01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:59.270]  1-800-Leaders.com?
[01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.890]  My goodness.
[01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:02.229]  I'm just getting warmed up, Tonya Jay.
[01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.529]  Hey, who's that big fella over there?
[01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:33.609]  That's Baron.
[01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:38.850]  He's only beginning to explore the depths of his power, but he's essential in the fight to come.
[01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:40.270]  Against whom, exactly?
[01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:42.510]  Me and the NPCs and perverts.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.399]  The natural bias of regulations is to last forever, unless there are actively...
[01:16:57.399 --> 01:17:03.800]  I mean, you have to actively delete a regulation or a law the way things are set up.
[01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.779]  In most laws, some laws have sunset provisions.
[01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:12.920]  And the problem with that is you get vested interests who like that law, and there's an inertia around it.
[01:17:13.119 --> 01:17:17.180]  And so, over time, the body of law and regulations grows and grows and grows.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.119]  And, I mean, it is...
[01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.989]  Something that I think is not ultimately good for society.
[01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:33.770]  So, in fact, I think it would generally be a good idea to have it such that it's hard to establish a rule and easy to remove one.
[01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:46.550]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:17:46.649 --> 01:17:48.050]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:52.869]  We're going to go to break here in about two minutes and join over 420 radio stations.
[01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:56.029]  We're up about 70 radio stations in the last month.
[01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:59.710]  I'd imagine we'll probably be on 600 in another month.
[01:18:00.289 --> 01:18:02.569]  So we're seeing how it worked out for the left.
[01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:12.090]  But let's go ahead and put up on screen the Drudge Report and use some image of me from the day they were trying to shut us down without a court order.
[01:18:13.369 --> 01:18:17.529]  In late May, and I was sad for Americans that they're about to try to kill Trump, which they did.
[01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:18.649]  Onion buys InfoWars.
[01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:19.069]  No, it didn't.
[01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:19.710]  The deep state did.
[01:18:19.789 --> 01:18:20.289]  They admit that.
[01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:22.050]  Democrat Party-funded group.
[01:18:23.069 --> 01:18:29.310]  Jones vows to fight, and I predicted they'd have a joke site taken over and flood disinfo, trying to pretend it's me.
[01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:41.789]  So that is exactly what the system is doing, and we have all these massive numbers of new people tuning in right now to the show you're not supposed to hear.
[01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:45.090]  And they also don't want me covering the news.
[01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.630]  They want me diverted by all of this.
[01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:47.270]  But this is historic.
[01:18:47.369 --> 01:18:47.750]  This is important.
[01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:48.590]  I'll talk about it some.
[01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:58.550]  But I'm also going to get into all the news, because the time's already run out for the globalists, and talk about all the big issues that they want to get me off balance not covering.
[01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:00.170]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:19:00.409 --> 01:19:03.649]  We're going to be covering it all here.
[01:19:04.050 --> 01:19:09.010]  And we'll have Harrison and Owen on as well.
[01:19:09.409 --> 01:19:12.310]  And then by tomorrow, we'll be right back, 8 a.m.
[01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:13.449]  to 10 p.m.
[01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:16.710]  Central, with the full Infowars lineup.
[01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:26.270]  And we're just going to add more shows and expand massively, and you'll see the new studios and everything else that you are funding, that you are building, at thealexjillestore.com.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:39.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:42.520]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:53.260]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[01:19:53.819 --> 01:19:55.119]  You got it right here.
[01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:56.890]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[01:19:57.010 --> 01:19:58.609]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:00.109]  It's not just a detox.
[01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:03.390]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:04.729]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:09.130]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[01:20:09.409 --> 01:20:12.090]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:14.310]  And it goes on and on.
[01:20:14.489 --> 01:20:16.029]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:17.149]  They're concentrated.
[01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:18.229]  They're incredible.
[01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:23.689]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30% and 50% off.
[01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:27.090]  50% off if you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:37.250]  Welcome to Alex Jones Live on the Alex Jones Network.
[01:20:37.569 --> 01:20:39.229]  Dear God's people.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:23.220]  Thousands of people every few minutes are going on X to at AJNLive for the Alex Jones Network.
[01:21:23.439 --> 01:21:24.859]  At AJNLive, we'll put it on screen.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.500]  And they're following us there.
[01:21:26.659 --> 01:21:34.859]  They're following us by the thousands every few minutes, adding at RealAlexJones on X. If you just tuned in, let me recap what's happened.
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:41.079]  And then I want to go into all the news that's affecting you as we take back America, as we take back the planet.
[01:21:42.199 --> 01:21:43.920]  We'll also show RealAlexJones on screen.
[01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:46.949]  I was talking about the deep state.
[01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:47.689]  It's all come out in court.
[01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:50.369]  The FBI, Justice Department, and the CIA ran it.
[01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.909]  That's all admitted.
[01:21:51.029 --> 01:21:57.729]  If you're a new viewer, just type in FBI admits to targeting Infowars, filing lawsuits, CIA admits to it.
[01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:59.510]  And then they had show trials.
[01:21:59.609 --> 01:22:00.409]  They already found me guilty.
[01:22:00.569 --> 01:22:01.430]  HBO ran it all.
[01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.270]  It was all scripted.
[01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:04.409]  Fake billion and a half dollar judgment.
[01:22:05.369 --> 01:22:06.430]  Forces into bankruptcy.
[01:22:07.069 --> 01:22:08.670]  Claimed I was a criminal hiding all this money.
[01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:09.510]  None of it was true.
[01:22:11.819 --> 01:22:16.899]  Then they tried to take my name and everything else in the last few months, tried to shut us down without court orders.
[01:22:16.899 --> 01:22:17.739]  I said no.
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.079]  When the federal trustee showed up, that guy got fired.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.880]  And then the federal judge said, well, Mr.
[01:22:23.979 --> 01:22:28.340]  Jones is in bankruptcy, so you can have an auction for it.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:35.979]  And then they set the auction months ago for November 13th, 48 hours before, the U.S. trustee, the new one.
[01:22:37.289 --> 01:22:44.470]  I said, well, now it's not going to be public, and you just have a new bid by Wednesday morning at 10 a.m.
[01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:45.270]  and at 10.30.
[01:22:45.529 --> 01:22:49.069]  We will open it, and the highest bidder will get it, but we might give it to somebody for less money.
[01:22:49.369 --> 01:22:50.569]  Well, that doesn't sound like an auction.
[01:22:50.789 --> 01:22:54.850]  Not public, can't bid above something, and we can give it to whoever we want.
[01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:55.810]  Nice, fine print.
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:57.369]  I said, guaranteed, fixes in.
[01:22:57.470 --> 01:23:00.689]  No matter how much money, it is not going to happen.
[01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:04.369]  And so all of that unfolded.
[01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:12.869]  And Then I got a call this morning.
[01:23:14.449 --> 01:23:16.430]  They wouldn't tell us who, quote, won it yesterday.
[01:23:17.449 --> 01:23:27.590]  And my lawyer's been meeting with the U.S. trustee here in Austin, come up from Houston, and they said, yeah, we didn't get the equipment, the name, any of it.
[01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:28.869]  They want you shut down.
[01:23:29.109 --> 01:23:30.369]  They're very public about it.
[01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:31.250]  They're all the news saying it.
[01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:34.210]  The Democratic Party threw the onion, which they admit funded it.
[01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:41.149]  And they've admitted, no, it was a less bid, but they get it.
[01:23:43.469 --> 01:23:46.310]  And then it wasn't even money they pledged.
[01:23:47.029 --> 01:23:50.529]  It was their judgment against me.
[01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:53.470]  What does that even mean?
[01:23:54.869 --> 01:23:57.710]  Which you can't do in court, which is totally illegal.
[01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:01.470]  Under federal law, that's on its face.
[01:24:01.649 --> 01:24:04.189]  So InfoWars isn't gone for sure.
[01:24:05.609 --> 01:24:10.590]  The studio, all of it, because we've filed an emergency injunction in federal court.
[01:24:10.789 --> 01:24:12.270]  I don't know when Lopez is going to hear it.
[01:24:12.329 --> 01:24:13.130]  It could be today, it could be tomorrow.
[01:24:13.329 --> 01:24:13.890]  Probably quickly.
[01:24:13.890 --> 01:24:14.829]  This is a big deal.
[01:24:15.449 --> 01:24:17.329]  Probably the top story in the country right now.
[01:24:17.449 --> 01:24:18.529]  It's all over the world.
[01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:19.510]  Top story on Drudge.
[01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:20.329]  Top everywhere.
[01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:28.369]  That, oh, finally justice, you know, InfoWars, the Sandy Hook families with the onion won.
[01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:32.569]  You won a secret auction where a lower bid got it?
[01:24:35.119 --> 01:24:45.659]  I mean, you know, it's like Gladiator in the final scene where he's won all the fights, so they tie him up and stab him in the heart first, and then he stumbles out to fight and still wins.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.260]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:24:48.119 --> 01:24:50.000]  Massive, insane Streisand effect.
[01:24:50.359 --> 01:24:57.180]  Everybody watching on X right now, take that live feed and share it everywhere.
[01:24:58.079 --> 01:24:59.579]  Let's get $50 million on it.
[01:25:00.159 --> 01:25:00.920]  We can do it.
[01:25:02.899 --> 01:25:06.420]  Take the other feeds from the AJN Network at AJN Live.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.840]  Share that feed.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.960]  All this belongs to you.
[01:25:10.119 --> 01:25:10.800]  Take our feed.
[01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:11.859]  Re-feed it yourself.
[01:25:12.779 --> 01:25:13.819]  Take clips out.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:14.659]  Upload them everywhere.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.039]  And Infowars belongs to you.
[01:25:17.619 --> 01:25:23.159]  I have all the video clips, the contracts, the documents I put on the website for decades that I don't own my show.
[01:25:23.239 --> 01:25:24.039]  The public owns it.
[01:25:24.279 --> 01:25:25.319]  It's a gift to the world.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:26.460]  100%.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.539]  Beyond free to air.
[01:25:29.319 --> 01:25:30.279]  That's what this is.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.720]  And we're going to expand.
[01:25:37.779 --> 01:25:39.239]  We're going to have more reporters.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.560]  We're going to have more live shows.
[01:25:40.699 --> 01:25:43.380]  We're going to have amazing, even bigger studios.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:49.560]  We are going to go into high gear in the new American renaissance that's taking place.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.560]  And the hunted, as Steve Bannon said, are becoming the hunters for justice.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.960]  And we are taking action everywhere.
[01:25:57.239 --> 01:26:00.939]  So when you support thealexjonesstore.com, it is so critical to keep this fight going.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.260]  You're the missing link.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:03.560]  You're the only variable.
[01:26:03.739 --> 01:26:04.680]  I know you're going to come through.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.199]  You already are.
[01:26:05.779 --> 01:26:10.199]  When you get t-shirts, great supplements, and so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:26:11.949 --> 01:26:16.229]  When you become a VIP member, cancel any time, but $30 a month, you get $40 in the store each month.
[01:26:16.409 --> 01:26:17.310]  That's a great deal.
[01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:21.529]  It's special deals, special offers, sales on top of sales.
[01:26:22.989 --> 01:26:27.149]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:31.869]  And that's our legal actions going on the offense, just like President Trump.
[01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:36.869]  We are critical of staying on the air to defend Trump, to get him into office, get him inoccurated.
[01:26:37.369 --> 01:26:38.750]  I told you he went on a landslide.
[01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:39.810]  I told you they'd try to steal.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.600]  And none of that goes to these clowns.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.600]  None of it goes to support what they're doing.
[01:26:45.939 --> 01:26:51.119]  In fact, it goes directly into legal actions against them.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.739]  And more crew, more people, more powerful operation.
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:03.460]  And I told the crew, it's rigged.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.180]  They'll think to hit us in the morning.
[01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:10.930]  They're going to get their press releases ready and everything.
[01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:14.989]  I said they'll hit at 8 a.m.
[01:27:15.069 --> 01:27:17.750]  in the morning in a meeting here Tuesday in these offices.
[01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:21.409]  Or was that meeting Tuesday?
[01:27:22.489 --> 01:27:23.930]  No, it was Monday.
[01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:26.250]  Monday, actually.
[01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:29.949]  And I said, so Harrison will already be on the air.
[01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.789]  Without a court order, they'll order us off air.
[01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:36.949]  But the auction will be rigged, so we're going to challenge that.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.939]  I said, we'll have bigger bids with our folks working with, but that won't matter.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.060]  They don't care.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:51.840]  And then I said, so we'll probably sign off on Harrison's show and then come over here.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.619]  And I said, be ready to go by 10 a.m.
[01:27:53.739 --> 01:27:54.899]  over here, as if we're going on at 10 a.m.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.479]  And I get it.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.640]  You know, most of the stuff I say comes true.
[01:27:59.239 --> 01:28:14.119]  And it was crazy with the feds in the office, and they were turning the infowars off, turning band-out video off, and Soon as I left the office, just the consoles and the uplinks and the stuff got turned off.
[01:28:14.939 --> 01:28:16.960]  So that wasn't our crew did that.
[01:28:19.439 --> 01:28:21.819]  So they just couldn't help but do all this.
[01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:27.039]  Couldn't help but have this insane fake auction.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.199]  Couldn't help but instantly shut it down and then plaster it and celebrate it everywhere.
[01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:37.789]  Just like the Trump mugshot, they thought, remember, we've got to find those clips.
[01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:39.550]  I've had compilations where they're like, you've seen it.
[01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:40.390]  Man, he's dumb.
[01:28:40.489 --> 01:28:41.789]  When that mugshot hits, he's out of it.
[01:28:41.909 --> 01:28:42.529]  It's over.
[01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:43.909]  People are going to hate him now.
[01:28:43.989 --> 01:28:45.630]  A criminal, a felon.
[01:28:47.329 --> 01:28:49.029]  No, people are sick of the establishment.
[01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:50.069]  They're sick of being bullied.
[01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.250]  They know Trump's innocent.
[01:28:52.069 --> 01:28:55.729]  And what you just saw, let me show you my mugshot.
[01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:58.250]  My mugshot is the Drudge Report headline right now.
[01:29:01.029 --> 01:29:03.670]  Onion buys Infowars, Alex Jones vows the fight.
[01:29:05.659 --> 01:29:14.460]  I mean, and they said, the different groups in the news, Media Matters, Soros' group, all of them said, and then we're going to claim we own everything he ever said and take it off the internet.
[01:29:14.699 --> 01:29:15.819]  It's free speech.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.100]  I'm not a musician.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.340]  I didn't sell my name to Sony like Prince.
[01:29:19.579 --> 01:29:21.819]  I'm not going to be the guy formerly known as Alex Jones.
[01:29:21.979 --> 01:29:24.359]  It's 100% in law, insane.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.619]  But they still filed saying, Jones is not afforded the 13th Amendment.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.079]  Everybody is in this country.
[01:29:29.079 --> 01:29:29.739]  It's a citizen.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.039]  The abolition of slavery, they said, that does not affect me.
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.359]  I've already showed you the Bloomberg from a month ago.
[01:29:40.159 --> 01:29:43.739]  So they're using me to try to set up all these precedents.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.600]  That's why we're a rallying point.
[01:29:45.739 --> 01:29:48.640]  You know, most of World War II was fought between Russia and Germany.
[01:29:48.939 --> 01:29:50.119]  The U.S. was there.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:30:03.729]  We lost hundreds of thousands of troops, but 24 million Germans, 25, 26 million Russians, and half the death is estimated to happen from them to So that's over 20 million people in and around Stalingrad.
[01:30:04.289 --> 01:30:08.250]  So the Germans and the Russians decided to slug it out at Stalingrad.
[01:30:10.829 --> 01:30:14.890]  And Trump has been their Stalingrad.
[01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.850]  And I'm right there second to that.
[01:30:18.029 --> 01:30:19.470]  And they're going after Musk too now.
[01:30:19.829 --> 01:30:21.909]  But I am your Stalingrad.
[01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:24.689]  This operation is your Stalingrad.
[01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:28.289]  Guys, give me the Wikipedia on the Battle of Stalingrad.
[01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:28.750]  Print it for me.
[01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:32.250]  I mean, it'll have, you know, hopefully that's not too corrupted.
[01:30:32.369 --> 01:30:34.789]  Or just get me the Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica, Battle of Stalingrad.
[01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:38.310]  Okay, and then over 10 million dead, I know that.
[01:30:38.909 --> 01:30:43.670]  But in and around the battles of Stalingrad, they say like half the casualties of the Russians, the Germans was there.
[01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:46.949]  So, this is the Roman standard.
[01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:49.270]  This is what they want.
[01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:51.590]  This is what they've been targeting.
[01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:53.750]  This is what they've been coming.
[01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:55.069]  Yeah, go to that camera.
[01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:56.189]  I want to show people what we're talking about right here.
[01:30:56.369 --> 01:30:58.689]  This is important stuff here.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.399]  This is D-Day, but I want to show...
[01:31:01.399 --> 01:31:03.680]  Go on YouTube and get Battle of Stalingrad.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.500]  Because I'm...
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:09.720]  Of course, my grandfathers were in the invasion of Europe and all that amount lessening it.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.520]  And my dad's dad got Flying Cross, B-17 pilot.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:21.560]  But the point is, that was child's play compared to the Russians and the Germans slugging it out of point-blank range.
[01:31:21.979 --> 01:31:24.300]  So, this is Stalingrad.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.180]  This is the fight.
[01:31:27.329 --> 01:31:30.449]  This is the hill where they decide to have the real slugout.
[01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:34.510]  And they just cannot stand the fact we're still on air.
[01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.029]  They can't stand the fact we did this.
[01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:38.109]  And they're going to attack this.
[01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:40.729]  And they're going to just attack and attack and attack.
[01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:41.350]  And that's great.
[01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:44.470]  Because we are on the attack.
[01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:45.689]  And we are going to win.
[01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:48.069]  And we're going to take the country back.
[01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:49.470]  We're going to dig the deep state out.
[01:31:49.569 --> 01:31:57.189]  Just like Hitler and his bunker in 1945 at the end of World War II. It was finally condensed down to just a square block he was in.
[01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:04.670]  So, guaranteed, New World Order, you're done.
[01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:07.050]  I don't know what's going to happen to me in all this.
[01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:08.109]  I'm just a casualty of war.
[01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:08.590]  That's fine.
[01:32:08.729 --> 01:32:11.329]  But we are a focal point.
[01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:21.609]  We are a symbol of the global estate, Infowars, myself, the crew, the listeners, the guests, everything we've been a part of.
[01:32:23.119 --> 01:32:28.159]  Everything we've done, that's the reality.
[01:32:30.699 --> 01:32:36.500]  And again, oh, it's an open thing for months.
[01:32:36.779 --> 01:32:38.479]  Oh, sorry, it's not.
[01:32:38.859 --> 01:32:40.859]  Oh, we can take less money, and they did.
[01:32:42.119 --> 01:32:53.170]  Because Alex Jones, just like any other patriot, Isn't afforded access to the bankruptcy system, in the words of the Justice Department in an email to one of my lawyers.
[01:32:53.289 --> 01:32:54.789]  That's how arrogant they are two years ago.
[01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:57.310]  Nothing you will do will overcome us.
[01:32:57.529 --> 01:32:58.109]  Was it overcoming?
[01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:59.090]  I'm like, here I am.
[01:32:59.210 --> 01:32:59.989]  I don't have a bunch of money.
[01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:00.909]  I want to settle.
[01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.470]  Nope.
[01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:05.529]  We just want to keep you in the process, keep you in the lawfare.
[01:33:06.029 --> 01:33:09.510]  And here they are saying, they didn't want money from me.
[01:33:09.609 --> 01:33:10.829]  They wanted me off the air.
[01:33:12.489 --> 01:33:17.449]  They buy it from themselves, and then they'll instantly turn around and say, Jones is hiding money.
[01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:20.649]  Jones is not giving us our money, and chase me around with that.
[01:33:20.789 --> 01:33:21.350]  It's fine.
[01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:22.229]  I got my appeals.
[01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:24.529]  They'll definitely lose in Texas.
[01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:25.949]  We'll go to the Supreme Court on the other one.
[01:33:26.609 --> 01:33:28.149]  And then how do they do that?
[01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:30.590]  How do they deal with that?
[01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:31.689]  See, they just need me to quit.
[01:33:32.289 --> 01:33:33.149]  They need me to go away.
[01:33:33.869 --> 01:33:35.649]  Only way I quit is if you don't fund me.
[01:33:37.449 --> 01:33:39.930]  And we also launched a new legal fundraiser.
[01:33:40.029 --> 01:33:43.090]  I want to thank those that did support the last one that helped pay off the bills.
[01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:45.210]  Now we've got to go forward.
[01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.729]  And we're going to get that URL loaded up during the next break.
[01:33:48.869 --> 01:33:50.670]  And I'll put that on screen and I'm going to move on.
[01:33:51.329 --> 01:33:57.289]  But now is the time to get a map of how we won the country in the election.
[01:33:57.449 --> 01:34:00.029]  And it says, better coverage than Verizon.
[01:34:00.909 --> 01:34:02.210]  Now can you hear us?
[01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:04.430]  What a great Trump shirt.
[01:34:05.529 --> 01:34:06.350]  And so much more.
[01:34:06.449 --> 01:34:07.130]  That's one of my favorites.
[01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:09.449]  And then realalexjones.com right there.
[01:34:09.529 --> 01:34:10.210]  That'll be a new site.
[01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:12.210]  Right now, that's a shopping cart, realalexjones.com.
[01:34:13.069 --> 01:34:15.250]  And we'll turn alexjones.network into a new site.
[01:34:15.329 --> 01:34:16.149]  And all that's being done.
[01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.869]  And that takes crew.
[01:34:16.989 --> 01:34:17.449]  And that takes money.
[01:34:17.489 --> 01:34:17.890]  That's fine.
[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:18.989]  We're going to do great.
[01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:21.090]  Because I know you're pissed off.
[01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:22.189]  I know you're supporting us.
[01:34:22.369 --> 01:34:25.289]  And I want to thank you for what you're doing.
[01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:33.329]  So, we did two and a half hours this morning.
[01:34:36.289 --> 01:34:38.670]  And then I talked to the trustee and I said, you'll get beaten in court.
[01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:39.170]  This is wrong.
[01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:39.890]  I believe what you've done.
[01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:41.810]  My lawyers agree.
[01:34:42.029 --> 01:34:45.689]  But, you know, you say this is your operation.
[01:34:45.869 --> 01:34:46.689]  You're already turning everything off.
[01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:47.649]  I was watching it get turned off.
[01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:48.750]  Literally, I'm sitting there.
[01:34:49.449 --> 01:34:50.289]  This is turning off.
[01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.970]  That's turning off.
[01:34:51.029 --> 01:34:52.649]  And I said, I'm going to go ahead and get over to the other studio.
[01:34:54.029 --> 01:35:00.829]  And I walk out of the office and then somebody runs in and just starts flipping switches off.
[01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:03.710]  I imagine that's how it was happening.
[01:35:04.659 --> 01:35:05.880]  I mean, just flailing.
[01:35:06.199 --> 01:35:09.460]  That's equivalent if you're losing a chess game, you go, ah, and throw it over.
[01:35:10.119 --> 01:35:13.420]  Because there's an emotional hysteria to it.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.359]  Oh, God, Trump's here!
[01:35:14.659 --> 01:35:16.100]  At least we can get Alex Jones!
[01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:19.439]  And I'm so honored.
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:26.939]  That they say this operation was the detonator that created the global awakening, because it was.
[01:35:27.119 --> 01:35:30.779]  Not just me, but the films, the crew, the guests, everything we've done.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:36.979]  Billions and billions [...] of years just on YouTube alone.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.619]  Hundreds of radio stations for 28 years.
[01:35:43.399 --> 01:35:48.760]  Cable stations, TV stations, number one on cloud TV. Making sure that's all synced up to them right now.
[01:35:50.619 --> 01:35:51.500]  All of it.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:58.680]  So they said Alex Jones is pace at zero.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.819]  Alex Jones is, you know, it's this family.
[01:36:01.939 --> 01:36:19.020]  And so the level of attack we're under is all emblematic of how effective we are And how desperate the globalists are, because the time is running out for them.
[01:36:20.359 --> 01:36:24.359]  And so, as long as we understand that, I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:36:27.619 --> 01:36:50.460]  I cannot overstate to you how bad things are going for the globalists, how everything they touch falls apart, how the world is absolutely waking up at light speed, And what an amazing time we're alive and also what a dangerous time is because these corner rats will do anything and they're going to get desperate and they are getting desperate and they're making big mistakes.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.819]  And they still control the nuclear weapons until he gets in on the 20th of January.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.060]  So Trump understands this existentially.
[01:36:58.239 --> 01:36:59.880]  He understands it's a death battle politically.
[01:37:00.239 --> 01:37:02.420]  Not literally, though they tried to kill him.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:03.439]  It is on their side.
[01:37:03.819 --> 01:37:05.479]  We understand we've got the initiative.
[01:37:05.659 --> 01:37:06.659]  We've got the soft power.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.979]  We've got the intellectual high ground.
[01:37:09.399 --> 01:37:13.460]  I mean, they're down in hell and we're up on top of Mount Everest seeing the stars.
[01:37:14.359 --> 01:37:20.319]  And this is just such a seismic moment.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.640]  And quite frankly...
[01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:27.970]  If I was trying to come up with a script to destroy myself, I would do what they've done.
[01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:46.310]  But they just had an asleep public, an entertained public, an anesthetized public, drunk on bread and circuses, and they had control for so long in their hubris and their arrogance that they believed this would just go on forever.
[01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:50.949]  And now they see the harder they squeeze, the more they attack, the more they bully.
[01:37:53.329 --> 01:37:59.350]  Things are just backfiring, but they're not giving up.
[01:37:59.649 --> 01:38:04.210]  So as Napoleon Barnaparte said, never interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[01:38:04.989 --> 01:38:06.810]  Never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.
[01:38:08.609 --> 01:38:12.270]  And they have definitely done that.
[01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:17.789]  If they were willing to come in and spend the money and outbid people, it would have been fair and square.
[01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:22.130]  Even though the whole case was based on was fraud, but at least at that level, there'd be some legitimacy.
[01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:23.949]  There is zero now.
[01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:31.270]  Public auction, 11th hour, stop that, secret bids.
[01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:35.590]  You don't have to have the most money to win the bid in an auction.
[01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:36.390]  You ever heard of that before?
[01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.989]  No, that's like upside-down world.
[01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:43.569]  And then instantly, they want you shut down now.
[01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:44.289]  Now.
[01:38:44.289 --> 01:38:49.060]  They want the pleasure Of seeing you scramble.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.319]  Well, you know who likes to see that too?
[01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:53.159]  The public.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.079]  You think they see you as the good guys doing this?
[01:38:57.479 --> 01:39:09.840]  Maybe in your little weirdo bubbles where you never leave your high-rise apartments and you're on a bunch of different serotonin reuptake inhibitors and most of you probably already chopped your son's penises off if you did have kids.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.180]  Yeah, you see that?
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:24.399]  Those instructs in acquiring Jones Media Company had submitted their final offers to the federal court, appointed trustee Christopher Murray, who was tasked with picking the best bid, not necessarily the highest.
[01:39:24.659 --> 01:39:25.500]  The best.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.739]  Kind of like they define what disinformation is.
[01:39:27.819 --> 01:39:28.859]  They define what truth is.
[01:39:29.039 --> 01:39:30.140]  Oh, the best.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.020]  It's not the highest.
[01:39:31.039 --> 01:39:32.000]  It's now the best.
[01:39:32.939 --> 01:39:39.079]  The identities of potential buyers were secret as they had to agree to nondisclosure agreements in order to receive bid materials.
[01:39:39.399 --> 01:39:39.699]  Sure.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.359]  Sure.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:49.659]  Sure, that's why yesterday CNN said Alex Jones' people, the people he's working with, they have the highest bid.
[01:39:50.539 --> 01:39:52.439]  But they knew it didn't matter.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.539]  Because since when does having the highest bid mean you win?
[01:39:59.439 --> 01:40:00.699]  And it gets worse.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.359]  Murray told me over the phone in front of witnesses.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.159]  They're not even putting money down.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.239]  The agreements and all of it with all the witnesses and the contract said cash.
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:19.239]  They can pay it on credit.
[01:40:20.899 --> 01:40:24.739]  Because it's the innocent people that I peed on.
[01:40:24.899 --> 01:40:25.800]  I peed on the graves.
[01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:26.720]  I killed the children.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.180]  All made up.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.880]  You don't think of Adam Lanza that killed the kids.
[01:40:33.979 --> 01:40:34.479]  You think of me.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.180]  Because they went and made a huge PR thing years after it.
[01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:40.930]  And said I did all these things I didn't do.
[01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:49.510]  So they could be victims and stay relevant and raise money off me for anti-free speech and anti-gun.
[01:40:50.369 --> 01:40:50.869]  Crusades.
[01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:54.029]  Oh, but it's quite a story, isn't it?
[01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.890]  It's all coming out.
[01:40:55.329 --> 01:40:58.409]  And I was told there's three big films getting made about it.
[01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:00.189]  Hmm, that could be interesting.
[01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:05.729]  With what really happened in the depositions, what really came out.
[01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:08.229]  So good luck.
[01:41:08.649 --> 01:41:10.829]  Hope you enjoy your fake victory.
[01:41:11.609 --> 01:41:13.890]  Hope you think you've deadened our spirits.
[01:41:14.069 --> 01:41:16.189]  Do I look like my spirits are deadened?
[01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:18.250]  Do I look like I'm putting a good face on this?
[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:20.289]  Do I look like I've been beaten?
[01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:21.029]  No.
[01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:23.550]  We're winning worldwide.
[01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:24.729]  Liberty's exploding.
[01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:25.970]  We're never giving up.
[01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:27.390]  And there's one link.
[01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:31.890]  That's people sharing the articles and videos and feeds.
[01:41:32.529 --> 01:41:33.510]  Word of mouth.
[01:41:34.569 --> 01:41:42.550]  Praying for us and going to the alexjonesstore.com that isn't owned by me, that's by a big company that makes all the big Trump t-shirts.
[01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:49.930]  Everybody else, they'll have their good luck claiming that's my company when I have no stock in it, no control over it.
[01:41:50.329 --> 01:41:52.250]  My dad's company is 100% his.
[01:41:52.569 --> 01:41:54.970]  drjonesnaggles.com is another great place to support.
[01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:58.250]  Now, drjonesnaggles.com is one of the best amazing supplements out there.
[01:41:59.670 --> 01:42:03.810]  And you support us, you guaranteed get the fight.
[01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:07.760]  You guarantee get the resistance.
[01:42:08.819 --> 01:42:09.779]  There's Harrison Smith.
[01:42:09.899 --> 01:42:10.800]  We'll be going to him when we come back.
[01:42:10.939 --> 01:42:11.699]  Steve Bannon and more.
[01:42:12.979 --> 01:42:18.439]  But again, millions of people on the streams this morning.
[01:42:19.239 --> 01:42:20.699]  I've never seen X do that.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.760]  You kill a stream, it just loops back to the beginning.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.399]  Static and black screen.
[01:42:26.979 --> 01:42:28.079]  Static for 10 minutes.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.819]  Literally, the door hadn't hit me on the ass.
[01:42:35.979 --> 01:42:48.239]  And the hookups to X, not the equipment there, but somehow someone had access to X out of the building.
[01:42:50.319 --> 01:42:52.119]  I think that's the only way it could happen.
[01:42:52.439 --> 01:42:55.699]  And killed our streams that aren't yours.
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:58.439]  You think that stopped anything?
[01:42:59.119 --> 01:43:01.159]  The new stream came up at 11 a.m.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:01.560]  Central.
[01:43:03.399 --> 01:43:04.000]  And...
[01:43:06.529 --> 01:43:10.289]  We were fine-tuning a satellite, and I was like a crazy captain on the deck of a ship.
[01:43:10.409 --> 01:43:11.289]  We had a little hiccup.
[01:43:11.369 --> 01:43:11.909]  That makes it better.
[01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:16.390]  And here we are, baby, hitting our second wind, coming in with a big victory.
[01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:17.609]  Pray for Infowars.
[01:43:17.689 --> 01:43:18.550]  Please pray for me, my family.
[01:43:18.789 --> 01:43:19.310]  Pray for the crew.
[01:43:19.409 --> 01:43:22.489]  Tell everybody you know and those you don't know, tune in now to Real Alex Jones.
[01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:24.829]  Let's get that up to 50 million in the live stream.
[01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:25.489]  Let's do it!
[01:43:28.239 --> 01:43:38.819]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.

[01:43:42.619 --> 01:43:53.060]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[01:43:53.619 --> 01:43:54.899]  You got it right here.
[01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:56.689]  The ultimate gut cleanse.

[01:43:58.770 --> 01:43:59.909]  It's not just a detox.
[01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:03.189]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[01:44:03.489 --> 01:44:04.529]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[01:44:04.869 --> 01:44:11.890]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands, and even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[01:44:12.199 --> 01:44:14.119]  And it goes on and on.
[01:44:14.279 --> 01:44:15.779]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:16.939]  They're concentrated.
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:18.020]  They're incredible.

[01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:39.210]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:40.710]  And we've come out with it.
[01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:45.970]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShow.com.
[01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:47.689]  But I personally like this one.
[01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:52.949]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the info war and supports President Trump.
[01:44:53.409 --> 01:44:56.010]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.

[01:45:07.409 --> 01:45:13.869]  Now that the FDA admits fluoride does lower your IQ and give you cancer and infertility, it's a great time to wear one of these beautiful hats.
[01:45:14.119 --> 01:45:16.420]  And it's a great way to start a conversation and warn people.
[01:45:16.579 --> 01:45:19.180]  Here's the classic Make America Great Again Murdered Out.

[01:45:58.789 --> 01:46:00.189]  They can try to steal his identity.
[01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:01.550]  They can try to steal his business.
[01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:03.109]  They can try to steal America.
[01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:06.390]  They can try to sacrifice humanity in nuclear genocide.
[01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:17.710]  But if you go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club, they'll never take away our voice, they'll never take away our freedom, they'll never take away free speech, and we can save America together.

[01:47:42.359 --> 01:47:44.840]  Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[01:47:45.119 --> 01:47:47.199]  You're listening to Alex Jones Live.
[01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:55.800]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:00.859]  He literally just got, in my opinion, shanghaied, hijacked this morning.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.220]  No court order, nothing.
[01:48:03.439 --> 01:48:07.520]  Yeah, the U.S. trustee had an order he could sell stuff at bankruptcy, but he couldn't, in my view.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.520]  Change the bid process from not being public and not being the highest bidder last minute.
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:23.760]  And then they told the good guys that they were able to buy it that it would take a month for them to get it, but the bad guys get to shut it down instantly and then run around like chickens with their heads cut off celebrating.
[01:48:24.699 --> 01:48:31.619]  It's just amazing to see it, but it's part and parcel of the bullying and the deep state and the lawfare and the system.
[01:48:31.859 --> 01:48:45.010]  And what they did And how they did this and how they took a lower bid on pledged money on something that isn't even an asset is just unbelievable.
[01:48:45.689 --> 01:48:47.569]  So we'll see what Judge Lopez does.
[01:48:47.729 --> 01:48:49.670]  This doesn't mean we won't be back in the M4 studios.
[01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:52.050]  It doesn't mean we won't be operating back out of there.
[01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:53.810]  But regardless, we win.
[01:48:53.930 --> 01:48:54.630]  We told the truth.
[01:48:54.789 --> 01:48:55.569]  We got Trump elected.
[01:48:55.689 --> 01:48:56.689]  We exposed the deep state.
[01:48:56.869 --> 01:48:57.890]  We were stalwarts.
[01:48:57.970 --> 01:48:58.710]  We didn't back down.
[01:48:58.869 --> 01:49:00.789]  We didn't sell out, which they offered us to do.
[01:49:00.909 --> 01:49:01.670]  I told you about that.
[01:49:03.359 --> 01:49:05.699]  It is absolutely insane.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.159]  So they're tasked with picking the best bid, not necessarily the highest bid.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:29.159]  They're even, you know, when I was in Connecticut for the second show trial two years ago, at this time two years ago, and I was sitting there, you know, just witnessing all of this, they openly said,
[01:49:29.279 --> 01:49:29.859]  we don't want money.
[01:49:30.279 --> 01:49:31.539]  We want him off the air.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:42.619]  And then they run around always saying they want money to act like I owe them money when it's a totally rigged process.
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:47.439]  So, and they keep saying the Onion wins Alex Jones in force bankruptcy.
[01:49:47.439 --> 01:49:49.619]  Oh, because they paid less?
[01:49:51.819 --> 01:49:53.859]  I mean, couldn't they do anything?
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.180]  Couldn't they just come pay more?
[01:49:57.539 --> 01:49:57.979]  No.
[01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:01.670]  Because that's what these people do.
[01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:05.369]  Everything with them has got to be like a dog's hind leg.
[01:50:06.409 --> 01:50:07.729]  Like a barrel of snakes.
[01:50:09.789 --> 01:50:14.510]  And I want to put a URL on screen right now.
[01:50:15.369 --> 01:50:17.729]  Then I'm going to go into the news and move on to other things.
[01:50:17.729 --> 01:50:19.630]  I'll do updates as they unfold.
[01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:31.850]  But there's a URL. Everybody that wants to see us fight for our freedom, fight for your freedom, continue to defend Trump, continue to spotlight the deep state, fightforalex.com.
[01:50:33.069 --> 01:50:33.869]  You go there.
[01:50:33.970 --> 01:50:34.909]  That's a give, send, go.
[01:50:35.210 --> 01:50:36.489]  We're launching right now.
[01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:44.189]  For legal offense and defense and for future operations in the face of the deep state.
[01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:45.609]  I will never give in.
[01:50:46.829 --> 01:50:48.029]  I will never back down.
[01:50:48.729 --> 01:50:50.310]  I will never roll over.
[01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:53.329]  But without your backing, I can't do this.
[01:50:53.409 --> 01:50:54.170]  And I'm backing you.
[01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:55.090]  I'm standing up for you.
[01:50:55.170 --> 01:50:57.189]  As Trump said a million times, they're not trying to get him.
[01:50:57.289 --> 01:50:57.930]  He's standing in the way.
[01:50:58.029 --> 01:50:58.649]  They're trying to get you.
[01:50:58.770 --> 01:50:59.550]  And you can see that.
[01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:01.189]  We're going to secure the border.
[01:51:01.289 --> 01:51:02.170]  We're going to stabilize the dollar.
[01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:03.069]  We're going to bring jobs back.
[01:51:03.170 --> 01:51:04.270]  We're going to cut the price of energy.
[01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:06.569]  We're going to Deal with the inflation.
[01:51:06.569 --> 01:51:07.689]  We're gonna do it all.
[01:51:07.989 --> 01:51:09.630]  We're gonna expose the election fraud.
[01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:12.350]  We're gonna go after the deep state legally and lawfully.
[01:51:14.619 --> 01:51:15.840]  But we cannot do it.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.220]  The tip of the spear cannot continue to operate without you.
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:18.939]  So show them.
[01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:19.600]  They're watching.
[01:51:19.979 --> 01:51:21.979]  Let them know they're up against the American people.

[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:56.039]  Invest in your information operations like the globalists do.
[01:51:56.199 --> 01:51:56.859]  Invest in the truth.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:57.600]  They invest in lies.

[01:52:34.649 --> 01:52:46.189]  So now you see we fought him off politically And when they sent armed people there saying the U.S. trustee, the last one, Justice Department, says close the doors, kick you out.
[01:52:47.369 --> 01:52:48.270]  It was late May.
[01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:50.270]  Took us weeks to get in front of the judge.
[01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:51.850]  He fired him.
[01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:54.010]  Said it was wrong on June 14th.
[01:52:59.449 --> 01:53:09.989]  And They just showed up and said, and I was talking to the security people, talking to the head of the security company that we'd had for seven, eight years.
[01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.210]  He said, yeah, it's crazy.
[01:53:11.329 --> 01:53:13.869]  I got this, you know, the U.S. trustee lady saying she's with the federal government.
[01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.789]  She closed the doors.
[01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:20.289]  And I said to the head of the company, I said to Tim, good friend of mine.
[01:53:20.409 --> 01:53:21.770]  I mean, I like the guy, smart guy.
[01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:24.890]  And I said, Tim, have you ever heard anything like that without a warrant, without a court order?
[01:53:25.529 --> 01:53:26.789]  And he said, no, I'm not going to do it.
[01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:29.630]  And then I said, well, I'm going to sleep here.
[01:53:29.729 --> 01:53:30.390]  He says, you don't need to do that.
[01:53:30.489 --> 01:53:32.289]  And I said, no, they're going to try to hire another security company.
[01:53:32.489 --> 01:53:33.090]  Did it the next day.
[01:53:33.819 --> 01:53:38.880]  And I told everybody, I said, you come here and I'm calling the police.
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:42.720]  And when the cops show up, I'm going to say, where's the court order?
[01:53:42.979 --> 01:53:46.359]  The cops know, you know, court order going in and taking something.
[01:53:46.579 --> 01:53:47.340]  Didn't have it.
[01:53:48.399 --> 01:53:51.300]  And that pissed them off so royal you couldn't believe it.
[01:53:51.439 --> 01:53:56.720]  So the judge got rid of that guy, brought in these new ones, and I said, I hope this is clean.
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.600]  I hope this is good.
[01:54:00.079 --> 01:54:01.460]  And voila!
[01:54:02.779 --> 01:54:03.880]  What have you seen happen?
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:08.539]  I'll ask you, men and women of the jury, the people, the American people and others watching.
[01:54:08.699 --> 01:54:09.500]  We'll go to Harrison Smith.
[01:54:10.619 --> 01:54:11.659]  I'll ask you a question.
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:17.420]  Two months ago, they said it's up for bid on November 13th.
[01:54:18.619 --> 01:54:20.920]  You have to file with them a nondisclosure.
[01:54:21.239 --> 01:54:22.260]  Everybody wants to buy it.
[01:54:22.319 --> 01:54:23.579]  Bad guys or good guys are indifferent.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.399]  You have to show them proof of funds, and then you have to have your bid in by November 8th.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:49.420]  Well, November 11th comes along at 2 p.m., and my lawyers get called, and I'm going to recap this and I'm done, and they told him, and they emailed him, U.S. Trustee Chris Murray, and said, rules are changed.
[01:54:49.579 --> 01:54:51.100]  It will now be a sealed bid.
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.420]  The final bids will be none of your other bids matter.
[01:54:56.590 --> 01:54:59.930]  Will be the morning of November 13th at 10 a.m.
[01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.250]  Central.
[01:55:00.529 --> 01:55:04.050]  At 10.30 they will be opened and the highest person will get it.
[01:55:04.329 --> 01:55:06.449]  This is in front of witnesses, all of it on record.
[01:55:07.670 --> 01:55:15.069]  But then they get sent the new contract if they want to file for the November 13th bid at 10 a.m.
[01:55:16.590 --> 01:55:25.829]  And they're told Chris Murray has the authority, he says, He believes the court's giving, which we believe he hasn't gotten that authority.
[01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:27.869]  He's exceeded it massively, in my opinion.
[01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.789]  We'll see.
[01:55:30.029 --> 01:55:31.590]  To take lower bids.
[01:55:33.329 --> 01:55:36.390]  Now, this morning when I learned this and he told me, I thought, this sounds crazy.
[01:55:36.449 --> 01:55:37.229]  People aren't going to believe that.
[01:55:38.210 --> 01:55:40.130]  The crew just types in what I say.
[01:55:40.369 --> 01:55:44.909]  I didn't know it was AP, Reuters, NBC, CNN, New York Times.
[01:55:45.170 --> 01:55:46.710]  Well, they didn't take the biggest bid.
[01:55:48.289 --> 01:55:49.770]  They took the best one.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:56:00.279]  So the onion and the Democrats can wear me like a shrunken head around their waist, they think, or mount my head on the wall and claim they own my identity.
[01:56:00.659 --> 01:56:02.520]  Good luck with that.
[01:56:03.779 --> 01:56:06.979]  So everything I've been told by Chris Murray, he goes back on.
[01:56:08.899 --> 01:56:09.859]  He's changed.
[01:56:11.159 --> 01:56:13.979]  And so that's where I stand.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.779]  I told him, well, you're turning the power off.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:18.560]  I don't think you have that authority.
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.340]  I say you shouldn't.
[01:56:20.230 --> 01:56:21.510]  Everything's being turned off around me.
[01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:24.409]  So, I'm going to go sign off.
[01:56:24.489 --> 01:56:25.350]  He goes, I'm fine with you doing that.
[01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:28.489]  Well, you don't have the authority anyways, but that's what I'm doing.
[01:56:29.869 --> 01:56:31.630]  So, it's you that hijacked this, not me.
[01:56:31.789 --> 01:56:32.329]  Got it all recorded.
[01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:33.170]  Told them I'd record it.
[01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:36.909]  And because he'd left the building, thought I was coming to confront him with cameras.
[01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:37.430]  I wasn't.
[01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.529]  Steve Bannon, that was his idea.
[01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:40.090]  Not saying Steve's bad for saying that.
[01:56:40.210 --> 01:56:40.789]  That's what Steve would do.
[01:56:41.130 --> 01:56:42.930]  Steve's even bigger, you know, over the line than I am.
[01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:44.829]  I'm just, you know, friendly right there.
[01:56:45.729 --> 01:56:48.489]  I'm not going to let them put me in some box of some, you know, pirate.
[01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:52.569]  And that's obviously what Rachel Maddow told the left act like, go after everybody violently.
[01:56:53.010 --> 01:56:54.970]  And Carvel said, violent uprisings, that's not us.
[01:56:56.569 --> 01:56:58.670]  And I said, and we'll be able to get our stuff out of here, right?
[01:56:58.689 --> 01:57:00.949]  He goes, yeah, you know, you're nice and everything, you know.
[01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:03.810]  Oh, we're like, I'm nice, huh?
[01:57:04.949 --> 01:57:06.170]  I said, are you being nice, Chris?
[01:57:06.369 --> 01:57:08.430]  You think shitting on me and rubbing it in is really nice?
[01:57:11.449 --> 01:57:12.729]  And I said, sure.
[01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:19.550]  So I'm going over there this afternoon to get some of my pictures of my family and the final stuff out of my office.
[01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:23.710]  And if I get over there and I'm locked in a building, I'm calling the police.
[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:27.500]  So that's where we're at.
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:33.899]  And then I'm going to come on the air and I'm going to tell my listeners to come down there peacefully.
[01:57:34.239 --> 01:57:37.439]  And we're going to get 10,000 people there by tomorrow.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.680]  And we'll make this big show.
[01:57:39.819 --> 01:57:40.399]  You're looking for one.
[01:57:40.979 --> 01:57:44.800]  Because see, I don't ever start it.
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:48.520]  But what I do do is finish it.
[01:57:50.159 --> 01:57:58.189]  So I have seen nothing but a giant Open season on Alex Jones and his family and crew.
[01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.590]  Lies.
[01:57:59.729 --> 01:58:00.689]  I mean, everybody remembers the headlines.
[01:58:00.829 --> 01:58:02.050]  We could pull up a thousand of them, literally.
[01:58:03.369 --> 01:58:04.789]  Alex Jones is a criminal.
[01:58:05.029 --> 01:58:06.609]  He has hundreds of millions hidden.
[01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:08.310]  He stole it from the Sandy Hook people.
[01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:09.010]  What the hell?
[01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:10.090]  Never made one nickel off this.
[01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:11.310]  They barely even talked about him.
[01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:12.350]  It's like 12 years ago.
[01:58:15.170 --> 01:58:19.569]  And he's going to jail when they find out the money he's got hidden.
[01:58:19.710 --> 01:58:21.130]  They sue my parents, everybody.
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:26.079]  Had the IRS audits, $4.3 million tax return.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.060]  I've shown the check on air.
[01:58:29.399 --> 01:58:30.340]  I'm already in bankruptcy.
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.680]  It goes right into that thing.
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:38.640]  Because I get top accounting firms respected, and they say, yeah, you're such a target.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:40.460]  We recommend you don't even take these exemptions.
[01:58:41.909 --> 01:58:45.050]  But it was so overpaid in that five years they audited us on.
[01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:46.750]  $4.3 million.
[01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:49.229]  Boy, that sounds like a crook to me, man.
[01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:50.930]  They say, yeah, this is pretty rare.
[01:58:50.949 --> 01:58:51.909]  We don't usually do this.
[01:58:52.029 --> 01:58:54.729]  But that was that agency actually with those people.
[01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:56.470]  Okay, well, we audited you.
[01:58:56.649 --> 01:58:58.609]  In the office over and over again for a year.
[01:58:58.810 --> 01:58:59.949]  Up my ass.
[01:59:01.059 --> 01:59:06.520]  Justice Department lawyers in depositions interrogating me that if I say one thing wrong, I'm going to prison holding U.S. code up to me.
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.079]  I'm just like, I don't touch the money.
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:09.220]  I got these accounting firms.
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:11.699]  I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:12.399]  I don't have $10 million.
[01:59:12.899 --> 01:59:23.720]  I mean, by the time they had the first show trial, two years ago in Austin, was in October, and the second one was in November in Connecticut, I had a $3.5 million of legal bills.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:28.460]  I'd sold my house that I bought a nice house as an investment, so I already had that back up.
[01:59:29.490 --> 01:59:33.270]  Sold that, already owed that much money to lawyers for the last six months or more.
[01:59:33.529 --> 01:59:34.310]  That was really intense.
[01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:36.050]  And I was negative.
[01:59:36.949 --> 01:59:38.010]  And they're up on the stand.
[01:59:38.109 --> 01:59:39.649]  He's got hundreds of millions, blah, blah, blah.
[01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:41.329]  Hadn't seen our books, totally made up.
[01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:44.869]  I say to the judge, I go, listen, I'm out of money, your honor.
[01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.829]  This isn't true.
[01:59:45.949 --> 01:59:46.590]  She goes, shut up!
[01:59:46.890 --> 01:59:49.770]  You may say you know reality, you claim, but that's a lie.
[01:59:49.890 --> 01:59:51.010]  You got a lot of money.
[01:59:51.789 --> 01:59:53.729]  Because she pulled it out of her butt.
[01:59:55.869 --> 01:59:58.890]  And I told everybody, I said, you're discredited by this.
[01:59:59.329 --> 02:00:00.329]  This is a lie.
[02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:01.409]  I'm negative money.
[02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:09.670]  And then finally, all the outside audits, all the outside groups, and the New York Times said, turns out he had meager assets, never had a bunch of money.
[02:00:10.569 --> 02:00:11.390]  They knew that.
[02:00:11.989 --> 02:00:18.789]  They wanted to say I had all this money so you wouldn't think when I was asking for money to stay on the air and do our critical work so you wouldn't believe it.
[02:00:20.359 --> 02:00:24.159]  And they got on the courthouse steps after their second fake rig trial and said, don't send him money.
[02:00:24.319 --> 02:00:25.579]  Whatever you do, he's going down.
[02:00:25.739 --> 02:00:27.039]  I thought they wanted money.
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:28.520]  I thought everywhere I need to pay them.
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:34.399]  If you have any logic, you know it's ridiculous and a fraud on its face.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.199]  So here's the deal.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:37.020]  We're a canary in the coal mine.
[02:00:37.119 --> 02:00:38.439]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:00:38.659 --> 02:00:39.819]  They're not giving up.
[02:00:40.279 --> 02:00:44.420]  They raided Polymarket because it accurately predicted from the betting market Trump was going to win.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:46.319]  I said that over and over again in the landslide.
[02:00:47.199 --> 02:00:52.119]  We called it before anybody in the media to tens of millions watching election night in that morning.
[02:00:52.119 --> 02:00:53.899]  We called it at 10.30 at night.
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:58.020]  It wasn't officially called till 1.30 Eastern or whatever.
[02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:01.649]  Are we going to get rated because we're smart?
[02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:12.890]  Because we can look at Pennsylvania and Georgia and other states where 95% were reporting and how many votes were left and Trump was getting the majority of them.
[02:01:12.989 --> 02:01:16.250]  So unless they totally stole those last ones, he was going to win.
[02:01:16.449 --> 02:01:18.029]  And so we called it for him.
[02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:22.270]  Unlike Fox that called Arizona four years ago, lied to you.
[02:01:22.770 --> 02:01:23.670]  We called it.
[02:01:23.729 --> 02:01:25.109]  See, they don't like us controlling the narrative.
[02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:28.050]  They don't like us just waiting for CNN to tell us.
[02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:29.590]  That's why they want me off the air.
[02:01:29.729 --> 02:01:33.130]  That's why it's come out in Pentagon reports and CIA reports, congressional hearings.
[02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:35.430]  We want Alex Jones off because he creates narratives.
[02:01:36.289 --> 02:01:37.810]  And what narratives do I create?
[02:01:38.449 --> 02:01:40.130]  Narratives that I believe are right.
[02:01:40.590 --> 02:01:41.789]  Narratives that I believe are true.
[02:01:41.909 --> 02:01:42.710]  I said first...
[02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:55.390]  In the morning after Smollett said at 2.30 he goes out to a subway at 22 below in Chicago and men dump bleach on him, put a noose around his neck, beat him up and say this is MAGA country.
[02:01:55.909 --> 02:01:57.489]  I said, I don't believe that.
[02:01:57.489 --> 02:01:58.770]  I bet that's a false flag.
[02:01:58.770 --> 02:01:59.550]  I bet that's staged.
[02:01:59.689 --> 02:02:00.869]  I didn't say I knew that.
[02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:02.829]  Of course, I was dead on.
[02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:06.350]  Do I get sued for that, my opinion?
[02:02:06.789 --> 02:02:11.010]  Or the internet not believing a mass shooting happened because it was so political and the weird stuff going on?
[02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:14.390]  And I look at it, do a few shows, yeah, looks like, you know, could be to me.
[02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:15.189]  They do that all the time.
[02:02:16.779 --> 02:02:29.500]  Then years later, Trump wins, dredge it up with PR firms, the FBI, everywhere I'm attacking families, talking about them, making money off them, oh, I'm famous because of them, attach themselves to me, do all these fundraisers off me, and then sue me after I'm taken off the internet?
[02:02:29.579 --> 02:02:31.640]  I wasn't banned off the internet.
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:32.300]  Look it up.
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.819]  For Sandy Hook, I wasn't even talked about in that.
[02:02:35.829 --> 02:02:36.989]  Everybody's like, why was he taking off?
[02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:39.090]  Oh, it's rude to Oliver Darcy's the reason.
[02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:41.029]  And I finally got to Elon Musk.
[02:02:41.329 --> 02:02:42.069]  Tucker Carlson did.
[02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:43.390]  I'm going to leave behind the scenes stuff.
[02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:44.329]  And Mr.
[02:02:44.369 --> 02:02:45.649]  Musk says, is it really?
[02:02:45.729 --> 02:02:46.869]  And we also had a two and a half hour interview.
[02:02:47.029 --> 02:02:51.210]  One of those that you saw later, he came home with me for two and a half hours last year.
[02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:52.909]  And I'll go to Harrison.
[02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:58.850]  And then Musk said, you're saying you weren't banned for San Diego.
[02:02:59.069 --> 02:03:00.189]  He goes, that's what they tell me.
[02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:03.069]  And we said, don't you have the logs?
[02:03:03.289 --> 02:03:04.090]  Don't you have the record?
[02:03:04.369 --> 02:03:15.170]  I said, on Joe Rogan a few years ago, their head lawyer went on with Jack Dorsey and said I was banned from being rude to Oliver Darcy, the CNN mini-me of Brian Stelter, their media analyst.
[02:03:15.449 --> 02:03:18.149]  And he was in line at a congressional hearing about me.
[02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:19.829]  They're talking about me.
[02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:21.869]  And he was going into it.
[02:03:21.909 --> 02:03:24.550]  And I said, how dare you go and take my sponsor, try to take me off the air.
[02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:26.609]  But I'd already been taken off everything else.
[02:03:26.909 --> 02:03:28.670]  And they said, I bullied someone.
[02:03:30.449 --> 02:03:33.470]  In fact, find that thing off YouTuber X, Alex Jones, Oliver Darson.
[02:03:33.689 --> 02:03:34.430]  I want to play that.
[02:03:35.010 --> 02:03:35.829]  Coming up next hour.
[02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:37.829]  Steve Bannon and everything else coming up.
[02:03:39.029 --> 02:03:41.569]  And Elon Musk went, oh my God.
[02:03:41.670 --> 02:03:44.670]  He went to the logs right there and went, oh my God.
[02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:47.350]  And then he went and checked.
[02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:52.130]  And like a week later, I get the call.
[02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:54.050]  I'm not going to say who.
[02:03:54.170 --> 02:03:55.649]  And they go, yeah, get ready.
[02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:57.010]  You're back on X. A couple weeks.
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:04.899]  So, you understand, I wasn't taking off anything for that because I wasn't known for that.
[02:04:07.039 --> 02:04:11.180]  They entered in evidence when I was already found guilty, but the show trial, 22 minutes.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:18.840]  And the best they had was me watching a CNN clip off the internet that had like 100 million views that someone else uploaded of a parent laughing.
[02:04:19.399 --> 02:04:21.439]  And they see the camera and they go, they're crying.
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:24.220]  And I said, yeah, that looks like acting to me, but I don't know.
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.899]  And it's like, oh my God, $1.5 billion.
[02:04:27.319 --> 02:04:29.239]  That's the one person's name I said.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.180]  Under federal and state law, you can't do defamation of someone if you haven't said their name.
[02:04:34.539 --> 02:04:37.060]  The statute of limitations was over if I'd done something.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.520]  But it was about trampling my rights.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:41.460]  And now they say I don't have a 13th Amendment.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:42.140]  They own my name.
[02:04:42.659 --> 02:04:45.659]  Now they say they can shut me down in a fake bidding process.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:47.659]  Now they do all this stuff.
[02:04:48.539 --> 02:04:52.140]  And we have to stop laying down to it and stop going along with it.
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.720]  I didn't leave InfoWars because they were in the right.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:56.359]  I left because they were turning the power off.
[02:04:56.479 --> 02:04:57.079]  And they did.
[02:04:58.199 --> 02:04:59.140]  Turned it all off.
[02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:03.260]  What am I supposed to do, physically sit there and let them make me the villain?
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:04.699]  I said, what you're doing is wrong.
[02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:06.699]  I'm already filed in court.
[02:05:07.079 --> 02:05:07.960]  You know that.
[02:05:08.239 --> 02:05:09.119]  Emergency motion.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:12.979]  And then I talked to the lawyers, and they're like, oh, my God.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.039]  This is ridiculous.
[02:05:16.319 --> 02:05:22.539]  I mean, again, have you ever heard of an auction that's not public and the highest bidder doesn't win?
[02:05:22.899 --> 02:05:23.260]  Crickets?
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:29.439]  You ever heard of a public auction set by a federal court for two months and then two days before?
[02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:34.510]  A day and a half before, they just say, oh, now it's all secret and the lower person can win.
[02:05:34.689 --> 02:05:36.789]  I was like, the lower person's going to win.
[02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:40.470]  They've already decided no matter what's put in.
[02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:41.949]  And I told everybody that.
[02:05:46.109 --> 02:06:00.220]  So, if there's any justice left, and if Judge Chris Lopez actually looks at this and actually does the right thing, which he finally did, but they tried to hijack it in late May, With no court order.
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:00.840]  And he said, what the hell?
[02:06:00.859 --> 02:06:02.119]  You tried to shut it down without...
[02:06:02.119 --> 02:06:02.859]  Well, what are you doing?
[02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:05.039]  That'll hurt the value of the company and the stuff.
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:06.819]  You know, he's trying to sell it to pay the creditors.
[02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.399]  Like, we don't want money, Judge, in the court.
[02:06:08.579 --> 02:06:09.619]  We want him shut down right now.
[02:06:09.699 --> 02:06:11.100]  Give us his websites.
[02:06:11.239 --> 02:06:11.859]  Give us his name.
[02:06:12.439 --> 02:06:13.300]  He goes, that's it.
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:16.140]  The federal trustee and the CRO were fired.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:19.319]  And then they came back later a few weeks ago and said, we want his names again.
[02:06:19.359 --> 02:06:20.659]  And he said, no, you can't have those.
[02:06:20.819 --> 02:06:21.760]  That's not up for sale.
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.140]  They'd have real Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:26.439]  They'd be suing right now saying, I can't say I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:27.500]  They literally said that.
[02:06:28.529 --> 02:06:30.210]  There's no links they won't go to.
[02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:35.050]  BlackRock funds all over the world teaching five-year-olds boys they're a girl.
[02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:38.130]  Drag Queen Storytime is funded by BlackRock.
[02:06:38.649 --> 02:06:42.949]  Larry Fink says he will control your behavior with an ESG, global credit score, on your phone.
[02:06:43.770 --> 02:06:45.069]  That China already has.
[02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:46.289]  The chains are going on.
[02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:47.949]  They're coming back with new pandemics.
[02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:48.869]  More forced injections.
[02:06:49.090 --> 02:06:50.409]  They're pissed we exposed all that.
[02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:52.369]  They want to cook up another pandemic.
[02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:56.069]  They don't want us on air when they try to launch their next disease X. But we'll be on the air.
[02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:57.409]  No matter what happens to me.
[02:06:58.979 --> 02:07:00.699]  What I've warned about only gets stronger.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.279]  You own what I said.
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:04.220]  It's a gift to you.
[02:07:04.319 --> 02:07:05.920]  They can't stop you from taking it.
[02:07:06.079 --> 02:07:12.659]  But you already know how it works, and you're all Alex Jones, and you're all Infowars, and Infowars is an idea that just got stronger today.
[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:24.989]  100% studying history, the Hegelian dialectic, reality, human nature, street smarts, 15 hours a day, fully immersed in the fight for liberty, 30-plus years on air.
[02:07:25.229 --> 02:07:36.489]  I know what I'm talking about, and when I tell you that this shows their total desperation, And that if you understand what this is and you take action, this is another major Waterloo for them, and I salute you all.
[02:07:36.630 --> 02:07:40.890]  But they're going to come after us with everything they've got legally, and you don't want them to win.
[02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:51.829]  So go now to fightforalex.com, make a legal donation, and go to thealexjonesstore.com and get great t-shirts, supplements, limited edition posters that fund the info war, all at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:56.739]  You are fighting for your own future and your very existence.
[02:07:56.739 --> 02:08:01.500]  Your entire future hangs in the balance with Trump being successful and us being successful.
[02:08:01.659 --> 02:08:06.859]  The enemy sees us as the main information fulcrum of the resistance because we are.
[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:09.279]  Because we've got their number.
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:11.319]  All right, Harrison Smith.
[02:08:12.449 --> 02:08:17.430]  You can be here with us in the studio, but this is the small little pocket studio, the bigger one's almost done, where we can do the bigger interviews.
[02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:20.550]  We could have you here, but you're from your home studio, just showing our redundancy.
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:23.029]  By the way, you and Owen, everybody, welcome.
[02:08:23.130 --> 02:08:23.789]  We do the shows every day.
[02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:24.970]  I already told you, restream it there.
[02:08:26.449 --> 02:08:28.890]  We're getting more radio stations as we speak.
[02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:30.630]  Very, very exciting.
[02:08:31.909 --> 02:08:34.109]  Harrison Smith, what is your take on what we just witnessed?
[02:08:36.210 --> 02:08:38.729]  I'm fired up now that you're talking about it.
[02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:40.850]  What is there even to say?
[02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:42.750]  It's crazy that this has finally arrived.
[02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:46.649]  It's insane just personally finding ourselves in this.
[02:08:46.829 --> 02:08:51.069]  It felt like the Alamo this morning, honestly, you know, there in the building.
[02:08:51.170 --> 02:08:52.369]  And in a way it was.
[02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:56.109]  It was a loss that will lead to a greater victory, right?
[02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:57.010]  That's what the Alamo was.
[02:08:57.949 --> 02:08:59.770]  It was an information Alamo.
[02:08:59.949 --> 02:09:01.189]  It was an information Alamo.
[02:09:02.449 --> 02:09:04.489]  And look, they literally pulled the plug today.
[02:09:04.689 --> 02:09:05.829]  Like, no joke.
[02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:17.069]  And, you know, for so long, it's been such a whiplash, rollercoaster sort of thing we've been on where, you know, they say they're shutting us down and we get all, you know, anxious about that.
[02:09:17.069 --> 02:09:18.710]  And then they say, okay, actually, you got a little while.
[02:09:18.829 --> 02:09:19.930]  And then they say, actually, you're fine.
[02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:20.890]  And then they try to shut us down.
[02:09:20.970 --> 02:09:23.310]  So it's been so chaotic and wild.
[02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:26.789]  And that's only because we beat all the attempts.
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:28.899]  Right, right.
[02:09:29.079 --> 02:09:32.380]  Well, and, you know, yesterday when we said – because it happened to us yesterday, right?
[02:09:32.439 --> 02:09:33.159]  It was like today's the day.
[02:09:33.199 --> 02:09:33.640]  It's the auction.
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:34.340]  We find out.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:39.619]  I'm watching the show all day until the end of, you know, War Room just waiting for the announcement to be made.
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:41.779]  They say it'll be tomorrow morning.
[02:09:41.939 --> 02:09:48.220]  Somebody says something about that on Twitter, and I saw a response to that that was like, again with the delay, you guys are so dramatic.
[02:09:48.439 --> 02:09:49.260]  And it's like, dramatic?
[02:09:49.579 --> 02:09:53.020]  Like you said, they're already making Hollywood movies out of this.
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:56.380]  They've already made blockbuster documentaries about what's going on here.
[02:09:56.539 --> 02:09:59.260]  This is dramatic, and we aren't playing it up.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:00.960]  We aren't dramatizing it.
[02:10:01.079 --> 02:10:04.659]  We aren't having to add, if anything, we really aren't taking it seriously enough.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:07.340]  I mean, the show yesterday, as much as it was...
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:23.539]  I think?
[02:10:27.199 --> 02:10:28.819]  Like, 300 is dramatic.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:35.539]  We are in a dramatic war for human liberty at this point, on, by the way, the cusp of our greatest victory ever.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:50.899]  I genuinely believe that the success that we saw in the election, not just getting Trump elected, but every county in America, more or less, moving to the right, every state moving to the right, a total full sweep election victory with Congress, Senate,
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:51.840]  and the presidency.
[02:10:52.319 --> 02:10:55.920]  I mean, this is not just vindication for Trump, which it obviously is.
[02:10:56.079 --> 02:11:01.420]  This is the result of what really I think you began or really the torch that you picked up, right?
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.960]  Because there are people that came before you that paved the way for you.
[02:11:04.079 --> 02:11:06.119]  Then you came along and paved the way for other people.
[02:11:06.239 --> 02:11:18.340]  And now this seed pod of Infowars has germinated and has grown a garden of resistance activists and reporters and just unbelievable people across the country.
[02:11:19.450 --> 02:11:21.609]  We have achieved victory electorally.
[02:11:21.789 --> 02:11:22.930]  Now the real fight is on.
[02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:23.630]  We've known this.
[02:11:23.710 --> 02:11:39.770]  We talked about this, and it seemed a little too coincidental, the timing of this, that right on the cusp, right at the moment of victory, right when things are about to get very dangerous, right when they're about to start launching PSYOPs, and God only knows, world war, false flags, new diseases,
[02:11:39.789 --> 02:11:43.149]  of course they want Infowars off the air.
[02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:44.649]  And I mean, I could go on and on, Alex.
[02:11:44.729 --> 02:11:56.600]  I mean, if you want to talk about Just what you were going through, the way that they used Sandy Hook, in my opinion, in my personal opinion, totally cynically, it had nothing to do with why they wanted to sue you.
[02:11:56.739 --> 02:12:00.279]  And actually, you know, it's not even really my opinion because they said it.
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:01.180]  You've seen the videos.
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:03.319]  And they said, we want him shut down.
[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:04.659]  We want him taken down.
[02:12:04.739 --> 02:12:11.439]  And they had people come in, experts come in and testify it was because of the influence that you had and that Infowars had in 2016.
[02:12:12.039 --> 02:12:12.579]  That's right.
[02:12:12.579 --> 02:12:13.380]  Stay right there.
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:14.180]  Stay right there.
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:14.840]  Stay there.
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:15.359]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:18.289 --> 02:12:23.210]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:27.770]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[02:12:27.970 --> 02:12:30.590]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:31.489]  I'm still not in shape.
[02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:33.789]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[02:12:33.909 --> 02:12:34.869]  Don't tell me eating right.
[02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:35.569]  I'm not gonna buy that.
[02:12:36.439 --> 02:12:39.220]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[02:12:40.079 --> 02:12:41.060]  Oh, no.
[02:12:42.279 --> 02:12:43.920]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:50.039]  I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:50.979]  That's why, right here.
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:56.819]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.600]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:12:59.119 --> 02:13:00.539]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:13:03.289 --> 02:13:07.210]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[02:13:07.329 --> 02:13:10.510]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:13.970]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[02:13:14.010 --> 02:13:17.310]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.

[02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.930]  All right, folks.
[02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:41.710]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide from the Alex Jones Network studios that the bad guys, the globalists, said they don't want you to be able to hear.
[02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:46.590]  And so I'm extremely honored and blessed to be here with you.
[02:14:47.369 --> 02:14:49.430]  Harrison Smith is here with us.
[02:14:49.810 --> 02:14:54.390]  Harrison, we can talk a little bit more about Infowars, and I'll get some updates.
[02:14:55.750 --> 02:15:02.590]  You and Owen are welcome to come in here, coming up whenever, and just take over tonight.
[02:15:03.239 --> 02:15:04.119]  And continue on.
[02:15:04.399 --> 02:15:06.039]  I'm going to come back as I know more.
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:11.739]  We'll just keep these streams going continually at Real Alex Jones and at AJN Live.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.920]  The new network everybody should follow and people are following and tell everybody else you know to follow it, folks.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.399]  Get a chain reaction going, which is happening.
[02:15:18.479 --> 02:15:19.880]  And I've got some updates.
[02:15:20.079 --> 02:15:22.699]  I'm going to get on the phone here some and get on this.
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:24.920]  But this is crazy and this isn't over yet.
[02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:31.210]  I mean, hands down what they did is not what you're supposed to do and looks really bad.
[02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:32.050]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:34.829]  And they just think they're part of the establishment so they can do it.
[02:15:35.649 --> 02:15:47.710]  But we'll see what Judge Lopez does on this because the way this went down and the people that put real bids in, I mean, passed over for less money and the rest of it is just preposterous in my view.
[02:15:47.789 --> 02:15:48.810]  And no one's going to buy that.
[02:15:48.930 --> 02:15:51.050]  Everybody knows that auctions for the biggest bidder.
[02:15:51.579 --> 02:15:57.060]  Everybody knows you don't change a day and a half before and say now it's all secret, no longer public online.
[02:15:57.699 --> 02:15:58.859]  I mean, I knew then.
[02:15:58.859 --> 02:15:59.859]  I told you guys.
[02:15:59.859 --> 02:16:00.779]  I told the crew.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.140]  I told everybody.
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:04.560]  And at some point, we'll do a roundtable.
[02:16:04.659 --> 02:16:06.659]  I mean, this is not hard.
[02:16:07.279 --> 02:16:15.279]  And part of beating corruption and evil is knowing what it is, getting inside its head, and realizing what its next moves are, and you've got to think like they do.
[02:16:15.859 --> 02:16:17.399]  And, you know, it's disgusting.
[02:16:17.399 --> 02:16:18.279]  It's hard to believe.
[02:16:18.939 --> 02:16:21.359]  But this is why our country's in so much trouble.
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:22.539]  But Harrison, you're making some points.
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:30.760]  Without getting into all the lawfare, they just pick something, and they use that as it, and then they go out in the media and create this narrative that you didn't do.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:34.739]  Then they have rigged trials, just like with Trump, you know, grabbing the lady by the whatever.
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:35.420]  No, that was true.
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.059]  It's all come out.
[02:16:36.459 --> 02:16:38.159]  And it just doesn't work anymore.
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:43.579]  This is our mugshot moment, just like the Trump mugshot blew up their face, I think, of everything, and them trying to kill him.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:45.840]  I mean, this is InfoWars.
[02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:46.760]  This is mine.
[02:16:46.899 --> 02:16:47.340]  This is your...
[02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:49.809]  A Butler, Pennsylvania moment.
[02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:56.409]  I'm not comparing to the magnitude of that and him surviving in 555, but, I mean, informationally, this is a big deal, the way they went about it.
[02:16:57.690 --> 02:16:58.370]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:58.549 --> 02:17:02.750]  And, you know, even more than, you know, the case you were just talking about, what about the Russia collusion case?
[02:17:02.829 --> 02:17:04.110]  This is what it reminds me of, right?
[02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:09.729]  There has never been a claim more thoroughly debunked than Russian collusion, right?
[02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:16.930]  They spent two years, billions of dollars, a team of 80 high-paid lawyers every day, all day, looking into it, and they came up with...
[02:17:17.139 --> 02:17:17.920]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:19.440]  Well, we've kind of been through the same thing.
[02:17:19.579 --> 02:17:21.079]  They've gone through all the financials.
[02:17:21.159 --> 02:17:22.479]  They've gotten access to all the files.
[02:17:22.639 --> 02:17:33.899]  I mean, through this lawsuit, all of these lawsuits, they have been able to tear Infowars apart, look at it from every single angle, and really what it's proven is we're the real deal.
[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:35.780]  We're absolutely the real deal.
[02:17:35.899 --> 02:17:51.280]  And when it comes to – when I started tuning in just now, you were talking about just how them claiming that you have so much money – I just always want to point out that Brian Stelter and Don Lemon, who now cannot get triple digits on live streams,
[02:17:51.399 --> 02:17:52.459]  that's how unpopular they are.
[02:17:52.559 --> 02:17:55.739]  Without the brand of CNN, nobody pays attention to them.
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:56.500]  Nobody likes them.
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:01.459]  They were being paid $12 to $15 million a year to read off a teleprompter.
[02:18:01.559 --> 02:18:10.750]  So I just want to put into context the work that you've done, the company that you've built, And for you to, you know, put it all back in the company, like, all of that has been proven.
[02:18:10.909 --> 02:18:17.549]  All of the doubters, all of the naysayers, all the people claiming things about InfoWars have all been proven wrong by this lawsuit.
[02:18:17.649 --> 02:18:19.469]  So can we drop the claims now?
[02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:24.780]  Like, finally, can the naysayers and the backbiters and the slanderers, can you— Can you give us some credit?
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:28.299]  They have proven that we are the real deal by shutting us down.
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:31.920]  And why it's important where the real deal is, the real thing exists all over the place.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.360]  They want you to believe it doesn't exist.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:35.139]  The globalists are the bad guys.
[02:18:35.319 --> 02:18:37.459]  They're the liars, and we've been fighting for everybody.
[02:18:37.459 --> 02:18:40.719]  We're fighting together, and we are the people's champion.
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.319]  The globalists see us as that because that's what we are.
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:50.340]  And remember in court in the Connecticut rig case, the former federal prosecutor who especially is putting innocent Republicans like the governor in prison for nothing...
[02:18:51.250 --> 02:18:53.389]  He said, so what'd you do with the Bitcoin $9 million donation?
[02:18:53.969 --> 02:18:55.649]  And I went, I put it in the company.
[02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:57.290]  He goes, okay, the Justice Department's going to be interested in that.
[02:18:57.350 --> 02:18:57.930]  We don't believe that.
[02:18:58.389 --> 02:19:00.290]  And I said, okay, well, believe whatever you want.
[02:19:00.370 --> 02:19:01.930]  Of course, once they got the audit, it was all true.
[02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:04.370]  It was, I could have kept it.
[02:19:04.409 --> 02:19:05.110]  It was given to me.
[02:19:05.489 --> 02:19:07.170]  But see, they couldn't think like that.
[02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:08.370]  It was a pleasure.
[02:19:08.510 --> 02:19:11.770]  It was the exact money we needed over those three years of shortfalls to stay on air.
[02:19:11.930 --> 02:19:13.489]  It was not a burden.
[02:19:13.670 --> 02:19:15.530]  It was a pleasure.
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:18.040]  Pleasure getting Trump in.
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:19.360]  Pleasure defeating you.
[02:19:19.579 --> 02:19:20.299]  And I've just begun.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.020]  Stay there, Harrison.
[02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:21.860]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:40.610]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[02:19:40.930 --> 02:19:42.110]  And we've come out with it.
[02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:47.409]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[02:19:47.489 --> 02:19:49.090]  But I personally like this one.
[02:19:49.690 --> 02:19:54.350]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the Infowar and supports President Trump.
[02:19:54.770 --> 02:19:57.409]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.
[02:19:57.790 --> 02:20:07.649]  So get yours right now and a bunch of other great designs of hoodies and t-shirts and top of the line supplements that all fund the second American Revolution at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:20:07.729 --> 02:20:08.590]  Let me show you a few more of these.
[02:20:08.770 --> 02:20:17.790]  Now that the FDA admits fluoride does lower your IQ and give you cancer and infertility, it's a great time to wear one of these beautiful hats and it's a great way to start a conversation and warn people.
[02:20:18.069 --> 02:20:26.309]  Here's the classic Make America Great Again Murdered Out, and we've got the Save the Frogs, over 50 designs, all at thealexjonesstore.com, and it keeps us on air, and it spreads the word.
[02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:28.829]  Please go to alexjonesstore.com and get your...
[02:20:28.829 --> 02:20:39.809]  When government fears the people, liberty thrives.
[02:20:39.909 --> 02:20:45.870]  And now, for the man the globalists fear most, it's Alex Jones Live on the Alex Jones Network.
[02:20:53.729 --> 02:20:58.270]  So I was already a populist freedom fighter.
[02:20:59.069 --> 02:21:03.850]  The globalists knew that the public, the grassroots, saw me as a folk legend.
[02:21:03.969 --> 02:21:04.629]  I'm not bragging.
[02:21:04.690 --> 02:21:05.229]  It's just a fact.
[02:21:05.370 --> 02:21:06.909]  They said that 10 years ago.
[02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:08.430]  They knew we had giant audiences in.
[02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:10.409]  And so they set about to make me a devil.
[02:21:10.569 --> 02:21:11.530]  We made it through that.
[02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:11.989]  It didn't work.
[02:21:12.819 --> 02:21:14.239]  Then they set about to try to put me in prison.
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:16.700]  We were totally clean, so they had big problems.
[02:21:16.899 --> 02:21:17.780]  Bunch of grand juries.
[02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:18.780]  They tried to get to indict me.
[02:21:18.879 --> 02:21:20.000]  It didn't work, by the grace of God.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:23.340]  And it's not like I'm John Gotti that beat a bunch of stuff and would shake his fist.
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:24.040]  He didn't get me.
[02:21:24.159 --> 02:21:26.260]  I mean, I'm a freaking Boy Scout.
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.600]  And, I mean...
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:29.879]  They know that.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.299]  Everybody knows it's all about family.
[02:21:31.420 --> 02:21:34.860]  My family, going back, and just like yours, Harrison, solved the earth.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:42.559]  On my mother's side, founded Texas, washed it on the Brazos, wrote it all, launched it with Colonel Travis, raised Colonel Travis' son.
[02:21:42.799 --> 02:21:46.059]  My dad's side, same nine yards, same deal.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:48.239]  Let's punch up Harrison's screen here.
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:51.420]  I mean, I come from really good people.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:52.579]  Punch up Harrison's screen, please.
[02:21:53.659 --> 02:21:54.600]  See if we can do that.
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:55.840]  Maybe not.
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:57.959]  Maybe just go full screen with Harrison, guys.
[02:22:00.219 --> 02:22:01.979]  But that's what this is all about.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:05.280]  And there are good people in the world.
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:07.680]  And the globalists don't like that.
[02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:12.940]  So the idea that I'm a crook and I'm a slime and I'm all these evil things, people don't buy it.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:29.639]  And then now they have to come in here with a secret bid and give it to somebody for a lower amount and then run around celebrating it and jerk down the website today And turn the equipment off, even after I'd left, because I knew they were doing it.
[02:22:31.319 --> 02:22:35.299]  And then imagine how pissed off they are right now that you're at Real Alex Jones sharing the live feed, folks.
[02:22:35.579 --> 02:22:39.100]  Imagine how upset they are that you're following at AJN Live, the new network.
[02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:44.559]  Imagine how upset they are going to the AlexJonesStore.com and getting great products while you help keep us on air and explode in their face.
[02:22:44.959 --> 02:22:50.459]  Imagine how upset the system is that we are winning and Trump is in and all this is happening.
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:52.200]  So Harrison, finish up on your points.
[02:22:52.239 --> 02:22:53.360]  I want to get into news now.
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:58.000]  And I'm going to cover the big topics, the appointments, where it's going.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:22:59.799]  Some good, some bad.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.200]  But Matt Gaetz for the Attorney General, incredible.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:11.399]  Guys, get the Fetterman clip of him talking about God-tier, I love that term, God-tier trolling.
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:14.239]  No, I sent that clip, but I don't see it here.
[02:23:14.479 --> 02:23:16.440]  I mean, just so much going on.
[02:23:16.559 --> 02:23:19.700]  Rogan talking about Trump being a champion of free speech.
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:21.479]  I mean, there's so much to get to.
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:23.440]  And this will be the regular show, folks.
[02:23:23.579 --> 02:23:24.639]  The guests, all of it.
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:26.719]  When guests come, we just go in the other bigger studio.
[02:23:26.719 --> 02:23:27.879]  This is more of the news studio.
[02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.860]  And this is just the...
[02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:32.469]  Escape pod.
[02:23:34.569 --> 02:23:36.930]  To get me off the air, they're going to have an internet kill switch.
[02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:39.370]  They're going to have to shut you up.
[02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:41.489]  And they may try that.
[02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:44.309]  So this is all going on.
[02:23:44.409 --> 02:23:46.209]  We'll get to the Fetterman a little bit later, but we do have that now.
[02:23:47.569 --> 02:24:11.379]  Harrison, finish up with M4s, what it was like this morning, what was going on, and then how crazy is it as we leave the studio and then Somehow, the feeds get killed, which are on X. So that's someone communicating with X to do that.
[02:24:11.559 --> 02:24:12.420]  Now, we're back up there.
[02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:13.459]  I mean, this is wild.
[02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:18.219]  They acted like if they got me and got us, they win, and Trump goes away.
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:22.000]  They've sent the Terminator back in time to get John Connor.
[02:24:22.579 --> 02:24:25.200]  Don't they understand the Streisand effect, Harrison?
[02:24:26.209 --> 02:24:29.090]  You know, I really think they drink their own Kool-Aid.
[02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:30.389]  I think they buy their own lies.
[02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:33.930]  I think they convince themselves that you are just some big glute.
[02:24:34.069 --> 02:24:37.389]  You're some big redneck idiot that they could steamroll over in the court.
[02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:43.430]  They didn't realize that, no, you're actually dealing with a pretty sophisticated operation here, and we can contend with you on your own ground.
[02:24:43.709 --> 02:24:54.430]  They drink their own Kool-Aid in the same way that they now have painted you as the Sandy Hook guy in total flagrant We're good to go.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.899]  So they have this caricature of us that is just totally different than who we are.
[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:16.219]  If you've watched Infowars the last five months, it's been politics, election, assassination.
[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:23.260]  It's been – I mean you broke the news yesterday of Tulsi Gabbard being selected by Donald Trump with Roger Stone on air.
[02:25:23.399 --> 02:25:40.450]  So they take this organization, this news organization that is about activism and political activity and just deep analysis of things going on, culture, health, all this stuff – I mean,
[02:25:40.729 --> 02:25:50.829]  we are about to see InfoWars, the InfoWars brand, the captured, you know, flagship of InfoWars.
[02:25:51.149 --> 02:25:55.170]  I give it about two months, because that's probably how long The Onion has to go, too.
[02:25:55.389 --> 02:25:58.510]  You know, The Onion has been sold twice in the last five years.
[02:25:58.729 --> 02:25:59.690]  They fail continuously.
[02:25:59.690 --> 02:26:05.049]  So when people, like, really want to think about what's happening at Infowars, what has happened now at Infowars...
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:16.479]  Every other media, every mainstream media outlet, every, you know, the left-wing version of Infowars, the far-left, alternative-left media, Vice News, all these, they have all failed.
[02:26:16.659 --> 02:26:17.479]  They are all failing.
[02:26:17.799 --> 02:26:19.739]  MSNBC going up for auction because of low ratings.
[02:26:19.899 --> 02:26:23.819]  CNN firing, like, hundreds of people because their ratings are so low.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:24.600]  The Onion.
[02:26:24.899 --> 02:26:28.379]  I forgot The Onion existed until this morning, you know?
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:29.340]  It's like, where is it?
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:30.260]  Nobody cares about it.
[02:26:30.319 --> 02:26:31.399]  Nobody links it.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:34.079]  And they think people coming to that landing page now...
[02:26:34.690 --> 02:26:37.270]  Are going to think that's us, and they're going to confuse it.
[02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:39.229]  See, that's deliberate with Bigfoot and all that.
[02:26:39.610 --> 02:26:43.969]  Look, before I got on air, stations would only let people on.
[02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:51.649]  I'm talking about the Federal Reserve and the New World Order if you mixed in Bigfoot and space aliens and chupacabras, which is fine, but people always ask, why don't you cover that?
[02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:59.709]  Because I'm covering Rex 84, and I'm covering the Kennedy assassination, and I'm covering serious issues with serious guests, and...
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:09.559]  You know, like, I mean, 28, nine years ago, having, while she's alive, on record, LBJ's mistress who heard him say, I'm going to kill Kennedy tomorrow in Dallas and all that.
[02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:17.739]  You know, these are, we got the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt on his deathbed, how they killed Kennedy, which we already knew because he was arrested there but released.
[02:27:18.399 --> 02:27:19.479]  Charles Harrelson was with him.
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.479]  Later, you know, died in prison for shooting a federal judge with 243 at 300 yards in San Antonio.
[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:30.250]  But the point is, is that, is that, That's deliberate.
[02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:32.049]  Like, how do we ruin that brand?
[02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:37.129]  Well, we get it, and then we put out a bunch of ridiculous crap, and they'll think it's Alex Jones.
[02:27:37.649 --> 02:27:40.170]  I mean, that is going to totally blow up.
[02:27:40.329 --> 02:27:41.909]  Again, The Onion's the front group.
[02:27:42.069 --> 02:27:46.809]  They admit it's the Democratic Party law firms that came in with the funds.
[02:27:47.409 --> 02:27:50.690]  So it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:51.030]  Go ahead.
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:55.299]  Well, no, it's also, you know, whoever bought the onion in April, right?
[02:27:55.379 --> 02:27:57.319]  It was purchased in April because it was failing.
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:04.639]  And so, but what people need to understand is like, it's not like, okay, we're saying things and they're saying things and now we're shut down and they're still going or whatever.
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:07.500]  It's like, we have everything against us.
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:14.760]  We have, we're being deplatformed, we're debanked, we're, you know, just constantly smeared, constantly slandered, lawsuits, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:28:14.879 --> 02:28:16.620]  We have everything rigged against us.
[02:28:16.659 --> 02:28:20.000]  And yet, I think?
[02:28:32.479 --> 02:28:35.120]  People are going to portray this as InfoWars went down.
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:36.379]  InfoWars didn't go down.
[02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:38.319]  We have not lost audience.
[02:28:38.319 --> 02:28:39.620]  We've only gained audience.
[02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:49.219]  Whereas, on the other side, the Vices and the Onions and the MSM and all of these, they get routine cash injections of $400 million, right?
[02:28:49.399 --> 02:28:51.379]  And then five years later, it's all gone.
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:52.579]  Their numbers are plummeting.
[02:28:52.659 --> 02:28:54.120]  Their audience is nonexistent.
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:55.719]  And they get another $400 million.
[02:28:56.159 --> 02:29:07.969]  So when you really compare the separate Experience that InfoWars has had from the more mainstream-approved, establishment-friendly alternative news, it couldn't be more clear.
[02:29:08.129 --> 02:29:16.250]  And yet they have the nerve and the gall to act smug, to act like they won, to act condescending to us.
[02:29:16.690 --> 02:29:18.489]  They can't win without cheating.
[02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:20.590]  And even when they cheat, they usually lose.
[02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:22.590]  That's how powerful our information is.
[02:29:22.709 --> 02:29:24.250]  That's how powerful our news is.
[02:29:24.329 --> 02:29:26.010]  That's how powerful our style is.
[02:29:26.969 --> 02:29:36.610]  I don't know how to explain to people how there is No control at Infowars beyond what you see on the screen.
[02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:37.329]  We do it live.
[02:29:37.489 --> 02:29:38.549]  There's no teleprompter.
[02:29:38.649 --> 02:29:40.690]  There's nobody in my ear telling me what to do.
[02:29:40.930 --> 02:29:43.049]  And I, of course, have you to thank for that.
[02:29:43.149 --> 02:29:45.590]  The amount of trust you put in me is incredibly humbling.
[02:29:45.649 --> 02:29:50.930]  But I feel that pressure, that obligation to live up to expectations.
[02:29:51.069 --> 02:29:51.750]  Same with the audience.
[02:29:51.850 --> 02:29:56.930]  The audience is so loyal and so giving and so proud of us.
[02:29:56.989 --> 02:30:01.989]  It's like You feel this obligation to rise to the occasion and to do it for them.
[02:30:02.110 --> 02:30:03.329]  So that is our guiding light.
[02:30:03.450 --> 02:30:06.110]  That is the deal I think we've struck with our audience.
[02:30:06.250 --> 02:30:09.770]  We do the best we can to tell you the truth, and we ask you to support us in return.
[02:30:09.989 --> 02:30:15.110]  It's the most pure, good, free way to run anything ever.
[02:30:15.250 --> 02:30:20.090]  We aren't beholden to pharmaceutical companies and weapons manufacturers.
[02:30:20.489 --> 02:30:21.450]  You couldn't trust us then.
[02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:23.010]  So everybody gets this now.
[02:30:23.209 --> 02:30:24.530]  Everybody understands this.
[02:30:24.610 --> 02:30:25.629]  It's why Trump won.
[02:30:25.930 --> 02:30:29.950]  It's why the people going into his cabinet—I mean, the fact that fluoride is being taken out of the water.
[02:30:29.989 --> 02:30:33.649]  They're talking about atrazine on presidential debate stages.
[02:30:33.909 --> 02:30:39.790]  Tulsi Gabbard has gone from being on the no-fly list to controlling the no-fly list.
[02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:44.670]  I mean, this is a monumental and incredible revolution in America happening right now.
[02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:48.950]  And InfoWars and Alex Jones, you have been at the spearhead of this, at the forefront of this.
[02:30:49.149 --> 02:30:50.010]  Leading the way.
[02:30:50.530 --> 02:30:57.729]  And like I said, everything that you've talked about for 30 years has now almost, it's almost metastasized where, you know, you would talk a little bit about health.
[02:30:57.969 --> 02:31:03.729]  Well, now there's this whole spectrum of bodybuilding, right wing, RFK following.
[02:31:04.129 --> 02:31:05.030]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:31:05.170 --> 02:31:08.270]  We pioneered exposing fluoride, the poison shots, everything.
[02:31:08.850 --> 02:31:10.309]  RFK was doing it as well.
[02:31:10.409 --> 02:31:16.370]  It's not about credit, but everything we did 30 years ago, 20 years ago, and without you, without this crew, it's been very stressful.
[02:31:17.319 --> 02:31:18.840]  We would not have been able to do this.
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:24.979]  And so there's a lot of people here that I want to pray for and thank folks and appreciate.
[02:31:25.479 --> 02:31:28.819]  When you back us, you back the crew that had a raise in two years and been through hell.
[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:30.979]  We don't have a bunch of extra money right now on my children.
[02:31:31.219 --> 02:31:33.040]  We need support at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:31:33.139 --> 02:31:34.979]  Become a VIP. $30 a month.

[02:31:53.629 --> 02:31:54.950]  My dad's a great supplement company.
[02:31:55.049 --> 02:31:55.850]  It's so important.
[02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:57.549]  So I'm going to make some calls here.
[02:31:57.629 --> 02:31:58.829]  We've got some big guests coming up.
[02:31:58.950 --> 02:32:00.549]  But Harrison, shift away from InfoWars.
[02:32:01.530 --> 02:32:04.430]  You're going to host the next 15 minutes because I've got to make some phone calls.
[02:32:04.530 --> 02:32:05.209]  I've got some updates.
[02:32:06.329 --> 02:32:08.290]  Cover the country, the big news.
[02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:11.079]  The deep state's obviously going to go on the offensive.
[02:32:11.260 --> 02:32:11.979]  They're not going to give up.
[02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:15.799]  Some of them are rolling over, but overall, they've still got a lot of stragglers.
[02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:17.020]  It's kind of like Star Wars.
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:18.940]  You blow up the Death Star, you've still got the Imperial fleet.
[02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:19.979]  But we have the initiative.
[02:32:19.979 --> 02:32:20.440]  We're winning.
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:22.420]  And we have right on our side, the high ground.
[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:22.940]  We will win.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:28.799]  But just big news now in the world, what you would have covered today on your show if it hadn't been commandeered by the hijacking.
[02:32:29.879 --> 02:32:35.500]  Yeah, well, I would have talked about the appointments and sort of gone through the game that's being played in the wider negotiation.
[02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:36.879]  I'm glad you asked, though.
[02:32:37.219 --> 02:32:41.959]  I feel like I should tell you, Alex, go do calls right now, because once I tell you this story, you're going to want to comment on it.
[02:32:42.079 --> 02:32:44.920]  So, you know, I'm going to say it now, but you're going to hear this.
[02:32:45.059 --> 02:32:46.000]  No, go ahead and say the story.
[02:32:46.299 --> 02:32:47.120]  It's crazy.
[02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:48.239]  Okay, just dropped.
[02:32:49.090 --> 02:33:04.989]  Secretary Mayorkas on DHS's AI Safety and Security Board's first-of-its-kind framework, everybody in the AI ecosystem has a role to play and responsibilities to ensure the safe and secure deployment of AI in critical infrastructure, safeguarding essential services,
[02:33:05.170 --> 02:33:06.649]  and building public trust.
[02:33:07.049 --> 02:33:10.270]  They'll probably use the AI to make sure we don't follow the kids he kidnapped.
[02:33:11.709 --> 02:33:12.049]  Oh, yeah.
[02:33:12.270 --> 02:33:13.350]  Well, amongst other things.
[02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:16.409]  I mean, everybody gets right now that AI is like the future.
[02:33:16.569 --> 02:33:17.049]  I mean, whoever...
[02:33:17.969 --> 02:33:28.350]  Succeeds in monopolizing AI is going to win the future forever, because then once you have AI, you can run simulations, determine what the best course of action is, and stay on top forever.
[02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:30.170]  So they are doing it right now.
[02:33:30.329 --> 02:33:35.469]  They just announced this today, this groundbreaking framework for secure development.
[02:33:35.629 --> 02:33:36.510]  And of course, you know what that means.
[02:33:36.629 --> 02:33:42.049]  That means that they will correct for the non-existent biases of AI, right?
[02:33:42.129 --> 02:33:42.809]  Because that's what they do.
[02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:48.670]  They put in information to the AI. The AI comes out with a result totally robotically like a calculator.
[02:33:48.829 --> 02:33:59.129]  If that result is interpreted as unfair or unequal or non-equitable, then they just assume or assert that AI must be biased.
[02:33:59.290 --> 02:34:00.129]  AI must be...
[02:34:01.319 --> 02:34:02.180]  Racist somehow.
[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:11.440]  So in order to correct for this perceived racism, they're actually going to put in the AI algorithms corrective measures that are correcting for non-existent things.
[02:34:11.579 --> 02:34:15.639]  So this is already happening, and it's terrifying because AI is going to be in charge of health.
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:16.719]  It's going to be in charge of justice.
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:18.559]  I mean, AI is the thing now.
[02:34:18.719 --> 02:34:44.399]  So imagine this has happened, where they will put an AI on determining whether or not We're good to go.
[02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:47.750]  I think?
[02:35:14.730 --> 02:35:17.530]  I think?
[02:35:23.290 --> 02:35:38.649]  That's the real danger of AI is that they will make changes to it and really program in pre-established responses that they want that fit their agenda, and they'll justify that by pointing to non-existence bias and say, yeah, we're doing this, and it's good,
[02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:44.790]  and it's for equity, and they'll create equity by discriminating against the majority for the benefit of the minority.
[02:35:44.969 --> 02:35:50.729]  So that just broke, and they're laying out the groundwork for that.
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:58.639]  Today, what I was going to talk about is the picks of Donald Trump, and it's so funny how these things change.
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:00.579]  I was trying to think back.
[02:36:01.319 --> 02:36:04.360]  Did this happen in 2020?
[02:36:04.379 --> 02:36:05.420]  Did this happen in 2016?
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.719]  It's like, yeah, they pick people, but it's not this edge of your seat.
[02:36:09.899 --> 02:36:15.700]  I've seen it related to or compared to the NBA draft, and that's kind of how it feels.
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.819]  It's like, who's the next pick?
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:17.540]  What's going to happen?
[02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:18.340]  Speculation.
[02:36:19.219 --> 02:36:19.620]  Dissension.
[02:36:21.069 --> 02:36:22.149]  Jockeying for spots.
[02:36:22.409 --> 02:36:28.010]  And what I want people to understand about this, and it's kind of obvious, but you need to think about it, right?
[02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:30.690]  What's happening?
[02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:43.950]  Every one of these appointments is the result of massive and complicated and intricate negotiations, and the picks themselves are just one part of a wider strategic battlefield that...
[02:36:44.329 --> 02:36:49.090]  I think?
[02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:13.930]  We're good to go.
[02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:24.290]  You kind of owe something to because they helped you get elected, right?
[02:37:24.569 --> 02:37:32.190]  Tulsi Gabbard would be in that line because she's not a sitting congresswoman, so there's no issue with, okay, if we appoint her to something, now we have a seat to fill.
[02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:33.790]  Does the governor get to fill it?
[02:37:33.989 --> 02:37:35.170]  Does whoever get to fill it?
[02:37:35.989 --> 02:37:49.229]  She's more of a free agent, but by taking that very drastic and unique step of joining the Republican Party, leaving the Democrat Party, there was some either spoken or non-spoken agreement of like, hey, this is a big risk.
[02:37:49.859 --> 02:37:52.299]  It's going to piss a lot of people off, but I'm willing to do it.
[02:37:52.459 --> 02:37:56.819]  And if you win, you know, I'd like to be involved in the administration somehow.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.600]  These are the games that are always played in politics.
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:02.540]  And I think as long as you're not selling positions, this is the thing.
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:05.219]  There was that big debacle.
[02:38:05.319 --> 02:38:07.639]  Was it Blagojevich or somebody?
[02:38:07.879 --> 02:38:17.260]  He was caught on tape or he was discovered to have said when Obama became president, he said, oh, now I have this Senate seat and I can get a big chunk of change for this, right?
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:24.139]  Because In that case, the governor was the one who would fill that Senate seat, and he knew this is a valuable commodity.
[02:38:24.459 --> 02:38:29.620]  Now, if you're selling the seat, that's pure corruption, obviously, but that's how these people see the world, right?
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.479]  They're like, well, I'm governor.
[02:38:30.579 --> 02:38:31.540]  This is my prerogative.
[02:38:31.659 --> 02:38:33.299]  I better make a couple million bucks off this.
[02:38:33.719 --> 02:38:44.799]  But if you're doing it in a sort of horse-trading, wheeling-and-dealing political – you're negotiating and trading political influence, I think that's perfectly fair, and that's how the system was designed.
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:55.239]  So right now, Mitch McConnell is stepping down as head of the Senate, and they put John Thune in, and all of that was a part of this horse trading and negotiation.
[02:38:55.579 --> 02:39:01.520]  And okay, if you put certain people in certain positions, then I can make sure the Senate will confirm your other appointments.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.579]  But if you want us to confirm this appointment that's pretty radical, then you need to make a pretty big concession on this.
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:08.540]  So not only if you've got...
[02:39:10.599 --> 02:39:12.260]  Marco Rubio, he's a senator.
[02:39:12.459 --> 02:39:14.520]  So he is now the Secretary of State.
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:15.780]  His position is open.
[02:39:15.959 --> 02:39:20.760]  I imagine Ron DeSantis has the authority to put somebody in that.
[02:39:20.879 --> 02:39:39.040]  But to make that appointment first, they had to sort of negotiate with I think?
[02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:50.469]  Putting somebody like Matt Gaetz as AG is pretty big.
[02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:54.430]  That's a pretty huge thing, and there's articles all day today saying he'll never get confirmed.
[02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:57.250]  I think McCarthy said that's a pipe dream.
[02:39:57.370 --> 02:39:58.450]  He'll never get confirmed.
[02:39:58.610 --> 02:40:15.979]  Well, maybe he'll get confirmed if Trump makes concessions in other places, because if you look at the cabinet, the Secretary of State – I mean, in all reality, the Secretary of State in some cases has more power than the U.S. president when it comes to foreign – Foreign politics,
[02:40:16.059 --> 02:40:17.879]  geopolitics, and foreign relations.
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:22.100]  So I admit, I was wrong about this, I admit.
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:25.000]  But I said on my show, I said, this is speculation, but I'm suspicious.
[02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:27.000]  I was suspicious of the Marco Rubio pick.
[02:40:27.079 --> 02:40:32.459]  I didn't think it was going to be Marco Rubio because he just, frankly, is kind of unimpressive.
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:33.799]  Literally, that was why.
[02:40:33.879 --> 02:40:36.219]  I was like, he's going to choose Marco Rubio, that guy?
[02:40:37.479 --> 02:40:38.459]  This is Secretary of State.
[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:40.059]  Don't you want the most impressive person?
[02:40:40.879 --> 02:40:42.219]  But maybe he doesn't.
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:45.719]  Maybe Donald Trump chose Marco Rubio because he's not very impressive.
[02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:54.799]  If you're a strong executive running the government as president, kind of the last thing you want is a really impressive secretary of state.
[02:40:55.059 --> 02:40:58.040]  Henry Kissinger was a very impressive secretary of state.
[02:40:58.229 --> 02:41:09.950]  You could argue Hillary Clinton was a very impressive Secretary of State, meaning that they had initiative and influence on their own and were acting almost more as a representative of the deep state, which is – that's how you can sort of see it.
[02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:12.329]  The Secretary of State is almost the president of the deep state.
[02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:19.309]  They're on that seventh floor with the FBI and the DOJ, and they're sort of the power, the secret power, the deep state power.
[02:41:20.370 --> 02:41:30.879]  But when it comes to someone like Mitch McConnell and what they're doing and the way that he is wheeling and dealing, what it shows is that there is still – I think?
[02:41:51.099 --> 02:41:53.180]  No legitimate counterpoint.
[02:41:53.299 --> 02:41:54.500]  We want the Trump agenda.
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:55.780]  We want the MAGA agenda.
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:57.200]  We elected Trump to be Trump.
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:00.379]  You know, Trump didn't moderate his message over this last election.
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:02.319]  He didn't go towards the middle to get elected.
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:04.239]  He went more to the right than he's ever been before.
[02:42:04.399 --> 02:42:06.139]  He was more to the right than he was in 2016.
[02:42:06.139 --> 02:42:07.879]  He was more to the right when he was in 2020.
[02:42:08.399 --> 02:42:09.420]  That's who we voted for.
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:11.180]  That's what got us our handslide victory.
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:12.200]  That's right, Harrison.
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:13.979]  We're going to go to break.
[02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:16.520]  I want to come back and hit some more of the big breaking news.
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:24.899]  But just think of the outrageousness of saying it's a public normal auction under law two days before saying that's all changed.
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:25.360]  It's secret.
[02:42:25.479 --> 02:42:27.120]  We'll take a smaller person's bid.
[02:42:27.479 --> 02:42:28.479]  That's not an auction.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.780]  And then not even pledging money.
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:42.979]  Pledging their lawsuit rights against me as money is So they're like taking loans out in my name on stuff that's appealed.
[02:42:44.139 --> 02:42:46.379]  That's cut and dry in federal and state law.
[02:42:46.559 --> 02:42:47.079]  Can't do that.
[02:42:47.239 --> 02:42:50.719]  I mean, it's just like they just think, like they said, we can own your name.
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:52.959]  Alex Jones is not afforded the 13th Amendment.
[02:42:53.219 --> 02:42:54.159]  I showed that on Bloomberg.
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:55.139]  That's in the federal filing.
[02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:58.680]  13th Amendment is the law against slavery.
[02:43:01.629 --> 02:43:02.870]  They say they own me.
[02:43:03.170 --> 02:43:04.149]  Good luck.
[02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:07.290]  That's where the bottom of the rabbit hole is in the New World Order.
[02:43:07.370 --> 02:43:07.850]  They own you.
[02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:08.590]  They own your kids.
[02:43:08.709 --> 02:43:09.389]  They own your body.
[02:43:09.569 --> 02:43:10.430]  They own your mind.
[02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:11.129]  They own your soul.
[02:43:11.469 --> 02:43:14.069]  No, you don't, Globalist!
[02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:17.270]  And I pledge to fight you harder than ever!
[02:43:18.010 --> 02:43:18.450]  Ah!
[02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:20.270]  Yeah!
[02:43:23.049 --> 02:43:25.569]  Oh, we're winning, baby!
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:32.860]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:45.399]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[02:43:45.559 --> 02:43:47.239]  They are a private agency.
[02:43:47.459 --> 02:43:51.700]  Some of the president's elect advisors have suggested that you should resign.
[02:43:52.079 --> 02:43:54.500]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:55.299]  No.
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:02.040]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:02.719]  No.
[02:44:02.959 --> 02:44:15.940]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:44:16.139 --> 02:44:23.239]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[02:44:23.459 --> 02:44:32.809]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration On monetary policies and to also dismantle the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:33.010 --> 02:44:35.389]  But that's where all this predatory garbage comes from.
[02:44:35.549 --> 02:44:37.350]  It's where the ESGs come from.
[02:44:37.430 --> 02:44:41.950]  It's where the global governance comes from, the corporate social credit scores, all of it.
[02:44:42.090 --> 02:44:47.469]  And President Trump is striking right at the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[02:44:47.709 --> 02:44:54.840]  Now, in closing here, Infowars is set to be sold At auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.700]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[02:44:57.860 --> 02:45:00.139]  But regardless, backups are being set up.
[02:45:00.299 --> 02:45:02.500]  New systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[02:45:02.739 --> 02:45:11.840]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:12.559]  And...
[02:45:12.909 --> 02:45:18.809]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[02:45:19.129 --> 02:45:29.329]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:30.450]  Here it is on screen.
[02:45:31.069 --> 02:45:31.629]  Iconic.
[02:45:31.829 --> 02:45:42.170]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:53.899]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:46:00.399]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with...
[02:46:01.020 --> 02:46:03.659]  Three simple words at the bottom.
[02:46:03.899 --> 02:46:05.719]  Back to back to back.
[02:46:05.959 --> 02:46:06.739]  That's right.
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:09.860]  He's the only president to ever run three times.
[02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:14.600]  And he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[02:46:14.819 --> 02:46:15.739]  He won in 16.
[02:46:15.739 --> 02:46:16.739]  He won in...
[02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:28.930]  We've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[02:46:29.069 --> 02:46:35.250]  And to do that, he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[02:46:35.370 --> 02:46:40.530]  The most reach we've ever had, thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:45.309]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[02:46:45.469 --> 02:46:52.430]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get started.
[02:46:52.459 --> 02:46:54.059]  The Trump Patriot apparel.
[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:55.180]  Get the posters.
[02:46:55.379 --> 02:46:58.940]  There's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:01.819]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:03.059]  Thanks for your support.
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.520]  God bless and good luck.
[02:47:04.739 --> 02:47:08.739]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[02:47:08.979 --> 02:47:09.680]  Thank you so much.
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:53.899]  Broadcasting to all patriots who refuse tyranny, you're listening to Alex Jones Live.
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:10.899]  Well, it's historic, ladies and gentlemen, and as I told the globalists, I don't know how this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[02:48:13.530 --> 02:48:14.030]  All right.
[02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:16.909]  Harrison Smith, I'm going to let you go here in a minute.
[02:48:17.010 --> 02:48:20.030]  I'm going to start plowing through news and breaking information.
[02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:24.870]  We are going to court as soon as the judge gives us the emergency hearing.
[02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:26.149]  It was already filed by 8 a.m.
[02:48:26.290 --> 02:48:26.549]  this morning.
[02:48:28.710 --> 02:48:33.329]  Just absolutely the auction, in my view, and my lawyer's view, was not real.
[02:48:33.850 --> 02:48:35.489]  What the public was told was not real.
[02:48:35.809 --> 02:48:37.110]  It was changed last minute.
[02:48:37.209 --> 02:48:37.809]  It's outrageous.
[02:48:38.170 --> 02:48:43.350]  And then where they're really in trouble is what they pledged towards the smaller amount of money.
[02:48:43.530 --> 02:48:45.969]  Well, just an IOU on me.
[02:48:47.409 --> 02:48:51.989]  Well, so money Alex owes us will buy the company.
[02:48:52.250 --> 02:48:54.329]  We just hijacked without a court order.
[02:48:55.340 --> 02:49:10.540]  And because the new CRO, federal trustee, excuse me, got in there in the last few months and, you know, got into the infrastructure, they just,
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:14.120]  by force du jour, just pulled the plug.
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.899]  And so that's where we are.
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:23.500]  And it's just also they can, I mean, show the owner of the onion.
[02:49:23.659 --> 02:49:24.899]  I mean, look at the image of this guy.
[02:49:26.579 --> 02:49:30.760]  These goobers, like, think they've just had some big victory.
[02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:38.360]  We have been fighting and holding on and standing up against just outrageous attempts to hijack the operation.
[02:49:39.239 --> 02:49:45.120]  For the last federal trustee and CRO, again, in late May, just all the security was showing up Friday afternoon.
[02:49:45.239 --> 02:49:45.620]  What's going on?
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:46.879]  They go, we hear it's closing at nine.
[02:49:47.989 --> 02:49:49.270]  I make some phone calls to the lawyers.
[02:49:49.370 --> 02:49:50.170]  Yeah, we just got a call.
[02:49:50.670 --> 02:49:51.770]  They're closing.
[02:49:51.989 --> 02:49:53.409]  I tell the security, you can't do that.
[02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:54.750]  Where's the court order?
[02:49:55.389 --> 02:49:56.290]  Talk to the head of the company.
[02:49:56.409 --> 02:49:58.790]  They go, I just got the phone with this woman saying, I'm a federal agent.
[02:49:59.670 --> 02:50:00.430]  I'm a lawyer.
[02:50:00.610 --> 02:50:01.670]  You will close the doors.
[02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:03.370]  And they said, we're not doing that.
[02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:04.450]  And I said, yeah, of course you're not.
[02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:06.430]  The security we hired years ago.
[02:50:07.170 --> 02:50:08.270]  Any security company.
[02:50:08.350 --> 02:50:10.030]  We just randomly show up, just take stuff.
[02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:13.149]  I'm a federal trustee.
[02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:23.360]  But I wasn't going to sit there while they turned off the website and all the rest of it and have some physical confrontation with these people.
[02:50:25.559 --> 02:50:28.079]  I just already have all this set up.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:29.739]  I told everybody this was coming.
[02:50:30.579 --> 02:50:31.940]  And I told the crew Monday.
[02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:33.000]  I said it's all rigged.
[02:50:33.020 --> 02:50:39.280]  It was Monday when they changed the bid to secret and said the smaller one would win or could win.
[02:50:39.659 --> 02:50:41.299]  Now they're calling it the right bid.
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:42.459]  It's not the high bid.
[02:50:42.459 --> 02:50:43.620]  It's the right bid.
[02:50:44.570 --> 02:50:51.690]  And there is the guy that was the front guy with the Democrats that thinks he's really, really, really showed the American people.
[02:50:51.790 --> 02:50:53.350]  Yeah, take something away from people.
[02:50:53.850 --> 02:51:00.750]  Yeah, do it this way, and everyone will not want to listen to the show anymore because you're trying to keep it from them.
[02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:04.069]  I mean, again, it just goes to their fundamentals.
[02:51:05.049 --> 02:51:06.850]  Crew, try to find it.
[02:51:07.170 --> 02:51:26.409]  Search it on X. Compilation, the exact word, compilation of MSM or compilation of MSM saying Trump mugshot will hurt him or something like, or I remember playing it even before the mugshot came out.
[02:51:26.530 --> 02:51:28.409]  There were compilations like, this will destroy him, it's over.
[02:51:28.610 --> 02:51:31.329]  Once he's a felon, once we have the mugshot, we've got it.
[02:51:31.409 --> 02:51:35.450]  I'm like, did Elvis get cooler with his mugshot?
[02:51:36.329 --> 02:51:38.909]  And he wasn't, you know, Robin Hood.
[02:51:39.090 --> 02:51:41.700]  I mean, Let me tell people a story.
[02:51:41.899 --> 02:51:57.049]  The cool part about being in Central Texas and being on air for 30 years is my film Endgame premiered at the Alamo Drafthouse In 2007, and the theater's only held like 300 people, and we had such a big crowd,
[02:51:57.209 --> 02:51:57.909]  thousands of tickets sold.
[02:51:57.950 --> 02:51:59.250]  We had it shown on three screens.
[02:51:59.629 --> 02:52:03.270]  But one showed at like six, and one showed at seven, and one showed at nine.
[02:52:03.610 --> 02:52:09.670]  So I would go give a speech at the start of the thing to the crowd, and then I would go and hang out and then go to the next thing.
[02:52:09.850 --> 02:52:12.889]  So the second showing, I think it was the last showing, actually.
[02:52:14.409 --> 02:52:16.170]  People go, hey, Willie Nelson's in the back row.
[02:52:17.090 --> 02:52:17.930]  And I'm like, okay.
[02:52:18.809 --> 02:52:21.920]  So I... Big fan of Willie Nelson.
[02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:23.579]  Even though politics are wrong, he means well.
[02:52:24.399 --> 02:52:25.959]  Reminds me so much of my family in East Texas.
[02:52:26.139 --> 02:52:27.760]  He's from the very same place, very close.
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:32.719]  So I have a lot of uncles and cool great-uncles that are dead now that literally looked and acted like Willie Nelson.
[02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:35.780]  Just salt of the earth, real people, sweethearts.
[02:52:35.979 --> 02:52:38.540]  And I go back there, and he's not there.
[02:52:39.559 --> 02:52:40.440]  I go, oh, whatever.
[02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:41.500]  They said it's Willie Nelson.
[02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:42.120]  It probably wasn't him.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:48.760]  So I go out, and there's people from the last show and still out there want me to sign DVDs of my other films.
[02:52:50.010 --> 02:52:52.190]  And so I'm sitting there signing DVDs.
[02:52:52.250 --> 02:53:00.790]  All of a sudden, Willie Nelson walks up, looks at me, comes around the thing, and says, I want one of these signed.
[02:53:01.290 --> 02:53:01.790]  I signed it.
[02:53:01.930 --> 02:53:04.989]  He goes, here's my phone number.
[02:53:05.770 --> 02:53:07.250]  And I said, well, let me give you my number.
[02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:09.290]  And so I gave him my number.
[02:53:09.450 --> 02:53:10.110]  And it was weird.
[02:53:10.530 --> 02:53:11.770]  I had it in my wallet.
[02:53:11.889 --> 02:53:12.489]  It's Willie Nelson.
[02:53:12.649 --> 02:53:13.190]  Did I call it?
[02:53:13.270 --> 02:53:14.690]  It's just like a couple weeks go by.
[02:53:14.690 --> 02:53:15.950]  I forget to call Willie Nelson.
[02:53:16.090 --> 02:53:18.729]  It wasn't like, it was just kind of like, wow, call Willie Nelson.
[02:53:19.090 --> 02:53:20.690]  It's not really good about celebrities and stuff.
[02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:24.250]  And then my phone is sitting there.
[02:53:25.049 --> 02:53:31.770]  Darren, Darren, the show, and my old producer, Trey, he's sitting there and he's got my phone.
[02:53:32.069 --> 02:53:33.670]  For some reason, I'm doing something with it.
[02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:35.450]  He answers it.
[02:53:35.549 --> 02:53:36.129]  It's Willie Nelson.
[02:53:37.930 --> 02:53:40.629]  And he goes, yeah, a guy saying he's Willie Nelson wants to come on the show.
[02:53:40.930 --> 02:53:41.950]  He wants to have dinner with you.
[02:53:42.010 --> 02:53:42.969]  He wants to come over to his house.
[02:53:43.889 --> 02:53:46.129]  And so after the show, I call, it's Willie Nelson.
[02:53:46.250 --> 02:53:46.870]  Hey, blah, blah, blah.
[02:53:47.700 --> 02:53:49.659]  I've hung out with him quite a bit, played chess with him.
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:56.959]  He invited me to Maui once to play chess for a week with a bunch of people.
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:54:00.899]  I didn't go, and then later that trip to Maui was in the news and playing.
[02:54:01.420 --> 02:54:02.420]  He was just cool.
[02:54:02.579 --> 02:54:03.780]  I got to know him and hung out with him.
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:07.559]  Last time I hung out with him was like 10 years ago with Dave Mustaine.
[02:54:08.579 --> 02:54:09.559]  Dave Mustaine's in town.
[02:54:10.159 --> 02:54:12.819]  And he's driving from the airport with his wife.
[02:54:13.879 --> 02:54:16.500]  And they brought a son with him.
[02:54:16.979 --> 02:54:17.819]  Really cool as well.
[02:54:18.399 --> 02:54:20.159]  And they're staying at my house.
[02:54:20.899 --> 02:54:22.520]  And so I'm driving home.
[02:54:22.860 --> 02:54:24.360]  He goes, man, he goes, I want to have dinner.
[02:54:24.479 --> 02:54:25.500]  He goes, you know who I really want to meet?
[02:54:25.579 --> 02:54:26.219]  You know Willie Nelson.
[02:54:26.399 --> 02:54:27.920]  Can I meet Willie Nelson?
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:30.159]  I said, I haven't talked to Willie in a couple of years.
[02:54:30.979 --> 02:54:33.639]  You know, because I was getting more Republican then.
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:35.459]  I was always Republican, but he kind of figured it out.
[02:54:35.559 --> 02:54:37.239]  His wife didn't like me, his fifth wife, and all this stuff.
[02:54:37.719 --> 02:54:38.819]  It's a funny Willie Nelson story.
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:42.260]  And I call him.
[02:54:43.310 --> 02:54:43.950]  He answers.
[02:54:44.549 --> 02:54:47.989]  And I said, hey, Dave Mustaine is in town.
[02:54:48.250 --> 02:54:49.850]  He goes, is that Metallica guy?
[02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:51.250]  And I go, well, yeah, he was in Metallica.
[02:54:51.370 --> 02:54:53.409]  I kind of created their sound or wrote their first albums.
[02:54:53.549 --> 02:54:55.649]  But he goes, he wants to have dinner.
[02:54:55.690 --> 02:54:57.190]  He goes, well, I'm eating.
[02:54:57.229 --> 02:54:59.149]  And it was someplace in the Hill Country Galleria.
[02:54:59.250 --> 02:55:00.010]  It's not there anymore.
[02:55:00.030 --> 02:55:00.829]  It was a vegan place.
[02:55:01.129 --> 02:55:03.090]  He goes, I'm eating at such and such.
[02:55:03.090 --> 02:55:04.569]  And we'll be there in about an hour.
[02:55:04.649 --> 02:55:05.450]  I'll see you there.
[02:55:05.569 --> 02:55:06.069]  Bye, Alex.
[02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:08.030]  So we show up.
[02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:10.670]  And it's Willie Nelson and his wife.
[02:55:10.850 --> 02:55:11.670]  They're drinking red wine.
[02:55:11.909 --> 02:55:16.469]  I come in with my ex-wife, Dave Mustaine, his wife.
[02:55:18.809 --> 02:55:22.409]  And I think Dave's son stayed back at the house.
[02:55:23.229 --> 02:55:24.989]  And looks just like Dave, even bigger.
[02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:25.930]  Like a Viking.
[02:55:26.629 --> 02:55:27.930]  Dave Mustaine's big in person.
[02:55:28.569 --> 02:55:29.090]  And...
[02:55:30.079 --> 02:55:31.940]  We go sit down with Willie, man.
[02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:33.440]  And that was, Willie was nice.
[02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:35.719]  We took pictures and talked, but his wife did not talk.
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:37.680]  And I just said, hey, Willie, I love you, brother.
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:40.620]  But his brain was already kind of not there then.
[02:55:41.219 --> 02:55:43.700]  I got to know him when he was still Willie Nelson, 100%.
[02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:48.379]  And now that he barely walks, turn him on, he plays, he's amazing.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.120]  I know he's got a son that's a great musician, spitting image.
[02:55:51.219 --> 02:55:51.959]  He's got a whole bunch of kids.
[02:55:52.719 --> 02:55:54.379]  But that's your Willie Nelson story.
[02:55:54.479 --> 02:55:55.879]  But I don't know why I was telling the Willie Nelson story.
[02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:04.579]  There was some Streisand effect angle I was going to tell about the Willie Nelson thing, but, oh, it doesn't matter.
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:05.819]  Why don't I just tell that Willie Nelson story?
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:14.360]  It'll pop in my head a minute why I started the Willie Nelson story, but then I went back to the Willie Nelson story and started thinking, and now I can't remember why I was going to say it.
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:16.159]  Harris, do you remember why I went into Willie Nelson?
[02:56:16.889 --> 02:56:20.569]  Well, you're talking about, did it have anything to do with Endgame, the documentary?
[02:56:21.010 --> 02:56:25.110]  The fact that, because you're talking about getting started and doing the premiere.
[02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:28.350]  I don't know why I brought up Willie Nelson.
[02:56:28.549 --> 02:56:30.209]  I mean, I can just, there was some important point.
[02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:32.090]  I went back to my brain and told the story.
[02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:36.010]  The point is, another point I can think of is, we've been around forever.
[02:56:37.149 --> 02:56:38.770]  And, you know, we're not going anywhere.
[02:56:39.729 --> 02:56:46.709]  And it's just, we're in the American culture, and they know that, and they want to make me somebody I'm not.
[02:56:48.250 --> 02:56:50.049]  Oh, I know why I told the Willie Nelson story.
[02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:51.110]  All right, let's stop.
[02:56:52.590 --> 02:56:58.969]  So, people don't know the outlaw country music story, and I know a little bit about it, but I'm going to probably get it half wrong, but here's what happened.
[02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:02.629]  There was like a mafia of folks that ran Nashville.
[02:57:02.909 --> 02:57:11.870]  You had to do it their way, and you couldn't talk about smoking pot, and you couldn't have long hair, and you couldn't talk about, you know, whatever, or they would go after you.
[02:57:12.510 --> 02:57:29.590]  And Chris Christopherson, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings were tired of it, so they all moved to Spicewood, And, you know, all basically lived by each other and said,
[02:57:29.729 --> 02:57:30.309]  screw this.
[02:57:30.930 --> 02:57:39.229]  And from the year they did that to like five years later, 70-80% of country music sales were them because they were the outlaws.
[02:57:39.270 --> 02:57:43.129]  And all they did was write what they wanted and play what they wanted and it wasn't the sound they wanted.
[02:57:43.549 --> 02:57:44.469]  That's a revolution.
[02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:46.790]  It's great music, but it's not important.
[02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:55.069]  We're a revolution of discovering the globalists, the new world order, how things really run, the deep state, what their plans are, dumbest down, deep population.
[02:57:55.069 --> 02:57:56.229]  This is really important.
[02:57:56.229 --> 02:58:01.229]  And it's not like our music took over a huge genre of music.
[02:58:02.799 --> 02:58:06.299]  We took over the entire global debate.
[02:58:06.299 --> 02:58:08.979]  People now know it's globalist or it's pro-human.
[02:58:09.379 --> 02:58:10.819]  It's team humanity or it's New World Order.
[02:58:10.899 --> 02:58:12.000]  Elon Musk agreed with me.
[02:58:12.159 --> 02:58:15.239]  We have to be team humanity against team death, the death cult.
[02:58:15.459 --> 02:58:23.180]  So we literally have created the opposition that's real to the actual power structure they thought we'd never get informed about as the blue-blood arrogance.
[02:58:24.079 --> 02:58:28.639]  And then they thought censorship and control and all this work and only makes it worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:29.899]  We're the Mavericks.
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:30.860]  We're the outlaws.
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:32.120]  We're the real deal.
[02:58:32.239 --> 02:58:39.100]  And it's been the listeners that have been the Mavericks that have been hungry for that, who were that core of Americans back when only 1% knew this.
[02:58:39.879 --> 02:58:57.479]  When I got on air 30 years ago and we took that little, important, amazing wave of people like Anthony Sutton and G. Edward Griffin and all the rest of these people, And we brought it in and it blew up and they ignored it and acted like it wasn't important,
[02:58:57.520 --> 02:58:58.420]  which was fine with me.
[02:58:59.239 --> 02:59:01.260]  CNN still pretended like they had bigger audiences than us.
[02:59:01.379 --> 02:59:03.799]  We had bigger audiences than CNN 20 years ago, folks.
[02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:05.200]  Back when they had a big audience.
[02:59:05.719 --> 02:59:10.399]  I mean, I was reaching tens of millions of people a day 20 years ago, 25 years ago, bitches.
[02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:14.139]  And so then they figured out what we did.
[02:59:15.329 --> 02:59:20.469]  And I was like, we're going to do this because I believe in humanity, freedom versus slavery, Great Reset versus Renaissance.
[02:59:20.629 --> 02:59:22.110]  I believe we'd win.
[02:59:22.809 --> 02:59:31.909]  And now we've come so far that they're so desperate that they sent in feds without court orders to close us in late May.
[02:59:32.850 --> 02:59:37.870]  And then we didn't get buffaloed and conned by that Jedi mind trick.
[02:59:38.090 --> 02:59:48.409]  So now we're here and now this went on and I looked at the tea leaves and the angles and said, well, whatever, they're in control of the infrastructure.
[02:59:48.569 --> 02:59:49.129]  They turned it off.
[02:59:49.469 --> 02:59:50.610]  I'm like, what you did's wrong.
[02:59:50.809 --> 02:59:52.350]  I believe it's not right.
[02:59:53.129 --> 02:59:53.889]  Check the law.
[02:59:54.170 --> 02:59:55.329]  You're absolutely great.
[02:59:55.489 --> 02:59:55.969]  Cut and dry.
[02:59:56.209 --> 02:59:57.430]  And now it's up to a judge.
[02:59:57.870 --> 03:00:00.690]  Is he going to certify this thing?
[03:00:01.149 --> 03:00:01.950]  And I don't know.
[03:00:02.209 --> 03:00:05.250]  I mean, he was just trying to get the stuff off his desk.
[03:00:05.649 --> 03:00:08.430]  One judge, you know, had to step down Judge Jones because of issues.
[03:00:09.149 --> 03:00:10.690]  And his plate got tripled.
[03:00:10.989 --> 03:00:12.290]  He punted on some stuff.
[03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:16.229]  But once he figured out what they were doing, he said, you have no authority to do this.
[03:00:16.530 --> 03:00:20.370]  And then when Murray, a month ago, the new guy tried to give my name up.
[03:00:20.590 --> 03:00:21.790]  Alex Jones was on there.
[03:00:22.459 --> 03:00:25.219]  And said he doesn't have a 13th Amendment and real Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:28.040]  The judge said, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:00:28.139 --> 03:00:28.860]  You can't do that.
[03:00:28.959 --> 03:00:29.760]  Take it off the thing.
[03:00:29.940 --> 03:00:32.620]  Or we're going to have a whole trial on that, and I don't believe you're going to get it.
[03:00:32.719 --> 03:00:41.840]  So they withdrew that and then just went into the auction, waited until the day and a half before, changed the rules, made it secret, said somebody with a lower bid can win.
[03:00:42.219 --> 03:00:43.540]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[03:00:43.799 --> 03:00:45.059]  Anybody can figure that out.
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:49.100]  And so then I found out they didn't just pay less.
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:52.040]  They didn't send a wire.
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:53.219]  There's no contract.
[03:00:53.399 --> 03:00:56.139]  The judge said he had to certify it before it was agreed to.
[03:00:56.379 --> 03:00:57.520]  They just, get out of here!
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:00:58.440]  Shut it down right now!
[03:00:59.379 --> 03:01:06.700]  Because they thought, just like they could make me leave the building and have armed security lock it up in May, late May, that people would just think, well, that's it.
[03:01:06.719 --> 03:01:07.479]  He just goes away.
[03:01:08.629 --> 03:01:10.770]  That is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:15.389]  That is completely cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[03:01:15.950 --> 03:01:21.469]  Bonkers, lunatic, nutball, over-the-top, ridiculous.
[03:01:23.850 --> 03:01:26.430]  And so that's where we are.
[03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:27.950]  That's what's happened.
[03:01:27.950 --> 03:01:29.709]  And so I want to be 100% clear.
[03:01:29.969 --> 03:01:31.770]  I believe this is illegitimate.
[03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:33.450]  I believe...
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:43.940]  That in a real world, what we're watching is authority completely exceeded a million miles.
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:49.659]  And when you do that, like something like this, and this type of stuff goes on, it has a name.
[03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:56.180]  And so, again, they think I'm so demonized that anything can be done to me.
[03:01:57.170 --> 03:02:06.290]  And through that done to you, and I believe in the people, and I believe the people see through this and understand this is part and parcel of all the giant power grabs and all the horrible things that have gone on.
[03:02:06.370 --> 03:02:07.889]  So I'm asking the listeners now, and you're doing it.
[03:02:09.049 --> 03:02:09.729]  I remember that.
[03:02:09.829 --> 03:02:10.110]  There it is.
[03:02:10.190 --> 03:02:10.690]  He's my name.
[03:02:11.010 --> 03:02:12.030]  And it goes into it.
[03:02:12.049 --> 03:02:13.370]  My name itself, they say they own.
[03:02:13.450 --> 03:02:14.809]  I mean, everybody knows you can't do that.
[03:02:15.489 --> 03:02:16.149]  But why not?
[03:02:16.610 --> 03:02:17.889]  Why not see if they can get away with it?
[03:02:18.450 --> 03:02:20.850]  So I know you're going to share the live feeds.
[03:02:20.989 --> 03:02:22.309]  I know you're going to share the breakdowns.
[03:02:22.930 --> 03:02:27.170]  Somehow they killed the live feed, refeed this morning.
[03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:29.690]  I hadn't been told yet to get out of here and all that stuff.
[03:02:30.909 --> 03:02:32.569]  And not a leg to stand on there.
[03:02:32.709 --> 03:02:34.190]  And now we have the archive of that.
[03:02:34.569 --> 03:02:37.170]  The last show at InfoWars, potentially, with Steve Bannon.
[03:02:37.389 --> 03:02:38.530]  Up on RealAuxJones.
[03:02:38.649 --> 03:02:39.129]  Share that.
[03:02:39.329 --> 03:02:40.430]  You have the power.
[03:02:40.629 --> 03:02:44.250]  You override the AI. You send it out on your email, text message list.
[03:02:44.329 --> 03:02:45.090]  Tell others to share it.
[03:02:45.209 --> 03:02:46.409]  Hey, they're shutting this down.
[03:02:46.569 --> 03:02:47.250]  Something big's coming.
[03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:53.389]  Again, they got stuff planned in this country with false flags, the globalists, and all this stuff that they need us off the air.
[03:02:53.549 --> 03:02:56.329]  This is emblematic of their desperation, people.
[03:02:56.590 --> 03:03:06.250]  And now you've got to flex your muscles in word of mouth and prayer for myself and the crew and my family and everybody and to stop World War III and for President Trump and to keep him alive and get him into office.
[03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:09.110]  And how many days is it until January 20th?
[03:03:09.549 --> 03:03:11.149]  We've got to get those countdowns loaded, guys.
[03:03:11.270 --> 03:03:12.030]  We've got to get those rebuilt.
[03:03:12.149 --> 03:03:12.889]  We've got to get that up.
[03:03:13.329 --> 03:03:15.229]  I mean, how many days are we, 60 days?
[03:03:17.209 --> 03:03:17.649]  67?
[03:03:17.909 --> 03:03:18.610]  I mean, 66?
[03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.870]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:03:20.370 --> 03:03:22.510]  I'm going to calculate our calendar and count it up.
[03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:25.489]  The point is, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:25.649 --> 03:03:26.629]  It's time.
[03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:28.010]  It's time to support us.
[03:03:28.069 --> 03:03:29.850]  It's time to get a t-shirt and be part of this.
[03:03:30.049 --> 03:03:31.129]  And meet like-minded people.
[03:03:31.209 --> 03:03:32.409]  It's time to get some great supplements.
[03:03:32.549 --> 03:03:36.610]  It's time to buy a limited edition fundraiser poster.
[03:03:36.850 --> 03:03:48.920]  It's time at theallestownstore.com so we can really go after these folks and stay on air and expand and add more hosts and more crew and just say, look, look, Inauguration of 66 days.
[03:03:49.659 --> 03:03:51.399]  1,605 hours.
[03:03:52.079 --> 03:03:54.319]  9,631 minutes.
[03:03:55.659 --> 03:03:56.959]  All right.
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:01.059]  Harrison.
[03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:04.229]  It's up to you guys.
[03:04:04.370 --> 03:04:04.870]  This is epic.
[03:04:04.969 --> 03:04:05.389]  What's going on?
[03:04:05.469 --> 03:04:06.049]  I'm going to stay here.
[03:04:06.129 --> 03:04:07.190]  I've got a bunch of guests coming up.
[03:04:07.350 --> 03:04:08.569]  A bunch of things to get to.
[03:04:09.770 --> 03:04:12.629]  But I would imagine you and Owen want to come in here today.
[03:04:12.850 --> 03:04:13.649]  Decide when you want.
[03:04:14.829 --> 03:04:16.889]  When I go off, you know, like four or five.
[03:04:18.209 --> 03:04:19.549]  And then I'm going to come back.
[03:04:19.770 --> 03:04:21.290]  Because this is an epic day.
[03:04:21.450 --> 03:04:22.829]  This is the day they jumped the shark.
[03:04:23.450 --> 03:04:25.030]  This is the day they screwed the pooch.
[03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:29.329]  This is the day they just absolutely all together...
[03:04:30.419 --> 03:04:38.479]  People snickering and giggling and hopping around like gremlins, or not like gremlins, thought that they had really got the bad man.
[03:04:38.799 --> 03:04:39.520]  Well, guess what?
[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:41.899]  People don't think I'm a bad man, and neither do I, because I'm a good man.
[03:04:42.180 --> 03:04:46.899]  But I'll tell you this, I'm not somebody that just rolls over, sweetheart.
[03:04:48.579 --> 03:04:49.959]  So, that's where we are.
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:52.319]  Follow me on X at Real Alex Jones.
[03:04:52.579 --> 03:04:56.440]  Follow me on X at AJNLive for the Alex Jones Network.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:57.239]  Do it now.
[03:04:57.360 --> 03:04:58.180]  Tell others, follow it.
[03:04:58.239 --> 03:05:00.559]  They don't want you to have this information because they fear it.
[03:05:01.159 --> 03:05:03.620]  Harrison, spend five minutes, then I'm going to take over here.
[03:05:03.799 --> 03:05:05.299]  We've got Bannon coming on so much more.
[03:05:05.579 --> 03:05:09.420]  Roger Stone, so many others coming on.
[03:05:09.639 --> 03:05:19.520]  But I just, in opinion about America, the world, this victory, what you make of all this, and what you think people, We should be praying for it right now.
[03:05:20.719 --> 03:05:21.559]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:05:21.700 --> 03:05:26.020]  Well, I'm praying a prayer of thanks for Elon Musk, keeping X open.
[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:27.420]  You can follow me at Harrison H. Smith.
[03:05:28.239 --> 03:05:34.340]  I mean, we would be screwed, really, without X, I think, because that has become such a big pillar of our network.
[03:05:34.459 --> 03:05:41.059]  And, hey, we built the alternatives like Bandai Video and Infowars.com, totally proprietary, but they took that through the network.
[03:05:41.309 --> 03:05:43.670]  They took our social media, then they take our proprietary.
[03:05:43.950 --> 03:05:52.530]  Thank God for Elon Musk and X. What I think people need to take away from all of this is the understanding that this is tyranny.
[03:05:52.889 --> 03:05:53.750]  This is tyranny.
[03:05:53.870 --> 03:05:54.829]  It's not like tyranny.
[03:05:54.930 --> 03:05:55.930]  It's not approaching tyranny.
[03:05:56.049 --> 03:05:57.790]  This is how tyranny operates.
[03:05:58.190 --> 03:06:07.370]  People think, and I keep using this phrase, Americans think that if the troops aren't goose-stepping down Main Street, it must not be tyranny.
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:12.920]  They expect tyranny to look tyrannical, to look like Nazis or communists throwing salutes.
[03:06:13.059 --> 03:06:16.680]  No, it looks like fake-rigged court cases.
[03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:21.889]  It looks like It's legitimate – the legitimate process of the government.
[03:06:22.049 --> 03:06:22.670]  It has to.
[03:06:22.809 --> 03:06:24.790]  That's how tyranny has to at least start.
[03:06:24.930 --> 03:06:30.590]  Once they're fully entrenched, then they can start just doing things at a whim with no concern.
[03:06:30.770 --> 03:06:36.290]  But especially in the beginning, tyranny always has to take on the appearance of legitimate process.
[03:06:36.290 --> 03:06:38.350]  It always has to have show trials.
[03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:42.350]  So when people look at it and they go, well, if you think what happened – Alex Jones is unfair.
[03:06:42.530 --> 03:06:43.290]  He had a trial.
[03:06:43.569 --> 03:06:44.709]  Look into the trial.
[03:06:44.889 --> 03:06:46.209]  Look into how it was carried out.
[03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:53.909]  Look into whether it was even a trial or not, because he was determined guilty, and then the jury was asked how guilty was he, and they decided $1.5 billion.
[03:06:54.250 --> 03:06:54.790]  It was absurd.
[03:06:55.329 --> 03:06:56.870]  This is what tyranny looks like.
[03:06:56.969 --> 03:06:57.670]  This is tyranny.
[03:06:57.770 --> 03:06:59.850]  This is how it encroaches on freedom.
[03:07:00.069 --> 03:07:03.030]  This is how it is exercised in the beginning.
[03:07:03.250 --> 03:07:06.770]  Eventually, it'll get to the point where they won't have to bother with doing show trials.
[03:07:06.909 --> 03:07:15.690]  But at the time now, there's still some remnant, some modicum of human spirit and liberty and concern for the future left in the American people.
[03:07:15.690 --> 03:07:21.270]  So they have to couch their tyrannical actions in the guise of legitimate judicial process.
[03:07:21.770 --> 03:07:22.870]  This is tyranny.
[03:07:22.989 --> 03:07:23.909]  This is what it looks like.
[03:07:24.209 --> 03:07:26.829]  That is, I think, needs to be the number one takeaway.
[03:07:28.170 --> 03:07:29.770]  And You know, you're talking about Willie Nelson.
[03:07:29.909 --> 03:07:32.209]  You're talking about the past of InfoWars.
[03:07:32.270 --> 03:07:37.930]  And it's been crazy to me to see the transformation that's gone on over the last 10 years, 12 years.
[03:07:38.069 --> 03:07:40.670]  I remember in 2012, I was living at 15th and Lamar.
[03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:42.610]  Right across the street was in Austin, Java.
[03:07:43.090 --> 03:07:45.170]  And InfoWars at the time had the magazine.
[03:07:45.309 --> 03:07:51.069]  And I'd go in in the morning, and it would be a stack of magazines set up for free because you guys just handed them out.
[03:07:51.649 --> 03:07:52.549]  I'd take a magazine.
[03:07:52.649 --> 03:07:53.030]  I'd read it.
[03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.950]  I used to have a big collection.
[03:07:54.010 --> 03:07:56.450]  I must have lost them somewhere, but I used to have every edition.
[03:07:56.610 --> 03:08:01.270]  But I'd go in, you know, that afternoon or I'd go in the next day and they'd all be gone.
[03:08:01.430 --> 03:08:02.450]  It was so popular.
[03:08:02.450 --> 03:08:07.399]  It was such a groundswell You know, common man sort of thing.
[03:08:07.680 --> 03:08:09.059]  Of course Willie Nelson was into it.
[03:08:09.159 --> 03:08:10.680]  Of course Dave Mustaine was into it.
[03:08:10.940 --> 03:08:12.459]  We were the counterculture.
[03:08:12.639 --> 03:08:13.739]  We are the counterculture.
[03:08:13.819 --> 03:08:19.639]  And that's the strange thing that's happened, is in those 10 years, we have not changed our view.
[03:08:19.739 --> 03:08:37.459]  We have not altered our position, and yet the world around us has shifted to such a degree that we, the people who were formerly the champions, you know, InfoWars, the champions of the underdog, the champions of the outsider, the champions of the The Willie Nelson outlaw Texan,
[03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:47.500]  outlaw country Texan fighters, like the true representatives of rebellion, like that rebel spirit that founded America.
[03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:55.180]  We've somehow been transmogrified in the minds through the media, in the minds of the American people through the warped and dishonest media.
[03:08:55.219 --> 03:08:56.719]  We're now the fascists.
[03:08:56.819 --> 03:08:58.420]  We're now the Nazis.
[03:08:58.420 --> 03:09:00.319]  It's like we haven't changed.
[03:09:00.479 --> 03:09:08.549]  The whole world has shifted, and they've had to try to discredit And criticize us because they can't actually contend with our information.
[03:09:08.729 --> 03:09:25.329]  They have to censor us because their viewpoint, their worldview, only exists in a world devoid of argument, devoid of the alternative view, because their view fails in every regard every single time our view wins because it's the right view,
[03:09:25.409 --> 03:09:27.770]  it's the natural view, it's the God-fearing view, it's the loving view.
[03:09:27.870 --> 03:09:29.170]  So they have to shut us down.
[03:09:29.229 --> 03:09:30.110]  They have to censor us.
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:35.420]  They have to misrepresent and caricature us because we are the real deal.
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:36.420]  We have been the same.
[03:09:36.719 --> 03:09:37.479]  You have been the same.
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:47.059]  Infowars has been the same since its founding about human liberty, about opposing globalism, about nationalism, Americana, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:09:47.239 --> 03:09:51.959]  I mean, it's been such a privilege and an honor to be associated with Infowars.
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:10:01.200]  And despite how they want to make people feel about it, the entire time that I've been at Infowars, I have been unhesitant Yeah.
[03:10:14.049 --> 03:10:17.569]  People want to portray InfoWars as this horrible thing.
[03:10:17.809 --> 03:10:18.989]  Talk to the average person.
[03:10:19.069 --> 03:10:24.809]  Talk to somebody who actually knows who we are, who actually watches the show, who actually pays attention, and they know what we're all about.
[03:10:24.889 --> 03:10:25.889]  It's humanity.
[03:10:26.090 --> 03:10:26.590]  It's liberty.
[03:10:26.850 --> 03:10:41.110]  It's everybody of every race, color, and creed deserving their rights, deserving to have a say in the American experiment, and really an obligation to uphold these basic human rights that were left to us by our Founding fathers.
[03:10:41.389 --> 03:10:43.229]  And again, this is the other thing you have to understand.
[03:10:43.409 --> 03:10:46.690]  They're not just trying to impose communism on us.
[03:10:46.809 --> 03:10:56.790]  They're trying to take us back to a pre-enlightenment era of 1775 and before, because it was America that founded human rights.
[03:10:56.829 --> 03:11:00.610]  It was America that established democracy as a viable political concept.
[03:11:00.709 --> 03:11:01.250]  Now it's assumed.
[03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:04.170]  Now everybody everywhere in the world is like, yeah, of course people should have a say.
[03:11:04.290 --> 03:11:05.209]  That was America.
[03:11:05.209 --> 03:11:08.950]  That didn't exist before us, before George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
[03:11:09.309 --> 03:11:16.090]  And of course they stood on the shoulders of giants as well with the English common law from the Magna Carta up to the English Revolution.
[03:11:16.290 --> 03:11:17.049]  I mean there are steps.
[03:11:17.170 --> 03:11:26.409]  This is an incremental gaining of rights and diminishing of authority unchecked and unquestioned and gifted from on high to the king alone.
[03:11:28.249 --> 03:11:34.350]  No, it's been a thousand years of civilizational development to get us to where we are now, and that's what's being torn away.
[03:11:34.569 --> 03:11:35.489]  That's what's being diminished.
[03:11:35.610 --> 03:11:43.850]  That's what's being really melted on purpose by these psychotic, tyrannical, despotic, censorious, I mean, what other words do we have for it?
[03:11:44.069 --> 03:11:44.629]  The enemy.
[03:11:44.770 --> 03:11:48.190]  I like to refer to them as just the enemy because they're the enemy of humanity.
[03:11:48.780 --> 03:11:52.299]  Either the freedom and they are the enemy of God.
[03:11:52.459 --> 03:11:54.739]  At the end of the day, who doesn't want to be a rebel?
[03:11:54.879 --> 03:11:56.120]  Who wants to be the empire?
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:57.719]  Who wants to be the bootlicker?
[03:11:58.100 --> 03:11:58.459]  Bootlicker!
[03:11:58.579 --> 03:11:58.819]  Nobody!
[03:11:59.100 --> 03:11:59.600]  Nobody does!
[03:11:59.700 --> 03:12:00.319]  Not me, at least.
[03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:01.379]  I'm proud to be the rebel.
[03:12:01.559 --> 03:12:12.559]  And what they don't understand is that they are, in a roundabout way, helping us to fulfill our fantasy of being the rebels, being the revolutionaries, and being a new founding father for a new age.
[03:12:12.780 --> 03:12:13.760]  God bless InfoWars.
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:14.860]  Follow me on Twitter, at Harrison.

[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:35.379]  Yeah!
[03:14:35.579 --> 03:14:35.899]  Woo!
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:36.860]  Yeah!
[03:14:41.799 --> 03:14:43.719]  Info War's strong forever, baby!

[03:14:51.920 --> 03:14:53.000]  Lives forever.
[03:14:54.659 --> 03:14:55.360]  See that fist?
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:14:57.540]  It's been crushing you for 30 plus years.
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:14:58.819]  I'm just getting started.
[03:14:59.319 --> 03:15:00.100]  Stronger than ever.
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:01.159]  Smarter than ever.
[03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:02.579]  More friends than ever.
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:03.860]  More allies than ever.
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:04.940]  You want it?
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:06.000]  You got it.
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:10.079]  Love it.
[03:15:10.680 --> 03:15:11.040]  Woo!
[03:15:11.959 --> 03:15:15.020]  Can we just restart the song from the start?
[03:15:15.180 --> 03:15:16.219]  I love that sound.
[03:15:16.340 --> 03:15:17.059]  Let me loop that.
[03:15:26.959 --> 03:15:27.719]  Fun stuff.
[03:15:28.399 --> 03:15:29.659]  Yeah, restart it from the beginning.
[03:15:29.659 --> 03:15:30.079]  That's great.
[03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:43.739]  I represent the info war.
[03:15:44.219 --> 03:15:45.799]  I don't think I'm a bad ambassador.
[03:15:45.799 --> 03:15:46.360]  I'm okay.
[03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:47.100]  I'm just not real.
[03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:50.639]  Let's look at the front man they used to do this hijacking.
[03:15:52.020 --> 03:15:53.479]  You talk about a gremlin toad.
[03:15:54.440 --> 03:15:57.120]  Let's put the onion owner up.
[03:15:58.959 --> 03:16:00.079]  People are losers.
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:03.020]  Total jokes.
[03:16:04.700 --> 03:16:08.659]  And the whole world is waking up to them really, really fast.
[03:16:09.700 --> 03:16:11.739]  And support's coming in.
[03:16:12.079 --> 03:16:12.879]  We thank you all.
[03:16:13.100 --> 03:16:17.239]  The more you support us, the more that information punch hits the enemy.
[03:16:18.559 --> 03:16:21.059]  Is that Brian Stelter's mini-me or something?
[03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:25.350]  Well, I know I'm not hiring him to be a babysitter.
[03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:26.930]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:16:27.649 --> 03:16:28.569]  Good God.
[03:16:29.969 --> 03:16:30.450]  Boy.
[03:16:32.889 --> 03:16:33.790]  Look at him!
[03:16:34.930 --> 03:16:35.850]  Look at him!
[03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:38.229]  Oh, my Lord.
[03:16:38.530 --> 03:16:39.629]  I'm about to have a heart attack.
[03:16:39.729 --> 03:16:40.489]  I'm having too much fun.
[03:16:41.170 --> 03:16:42.069]  We got...
[03:16:42.989 --> 03:16:45.590]  Savannah Hernandez, amazing reporter, popping in next segment.
[03:16:45.709 --> 03:16:46.569]  Biba Frye, lawyer.
[03:16:47.770 --> 03:16:49.069]  Another Hernandez, no relations.
[03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:51.350]  Drew Hernandez, Roger Stone, Elijah Schaefer.
[03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:53.649]  I've got some clips of man and I'm talking to him.
[03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:54.270]  He's going to get on.
[03:16:55.090 --> 03:16:56.049]  But Harrison.
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:16:59.659]  Just other big stories breaking.
[03:17:00.159 --> 03:17:01.260]  I'll be honest with listeners.
[03:17:01.399 --> 03:17:02.159]  This is a big story.
[03:17:02.319 --> 03:17:02.739]  It's important.
[03:17:03.620 --> 03:17:05.700]  But people just know it's par for the course.
[03:17:05.819 --> 03:17:06.879]  As long as they support us, we're going to win.
[03:17:07.440 --> 03:17:08.520]  Other big news.
[03:17:08.760 --> 03:17:11.540]  I mean, this is just wild what's happening.
[03:17:11.620 --> 03:17:14.899]  They're so scared of Elon Musk's Government Efficiency Bureau.
[03:17:15.860 --> 03:17:17.799]  And they're like, oh, it's not even the cabinet.
[03:17:17.819 --> 03:17:18.680]  It's not real.
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:19.520]  It's pathetic.
[03:17:19.819 --> 03:17:24.579]  No, the fact that it's not government from the outside is a watchdog is why they're so horrified.
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:25.600]  We cannot...
[03:17:31.189 --> 03:17:35.350]  We cannot overstate what a game-changer Elon Musk has been.
[03:17:35.809 --> 03:17:42.610]  I mean, really, Trump won when he came on board, and we admitted election fraud, and Trump got money to be able to go after the election fraud.
[03:17:42.709 --> 03:17:45.370]  People gave it and stood up, and they tried to kill Trump.
[03:17:45.489 --> 03:17:46.850]  That was, you know, totally cemented.
[03:17:46.969 --> 03:17:47.950]  I mean, the mugshot.
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:53.520]  Is Trump almost getting killed on national TV in that epic fight, fight, fight?
[03:17:53.639 --> 03:17:54.260]  You can't fake that.
[03:17:54.379 --> 03:17:54.780]  It's so real.
[03:17:54.959 --> 03:17:56.579]  Is that bigger than Elon Musk?
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:17:58.760]  Because, I mean, I can't decide which one's bigger.
[03:18:02.620 --> 03:18:04.100]  Yeah, fade up, Harrison, guys.
[03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:05.680]  Hey, sorry.
[03:18:05.739 --> 03:18:06.120]  Can you hear me?
[03:18:06.959 --> 03:18:09.280]  Yeah, so many things have contributed to this victory.
[03:18:09.479 --> 03:18:11.579]  I don't know what has been the bigger effect.
[03:18:11.899 --> 03:18:12.579]  Elon Musk.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:14.219]  I think RFK Jr.
[03:18:14.280 --> 03:18:16.020]  coming over had a gigantic effect.
[03:18:16.239 --> 03:18:18.280]  I think Tulsi Gabbard coming over had a gigantic effect.
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:21.120]  I think, frankly, you know, it was so close.
[03:18:21.239 --> 03:18:24.899]  Maybe the fact they killed that squirrel peanut, maybe that had an effect.
[03:18:25.079 --> 03:18:26.940]  I mean, so much had to go into this.
[03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:36.059]  And really, if you want to put one group, one set of people that put us over the top, weirdly enough, strangely, unexpectedly enough, it was the Amish.
[03:18:36.239 --> 03:18:39.139]  The Amish showing up saved Pennsylvania.
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:41.920]  Pennsylvania made the race go towards Trump.
[03:18:42.120 --> 03:18:52.690]  So, I mean, you want to talk about, like, The Ents coming in and stepping up and getting involved in the last hour to win the War of the Ring.
[03:18:53.409 --> 03:18:54.530]  That was incredible.
[03:18:54.930 --> 03:18:58.290]  And credit to Scott Pressler for the ground game in Pennsylvania.
[03:18:58.590 --> 03:19:05.829]  So it's funny how this big nationwide election can really come down to one state, and it can really even come down to one city or one county in one state.
[03:19:05.950 --> 03:19:10.170]  So Pennsylvania was that fulcrum, was that pivot point for the election.
[03:19:10.190 --> 03:19:13.620]  And Elon Musk obviously put a lot of effort into that.
[03:19:13.780 --> 03:19:18.280]  I imagine he had some, maybe some algorithms running that told him how important Pennsylvania was.
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:20.819]  But shout out to everybody who wasn't involved.
[03:19:20.819 --> 03:19:21.020]  That's right.
[03:19:21.139 --> 03:19:22.200]  Harrison, we love you.
[03:19:22.399 --> 03:19:23.360]  Talk to you soon, brother.
[03:19:23.459 --> 03:19:24.579]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:43.590]  The one thing I want you to do, if I could ask you to do anything for America and Alex and this network and this crew, the one thing I would ask you to do, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club.
[03:19:44.250 --> 03:19:47.729]  It's $30 a month, but you get $40 in store credit.
[03:19:47.850 --> 03:19:54.510]  So if you're going to buy a $35 shirt, you might as well sign up for the VIP club so that you can get that extra $10 and just get the shirt that you want.
[03:19:55.020 --> 03:20:00.319]  That is going to ensure that we can fund this operation, fund the next operation, ensure that Alex always has a voice.
[03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:01.799]  They can try to steal his identity.
[03:20:01.799 --> 03:20:03.139]  They can try to steal his business.
[03:20:03.379 --> 03:20:04.719]  They can try to steal America.
[03:20:04.719 --> 03:20:08.059]  They can try to sacrifice humanity in nuclear genocide.
[03:20:09.020 --> 03:20:14.639]  But if you go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up for Alex Jones VIP Club, they'll never take away our voice.
[03:20:14.780 --> 03:20:16.139]  They'll never take away our freedom.
[03:20:16.340 --> 03:20:17.719]  They'll never take away free speech.
[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:19.340]  And we can save America together.
[03:20:19.559 --> 03:20:22.920]  Please go now and be the reason Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[03:20:34.049 --> 03:20:37.389]  Welcome to Alex Jones Live on the Alex Jones Network.
[03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:49.510]  All right, coming up.
[03:20:50.809 --> 03:20:57.909]  Steve Bannon, Savannah Hernandez, Viva Frye, Roger Stone, Elijah Schaefer, Drew Hernandez, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[03:20:59.309 --> 03:21:03.950]  And we're going to continue on tonight on the maiden launch voyage of the Alex Jones Network.
[03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:06.850]  We've got a bigger studio getting completed right now here in the same building.
[03:21:07.790 --> 03:21:12.549]  You can get guests in there too, but this is more of a news desk type deal versus standard broadcasting.
[03:21:13.709 --> 03:21:15.270]  And you just joined us.
[03:21:15.350 --> 03:21:16.690]  I've already described everything that happened.
[03:21:16.829 --> 03:21:21.430]  I'll do it again before the hour ends, but I want to get into other big news and things that are happening.
[03:21:21.549 --> 03:21:23.049]  But Harrison Smith finishing up here.
[03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:24.309]  Okay.
[03:21:25.500 --> 03:21:27.700]  A lot of people are tuning in wanting to know what happened at Infowars.
[03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:28.680]  It's a live stream.
[03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:30.700]  We haven't really detailed it in 30 minutes.
[03:21:30.879 --> 03:21:43.379]  Give us your five-minute recap, and then I'm going to hit some breaking news on what the left's doing and a bunch of treason unfolding, and then we're going to go to Savannah Hernandez.
[03:21:44.829 --> 03:21:56.889]  Yeah, I was in the office getting ready for my show, preparing and gathering news, expecting to have to be the one who got news one way or another when phone calls started coming in.
[03:21:57.430 --> 03:22:01.350]  Actually, I heard your voice over Chase's phone say, it's done.
[03:22:01.690 --> 03:22:02.569]  They bought us.
[03:22:02.649 --> 03:22:03.649]  They're trying to close us down.
[03:22:03.909 --> 03:22:08.290]  So then it was all hands on deck and just an absolute madhouse of people running around.
[03:22:09.069 --> 03:22:11.049]  We're good to go.
[03:22:26.469 --> 03:22:28.290]  It's really beyond description.
[03:22:28.530 --> 03:22:30.709]  To have one of these guys on a crew would be amazing.
[03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:34.350]  The fact that everyone involved is that level and that committed.
[03:22:34.610 --> 03:22:41.629]  I mean, people could have left at any point in the last two years if they were unhappy because the banks had tied up our funds and all this stuff.
[03:22:41.850 --> 03:22:42.909]  Everybody stuck around.
[03:22:43.250 --> 03:22:45.930]  Everybody stuck to it because we genuinely believe in this mission.
[03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:49.430]  And the talent that these guys bring to the table is absolutely incredible.
[03:22:49.690 --> 03:23:07.829]  So I encourage people to go and subscribe to AJN Live on X, go to the Alex Jones store, contribute to the Give, Sin, Go, because it would really be a crime, it'd be a shame, it'd be a sin to let this powerhouse production crew that we've gathered Just,
[03:23:07.850 --> 03:23:11.090]  you know, have to go get jobs working for some ad agency.
[03:23:11.270 --> 03:23:11.969]  Like, that's it.
[03:23:12.250 --> 03:23:13.629]  I don't want it to happen.
[03:23:13.729 --> 03:23:14.590]  I refuse to let it happen.
[03:23:14.729 --> 03:23:15.930]  Go to fightforalex.com.
[03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:25.549]  So the crew was just scrambling, and they have been for months to get the new studio set up and everything set up.
[03:23:25.649 --> 03:23:40.489]  They've been working their butts off, and so this morning was just like go time, hit the ground running, everybody running around trying to get everything ready, and it really felt like We're good to go.
[03:23:55.889 --> 03:24:03.030]  I have to say, you look healthier now, what, 30 years, 25, 30 years later than you did back then.
[03:24:03.069 --> 03:24:04.010]  So you are leveling up.
[03:24:04.110 --> 03:24:05.409]  You're evolving like a Pokemon.
[03:24:05.690 --> 03:24:08.889]  You're achieving your Charizard form right now.
[03:24:08.989 --> 03:24:10.690]  It's been wonderful to see, honestly.
[03:24:10.690 --> 03:24:11.250]  It's been great.
[03:24:12.649 --> 03:24:13.930]  Well, I love you, Harrison.
[03:24:14.049 --> 03:24:16.049]  I appreciate you, brother, and you're awesome.
[03:24:16.190 --> 03:24:16.450]  Thank you.
[03:24:17.489 --> 03:24:17.930]  All right.
[03:24:18.350 --> 03:24:20.350]  I want to hit the other news now here.
[03:24:20.569 --> 03:24:24.569]  There's a lot of it, and we've got a bunch of guests coming on, but I want to just direct people to something.
[03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:30.790]  It takes money to take on the globalists, and nobody's doing it in media like we are, and nobody's hated by them more than us.
[03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:36.709]  So you're fighting for yourself and your future for people that won't back down, but they've got to have aid and comfort.
[03:24:36.969 --> 03:24:43.510]  And so if you go to fightforalex.com, that goes directly to the legal system.
[03:24:44.209 --> 03:24:48.930]  Defense Fund and Offense Fund to stop this evil.
[03:24:49.149 --> 03:25:01.370]  And if Americans and others are tired of rolling over to tyranny, if you're tired of being a slave, if you're tired of Big Pharma releasing viruses and injecting people with poisons and opening the borders and human trafficking, it takes money to win a war.
[03:25:01.649 --> 03:25:04.950]  The reason we got Trump is people stopped being naive about fraud.
[03:25:05.309 --> 03:25:06.790]  People flooded Trump with money.
[03:25:07.110 --> 03:25:11.969]  It was less than what the globalists had, but it still beat them because a...
[03:25:15.659 --> 03:25:17.840]  Truth is hard to stop if it's got any backing.
[03:25:18.559 --> 03:25:20.059]  So we need funds.
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:32.559]  The purest way to fight and to just make a straight donation is go to fightforalex.com, the Gibson Go, and you see the attack we're under, whether it's $1, $100, whatever, it's so critical, fightforalex.com.
[03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:34.559]  Also, thealexshillstore.com.
[03:25:34.659 --> 03:25:36.819]  Everybody wants these great Patriot shirts.
[03:25:38.069 --> 03:25:41.770]  Trump shirts, Alex Jones shirts, limited edition posters that are fundraisers.
[03:25:42.290 --> 03:25:44.590]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:25:44.709 --> 03:25:47.969]  The Ultimate CMOS is a superfood from a top-rated company.
[03:25:48.069 --> 03:25:48.829]  We probably label it from.
[03:25:48.909 --> 03:25:49.549]  Our sponsor does.
[03:25:49.969 --> 03:25:53.290]  Our CMOS is the superfood full of the best organic iodine, all these vitamins and minerals.
[03:25:53.409 --> 03:25:54.250]  It just does insane things.
[03:25:54.409 --> 03:25:55.569]  It's been all the rage for years.
[03:25:55.750 --> 03:26:01.969]  That's a great quality one and high quality at a very affordable, competitive price at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:26:02.270 --> 03:26:03.170]  You get $30.
[03:26:05.489 --> 03:26:10.989]  We're good to go.
[03:26:11.010 --> 03:26:20.709]  We're good to go.
[03:26:23.969 --> 03:26:25.790]  That way, you get a great deal.
[03:26:25.850 --> 03:26:26.709]  We form a relationship.
[03:26:26.709 --> 03:26:27.889]  You get the credit each month.
[03:26:28.069 --> 03:26:30.030]  You remember to fund us each month.
[03:26:30.250 --> 03:26:32.809]  Fund your own future, your own fight, and cancel any time.
[03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:33.370]  It's up to you.
[03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:36.870]  It's your decision to make whether to fight or roll over and be a slave of the New World Order.
[03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:39.170]  And as more people start to fight, we see the tide turn.
[03:26:39.309 --> 03:26:40.530]  Let's really get this going.
[03:26:41.309 --> 03:26:46.670]  Thealexjonesstore.com My will, my focus, my commitment to liberty is infectious.
[03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:47.370]  So is yours.
[03:26:47.569 --> 03:26:53.149]  The enemy knows I've got a strong spirit, a very strong will that God gave me, and a lot of gifts God gave me, and I've been using them the best I can.
[03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:57.489]  With the power I've been given, and as Spider-Man says, with great power comes great responsibility.
[03:26:57.909 --> 03:26:58.809]  This isn't a drill.
[03:26:58.969 --> 03:26:59.690]  This isn't a game.
[03:26:59.809 --> 03:27:00.809]  This isn't a simulation.
[03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.690]  This isn't a joke.
[03:27:01.829 --> 03:27:02.649]  This is the real world.
[03:27:02.989 --> 03:27:04.469]  Humanity fighting back from the death cult.
[03:27:04.690 --> 03:27:05.709]  We're at the tip of the spear.
[03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:06.610]  Thank you for your support.
[03:27:06.709 --> 03:27:08.469]  I want to thank those that have supported and tell those that haven't.
[03:27:08.969 --> 03:27:12.850]  Thealexchownestore.com forward slash VIP to become a VIP. But check out all the products.
[03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:14.610]  And again, very competitively priced.
[03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:17.829]  In fact, almost too inexpensive when you get like three bottles of something.
[03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:19.090]  All the great supplements.
[03:27:19.250 --> 03:27:20.290]  It's 55% off.
[03:27:20.370 --> 03:27:21.290]  There's not that much markup.
[03:27:21.329 --> 03:27:22.450]  We're making like almost nothing there.
[03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:24.280]  Two bottles, 50%.
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:26.139]  One bottle, 40%.
[03:27:26.139 --> 03:27:26.959]  That's still a great deal.
[03:27:27.079 --> 03:27:35.000]  But the limited edition posters are fundraisers for the operation and what we're building.
[03:27:35.139 --> 03:27:37.360]  So there's major markup there, you know.
[03:27:38.259 --> 03:27:41.200]  And so, yeah, it's $50 or $30 depending on the poster.
[03:27:41.319 --> 03:27:42.840]  They're great, beautiful, thick, nice posters.
[03:27:43.059 --> 03:27:44.159]  You know you support it.
[03:27:44.180 --> 03:27:44.920]  You're hanging on the wall.
[03:27:45.059 --> 03:27:46.120]  It's a symbol of your resistance.
[03:27:46.440 --> 03:27:48.420]  There's nowhere you can spend money better than this.
[03:27:48.799 --> 03:27:49.680]  They're limited edition.
[03:27:49.959 --> 03:27:50.340]  Go now.

[03:27:53.059 --> 03:27:55.379]  Thealexjonesstore.com or go to fightforalex.com.
[03:27:55.559 --> 03:27:56.100]  All right.
[03:27:57.319 --> 03:28:03.139]  Savannah Hernandez did a great job at Infowars for years, and she branched off and has reached hundreds of millions of people.
[03:28:03.319 --> 03:28:06.959]  She's a great reporter, great talk show host, and good friend of mine.
[03:28:07.500 --> 03:28:11.180]  And it's just great to have her on as one of our guests today.
[03:28:11.739 --> 03:28:14.659]  She reached out and said, you know, how are you doing?
[03:28:14.719 --> 03:28:15.059]  What can we do?
[03:28:15.059 --> 03:28:16.239]  I said, I'd love to talk to you, Savannah.
[03:28:16.440 --> 03:28:18.559]  So we have so many other great guests coming up as well.
[03:28:18.620 --> 03:28:21.100]  Viva Frye here in about 15, 16 minutes.
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:22.840]  But I wanted to go to you just briefly.
[03:28:23.090 --> 03:28:29.770]  Not just about InfoWars, but the general world, the Trump victory, the Great Awakening that's there, your view, what you think the enemy's going to do.
[03:28:29.930 --> 03:28:31.930]  And I got some stories I'm going to bring up to you here in a moment.
[03:28:32.229 --> 03:28:36.329]  Lincoln has committed all the money in the government to Ukraine, where they're laundering it back to themselves.
[03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:46.510]  We also have in Pennsylvania, Bucks County Dems just voted to count misdated or undated mail-ins, even though the federal judge said they can't.
[03:28:47.219 --> 03:28:51.399]  I mean, this is just more vigilantism from these people.
[03:28:51.559 --> 03:28:54.579]  So, Savannah Hernandez, what do you say?
[03:28:55.959 --> 03:28:58.399]  Alex, first off, thank you so much for having me.
[03:28:58.639 --> 03:29:03.979]  And, you know, you were one of the most pivotal people in getting me to where I am today.
[03:29:04.200 --> 03:29:05.000]  You woke me up.
[03:29:05.100 --> 03:29:07.340]  You informed me about what was really going on.
[03:29:07.520 --> 03:29:11.180]  And the period that we are currently in as a country right now.
[03:29:11.229 --> 03:29:16.370]  The human awakening that so many people have undergone, it really did start with you, Alex.
[03:29:16.549 --> 03:29:21.049]  I mean, we're at a point in history where people are talking about fluoride in the water.
[03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:22.809]  They're talking about the food and water supply.
[03:29:22.930 --> 03:29:24.049]  They're talking about PSYOPs.
[03:29:24.129 --> 03:29:27.110]  They're talking about this intense, corrupt government.
[03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:29.930]  And we're actually taking on the deep state at this point.
[03:29:30.049 --> 03:29:31.590]  We're pushing back against globalism.
[03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:33.989]  And of course, you were always at the forefront of that.
[03:29:34.129 --> 03:29:43.360]  So just had to open and start with saying that, Alex, you truly have been So key in instilling the 1776 spirit in so many of us.
[03:29:43.540 --> 03:29:49.920]  And, you know, not a lot of people know that you brought on a lot of the biggest talent in media today, and you gave us our start.
[03:29:50.059 --> 03:29:51.000]  So we love you, Alex.
[03:29:51.180 --> 03:29:52.059]  We love Infowars.
[03:29:52.200 --> 03:29:54.059]  The spirit of Infowars will never die.
[03:29:54.239 --> 03:29:56.299]  I don't even view today as a sad day.
[03:29:56.440 --> 03:29:57.879]  I view it as a beautiful rebirth.
[03:29:58.489 --> 03:30:06.170]  And the Infowars spirit just branching out and continuing to grow bigger and bigger because what we're going to see with this is the Streisand effect.
[03:30:06.510 --> 03:30:12.409]  Everyone is now only going to be drawn more to you, to Owen, to Harrison, and the Great Awakening will continue.
[03:30:12.450 --> 03:30:13.870]  So thank you so much for having me on.
[03:30:13.989 --> 03:30:17.770]  In regards to where we're at right now, Alex, I mean, things have been absolutely insane.
[03:30:17.930 --> 03:30:20.889]  Number one, regarding Pennsylvania, Bob Casey just needs to...
[03:30:22.109 --> 03:30:39.809]  It's absolutely hilarious to me that the Democrats who have been attacking and utilizing the DOJ to come after American citizens and President Donald Trump for the past four years for trying to overturn an election are now questioning election results because they do not like the fact that the country is awake,
[03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:43.510]  that people are pushing back, and we just want prosperity and freedom.
[03:30:43.729 --> 03:30:46.860]  And again, I just, I can't thank you enough for that, Alex.
[03:30:47.040 --> 03:30:57.239]  Every single time I go on a show, anytime I'm even on my own show personally, I always have to bring you up because you really did instill the spirit of 1776 within me and within so many people.
[03:30:57.239 --> 03:31:02.959]  And you woke us up to just how corrupt this government is not only currently, but has been for decades.
[03:31:03.020 --> 03:31:05.739]  So incredible time for us to be living through.
[03:31:05.899 --> 03:31:09.040]  I'm very honored to be on one of your first broadcasts here.
[03:31:10.940 --> 03:31:14.819]  We're good to go.
[03:31:22.729 --> 03:31:25.450]  What the establishment's doing and their brazenness of this.
[03:31:25.530 --> 03:31:27.750]  I don't know how much of you were able to hear of what they did.
[03:31:28.250 --> 03:31:29.950]  They didn't have a real auction.
[03:31:30.090 --> 03:31:31.950]  They admit they gave it to somebody that gave less money.
[03:31:32.829 --> 03:31:35.329]  They pledged lawsuits against me as the money.
[03:31:36.170 --> 03:31:39.229]  That's like Confederate notes from the Civil War or something.
[03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:41.450]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[03:31:43.180 --> 03:31:44.360]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[03:31:44.500 --> 03:31:45.360]  And we all see it.
[03:31:45.600 --> 03:31:46.500]  And you know what?
[03:31:46.579 --> 03:31:50.920]  Elon Musk buying X was so pivotal because, look, they tried to shut you down.
[03:31:51.079 --> 03:31:54.659]  And same day, you are now here broadcasting to millions of people.
[03:31:54.940 --> 03:31:56.959]  Millions of people will continue to hear your voice.
[03:31:57.079 --> 03:31:59.360]  And we people will make sure that you are not censored, Alex.
[03:31:59.500 --> 03:32:05.139]  They might try to take down your archives, your decades of work and predictions, but we will not allow that to stand.
[03:32:05.299 --> 03:32:08.440]  And we truly are living in through or living through such an incredible time.
[03:32:08.440 --> 03:32:15.250]  And I even remember, Alex, the moment You got censored initially off of like Spotify, off of YouTube.
[03:32:15.250 --> 03:32:16.629]  I remember waking up that morning.
[03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:22.370]  I was still working for you at the time and just thinking this is the most insane thing I've ever witnessed and I have a front seat to it.
[03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:31.489]  And to see how far you've come, how far Americans have come in terms of us being able to talk about what is really and truly going on in this country is so huge.
[03:32:31.690 --> 03:32:38.809]  So again, we're in such a golden era and Infowars and the spirit of Infowars will only continue to, like I said, grow.
[03:32:39.049 --> 03:32:39.770]  It's going to be incredible.
[03:32:42.780 --> 03:32:45.239]  Savannah, this to me is a lot bigger than InfoWars.
[03:32:45.260 --> 03:32:49.680]  Like when they had the U.S. trustee in the Justice Department try to close this in June without a court order.
[03:32:49.780 --> 03:32:51.680]  And of course that got stopped and then the judge fired them.
[03:32:52.280 --> 03:32:53.620]  That showed to me total desperation.
[03:32:53.780 --> 03:32:54.860]  I said, they're about to kill Trump.
[03:32:54.979 --> 03:32:56.100]  I mean, I knew something big was coming.
[03:32:56.280 --> 03:32:57.479]  They were going to make their move then.
[03:32:57.479 --> 03:32:59.139]  They had the military ready for martial law.
[03:32:59.239 --> 03:32:59.959]  We now know.
[03:33:00.500 --> 03:33:02.760]  They failed there, but I really think they're going to try again.
[03:33:02.860 --> 03:33:09.239]  And I see this really, in my view, hijacking of InfoWars with no court order or anything.
[03:33:11.319 --> 03:33:13.159]  I don't just see this as a scandal for us.
[03:33:13.920 --> 03:33:19.319]  This really portends desperateness from the establishment, because you know this comes from the top.
[03:33:20.529 --> 03:33:20.889]  Absolutely.
[03:33:21.069 --> 03:33:25.030]  And this sets the precedent for what they're going to try to do to every other independent media member.
[03:33:25.250 --> 03:33:28.590]  I mean, let's not forget that you were the test case for censorship, Alex.
[03:33:28.770 --> 03:33:32.889]  What they did to you, you know, a lot of people, they didn't want to stand up for you at that period of time.
[03:33:32.889 --> 03:33:34.809]  And they were just like, oh, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.930 --> 03:33:35.389]  He's crazy.
[03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:36.430]  Of course he's getting censored.
[03:33:36.510 --> 03:33:37.750]  And then what did we see?
[03:33:37.850 --> 03:33:44.229]  We saw eventually the sitting president of the United States of America getting censored and silenced off of social media platforms.
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:53.579]  So understand that, again, this is corrupt government officials flexing their muscles, flexing their power, and trying to set the precedent for what they could do to any independent media member.
[03:33:53.920 --> 03:33:56.639]  But again, Alex, you know, we're not going to let you be silenced.
[03:33:56.899 --> 03:34:02.680]  And the deep state is absolutely sweating right now because we are winning in so many different capacities.
[03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:09.870]  We are going to be Continuing to shed light and truth over these next four years about all of the corruption.
[03:34:10.110 --> 03:34:12.469]  Again, you've been at the forefront of that, Alex, so truly thank you.
[03:34:12.670 --> 03:34:18.729]  And I'm just sorry that this is happening to Infowars, but thank you for continuing to push back, truly.
[03:34:19.930 --> 03:34:21.110]  Well, I mean, we're winning.
[03:34:21.329 --> 03:34:24.670]  I mean, even if we were losing, I'd have to do the right thing because these people are evil.
[03:34:24.909 --> 03:34:27.309]  Human traffickers, child traffickers, it's all coming out.
[03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:28.930]  They're so arrogant, they thought they were invincible.
[03:34:29.129 --> 03:34:31.750]  Imagine being Mayorkas now, knowing all the crimes he committed.
[03:34:31.870 --> 03:34:34.670]  Harris, imagine all their gaslighting, their own cult.
[03:34:34.770 --> 03:34:38.129]  What do you make of these women shaving their heads because Trump's going to put them in a concentration camp?
[03:34:38.290 --> 03:34:40.149]  I mean, this is a cult in collapse.
[03:34:41.329 --> 03:34:48.329]  Alex, I was in New York this weekend and I was specifically talking to women and asking them, hey, now that Donald Trump is in office, what rights are going to be taken away from you?
[03:34:48.430 --> 03:34:50.190]  They couldn't articulate it, okay?
[03:34:50.549 --> 03:34:51.950]  Nobody knows why they're upset.
[03:34:52.069 --> 03:34:53.409]  These are the same women.
[03:34:53.409 --> 03:34:55.590]  And I actually am not even angry at these women.
[03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:57.969]  I feel very bad for them because they have been targeted.
[03:34:58.250 --> 03:35:03.870]  With a multi-billion dollar propaganda campaign to make them scared to vote against their best interests.
[03:35:04.190 --> 03:35:20.329]  I mean, we have had a huge generation of Americans that have been targeted by a corrupt Department of Education that has only basically made them hate their country and educated them against the true foundations of this country and what we really are about here.
[03:35:20.569 --> 03:35:26.610]  So, yeah, you know, it's just absolutely incredible the time that we are living through right now.
[03:35:27.719 --> 03:35:31.739]  Yeah, like you said, we're winning, and I don't know why these women are going so crazy.
[03:35:31.940 --> 03:35:43.100]  I'm truly going to try to make it my life's mission over the next four years to go and talk to these people, try to wake them up even more, go meet them where they're at, and push through that propaganda and push through that conditioning.
[03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:43.920]  It's so important.
[03:35:45.540 --> 03:35:57.190]  Savannah, I want you to be able to host here until Viva Fry comes on, because I just learned there's some emergency hearing happening now, right now.
[03:35:57.510 --> 03:35:59.290]  So I'm going to get some more intel on that.
[03:35:59.389 --> 03:36:00.709]  I know you're a great talk show host in your own right.
[03:36:00.829 --> 03:36:10.250]  We'll also pull up her ex account and we'll show you some B-roll while she's talking about the women she was talking to in New York in just the last few days.
[03:36:11.190 --> 03:36:12.569]  Because that's really, really important.
[03:36:12.750 --> 03:36:14.170]  And can we reach out to these people?
[03:36:14.450 --> 03:36:18.889]  We also see all these big women's groups saying they're going to poison their husbands even if they didn't vote for Trump because they're men.
[03:36:19.229 --> 03:36:22.329]  These women are like married to the state, married to Bill Gates.
[03:36:22.469 --> 03:36:24.870]  They somehow think it's good because they're allied with it.
[03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:32.450]  They don't need a man but the state run by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and King Charles that literally wanted to kill everybody, that are depopulationists are doing this.
[03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:36.229]  Yeah, it's just...
[03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:39.170]  We're still sizing stuff up.
[03:36:39.350 --> 03:36:39.969]  We're still working on stuff.
[03:36:40.049 --> 03:36:41.809]  We haven't done any real broadcasts out of here yet.
[03:36:41.969 --> 03:36:45.829]  We need to be able to center the X account and then actually show what's on it.
[03:36:46.770 --> 03:36:50.930]  This is my favorite part about coming on Alex's show is that he's live directing everything.
[03:36:50.930 --> 03:36:52.590]  I remember working productions for you, Alex.
[03:36:53.250 --> 03:36:56.670]  We're going to work through some bugs here, but we're going to...
[03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:59.170]  We've got a building full of people, so we're going to figure it out.
[03:37:00.030 --> 03:37:00.829]  Everybody's doing great.
[03:37:01.090 --> 03:37:02.729]  Yeah, but I'm going to go deal with some stuff here.
[03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:04.069]  You're hosting right now, sweetheart.
[03:37:04.209 --> 03:37:04.469]  Go ahead.
[03:37:04.549 --> 03:37:05.010]  We love you.
[03:37:05.120 --> 03:37:05.139]  Thank you.
[03:37:05.190 --> 03:37:06.049]  All right, perfect.
[03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.750]  All right, guys.
[03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:10.610]  Well, I guess I'm here hosting for Alex, which I was not expecting to do.
[03:37:10.770 --> 03:37:11.270]  You know what?
[03:37:11.270 --> 03:37:21.409]  I was actually getting ready to host my own show today, though, and I was going to talk about where we are currently at in the country in terms of Donald Trump, you know, and the A-team that is currently surrounding him.
[03:37:21.530 --> 03:37:28.190]  Obviously, not every single one of his picks are perfect, but we are truly living through one of the best periods in human history.
[03:37:28.469 --> 03:37:44.389]  Now, I was in New York this past weekend, and I was trying to talk to a lot of liberals The vibe, right, across America right now, because we have been told over the past four years that Donald Trump was absolutely not going to win this election,
[03:37:44.610 --> 03:37:48.030]  that everybody hated Donald Trump, that there was no way he was going to come back.
[03:37:48.149 --> 03:37:51.170]  And then on election night, we saw that mandate, okay?
[03:37:51.329 --> 03:37:53.889]  And I'm going to be honest with everybody here listening.
[03:37:54.149 --> 03:38:01.850]  I was not expecting for us to win the popular vote, the electoral votes, and every single swing state, all seven.
[03:38:01.850 --> 03:38:03.329]  It was a beautiful thing to witness.
[03:38:03.739 --> 03:38:10.100]  And one of the things that Alex always loves to talk about and hound home is the human spirit, the human awakening.
[03:38:10.340 --> 03:38:15.000]  And I really can't credit him enough for that because he's truly been at the forefront of it, right?
[03:38:15.079 --> 03:38:27.620]  A lot of us are just waking up right now to the fact that our food and water supply is poisoned, to the fact that we truly do have this deep state government that tried to come in and assassinate the people's choice For president.
[03:38:27.739 --> 03:38:29.059]  These are all things that we lived through.
[03:38:29.159 --> 03:38:30.040]  Let's not forget Dr.
[03:38:30.260 --> 03:38:34.000]  Fauci and the absolute insanity that the government put us through.
[03:38:34.180 --> 03:38:52.459]  I sit back and think about this sometimes because you bring in the media and the propaganda that they're consistently hitting us with is to keep us distracted From all of these major things that are consistently going on in this country, but we are currently living through one of the most incredible periods in human history,
[03:38:52.780 --> 03:39:03.180]  not only as Donald Trump as our president-elect, but also with human beings themselves being awake, us having the capability to go on X and speak to each other directly.
[03:39:03.659 --> 03:39:29.620]  I mean, you know, during the We're good to go.
[03:39:29.620 --> 03:39:30.540]  We're good to go.
[03:39:30.559 --> 03:39:32.799]  We're good to go.
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:35.879]  We're good to go.
[03:39:36.340 --> 03:39:37.159]  In the winning, right?
[03:39:37.379 --> 03:39:41.040]  Because it truly was such a big fight for the past four years.
[03:39:41.180 --> 03:39:47.180]  And unfortunately, with what is happening to InfoWars today, with InfoWars being shut down, it's heartbreaking.
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:40:00.940]  InfoWars was a platform that brought on so many of us when we were still small, maybe when we were censored, before anybody else did, before, you know, bigger people in the media thought that we were important.
[03:40:00.959 --> 03:40:02.379]  It was always Alex Jones.
[03:40:02.579 --> 03:40:04.020]  It was always Owen Schroyer.
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:05.540]  It was always Harrison Smith.
[03:40:05.829 --> 03:40:08.690]  That we're bringing us on the shows, allowing us to report.
[03:40:08.889 --> 03:40:12.309]  Again, I wouldn't be where I am today without Alex and his mentorship.
[03:40:12.610 --> 03:40:31.110]  He's mentored so many of us, and the media has tried to demonize and attack him relentlessly because he has been a part of this huge awakening that we have seen over the past four years that has gotten us into this period where we are truly about to live through the golden age of American politics.
[03:40:31.129 --> 03:40:44.530]  What you guys are seeing on screen right now Is me talking to liberal women in New York who could not articulate why they were afraid of Donald Trump, what rights they think are going to be taken away, and you know why they can't, my friends?
[03:40:44.590 --> 03:40:52.510]  Because the conditioning is breaking, and they realize that Donald Trump was president for four years, and there wasn't a fascist dictatorship that was enacted.
[03:40:52.729 --> 03:40:53.610]  They are okay.
[03:40:53.829 --> 03:40:55.610]  Their rights were not impeded upon.
[03:40:55.610 --> 03:41:05.780]  So we will continue to go out, and I would encourage every listener as well, go out and go find a liberal woman and go try to wake them up and say, Did your rights get taken away?
[03:41:06.059 --> 03:41:07.700]  Was there a dictatorship enacted?
[03:41:08.040 --> 03:41:18.739]  No, if anything, let's talk about the fact that it was Merrick Garland, it was a politicized DOJ, that over the past four years targeted political opposition and tried to jail them.
[03:41:18.879 --> 03:41:32.100]  But we are living through one of the most incredible comebacks in American history, if you will, and I truly could not be more grateful to be a part of this movement, to be living through this period of time.
[03:41:33.489 --> 03:41:34.930]  That's where we're at, my friends.
[03:41:35.430 --> 03:41:38.469]  Make sure that you're following Alex's new account.
[03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:45.430]  I was not expecting to be up here hosting, so to everybody who is tuning in, thank you for being here with me today.
[03:41:45.430 --> 03:41:52.520]  I really have just been kind of perusing the news, but most importantly, looking at What has been happening to Infowars?
[03:41:52.659 --> 03:42:07.940]  If you're just tuning in, I was talking to Alex about how this sets the precedent for, you know, what corrupt officials are going to continue to try to do to independent voices, independent media members, what they've tried to do over the past How many years?
[03:42:08.079 --> 03:42:09.540]  Nine years at this point.
[03:42:10.079 --> 03:42:21.780]  And, you know, we do have a big fight ahead, but we truly do need to take a moment to look back at how hard we fought and all of the hard work that each and every single one of us put in, Alex included.
[03:42:22.059 --> 03:42:30.639]  And like I said, This is a sad day for Infowars, but this is only going to make this movement so much more powerful, so much bigger.
[03:42:30.860 --> 03:42:38.120]  I posted a photo of Alex and I from a couple years back, and I had so many people reach out and say, I never knew that you started with Alex.
[03:42:38.159 --> 03:42:43.780]  I just started listening to him, and I wish I had started listening sooner, because now I can't go back to the archives.
[03:42:44.360 --> 03:42:54.620]  I know Alex and the team have been working on a way for you guys to be able to go and find those archives because now it's more important than ever for us to go back and find all of those Alex Jones predictions.
[03:42:54.920 --> 03:42:58.520]  I mean, this man has been at the forefront of essentially laying out the game plan for us.
[03:42:58.799 --> 03:43:04.200]  So, yes, my friends, make sure you're following Alex's New Twitter account.
[03:43:04.360 --> 03:43:06.920]  If somebody wants to tell me what it is in my ear, I want to make sure that I get it correct.
[03:43:07.200 --> 03:43:09.040]  But go follow Alex's new account.
[03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:11.020]  And thank you guys for tuning in.
[03:43:11.120 --> 03:43:12.659]  Make sure you support this man.
[03:43:12.819 --> 03:43:13.559]  Go support Owen.
[03:43:13.700 --> 03:43:15.479]  Go support Harrison Smith.
[03:43:15.739 --> 03:43:20.680]  These people have been at the forefront of the fight for humanity and the fight for human awakening.
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:23.340]  And we cannot be more grateful for that.
[03:43:23.540 --> 03:43:24.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:43:24.340 --> 03:43:24.920]  We love you.
[03:43:25.219 --> 03:43:26.100]  InfoWars, we love you.
[03:43:28.549 --> 03:43:32.909]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[03:43:33.489 --> 03:43:45.450]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[03:43:45.629 --> 03:43:47.290]  They are a private agency.
[03:43:47.569 --> 03:43:51.770]  Some of the president-elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[03:43:52.129 --> 03:43:54.549]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[03:43:54.909 --> 03:43:55.350]  No.
[03:43:56.549 --> 03:44:02.090]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.770]  No.
[03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:15.989]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[03:44:16.250 --> 03:44:23.290]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[03:44:23.489 --> 03:44:32.850]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration On monetary policies and to also dismantle the Federal Reserve.
[03:44:33.170 --> 03:44:35.430]  But that's where all this predatory garbage comes from.
[03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:37.409]  It's where the ESGs come from.
[03:44:37.530 --> 03:44:42.010]  It's where the global governance comes from, the corporate social credit scores, all of it.
[03:44:42.170 --> 03:44:47.489]  And President Trump is striking right at the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:54.850]  Now, in closing here, Infowars is set to be sold At auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[03:44:55.069 --> 03:44:57.729]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[03:44:57.909 --> 03:45:00.170]  But regardless, backups are being set up.
[03:45:00.350 --> 03:45:02.530]  New systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[03:45:02.770 --> 03:45:11.870]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.629]  And...
[03:45:12.959 --> 03:45:18.819]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[03:45:19.100 --> 03:45:29.379]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition, that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[03:45:29.559 --> 03:45:30.500]  Here it is on screen.
[03:45:31.120 --> 03:45:31.680]  Iconic.
[03:45:31.860 --> 03:45:42.200]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[03:45:42.940 --> 03:45:53.920]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[03:45:54.219 --> 03:46:00.639]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with...
[03:46:01.049 --> 03:46:03.709]  Three simple words at the bottom.
[03:46:03.930 --> 03:46:05.750]  Back to back to back.
[03:46:05.989 --> 03:46:06.770]  That's right.
[03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:09.889]  He's the only president to ever run three times.
[03:46:10.090 --> 03:46:14.629]  And he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[03:46:14.850 --> 03:46:15.770]  He won in 16.
[03:46:15.770 --> 03:46:16.750]  He won in...
[03:46:24.600 --> 03:46:35.270]  We've won the battle now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp and to do that he's got to have folks like InfoWars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:40.549]  The most reach we've ever had, thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[03:46:40.690 --> 03:46:45.329]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:58.969]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get the Trump Patriot apparel, get the posters, there's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[03:46:59.290 --> 03:47:01.850]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[03:47:02.010 --> 03:47:03.090]  Thanks for your support.
[03:47:03.350 --> 03:47:04.569]  God bless and good luck.
[03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:08.770]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.709]  Thank you so much.
[03:47:42.559 --> 03:47:45.020]  Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:47.399]  You're listening to Alex Jones Live.
[03:47:57.540 --> 03:48:00.879]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:04.040]  Viva Fry is a popular talk show.
[03:48:04.239 --> 03:48:06.559]  His former lawyer, really smart guy, co-host Robert Barnes.
[03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:14.950]  I would love to just get him on about the epicness of the Trump win and what the deep state's doing and the latest news, the big developments there, and I want him to speak to that in the time we have with him.
[03:48:15.569 --> 03:48:22.370]  But he's followed the whole Sandy Hook litigation against me, the deep state being involved, all of it confirmed, mainstream news now.
[03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:24.229]  Now the bankruptcy...
[03:48:25.049 --> 03:48:28.989]  Them changing the auction from public two days before.
[03:48:29.129 --> 03:48:31.469]  Everybody certified and paid and put down their down payments.
[03:48:31.729 --> 03:48:35.149]  And then saying suddenly, oh, we can actually pick lower bids if we want.
[03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:37.809]  And just doing a lot of really weird stuff.
[03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:43.729]  And then now we learn not even paying money, pledging the money that I owe them in lawsuits.
[03:48:45.260 --> 03:48:47.520]  To buying my company, even though that's on appeal.
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  I've talked to lawyers.
[03:48:49.059 --> 03:48:49.940]  They said they never said anything like it.
[03:48:50.020 --> 03:48:50.739]  It's cut and dry.
[03:48:51.600 --> 03:48:52.479]  Not lawful.
[03:48:53.780 --> 03:49:00.579]  And they're just hoping under the power of the court, we filed an emergency thing this morning.
[03:49:00.579 --> 03:49:13.500]  We'll see what the judge does in Judge Chris Lopez's court in Houston to stop this because real people came in to be part of this Auction, and they bid more, and they said, sorry, you don't.
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:15.799]  And the media, NBC, ABC, they're all calling it.
[03:49:15.959 --> 03:49:17.420]  It wasn't the highest bid.
[03:49:17.420 --> 03:49:19.680]  It was the best bid.
[03:49:20.200 --> 03:49:23.100]  That's like half pregnant or two men can have a baby.
[03:49:23.219 --> 03:49:24.520]  I mean, it's called bullshit.
[03:49:25.500 --> 03:49:30.659]  So Viva Fry, looking at this, what in the world do you make of this?
[03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:45.020]  And then they just, service providers, they just cut off the stuff and While we were there, and so it wasn't even usable, even though I'm telling them, hey, I'm going to challenge this in court.
[03:49:46.159 --> 03:49:55.090]  They told folks I was working with when they were going to be buyers that they wouldn't get it for a month if they won the bid, but these guys get it The next morning.
[03:49:55.430 --> 03:49:57.209]  And we're told while it's happening.
[03:49:57.670 --> 03:50:00.290]  So really aggressive sneak attack stuff.
[03:50:00.569 --> 03:50:08.090]  I mean, folks, if I wanted to give them trouble, I'd have started just shooting live off my phone there and call everybody out of the studio to have a giant protest, which I didn't do.
[03:50:08.290 --> 03:50:09.590]  And I'm not saying at this point.
[03:50:10.530 --> 03:50:12.930]  But I mean, just wild.
[03:50:13.170 --> 03:50:15.329]  It's like the nicer we are, the more they do this.
[03:50:15.409 --> 03:50:16.729]  Of course, you know, remember late May.
[03:50:17.959 --> 03:50:18.899]  People couldn't believe it then.
[03:50:19.260 --> 03:50:26.059]  Weeks later in court, the judge fired the federal trustee that had been assigned by the feds and the CRO and said, you shouldn't have done that.
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:26.979]  You shouldn't have tried to close it.
[03:50:27.020 --> 03:50:27.540]  What are you doing?
[03:50:28.719 --> 03:50:29.680]  And they had no reason.
[03:50:30.459 --> 03:50:32.200]  And people couldn't believe it when I warned them.
[03:50:32.260 --> 03:50:32.959]  And then it came out in court.
[03:50:32.979 --> 03:50:33.520]  It was true.
[03:50:33.879 --> 03:50:36.739]  Well, now, in my view, we see something else like this.
[03:50:39.090 --> 03:50:40.790]  But I don't even know what to say.
[03:50:40.909 --> 03:50:44.290]  It just shows the climate of hysteria by the establishment right now.
[03:50:45.069 --> 03:50:48.969]  Viva Farai, you always make excellent salient points that really are thought-provoking.
[03:50:49.209 --> 03:50:50.930]  I just can't wait to hear your view on this.
[03:50:56.590 --> 03:50:58.530]  Yeah, we're having another audio problem, Viva.
[03:50:58.770 --> 03:50:59.950]  Have you muted yourself?
[03:51:01.329 --> 03:51:03.010]  Or is your thing coming through there?
[03:51:04.709 --> 03:51:05.670]  Let me try one more time.
[03:51:06.209 --> 03:51:06.790]  Go ahead, Viva.
[03:51:10.069 --> 03:51:10.649]  I believe it.
[03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.729]  Okay.
[03:51:11.530 --> 03:51:11.889]  All right.
[03:51:11.930 --> 03:51:14.469]  Well, now it's on the default mic, but we'll leave it.
[03:51:14.530 --> 03:51:14.829]  It's good enough.
[03:51:14.889 --> 03:51:15.510]  You can hear me, right?
[03:51:15.569 --> 03:51:15.889]  You know what?
[03:51:16.069 --> 03:51:17.069]  Hey, Viva, it's okay.
[03:51:17.290 --> 03:51:18.010]  Let's give you a moment.
[03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:20.709]  We want to hear your full, rich, amazing voice.
[03:51:20.909 --> 03:51:21.750]  You're having an issue.
[03:51:21.989 --> 03:51:23.170]  I'm just glad it's not us.
[03:51:23.790 --> 03:51:26.489]  And so this is the beauty of us talking to you in Florida and you're here.
[03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:28.149]  You want to put it back to your microphone?
[03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:29.670]  Mic check one, two.
[03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:30.309]  Can you hear me now?
[03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:31.149]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[03:51:31.819 --> 03:51:32.680]  Okay, perfect.
[03:51:33.159 --> 03:51:38.319]  Alex, what I was going to say is, so I don't know what's going on in the weeds of the auction process.
[03:51:38.440 --> 03:51:43.319]  I know that Roger Stone was talking about putting together a coalition to buy the assets of Infowars.
[03:51:44.159 --> 03:51:50.719]  They're going to say, for other good and valuable consideration, which meant that we didn't accept the highest bid, this is not like...
[03:51:51.280 --> 03:51:52.719]  A very complicated process here.
[03:51:52.879 --> 03:52:00.020]  This is a maximum value for the best interests, allegedly, of the plaintiffs or those who are judgment creditors.
[03:52:00.219 --> 03:52:10.079]  What's clear from this, and it's been clear from the beginning, the goal was never to maximize any execution of a judgment for and on behalf of the judgment creditors.
[03:52:10.159 --> 03:52:12.020]  It was to shut you down and shut you up.
[03:52:12.159 --> 03:52:32.069]  And what's clear is that the lawyers in this file, and whatever political interests that be that started this, We're good to go.
[03:52:39.620 --> 03:52:54.899]  What they are doing right now is going to yield them, if anything, pennies on the dollar for what settlement offer was on the table, which would have been to the benefit of the judgment creditors, that being the plaintiffs who, you know, they law fared their way into a ridiculous judgment, but we're not at that stage anymore.
[03:52:55.399 --> 03:52:58.940]  What this is right now is nothing shy of just shutting you up and shutting you down.
[03:52:59.260 --> 03:53:14.700]  And if The Onion is in fact the entity taking over InfoWars, an attempt to just erase the history of InfoWars by merging it into what is going to be a future of bad satire through The Onion, so that when people think of InfoWars as a brand,
[03:53:14.899 --> 03:53:23.500]  they're going to think of bad satire as of The Onion and not what InfoWars was, which was radically more accurate news and information than all of the legacy media combined.
[03:53:45.170 --> 03:53:48.530]  It's just wild.
[03:53:50.739 --> 03:53:52.120]  I mean, I say unlawful.
[03:53:52.219 --> 03:53:59.729]  I think the entire process, I believe, should get overturned on appeal because People don't know, but everyone watching your show knows you had no trial.
[03:53:59.969 --> 03:54:10.649]  This was a show trial in a literal sense, but even then only on the quantum of how much you were ordered to pay, because you were defaulted into a liability finding with no trial and no proof of whatsoever.
[03:54:11.069 --> 03:54:17.250]  But the shutting you down now, while this is all under appeal, it's a legislative problem in Texas.
[03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:20.469]  But what the trustee is trying to do right now, it's obvious.
[03:54:20.799 --> 03:54:26.739]  They have no interest in actually maximizing what the plaintiffs can execute against by way of assets.
[03:54:26.959 --> 03:54:32.040]  Because in fairness, InfoWars is not going to be worth anything if you are not part of it.
[03:54:32.159 --> 03:54:34.280]  It's going to be like James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:54:34.840 --> 03:54:37.979]  Nobody's stuck to Project Veritas because of Project Veritas.
[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:41.799]  They were there because of James O'Keefe and the faith they had in James O'Keefe.
[03:54:41.879 --> 03:54:46.360]  When he leaves or when he was booted out, Project Veritas, the value drops to zero, nil.
[03:54:46.690 --> 03:54:47.850]  Same thing with Infowars.
[03:54:48.209 --> 03:54:56.549]  The Onion's going to get some cameras and a nice studio, cents on the dollar compared to the settlement discussions that were floating around, which would have yielded millions of dollars.
[03:54:56.569 --> 03:55:02.489]  I think totally wrongly under the legal process, but would have yielded millions of dollars to the plaintiffs.
[03:55:02.959 --> 03:55:04.159]  So it's clear what they're trying to do.
[03:55:04.360 --> 03:55:05.719]  I don't know how they can do it legally.
[03:55:05.719 --> 03:55:07.739]  I don't know what the judge is going to do when he sees what's going on here.
[03:55:07.899 --> 03:55:12.600]  I thought the judge would have had to authorize any meaningful liquidation of the assets.
[03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:16.440]  Certainly, the settlement, I thought the judge would have to authorize it in bankruptcy.
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:17.319]  So we'll see what he says.
[03:55:17.809 --> 03:55:23.770]  But, you know, to try to erase your legacy, which is what they wanted to do when they wanted your name, your voice, your brand.
[03:55:24.010 --> 03:55:29.030]  They want to erase the legacy of InfoWars and turn it into a joke, a bad joke that is The Onion.
[03:55:29.270 --> 03:55:33.629]  I mean, I read The Onion's explanation as to why they bought it out, and it's quite clear.
[03:55:33.629 --> 03:55:35.649]  It's to humiliate the legacy of InfoWars.
[03:55:35.909 --> 03:55:45.450]  They're not going to make a penny on it, nor are they going to really get any meaningful settlement for their clients, but it is to destroy InfoWars, its legacy, and your legacy as well.
[03:55:46.399 --> 03:55:50.399]  Well, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that's going to backfire with the Streisand effect.
[03:55:51.020 --> 03:55:52.379]  It's just going to piss people off.
[03:55:52.479 --> 03:55:55.200]  Do they not see the political climate, not just here, but around the world?
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:56:01.799]  Do you agree with that statement A? And then B, how would you describe what I'm calling a total global political realignment against the establishment?
[03:56:02.769 --> 03:56:04.729]  Well, I'm going to go with the Steve Banyan.
[03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:08.969]  This is like the dying gasps of a regime that's on its way out.
[03:56:09.090 --> 03:56:10.649]  It's an act of pure desperation.
[03:56:10.950 --> 03:56:22.090]  Get it done now before everything changes come January 20th and there's a new administration where, albeit these are happening at the state level, it's not a federal issue necessarily, but the political climate is going to change.
[03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:24.549]  So it's an act of pure desperation.
[03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:30.989]  But there's not much more to say about that, but the backlash, this is the problem.
[03:56:31.989 --> 03:56:43.610]  In as much as anybody had sympathy or has sympathy for the families of the Sandy Hook victims, A, the sympathy is legitimate and understandable, but the blame on you is not.
[03:56:43.729 --> 03:56:52.149]  That was already irritating a lot of people where they see you as being the scapegoat from the actual culprits, those actually responsible for the atrocity that occurred on that day.
[03:56:52.510 --> 03:56:55.690]  But what do they think it's going to do to shut down Infowars?
[03:56:55.770 --> 03:56:59.950]  I mean, it's going to generate a backlash of animosity towards the plaintiffs.
[03:57:00.530 --> 03:57:02.850]  The old expression, this is why we can't have nice things.
[03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:16.930]  They're taking away Infowars to however many millions of active followers you have, and what do they think that's going to generate by way of backlash from It's like, all right, it's an atrocity what happened.
[03:57:17.129 --> 03:57:19.629]  What you're doing right now is not going to remedy that.
[03:57:19.729 --> 03:57:21.909]  It's not even going to prevent it on a going forward basis.
[03:57:22.290 --> 03:57:32.280]  You are just going to deprive True Americans of their access to information and what do you think they're going to think of the people who are responsible for having done that?
[03:57:32.680 --> 03:57:37.620]  If the blame were to stay only with the lawyers and the onion, it would be one thing, but it won't.
[03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:52.370]  And people are going to see this as lawfare, abusive litigants Who are now depriving millions, tens of millions of people of their access to First Amendment right information coming from you in the entity that you built up.
[03:57:52.489 --> 03:57:55.370]  So it's not going to generate sympathy for the parents or for the plaintiffs.
[03:57:55.430 --> 03:57:56.329]  That's a big problem.
[03:57:56.530 --> 03:57:58.909]  And I don't know that they fully appreciate that.
[03:58:00.340 --> 03:58:00.700]  Absolutely.
[03:58:01.079 --> 03:58:03.219]  It turns out Lopez had an emergency hearing.
[03:58:03.399 --> 03:58:04.579]  It's been going for 30 minutes.
[03:58:05.500 --> 03:58:08.440]  My lawyers were contacting me to say, don't air the Lopez hearing.
[03:58:08.559 --> 03:58:09.379]  I've never aired a hearing.
[03:58:09.700 --> 03:58:11.459]  These hearings, they bring in the HBO cameras.
[03:58:11.559 --> 03:58:15.079]  You're not supposed to tape or have a federal hearing, even though the left's been caught doing it.
[03:58:15.620 --> 03:58:20.639]  But I'm told that the U.S. trustee is being raked over the coals right now in court.
[03:58:21.420 --> 03:58:26.979]  Because I'm not a lawyer, but before I even heard all this, when I heard what they did, I talked to the U.S. trustee this morning.
[03:58:28.059 --> 03:58:33.639]  At like, well, not a lot, 9.30 for about 20 minutes in front of witnesses.
[03:58:34.379 --> 03:58:38.100]  And he said, well, we don't have to do the biggest bid.
[03:58:38.200 --> 03:58:39.440]  You know, we can do whatever we think is best.
[03:58:39.600 --> 03:58:45.500]  And we're pledging, you know, your future earnings towards the purchase.
[03:58:46.399 --> 03:58:53.620]  So the Connecticut people pledged their judgment on me that's on appeal to To buy it.
[03:58:54.239 --> 03:58:55.879]  And they put in a lower number.
[03:58:56.319 --> 03:58:58.299]  And valued it in a lower number.
[03:58:59.299 --> 03:59:02.280]  And since when do you say you're having a public...
[03:59:03.120 --> 03:59:10.040]  Auction that months ago under federal law and rules with a big online top company that's legitimate, they file it.
[03:59:10.520 --> 03:59:12.479]  They tell everybody you've got to do a nondisclosure.
[03:59:12.799 --> 03:59:14.420]  You've got to show you've got money.
[03:59:14.600 --> 03:59:15.920]  You've got to fill all these forms.
[03:59:16.139 --> 03:59:18.500]  Then they say that November 8th is the last day to put in your bid.
[03:59:18.680 --> 03:59:27.280]  Then on November 11th at 2 o'clock in the afternoon central, they send an email to everybody saying, well, now it's a closed bid and we don't have to take the largest bid.
[03:59:27.520 --> 03:59:29.479]  And you have until 10 a.m.
[03:59:29.819 --> 03:59:30.459]  on November 11th.
[03:59:32.159 --> 03:59:35.799]  And then we'll open the envelopes at 1030 and then we'll announce the winner at some point.
[03:59:36.440 --> 03:59:38.200]  But we reserve the right to give this money for cheaper.
[03:59:38.760 --> 03:59:40.620]  And it just smacked to me.
[03:59:40.819 --> 03:59:41.799]  And I said, that's it.
[03:59:43.190 --> 03:59:44.250]  It's an inside deal.
[03:59:44.569 --> 03:59:45.729]  Everyone said, don't be paranoid.
[03:59:45.889 --> 03:59:46.430]  It doesn't look good.
[03:59:46.450 --> 03:59:47.049]  It is crazy.
[03:59:48.069 --> 03:59:49.709]  I came and got the crew here at the new studios.
[03:59:49.770 --> 03:59:51.329]  I said, we'll be off by Thursday morning.
[03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:52.670]  I figured it'd take them a day.
[03:59:52.829 --> 03:59:54.110]  I said, they'll sneak attack in the morning.
[03:59:54.290 --> 03:59:55.129]  I called it as usual.
[03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:57.709]  And there we are.
[03:59:58.250 --> 03:59:59.610]  So, I mean, what is that?
[03:59:59.770 --> 04:00:03.270]  I know you can't speak to it from law because you haven't read all the documents, but that's what's going on, Viva.
[04:00:03.920 --> 04:00:16.559]  Well, I mean, if my understanding is correct, I hope the trustee gets, you know, raked over the proverbial legal coals because you can imagine a situation in which you say, I'm not going to accept the highest bid, but there's other reasons for it.
[04:00:16.620 --> 04:00:18.200]  Like, just take a very, very easy example.
[04:00:18.399 --> 04:00:48.950]  You get a massive bid for an electric car company and a lesser bid coming from Elon Musk and Tesla, and then you'll say, well, in bankruptcy, this might work better because even though it's not the highest bid, the expertise of the entity is value added that's not, you know, I don't
[04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:49.450]  know.
[04:00:50.040 --> 04:00:51.739]  They said it during your trial.
[04:00:51.899 --> 04:00:53.260]  I mean, the goal is to shut you up.
[04:00:53.399 --> 04:00:56.760]  It's not for any form of whatever justice they feel can be...
[04:00:56.760 --> 04:01:00.180]  And the law says that only justice civil is money, but they don't want the justice.
[04:01:00.399 --> 04:01:01.180]  They want this.
[04:01:02.879 --> 04:01:04.000]  It's obvious they want this.
[04:01:04.100 --> 04:01:07.739]  But, Alex, not to put any more, you know, conspiratorial thoughts in your head.
[04:01:07.940 --> 04:01:18.600]  If this were not to get overturned, my immediate reaction and my immediate reflex was they're going to go after you anywhere and everywhere you go in any way, shape, or form and argue that...
[04:01:18.659 --> 04:01:36.659]  You are, by doing what you're doing, like set up another entity, set up another social media account, set up another Infowars 2, don't call it Infowars 2, but set up another platform, and they will argue that you are siphoning proceeds, profits from Infowars by virtue of your conduct, thus depriving the plaintiffs of the value of what they purchased.
[04:01:36.819 --> 04:01:40.860]  And they're going to try to shut you down or claim you wherever you go in any way, shape, or form.
[04:01:40.979 --> 04:01:42.840]  People are going to cry First Amendment violation.
[04:01:43.120 --> 04:01:45.479]  Everything about your trial was a First Amendment violation.
[04:01:45.579 --> 04:01:47.219]  They're not going to stop at there.
[04:01:47.720 --> 04:01:58.219]  So, you know, if this does not get overturned and they take over Infowars for pennies on the dollar and run it into the ground, which they're going to do, I have a bad feeling they're going to come after you at any entity that you set up.
[04:01:58.219 --> 04:02:00.739]  No, no, they've said they will, but they throw their legal case out the window.
[04:02:00.840 --> 04:02:01.420]  There's no case there.
[04:02:01.739 --> 04:02:05.000]  By saying, we don't want money, we don't want a settlement, we want him shut down.
[04:02:05.020 --> 04:02:08.899]  So they want to kill the thing that would make him money, but then they can, oh, but say, you owe us money.
[04:02:08.940 --> 04:02:09.719]  They're already saying that.
[04:02:09.840 --> 04:02:10.739]  The issue is...
[04:02:11.040 --> 04:02:15.020]  If I'm a baseball player and I've gone bankrupt, they can't stop me from going to a new baseball team.
[04:02:15.200 --> 04:02:18.020]  The baseball team under federal law, they can't get my paycheck.
[04:02:18.020 --> 04:02:19.340]  They can try to get it once I have it.
[04:02:19.680 --> 04:02:24.239]  So the Alex Jones Network is not owned by Alex Jones, and all these other people that want me to work for them aren't.
[04:02:24.399 --> 04:02:38.479]  And so the idea that they said in federal filings, we pulled the articles, they want to own the name Alex Jones, they want to own my likeness, And they said the 13th Amendment against slavery does not applaud Alex Jones in the filing a month ago.
[04:02:38.760 --> 04:02:39.379]  Bloomberg had it.
[04:02:39.479 --> 04:02:40.340]  You can read it in there, folks.
[04:02:40.459 --> 04:02:41.280]  And I've shown the filing.
[04:02:41.479 --> 04:02:42.700]  I mean, this is next level.
[04:02:44.650 --> 04:02:49.969]  It is, but the fact that it might not be lawful doesn't mean they're not going to try to do it.
[04:02:50.149 --> 04:02:53.290]  And I don't want to give the scoundrels any more ideas, but I don't need to.
[04:02:53.430 --> 04:02:54.690]  They are more creative than me.
[04:02:55.069 --> 04:02:59.370]  They'll just go after any entity that makes money off of you being affiliated with them.
[04:02:59.489 --> 04:03:02.989]  You'll have your homestead protection in Texas, and whatever minimums can't be seized.
[04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:11.969]  But they'll go after any entity that continues to monetize you in a way that they say, or allege, siphons off the value of Infowars.
[04:03:12.319 --> 04:03:13.479]  Let me stop you.
[04:03:13.620 --> 04:03:14.579]  I'm going to say this.
[04:03:15.200 --> 04:03:19.260]  The person I'm talking to has never been wrong in the hearings, but this could be a first.
[04:03:19.540 --> 04:03:21.000]  Lopez, I don't think, is a crook.
[04:03:21.100 --> 04:03:25.200]  He's done us no favors, but he's followed the law, and he's discovered more as this happens.
[04:03:28.680 --> 04:03:30.879]  Sissack is raking Murray over the coals.
[04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:31.940]  Lopez is listening.
[04:03:33.159 --> 04:03:34.540]  Not going well for Murray.
[04:03:34.879 --> 04:03:35.899]  Likely to be overturned.
[04:03:36.059 --> 04:03:38.379]  Lopez is not happy.
[04:03:42.779 --> 04:03:46.020]  Can you imagine if they do this and he doesn't certify it?
[04:03:46.120 --> 04:03:47.260]  Which if he does, he sort of...
[04:03:47.260 --> 04:03:48.479]  I mean, this is cut and dry, my word.
[04:03:49.139 --> 04:03:53.219]  They pledged my money that's on appeal under law.
[04:03:53.319 --> 04:03:54.120]  You can't do that.
[04:03:54.620 --> 04:03:57.559]  Like it's Confederate notes from 1863.
[04:03:57.940 --> 04:03:58.840]  They're literally...
[04:03:58.840 --> 04:04:01.979]  Or Weimar notes or Zimbabwe billion-dollar notes.
[04:04:02.120 --> 04:04:03.200]  There's no value there.
[04:04:03.440 --> 04:04:08.780]  You cannot pledge a judgment in the purchase of the thing you're trying to take.
[04:04:10.180 --> 04:04:19.079]  I would love to see—I don't know if it's going to get into any form of sanctions or discovery as to what the process was or the thought process leading up to this.
[04:04:19.319 --> 04:04:22.840]  But not to get ahead of ourselves, see what Judge Lopez says.
[04:04:22.920 --> 04:04:23.979]  But you are right about the judge.
[04:04:24.399 --> 04:04:33.100]  Lopez, in particular, deserves credit for not being a politicized partisan hack in the conduct of the federal bankruptcy.
[04:04:33.520 --> 04:04:34.860]  But see what he says.
[04:04:35.239 --> 04:04:50.440]  Bottom line is, it was clearly contrary to the best interests of the judgment creditors for no better reason other than the underlying political motive that has been vocalized by those lawyers in open court to judge, I forget her name now,
[04:04:50.479 --> 04:04:51.139]  the one in Texas.
[04:04:52.079 --> 04:04:53.340]  Guerra Gamble.
[04:04:55.819 --> 04:04:56.600]  Say it again?
[04:04:56.760 --> 04:04:57.719]  Guerra Gamble.
[04:04:58.799 --> 04:05:02.479]  Was that the name of the judge, the one who had the cameras on her?
[04:05:02.959 --> 04:05:03.680]  No, no, no.
[04:05:03.739 --> 04:05:04.739]  HBO ran it.
[04:05:05.040 --> 04:05:06.840]  It was all a show.
[04:05:07.219 --> 04:05:08.959]  And HBO ran the one in Connecticut.
[04:05:09.810 --> 04:05:10.450]  Barbara Bella.
[04:05:11.090 --> 04:05:16.270]  Do you remember when she said, do you think this is a show trial?
[04:05:16.430 --> 04:05:18.690]  And you're like, yeah, it's literally a show trial.
[04:05:18.809 --> 04:05:21.270]  There's cameras in here making a documentary.
[04:05:22.170 --> 04:05:25.510]  If it's as unlawful as I think it is, there should be sanctions.
[04:05:25.649 --> 04:05:27.250]  The only question is what the judge is going to do.
[04:05:27.610 --> 04:05:28.790]  Appoint another trustee.
[04:05:28.909 --> 04:05:30.709]  I don't know in this.
[04:05:31.290 --> 04:05:32.350]  Here's what's crazier.
[04:05:33.709 --> 04:05:34.790]  We didn't do it.
[04:05:35.469 --> 04:05:36.530]  And we already knew what was going to happen.
[04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:40.489]  So we already had satellite uplinks that were turned on today, already paid and ready.
[04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:44.590]  But we had to contact hundreds of radio stations and TV stations to tell them, hey, here's the new feed.
[04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:47.049]  Somebody turned the feed off.
[04:05:47.209 --> 04:05:53.610]  So imagine the damage to the company that somebody's in there turning stuff off.
[04:05:54.270 --> 04:05:58.729]  And then if the judge says that's wrong, I mean, what a fiasco.
[04:05:59.600 --> 04:06:06.680]  Well, the problem is, with the ability to execute on a judgment notwithstanding an appeal under Texas law, the damage will be done.
[04:06:07.059 --> 04:06:11.479]  I mean, it may or may not be irreparable, but it's certainly going to be pretty darn close, especially...
[04:06:11.479 --> 04:06:12.139]  Yeah, that's the big question.
[04:06:12.139 --> 04:06:18.059]  If I win the appeal, and they're sure the Supreme Court of Texas will overturn it, Connecticut, even though it's horrible, will probably let it go, but the Supreme Court, if they take it, will win.
[04:06:18.159 --> 04:06:18.959]  So that's a gamble.
[04:06:19.040 --> 04:06:19.479]  But it doesn't matter.
[04:06:19.520 --> 04:06:20.059]  I'm never getting it up.
[04:06:20.280 --> 04:06:22.979]  The point is, is that that's what they've all said.
[04:06:23.000 --> 04:06:24.760]  If it's all shut down or sold...
[04:06:25.840 --> 04:06:29.780]  Then, under Texas law, they will have to give me the money back with damages.
[04:06:32.079 --> 04:06:47.639]  I doubt they'll have that, but then it'll be like sort of a parlor-type situation where if it's shut down and, okay, you win on appeal in a few months and you get to take all the controls back, build it back up, you won't have a problem doing that because even your support is just absolutely organic,
[04:06:47.639 --> 04:06:48.520]  built over decades.
[04:06:48.739 --> 04:06:49.840]  But you're starting from...
[04:06:50.579 --> 04:06:54.360]  Having the value of whatever cut in a substantial portion.
[04:06:54.559 --> 04:06:58.139]  So you've got to start building back from the rubble, not from the ashes.
[04:06:58.399 --> 04:07:00.780]  But the damage will be done one way or the other.
[04:07:00.899 --> 04:07:02.959]  They're just trying to do as much damage as humanly possible.
[04:07:03.180 --> 04:07:05.040]  I suspect because they know...
[04:07:05.040 --> 04:07:14.639]  I want to say they know that the political tide is changing, the public opinion is changing, and I think that they also know that they have some serious, serious issues on appeal.
[04:07:15.129 --> 04:07:26.190]  Not the least of which is every rule of law, every rule of First Amendment rights, media protection, you know, legal standards were violated in this when they defaulted you into the liability finding.
[04:07:26.489 --> 04:07:35.370]  And then the wild, absolutely untenable 1.4 some odd billion dollar judgment against all of these defendants.
[04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:38.030]  Please continue, Eva Frye.
[04:07:38.129 --> 04:07:43.809]  And then I want to move into just general 35,000 of you, the world, the Trump win, the appointments, just your view on what's happening.
[04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:46.549]  It's amazing.
[04:07:47.270 --> 04:07:54.989]  I'm making the joke that I've never been into fantasy football, but I'm following these appointments, or at least the appointments until they get Senate confirmation.
[04:07:55.270 --> 04:07:55.950]  It's amazing.
[04:07:56.090 --> 04:07:59.049]  We're not going to be 100% on all of them.
[04:07:59.819 --> 04:08:05.340]  But there's been a shift in the zeitgeist where now you see the rats jumping ship, literally.
[04:08:05.600 --> 04:08:08.500]  Like the Joy Reads making their announcements, they're leaving Twitter.
[04:08:08.840 --> 04:08:09.379]  Who else?
[04:08:09.459 --> 04:08:10.819]  Don Lemon leaving Twitter.
[04:08:10.920 --> 04:08:15.420]  I'm like, yeah, Twitter's going to be a whole hell of a lot of a better place when it does itself cleaning.
[04:08:15.680 --> 04:08:17.680]  But there's been a shift in the political zeitgeist.
[04:08:17.799 --> 04:08:25.870]  The energy that was leading up to Trump's Third or second election, depending on who you ask, now being focused into his picks.
[04:08:26.069 --> 04:08:31.190]  And some of these picks are absolutely amazing, others less so, and some will be bad, I presume.
[04:08:31.409 --> 04:08:34.049]  I won't name the names of who I think are bad, but the great ones.
[04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:39.110]  Like Fetterman said yesterday, God-level trolling.
[04:08:39.659 --> 04:08:43.860]  To a point, or to name Matt Gaetz as Attorney General.
[04:08:44.079 --> 04:08:45.860]  Maybe not the most experienced one to pick.
[04:08:46.000 --> 04:08:48.440]  Maybe he doesn't get confirmed, and maybe there's a shift somewhere down the line.
[04:08:48.600 --> 04:09:01.739]  But the biggest of middle fingers to the people who have waged lawfare, not just against Donald Trump, but against Matt Gaetz, against the Steve Bannons, Peter Navarros, Manafort, Carter Page, you.
[04:09:02.000 --> 04:09:07.239]  It's the biggest middle finger to the system, and it's making them all freak out in real time and melt down because...
[04:09:07.920 --> 04:09:15.120]  These are people who will go no-holds-barred if given, you know, the keys to the closets that they're going to open up and expose all the skeletons of.
[04:09:15.379 --> 04:09:18.319]  Tulsi Gabbard, you know, amazing picks.
[04:09:18.600 --> 04:09:24.540]  Pete Hegseth, making people's heads roll and revealing people for the ignorant SOBs that they truly are.
[04:09:24.659 --> 04:09:37.399]  They only know Pete Hegseth from Fox News, and so they only assume he's just a Fox News host and don't appreciate his two-plus decades, two bronze stars, He has multiple awards for combat that he's a veteran.
[04:09:37.500 --> 04:09:38.079]  They don't know this.
[04:09:38.319 --> 04:09:44.319]  And so they expose themselves for the idiots that they are, the malicious propagandists that they are, and it really couldn't be any better.
[04:09:44.440 --> 04:09:46.159]  Oh yeah, I love this classic clip.
[04:09:46.299 --> 04:09:47.280]  It couldn't be any better.
[04:09:48.139 --> 04:09:54.000]  A number of these are rubbing in the faces of the people who had been in charge and had been abusing the populace.
[04:09:54.319 --> 04:09:56.840]  They're no longer in charge, and justice is coming.
[04:09:57.639 --> 04:10:00.639]  Just got this from my folks in the hearing with Lopez.
[04:10:01.020 --> 04:10:03.639]  Judge is upset about lack of transparency.
[04:10:03.639 --> 04:10:04.540]  Just said that.
[04:10:04.840 --> 04:10:05.819]  What's that mean?
[04:10:06.939 --> 04:10:10.040]  It means that all of this happened under the cloak of darkness.
[04:10:10.299 --> 04:10:14.000]  I presume, if it's anything, like I did some bankruptcy law up in Canada.
[04:10:14.139 --> 04:10:16.840]  For those watching, I actually practiced for like 13 years and did.
[04:10:17.000 --> 04:10:21.739]  I had a great bankruptcy case once because hell hath no fury like a lawyer unpaid.
[04:10:22.780 --> 04:10:28.540]  But typically, the judge has to approve of these things before you can start executing.
[04:10:29.129 --> 04:10:31.770]  And I presume Lopez is caught off guard.
[04:10:31.870 --> 04:10:37.010]  Like, I'm supposed to ratify any agreement, any settlement, any sale of the assets in bankruptcy.
[04:10:37.430 --> 04:10:42.309]  No, no, he said that a month ago they filed to take my name and Lopez said no.
[04:10:42.569 --> 04:10:44.909]  He said anything you do has to be approved by me.
[04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:46.629]  He said I want total transfer.
[04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:48.889]  And then they just hijacked and threw me out the building.
[04:10:50.240 --> 04:10:51.420]  It is wild.
[04:10:51.579 --> 04:11:00.540]  I wish I could have been there to see exactly what's going on, but just by the facts, as I understand them, as is sort of even being confirmed by the Onion guy, what's his name?
[04:11:01.920 --> 04:11:03.479]  Barabolt, whatever the guy's last name is.
[04:11:03.680 --> 04:11:05.579]  His name is Extremely Handsome Person.
[04:11:06.700 --> 04:11:07.579]  Is that what it means?
[04:11:07.819 --> 04:11:08.479]  No, I'm joking.
[04:11:08.659 --> 04:11:11.319]  You know, the guy looks like a toad that climbed out of Satan's ass.
[04:11:12.010 --> 04:11:14.930]  No, because his name does look like it could be mispronounced in a humorous way.
[04:11:15.909 --> 04:11:20.590]  You know, reading The Onion's explanation as to why they bought it, I mean, they're actually publicizing.
[04:11:20.770 --> 04:11:33.950]  They get ahead of themselves a little bit, but they might not have had full authorization to do this, and the reasons that they are, you know, out there propagating or promoting might not be the cleanest of motives to explain why they're buying this.
[04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.770]  Like, that...
[04:11:35.340 --> 04:11:42.020]  Peace in the onion might come back to haunt them because it sort of seems clear to me that they're not buying it for maximum value.
[04:11:42.100 --> 04:11:44.860]  They might be buying it for other political reasons.
[04:11:45.000 --> 04:11:46.280]  But no, it's clear.
[04:11:46.680 --> 04:11:51.860]  Something happened and the judge wasn't aware of it and judges do not like, you know, being made to look like fools.
[04:11:52.059 --> 04:11:52.239]  Period.
[04:11:53.079 --> 04:12:06.680]  Viva Fry, we've got Drew Hernandez coming up in about six, seven minutes, but I want to briefly, before we connect with him, have you make any other comments about Trump, America, the world, what you see happening, then the great Drew Hernandez, Roger Stone, Elijah Schaefer, Steve Manning.
[04:12:06.780 --> 04:12:07.760]  I've got to get General Flynn on.
[04:12:07.780 --> 04:12:08.379]  I'm going to call him.
[04:12:08.479 --> 04:12:08.959]  Stay with us.
[04:12:09.200 --> 04:12:10.780]  We're going commercial-free right now.
[04:12:11.200 --> 04:12:11.940]  We'll still have a free break.
[04:12:11.940 --> 04:12:12.360]  You know what I mean.
[04:12:22.479 --> 04:12:30.000]  Hey, this is Jeff with DMO Knives and we're proud to come back to you with our second partnership with Alex Jones.
[04:12:30.440 --> 04:12:41.840]  The DMO Outback Alex Jones Edition is 10.5 inches in total length, 5.10 blade length, and 11.8 ounces in total weight.
[04:12:42.239 --> 04:12:46.659]  The DMO Outback Alex Jones Edition will come to you in stone wash.
[04:12:46.879 --> 04:12:54.760]  We'll have solid black G10 composite handles inserted with Cerakote screws which are in the color of black as well.
[04:12:54.940 --> 04:12:57.219]  Alex Jones Signature on one side.
[04:12:57.459 --> 04:13:03.159]  And the answer to 1984 is 1776 on the other.
[04:13:03.559 --> 04:13:16.639]  This beautiful stonewashed outback starts as a piece of steel and we go through the grinding process, four steps of heat treatment among other things to get this Out the door to you in your hands as an everyday carry.
[04:13:16.899 --> 04:13:25.680]  The Stonewash Outback will come to you with your very own Kydex sheath for blade protection and we'll have a little belt attachment for you.
[04:13:25.860 --> 04:13:31.299]  You can attach to either side whichever draw that you would like to have coming off your waistline.

[04:14:00.860 --> 04:14:09.819]  But if you want to be a part of this particular partnership, Alex Jones and the Stonewash Outback, you need to go to dmonives.com and get yours today.
[04:14:10.079 --> 04:14:14.920]  American made by American people right here at our workshop in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[04:14:15.399 --> 04:14:17.600]  They are built to never fail the operator.
[04:14:52.579 --> 04:14:59.559]  Well, I gotta say, the crew has done a great job in a whole new system.
[04:15:02.610 --> 04:15:09.870]  We're good to go.
[04:15:20.010 --> 04:15:20.729]  If they want.
[04:15:20.850 --> 04:15:23.229]  And I said, the only reason you put that in there is pull some crap like that.
[04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:26.889]  They're not going to let people add bids, which is what an auction is.
[04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:29.409]  And it's all been kept secret.
[04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:30.569]  Everything we've been told is not true.
[04:15:30.809 --> 04:15:33.489]  The only person that's done anything to stop this so far is the judge.
[04:15:33.709 --> 04:15:45.889]  When they do outrageous stuff, like show up with no court order, We're good to go.
[04:15:59.309 --> 04:16:01.270]  It took two weeks, the 14th of June.
[04:16:01.690 --> 04:16:04.850]  The media was all there, 50 news cameras, CNN, ABC News.
[04:16:05.090 --> 04:16:06.309]  Jones is shut down today.
[04:16:06.930 --> 04:16:09.370]  And the judge said, no, it's his company, and you're fired.
[04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:12.290]  And then he said, I want total transparency on this auction.
[04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:13.370]  I want this done right.
[04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:14.530]  I want this ball.
[04:16:14.610 --> 04:16:15.829]  Oh, yes, sir, it's all there.
[04:16:15.909 --> 04:16:18.049]  And then last minute, ha, I have the authority of the court.
[04:16:18.270 --> 04:16:21.909]  And Chris Murray this morning was, you know, they were giving me the document, like, here's his authority.
[04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:22.969]  We have the authority for the auction.
[04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:24.649]  I go, you have the authority for an auction?
[04:16:24.670 --> 04:16:25.889]  I don't say this is an auction.
[04:16:28.390 --> 04:16:30.430]  And you didn't take the bigger bid?
[04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:36.309]  And then you're here when you told people that we had that were trying to buy it that it'll be a month till you get it?
[04:16:37.430 --> 04:16:39.229]  I mean, this is wild.
[04:16:39.350 --> 04:16:43.209]  I don't know how Lopez doesn't overturn this.
[04:16:43.569 --> 04:16:44.770]  If he doesn't...
[04:16:47.850 --> 04:16:52.110]  I will just be at a new low at what's happened to our country.
[04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:54.069]  He may just punt because it's just so insane.
[04:16:54.069 --> 04:16:56.209]  I don't know, but it sounds like that's not about to happen.
[04:16:56.780 --> 04:16:58.319]  The people that I've talked to have never been wrong.
[04:16:58.399 --> 04:17:00.579]  They said, this is like brutal.
[04:17:01.600 --> 04:17:02.879]  Whatever's going on there in that hearing.
[04:17:03.200 --> 04:17:06.100]  And again, I could be dialed in right now on video or audio listening to it.
[04:17:06.219 --> 04:17:06.620]  I'm not.
[04:17:06.739 --> 04:17:07.120]  We're not.
[04:17:08.479 --> 04:17:11.219]  Because we're busy here on air.
[04:17:12.120 --> 04:17:14.639]  But, you know, say your prayers here.
[04:17:14.819 --> 04:17:20.059]  But it just ratchets up the insanity each time to try to get us off air.
[04:17:20.299 --> 04:17:21.940]  So Viva Frye, we're only a few more minutes.
[04:17:22.000 --> 04:17:22.319]  We got to go.
[04:17:22.459 --> 04:17:24.139]  We got to connect with us.
[04:17:24.739 --> 04:17:36.010]  But Just in closing, a recap on that, any final comments, and then just a quick minute hosting here, five minutes on the big picture of the world, what you think the deep state's going to pull, the appointments, the rest of it.
[04:17:37.029 --> 04:17:42.969]  Okay, as relates to your case, the judge, I think he would have an easy out, which is, I'm not approving this.
[04:17:43.129 --> 04:17:45.190]  Go back and do the auction process again.
[04:17:45.530 --> 04:17:59.350]  And maybe even say, well, whoever's responsible for this, now I'm booting the trustee and we'll appoint a new one who's not going to defy my orders and who's going to act in the best interest of the actual judgment creditors, who seem to be the only real creditors in this case.
[04:18:00.780 --> 04:18:07.680]  There has to be something of a reckoning because we're seeing a little bit of a shift in the politics of the world right now, the politics of America.
[04:18:08.020 --> 04:18:20.579]  And we're seeing the fact that the majority of Americans are not cool with what's been going on, which is the weaponization of all aspects of the judiciary, of the legal process, the prosecutorial process, censorship.
[04:18:21.800 --> 04:18:29.299]  There needs to be some form of the courts getting involved in all of this and saying enough is enough and we're going to overturn these decisions because they're ridiculous.
[04:18:29.940 --> 04:18:45.479]  Your liability finding, violation of First Amendment rights, denial of journalistic rights, which have been recognized for decades because of some corrupt partisan judges, It's no longer politically palpable, and that's what this election,
[04:18:45.559 --> 04:18:46.299]  I think, has shown.
[04:18:46.540 --> 04:18:51.760]  I think while they're doing this right now, before, what are we, before January, I mean, I appreciate this was the timeframe.
[04:18:52.379 --> 04:19:08.959]  It's desperation to try to get as much damage done before things really start turning around, where judges don't feel that they have the political cloak of cover to render these insane decisions, to carry out these insane kangaroo court show trial trials,
[04:19:09.620 --> 04:19:11.600]  And, I mean, the courts have to step in.
[04:19:12.040 --> 04:19:19.360]  Appreciate that January 6th happened back in the day because the courts never got involved in 2020 the way they got involved in 2024.
[04:19:19.360 --> 04:19:22.120]  And so you can see the political shift in real time.
[04:19:22.520 --> 04:19:23.940]  Courts feel empowered to get involved.
[04:19:24.319 --> 04:19:26.760]  Judges feel empowered to carry out justice.
[04:19:27.840 --> 04:19:39.559]  If only because that's what the people are demanding and they're not putting up with Leticia James, New York nipple judge Engelron, corrupt judge Marchand out of New York, destroying states, destroying economies through their corruption.
[04:19:40.040 --> 04:19:49.719]  And so you were the canary in the coal mine and you might be the last one against whom they try to do this or at least get away with doing it because a new sheriff is in town and daddy's home come January 20th.
[04:19:50.340 --> 04:19:51.440]  What do I think?
[04:19:51.760 --> 04:20:02.799]  Merging this all together, you've got to continue with your appeals because the entire process, whether people think they hate you or love you, the trial was an absolute outrage in Connecticut and Texas.
[04:20:03.100 --> 04:20:09.639]  It needs to be overturned, if only for the precedent it sets for future journalists, even if they refuse to recognize you as a journalist.
[04:20:10.680 --> 04:20:17.819]  Trump coming in, Trump putting out the people who are going to scare out all of these rats that are remaining on the ship.
[04:20:18.180 --> 04:20:22.059]  It's like you said in your book, Alex, it's the great awakening.
[04:20:22.319 --> 04:20:27.559]  This is the moment where the awakening is there, but it's not time to let up, and it's not time to let off.
[04:20:27.639 --> 04:20:30.340]  It's time to shame the people who are responsible for this.
[04:20:30.579 --> 04:20:43.920]  Change the people who had a hand in it, and prosecute those who were the veritable RICO conspirators to violate civil rights, who destroyed the judicial system, who destroyed faith in the prosecutorial system.
[04:20:44.100 --> 04:20:52.319]  It's time to investigate and go after them, and that's what we're seeing is likely going to happen under the new presidency coming in January, and the people are already panicking.
[04:20:52.859 --> 04:21:03.659]  I'm filled with somewhat of a sense of optimism, except you are still the whipping post for the old regime, the Clinton regime, that is in its final days, as far as I can...
[04:21:03.659 --> 04:21:04.399]  Well, absolutely.
[04:21:05.739 --> 04:21:10.920]  Donald Trump and I, and some other folks as well, it's not a fun club to be in, but we're proud of it, for fighting tyranny.
[04:21:11.020 --> 04:21:13.180]  We're like the chew toy of these people.
[04:21:13.799 --> 04:21:20.979]  And it's like, the dog sits in the corner and just chews on it all day, and it'll lay you down for a minute and then bite you again, and it's like...
[04:21:21.600 --> 04:21:24.000]  And the craziest part is how they attach themselves to me.
[04:21:24.100 --> 04:21:25.680]  I didn't do any of the stuff they said.
[04:21:25.899 --> 04:21:29.399]  And they run around that I'm stalking them while I am being stalked.
[04:21:29.520 --> 04:21:31.399]  I mean, this is real stalking people.
[04:21:32.139 --> 04:21:40.059]  Well, Alex, I mean, everybody who followed the story at the time knew that the FBI agent who was awarded, what, 80, 90 million dollars?
[04:21:40.079 --> 04:21:40.100]  No, no, no.
[04:21:40.100 --> 04:21:41.319]  By the end of it, he got more.
[04:21:42.020 --> 04:21:42.579]  133 million.
[04:21:43.859 --> 04:21:48.420]  So $133 million for intentional infliction of emotional distress for a man who...
[04:21:48.420 --> 04:21:50.299]  I have no doubt he went through emotional distress because of what happened.
[04:21:50.299 --> 04:21:50.920]  Never said his name.
[04:21:50.979 --> 04:21:52.500]  I didn't know who he was until he sued me.
[04:21:52.540 --> 04:21:53.319]  None of my crew did.
[04:21:53.840 --> 04:21:57.700]  And the internet was already making its jokes about the guy.
[04:21:58.159 --> 04:22:02.020]  Any harassment had already been occurring before you even started.
[04:22:02.120 --> 04:22:03.700]  Everybody who followed the story knows that.
[04:22:04.059 --> 04:22:07.100]  But the bottom line is they manufacture narratives.
[04:22:07.100 --> 04:22:08.399]  They manufacture lies.
[04:22:08.579 --> 04:22:11.579]  And then the lie sticks with people longer than...
[04:22:12.739 --> 04:22:13.100]  Forever.
[04:22:13.500 --> 04:22:18.819]  And there's no amount of truth that can ever undo that belief that they have ingrained in their souls.
[04:22:19.020 --> 04:22:24.659]  And I'm likening it to Tulsi Gabbard back in the day when she was defamed as being a Russian asset.
[04:22:24.819 --> 04:22:30.700]  And then she went and sued Hillary Clinton, but she had to drop that suit because it was never going to go anywhere for a number of legal reasons.
[04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:48.010]  People still to this day believe that she's a Russian asset who colluded with Russia, is a chummy chummy with Putin, and they take to social media now to make that libelous, slanderous accusation against Tulsi Gabbard to say that somehow she's not deserving of an appointment to DNI, or that she's a risk to national security.
[04:22:48.370 --> 04:22:53.930]  And so people will, for the rest of their lives, Alex, believe the lies that they've been indoctrinated to believe about you.
[04:22:55.679 --> 04:22:57.959]  But it's the only silver lining in all of this.
[04:22:58.319 --> 04:23:07.620]  People now, at least more than ever, understand the dishonesty and the intellectual depravity of legacy media and of these politicians who have been in power for years.
[04:23:07.739 --> 04:23:08.780]  Oh yeah, perfectly said.
[04:23:08.940 --> 04:23:13.079]  And in closing, I saw a video yesterday and I was trending, the left was going around with this.
[04:23:13.299 --> 04:23:14.440]  I forgot to send it to the crew.
[04:23:14.899 --> 04:23:22.629]  But there is a Trump Street in London And then a Russia street, and they're by each other.
[04:23:22.629 --> 04:23:24.149]  They've been there forever.
[04:23:24.450 --> 04:23:26.670]  And they go, look, Trump, Russia.
[04:23:26.889 --> 04:23:28.129]  It trumps with Russia.
[04:23:28.370 --> 04:23:31.590]  This is crazy crap.
[04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:37.969]  Alex, if it's not mass formation psychosis, it's at the very least a psyop.
[04:23:38.579 --> 04:23:39.379]  Ten years.
[04:23:39.540 --> 04:23:41.739]  Ten years of being indoctrinated with something.
[04:23:41.899 --> 04:23:46.500]  You're not going to be unindoctrinated or whatever the word is for that.
[04:23:46.879 --> 04:23:47.280]  Deprogrammed.
[04:23:48.260 --> 04:23:48.899]  Deprogrammed is the word.
[04:23:49.000 --> 04:23:49.200]  Thank you.
[04:23:49.340 --> 04:23:51.680]  You're not going to be deprogrammed in a year.
[04:23:52.180 --> 04:23:53.520]  You might get there.
[04:23:53.559 --> 04:23:55.879]  Some people have been deprogrammed for the last few years.
[04:23:55.979 --> 04:23:59.920]  COVID did a good job deprogramming people who trusted the government to tell them the truth.
[04:24:00.579 --> 04:24:03.360]  But it's almost cultural that...
[04:24:03.719 --> 04:24:05.719]  It's gonna take so much time to undo this.
[04:24:05.840 --> 04:24:13.200]  But the bottom line, in the meantime, you, Trump, all of his allies, it's not an accident who has been maliciously persecuted.
[04:24:13.659 --> 04:24:14.620]  And it was for...
[04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:25.510]  What they thought was their political profit, but the greatest comeback in political history, defying all the odds, people are going to be deprogrammed.
[04:24:25.610 --> 04:24:36.809]  And when the skeletons are released from the closets under the new Trump presidency, people will not believe the degree to which every aspect of what we thought was a civil society had been weaponized for partisan political purposes.
[04:24:38.700 --> 04:24:40.020]  Viva Frye, thank you so much.
[04:24:40.100 --> 04:24:40.719]  We love you, brother.
[04:24:42.239 --> 04:24:43.799]  The court's not going back the other way.
[04:24:43.879 --> 04:24:44.579]  We'll see what happens.
[04:24:44.719 --> 04:24:45.840]  Regardless, we told the truth.
[04:24:46.040 --> 04:24:46.840]  This is historic.
[04:24:46.979 --> 04:24:47.639]  It'll only make us bigger.
[04:24:47.760 --> 04:24:53.639]  If the people understand what's happening and promote RealAlexJonesOnX at AJNLiveOnX, follow us there.
[04:24:53.840 --> 04:24:54.600]  Share the article.
[04:24:54.780 --> 04:24:55.239]  Share the videos.
[04:24:55.319 --> 04:24:55.879]  It belongs to people.
[04:24:55.979 --> 04:24:56.680]  It belongs to the world.
[04:24:57.139 --> 04:24:59.260]  Viva Frye, how did people find you, my friend?
[04:25:00.680 --> 04:25:02.340]  Well, VivaFry on Twitter.
[04:25:03.020 --> 04:25:07.739]  VivaBarnesLaw.locals.com for our amazing above-average law community out there.
[04:25:07.860 --> 04:25:08.899]  And VivaFry on Rumble.
[04:25:08.979 --> 04:25:13.379]  But if you put in VivaFry into the search engine and put in news or images, you'll get everything.
[04:25:13.639 --> 04:25:15.840]  Alex, you were...
[04:25:16.020 --> 04:25:23.040]  The canary in the coal mine, they de-platformed you before they de-platformed the president because they got away with it with an unlikable target.
[04:25:23.040 --> 04:25:24.200]  And I'm putting that in quotes.
[04:25:24.360 --> 04:25:28.319]  And then they made Trump unlikable so that when they did it to him, everyone had the same rationale.
[04:25:28.559 --> 04:25:33.819]  If you don't understand that this is programming to get you to willingly sign away your God-given rights...
[04:25:34.629 --> 04:25:40.290]  Hopefully you can be deprogrammed, but a lot more people than ever before are and continue to be deprogrammed in real time.
[04:25:40.430 --> 04:25:41.610]  So may it continue.
[04:25:42.170 --> 04:25:42.350]  All right.
[04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.870]  Thank you, sir.
[04:25:42.969 --> 04:25:43.629]  Talk to you soon.
[04:25:43.829 --> 04:25:45.290]  We're going to get Drew Hernandez on.
[04:25:45.409 --> 04:25:49.930]  Here's a quick little promo for something very exciting at thealexjonesstore.com.
[04:25:50.110 --> 04:25:53.049]  Everybody loved the sweepstakes for the super truck.
[04:25:53.190 --> 04:25:54.290]  We got another super truck for you.
[04:25:54.989 --> 04:25:55.770]  We're in a war.
[04:25:55.950 --> 04:25:56.370]  It's fun.
[04:25:56.469 --> 04:26:01.729]  Great products, great supplements, great t-shirts, great memorial fundraiser.
[04:26:03.690 --> 04:26:04.829]  Posters that are fundraisers.
[04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:05.870]  We need your help.
[04:26:06.209 --> 04:26:11.790]  I think we're important to fund just to, you know, get back at the globalists and keep us in the fight exposing things.
[04:26:11.930 --> 04:26:12.989]  I love you all for your support.
[04:26:13.190 --> 04:26:15.350]  Whatever you do, share the live feeds right now at Relox Jones.
[04:26:16.760 --> 04:26:23.239]  And obviously at AFN, at AJNLive, at AJNLive on X as well.
[04:26:23.360 --> 04:26:25.540]  A lot of folks, thousands following us every few minutes.
[04:26:26.280 --> 04:26:28.620]  People really wanting to find out what's being blocked.
[04:26:28.739 --> 04:26:30.719]  Drew Hernandez, he'll be with us in just a few minutes.
[04:26:30.799 --> 04:26:32.920]  Then Roger Stone coming up and so much more.
[04:26:33.420 --> 04:26:35.459]  Here's that quick breakdown about the new truck.
[04:26:36.200 --> 04:26:51.299]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[04:26:51.520 --> 04:26:54.559]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public.
[04:26:55.389 --> 04:27:00.709]  And people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[04:27:01.209 --> 04:27:05.090]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[04:27:05.190 --> 04:27:05.750]  Who knows?
[04:27:06.250 --> 04:27:08.709]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[04:27:08.989 --> 04:27:14.829]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty.
[04:27:15.520 --> 04:27:23.340]  Having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[04:27:23.620 --> 04:27:27.780]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at Infowars.
[04:27:27.899 --> 04:27:42.180]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjohnstore.com With incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network where we won't miss a beat.
[04:27:42.360 --> 04:27:56.940]  If you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at thealexjonesstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[04:27:57.350 --> 04:28:01.149]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[04:28:01.229 --> 04:28:02.510]  But that's going to get announced.
[04:28:02.629 --> 04:28:04.709]  The winner here in just a few days.
[04:28:04.829 --> 04:28:08.889]  And regardless of whether InfoWard is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[04:28:08.989 --> 04:28:10.530]  And so you'll see the winner of the announcement.
[04:28:10.530 --> 04:28:12.389]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[04:28:12.569 --> 04:28:13.489]  So now...
[04:28:13.870 --> 04:28:21.569]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:28:21.930 --> 04:28:27.450]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[04:28:27.649 --> 04:28:28.930]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[04:28:29.090 --> 04:28:30.049]  It's a beautiful truck.
[04:28:30.639 --> 04:28:35.979]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[04:28:36.159 --> 04:28:38.940]  And there's so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[04:29:19.620 --> 04:29:21.360]  And here is the amazing new offer.
[04:29:21.520 --> 04:29:25.899]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.

[04:30:36.409 --> 04:30:39.250]  Alright, that's powerful, but we're going to re-cut that ad.
[04:30:39.350 --> 04:30:40.149]  The audio's off.
[04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:43.530]  The truck's not, and the site's up there for you right now.
[04:30:45.629 --> 04:30:47.069]  She's a razor sharp.
[04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:53.729]  And she'll get her way to slice you apart.

[04:31:30.760 --> 04:31:32.540]  Yeah, we're moving through.
[04:31:43.980 --> 04:31:44.460]  1776.
[04:31:44.460 --> 04:31:45.899]  We're at a number 13.
[04:31:47.520 --> 04:31:48.899]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:31:52.010 --> 04:32:02.350]  The great Drew Hernandez, amazing talk show host, journalist, combat reporter from out there on the streets with Antiva at Drew HLive on X. What an epic day, Drew.
[04:32:02.450 --> 04:32:03.389]  And I want to interview you.
[04:32:03.430 --> 04:32:04.270]  I want to talk to you.
[04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:06.149]  But I've been on air since 8 a.m.
[04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.590]  this morning.
[04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:08.850]  I've got big developments, stuff coming in.
[04:32:08.909 --> 04:32:10.569]  I've got to get on the phone about what's happening in court right now.
[04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:11.610]  I want to get major updates.
[04:32:11.729 --> 04:32:12.450]  You've got the floor.
[04:32:12.610 --> 04:32:13.270]  I'll be right back.
[04:32:13.409 --> 04:32:14.090]  We love you.
[04:32:14.209 --> 04:32:15.629]  You are in command now, Admiral.
[04:32:17.289 --> 04:32:19.110]  Whatever you need, sir, we are here.
[04:32:19.129 --> 04:32:20.989]  We are here to assist you and help you.
[04:32:21.069 --> 04:32:22.270]  And it's good to see you happy, man.
[04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:23.610]  You know, it's good to see you healthy.
[04:32:23.610 --> 04:32:24.670]  It's good to see you at peace.
[04:32:24.690 --> 04:32:26.049]  I know it's stressful for sure.
[04:32:26.290 --> 04:32:27.889]  And shout out to the crew as well.
[04:32:28.049 --> 04:32:30.610]  All of you guys back there going from studio to studio.
[04:32:30.770 --> 04:32:34.559]  I've been watching the chats all day on X. On Rumble, everywhere.
[04:32:34.719 --> 04:32:35.940]  Everywhere you guys are streaming.
[04:32:36.659 --> 04:32:43.159]  And I just want you guys to know, behind the scenes, everyone that's working and that's stressed out right now, it's not going unnoticed.
[04:32:43.159 --> 04:32:44.100]  We're all watching.
[04:32:44.100 --> 04:32:45.200]  We're thankful for it.
[04:32:45.360 --> 04:32:46.899]  And I'm speaking as a viewer.
[04:32:47.420 --> 04:32:48.840]  I'm speaking as a viewer.
[04:32:49.680 --> 04:32:57.819]  But what I really did want to point out is, A, we'll get some updates from Alex right now when it comes to what's going on with this trial, but...
[04:32:58.219 --> 04:33:00.219]  I'll tell you, man, these people are making mistakes.
[04:33:00.219 --> 04:33:01.780]  They're making big mistakes.
[04:33:02.079 --> 04:33:04.180]  Everybody knows you don't piss off a judge.
[04:33:04.380 --> 04:33:06.099]  Like, that's just basic 101.
[04:33:06.759 --> 04:33:09.580]  Everybody knows that you don't go behind a judge's back.
[04:33:09.580 --> 04:33:11.400]  You don't defy the judge's orders.
[04:33:11.599 --> 04:33:20.200]  You don't piss off the judge so you get a judgment rendered back at you that is gonna hurt you and not be in your favor.
[04:33:20.610 --> 04:33:22.950]  Everybody goes into a courtroom with a smile on.
[04:33:23.090 --> 04:33:25.610]  Everybody goes into a courtroom with their best attire on.
[04:33:25.709 --> 04:33:31.630]  Everybody goes in with a positive attitude, so they might just get a positive attitude.
[04:33:32.719 --> 04:33:35.720]  Judgment or response and have a good day in court.
[04:33:35.959 --> 04:33:43.159]  Now, obviously, that may or may not happen in this situation, but from what I'm hearing is these people sound like, obviously, they're going to go rogue.
[04:33:43.340 --> 04:33:46.360]  They're going to do whatever they want, and that's what they're used to.
[04:33:46.599 --> 04:33:47.560]  That's their directive.
[04:33:47.740 --> 04:33:58.799]  That's their MO. They're used to all of these Soros, crooked prosecutors and judges and all of these DAs just doing whatever they want, especially these last four years.
[04:33:58.939 --> 04:34:00.619]  It's just like everything's been handed to them.
[04:34:00.720 --> 04:34:07.709]  I think it's part of the, like, DEI hire kind of participation trophy culture at the same time, mixed with evil.
[04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:09.509]  These people just do whatever they want, right?
[04:34:09.630 --> 04:34:10.590]  There's no consequences.
[04:34:10.590 --> 04:34:11.630]  There's no accountability.
[04:34:12.290 --> 04:34:18.150]  But you're going to run into somebody every now and then that's going to really get pissed off that you do that.
[04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:21.349]  And, you know, I kind of experienced this during the Rittenhouse trial.
[04:34:21.979 --> 04:34:24.540]  It kind of reminds me of this a little bit, kind of.
[04:34:24.840 --> 04:34:30.939]  But I remember when I testified in the Rittenhouse trial and I went in there, I think the judge was a Democrat.
[04:34:30.939 --> 04:34:32.119]  He wasn't a Republican.
[04:34:32.119 --> 04:34:36.540]  He wasn't a hard right-winger or anything like that or a known conservative.
[04:34:37.259 --> 04:34:45.700]  But I remember he was pissing Binger, the prosecutors against Kyle and all of the eyewitnesses that came in to testify.
[04:34:46.599 --> 04:34:52.759]  We saw this multiple times that Binger and the prosecutors that were going after Kyle just kept pissing off the judge.
[04:34:53.279 --> 04:34:56.299]  It almost became like a daily thing.
[04:34:56.959 --> 04:35:06.439]  And I remember when I went in and some people close to him just said, you know, just go in there and tell the truth and tell them what you saw.
[04:35:06.439 --> 04:35:10.419]  And he's probably going to attack you, but just let it happen, right?
[04:35:11.330 --> 04:35:14.270]  I just, you know, I went in there and that's exactly what happened.
[04:35:14.450 --> 04:35:22.349]  And every time I would try to talk or every time I would try to give my eyewitness testimony, never looked at the jury, not one time.
[04:35:22.349 --> 04:35:24.990]  To this day, I still don't know what any of those people look like.
[04:35:25.090 --> 04:35:26.209]  I didn't look once.
[04:35:27.060 --> 04:35:36.180]  But I remember every time the prosecutor, every time Binger tested the judge's patience, it backfired.
[04:35:36.240 --> 04:35:37.439]  And that may happen.
[04:35:37.520 --> 04:35:39.439]  It sounds like it's happening in this situation.
[04:35:39.560 --> 04:35:42.680]  Alex is going to get the updates, but all I know is...
[04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:48.470]  It's one thing you don't do, and it's you do not test the patience of a judge.
[04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:57.830]  And especially if he's on your, if you think he's on your side, I mean, even then, that's, I mean, I think Viva Price said that earlier in the last segment, is like, it doesn't matter.
[04:35:57.950 --> 04:36:06.590]  Judges do not like to have their patience tested, but at the same time, judges do not want somebody else doing their job for them.
[04:36:07.110 --> 04:36:10.490]  Like, who are you to sit there and think that you're running the show now?
[04:36:11.130 --> 04:36:14.029]  Who are you to sit there and think that you can call your own shots?
[04:36:14.590 --> 04:36:19.750]  Who are you to sit there and go behind my back, even if you think that we're on the same side?
[04:36:20.209 --> 04:36:24.209]  Who are you to start running the show without my knowledge?
[04:36:24.450 --> 04:36:26.970]  And I think any judge kind of feels that way, right?
[04:36:27.130 --> 04:36:30.430]  Even if they're enemy judges, that's not what I'm saying is happening in this case.
[04:36:30.430 --> 04:36:44.889]  I'm just saying A judge simply is not going to like the fact that everybody involved starts doing their own thing, creating their own laws, creating their own paths, rendering their own judgments, and rendering their own outcomes.
[04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:57.909]  I really think this right here This right here is what is happening, what has been happening to Infowars, what has been happening to people like Owen Schroyer, the J6 political prisoners, etc.
[04:36:58.450 --> 04:37:06.729]  Obviously, Alex Jones and everybody that's been hunted by this rogue federal government that hates everybody and that hates America that's totally anti-Christ.
[04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:18.650]  You know, you got to always remember, persecution, especially when you take a look at it from a biblical perspective, persecution is always, always going to have a dual effect.
[04:37:19.610 --> 04:37:25.569]  It's always going to spread the message and it's always going to create more of a following.
[04:37:25.970 --> 04:37:36.669]  It's always going to create more of a base and an audience that's watching that is going to want to support the persecuted, not the persecutor.
[04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:40.709]  There will be evil people that are calling for blood and they want to drink blood.
[04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:46.150]  They want to see your blood spray across the floor as you get executed and die.
[04:37:46.270 --> 04:37:47.669]  There will always be those people, right?
[04:37:48.380 --> 04:37:58.659]  But there's always going to be the audience that doesn't like what they're seeing, that doesn't think it's fair, that kind of puts themselves in that position, puts themselves in your shoes.
[04:37:58.919 --> 04:38:01.220]  And I think that happened big time with Trump.
[04:38:01.419 --> 04:38:02.279]  Actually, you know what?
[04:38:02.319 --> 04:38:04.240]  I know that happened big time with Trump.
[04:38:04.419 --> 04:38:21.060]  All of the lawfare, the indictments, the mugshots, the arraignments, the arrests, all the way up to them actually trying to blow his head off on J13. And just the ones we know about and also at this golf course in West Palm Beach,
[04:38:21.380 --> 04:38:22.939]  you know, that has an effect on people.
[04:38:23.099 --> 04:38:24.099]  It pisses people off.
[04:38:24.240 --> 04:38:29.700]  Not just your supporters, not just those that are going to be biased and always be there to support you, right?
[04:38:30.200 --> 04:38:36.799]  No, you got an audience out there that's watching this and they have somewhat of a moral code still inside of them.
[04:38:37.340 --> 04:38:41.840]  And they view you legitimately as a victim in this entire situation.
[04:38:41.919 --> 04:38:43.599]  Now you may not feel that way.
[04:38:43.720 --> 04:38:45.740]  You may not say, you know, I'm not playing the victim, man.
[04:38:45.860 --> 04:38:46.799]  I don't want to play that card.
[04:38:47.000 --> 04:38:48.200]  You know, I'm down to be a martyr.
[04:38:48.779 --> 04:38:49.060]  Exactly.
[04:38:49.599 --> 04:38:52.360]  But the audience views you as the victim still.
[04:38:52.459 --> 04:38:53.220]  They don't like it.
[04:38:53.439 --> 04:38:56.200]  And so these people are definitely...
[04:38:56.200 --> 04:39:00.560]  I think these are acts of desperation, for sure, because they know that daddy's home.
[04:39:01.119 --> 04:39:04.540]  And they know there's multiple new sheriffs in town, right?
[04:39:04.540 --> 04:39:18.479]  We got Matt Gaetz, and the big word on the street is you got some FBI directors, and you got some Secret Service director announcements being made soon, possibly, that's really gonna make some shockwaves.
[04:39:19.509 --> 04:39:21.310]  But the big one is that Trump won.
[04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:24.409]  And these people cannot wrap their minds around it.
[04:39:24.490 --> 04:39:27.450]  That's why they're going after the CEO of Polymarket last minute.
[04:39:28.450 --> 04:39:30.029]  Everybody that poses a threat.
[04:39:30.729 --> 04:39:44.729]  Everybody that has a target painted on them, and it's confirmed when the feds are surveilling you, or they go after you, or you end up getting thrown in prison, or you get censored, you get shadow banned, you get deplatformed.
[04:39:45.189 --> 04:39:50.770]  I mean, right now, in this day and age, in the United States of America, that's an indication that you're doing the right thing, right?
[04:39:51.490 --> 04:39:59.509]  And we get called terrorists, we get called criminals, we get called threats to democracy, when in a sense, they're kind of right, right?
[04:39:59.849 --> 04:40:01.490]  Just depending on how you look at it.
[04:40:02.110 --> 04:40:09.529]  I mean, we are a threat to a tyrannical communist regime, not via violence, but just via free speech.
[04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:12.709]  That's why they're going after Free Speech Systems LLC and trying to shut it down.
[04:40:12.869 --> 04:40:13.669]  It's that simple.
[04:40:14.400 --> 04:40:19.639]  And so if you actually pay attention to their terminology and how they explain things, it makes sense.
[04:40:19.759 --> 04:40:37.340]  Like, yeah, those that are in opposition towards our tyrannical regime, those that are in opposition to our New World Order plans to enslave humanity via technology and lawfare and every way we can think of and the media and psyoping everybody through intelligence agencies, yeah, you're going to be designated a terrorist.
[04:40:37.799 --> 04:40:38.500]  Yeah, you're a threat.
[04:40:38.500 --> 04:40:39.939]  You are definitely a threat.
[04:40:40.159 --> 04:40:43.200]  And if you're not, well, then what are you?
[04:40:44.200 --> 04:40:46.020]  And if you're not, well then what are you doing?
[04:40:46.259 --> 04:40:46.959]  What am I doing?
[04:40:48.389 --> 04:40:53.470]  If not, what actually is posing a threat to this regime?
[04:40:53.569 --> 04:40:54.650]  And I'm not talking violence.
[04:40:54.770 --> 04:40:56.029]  I'm not talking violence at all.
[04:40:56.250 --> 04:40:57.389]  Violence is not necessary.
[04:40:57.630 --> 04:40:59.209]  These people are afraid of words, dude.
[04:40:59.509 --> 04:41:00.869]  They can't handle words.
[04:41:01.250 --> 04:41:12.470]  Everything's hate speech, and hate speech is violence, and it's a threat to my existence because I'm a minority within a minority within a minority, and I can't handle being told that I'm a minority within a minority within a minority.
[04:41:12.610 --> 04:41:14.470]  You can't even use the words they call themselves.
[04:41:16.819 --> 04:41:19.060]  So it's not violence they're afraid of.
[04:41:19.439 --> 04:41:22.000]  Ultimately, they have the wrong fear.
[04:41:22.759 --> 04:41:25.799]  They don't fear God as a reverence or a respect.
[04:41:27.520 --> 04:41:29.939]  But they themselves live in panic.
[04:41:30.080 --> 04:41:30.759]  They live in fear.
[04:41:30.900 --> 04:41:31.840]  They live in paranoia.
[04:41:31.979 --> 04:41:33.060]  They're schizophrenic.
[04:41:33.180 --> 04:41:34.959]  They're filled with pharmaceuticals.
[04:41:35.040 --> 04:41:36.119]  They're pumped up with drugs.
[04:41:36.259 --> 04:41:37.560]  They're jabbed 30 times.
[04:41:37.779 --> 04:41:38.959]  They want 50 more.
[04:41:39.860 --> 04:41:43.200]  These people live in a state of paranoia and fear, so it makes them dangerous.
[04:41:44.340 --> 04:41:47.740]  If they feared God, they would experience comfort through the Holy Spirit.
[04:41:48.680 --> 04:41:52.040]  But they worship and they serve their father, the devil, so they do his bidding.
[04:41:52.799 --> 04:41:55.279]  And it's inconsistent, and they make mistakes.
[04:41:55.900 --> 04:41:58.580]  And sometimes God really highlights it, and you could see it.
[04:41:58.759 --> 04:42:04.299]  And God definitely did that with Trump during this campaign, and he's definitely been doing it with Infowars.
[04:42:04.939 --> 04:42:06.840]  And so, you know, we have all hope in God.
[04:42:06.979 --> 04:42:08.779]  If God be for us, who could be against us?
[04:42:08.860 --> 04:42:12.939]  That doesn't mean the outcome will always be what we want it to be or what we think it might be.
[04:42:13.639 --> 04:42:15.799]  Because God ultimately has everything in his hands.
[04:42:15.959 --> 04:42:27.639]  And when we entrust things, when we entrust ourselves, our lives, our family, our business, especially our eternal lives, all things work together for those who love God and who are called according to his purpose.
[04:42:27.799 --> 04:42:30.119]  What that looks like, I can't tell you.
[04:42:30.279 --> 04:42:31.400]  That's to his discretion.
[04:42:31.400 --> 04:42:32.619]  But we have that hope.
[04:42:33.520 --> 04:42:38.939]  And when I look at InfoWars and when I look at Alex Jones, and I'm not saying this because I'm obviously biased.
[04:42:39.060 --> 04:42:39.619]  I love Alex.
[04:42:39.799 --> 04:42:41.819]  He's played a huge role in my life and my career.
[04:42:41.819 --> 04:42:45.500]  I would not be here if it were not for Alex Jones and the crew.
[04:42:45.740 --> 04:42:49.200]  That's including the crew and people like Owen Schroyer, Harrison Smith, etc.
[04:42:49.380 --> 04:42:50.220]  The list goes on.
[04:42:51.060 --> 04:42:55.659]  I look at InfoWars and I look at what they've done and I look at what they have continued to do.
[04:42:55.799 --> 04:43:01.540]  And it makes sense that they truly are the ones getting hit right now as this all happens.
[04:43:02.479 --> 04:43:04.119]  Because they are the most effective.
[04:43:04.520 --> 04:43:06.180]  Everybody wants to be Infowars.
[04:43:06.360 --> 04:43:08.220]  Everybody wants to live that model.
[04:43:08.580 --> 04:43:11.020]  Everybody wants that type of viral success.
[04:43:11.200 --> 04:43:12.840]  And I'll also take it a step further.
[04:43:13.040 --> 04:43:17.939]  I think MAGA barely accomplished what I'm about to say after this last election.
[04:43:18.979 --> 04:43:23.580]  Infowars has been a part of the culture for a very, very, very long time.
[04:43:23.720 --> 04:43:41.790]  I think that's why part of the reason how Infowars We're good to go.
[04:43:47.889 --> 04:43:49.090]  A television network.
[04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:51.389]  This is beyond a radio network.
[04:43:51.610 --> 04:43:52.790]  This is beyond entertainment.
[04:43:53.209 --> 04:43:54.090]  This is life.
[04:43:54.229 --> 04:43:55.090]  This is a lifestyle.
[04:43:55.450 --> 04:43:56.689]  This isn't in full war.
[04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:59.889]  This is life or death, and I'm not calling for violence.
[04:43:59.889 --> 04:44:02.889]  I'm just saying, like, look what they tried to do to Trump.
[04:44:03.029 --> 04:44:04.090]  They tried to blow his head off.
[04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:05.790]  Drew Hernandez, this is Rob Dew.
[04:44:05.909 --> 04:44:06.310]  Can you hear me?
[04:44:07.009 --> 04:44:07.970]  What's going on, Rob?
[04:44:08.169 --> 04:44:08.470]  What's going on?
[04:44:08.669 --> 04:44:09.569]  We have some breaking news.
[04:44:09.709 --> 04:44:19.270]  We were listening in on the court hearing, the emergency hearing with Judge Lopez, where we had Alex's counsel and then the opposing counsel.
[04:44:19.650 --> 04:44:20.930]  The trustee was there.
[04:44:21.090 --> 04:44:23.250]  Even lawyers from X were present.
[04:44:23.920 --> 04:44:25.459]  In what was going on.
[04:44:25.639 --> 04:44:34.720]  And apparently the judge is pissed off of not necessarily who got, how the outcome of the auction, but the process of it.
[04:44:34.819 --> 04:44:40.220]  And at one point he said, you know, an auction is supposed to be somebody bids $10, somebody bids $20, and the price goes up.
[04:44:40.989 --> 04:44:44.330]  And so he seemed pretty ticked off that that's not how it was.
[04:44:44.409 --> 04:44:46.430]  And he said it was not transparent.
[04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:48.990]  He wanted to see transparency in this process.
[04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:51.490]  So Alex is going to come in with a breakdown in a little bit.
[04:44:51.529 --> 04:44:56.330]  He's actually talking with his lawyers, but I just wanted to let people know what's going on in that aspect.
[04:44:57.470 --> 04:45:14.069]  The attorneys for X got on and they said, we want to be part of any conversation before any X handles trade places because it can't just be they get handed over without due process is what they seem to be saying.
[04:45:15.599 --> 04:45:17.099]  So it was pretty contentious.
[04:45:18.580 --> 04:45:24.540]  Alex's attorneys were saying, you know, they just basically threw 30 people out on the street.
[04:45:24.860 --> 04:45:29.619]  And now they're talking about possibly, you know, I don't know if it's going to get reversed, if there'll be a decision on Monday.
[04:45:29.619 --> 04:45:33.119]  It sounds like the judge has to think about it, of what's going to happen.
[04:45:33.220 --> 04:45:36.340]  But Alex will be talking to his attorneys and coming in with an update.
[04:45:36.500 --> 04:45:40.959]  But just from what I was listening to downstairs, we were listening to the hearing.
[04:45:41.790 --> 04:45:57.369]  The bottom line is the judge seemed pissed off at the way this was done, which, you know, seems to be the way of the dim tart is to be sneaky and deceiving and not, you know, create rules but then not play by them and then change the rules at the last minute.
[04:45:57.529 --> 04:45:59.750]  All that stuff we saw go on in this process.
[04:45:59.750 --> 04:46:03.130]  So it's pretty despicable, dishonorable.
[04:46:03.369 --> 04:46:11.290]  There's a lot of other adjectives I could use, but just hearing that the judge is actually a common sense judge and is not just like, well...
[04:46:11.540 --> 04:46:15.799]  You know, they said the magic words, SH, so we're going to let them do whatever they want.
[04:46:15.959 --> 04:46:17.040]  You know, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:46:17.220 --> 04:46:19.520]  He said, no, you guys didn't do it the right way.
[04:46:19.659 --> 04:46:20.639]  This needs to be transparent.
[04:46:20.840 --> 04:46:25.939]  So no decision was made today, as far as I know, as I came upstairs.
[04:46:25.939 --> 04:46:30.860]  But they ended the hearing, and it sounds like something's going to be decided on by Monday.
[04:46:32.240 --> 04:46:33.439]  Well, that sounds about right.
[04:46:34.040 --> 04:46:35.060]  That sounds about right.
[04:46:35.139 --> 04:46:38.159]  And it's also an arrogance, Rob.
[04:46:38.400 --> 04:46:38.819]  It is.
[04:46:38.919 --> 04:46:39.040]  Right?
[04:46:39.259 --> 04:46:43.340]  It's like when you go out a judge like that, because the judge is the process.
[04:46:43.580 --> 04:46:44.860]  He's gonna set the process.
[04:46:45.139 --> 04:46:51.560]  And you can't have an auction and then rig it without his knowledge and expect the judge to just think this is all okay.
[04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:55.130]  Again, that's what I was saying earlier is I think these people are used to this, Rob.
[04:46:55.310 --> 04:47:07.750]  Like, they are used to getting their way, rigging everything, and experiencing no consequence, and just absolutely just going rogue and running wild where nobody's actually going to keep them in line and keep them in check.
[04:47:08.040 --> 04:47:13.419]  You know, I think Viva said this last segment is maybe a redo would have to happen.
[04:47:13.520 --> 04:47:14.119]  That would be fair.
[04:47:14.220 --> 04:47:15.819]  If it were up to me, I would just throw it all out.
[04:47:15.919 --> 04:47:17.599]  But that's me because I'm biased, right?
[04:47:17.659 --> 04:47:18.720]  I think this shouldn't be happening.
[04:47:18.880 --> 04:47:22.540]  But that definitely was not an auction, in my opinion, Rob.
[04:47:22.880 --> 04:47:26.599]  And what I gathered from listening, there was only two bidders.
[04:47:26.720 --> 04:47:31.279]  So it was the good guys, as Alex is saying, people he would like to work with.
[04:47:31.400 --> 04:47:36.299]  And then this consortium involving the Onion and other parties.
[04:47:37.539 --> 04:47:45.900]  And from what I've heard, and I don't know if any of this has gotten out, but the good guys had a higher bid, essentially.
[04:47:46.200 --> 04:47:49.939]  And it was given to these other people on the basis of a promise.
[04:47:50.459 --> 04:47:52.380]  And then it kind of just...
[04:47:52.380 --> 04:47:54.200]  Well, and then the process kind of disappeared.
[04:47:54.439 --> 04:47:56.599]  And then it's like, okay, now you're off the air.
[04:47:57.060 --> 04:48:03.139]  And we're going to try to sideswipe you this as we get our press releases ready.
[04:48:03.220 --> 04:48:04.220]  We're going to launch them.
[04:48:04.380 --> 04:48:05.939]  And then if you look it up, there's...
[04:48:06.259 --> 04:48:10.080]  It's the top story in the country right now of what's going on.
[04:48:10.299 --> 04:48:11.979]  So it's pretty disgusting.
[04:48:11.979 --> 04:48:15.659]  If this thing does get reversed, I think what you'll see is hardly any news about it.
[04:48:15.759 --> 04:48:18.459]  They'll just pretend like, oh, the Onion still owns it.
[04:48:18.680 --> 04:48:28.540]  But I'm hoping the judge reverses it and it goes back to an actual process that they set it up and we don't change the rules and we don't change what's being sold.
[04:48:29.040 --> 04:48:32.740]  They're talking about some of these websites may have been sold that they don't even own.
[04:48:32.819 --> 04:48:33.680]  Free speech doesn't even own.
[04:48:34.029 --> 04:48:36.950]  So that the bidders think they got.
[04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:39.750]  So it's a lot of stuff.
[04:48:39.849 --> 04:48:49.810]  Because when you set up something like this, then you have to, once it's done, it should have taken a month to go over each thing to make sure it's proper and just instead of, oh, we're flipping the lights off.
[04:48:49.950 --> 04:48:51.250]  So they did it the wrong way.
[04:48:51.669 --> 04:48:58.130]  And hopefully they do pay for it because we have to have some semblance of normalcy.
[04:48:58.250 --> 04:49:06.419]  If we're going to do this stuff, If we're taking people's assets and putting 30 people out of work, it's got to be done the right way.
[04:49:06.580 --> 04:49:13.380]  It cannot just be, well, we're just going to decide it's like this, and boom, here it is, and everybody run for the hills.
[04:49:14.080 --> 04:49:16.400]  Now it's like, oh, we may reverse that decision.
[04:49:17.020 --> 04:49:19.159]  It's crazy what's going on right now.
[04:49:19.240 --> 04:49:25.279]  Also, Rob, I'm not going to speak for this judge, but I put myself in those shoes.
[04:49:25.520 --> 04:49:29.909]  I would think that Yeah.
[04:49:30.630 --> 04:49:30.650]  Yeah.
[04:49:30.729 --> 04:49:30.750]  Yeah.
[04:49:30.750 --> 04:49:30.869]  Yeah.
[04:49:55.599 --> 04:49:58.560]  We're good to go.
[04:50:15.420 --> 04:50:18.740]  And they just want to neutralize Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[04:50:19.240 --> 04:50:20.939]  But I think people are seeing that.
[04:50:21.080 --> 04:50:29.630]  Again, Rob, and again, like, You are putting a judge's reputation on the line that clearly cares about his own reputation.
[04:50:29.909 --> 04:50:31.709]  So you're not gonna get away with that.
[04:50:31.849 --> 04:50:32.950]  He wants things done right.
[04:50:32.950 --> 04:50:34.209]  He wants things done legally.
[04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:36.389]  He wants things done fairly and correctly.
[04:50:36.630 --> 04:50:40.189]  And if you overplayed your hand on that, it's for sure gonna backfire.
[04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:47.569]  I don't know what the outcome will be, but it's sounding like, from what I'm hearing, that he's not happy with these people.
[04:50:49.040 --> 04:50:52.659]  Overstepping their bounds and doing it their way without his judgment.
[04:50:52.919 --> 04:50:54.299]  That's like literally how it goes.
[04:50:54.500 --> 04:50:59.639]  I think with that, at the end of the day, he wants to see everything that's happened and put his stamp of approval on it.
[04:50:59.740 --> 04:51:00.860]  And he didn't get the chance to do that.
[04:51:00.939 --> 04:51:01.580]  It was already done.
[04:51:01.779 --> 04:51:02.639]  It's already in the news.
[04:51:02.740 --> 04:51:07.659]  And I think by putting in the news, they're like, well, we can't go back now because we put all this.
[04:51:07.759 --> 04:51:09.139]  There's a lot of headlines out there now.
[04:51:09.259 --> 04:51:10.639]  We have a lot of headlines tied up in this.
[04:51:10.840 --> 04:51:12.659]  We can't change anything.
[04:51:12.860 --> 04:51:13.580]  So they're...
[04:51:14.139 --> 04:51:15.139]  They're definitely...
[04:51:15.139 --> 04:51:18.279]  There's concern with the other parties at this point.
[04:51:18.740 --> 04:51:21.959]  And from what I'm gathering, it's a Connecticut group.
[04:51:22.580 --> 04:51:25.119]  And so now, what's going to happen with this Texas group?
[04:51:25.220 --> 04:51:27.779]  Are they going to come in and try to stop what's going on?
[04:51:27.959 --> 04:51:31.099]  It's bizarro world right now over here.
[04:51:31.180 --> 04:51:32.060]  But here's the thing.
[04:51:32.060 --> 04:51:35.340]  We're still back on the air, and we can stay there with everybody's support.
[04:51:35.340 --> 04:51:37.700]  If everybody just go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[04:51:37.979 --> 04:51:39.619]  Right now, we launched a new...
[04:51:40.439 --> 04:51:41.060]  Truck giveaway.
[04:51:41.360 --> 04:51:44.919]  So every time you enter, you get 10 entries, I think is what's going on right now.
[04:51:45.060 --> 04:51:45.799]  So you get the truck.
[04:51:45.939 --> 04:51:51.819]  It's a F-250 plus $10,000 in cash to cover that tax title and license.
[04:51:51.840 --> 04:51:55.439]  That'll hit you, especially when you buy a new vehicle.
[04:51:55.580 --> 04:51:58.000]  But check it out, alexjonesstore.com.
[04:51:58.000 --> 04:51:59.860]  We got amazing nutraceuticals, Hydroforce.
[04:51:59.860 --> 04:52:04.360]  If you might have seen on Alex's X account, we put a...
[04:52:05.290 --> 04:52:13.930]  It's kind of a spoof ad with Cardi B talking about how her women need to maintain themselves and not get with dirty men.
[04:52:15.049 --> 04:52:15.889]  It's just funny.
[04:52:16.509 --> 04:52:25.650]  This is somebody who was paid by Kamala Harris to endorse her, and then we turned it into an ad because we were shooting some stuff up here, some test shows, which We needed them.
[04:52:25.810 --> 04:52:26.569]  We needed the test shows.
[04:52:26.689 --> 04:52:27.990]  Even now we're working out bugs.
[04:52:28.209 --> 04:52:29.029]  Things are happening.
[04:52:29.209 --> 04:52:30.409]  And, you know, this is part of the deal.
[04:52:30.490 --> 04:52:33.950]  It's like we have a battle station that's maybe like 80% done.
[04:52:34.189 --> 04:52:37.709]  But, you know, by going in here and doing this in like two weeks, it's going to be tip-top.
[04:52:37.909 --> 04:52:42.270]  We're going to be rolling through the news, keeping people abreast of what's going on.
[04:52:42.330 --> 04:52:45.669]  Because it's not necessarily about us, although today we are the news story.
[04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:49.810]  You know, InfoWars and Free Speech Systems is the news story today.
[04:52:50.029 --> 04:52:50.389]  But...
[04:52:50.909 --> 04:52:53.250]  A few days from now, it's going to be something else that's going to happen.
[04:52:53.389 --> 04:53:02.470]  We know with these appointments, there's a lot of people, contentiousness around Matt Gaetz being appointed or nominated for attorney general.
[04:53:03.609 --> 04:53:06.409]  On both sides, on the Republicans and Democrats' side.
[04:53:06.509 --> 04:53:08.369]  So that's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.
[04:53:08.669 --> 04:53:10.569]  Plus, we've got to get Trump into office.
[04:53:10.689 --> 04:53:12.970]  We've got 60 days until this happens.
[04:53:13.090 --> 04:53:21.909]  So there's a lot going on, and we just need people out there to stay focused, spread the word, spread AJNLive, at AJNLive, and at Real Alex Jones.
[04:53:22.009 --> 04:53:25.830]  Those are the two places right now that we can get...
[04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:26.630]  So now we have...
[04:53:27.189 --> 04:53:27.549]  All right.
[04:53:27.909 --> 04:53:29.209]  Here's some more breaking news.
[04:53:29.389 --> 04:53:29.889]  It just happened.
[04:53:30.549 --> 04:53:32.849]  3.13 p.m., so just about 20 minutes ago.
[04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.490]  Donald Trump.
[04:53:33.669 --> 04:53:38.830]  I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy is the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.
[04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:42.029]  That's, I think, where everybody wanted to see him.
[04:53:42.130 --> 04:53:43.909]  That's where I think he can get the most done.
[04:53:44.029 --> 04:53:45.470]  This is a great pick.
[04:53:45.650 --> 04:53:46.250]  I don't think...
[04:53:46.250 --> 04:53:51.169]  Of course, it's going to be contentious because they're going to try to call him an anti-vaxxer, even though he's stopped that...
[04:54:05.369 --> 04:54:06.770]  See?
[04:54:21.540 --> 04:54:28.540]  Getting Robert F. Kennedy in with Trump, educated Trump, maybe he'll stop eating so much crappy fast food too because we need him to stay around.
[04:54:28.680 --> 04:54:28.840]  Mr.
[04:54:28.959 --> 04:54:34.139]  Kennedy will restore these agencies to the traditions of gold standard scientific research.
[04:54:34.279 --> 04:54:38.400]  That's what we were for many years and that has been lost because we put these up.
[04:54:38.919 --> 04:54:42.619]  These pharma simps in there that just do the bidding of big pharma.
[04:54:42.759 --> 04:54:43.720]  So it's totally disgusting.
[04:54:43.880 --> 04:54:45.319]  This is great news, though.
[04:54:45.720 --> 04:54:51.400]  And beacons of transparency to end the chronic disease epidemic and make America great and healthy again.
[04:54:51.700 --> 04:54:53.220]  I already got 4 million views.
[04:54:53.220 --> 04:54:54.720]  It's been up about 20 minutes.
[04:54:54.900 --> 04:54:55.779]  That's great news.
[04:54:57.549 --> 04:54:57.930]  Incredible.
[04:54:58.209 --> 04:55:01.250]  See, but this is what's causing the panic and the freakout.
[04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.529]  Yep.
[04:55:01.849 --> 04:55:03.310]  They just can't, they can't even keep up.
[04:55:03.409 --> 04:55:05.509]  That's what I'm loving about these appointments as well, Rob.
[04:55:05.650 --> 04:55:08.810]  I don't know about you, but every time there's one that gets dropped, right?
[04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:11.689]  It's just like, it's like bomb after bomb after bomb.
[04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:14.830]  Tulsi, Matt Gaetz, and now RFK Jr.
[04:55:14.909 --> 04:55:16.750]  just keeps coming and coming and coming.
[04:55:17.040 --> 04:55:21.340]  But this is why they're panicking, and they're definitely running around crazy.
[04:55:21.520 --> 04:55:23.799]  They're freaking out because they know that their time is up.
[04:55:23.919 --> 04:55:34.720]  They definitely know that the writing is on the wall, that the writing has been on the wall, and they gambled on the wrong retard horse, in my opinion, Kamala Harris, and they lost.
[04:55:34.740 --> 04:55:46.400]  And I think right now they are just going to work in complete overtime to go after anybody and everyone they can in their power in these final couple months until Trump is inaugurated.
[04:55:46.689 --> 04:55:50.590]  And of course, Trump can overturn a lot when he gets in, but this isn't going to stop them.
[04:55:50.689 --> 04:55:56.830]  And also, we've got to still remain vigilant that they could still take out Trump any day now.
[04:55:57.110 --> 04:56:00.810]  I think Trump was golfing the other day with his granddaughter.
[04:56:00.970 --> 04:56:01.849]  Not a big fan of that.
[04:56:02.090 --> 04:56:03.209]  I want him to be happy.
[04:56:03.310 --> 04:56:04.110]  I want him to be healthy.
[04:56:04.130 --> 04:56:06.430]  I want him to live his life, but I want him to...
[04:56:06.689 --> 04:56:09.270]  Stay alive and make it to Inauguration Day.
[04:56:09.529 --> 04:56:15.549]  And I think we definitely need to remain vigilant when it comes to the life of the president and all of these picks.
[04:56:15.689 --> 04:56:18.930]  I mean, look at the Doge appointments with Vivek and Elon Musk.
[04:56:19.150 --> 04:56:22.069]  Rob, in my opinion, Rob, I don't know.
[04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:31.689]  I'm curious to know how you feel about this, but I think the Department of Government Efficiency is going to expose so much corruption and illegal activity because you always follow the money.
[04:56:31.970 --> 04:56:44.869]  And when you follow the money, it leads you to where everything is happening from, of the origin of all of the illegal activity that's been going on in this country for, what, the past 80 years, 80-plus years?
[04:56:45.330 --> 04:56:47.069]  That's what I predict is going to be uncovered.
[04:56:47.310 --> 04:56:52.889]  Yeah, you know, if you look back at the creation of the CIA, it's probably like a low point in what's going on.
[04:56:53.090 --> 04:56:55.169]  Jones is going to come in here, but yes, I think it's a great idea.
[04:56:55.169 --> 04:56:55.409]  We love you, Drew.
[04:56:55.930 --> 04:56:57.150]  We've got Roger Stone waiting.
[04:56:57.189 --> 04:56:58.229]  I've got huge news.
[04:56:58.549 --> 04:57:00.069]  The court hearing with the judges ended.
[04:57:00.169 --> 04:57:01.229]  I had to talk to my lawyers first.
[04:57:02.029 --> 04:57:03.450]  They really screwed up.
[04:57:04.889 --> 04:57:05.930]  I mean, I knew it.
[04:57:06.369 --> 04:57:07.830]  These people were crazy.
[04:57:08.569 --> 04:57:10.330]  And also, get me the Onion letter.
[04:57:10.330 --> 04:57:11.490]  I just had them reprinted.
[04:57:11.610 --> 04:57:14.310]  Where they confessed it was about shutting us down and silencing us.
[04:57:14.430 --> 04:57:17.889]  Because they just went to court and told the judge a bunch of stuff that was not true.
[04:57:20.069 --> 04:57:23.150]  And the judge said, now they're in a full evidentiary hearing.
[04:57:23.490 --> 04:57:24.330]  Go to the promo.
[04:57:24.529 --> 04:57:25.310]  Great job, Drew Hernandez.
[04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:26.470]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[04:57:26.509 --> 04:57:27.049]  Go to the promo.
[04:57:27.229 --> 04:57:27.669]  I'll get in the seat.
[04:57:33.119 --> 04:57:38.840]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[04:57:39.200 --> 04:57:43.959]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intermention.
[04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:50.509]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[04:57:50.610 --> 04:57:53.750]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[04:57:53.909 --> 04:57:56.369]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[04:57:56.610 --> 04:57:59.349]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[04:57:59.549 --> 04:58:03.130]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:10.450]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[04:58:10.729 --> 04:58:14.069]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[04:58:14.290 --> 04:58:22.880]  We're taking the AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[04:58:23.799 --> 04:58:27.020]  Infowars to be shut down in just a few weeks.
[04:58:27.240 --> 04:58:33.720]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[04:58:34.020 --> 04:58:37.659]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[04:58:37.880 --> 04:58:42.119]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[04:58:42.220 --> 04:58:46.540]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[04:59:21.139 --> 04:59:24.200]  We're good to go.
[04:59:50.669 --> 04:59:56.689]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I have massive, massive news.
[04:59:58.380 --> 05:00:00.080]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[05:00:00.459 --> 05:00:07.479]  has been chosen for a major cabinet position, a major federal position, Health and Human Services.
[05:00:07.479 --> 05:00:10.040]  Let's put up his press release right now.
[05:00:10.240 --> 05:00:24.790]  Just yesterday, the great Roger Stone broke the news, as President Trump gave it to him, of Tulsi Gabbard being chosen for the Director of National Intelligence as the person that oversees all the intelligence agencies, including the CIA. I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[05:00:25.009 --> 05:00:27.409]  as the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.
[05:00:27.430 --> 05:00:36.750]  For far too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, disinformation.
[05:00:37.130 --> 05:00:39.250]  Think Trump's pissed how Big Pharma set him up?
[05:00:39.349 --> 05:00:39.849]  Think a little?
[05:00:41.259 --> 05:00:56.200]  We're good to go.
[05:01:04.259 --> 05:01:07.360]  To end the chronic disease pandemic and to make America great again and healthy.
[05:01:07.560 --> 05:01:09.419]  Wow, you know RFK Jr.
[05:01:09.599 --> 05:01:10.279]  had a hand in that.
[05:01:10.400 --> 05:01:11.220]  Sounds just like him.
[05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.950]  This is...
[05:01:12.950 --> 05:01:14.549]  I actually just got dizzy.
[05:01:14.549 --> 05:01:15.290]  This is so good.
[05:01:15.409 --> 05:01:17.209]  Because I was walking in there four minutes ago to talk to Roger.
[05:01:17.669 --> 05:01:18.569]  Saw this.
[05:01:18.970 --> 05:01:21.470]  And Kennedy is such a good person.
[05:01:21.810 --> 05:01:22.830]  So on target.
[05:01:23.049 --> 05:01:23.709]  So smart.
[05:01:24.130 --> 05:01:24.770]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[05:01:24.869 --> 05:01:25.369]  Oh, my God.
[05:01:25.790 --> 05:01:26.590]  And then it just...
[05:01:26.590 --> 05:01:27.450]  Oh, my Elon Musk.
[05:01:27.549 --> 05:01:28.450]  Oh, Tucker Carlson.
[05:01:28.529 --> 05:01:29.029]  All these people.
[05:01:29.169 --> 05:01:34.090]  I get to know all these great people who are at the vanguard of the fight against tyranny.
[05:01:34.610 --> 05:01:35.630]  And Trump...
[05:01:36.139 --> 05:01:37.900]  Fetterman, get the Fetterman clip right before I go to Roger.
[05:01:38.279 --> 05:01:46.360]  Fetterman came here and said, God-tear trolling by Trump, putting Matt Gaetz in as the attorney general.
[05:01:47.119 --> 05:01:49.639]  I mean, ladies, he's been a total victim of him.
[05:01:50.259 --> 05:01:54.479]  So Trump is literally, Kennedy's dad and uncle were murdered in front of him.
[05:01:56.409 --> 05:01:57.750]  Roger's been totally persecuted.
[05:01:57.889 --> 05:01:58.729]  I've been persecuted.
[05:01:59.669 --> 05:02:03.689]  Members of my crew have been sent to prison for nothing, being at the Capitol, saying, don't go in the building.
[05:02:05.169 --> 05:02:06.750]  Bannon, they're trying to throw back in prison.
[05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:10.169]  The hunted are becoming the hunters here.
[05:02:11.130 --> 05:02:11.529]  So...
[05:02:13.349 --> 05:02:24.270]  Roger Stone did put together a major group, by the way, that wasn't taught, that was ready to come in and just do incredible things to save InfoWars.
[05:02:24.389 --> 05:02:32.529]  And I told my lawyers, and I told them all, I said, it doesn't matter how much money you put into this, they're not going to let you have it.
[05:02:33.900 --> 05:02:39.259]  And I just talked to my lawyers and the buyer's lawyers and they said, oh my God, the hearing with the judge has ended.
[05:02:39.619 --> 05:02:46.619]  And after we cover the big news of Kennedy and the 35,000 foot in Trump, the important things, but this is a substrat of what we're under attack by.
[05:02:47.000 --> 05:02:50.639]  I will explain now that I did not diss these great people.
[05:02:50.759 --> 05:02:51.720]  And I did not.
[05:02:51.900 --> 05:02:53.900]  I just said, they won't believe it.
[05:02:54.159 --> 05:02:54.919]  Just wait and see.
[05:02:55.939 --> 05:02:57.319]  And they just got caught in court.
[05:02:57.580 --> 05:02:59.220]  The judge is very calm.
[05:02:59.639 --> 05:03:00.959]  Trump appointed, but very fair.
[05:03:01.360 --> 05:03:02.400]  Judge Chris Lopez.
[05:03:03.080 --> 05:03:05.939]  And I was just reviewing it all.
[05:03:06.080 --> 05:03:06.779]  I'll just leave it at that.
[05:03:07.439 --> 05:03:09.759]  And this is epic.
[05:03:10.819 --> 05:03:12.720]  This is absolutely epic.
[05:03:13.799 --> 05:03:15.659]  They went into court.
[05:03:17.020 --> 05:03:19.360]  And they told the judge things that weren't true.
[05:03:20.060 --> 05:03:21.400]  And here's the epic part.
[05:03:21.439 --> 05:03:22.060]  We'll get back to it in a little bit.
[05:03:23.740 --> 05:03:26.319]  They said no amount of money would have been good.
[05:03:27.259 --> 05:03:40.819]  Just as I said, they pledged my billion and a half dollars that's on appeal, but that's as good as Confederate money from 1863, you know, with Jefferson Davis on the front of it.
[05:03:41.500 --> 05:03:43.360]  I mean, that's how good that is, toilet paper.
[05:03:43.580 --> 05:03:46.659]  Or Zimbabwe notes, billion dollar notes won't buy a slice of bread.
[05:03:46.819 --> 05:03:49.900]  Or Weimar Republic from, you know, 1932 in Germany.
[05:03:51.299 --> 05:04:02.279]  So, ladies and gentlemen, They pledged the debt I owe as collateral to outbid anyone.
[05:04:03.840 --> 05:04:09.819]  And the U.S. trustee claimed from the Justice Department that he approved that because that was the best money.
[05:04:10.540 --> 05:04:11.799]  So it didn't matter.
[05:04:11.799 --> 05:04:13.939]  And I was right again.
[05:04:14.200 --> 05:04:17.540]  And I didn't say it publicly, but I'm on record in front of the crew and all the lawyers.
[05:04:17.700 --> 05:04:19.400]  The lawyers were all, how did you know this?
[05:04:19.619 --> 05:04:22.299]  Man, all I do is fight these people.
[05:04:23.220 --> 05:04:23.560]  Okay?
[05:04:23.860 --> 05:04:24.919]  That's what I do!
[05:04:26.650 --> 05:04:31.110]  And they'll go out of their way to do crooked stuff when justice would serve them.
[05:04:31.509 --> 05:04:33.290]  They didn't want $70 million from me.
[05:04:33.349 --> 05:04:35.110]  I told lawyers, I said, watch, Alfred's 70 won't take it.
[05:04:35.349 --> 05:04:36.130]  We don't want your money.
[05:04:36.689 --> 05:04:38.270]  They go, give us $86.
[05:04:38.669 --> 05:04:39.029]  $86.
[05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.930]  Nope, we don't want it.
[05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:41.869]  We want you to come out against Trump.
[05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:47.889]  And I couldn't talk about it in mediation to the federal courthouse until they told my lawyers separately on record.
[05:04:48.090 --> 05:04:49.610]  And they were like, yeah, we want you off the air.
[05:04:49.669 --> 05:04:50.110]  We admit it.
[05:04:50.430 --> 05:04:52.229]  So they literally admit we wanted Jones to do it.
[05:04:52.330 --> 05:04:53.450]  I got Roger on.
[05:04:53.470 --> 05:04:53.869]  I apologize.
[05:04:53.869 --> 05:04:54.369]  I'm ranting.
[05:04:54.709 --> 05:04:56.069]  But I just got all this news.
[05:04:57.469 --> 05:05:03.270]  And, oh my God, they were accusing us of being criminals as well in the court.
[05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:05.849]  Very similar to what happened before.
[05:05:06.330 --> 05:05:10.330]  We have to kick all the employees out of the building because they might take the equipment.
[05:05:10.790 --> 05:05:13.549]  Just ridiculous horse crap like that.
[05:05:16.599 --> 05:05:18.680]  Even our own employees were like getting their computers their personal.
[05:05:18.799 --> 05:05:19.380]  Like, what's that?
[05:05:19.500 --> 05:05:23.759]  You know, it's just cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[05:05:24.020 --> 05:05:34.779]  Like, the last U.S. trustee, when he got fired by the judge, the judge was like, why did you try to throw Jones out of the building on May 29th or whatever, on that Friday night, whatever the Friday night was, the end of May, and without my order, what was the point?
[05:05:34.819 --> 05:05:35.819]  He goes, well, they had guns.
[05:05:36.220 --> 05:05:37.259]  I said, really, what were they doing with the guns?
[05:05:37.319 --> 05:05:38.360]  Well, there's guns in the building.
[05:05:38.720 --> 05:05:42.720]  Well, yeah, like in my office and people I can still carry, never been a crime or been a problem.
[05:05:42.900 --> 05:05:46.619]  It's like this is the level and it's right back to that again.
[05:05:46.759 --> 05:05:51.479]  Like I am Satan and I deserve all this and so does Roger Stone and so does Trump.
[05:05:52.139 --> 05:05:52.860]  America's done!
[05:05:53.880 --> 05:05:55.619]  There's been a political realignment.
[05:05:56.200 --> 05:05:57.360]  Do you understand?
[05:05:57.360 --> 05:05:58.200]  We're sick of it.
[05:05:58.599 --> 05:05:59.419]  Roger, I'm ranting.
[05:06:01.520 --> 05:06:03.119]  I've got an earpiece and I'll be listening to you.
[05:06:03.200 --> 05:06:06.040]  I'm actually going to run and get some documents right now because I forgot to bring in here.
[05:06:06.799 --> 05:06:07.740]  This is just insane.
[05:06:07.840 --> 05:06:09.259]  But give us the RFK Jr.
[05:06:10.180 --> 05:06:11.779]  breakdown and then what else is happening.
[05:06:12.040 --> 05:06:14.459]  And then it wasn't talked with Roger Stone.
[05:06:14.580 --> 05:06:16.000]  He brought the big people.
[05:06:16.500 --> 05:06:18.619]  And the big, I mean, they're like, what do you want?
[05:06:18.939 --> 05:06:23.340]  And I was like, just watch.
[05:06:23.700 --> 05:06:25.560]  And I said, we'll do something after this.
[05:06:25.599 --> 05:06:28.580]  If I'm able to save him for us, we really want to work with you and blow up this huge network.
[05:06:28.819 --> 05:06:30.139]  I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:06:30.919 --> 05:06:31.220]  So...
[05:06:32.740 --> 05:06:35.299]  And I told the lawyers from the other group that I already agreed to do it with them.
[05:06:35.299 --> 05:06:37.000]  I said, look, I'm not cutting these guys out.
[05:06:37.099 --> 05:06:37.560]  They're really nice.
[05:06:37.619 --> 05:06:38.080]  They want to help.
[05:06:38.740 --> 05:06:39.599]  I said, watch.
[05:06:39.700 --> 05:06:40.340]  You will get nothing.
[05:06:40.439 --> 05:06:41.240]  It'll all be shut down.
[05:06:41.400 --> 05:06:41.959]  I'm on record.
[05:06:42.060 --> 05:06:43.200]  Text messages to prove it.
[05:06:43.439 --> 05:06:44.080]  And they went.
[05:06:44.200 --> 05:06:48.340]  And these are very well-known, successful business people and lawyers that did do the bid.
[05:06:48.799 --> 05:06:50.040]  And they go, this is insane.
[05:06:50.259 --> 05:06:51.180]  I mean, it is.
[05:06:51.459 --> 05:06:55.400]  And then you've got The Onion now hijacking the website.
[05:06:55.619 --> 05:06:56.479]  They took down the judges.
[05:06:56.639 --> 05:06:57.259]  Like, where's the website?
[05:06:57.380 --> 05:06:57.680]  Where's the?
[05:06:57.819 --> 05:06:59.020]  Oh, yeah, they already took that over.
[05:06:59.520 --> 05:07:00.880]  No judge certified the sale.
[05:07:02.719 --> 05:07:08.540]  And we took him off because he says there's evil in the world, and he's part of the satanic panic.
[05:07:09.299 --> 05:07:11.240]  And they did it to take me off the air.
[05:07:11.500 --> 05:07:12.680]  So it's not about money.
[05:07:12.720 --> 05:07:13.740]  It's not about restitution.
[05:07:14.020 --> 05:07:15.400]  And they're fun about the Democrats.
[05:07:15.540 --> 05:07:16.340]  This is just the front group.
[05:07:16.639 --> 05:07:17.380]  Roger, I'm ranting.
[05:07:17.520 --> 05:07:18.220]  I've said my piece.
[05:07:18.340 --> 05:07:19.139]  I'm listening to you.
[05:07:20.819 --> 05:07:21.720]  There's InfoWars.
[05:07:23.879 --> 05:07:24.919]  So, here it is.
[05:07:25.000 --> 05:07:26.060]  We fought as long as we could.
[05:07:27.099 --> 05:07:31.099]  It almost became cry wolf because we just kept surviving in the nick of time.
[05:07:31.540 --> 05:07:34.159]  But now, do people believe they're trying to shut us down, Roger Stone?
[05:07:35.680 --> 05:07:37.740]  Well, Alex, you turned out to be right.
[05:07:37.759 --> 05:07:39.580]  This wasn't a fair proceeding.
[05:07:39.740 --> 05:07:46.700]  Unfortunately, the bankruptcy trustee has guaranteed himself Major litigation for the rest of his Leisman career.
[05:07:46.959 --> 05:07:49.540]  He's going to be sued because he acted corruptly.
[05:07:49.779 --> 05:07:57.240]  In fact, once Matt Gaetz is Attorney General, I think you should examine this entire procedure because there's epic corruption here.
[05:07:57.540 --> 05:07:59.740]  You know, we did put together a very good bid.
[05:07:59.860 --> 05:08:06.259]  Now, I think, Alex, we may have no choice but to bid on MSNBC to buy that because perhaps that could be repurposed.
[05:08:06.380 --> 05:08:09.459]  It's for sale and they're making no money.
[05:08:10.700 --> 05:08:18.869]  This is a tragedy, but as I predicted, You know, Infowars, while it was great as an institution, Alex Jones, you are what matters.
[05:08:19.069 --> 05:08:21.150]  And they cannot shut you up.
[05:08:21.229 --> 05:08:22.569]  They will not shut you up.
[05:08:22.569 --> 05:08:24.889]  In fact, here we are right now.
[05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:33.549]  And I really hope that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, will hopefully be watching this, because truth will never really be silenced.
[05:08:33.669 --> 05:08:34.669]  It cannot be done.
[05:08:34.970 --> 05:08:37.430]  Let's move to the important news of the day.
[05:08:37.930 --> 05:08:41.610]  I am over the moon about the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:44.509]  I am a friend of his.
[05:08:44.689 --> 05:08:47.509]  We're not close, but we are more than acquaintances.
[05:08:47.729 --> 05:08:56.590]  I strongly supported the coming together of the America Great Movement with the America Make America Healthy Movement.
[05:08:56.590 --> 05:08:59.270]  I'm very happy with this decision.
[05:08:59.490 --> 05:09:13.139]  I do think there will be a fight over I'm equally excited, of course, about the appointment of Tulsi Gabbard, which we broke on the final Infowars show.
[05:09:13.279 --> 05:09:14.240]  I'm pretty proud of that.
[05:09:14.520 --> 05:09:26.779]  The president, who's always a very thoughtful guy, knew I was a major advocate for Bringing Tulsi into the campaign, then bringing her into the Republican Party, and then serving in her administration.
[05:09:27.020 --> 05:09:38.479]  He did me the courtesy of sending me his statement before he posted it, and I sent it immediately to InfoWars so we could share the good news with the American people.
[05:09:39.020 --> 05:09:55.349]  Things are shaping up in such a way where you can see the panic On the left, I mean, wherever John Brennan is right now, he is shitting his pants because he knows there is no statute of limitations on treason,
[05:09:55.549 --> 05:09:59.310]  folks, and his acts were treasonous, and this can be proven.
[05:09:59.450 --> 05:10:00.810]  No, it's not about revenge.
[05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:02.250]  Don't try that headline.
[05:10:02.490 --> 05:10:03.790]  It's about justice.
[05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:06.009]  You tried to destroy Donald Trump.
[05:10:06.150 --> 05:10:08.130]  You tried to destroy his family.
[05:10:08.369 --> 05:10:10.810]  You tried to bankrupt him.
[05:10:10.869 --> 05:10:12.150]  You tried to put him in jail.
[05:10:12.389 --> 05:10:14.029]  You tried to keep him off the ballot.
[05:10:14.709 --> 05:10:16.689]  You tried to destroy Alex Jones.
[05:10:16.869 --> 05:10:18.270]  You tried to destroy General Flynn.
[05:10:18.450 --> 05:10:20.270]  You tried to destroy Paul Manafort.
[05:10:20.529 --> 05:10:22.889]  Now it is your turn in the barrel.
[05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:25.970]  You've broken laws, and you know it, and it's provable.
[05:10:26.090 --> 05:10:28.709]  It's all there, by the way, in John Durham's report.
[05:10:29.040 --> 05:10:34.759]  No statute of limitations on treason, my friends, so I think we're going to have an age of accountability.
[05:10:35.159 --> 05:10:39.240]  But that's not what the Trump administration is going to be about.
[05:10:39.560 --> 05:10:50.540]  What it's going to be about is returning America to a golden age of prosperity and peace and opportunity and justice and security.
[05:10:50.860 --> 05:11:06.630]  Trump, who I spoke to last night, He clearly understands that his legacy, the way he cements his legacy, to go down as one of our greatest presidents like Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt,
[05:11:06.889 --> 05:11:16.000]  and yes, Dwight Eisenhower, who I think is vastly underrated as a great president, is to bring the country together.
[05:11:16.380 --> 05:11:30.580]  And the best way to bring the country together, the best way to unify the country, is by making us safe and prosperous and free again, to restore the concept of peace through strength when we're so strong.
[05:11:31.069 --> 05:11:38.389]  That the Russians don't dare invade our allies, where the Chinese don't dare move on Taiwan.
[05:11:38.810 --> 05:11:49.650]  This is going to be the hallmark of Donald Trump, is going to be an entire generation of peace and prosperity, a so-called golden age.
[05:11:49.810 --> 05:11:54.209]  So, no, he's not Plotting revenge against his enemies.
[05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:57.470]  Yes, he does want those who broke the law should be held responsible.
[05:11:58.169 --> 05:12:04.450]  I mean, Adam Schiff broke not only House rules, but he broke the law in his Russian collusion lies.
[05:12:04.709 --> 05:12:06.189]  And here's what you're going to find out.
[05:12:06.369 --> 05:12:10.169]  Senator, no one, not even you, is above the law.
[05:12:10.409 --> 05:12:16.430]  So the hysteria going on on the left, it is kind of funny to watch.
[05:12:19.130 --> 05:12:27.529]  We are, I mean, watching these guys meltdown on television, and it's entertaining.
[05:12:28.029 --> 05:12:31.970]  But you see Donald Trump building a dream team.
[05:12:32.599 --> 05:12:41.119]  Now, I am disappointed in the decision by the Senate Republican Caucus to choose John Thune.
[05:12:41.279 --> 05:12:52.580]  You may remember Thune wanted Donald Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee for president when the so-called NBC grabbed him by the you-know-what tape dropped.
[05:12:52.580 --> 05:12:57.619]  He wanted Trump to be dumped and replaced by Mike Pence.
[05:12:57.869 --> 05:13:00.990]  Fortunately, that didn't happen because Mike Pence would have lost.
[05:13:01.130 --> 05:13:03.490]  Only Donald Trump could win that election.
[05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:09.849]  And it was the Senate Republican Caucus that made that decision.
[05:13:10.090 --> 05:13:14.549]  Unfortunately, Senator Scott found out the difference between a caucus and a cactus.
[05:13:15.169 --> 05:13:18.750]  Well, in a cactus, all of the pricks are on the outside.
[05:13:23.970 --> 05:13:28.389]  So I'm kind of interested, Alex, in your plan going forward.
[05:13:28.630 --> 05:13:33.849]  I said that you would not be silenced, that they could take Infowars.
[05:13:34.250 --> 05:13:36.569]  Sadly, you turned out to be right about that.
[05:13:36.669 --> 05:13:41.110]  It was a rigged and corrupted, and therefore I think an illegal bankruptcy proceeding.
[05:13:41.110 --> 05:13:44.790]  There will definitely be litigation involving everyone involved.
[05:13:45.049 --> 05:13:50.299]  I wonder about those guys at The Onion, because This is of no value to them whatsoever.
[05:13:50.840 --> 05:13:56.659]  They get a nice headline, but they're going to end up paying millions of dollars for something that has no value to them.
[05:13:57.919 --> 05:14:01.639]  Infowars may be yesterday, but Alex Jones will not be silenced.
[05:14:01.840 --> 05:14:08.119]  And the other important voices That were on Infowars will not be silenced.
[05:14:08.299 --> 05:14:15.279]  My good friend, my former co-host, Owen Schroyer, he will not be silenced.
[05:14:15.479 --> 05:14:21.880]  He will just move to another platform, and the millions of people that follow him now will continue to follow him.
[05:14:21.900 --> 05:14:25.279]  Well, Roger, to be clear, I should tell her about the future of the operations.
[05:14:26.279 --> 05:14:32.360]  Clearly what they did was insane, and doesn't look legal to me, and the judge really freaked out.
[05:14:35.529 --> 05:14:37.169]  I have a transcript of it right here.
[05:14:37.950 --> 05:14:47.310]  And it's surreal, but it's just like when they tried in late May with the last trustee to just say, I'm appointed by the Justice Department.
[05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:48.169]  You're closed.
[05:14:48.369 --> 05:14:51.310]  And the judge fired him over it.
[05:14:51.330 --> 05:14:53.909]  And then they're having an auction.
[05:14:54.270 --> 05:14:57.049]  And then no one's allowed to bid up on the auction.
[05:14:57.069 --> 05:14:58.490]  And then a lower bid is given.
[05:14:59.900 --> 05:15:02.959]  It pledges my future earnings as the way to buy it.
[05:15:03.080 --> 05:15:05.080]  It's so cockamamie, it doesn't even make sense.
[05:15:05.680 --> 05:15:07.240]  The law says you can't do that.
[05:15:08.939 --> 05:15:13.180]  So the judge couldn't even believe it today in the hearing.
[05:15:14.319 --> 05:15:15.900]  They're just completely flabbergasted.
[05:15:15.919 --> 05:15:21.720]  So I was listening to you while I was asking you to host because I was getting this information so I can answer your questions properly.
[05:15:22.759 --> 05:15:24.819]  Believe me, it's not that I'm walking away because I don't hear what you have to say.
[05:15:24.880 --> 05:15:25.540]  That's why you're here, Roger.
[05:15:25.700 --> 05:15:26.560]  We're all ears.
[05:15:26.860 --> 05:15:29.319]  So thank you, StoneZone.com.
[05:15:30.240 --> 05:15:33.340]  But this shows the desperateness and the hysteria.
[05:15:33.380 --> 05:15:34.200]  And I ask you a question.
[05:15:34.279 --> 05:15:36.520]  Are they going to capitulate and lick their wounds?
[05:15:36.540 --> 05:15:38.520]  Or are they, as you said, playing possum?
[05:15:39.819 --> 05:15:46.419]  Look at the raid on polymarkets, who's even nonpartisan for accurately predicting Trump's win.
[05:15:46.580 --> 05:15:49.680]  Well, so do we, by the FBI. Look at Alfie Oaks.
[05:15:50.299 --> 05:15:56.919]  Look at all of the other activity that they are engaged in.
[05:15:57.630 --> 05:15:58.470]  Right now.
[05:15:58.669 --> 05:16:00.830]  I mean, this goes on and on.
[05:16:00.950 --> 05:16:08.069]  And they're little systems that think they're invincible, while the whole world's waking up to them and sick of their crap.
[05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:10.389]  But everything we're seeing...
[05:16:12.690 --> 05:16:16.810]  Blinken is pledging everything to Ukraine, which they launder back in the last weeks.
[05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:25.450]  You've got Pennsylvania counties saying they're going to count illegal alien votes and they don't care if they're not even postmarked illegally against state law and federal rulings.
[05:16:26.049 --> 05:16:31.689]  So what I'm seeing from the left, with all these new J6 arrests and stuff, they've said, we're going crazy.
[05:16:32.450 --> 05:16:34.450]  I mean, are those death throes?
[05:16:34.790 --> 05:16:37.389]  I don't mean that literally, you know, like flopping around.
[05:16:38.229 --> 05:16:39.669]  What the hell are you predicting?
[05:16:39.909 --> 05:16:42.150]  Because, I mean, this is—these people are maniacs.
[05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:46.729]  Well, Alex, unfortunately, I have to jump off here in a minute, but let me answer your question.
[05:16:47.389 --> 05:16:55.750]  First of all, the U.S. Senate can absolutely refuse to seat Bob Casey if they decide that he has not been appropriately elected, and they should do that.
[05:16:55.930 --> 05:16:58.290]  So it doesn't really matter how many votes they steal.
[05:16:58.470 --> 05:17:00.490]  He's 29,000 votes ahead.
[05:17:00.669 --> 05:17:03.330]  David McCormick, the Republican, he won this seat.
[05:17:03.369 --> 05:17:07.090]  They're trying to manufacture votes by people who are not eligible to vote.
[05:17:07.400 --> 05:17:08.419]  Easily solved.
[05:17:08.619 --> 05:17:15.540]  The Senate Republican Caucus, as they did with Senator Wyman from New Hampshire back in the 70s, simply refused to seat him.
[05:17:15.720 --> 05:17:16.139]  Period.
[05:17:16.400 --> 05:17:17.099]  End of story.
[05:17:17.319 --> 05:17:18.779]  All it takes is courage.
[05:17:20.069 --> 05:17:24.229]  I don't know what they're up to, but whatever it is, it is diabolical.
[05:17:24.669 --> 05:17:26.590]  Alex, I've got to jump to my next broadcast.
[05:17:26.810 --> 05:17:27.909]  It was great to be with you.
[05:17:28.009 --> 05:17:29.750]  Great to be with you on the new platform.
[05:17:29.909 --> 05:17:30.509]  God bless you.
[05:17:30.709 --> 05:17:43.130]  Thanks for letting me drop in here today so we could celebrate together the great appointments of RFK and Tulsi Gabbard and point out that the bankruptcy proceeding regarding in force was illegitimate, illegal.
[05:17:43.389 --> 05:17:45.770]  There's going to be litigation, I assure you.
[05:17:45.950 --> 05:17:46.770]  Oh, it's already started.
[05:17:48.020 --> 05:17:49.119]  That's an easy prediction.
[05:17:49.279 --> 05:17:49.680]  You're right, sir.
[05:17:49.840 --> 05:17:50.139]  Thank you.
[05:17:50.759 --> 05:17:51.319]  It's already begun.
[05:17:52.840 --> 05:17:54.000]  Oh, my goodness.
[05:17:54.540 --> 05:17:56.020]  The Clone Wars have begun.
[05:17:57.200 --> 05:17:59.599]  Oh, my goody-goody gun drops.
[05:18:00.139 --> 05:18:08.020]  I mean, I was told what was in the hearing, and now I got this transcript.
[05:18:11.340 --> 05:18:11.860]  Jesus.
[05:18:12.340 --> 05:18:12.919]  Excuse me, Lord.
[05:18:13.680 --> 05:18:14.200]  Um...
[05:18:16.860 --> 05:18:22.020]  I mean, they literally, the left thinks you could do anything to a Trump supporter.
[05:18:22.799 --> 05:18:24.619]  They can make up whatever they want.
[05:18:24.720 --> 05:18:25.819]  They can do whatever they want.
[05:18:25.919 --> 05:18:27.119]  They can accuse you whatever they want.
[05:18:27.220 --> 05:18:28.619]  They can change the rules whenever they want.
[05:18:28.860 --> 05:18:33.599]  They can just run around like it's just, there's no tomorrow.
[05:18:34.380 --> 05:18:40.619]  They can human traffic masses of children and disappear them like it's no big deal.
[05:18:40.840 --> 05:18:44.380]  They can start World War III. They can lock everything down and get everybody poisoned shots.
[05:18:45.349 --> 05:18:46.790]  And man, you know Trump's pissed.
[05:18:46.950 --> 05:18:47.909]  I mean, RFK Jr.
[05:18:48.009 --> 05:18:49.090]  going after Big Pharma, they know.
[05:18:49.229 --> 05:18:50.349]  Trump knows how he was set up.
[05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:53.750]  Tulsi Gabbards is the Director of National Intelligence.
[05:18:53.930 --> 05:18:55.509]  Matt Gaetz is the Attorney General.
[05:18:56.209 --> 05:18:58.270]  And this is just a total bum rush.
[05:18:58.409 --> 05:19:05.630]  They'll try to not confirm these people, but it's just they're going to tear them apart with their communication skills in these hearings in the Senate.
[05:19:05.930 --> 05:19:09.049]  These hearings will be as big as Clarence Thomas' approval hearings.
[05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:11.689]  It will just, it will be their destruction.
[05:19:12.849 --> 05:19:18.630]  I mean, Gates will destroy them in the confirmation process.
[05:19:19.189 --> 05:19:19.790]  RFK Jr.
[05:19:19.970 --> 05:19:22.389]  will destroy them in the confirmation process.
[05:19:22.750 --> 05:19:26.330]  Tulsi Gabbards will destroy them in the confirmation process.
[05:19:26.529 --> 05:19:32.150]  All the other ones, other than Marco Rubio at State Department, which he's rolled over to Trump, you know, eight years ago.
[05:19:32.250 --> 05:19:33.389]  But boy, he was a backstabber before that.
[05:19:33.450 --> 05:19:35.810]  You can say it's all politics, but he's got the neocon pedigree.
[05:19:36.009 --> 05:19:37.990]  I mean, maybe a leopard changed his spots.
[05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.729]  I don't know.
[05:19:40.000 --> 05:19:47.560]  Only God can judge that, but we're going to be judging the neocons' actions very, very, very intensely.
[05:19:47.659 --> 05:19:53.000]  I mean, we know he loves the Ukraine war, so, you know, I've just got some issues.
[05:19:54.240 --> 05:19:59.200]  Well, my old friend, probably known him about 18, 19 years, Gary Franci, popular talk show host.
[05:19:59.299 --> 05:20:02.119]  We're going to Chicago with him for a big 9-11 truth rally.
[05:20:02.340 --> 05:20:03.340]  Oh, that's got to be...
[05:20:04.540 --> 05:20:06.040]  Gosh, that's got to be 20 years ago.
[05:20:06.700 --> 05:20:09.119]  And he is here with us today.
[05:20:09.340 --> 05:20:14.180]  Been wanting to get him on to talk about just the world, Trump in general, what the left's doing, what they're going to do next.
[05:20:15.580 --> 05:20:17.520]  It's not just God-tier trolling by Trump.
[05:20:17.599 --> 05:20:19.759]  No, he really understands they tried to kill him.
[05:20:19.819 --> 05:20:21.680]  He's making a real assault on the globalists.
[05:20:22.400 --> 05:20:26.240]  I mean, this is so good, it's hard to believe.
[05:20:26.380 --> 05:20:28.159]  But the system is in total panic mode.
[05:20:28.500 --> 05:20:29.599]  It's totally insane.
[05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:34.990]  And then we've got Laura Logan coming up here in about 25 minutes.
[05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:39.970]  We got Elijah Schaefer and a lot of other people here today.
[05:20:40.810 --> 05:20:43.529]  And Gary, I'm listening to you, but I've been on the air since 8 a.m.
[05:20:43.630 --> 05:20:43.930]  this morning.
[05:20:44.250 --> 05:20:47.009]  They shut down Infowars, wrongfully threw us out.
[05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:51.909]  They didn't kick us out of the building, but turned everything off, wouldn't let us get off the air.
[05:20:52.849 --> 05:20:58.610]  And then we're in the court basically saying that, oh, we can't have men here.
[05:20:58.770 --> 05:21:02.689]  I mean, it's, you know, it's, who knows what they'll do or whatever.
[05:21:02.849 --> 05:21:05.790]  I mean, it's just the same crap over and over again.
[05:21:07.200 --> 05:21:09.500]  Like I'm stealing my own building or something.
[05:21:10.360 --> 05:21:14.880]  It's just bizarre that they won't give up.
[05:21:14.919 --> 05:21:16.119]  They just get crazier and crazier.
[05:21:16.279 --> 05:21:20.319]  And it looks like this is really blown up in their face.
[05:21:20.400 --> 05:21:22.299]  And I'm going to talk to my lawyers more.
[05:21:22.659 --> 05:21:25.040]  I got off the phone to come back in here with Roger and you.
[05:21:25.259 --> 05:21:26.819]  So, Gary, I'll be back in a few minutes.
[05:21:26.819 --> 05:21:30.900]  I'm listening to you in one ear, on the other, reading transcripts, not laying around.
[05:21:31.180 --> 05:21:32.279]  I want to just say this briefly.
[05:21:33.709 --> 05:21:35.189]  It takes money to fight back.
[05:21:35.369 --> 05:21:36.029]  We'll beat them in court.
[05:21:36.209 --> 05:21:38.909]  We're having a bunch of victories They haven't hit the news yet.
[05:21:39.770 --> 05:21:41.689]  And separate issues relating to this.
[05:21:41.889 --> 05:21:43.130]  That's why you're not hearing about it.
[05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:44.650]  My lawyers are like, great.
[05:21:45.549 --> 05:21:46.610]  What matters is we win.
[05:21:47.349 --> 05:21:48.290]  This is historic.
[05:21:48.950 --> 05:21:50.490]  It's not just a talk show you're backing.
[05:21:50.869 --> 05:21:52.689]  It's people under globalist attack.
[05:21:52.930 --> 05:21:54.110]  It's something iconic.
[05:21:54.290 --> 05:22:04.150]  The enemy recognizes as iconic, as a symbol of liberty, that they want to shut me down so they can build a straw man and turn me into a devil to be used against the general public, the fake Alex Jones.
[05:22:05.400 --> 05:22:06.560]  They want my identity.
[05:22:06.560 --> 05:22:10.159]  So please help me save my identity so it's not used as a weapon against you.
[05:22:10.819 --> 05:22:12.619]  Please rally behind us.
[05:22:12.700 --> 05:22:13.439]  Our work is so important.
[05:22:13.560 --> 05:22:17.380]  You're backing yourself and your own future and your own existential safety.
[05:22:17.979 --> 05:22:23.639]  I mean, you understand that your whole future hangs in the balance, as Elon Musk said.
[05:22:24.360 --> 05:22:24.720]  Okay?
[05:22:24.959 --> 05:22:27.000]  And now we've got a good chance to turn things around.
[05:22:27.020 --> 05:22:29.180]  But I need your support at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[05:22:29.259 --> 05:22:29.619]  Incredible.
[05:22:30.139 --> 05:22:30.900]  Patriot apparel.
[05:22:31.560 --> 05:22:31.919]  Infowars.
[05:22:32.400 --> 05:22:34.459]  You know, limited edition memorial stuff.
[05:22:35.439 --> 05:22:36.479]  That belongs to the world.
[05:22:37.099 --> 05:22:41.560]  The fundraiser posters where we get some real funds in.
[05:22:41.599 --> 05:22:42.799]  When you get that, that really helps us.
[05:22:42.979 --> 05:22:44.939]  There's not a lot of markup in the great supplements and other stuff.
[05:22:45.099 --> 05:22:46.500]  Not a ton in the t-shirts.
[05:22:47.110 --> 05:22:49.950]  You know, those t-shirts, the big ones are like $17 a piece, so we're selling like $30.
[05:22:50.349 --> 05:22:52.490]  Then the sponsors got to get money.
[05:22:52.529 --> 05:22:53.310]  They got to have their people.
[05:22:53.409 --> 05:22:54.169]  They make them in Arkansas.
[05:22:54.549 --> 05:22:56.110]  So, you know, on a t-shirt, we're getting like $5, $6.
[05:22:56.490 --> 05:22:56.729]  Great.
[05:22:56.810 --> 05:22:59.830]  We sell a ton of them, but, you know, it takes money to fight these wars.
[05:23:00.090 --> 05:23:03.930]  But if you get the limited edition posters...
[05:23:05.000 --> 05:23:07.159]  And there's four of them now, back-to-back-to-back.
[05:23:07.319 --> 05:23:08.400]  Trump, incredible poster.
[05:23:08.479 --> 05:23:08.959]  It's my favorite.
[05:23:09.240 --> 05:23:12.439]  Then the Star Wars-esque Alex Jones, the two classic InfoWars.
[05:23:12.540 --> 05:23:12.959]  It's all there.
[05:23:13.139 --> 05:23:26.299]  But this thing has hundreds of amazing Patriot apparel designs, ball caps, hoodies, everything, and the Ultimate CMOS, and the Hydroforce, and the Gut Cleanse, and the Vespro Biobiotic, and the Energy Gummies, and the Sleep Gummies, and they're all the highest quality private label.
[05:23:26.400 --> 05:23:27.919]  These are great products you should get anyways.
[05:23:28.680 --> 05:23:30.779]  And then it funds the second American Revolution.
[05:23:31.119 --> 05:23:32.319]  This isn't a simulation.
[05:23:32.860 --> 05:23:33.959]  You got off your butt.
[05:23:34.040 --> 05:23:34.740]  You voted for Trump.
[05:23:34.840 --> 05:23:35.459]  You donated money.
[05:23:35.520 --> 05:23:36.259]  He got the lawyers.
[05:23:36.400 --> 05:23:37.319]  They blocked most of the stealing.
[05:23:37.599 --> 05:23:38.580]  He got a trifecta.
[05:23:38.700 --> 05:23:40.119]  That's what kicking ass looks like.
[05:23:40.200 --> 05:23:40.779]  This is it!
[05:23:41.419 --> 05:23:43.520]  People always say, Jones, why do you have so much damn energy?
[05:23:44.159 --> 05:23:46.400]  I'm not like that when I'm sitting around at home or out with friends.
[05:23:46.580 --> 05:23:47.880]  I'm very calm and sit back.
[05:23:48.000 --> 05:23:52.639]  We're talking about taking on the globalist new world order that are absolute death cult.
[05:23:52.840 --> 05:23:54.659]  Want to cut all our sons' peckers off.
[05:23:54.799 --> 05:23:55.819]  I mean, Jesus, people.
[05:23:56.080 --> 05:23:57.340]  Let's get it going here.
[05:23:59.310 --> 05:24:01.330]  So, I want to thank Gary French for coming on.
[05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:02.630]  Gary, you got the floor, buddy.
[05:24:03.349 --> 05:24:05.150]  I'm listening to you, but give me 15 minutes.
[05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:06.270]  I'm going to come back and talk to you.
[05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:08.869]  I got some questions, my good old friend.
[05:24:09.150 --> 05:24:09.450]  Go ahead.
[05:24:10.669 --> 05:24:11.709]  Alex Jones, man.
[05:24:11.869 --> 05:24:22.930]  It's an honor to be here with you on this historic day for InfoWars and watching you storm forward into the next incarnation of InfoWars.
[05:24:23.490 --> 05:24:28.810]  And, you know, I've been watching this in the background and my heart has been breaking, but I just want...
[05:24:29.139 --> 05:24:39.040]  Everyone who's watching to know that I wouldn't be in this chair if I didn't look you up 25 years ago.
[05:24:39.479 --> 05:24:50.599]  And it is the work and the foundation that you have laid for so many years that has awoken so many and has created a ripple effect in this next American Revolution.
[05:24:50.599 --> 05:24:52.259]  The revolution that we are in now.
[05:24:52.360 --> 05:24:53.419]  The revolution of the mind.
[05:24:53.580 --> 05:24:55.000]  The revolution of the soul.
[05:24:55.540 --> 05:25:01.590]  And Alex, your work, like I said, it is foundational to what I'm doing.
[05:25:01.689 --> 05:25:03.470]  Yeah, that's us right there.
[05:25:03.790 --> 05:25:06.029]  Back in the day, that was us.
[05:25:06.130 --> 05:25:12.169]  That's when I first met you at the 9-11 Truth event in Chicago, and we marched in the streets.
[05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:16.110]  And if you look in the background right behind me, right there, that's Luke.
[05:25:16.369 --> 05:25:17.509]  That's Luke Rutkowski.
[05:25:17.669 --> 05:25:24.509]  I'll never forget when he was sitting with us, and we were on the L. We were heading downtown, and he had this massive book.
[05:25:25.180 --> 05:25:33.700]  He had this massive book of all of this 9-11 truth, and it's amazing that now we can contain all that information on our phones.
[05:25:33.959 --> 05:25:44.060]  But that just goes to show, you know, back in the day when we would be burning DVDs and passing them out in the streets and hitting it with a bullhorn, I mean, that is how we got the message out.
[05:25:44.279 --> 05:25:51.919]  And then, of course, suddenly there were platforms that allowed us to share videos instantaneously, and that revolutionized everything.
[05:25:52.419 --> 05:25:54.479]  But I mean, I take it back even beforehand.
[05:25:54.479 --> 05:26:01.439]  When I was on radio, I was on GCN, I was on RBN, I was on WTPRN, and we were doing everything that we could to get the message out.
[05:26:02.040 --> 05:26:05.180]  And the thing is, Alex, the message never dies.
[05:26:05.639 --> 05:26:14.500]  They can try to take your building, they can try to take your cameras, they can try to take your lights and your computers, but it's never going to kill the message.
[05:26:15.200 --> 05:26:22.099]  And I know you have a lifeboat that's ready to set sail, and I know that you've got a million soldiers, more than a million.
[05:26:22.200 --> 05:26:24.459]  You've got tens of millions of people behind you.
[05:26:24.779 --> 05:26:27.400]  And I'm one of those people, and I'm proud to say that.
[05:26:27.880 --> 05:26:31.860]  And looking forward to what's about to happen, you know, we've got...
[05:26:31.860 --> 05:26:32.900]  There we are.
[05:26:33.060 --> 05:26:34.720]  That was at the hotel.
[05:26:35.639 --> 05:26:37.979]  We were sipping on some really nice tequila.
[05:26:38.340 --> 05:26:41.119]  That was a great night, and we went and had some steaks afterwards.
[05:26:41.479 --> 05:26:42.500]  That was when...
[05:26:43.100 --> 05:26:49.360]  Yeah, when I came down to Texas and I did that little tour, and then I immediately got COVID afterwards.
[05:26:50.419 --> 05:26:51.259]  That was fun.
[05:26:51.619 --> 05:26:53.459]  But of course, I never took the jab.
[05:26:53.599 --> 05:26:56.060]  I never did any of that stuff.
[05:26:56.180 --> 05:26:58.500]  But I did take ivermectin, I'll tell you that.
[05:26:58.700 --> 05:27:01.299]  That stuff fixed me in a second.
[05:27:01.680 --> 05:27:11.080]  But going back to where we began, where we are going, watching InfoWars grow over all these years, Alex, I remember...
[05:27:11.779 --> 05:27:25.840]  Man, I remember going to one of your first studios and you were showing me around and you had like this tiny little cubby, like in the back, and it had like a glass window, like a tiny little radio cubby, and that's where you did your show.
[05:27:26.119 --> 05:27:31.500]  And in the back you had this warehouse and you were showing me all the movies and all the books and everything you had.
[05:27:32.299 --> 05:27:34.099]  And I was so honored to be there.
[05:27:34.200 --> 05:27:35.659]  And yeah, this is when I came down there.
[05:27:35.819 --> 05:27:37.040]  And we went to...
[05:27:37.040 --> 05:27:38.459]  We were on the show.
[05:27:39.020 --> 05:27:41.319]  And yeah, that was a great moment.
[05:27:41.560 --> 05:27:42.060]  Just another one.
[05:27:42.180 --> 05:27:47.459]  Years later, after I went to your first studio, I was so honored to be there.
[05:27:47.580 --> 05:27:49.939]  I just remember that so vividly.
[05:27:50.500 --> 05:27:58.279]  And then years later, we went back and we shot some documentaries with the late William Lewis, Camp FEMA, Enemy of the State.
[05:27:58.860 --> 05:28:01.799]  And then we filmed Don't Tread on Me.
[05:28:02.590 --> 05:28:06.610]  You were prominently featured in all those films, and it was an honor to work with you on those projects.
[05:28:06.849 --> 05:28:12.349]  For example, we're looking at Camp FEMA, going back to that.
[05:28:13.169 --> 05:28:19.889]  What we're seeing now with the FEMA camps that are being set up in North Carolina, these camps are empty.
[05:28:20.110 --> 05:28:21.209]  What are they waiting for?
[05:28:22.389 --> 05:28:27.150]  We've got this DOD directive that has just come down that authorizes lethal force against Americans.
[05:28:27.330 --> 05:28:31.150]  We've got Jeremy Raskin who's saying they're not going to certify the election results.
[05:28:31.389 --> 05:28:35.310]  I mean, are they waiting for a straight-up political uprising?
[05:28:35.490 --> 05:28:38.290]  Are they waiting for people to fill those camps?
[05:28:38.610 --> 05:28:43.630]  I mean, of course, they're there with the Hurricane Helene response, which has been dismal.
[05:28:43.790 --> 05:28:51.090]  And then, of course, you have the whole element of FEMA getting caught, skipping over Trump supporters' houses.
[05:28:51.720 --> 05:29:00.159]  I mean, the hatred for conservatives and Trump supporters and people who love this country is baked into that agency.
[05:29:00.540 --> 05:29:10.459]  And personally, watching all these Trump appointments, we'll be talking about that later tonight on my show, but watching all these Trump appointments come through, I am so excited.
[05:29:11.209 --> 05:29:13.909]  To watch this revolution.
[05:29:14.349 --> 05:29:21.389]  I mean, they're taking a razor blade to the fat of this government, and they're going to cut it right off.
[05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:28.189]  I mean, okay, the fact that we have Elon Musk with the DOGE, right?
[05:29:28.349 --> 05:29:31.049]  The Department of Government Accountability.
[05:29:31.650 --> 05:29:37.310]  I mean, listen, what they're going to be doing with that organization, government efficiency, right?
[05:29:37.939 --> 05:29:51.159]  When I saw his tweet the other day, and he said they're going to put a website up, and the American people are going to finally get to see all of the ridiculous programs that their taxpayers are funding.
[05:29:51.560 --> 05:30:01.159]  Now, we only get a snapshot of those things when you see Rand Paul go on the Senate floor and rail about them, or you hear other people talk about spending money for money.
[05:30:03.090 --> 05:30:04.209]  We're good to go.
[05:30:04.209 --> 05:30:12.189]  We're good to go.
[05:30:13.229 --> 05:30:30.950]  We're good to go.
[05:30:31.650 --> 05:30:43.069]  I mean, the fact, when I saw those tweets come out, and I saw Ron Paul talking about this, and I see Elon Musk quote tweeting him, I almost fell out of my chair.
[05:30:43.790 --> 05:30:58.630]  Because the amount of work that you have put in, that I have put in over these past 25 years, I mean, when I ran that super pack, Alex, for Ron Paul, I will never forget the phone call.
[05:30:59.659 --> 05:31:01.939]  I was sitting in my house in North Rick, Illinois.
[05:31:02.299 --> 05:31:05.240]  I was in my living room and I got Alex Jones on the phone.
[05:31:05.900 --> 05:31:08.700]  And I said, Alex, you know, I just started this super pack.
[05:31:08.819 --> 05:31:11.959]  He's like, oh, Franchi, Franchi, you're swimming with sharks, man.
[05:31:12.099 --> 05:31:15.520]  You're in the middle of the Atlantic and the Titanic's bearing down on you.
[05:31:17.580 --> 05:31:20.020]  I will never forget that warning you gave me.
[05:31:20.380 --> 05:31:25.779]  And it was definitely a good warning because I got out of that super pack.
[05:31:26.119 --> 05:31:32.200]  The amount of bureaucracy and reporting and everything that was required was absolutely ridiculous.
[05:31:32.700 --> 05:31:34.479]  But it taught me something.
[05:31:35.159 --> 05:31:38.080]  It taught me the value of this microphone.
[05:31:38.240 --> 05:31:39.799]  It taught me the value of my camera.
[05:31:39.979 --> 05:31:42.080]  It taught me the value of media.
[05:31:42.439 --> 05:31:51.040]  And of course, we saw that with Aaron Russo's film, America, Freedom, and Fascism, which also helped put Ron Paul on the map, helped spur the Ron Paul revolution.
[05:31:51.139 --> 05:31:53.220]  And I believe that all these things are connected.
[05:31:53.659 --> 05:32:02.939]  Every single one of these things has led us to the point where we now finally are going to see Ron Paul working with Elon Musk to cut the fat of government.
[05:32:03.099 --> 05:32:04.740]  You couldn't ask for anything better.
[05:32:04.900 --> 05:32:09.520]  But we can't sit here and just pop champagne and celebrate all day.
[05:32:09.919 --> 05:32:11.779]  Because now the real fight begins.
[05:32:12.220 --> 05:32:21.439]  They are going to try every single thing in their power to try to stop any momentum of this administration.
[05:32:22.669 --> 05:32:29.430]  Now, he's putting key players in place, and he's got his plan to get the recess appointments, is what appears to be happening in the background.
[05:32:29.709 --> 05:32:37.790]  You know, that secret weapon, more or less, with the statutes that he can employ in working with the Speaker of the House.
[05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:51.369]  I think that's genius, to get the recess appointments, to just hit the ground running, and especially draining the swamp with respect to anyone who touched the Afghanistan debacle, having to just get rid of all those people.
[05:32:52.740 --> 05:32:56.659]  I was actually talking with Ann VanderSteele about this last night.
[05:32:57.279 --> 05:33:04.860]  And we were talking about this Elon Musk, this Department of Government Efficiency.
[05:33:05.880 --> 05:33:07.479]  And here's where I got concerned.
[05:33:08.319 --> 05:33:11.520]  And it kind of like just kind of flowed out as I was talking to her.
[05:33:11.720 --> 05:33:16.819]  And I said, you know, Ann, they tried to kill him twice that we know of.
[05:33:17.180 --> 05:33:22.319]  They threw every single crazy law against him to...
[05:33:22.680 --> 05:33:29.060]  We're good to go.
[05:33:52.610 --> 05:34:00.830]  Those people who are working wherever in that university or wherever they decide they're going to investigate transgender monkeys.
[05:34:01.409 --> 05:34:03.250]  Whoever those people are, right?
[05:34:03.889 --> 05:34:13.369]  When their $500,000 grant is cut, that's just one aspect of people who are going to be pissed.
[05:34:13.810 --> 05:34:14.630]  One group of people.
[05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:17.650]  Now think about all the other groups.
[05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:23.549]  There's going to be a lot of new enemies when Donald Trump Puts his hand on that Bible.
[05:34:24.110 --> 05:34:29.110]  So, just as he puts his hand on the Bible, we must put our hand on the Bible.
[05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:37.849]  We must pray with every ounce of our spirit for protection for this country, for Donald Trump.
[05:34:38.009 --> 05:34:40.150]  And that's what my biggest fear is.
[05:34:40.569 --> 05:34:42.590]  See, first of all, I'm going to say this.
[05:34:42.669 --> 05:34:47.549]  I do truly believe that God has his hand on Donald Trump.
[05:34:47.669 --> 05:34:48.590]  I believe he knows that.
[05:34:48.689 --> 05:34:49.569]  I believe you know that.
[05:34:49.689 --> 05:34:50.509]  A lot of people know that.
[05:34:50.849 --> 05:34:58.630]  I mean, the fact that he turned his head at that last minute, that last second, to look at that chart, okay?
[05:34:59.310 --> 05:35:01.990]  I mean, that was a divine moment.
[05:35:02.790 --> 05:35:03.189]  So...
[05:35:04.520 --> 05:35:16.779]  All the things leading up, the lawfare, everything is just falling to the wayside now and giving Trump a clear path, but the demons are going to get very, very angry the more that they are exposed.
[05:35:17.319 --> 05:35:28.479]  I'm talking about the actual spiritual demons, and I'm talking about the demons who are in the government itself, the people who are working against us.
[05:35:29.919 --> 05:35:35.950]  And this is where The power of prayer, the power of information continues.
[05:35:36.349 --> 05:35:38.869]  And that's where you are going to continue.
[05:35:39.169 --> 05:35:43.290]  See, they can try to take InfoWars, but they cannot take the message.
[05:35:43.490 --> 05:35:45.709]  They cannot take Alex Jones.
[05:35:46.610 --> 05:35:47.430]  You can't.
[05:35:47.849 --> 05:36:01.569]  And I said this in one of my shows, my show, I think it was two nights ago, because we were talking about this, and my producer, Brian, sent me the link, and I was watching it, and I was First of all, I said, man, Alex looks damn good.
[05:36:01.709 --> 05:36:03.189]  He looks healthy, man.
[05:36:03.349 --> 05:36:04.349]  He looks great.
[05:36:04.950 --> 05:36:10.709]  And I was just taken aback because I know that this has taken a toll on your health, Alex.
[05:36:11.509 --> 05:36:16.250]  And looking at all the photos from the court cases and all your different appearances.
[05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:19.630]  But man, you look like you are in the prime right now.
[05:36:20.029 --> 05:36:21.770]  And that's where we need you.
[05:36:22.409 --> 05:36:25.009]  And so they can try to take the message.
[05:36:25.189 --> 05:36:28.549]  I mean, they can try to take the building and they can try to take the brand.
[05:36:28.630 --> 05:36:31.790]  But as I said, it doesn't matter.
[05:36:32.549 --> 05:36:38.970]  Alex Jones could be sitting there on his cell phone and he could be streaming live to X. He could be doing it from wherever.
[05:36:39.189 --> 05:36:40.590]  He doesn't need to have a desk.
[05:36:40.770 --> 05:36:41.889]  He doesn't need to have the cameras.
[05:36:42.090 --> 05:36:43.569]  He doesn't need to have the lights.
[05:36:44.790 --> 05:36:49.389]  Because Alex Jones has it built into his heart.
[05:36:49.750 --> 05:36:51.909]  Alex Jones has it built into his mind.
[05:36:52.819 --> 05:36:54.599]  And he spits truth from his tongue.
[05:36:55.680 --> 05:36:57.759]  And everybody knows this.
[05:36:58.259 --> 05:37:00.040]  And that's why they're so terrified.
[05:37:00.419 --> 05:37:05.319]  So let all the material possessions and technology, let them fade away.
[05:37:06.599 --> 05:37:15.180]  Because the new incarnation of Alex Jones is going to be stronger than they could have ever imagined.
[05:37:15.939 --> 05:37:18.159]  And also I made the analogy.
[05:37:18.340 --> 05:37:19.819]  I said, you're like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[05:37:20.119 --> 05:37:22.279]  You are like the teacher.
[05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:27.950]  You know, passing down the knowledge of the Force to so many people.
[05:37:29.209 --> 05:37:33.889]  And then all of a sudden, a Sith Lord decides to come in and strike you down.
[05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:37.529]  Oh, yes.
[05:37:37.930 --> 05:37:41.909]  But Alex Jones returns stronger than ever.
[05:37:41.909 --> 05:37:44.709]  And he can be anywhere at any time.
[05:37:45.610 --> 05:37:56.979]  So, when I first learned, maybe it was about a month ago, And I was communicating with Roger Stone, and I was very concerned about what would happen.
[05:37:57.500 --> 05:37:58.659]  There it is.
[05:37:58.779 --> 05:37:59.319]  There's the moment.
[05:37:59.540 --> 05:38:00.080]  There he is.
[05:38:00.119 --> 05:38:00.580]  There's Alex.
[05:38:01.180 --> 05:38:04.340]  And there is the deep state coming after him.
[05:38:05.700 --> 05:38:09.180]  When I was talking with Roger, we were texting back and forth.
[05:38:09.200 --> 05:38:12.119]  I was very concerned about what would happen in this auction.
[05:38:12.119 --> 05:38:18.779]  And I said, you know, can't we just get some billionaires to come in and just buy up InfoWars and just put Alex back in the chair?
[05:38:19.099 --> 05:38:21.720]  And I guess there was a lot of discussion about that in the background.
[05:38:22.479 --> 05:38:26.159]  But what's important here is that it doesn't even matter.
[05:38:26.659 --> 05:38:37.819]  You know, the team that you surround yourself with, I mean, Rob Dew and Daria, like, those people have been with you for so long, and they are dedicated soldiers.
[05:38:38.099 --> 05:38:45.860]  So, Whether you have a massive studio surrounding you, it doesn't make a difference because it's in your heart and it's in your soul.
[05:38:45.979 --> 05:38:46.880]  It's in your mind.
[05:38:47.020 --> 05:38:49.659]  And you're going to continue to push forward with this message of truth.
[05:38:49.779 --> 05:38:55.819]  And you're going to continue to have that ripple effect for all the new info warriors that are coming up.
[05:38:56.139 --> 05:38:58.400]  You know, Alex, I have a wild story to tell you.
[05:38:58.900 --> 05:39:00.080]  It's so wild, man.
[05:39:00.380 --> 05:39:01.799]  This is the craziest thing.
[05:39:02.080 --> 05:39:03.060]  I'm sitting here.
[05:39:03.139 --> 05:39:03.880]  I'm in my kitchen.
[05:39:04.919 --> 05:39:07.139]  And my son...
[05:39:07.919 --> 05:39:11.560]  He walks in and he's 11.
[05:39:12.159 --> 05:39:17.119]  And he goes, Dad, have you ever heard of Bohemian Grove?
[05:39:18.020 --> 05:39:19.500]  And I said, what?
[05:39:19.840 --> 05:39:21.500]  I said, what are you talking about?
[05:39:21.900 --> 05:39:22.840]  Bohemian Grove.
[05:39:23.139 --> 05:39:24.639]  Where did you hear about that?
[05:39:25.540 --> 05:39:29.419]  Well, one of the upper school kids was telling me about it.
[05:39:30.020 --> 05:39:31.959]  And I said, no kidding.
[05:39:32.759 --> 05:39:35.159]  I said, well, let's take a walk.
[05:39:37.189 --> 05:39:39.790]  And I took him to my bookshelf.
[05:39:40.229 --> 05:39:42.290]  And I pulled out all my books.
[05:39:43.209 --> 05:39:45.330]  And I pulled out my DVDs.
[05:39:46.110 --> 05:39:48.810]  And I showed him my pictures with you.
[05:39:49.470 --> 05:39:52.409]  And I said, son, yes.
[05:39:53.229 --> 05:39:57.009]  Alex Jones infiltrated Bohemian Grove many, many, many years ago.
[05:39:57.669 --> 05:40:00.889]  And here's your dad with that man.
[05:40:02.049 --> 05:40:03.069]  And we started talking.
[05:40:03.290 --> 05:40:05.729]  We started, you know, taking him down this rabbit hole.
[05:40:05.849 --> 05:40:09.529]  And of course, he's only 11, so I don't want to fill his head up with too much stuff.
[05:40:09.930 --> 05:40:14.529]  I mean, when I learned about this stuff when I was only 17 or 18, it was just too much for me to even handle.
[05:40:15.409 --> 05:40:20.689]  But, you know, it was wild to have my son come talk to me about it.
[05:40:20.810 --> 05:40:22.310]  And I never spoke to him about it.
[05:40:22.529 --> 05:40:30.650]  But my point to this is that even in my son's school, when an upper-class student...
[05:40:31.979 --> 05:40:33.319]  Comes and tells them about it.
[05:40:33.659 --> 05:40:34.819]  That gives me joy.
[05:40:35.099 --> 05:40:36.200]  That gives me hope.
[05:40:36.959 --> 05:40:39.220]  Because I'm 47 now, Alex.
[05:40:40.119 --> 05:40:42.740]  You and me, we were marching in the streets in that photograph.
[05:40:43.040 --> 05:40:45.400]  That was, man, I must have been like 20-something.
[05:40:45.880 --> 05:40:50.799]  I mean, that was, I believe that was even before I met Aaron Russo, if I recall.
[05:40:51.060 --> 05:40:53.180]  Yeah, I think it was before I met Aaron Russo.
[05:40:53.840 --> 05:41:04.020]  So, you know, back then, the only way that we could, I mean, the only way I learned about you It's because I was researching the Mark of the Beast one night.
[05:41:04.419 --> 05:41:05.459]  I was on the internet.
[05:41:05.599 --> 05:41:10.720]  I was on this file sharing system, and I'm researching the Mark of the Beast.
[05:41:11.919 --> 05:41:14.439]  And it said, Mark of the Beast, Alex Jones.
[05:41:14.599 --> 05:41:15.000]  I'm like, okay.
[05:41:15.159 --> 05:41:16.459]  So I started watching it.
[05:41:16.659 --> 05:41:18.360]  I started talking about a microchip.
[05:41:18.560 --> 05:41:20.180]  And then I'm like, well, who's this?
[05:41:20.259 --> 05:41:22.819]  And I see this guy, Alex Jones, talking.
[05:41:23.340 --> 05:41:24.479]  And I'm like, oh my goodness.
[05:41:25.810 --> 05:41:29.849]  Everyone else around me, whenever I talk about this stuff, would say, oh, you're crazy.
[05:41:29.849 --> 05:41:31.389]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[05:41:31.509 --> 05:41:32.770]  There's no truth to this.
[05:41:33.490 --> 05:41:35.729]  Take your medication and go back to sleep.
[05:41:36.709 --> 05:41:40.250]  Well, Alex Jones gave me hope.
[05:41:41.330 --> 05:41:45.150]  Alex Jones showed me I was not alone.
[05:41:45.650 --> 05:41:47.889]  Alex Jones showed me I wasn't crazy.
[05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:52.110]  And that's when I said, I need to find other people.
[05:41:52.560 --> 05:41:53.700]  I need to find more.
[05:41:53.979 --> 05:41:59.200]  There's more people out there, and that's when I started the Lone Lantern Society, because I needed to find other people.
[05:41:59.259 --> 05:42:00.520]  I needed to create my own support group.
[05:42:00.740 --> 05:42:05.279]  I was tired of going to support groups where they check your medication levels every freaking week.
[05:42:05.840 --> 05:42:12.700]  It's time for me to create my own support group of people who have heard of this guy, this guy down in Texas.
[05:42:13.680 --> 05:42:17.520]  So I kept searching, I kept searching, I kept searching, and I find all these...
[05:42:17.520 --> 05:42:20.560]  Someone had uploaded all these videos, all these movies.
[05:42:21.400 --> 05:42:22.319]  I mean...
[05:42:22.409 --> 05:42:26.689]  9-11, Road to Tyranny, Police State, like every single film.
[05:42:26.830 --> 05:42:28.270]  I remember downloading them all.
[05:42:29.029 --> 05:42:36.409]  And I just, I put them on a computer and I run the computer into the television and I just watched everything.
[05:42:36.909 --> 05:42:38.630]  And I said, here it is.
[05:42:39.189 --> 05:42:40.090]  This is it.
[05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:42.630]  It's, it's, it's, I'm not crazy.
[05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:55.669]  So Alex Jones, his message so many years ago put me on a path That led me to the Arcata Theater in St.
[05:42:55.830 --> 05:43:00.349]  Charles, Illinois, where I saw Aaron Russo presenting his film, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[05:43:00.509 --> 05:43:03.650]  And then that took me on a whole other level, Alex.
[05:43:04.169 --> 05:43:19.470]  When I saw in that theater and I saw on that screen the executive orders that we've all been talking about for so many years, where they could seize communications, they could seize lines of travel,
[05:43:19.470 --> 05:43:20.290]  all the things, right?
[05:43:21.130 --> 05:43:26.130]  I saw those on the screen and talk about the Federal Reserve and this wild congressman out of Texas.
[05:43:26.470 --> 05:43:29.590]  I mean, how could this congressman in Texas be saying these things?
[05:43:29.790 --> 05:43:30.790]  This guy's in government?
[05:43:30.990 --> 05:43:31.849]  What's his name?
[05:43:32.470 --> 05:43:33.209]  Ron Paul?
[05:43:34.209 --> 05:43:34.990]  Holy cow.
[05:43:35.669 --> 05:43:37.169]  And they're going to try to kill him.
[05:43:37.330 --> 05:43:38.750]  How could he even be talking like this?
[05:43:40.090 --> 05:43:42.369]  And that, you know, it just kept building.
[05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:44.110]  It just kept building after that.
[05:43:44.610 --> 05:43:50.229]  You know, and Aaron Russo, before he passed away, he said, Gary, take my organization, take my work and run with it.
[05:43:51.119 --> 05:43:55.680]  At the time, that's when Russo had, he was working and backed, he endorsed Ron Paul.
[05:43:55.900 --> 05:43:58.340]  The Ron Paul revolution, 2008, was in full swing.
[05:43:58.520 --> 05:44:09.180]  We took all the energy from that film, all the people that were state organizers who were supporting the film and distribution of the film.
[05:44:09.340 --> 05:44:13.020]  We took all that momentum and pushed it right behind into the Ron Paul revolution.
[05:44:13.279 --> 05:44:16.639]  And then we had the 2008 campaign.
[05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:21.610]  And paint the town Ron and all the things we were doing back then.
[05:44:21.750 --> 05:44:37.130]  And that's what dovetailed next into that super PAC. I'm like, hey, let's create a super PAC. You know, I'm just a grassroots activist with a bullhorn and a DVD replicator and a small ragdad group of guys that are meeting in the coffee shop, you know,
[05:44:37.250 --> 05:44:39.569]  showing Alex Jones films, right?
[05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:42.790]  What do I know about federal super PACs?
[05:44:43.279 --> 05:44:52.299]  Well, it was a crash course in, you know, it was a crash course in adhering to all the bureaucracy of the Federal Election Commission.
[05:44:53.080 --> 05:44:54.900]  And, of course, the phone call from Alex.
[05:44:56.299 --> 05:44:57.479]  You're swimming with sharks!
[05:44:57.779 --> 05:44:59.299]  You're in the Middle Atlantic, Franchie!
[05:45:00.279 --> 05:45:01.740]  I'll never forget that call.
[05:45:01.919 --> 05:45:03.580]  I love telling people that story.
[05:45:04.340 --> 05:45:08.900]  But, you know, so it just kept building and building and building.
[05:45:09.979 --> 05:45:11.700]  We had the Super PAC, 2012.
[05:45:12.950 --> 05:45:17.389]  And then suddenly, one of the supporters from the Super PAC says, because I said, I'm leaving.
[05:45:17.709 --> 05:45:22.529]  I'm done with the Super PAC. We're going to turn this into the next news network.
[05:45:22.849 --> 05:45:30.209]  Because at the end of the Super PAC, because we were already producing, we were doing primary returns, we were creating all this news content.
[05:45:30.569 --> 05:45:34.450]  I mean, we had the reality report prior to that, too, which was also foundational.
[05:45:35.240 --> 05:45:50.139]  But we said we've got to take this to the next level, and that's when we were tapped by one of the donors of the Super PAC who asked me to go and create content for him for his television station, reaching 12 million homes in South Florida, the only independent broadcast channel in South Florida.
[05:45:50.580 --> 05:45:52.880]  I mean, you could turn us on every night.
[05:45:53.000 --> 05:45:59.919]  You find my wife, you find me, you find our other anchors presenting the news in South Florida and the cable channels.
[05:46:01.919 --> 05:46:07.580]  And, you know, eventually we decided it was time to part ways, and we just kept going.
[05:46:07.860 --> 05:46:11.599]  And we were actually, at the time, we were producing content for that station.
[05:46:11.599 --> 05:46:13.520]  We were co-branding it, putting it up on YouTube.
[05:46:13.959 --> 05:46:22.979]  And then when we left, you know, I didn't have to present news in an unbiased fashion anymore.
[05:46:24.119 --> 05:46:25.580]  In a biased fashion, excuse me.
[05:46:25.639 --> 05:46:28.680]  Not biased, more, you know, just straight.
[05:46:29.049 --> 05:46:29.849]  Just straight news.
[05:46:30.229 --> 05:46:32.009]  Now the gloves are off.
[05:46:32.590 --> 05:46:34.250]  We could talk about the war games.
[05:46:34.369 --> 05:46:36.150]  We could talk about the different things that were happening.
[05:46:36.970 --> 05:46:40.049]  Go back to the initial messaging.
[05:46:40.770 --> 05:46:43.669]  Because when I was on TV, I had to present a certain way.
[05:46:44.130 --> 05:46:46.889]  I mean, everybody knows what happens when you go on television, blah, blah, blah.
[05:46:48.849 --> 05:46:54.110]  So once that was gone, the YouTube channel just exploded, Alex.
[05:46:54.409 --> 05:46:54.990]  It exploded.
[05:46:55.549 --> 05:46:56.009]  Eventually...
[05:46:56.459 --> 05:47:04.439]  Because when we started Next News Network, it was intentionally because of what we saw, what they did to Congressman Paul.
[05:47:04.900 --> 05:47:10.979]  We saw what they did with the GOP, how they treated them, and the media, and how disgusting they were, and the racist.
[05:47:11.180 --> 05:47:11.840]  He's a racist.
[05:47:11.919 --> 05:47:12.439]  He's a racist.
[05:47:12.619 --> 05:47:12.720]  Whatever.
[05:47:13.700 --> 05:47:16.220]  And then I said, I'm never going to let that happen again.
[05:47:17.200 --> 05:47:24.720]  We're going to start a channel, and we're going to start a news network, and we're going to push back against these narratives, and we're going to support the next presidential candidate.
[05:47:25.849 --> 05:47:28.830]  Well, 2016 comes around and it turned out to be Donald Trump.
[05:47:29.069 --> 05:47:30.310]  Now, at first I was skeptical.
[05:47:30.750 --> 05:47:33.810]  The field was so busy at the time.
[05:47:34.049 --> 05:47:41.549]  And I said, okay, well, you know, initially, because of course, you know, Rand Paul was just by default.
[05:47:41.909 --> 05:47:43.169]  Ron to Rand.
[05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:44.229]  Sure.
[05:47:46.250 --> 05:47:52.509]  But the more I listened to Donald Trump's message, the more it just resonated and it just took root.
[05:47:53.320 --> 05:47:58.799]  And before you know it, we were just like, okay, let's just get behind this candidate and let's just go full throttle.
[05:48:00.040 --> 05:48:03.500]  And at the time, that's when the YouTube algorithm was totally organic.
[05:48:03.500 --> 05:48:04.599]  It was wide open.
[05:48:04.799 --> 05:48:08.380]  There wasn't any manipulation of it.
[05:48:08.479 --> 05:48:11.080]  And that's when our channel exploded then too.
[05:48:11.959 --> 05:48:15.919]  70 million views in a month, in the last month of the election.
[05:48:16.319 --> 05:48:18.040]  I mean, it changed everything.
[05:48:18.990 --> 05:48:27.970]  But of course, following that, then we see the censorship, and we see Obama, we see Hillary screaming about fake news, and then I get a phone call from my producer, Brian.
[05:48:28.250 --> 05:48:32.869]  I'm sitting in a parking lot, and he says, you've got to see this.
[05:48:32.930 --> 05:48:42.029]  And he shows me this clip of Hillary, and Hillary's literally repeating all of these, all the headlines that we were just reporting about her a month ago.
[05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:46.770]  And it was sent to him by one of our viewers.
[05:48:47.799 --> 05:48:49.159]  And that's when we cut in.
[05:48:49.360 --> 05:48:52.000]  We went back to all of our videos and we cut in every headline.
[05:48:52.180 --> 05:48:55.080]  And we're like, Hillary Clinton's down in Australia complaining about us.
[05:48:55.439 --> 05:49:05.919]  But see, they, at the time, that's when YouTube decided to flip the algorithm, turn it upside down, and start elevating what they called authoritative news.
[05:49:06.020 --> 05:49:07.419]  And it's been a war ever since.
[05:49:08.419 --> 05:49:13.259]  And I'm just, you know, I give you all this backstory.
[05:49:14.000 --> 05:49:26.819]  And I want all your listeners to understand That it is the work of Alex Jones from so many years ago that brought me forward to this moment now.
[05:49:28.220 --> 05:49:29.860]  And we're still on YouTube.
[05:49:30.540 --> 05:49:33.459]  We have millions of followers on YouTube.
[05:49:34.299 --> 05:49:37.979]  And we've got videos that go viral all the time.
[05:49:39.080 --> 05:49:47.610]  Now, of course, there's been some stuff that's been going on in Texas with the The Texas Committee on State Affairs.
[05:49:48.790 --> 05:49:57.470]  And Zach Voorhees was one of the individuals who testified back in May and put a lot of pressure on Google.
[05:49:57.509 --> 05:50:11.990]  When that committee got together and the whistleblowers went under oath, they testified to the manipulation of Google, YouTube, what they do with the get-out-the-vote reminders, what they do with the algorithm.
[05:50:12.779 --> 05:50:21.139]  For example, when Zach released the documents, not a thousand documents years ago, five, somewhat five years ago, one document came out.
[05:50:22.000 --> 05:50:29.819]  And I remember seeing it, and my channel was listed in the document on how to suppress news.
[05:50:30.860 --> 05:50:34.400]  And Alex, they ranked my channel below Infowars.
[05:50:36.049 --> 05:50:38.450]  Well, I know you're proud of that, Gary, and we're proud of you, brother.
[05:50:38.970 --> 05:50:41.650]  Listen, you've got to get back on with us very, very soon.
[05:50:42.389 --> 05:50:49.169]  I have now had time to talk to lawyers, look at the transcripts, read all the articles, APS transcripts as well, of what they've done.
[05:50:49.369 --> 05:50:55.110]  No one's ever seen anything like this, just like when the last federal trustee tried to shut us down without a court order.
[05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:56.869]  This is epic.
[05:50:57.130 --> 05:50:58.349]  This is beyond insane.
[05:50:58.709 --> 05:50:59.950]  They have jumped the shark.
[05:51:01.200 --> 05:51:02.400]  And this is massive news.
[05:51:02.520 --> 05:51:03.619]  This has nothing really to do with me.
[05:51:03.700 --> 05:51:09.080]  This is about absolute, total power grab at levels never before seen.
[05:51:09.220 --> 05:51:11.380]  Gary, thank you for popping in.
[05:51:11.619 --> 05:51:15.319]  Thank you for listening to a lot of what you're saying was great while I was reading over these documents.
[05:51:15.919 --> 05:51:17.959]  And thank you so much, sir.
[05:51:18.040 --> 05:51:18.720]  We'll talk to you soon.
[05:51:20.000 --> 05:51:21.639]  Alex, I'm only here because of you.
[05:51:21.939 --> 05:51:23.419]  And we're going to continue to back you.
[05:51:23.479 --> 05:51:23.959]  We love you, man.
[05:51:24.200 --> 05:51:24.759]  Love you too, brother.
[05:51:26.080 --> 05:51:26.619]  All right.
[05:51:30.099 --> 05:51:40.279]  There's three new AP articles in the last 30 minutes, and I was reading them because I'm not supposed to read from transcripts unless they're official court transcripts, even though we have a transcript.
[05:51:40.680 --> 05:51:48.479]  But I can read from the AP. And just as Murphy's Law, I thought when these came out of the machine, I had the one I wanted, but of course it didn't print.
[05:51:48.779 --> 05:51:50.200]  So I'll get it again.
[05:51:51.279 --> 05:51:53.680]  Laurel Logan's coming up, and then I'm going to break this big news.
[05:51:55.040 --> 05:51:57.000]  So let me see what Alex Jones in.
[05:51:58.439 --> 05:51:59.380]  Go ahead and print it.
[05:52:01.540 --> 05:52:04.979]  Judge and Alex Jones bankruptcy orders hearing over info or sale.
[05:52:05.200 --> 05:52:05.939]  He's very upset.
[05:52:08.240 --> 05:52:09.279]  That's one of them.
[05:52:16.840 --> 05:52:18.919]  Yeah, so I've got the one with the transcript I need.
[05:52:19.020 --> 05:52:19.540]  That's the other one.
[05:52:21.500 --> 05:52:24.259]  So there we are.
[05:52:26.060 --> 05:52:27.299]  I'm not really tired.
[05:52:28.500 --> 05:52:34.009]  I've just been up since 5 a.m., And I'm more, like, super relaxed.
[05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:39.090]  I mean, I guess you would call that tired, but I really wouldn't call that tired.
[05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:40.650]  I'm just ultra relaxed right now.
[05:52:42.130 --> 05:52:46.189]  Because there's a lot of relief in that they actually shut it down.
[05:52:46.450 --> 05:52:50.110]  I'm not glad they did, but they keep trying constantly.
[05:52:50.110 --> 05:52:52.650]  And I tell people, and they go, oh, that's not true.
[05:52:52.990 --> 05:52:54.009]  They're under so much attack.
[05:52:54.150 --> 05:52:55.009]  And then it comes out in the news.
[05:52:55.090 --> 05:52:56.069]  They think, okay, whatever.
[05:52:57.539 --> 05:53:08.860]  And I've been through all this censorship, all these attacks, all these lies, all these fake stories, all this lawfare, all these CIA psyops, all this Justice Department propaganda, and I just know it's evil people trying to take over the country.
[05:53:09.040 --> 05:53:10.000]  Well, they already had control.
[05:53:10.000 --> 05:53:10.919]  We're taking it back.
[05:53:12.119 --> 05:53:12.819]  But now...
[05:53:14.279 --> 05:53:24.139]  Everything I said when I discovered what they started doing two days ago before this public auction, which was not an auction, which they did not make public, the judge said, I mean, I've got the quotes right here.
[05:53:24.240 --> 05:53:25.860]  He said, this is not a real auction.
[05:53:26.240 --> 05:53:28.099]  An auction is where you can bid up and stuff.
[05:53:28.259 --> 05:53:37.459]  And then it turns out that I was saying earlier, just from what Chris Murray told me over the phone, the federal trustee this morning, he was telling me everything's fine with your friend.
[05:53:38.540 --> 05:53:45.189]  He's like, well, you know, the bid was lower, but they pledged The money they're going to get from you in judgments.
[05:53:45.970 --> 05:53:47.709]  And under law, you can't do that.
[05:53:48.970 --> 05:53:53.049]  And it's all an appeal.
[05:53:53.950 --> 05:53:54.930]  It doesn't matter.
[05:53:55.130 --> 05:53:59.709]  They didn't disclose that to the bidders that I was working with.
[05:54:00.090 --> 05:54:02.810]  And the judge ordered all that and that's in the law.
[05:54:03.919 --> 05:54:13.979]  And I knew days ago when I saw CNN knowing that we had the biggest bidder, folks I'm working with, that they now admitted in court, well, Your Honor, we didn't have the money.
[05:54:15.000 --> 05:54:22.700]  And so we just came up with saying there's this money that Alice Jones owes them.
[05:54:23.500 --> 05:54:26.340]  And so they're going to pledge that money they're going to get.
[05:54:27.380 --> 05:54:28.099]  To buy it.
[05:54:29.000 --> 05:54:44.299]  That's literally like if I went in the bathroom, crossed the hall there, and got toilet paper, and went to this auction and said, I'll give you toilet paper for this car, the car dealership, they'd laugh at you.
[05:54:44.639 --> 05:54:52.060]  But they said in the bid, by the rules, in the auction, it's cash on the barrel head.
[05:54:52.159 --> 05:54:56.119]  And to prove you have it in the bank, you got to show them the bank account.
[05:54:56.220 --> 05:54:56.840]  They check it.
[05:55:02.259 --> 05:55:04.159]  And they go on to say...
[05:55:04.159 --> 05:55:09.319]  And the judge is like, excuse me?
[05:55:11.680 --> 05:55:14.639]  And this judge does not make a lot of comments, a lot of faces.
[05:55:14.979 --> 05:55:19.159]  People that know him well, that practice in his court every week, they said they've never seen him like this.
[05:55:19.680 --> 05:55:21.700]  Oh my God, these people are crazy.
[05:55:22.560 --> 05:55:24.540]  I mean, they are so nuts.
[05:55:25.439 --> 05:55:29.599]  And the reason they do this is, if this fails, which it's got to, if there's any justice...
[05:55:31.970 --> 05:55:33.090]  They won't get in any trouble.
[05:55:34.950 --> 05:55:36.029]  Well, that's not true.
[05:55:36.330 --> 05:55:38.389]  We filed counteractions on them almost a month ago.
[05:55:38.490 --> 05:55:39.529]  You've seen nothing in the news on it.
[05:55:39.729 --> 05:55:42.029]  My lawyers don't want to get into it until they finally respond.
[05:55:42.169 --> 05:55:42.689]  They're not happy.
[05:55:44.470 --> 05:55:49.909]  But these are civil rights violations, conspiracy to deprive someone's rights.
[05:55:52.090 --> 05:56:09.180]  And, man, when you got the FBI, the Justice Department, the CIA proud of the fact they've been involved, Against me with PR firms and stuff saying I did stuff I didn't do, and then you collude with the courts and you find someone guilty without a jury trial,
[05:56:09.259 --> 05:56:14.099]  then you have a show trial and order someone under penalty of jail time to come be part of your show trial?
[05:56:18.360 --> 05:56:21.180]  I mean, folks, we're talking Truman's show stuff.
[05:56:22.380 --> 05:56:30.279]  And now they think Judge Lopez, who's a federal judge, is going to, like, be part of the production.
[05:56:32.020 --> 05:56:33.000]  And he's not.
[05:56:34.159 --> 05:56:36.400]  And he believed them when the bankruptcies first started two years ago.
[05:56:36.500 --> 05:56:37.900]  They came in, he goes, he's got hundreds of millions.
[05:56:38.040 --> 05:56:38.419]  He's a criminal.
[05:56:38.560 --> 05:56:39.500]  He's going to jail.
[05:56:39.779 --> 05:56:40.619]  The Justice Department's here.
[05:56:40.720 --> 05:56:41.060]  They agree.
[05:56:41.279 --> 05:56:47.759]  We want you to appoint all these outside accounting firms and use his money and his company's money to find the hundreds of millions he stole from them.
[05:56:47.779 --> 05:56:48.700]  He made money off them.
[05:56:48.819 --> 05:56:49.560]  Oh, no, that's true.
[05:56:49.900 --> 05:56:50.779]  A, I didn't make money off them.
[05:56:50.799 --> 05:56:51.659]  B, there wasn't all this money.
[05:56:53.590 --> 05:56:54.750]  People are like, why are you so calm?
[05:56:54.810 --> 05:56:55.930]  I'm like, it's not true.
[05:56:56.009 --> 05:56:56.970]  They're going to have to set me up.
[05:56:57.810 --> 05:57:07.090]  And then when they didn't find any money, the last CRO tried to set us up.
[05:57:11.180 --> 05:57:13.759]  I mean, I'm constantly thinking, what could they set me up for?
[05:57:13.979 --> 05:57:17.139]  Long before all this stuff happened, I was like, I'm knowing the government wants to set me up.
[05:57:17.240 --> 05:57:19.220]  I mean, I'm always like, do CPAs pay extra?
[05:57:19.520 --> 05:57:20.080]  Oh, yeah.
[05:57:21.060 --> 05:57:22.419]  I mean, I'm like, Mr.
[05:57:22.700 --> 05:57:23.680]  Straight Arrow, baby.
[05:57:24.819 --> 05:57:33.599]  And when it comes to business and stuff like that, so there's a confidence to that.
[05:57:33.740 --> 05:57:37.340]  Not that the system's not corrupt and won't set you up, but it's like, hey, I haven't done anything wrong.
[05:57:37.479 --> 05:57:38.500]  They're the crooks, you know.
[05:57:39.189 --> 05:57:42.569]  Doesn't matter if they have CNN call me a crook or people like that.
[05:57:42.610 --> 05:57:43.330]  I know I'm not.
[05:57:45.810 --> 05:57:49.750]  And so I woke up to the Truman Show a long time ago.
[05:57:50.130 --> 05:57:53.270]  I didn't realize how truly Truman Show it was.
[05:57:53.430 --> 05:57:55.130]  But see, it's not every court.
[05:57:55.189 --> 05:57:56.150]  It's not every town.
[05:57:56.270 --> 05:57:57.110]  It's not every school.
[05:57:57.229 --> 05:57:58.110]  It's not every business.
[05:57:58.830 --> 05:58:03.869]  But where there are leftists, who I guess were all theater majors, that's kind of what it's like.
[05:58:04.009 --> 05:58:16.169]  They all gaslight and get together And just like when you go into a nest of them, they all go, and they all like literally angle how they're going to con you and lie to you and guilt you and get other people to think you're bad.
[05:58:16.270 --> 05:58:17.250]  And they just gang up on you.
[05:58:17.310 --> 05:58:18.029]  They're bullies.
[05:58:20.009 --> 05:58:29.590]  And the stuff I've learned about them, I mean, they created fake origin stories about me on national TV and documentaries and NPR specials.
[05:58:30.529 --> 05:58:35.229]  And you listen to it and like 95% is not even based in any reality.
[05:58:39.090 --> 05:58:42.029]  And you're just like, oh my God, these people are some...
[05:58:42.029 --> 05:58:44.970]  I mean, I didn't know there were this many people that are this whacked out.
[05:58:46.290 --> 05:58:47.490]  But they're of the devil.
[05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:55.349]  I mean, you read the Bible and you're like, oh yeah, when I was a kid, in Sunday school, I'm like, oh yeah, the wicked governments and they all scheme and they create these false realities.
[05:58:55.509 --> 05:58:56.569]  I'm like, gosh, people aren't that bad.
[05:58:56.669 --> 05:58:57.549]  You know, my parents are nice.
[05:58:58.369 --> 05:59:00.090]  I was naive because I was around nice people.
[05:59:01.990 --> 05:59:03.349]  That's exactly how they work.
[05:59:05.729 --> 05:59:06.069]  And...
[05:59:16.430 --> 05:59:18.470]  I'm not even mad at these people, actually.
[05:59:18.750 --> 05:59:22.490]  I mean, they are like freak shows.
[05:59:23.689 --> 05:59:26.090]  And they need sympathy.
[05:59:26.090 --> 05:59:27.729]  They want to find something to be victims.
[05:59:27.950 --> 05:59:30.110]  They want to accuse you of something you haven't done.
[05:59:30.270 --> 05:59:33.009]  And then they live off of it while they stalk you.
[05:59:33.889 --> 05:59:35.689]  And then they just expect to...
[05:59:38.470 --> 05:59:39.049]  Hurt you.
[05:59:39.130 --> 05:59:40.630]  And it's not even money they want.
[05:59:40.729 --> 05:59:42.549]  They want your force.
[05:59:42.669 --> 05:59:43.409]  They want your soul.
[05:59:43.549 --> 05:59:50.470]  They want your energy because they don't like you because you're smarter, better looking, better family.
[05:59:50.750 --> 05:59:51.770]  You're good.
[05:59:52.110 --> 05:59:55.009]  They don't like me because I'm a good person.
[05:59:55.880 --> 05:59:56.700]  I can be a jerk.
[05:59:56.700 --> 05:59:57.419]  I can get mad.
[05:59:57.560 --> 05:59:58.259]  I feel bad for it.
[05:59:58.380 --> 05:59:59.819]  I like being nice to people.
[05:59:59.959 --> 06:00:01.139]  I like other people doing well.
[06:00:01.439 --> 06:00:02.580]  I like freedom.
[06:00:02.860 --> 06:00:07.400]  I like, you know, I see a guy with a gorgeous wife and great car and great kids and great house.
[06:00:07.479 --> 06:00:08.139]  I go, man, that's great.
[06:00:08.259 --> 06:00:08.900]  Isn't America great?
[06:00:09.299 --> 06:00:11.020]  I don't go, damn it, I bet, you know, whatever.
[06:00:12.419 --> 06:00:19.180]  These people, the Black Rocks and people who have all the stolen money, they want the money to make you miserable because that's what they enjoy.
[06:00:20.479 --> 06:00:22.520]  And Donald Trump wants to see everybody prosperous.
[06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:27.889]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[06:00:32.830 --> 06:00:33.470]  So...
[06:00:41.799 --> 06:00:44.799]  These people all get together and they just...
[06:00:44.799 --> 06:00:47.880]  I used to read Criminology a long time.
[06:00:47.919 --> 06:00:48.560]  I don't have time to do it anymore.
[06:00:48.659 --> 06:00:50.520]  But you read, you know, this is crazy.
[06:00:50.580 --> 06:00:52.880]  And then you grow up and you live around this stuff.
[06:00:53.500 --> 06:00:54.799]  Criminals act the same over and over again.
[06:00:55.119 --> 06:00:56.319]  There's different types of them and things.
[06:00:56.400 --> 06:01:08.740]  But it's like they come up with these big elaborate schemes and these weird plans and they'll have something they've got it on and that they can attach it to somebody big enough And get the media to attach to that person.
[06:01:08.860 --> 06:01:13.180]  They can get energy out of it and actually build like a mania or a hoax out of it.
[06:01:15.459 --> 06:01:18.840]  And that's what these people are.
[06:01:19.459 --> 06:01:25.000]  And I mean, you look at them, they look like something that you'd cast for a Rob Zombie movie.
[06:01:26.549 --> 06:01:31.069]  E. Jean Carroll, Tampon Tim, Kamala Harris.
[06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:33.409]  I mean, they are revolting people.
[06:01:33.669 --> 06:01:38.650]  Your skin crawls if you have soul because you see they don't got one.
[06:01:39.409 --> 06:01:46.450]  So whereas you're revolted and recoil but kind of feel sorry for them, they see you with the light of God in your eyes.
[06:01:47.290 --> 06:01:48.790]  And man, they're like a zombie.
[06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:50.450]  Brains, brains.
[06:01:50.849 --> 06:01:51.869]  That's the archetype.
[06:01:51.950 --> 06:01:52.689]  What does a zombie want?
[06:01:52.830 --> 06:01:53.650]  What it doesn't have.
[06:01:55.790 --> 06:01:57.610]  So it's existential envy.
[06:01:57.869 --> 06:02:00.729]  It's envy of beauty.
[06:02:01.529 --> 06:02:03.090]  It's envy of strength.
[06:02:03.689 --> 06:02:05.209]  It's envy of truth.
[06:02:05.889 --> 06:02:09.610]  And it's just a collection of bottom-feeding liars.
[06:02:17.970 --> 06:02:22.790]  I mean, that's what this really comes down to.
[06:02:22.950 --> 06:02:24.630]  And you've got to come...
[06:02:25.459 --> 06:02:27.020]  Face to face with it, folks.
[06:02:27.959 --> 06:02:30.200]  And they want one thing above all, innocence.
[06:02:31.040 --> 06:02:32.720]  They want control of your children.
[06:02:32.880 --> 06:02:35.459]  And that's why at public schools and private schools, they give them grants.
[06:02:36.200 --> 06:02:39.840]  Four-year-olds, five-year-olds, six-year-olds, seven-year-olds, they're secretly creating relationships with them.
[06:02:39.900 --> 06:02:43.419]  They're grooming them to not just have sex with them, no, to cut their genitals off.
[06:02:43.900 --> 06:02:45.900]  They couldn't get it legalized to have sex with kids.
[06:02:46.040 --> 06:02:47.560]  It's still their essence and their innocence.
[06:02:48.119 --> 06:02:52.180]  So they just legalize putting them in a cult, sterilizing them, cutting their bodies up.
[06:02:54.439 --> 06:03:05.540]  I mean, imagine a cult that takes little girls' forearms and cuts them off and then creates a rotting, painful penis that's not a penis with a piece of plastic pipe in it that you pee out of.
[06:03:06.419 --> 06:03:07.639]  And they all fall off.
[06:03:09.139 --> 06:03:11.360]  A surgery where you're given a rotting member.
[06:03:11.500 --> 06:03:17.479]  Imagine if a dentist said, you're a trans tooth person.
[06:03:17.479 --> 06:03:18.659]  You don't have any teeth.
[06:03:19.099 --> 06:03:20.200]  We're going to pull them all out.
[06:03:20.299 --> 06:03:21.259]  They go, that's a psychotic.
[06:03:23.389 --> 06:03:24.569]  But they build it up.
[06:03:24.630 --> 06:03:25.229]  It's loving.
[06:03:25.229 --> 06:03:25.849]  It's liberal.
[06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.529]  They're victims.
[06:03:26.770 --> 06:03:27.590]  People are being mean to them.
[06:03:30.069 --> 06:03:31.110]  Yep, RFK Jr.
[06:03:31.409 --> 06:03:32.509]  comes out against gender-affirming care.
[06:03:32.549 --> 06:03:36.590]  He has a long time ago, but he's now set to be the Health and Human Services Head.
[06:03:36.810 --> 06:03:37.750]  Huge announcement.
[06:03:38.869 --> 06:03:45.389]  So the big consolation prize I get in all this garbage is that I see all the big victories we're having right now.
[06:03:46.750 --> 06:03:47.650]  And it is exciting.
[06:03:50.580 --> 06:03:52.479]  I read these articles when they were online.
[06:03:52.479 --> 06:03:53.779]  I need to highlight these.
[06:03:53.860 --> 06:03:58.619]  I'm going to go over them because I can't legally read you the transcript we have of the hearing.
[06:04:00.439 --> 06:04:02.200]  Yeah, I can only read an official transcript.
[06:04:02.360 --> 06:04:06.139]  But when the AP, because the courts have said they are the media.
[06:04:07.139 --> 06:04:10.360]  So I can read with you what the judge said out of here.
[06:04:11.580 --> 06:04:14.979]  Not out of here.
[06:04:15.880 --> 06:04:17.759]  Until it's been certified and stabbed.
[06:04:20.050 --> 06:04:30.069]  Like the AP. So, if he's not political or they don't have sway over him, there's no way he goes through with any of it.
[06:04:30.650 --> 06:04:37.209]  Bare minimum, they nullify the sale and have to have a real public auction, which they'll lose.
[06:04:39.150 --> 06:04:42.049]  And there'll probably be sanctions and a bunch of other stuff.
[06:04:42.610 --> 06:04:44.130]  That's the minimum.
[06:04:44.490 --> 06:04:45.750]  I mean, this was...
[06:04:46.820 --> 06:04:54.279]  A auction that didn't happen with a bid that was lower with money that wasn't real.
[06:04:59.400 --> 06:05:03.200]  And they said, we want him off the air in the court.
[06:05:06.229 --> 06:05:09.930]  So this is a big, big, big deal.
[06:05:09.930 --> 06:05:16.369]  Laura Logan, the incredible former 60 Minutes foreign top correspondent and just great patriot and so smart.
[06:05:16.569 --> 06:05:23.669]  She's joining us to talk about what's coming up with the deep state, what she makes the attack on M4. She's a fellow Texan.
[06:05:23.790 --> 06:05:26.970]  We're going to air a quick little four-minute Clip here.
[06:05:27.569 --> 06:05:29.169]  Remember, we can't stay on air without you.
[06:05:29.250 --> 06:05:31.349]  We really need your help now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[06:05:31.490 --> 06:05:32.630]  That's separate from InfoWars.
[06:05:33.569 --> 06:05:35.169]  And also drjonesangels.com.
[06:05:35.389 --> 06:05:37.529]  There's a very good chance we're back.
[06:05:37.689 --> 06:05:39.250]  You ordered a hearing next Monday or Tuesday.
[06:05:39.349 --> 06:05:40.290]  You haven't said which day yet.
[06:05:40.529 --> 06:05:44.310]  The judge is going to order it reopened until the sale now happens months from now.
[06:05:44.610 --> 06:05:47.290]  It'll be transparent, and the good guys are going to win.
[06:05:48.069 --> 06:05:53.950]  Or there's no justice in America and stuff never before seen because they think Alex Jones is the devil they're going to get away with.
[06:05:55.349 --> 06:05:58.169]  So, no, The Onion did not buy Infowars.
[06:05:59.209 --> 06:06:00.549]  They're just the name on it.
[06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:12.889]  The lawyers of the Democratic Party pledged money I owe nebulously to pay for it at some point without even guaranteeing any of it, which they can't.
[06:06:12.930 --> 06:06:13.310]  It's on appeal.
[06:06:14.189 --> 06:06:16.729]  So, can you go get a bank loan on that?
[06:06:16.909 --> 06:06:21.869]  I mean, this is like a mime of a shed somewhere printing counterfeit money, basically.
[06:06:22.770 --> 06:06:23.930]  I mean, whoo!
[06:06:24.599 --> 06:06:27.360]  They didn't even go get credit or a credit line with the bank.
[06:06:27.799 --> 06:06:29.020]  And they had to declare.
[06:06:29.220 --> 06:06:30.979]  This was cash buying.
[06:06:30.979 --> 06:06:32.659]  That's what the other people were told.
[06:06:33.360 --> 06:06:34.880]  But last minute, sorry.
[06:06:36.540 --> 06:06:38.799]  And the judge flipped out on them.
[06:06:39.779 --> 06:06:40.919]  We'll go to Laura Logan in just a moment.
[06:06:41.000 --> 06:06:41.540]  We've got her connected.
[06:06:41.959 --> 06:06:50.880]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you live from our South Austin burgeoning studios of the Alex Jones Network.
[06:06:51.240 --> 06:06:51.919]  Stay with us.
[06:06:53.330 --> 06:07:02.549]  Many of the supplements available at thealexjonesstore.com are the latest, cutting-edge, highest-rated game-changers that have been discovered through research.
[06:07:02.709 --> 06:07:03.729]  And that's wonderful.
[06:07:04.610 --> 06:07:11.270]  But many of the products there are known, tried-and-true staples like elderberry.
[06:07:11.790 --> 06:07:25.990]  It's just that ours is high quality, very strong, concentrated, and at a competitive price, especially if you get more than one bottle, then it's some of the best prices you'll find anywhere, and your purchase funds are operations against the globalists, a 360 win.

[06:07:40.240 --> 06:07:41.139]  It's antiviral.
[06:07:41.299 --> 06:07:49.159]  So now, high-quality, ultimate elderberry, scientific name, Sambuscus, available right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[06:07:49.159 --> 06:07:51.520]  It's good for your body, and it funds the Infowar.
[06:07:53.340 --> 06:08:08.419]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[06:08:08.659 --> 06:08:13.979]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[06:08:14.759 --> 06:08:17.840]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[06:08:18.340 --> 06:08:22.220]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[06:08:22.380 --> 06:08:22.880]  Who knows?
[06:08:23.380 --> 06:08:25.840]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[06:08:26.119 --> 06:08:40.479]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[06:08:40.959 --> 06:08:44.880]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[06:08:45.040 --> 06:08:57.639]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[06:08:57.959 --> 06:08:59.319]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[06:08:59.500 --> 06:09:14.060]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at theologyofthestore.com you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[06:09:14.459 --> 06:09:18.279]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[06:09:18.380 --> 06:09:21.819]  But that's going to get announced, the winner, here in just a few days.
[06:09:21.959 --> 06:09:26.020]  And regardless of whether Infoward is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[06:09:26.080 --> 06:09:29.520]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.
[06:09:29.759 --> 06:09:30.599]  So now...
[06:09:31.000 --> 06:09:38.700]  We're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the darkest hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:09:39.040 --> 06:09:44.580]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[06:09:44.619 --> 06:09:46.040]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[06:09:46.240 --> 06:09:47.200]  It's a beautiful truck.
[06:09:47.799 --> 06:09:53.119]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[06:09:53.279 --> 06:09:56.060]  And there's so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[06:09:56.060 --> 06:10:02.919]  When you're a VIP member, you get $40 a month to spend in the store for your $30 a month membership.
[06:10:02.919 --> 06:10:04.279]  You can cancel any time.

[06:10:12.799 --> 06:10:29.819]  A 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition, 6.7-liter high-output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 pound-feet per torque, 2-inch ready lift kit, 37-inch Toyo off-road tires,

[06:11:07.029 --> 06:11:23.250]  We're good to go.
[06:11:25.189 --> 06:11:28.990]  To spend in the store each month for your $30 you put down.
[06:11:29.330 --> 06:11:30.709]  Cancel any time.

[06:11:39.450 --> 06:11:41.330]  It's so exciting to see the big win with Trump.
[06:11:41.509 --> 06:11:46.970]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[06:11:47.250 --> 06:11:48.150]  God bless you all.
[06:11:48.369 --> 06:11:49.310]  Thank you all for your support.
[06:11:49.610 --> 06:11:52.290]  Check out the new truck at the Alex Jones store.com.
[06:11:58.540 --> 06:12:02.880]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[06:12:03.639 --> 06:12:07.819]  It is 4.57 Central Standard Time.
[06:12:07.819 --> 06:12:18.479]  I come to you from the backup studios here at the Alex Jones Network, alexjones.network, and on X at AJNLive.
[06:12:18.740 --> 06:12:20.479]  Be sure and follow us there.
[06:12:21.869 --> 06:12:37.509]  Award-winning investigative journalist, formerly the top foreign correspondent, international correspondent, war correspondent for 60 Minutes and more, Laura Logan, is here to talk about the big picture in America, all the incredible intel she has, what's happening with Trump, and so much more,
[06:12:37.689 --> 06:12:41.470]  all these great new appointments, some of the bad ones, but obviously front and center.
[06:12:41.689 --> 06:12:47.830]  The big breaking news I have is, and I've read the transcripts now and talked to the lawyers, they're hearing close about an hour ago, Judge Lopez said...
[06:12:48.419 --> 06:13:04.000]  The sale did not go through to The Onion, that he's having a full evidentiary hearing sometime next week, that it was not a real auction, and that they just gave it to people basically for no money and did not tell the other people that were bidding and didn't let them overbid because you couldn't overbid when it's no money,
[06:13:04.159 --> 06:13:05.759]  and then they tried to represent it.
[06:13:05.860 --> 06:13:06.959]  This is historic.
[06:13:06.979 --> 06:13:07.900]  This is insane.
[06:13:08.040 --> 06:13:09.400]  I can't even believe they did this.
[06:13:09.560 --> 06:13:10.759]  I knew something would happen.
[06:13:12.040 --> 06:13:16.720]  While she's talking, I'll show you the transcript out of AP because I'm not supposed to read a non-official transcript.
[06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:18.290]  That isn't from the court.
[06:13:18.470 --> 06:13:19.389]  That's weird court rules.
[06:13:19.509 --> 06:13:20.470]  I'm not going to violate any of that.
[06:13:20.549 --> 06:13:27.529]  But AP is the media, so they're allowed, even though I am the media, to put out quotes from the judge in that.
[06:13:28.029 --> 06:13:30.229]  So, Laura Logan, this is wild.
[06:13:30.810 --> 06:13:32.490]  The judge said this was not a real auction.
[06:13:32.569 --> 06:13:33.490]  He said there's not transparency.
[06:13:33.849 --> 06:13:36.270]  He couldn't believe what was going on.
[06:13:36.349 --> 06:13:37.750]  Elon Musk had his lawyers there.
[06:13:37.849 --> 06:13:38.729]  We didn't even know they'd be there.
[06:13:40.609 --> 06:13:49.209]  We're good to go.
[06:13:57.189 --> 06:14:01.090]  Back in late May, and people didn't even believe it, and then it came out in court.
[06:14:01.169 --> 06:14:03.150]  Yeah, we tried to close it without a court order.
[06:14:03.409 --> 06:14:06.009]  The Justice Department, U.S. trustee, a side of the case.
[06:14:06.130 --> 06:14:07.470]  Judge fired that U.S. trustee.
[06:14:07.790 --> 06:14:13.650]  I'm thinking this new U.S. trustee that came on has got some explaining to do.
[06:14:13.689 --> 06:14:14.650]  Laura Logan, thanks for being here.
[06:14:15.860 --> 06:14:18.240]  So, Alex, I first have one question for you.
[06:14:18.380 --> 06:14:22.279]  Was it the new trustee that decided to make this a secret auction?
[06:14:22.540 --> 06:14:22.819]  Yes.
[06:14:22.819 --> 06:14:23.819]  Is that how this happened?
[06:14:23.959 --> 06:14:25.779]  I mean, who was the person responsible for that?
[06:14:25.840 --> 06:14:32.540]  Yes, he decided to do it after making everybody sign up for the regular one and then canceling the day and a half before, and then it turns out it wasn't even an auction.
[06:14:34.000 --> 06:14:42.099]  So, you know, when I look at these situations, Alex, first of all, our jobs as journalists is to try to figure out what is the truth, right?
[06:14:42.619 --> 06:14:48.700]  And There's often a lot of detail regarding things that the truth can be vast.
[06:14:49.659 --> 06:14:52.240]  My job is to try to be surgical.
[06:14:52.599 --> 06:14:55.259]  What do I do and what do I mean by that?
[06:14:55.580 --> 06:15:02.729]  I have to go to the core of what is the one thing that is most revealing That tells you everything you need to know.
[06:15:02.889 --> 06:15:09.130]  Because there's a lot of detail you can throw in the air, but that doesn't really reveal what is at the heart of something.
[06:15:09.610 --> 06:15:24.110]  So, you know, having followed this and researched it and looked into it, there was a moment when that spoke to me when I understood, and I find this often with stories, there was a moment when we understood what this is all about.
[06:15:24.599 --> 06:15:27.240]  That then explains all of the other things that happened.
[06:15:27.459 --> 06:15:33.720]  And that moment for me was when the attorney stood up in the courtroom and made that speech.
[06:15:33.860 --> 06:15:36.619]  I believe you've played that clip many times on your show.
[06:15:36.819 --> 06:15:41.599]  Your audience is probably familiar with it, but it doesn't hurt, you know, to remind them and play it again.
[06:15:41.840 --> 06:15:52.479]  It's that moment when the attorney stands up and basically makes a speech that says that InfoWars and Alex Jones must be shut down.
[06:15:53.009 --> 06:15:56.830]  So that they can't harm any more people, whatever reason he gives.
[06:15:57.029 --> 06:16:00.650]  And that's the moment when they show you who they truly are.
[06:16:00.830 --> 06:16:04.049]  That's when they tell you what this case is really about.
[06:16:04.229 --> 06:16:10.970]  That's when you understand that this case is not really about all the other things that they say.
[06:16:11.310 --> 06:16:13.669]  And so what does that then become?
[06:16:13.909 --> 06:16:17.049]  It really becomes a First Amendment censorship issue.
[06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:31.709]  So even though I like you personally, you're a great guy, in fact, I think it's a testament to what an amazing person you actually are, that your crew, your team stands by you in this moment throughout all of the stuff that you've been through.
[06:16:32.029 --> 06:16:40.009]  You know, all of those people working there behind the scenes, some of whom I've had the pleasure of meeting, they're steadfast and committed, right?
[06:16:40.130 --> 06:16:41.229]  They're not going anywhere.
[06:16:41.470 --> 06:16:44.189]  You have a great group of people around you.
[06:16:44.189 --> 06:16:45.090]  And why is that?
[06:16:45.250 --> 06:16:46.470]  It's because you're a great person.
[06:16:46.610 --> 06:16:49.529]  And, you know, a lot of people might not know that because they haven't met you.
[06:16:50.150 --> 06:16:53.630]  And maybe some of them believe that because they followed you for a long time.
[06:16:53.950 --> 06:16:55.490]  I'm not saying it to flatter you.
[06:16:55.569 --> 06:16:57.509]  You didn't pay me to come on the show and say that.
[06:16:57.709 --> 06:17:00.450]  I think I'm known for not flattering people, right?
[06:17:00.610 --> 06:17:03.169]  I mean, I have a reputation for being pretty straight.
[06:17:03.409 --> 06:17:10.310]  But I just, you know, I know having been in the middle of the, in the eye of the storm, when you're being attacked from every side, I know what that's like.
[06:17:10.549 --> 06:17:13.049]  I know what it's like to have to live with lies.
[06:17:13.509 --> 06:17:17.790]  You know, things that people are saying about you that are just, you know, profoundly untrue.
[06:17:17.970 --> 06:17:20.450]  And I also know how the media works to censor.
[06:17:20.610 --> 06:17:29.709]  They don't just print false things about you and drag up some anonymous person that says they worked with you to say bad things that they don't have the courage to put their name to.
[06:17:29.869 --> 06:17:30.930]  They don't just do that.
[06:17:31.069 --> 06:17:34.389]  They also deny people a chance to get to know you as a person.
[06:17:34.869 --> 06:17:57.069]  And so having, you know, having spent some time with you and having seen you at work and having seen you amongst your team, I really do believe that it's a great testament to who you are as a person, that your team is still standing by your side and that people all over this country and quite frankly across the world don't want to see this happen to you in this way because they know that setting aside the personal part,
[06:17:57.229 --> 06:18:00.369]  this is a First Amendment censorship issue.
[06:18:00.659 --> 06:18:11.799]  That lawyer, that attorney, what he said in the courtroom, what he said about this case publicly, he revealed what this is really about, which is silencing Alex Jones, which is censorship.
[06:18:12.159 --> 06:18:15.000]  So, you know, I don't blame the Sandy Hook parents.
[06:18:15.180 --> 06:18:27.840]  You know, if it was my child that had been a victim of a mass shooting and somebody was, you know, saying that it wasn't real or that children die or whatever it was that they were saying, sure, of course, you're going to be injured.
[06:18:28.209 --> 06:18:29.509]  And you're going to be hurt.
[06:18:29.630 --> 06:18:30.889]  But I've had so many things.
[06:18:31.049 --> 06:18:41.369]  There's so many people that have been destroyed by lies in the media or disinformation in the media or misinformation or mistakes that have been made, things that people have gotten wrong.
[06:18:41.669 --> 06:18:44.009]  There's so many people that have been hurt by that.
[06:18:44.209 --> 06:18:47.869]  And that's why, you know, in spite of that, we have a First Amendment.
[06:18:48.430 --> 06:18:50.630]  And protection in this country.
[06:18:50.909 --> 06:19:13.069]  So just because you don't like it, just because you find it hurtful, I mean, if this is the standard going forward that people can sue in this way, well, what does that say about Rachel Maddow and everyone at MSNBC and at CNN and beyond when they've said over and over again that Carter Page was a Russian asset?
[06:19:13.349 --> 06:19:15.590]  They destroyed Carter Page's life.
[06:19:15.919 --> 06:19:17.840]  Does that man not have any right?
[06:19:18.099 --> 06:19:20.479]  Does that man, his feelings don't matter?
[06:19:20.740 --> 06:19:24.000]  I mean, the things that were done to him, this is a guy who served his country.
[06:19:24.200 --> 06:19:26.299]  He was a graduate of the Naval Academy.
[06:19:26.500 --> 06:19:33.880]  He worked with the CIA. He worked with the FBI. He helped U.S. law enforcement prosecute real Russian spies.
[06:19:34.500 --> 06:19:37.000]  And when it was convenient, they lied about it.
[06:19:37.119 --> 06:19:38.659]  They fed false information to the media.
[06:19:39.040 --> 06:19:40.860]  Nobody apologized to Carter Page.
[06:19:41.279 --> 06:19:54.319]  Nobody came out and apologized to the American people for all the harm that was caused by Russia collusion, by Hunter Biden pretending that Hunter Biden's laptop wasn't real, by pretending that Donald Trump was a Russian spy.
[06:19:54.479 --> 06:20:03.580]  There are people out there today There were black people that were posting videos saying that they were going to wake up after the election was won by Trump and they were going to be a slave again.
[06:20:03.799 --> 06:20:05.400]  Where did they get these ideas?
[06:20:05.680 --> 06:20:11.939]  They got those ideas from things that were said in the media that, you know, and who's going to be held accountable for that?
[06:20:12.060 --> 06:20:17.659]  Well, nobody, because we have a First Amendment in this country and those people are protected under the First Amendment.
[06:20:17.840 --> 06:20:21.400]  So why do those protections not apply to you?
[06:20:21.650 --> 06:20:27.990]  Well, you know, that explains where every single thing that you look at comes from that, right?
[06:20:28.209 --> 06:20:31.090]  Why are they having a secret auction at the last moment?
[06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:33.290]  Why are they doing things that they shouldn't be doing?
[06:20:33.430 --> 06:20:42.970]  I wonder, I hate to say this, but I wonder if that judge would have had the same strong opinion if Donald Trump had lost the election.
[06:20:43.849 --> 06:20:49.049]  Because what we saw, I said this before the election, don't vote for personalities.
[06:20:49.470 --> 06:20:55.330]  Are you voting for freedom and the First Amendment and freedom of speech and freedom of religion and freedom of thought?
[06:20:55.450 --> 06:20:57.869]  Or are you voting for censorship and for tyranny?
[06:20:58.349 --> 06:21:10.330]  Because the kind of courts, the kind of judges, the kind of attorneys that are baying for your blood, these are people who have not stood up for the First Amendment.
[06:21:10.909 --> 06:21:16.389]  And so, you know, I look at it from a First Amendment censorship point of view.
[06:21:16.590 --> 06:21:21.369]  I separate that, you know, from the personal side of it, you know, putting that to one side.
[06:21:21.470 --> 06:21:40.669]  And I think that it's just like putting journalists like Steve Baker from The Blaze, putting journalists like that in prison for January 6th for doing their jobs, but they're not putting people from The New York Times or freelancers that were working for, that sold their footage to CNN that were not fully accredited CNN staff personnel.
[06:21:40.990 --> 06:21:42.689]  They don't put them behind bars.
[06:21:42.849 --> 06:21:46.950]  But if you're Baked Alaska, the social media influencer, you get no protection.
[06:21:47.250 --> 06:21:53.250]  But if you are, you know, if you're reporting according to the narrative about January 6th, then you go to prison.
[06:21:53.610 --> 06:22:05.849]  Once you open the door for the Alex Joneses and the Steve Bakers and all of these people to go to prison, then you have really laid out an argument for censorship.
[06:22:06.229 --> 06:22:08.869]  And this is the United States of America.
[06:22:09.360 --> 06:22:10.740]  This is the land of the free.
[06:22:10.919 --> 06:22:17.159]  This is the country where we as citizens have more rights than any of this Baked Alaska that you're showing right now.
[06:22:17.360 --> 06:22:19.159]  You know, you can like him, you can not like him.
[06:22:19.220 --> 06:22:27.479]  I happened to like him because I met him and I told his story for my show, The Rest of the Story with Lara Logan, and he was nothing like what you read about online.
[06:22:27.779 --> 06:22:40.110]  What about all of those people, all of those publications that have printed stuff about people like Baked Alaska, People like yourself that are not true or that are distorted or that are manipulated or that are taken out of context.
[06:22:40.630 --> 06:22:56.869]  I mean, whatever it happens to be, if we're going to go into the business now of shutting people down because of their reporting, whether they made a mistake or whether they got something wrong, I mean, you wouldn't have any media left if that was the criteria.
[06:22:57.189 --> 06:23:06.540]  There should not be a media organization that is still in business if you're not allowed To make mistakes or get things wrong.
[06:23:07.000 --> 06:23:08.599]  And so it doesn't make any sense.
[06:23:09.180 --> 06:23:14.919]  In this case, I mean, the size of the judgment alone makes no sense, right?
[06:23:15.060 --> 06:23:20.939]  It's, what is it, 1.5 billion approximately that you're supposed to pay back, which is just ludicrous.
[06:23:21.380 --> 06:23:38.139]  And so then, if you operate from understanding that this case is about silencing you and it's about censorship and it's about making sure that Alex Jones doesn't survive, well, on the one hand, then it makes perfect sense that you're doing everything wrong with this auction and,
[06:23:38.139 --> 06:23:42.419]  you know, I mean, selling it to The Onion, which is a joke in itself, right?
[06:23:42.540 --> 06:23:47.200]  Because that's really just what they did to James O'Keefe at At Project Veritas.
[06:23:47.500 --> 06:23:50.139]  They didn't want Project Veritas to survive.
[06:23:50.400 --> 06:23:52.520]  So they infiltrated Project Veritas.
[06:23:52.659 --> 06:23:56.259]  And by the way, notice they did it not just with a bunch of Antifa people.
[06:23:56.419 --> 06:23:57.479]  They did it with conservatives.
[06:23:57.880 --> 06:24:01.580]  They did it with people on the right because they knew it wouldn't work if they did it the other way.
[06:24:01.779 --> 06:24:03.040]  So they infiltrated it.
[06:24:03.159 --> 06:24:05.860]  They convinced these, you know, frankly, I'm sorry.
[06:24:06.000 --> 06:24:13.520]  I know some of them and I like them, but He convinced them they were idiotic to believe that they were bigger than James O'Keefe because he was Project Veritas.
[06:24:13.700 --> 06:24:14.520]  He was the mission.
[06:24:14.659 --> 06:24:15.500]  He created it.
[06:24:15.680 --> 06:24:17.159]  You know, he kept them all safe.
[06:24:17.279 --> 06:24:18.099]  He kept them paid.
[06:24:18.299 --> 06:24:20.040]  He fought one lawsuit after another.
[06:24:20.180 --> 06:24:20.779]  What did they think?
[06:24:20.840 --> 06:24:22.220]  Well, we're bigger than James O'Keefe.
[06:24:22.340 --> 06:24:24.220]  The mission is bigger than James.
[06:24:24.380 --> 06:24:25.060]  No, it's not.
[06:24:25.500 --> 06:24:26.279]  No, it's not.
[06:24:26.400 --> 06:24:27.439]  He defined the mission.
[06:24:27.599 --> 06:24:28.500]  So what did he do?
[06:24:28.599 --> 06:24:32.319]  He went and formed O'Keefe Media Group, and he's doing an extraordinary job.
[06:24:32.779 --> 06:24:48.900]  And, you know, I said to James at the time, this is God's way of thinning out the ranks around you, getting rid of the traitor, so that you can build something that, you know, where you have real protection from that insider threat that brought you down, that tried to bring you down and failed.
[06:24:49.099 --> 06:24:50.619]  Well, this is the same with you, Alex.
[06:24:51.180 --> 06:24:52.459]  Nothing's going to bring you down.
[06:24:53.139 --> 06:24:56.659]  You know, Infowars doesn't exist without Alex Jones.
[06:24:57.270 --> 06:24:58.169]  It doesn't exist.
[06:24:58.529 --> 06:25:09.189]  You created this brand with your character, your integrity, your moral courage because you were willing to say things and do things and take on subjects that other people weren't.
[06:25:09.310 --> 06:25:12.830]  And as we all know, including myself, nobody bats a thousand, right?
[06:25:13.209 --> 06:25:14.409]  I mean, when you're...
[06:25:16.520 --> 06:25:17.939]  Carving out new territory.
[06:25:18.279 --> 06:25:22.159]  And you're not afraid to go out there and take a chance.
[06:25:22.479 --> 06:25:25.020]  And you're not afraid to ask the difficult questions.
[06:25:25.220 --> 06:25:28.680]  And you're not afraid to say things that other people are afraid to say.
[06:25:28.939 --> 06:25:34.099]  Well, you know, you stick your head up on the battlefield, they're going to take their shots.
[06:25:34.400 --> 06:25:37.799]  You know, and some of those bullets are going to find their mom.
[06:25:38.119 --> 06:25:39.380]  There's no way around that.
[06:25:39.560 --> 06:25:44.860]  But the true test of character is when you get...
[06:25:45.310 --> 06:25:50.189]  Kicked down into the dirt, and you get beaten up, and you get torn apart.
[06:25:50.569 --> 06:25:51.049]  I know.
[06:25:51.250 --> 06:25:54.950]  I was kicked into the dirt in Egypt, and I was literally torn apart, right?
[06:25:55.090 --> 06:25:55.849]  Inside and out.
[06:25:56.209 --> 06:25:58.209]  I didn't stay down there in the dirt.
[06:25:58.470 --> 06:26:03.369]  They had their foot on my throat, and they reached down and offered me a hand right after Benghazi.
[06:26:03.610 --> 06:26:10.669]  They offered me a hand, which was an invitation to dinner with Hillary Clinton when I was attacked over my Benghazi reporting.
[06:26:11.069 --> 06:26:13.509]  And they had me on leave at 60 minutes.
[06:26:13.610 --> 06:26:14.490]  They thought I was down.
[06:26:14.990 --> 06:26:15.930]  You know, for the count.
[06:26:16.150 --> 06:26:17.909]  And they reached down and offered me that hand.
[06:26:18.130 --> 06:26:18.849]  And you know what?
[06:26:18.889 --> 06:26:20.270]  I didn't take the hand, Alex.
[06:26:20.569 --> 06:26:22.889]  Because my soul is not for sale.
[06:26:23.229 --> 06:26:24.389]  And neither is yours.
[06:26:24.950 --> 06:26:28.209]  There are a lot of people offering you a hand right now.
[06:26:28.409 --> 06:26:32.150]  I bet you've been offered a hand a lot of times since this lawsuit began.
[06:26:32.229 --> 06:26:33.630]  And you didn't take the hand.
[06:26:33.709 --> 06:26:34.409]  How do I know?
[06:26:34.610 --> 06:26:39.029]  I know without talking to you because the evidence is in this auction.
[06:26:39.290 --> 06:26:42.009]  The evidence is in this ongoing case against you.
[06:26:42.150 --> 06:26:46.150]  If you look at the landscape out there, You can see all the people who took the hand.
[06:26:46.409 --> 06:26:48.490]  General McChrystal took the hand, didn't he?
[06:26:48.650 --> 06:26:52.729]  Because when he was down, he came back, and they don't attack him anymore.
[06:26:53.009 --> 06:27:05.049]  General Allen, when he was down, they offered him the hand, and he took it, because he came back and was appointed as a presidential envoy after they ended his Marine career and took away the NATO appointment he was facing.
[06:27:05.310 --> 06:27:06.830]  Who didn't take the hand?
[06:27:07.310 --> 06:27:10.049]  Ah, General Michael Flynn did not take the hand.
[06:27:10.380 --> 06:27:11.180]  How do you know?
[06:27:11.400 --> 06:27:15.680]  Because they're still going after Him every single day, and they don't stop.
[06:27:15.700 --> 06:27:17.200]  Because He's still a threat.
[06:27:17.400 --> 06:27:19.080]  Because He cannot be bought.
[06:27:19.340 --> 06:27:25.700]  And when you cannot be bought, and you cannot be controlled, that is what they truly fear.
[06:27:26.139 --> 06:27:31.880]  Because you and I, the only person we fear, the only thing we truly fear is God.
[06:27:32.099 --> 06:27:38.369]  Because we know we're going to stand before God one day, and it's not going to matter What hotel we stayed at?
[06:27:38.470 --> 06:27:39.630]  Did we fly first class?
[06:27:39.889 --> 06:27:42.430]  Did they write glowing things about us in the New York Times?
[06:27:42.650 --> 06:27:49.349]  Did my former colleagues who are too scared to put their name on something, do they matter?
[06:27:49.689 --> 06:27:50.529]  No, they don't matter.
[06:27:50.770 --> 06:27:52.229]  They don't matter one little bit.
[06:27:52.689 --> 06:27:57.270]  And so you, Alex Jones, you are Infowars.
[06:27:57.389 --> 06:27:59.610]  You are the reason people tune in.
[06:27:59.790 --> 06:28:01.669]  You are who people want to see.
[06:28:01.810 --> 06:28:04.389]  So the Alex Jones Network, well, that's a great thing.
[06:28:04.689 --> 06:28:05.970]  That's a great thing.
[06:28:06.319 --> 06:28:07.779]  And that is all you need.
[06:28:08.759 --> 06:28:20.779]  It's a great, you know what, it's actually a really good feeling when they take everything from you and they strip it all away and you get to look, you realize, wow, you know what you do?
[06:28:20.900 --> 06:28:21.959]  You say, thank you, God.
[06:28:22.180 --> 06:28:31.860]  When you say your prayers and you actually, you get down on your knees and you say, thank you, God for setting me free because I don't care about any of that and none of it matters.
[06:28:32.439 --> 06:28:34.319]  And I know what matters, right?
[06:28:34.619 --> 06:28:37.860]  My integrity, doing what I was born to do.
[06:28:38.040 --> 06:28:39.959]  You were born to be a voice, Alex.
[06:28:40.319 --> 06:28:43.500]  And you have fulfilled your purpose, your design.
[06:28:43.720 --> 06:28:45.040]  You do it every single day.
[06:28:45.240 --> 06:28:48.799]  And millions of people come to hear what you have to say.
[06:28:48.919 --> 06:28:51.139]  Because they know you may not be right about everything.
[06:28:51.139 --> 06:28:52.419]  I'm not right about everything.
[06:28:52.819 --> 06:28:55.599]  And they don't care because they know you're not lying to them.
[06:28:57.330 --> 06:29:01.130]  Well, Laura, I've just been here listening to you because what you're saying is so eloquent and on target.
[06:29:01.290 --> 06:29:04.509]  And just to be clear, I was never the Sandy Hook guy.
[06:29:04.630 --> 06:29:06.830]  I wasn't deplatformed for Sandy Hook six, seven years ago.
[06:29:07.630 --> 06:29:11.310]  Then when Trump, you know, they went after Trump with me, they dredged it up.
[06:29:11.430 --> 06:29:14.029]  PR firms ran all these stories saying things I never even said.
[06:29:14.729 --> 06:29:19.869]  And they just created this whole fiction like Trump saying all Mexicans are evil or something never said.
[06:29:20.090 --> 06:29:21.369]  And that just becomes your identity.
[06:29:21.490 --> 06:29:23.029]  And now the Onion people are saying...
[06:29:23.810 --> 06:29:29.669]  We're going to confuse everybody that we're him and discredit him by putting out Bigfoot and UFO stories.
[06:29:29.810 --> 06:29:32.709]  They're already joking everywhere going, Alice Jones, isn't he that onion guy?
[06:29:33.450 --> 06:29:35.490]  So they're literally trying to blur that.
[06:29:35.650 --> 06:29:36.970]  People are too wise to that.
[06:29:37.110 --> 06:29:38.389]  That's going to piss people off.
[06:29:39.310 --> 06:29:40.369]  It won't work.
[06:29:40.590 --> 06:29:42.450]  Yes, people are too wise.
[06:29:42.709 --> 06:29:44.310]  It's too late for that tactic.
[06:29:44.590 --> 06:29:54.069]  You know, in some ways, this case, ragging out over this time because you fought it and stood up for yourself, in some ways, that's going to play in your favor.
[06:29:54.409 --> 06:30:04.529]  Because if it had happened 10 years ago, look, when I was first attacked over Benghazi, when I was at 60 Minutes, nobody knew, very few people had ever heard of Media Matters for America.
[06:30:04.930 --> 06:30:07.689]  Who are literally paid character assassins.
[06:30:07.909 --> 06:30:10.549]  They go out every day and they try to destroy people.
[06:30:10.930 --> 06:30:13.430]  And these are the morons that actually...
[06:30:13.430 --> 06:30:22.590]  Can you imagine Tucker Carlson got that email recently from a New York Times reporter that wanted him to comment on something and said, we are relying on Media Matters data?
[06:30:23.229 --> 06:30:24.830]  Are you that stupid?
[06:30:25.450 --> 06:30:31.729]  Did you literally just vomit something out and call it a human being and then try to pass it off as a journalist?
[06:30:32.220 --> 06:30:49.500]  I think that's what just happened, because you are that stupid that you don't even know that you've taken the so-called data from a propaganda firm that is politically funded, whose only job is to spread lies, and then, by the way, in violation of their 5013c status,
[06:30:49.740 --> 06:31:01.000]  by which they're required to be nonpartisan, and just do character assassination and create these false narratives, And proliferate these false narratives so that people don't know what to believe.
[06:31:01.159 --> 06:31:04.080]  And the truth is, Alex, some of it does bleed in there, right?
[06:31:04.279 --> 06:31:09.680]  If you don't know all the things, you don't know that, like, I didn't know they came years after Sandy Hook, right?
[06:31:09.959 --> 06:31:11.900]  I mean, but that makes perfect sense to me.
[06:31:12.000 --> 06:31:12.459]  You know why?
[06:31:12.639 --> 06:31:14.119]  Because I know their tactics.
[06:31:14.479 --> 06:31:16.099]  And I know how they operate.
[06:31:16.259 --> 06:31:17.099]  But guess what?
[06:31:17.299 --> 06:31:21.700]  The American people now also are familiar with those tactics.
[06:31:22.150 --> 06:31:24.450]  We've all had time to see it.
[06:31:24.590 --> 06:31:33.830]  And it's actually quite interesting because right now, over and over again, they are trying to use those tactics and it's blowing up in their faces.
[06:31:34.029 --> 06:31:37.090]  Just like, here's a classic one that everyone will recognize.
[06:31:37.369 --> 06:31:38.490]  Trump is Hitler.
[06:31:39.259 --> 06:31:40.319]  Trump is a Nazi.
[06:31:40.580 --> 06:31:41.659]  Trump is a fascist.
[06:31:41.860 --> 06:31:46.419]  Sure, you'll find people that still believe that, but what happened when they tried to use it?
[06:31:46.599 --> 06:31:48.360]  It backfired, didn't it?
[06:31:48.500 --> 06:31:49.659]  It backfired heavily.
[06:31:49.840 --> 06:31:53.200]  And there was an outcry of people saying, you know what?
[06:31:53.340 --> 06:31:55.000]  It's not true, number one.
[06:31:55.360 --> 06:31:57.479]  Number two, we're sick and tired of this.
[06:31:57.659 --> 06:32:00.139]  And number three, let's take a little closer look.
[06:32:00.259 --> 06:32:01.619]  Maybe you're the real Nazis.
[06:32:01.880 --> 06:32:10.389]  Since, oh yeah, you're doing things like Funding the Nazi division of the Ukrainian military known as the Azov Battalion, right?
[06:32:10.729 --> 06:32:17.450]  And oh, here's all the pictures of the Nazis of Ukraine that you all reported on before the war started.
[06:32:17.590 --> 06:32:19.349]  Now you want us to all forget existed.
[06:32:19.630 --> 06:32:22.169]  And by the way, if I talk about it, I'm the crazy person.
[06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:31.409]  And then they're going to go on 60 Minutes and do some story about it and say, you know, and try to debunk it with complete and utter nonsense that they pass off as reporting.
[06:32:31.630 --> 06:32:32.970]  It doesn't work anymore.
[06:32:33.189 --> 06:32:36.689]  So, I mean, I know exactly the tactic that you're describing.
[06:32:36.930 --> 06:32:38.790]  They're looking, who's hurting them, right?
[06:32:39.569 --> 06:32:47.880]  All of this What it means, Alex, it's the ultimate testament to how successful you are.
[06:32:48.000 --> 06:32:53.020]  And your success is defined not by, you know, Emmys, right?
[06:32:53.099 --> 06:32:54.740]  It's not defined by the red carpet.
[06:32:54.740 --> 06:32:57.259]  It's not defined by BS, honestly.
[06:32:57.540 --> 06:33:04.130]  It's defined by something very real, which is that Millions of people want to hear what you have to say.
[06:33:04.369 --> 06:33:06.069]  They want to buy your merchandise.
[06:33:06.409 --> 06:33:09.029]  They want to donate to Infowars to support you.
[06:33:09.270 --> 06:33:09.689]  Why?
[06:33:10.110 --> 06:33:14.590]  Because they have watched you be attacked and stand there.
[06:33:14.770 --> 06:33:17.270]  You've never been on your knees.
[06:33:17.490 --> 06:33:19.790]  You've never taken a knee to any of them.
[06:33:19.970 --> 06:33:22.229]  It doesn't matter how much they come for you.
[06:33:22.389 --> 06:33:24.770]  It doesn't matter what they try to take from you.
[06:33:25.069 --> 06:33:33.750]  You have stood your ground and you have never, you have that quality that I always believe is extremely underrated and it's called consistency.
[06:33:34.150 --> 06:33:36.610]  You can't fake consistency, can you?
[06:33:36.909 --> 06:33:41.889]  You absolutely cannot fake consistency because you're either consistent or you're not.
[06:33:42.349 --> 06:33:47.529]  And that's the thing about you, Alex, that for better or worse, you are consistent.
[06:33:47.709 --> 06:33:49.869]  You always know what you're going to get with Alex Jones.
[06:33:50.009 --> 06:33:50.470]  You know why?
[06:33:50.689 --> 06:33:52.169]  Because it's who you really are.
[06:33:52.430 --> 06:33:56.509]  And that, more than anything else, is what people want.
[06:33:57.029 --> 06:34:03.189]  They know that we don't know everything about any- Oh, they know you're not perfect, Trump not perfect, you too.
[06:34:03.290 --> 06:34:04.509]  And we're not bragging about ourselves.
[06:34:04.770 --> 06:34:05.709]  The audience is that way.
[06:34:06.090 --> 06:34:08.490]  They're looking at people that are like them, just normal.
[06:34:09.049 --> 06:34:11.409]  Trump dominates world leaders.
[06:34:11.569 --> 06:34:15.750]  They get worse stuff under him, but they admit, at least we know what we're getting.
[06:34:15.889 --> 06:34:22.189]  He actually talks to us like we're people, whereas the left and the leaders we have now lie when the truth would serve them better.
[06:34:23.189 --> 06:34:25.790]  Oh, I got to tell you something classic, Alex.
[06:34:26.169 --> 06:34:35.909]  All I can say to you is I once had this very same conversation with Joe Biden before he was president and after he was vice president.
[06:34:36.549 --> 06:34:36.650]  Okay?
[06:34:37.290 --> 06:34:40.990]  Joe Biden and Jeb Bush taking turns bashing Trump.
[06:34:41.590 --> 06:34:52.430]  And when Joe Biden got to the part where he was bashing him for, oh, you know, our allies, they can't rely on him because he's so unpredictable and he doesn't keep his word.
[06:34:52.650 --> 06:34:58.630]  And I said, oh, You mean like, let me see, like the red line in Syria?
[06:34:58.889 --> 06:35:01.209]  Like didn't keep his word like that?
[06:35:01.509 --> 06:35:02.750]  Is that what you're talking about?
[06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:11.869]  Kind of like when you told the world that using chemical weapons in Syria against the people there would be your red line that no one could cross?
[06:35:12.090 --> 06:35:16.389]  And then they used chemical weapons on the people in Syria and you did nothing?
[06:35:16.900 --> 06:35:18.759]  So you didn't keep your word, right?
[06:35:18.979 --> 06:35:21.139]  You didn't keep your word to the Syrian people.
[06:35:21.319 --> 06:35:23.580]  And they were winning the war at that moment.
[06:35:23.740 --> 06:35:26.000]  But what happened when you didn't keep your word?
[06:35:26.159 --> 06:35:30.240]  The Russians flooded the Spets Nazi, their special forces, across the border.
[06:35:30.500 --> 06:35:32.720]  They built up the base at Latakia.
[06:35:32.880 --> 06:35:38.360]  And for the next few years, they just helped the Syrians massacre their own people.
[06:35:38.700 --> 06:35:41.259]  That is when the Syrian opposition lost the war.
[06:35:41.580 --> 06:35:46.450]  Hundreds of thousands of people were wounded, killed, Forced out of their homes.
[06:35:46.830 --> 06:35:49.970]  The suffering because you didn't keep your word was extraordinary.
[06:35:50.630 --> 06:35:52.830]  And nobody could believe it.
[06:35:53.229 --> 06:36:02.930]  Nobody could believe that I dared to say the truth to that man because I had had enough of listening to the nonsense, the self-serving nonsense.
[06:36:03.229 --> 06:36:06.849]  And he looked at me and he said, oh, that wasn't when the Russians came in.
[06:36:06.970 --> 06:36:10.669]  I said, with all due respect, sir, that's exactly when they came in.
[06:36:10.729 --> 06:36:11.689]  You can search it online.
[06:36:12.279 --> 06:36:17.439]  I know when they came in because I watched it and reported on it in real time.
[06:36:18.020 --> 06:36:21.360]  And he was livid, Alex.
[06:36:22.099 --> 06:36:23.619]  Absolutely livid.
[06:36:23.860 --> 06:36:24.779]  But it was the truth.
[06:36:24.959 --> 06:36:35.959]  And, you know, Valerie Jarrett was there and she came up to me afterwards and she tried to intimidate and bully me and say, you know, she said, I just want to say to you that you were extremely rude to the vice president.
[06:36:36.259 --> 06:36:44.590]  And I looked at her and I said, with all due respect, Valerie, it's Former Vice President, and I don't agree.
[06:36:45.689 --> 06:36:46.889]  And I left it there.
[06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:48.490]  These people hate me, Alec.
[06:36:48.869 --> 06:36:51.169]  Is it any wonder they write the things that they write?
[06:36:51.349 --> 06:36:52.369]  They hate you as well.
[06:36:52.490 --> 06:36:53.849]  But I'm going to tell you this.
[06:36:54.729 --> 06:37:02.409]  Nobody puts time, money, and effort into discrediting someone who doesn't matter.
[06:37:02.869 --> 06:37:14.060]  If you were not effective, if you were not telling the truth, if you were not able to reach people, They wouldn't waste a single second on taking you down.
[06:37:14.860 --> 06:37:19.680]  Unfortunately, as everybody says, when you're over the target, that's when you take the most fire.
[06:37:19.919 --> 06:37:21.000]  And that's the truth.
[06:37:21.639 --> 06:37:23.779]  Laura, thank you for spending time with us today.
[06:37:23.939 --> 06:37:24.639]  I know you've got to go.
[06:37:24.759 --> 06:37:28.400]  I'm going to get Owen Schroyer and some other folks popping in.
[06:37:28.500 --> 06:37:41.860]  But just a few minutes on Trump, the appointments, what's going on, your great intel with your sources that are second to none on what the deep state might be planning or pulling since you were on the show just a few weeks ago.
[06:37:43.880 --> 06:37:47.979]  Well, as I said on the show, right, on the one hand, there are plans in place.
[06:37:48.220 --> 06:37:53.040]  On the other hand, there are people who are working to counter it.
[06:37:53.119 --> 06:37:56.319]  So just because something is planned doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[06:37:56.639 --> 06:38:15.369]  My greatest concern when I look at the landscape now, I worry about infiltration because it's, you know, this is the big elephant in the room here that Americans are going to have to confront is not just what's happened Inside the Democratic Party,
[06:38:15.610 --> 06:38:18.470]  but what has happened inside the Republican Party?
[06:38:18.709 --> 06:38:27.009]  The America First, the MAGA movement, whatever you want to call it, these are the people that gave that resounding mandate to Donald Trump.
[06:38:27.490 --> 06:38:31.349]  And what they want to see is that agenda implemented.
[06:38:31.650 --> 06:38:35.970]  They don't want to see the establishment, the neocons, the rhinos.
[06:38:36.130 --> 06:38:39.490]  They do not want to see and hear from these people, okay?
[06:38:39.630 --> 06:38:40.549]  They really don't.
[06:38:40.729 --> 06:38:55.939]  And when you see, like, for example, Senator Richard Blumenthal, I mean, who's a complete joke in the first place, but when he comes out and says, hey, there's 10 Republicans that are not going to vote to confirm that date, Wait a minute.
[06:38:56.200 --> 06:39:01.299]  Okay, first of all, I don't believe anything that Blumenthal says, but who would he be talking about?
[06:39:02.000 --> 06:39:09.240]  Even if it was one of them, who would be those Republicans who are going to try to subvert Donald Trump's agenda?
[06:39:09.520 --> 06:39:20.619]  Who are those Republicans who are worming their way into the White House, who've wormed their way into the transition team, who are not there to implement that agenda, but they're there to undermine it?
[06:39:21.069 --> 06:39:24.590]  That is my, that's my greatest concern right now.
[06:39:24.689 --> 06:39:26.689]  And I'm watching what's happening with these appointments.
[06:39:26.950 --> 06:39:28.509]  There are some that are surprising.
[06:39:28.729 --> 06:39:30.950]  There are some that are, you know, that were expected.
[06:39:31.110 --> 06:39:33.849]  Some great ones like RFK Jr.
[06:39:34.229 --> 06:39:35.689]  That's a great appointment, right?
[06:39:35.990 --> 06:39:41.349]  And there was a lot of misinformation ahead of that where the people were saying, oh, RFK is being frozen out.
[06:39:41.569 --> 06:39:44.250]  The Trump people, Trump's not going to keep his promises, right?
[06:39:44.470 --> 06:39:46.229]  And this is propaganda.
[06:39:46.330 --> 06:39:49.060]  This is meant to tell you Trump is a liar.
[06:39:49.560 --> 06:39:51.240]  He doesn't honor his promises.
[06:39:51.439 --> 06:39:52.740]  He doesn't keep his word.
[06:39:53.319 --> 06:39:55.439]  He uses people and then he dumps them.
[06:39:55.560 --> 06:39:55.720]  No.
[06:39:56.560 --> 06:40:00.970]  There is A real reckoning that is coming here.
[06:40:01.169 --> 06:40:02.069]  When RFK Jr.
[06:40:02.349 --> 06:40:09.729]  says we are going to remake the entire Educate Health System, the entire health system, he means it.
[06:40:09.909 --> 06:40:19.590]  You only have to go through his speeches and watch him over years and understand where he's coming from to know that this is not stuff he said on the campaign trail for effect.
[06:40:19.950 --> 06:40:21.549]  This is stuff that's really going to happen.
[06:40:21.669 --> 06:40:25.650]  And I've had conversations with people who were working on this months ago, Alex.
[06:40:26.189 --> 06:40:27.189]  I mean, there is some...
[06:40:27.189 --> 06:40:37.419]  I can tell you, if there are doctors and people that are employed by the National Institutes of Health and across the government that are taking government money, And are also taking money from Big Pharma?
[06:40:37.680 --> 06:40:39.299]  Well, that's going to end.
[06:40:39.560 --> 06:40:41.680]  There's things like that that are going to end.
[06:40:41.840 --> 06:40:43.979]  You're not going to be able to make money.
[06:40:43.979 --> 06:40:46.159]  Well, Laura, Laura, Laura Logan, they know that.
[06:40:46.580 --> 06:40:51.419]  CNN's reporting vaccine maker stocks tumble after Trump picks RFK Jr.
[06:40:51.639 --> 06:40:52.299]  for health secretary.
[06:40:53.689 --> 06:40:54.290]  There you go.
[06:40:54.470 --> 06:40:55.450]  That's exactly right.
[06:40:55.750 --> 06:41:01.369]  So if you really believe that he's only going to do this with health, he's not only going to do it with health.
[06:41:01.770 --> 06:41:05.450]  I mean, the table has been set.
[06:41:05.930 --> 06:41:08.229]  Exactly how he's going to get there, we don't know.
[06:41:08.490 --> 06:41:08.869]  Okay?
[06:41:09.250 --> 06:41:11.729]  But will people try to undermine him?
[06:41:11.869 --> 06:41:12.250]  Yes.
[06:41:12.430 --> 06:41:21.349]  There are some curious choices of people that definitely have ties to the neocons and to the establishment that are already present.
[06:41:22.400 --> 06:41:27.240]  And—but I have reached the point now where I can see this is the moment to take a breath.
[06:41:27.759 --> 06:41:37.680]  I don't want to be one of those people that's just jumping in without real information, without a real understanding, because the moment you hear people say, Trump is this and Trump is that—no.
[06:41:37.740 --> 06:41:38.919]  Are you talking to the president?
[06:41:39.279 --> 06:41:40.979]  Do you know what's in his mind?
[06:41:41.549 --> 06:41:43.909]  If you don't know what's in his mind, don't pretend you do.
[06:41:44.290 --> 06:41:46.049]  Don't act as if you do know.
[06:41:46.330 --> 06:41:49.529]  Don't say this is what Trump is doing or that is what Trump is doing.
[06:41:49.689 --> 06:41:55.369]  Because unless you are in those meetings, unless you are in the room with him, you do not know what he's doing.
[06:41:55.959 --> 06:42:00.880]  Well, we know he's 100 times more hardcore and awake and doing a great job, and the deep state fears him.
[06:42:01.340 --> 06:42:04.159]  Laura Logan, everybody should follow you on X. You're about to hit a million followers.
[06:42:04.259 --> 06:42:05.299]  He needs to be 100 million on there.
[06:42:05.479 --> 06:42:10.419]  People can find your great programs, all your work, and I look forward to working with you very, very soon as a fellow Texan.
[06:42:10.500 --> 06:42:14.779]  We're so proud of the work you and your crew are doing, and so I just want to thank you for being here with us.
[06:42:15.799 --> 06:42:20.520]  Well, you have a great team, Alex, and you're a good man, and it's a pleasure to know you.
[06:42:20.720 --> 06:42:21.659]  It's a pleasure to know you.
[06:42:21.720 --> 06:42:22.220]  You're an amazing lady.
[06:42:22.279 --> 06:42:22.759]  God bless you.
[06:42:24.750 --> 06:42:25.189]  All right.
[06:42:25.529 --> 06:42:32.029]  Look, we have millions and millions of people watching on the streams on X. We are on the satellite radio and TV feed.
[06:42:32.869 --> 06:42:34.689]  A lot of the stations are switching over to that.
[06:42:35.990 --> 06:42:36.889]  That's a process.
[06:42:37.029 --> 06:42:38.990]  We're sorry for some of those that got hit by this today.
[06:42:39.810 --> 06:42:41.750]  But what an amazing person, Laura Logan.
[06:42:42.270 --> 06:42:51.130]  I wanted to get Owen Troyer, you know, who's been an Infowars for eight and a half, nine years, and has been a political prisoner to pop in remotely.
[06:42:52.430 --> 06:42:59.270]  Also, then I'm going to have Chase Geyser come in here and just recap everything, cover some news for about an hour.
[06:42:59.830 --> 06:43:03.029]  And then I'm going to let the crew, who's been up since very early this morning, go home and get some sleep.
[06:43:04.150 --> 06:43:05.409]  We're going to reconstitute.
[06:43:06.430 --> 06:43:08.369]  If Harris is not back at 8 a.m.
[06:43:08.430 --> 06:43:10.090]  tomorrow, he should be back Monday.
[06:43:10.090 --> 06:43:11.090]  But we'll see.
[06:43:11.229 --> 06:43:11.889]  We'll talk to the crew.
[06:43:12.009 --> 06:43:16.310]  We've got some planning we've got to do when this live transmission that started at 8 a.m.
[06:43:16.330 --> 06:43:17.770]  in the M4 studios down the road.
[06:43:18.529 --> 06:43:21.270]  And then they started turning the power and the internet off, so we couldn't do it there.
[06:43:21.349 --> 06:43:21.990]  We had to come here.
[06:43:22.509 --> 06:43:23.290]  This was a backup.
[06:43:23.470 --> 06:43:24.310]  We did not miss a beat.
[06:43:24.430 --> 06:43:30.509]  We had a little, some, you know, promos and things misfiring around the start, but that was just because there was a lot of confusion going on.
[06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:32.729]  And that's to be said.
[06:43:32.889 --> 06:43:34.090]  So the crew did an A-plus job.
[06:43:34.569 --> 06:43:35.369]  Just loved them.
[06:43:35.889 --> 06:43:36.750]  And Laura Logan's right.
[06:43:36.849 --> 06:43:37.590]  Couldn't do it without them.
[06:43:37.689 --> 06:43:40.450]  This has been a very stressful time for all of us, but I'm going to say something right now to everybody.
[06:43:41.849 --> 06:43:56.090]  When you see things like the URL that I'm going to put on screen, fightforalex.com, When you see that, that goes to the new Give, Send, Go that is the fun to, quote, keep Alex Jones on air for legal and for broadcast.
[06:43:57.009 --> 06:44:07.110]  We do not have the money we need to properly beat these people in court and to expand and finish the new studio that's a lot bigger than you haven't seen yet.
[06:44:07.110 --> 06:44:07.729]  You'll like it.
[06:44:08.409 --> 06:44:12.790]  And all the other things that are going on with our sponsor that's running this and owns this.
[06:44:12.909 --> 06:44:14.189]  Because if I own something, they can come get it.
[06:44:14.250 --> 06:44:14.970]  This is not mine.
[06:44:15.590 --> 06:44:16.689]  The Alex Hills Network is not mine.
[06:44:17.330 --> 06:44:18.330]  I'm just the host of it.
[06:44:19.330 --> 06:44:23.689]  There's a lot of other stuff going on behind the scenes that's unfolding right now.
[06:44:25.740 --> 06:44:27.099]  But I will tell you this.
[06:44:27.740 --> 06:44:30.680]  When I get off, I'm going to shoot a quick report.
[06:44:30.680 --> 06:44:31.919]  It's like five, ten minutes long.
[06:44:32.000 --> 06:44:36.080]  It boils it down and shows you the quotes from court today.
[06:44:38.200 --> 06:44:40.439]  You see the headline trending on the top of X everywhere.
[06:44:41.200 --> 06:44:42.279]  InfoWars sold to the onion.
[06:44:42.819 --> 06:44:47.400]  The judge said, nope, this auction was not an auction.
[06:44:48.159 --> 06:44:49.380]  It was not transparent.
[06:44:50.020 --> 06:44:52.400]  And he all but said, it's off.
[06:44:55.590 --> 06:44:58.310]  So, and then the judge was like, well, turn it back on.
[06:44:58.450 --> 06:44:59.909]  You know, bring the employees back in, basically.
[06:45:01.009 --> 06:45:01.990]  I didn't say this.
[06:45:02.069 --> 06:45:03.090]  And they're like, oh, we can't.
[06:45:03.549 --> 06:45:07.130]  They literally said they can't be trusted in the building, sir, your honor.
[06:45:10.290 --> 06:45:11.250]  And they're like, really?
[06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:12.970]  They're going to rob the place, huh?
[06:45:13.750 --> 06:45:16.610]  So, I mean, it's just, they treat us like Lex Luthor.
[06:45:17.659 --> 06:45:21.080]  And as if we don't already, we already have a studio.
[06:45:21.240 --> 06:45:22.139]  We already have a system.
[06:45:22.279 --> 06:45:22.880]  It's set up right here.
[06:45:23.299 --> 06:45:24.360]  I get on an airplane right now.
[06:45:24.419 --> 06:45:24.860]  I go to Florida.
[06:45:25.060 --> 06:45:25.259]  Boom.
[06:45:25.619 --> 06:45:26.119]  Other places.
[06:45:26.299 --> 06:45:26.400]  Boom.
[06:45:26.520 --> 06:45:27.580]  Be on the air in big studios right now.
[06:45:27.700 --> 06:45:28.819]  But my crew would be abandoned.
[06:45:29.040 --> 06:45:30.139]  And I have family here.
[06:45:30.639 --> 06:45:32.000]  I have my parents that live here.
[06:45:33.220 --> 06:45:34.560]  So, who are old.
[06:45:35.540 --> 06:45:36.540]  And my children.
[06:45:36.779 --> 06:45:37.560]  I have four children.
[06:45:38.180 --> 06:45:40.659]  And three of them are grown up now, but barely.
[06:45:42.060 --> 06:45:42.979]  And they live here.
[06:45:44.009 --> 06:45:49.610]  So, you know, two of my children still live with me, seven and 16, 20 and 22.
[06:45:50.849 --> 06:45:54.490]  Rex, Charlotte, Georgette, Veronica, three daughters and a son.
[06:45:55.450 --> 06:46:03.930]  So, 100% of the money you donate to fightforalex.com will go directly to To defeat these people.
[06:46:04.310 --> 06:46:06.529]  Now, it won't cost that much.
[06:46:07.409 --> 06:46:12.689]  It'll sure as hell cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for the hearings and the courts.
[06:46:12.909 --> 06:46:14.990]  And we're beating them when they tried to take my name a month ago.
[06:46:15.130 --> 06:46:18.069]  We beat them when they tried to close us three months ago.
[06:46:18.169 --> 06:46:19.049]  And all this crap.
[06:46:19.150 --> 06:46:22.430]  And I told the federal trustees, I said, you're going to get in a lot of trouble today.
[06:46:23.189 --> 06:46:23.970]  I told them this morning.
[06:46:24.709 --> 06:46:26.009]  I said, this is not approved.
[06:46:26.110 --> 06:46:27.150]  The judge did not say this.
[06:46:27.389 --> 06:46:29.369]  You already got slapped down trying to sell my name.
[06:46:29.369 --> 06:46:30.049]  Are you crazy?
[06:46:30.689 --> 06:46:34.369]  You just show up here and you let a lesser bid do it.
[06:46:34.450 --> 06:46:36.029]  I had no idea it was no money.
[06:46:38.310 --> 06:46:42.029]  They pledged future money from a judgment on me to buy it.
[06:46:42.110 --> 06:46:48.709]  It's like they went in a trash can and got a dirty diaper out and said that was what they bought it with.
[06:46:48.810 --> 06:46:49.849]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[06:46:51.740 --> 06:46:52.819]  This is a scandal.
[06:46:53.240 --> 06:46:56.220]  So it's gotten worse and worse and worse as the day has gone on.
[06:46:56.720 --> 06:46:59.659]  I am dumbfound, godsmacked.
[06:46:59.900 --> 06:47:01.919]  I mean, I knew they were going to pull a scam.
[06:47:02.400 --> 06:47:03.819]  I predicted it to the crew.
[06:47:03.880 --> 06:47:07.580]  I said on the show Monday, oh, now they've changed the rules.
[06:47:07.580 --> 06:47:08.560]  It's not a real auction.
[06:47:09.099 --> 06:47:09.720]  It's sealed.
[06:47:09.720 --> 06:47:10.540]  You put in one.
[06:47:10.639 --> 06:47:11.299]  The highest is it.
[06:47:11.380 --> 06:47:11.919]  That's not an auction.
[06:47:12.020 --> 06:47:12.720]  Auctions go up and up.
[06:47:12.979 --> 06:47:16.439]  And then we learned, oh, it was lower money.
[06:47:16.540 --> 06:47:18.180]  And then we learned it wasn't even money.
[06:47:19.340 --> 06:47:21.279]  And then they're all over the news saying, we're going to get him.
[06:47:21.380 --> 06:47:22.080]  We're going to discredit him.
[06:47:22.139 --> 06:47:23.580]  They'll think it's the onion and Bigfoot.
[06:47:23.680 --> 06:47:24.619]  No one will believe him anymore.
[06:47:24.799 --> 06:47:26.099]  It's all quotes right here.
[06:47:26.860 --> 06:47:28.020]  It's all over the news.
[06:47:30.419 --> 06:47:37.540]  My lawyers and even the other lawyers have never seen anything like this because the left thinks they can do.
[06:47:37.639 --> 06:47:40.380]  Have we ever seen anybody smuggle 325,000 kids and disappear them on purpose?
[06:47:40.580 --> 06:47:41.040]  They did that.
[06:47:42.559 --> 06:47:47.180]  The globalists, the Democrats, they've got control of the money, most of the courts, the banks.
[06:47:47.580 --> 06:47:51.840]  They think they can do anything, and they can't do anything.
[06:47:54.740 --> 06:48:05.119]  So, not only are they going to order, I predict, another auction, damage has been made to the real estate, which they said, we want to damage it and take it off the air.
[06:48:05.159 --> 06:48:05.819]  I have the quotes right here.
[06:48:06.459 --> 06:48:23.049]  NAP. And so maliciously going in with fake bids and a fake process to act like they did this, and they think because I'm so vilified that this is going to work, that this is going to fly.
[06:48:23.709 --> 06:48:34.630]  And I mean, if Lopez doesn't do the right thing, you better believe, baby, the litigation is on like Donkey Kong because this isn't some rigged state court where they own the judge.
[06:48:36.049 --> 06:48:37.709]  And people are wise to lawfare now.
[06:48:37.810 --> 06:48:40.509]  So this is a big, big deal.
[06:48:40.770 --> 06:48:43.549]  So, you want the Alex Jones Network one way or another to operate?
[06:48:43.549 --> 06:48:44.810]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[06:48:45.689 --> 06:48:50.369]  We get great supplements, t-shirts, the fundraiser, posters where we really get some real money in.
[06:48:50.470 --> 06:48:57.669]  That's why there's a markup for either $29 or $50 because that way it's like a donation and you get a memento that you helped us and that's why we get some real money in there.
[06:48:57.950 --> 06:49:00.689]  T-shirts we make like five, six bucks on after the sponsor gets theirs.
[06:49:01.930 --> 06:49:02.689]  You know, our cut.
[06:49:03.409 --> 06:49:04.709]  We got to sell a lot of t-shirts at that.
[06:49:05.470 --> 06:49:09.069]  When we're selling supplements for 55% off, that's what the sponsor does.
[06:49:09.209 --> 06:49:12.090]  I'm trying to tell them that's too good a deal because there's not that much markup.
[06:49:12.209 --> 06:49:14.209]  We're making like six, seven, eight bucks when we're doing that.
[06:49:15.080 --> 06:49:22.299]  But with the posters, you know, we're getting $40 or so when you buy the $50 one, or you buy the $29.95 one, we're getting like $20.
[06:49:23.000 --> 06:49:28.919]  You know, after the tube and all the packaging and its high quality, the poster's like $5, $6 to print, and you got a packaging's a couple bucks.
[06:49:30.270 --> 06:49:33.930]  The point is, if you really want to help us, go get the special edition posters.
[06:49:33.930 --> 06:49:36.590]  My favorite is the back-to-back-to-back winner.
[06:49:36.729 --> 06:49:38.770]  One right there, amazing energy gummies, only $14.
[06:49:39.130 --> 06:49:39.930]  Sleep gummies, $14.
[06:49:40.409 --> 06:49:43.029]  The ultimate CMOS, that is the ultimate superfood.
[06:49:43.869 --> 06:49:45.509]  The probiotics, highest quality.
[06:49:45.630 --> 06:49:46.650]  The gut cleanse is amazing.
[06:49:46.970 --> 06:49:49.770]  There's so many other great products there at thealexhildstore.com.
[06:49:49.849 --> 06:50:00.369]  But if you want to make a pure donation so we really get all the money, and then it's earmarked directly to the legal, that's the defense, and the offense, then go to Fight4Alex.com.
[06:50:00.990 --> 06:50:01.810]  Fight4Alex.com.
[06:50:01.889 --> 06:50:03.009]  And I thank you for keeping me in the fight.
[06:50:03.150 --> 06:50:04.909]  But I told you this is serious.
[06:50:05.650 --> 06:50:06.470]  This is hardcore.
[06:50:07.509 --> 06:50:10.209]  Owen Schroyer, host of The War Room.
[06:50:11.290 --> 06:50:15.029]  We had an emergency meeting Monday or Tuesday.
[06:50:15.810 --> 06:50:16.490]  We came over here.
[06:50:16.549 --> 06:50:17.750]  I told everybody they were going to shut us down Thursday.
[06:50:18.009 --> 06:50:18.889]  I said 8 o'clock in the morning.
[06:50:19.009 --> 06:50:19.810]  I just nailed it.
[06:50:20.560 --> 06:50:21.680]  I figured that's how it would work.
[06:50:21.740 --> 06:50:24.099]  The fake auction would let us know on Wednesday afternoon.
[06:50:24.479 --> 06:50:26.020]  And they hit in the dark.
[06:50:26.919 --> 06:50:28.860]  And that's what they did, but they didn't catch us flat-footed.
[06:50:29.200 --> 06:50:30.540]  Then they just turned everything off.
[06:50:30.740 --> 06:50:31.819]  So we had to come over here.
[06:50:32.919 --> 06:50:34.139]  And now we're here.
[06:50:34.200 --> 06:50:35.639]  And I don't know if you followed the hearing today.
[06:50:36.549 --> 06:50:38.029]  You can watch it online.
[06:50:38.490 --> 06:50:40.110]  By law, you're not supposed to record it.
[06:50:41.209 --> 06:50:46.549]  And then the transcripts are in AP. And it's just a fiasco.
[06:50:46.709 --> 06:50:47.970]  I mean, this shows their desperateness.
[06:50:48.729 --> 06:50:50.610]  I think very good chance.
[06:50:50.709 --> 06:50:53.549]  I'd say 90% chance we're back at InfoWars next Wednesday.
[06:50:54.349 --> 06:50:54.830]  Yeah.
[06:50:56.720 --> 06:50:58.360]  Because the judge is like, this is not an auction.
[06:50:58.479 --> 06:50:59.180]  This is not transparent.
[06:50:59.479 --> 06:51:01.000]  Bare minimum, he's going to do it again.
[06:51:01.319 --> 06:51:02.880]  They'll probably get sanctioned.
[06:51:03.700 --> 06:51:06.000]  They've obviously damaged the operation.
[06:51:06.340 --> 06:51:09.680]  But if it gets back on quickly, the Streisand effect will bounce back.
[06:51:10.419 --> 06:51:13.439]  They've already put the onion up in our place.
[06:51:15.279 --> 06:51:18.080]  Owen Troyer, the war room, what do you say to this?
[06:51:20.560 --> 06:51:24.900]  So you think the judge is going to bring InfoWars back live?
[06:51:24.900 --> 06:51:25.759]  Is that what you're saying?
[06:51:28.249 --> 06:51:32.889]  While it's preparing for another auction, a real one.
[06:51:33.310 --> 06:51:34.930]  That's what the smart money's on, yeah.
[06:51:36.930 --> 06:51:39.869]  So how did they, well, it's all crazy.
[06:51:39.869 --> 06:51:45.189]  This is what you deal with when you're going up against tyrants and authoritarians and communists.
[06:51:45.369 --> 06:51:52.409]  So once again, Infowars becomes the example of censorship and now the example of lawfare.
[06:51:53.009 --> 06:51:54.909]  And so, you know, the saga continues.
[06:51:55.169 --> 06:51:57.810]  It's been a wild ride for years.
[06:51:58.650 --> 06:52:00.150]  It's been a wild ride.
[06:52:00.150 --> 06:52:06.389]  And the fact that we've still been able to be on air and do great news coverage is quite a feat in and of itself.
[06:52:06.630 --> 06:52:14.610]  Most people probably couldn't deal with the amount of attacks that we're under and still actually do broadcasts that are worth listening to.
[06:52:14.830 --> 06:52:17.509]  So it's been a feat for us to do that.
[06:52:17.950 --> 06:52:21.250]  And so I guess we'll wait and see what the next...
[06:52:22.040 --> 06:52:24.659]  The next act in this saga is?
[06:52:26.979 --> 06:52:29.319]  Oh, and my battery on my headset's going out.
[06:52:29.459 --> 06:52:30.119]  Keep going for a minute.
[06:52:33.459 --> 06:52:50.169]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, when I joined Infowars more than eight years ago, I knew that it was the only place That I could go and say what I wanted to say,
[06:52:50.509 --> 06:52:57.549]  how I wanted to say it, do what I wanted to do, how I wanted to do it.
[06:52:59.069 --> 06:53:13.009]  And even though the InfoWars brand, if you will, at that time was a little different, its public perception and persona was a little different at that time than it is today.
[06:53:15.250 --> 06:53:17.849]  People thought, are you sure you want to do that?
[06:53:18.889 --> 06:53:20.650]  And I said, yeah, absolutely.
[06:53:20.889 --> 06:53:22.229]  I have no doubt.
[06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:37.189]  And watching the continued attack only makes me more sure that I joined the right team in the fight for truth and the fight for humanity and the fight for the future.
[06:53:38.369 --> 06:53:49.299]  And even though I tend to focus more on the political aspect of things these days, And really just attack the current events and the news cycle.
[06:53:50.119 --> 06:53:59.880]  I think that what attracted me to InfoWars and what attracts most people to InfoWars, I mean, the truth is it wasn't even the political stuff that got me interested in InfoWars.
[06:53:59.979 --> 06:54:03.500]  It was the health stuff way back in the day, more than 10 years ago.
[06:54:03.680 --> 06:54:12.119]  But I think that what it is, it's this deep, innate human nature.
[06:54:13.139 --> 06:54:14.779]  This will to be free.
[06:54:16.159 --> 06:54:21.779]  And this instinct that's been beaten out of us is something isn't right.
[06:54:22.720 --> 06:54:24.799]  I'm not as free as I should be.
[06:54:24.880 --> 06:54:27.240]  I'm not as prosperous as I could be.
[06:54:28.240 --> 06:54:31.060]  And you really start to feel that.
[06:54:31.340 --> 06:54:45.939]  But as you grow up and you get more embedded in the world as it is, and you get more embedded in the culture and the minutia of the day-to-day, This stuff tends to just get beaten out of you, and it tends to get into the back of your mind.
[06:54:46.200 --> 06:54:47.439]  But it's always there.
[06:54:47.680 --> 06:54:48.740]  It's always there.
[06:54:48.919 --> 06:54:59.180]  That instinct, that will to be free, and knowing that something is inherently corrupt about our civilization, about our government, about our media.
[06:55:00.139 --> 06:55:08.740]  And when you tune into Infowars, it's like those thoughts, those feelings, those emotions, that raw humanity, that raw instinct...
[06:55:10.099 --> 06:55:12.619]  It's like it brings it all back up to the top.
[06:55:13.319 --> 06:55:15.099]  It brings it all back up.
[06:55:16.360 --> 06:55:20.380]  And once you've gone through that process, it can never go back down.
[06:55:21.939 --> 06:55:37.000]  And so I think for most people, that's really what brought them and kept them at Infowars more than anything, more than the news, more than the fun times we've had, more than all the reports.
[06:55:38.080 --> 06:55:40.439]  The documentaries, that was great work.
[06:55:41.139 --> 06:55:58.759]  But I think the true core, the true gravity, is there's just an element of raw human nature, raw human instincts, the will to be free, and this kind of unknown factor of oppression that sits on us,
[06:55:58.840 --> 06:56:04.779]  that weighs us down, that nobody can really identify, nobody can really outline.
[06:56:06.139 --> 06:56:07.220]  But you know it's there.
[06:56:07.400 --> 06:56:08.500]  You can just feel it.
[06:56:09.720 --> 06:56:11.680]  And then slowly but surely you forget about it.
[06:56:11.759 --> 06:56:17.779]  And then you listen to Infowars and you listen to Alex Jones and you're reminded, hey, yeah, something isn't right here.
[06:56:18.479 --> 06:56:21.799]  Something has gone deeply wrong with the direction of humanity.
[06:56:22.000 --> 06:56:24.319]  Something has gone deeply wrong with the direction of culture.
[06:56:24.479 --> 06:56:30.159]  Something has gone deeply wrong with the direction of our government, of our media, of our health.
[06:56:31.080 --> 06:56:32.240]  And you look all around you.
[06:56:32.340 --> 06:56:32.959]  You see it all around.
[06:56:33.959 --> 06:56:44.040]  And then InfoWars is putting on the glasses and seeing the world for what it really is, to use the they live analogy.
[06:56:44.400 --> 06:57:02.819]  So I think that a bigger threat than even reporting the truth, a bigger threat than even the activism, a bigger threat than everything we've done, tomorrow's news today, next year's news today, now the massive political movement that's cruising in our wake,
[06:57:04.000 --> 06:57:23.500]  I think more than anything, the real demons, the real maniacs, the real bureaucratic class, the management class, they see that Infowars has tapped into that dormant humanity that has reawakened that human soul,
[06:57:23.680 --> 06:57:27.740]  that human spirit, that human mind, and that's the real threat.
[06:57:29.799 --> 06:57:30.959]  That's the real threat.
[06:57:32.740 --> 06:57:35.720]  Look at the power of hundreds of millions of Americans politically.
[06:57:37.020 --> 06:57:52.720]  Once you've awakened that human spirit again, once you've got humanity out of this dormant state that it's been in, and we once again try to envision and build a future for humanity, the things we were promised,
[06:57:53.159 --> 06:57:57.779]  the things we were told, you can never put that genie back in the bottle.
[06:57:58.659 --> 06:58:00.119]  And that's the real threat.
[06:58:00.770 --> 06:58:02.369]  That Infowars represented.
[06:58:02.529 --> 06:58:07.750]  That's the real threat that our guest and our audience represented.
[06:58:08.209 --> 06:58:09.909]  It's that human spirit.
[06:58:10.209 --> 06:58:11.689]  It's the human instincts.
[06:58:11.889 --> 06:58:13.250]  It's the survival instincts.
[06:58:13.709 --> 06:58:15.310]  Think about the survival instinct.
[06:58:16.189 --> 06:58:20.849]  Maybe our most innate, hardcore instinct is the survival instinct.
[06:58:21.369 --> 06:58:29.849]  And yet, even the survival instinct has really been dulled in the human spirit.
[06:58:30.540 --> 06:58:36.080]  To a point where many don't even have the will to survive in certain ways.
[06:58:36.439 --> 06:58:39.380]  Whether it comes to health decisions they make.
[06:58:40.220 --> 06:58:41.819]  Political decisions they make.
[06:58:42.619 --> 06:58:44.479]  The day-to-day decisions they make.
[06:58:46.459 --> 06:58:49.119]  But think about the power of the human instinct.
[06:58:50.819 --> 06:58:52.720]  And when you know...
[06:58:52.720 --> 06:58:54.880]  When do your survival instincts kick in?
[06:58:54.979 --> 06:58:56.259]  When you know you're under attack.
[06:58:56.939 --> 06:58:58.180]  There's nothing you can do.
[06:58:58.319 --> 06:58:58.860]  It's innate.
[06:59:01.349 --> 06:59:08.950]  It is a muscle reaction, a brain muscle reaction that there's nothing you can do about.
[06:59:09.110 --> 06:59:09.729]  It's automated.
[06:59:10.049 --> 06:59:12.950]  Somebody starts attacking you, you go into defense.
[06:59:15.490 --> 06:59:22.209]  But until you realize the attacks that you're under, until you know you're being attacked, the survival instincts don't kick in.
[06:59:22.590 --> 06:59:28.389]  So yeah, somebody comes at you with a knife or Comes at you physically, your survival instincts kick in.
[06:59:28.490 --> 06:59:29.090]  It's still there.
[06:59:29.189 --> 06:59:29.930]  It's always there.
[06:59:30.229 --> 06:59:33.549]  It's the hardest thing to get out of human, is the survival instinct.
[06:59:33.709 --> 06:59:34.729]  And probably all creatures.
[06:59:34.909 --> 06:59:35.849]  Probably all of nature.
[06:59:36.389 --> 06:59:38.509]  Whether it's a plant or an animal.
[06:59:40.950 --> 06:59:46.470]  But once you realize you're under attack, your survival instinct kicks back in.
[06:59:46.590 --> 06:59:50.529]  And that's so much of what InfoWars has done for humanity.
[06:59:50.529 --> 06:59:57.950]  That's so much of Of what the Infowars energy and brand is tapping into.
[06:59:58.090 --> 06:59:59.049]  It's that survival instinct.
[06:59:59.229 --> 07:00:00.090]  Now you realize it.
[07:00:00.189 --> 07:00:03.830]  Oh, what does make America healthy again mean?
[07:00:04.169 --> 07:00:04.909]  Oh, yeah.
[07:00:05.209 --> 07:00:09.630]  You go to the grocery store, you assume the foods that are on the shelf are all good for you.
[07:00:10.669 --> 07:00:15.409]  Hell, the FDA wouldn't let them put these foods on the shelf if it was poison.
[07:00:17.150 --> 07:00:27.229]  Oh, then you realize you're under attack with all the chemicals that The additives and the processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and the food dies.
[07:00:28.869 --> 07:00:31.029]  And then your survival instincts kick in.
[07:00:32.490 --> 07:00:33.990]  You don't want to eat it anymore.
[07:00:35.810 --> 07:00:37.150]  Oh, look at this.
[07:00:37.250 --> 07:00:39.430]  I got water that comes right out of my faucet.
[07:00:39.569 --> 07:00:41.470]  I got tap water right here on demand.
[07:00:41.630 --> 07:00:43.209]  Multiple faucets in my house.
[07:00:43.529 --> 07:00:44.229]  What a great thing.
[07:00:45.610 --> 07:00:46.729]  Just go right there.
[07:00:48.189 --> 07:00:52.130]  Then you realize, oh, wait a second, there's chemical runoff that gets in the water.
[07:00:52.389 --> 07:00:57.610]  They add a known neurotoxin to the water, fluoride.
[07:00:59.729 --> 07:01:00.729]  And then guess what?
[07:01:00.830 --> 07:01:02.150]  Your survival instincts kick in.
[07:01:03.069 --> 07:01:04.950]  You're not drinking that tap water anymore.
[07:01:05.090 --> 07:01:06.409]  You're drinking filtered water.
[07:01:06.610 --> 07:01:11.270]  You're drinking water that doesn't have all the toxicity when you drink it.
[07:01:12.810 --> 07:01:21.069]  But if you don't know about it, If you don't know that you're under attack, your survival instincts never kick in.
[07:01:21.169 --> 07:01:25.470]  And so, so much of it is just the raw survival instinct.
[07:01:25.729 --> 07:01:29.470]  So much of it is just innate human nature.
[07:01:29.669 --> 07:01:31.790]  And Owen, you've totally nailed it.
[07:01:31.889 --> 07:01:34.470]  You know, I always talk about activating your survival instinct.
[07:01:34.630 --> 07:01:35.889]  The globalists want you to hate yourself.
[07:01:36.069 --> 07:01:38.250]  So at a subconscious level, you never activate it.
[07:01:38.779 --> 07:01:42.220]  And so you just believe it's all this death you should accept.
[07:01:42.340 --> 07:01:45.939]  And the left is a death cult shaving their heads and cutting their kids' genitals off.
[07:01:45.979 --> 07:01:46.979]  And that's what we're doing.
[07:01:47.139 --> 07:01:50.060]  We're humanity's struggle for life force and a future.
[07:01:50.220 --> 07:01:54.740]  And that's what Trump symbolizes and prosperity and optimism and not being demoralized.
[07:01:54.880 --> 07:02:00.119]  So beautifully said, my friend, we are all working to get this fully fired up.
[07:02:02.189 --> 07:02:03.869]  And I know you're doing a lot of stuff as well.
[07:02:03.950 --> 07:02:04.849]  We think that's all great.
[07:02:05.529 --> 07:02:07.770]  But obviously, we're getting all this fired up.
[07:02:07.889 --> 07:02:08.270]  It's here.
[07:02:08.709 --> 07:02:10.930]  And I intend to add more hosts and expand this.
[07:02:11.110 --> 07:02:13.529]  And so there'll be a lot of stuff happening.
[07:02:13.950 --> 07:02:17.909]  And there's a lot of folks that we're waiting to see what happened to come in and really do some amazing things.
[07:02:17.990 --> 07:02:20.169]  So I look forward to working with you more, Owen.
[07:02:20.450 --> 07:02:25.330]  And people can follow you right there on your handle at X. And just God bless you, Owen.
[07:02:25.430 --> 07:02:27.310]  And thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[07:02:28.880 --> 07:02:30.779]  Well, let me just say this in closing, Alex.
[07:02:31.060 --> 07:02:33.919]  It's been an incredible ride working with you.
[07:02:34.860 --> 07:02:37.599]  And I've learned so much from you.
[07:02:38.139 --> 07:02:42.880]  I've learned the things I should do and maybe sometimes the things that I shouldn't do.
[07:02:43.459 --> 07:02:45.840]  But it's been such a great experience.
[07:02:46.040 --> 07:02:50.020]  It's been a dream in many ways, sometimes a nightmare.
[07:02:50.259 --> 07:02:52.020]  And I wouldn't trade it for the world, Alex.
[07:02:52.220 --> 07:02:53.360]  I wouldn't trade it for the world.
[07:02:54.139 --> 07:02:59.639]  And whatever happens in the future, the near future and the far future, it's all part of God's plan.
[07:03:00.380 --> 07:03:05.139]  And I'm just honored to have been part of this with you.
[07:03:05.919 --> 07:03:06.619]  Me too, brother.
[07:03:06.759 --> 07:03:07.159]  I love you.
[07:03:07.740 --> 07:03:10.799]  And wow, they really screwed the pooch on this one.
[07:03:11.099 --> 07:03:13.319]  I mean, they're all saying the onion has it.
[07:03:13.380 --> 07:03:18.459]  The judge is, I'm not going to count my chickens, but he basically said in court he's going to reverse this.
[07:03:18.540 --> 07:03:19.560]  This wasn't a real sale.
[07:03:20.099 --> 07:03:21.439]  And these people are crazy.
[07:03:21.580 --> 07:03:25.200]  And they already tried to take it over without a court order in late May.
[07:03:25.700 --> 07:03:28.319]  I mean, it's just absolutely insane.
[07:03:28.759 --> 07:03:33.720]  There's people that believe in the establishment and people that believe in God and justice.
[07:03:33.939 --> 07:03:35.439]  So, Owen, thank you so much and God bless you.
[07:03:37.040 --> 07:03:37.659]  All right, Alex.
[07:03:37.939 --> 07:03:38.459]  We'll see you soon.
[07:03:38.819 --> 07:03:39.459]  All right.
[07:03:41.500 --> 07:03:43.819]  We have millions and millions of people watching on X right now.
[07:03:44.860 --> 07:03:53.560]  And I can sit here and recap all this, but the way it works is millions and millions and millions came on and they heard earlier stuff, but they didn't hear the new stuff.
[07:03:54.340 --> 07:03:57.099]  So I have the transcript of what the court said.
[07:03:58.069 --> 07:04:01.150]  But I follow what my lawyers say and what the regulations are.
[07:04:01.470 --> 07:04:04.470]  So this is an unofficial transcript of the court hearing.
[07:04:04.549 --> 07:04:06.970]  You're not supposed to record the court hearing, but you can get a transcript of it.
[07:04:07.049 --> 07:04:10.369]  It's not been certified by the court, so I can't read to you from this.
[07:04:10.509 --> 07:04:19.990]  But I can then go find what's in here, and I can match it up to all these news articles, AP and Reuters, which I'm allowed to read their articles because somehow they're allowed to quote transcripts.
[07:04:20.709 --> 07:04:22.490]  And maybe I shouldn't listen to my lawyers.
[07:04:22.770 --> 07:04:25.169]  You know, the point is, is that I am.
[07:04:25.509 --> 07:04:29.029]  So, I'm going to go read over this again, highlight all the stuff I got.
[07:04:29.150 --> 07:04:29.830]  There's a bunch of it.
[07:04:30.169 --> 07:04:32.509]  And then I'm going to shoot a report, one final report tonight.
[07:04:32.689 --> 07:04:37.930]  But, yeah, I posted a comment on Expo an hour ago, and I said, The Onion did not buy it.
[07:04:39.709 --> 07:04:42.049]  And they're like, oh yeah, right, it's all over the news.
[07:04:43.610 --> 07:04:46.509]  And yeah, two men can have a baby and X and Y chromosomes don't exist.
[07:04:47.470 --> 07:04:52.610]  And so, and you know, Tampon Tim, you know, is not a pedo as well.
[07:04:53.450 --> 07:05:00.569]  And Kamala Harris is wonderful and smart and charismatic and Joe Biden's sharpest attack and the Easter Bunny's real and Santa Claus is real.
[07:05:01.209 --> 07:05:03.169]  So this is insane.
[07:05:04.229 --> 07:05:05.049]  This is crazy.
[07:05:06.209 --> 07:05:07.889]  If they can get us, they can get you.
[07:05:08.330 --> 07:05:10.130]  This is not just some entertainment channel.
[07:05:10.270 --> 07:05:10.950]  This isn't some whatever.
[07:05:11.130 --> 07:05:12.349]  I know people tuned in and know that.
[07:05:12.529 --> 07:05:13.549]  And they're the people you hate.
[07:05:13.869 --> 07:05:15.729]  You know, the globalists hate you.
[07:05:18.270 --> 07:05:19.630]  They can't stand me.
[07:05:19.750 --> 07:05:21.409]  They can't stand you because we won't roll over.
[07:05:21.909 --> 07:05:23.369]  We won't submit to them.
[07:05:24.409 --> 07:05:26.150]  We have a survival instinct.
[07:05:26.349 --> 07:05:28.310]  We want to thrive, actually, a thrive instinct.
[07:05:29.250 --> 07:05:30.689]  And we're not bullies.
[07:05:30.689 --> 07:05:31.369]  We're not wolves.
[07:05:31.490 --> 07:05:31.950]  We're not sheep.
[07:05:32.029 --> 07:05:32.529]  We're sheepdogs.
[07:05:33.559 --> 07:05:35.700]  And so the crew has been incredible.
[07:05:37.119 --> 07:05:38.639]  Some of them have been here since 6 a.m.
[07:05:38.720 --> 07:05:42.680]  I've been on air since 8 a.m., And I'm not even tired.
[07:05:43.299 --> 07:05:53.599]  It's just that I need to, you know, really put on a hardcore report that just nails all the points quickly because that's what people, you know, outside of this great audience need to be able to digest.
[07:05:54.959 --> 07:06:08.919]  Chase Geyser has been just kicking ass and he is going to come in here and he's going to take over for another hour and then we're going to restream all this from the Alex Jones Network today.
[07:06:11.060 --> 07:06:15.520]  Over Real Alex Jones and over the other channels.
[07:06:15.740 --> 07:06:21.459]  I also have not played the Steve Bannon thing, which is 45 minutes long, and that got lost because the feed got taken down.
[07:06:22.099 --> 07:06:25.560]  We put an archive up, but it had 3 million people watching it when it got taken down.
[07:06:25.840 --> 07:06:26.659]  3 million on it.
[07:06:27.020 --> 07:06:28.400]  And we were really nailing it.
[07:06:29.020 --> 07:06:32.180]  So Chase will come in for 20-30 minutes.
[07:06:33.110 --> 07:06:35.430]  And then that Steve Bannon's 45 minutes long.
[07:06:35.569 --> 07:06:46.869]  I want to end restreaming the Steve Bannon co-hosting with me when it got shut down, when it was all going down, how crazy that was, because that is some amazing footage and historic.
[07:06:47.029 --> 07:06:49.349]  I mean, Imperial troops entering the base in the info war.
[07:06:50.049 --> 07:06:56.610]  So Chase is going to come in here and, you know, host however long that time's out because the crew wants to make it a perfect, you know, hour or so.
[07:06:56.750 --> 07:06:58.610]  And that restreams it all fits properly.
[07:06:59.490 --> 07:07:01.810]  I guess that's some reason for the stations or something.
[07:07:04.950 --> 07:07:12.349]  You know, we had to go get sponsors, get the money, put in the servers, the satellite uplinks, because we're on radio stations, folks.
[07:07:12.950 --> 07:07:14.110]  People are like, oh, you don't need those anymore.
[07:07:14.689 --> 07:07:15.610]  They take us off here.
[07:07:15.650 --> 07:07:16.830]  We still got that, and then they stream.
[07:07:17.250 --> 07:07:20.049]  There's a reason when they deplatformed me six, seven years ago, we stayed on air.
[07:07:20.729 --> 07:07:23.270]  So we're designed to have multiple legs here.
[07:07:23.590 --> 07:07:25.669]  This is a war machine against the globalists.
[07:07:25.750 --> 07:07:26.450]  This is an operation.
[07:07:27.659 --> 07:07:30.139]  Everybody else is great getting to their houses, reaching millions of people.
[07:07:30.240 --> 07:07:30.720]  That's wonderful.
[07:07:31.560 --> 07:07:36.099]  We've been always trying to build a network and basically got a network that changed the world.
[07:07:36.099 --> 07:07:39.060]  But I want to go 24 hours a day, and I pledge you this.
[07:07:39.479 --> 07:07:45.119]  If you support us and you pray for us, you give us the word of mouth that you keep doing, we're going to be 24 hours a day soon.
[07:07:45.439 --> 07:07:51.080]  We're going to have documentaries again, and we're going to have special reports and news desk because what we're doing is too important.
[07:07:52.060 --> 07:07:55.459]  And look, I've always said I'm gonna wake a bunch of other people and I can just sit back and watch it happen.
[07:07:56.040 --> 07:07:57.279]  Yeah, it's true.
[07:07:57.400 --> 07:07:58.599]  And people get what's going on now.
[07:07:58.720 --> 07:08:06.619]  So what I used to do is pretty much rare, certainly non-existent at the level I was doing it, other than me and our operation.
[07:08:07.880 --> 07:08:09.240]  But we've still got work to do.
[07:08:09.459 --> 07:08:11.959]  So I've just, I mean, this is a fight.
[07:08:12.400 --> 07:08:13.939]  And I'm fighting for my life.
[07:08:14.259 --> 07:08:15.319]  I'm fighting for your life.
[07:08:15.810 --> 07:08:17.650]  And so I need your support at thealexinstore.com.
[07:08:17.729 --> 07:08:18.389]  Amazing products.
[07:08:18.610 --> 07:08:20.290]  I need you to go to fightforalex.com.
[07:08:20.409 --> 07:08:23.689]  Make a straight donation to the legal fund and the emergency broadcast system.
[07:08:23.790 --> 07:08:24.669]  You see, we need that.
[07:08:25.290 --> 07:08:26.409]  I told you this was coming.
[07:08:26.549 --> 07:08:27.509]  We've held it off for years.
[07:08:27.970 --> 07:08:29.250]  And it just blew up their face.
[07:08:29.349 --> 07:08:32.930]  As long as we stay in the fight, data is going to be disastrous for the power structure.
[07:08:33.049 --> 07:08:33.709]  And they'll come back again.
[07:08:33.810 --> 07:08:34.189]  It's what they do.
[07:08:34.650 --> 07:08:39.590]  But it's like in Monty Python with a knight that goes...
[07:08:40.550 --> 07:08:42.689]  And, you know, he used to be a flesh wound.
[07:08:43.270 --> 07:08:46.450]  And, I mean, they're down basically like the knight hopping around with no arms or legs.
[07:08:46.529 --> 07:08:47.810]  I don't mean that literal violence or anything.
[07:08:47.909 --> 07:08:50.409]  It's an analogy of, like, a flesh wound.
[07:08:50.409 --> 07:08:51.529]  I've cut your arms and legs off.
[07:08:52.840 --> 07:08:53.740]  So we get stronger.
[07:08:53.860 --> 07:08:54.400]  They get weaker.
[07:08:54.540 --> 07:09:00.540]  It's annoying to keep beating them again and beating them again and beating them again and beating them again and beating them again.
[07:09:00.540 --> 07:09:02.439]  But we're getting traction.
[07:09:02.680 --> 07:09:03.599]  We're getting Trump in.
[07:09:03.740 --> 07:09:06.159]  And we know it's going to be a lot worse if we don't fight back.
[07:09:06.360 --> 07:09:17.340]  So you're fighting for your very future and your very survival when you share the live links at Real Alex Jones and follow us there and at AJN for the Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X right up there in the top corner.
[07:09:17.939 --> 07:09:20.020]  And when you tell others, hey, man, this is the rebellion.
[07:09:20.139 --> 07:09:21.500]  This is the hardcore stuff they don't want you to have.
[07:09:22.569 --> 07:09:23.669]  That's what all this is about.
[07:09:23.909 --> 07:09:27.029]  So I know you know it, but really let it burn in and get urgent.
[07:09:27.470 --> 07:09:28.990]  Because we're in victory right now.
[07:09:29.110 --> 07:09:29.810]  We're turning the tide.
[07:09:29.970 --> 07:09:30.389]  We've turned it.
[07:09:30.450 --> 07:09:31.090]  We have the initiative.
[07:09:31.610 --> 07:09:33.709]  But I need you to go make a donation now.
[07:09:34.229 --> 07:09:35.770]  You've watched a million shows, never done that.
[07:09:35.849 --> 07:09:36.630]  Well, this is different.
[07:09:37.689 --> 07:09:42.590]  And see how interesting it is when you do make a donation, you actually physically enter the zone of the arena.
[07:09:42.869 --> 07:09:44.130]  Or go get a great supplement.
[07:09:44.270 --> 07:09:44.950]  Get a great t-shirt.
[07:09:45.029 --> 07:09:46.810]  My God, we've got the best selection out there anywhere.
[07:09:47.209 --> 07:09:48.729]  I mean, really, we really do now.
[07:09:49.909 --> 07:09:55.509]  I say about the Infowars shirts, because I design almost all of them, we got okay shirts, some are pretty good, but I design them, there's other better places.
[07:09:55.750 --> 07:09:57.270]  Well, we got the better place now.
[07:09:57.630 --> 07:09:59.630]  There isn't anybody that's got a selection that's good.
[07:10:01.049 --> 07:10:05.049]  I've seen some places that, you know, some shirts I would say are better, they're like, whoa, that's incredible.
[07:10:06.639 --> 07:10:09.020]  But just overall, it is badass.
[07:10:09.319 --> 07:10:10.919]  And if you really want to support us, get the collector's item.
[07:10:12.299 --> 07:10:17.659]  Posters, limited edition, and those have a big markup because it's a memento that you really stood with us.
[07:10:17.779 --> 07:10:23.180]  Whether Infowars comes back or whether this network goes on regardless, because we're going to the Alex Jones Network.
[07:10:23.319 --> 07:10:24.500]  That's been planned for a long time.
[07:10:25.459 --> 07:10:30.500]  So it is like we just developed with folks something over here, you know, because we were being shut down.
[07:10:30.500 --> 07:10:31.580]  I was always wanting to do that.
[07:10:31.959 --> 07:10:34.099]  And so we've got a stretch here.
[07:10:35.959 --> 07:10:40.619]  We're here at the bridge, but then we've got the backers coming in once they just want to get into clear stuff.
[07:10:40.720 --> 07:10:41.740]  They don't worry about being attacked.
[07:10:42.299 --> 07:10:43.759]  I was actually holding them off.
[07:10:44.099 --> 07:10:45.740]  Because, I mean, I'll be bottom line with you.
[07:10:46.360 --> 07:10:48.700]  I told one of the major groups wanting to come in.
[07:10:48.759 --> 07:10:50.939]  I said, listen, no amount of your money is going to be taken.
[07:10:51.860 --> 07:10:55.040]  And I said, folks I'm working with are great.
[07:10:55.119 --> 07:10:56.080]  We're going to be in business regardless.
[07:10:56.599 --> 07:10:57.500]  Fight the new old order.
[07:10:58.099 --> 07:11:01.540]  We're putting in a fair bid, and whatever we put will be topped.
[07:11:02.520 --> 07:11:03.560]  And they did that.
[07:11:03.639 --> 07:11:05.200]  They said, no money, you get it.
[07:11:06.979 --> 07:11:07.919]  That's what's breaking now.
[07:11:08.720 --> 07:11:10.319]  I was told, oh, their bid was lower.
[07:11:11.459 --> 07:11:13.080]  But the U.S. trustee, that's just nothing.
[07:11:13.819 --> 07:11:14.259]  Nothing.
[07:11:15.560 --> 07:11:16.000]  Nothing.
[07:11:17.639 --> 07:11:18.080]  Nothing.
[07:11:19.080 --> 07:11:19.520]  Nothing.
[07:11:21.240 --> 07:11:22.580]  The judge said, well, what was the bid?
[07:11:22.720 --> 07:11:25.060]  I can't tell you, the trustee said.
[07:11:25.439 --> 07:11:30.759]  The judge was like, I'm really worried about transparency here.
[07:11:30.840 --> 07:11:32.380]  You don't know what you got?
[07:11:33.139 --> 07:11:35.880]  And I mean, are people hearing what I just said?
[07:11:38.259 --> 07:11:39.919]  I mean, AP hates my guts.
[07:11:40.040 --> 07:11:43.099]  And they're like, the judge said, well, this isn't a real auction.
[07:11:44.119 --> 07:11:46.180]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[07:11:48.259 --> 07:11:51.299]  So, if you just back us, we're going to win.
[07:11:52.739 --> 07:11:55.580]  Alright, I'm going to shoot a special report with this all boiled down.
[07:11:56.119 --> 07:11:57.180]  So you can share that.
[07:11:57.360 --> 07:12:00.319]  Because, you know, you're like, we're going to share an 8-hour, 10-hour show.
[07:12:00.819 --> 07:12:02.279]  People are going to be like, what the hell is this?
[07:12:02.599 --> 07:12:04.099]  And people come in, they come out.
[07:12:05.459 --> 07:12:07.259]  Everybody, you're crowdsourced.
[07:12:07.340 --> 07:12:07.720]  You're the best.
[07:12:08.180 --> 07:12:10.819]  Everybody, you know what's most important that's been said here today.
[07:12:11.959 --> 07:12:13.099]  Chase is going to knock it out of the park.
[07:12:13.259 --> 07:12:14.419]  Take whatever you think is most important.
[07:12:14.540 --> 07:12:15.979]  That Laura Logan speech was amazing.
[07:12:16.840 --> 07:12:18.080]  Roger said powerful stuff.
[07:12:19.279 --> 07:12:20.540]  Owen said incredible stuff.
[07:12:20.619 --> 07:12:21.880]  That was all really truthful.
[07:12:22.139 --> 07:12:22.819]  That's real.
[07:12:22.959 --> 07:12:23.819]  That's not teleprompter.
[07:12:24.900 --> 07:12:25.659]  Cut it up.
[07:12:25.799 --> 07:12:26.099]  Share it.
[07:12:26.200 --> 07:12:26.919]  It belongs to you.
[07:12:27.139 --> 07:12:28.700]  The Alex Shows Network belongs to you.
[07:12:29.380 --> 07:12:30.680]  All the content's free to air.
[07:12:30.819 --> 07:12:31.479]  It belongs to you.
[07:12:31.580 --> 07:12:32.159]  It's open source.
[07:12:34.080 --> 07:12:35.020]  They're so screwed.
[07:12:35.099 --> 07:12:39.919]  Do they even somehow ever get him forward and try to start enforcing that they own stuff and own our shows?
[07:12:40.000 --> 07:12:40.740]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[07:12:43.599 --> 07:12:45.080]  So God's hand is on us.
[07:12:45.279 --> 07:12:46.319]  Thank you for your prayers.
[07:12:48.229 --> 07:12:49.909]  Now, decide to get in the arena or not.
[07:12:49.990 --> 07:12:51.709]  Decide to fight back for our future collectively or not.
[07:12:51.770 --> 07:12:52.470]  We can only do this together.
[07:12:52.790 --> 07:12:55.310]  At fightwithalex.com or fightforalex.com.
[07:12:55.430 --> 07:12:55.790]  Put it on screen.
[07:12:56.090 --> 07:12:56.930]  Fight foralex.com.
[07:12:57.950 --> 07:12:59.009]  Fight foralex.com.
[07:12:59.229 --> 07:13:01.689]  Or seriously, decide to keep being a spectator.
[07:13:02.669 --> 07:13:09.250]  Because Trump only overrode the fraud and all this because a bunch of people that were supporters decided to actually do something and actually really be a supporter.
[07:13:10.250 --> 07:13:10.810]  All right.
[07:13:11.290 --> 07:13:14.409]  We'll have a short break and then we'll be back with Chase Geyser and then...
[07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:18.729]  The Steve Bannon interview from this morning when it was all going down.
[07:13:18.830 --> 07:13:19.130]  Here it is.
[07:13:23.590 --> 07:13:29.430]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[07:13:29.709 --> 07:13:34.229]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intervention.
[07:13:36.049 --> 07:13:41.130]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[07:13:41.229 --> 07:13:44.389]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[07:13:44.529 --> 07:13:47.009]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[07:13:47.270 --> 07:13:49.990]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[07:13:50.229 --> 07:13:52.950]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good.
[07:13:53.069 --> 07:13:53.709]  It's crazy.
[07:13:54.209 --> 07:14:01.130]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the New World Order and BlackRock.
[07:14:01.369 --> 07:14:04.610]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge!
[07:14:04.990 --> 07:14:06.209]  We're king of the country, man!
[07:14:09.740 --> 07:14:13.500]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[07:14:14.419 --> 07:14:17.659]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[07:14:17.900 --> 07:14:24.380]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[07:14:24.680 --> 07:14:28.279]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[07:14:28.520 --> 07:14:32.639]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[07:14:32.779 --> 07:14:37.080]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[07:14:41.010 --> 07:14:44.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next few minutes.
[07:14:46.330 --> 07:14:47.909]  What an honor and a pleasure it is.
[07:14:48.029 --> 07:14:55.650]  What an honor and a pleasure it is to be here right now broadcasting from the Alex Jones Network without a hiccup.
[07:14:55.750 --> 07:14:57.669]  And I just got to say kudos to the crew today.
[07:14:58.130 --> 07:15:04.090]  We found out at 735 this morning that Infowars was going to be shut down in an ambush attack.
[07:15:07.459 --> 07:15:17.759]  And we started the Alex Jones Show on time to all the same radio stations, to all the same TV stations, on all the major streaming platforms at 11.
[07:15:18.680 --> 07:15:22.000]  Three hours and 25 minutes after we got the news that everything was going to shut down.
[07:15:22.159 --> 07:15:28.979]  The crew has been absolutely outstanding and amazing, and the planning that we've done over the course of the last several weeks has been particularly intense.
[07:15:28.979 --> 07:15:30.619]  We haven't been talking about it abundantly.
[07:15:31.700 --> 07:15:33.020]  But we prepared for the worst.
[07:15:33.220 --> 07:15:36.400]  We knew that these people were going to hold no punches.
[07:15:36.659 --> 07:15:40.380]  We knew that they were going to do everything they could to shut down InfoWars.
[07:15:40.520 --> 07:15:44.360]  And so we suspected that this might be the outcome and we prepared for it.
[07:15:45.060 --> 07:15:46.479]  And that's exactly what happened.
[07:15:46.659 --> 07:15:48.340]  They weaponized the legal system.
[07:15:48.659 --> 07:15:51.099]  They shut down InfoWars prematurely.
[07:15:51.240 --> 07:15:53.279]  I listened to 40 minutes of Judge Lopez today.
[07:15:53.400 --> 07:16:00.200]  He seemed very disappointed to say the least in the way that this hijacking of InfoWars happened this morning by the deep state.
[07:16:03.930 --> 07:16:06.470]  We knew it was going to happen, so they didn't get us by surprise.
[07:16:07.750 --> 07:16:10.790]  I mean, of course they would try to shut down InfoWars in an ambush.
[07:16:10.990 --> 07:16:12.669]  Of course they would weaponize the legal system.
[07:16:12.709 --> 07:16:20.090]  That's what they've been doing for the past several years to patriots, whether it's Donald Trump or Owen Schroer or others in this network and Alex Jones and his family and his crew.
[07:16:20.270 --> 07:16:21.529]  That's exactly what they've been doing.
[07:16:21.669 --> 07:16:23.909]  It's been their game plan since at least 2016.
[07:16:23.970 --> 07:16:29.930]  It's the whole purpose of Soros funding district attorneys and attorney generals' campaigns all over the country.
[07:16:31.889 --> 07:16:43.610]  It was so that the Department of Justice, the judicial branch, could be weaponized both against the executive and the legislative in its total denial of all the principles of checks and balances in this country because they don't care about the principles of this country.
[07:16:43.750 --> 07:16:45.250]  They don't care about the principles of free speech.
[07:16:45.310 --> 07:16:54.930]  In fact, they even openly admit that they hate free speech with the likes of John Kerry coming out and saying that it's really gotten in the way, that damn free speech right that Americans have.
[07:16:54.970 --> 07:16:58.290]  We really need to consider altering the Constitution or amending the Constitution.
[07:17:00.489 --> 07:17:06.709]  We're good to go.
[07:17:06.830 --> 07:17:13.490]  We're good to go.
[07:17:15.860 --> 07:17:20.720]  They hate the fact that not only did Donald Trump win the electoral college, but he also won the popular vote.
[07:17:20.819 --> 07:17:23.540]  And he didn't just win it by a slim margin, he won it in a landslide.
[07:17:23.659 --> 07:17:32.240]  I like to call it a kamala cost because there were so many millions of votes that just came out in favor of patriotism and populism and national sovereignty over globalism and leftism.
[07:17:33.139 --> 07:17:40.380]  This plague, the real pandemic that has come across our nation and our culture and the West as a whole over the course of the last several years.
[07:17:43.959 --> 07:17:46.080]  And so, of course, they were going to try to shut us down this morning.
[07:17:46.159 --> 07:17:52.560]  And maybe we'll get it back next week, and maybe we'll be broadcasting from those studios next week, and maybe not.
[07:17:53.000 --> 07:17:57.020]  And maybe we'll only have it back for a little bit, and then it will really go away, and then maybe not.
[07:17:58.159 --> 07:18:02.040]  But it doesn't even matter, because today we reached a record audience.
[07:18:02.880 --> 07:18:08.040]  On a completely new network on all the same stations because of you, the listeners.
[07:18:08.319 --> 07:18:13.680]  And this was all made possible because over the course of the last several months, you went to the alexjonesstore.com.
[07:18:13.759 --> 07:18:16.599]  You signed up for the VIP club to ensure that we'd have recurring revenue.
[07:18:16.720 --> 07:18:17.819]  You bought the shirts.
[07:18:17.819 --> 07:18:18.779]  You bought the supplements.
[07:18:19.020 --> 07:18:22.319]  You supported us on the alexjonesstore.com because that was the first thing they tried to do.
[07:18:22.439 --> 07:18:27.619]  They made it impossible for the Infowars store to order new inventory.
[07:18:27.779 --> 07:18:35.909]  So we couldn't even buy product to sell in order to support The organization, Infowars, Free Speech Systems.
[07:18:36.209 --> 07:18:46.990]  And after they did that, I was fortunate enough that I'd done a podcast with the Hodge twins, who also work with Bigly, American heroes at Bigly, by the way.
[07:18:48.409 --> 07:18:56.310]  And when I did that podcast, I got connected with the Bigly Boys and I said, hey, we need a solution at Infowars because they are trying to strangle us out of having any inventory in the store.
[07:18:56.409 --> 07:18:59.310]  They want us to bleed out before they even have to shut us down.
[07:18:59.430 --> 07:19:00.869]  And they set up this store for us.
[07:19:00.990 --> 07:19:02.270]  They set up a partnership for us.
[07:19:02.349 --> 07:19:07.130]  They took all of the risk and they ordered and fulfilled products.
[07:19:07.270 --> 07:19:08.569]  They designed t-shirts.
[07:19:08.770 --> 07:19:10.849]  I mean, amazing work, unbelievable work.
[07:19:10.950 --> 07:19:17.069]  And it kept us on the air for the last three months and ensured that this broadcast was a record broadcast from Alex Jones.
[07:19:17.849 --> 07:19:19.630]  I am so proud to work with this crew.
[07:19:19.770 --> 07:19:21.330]  I am so proud to work with Bigley.
[07:19:21.450 --> 07:19:23.130]  I am so proud to work for Alex Jones.
[07:19:23.270 --> 07:19:31.389]  And the longer that I work here for Alex Jones, the more resolved I am in him, the more confident I am in him, the more assured I am that I made the right decision.
[07:19:31.750 --> 07:19:34.130]  And it's not even about what he says even.
[07:19:34.250 --> 07:19:50.180]  Even if I disagreed with everything he said, which I don't, but even if I did disagree with everything that Alex Jones said, I would still be proud to work here because he has become a symbol of freedom of speech itself and I would die for anyone's right to speak their mind, to express themselves,
[07:19:50.419 --> 07:19:52.479]  especially if I disagree with them.
[07:19:54.810 --> 07:19:59.470]  We want the likes of CNN and MSNBC and NPR to be canceled because nobody watches them.
[07:19:59.729 --> 07:20:04.229]  We don't want to hijack them using lawfare and sue them on some trumped up bull crap.
[07:20:04.810 --> 07:20:11.110]  We're not trying to weaponize the government against our media opposition, against our political press.
[07:20:11.709 --> 07:20:15.750]  We're just trying to beat them in the information war by winning all of their listeners over.
[07:20:16.090 --> 07:20:17.810]  And frankly, it's very obvious that that's happening.
[07:20:18.819 --> 07:20:21.459]  What, two million viewers on one of our X accounts alone?
[07:20:21.799 --> 07:20:23.439]  Not counting the Real Alex Jones one?
[07:20:23.580 --> 07:20:28.939]  On AJN Live, we've had over two million viewers today, just on AJN Live on X. Plus it was on Real Alex Jones.
[07:20:29.099 --> 07:20:30.599]  Plus it was on Ad Infowars.
[07:20:30.759 --> 07:20:31.880]  Plus we were on Rumble.
[07:20:32.159 --> 07:20:33.419]  Was record numbers there.
[07:20:33.619 --> 07:20:34.580]  Plus we're on radio.
[07:20:34.720 --> 07:20:38.580]  Plus we're on TV. We have a greater audience than these mainstream outlets.
[07:20:40.040 --> 07:20:41.759]  Jake Tapper's being denied raises.
[07:20:42.040 --> 07:20:48.220]  There's rumors going around of mass layoffs coming again, including top talent at these major networks, CNN and others.
[07:20:49.470 --> 07:20:51.930]  But Alex Jones is still on the air after they mocked him for years.
[07:20:52.090 --> 07:20:52.709]  He's going to be canceled.
[07:20:52.810 --> 07:20:53.349]  He's going to be canceled.
[07:20:53.490 --> 07:20:55.490]  They have fallen like flies.
[07:20:58.069 --> 07:21:01.450]  From their own networks, their own esteemed establishment networks.
[07:21:01.450 --> 07:21:06.169]  It's so safe and professional to work for Fox News with our tacky boomer graphics.
[07:21:06.290 --> 07:21:13.150]  They make fun of Donald Trump because he's got gold all over and he's got an elaborate taste and the way that the inside of his house is designed.
[07:21:13.270 --> 07:21:14.810]  They say, oh, his taste is so tacky.
[07:21:14.869 --> 07:21:15.750]  His taste is so tacky.
[07:21:15.830 --> 07:21:21.729]  Well, they have the most dated-looking news outlets I've ever seen in my life.
[07:21:21.770 --> 07:21:23.189]  At least Infowars is cool.
[07:21:23.650 --> 07:21:26.750]  At least Infowars has some balls, right?
[07:21:28.180 --> 07:21:44.740]  I mean, brass balls, actually cool stuff, actually fighting, actually running around trying to save freedom of speech as threats of sending the police in to shut us down or force us out, or as they actually literally pull the plug so that Infowars.com is down.
[07:21:44.860 --> 07:21:46.119]  I don't even know if Bandot Video is down.
[07:21:46.240 --> 07:21:51.700]  We had to shut down the Infowars store today to not take any more orders because we don't know if we're going to be able to fulfill them, but the Alex Jones store, we certainly can.
[07:21:52.900 --> 07:21:56.200]  That place is the number one place to fight for freedom, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[07:21:56.279 --> 07:21:57.319]  Get whatever you want, whatever you can.
[07:21:59.279 --> 07:22:00.819]  Absolutely amazing stuff.
[07:22:01.240 --> 07:22:04.279]  But they literally pulled the plug on InfoWars today.
[07:22:04.419 --> 07:22:05.639]  I never thought I'd seen anything like it.
[07:22:05.860 --> 07:22:10.759]  I mean, I felt like I was watching a movie that I just happened to be in today.
[07:22:12.419 --> 07:22:14.680]  Today was 100%.
[07:22:17.269 --> 07:22:24.110]  We're good to go.
[07:22:38.860 --> 07:22:42.840]  I'm happy for them that for the first time in at least a decade, people have actually read their content.
[07:22:43.319 --> 07:22:44.540]  That's good for them, but it's sad.
[07:22:44.619 --> 07:22:45.200]  You know, I get it.
[07:22:45.439 --> 07:22:54.319]  But at the same sense, it's such a blissful, euphoric feeling to break free from chains.
[07:22:55.459 --> 07:23:18.860]  And Infowars for years, even years before I started working there last year, it has been a network, a broadcast, a business operating in chains, trying to eke out decisions, choices, business moves with the approval of a court system and bad people being sent in by the courts in the states pretending to be our friends and they're bad actors on the inside.
[07:23:19.000 --> 07:23:19.900]  They almost shut us down in June.
[07:23:20.040 --> 07:23:21.680]  You've heard about it from Alex countless times.
[07:23:23.060 --> 07:23:35.080]  And now we have liberated ourselves like in Gladiator, when all the gladiators liberated themselves, like in Spartacus, when Spartacus had that rebellion, and we are capable of doing so much more.
[07:23:36.040 --> 07:23:44.659]  I said yesterday to the crew, because we were speculating, as co-workers do, as family does, really feel that these guys are family, what was going to happen?
[07:23:44.740 --> 07:23:47.639]  I kept saying, no matter what happens tomorrow, we win.
[07:23:47.799 --> 07:23:49.599]  If we keep InfoWars, we win.
[07:23:49.720 --> 07:23:51.720]  If they take it and shut it down, we win.
[07:23:51.860 --> 07:23:53.619]  And today, we won.
[07:23:54.380 --> 07:24:01.520]  Because of you, the listeners, you who believe in truth, you who believe in free speech, freedom of expression, we won.
[07:24:03.209 --> 07:24:04.810]  Now, the Infowar is never won or lost.
[07:24:04.950 --> 07:24:06.229]  You're either winning it or you're losing it.
[07:24:06.330 --> 07:24:10.169]  But today we won a battle akin to the battle that we won on Election Day last week.
[07:24:10.610 --> 07:24:18.389]  This was a landslide victory for freedom of speech because you, the audience, proved that no matter what kind of shit they pull, we're still going to win.
[07:24:18.470 --> 07:24:20.009]  We're still going to stay loyal to Alex.
[07:24:20.169 --> 07:24:25.029]  We're still going to stay loyal to free speech and our principles and our founding fathers and our culture.
[07:24:27.340 --> 07:24:40.200]  And I tell you what, out of all the problems and miracles that have happened over time, all the donations on Bitcoin, all the supporters who funded or donated, the prayers did actually work the most.
[07:24:40.880 --> 07:24:46.110]  Because we didn't know when we flipped the switch on today, Whether or not it was going to be a ghost town.
[07:24:46.830 --> 07:24:47.709]  And it wasn't.
[07:24:47.830 --> 07:24:49.790]  It was like Mardi Gras out there with the audience.
[07:24:50.009 --> 07:24:51.450]  The replies, the comments.
[07:24:51.610 --> 07:24:52.750]  I am just so pleased.
[07:24:52.950 --> 07:24:53.770]  I am so proud.
[07:24:54.169 --> 07:24:59.349]  The only thing that sucks about today is that I'm going to have a terrible time going to sleep tonight because I'm so excited.
[07:24:59.569 --> 07:25:01.729]  I'm going to be exhausted in the morning when we hit it again.
[07:25:01.889 --> 07:25:02.729]  When we win again.
[07:25:03.439 --> 07:25:13.200]  But every day that you listen, every day that you tune in to Alex Jones, whether you're on radio, TV, X, Rumble, wherever, or at AlexJones.network, you can watch as well.
[07:25:14.080 --> 07:25:18.439]  Every day that you tune in is a major victory for patriotism, for freedom for America.
[07:25:20.680 --> 07:25:25.500]  And it's all so fresh that, frankly, I'm at a loss for words.
[07:25:26.590 --> 07:25:27.430]  As to what to say.
[07:25:28.009 --> 07:25:28.970]  I'm inspired.
[07:25:29.150 --> 07:25:29.630]  I'm excited.
[07:25:29.909 --> 07:25:35.169]  They're going to make movies about this in 50 years, what happened today, if Hollywood isn't a satanic pedophile cult anymore.
[07:25:36.270 --> 07:25:50.490]  I mean, this is cooler today, what I saw, than what you see in movies like Wolf of Wall Street or other rags-to-riches stories of struggle in the beginning and then bootstrapping and resilience and conviction and then overcoming and then success.
[07:25:51.380 --> 07:26:05.500]  This was the coolest thing I ever could have dreamed of and I had no idea when I started my podcast after January 6th of 2021 that that was eventually going to lead me to this place and it's all God.
[07:26:06.360 --> 07:26:22.330]  Many of you have probably seen the video of Charlie Kirk after he heard that Donald Trump won the election and The first thing he said after he had his face in his hands for some time, just shocked and delighted, was that it's all God.
[07:26:22.950 --> 07:26:26.270]  And it's true, it's all God, but it's God working through you.
[07:26:27.330 --> 07:26:31.970]  People talk about God's miracles and his ability as divine intervention in our reality.
[07:26:33.900 --> 07:26:35.419]  But it's not some magical thing.
[07:26:35.599 --> 07:26:38.020]  It's his will through those willing to follow it.
[07:26:38.639 --> 07:26:45.979]  So we're going to cut to this clip from this morning of Steve Bannon on the final broadcast on Infowars with Alex Jones.
[07:26:46.159 --> 07:26:49.099]  We're going to loop this broadcast and we'll be back in the morning.
[07:26:49.740 --> 07:26:51.000]  Good night and good luck.
