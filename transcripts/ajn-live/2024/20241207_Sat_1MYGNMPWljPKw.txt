[00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.540]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head on the right wing of the chart?

[00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.829]  Merry Christmas!
[00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:46.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Pearl Harbor Day.
[00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.770]  December 7th, 2024. And the globalists are preparing their own new sneak attack.
[00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.729]  A new virus or viruses.
[00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.650]  They're openly bragging.
[00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.689]  We'll explain what's coming next on this live Saturday emergency transmission.
[00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.349]  Tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.289]  You are the Paul Revere.
[00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.590]  Share the live links from X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.349]  The AJN Network at AJN Live.
[00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.689]  And of course, InfoWars.
[00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.849]  Share the live feed now everywhere.
[00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.110]  You are the resistance.
[00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.889]  You are the victory.
[00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:30.430]  The entire world is racing into the fourth turning and the greatest quickening our species has seen in 10,000 years of recorded history.
[00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.250]  You know you're in a war, right?
[00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.310]  And it's a declared war.
[00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.310]  The Globals have declared war on team humanity.
[00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.710]  They declared war on the God that made us.
[00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.150]  It is not incredible.
[00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.370]  It is not heroic.
[00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.810]  It is not amazing to fight this.
[00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.270]  It is survival.
[00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.569]  This is the priority.
[00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.530]  This is the real world.
[00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.430]  This is game time.
[00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.330]  This is the crossroads of human destiny.
[00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.909]  Right now.
[00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.729]  Right now.
[00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.270]  And I see a bunch of other people not realizing how desperate the situation is!
[00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.509]  We need maximum urgency!
[00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.789]  We're up against the most evil people the world's ever seen!
[00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.270]  Don't you understand that?!
[00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.069]  I don't want anybody to go out and be physically violent.
[00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.129]  I want you to kill with truth.
[00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.670]  Kill with your will.
[00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:17.389]  Kill!
[00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.009]  Kill!
[00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.410]  Kill their lies!
[00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:45.209]  December 7th, 2024, Saturday, emergency transmission from the Alex Jones Network studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.490]  Now, we are not in the Infowar studios.
[00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.649]  Those could be shut down as early as Monday evening.
[00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.550]  There's another huge evidentiary hearing in the federal bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas.
[00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.569]  I'll be there Monday.
[00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.790]  And I am predicting if there's any justice in this universe that the bad guys are in a lot of trouble.
[00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.569]  But that is not what we're here to talk about on this live Saturday emergency transmission.
[00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:33.689]  Yes, the case against us by the Democratic Party and Michael Bloomberg to shut us down, it's all come out now, run by the FBI and CIA, is emblematic of the lawfare and the tyranny that we face, just as President Trump and many others have faced.
[00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.350]  And it's just an example of the fact that we're over the target.
[00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.990]  But that is a minor part of the larger war.
[00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.470]  No info war is the one I do, and what we do as a team is critical, and what you do, sharing the reports, the videos, the articles, and the documents is...
[00:05:50.259 --> 00:06:02.379]  The essence of the global awakening we see, we are all faced by the globalist technocrats, the crisis creators, who then manage the crises they create and exacerbate.
[00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:07.199]  We are all victims of their operations, and the world's waking up to it.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:28.459]  The Great Awakening's here, they're in full panic mode, but they have multiple tracks To try to derail President Trump and Elon Musk and other populist leaders both in government and in corporations and in private life here on our planet.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:48.129]  So today I wanted to talk about hiding in plain view One of the main attacks that the corrupt technocrats,
[00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:55.149]  the transhumanists, the death cult, are launching against President Trump, the American people, and the people of the world.
[00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:04.389]  Now, I have focused intensely on the World War III track.
[00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:14.189]  But the big one is going to be the viral bioweapon attack, COVID 2.0.
[00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.589]  Which ties into the economic attack.
[00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.490]  We have the evidence.
[00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:25.790]  The enemy is very arrogant.
[00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.009]  They've already launched it.
[00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.290]  We're going to expose it when we come back in 60 seconds.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.459]  That is a badass shirt.
[00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:38.279]  That is the best Trump 47 shirt out there.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.540]  That is my idea.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.579]  And I knew that the Verizon, you know, better coverage than Verizon Trump shirt would be a big seller.
[00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:46.740]  It is a bestseller.
[00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.800]  I think this is way better.
[00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:48.980]  I'm going to wear this.
[00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:50.800]  This is the Trump shirt I'm going to wear.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.000]  That's available at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.120]  And this is a war.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.000]  It takes money to win wars.
[00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:58.000]  And they got it installed.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.399]  They are great patriots.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:12.699]  You know them.
[00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:13.240]  We've had them in here.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.860]  There's over 250 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now at thealexshundestore.com.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:28.399]  It is definitely the biggest patriot, anti-New World Order, Trump, anti-globalist, 1776 Americana clothing shop in the galaxy.
[00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:32.500]  So, the best Trump gear, the best patriot gear, the best InfoWars gear, it's all there.
[00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:53.110]  We're good to go.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:17.460]  It is Saturday, December 7th, 2024, 2.06 Central Standard Time.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.899]  I'm coming to you from the studios of the Alex Jones Network here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:28.399]  We are 43 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:38.200]  Now, humanity is in a fighting position.
[00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:55.649]  We have a really good chance of stopping the massive escalations in the full nuclear war, stabilizing the global economy and not having a complete collapse that was part of the globalist plan in the Great Reset to bring in their global cashless society and neo-feudalism.
[00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:02.309]  We have a very good chance of exposing their DEI that's meant to divide and conquer all the peoples of the world so they can be controlled.
[00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.529]  We have a very good chance of stopping the next big viral weapon release.
[00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:15.769]  And hysteria and control that the UN and their controllers want for the global treaty and for the cashless society.
[00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:17.909]  And we tie all that together how they integrate it.
[00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:26.929]  And I've been talking a lot about the different tracks and they overlay each other that the globalists are using for total control.
[00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:45.190]  And I've been mainly focused in the last few months on the desperate transhumanist death cult openly saying we're going to derail populism and Trump and people trying to stop our system with escalating wars around the world,
[00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:52.470]  namely the situation that we are witnessing today.
[00:10:54.549 --> 00:11:24.330]  With the Ukraine war, and it was very easy to predict that, indeed, as soon as Trump became president-elect, that the globalist and the lame duck of the Biden administration would Start bombing Russia proper,
[00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:37.139]  the Russian mainland, with attack on storm shadows and other high-powered precision weapons to Create a massive escalation there.
[00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:38.840]  And it indeed happened just as I predicted.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.340]  And the reason I point that out is many of you watch, many of you heard that.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:42.919]  It's on record.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.759]  If you missed it, you can just see it.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:54.240]  Type into X. Alex Jones predicted that once president was president-elect, once Trump was president-elected, that this was what the Biden administration would do.
[00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:55.980]  Because we could see them getting it ready.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.580]  It wasn't hard.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.559]  So when I tell you...
[00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:19.590]  That the other big track is going to be a new viral release and an attempt to redo what they did with COVID. And I will walk through the ridiculous evidence of that and them even admitting it.
[00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:31.970]  Now, obviously, I said a year ago and six months ago and a month ago, right before the election, I said, escalate World War III. Release new viruses and total hysteria and try to bring back lockdowns.
[00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:46.789]  Domestic terror attacks, blaming it on Trump supporters, attacking migrants and others to try to kick Trump out of office once he gets in by saying he's a dictator.
[00:12:47.009 --> 00:13:02.679]  And now you've seen them saying he's going to come in, he's going to be Hitler, he's going to use the military, he's going to attack the blue cities while the Democrats and the Soros controllers say to the Blue cities.
[00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:06.639]  Hey, rise up against Trump.
[00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:12.460]  And so my predictions on that came true.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:20.080]  They're now in the final preparatory phase for the false flags to create what they call a race war for civil unrest, for civil emergency, for martial law.
[00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.309]  And they have the Pentagon meeting publicly and saying we're not going to follow his orders when he tries to become a dictator and all this stuff.
[00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:31.750]  They're going to create the crisis when Trump responds, call any constitutional activity illegal.
[00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:35.409]  The Pentagon two weeks ago was on CNN. Oh, we're meeting.
[00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:43.110]  If he says the military can be involved with the Border Patrol or arresting any of these human traffickers, why, we're going to go after him because he's a dictator.
[00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:49.220]  And then, of course, the Ninth Circuit ruled last week, no, that's totally constitutional.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.000]  Well, I don't need to hear the Ninth Circuit say that.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.139]  It's in the damn Constitution, one of the few main duties that the feds are actually supposed to do.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.899]  So, it wasn't hard to predict.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.320]  In fact, it's not even a prediction.
[00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:07.980]  I mean, they've been pre-programming all of this.
[00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:16.559]  They said in 2000, in August, if Trump wins, We're going to have Western states, Democrat, leftist states, blue states secede.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:24.320]  We're going to declare him a dictator, and we're going to have a civil war, and we believe the military will be on our side, and we will remove Trump.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.980]  That was in the New York Times.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.039]  I covered it all last week.
[00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:33.820]  I'm just reminding people, and also new viewers, and then when they were able to steal it in 2020, they didn't need that.
[00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:38.720]  And so now they're trying to bring that plan back with 43 days left.
[00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:53.940]  But that plan is once he gets in and sends out Tom Holm and the border czar, then they'll have false flaggers attack a migrant group or Democrats in blue cities that are uprising like the mayor of Denver and others have called for, and Governor Newsom has called for, and also the governor of Massachusetts.
[00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:57.700]  So that's the big crisis once he gets in.
[00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:02.659]  And I don't think they're going to be able to pull it off or get away with it because people are aware of their activities.
[00:15:05.719 --> 00:15:07.539]  And Trump is doing the right thing.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.879]  He's going on the offense saying, yeah, we're going to criminally go after the human traffickers, including the federal agency heads like Mayorkas and others.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.019]  So now they're talking about blanket pardons to counter that.
[00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:25.000]  So that's in 43 days.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.799]  And they won't be able to launch anything until Trump's in a few weeks.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.559]  But that's...
[00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:35.840]  Like an asteroid coming towards the Earth, but it's a million miles away right now.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.700]  It's not quite here.
[00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:52.820]  World War III and the fact that Putin said we're basically already in it and it just hasn't gone nuclear yet is the big front and center issue I'll cover in a moment with the latest developments with Trump in Paris, meeting with Zelensky and Macron and more.
[00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:12.840]  So there's the false flag trigger for leftist, globalist, deep state insurrection, the movie that came out this year.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.519]  Civil War is a blueprint for that.
[00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:29.559]  There is the war escalation issue that you see breaking out everywhere with NATO and the CIA on record in Georgia, Syria, just all over, stirring up all those new conflicts.
[00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.509]  So they're still going ahead with that.
[00:16:32.649 --> 00:16:35.330]  Trump's trying to stop it, and he's got statements on that today.
[00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.370]  We'll get to that first, but briefly.
[00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.269]  But the big enchilada, and we put up the live show feed from X right now.
[00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:48.330]  You can read the headline I put out right as we went live.
[00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:59.509]  And it's really up to you, Paul Revere, to take this live show feed from Real Alex Jones and at AJN Live and at InfoWars on X and to share it and say, hey, Alex Jones is on air right now.
[00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:03.120]  He's accurately predicted the bad guy's next moves hundreds of times.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:10.259]  He's laying out their battle plan to stop Trump and stop the world from getting out from under their control.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.660]  Alex Jones, Network Emergency Saturday broadcast.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.460]  Globalists planning new COVID-like bioattacks to stop Trump and enslave humanity.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.859]  That's the AJN headline.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.400]  Let's pull up the real Alex Jones headline because that's the one I wrote that really nails it.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.000]  So, I want to cover this first.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:39.079]  Saturday emergency broadcast globalists are publicly bragging that they are set to launch a new pandemic to stop the Trump agenda, collapse the world economy, and bring in world government.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.279]  That is exactly what's going on.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.519]  And then finally, we'll show you the real Alex Jones headline.
[00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:44.900]  I can pull it up.
[00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:47.759]  Because that...
[00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.299]  Absolutely nails it.
[00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:58.339]  Emergency transmission, global forces preparing bioweapon to create chaos, collapse economy, and usher in global rule.
[00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:03.759]  And that's a retweet of one I put out, but I'll go to it and show it to you.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.640]  This is an important headline.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.200]  Saturday emergency broadcast.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.619]  Global is preparing to release new viruses to kill Trump agenda.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:32.839]  Gaze virologist admits elite designing deadly new viruses to cripple Trump presidency and bring in global government.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.880]  All right.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.339]  So, great job.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.480]  I just want to get that out there for people so you understand.
[00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.299]  This is not a...
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.180]  Spectator sport.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.579]  This is the real world.
[00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:51.700]  You have all the power when you decide on X right now to take those live feeds and say, this is really important.
[00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.839]  This is censored information.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.859]  This guy is accurately predicting what the bad guys are going to do before.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.039]  He's laying out their battle plan that's already been launched right now.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:00.859]  Okay?
[00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:08.940]  Now, I've been on here 30 years, and a lot of people that were informed about the globalists knew I knew my stuff.
[00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:11.200]  And listen, that was a very small minority, maybe 1%.
[00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:17.609]  We're upwards in the West now, around half the public knowing about the New World Order and the globalist agenda.
[00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.789]  And they wake up, it's exponential.
[00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:26.950]  That's why they've got to make their moves now, because if this awakening continues for even six more months, there's no way they ever beat us this time.
[00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:29.349]  Now, we're not offering utopia.
[00:19:29.509 --> 00:19:34.750]  It's not going to be perfect, but it's not going to be government designed to collapse society and enslave and poison and mass murder.
[00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:38.329]  And we're still dumbed down and decadent and have big problems and need God.
[00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.950]  And there's all sorts of laziness and people are poisoned and dying.
[00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:50.410]  It's rough, but it's a lot better than the globalists managing it to accelerate the collapse by design, which is their official plan.
[00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:59.670]  So people now really understand when you tune in to this show, That I'm not exaggerating this stuff.
[00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:04.390]  The problem is this.
[00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:18.150]  I am one of the only people with a big audience, other than Elon Musk or Tucker Carlson, and obviously Elon has the biggest, and that's great, that are actually hitting the super ultra-hardcore information.
[00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:21.589]  Trump hits some of it, but his politicos will say, sir, this is too hardcore.
[00:20:21.589 --> 00:20:22.309]  It sounds crazy.
[00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.349]  No, we're being attacked by craziness.
[00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:25.549]  You have to admit what it is.
[00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.589]  So here's the deal.
[00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:43.900]  When I say the globalists, and I'm going to name names, are openly rolling out new viruses to stop the populist take back of our planet, it's not even me analyzing that two years ago, six months ago, saying that'll be the obvious move if Trump gets back in.
[00:20:44.829 --> 00:20:58.549]  We have Hotez, because Fauci's so discredited, he's not talking now, but they admit he's the new spokesman, officially, for the UN here and for, you know, the whole globalist cartel, saying, oh, Trump's going to get hit.
[00:20:59.289 --> 00:21:01.589]  It's going to come crashing down on him.
[00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:02.269]  That's a quote.
[00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.309]  Played the clip like 10 times this week.
[00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:10.289]  And he just rattles off 11 deadly viruses that are all here to kill you.
[00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.089]  It's the most ridiculous fear-mongering ever.
[00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:27.309]  And all they got to do is turn the PCR test up when they test milk or anything to a high enough level and it'll say the air is COVID. You can point at a papaya and say it's got COVID or point it at water and say you just turn it up just like a metal detector.
[00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.829]  You can put a metal detector in the sky and turn it high enough and it'll say it found gold in the air.
[00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:31.609]  It's not there.
[00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.910]  It's just a feedback loop.
[00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:34.710]  And that's a whole other subject.
[00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:39.210]  But we've got Tedros at the UN, the WHO head.
[00:21:39.369 --> 00:21:42.190]  We've got Dr. Ryan, the head of the Global Emergency Management.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:55.039]  Response at the UN. We've got Hotez, all of them, doing exactly what Fauci did in early 2017, saying, don't worry.
[00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:57.099]  Trump will follow our agenda.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.940]  There will be a new pandemic.
[00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:02.240]  It's coming, and it will teach them to do what we say.
[00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:06.400]  And Bill Gates is out running around saying the same thing everywhere.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.059]  We'll go over a bunch of this here.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.779]  But the issue is...
[00:22:11.859 --> 00:22:14.480]  They've already tried to hype monkeypox twice the last three years.
[00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:18.019]  They've already tried to hype all this, but now, oh, hundreds and hundreds dead in the Congo.
[00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:21.359]  Some new hemorrhagic fever that makes you bleed out of your eyes and die.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.779]  Oh, hundreds dying in California, young people.
[00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:25.299]  We don't know what's killing a mystery virus.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.940]  Yeah, every one of them they look at has been given the COVID shots.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.960]  Their immune system's gone.
[00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:30.819]  Regular viruses just kill them now.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.400]  It's what it does.
[00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:39.200]  So now they're going to call all the mass death, the 30-plus million and growing from the poison shots, mystery diseases.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.960]  As I predicted, and as all the different scientists and top doctors on the show have told you for four plus years.
[00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:50.980]  I mean, they know what they're doing, and when you see what they're doing, it's easy to figure out their next step.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.319]  Plus, they brag.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:02.420]  I mean, I could play you Dr. Bauer, you know, the head of the British Government Institute, saying, huh, four years ago, once we give you the third COVID mRNA shot, you have no immune system, and we'll own you for life.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.160]  He just starts laughing.
[00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:05.779]  It's so funny.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:18.519]  So, when I say they're going to counter Trump with all this new hype, They don't even need a new virus because there's all this escalating death from people that don't have immune systems that took the shots and all the weird autoimmune disorders.
[00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:21.819]  That's what the COVID shot does in thousands of studies.
[00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:25.720]  The mRNA shot erases your immune system.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:34.920]  It doesn't kill T lymphocytes, white blood cells that program the rest of the cells to attack foreign invaders, bacteria viruses.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.720]  It turns them off.
[00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.420]  They just sit there and just wander around.
[00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:47.650]  And then your bone marrow makes more of them, but the spike protein's floating around in there and it turns them off.
[00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:50.109]  Yeah, there's Dr. David Bowyer.
[00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:50.789]  Go watch the clip.
[00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.289]  I've already played it like probably 300 times in four years.
[00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:53.910]  I'm going to play it again.
[00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.829]  So there's literally thousands of these clips.
[00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:00.809]  All right?
[00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:05.190]  So they are everywhere.
[00:24:09.459 --> 00:24:12.420]  Saying, don't worry, we're going to get control of the agenda.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:22.519]  We're going to get our UN tree that takes over your body and creates a global ID that they admit will be used for the global internet ID for the global carbon tax.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.740]  It's all the same thing, officially, with Bill Gates and the UN and the Chinese communists standardizing it three years ago.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.539]  It's all official.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:44.059]  And they're building giant Pandemic facilities all over the Western world for tens of millions of people in the U.S. alone under FEMA, admitting it's for the next pandemic.
[00:24:44.779 --> 00:24:51.839]  And then Governor Hochul and others and then Dr. Ryan at the U.N. and then the Australian government, hell over in Europe and Australia.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:58.660]  They would arrest people during the COVID tyranny drill, martial law drill, beta test for an even worse bioattack and worse shot.
[00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:07.269]  Saying, oh, we're going to put people, and they did, in these facilities that don't go along with the lockdowns or agree with us or protest.
[00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:15.430]  So it won't just be getting censored off the internet like we saw in the West or here in the U.S. if you protested the COVID lockdowns like we did.
[00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:19.190]  It will be locking you up.
[00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:23.269]  Now, we've got to get ahead of that so people don't buy into it and don't comply.
[00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:32.839]  Just like I told you, 15, 16 months ago that, hey, they're going to try to roll out this winter, new lockdowns, new mask, new control.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.339]  And two months later, they did exactly what I said, and people couldn't believe it.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:41.119]  I had it from high-level Border Patrol, high-level federal agents, and high-level TSA here in Austin.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:42.900]  And I'll stop there.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.039]  Okay?
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.000]  People are like, oh, they wouldn't dare try that.
[00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:50.099]  And then I said, oh, it's coming in two months, according to the...
[00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:51.119]  And it's exactly as...
[00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:52.559]  People are like, whoa, Jones is incredible.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.839]  I'm not incredible.
[00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:57.539]  I have tens of millions of people tuning in every day.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.119]  And then I have all these contacts.
[00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:15.940]  And the Border Patrol contacts and the TSA management, it's not even TSA, but it's Transportation Department, but it's over the TSA. I mean, I've known the TSA person 25 years, and I've known him through his brother I'm good friends with.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.779]  I mean, I've done fishing trips and drink a lot of beer with them.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.779]  So, I mean, when they told me, they showed me this stuff, too.
[00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.240]  Wouldn't give me a copy.
[00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:24.400]  They said, you know, we'll trace it back here.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.579]  And then when I called some board patrol and called some feds, they said, yeah, we're being told that's coming, too.
[00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:31.500]  But the TSA had been given the specifics by their managers.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.839]  And the guy I was talking to is their boss.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.839]  I don't want to give away too much, but the point is he said I can say that much.
[00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:46.710]  So, when I tell you this stuff, I'm not talking out of my rear end, but you don't need to believe me.
[00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.690]  Hotez said it will come crashing down on Trump and enlisted 11 viruses.
[00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.910]  And then now the fear-mongering is on 11. They've turned it all the way up to 110%.
[00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:06.750]  And it's just over the top.
[00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.730]  And I asked this question four years ago.
[00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:19.730]  I said, if they kill all these people with these shots, even the FDA's own prediction, October 2000 documents said, we predict these will be the adverse reactions.
[00:27:19.849 --> 00:27:21.109]  They're not adverse reactions, they're designed.
[00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:27.130]  Cardiovascular, heart attacks, infertility, turbo cancers, myocarditis, strokes.
[00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:39.509]  I said, once this really gets rolling, they'll then use new pandemics, As the cover for really all the death that's already happening, and that's where we are.
[00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:53.009]  But that doesn't mean they won't actually release something new and nasty, because COVID was new, was a chimeric, is synthetic, and is a combination of all the cancer viruses they hit us with in the last 30 years plus.
[00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.269]  I had Dr. Mikovits on Thursday.
[00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.730]  She did a great job laying all this out, Dr. Mikovits.
[00:27:59.109 --> 00:27:59.549]  Mikovits.
[00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.230]  I always say Mikovits.
[00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:00.809]  Mikovits.
[00:28:01.309 --> 00:28:03.769]  So this is where we are.
[00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:09.259]  And I'm going to go ahead and cover this now, then I'm going to get into the war news.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.339]  I was going to hit that first, but we're going to go to...
[00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:25.529]  Just clip eight is B-roll of the, just, you know, there's hours of this, beating people up, riding over people with horses, attacking them.
[00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:31.349]  Then we'll go back to the war news, clip 19 and 20, and Trump and Zelensky meeting in Paris later.
[00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:44.170]  I'm going to skip ahead now, and in a moment we're going to go to clip 18. But first I want to show you Some of these documents.
[00:28:45.109 --> 00:28:46.089]  All right, overhead shot.
[00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.130]  Judicial bombshell.
[00:28:48.569 --> 00:28:56.609]  Federal judge forces FDA to release over a million pages of Pfizer's COVID-19 trial documents they wanted to keep hidden for 75 years.
[00:28:57.509 --> 00:29:00.190]  And that's a Robert F. Kennedy group.
[00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.809]  That's Dale Bigtree quarterbacking all that.
[00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:04.490]  What a hero.
[00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.549]  What heroes you are for supporting their work.
[00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:13.230]  Federal judge forced FDA to release a million pages of secret COVID-vax documents.
[00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.150]  Once RFK Jr. gets in, they're going to release it all.
[00:29:18.009 --> 00:29:24.529]  COVID shots, a dangerous genetic mechanism of action, major study creating mass cancer and breakdown of the body.
[00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:34.970]  Top professor in Australia, most respected doctor, tears up over exploding cancer rates related to the COVID jab and says he can't believe they did it.
[00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:35.910]  That's an incredible video.
[00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:37.329]  This is all on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.690]  This is your homework, folks.
[00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:47.579]  Prosecutor blocks lawsuit against EU's Ursula van der Leiden, the head of the unelected EU commission that's the dictatorship, the parlance is ceremonial.
[00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:52.359]  She got massive amounts of money from Pfizer and others to do all this illegally, but it's all being blocked.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.720]  So that's just some of the current background, but...
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.720]  You can put the clips up on screen where people can find it.
[00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:04.039]  I've already played them last week a bunch.
[00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:06.539]  Fauci saying, oh, don't worry.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.079]  Trump will be hit by a new virus.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.000]  That'll take control.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.220]  And then Hotez just came out last week and said, you know, 11 new viruses.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:14.880]  Totally deadly.
[00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:15.460]  So scary.
[00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:16.099]  Rubber the hills.
[00:30:16.259 --> 00:30:17.500]  This will crash down on Trump.
[00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:20.160]  The economy is going to be shot.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:33.460]  They want that to suck all the oxygen out of the Trump agenda of the Government Accountability Office, to suck out all the energy of trying to control the border, to distract away from him trying to turn the economy back on.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.880]  And bring the jobs back and cut the energy controls off to stop the inflation exploding.
[00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.779]  Because they want you poor.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.119]  They want you in debt.
[00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:52.440]  They want to bankrupt the world to bring in their new ESG, cashless society, central bank digital currencies in their own admissions.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.000]  So they're central banks that have unlimited money.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.240]  How do they get the rest of the economy they don't have?
[00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:00.039]  They crash it.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.400]  That's how they vertically integrate it.
[00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:13.009]  Three big central groups owned by private central banks are openly talking about all of this.
[00:31:13.109 --> 00:31:18.109]  So we're going to come back and play this incredibly important report that details it all and more.
[00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:20.589]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:25.410]  We'll talk about how you can do that as well when we come back.
[00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.829]  Stay with us.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.160]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.220]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.180]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.059]  So, we need to stay on air.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.680]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:48.680]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:31:48.859 --> 00:31:53.680]  And I told you we're not just going to have patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.660]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:59.259]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:07.119]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.019]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.500]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:15.400]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:17.519]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.460]  Unfortunately...
[00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:24.450]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:30.549]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.369]  That continues.
[00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:32.390]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.230]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.029]  I designed it.
[00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:40.970]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:42.450]  And they are a fundraiser.
[00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:43.930]  They are a piece of history.
[00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.950]  They're pure silver.
[00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:48.710]  They are minted here in America.
[00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:51.220]  2,000 of these.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.660]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.039]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:32:58.299 --> 00:32:59.299]  They are incredible.
[00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:06.059]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:14.190]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:33:14.329 --> 00:33:17.509]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.450]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:34.500]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:37.099]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.200]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:43.200]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:45.799]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.640]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:33:47.829 --> 00:33:50.730]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.150]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:33:53.349 --> 00:33:54.410]  They surprised me with this.
[00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.490]  I just learned this morning.
[00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.869]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.190]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:07.329]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:10.429]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.429]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.210]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.280]  Catapult them around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.019]  We've probably got 15 of those elf on a shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:21.880]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.820]  She puts Christmas tree lights in these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.900]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.719]  And I already called them.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.860]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.760]  So that means there's...
[00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.269]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.929]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:40.349]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:41.630]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:34:41.789 --> 00:34:42.829]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:44.590]  This baby is amazing.
[00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:49.949]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.849]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.130]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[00:34:57.469 --> 00:34:57.789]  Fully perfected.
[00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:05.269]  Posable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:13.429]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump meeting inaugurated next month.
[00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.230]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:35:15.469 --> 00:35:23.489]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot Year, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:13.179]  All right, let me get into the heart of the matter and show a bunch of these clips and documents right now.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.119]  And again, I just spent the first 30 minutes.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.239]  I know we have new viewers by the millions every day.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.079]  People are really concerned now, and you should be.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.400]  We can turn this around.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:22.980]  We can stop this.
[00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:23.619]  We're starting to.
[00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:24.420]  We have the initiative.
[00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:28.920]  We're winning, but you've got to face the hard.
[00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:30.760]  You've got to face how bad these people are.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:38.119]  And I know it's hard, but you've got to admit evil exists and that it's in a lot of control, not total control.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.940]  But they're trying to get total control.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.559]  As the UN said decades ago, that's how I knew they were going to use viruses and lockdowns and bring in world government.
[00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:51.800]  People will see the videos and be predicting that 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 14 years ago, 10 years ago.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.519]  And they go, how the hell do you say they're going to make us wear masks and six feet apart and lock down everything and make us stay in our houses?
[00:36:57.519 --> 00:36:58.619]  It was in their documents.
[00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:08.519]  And they said, we'll bring in world government with this and it'll be the training wheels for carbon taxes where your phone will track everything you do and tell you when you can leave your house, when you can use your car.
[00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:13.219]  When you can do anything, and that's just to get you ready to phase all that out.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:23.719]  And they're going to take away eating beef and make you eat bugs and have carbon taxes on everything and make people get rid of their animals, their dogs and cats, because they have a carbon footprint.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.800]  People are like, this is crazy.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:33.500]  When I'm showing you documents, showing UN official plans, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, and now we're in it.
[00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.489]  So, I mean, they've got a plan.
[00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.130]  It's public.
[00:37:36.289 --> 00:37:40.769]  And all you need to do is go look at it and go, my God, their plan 40 years ago, we're living it.
[00:37:40.889 --> 00:37:42.230]  Their plan 20 years ago, we're living it.
[00:37:43.429 --> 00:37:47.449]  And now we've got their plan for the rest of it, and it's public.
[00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.809]  I mean, they're not even hiding it now, and it's nightmarish.
[00:37:50.909 --> 00:37:51.849]  It's dystopic.
[00:37:52.849 --> 00:38:03.300]  So, I am asking you all extremely respectfully To take this once the show's not live, or even share it while it's live now, but take the archive of it this evening.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:12.519]  We'll put the full two hours I'm doing here live up on X and everywhere else and get it and share it and say, hey, you need to watch this.
[00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:24.039]  But the first 30 minutes was just me going over a lot of background and backstory and evidence and telling new viewers, because they're the lost sheep, hey, you need to listen to me.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.619]  Now I'm going to get to the big...
[00:38:26.519 --> 00:38:31.840]  Me to this, then get into the other crises the globalists are publicly running to try to keep us under their control as well.
[00:38:33.179 --> 00:38:34.539]  Because that's what this is all about.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:47.579]  Most people that are even patriots or populist or pro-human just cover whatever's breaking at the time, not the big societal movements, not what the globalists stand for, what we should stand for, to have real opposition.
[00:38:47.579 --> 00:38:48.659]  You can't just oppose something.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.659]  You've got to have an alternate plan.
[00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:53.840]  Elon Musk is talking about that now, so does Donald Trump.
[00:38:55.130 --> 00:39:00.050]  And yes, I've been visionary for decades saying, when they really launch the full plan, it's going to be so horrible.
[00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:00.869]  People aren't going to want it.
[00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.849]  We've got to expose it so people know that the more you give in to them, the worse it gets.
[00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.309]  Crises on top of crises on top of crises.
[00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:09.349]  And each time they say, just do what we say, it'll be okay.
[00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.829]  But incrementally, it only gets worse.
[00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:14.550]  We've got to oppose that.
[00:39:14.849 --> 00:39:23.869]  And then we've got to have alternate ideas of what civilization and society can be and not hating ourselves and not turning off our survival instinct and life force.
[00:39:24.639 --> 00:39:27.179]  It's what the whole fake environmental movement's about, not about saving the earth.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.960]  It's about you hating yourself and believing you should be a slave and you should be euthanized.
[00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:32.000]  You should be dumbed down.
[00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:33.480]  You should have your resources cut off.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.059]  So I'm going to get to that.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.420]  But let me talk about something really important to this message continuing to be able to get out.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.139]  If you just saw the ad we ran, that's for the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.539]  And that's great.
[00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:48.159]  And that supports Infowars.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.440]  And there's a lot of great products there.
[00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:54.760]  And that's currently supporting InfoWars.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.199]  I think InfoWars is going to make it, and that's great.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.099]  It's good to support that.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.619]  It's not owned by InfoWars.
[00:39:58.699 --> 00:39:59.880]  It's owned by a great sponsor.
[00:40:00.579 --> 00:40:05.039]  But that shopping cart supports some of us setting up a new network.
[00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:08.360]  That's the deal I struck with the U.S. trustee and the rest of it, where we get some of the money.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.300]  But a lot of it goes into InfoWars.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.599]  And so if InfoWars shuts down, we got a problem.
[00:40:17.869 --> 00:40:29.329]  So if you want to get the very same great products from the same great folks at Bigly, you want to go to another URL we're going to put on screen, and that is realalexjones.com.
[00:40:30.489 --> 00:40:43.239]  And that's got the t-shirts, the Patriot gear, the high-quality supplements, And everything that's over at thealexjonesstore.com is at realalexjones.com.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.500]  And the collectible posters that are fundraisers that have a good markup on them.
[00:40:46.519 --> 00:40:49.059]  So we actually get some funds in, but also a lot of competitively priced things.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.079]  Like the super popular Trump on a Stump, like Elf on a Shelf.
[00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.519]  Our sponsor only bought 2,000 of these.
[00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:58.539]  They're almost sold out.
[00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:00.480]  In fact, they're almost sold out at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:14.610]  There is a couple hundred of them, though, that have been allotted over to the Alex Jones site that everybody should visit and support because 100% goes to the Alex Jones Network when you do that, and that is realalexjones.com.
[00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:29.829]  So the place for supporters to go, if you want to support the Alex Jones Network to make sure we stay on air no matter what, get the very same products at the very same price, but where this network and this operation, the Alex Jones Network, gets all the support That is the place to go.
[00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:32.170]  So, realalexjones.com.
[00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.809]  And let me just show you before I get into the big news.
[00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:39.789]  It takes money to be on air and have the legal bills to fight back against the Democrats trying to shut us down and all the rest of it.
[00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:40.389]  So this is a war.
[00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:41.349]  I'm not a normal show.
[00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.789]  We need a lot more funds because of that, and that's not a secret.
[00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:45.110]  So look at these babies.
[00:41:45.789 --> 00:41:47.389]  These challenge coins are between nine...
[00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:50.079]  And $14 a piece.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.019]  They're heavy.
[00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:51.960]  They're nice.
[00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:53.059]  They're great mementos.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.139]  They're good conversation starters.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.480]  They're excellent stocking stuffers.
[00:41:56.559 --> 00:41:57.019]  There's gifts.
[00:41:58.039 --> 00:41:58.780]  They're amazing.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.099]  And that's for folks with a small budget or want to give out a lot of gifts.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.559]  And there's not just these two challenge coins.
[00:42:05.679 --> 00:42:06.000]  There's more.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:06.980]  All right.
[00:42:07.039 --> 00:42:07.659]  There's some great ones.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.539]  There are more coming out.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.360]  People love them.
[00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:29.340]  This is a coin made right here in America that is 0.999 silver, that is 1984 versus 1776, with the all-seeing eye on the New World Order on one side, and on the other side, the American Eagle and the Liberty Bell 1776. There are only,
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.360]  as of this broadcast, our sponsor is great, but they only made 2,000 of these coins.
[00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.650]  They're almost sold out at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:42:38.949 --> 00:42:46.250]  There are 200 left that are allotted to realalexjones.com.
[00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:49.949]  And I wish that I got more, but they didn't.
[00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:54.929]  And because if they had 10,000, we'd sell them out the next week and we'd have our funding problem solved for the next three or four months.
[00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.369]  But...
[00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:59.630]  They only ordered 2,000 of the Trump on a stump that's so popular.
[00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.070]  That'll be sold out today.
[00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.190]  So it's a great problem to have, except there's not enough of them.
[00:43:04.269 --> 00:43:07.829]  So people really like the Trump on a stump.
[00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:09.849]  It's opposable, figurine, really fun.
[00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:11.949]  Great conversation starter.
[00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.090]  Great to give us a gift.
[00:43:14.389 --> 00:43:15.989]  That's there as well.
[00:43:16.389 --> 00:43:21.489]  So the challenge coins, the silver coin, it's all there at...
[00:43:24.529 --> 00:43:27.849]  RealAlexJones.com And that is not owned by me.
[00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:29.449]  It's not owned by the globalists.
[00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.389]  If they take over InfoWars, they don't get it.
[00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.889]  It's owned by Bigly, the great folks that do such great work for so many other talk shows.
[00:43:36.409 --> 00:43:39.889]  And that's how we have the money with the Democrats.
[00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.190]  If I told you this, you're not going to believe it.
[00:43:44.289 --> 00:43:45.449]  I don't believe it, but it's true.
[00:43:47.929 --> 00:44:02.809]  If you go to the news and just type in Alex Jones, $326 million, They filed two weeks ago in federal court that they've spent $326 million suing me, the Democrat Party law firms, in the last seven years and we're still on air.
[00:44:03.469 --> 00:44:05.590]  Nobody survived that long except for Trump and Elon Musk.
[00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:08.590]  They got Giuliani, hundreds of other people destroyed within one year.
[00:44:08.929 --> 00:44:10.789]  That's been your support keeping us on air.
[00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:13.690]  And they are so pissed we're on air.
[00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:14.690]  They are so angry.
[00:44:14.789 --> 00:44:17.170]  They never wanted to settle with us with their fake rig lawsuits.
[00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:20.030]  They're on record saying we want him off air.
[00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:25.829]  326 million as of 13 days ago, 14 days ago.
[00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:28.110]  Two Mondays ago, so 12 days ago.
[00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.889]  And we've spent around total 16 million fighting them over those years.
[00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.289]  They sued my dad.
[00:44:37.539 --> 00:44:38.480]  He spent $2 million.
[00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:39.960]  He stopped them.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.800]  Everything they said was a lie.
[00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:42.059]  Now we're countersuing them.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:46.159]  So I'm in a war for my future and your future.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.900]  So these are great products.
[00:44:48.139 --> 00:44:49.179]  Shop with the Patriots.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.280]  That's how we win is taking action.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.059]  So do your Christmas shopping at realalexjones.com.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.500]  And I appreciate you all for your support.
[00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:03.139]  That's how we're getting all of this done.
[00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:04.800]  All right.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.260]  Let me recap what I just covered and then get into the big areas we haven't.
[00:45:11.159 --> 00:45:14.380]  So, this is extreme urgency.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.559]  Extreme urgency.
[00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:26.250]  I told you they'd start bombing Russia as soon as President Trump was elected to try to hand him a total disaster.
[00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:27.289]  They now admit that.
[00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.489]  I've already spent weeks covering it, all the clips, all the admissions.
[00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:31.349]  That's not even debatable.
[00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:32.590]  It's mainstream news.
[00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:33.309]  Trump has said it.
[00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.170]  I also broke that Trump behind the scenes is trying to get peace deals and threatening to cut off the money to Zelensky.
[00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.190]  If he didn't come to the peace table, Zelensky didn't.
[00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.150]  And I said Trump will probably pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to cut the funding off.
[00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.429]  That happened Wednesday and got almost no coverage.
[00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.750]  $24 billion killed.
[00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:54.590]  Now Trump's over there meeting with Zelensky at Notre Dame as we speak at the reopening of that.
[00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.010]  So this is massive.
[00:45:58.449 --> 00:45:59.670]  Trump's doing a great job.
[00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.989]  Trump also said we're not getting involved in the Syrian civil war, Turkish invasion.
[00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:07.889]  He said we're not getting involved in any of this.
[00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:08.769]  That's good.
[00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:09.750]  We're bankrupt.
[00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:10.829]  We're on the edge of it.
[00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:13.650]  We need to pull back with the Doge operation.
[00:46:13.889 --> 00:46:16.130]  And I'll get to that again more after I cover this.
[00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.389]  But it's all interconnected.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.440]  The Democrats say Trump's about to kill all the migrants with no evidence.
[00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:23.780]  That's what's going to stage the false flags on him once he gets in.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.639]  That's their other big track.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:33.300]  But we have the spokespersons from the UN, Tedros, Hotez, all of them.
[00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:40.519]  And we're about to play a report that goes through this and show you the clips, saying, oh, don't worry, we're going to stay in charge.
[00:46:40.699 --> 00:46:41.659]  We're going to control the agenda.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:49.059]  There's going to be new lockdowns in already Democrat cities and global-controlled cities around the world and Europe and places in Australia are already trying to bring it back.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.159]  So they got away with it.
[00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:53.780]  Four years ago, people woke up and it backfired.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.119]  They tried again last year.
[00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:15.630]  And now Trump's back in and they're using the same thing they use to take control of the agenda to shut down the economy because they want you totally poor to control every aspect of your life and make you go bankrupt so you'll accept a social credit score, universal basic income, so they control everything you do and control what you do and punish you when you don't do what you're supposed to.
[00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.789]  And that's all out in the open.
[00:47:16.929 --> 00:47:17.389]  That's all admitted.
[00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.570]  China's been under it eight years.
[00:47:19.809 --> 00:47:21.030]  Australia is trying to bring it in.
[00:47:21.809 --> 00:47:24.550]  The internet ID to control everything you do.
[00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.449]  It's all tied to the vaccine passport.
[00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.389]  That's the pretext, the excuse to roll it out.
[00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:28.969]  They admit.
[00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.550]  And they say locking in your houses and arresting political distance is good for the earth.
[00:47:35.909 --> 00:47:38.309]  And we're getting you ready for carbon lockdowns.
[00:47:39.269 --> 00:47:41.449]  I told you about those 20 years ago because it was in their documents.
[00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:42.550]  Now they've done it.
[00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:43.909]  Now they propose it.
[00:47:43.989 --> 00:47:46.190]  If you're a new viewer, and this all sounds crazy, just type in everything I'm saying.
[00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:53.570]  Fauci says, COVID lockdowns, good training for carbon lockdowns.
[00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.989]  John Kerry says, COVID lockdowns, good training for climate lockdowns.
[00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:03.489]  Klaus Schwab says, COVID lockdowns, good training for carbon lockdowns.
[00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:06.250]  It's everywhere.
[00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:09.269]  Just type in what I say, you'll see them saying it.
[00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:12.489]  So, they're not even hiding this.
[00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.690]  They want to train you to be a prisoner.
[00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:19.949]  And what did James O'Keefe get?
[00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:23.909]  Right after people didn't go along with the COVID crap anymore a few years ago?
[00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:30.690]  He got all the CNN executives on Undercover Video, a bunch of them, saying, the next thing is a climate emergency and climate lockdowns.
[00:48:30.789 --> 00:48:31.630]  That's what we're told to hide.
[00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:32.610]  The end of the world that way.
[00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:42.190]  Because they knew they'd already locked down the world, the third world, cut off food production close to half, cut off the fertilizer that killed tens and tens and tens of millions of starvation.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.579]  And then as the world destabilizes, they go, oh, it's global warming.
[00:48:45.639 --> 00:48:47.880]  Oh, it's COVID. No, it was the lockdowns.
[00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:58.760]  Pulling the rug out from under the global economy and then flooding us with the migrants that were refugees from the globalist lockdowns because the IMF and World Bank controlled the third world, wouldn't give them more loans if they didn't do the lockdowns.
[00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:02.739]  Destroy your economy or we won't service your loans, so you then can't pay your loans.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.179]  This is economic warfare.
[00:49:05.179 --> 00:49:05.960]  It's all interconnected.
[00:49:11.149 --> 00:49:13.789]  So, this report is 17 minutes long.
[00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:14.590]  It's excellent.
[00:49:16.289 --> 00:49:18.550]  I'm going to play most of it this hour.
[00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.250]  We're going to go to break and finish it up.
[00:49:21.329 --> 00:49:22.690]  It gets really powerful at the end.
[00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.409]  Everything is documented here.
[00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.730]  And the reason I show you this, I already like TPN News.
[00:49:27.909 --> 00:49:28.869]  I've been watching them for years.
[00:49:28.869 --> 00:49:29.489]  They're excellent.
[00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.210]  They're dead on.
[00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.050]  And they're big, too.
[00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:34.050]  I mean, I like seeing that.
[00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:34.730]  They're getting really big.
[00:49:35.429 --> 00:49:40.190]  And I got up at 5.30 this morning, got some coffee, got on my desktop, and pulled this up.
[00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.570]  And I was already planning to do this show today on this.
[00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.269]  And I said, you know, they did such a great job.
[00:49:45.269 --> 00:49:47.090]  I totally agree with everything they say, word for word.
[00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.329]  These guys are dead on.
[00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:49.949]  I'm just going to play this.
[00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:54.849]  I was already going to find these clips that they show, and then they already had them all.
[00:49:54.909 --> 00:49:56.789]  And I was like, well, I'll just show that.
[00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.690]  So, you know.
[00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:01.059]  So, great job to them.
[00:50:01.219 --> 00:50:05.940]  If you want to see the full report they've got, we're about to play it, but share it just from where they did it.
[00:50:06.199 --> 00:50:18.960]  Go to T-P-V-S-E-A-N and Gates virologists admits elite designing deadly new viruses to cripple Trump presidency.
[00:50:19.159 --> 00:50:20.000]  And they actually say that.
[00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:30.460]  I remember also James O'Keefe got the global head of Pfizer's mRNA program saying, oh, we create the viruses in a lab and we release them and that's how we're going to keep everybody sick and controlling forever.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.820]  And people couldn't believe it.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.179]  They said, that guy doesn't work there.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.860]  And then they look on the website, global head of mRNA.
[00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:43.780]  In fact, I'll find that while we're playing this video and put some stuff up on screen because there's so much when I watch this, I want to, oh, I think of this and that and that and this.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.940]  I mean, it's like, it's not lack of evidence.
[00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:47.440]  It's there's swimming in it.
[00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:48.780]  Don't believe me?
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.489]  You just type into X. That's when he was still at Veritas.
[00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.570]  When I saw that, I said, they're going to fire him or get rid of Veritas, and they did like a month later.
[00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:59.309]  He gets the head of it.
[00:51:00.469 --> 00:51:02.010]  James O'Keefe, the guy's hitting on him.
[00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.789]  James O'Keefe's got fake blonde hair, glasses, like, oh, baby, I'm gay.
[00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:12.070]  And the guy's showing off to him, like, you know, we create the viruses in the lab and release them to control people and erase their immune system, total world government.
[00:51:12.909 --> 00:51:14.590]  And, of course, I don't even need to believe that guy.
[00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.269]  It's in all the documents, but here he is admitting it.
[00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.650]  So type in...
[00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:31.139]  Pfizer's global head of mRNA projects brags about creating new viruses to make money.
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.099]  That's the headline.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.920]  I bet it's word for word.
[00:51:35.019 --> 00:51:37.079]  I remember it from two years ago.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.920]  But the point is that it's in the documents and it's coming out on Fauci.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.380]  That's why they want to give him a pardon now.
[00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:46.789]  Video.
[00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.130]  Yeah, put it back up.
[00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:48.630]  You found it.
[00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:49.010]  Great job.
[00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.289]  Video now blowing up the internet.
[00:51:51.469 --> 00:51:56.710]  Pfizer director on camera saying they will be, are mutating COVID-19 viruses to increase infections.
[00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.710]  Unreal.
[00:51:58.489 --> 00:52:00.690]  This is not what we say.
[00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:04.769]  He goes on, he goes, yeah.
[00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:14.670]  R&D director says Big Pharma is actively mutating COVID-19 flu and calling it Directed evolution, that's gain of function on steroids.
[00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.530]  And there's another headline where he brags they're creating new viruses.
[00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:18.769]  He actually says it in the video.
[00:52:19.329 --> 00:52:20.090]  You know what?
[00:52:20.449 --> 00:52:22.750]  While we're playing this video, this report, get that.
[00:52:22.869 --> 00:52:24.050]  We'll play that next hour too.
[00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.670]  So we got about eight minutes to break.
[00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:28.269]  I'll play half this report now.
[00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:30.789]  Come back and play the other little half.
[00:52:30.909 --> 00:52:32.550]  Then I'll play the Pfizer thing because what's old to do?
[00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:33.590]  People forget about this.
[00:52:34.889 --> 00:52:39.289]  And I mean, people go, that's a deranged lunatic.
[00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.469]  He isn't the global head of Pfizer.
[00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.289]  Yeah, he was.
[00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:46.469]  And again, wasn't hard to predict.
[00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.650]  I bet they shut down Veritas in the next month.
[00:52:48.809 --> 00:52:49.889]  Boom, one month, shut down.
[00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.829]  So this is going down.
[00:52:52.989 --> 00:52:54.809]  And notice they say it's already happening.
[00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.449]  Hotels, the viruses are already here.
[00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:57.130]  It's going to happen.
[00:52:57.349 --> 00:53:06.570]  It's going to come crashing down on Trump because that's when they'll go and point out everybody dying from the COVID shots and say it's this new thing or they may actually release something new.
[00:53:09.279 --> 00:53:30.980]  So, again, I know I keep repeating the same thing because this is going down, folks, and we got to get ahead of it and expose it and say no, no, no to lockdowns and no, no, no to the mask and no, no, no to the new poison shots because they're all going to go to prison because people are awake now and there's criminal investigations and they're trying to get pardons so they backbench Fauci and roll out Hotez and Tedros.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.679]  All right, here's the first part of the report, and then we'll come back in the second hour and get to this, and then get to all the other news.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.059]  Stay with us.
[00:53:39.579 --> 00:53:52.059]  The global elite are reportedly planning to unleash a new wave of deadly viruses, strategically timed to disrupt political events, cripple a potential Trump administration, and further their agenda for total global control.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.199]  According to insiders, they're not just playing God, they're playing politics.
[00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:57.489]  The timing?
[00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:59.110]  Meticulously planned.
[00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:09.789]  They're waiting for Trump's return to the White House, aiming to sow chaos, kill millions, cripple his administration, and pave the way for a one-world government to manage the devastation.
[00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:13.690]  They've proven they can pull off a plandemic, because they've done it before.
[00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.489]  But there's just one problem for the elite.
[00:54:16.909 --> 00:54:19.030]  This time the people are not asleep.
[00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:24.789]  The Covid cabal might think they're untouchable, but there's a reckoning on the horizon.
[00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:29.969]  Don't go anywhere, because we're exposing the players, the plan and what's coming next.
[00:54:30.289 --> 00:54:32.530]  The question isn't if they'll try again.
[00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.530]  The question is, are we ready?

[00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:54.210]  A Bill Gates funded vaccinologist has made a chilling revelation.
[00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:00.130]  The elites are preparing to unleash a new wave of viruses, time to disrupt Donald Trump's return to office.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:16.219]  Dr. Peter Hotez, a close ally of Bill Gates and who directed Dr. Tedros, let slip during an MSNBC appearance that a barrage of new pathogens is coming down the pike as early as January the 21st, the very day after Trump returns to the White House.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.059]  Is this a veiled warning or something even more sinister?
[00:55:20.659 --> 00:55:23.280]  Here's the reason why we need to care about this stuff.
[00:55:23.949 --> 00:55:30.610]  Nicole, is that we have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:34.969]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:40.690]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.050]  It's getting into the poultry.
[00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:44.650]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:47.809]  No human to human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[00:55:47.949 --> 00:55:48.610]  It's in the cattle.
[00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:49.369]  It's in the milk.
[00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:50.769]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:55:50.949 --> 00:55:54.650]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[00:55:54.750 --> 00:56:04.329]  We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2 COVID-19 in 2019. And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.
[00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:06.130]  But there's still more.
[00:56:06.289 --> 00:56:21.289]  We know that we have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas, or expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus, maybe even yellow fever.
[00:56:21.429 --> 00:56:22.289]  And there's more.
[00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:27.190]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[00:56:27.409 --> 00:56:30.710]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:36.639]  Unfortunately for the Covid cabal, the truth is coming down the pike and justice will follow.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:46.820]  Hotez's disturbing comments are reminiscent of Dr. Anthony Fauci's prediction in 2017 that a surprise outbreak would plague the Trump administration during his first term.
[00:56:47.179 --> 00:57:03.619]  There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:24.150]  And I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you will understand why history The history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.
[00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:30.090]  When it comes to bizarre statements that give the game away, this isn't even Dr. Hotez's first rodeo.
[00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:35.550]  In one jaw-dropping moment, he actually admitted that COVID was their warm-up act.
[00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:42.329]  The things that we're talking about today, like COVID-19, H5N1, they're the warm-up act.
[00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:45.280]  You know, Mother Nature's not being coy with us, right?
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.420]  She's telling us, I'm going to hurl a major pandemic at you every few years, and you better get ready.
[00:57:51.559 --> 00:57:55.179]  And by the way, you better convince your population to accept vaccines.
[00:57:55.539 --> 00:58:00.559]  Otherwise, the devastation is going to be unprecedented.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:07.420]  Why does Bill Gates and his inner circle always seem to know about pandemics and disease outbreaks before they happen?
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.139]  What's really going on behind the scenes?
[00:58:10.519 --> 00:58:19.039]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has funneled tens of millions of dollars into Dr Peter Hotez's projects, funding experimental vaccine development.
[00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:26.170]  While padding his own bank accounts, HOTES used this money to create the Corpovax COVID-19 vaccine, which was rolled out in India.
[00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:31.809]  The very country Gates himself openly referred to as his personal laboratory for medical experimentation.
[00:58:32.269 --> 00:58:38.429]  And it's kind of a laboratory to try things that then, once you prove them out in India, you can take to other places.
[00:58:38.429 --> 00:58:56.519]  And so our biggest non-US office for the foundation is in India, and the most number of pilot rollout things we're doing anywhere in the world are with, As more people wake up and reject their fear-driven messaging and endless vaccines,
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.239]  the elite are doubling down.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:06.260]  They're devising new authoritarian strategies to push their latest wave of injectables into our bodies, whether we consent or not.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.239]  Dr. Hotez has positioned himself as a key figure in this disturbing agenda.
[00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:18.219]  He has openly advocated for the use of police and even military forces to combat what the pharmaceutical elite now label as anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:59:18.599 --> 00:59:19.980]  And it doesn't stop there.
[00:59:20.219 --> 00:59:25.559]  They're pushing for NATO to step in, aiming to militarize the next global mRNA vaccine rollout.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.320]  This isn't public health.
[00:59:27.539 --> 00:59:30.219]  It's coercion on an unprecedented scale.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:38.039]  I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[00:59:38.179 --> 00:59:43.539]  We're going to have to bring in Homeland Security, the Commerce Department.
[00:59:43.699 --> 00:59:44.719]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.760]  We're going to come back and back it up to the beginning of hotels.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.659]  We'll back in two minutes.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.539]  This is so critical, folks.
[00:59:50.659 --> 00:59:51.719]  This is such a good report.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.900]  It's only 70 minutes long.
[00:59:53.079 --> 00:59:55.119]  I'm going to repost it on X. You can share that separately.
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:01.039]  Great job to TPV. And then I'm going to finish up with this in about 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:07.019]  Then I'm going to hit the other big tracks, the World War III, huge developments there, Syria, Ukraine, Trump meeting with Zelensky.
[01:00:07.119 --> 01:00:07.900]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.440]  Please remember...
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.179]  It is your funding that keeps us on air as the whole world starts to wake up.

[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.519]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs at TheAlexJonesStore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[01:01:05.659 --> 01:01:07.519]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.920]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[01:01:11.139 --> 01:01:12.280]  Can you hear us now?

[01:01:15.679 --> 01:01:17.739]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:21.300]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:26.400]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[01:01:26.679 --> 01:01:29.079]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[01:01:29.159 --> 01:01:30.539]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:37.250]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head to the right corner of the chart?
[01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:38.929]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.429]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:44.309]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.070]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.289]  If you're blown away by these designs, this is just a few of them.
[01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:51.449]  There's over 200 designs right now at theauctionstore.com.

[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.719]  Ho, ho, ho!
[01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:00.539]  Merry Christmas!
[01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:42.150]  Yes, we are fighting back against the tyrants from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:52.909]  It's Pearl Harbor Day, December 7th, 2024. 43 days out to the inauguration of BJT, the 47th president.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:59.840]  I am your host, Alex Jones, exposing the New World Order agenda before they launch their operations.
[01:03:00.179 --> 01:03:04.300]  And I've been doing that for years predicting what's happening now, but now it's not exposing it before.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:10.039]  They've already launched their plan to bring in UN and NATO troops and arrest anybody that doesn't go along with martial law.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:15.579]  They say they're going to throw Trump out of office using the military after he kills migrants, which they'll do themselves and blame on him.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.699]  We've got their number.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.659]  We've got their ass.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.300]  They're now doing everything I told you months ago they would do.
[01:03:21.059 --> 01:03:24.760]  And people are paying attention because we're not just rolling over.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.519]  We're not sitting here and taking their crap anymore.
[01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:29.820]  We are getting in their faces.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.980]  We're creating the narratives.
[01:03:31.179 --> 01:03:32.019]  We're countering them.
[01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:35.099]  We're destroying them with the truth, and their lives aren't working anymore.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.320]  So yeah, we're winning, but it's still dangerous as hell.
[01:03:38.639 --> 01:03:40.539]  All right, there's about eight minutes left of this.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.159]  Let's play a few more minutes.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.179]  Here it is.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:50.260]  The Biden administration is, the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:58.659]  We're going to have to bring in Homeland Security, the Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.300]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros.
[01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:11.210]  Last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say, I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:22.710]  We need the other United Nations agencies, NATO. This is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:25.369]  200,000 Americans died.
[01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:29.429]  Because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:31.989]  And so this is now a lethal force.
[01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:48.409]  And now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives, the other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:54.840]  Yet Dr. Hotez is terrified of having his pro-vaccine authoritarianism challenged in public.
[01:04:55.239 --> 01:05:02.059]  The Bill Gates ally is on the record stating that anybody criticizing vaccines should be charged with a hate crime.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.280]  Yes, really.
[01:05:03.519 --> 01:05:06.360]  There's a local doctor who's become a household named.
[01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:11.280]  He's been urging people to get COVID vaccines, and he's also developing vaccines.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.800]  We're talking about this man right here, Dr. Peter Hotez.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.860]  And because of his fame, he's also a frequent target for critics.
[01:05:19.019 --> 01:05:24.800]  But should that vaccine criticism or outright threats be classified as a hate crime?
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.980]  Dr. Hotez thinks that option should be on the table.
[01:05:28.199 --> 01:05:35.440]  In an article citing cases involving crimes towards scientists, Hotez in part writes, quote...
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:35.940]  Hit pause.
[01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:36.900]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[01:05:37.179 --> 01:05:39.420]  Some radio stations don't pick up the first six minutes.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.099]  So we have a one-minute break coming up for people watching on X and other places.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:44.780]  Just stay right there.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.659]  But I got to comment on this right now and just back it up to the beginning of that little newscast 20 seconds ago.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.019]  Did you hear the bait and switch?
[01:05:52.159 --> 01:05:54.300]  It's the same with all hate crime thought.
[01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:56.059]  No, if something's a crime, it's a crime.
[01:05:56.750 --> 01:06:00.289]  But if they say it's hateful, well, then it's got more time.
[01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.289]  And then it's been done all over the world.
[01:06:02.409 --> 01:06:02.929]  Now it's here.
[01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:07.389]  Then they go, oh, actually, just hurting my feelings or something is a crime now.
[01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:16.679]  So, he said, should the local news in Houston, should people be able to criticize him or outright make threats?
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.519]  Wait, criticizing isn't a threat.
[01:06:19.519 --> 01:06:23.440]  So, they just conflated criticizing with threats, and then should that be illegal?
[01:06:23.619 --> 01:06:27.659]  Well, the average person sitting there not paying attention goes, well, yeah, making a threat should be illegal.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:33.360]  Should criticism and making a threat be illegal?
[01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.250]  And it's the same with everything.
[01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.329]  Like saying the N-word.
[01:06:37.449 --> 01:06:38.730]  I don't want to say that hurts my feelings.
[01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:40.110]  I don't feel good doing that.
[01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:44.889]  But if you want to call me a white bread, honky, blah, blah, blah, that's fine.
[01:06:44.949 --> 01:06:49.409]  If some bad white person wants to call a black person a name, you know that person's got problems.
[01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:50.190]  That's their problem.
[01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:53.250]  You don't take everybody's rights away because that person said that.
[01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:54.949]  That's why they're trying to ban comedy and stuff.
[01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:58.730]  Look, I know all of you get this, but we have a lot of new viewers that may not.
[01:06:59.309 --> 01:07:01.329]  Our regular viewers knew this without me telling them that.
[01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:02.010]  But...
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.119]  This is all scripted propaganda.
[01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:11.659]  We're going to come back in 60 seconds, a bunch of stations join us, and we're going to get into this because this is just chock full of their New World Order stuff.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:24.739]  But in case you want to just see this full 17-minute report without all my commentary, as soon as I'm off the air in 55 minutes, I'm going to post this to the top of Real Alex Jones and the great folks at TPV. We'll be right back.
[01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:25.440]  Stay with us.
[01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:35.920]  ...claimed for like a week that they owned us.
[01:07:36.059 --> 01:07:39.920]  In fact, as of this taping, they're still claiming that they own us on several other platforms.
[01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:40.760]  They don't.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:46.179]  And even if they did, TheAlexJonesStore.com is immune to their attacks because it's not owned by us.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.800]  It's simply partnered with us.

[01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.569]  Thank you.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:48.159]  Oh, I'm afraid this battle station will be fully operational when your friends arrive.
[01:08:51.619 --> 01:08:57.420]  You can take a mortal man and put him in control.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.560]  You know what happens to the tyrants, though, in the end?
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.939]  It's their heads that roll.
[01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:45.409]  But we are not going to kill any of these globalists, extra-judicially.
[01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:47.909]  We are going to expose them.
[01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:49.090]  We're going to take our governments back.
[01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.810]  We're going to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over the Health and Human Services.
[01:09:51.989 --> 01:09:54.329]  And then we're going to indict them!
[01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.149]  And then they're going to get convicted!
[01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:00.189]  And then they're going to go to Supermax prisons!
[01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:05.590]  Because they killed a lot more people than Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber!
[01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.850]  Before his head explodes!
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.439]  You want a war?
[01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:25.399]  You got one!
[01:10:28.939 --> 01:10:36.560]  The loveless thing fuck over my family made me back off?
[01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.140]  It made me turn it on!
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.899]  And every day, the spirit gets stronger, and you get weaker!
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:49.760]  Swing!
[01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:00.710]  All right, let's get into the hardcore news right now.
[01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:08.970]  So, oh, hotels, we need the UN, we need NATO, we need Homeland Security, arrest everyone that doesn't agree, take poison shots, stay in your home forever.
[01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.430]  My daughter's autistic, but it wasn't the shots that did it.
[01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:15.090]  It wasn't a viral infection in the shot that ate her brain.
[01:11:15.829 --> 01:11:16.970]  You know, it's in all the documents.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.960]  No, no, no.
[01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.899]  Take it, take it, take it.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.899]  I want to arrest you.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:30.020]  And then they're like, Dr. Hotez wants people arrested that criticize him and or threaten him.
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:30.619]  They mix the two.
[01:11:30.739 --> 01:11:31.800]  Criticism is totally legal.
[01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:40.270]  So, they're predators.
[01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:47.270]  He has the same little ferret-like, weasel-like look that a weasel has when it's sneaking up on a chicken in the coop.
[01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.489]  So, we know who these mad scientists are.
[01:11:52.569 --> 01:11:54.270]  We know who Joseph Mingla was.
[01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:55.909]  We know the archetype.
[01:11:57.229 --> 01:12:00.529]  I mean, you know, it's a well-known archetype, which is based in reality.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:08.699]  How many horror movies is, you know, people's car breaks down on a country road, they go to a mansion, it's a weird laboratory run by psychotic scientists.
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:13.779]  I mean, this is, this is, this is, that's all the island of Dr. Maru, all that's based on me.
[01:12:13.859 --> 01:12:15.079]  Look at these loon bats.
[01:12:17.039 --> 01:12:18.020]  Take a shot!
[01:12:19.979 --> 01:12:23.520]  Oh, he'll be, it's gonna crash down on him, all the new viruses in the ass.
[01:12:25.159 --> 01:12:26.899]  Oh, the shots work quite well.
[01:12:27.539 --> 01:12:28.560]  What shot should I take?
[01:12:28.579 --> 01:12:31.260]  Oh, they all 100% protect you, can't spread it, can't get it.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.840]  He knew that was all he said that years after it was all confirmed to be lying.
[01:12:35.899 --> 01:12:37.760]  We said it before it even came out because we knew their plan.
[01:12:38.079 --> 01:12:40.720]  We knew when they cooked it up what it was, long-term program.
[01:12:41.119 --> 01:12:45.140]  I was exposing this damn COVID shot back in 2014. It was a huge national scandal.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.100]  It was illegal to be producing it at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[01:12:49.359 --> 01:12:58.739]  But I want to show you, the head of Pfizer's global mRNA vaccine program say, oh, God, we're cooking up mutinogenic viruses to have all these new ones to keep everybody sick and control them.
[01:12:58.859 --> 01:13:00.600]  We're going to make so much money!
[01:13:02.119 --> 01:13:03.640]  I'm going to show you that in a few minutes.
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.140]  But let's go back here.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.760]  They're trying to run COVID 2.0 on us.
[01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:12.340]  As Bill Gates said then, there'll be new viruses.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:12.779]  You'll see.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.399]  The next one will target your children.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.300]  You'll really learn to do what I think then.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.380]  When I'm not at Jeffrey Epstein's Island, that is.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:28.060]  When my foundation calls for depopulating you, but I really want you to take this shot while I release mutinogenic mosquitoes on you because I want you to live.
[01:13:28.199 --> 01:13:29.439]  But I do want to kill grandma with...
[01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:32.069]  Euthanasia because it's good for the earth?
[01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:33.789]  I mean, but I want to give you a shot, though.
[01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:36.069]  Just type in the search engine.
[01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:40.770]  Number one cause of polio worldwide is the polio vaccine, AP Reuters.
[01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.090]  And when you read the article, who funds it?
[01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.630]  Bill Gates.
[01:13:43.789 --> 01:13:44.050]  Wow!
[01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.609]  So, let's finish up with this report.
[01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:51.949]  Go ahead.
[01:13:53.039 --> 01:13:54.520]  It's become a household name.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.420]  He's been urging people to get COVID vaccines, and he's also developing vaccines.
[01:13:59.659 --> 01:14:02.939]  We're talking about this man right here, Dr. Peter Hotez.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.960]  And because of his fame, he's also a frequent target for critics.
[01:14:07.119 --> 01:14:12.920]  But should that vaccine criticism or outright threats be classified as a hate crime?
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.079]  Dr. Hotez thinks that option should be on the table.
[01:14:16.449 --> 01:14:27.949]  In an article citing cases involving crimes towards scientists, Hotez in part writes, quote, we should look at expanded protection mechanisms for scientists currently targeted by far-right extremism in the United States.
[01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:33.789]  He goes on to say another possibility is to extend federal hate crime protections, end quote.
[01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:39.909]  Hotez tweeted that his level of hate emails is up, some including Nazi images and threats.
[01:14:40.779 --> 01:14:45.020]  The pro-vaccine elite do not like criticism, and they don't like public debate.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:55.819]  Joe Rogan invited Hotes to appear on his podcast to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine controversy with RFK Jr., who has been exposing the truth about the vaccine since it was first rolled out.
[01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:04.050]  The exchange began over Hotez promoting a Vice article that called on Spotify to censor Rogan's podcast whenever he dares to question the official narrative.
[01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:14.130]  Once Rogan caught wind of what Hotez tweeted, he replied to him by offering to donate $100,000 to a charity of Hotez's choice if he would debate RFK Jr. on his show.
[01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:24.390]  Peter, if you claim what RFK Jr. is saying is misinformation, I'm offering you $100,000 to the charity of your choice if you're willing to debate him on my show with no time limit.
[01:15:24.609 --> 01:15:25.409]  Rogan tweeted.
[01:15:25.789 --> 01:15:28.890]  Hotez replied to Rogan, but did not agree to a debate.
[01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:35.250]  Things escalated quickly once Elon Musk jumped into the exchange, saying that Hotez is afraid to debate in public.
[01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:41.329]  Following Musk's tweet, Bill Ackman replied, adding another $150,000 to Rogan's wager.
[01:15:41.569 --> 01:15:47.109]  So $250,000 could have gone to charity and the public could have heard an open debate.
[01:15:47.569 --> 01:15:56.789]  And yet Hotez, who wants to use the military to round up on forced jab vaccine refusers, still refuse to debate RFK Jr. on the topic of COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:05.930]  Why are these far-left authoritarians so confident in calling for an end to medical freedom and liberty in the US, yet terrified to have their ideas examined in public?
[01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:14.890]  According to a Health and Human Services whistleblower, it's because they know the global elite are making moves behind the scenes to eradicate the freedom to dissent once and for all.
[01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:18.430]  We've got all the details after this important message from our sponsor.
[01:16:20.929 --> 01:16:23.430]  Today's sponsor is PillsForever.com.
[01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:26.949]  If you think big pharma have your best interests at heart, think again.
[01:16:27.369 --> 01:16:33.630]  Under Biden, the price of medicine in America has skyrocketed, and there are certain medicines big pharma don't want you to know about.
[01:16:33.949 --> 01:16:36.630]  That's why I've partnered with PillsForever.com.
[01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:40.300]  All of their FDA-approved medicines are the cheapest you'll find anywhere.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.479]  More importantly, you can order medicines that Big Pharma don't want you to have, such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and fenbendazole.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:56.439]  Speaking of fenbendazole, not only does it get rid of parasites that live inside your body, there have been studies that show fenbendazole can help with cancer.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:02.180]  Listen to this testimony of Joe Tippins, a cancer survivor, thanks to fenbendazole.
[01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:08.250]  Two years ago, Joe Tippin says he was told to go home, call hospice, and say his goodbyes.
[01:17:08.369 --> 01:17:13.010]  The doctors were unanimous he was going to die of small cell lung cancer.
[01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:20.909]  Once that kind of cancer goes that far afield, the odds of survival are less than 1%, and the median life expectancy is three months.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:24.920]  Tippin says he got a tip, not from a pharmacist, but a veterinarian.
[01:17:25.119 --> 01:17:31.899]  And in his desperation, he turned from people medicine to dog medicine, specifically Fimbindazole.
[01:17:31.979 --> 01:17:40.859]  My insurance company spent $1.2 million on me, with traditional means, before I switched to a $5 a week medicine that actually saved me.

[01:17:55.779 --> 01:18:04.380]  Rounding up millions of vaccine sceptics and dissenters against the globalist agenda might sound far-fetched, until you realise the groundwork has already been laid.
[01:18:04.619 --> 01:18:15.659]  A whistleblower from the Department of Health and Human Services has come forward, revealing that the US government, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, is constructing secret detention facilities across all 50 states.
[01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:21.750]  These compounds, reportedly designed to hold millions, are located in remote, tightly controlled areas.
[01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:25.850]  According to Christy Hutchison, these sites are not just theoretical.
[01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:35.670]  They're intended to detain those who resist compliance with upcoming government mandates, including long-term lockdowns and new vaccine requirements for the next plandemic.
[01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.729]  It's not for these illegals.
[01:18:39.109 --> 01:18:42.189]  Especially, let's go off the numbers that they're telling us that they really are.
[01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:43.529]  They're saying, what, 11 million?
[01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:56.810]  In reality, I can tell you right now, with talking to all of the agents that I've talked to, private sector, looking at the cameras and all the real data, we're over 30-plus million who've actually entered this country.
[01:18:57.369 --> 01:19:16.760]  And so, even with that, even though that's enough to replace about 36 states' population, Why would they need to continue to do that if they're trying to absorb these guys, make them productive members of our society, get them into housing, because we know that they're already housing projects being coordinated with builders,
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.960]  again with our money.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:27.840]  I believe it's to, kind of like what Nazis did with the Jews, concentration camps, processing facilities.
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.880]  They're going to need somewhere to process the dissidents.
[01:19:31.789 --> 01:19:46.550]  For decades, the global elite have operated in plain sight, committing unspeakable acts with total impunity, experimenting on vulnerable children, orchestrating a vaccine rollout tied to millions of deaths, and pushing a dark agenda of eugenics and depopulation.
[01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.590]  But the tide is turning.
[01:19:48.989 --> 01:19:52.649]  People are waking up rejecting their narrative and demanding accountability.
[01:19:53.319 --> 01:19:58.699]  Now, in a groundbreaking move, a courageous judge in the Netherlands has ordered Bill Gates to stand trial.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.739]  And Gates, he's terrified.
[01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:01.979]  How do we know?
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:14.939]  Because Gates begged the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that if he's held to justice in the Netherlands, there will be a contagion effect, his words, and the rest of the world will demand that he is brought to justice for crimes against humanity.
[01:20:15.439 --> 01:20:22.100]  Another article about Bill Gates came out today that said he has just been indicted.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:38.140]  He's been indicted in the Netherlands for lying to the public about the COVID vaccine.
[01:20:48.859 --> 01:20:50.779]  And he's going to have to go to trial.
[01:20:54.159 --> 01:20:58.920]  You think that he wants to go to trial here in the United States of America?
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:07.539]  You think maybe that's one of the reasons he chose to give $50 million to Kamala Harris?
[01:21:10.659 --> 01:21:22.880]  By collaborating with Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum and taking orders from Bill Gates and the World Health Organization, the globalist Biden-Harris administration sold their salt to the New World Order, and they are lying to our faces about everything.
[01:21:23.319 --> 01:21:28.060]  Orwell warned us that the elite would try and convince us that up is down, men are women, and war is peace.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.260]  How right he was.
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:35.159]  Dr. Hotez must be held accountable next for his role in misleading the public about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:21:35.699 --> 01:21:37.260]  The evidence is undeniable.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.300]  And it's time this shameless propagandist faces justice for the blood on his hands.
[01:21:42.579 --> 01:21:45.039]  It's usually a 10 to 25 year time frame.
[01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:52.159]  People forget how long it really takes to develop an effective and safe vaccine and do all the adequate clinical testing.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:59.180]  The current record for developing a vaccine from start to licensure in the United States is around three or four years.
[01:21:59.449 --> 01:22:03.470]  So that's the realistic timeframe we have to start thinking about.
[01:22:03.609 --> 01:22:11.670]  When you look at the timelines of coronavirus, this COVID-19 vaccines, it really follows the same progression as almost any other vaccine.
[01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:19.390]  The vaccine development cycle for COVID-19 vaccines very much goes along with what we've seen before.
[01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:22.770]  And there are some variances, but modest.
[01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:28.949]  And I think that's an important story for people to know if they're concerned about taking COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:37.710]  Join us in our mission to wake up the masses by subscribing to the channel and joining the People's Voice Locals community to join our amazing team.
[01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:39.329]  I hope to see you there.
[01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:43.829]  Today's video is brought to you by IPv6ers.
[01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:50.729]  Are you a content creator who wants to publish information online without Big Brother spying and censoring your every move?
[01:22:51.430 --> 01:23:03.369]  IPv6ers are set to revolutionize the way information is disseminated on the internet by eliminating the need for big tech companies to provide unreliable, overpriced services such as self-hosting, email and data management.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.760]  All right, great job to those guys.
[01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:17.399]  I'll post their full report after the live show's done on Real Alex Jones on X. And be sure and follow us at Real Alex Jones on X and at AJNLive for the Alex Jones Network and AlexJones.network.
[01:23:17.979 --> 01:23:23.539]  If they shut down InfoWars, obviously we'll populate the sites with news and the articles, the videos, the whole team will move over to that.
[01:23:24.159 --> 01:23:25.439]  We've got this as a backup here.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.520]  We're going to use it regardless.
[01:23:26.859 --> 01:23:28.699]  So your support is absolutely vital.
[01:23:28.819 --> 01:23:32.739]  I want to thank you all for supporting our sponsor, and that is realalexjones.com.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:44.720]  That's some of the great folks at Bigly with all of the great supplements, Patriot t-shirts, and a lot of great little Christmas specialties as well, like Trump on a stump that's about to sell out, and the collectible silver coins, challenge coins, and more at realalexjones.com.
[01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:45.460]  But enough of that.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:24:00.260]  While I'm watching all of this, I just start thinking about all the clips of Fauci and Tedros and Pfizer executives, Borla, saying they want to lock us up and make us take shots during the next lockdown.
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.739]  New York's trying to pass laws to do it.
[01:24:01.859 --> 01:24:02.899]  A bunch of European countries have.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.920]  Canada is banning all the guns and announcing, you know, martial law, lockdown plans coming.
[01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:09.560]  I mean, they're still going to try all this.
[01:24:09.699 --> 01:24:12.100]  The good news is most people said they're not going along with it.
[01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:18.789]  So, I've just spent an hour and 21 minutes today in this emergency live Saturday show.
[01:24:18.909 --> 01:24:24.010]  It's 321 Central, 421 Eastern, 221 Mountain, 121 Pacific.
[01:24:24.909 --> 01:24:25.810]  I'm not going to give you a grin.
[01:24:25.909 --> 01:24:26.890]  I mean, Tommy, look it up if you want.
[01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:30.829]  They're doing it.
[01:24:30.989 --> 01:24:31.710]  They're trying it.
[01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:34.470]  The fear of the hype is worse than it was during COVID. It's not working.
[01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:38.109]  So the good news is that we just keep exposing it and speaking out.
[01:24:38.289 --> 01:24:40.350]  I think Trump's going to get his agenda through.
[01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:43.470]  I think we're going to be able to turn things around.
[01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:59.470]  And at the end of this hour, I'm going to do just a brief explanation of the Trump-Elon Musk vision that I understand very well, that's very similar to my worldview that I've been putting out for 30 years, versus the globalist worldview and why the globalists are so angry.
[01:25:00.569 --> 01:25:01.250]  And this is critical.
[01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:05.229]  So that's coming up the last few minutes of this hour in about 30 minutes from now.
[01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:15.210]  But I want to play one of the clips I mentioned, you know, just like I told the crew, hey, just type in most polio caused by vaccine worldwide, AP Reuters.
[01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:16.529]  And you look into it, it's Bill Gates.
[01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.989]  Okay, there it is.
[01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:21.550]  I mean, just anything I'm saying, you can look it up.
[01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:22.210]  All right.
[01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:29.029]  But what I mentioned earlier, The head director of Pfizer Global mRNA quote vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.930]  They changed the definition.
[01:25:31.029 --> 01:25:33.510]  That's a clip of better play because that doesn't get the attention it deserves.
[01:25:33.689 --> 01:25:38.789]  I mean, yeah, it got 100 million views or so last time I checked on X when it broke two years ago.
[01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:43.369]  But then they, you know, got rid of Project Veritas trying to stop James O'Keefe.
[01:25:43.489 --> 01:25:43.970]  That didn't work.
[01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:45.930]  He's just O'Keefe Media Group.
[01:25:46.029 --> 01:25:47.909]  Just like if they shut down InfoWars, that's not going to work.
[01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:49.390]  We're just going to get beggars.
[01:25:49.489 --> 01:25:50.489]  People know the Streisand effect.
[01:25:50.609 --> 01:25:51.210]  They don't want you to have it.
[01:25:51.289 --> 01:25:57.800]  But InfoWars is a great studio, great website, and the bad guys tried to steal it with their fake auction.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.460]  They got caught.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.739]  And people don't want us to just roll over and give in to them, so we're fighting them hard.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.220]  And I'll give you an update on that, big developments as well.
[01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:19.890]  But let's go ahead, since I mentioned the global head of Pfizer's mRNA program, Jordan Tristan Walker, And here he is.
[01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:25.569]  And again, there's an hour-long Veritas video of this.
[01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:27.270]  It was a 15-minute boil down.
[01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:28.710]  I'm just going to play a few minutes of this.
[01:26:28.829 --> 01:26:35.710]  But if you're a new viewer and you didn't see this, our biggest problem as patriots is we have too much proof.
[01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:44.350]  And there's always news, so the most bombshell stuff, and there's thousands of those just on COVID, we just go past, like the FDA document.
[01:26:46.590 --> 01:27:02.390]  October 20th, 2020. And they published on their site saying, we predict these COVID mRNA shots will cause heart attacks, myocarditis, strokes, turbo cancers, infertility, autoimmune disorders, VAIDS, vaccine-induced AIDS. This is what it is,
[01:27:02.449 --> 01:27:05.750]  is the spike protein of AIDS. That's what actually knocks out the white blood cells.
[01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:09.729]  And that's pretty big.
[01:27:09.869 --> 01:27:12.930]  But I watch all the other talk show hosts who are great.
[01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:14.909]  They don't go back.
[01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:18.569]  I mean, that's what TPV did in the 70-minute report you just saw.
[01:27:18.729 --> 01:27:23.510]  They just showed you a snapshot of the last month, and not even all of it, which I haven't done either.
[01:27:23.569 --> 01:27:24.189]  It's impossible.
[01:27:25.069 --> 01:27:29.409]  So these guys know what they're doing, because that's what I do, is I don't just show you, here's this one new thing.
[01:27:29.409 --> 01:27:31.550]  I go, here's 30 examples where they did it.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.960]  So we're going to stop them together, but this is so important.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:39.460]  And there are millions already watching on X. Great job, everybody.
[01:27:39.699 --> 01:27:43.720]  Sharing the feeds from Alex Jones, from AJN Live, and from M4s.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.079]  Great job.
[01:27:44.239 --> 01:27:47.680]  We'll have a current rate of these streams, I would imagine.
[01:27:48.319 --> 01:27:49.279]  Let's be conservative.
[01:27:49.579 --> 01:28:01.140]  When I go live tomorrow night at 4 p.m., I would predict that, and Saturday shows aren't as big, obviously, as weekday, but every million people is precious.
[01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:06.850]  I bet we got 10 million views just on a live feed by tomorrow.
[01:28:07.489 --> 01:28:11.670]  It's already a million or so on there, but it'll be 10, maybe 20 million.
[01:28:11.829 --> 01:28:12.590]  I mean, very conservative.
[01:28:13.069 --> 01:28:18.550]  We routinely have shows on X now that get, between the streams, 80 million views.
[01:28:18.729 --> 01:28:20.689]  One got 120 million a few weeks ago.
[01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:24.149]  Well, hell, election night got 280 million.
[01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.590]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:28.670]  Well, and again, it shows how the awakening is there.
[01:28:28.789 --> 01:28:29.689]  People want to know the truth.
[01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:34.609]  I mean, Elon Musk Interviewed Trump, had a billion.
[01:28:34.829 --> 01:28:37.310]  He goes and does stuff, you know, the average interview, 200 million.
[01:28:37.489 --> 01:28:39.270]  I mean, he's the king, Matt, on it.
[01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:41.069]  And by the way, people say, well, is he for real?
[01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.430]  Is he good?
[01:28:42.069 --> 01:28:44.510]  He's causing irrevocable damage to the New World Order.
[01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:45.250]  Of course he's real.
[01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:47.369]  Here's a few minutes of the Project Veritas report.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.979]  Pfizer ultimately is thinking about mutating COVID? Well, that is not what we say to the public.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:55.619]  No.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.760]  Don't tell anyone what that's going on.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.840]  We're exploring, like, you know how the virus keeps mutating?
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.279]  Yeah.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:08.819]  Well, one of the things we're exploring is, like, why don't we just mutate it ourselves so we can create unbelievably developed new vaccines, right?
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:09.840]  So we have to do that.
[01:29:09.939 --> 01:29:17.020]  If we're going to do that, though, there's a risk of, like, as you could imagine, no one wants to be having a pharma company mutating f***ing virus to save.
[01:29:29.949 --> 01:29:39.369]  Meet Jordan Tristan Walker, a Director of Research and Development Strategic Operations and mRNA Scientific Planning at Pfizer.
[01:29:39.529 --> 01:29:41.430]  It sounds like gain-of-function to me.
[01:29:42.989 --> 01:29:43.369]  I don't know.
[01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.949]  It's a little bit different.
[01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:44.609]  I think it's different.
[01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:47.829]  It's definitely not gain-of-function.
[01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:48.850]  It sounds like it is.
[01:29:48.949 --> 01:29:49.510]  I mean, it's okay.
[01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:51.449]  No, no, no, no.
[01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:53.470]  Directed evolution is very different.
[01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:56.750]  Well, you're not supposed to do gain-of-function research of the viruses.
[01:29:57.409 --> 01:29:58.270]  You'd rather not.
[01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:02.689]  But you do these selected, directional mutations to try to see if they can be more potent.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:03.279]  Yeah.
[01:30:03.739 --> 01:30:05.880]  So there is research on the way about that.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.079]  I don't know how that's got to work.
[01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.359]  There better not be any more outbreaks to think Jesus Christ.
[01:30:09.619 --> 01:30:15.520]  The gentleman seems to have absolutely no moral compass at all.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.800]  It's a revolving door for all government officials.
[01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.899]  It's pretty good for the industry to be honest.
[01:30:20.319 --> 01:30:20.479]  Yeah.
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.859]  It's bad for everyone else in America.
[01:30:23.239 --> 01:30:25.119]  Why is it bad for everybody else?
[01:30:25.359 --> 01:30:41.880]  If this is the quality of individuals within Pfizer that are making these huge decisions that risk global public health...
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.760]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:30:43.079 --> 01:30:53.659]  So directed evolution, making more viruses, you know, he says in the full report, as you just heard part of it, to keep making money, to keep having new strains, that is gain-of-function.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:31:04.520]  And of course, it came out in the documents, that's exactly what they were doing at the Wuhan lab and the University of Texas, Galveston, and at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and other places.
[01:31:04.819 --> 01:31:06.260]  Also over in Ukraine.
[01:31:07.119 --> 01:31:08.340]  And that's why they want...
[01:31:09.729 --> 01:31:10.810]  Pardons for Fauci.
[01:31:11.029 --> 01:31:13.149]  Biden about to pardon Fauci.
[01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:18.449]  They're getting everybody ready for that because they know Trump's coming, we're coming, RFK Jr.'s coming.
[01:31:18.729 --> 01:31:23.250]  We'll come right back, finish up with us, get to the other big news here on this emergency.
[01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:24.949]  Saturday, live transmission.
[01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:26.970]  Share the live feed now from Merrill Alex Jones.
[01:31:27.170 --> 01:31:28.109]  Share it, share it, share it.
[01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:29.270]  That's how we have victory.
[01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:36.350]  Christmas ornaments, drywall and Jerry Epstein.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.539]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.819]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:31:43.199 --> 01:31:46.359]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:49.439]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.439]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:32:16.300]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking And so much more has happened.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.319]  This is an exciting time.
[01:32:17.979 --> 01:32:19.520]  The globalists are striking back.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.600]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:32:23.739 --> 01:32:25.600]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:26.560]  So we make it easy.

[01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:53.909]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:32:53.909 --> 01:32:55.229]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:57.050]  And this will horrify.
[01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:02.789]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall shaking in fear when you walk down the street and say, it's okay.
[01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.710]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like him.
[01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:07.890]  Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:14.449]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.

[01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:26.810]  I'd heard about CMOS being a superfood, our CMOS namely, but the folks immediately say, you're recommending all these supplements and that's great.

[01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:46.789]  And I looked at it and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:48.750]  But it does other effects than hemp.

[01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:17.050]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:19.489]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump in the fight.
[01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:20.770]  God bless and good luck.
[01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:22.409]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:35:23.409 --> 01:35:25.310]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:35:25.489 --> 01:35:28.350]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:32.050]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:54.609]  Nothing moves.
[01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:00.909]  Finally, nothing moves.
[01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:07.850]  High noon, black dot rolling below the asphalt dry, dry.
[01:36:08.369 --> 01:36:15.289]  A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing, nothing.
[01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:38.390]  Finally, nothing moves.
[01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:45.250]  High noon, black dot rolling below the asphalt, dry, dry.
[01:36:45.829 --> 01:36:53.449]  A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing, nothing, nothing.
[01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:17.109]  You know, a lot of people tune in and they go, man, this guy is a maniac.
[01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:22.489]  Well, I've been on the air 30 and a half, almost 31 years.
[01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:24.010]  In April, it'll be 31 years.
[01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:41.069]  Since I was 20 years old, I'm almost 51. And I was reading globalist books written by former Secretary of State and U.S. Senators and world leaders announcing this horrible world government,
[01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:45.630]  everything run by a big computer, cutting off resources, exterminating most of the people.
[01:37:45.729 --> 01:37:46.829]  We never know what hit us.
[01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:53.350]  All these top leftist philosophers, Bertrand Russell in the 40s saying, we'll put poison in the shots, you'll never know what hit you.
[01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:56.789]  Aldous Huxley saying, brave new world is actually what we're planning to do.
[01:37:56.869 --> 01:37:58.909]  My brother runs the U.N., Julian Huxley.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:06.920]  And how I went back to Malthus and Plato and their plan and this cult.
[01:38:08.479 --> 01:38:12.960]  And I was, you know, hardcore serious and really focused, and I've been.
[01:38:13.079 --> 01:38:24.399]  But now, through the hell we've all been through, and 30 million dead from their shots and trying to start World War III, I get really excited when they're being exposed everywhere.
[01:38:25.939 --> 01:38:31.609]  And they hate my guts and Because I'm standing up for you and I'm standing up for myself.
[01:38:31.789 --> 01:38:32.250]  We're all in this together.
[01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:38.810]  And so, as Trump said a million times, I'll say it again, they're not trying to get him.
[01:38:38.909 --> 01:38:39.689]  They're not trying to get me.
[01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:41.630]  He said they got to get through me to get to you.
[01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:42.369]  I'm standing in the way.
[01:38:42.489 --> 01:38:44.250]  Well, that's exactly what this broadcast is.
[01:38:44.449 --> 01:38:48.970]  And I am so honored to have taken really the third...
[01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:50.430]  Well, I mean, they hate...
[01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:51.949]  The globalists hate Putin too because he won't go along with them.
[01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:57.369]  But, I mean, they hate Trump the most and then Putin and then Elon Musk and then me.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.119]  I mean, ROK Jr. is a close, close fourth as well.
[01:39:02.279 --> 01:39:05.500]  I mean, it's like John Hancock signed his name the biggest.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.920]  And they said, why'd you do that?
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.939]  And he's like, well, they're going to come try to kill me and my family.
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.819]  I might as well have the biggest signature on my death warrant.
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:14.260]  I mean, if you're going to go big, go big, baby.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.340]  You got to be all in in a fight.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.560]  So I'm pissed off.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.119]  I'm angry.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:22.760]  I'm upset.
[01:39:23.579 --> 01:39:26.079]  But I'm not going to let the globalists depress me.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.460]  And I've got that side of me, the war joy, battle joy.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.680]  I forget the Nordic word for it.
[01:39:34.739 --> 01:39:42.079]  Can we look up the Nordic word for war joy, battle joy?
[01:39:43.239 --> 01:39:48.000]  The Norwegian word for the joy of battle.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.199]  I'd like to read that on there.
[01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:50.840]  I'll probably butcher it.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.100]  But the point is, I'm not looking for a fight.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.170]  I wish we didn't have to do this, but These people want one, they got one.
[01:39:58.310 --> 01:40:01.270]  And they're attacking us and we're going to destroy them with the truth.
[01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:02.050]  They're totally evil.
[01:40:02.289 --> 01:40:08.149]  They thought their plan was so evil, people couldn't get their mind around it and we would just be dumbfounded and God smacked by it.
[01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.489]  And a lot of people have been, but not anymore.
[01:40:11.489 --> 01:40:13.109]  People realize, wow, this is really going down.
[01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:14.689]  It only gets worse if I live in an aisle.
[01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:17.750]  Things only get more horrible if I don't face the facts and do something about it.
[01:40:18.850 --> 01:40:22.630]  And all I got to do is not comply with them and speak out against them and support people that fight them.
[01:40:24.189 --> 01:40:31.810]  I mean, when you commission me to be on air, risking my life and my families, we're already going to lose everything anyway, so we're happy to do it.
[01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:36.350]  You are commissioning a maniac.
[01:40:37.789 --> 01:40:41.409]  And if you study history, the patriots and the good guys are the real maniacs.
[01:40:41.649 --> 01:40:42.729]  We're the badasses.
[01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:43.729]  We're the smart people.
[01:40:43.869 --> 01:40:46.789]  We're the people that go all day long and all night long in a war.
[01:40:47.409 --> 01:40:51.729]  But when we're in a big happy America and lots of movies and ball games, we're told everything's fine.
[01:40:51.789 --> 01:40:53.010]  We never wake up.
[01:40:54.310 --> 01:41:05.529]  So these little creeps like Hotez and Tedros and Bill Gates and Fauci can creep around and kill us covertly like little passive-aggressive Satanists.
[01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:07.569]  Well, guess what?
[01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:09.470]  We know what you've been doing!
[01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:16.050]  And I can guarantee you no matter what you pull, even if you launch a nuclear war, you're going to get dug out of your bunkers.
[01:41:18.119 --> 01:41:22.380]  And that's why I have a giant stack of more leftist capitulating to the liberty movement.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.659]  And I'll spend a few minutes on this at the end and explain philosophies here.
[01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:29.060]  It's always good to put the preface at least up front or at the end.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:36.260]  So, I want to be with team humanity with the red-blooded people that are ready to stand up for themselves.
[01:41:37.039 --> 01:41:41.039]  Like Zapata said, I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees as a slave.
[01:41:41.159 --> 01:41:45.119]  But I've been around and I've studied history and I'm street smart and I'm book smart.
[01:41:47.279 --> 01:41:48.840]  And I got Holy Ghost fire.
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:55.699]  And I'm here to tell you, you live on your feet, you die on your knees.
[01:41:56.539 --> 01:41:57.520]  That's the big trick.
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:00.659]  Really, you die on your feet, huh?
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.600]  Yeah, well, you statistically get run over and enslaved and killed a lot more often when you are on your knees.
[01:42:08.119 --> 01:42:10.359]  If you think about that, you go, yeah, that's not even a true statement.
[01:42:10.659 --> 01:42:11.579]  I mean, it's a true statement.
[01:42:11.619 --> 01:42:13.159]  He'd rather die on his feet than live on his knees.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.180]  I mean, of course, I would too.
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:16.140]  But what I'm saying is, take it further.
[01:42:17.859 --> 01:42:19.479]  Living on your knees ain't living.
[01:42:19.939 --> 01:42:22.539]  And I'm not living on my knees to these people.
[01:42:23.239 --> 01:42:27.739]  And they've attacked us and declared war on us, and we have accepted the challenge.
[01:42:28.779 --> 01:42:35.420]  And it feels good to not roll over to these people and to start tasting victory.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:39.000]  So I'm going to hit the rest of the news here in the 20 minutes we have left.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:39.859]  There's a lot of it.
[01:42:40.939 --> 01:42:44.020]  I have a tendency to hit one giant topic and belabor it, and then not hit the others.
[01:42:44.899 --> 01:42:51.359]  But let me just say again, you see us run these ads for the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.119]  It's on with the great folks at Bigly.
[01:42:53.319 --> 01:42:54.300]  It's not owned by InfoWars.
[01:42:54.399 --> 01:42:55.760]  If they shut down InfoWars, they can't get it.
[01:42:56.119 --> 01:43:00.880]  You support there, the great products, the supplements, the Patriot gear, the great limited edition Christmas gifts.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:20.090]  It funds InfoWars and the AJ Network, AJN. But If you go to the same shopping cart owned by those folks at realalexjones.com, all of the funding goes to the AJN network and the legal defense.
[01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:36.869]  So it's the very same products, the same prices, the same people, the same shopping cart, the same system, but all of the money, other than what goes to our sponsor and partner, the partner in fighting the tyranny, but they own it,
[01:43:36.909 --> 01:43:39.810]  they run it, Goes to this operation.
[01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:52.609]  And so instead of us getting, you know, six bucks on a t-shirt, we see the average t-shirt costs about 16 bucks, selling for like 25, 30. Some of them are marked up as fundraiser shirts.
[01:43:52.949 --> 01:43:56.050]  You pay more if you want to help us, you know, classic limited edition shirts.
[01:43:57.930 --> 01:44:00.949]  You know, instead of making five, six bucks, we make, you know, 10, 12 bucks.
[01:44:01.069 --> 01:44:04.930]  I mean, that, that, that, that, that, so, and it's the same thing with the Trump on a stump.
[01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:09.079]  When I saw this Friday morning that they had it up on the store, They're up in Arkansas.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:10.060]  I was like, mail me some immediately.
[01:44:10.479 --> 01:44:12.720]  Because my daughter loves them, you know, all for the shelf, all that.
[01:44:12.819 --> 01:44:13.899]  I said, oh, this is going to...
[01:44:13.899 --> 01:44:15.640]  I said, call them and see how many they got.
[01:44:17.039 --> 01:44:18.359]  Oh, they got 2,000.
[01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:21.060]  Oh, that'll be sold out by Sunday.
[01:44:21.739 --> 01:44:22.380]  They go, really?
[01:44:22.479 --> 01:44:23.659]  We don't sell other products that much.
[01:44:23.739 --> 01:44:26.199]  I said, I know it will sell...
[01:44:26.199 --> 01:44:31.500]  By the time this show's over, when you look at the numbers during the break, it'll be sold out at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:44:32.359 --> 01:44:36.640]  If you go to RealAlexJones.com, 200 got apportioned over there.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:43.359]  And by tomorrow, this new limited edition coin, which they came out with that I designed, and I told them to order 5,000.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:43.880]  They didn't.
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:44.819]  I guess they don't have the money.
[01:44:45.159 --> 01:44:47.819]  Made here in America, 0.999 silver.
[01:44:50.239 --> 01:44:56.399]  This coin, 1776 versus 1984, is about to sell out.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.859]  And again, it's the best times, worst times.
[01:45:01.399 --> 01:45:02.399]  It's selling really good.
[01:45:02.739 --> 01:45:03.579]  This is my idea.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:05.100]  The ELF wasn't another great idea.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:11.340]  And Trump ELF. And if they had 5,000 of them, we'd sell it in a week.
[01:45:11.439 --> 01:45:12.779]  Then we'd have the money we need to operate.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.420]  But it's still okay.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.180]  It helps us.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.500]  We've got a big war chest, though.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.300]  We need a big war chest to take on the globalists.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.619]  I mean, we're winning right now.
[01:45:19.739 --> 01:45:21.460]  But I'm toe-to-toe with them.
[01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:25.270]  The reason Trump won the election, the reason he gave millions of dollars.
[01:45:25.369 --> 01:45:26.430]  Well, I don't need billions, I need millions.
[01:45:27.069 --> 01:45:33.649]  So, they always lie to you and say, I got all this extra money, and then the New York Times reported three months ago, turns out Jones had meager assets, never had a lot of money.
[01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:34.689]  They knew that the whole time.
[01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:38.409]  I mean, I brought in a lot of money, and I put it into the fight.
[01:45:39.699 --> 01:45:45.319]  And they spent $326 million they filed in court two weeks ago to try to shut us down the last seven years.
[01:45:46.359 --> 01:45:47.420]  I've been saying $80 million.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.340]  That was the number before.
[01:45:48.819 --> 01:45:49.699]  They're really desperate.
[01:45:49.899 --> 01:45:52.460]  And I've spent less than $16 million fighting them.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:59.420]  That's still a lot of Trump elves and a lot of silver coins and a lot of T-shirts and a lot of supplements.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.720]  But they're all great products.
[01:46:00.859 --> 01:46:03.819]  So go to RealAuxJones.com if you want to be in the war.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.359]  Because wars are won by action.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.319]  And I'm standing up for you, and I'm standing up for my own future.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.119]  We're in this together.
[01:46:11.119 --> 01:46:12.319]  As I say, we're all affected.
[01:46:12.779 --> 01:46:16.079]  So I'll keep fighting no matter what, but I need your support.
[01:46:16.279 --> 01:46:18.220]  Go to realalexjones.com.
[01:46:18.319 --> 01:46:25.039]  There are 200 coins and 200 elves when we started the show there, and I would imagine that those will sell out today.
[01:46:25.319 --> 01:46:26.180]  And I want to thank you.
[01:46:26.239 --> 01:46:29.619]  When those sell out, they have an unlimited number between $9 and $14.
[01:46:29.619 --> 01:46:33.960]  These great challenge coins, they're heavy, they're pewter, nice gloss enamel paint.
[01:46:34.710 --> 01:46:38.310]  Great conversation piece, great stuff, great gift, great memento that you supported.
[01:46:38.529 --> 01:46:40.010]  If you don't have a big budget, I totally understand.
[01:46:40.409 --> 01:46:46.329]  Don't tread on me on one side, 1776. On the other side, big 1776, gas and flag.
[01:46:46.649 --> 01:46:51.699]  Another one, the answer, 1984, 1776. And you flip it over, Gadsden flag.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:54.140]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.359]  And again, here's the silver coin.
[01:46:55.779 --> 01:46:56.420]  One ounce.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.380]  It's amazing.
[01:46:57.939 --> 01:46:58.840]  It's limited edition.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.960]  So, there'll be a new one out, you know, probably months and months from now.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:04.180]  It took me three months to get this done.
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.119]  Did a great job.
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:06.359]  So, there it is.
[01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:07.600]  And I've got to come up with a new design now.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.380]  I'm thinking like, fight, fight, fight, Trump or something.
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:14.500]  But, these are mementos that you've been in the second American Revolution now going worldwide.
[01:47:15.279 --> 01:47:16.680]  So, the...
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:25.079]  Alex Jones Network is funded by your support, your word of mouth, and your prayer at realalexjones.com.
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:27.539]  And yeah, the posters, limited edition.
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:30.500]  Big, glossy, beautiful posters mailed to your door.
[01:47:30.699 --> 01:47:32.279]  They got the big markup on them.
[01:47:32.359 --> 01:47:34.260]  You're like, well, these are 30 bucks or 40 bucks or whatever.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:35.760]  What's going on with that?
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.760]  It should be 10 bucks.
[01:47:36.939 --> 01:47:37.020]  Yeah.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.659]  The point is it's a limited edition fundraiser.
[01:47:40.779 --> 01:47:43.760]  Like when you NPR gets all your tax money, but also begs for money constantly.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:53.239]  And they sell a coffee mug that costs six, seven bucks for a hundred or a t-shirt that costs 15 bucks for a hundred or a handbag that costs 50 bucks for 500. It's just a memento that you donate it.
[01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:54.930]  So it's not like it's an investment.
[01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:58.850]  It's not like I'm saying, you know, this is, you know, what I'm saying is it's an investment in freedom.
[01:47:58.970 --> 01:48:00.909]  And that way, if you really want to support, do that.
[01:48:01.869 --> 01:48:03.270]  Oh my gosh, look at that shirt.
[01:48:03.369 --> 01:48:04.649]  Go back to the 47 shirt.
[01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:07.090]  I designed that.
[01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:08.649]  I predict it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:48:09.729 --> 01:48:11.109]  That is a badass shirt.
[01:48:12.409 --> 01:48:15.250]  That is it, realalexjones.com.
[01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:18.350]  Not the X page, the URL, the shopping cart.
[01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:19.029]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:20.329]  I'm done.
[01:48:20.449 --> 01:48:20.729]  I just...
[01:48:22.539 --> 01:48:25.699]  I mean, I don't have Elon Musk or Bill Gates money.
[01:48:25.899 --> 01:48:27.220]  You know, Elon Musk is fighting them.
[01:48:28.079 --> 01:48:29.680]  Bill Gates is on the bad guy's side.
[01:48:29.739 --> 01:48:30.659]  I don't have Donald Trump money.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:34.199]  I've got you supporting me, and they've chosen me for destruction.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:40.739]  And because we persevered, place your support, you persevered, we are more effective than ever.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.439]  And I don't think about my personal safety.
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:45.380]  I mean, I make precautions.
[01:48:45.579 --> 01:48:47.199]  I'm important in the fight, but I don't worry about it.
[01:48:47.319 --> 01:48:50.539]  I'm fearless because my fear is the enemy winning.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.800]  I instinctively must war against these monsters.
[01:48:55.239 --> 01:48:59.260]  Okay, let's shift gears out of that now into racing to the rest of the news here.
[01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:08.149]  Alright, here's a quick snapshot on the World War III front that they've also got going to try to derail Team Humanity and the populist explosion of liberty and freedom and renaissance.
[01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:11.689]  Trump has called for us to stay out of the Syrian conflict.
[01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:12.689]  This is not our fight.
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:24.479]  It is Turkey that's been at war with Syria for a long time since Syria got out of the Ottoman Empire and World War I, at the end of World War I. And Trump says, this is not our fight.
[01:49:25.079 --> 01:49:30.020]  And the Russians are pinned down and Trump makes that point fighting NATO and the United States.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.720]  So Russia really can't help very much.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.699]  And it looks like Damascus, a good chance will fall.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:39.500]  And Trump says maybe this will end the war, and it's a good thing.
[01:49:39.579 --> 01:49:41.640]  I don't think the Muslims will ever stop fighting and killing each other.
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:43.699]  Obviously, NATO's involved as well.
[01:49:44.739 --> 01:49:47.659]  But Trump's at least publicly saying that, you know, we don't need to be involved in this.
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:48.500]  He's not in office yet.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.100]  Target is Damascus.
[01:49:50.199 --> 01:49:52.260]  Erdogan now admits what I said when this started a week ago.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:54.659]  I mean, it was known then.
[01:49:54.779 --> 01:49:56.319]  I was at the gym.
[01:49:56.439 --> 01:49:57.579]  Alex, what do you think's behind this?
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.659]  And I said, oh, I mean, it's Turkey and NATO and Israel.
[01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.909]  And now it's all admitted.
[01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:04.869]  So Erdogan came out officially today and said that.
[01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:07.170]  Here's Trump's statement on it.
[01:50:07.409 --> 01:50:08.470]  I wish Syria well.
[01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:09.590]  It's terrible what's happening there.
[01:50:09.710 --> 01:50:11.569]  But we need to just stay out of it.
[01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:17.689]  And it's definitely about the riots in Georgia and all the other crap is admittedly NATO again.
[01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:19.289]  This is all pointed at Russia.
[01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:23.510]  And it's wrong that the West is stirring all this up and doing all this.
[01:50:24.029 --> 01:50:26.130]  And all the wars we've been meddling in and doing.
[01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.810]  It's just terrible.
[01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:28.789]  But Trump is trying to de-escalate it.
[01:50:28.829 --> 01:50:31.310]  I told you before he did it that he was going to cut the funding to Zelensky.
[01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:38.909]  Two weeks ago, and then he did it through the Speaker of the House, and Trump's not even in office for another 43 days.
[01:50:39.829 --> 01:50:49.029]  So Trump then, surprise visit, meets Macron and Zelensky at Notre Dame, and you know what he's telling them in this craziness right now, you nutballs.
[01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:55.649]  We need to have an economy of, you know, industry and science and innovation, not this, you know, maniac behavior.
[01:50:57.690 --> 01:50:59.970]  Trump to make first international appearance, which he's done now.
[01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:04.069]  And we're asking Zelensky, are you going to be sent into exile?
[01:51:05.850 --> 01:51:10.670]  Meanwhile, before Trump gets in, they're still trying to send as many weapons as they can, even though Trump has killed $24 billion of funding.
[01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:18.409]  Wednesday, through the Speaker of the House, Russia to station new episodic missiles in Belarus to hit Europe even faster.
[01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:20.189]  So instead of five minutes, three minutes.
[01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:24.930]  More F-16s delivered to Ukraine, says Kiev.
[01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:29.710]  Biden and Trump hold another phone call.
[01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:35.029]  Russian-Syrian airstrikes kill dozens of terrorists, the Russians say.
[01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:37.430]  So that's what's going on.
[01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:40.989]  That's what's going on there.
[01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:45.590]  Now, let's talk about what we're fighting.
[01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:59.250]  I'm not going to have time to get into Daniel Penny and the fact that he's a hero and all the black people on the train said he was helping them and they were fighting too against a psychotic that had hundreds of arrests and just totally insane.
[01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:05.630]  And now the jury deadlocked on the main manslaughter charge and he got a smaller charge.
[01:52:05.909 --> 01:52:06.770]  It's just disgusting.
[01:52:06.909 --> 01:52:09.890]  The Soros people and their DAs don't want you to be able to defend yourself.
[01:52:10.350 --> 01:52:13.890]  If they can't get your guns right away, well, they'll at least try to put you in jail if you defend yourself.
[01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:16.630]  Well, better to be tried by nine than carried by six.
[01:52:17.029 --> 01:52:17.350]  Pollbearers!
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:21.020]  So we have that, but I'm not going to get into that because I want to hit...
[01:52:22.699 --> 01:52:28.180]  More capitulations by the left, realizing that it's in their own self-preservation to get behind team humanity.
[01:52:28.359 --> 01:52:30.720]  But I want to hit the transgender cult first.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:37.180]  So I want to remind you, this is all MI6, CIA, Tavistock created this to break up the family, destroy society, stabilize things.
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.159]  It's part of the transhumanist movement.
[01:52:40.159 --> 01:52:51.600]  If you'll accept men being women, and women being men, and all these lies, and there are no X and Y chromosomes, you'll accept cyborgs and human animal chimeras and replicants, basically, biological animals.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:53.100]  Androids.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:58.439]  And so I wanted to play you a pitiful, pitiful clip.
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:12.000]  I want to play 21 first, and then we'll play clip 10. Here are parents, and I've seen this on the news, you know, oh, it's so normal.
[01:53:12.159 --> 01:53:14.500]  We knew when our baby was born, it was another sex.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:17.039]  Talk about age of consent.
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:32.500]  You can't join the military until you're 18, can't buy cigarettes until you're 18, can't buy alcohol until you're 21, can't sign a contract until you're 18. Oh, but you can have a school brainwash you, mainly autistic kids and others, convince you that you're in this cool club, not tell your parents, put you in a database, brainwash you,
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.220]  and then take you away from your parents and sterilize your ass.
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.880]  And then you see the wreckage of the people they create with this, and then because they have the highest rate of suicide, they go, oh, it's because you didn't embrace them.
[01:53:42.939 --> 01:53:44.680]  No, it's because they were sucked into a death cult.
[01:53:45.479 --> 01:53:47.439]  Chopping your penis off doesn't make you happy.
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:52.060]  You know, even 10 years ago, you went to the doc and said, doc, cut my arm off.
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:53.260]  They put you in a mental institution.
[01:53:53.579 --> 01:53:55.479]  If you want to cut your penis off, it's supposedly okay.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:06.430]  So play what these parents say, and then go into just your standard leftist, and you think, well, we really picked a, you know, Gross trans person here.
[01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:08.609]  No, this is the majority of them.
[01:54:08.729 --> 01:54:09.689]  I've been to the Democrat rallies.
[01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:10.750]  I've seen it for myself.
[01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:21.750]  This guy with the hairy boobs, you know, just is into being a disgusting, you know, creature.
[01:54:22.590 --> 01:54:26.750]  I mean, the gremlin dressed up, you know, like with lipstick is better looking.
[01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:31.170]  And they're just celebrating and they love trolling people and love targeting your children.
[01:54:32.239 --> 01:54:35.760]  So, oh, our one-year-old, you know, we knew at birth they were another sex.
[01:54:36.779 --> 01:54:41.899]  And now they're going to pump deadly chemicals into them and sterilize them and then chop their breast and uterus out.
[01:54:42.199 --> 01:54:43.039]  Here are the clips.
[01:54:45.039 --> 01:54:47.420]  What motivated you to come out here today?
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:54.800]  We're supporting our child, Violet, and her access to the medical care that she needs.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.460]  Yeah, we're here for her rights and her ability to be who she is.
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:06.340]  And she's not going to let anybody silence her and we're not going to stand in her way.
[01:55:07.039 --> 01:55:08.079]  What state are you from?
[01:55:08.539 --> 01:55:08.939]  Arizona.
[01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:15.970]  Are you concerned about how this case would affect Arizona or do you think that would have an impact there?
[01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:30.409]  Yes, 100% we're concerned and we've discussed having to move which we don't want to do but Violet comes first and her medical care and her medical needs come first so we'll see what happens.
[01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:35.010]  In what age do you think most trans kids determine that they're trans?
[01:55:36.889 --> 01:55:40.829]  Violet told us when she was one and a half.
[01:55:41.010 --> 01:55:43.449]  She's been telling us since she could speak.
[01:55:44.789 --> 01:55:47.630]  So, she knew since birth.
[01:55:50.979 --> 01:55:53.619]  I'm so glad someone's finally asking this question.
[01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:57.920]  My problem is that I'm too hot, too successful in my career.
[01:55:58.239 --> 01:56:02.619]  I make too much money, I have too many amazing family, too many cute clothes.
[01:56:02.899 --> 01:56:05.399]  Do you know how hard it is to choose an outfit each day?
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.699]  I also have so many amazing and hot people sliding into my DMs every day.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.239]  It's time consuming to respond to all these messages.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.100]  Honestly, I've had it too good for too long.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:21.600]  I think my problem is that my life is so wonderful, and I only have 24 hours in a day to appreciate it all.
[01:56:22.319 --> 01:56:24.800]  How much do you want to bet that person's a schoolteacher?
[01:56:25.239 --> 01:56:26.439]  I bet a lot of money.
[01:56:27.159 --> 01:56:30.659]  So, this is a death cult.
[01:56:31.319 --> 01:56:35.720]  And you look at that so-called mother and father when the husband's like, good, do it to Violet, you know, their son.
[01:56:36.479 --> 01:56:38.880]  This is self-harm or Moonshausen by proxy.
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.439]  It's what it is.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.420]  The wife's so excited.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:44.680]  You know, they're little corporate operatives.
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.119]  That's their good ESG score.
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:49.399]  You know, just, oh, we, their social credit score, oh, look, we do this.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:57:04.039]  Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, Bill Maher, Mark Zuckerberg, Senator Fetterman, and other leftists are defecting to the Trump camp and saying, look, we're going to kill ourselves, destroy ourselves under the globalist mismanagement.
[01:57:04.079 --> 01:57:05.239]  That's actually what Bill Maher said.
[01:57:05.699 --> 01:57:06.680]  And then I've got...
[01:57:07.789 --> 01:57:18.409]  The mayor, Adams, targeted by the deep state because he wouldn't just worship illegal aliens and give them, you know, five times the welfare of citizens, says he's looking to convert to the Republican Party.
[01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:22.810]  So, there you go.
[01:57:22.909 --> 01:57:23.989]  And it's not Republicans are perfect.
[01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:25.829]  They're just not totally psychotic and out of control.
[01:57:25.949 --> 01:57:31.189]  And we've got a major beachhead of populism with Trump, insanity, and we're getting rid of the rhinos and neocons.
[01:57:31.229 --> 01:57:34.810]  I'd say we got 80% control of the Republican Party by getting in...
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:46.260]  Laura Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law is the head of the RNC. They were able to get the lawyers and the experts in and all the key battlegrounds to stop them being able to totally steal it.
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.600]  And that took a lot of money.
[01:57:47.859 --> 01:57:48.899]  A lot of you donating.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.159]  You got off the bench.
[01:57:50.239 --> 01:57:51.020]  That's how you did it.
[01:57:51.079 --> 01:57:54.119]  Your word of mouth, your prayer, your energy, your support.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:56.659]  And it's the same with Liberty Media.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.140]  Who's reaching the most people?
[01:57:59.310 --> 01:58:00.930]  People say, Joe Rogan, I'm not in competition with him.
[01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:02.810]  And Joe basically is my show now, which is great.
[01:58:02.869 --> 01:58:03.350]  He just sees it.
[01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.689]  He knows it.
[01:58:03.689 --> 01:58:05.149]  I told you four years ago he was going to get hardcore.
[01:58:05.409 --> 01:58:06.369]  He was already awake then.
[01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:07.449]  He just, you know, he did it his way.
[01:58:08.170 --> 01:58:10.430]  Told you Musk was about to get hardcore three years ago.
[01:58:10.649 --> 01:58:11.170]  I'm leaving it at that.
[01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.810]  I live here in Austin.
[01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.609]  I know a lot of folks.
[01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:15.529]  And interviewed him in a sense of things.
[01:58:15.670 --> 01:58:22.810]  But the point is, and he's coming to our cases, you know, helping us in our court case some with briefs and defense and things.
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:29.539]  But he's not taking over all my bills because under the corporate contracts of those companies, he'd get into a problem if he did that.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.760]  But he is blocking a lot of what they're doing.
[01:58:31.979 --> 01:58:34.039]  So I got Musk helping us there.
[01:58:34.199 --> 01:58:37.600]  I need you to help us by getting great products.
[01:58:37.739 --> 01:58:39.560]  I mean, who doesn't want Trump on a stump?
[01:58:41.779 --> 01:58:42.979]  Little elf.
[01:58:43.159 --> 01:58:44.619]  Who doesn't want a silver coin?
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.199]  Who doesn't want a 47 shirt?
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:51.079]  Who doesn't want Ultimate CMOS, the most incredible superfood out there that just turbocharges everything?
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:56.640]  I don't have time to get into what is in Ultimate CMOS, why Iris CMOS is already so loved.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:00.420]  Just look into Iris CMOS. And this is the strongest, most concentrated out there we know of.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:02.060]  We went to a top-rated company.
[01:59:02.159 --> 01:59:03.439]  Our sponsor didn't got it properly labeled.
[01:59:03.859 --> 01:59:05.640]  Up to 55% off right now.
[01:59:05.779 --> 01:59:07.779]  Biggest sales ever at the Alex Jones store.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:22.029]  But there's a clone of the store that's separate from the sponsorship with InfoWars, where all the funds that come in to realalexjones.com The same product, same company, same sponsor goes to the Alex Jones Network.
[01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:27.710]  Be sure and follow us at AJNLive on X, AJNLive on X, and tell others to.
[01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.510]  All right.
[01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:31.189]  I am fired up about freedom.
[01:59:31.329 --> 01:59:32.109]  We're turning the tide.
[01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:35.890]  Now is the time to not back down, but fight through the information warfare objective.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.039]  I want to thank the crew for a superlative job.
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:43.579]  They are so amazing, and you also support them when you support the transmission.
[01:59:43.579 --> 01:59:44.539]  We are a family.
[01:59:44.699 --> 01:59:46.760]  You are a part of our family as listeners and viewers.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:54.659]  Whether they take over InfoWars or not on Monday, I don't think it's going to happen, but pray for us, pray for everybody in this fight.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:58.020]  But regardless, the InfoWars, the information war is all of us.
[01:59:58.140 --> 01:59:59.159]  It will never die.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:11.949]  But get your limited edition InfoWars shirts while you still can, because they'll claim we can't do those if they do take over at RealAliceJones.com Alright, I'll see you back tomorrow night, 4pm Central from the Infowar Studios.
[02:00:11.949 --> 02:00:13.109]  Could be our last show there.
[02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.890]  God bless you.
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:30.359]  One of the most popular trends in supplementation right now are complete whole nutrient systems.
[02:00:30.659 --> 02:00:41.399]  I won't name any of the other brands but there's a lot out there and there's a good reason because they're incredibly powerful and when people use them they realize how much they've been missing out of their diet and daily nutrition.
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:42.800]  We have the best, folks.
[02:00:42.979 --> 02:00:46.939]  Out of all of them, Optimal Human is called Optimal Human because it is just that, optimal.
[02:00:47.079 --> 02:00:49.899]  It's everything you need for nutrition in a daily value.
[02:00:50.079 --> 02:00:52.500]  You take one scoop, put it in cold water, put it in a smoothie.
[02:00:52.779 --> 02:00:53.720]  It tastes great.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.180]  I add a little bit of lemon juice.
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:57.619]  And you really have everything you need for the day.
[02:00:57.739 --> 02:00:58.300]  It's not...
[02:00:58.890 --> 02:01:01.729]  Flash in the pan, lightning-like energy.
[02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:06.909]  It's more of a long, sustained energy throughout the day, and that's why I take it, but there's a million other reasons.
[02:01:07.289 --> 02:01:08.590]  Importantly, adaptogens.
[02:01:08.949 --> 02:01:13.390]  Adaptogens help to manage stress levels in a really powerful way.
[02:01:13.829 --> 02:01:18.170]  Now the goal of taking adaptogens is that it returns your body back to a state of balance, homeostasis.
[02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:20.130]  We're not supposed to be in a constant state of stress.
[02:01:20.289 --> 02:01:28.529]  In a state of nature, you're typically not very stressed and then maybe a saber-toothed tiger attacks you and your stress levels go way up and that does so many things to your body.
[02:01:28.689 --> 02:01:35.970]  It can thicken your blood because obviously if you're in a state of stress, your body responds by making it so you don't bleed out so it thickens your blood.
[02:01:36.069 --> 02:02:00.720]  Well, if you're in a constant state of low-level stress, that means your heart is just constantly working harder to pump your blood because it's always We're good to go.
[02:02:07.699 --> 02:02:09.560]  Not only that, it's of course nutrient-rich.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:14.979]  Its superfood blend is packed with nutrient-dense superfoods to support overall vitality and energy.
[02:02:15.159 --> 02:02:15.939]  It's Optimal Human.
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.800]  Everything you need for complete daily nutrition in one simple scoop.
[02:02:19.939 --> 02:02:20.520]  Optimal Human.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:23.119]  Available right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
