[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.668]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:11.269]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.809]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.010]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.191]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.912]  Alright, my friends.
[00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:32.334]  I want you to listen up and please listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:33.514]  Listen and listen good.
[00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:39.174]  Because I want the information we're going to cover today to sink in.
[00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:54.463]  And I want people to really buck up and consciously face what we're dealing with.
[00:00:54.463 --> 00:01:02.448]  The creeping death that is this predatory social engineering experiment known as the New World Order.
[00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:19.317]  We are being acclimated to accept total absolute draconian martial law in the United States.
[00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:32.049]  I became aware more than 15 years ago of a covert program to acclimate the public, the police, and the military and the state legislatures to accept open
[00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:41.048]  Military occupation of the American people.
[00:01:41.048 --> 00:01:47.153]  And they've used lots of different excuses, lots of different pretext.
[00:01:47.153 --> 00:01:59.683]  Oh, it's post 9-11, we're gonna have guys stand around in New York and Boston and Chicago and LA with machine guns and asking citizens questions, which does nothing to stop terrorists, even if you believe that's real.
[00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:01.705]  And oh, the Marine Corps is going to have
[00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:10.950]  Checkpoints in California, a hundred miles in, randomly searching vehicles on Friday and Saturday night looking for drunk drivers.
[00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.331]  You're not for drunk drivers, are you?
[00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:32.237]  And then I learned that back in the late eighties they had regular Marine Corps with the local police in Norfolk, Virginia and other areas, raiding gun dealer, legal gun dealers' homes as part of a covert program to acclimate the military and the police to accept total
[00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:35.017]  Military takeover of the United States.
[00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:45.966]  And of course, since then, we've had colonels on with the National Guard doing drills in Arcadia, Iowa, where they were doing a lockdown of the town and a gun confiscation door-to-door drill.
[00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.368]  That was all admitted in the newspaper.
[00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:53.112]  And then when we covered it and it became a political firestorm, they said, well, Mr. Jones is a kook.
[00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:57.636]  Yeah, we're doing gun confiscation drills, but still his interpretation of it is kooky.
[00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:17.533]  And since then, we've seen Illinois and the city of Chicago, in the last year and a half, call for regular Army and National Guard checkpoints looking for illegal guns and door-to-door, quote, weapons sweeps.
[00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:21.714]  I have played the press conferences here on air.
[00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:22.215]  Guess what?
[00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:22.795]  Now they're doing it.
[00:03:24.864 --> 00:03:40.112]  And I have video out of Albany, New York of the National Guard, back from Iraq, with giant scanners, x-ray machines, making people drive through the x-ray machines in their cars.
[00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:43.254]  Literally hundreds of times more powerful than a chest x-ray.
[00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:59.108]  And of course, now they admit that it is 20 to 50 times, depending on the system, more, in fact, we reprint that from a few days ago, more radiation in, government admits more radiation in body scanners than previously thought.
[00:03:59.108 --> 00:03:59.769]  I need that article.
[00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.570]  I want to have the specifics.
[00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.713]  I believe it was even higher in one of the systems than 50 times.
[00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:07.015]  High powered cancer risk.
[00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:18.017]  Now they're gonna make you go through, driving your car through, super high-powered x-rays that shoot through the metal of the car, and here's the kicker.
[00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:20.758]  Here is what shook me to my very core.
[00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:22.960]  Already this was going on covertly.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.825]  It is on the Albany, New York TV that they're looking for guns, as if guns are illegal.
[00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:34.387]  In New York, and they go, oh look, we found a rifle.
[00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:41.177]  The military has been turned into a tool against the American people.
[00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:43.338]  I'm going to cover it all when we come back, my friends.
[00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:44.760]  It is so incredible.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.723]  And we just had our camera crew get back, as you know, from Chicago.
[00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:58.412]  That video has been posted to PrisonPlanet.tv, a 25-minute exclusive report with foreign troops trying to take on American citizens and confiscate our guns, all admitted.
[00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:04.322]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:10.194]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:17.576]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:22.457]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:10.132]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:11.734]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:13.276]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:17.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.545]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:36.288]  I am immersed in fighting the New World Order.
[00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:47.932]  I am obsessed with studying legislation, government white papers, think tank white papers, interviewing whistleblowers and eyewitnesses.
[00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:58.275]  And I discovered back in 1995, when I first got on air, that there were covert military gun confiscation programs going on around the country.
[00:08:58.275 --> 00:09:01.536]  I was sent video shot by military people that were concerned.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.481]  We're good to go.
[00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:28.332]  I then traveled to urban warfare drills across the country and witnessed Marines, Army, National Guard training to take the American people's guns and admitting it.
[00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:35.014]  I would then see a CNN report in my hotel room at night of the drills and they would say, troops are training for Bosnia.
[00:09:35.014 --> 00:09:39.835]  Troops are training for any future Iraq missions.
[00:09:39.835 --> 00:09:42.936]  And I had been at the drills and I knew it was for America.
[00:09:42.936 --> 00:09:44.256]  And I made films about it.
[00:09:44.256 --> 00:09:46.057]  I desperately tried to warn people.
[00:09:47.577 --> 00:09:52.641]  And this has been a long-term, strategic, covert operation.
[00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:56.864]  Do you realize how creepy and how evil that is?
[00:09:56.864 --> 00:10:14.498]  Not only is the military being acclimated and trained to confiscate our guns and run checkpoints and detention centers publicly in NLE-09 and so many other drills, and to set up FEMA camps in a matter of hours at sports stadiums, part of Top Off 1, Top Off 2, and other drills,
[00:10:16.274 --> 00:10:19.436]  But it's been a covert, long-term program.
[00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:37.951]  The earliest examples I can find of it are 1987 in Norfolk, Virginia, with regular Marines officers, the creme de la creme, in police windbreakers, raiding legal gun shop owners' homes.
[00:10:40.894 --> 00:10:48.462]  So they have been forging these treasonous relationships for 23 years that I know.
[00:10:48.462 --> 00:10:58.232]  Eisenhower had a drill in 1960 that newspapers picked up on, practicing taking over several U.S.
[00:10:58.232 --> 00:10:58.553]  cities.
[00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:05.987]  And that was because the Republicans, of course, had passed the first Civil Rights Act, and they were preparing for that.
[00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:07.370]  But this is completely different.
[00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.439]  This is door-to-door, lock-mound cities, cordon and confiscate guns.
[00:11:12.557 --> 00:11:34.498]  And of course, you know, last year we got the kernel on, it was in the Arcadia newspaper in Iowa, and they said, oh yes, they're working with a local gun shop, he's playing the part of the terrorist militia member, and he won't turn his guns in, and we're doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills, and the citizens have allowed us to lock down the city and go to their houses and search them, search their cupboards.
[00:11:34.498 --> 00:11:35.039]  Was a quote.
[00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:45.463]  And then we saw Blagojevich right before he got disgraced saying, I'm going to have army checkpoints, we're going to have sweeps all over the state for guns, and we're going to have troops go door-to-door confiscating guns.
[00:11:45.463 --> 00:11:46.923]  I played the news conference.
[00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:48.944]  Now the city council's announced it.
[00:11:48.944 --> 00:11:50.784]  Other members of the legislature have announced it.
[00:11:50.784 --> 00:11:52.504]  It's now going on.
[00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:55.705]  My guys, two weeks ago, were in Chicago.
[00:11:55.705 --> 00:11:59.946]  The 25-minute report just went up on PrisonPlanet.tv last night.
[00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:08.955]  Polish and other Eastern Bloc country troops training to take on quote American terrorists and with weapon sweeps.
[00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:12.999]  Now, it all comes home and hits you.
[00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:27.833]  When you get a press release by the CHIPS last year, the California Highway Patrol, and it says the Marines are going to be helping us in the next month at daytime and nighttime checkpoints in the county looking for drunk drivers.
[00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:30.053]  And then the Marines were armed.
[00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:39.777]  We talked to the local newspapers, the eyewitnesses, and armed Marines pull you over, search your vehicle, take your guns, put you in a squad car, and send you to jail.
[00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:43.436]  And if guns are found, you're just taken to jail.
[00:12:43.436 --> 00:12:44.856]  Doesn't matter if they're legal.
[00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:48.238]  Now, that is CONFIRMED!
[00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:50.779]  CONFIRMED treason!
[00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:56.521]  And I don't just throw the word treason around here, boys and girls.
[00:12:56.521 --> 00:13:10.126]  I walked in here 30 minutes before showtime, and Matt Ryan said, you're going to want to see this, because he'd seen the Fox News report out of Albany that, oh, tonight, National Guard to be on the streets of New York, in New York State, in door-to-door,
[00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:33.596]  Anti-drug sweeps and I said you watch that's gonna be guns as well because they mix the word drugs with guns to demonize guns and I walked in he said you're gonna want to watch this and I saw it and I had an adrenaline rush I started breathing heavy I started pumping my fist because as a red-blooded American I know a red dawn takeover when I see one and that it's such creeping death though
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.605]  You're noticing they're using the army to confiscate guns in Katrina five years ago.
[00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:53.344]  You notice all over the Gulf now they're using the army backing up police to say felony federal charges under the orders of the Coast Guard if anybody videotapes what BP is doing or the chlorexid and the toxins they're dumping by the millions of gallons out.
[00:13:56.075 --> 00:13:57.596]  I mean, this is the end of America.
[00:13:57.596 --> 00:14:15.342]  Every chance they get, they set the parameters and the precedent to, we're not going to bring you food and water, we're going to block anybody trying to evacuate on their own, and we're going to come into your house and put you in plastic handcuffs and take your guns and take you to buses and put you forcibly on them.
[00:14:15.342 --> 00:14:17.523]  And when the oil comes in, they're going to try that in the Gulf.
[00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.764]  This is all drills.
[00:14:19.764 --> 00:14:22.205]  This is all being done to acclimate the population.
[00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.672]  And it's done to warp the minds of our men and women in uniform, both police and military.
[00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:31.433]  Please, for heaven's sakes, be smart enough to research.
[00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:36.976]  I mean, why were they covertly having secret military gun confiscation in 87?
[00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:44.739]  Why do they have Marines out doing PR stunts at drunk driving checkpoints from Kentucky to Alabama to California?
[00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:50.841]  Why do regular armed Marines come out when they have a shooting in a small town and then armed Marines show up?
[00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:52.262]  Why do they have for
[00:14:52.902 --> 00:14:57.204]  Security at the Kentucky Derby, regular army and National Guard.
[00:14:57.204 --> 00:15:03.827]  And when people run out on the field, they go and beat them up with 45 sidearms loaded.
[00:15:03.827 --> 00:15:15.252]  They don't let the troops on the border, the few thousand that are down there for show, in quote drug interdiction, that are kept 10 miles off the border because the Mexican troops will shoot at them because they're ready for war and haven't been castrated.
[00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:20.132]  They don't even let them have loaded weapons, but you better believe they got .45s.
[00:15:20.132 --> 00:15:25.197]  Folks, I've had regular Army come over to me in New York with .45s on their side.
[00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:26.778]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[00:15:26.778 --> 00:15:36.408]  Come running across the street, because I'm videotaping, and scream and cuss at me with .45s on their sides.
[00:15:36.408 --> 00:15:36.828]  Loaded .45s.
[00:15:36.828 --> 00:15:36.888]  APC.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.082]  Because I'm the enemy, not those Mexican troops.
[00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:49.828]  Firing at people, killing, and when police interdict drugs, they'll race across the border, now up to 25 miles in.
[00:15:49.828 --> 00:15:52.790]  First it was a mile, then three miles, then six miles, then 10 miles.
[00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.792]  They control over 80 miles in.
[00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:57.354]  Sheriffs are begging for emergency help.
[00:15:57.354 --> 00:15:58.975]  There's thousands of deaths.
[00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:01.677]  Whole neighborhoods are being burned down in Arizona.
[00:16:01.677 --> 00:16:06.601]  Rocket attacks in South Texas, car bombs in Dallas, and it's back of the newspaper.
[00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:09.324]  And what does the treasonous, treacherous federal government do?
[00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:13.851]  It violates the 9th, 10th, and 11th Amendment.
[00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:19.815]  You know, the 11th Amendment says the federal government can't sue a state, and it can't sue an individual on behalf of a foreign power.
[00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:25.639]  Why did the states, that was the first amendment after the first 10?
[00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:26.940]  1797.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:39.609]  Because there were already foreign powers coming in and lobbying federal bureaucrats to make sweetheart deals to harass certain states using the Commerce Clause so that foreign powers made larger profits on their exports and imports.
[00:16:40.683 --> 00:16:45.066]  And so they had to pass an amendment going, look, the federal government is, and it was almost a revolution over it.
[00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:50.590]  That troops actually from the state started marching on New York, which was the Capitol at the time.
[00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.270]  This is on record.
[00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.731]  Have you studied the history?
[00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:58.635]  The state started marching on the Washington.
[00:16:58.635 --> 00:16:59.596]  What is Washington today?
[00:16:59.596 --> 00:17:03.659]  Of course, New York.
[00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:06.501]  They started marching on New York, on the Capitol.
[00:17:08.837 --> 00:17:12.238]  Because they were globalist.
[00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:23.723]  Special interest came in, it was called mercantilism at the time, and they were using federal regulators to sue and harass and mess with the states, and so they had to pass the 11th Amendment.
[00:17:23.723 --> 00:17:28.144]  It's all there in the Constitution if you read the stinking thing.
[00:17:28.144 --> 00:17:32.946]  Now, violating the 9th, the 10th, and the 11th Amendment, this is treason.
[00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:35.087]  Feds sue to block Arizona illegal immigrant law.
[00:17:36.747 --> 00:17:38.128]  Mexico is a failed state.
[00:17:38.128 --> 00:17:41.129]  It has collapsed.
[00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:46.732]  Now Arizona is collapsing and a third of the state conservatively is now denied.
[00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:51.554]  Sheriffs in three counties are saying they can't even basically leave their offices.
[00:17:51.554 --> 00:17:56.177]  There are murder bounties out on the sheriffs that have called for help.
[00:17:56.177 --> 00:17:57.997]  That's mainstream news.
[00:17:57.997 --> 00:18:03.000]  And people are making jokes in the blogs and the quote liberal news sites going, oh, big deal.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.661]  You know, so what if they're getting death threats?
[00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.842]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Mexican drug cartels kill police.
[00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:13.344]  Of the 22,000 plus people killed in the last two years, many of them are police.
[00:18:13.344 --> 00:18:17.205]  And the others convert to corruption and go ahead and take the payoffs.
[00:18:17.205 --> 00:18:21.647]  This is the Mexican form of corruption that is now going to collapse the United States.
[00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:24.028]  You understand, our National Guard is in
[00:18:26.201 --> 00:18:33.245]  Afghanistan on record in AP, Reuters, and Fox News, and the regular Marines and Army are there admitting.
[00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:46.593]  The guys showed me another ABC News video the other day where it admitted on ABC Nightly News on broadcast TV that they're guarding the poppies, and it showed the troops guarding the poppies to, quote, be friends with the Afghans.
[00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:47.974]  They're shipping that crud in.
[00:18:47.974 --> 00:18:51.716]  Our troops grow the stinking stuff, and then now they're gonna be all over the country
[00:18:53.052 --> 00:19:13.090]  The cover so conservatives go along with it is oh it's a in fact that's the headline here out of Fox 23 out of Albany New York war on drugs part one and it says oh there it's drug interdiction for cocaine and heroin and then you read help find drugs and weapons and they have giant scanners that they make you drive through
[00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:19.124]  That are incredibly powerful, many times more powerful than a chest x-ray.
[00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:29.472]  And they have these giant mobile trucks that you drive under that have these big wands sticking out that scan your car with high-powered x-rays.
[00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:32.995]  And it shows the military showing the scans where it looks right through your car.
[00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:34.816]  And they go, look, we got a raffle!
[00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:36.517]  Arresting!
[00:19:36.517 --> 00:19:41.942]  So they got troops for New York and Illinois and California to search citizens.
[00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:46.398]  Remember the Tennessee governor last year told the military to stop doing illegal checkpoints?
[00:19:46.398 --> 00:19:48.439]  The military said, we're going to go ahead and do it anyways.
[00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:50.461]  That's in my new Marshall Law film.
[00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:52.222]  That's in Police State 4, Rise of FEMA.
[00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:55.345]  I mean, do you understand what's happening?
[00:19:55.345 --> 00:19:59.188]  That they won't give troops to the border that's collapsing because they're globalist.
[00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:04.013]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:04.013 --> 00:20:07.938]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:07.938 --> 00:20:11.663]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.663 --> 00:20:19.292]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:20:19.312 --> 00:20:19.612]  I think so.

[00:21:00.314 --> 00:21:02.997]  Hi, this is Peter Karanchnoble from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:09.424]  It is becoming painfully obvious the Washington bailout is running out of steam, and the economy is showing signs of a double-dip recession.
[00:21:09.424 --> 00:21:14.510]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.993]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:19.956]  Are majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[00:21:19.956 --> 00:21:23.100]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:30.909]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:33.712]  And it will protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:37.016]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals,
[00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:37.837]  I can help.
[00:21:37.837 --> 00:21:43.481]  Call me today, Peter Kronshnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:48.285]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:21:48.285 --> 00:21:52.189]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:52.189 --> 00:21:54.871]  You worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:21:54.871 --> 00:21:56.252]  Call Peter Kronshnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:22:02.537 --> 00:22:08.300]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:20.388]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:22:20.388 --> 00:22:28.653]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:22:28.653 --> 00:22:32.335]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:49.383]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:22:49.383 --> 00:22:52.086]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:57.470]  I'm Big John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:23:00.598 --> 00:23:03.600]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.661]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:23:05.661 --> 00:23:08.422]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:23:08.422 --> 00:23:10.643]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:23:10.643 --> 00:23:12.064]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:23:12.064 --> 00:23:13.945]  But first, the facts.
[00:23:13.945 --> 00:23:15.886]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:17.867]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:23:17.867 --> 00:23:21.569]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:23:21.569 --> 00:23:29.314]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:23:29.314 --> 00:23:29.914]  Sinofresh.

[00:23:49.569 --> 00:23:49.929]  Mention GCN.
[00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:50.869]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:51.050]  It works!
[00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:11.736]  And what's sick about all this is, we laid out how derivatives in the end of the Glass-Steagall Act were designed to bankrupt our country.
[00:24:24.468 --> 00:24:28.711]  We broke down how the states were being set up to be bankrupt more than a decade ago.
[00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:29.892]  That's all now coming true.
[00:24:29.892 --> 00:24:49.587]  I told you there was a covert plan through an organization called NORTHCOM before they even officially set it up after 9-11 to deploy federalized police in threat fusion centers with regular military to surveil the American people and carry out
[00:24:50.587 --> 00:25:14.516]  Just unbelievable acts of oppression and now it's the times of the army times, you know two years ago 400,000 troops brigade homeland starting out with 4,000 and Then we get their internal training documents and they're training to take us on and we get the New York Times and it shows Explorer scouts training with Homeland Security to quote take on disgruntled vets and
[00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:21.396]  Our current military and our police are trained to take on gun-owning Americans.
[00:25:21.396 --> 00:25:33.483]  If you're a gun-owning American with an American flag flying outside your house and a photo of John Wayne, and folks, I got a lot of relatives that got John Wayne hanging up in their living rooms and kitchens, okay?
[00:25:33.483 --> 00:25:35.264]  That's who the government hates.
[00:25:35.264 --> 00:25:37.605]  They don't like you.
[00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:41.308]  You like the red, white, and blue in John Wayne, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[00:25:41.308 --> 00:25:42.828]  You don't like socialism.
[00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:43.469]  You're the enemy.
[00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:48.253]  I mean, I'm not just saying that.
[00:25:48.253 --> 00:25:49.634]  They hate you.
[00:25:49.634 --> 00:25:52.355]  Read the MIAC and Homeland Security report.
[00:25:52.355 --> 00:26:10.585]  But they get all these young military people and all these young law enforcement people who are on power trips and they really teach them that these patriots are bad and these gun owners are bad and they love it when the good people get out or go to a smaller department to get away from it because all they've got left is steroid head, lunatic socialists.
[00:26:11.963 --> 00:26:17.608]  And I'm telling you, they're gearing up and training hard for war with the American people.
[00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:22.652]  And look at how the federal government's waging war on our borders, waging war on Arizona.
[00:26:22.652 --> 00:26:25.775]  They love the fact that California is going bankrupt.
[00:26:25.775 --> 00:26:28.958]  They love the fact that Michigan's going bankrupt and Florida.
[00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:29.779]  They love it.
[00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:31.240]  They love weakness.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.542]  They love collapsing societies.
[00:26:33.542 --> 00:26:34.383]  What do the banks do?
[00:26:34.383 --> 00:26:38.827]  They go in and bomb countries using our muscle, then they come in and give them loans to rebuild them.
[00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:47.767]  Well, they've used derivatives as a financial bomb to take us down.
[00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:54.369]  And I keep repeating this because I want it to really sink in and I want it to get out there into the nomenclature.
[00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:56.149]  This is all premeditated.
[00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:57.310]  This isn't Obama.
[00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.670]  This isn't George Bush.
[00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.310]  This isn't Bill Clinton.
[00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.531]  This isn't George Sr.
[00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:02.571]  This isn't Ronald Reagan.
[00:27:02.571 --> 00:27:04.732]  They're just puppets.
[00:27:04.732 --> 00:27:05.992]  They have been covertly
[00:27:09.062 --> 00:27:17.089]  Since the mid-1980s, this is in congressional hearings, preparing for a military-slash-police takeover of the United States.
[00:27:17.089 --> 00:27:23.374]  The government, in congressional hearings in the 90s, admits they ship narcotics in to destabilize this country.
[00:27:23.374 --> 00:27:33.222]  And then they put young troops out on the streets with body scanners, mobile body scanners, this is on the local news, and car scanners, and they have you drive through it.
[00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:44.677]  This is on the news, them having people drive through giant army car scanners.
[00:27:44.677 --> 00:27:49.901]  And here's the mail online, airport body scanners could give you cancer, warns expert.
[00:27:49.901 --> 00:28:02.950]  Here's another one, Columbia University, body scanners increase risk of skin cancer, 20 times higher or more than previously estimated with just the lowest radiation emitting x-ray system.
[00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.091]  And they are a form of x-ray.
[00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:12.547]  20 times, and of course now they admit, oh yeah, we are recording her naked body and everyone must do it.
[00:28:12.547 --> 00:28:14.427]  This is all dog training.
[00:28:14.427 --> 00:28:17.868]  Why are we all destroying ourselves?
[00:28:17.868 --> 00:28:20.228]  Police, military.
[00:28:20.228 --> 00:28:28.150]  I read to you Fox News where Maryland's banned that chemical added to plastic which sterilizes men.
[00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:38.115]  I've got the government documents where they decided in the 50s to make that standardized and phase it in by the 70s, and that's why your fertility's way down.
[00:28:38.115 --> 00:28:39.836]  You're under attack!
[00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:43.639]  Why do you buy into this fake Al-Qaeda fiction?
[00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:55.929]  I told you they were gonna put troops on the streets in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, and that next it would be gun confiscation, and now I've got local newscasts in Illinois, California, and New York, all announcing that they're trying to take your guns.
[00:28:55.929 --> 00:28:57.571]  And I've got newscasts out of Oakland,
[00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:06.029]  And out of Boston and out of Dallas where they say, well, the police are asking to come in your house and search for guns.
[00:29:06.029 --> 00:29:08.810]  And then I've got one out of Boston where they forced their way in.
[00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:15.173]  I mean, they put hardcore crimes on TV where the police forced their way in without a warrant to search for guns.
[00:29:15.173 --> 00:29:16.674]  They want your guns.
[00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:19.415]  The first thing they did in Katrina was say, let's set a precedent.
[00:29:19.415 --> 00:29:20.375]  Let's get their guns.
[00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:21.256]  And that was under Bush.
[00:29:24.949 --> 00:29:29.411]  And remember, I'll go back to this, remember what happened in Tennessee?
[00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:31.012]  Last year, I had a state rep on.
[00:29:31.012 --> 00:29:32.933]  The governor was in the newspaper.
[00:29:32.933 --> 00:29:35.094]  In Tennessee!
[00:29:35.094 --> 00:29:39.976]  Homeland Security had all four branches of the military out searching people, shutting down whole highways.
[00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:41.456]  There was video and photos of it.
[00:29:41.456 --> 00:29:44.018]  It's in my new police state film, Police State 4.
[00:29:44.018 --> 00:29:47.759]  And when the governor said no, the army and the military said, we're gonna do it anyways.
[00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:50.641]  It's a total federal takeover!
[00:29:50.641 --> 00:29:52.041]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:53.542]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.555 --> 00:29:57.226]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.926 --> 00:30:04.489]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.489 --> 00:30:05.389]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:08.812]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.812 --> 00:30:09.672]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.672 --> 00:30:14.575]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.575 --> 00:30:15.316]  It's true.
[00:30:15.316 --> 00:30:20.179]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.179 --> 00:30:21.019]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.602]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.602 --> 00:30:28.284]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.504 --> 00:30:29.305]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.305 --> 00:30:32.067]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.067 --> 00:30:35.751]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:36.532]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.532 --> 00:30:40.675]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.921]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:31:03.921 --> 00:31:05.181]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:08.922]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:11.363]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.363 --> 00:31:17.224]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.224 --> 00:31:23.446]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:23.886 --> 00:31:29.868]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:29.868 --> 00:31:34.029]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:38.330]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:44.272]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.272 --> 00:31:47.833]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:49.814]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:49.814 --> 00:31:50.234]  It's here.

[00:32:01.322 --> 00:32:02.442]  Alex Jones here.

[00:32:18.914 --> 00:32:22.075]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.

[00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:40.522]  We're good.
[00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:20.276]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown
[00:33:25.972 --> 00:33:46.452]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive
[00:33:51.904 --> 00:34:01.813]  And that's why you're the number one enemy of the criminal corporations that took this country over.
[00:34:01.813 --> 00:34:02.874]  You're self-sufficient.
[00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:05.277]  You know how to use a gun.
[00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:06.057]  You're red-blooded.
[00:34:06.057 --> 00:34:08.860]  You got John Wayne hanging up in your house.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.283]  You're scheduled to have your brains beat out in a FEMA camp.
[00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.144]  You think I'm joking?
[00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:22.649]  They've gone out there and selectively, psychologically tested millions and millions of troops and police that have gone through their brainwashing facilities.
[00:34:22.649 --> 00:34:26.230]  And they've got giant cadres that are ready to wage war against us.
[00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.271]  Well, I'm gonna crank this up and say this to you!
[00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:50.058]  You know, people are really starting to figure out that all of this is for real.
[00:34:50.058 --> 00:34:51.220]  This isn't hyperbole.
[00:34:52.475 --> 00:35:04.364]  So many times I'll be being interviewed in the studio by a TV station or another radio host or a newspaper reporter and they'll always look across the table and say, do you really, off record, do you really believe all this?
[00:35:04.364 --> 00:35:05.304]  Is this all an act?
[00:35:05.304 --> 00:35:07.106]  Is your name really Alex Jones?
[00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:10.428]  And I look at them and I say, what is your problem?
[00:35:10.428 --> 00:35:19.795]  Can't you look around you and see that the things I'm talking about are all manifesting themselves in an even more insane way than I can even describe?
[00:35:19.795 --> 00:35:21.296]  Let me boil this down very simply here.
[00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.910]  The New World Order are social engineers.
[00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:25.851]  They're psychologists.
[00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:27.291]  They're anthropologists.
[00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.511]  They're scientists.
[00:35:28.511 --> 00:35:31.152]  In their own words, they describe themselves as that.
[00:35:31.152 --> 00:35:33.372]  They understand full-spectrum dominance.
[00:35:33.372 --> 00:35:37.653]  They've made a cold-blooded decision that we are subhuman because we are not members of the elite.
[00:35:37.653 --> 00:35:40.754]  That is proof, self-evident, that we're not members of the elite.
[00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:45.135]  And so, we are obviously subhuman, and that we're hurting the Earth, and that we need to be removed.
[00:35:47.025 --> 00:36:02.029]  And of course, most of the people that are in the substrata of this themselves are being soft-killed and are too weak-minded to even admit that to themselves and get off on the power trip of knowing about the soft-kill, but just accepting it.
[00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:02.849]  And it's very simple.
[00:36:02.849 --> 00:36:09.771]  First, they've got to take over economically, and they've got to take over the agriculture, and they've pretty much done that to the entire Western world.
[00:36:12.256 --> 00:36:21.875]  And then they bankrupt us economically, and they know that we're going to get angry and try to take our government back, and they're there with oppressive mechanisms to keep us in line.
[00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:34.452]  They have been quietly gearing up a high-tech surveillance system with cameras, microphones, all fed into the NSA, face scanning, license plate scanning, everything being tracked everywhere you go.
[00:36:34.452 --> 00:36:38.613]  Those of us that would try to warn you, they would just call us kooks and nuts, even when we have the documents.
[00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:41.653]  But now you notice they're saying, yeah, we're listening to you with microphones.
[00:36:41.653 --> 00:36:43.074]  Yeah, we're tracking your cell phone.
[00:36:43.074 --> 00:36:45.454]  Yeah, there's no need to go through the toll road anymore and put money in.
[00:36:45.454 --> 00:36:49.295]  We're tracking your license plate with license plate readers.
[00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.271]  Yeah, we're controlling everything you do.
[00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:56.251]  Yeah, we took your baby's blood at birth 38 years ago.
[00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:59.332]  Yeah, it's in a Pentagon database for bioweapons.
[00:36:59.332 --> 00:37:02.433]  Yeah, yeah, we're gonna start censoring the internet.
[00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:06.653]  Yeah, okay, we are talking about putting lithium in the water to calm you.
[00:37:06.653 --> 00:37:09.794]  By the way, they're already doing it.
[00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:13.655]  Every major water supply, they're adding it too, if you go pay to have the test done.
[00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:16.642]  That's one of the hundreds of chemicals they put in.
[00:37:16.642 --> 00:37:19.164]  You're under chemical warfare attack.
[00:37:19.164 --> 00:37:21.745]  And they know most of your two week mind to even admit that.
[00:37:21.745 --> 00:37:25.007]  You're not gonna go research it because at your core, you're a coward.
[00:37:25.007 --> 00:37:28.810]  At your core, you won't admit up to hardcore things that are going on.
[00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.872]  You won't even look into it.
[00:37:32.872 --> 00:37:41.858]  And that's why they can come out in Fox News and say, yeah, okay, all men have basically ingested things to reduce their fertility and it causes cancer and it also causes breast cancer in women.
[00:37:41.858 --> 00:37:43.099]  Remember, I read that headline yesterday.
[00:37:45.677 --> 00:37:46.557]  What you gonna do about it?
[00:37:46.557 --> 00:37:47.357]  You're gonna do nothing.
[00:37:47.357 --> 00:37:50.698]  You're gonna sit there and you're gonna die and you're gonna take it.
[00:37:50.698 --> 00:37:51.659]  I mean, why?
[00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:51.979]  Why?
[00:37:51.979 --> 00:37:59.061]  99.9% of us are going to be hurt and destroyed by this and it doesn't matter.
[00:37:59.061 --> 00:38:06.443]  They give you petty power roles in your little sector of the compartmentalized system and so you don't care.
[00:38:06.443 --> 00:38:13.045]  It's easy to sit there in your squad car laughing at me right now.
[00:38:13.045 --> 00:38:13.665]  Go ahead then.
[00:38:15.438 --> 00:38:19.040]  Go ahead, shoot your kids up with mercury and cancer virus filled vaccines.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.160]  Go ahead and drink all the tap water you want.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.122]  Go ahead and eat all that GMO corn and food.
[00:38:24.122 --> 00:38:25.742]  Go ahead, okay?
[00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:28.644]  But I'm here to speak to the people that do actually care.
[00:38:29.682 --> 00:38:48.483]  I'm here to speak to the people who aren't on petty power trips and to tell you that I've done the best job I can to warn you and everything we discuss here is real and documented on record and it's so much worse because it's all interconnected and when you study this hour after hour, day after day, year after year, you get such a clear...
[00:38:49.484 --> 00:39:07.988]  Image of what's going on and then so many times I later get a new government white paper a new university document Sometimes written 30 40 50 years ago, and it's word-for-word what I've already envisioned their program to be and there they are admitting it all and I know what the next sentence is going to say do you know what that's like and
[00:39:10.495 --> 00:39:16.558]  And now all over the country, we see the military rolling out, and they'll first have a PR piece.
[00:39:16.558 --> 00:39:24.481]  Oh, we're here in Southern Tennessee, and the Army's out, or the Marines are out, or the National Guard are out, with the jaws of life helping cut people out.
[00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:32.485]  They'll cut to a woman, I was stuck in the car, and the Marines came and helped me and put me on care flight for my broken leg, thank you.
[00:39:32.485 --> 00:39:37.147]  That's all PR, to literally conquer you and occupy you.
[00:39:37.927 --> 00:39:40.091]  The federal government is occupying you.
[00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:41.252]  Do you know why they're doing that?
[00:39:41.252 --> 00:39:45.299]  Do you know why Smedley Butler was sent to third world countries to occupy them?
[00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:48.204]  When they totally destroyed their standard of living.
[00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:50.127]  When they took over their society.
[00:39:54.949 --> 00:40:12.082]  I was reading this morning about all these towns and major cities simultaneously in Australia doubling and tripling their water costs, quote, privatizing it for their national debt, giving your water supply over to private interests that sold you derivatives through fraud, and then doubling and tripling prices.
[00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:18.822]  Here in Austin, they swore five years ago, two years ago, that they would never put toll roads on MOPAC.
[00:40:18.822 --> 00:40:23.647]  After they'd announced they were going to do it, we would go to the city council meetings and they'd say, what are you talking about?
[00:40:23.647 --> 00:40:25.529]  Because an election was coming up.
[00:40:25.529 --> 00:40:26.410]  We're not planning that.
[00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.491]  We said, here's your maps.
[00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:28.652]  Here's your press conferences.
[00:40:28.652 --> 00:40:30.995]  And they said, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:32.476]  That was on the news.
[00:40:32.476 --> 00:40:33.958]  They called us conspiracy theorists.
[00:40:36.505 --> 00:40:47.699]  And then they announced today they're going to take Mopac and the existing lanes, the second most busy bridge and highway in Texas, and they're going to put a toll road on it.
[00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:49.201]  It's against state and federal law.
[00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:49.722]  They don't care.
[00:40:49.722 --> 00:40:50.643]  And guess who's running it?
[00:40:50.643 --> 00:40:52.746]  State Senator Kirk Watson, former Austin mayor.
[00:40:54.281 --> 00:41:06.384]  Who took tens of thousands of private property, wouldn't let people build on it, took it through adverse possession, said it was going to be a nature preserve, and turned around and sold it to his buddies, and he even owns the private bank that runs all the transactions.
[00:41:06.384 --> 00:41:10.405]  I mean, this guy is a fat, degenerate gangster.
[00:41:10.405 --> 00:41:12.345]  This guy is an el jefe.
[00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:14.666]  This guy is a sickening joke.
[00:41:23.126 --> 00:41:31.109]  Last year I was still doing my Sunday show out of the KLVJ studios and beyond the beltway we'd come to town, a syndicated national show.
[00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:33.389]  And that guy shook my hand and said, oh I like the show.
[00:41:33.389 --> 00:41:35.010]  And all of a sudden Kirk Watson walks in.
[00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.971]  This is about two months before their show starts.
[00:41:36.971 --> 00:41:40.192]  My show just ended in the same studio because they were down here visiting.
[00:41:40.192 --> 00:41:43.953]  And Kirk Watson started shaking and, hi, hi Alex, hi!
[00:41:43.953 --> 00:41:47.194]  And I didn't make a scene, I just said, hi, hi, hi Kirk and left.
[00:41:48.637 --> 00:41:54.262]  But he was shaking, and he should be shaking, because I know who he is.
[00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:59.686]  I mean, the farmers and ranchers who called me crying, their homes I went to.
[00:41:59.686 --> 00:42:13.898]  For a decade, the city wouldn't let them build on it or sell it, but kept their property taxes up and then took it by adverse possession and literally gave those families, some of them that had been there since Texas was founded, you know, back when Austin was named Waterloo and not Austin after
[00:42:15.503 --> 00:42:23.451]  Of course, the people involved in the founding of the state.
[00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:28.055]  Stephen F. Austin, Colonel Travis, all of them.
[00:42:28.055 --> 00:42:28.676]  Travis County.
[00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:38.985]  And I just would sit there and I'd watch those old ranchers and cowboys going in, pulling up in their old trucks, walking in saying, look, I don't take my property.
[00:42:38.985 --> 00:42:40.085]  I just want it to be a ranch.
[00:42:40.085 --> 00:42:43.366]  And Watson saying, it's for the salamanders, it's for the earth.
[00:42:43.366 --> 00:42:46.147]  And then I watched him build hotels and strip malls on it.
[00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:51.728]  And that, oh, just to be ruled by mafia trash.
[00:42:57.461 --> 00:42:59.122]  It's so painful.
[00:42:59.122 --> 00:43:01.604]  And to just see him announce it today in a press conference.
[00:43:01.604 --> 00:43:06.608]  Yeah, we're gonna put toll roads on the existing road.
[00:43:06.608 --> 00:43:14.454]  Paul Watson's doing a detailed report on this right now at PrisonPlanet.com, but we have the video posted with a blurb by Matt Ryan.
[00:43:14.454 --> 00:43:16.236]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:43:16.236 --> 00:43:18.778]  Treason in New York.
[00:43:18.778 --> 00:43:22.420]  National Guard confiscating guns from citizens.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.262]  See, a military kills people and breaks things.
[00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:27.492]  They got National Guard, Regular Army.
[00:43:27.492 --> 00:43:31.373]  They're already turning the National Guard into Regular Army, federalizing it.
[00:43:31.373 --> 00:43:43.418]  Training everywhere to take your guns, and in this newscast, they start out by how they're fighting drugs, and then they segue into, oh, we're also going after guns!
[00:43:43.418 --> 00:43:54.403]  And, oh, look, we put you through the x-ray machine, and look, there's a gun hidden in that trunk.
[00:43:54.403 --> 00:43:55.383]  This is really going on.
[00:43:57.671 --> 00:44:01.894]  This is really happening.
[00:44:01.894 --> 00:44:17.083]  And then if you get upset about it and try to go videotape one of these installations, they came out and arrested that middle class housewife and she had a gun in her trunk and they arrested her and trumped up terrorism charges on her when she wasn't planning anything, because you're the enemy.
[00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:21.406]  And all over the country now, the National Guard and Army and Marines are part of knock and talk.
[00:44:23.274 --> 00:44:26.419]  The police come into your door with troops saying, we want to come in and look at your guns.
[00:44:26.419 --> 00:44:33.891]  And if you say no, on the news in Boston, they pushed their way past without warrants into your house.
[00:44:33.891 --> 00:44:35.394]  And they announced, hey, the First Amendment's dead.
[00:44:39.534 --> 00:44:41.575]  This is really happening.
[00:44:41.575 --> 00:44:56.120]  They really have taken most of the old National Guard armories and turned them into threat fusion, threat integration centers, and they have regular Army, CIA, FBI, all this money they give locals in there, tracking people's cell phones in real time.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:06.144]  They got the cameras reading the license plates of the cars, and they tell the cops in there, you're federalized now, you get a federal stipend on top of it, but don't tell anyone you've signed a national security letter now.
[00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.612]  And here's Colonel Drago from Eastern Europe.
[00:45:11.612 --> 00:45:12.872]  He's going to be your liaison.
[00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:17.415]  I mean, I see that all over the news now, where foreign troops are part of the threat fusion centers.
[00:45:17.415 --> 00:45:21.377]  In fact, here's an article out of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:21.377 --> 00:45:25.559]  Paul Joseph Watson, we have the 25-minute video posted at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:25.559 --> 00:45:30.942]  East European troops, Poland and other countries, training to take on the American people on video.
[00:45:30.942 --> 00:45:33.864]  Polish troops trained to take on American terrorists.
[00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:37.006]  Kurt Nimmo's headline, foreign troops training to confiscate guns of Americans.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:45.264]  And of course, here's where you can look at the video from ABC News and also Fox 23 News.
[00:45:45.264 --> 00:45:47.566]  Treason in New York.
[00:45:47.566 --> 00:45:48.266]  And it goes on.
[00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:51.328]  National Guard confiscating guns from American citizens.
[00:45:51.328 --> 00:45:53.009]  This is really going on.
[00:45:53.009 --> 00:45:58.893]  And they just slowly ease it out there to condition you.
[00:45:58.893 --> 00:46:00.874]  They tell you, oh, we're fighting drugs and guns.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.901]  I told you about that Supreme Court ruling.
[00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:18.432]  They've now passed a new law in Chicago that, yes, if we allow you to take the five-hour class and then the background check clears, you don't have to be a criminal to be denied, and then if we decide that maybe you can be registered to have a gun locked up in your house.
[00:46:25.714 --> 00:46:36.964]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of the military putting people through high-powered x-ray machines that shoot through car metal.
[00:46:36.964 --> 00:46:38.586]  And I've looked up these systems.
[00:46:38.586 --> 00:46:41.348]  I mean, it is off the charts compared to a chest x-ray.
[00:46:41.348 --> 00:46:43.771]  Of course, it's very dangerous to the troops running them.
[00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:47.234]  They don't care if the troops die of testicular cancer five years from now.
[00:46:48.598 --> 00:46:49.379]  They don't care.
[00:46:49.379 --> 00:46:56.424]  They are setting precedents to record your naked bodies in the airports and pump you full of high-powered radiation.
[00:46:56.424 --> 00:46:58.226]  Why not dwarf it?
[00:46:58.226 --> 00:47:00.968]  Now they're saying there's breast bombs.
[00:47:00.968 --> 00:47:03.590]  Breast bombs.
[00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.652]  That Al-Qaeda, Al-CIA is going to hit us with.
[00:47:05.652 --> 00:47:07.994]  So now they want chest x-rays at the airport.
[00:47:07.994 --> 00:47:09.635]  Why not?
[00:47:09.635 --> 00:47:13.878]  The gullible American people let the bank steal trillions and Congress can't find out where it went.
[00:47:13.878 --> 00:47:16.260]  Why not send us their chest x-rays?
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.762]  What a good way to give people cancer.
[00:47:18.715 --> 00:47:19.776]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:47:19.776 --> 00:47:22.938]  Here it is, out of Fox 23, Albany, New York.
[00:47:22.938 --> 00:47:30.284]  In tonight's Fox Focus, the New York National Guard has been part of missions around the world, but they also have a very important one right here at home.
[00:47:30.284 --> 00:47:32.306]  It's to keep the drugs off our local streets.
[00:47:32.306 --> 00:47:36.589]  Their technology and training is now free to local police departments and agencies if they want it.
[00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:40.212]  As Fox 23's Kristin Lombard explains, no one's been turned away if they ask for help.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.264]  Dust and desert.
[00:47:44.264 --> 00:47:49.440]  The images most equate with the New York National Guard on the front lines in the Middle East fighting the war on terror.
[00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:53.465]  These images are pictures of another fight.
[00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:55.006]  A fight here at home.
[00:47:55.006 --> 00:47:57.106]  The war on drugs is an ongoing war.
[00:47:57.106 --> 00:48:00.107]  Our people are committed to this fight.
[00:48:00.107 --> 00:48:01.047]  It's a domestic fight.
[00:48:01.047 --> 00:48:02.207]  They firmly believe in it.
[00:48:02.207 --> 00:48:10.828]  The New York National Guard's Counter Drug Task Force providing not only the people but the equipment law enforcement may need to make drug arrests and seizures.
[00:48:10.828 --> 00:48:13.549]  We can go right on the scene with this or into a car.
[00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:20.010]  You can sniff around with it or you can take a swab of a surface and put it into the machine and it'll tell you what it is.
[00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:27.641]  Using ionization, counter drugs machines can detect chemicals, explosives, narcotics on money, weapons, even fabric.
[00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:31.927]  A simple swab can tell you if that surface had contact with those substances.
[00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:40.633]  And a simple sweep of an undercarriage or a scan of a car can help find drugs or weapons being brought into the Capital Region.
[00:48:40.633 --> 00:48:50.098]  While the Under Vehicle Inspection System looks for traps or voids where anything could be taped or bolted in, the Mobile Vehicle Inspection System takes it one step further.
[00:48:50.098 --> 00:48:57.262]  Basically it's an x-ray and if you zoom in on the trunk portion you can see the rifle that's laid across the bottom there.
[00:48:59.454 --> 00:49:01.795]  With a warrant, a department can request a scam.
[00:49:01.795 --> 00:49:05.937]  Then, with the swing of an arm, gamma rays outline the car and its skeleton.
[00:49:05.937 --> 00:49:13.901]  We scan the car and we can give them images of areas that they might want to look at and we'll identify anomalies for the law enforcement.
[00:49:15.201 --> 00:49:17.242]  So they can check into the car further.
[00:49:17.242 --> 00:49:19.564]  That way they don't have to rip the car totally apart.
[00:49:19.564 --> 00:49:24.607]  We can show them spots with points of interest where they might want to check to find something.
[00:49:24.607 --> 00:49:29.950]  The Schenectady Police Department, just one agency that has called in the guard for help.
[00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:31.410]  In 2009, a driver was arrested.
[00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:36.873]  His car brought to the station and scanned after an officer smelled marijuana coming from the car.
[00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:42.957]  No drugs were found, but that traffic stop and scan, part of an investigation against the suspect.
[00:49:43.417 --> 00:49:51.820]  Our investigation continued on that individual for almost another year, and he eventually was taken into custody for drug trafficking charges.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:50:01.083]  It's a great resource that we certainly don't have the money to afford, but it's a resource available to us at no cost, so it's a big help to us.
[00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:03.024]  Alright.
[00:50:03.024 --> 00:50:03.624]  And N.A.R.M.Y.
[00:50:03.624 --> 00:50:05.104]  helicopters, it cuts to that.
[00:50:05.104 --> 00:50:06.725]  All lies.
[00:50:06.725 --> 00:50:08.305]  At no cost to you?
[00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:10.366]  That's taxpayer money from the state.
[00:50:12.759 --> 00:50:15.462]  From the citizens that paid for all that, cop.
[00:50:15.462 --> 00:50:17.024]  So get that through your head.
[00:50:17.024 --> 00:50:18.566]  Everything is a lie.
[00:50:18.566 --> 00:50:21.630]  These people lie so much, they don't even know it's a lie.
[00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.913]  It's just a world of baloney.
[00:50:24.913 --> 00:50:30.240]  And of course, remember, I can play you clip after clip of Army and Marines growing the opium.
[00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:31.968]  We'll be back.
[00:51:02.731 --> 00:51:03.972]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:03.972 --> 00:51:06.474]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.474 --> 00:51:08.376]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.376 --> 00:51:15.602]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.602 --> 00:51:19.986]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:19.986 --> 00:51:30.295]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.555 --> 00:51:32.116]  Under any circumstance.
[00:51:32.116 --> 00:51:39.339]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:39.339 --> 00:51:40.040]  But listen up.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:46.283]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:46.283 --> 00:51:48.124]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:48.124 --> 00:51:50.305]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:50.305 --> 00:51:50.785]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:50.785 --> 00:51:52.666]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:53.286]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:53.286 --> 00:51:53.866]  Right now.
[00:52:02.532 --> 00:52:05.055]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.316]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.316 --> 00:52:10.260]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.502]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.502 --> 00:52:17.668]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.348 --> 00:52:25.015]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:25.015 --> 00:52:31.022]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:31.022 --> 00:52:34.666]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:39.469]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.469 --> 00:52:45.414]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.414 --> 00:52:48.956]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.956 --> 00:52:50.938]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.938 --> 00:52:52.079]  It's here.

[00:54:07.034 --> 00:54:08.776]  It's happened everywhere else.
[00:54:08.776 --> 00:54:10.698]  The military just takes over.
[00:54:10.698 --> 00:54:13.200]  That's why Latin America can never get up off its knees.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.763]  That's why much of Asia can't get up off its knees.
[00:54:15.763 --> 00:54:17.764]  Eastern Europe.
[00:54:17.764 --> 00:54:25.872]  That's why the Dark Ages in Western Europe went on for a thousand years because of military warlords.
[00:54:25.872 --> 00:54:27.974]  And now the offshore banks control our military.
[00:54:29.508 --> 00:54:38.071]  And I can play you the ABC News clips of the police chief saying no one will be allowed to be armed, everyone will have to turn their weapons in from New Orleans.
[00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:43.733]  I can play you countless clips of police forcing their way into houses, quote, for gun inspections.
[00:54:43.733 --> 00:54:48.555]  Even though guns are legal, they just want to come see your guns in Boston, in Oakland.
[00:54:48.555 --> 00:54:49.856]  You've all seen it.
[00:54:49.856 --> 00:54:53.337]  This is a criminal, predatory government.
[00:54:53.337 --> 00:54:57.199]  And they're announcing they're going to take large parts of the police pension funds.
[00:54:57.199 --> 00:54:58.099]  The cops are going to love it.
[00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:01.823]  You know, at least their bosses are.
[00:55:01.823 --> 00:55:12.572]  And it's just totally, totally sick.
[00:55:12.572 --> 00:55:13.893]  And I got a lot of other news coming up.
[00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:19.198]  I was so shocked by that clip that you just heard in the videos up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:19.198 --> 00:55:23.622]  I never even told you Wayne Madsen's coming up with his intel on Gulf evacuations.
[00:55:25.413 --> 00:55:26.954]  In about 35 minutes from now.
[00:55:47.669 --> 00:55:52.411]  So we've got Wayne Madsen, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and Chris Emery joining us.
[00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:53.931]  And we will have open phones as well.
[00:55:53.931 --> 00:55:55.872]  I'm going to go ahead and give that number out.
[00:55:55.872 --> 00:56:05.915]  But I would ask you specifically, what do you think of them now saying federal felony charges if you try to videotape any of the cleanup efforts or get on the beach down there?
[00:56:05.915 --> 00:56:06.916]  Just no First Amendment.
[00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:09.497]  The news is telling you the First Amendment quote is dead.
[00:56:09.497 --> 00:56:10.857]  And they kind of say it with pleasure.
[00:56:10.857 --> 00:56:16.239]  What do you think of all over the country, gun confiscations are now going on with the military running them?
[00:56:17.858 --> 00:56:20.100]  Well, they don't care if your rifle or handgun is legal.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:23.342]  They just go ahead and cess pits like New York and Illinois.
[00:56:23.342 --> 00:56:26.604]  Great people up there, but their governments are total criminals.
[00:56:26.604 --> 00:56:30.968]  I remember this Connecticut mayor a few months ago said, oh, I want martial law here.
[00:56:30.968 --> 00:56:32.729]  I want the army on the streets.
[00:56:32.729 --> 00:56:33.990]  Remember you heard that in Illinois.
[00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:37.733]  You heard that in Michigan.
[00:56:37.733 --> 00:56:38.914]  I've even heard that in California.
[00:56:39.673 --> 00:56:41.995]  And the Feds are there lobbying him to do this.
[00:56:41.995 --> 00:56:47.258]  And okay, well the Marines are going to help because we don't have the resources locally because all the taxes go to the Feds.
[00:56:47.258 --> 00:56:50.501]  Remember that USA Today headline yesterday?
[00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:59.707]  About how massive layoffs at county and cities of firemen and people that build the roads and animal control, things you really need.
[00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:01.168]  But oh, the Feds are hiring.
[00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:02.089]  Their pay is going up.
[00:57:03.766 --> 00:57:10.973]  Because it's, I mean, if you want your hind end wiped soon, they're going to have one Fed that puts handcuffs on you and the other that does the wiping.
[00:57:10.973 --> 00:57:13.976]  I mean, I'm sorry, but that's what these vampires do.
[00:57:13.976 --> 00:57:15.157]  What does Ted Bundy do?
[00:57:15.157 --> 00:57:16.338]  He chains you down.
[00:57:16.338 --> 00:57:17.720]  What does John Wayne Gacy do?
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.941]  He chains you down.
[00:57:18.941 --> 00:57:19.722]  What did Hitler do?
[00:57:19.722 --> 00:57:25.287]  He chained you down before he tore your toenails out and pulled your teeth out with pliers.
[00:57:25.287 --> 00:57:26.168]  That's the analogy.
[00:57:27.506 --> 00:57:29.888]  You better get your red blood flowing, folks.
[00:57:29.888 --> 00:57:30.869]  We know what this is.
[00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:36.414]  110% red alert emergency.
[00:57:36.414 --> 00:57:38.415]  And I'm not running off to Costa Rica or something.
[00:57:38.415 --> 00:57:39.937]  I'm going down with the ship.
[00:57:39.937 --> 00:57:48.264]  But a lot of you are going to wish later, like Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, oh, how we burned in the camps later, wishing we'd have done something when we could.
[00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:51.186]  Tell you about a few sponsors made this vital transmission possible.
[00:57:51.186 --> 00:57:54.890]  And we're coming back with the next hour and a bunch of other incredible news that makes my blood boil.
[00:57:55.947 --> 00:57:57.409]  I want to tell you about a ColaBlue.com.
[00:57:57.409 --> 00:58:00.592]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean drinking water made right out of the air you breathe?
[00:58:00.592 --> 00:58:02.795]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[00:58:02.795 --> 00:58:05.798]  Our sponsor, ColaBlue, the ColaBlue 28 and 30.
[00:58:05.798 --> 00:58:07.260]  Machines will allow you to do just that.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.823]  It's easy to use and will make up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[00:58:09.823 --> 00:58:10.744]  Runs through 7 to 12 filters.
[00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.630]  It's awesome.
[00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.771]  It's the best, purest, cleanest drinking water you can get.
[00:58:15.771 --> 00:58:16.171]  Period.
[00:58:16.171 --> 00:58:16.871]  Wonderful system.

[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.601]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.601 --> 01:00:05.183]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.183 --> 01:00:06.483]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.483 --> 01:00:08.243]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.243 --> 01:00:09.443]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:11.584]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.584 --> 01:00:13.144]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.144 --> 01:00:17.325]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.325 --> 01:00:21.426]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.289]  There's a lot of red blood flowing through our thinking centers of our brain.
[01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:34.821]  I mean, look, I analyzed this correctly 15 years ago.
[01:00:36.562 --> 01:00:37.823]  And we didn't have all the pieces.
[01:00:37.823 --> 01:00:38.945]  Now it's out in the open.
[01:00:38.945 --> 01:00:40.506]  Total military occupation.
[01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:43.890]  NSA microphones everywhere listening to us.
[01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:48.194]  Cameras scanning our license plates and faces everywhere we go.
[01:00:48.194 --> 01:00:51.998]  Worldwide quotas before babies are even born.
[01:00:51.998 --> 01:00:55.502]  The CPS comes and is planning to trump up charges to take your child.
[01:00:59.926 --> 01:01:06.969]  The New York City subway bomb plot's been linked to the same British MI6 cell that we've proven is run by a high-level member of MI6.
[01:01:06.969 --> 01:01:13.331]  I covered that in Terror Storm.
[01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:15.932]  The Russians are now admitting those are basically spies.
[01:01:15.932 --> 01:01:17.013]  Of course they are.
[01:01:17.013 --> 01:01:18.373]  But they're offering to give U.S.
[01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:21.775]  spies back that we never hear about in our media in a spy swap.
[01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:26.878]  Notice the spies didn't try to infiltrate the government, because that's all run by a bunch of political prostitutes.
[01:01:26.878 --> 01:01:29.661]  They tried to infiltrate Harvard and Wall Street that runs this country.
[01:01:29.661 --> 01:01:32.263]  And it's going to be taking your pension funds directly.
[01:01:32.263 --> 01:01:32.744]  Already are.
[01:01:32.744 --> 01:01:35.607]  A lot of you are already getting your pension fund taken, aren't you?
[01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:36.528]  Look at this key article.
[01:01:36.528 --> 01:01:40.531]  Paul Joseph Watson, and now a detailed analysis of our top story today.
[01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:44.836]  New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscation.
[01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:47.075]  Red alert!
[01:01:47.075 --> 01:01:48.295]  Red alert!
[01:01:48.295 --> 01:01:49.456]  Red alert!
[01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:50.776]  This is in New York State.
[01:01:50.776 --> 01:01:56.578]  It's going on in Illinois, going on in California, going on in Texas.
[01:01:56.578 --> 01:01:58.319]  Oh yeah, they got National Guard in Dallas.
[01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:01.961]  I saw this five years ago.
[01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:03.581]  People are like, well then why are you getting so upset?
[01:02:03.581 --> 01:02:06.162]  Because it's getting more and more widespread.
[01:02:06.162 --> 01:02:08.703]  More and more mainstream.
[01:02:08.703 --> 01:02:12.205]  It was a minor footnote in Dallas that, oh National Guard helps sometimes.
[01:02:14.749 --> 01:02:23.731]  We go to the house and ask if we can see the guns, and then you watch the video out of Boston where the cops shove their way past the woman and say, I want to see your guns.
[01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:26.132]  I mean, it is just insane.
[01:02:26.132 --> 01:02:27.552]  It's so evil.
[01:02:27.552 --> 01:02:33.113]  It's bonafide, hardcore, cyanide to America.
[01:02:33.113 --> 01:02:34.753]  I mean, it's 100%.
[01:02:34.753 --> 01:02:36.914]  I keep wringing my hands.
[01:02:36.914 --> 01:02:38.994]  I keep trying to figure out what we're going to do.
[01:02:38.994 --> 01:02:40.455]  You know what I want to do right now?
[01:02:40.455 --> 01:02:41.575]  I haven't opened the phones up yet.
[01:02:42.651 --> 01:02:46.493]  I want to open the phones up for police and military.
[01:02:46.493 --> 01:02:50.715]  I want to hear from you, because I know police sent us a lot of key information.
[01:02:50.715 --> 01:02:55.337]  It was police sent us the information about how the government's trying to take on vets and gun owners.
[01:02:55.337 --> 01:02:56.398]  But I want to hear from you.
[01:02:56.398 --> 01:03:10.965]  I mean, when the feds come into your town and give you IED training and all these drills, it's always to fight the local militia, and ROTC is in the newspaper in San Antonio training at the universities to take on militias and gun owners and the Boy Scouts.
[01:03:10.965 --> 01:03:11.806]  I mean, come on.
[01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:15.604]  The Boy Scouts are training to take on disgruntled vets.
[01:03:15.604 --> 01:03:17.044]  Can't you put two and two together?
[01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:18.545]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:24.527]  We're going to just open the phones up for police and military right now.
[01:03:24.527 --> 01:03:26.927]  I'm going directly to your calls after the break.
[01:03:26.927 --> 01:03:32.889]  I want to get your view on this as military, current serving military and police.
[01:03:32.889 --> 01:03:36.030]  I mean, how many of you heard me 10, 12 years ago?
[01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:38.291]  I mean, I've been syndicated for 12 years, 13 years.
[01:03:42.372 --> 01:03:46.476]  I mean, how many of you heard me on local talk stations as a guest?
[01:03:46.476 --> 01:03:53.742]  You think I do two or three interviews every day that are exhausting because I want to get my name out there?
[01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:55.684]  No, I do it because I want to warn people.
[01:03:57.182 --> 01:04:05.408]  You heard me lay out exactly what would happen, how they'd bankrupt the derivatives, how they would bring in their world government, how it'd be a global cashless SDR.
[01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.729]  You heard me tell you everything!
[01:04:07.729 --> 01:04:18.156]  All you've got to do is go read the globalist documents, and you'll know everything I know, and you'll read it from the enemy's own mouth, and it won't be, you heard Alex say it, anymore, and there won't be any more procrastination.
[01:04:18.156 --> 01:04:21.398]  We don't have time to screw around here.
[01:04:21.398 --> 01:04:23.100]  This is Hitler takeover.
[01:04:23.956 --> 01:04:25.616]  This is a Stalin takeover.
[01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:27.417]  This is a Pol Pot takeover.
[01:04:27.417 --> 01:04:30.777]  It's a Mao Zedong takeover, but it's by a corporate elite.
[01:04:30.777 --> 01:04:36.499]  So puppet presidents come and go, but this creeping death elite, they stay in power.
[01:04:36.499 --> 01:04:38.239]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:38.239 --> 01:04:46.581]  Your call straight ahead and we'll get into all the economic news, BP news, toll roads nationwide, they're coming back with the Navnet superhighways.
[01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:50.967]  Literally two years ago they were saying they weren't going to put a toll road on Mopac.
[01:04:50.967 --> 01:04:54.032]  It was a conspiracy theory when we had their official plan.
[01:04:54.032 --> 01:04:56.036]  Now they announce today they're going to do it.
[01:04:56.036 --> 01:04:57.879]  Totally shutting down the main road in Austin.
[01:04:57.879 --> 01:04:59.161]  I mean, it's just total takeover.
[01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:04.391]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:06:02.189 --> 01:06:04.390]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:07.711]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:06:07.711 --> 01:06:12.832]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:06:12.832 --> 01:06:17.013]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:19.675]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:22.557]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:06:22.557 --> 01:06:25.480]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:33.086]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:38.801]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:41.664]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:45.348]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:06:45.348 --> 01:06:46.429]  And I got news for you.
[01:06:46.429 --> 01:06:47.750]  You're everyone else.

[01:07:52.005 --> 01:07:52.405]  Thank you!
[01:08:02.006 --> 01:08:08.633]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:11.617]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.619 --> 01:08:30.900]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.921]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:31.921 --> 01:08:35.263]  High treason has been committed publicly.
[01:08:35.263 --> 01:08:39.286]  Barack Obama, the globalist, sworn to establish a North American Union.
[01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:44.549]  He took the baton from George W. Bush, the little treasonous rat who set up the North American Union.
[01:08:44.549 --> 01:08:58.479]  In the SPP documents, they say they're going to form a North American Union through border crises, that they would get the American people and Canadians and Mexicans to accept the merger of the security apparatus via crises.
[01:08:59.773 --> 01:09:06.796]  Both military, immigrant, flu, they mentioned flu, and climate change.
[01:09:06.796 --> 01:09:11.579]  A carbon tax on the highways in the Americas.
[01:09:11.579 --> 01:09:14.760]  A carbon tax to fund the new North American Union government.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.181]  This is all public.
[01:09:16.181 --> 01:09:25.285]  And I see CNN say that Rand Paul and Ron Paul are liars and no NAFTA highway plan exists, even though the mayor of Kansas City's public.
[01:09:25.285 --> 01:09:27.286]  We have all the federal maps.
[01:09:27.286 --> 01:09:29.187]  What they do is they announce it, they build it.
[01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:40.223]  They start taking over the roads, and then you come and complain, and I saw the City Council five years ago, three years ago, two years ago in Austin say, we are not putting a toll road on the existing road of Mopac.
[01:09:41.257 --> 01:09:45.999]  Even though they publicly announced it, as soon as the opposition mounted, they said, there's no fight.
[01:09:45.999 --> 01:09:47.800]  We're not going to do that now.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.641]  And they always had it planned for 2011.
[01:09:49.641 --> 01:09:54.423]  And the city council went ahead and passed it, quietly.
[01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:58.525]  Had a press conference this morning with Senator Kirk Watson, the state senator, who used to be mayor.
[01:09:58.525 --> 01:10:01.447]  And they said, we're going to take your lanes and turn it into a toll road.
[01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:02.487]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:10:02.487 --> 01:10:04.388]  You're not even going to be able to get home without it.
[01:10:04.388 --> 01:10:07.590]  Seizing already existing roads, violating federal and state law.
[01:10:10.046 --> 01:10:15.232]  That's your North American Union, and that's why Mexico is collapsing.
[01:10:15.232 --> 01:10:19.496]  Many of these border states are in deep trouble, Arizona and others.
[01:10:19.496 --> 01:10:20.658]  Sheriffs are calling for help.
[01:10:21.912 --> 01:10:32.281]  And the federal government filed suit to throw out Arizona immigration law, an act of treason, an act of incredible treachery in violation of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Amendment.
[01:10:32.281 --> 01:10:35.644]  I shot a key video last night that Aaron is working on right now.
[01:10:35.644 --> 01:10:42.990]  It'll be up by the end of the show on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a 10-minute video that breaks all of this treason down.
[01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:46.273]  Now, you dovetail that with the fact that the military
[01:10:47.554 --> 01:11:06.548]  The government that runs our military thinks you're so stupid, and thinks our military's so stupid, that they admit in AP, Reuters, Fox, CNN, and ABC News, this is just what I've seen, that our troops guard the opium and help grow it, and that productions weigh up to be friends with the Afghan people.
[01:11:06.548 --> 01:11:12.853]  They are shipping the drugs, 500 billion a year, into the United States alone.
[01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:14.614]  500 billion comes out of Afghanistan and opium.
[01:11:14.614 --> 01:11:15.715]  Some of it gets split up into Europe.
[01:11:16.952 --> 01:11:21.093]  There's another 500 billion total in just all the drugs that come into the US.
[01:11:21.093 --> 01:11:29.136]  So that number is similar to the total amount of opium coming out, but you count the cocaine, the heroin, all the other drugs that come in illegally, it's estimated at 500 billion.
[01:11:29.136 --> 01:11:30.116]  Of course they run it.
[01:11:30.116 --> 01:11:36.918]  There's always CIA aircraft crashing or, you know, in hurricanes full of cocaine.
[01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:43.480]  Bloomberg just reported and Wells Fargo pled guilty to laundering drug money, having drug planes.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.340]  Of course they do!
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.903]  I mean, who do you think runs this country?
[01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:49.567]  They've got to keep it illegal to keep the stinking price up.
[01:11:49.567 --> 01:11:56.859]  And now, to fight drugs, they've got checkpoints searching your vehicles with National Guard in Illinois and New York.
[01:11:56.859 --> 01:11:59.404]  Not on the border, but in the middle of the country.
[01:12:01.502 --> 01:12:03.862]  I already went over this, but I know new stations just joined us.
[01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:06.183]  I just can't get over the magnitude of this.
[01:12:06.183 --> 01:12:08.643]  We are not allowed to defend our border that's in the Constitution.
[01:12:08.643 --> 01:12:10.344]  That's what the military is supposed to be.
[01:12:10.344 --> 01:12:19.406]  Our military isn't allowed to be armed on the border, but I have had armed National Guard come running from 50 yards away or even more, cussing at me.
[01:12:19.406 --> 01:12:24.907]  It's on video, in endgame, telling me to turn my bleeping camera off and that I can't film them.
[01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:25.687]  And I stood up to them.
[01:12:26.621 --> 01:12:31.562]  I screamed at him and called him treasonous traitors and get out of my face and what are you doing armed on the streets?
[01:12:31.562 --> 01:12:32.962]  But see, I'm an enemy.
[01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:36.983]  I'm an American scumbag, so they're allowed to have that 45 against me.
[01:12:36.983 --> 01:12:42.384]  But as soon as you retire, and as soon as you're done doing your job, you are now the enemy.
[01:12:42.384 --> 01:12:43.024]  Remember that.
[01:12:43.024 --> 01:12:45.484]  The main training is for you.
[01:12:45.484 --> 01:12:46.965]  You remember that.
[01:12:46.965 --> 01:12:47.885]  And who broke it?
[01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:48.345]  We did!
[01:12:48.345 --> 01:12:51.646]  And I'm not bragging, I'm saying we've got credibility.
[01:12:51.646 --> 01:12:53.306]  We know exactly what's going on.
[01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:58.732]  People always say, well, if this bad stuff was happening, people blow the whistle.
[01:12:58.732 --> 01:13:03.296]  They blow the whistle 15 years ago about the secret DNA they take from babies.
[01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.138]  They blew the whistle decades ago about the government shipping in narcotics.
[01:13:06.138 --> 01:13:07.379]  It happened in Vietnam.
[01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:08.359]  It happened in the 80s.
[01:13:08.359 --> 01:13:12.883]  After that, everything gets the whistle blown on it.
[01:13:12.883 --> 01:13:16.105]  Barry Jennings was the deputy head of New York Emergency Management.
[01:13:16.105 --> 01:13:18.067]  We got an interview with him for fabled enemies.
[01:13:18.067 --> 01:13:22.630]  And then he called us and said, my gosh, since you aired that, I'm getting threats.
[01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:23.731]  And he was dead a week later.
[01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:29.872]  You think this is a game, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:33.515]  This isn't a game!
[01:13:33.515 --> 01:13:35.137]  These bankers are going to hurt you bad.
[01:13:35.137 --> 01:13:36.198]  They're already hurting you.
[01:13:36.198 --> 01:13:37.980]  You like losing your job, getting your pay cut?
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.241]  You ain't seen nothing yet!
[01:13:39.241 --> 01:13:42.704]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to Levi, Bill, Bobby, Brandon.
[01:13:42.704 --> 01:13:45.447]  I want to talk to military and police.
[01:13:45.447 --> 01:13:46.387]  Okay?
[01:13:46.387 --> 01:13:47.889]  What side are you on?
[01:13:47.889 --> 01:13:49.651]  What are you going to do about what's happening?
[01:13:50.575 --> 01:13:51.895]  I mean, do you disagree with me?
[01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.936]  I mean, it's out in the open now.
[01:13:53.936 --> 01:13:56.176]  Levi in Georgia, who's a police officer.
[01:13:56.176 --> 01:13:56.736]  Go ahead, Levi.
[01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:58.256]  Thanks for calling.
[01:13:58.256 --> 01:14:01.077]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:14:01.077 --> 01:14:08.438]  I'm a policeman that sits in my patrol car on many a night listening to your rebroadcast, and I don't laugh at you.
[01:14:08.438 --> 01:14:11.199]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[01:14:11.199 --> 01:14:13.559]  Well, I appreciate you, and God bless you, sir.
[01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:18.640]  And a lot of other officers out there, they are, a lot of them have got that
[01:14:19.802 --> 01:14:21.343]  Uh, Gestapo type mentality.
[01:14:21.343 --> 01:14:21.883]  Type med.
[01:14:21.883 --> 01:14:22.903]  I work with some.
[01:14:22.903 --> 01:14:29.165]  And it's just a constant battle to try to keep, uh, from quitting.
[01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:37.667]  Um, because that, that slow creep, you know, uh, military type creep that keeps coming to local law enforcement.
[01:14:37.667 --> 01:14:49.371]  But the way I look at it, if, if I don't, if I were to quit and get out of the, uh, law enforcement profession, then I'll just be opening up my slot for another one of these Gestapo types.
[01:14:50.816 --> 01:15:06.823]  So the only thing I do is when I make a stop, I try to treat someone like I would myself, my wife, my daughter treated, and I try to provide an example for some of the other ones that are more gung-ho, that ride a lot of tickets for stuff that
[01:15:08.352 --> 01:15:27.745]  It's good to have officers like you out there, and I run into a lot of them, and the directors of this planetary regime worldwide are trying to hire people that think it's macho to bully people.
[01:15:27.745 --> 01:15:34.609]  But I understand that you're a dying breed, but there's still a lot of good officers out there, and a lot of them are waking up.
[01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:46.357]  But what is your take on all over the country, regular Army, Marines, National Guard now, aiding the police in the quote, search for guns?
[01:15:46.357 --> 01:15:59.044]  Well, police in the South, you know, in the South and like some of the other states, particularly the Northeast region, you know, they've got a pretty good pro-gun laws on the book.
[01:15:59.044 --> 01:16:04.768]  I just see, and a lot of the police officers I know are, you know, NRA members and
[01:16:05.484 --> 01:16:06.725]  I don't think so.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:30.840]  I don't
[01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:56.231]  And Illinois, they'll go ahead and arrest the old man and say, you had 10 guns and 2,000 rounds of ammo.
[01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:59.233]  This is an arsenal when there's not even a law.
[01:16:59.233 --> 01:17:06.779]  And so that's what's scary, is we know what the gun grabbers want from New York, in Illinois, and places where they're in control.
[01:17:06.779 --> 01:17:09.682]  They want the law-abiding citizens' guns.
[01:17:09.682 --> 01:17:10.883]  Levi, God bless you.
[01:17:10.883 --> 01:17:12.244]  Good to hear from you.
[01:17:12.244 --> 01:17:14.345]  Let's get Bill in Montana, who's police.
[01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:17.748]  Let's get Bill's take, then Bobby, Brandon, Kurt, and others.
[01:17:17.748 --> 01:17:18.309]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:17:19.563 --> 01:17:28.168]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for about six months, and I just wanted to say that you were my second greatest awakening.
[01:17:28.168 --> 01:17:31.290]  The word of God, the King James Bible was the first.
[01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:33.752]  And I was listening to your broadcast the other day.
[01:17:33.752 --> 01:17:35.713]  I'm an ex-cop here in Billings, Montana.
[01:17:36.516 --> 01:17:37.156]  It's all part of the training.
[01:17:37.156 --> 01:17:38.777]  It's all part of acclimation.
[01:17:57.065 --> 01:17:58.546]  Well, see, I'm from Alabama.
[01:17:58.546 --> 01:18:00.727]  I've lived here in Montana for 10 years.
[01:18:00.727 --> 01:18:04.289]  And I was a cop down there and I got out of that police state 10 years ago.
[01:18:04.289 --> 01:18:09.851]  I mean, here in Montana, I guess you could call it the promised land of America because there's no taxes.
[01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:14.694]  And if there is a free place, I would say Montana really is the last free place.
[01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:17.715]  That's where people maybe could make a stand.
[01:18:17.715 --> 01:18:18.716]  But they're just everywhere up here.
[01:18:18.716 --> 01:18:20.997]  I've just never seen nothing like it, ever.
[01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:23.098]  And they've got them at checkpoints checking them.
[01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.799]  I mean, military armed gunmen.
[01:18:25.387 --> 01:18:26.628]  No, I saw that.
[01:18:26.628 --> 01:18:28.909]  I saw local newscasts and never even got to it.
[01:18:28.909 --> 01:18:42.099]  I mentioned it last week or two weeks ago that it showed men with guns at checkpoints and even I got conditioned that that's normal because I didn't even respond to it on air.
[01:18:43.567 --> 01:18:47.452]  Because at a subconscious level, I'm now becoming acclimated and programmed.
[01:18:47.452 --> 01:18:50.055]  And the message is, Montanans are bad.
[01:18:50.055 --> 01:18:51.798]  We had a few buildings torn up.
[01:18:51.798 --> 01:18:56.364]  We better set up checkpoints or these Montanans are gonna all rob each other.
[01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:58.707]  The message is, we're criminals.
[01:18:58.707 --> 01:19:00.089]  But what did we see the police...
[01:19:01.328 --> 01:19:03.649]  Predominantly do in New Orleans.
[01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:05.851]  We saw them being the main looters.
[01:19:05.851 --> 01:19:08.112]  And I'm not saying all police are looters.
[01:19:08.112 --> 01:19:11.014]  The point is, who watches the watchers?
[01:19:11.014 --> 01:19:17.358]  Because statistically, it is government that becomes abusive because it can get away with it.
[01:19:17.358 --> 01:19:27.404]  I mean, that's why we do need some police and some control, because history shows if bad people aren't worried about getting caught, they're gonna run wild.
[01:19:27.404 --> 01:19:28.225]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:19:28.945 --> 01:19:30.926]  The government's not worried about getting caught.
[01:19:30.926 --> 01:19:32.126]  They're running wild.
[01:19:32.126 --> 01:19:33.747]  No one's watching them.
[01:19:33.747 --> 01:19:35.427]  Anything else, Bill?
[01:19:35.427 --> 01:19:36.168]  Well, no, you're right.
[01:19:36.168 --> 01:19:37.508]  They're not worried about getting caught.
[01:19:37.508 --> 01:19:42.150]  They're just going to do what they tried to do in 1945 or 39 and set up their one world government.
[01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:43.991]  You know, they tried to do it through Hitler, didn't they?
[01:19:43.991 --> 01:19:48.372]  And he moved too fast with the genocides and they pulled it back away from him and blamed it all on him.
[01:19:48.372 --> 01:19:49.313]  But that's what they're trying to do.
[01:19:49.313 --> 01:19:50.273]  They're going to go for broke.
[01:19:50.273 --> 01:19:52.114]  And, you know, I've just never seen nothing like it.
[01:19:52.114 --> 01:19:53.314]  I thought Montana was free.
[01:19:53.314 --> 01:19:57.416]  And I remember you running the hardened people that were running the FEMA camps off up here.
[01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:58.736]  God bless you, sir.
[01:19:58.736 --> 01:19:59.697]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:19:59.697 --> 01:20:00.757]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.757 --> 01:20:03.279]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:20:03.279 --> 01:20:06.840]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:15.324]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:20:15.324 --> 01:20:20.807]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:20:20.807 --> 01:20:25.909]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:20:26.429 --> 01:20:34.475]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[01:20:34.475 --> 01:20:39.939]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:20:39.939 --> 01:20:41.140]  Our foods are their enemy.

[01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:09.876]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:09.876 --> 01:22:16.319]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:16.319 --> 01:22:25.164]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:25.544 --> 01:22:34.733]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:34.733 --> 01:22:39.338]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:39.338 --> 01:22:41.139]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:41.139 --> 01:22:43.642]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:22:52.313 --> 01:22:52.693]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.662 --> 01:23:00.643]  Here's a question.
[01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:06.846]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[01:23:06.846 --> 01:23:08.227]  The answer is simple.
[01:23:08.227 --> 01:23:12.330]  Use septic system injector treatments made specifically for your home or business.
[01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:15.432]  Available only at SimpleSepticSolutions.com.

[01:23:41.897 --> 01:23:44.039]  Claims other products can't make.
[01:23:44.039 --> 01:23:46.763]  Installation is simple and lasts for four full months.
[01:23:47.043 --> 01:23:49.385]  Visit SimpleSepticSolutions.com.
[01:23:49.385 --> 01:23:50.967]  That's SimpleSepticSolutions.com.
[01:23:50.967 --> 01:23:51.647]  Or call 508-759-0010.
[01:23:51.647 --> 01:23:51.868]  That's 508-759-0010.
[01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:05.686]  Hitler moved too fast.
[01:24:05.686 --> 01:24:29.745]  When you actually read globalist white papers, they talk about how they've got this creeping scientific dictatorship, where they've taken decades to slowly militarize the police, acclimate the public for the police and military to be merged, and now roll the police and military out on the streets as political officers, recording what you say and what you do politically, and stopping you and asking you questions.
[01:24:31.354 --> 01:24:38.016]  And having private security people snatch citizens off the street and throw bags over their heads and throw them into cars.
[01:24:38.016 --> 01:24:41.978]  That happened in Pittsburgh and Toronto in the last year.
[01:24:41.978 --> 01:24:46.360]  Worldwide, the same system, done in the same steps.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:55.303]  Admittedly, I mean, I've got the RAND Corporation documents where they talk about a private police force nationwide run by the feds and then a Pentagon police force.
[01:24:55.303 --> 01:24:57.424]  And they talk about it out in the future in a few years.
[01:24:57.424 --> 01:24:58.104]  It's already there.
[01:24:59.793 --> 01:25:03.037]  And I remember, what was it?
[01:25:03.037 --> 01:25:10.325]  Six years ago, it's in my film Matrix of Evil, mainstream news with the governor of Wisconsin said, oh yes, we're here at the Threat Fusion Center.
[01:25:10.325 --> 01:25:14.970]  We can dial in someone's name and track them in real time and listen to them over their phone.
[01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:18.715]  And it was actually in the news that his handler said, governor, don't tell them that.
[01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:23.027]  They're tracking you, they dial your name in and listen to you.
[01:25:23.027 --> 01:25:25.549]  No warrant, no nothing, totally illegal.
[01:25:25.549 --> 01:25:28.131]  And of course, most police haven't been told this yet.
[01:25:28.131 --> 01:25:36.138]  I remember six, seven years ago, cops laughing at me on the street going, Alex, are the face scanning cameras, are the license plate cameras gonna get me?
[01:25:36.138 --> 01:25:37.520]  I was in the coffee room.
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:44.983]  Three minutes ago, and they had Fox News on live, reporting that, oh, all over the country, we're tracking your license plates now.
[01:25:44.983 --> 01:25:48.404]  See, they're just suddenly announcing everything to you.
[01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:52.025]  Bobby in Oklahoma, police, then Brandon, Kurt, and others.
[01:25:52.025 --> 01:25:55.487]  Go ahead, Bobby.
[01:25:55.487 --> 01:25:56.287]  Bobby, you still there?
[01:25:56.287 --> 01:25:59.408]  Hello?
[01:25:59.408 --> 01:26:00.809]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:26:00.809 --> 01:26:01.809]  How's it going?
[01:26:01.809 --> 01:26:02.870]  It's going all right, sir.
[01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:03.190]  Welcome.
[01:26:04.448 --> 01:26:05.308]  Thank you.
[01:26:05.308 --> 01:26:12.270]  First thing, I'm a cop, or I have been a cop in a real small town, so I ain't seen none of the real big stuff that's going on like you say.
[01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:15.971]  Uh, I want to hit on a couple things and ask you a question.
[01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:25.594]  The biggest thing we've seen was, uh, right here where I'm at, a lot of people have old vehicles and stuff, and the city and surrounding cities
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:39.409]  I know the police chief and everyone real good down here I went down there and raised a bunch of crap you know and and pretty much got that took care of but uh you talking about billboards a little bit ago we got some pretty cool billboards up around here one of them says uh
[01:26:52.603 --> 01:26:53.664]  Government, now it's personal.
[01:26:53.664 --> 01:26:54.964]  We're coming after you.
[01:26:54.964 --> 01:26:58.366]  They're on Facebook and everything, too.
[01:26:58.366 --> 01:27:00.367]  If you want to get on there and see some of them, they're pretty neat.
[01:27:00.367 --> 01:27:00.948]  Say that again.
[01:27:00.948 --> 01:27:03.769]  What do the billboards say?
[01:27:03.769 --> 01:27:05.110]  Government, now it's personal.
[01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:06.871]  We're coming after you.
[01:27:06.871 --> 01:27:11.794]  And they're right here on the highways and everything.
[01:27:11.794 --> 01:27:13.115]  Amazing.
[01:27:13.115 --> 01:27:20.439]  The other police officers you talked to, I mean, are they aware that all over the country they're quietly having the military engage in gun confiscations?
[01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:29.968]  Our biggest thing around here is I got a lot of real close friends that are cops and that ain't cops, and I argue with my buddies.
[01:27:29.968 --> 01:27:33.190]  I make them so mad arguing with them about this stuff.
[01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:45.258]  I'm new to listening to you, but I've been checking into this stuff for a while, and I get in a lot of arguments, but a lot of them are starting to see what I'm talking about and seeing I'm not messing around with it and seeing that I'm right.
[01:27:45.258 --> 01:27:50.601]  But the question I had is, and you might have touched on this before, I'm not sure, but
[01:27:51.545 --> 01:27:56.926]  Why can't we take the facts and start getting justice done on this through courts?
[01:27:56.926 --> 01:27:58.026]  I agree!
[01:27:58.026 --> 01:28:06.668]  Well, a lot of this stuff is getting overturned in court, but the federal government is so illegitimate, they just will continue to do something even after it's been ruled unconstitutional.
[01:28:06.668 --> 01:28:09.068]  And so the country is waking up.
[01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:14.089]  And if the country does fully wake up, these bankers that have done this are going to go to prison.
[01:28:14.089 --> 01:28:17.850]  And so that's what makes them so dangerous, is they're holding us hostage.
[01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:26.716]  With the border being opened, they're holding us hostage with the financial terrorism, where they can destroy our economy at any time.
[01:28:26.716 --> 01:28:32.159]  They're holding us hostage with terrorist groups they've been financing and protecting and opening the door to.
[01:28:32.159 --> 01:28:35.801]  You know, they don't just stage terror, they let terrorists attack us.
[01:28:35.801 --> 01:28:37.982]  And they've been, so they're so dangerous.
[01:28:37.982 --> 01:28:45.947]  We have to really grow up and face just how out of control these people are and how sneaky they are.
[01:28:45.947 --> 01:28:47.828]  And I know I keep harping on that, but think about it.
[01:28:48.715 --> 01:29:04.344]  For 38 years, in every Western nation, there has been a secret UN slash military program, it's run by the UN internationally, but the military implements it through universities at the national level, to take baby's blood for a secret database.
[01:29:04.344 --> 01:29:16.952]  I mean, right there, this is a creepy, sneaky, evil group, and you use just that one little example that's finally mainstream news, and you expand on it, and then you read the writings of these controllers,
[01:29:18.035 --> 01:29:24.437]  I mean, I think the biggest thing to wake people up is you can bring them mainstream articles about GMO sterilizing them, the plastic sterilizing them.
[01:29:24.437 --> 01:29:30.080]  You can bring them John P. Holdren, White House science czar documents where he admits they're sterilizing us by design.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.922]  I mean, what government individual or cop or school teacher or anybody who influences people
[01:29:37.043 --> 01:29:41.167]  Who wouldn't wake up to that and say, man, this is really an out-of-control group?
[01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:41.708]  God bless you.
[01:29:41.708 --> 01:29:43.890]  I appreciate your call, Bobby.
[01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:47.213]  Brandon in the military, Kurt in the military, and others.
[01:29:47.213 --> 01:29:50.917]  Your calls are coming up, and so is Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:50.917 --> 01:29:52.318]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.318 --> 01:29:54.841]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:57.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.393 --> 01:30:05.356]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:30:05.356 --> 01:30:06.357]  What have we got?
[01:30:06.357 --> 01:30:08.798]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:30:08.798 --> 01:30:09.799]  A republic.
[01:30:09.799 --> 01:30:12.461]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:30:12.461 --> 01:30:14.722]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:30:14.722 --> 01:30:16.743]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:30:16.743 --> 01:30:18.424]  So they think they own our land?
[01:30:18.424 --> 01:30:19.745]  They think they own our water?
[01:30:19.745 --> 01:30:20.345]  Children?
[01:30:20.345 --> 01:30:21.466]  Our education?
[01:30:21.466 --> 01:30:22.287]  Our money?
[01:30:22.287 --> 01:30:25.949]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:30:26.309 --> 01:30:29.994]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:30:29.994 --> 01:30:31.296]  You are being warned.
[01:30:31.296 --> 01:30:32.317]  We have the facts.
[01:30:32.317 --> 01:30:33.479]  We have the Constitution.
[01:30:33.479 --> 01:30:34.380]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:35.261]  We have common law.
[01:30:35.261 --> 01:30:37.785]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:37.785 --> 01:30:41.570]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:46.635]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:30:46.635 --> 01:30:48.136]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:30:48.136 --> 01:30:49.217]  Don't tread on me.
[01:30:49.217 --> 01:30:55.283]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:04.750]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:05.650]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:09.072]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.072 --> 01:31:09.952]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.952 --> 01:31:14.834]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:15.574]  It's true.
[01:31:15.574 --> 01:31:20.437]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.437 --> 01:31:21.277]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.277 --> 01:31:24.858]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.858 --> 01:31:28.560]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.560]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.321]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:36.002]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.002 --> 01:31:36.783]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:40.944]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.944 --> 01:31:45.986]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.986 --> 01:31:50.167]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.167 --> 01:31:51.947]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:56.869 --> 01:31:56.909]  877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:01.764]  Listen up, folks, this is important.
[01:32:01.764 --> 01:32:02.884]  Alex Jones here.
[01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:08.907]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy-to-fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:08.907 --> 01:32:17.050]  From July 4th through July 14th, we have looming evacuations in the Southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.
[01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.371]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[01:32:19.371 --> 01:32:22.532]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[01:32:22.532 --> 01:32:27.414]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.

[01:33:14.342 --> 01:33:18.383]  All right, in about three minutes we're going to Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:33:18.383 --> 01:33:22.985]  Of course, he worked for the National Security Agency for the Navy and Security.
[01:33:22.985 --> 01:33:32.988]  He's written for some of the biggest publications in the country, and we're honored to have him joining us because he's got a lot of intel on plans for evacuations in the Gulf.
[01:33:32.988 --> 01:33:42.471]  We now see Council on Foreign Relations members and others who are in the news, like the Washington Post, saying that they may
[01:33:43.371 --> 01:33:46.714]  Have an evacuation of 20 million people when that oil comes ashore.
[01:33:46.714 --> 01:34:00.505]  But I wanted to finish up with Brandon and Kurt, both in the military, and then we'll continue into the next hour discussing this headline, New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscation.
[01:34:00.505 --> 01:34:06.489]  So now they're in Illinois, California, you name it, engaging in gun confiscation.
[01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:07.790]  We're good to go.
[01:34:21.517 --> 01:34:24.698]  Yes Alex, thank you for having me on and thank you for what you do.
[01:34:24.698 --> 01:34:27.079]  I'm going to talk real quick because I know you don't have much time.
[01:34:27.079 --> 01:34:28.739]  I was stationed in San Diego.
[01:34:28.739 --> 01:34:30.520]  I've purchased all your DVDs.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.861]  I've showed my command, like a lot of people at my command that I work with.
[01:34:34.861 --> 01:34:36.241]  I've woken a lot of people up.
[01:34:36.241 --> 01:34:38.242]  My apartment complex there, I've woken a lot of people up.
[01:34:38.242 --> 01:34:40.263]  Now I'm stationed in Virginia.
[01:34:40.263 --> 01:34:42.543]  I've woke up my whole entire street.
[01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:44.724]  And even my cable man, I mentioned something.
[01:34:44.724 --> 01:34:47.125]  I just got home, he was hooking this stuff up.
[01:34:47.125 --> 01:34:47.925]  I had my uniform on.
[01:34:48.465 --> 01:34:54.515]  He said, thank you, thank you so much for you and your stature, because I was wearing my uniform.
[01:34:54.515 --> 01:34:59.803]  That, uh, I would talk, because most people would put him down and call him a conspiracy theorist and stuff like that.
[01:35:00.387 --> 01:35:06.809]  Well, that's their rationalization to not defend America, but it's now admitted world government's here.
[01:35:06.809 --> 01:35:12.090]  It's now admitted a private banking takeover is happening, and they're creating a new global currency.
[01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:14.751]  But you are saying you have had a good response?
[01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:18.192]  What percentage of people were favorable on the military base?
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.642]  Actually, I got about 8 out of 10.
[01:35:21.642 --> 01:35:29.588]  Actually, one of my current co-workers actually called me a terrorist himself, and I was like, you don't even get it, but I had help from the other co-workers.
[01:35:29.588 --> 01:35:35.453]  So you're a terrorist because you believe that there's corrupt elements in the government that are taking our freedom?
[01:35:35.453 --> 01:35:43.800]  I mean, as a member of the military, you're supposed to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, and you're supposed to follow the Constitution.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:44.280]  Yep, yep.
[01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:47.732]  Quick, two quick more things.
[01:35:47.732 --> 01:35:56.078]  That cable guy is actually going to come by this week and burn a couple of your discs, copy a couple of your videos so we can show it to his family.
[01:35:56.078 --> 01:36:01.361]  And the last one, I'm part of the oil response team and we're gearing up.
[01:36:01.361 --> 01:36:05.804]  We're leaving next week to the Gulf and a couple of other guys are leaving in a couple of weeks to the Gulf.
[01:36:08.077 --> 01:36:13.779]  They said they're going to issue us desert uniforms, desert camo uniforms.
[01:36:13.779 --> 01:36:16.440]  That's kind of dumb since we all have uniforms.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.081]  For some reason they're going to do that.
[01:36:18.081 --> 01:36:21.702]  I asked about respirators and they said that was no need.
[01:36:21.702 --> 01:36:26.164]  So, I'm going to finish up with this.
[01:36:26.164 --> 01:36:29.485]  Not only does the government have boots on the ground, but you've got boots on the ground too, Alex.
[01:36:29.485 --> 01:36:31.666]  And I'll definitely keep you guys informed and updated.
[01:36:32.145 --> 01:36:33.146]  Absolutely.
[01:36:33.146 --> 01:36:35.427]  Wonderful information, Brandon.
[01:36:35.427 --> 01:36:37.168]  I mean, very powerful information.
[01:36:37.168 --> 01:36:45.114]  We have so many military people calling us and snipers, intelligence officers, engineers, which makes sense.
[01:36:45.114 --> 01:36:46.635]  Engineers being sent to the Gulf.
[01:36:46.635 --> 01:36:48.196]  Regular Army.
[01:36:48.196 --> 01:36:50.978]  And they're now talking about possible evacuation.
[01:36:50.978 --> 01:36:55.421]  We're talking to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment about that.
[01:36:55.421 --> 01:36:57.342]  But yeah, they're on record.
[01:36:57.342 --> 01:37:00.264]  BP is on record saying no respirators are needed.
[01:37:00.264 --> 01:37:01.605]  There's no toxic fumes.
[01:37:02.505 --> 01:37:05.887]  Because if they admit there's toxic fumes, they would then be liable.
[01:37:05.887 --> 01:37:07.548]  Everyone knows there's toxic fumes.
[01:37:07.548 --> 01:37:11.469]  The average life expectancy of Exxon Valdez workers is 51 years.
[01:37:11.469 --> 01:37:16.752]  The government admits that from the dioxin and toxins and benzene in the oil and the dispersants.
[01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:24.418]  And so a lot of these people have already died or they're in the hospital and that's why they're saying nobody can videotape, nobody can talk to these workers.
[01:37:24.418 --> 01:37:28.581]  They send them to BP hospitals, BP clinics.
[01:37:28.581 --> 01:37:31.563]  I mean, this is one hell of a cover-up.
[01:37:31.563 --> 01:37:34.846]  We're going to Wayne Madsen to get his inside scoop on that in just a moment.
[01:37:34.846 --> 01:37:36.808]  Finishing up with Kurt and we're going right to Wayne.
[01:37:36.808 --> 01:37:38.849]  Kurt in Deutschland, who's in the Army.
[01:37:38.849 --> 01:37:40.551]  Welcome, Kurt.
[01:37:40.551 --> 01:37:41.311]  Hello, sir.
[01:37:41.311 --> 01:37:43.353]  Hello, go ahead.
[01:37:43.353 --> 01:37:46.856]  Real quick, I just wanted to tell you with all the chemicals you talk about on your show,
[01:37:47.586 --> 01:37:57.138]  I do a lot of research on them and one of the things I've been using to sort of open people's eyes a little bit when they don't believe me is the material safety data sheets.
[01:37:58.297 --> 01:38:03.822]  All these chemicals, any chemical made has material safety data sheets made by the companies that make them.
[01:38:03.822 --> 01:38:04.703]  Oh, that's a great point.
[01:38:04.703 --> 01:38:09.908]  So for sodium fluoride, you show them the skull and crossbones, the organ failure, the sterilization.
[01:38:09.908 --> 01:38:12.130]  For the silicone, they put in chicken McNuggets.
[01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:15.713]  You can show them the data sheet on that, how deadly it is.
[01:38:15.713 --> 01:38:20.397]  For all these chemicals they put in our food and water, you can show them the documents.
[01:38:20.397 --> 01:38:21.358]  That's a great way to do it.
[01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:28.858]  Yeah, and I think the funniest thing is the reaction you get, because first they start laughing when you start telling them, yeah, sodium fluoride's poisonous.
[01:38:28.858 --> 01:38:33.782]  They're laughing, so I come back with the material safety data sheet and put it on the table, like, it's poisonous.
[01:38:33.782 --> 01:38:35.283]  There you go.
[01:38:35.283 --> 01:38:41.128]  But, uh, and I just wanted to say, uh, there is a lot of people waking up in the military.
[01:38:41.128 --> 01:38:41.748]  I'm in the Army.
[01:38:41.748 --> 01:38:44.150]  I'm stationed in Ilsan, Germany.
[01:38:44.150 --> 01:38:48.974]  And, uh, I have the show on while I'm at work, and I talk to a lot of people about it.
[01:38:48.974 --> 01:38:51.276]  And everybody I talk to says that they're not going to
[01:38:52.539 --> 01:38:56.663]  They're not going to take guns from American citizens, from unarmed civilians.
[01:38:56.663 --> 01:38:59.226]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:38:59.226 --> 01:39:04.210]  Well, I know most of the military and police I talk to say that.
[01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:06.813]  The problem is we saw what happened in Katrina.
[01:39:06.813 --> 01:39:08.394]  Most of them did follow the orders.
[01:39:08.394 --> 01:39:13.038]  So individually they're saying no, but in that group think they're following orders.
[01:39:13.038 --> 01:39:15.621]  That's why we need to have this debate and discussion now.
[01:39:15.621 --> 01:39:16.802]  But what do you think about this?
[01:39:17.202 --> 01:39:24.606]  I just don't understand how people, I mean it's going on all around you that I try to tell people that just look around you when I'm talking to people when I call the states back home.
[01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:48.318]  I'm tired of telling, like, if you don't believe me, just look around you, read the news, like, read anything.
[01:39:48.318 --> 01:39:50.882]  How can you not see this happening right in front of you?
[01:39:50.882 --> 01:39:51.723]  God bless you, Kurt.
[01:39:51.723 --> 01:39:52.344]  Good to hear from you.
[01:39:52.344 --> 01:39:53.546]  Here's an example.
[01:39:53.546 --> 01:39:56.992]  I was driving to my parents this weekend with my children.
[01:39:58.642 --> 01:39:58.822]  And I
[01:40:16.297 --> 01:40:17.838]  Again, I'm just having a flashback to this.
[01:40:17.838 --> 01:40:23.702]  I saw the fire department, military, and police all running around doing some hazmat drill.
[01:40:23.702 --> 01:40:28.065]  And I didn't have time to pull over and even look at it because I had that limited time with my family.
[01:40:28.065 --> 01:40:30.887]  But that's just an example how it's just going on everywhere.
[01:40:30.887 --> 01:40:34.269]  And it seems reasonable to have the military training with police.
[01:40:34.269 --> 01:40:37.531]  But then they always have it first, oh, we're doing hazmat drills.
[01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:40.253]  And then next, we're gonna help you get the guns.
[01:40:40.253 --> 01:40:45.617]  And by the way, I have from 1998 the internal army documents from Fort Hood.
[01:40:46.697 --> 01:40:54.542]  Uh, that are in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover, where they admit we are here for bomb disposal and for anti-firearms operations.
[01:40:54.542 --> 01:40:57.304]  So this has been going on quietly in the background.
[01:40:57.304 --> 01:41:06.570]  Now it's coming to the fore, because they know it's almost impossible to defeat something that slowly infiltrates, that slowly takes over.
[01:41:07.392 --> 01:41:12.096]  All right, Wayne Madsen of Wayne Madsen Report is our guest.
[01:41:12.096 --> 01:41:22.285]  Wayne's always given us really good intel, and we just heard a military man say that he's being deployed from Virginia, regular Army, down to the Gulf.
[01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:25.848]  And we now see the Washington Post talking about 20 million evacuated.
[01:41:25.848 --> 01:41:30.632]  Wayne Madsen, from your intelligence agency sources in D.C.
[01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:33.775]  and from your sources there at the Press Club, what's the inside scoop?
[01:41:34.665 --> 01:41:40.588]  Well, I reported back in May that there were plans to evacuate millions of people.
[01:41:40.588 --> 01:41:45.130]  The first people to be evacuated would be those who have respiratory problems.
[01:41:45.130 --> 01:42:01.099]  I know several who are now seeing BP doctors who are saying there's a number of people coming into these BP medical facilities, complaining of respiratory ailments, and some have been diagnosed with what's known as chemical pneumonia.
[01:42:01.819 --> 01:42:10.945]  I know one person who actually has been diagnosed with that by BP, and now people's pets are beginning to suffer from the same ailment.
[01:42:10.945 --> 01:42:16.249]  So, we have basically BP engaged in a huge PR operation.
[01:42:16.249 --> 01:42:27.917]  They've hired every big-time PR firm here in Washington, and I'm surprised that the Washington Post is even hinting at evacuation, because one of the problems we're seeing with the press
[01:42:28.877 --> 01:42:42.483]  Is that their editors are contacting their legal department because these companies that own the media may have vested interests with BP or Halliburton or these other companies involved in this oil disaster.
[01:42:42.483 --> 01:42:44.124]  And I think that's a problem.
[01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:46.865]  And that's why next week I'm going to the Gulf because
[01:42:47.785 --> 01:42:50.568]  I want to see for myself what's going on down there.
[01:42:50.568 --> 01:42:55.811]  There's been reports of journalists and photojournalists being arrested.
[01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:56.952]  So I'm going down there.
[01:42:56.952 --> 01:43:00.275]  I'll be in Plaquemine Parish.
[01:43:00.275 --> 01:43:11.823]  I'll go over to Alabama, Mississippi and Pensacola Beach to see firsthand what's going on and I will document with photos and interviews and whatnot what I find out.
[01:43:11.823 --> 01:43:15.006]  Wayne, expanding on that because you did
[01:43:16.374 --> 01:43:22.198]  Over a month and a half ago, you were one of the first people that I saw start talking about how they were going to evacuate the Gulf.
[01:43:22.198 --> 01:43:27.441]  I want to flesh that out and talk more about what your sources there in D.C.
[01:43:27.441 --> 01:43:46.214]  are telling you, but specifically all the evidence I have says that this was deliberately blown, that they gave orders to Anadarko and Halliburton that they knew would cause the well to come in early and to spill, and that it is a pretext to sell the carbon tax that BP and Enron founded
[01:43:47.235 --> 01:43:47.335]  Yes.
[01:44:02.814 --> 01:44:04.035]  It'll be 80 days tomorrow.
[01:44:32.994 --> 01:44:35.718]  Well, I have a story up today.
[01:44:35.718 --> 01:44:41.366]  The company that was hired by BP to do the third party was called Mudlogging.
[01:44:41.366 --> 01:44:48.375]  This is where they analyze all the sediment and rock material incrementally coming up.
[01:44:48.375 --> 01:44:49.497]  And this was the deepest
[01:44:50.999 --> 01:44:51.600]  We're good to go.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.241]  Keep drilling.
[01:45:13.241 --> 01:45:17.662]  The Schlumberger engineers said, look, this thing is getting ready to go.
[01:45:17.662 --> 01:45:28.785]  There's an internal Schlumberger document that shows that their crew was out there and left that platform, the Deepwater Horizon, a little after 9 o'clock in the morning.
[01:45:28.785 --> 01:45:33.947]  And that, of course, the explosion was later on that evening.
[01:45:33.947 --> 01:45:37.408]  So we know this from documented evidence that
[01:45:37.788 --> 01:45:44.826]  Well yeah, we have the Coast Guard report, but I mean, we even see conflicting how it was a 30,000 foot well, or it was 18,000 feet well.
[01:45:44.826 --> 01:45:46.690]  We've seen a lot of different conflicting information.
[01:45:47.324 --> 01:45:49.585]  Well, you know, it's odd.
[01:45:49.585 --> 01:45:55.007]  One of the sources that I'm getting is from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[01:45:55.007 --> 01:46:06.992]  Whoever thought after what they did with Katrina that they would be, you know, revealing inside information, but they have been bypassed by the Coast Guard and BP.
[01:46:06.992 --> 01:46:09.833]  FEMA, you know, they're rice bowl protectors.
[01:46:09.833 --> 01:46:13.495]  They are part of the Department of Homeland Security, but there are many people there who are
[01:46:13.975 --> 01:46:27.340]  I mean, where does BP get the authority to tell reporters they can't videotape and now we have the Coast Guard saying federal felonies if you even try to videotape.
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:29.260]  So they are acting very suspicious.
[01:46:42.972 --> 01:46:45.533]  Oh yeah, well, the authority comes from President Obama.
[01:46:45.533 --> 01:46:52.757]  I mean, he put this guy, Thad Allen, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, in charge as the National Incident Commander.
[01:46:52.757 --> 01:46:55.439]  His relationship with BP is very close.
[01:46:55.439 --> 01:47:01.162]  I heard a rumor that even before the disaster, he was going to get a job with BP after he retired.
[01:47:01.162 --> 01:47:06.385]  Now, he's still, you know, he's Obama's Brownie, except I think he's more insidious.
[01:47:06.385 --> 01:47:07.966]  Brownie was a total incompetent.
[01:47:08.526 --> 01:47:11.309]  Pat Allen knows exactly what he's doing by shilling for BP.
[01:47:11.309 --> 01:47:31.045]  He's trying to limit their exposure and basically his Coast Guard personnel and BP's hired security people, which a lot of them are Wackenhut, and I also reported that some of the people chasing people away from the beaches are off-duty Alabama troopers in that state.
[01:47:31.445 --> 01:47:41.110]  So we have, basically BP is running the show, and I think this can be laid right to the doorstep of the White House.
[01:47:41.110 --> 01:47:46.853]  The media, I had a report up yesterday that in the Pensacola area, Mediacom, the
[01:47:47.213 --> 01:47:59.925]  Cable provider has blocked out the 5-530 local newscasts of the ABC and CBS affiliate because they're doing a lot of in-depth reporting and also blocking out the 6 p.m.
[01:47:59.925 --> 01:48:04.910]  national CBS and ABC news reports from the people in Pensacola.
[01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:11.156]  People are getting a black screen when they try to tune in to the local affiliates and the national networks.
[01:48:12.217 --> 01:48:20.121]  And I think this goes to show the extent of the censorship going on as far as this oil disaster.
[01:48:20.121 --> 01:48:22.142]  Wayne Madsen, I think they have a name for this.
[01:48:22.142 --> 01:48:26.064]  This is called martial law, full spectrum dominance.
[01:48:26.064 --> 01:48:29.446]  And to have CNN reporting the First Amendment is now dead in the Gulf.
[01:48:30.186 --> 01:48:36.469]  And to have BP up to 10 miles in having police arresting reporters that just ask questions.
[01:48:36.469 --> 01:48:38.050]  That's been on the news.
[01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:41.111]  I mean, this is martial law in America.
[01:48:41.111 --> 01:48:44.973]  And the big issue here is what happens when that
[01:48:46.589 --> 01:48:54.293]  150 million plus gallons of oil now being driven towards the shore by the tropical storms forming in the Gulf.
[01:48:54.293 --> 01:48:56.194]  What happens when a lot of that comes ashore?
[01:48:56.194 --> 01:48:58.274]  We know there's already respiratory problems.
[01:48:58.274 --> 01:49:07.118]  We know 51 is the average life expectancy for Exxon Valdez workers from the off-gassing and toxins.
[01:49:07.118 --> 01:49:10.040]  We know the dispersants are much worse than the oil itself.
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:16.683]  We know they're so deadly they even eat the hulls of boats, and BP isn't allowing their workers to wear respirators.
[01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:19.045]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:49:19.835 --> 01:49:20.475]  Well, it is.
[01:49:20.475 --> 01:49:21.136]  Absolutely.
[01:49:21.136 --> 01:49:29.079]  It's probably the worst, in many respects, because it's more widespread than Katrina.
[01:49:29.079 --> 01:49:32.920]  It's affecting now every Gulf state, of course.
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:40.663]  And every time there's a tarball or a tar patio, or whatever they call these things that wash up, the initial response is, well, it's from a passing ship.
[01:49:40.663 --> 01:49:42.844]  We've seen this time and time again with the Florida
[01:49:42.984 --> 01:49:43.885]  We're good to go.
[01:50:09.642 --> 01:50:10.883]  We've got the First Amendment.
[01:50:10.883 --> 01:50:16.185]  I haven't heard that Mr. Obama has abrogated it yet, but he doesn't have the authority to do that.
[01:50:16.185 --> 01:50:22.787]  Well, they're saying in the Associated Press and the San Francisco Chronicle that it's a federal felony.
[01:50:23.467 --> 01:50:30.348]  Punishable by a decade in jail if you videotape any of their operations or try to talk to anyone.
[01:50:30.348 --> 01:50:33.669]  And so this is the new Gulag, and where'd Wayne Madsen go?
[01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:37.990]  Well, he tried to be a reporter, and you don't do that in the new Soviet America.
[01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:46.352]  I want to talk to you about your sources, your take on what's going to happen when that oil starts really coming ashore, because we've only seen the tip of the iceberg.
[01:50:46.352 --> 01:50:47.452]  And speaking of PSYOPs,
[01:50:48.112 --> 01:51:01.624]  The way the media is spinning it, that we've got to buy BP shares, we've got to shop at BP and buy their gas, or they'll go bankrupt and can't pay for the emergency, and Obama is against BP when they bankrolled him.
[01:51:01.624 --> 01:51:05.367]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:51:05.367 --> 01:51:05.868]  Think again.
[01:51:06.687 --> 01:51:14.331]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:51:14.331 --> 01:51:21.555]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:51:21.555 --> 01:51:29.780]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:02.121]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.121 --> 01:52:07.704]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.704 --> 01:52:12.726]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:18.289]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.289 --> 01:52:22.991]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:30.632]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.632 --> 01:52:31.752]  And here's the best part.

[01:52:52.648 --> 01:52:57.491]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.491 --> 01:53:00.833]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:54:05.575 --> 01:54:14.723]  We're going back to Wayne Madsen for the balance of this segment and the next, and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about the economy, the situation with Iran, and a lot more.
[01:54:14.723 --> 01:54:17.965]  Of course, he's the father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor.
[01:54:17.965 --> 01:54:20.627]  Before we go back to Wayne Madsen for the balance of this segment and the next,
[01:54:21.428 --> 01:54:30.570]  I wanted to remind listeners that we have an online video bookstore with the best books, most informative films, to further educate yourself and to educate others.
[01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:39.593]  And now people are really ready to be awakened, whether it's Invisible Empire, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that documents all the FEMA camps and the gun confiscation plans.
[01:54:40.782 --> 01:54:44.303]  How America is being slowly integrated into this police state system.
[01:54:44.303 --> 01:54:46.703]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:46.703 --> 01:54:52.505]  We're offering a new video, The Secret of Oz, by the great filmmaker Bill Still, who made The Money Masters.
[01:54:52.505 --> 01:55:03.887]  It's been a decade plus since he's made a new film, and you can get The Secret of Oz discounted with The Money Masters as well, if you want to get the combo, or get it individually at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:03.887 --> 01:55:06.528]  And we have a new special, where you get two t-shirts
[01:55:07.008 --> 01:55:07.168]  I think?
[01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:34.366]  Okay, and your purchases also make this broadcast possible.
[01:55:34.366 --> 01:55:36.968]  Going back to Wayne Madsen on thewaynemadsenreport.com.
[01:55:36.968 --> 01:55:46.815]  Okay, Wayne, specifically, what's the word on what they're planning to do when the oil starts coming ashore?
[01:55:46.815 --> 01:55:55.601]  A, and B, why would Obama block the counties and states from protecting themselves with berms and jetties?
[01:55:56.753 --> 01:56:12.464]  Well, I think what's going to happen if we start seeing these tropical storms, hurricanes, picking up this toxic soup in the Gulf and dumping it far inland, we're going to see the poisoning of the freshwater supplies inland.
[01:56:12.464 --> 01:56:17.308]  The streams, the creeks, the reservoirs, the lakes, etc.
[01:56:17.308 --> 01:56:20.090]  And that's going to extend this disaster even further.
[01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:25.713]  As far as Obama, I think Obama is not acting as President of the United States.
[01:56:25.713 --> 01:56:28.414]  He's taking his orders from BP.
[01:56:28.414 --> 01:56:31.035]  And we had the Queen of England here.
[01:56:31.035 --> 01:56:33.496]  Everybody was in the media fawning over her.
[01:56:33.496 --> 01:56:36.117]  You know, BP stands for British Petroleum.
[01:56:36.117 --> 01:56:41.520]  Maybe I missed it, but I saw no protesters in New York where she visited.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:46.582]  It was fine, you know, protesting the fact that one of her big companies from her nation
[01:56:49.443 --> 01:56:52.925]  She's one of the biggest shareholders.
[01:56:52.925 --> 01:56:53.965]  She's a eugenicist.
[01:56:53.965 --> 01:56:54.865]  She's a globalist.
[01:56:54.865 --> 01:56:58.707]  She's a carbon tax monster who promotes all this tyranny.
[01:56:58.707 --> 01:57:05.629]  Everyone's fawning over some demonic, inbred old woman that our ancestors fought a war against.
[01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:12.352]  I mean, it's a disgusting joke, and that's a good point that you rave about Queen Elizabeth II.
[01:57:12.352 --> 01:57:13.132]  I mean, what a fraud.
[01:57:16.314 --> 01:57:20.902]  You were one of the first to say evacuations would happen or that was the info you were getting.
[01:57:20.902 --> 01:57:23.246]  Now we do see the media starting to promote it.
[01:57:23.246 --> 01:57:29.257]  So again, what is Halliburton and BP and others and all these companies going to do as that oil comes in?
[01:57:29.923 --> 01:57:34.124]  Well, I think we're going to see the censorship and the PR spin continue.
[01:57:34.124 --> 01:57:46.909]  We'll get some reports, obviously, through the blockade, but I would note that my report on the evacuations was picked up by some websites, and just in the last week, they printed retractions.
[01:57:46.909 --> 01:57:56.992]  Obviously, they got called by, you know, BP's big PR bigwigs and told to retract or at least amend
[01:57:57.532 --> 01:57:58.873]  The original story.
[01:57:58.873 --> 01:58:04.158]  What BP is doing is trying to limit the exposure of this disaster.
[01:58:04.158 --> 01:58:07.742]  And now we have them shopping around for investment money in places like Libya.
[01:58:07.742 --> 01:58:10.685]  They're going to Qaddafi to get bailed out.
[01:58:10.685 --> 01:58:12.146]  And other countries.
[01:58:12.146 --> 01:58:15.789]  So I think that's what we're seeing there.
[01:58:15.789 --> 01:58:18.232]  And where is the Environmental Protection Agency?
[01:58:18.852 --> 01:58:22.274]  Lisa Jackson, who came out of New York, who's the administrator.
[01:58:22.274 --> 01:58:23.955]  We've seen nothing from the EPA.
[01:58:23.955 --> 01:58:29.278]  So the Coast Guard, the EPA, all very silent or complicit with the EPA.
[01:58:29.278 --> 01:58:30.498]  Well, this is globalism.
[01:58:30.498 --> 01:58:31.719]  This is corporate governance.
[01:58:31.719 --> 01:58:32.880]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:34.661]  Five more minutes with Wayne Madsen.
[01:58:34.661 --> 01:58:37.542]  Then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about a host of issues.
[01:58:37.542 --> 01:58:38.123]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.123 --> 01:58:45.867]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:53.650 --> 01:59:56.031]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.031 --> 02:00:05.536]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.536 --> 02:00:06.837]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.837 --> 02:00:08.618]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.618 --> 02:00:09.799]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.799 --> 02:00:11.960]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:13.500]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.703 --> 02:00:21.785]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.206 --> 02:00:26.229]  We've reached the halfway point in this worldwide broadcast.
[02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:43.403]  We have Chris Emery joining us in studio, one of the leading researchers on Oklahoma City, to look back at that government bombing operation used to demonize conservatives and patriots as they gear up to stage more terror attacks on themselves as a pretext to attack the American people.
[02:00:44.504 --> 02:00:52.008]  Meanwhile, a New York National Guard unit scanned vehicles for gun confiscation in the capital of New York, Albany.
[02:00:52.008 --> 02:00:54.670]  Amazing report out of Fox News.
[02:00:55.737 --> 02:01:06.442]  News 23, we have a detailed breakdown of the history of this and how they're slowly acclimating people for full-bore martial law, but now it's really reaching the boiling point at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:06.442 --> 02:01:08.923]  We've got four minutes left with Wayne Madsen.
[02:01:08.923 --> 02:01:15.306]  Wayne, other tidbits here, because the statistics of the
[02:01:16.266 --> 02:01:29.116]  Fifty-one year life expectancy of Exxon Valdez workers and the statistics I saw, the government admits it was the dispersants they believe that were the main thing that really caused the autoimmune diseases and cancers to go off the charts.
[02:01:29.116 --> 02:01:35.141]  They're using a lot more of this stuff this time than they did in Alaska and a lot more populated areas.
[02:01:35.141 --> 02:01:37.002]  How does BP think they're going to get away with this?
[02:01:38.363 --> 02:01:44.168]  Well, we're going to buy judges, and we already see them judge shopping for these civil suits.
[02:01:44.168 --> 02:01:52.754]  We see how they try to get these cases bundled to put them under Lynn Hughes in Houston, who has a conflict of interest.
[02:01:52.754 --> 02:01:55.036]  He takes money from the oil industry.
[02:01:55.036 --> 02:02:00.820]  Martin Feldman, the one in New Orleans who overturned the moratorium on drilling, he's got ties to the oil industry.
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:04.023]  And Mark Fuller in Montgomery, Alabama, is a
[02:02:06.124 --> 02:02:06.445]  I don't know.
[02:02:24.305 --> 02:02:27.908]  Force them to recuse themselves.
[02:02:27.908 --> 02:02:34.114]  If they're impeached, Obama might try to put another pro-oil guy in their place, but filibuster that.
[02:02:34.114 --> 02:02:35.715]  Don't take any action.
[02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:41.100]  Make them go to other judges who don't have any tie to the oil industry.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:49.288]  At least these three judges, and probably more, are tied to the oil industry and they need to be removed, recused, or impeached.
[02:02:49.827 --> 02:02:52.810]  All right, here's my last question on that issue.
[02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:56.373]  We know Obama is one of the main minions of BP.
[02:02:56.373 --> 02:03:00.256]  We know Rahm Emanuel had his apartment for many years paid for illegally.
[02:03:00.256 --> 02:03:04.259]  That's coming out in the Bogoyevich trial there in D.C.
[02:03:04.259 --> 02:03:05.681]  where you live.
[02:03:05.681 --> 02:03:09.924]  We know that they set up Cap-and-Trade with Enron.
[02:03:09.924 --> 02:03:13.747]  We know this is a top New World Order globalist organization.
[02:03:14.568 --> 02:03:18.414]  And then we have the media acting like Obama has his foot on their neck.
[02:03:18.414 --> 02:03:25.104]  Is that part of the PR ruse to try to not have it come out that Obama is basically on the payroll?
[02:03:25.785 --> 02:03:38.652]  Well, yeah, of course Obama entertained the BP executives of the White House in an announcement with his $20 billion cap on damages, and that's nowhere near what this is going to cost.
[02:03:38.652 --> 02:03:43.235]  I think in terms of over a trillion dollars, maybe closer to $2 trillion.
[02:03:43.235 --> 02:03:51.660]  But what price can you put on the Gulf of Mexico and the other oceans that could be affected by this disaster?
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:04:09.633]  Well that's right, and the people who are complacent up here, it's a matter of time before this gets into the Chesapeake, the largest estuary in North America, and we're going to see that.
[02:04:09.633 --> 02:04:15.698]  They're already making emergency plans in North Carolina when this hits the Outer Banks.
[02:04:16.318 --> 02:04:33.149]  So this is not going to be limited to the Gulf of Mexico, and when it hits the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, the richest fishing grounds that North America and Europe depend on, then we're going to see, you know, basically you can just kiss off seafood as a staple.
[02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:34.230]  Well, that's the issue.
[02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:42.256]  As they say, there's probably 2 billion gallons in that one hole alone, and it does go out around Florida and up into the Grand Banks.
[02:04:42.256 --> 02:04:44.717]  After it leaves the East Coast, it goes up there into the Arctic.
[02:04:49.043 --> 02:04:50.807]  It's just horrible.
[02:04:50.807 --> 02:04:52.309]  Wayne Madsen, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:04:52.309 --> 02:04:54.453]  We appreciate your time with us.
[02:04:54.453 --> 02:04:55.495]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:55.495 --> 02:04:55.856]  Thank you.
[02:04:55.856 --> 02:04:56.236]  Okay.
[02:04:56.236 --> 02:04:59.041]  We'll be right back with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:05:02.267 --> 02:05:06.230]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.230 --> 02:05:15.097]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.097 --> 02:05:19.720]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:30.549]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.169 --> 02:05:40.672]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:40.672 --> 02:05:46.114]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.114 --> 02:05:53.597]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:06:57.303 --> 02:06:59.025]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:06:59.943 --> 02:07:04.486]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.486 --> 02:07:05.407]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.407 --> 02:07:08.829]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.829 --> 02:07:09.690]  Number 2.
[02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:14.593]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.593 --> 02:07:15.333]  It's true.
[02:07:15.333 --> 02:07:20.197]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.197 --> 02:07:21.017]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.017 --> 02:07:24.619]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.619 --> 02:07:28.322]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.522 --> 02:07:29.302]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.302 --> 02:07:32.063]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.063 --> 02:07:35.745]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.745 --> 02:07:36.545]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.545 --> 02:07:40.687]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.687 --> 02:07:45.729]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.729 --> 02:07:49.910]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:51.691]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.691 --> 02:07:56.293]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:07:56.613 --> 02:07:56.893]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:56.893 --> 02:07:58.817]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:58.817 --> 02:08:02.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.475 --> 02:08:29.842]  For the balance of the hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor, the head of policy, Department of Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, syndicated columnist and best-selling author, is our guest to talk about a host of issues, but the main one is the gear up for the attack on Iran.
[02:08:29.842 --> 02:08:33.043]  More and more it's being green-lighted by the Israelis, the U.S.
[02:08:33.043 --> 02:08:33.543]  government, and
[02:08:35.684 --> 02:08:41.371]  When he thinks it may happen, how it can be stopped, but what will happen if they hit Iran from his research.
[02:08:41.371 --> 02:08:47.478]  Before I do that, I mentioned earlier at the end of the last hour, this video talking about solutions, the secret of Oz.
[02:08:49.284 --> 02:08:55.085]  By the maker of The Money Masters, and we have that film available as well, by Bill Still.
[02:08:55.085 --> 02:09:00.967]  He's been all over the world, Iceland, you name it, where they're fighting back against these people, and this has some great solutions.
[02:09:00.967 --> 02:09:10.389]  You know, not a gold-backed currency, because the bankers pretty much dominate that, but a government-controlled fiat system, and basically how to bring these people to justice.
[02:09:10.389 --> 02:09:14.110]  The Secret of Oz, Solutions for a Broken Economy, very important film.
[02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:15.630]  We sold out of this last week.
[02:09:15.630 --> 02:09:17.691]  We just got more in today.
[02:09:18.691 --> 02:09:21.934]  So get your orders in for The Secret of Oz.
[02:09:21.934 --> 02:09:36.167]  We have a new special running for a limited time where you can order the new films we produced, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and of course Invisible Empire, and get a copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, free.
[02:09:36.647 --> 02:09:40.953]  We have several other choices you can make on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:40.953 --> 02:09:53.549]  You can look for the banners up on the site to take you to the subsection of the shopping cart that has those specials and your purchase of the books and videos not only gives you a tool to wake people up and to inform yourself to a higher level but also
[02:09:54.230 --> 02:10:02.596]  Supports this transmission and the important work we're doing here And I couldn't do it without all of you out there and speaking of support prison planet TV.
[02:10:02.596 --> 02:10:07.139]  We simulcast The at least part of the radio show starting next week.
[02:10:07.139 --> 02:10:23.910]  I'm gonna simulcast the entire radio show from there on out via streaming video with the four camera shooting here at prison planet TV and we put an exclusive prison planet TV Video up where I sent my guys Rob do and Jason Douglas to Chicago
[02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:25.051]  We're good to go.
[02:10:43.696 --> 02:10:45.977]  Twenty-three in Albany, New York.
[02:10:45.977 --> 02:10:49.719]  New York National Guard unit scanned vehicles for gun confiscations.
[02:10:49.719 --> 02:10:50.960]  They drive you through.
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.541]  If they find a gun, they take you to jail.
[02:10:52.541 --> 02:10:54.562]  I mean, this is on the news now.
[02:10:54.562 --> 02:10:58.804]  So the slow-creeping martial law is just intensifying.
[02:10:58.804 --> 02:11:09.609]  And before we get into the economy and the oil spill and the Iran situation, because as Roberts predicted a few years ago, when governments and banks get in trouble, they launch new wars.
[02:11:09.609 --> 02:11:12.611]  Let me ask him about the police state, because he writes about that.
[02:11:13.771 --> 02:11:16.192]  Dr. Roberts, good to have you back with us.
[02:11:16.192 --> 02:11:17.533]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[02:11:17.533 --> 02:11:20.094]  There he is, joining us via video Skype.
[02:11:20.094 --> 02:11:28.938]  You've written a lot about the police state, but now we have the military more and more on the streets of America, really violating posse comitatus.
[02:11:28.938 --> 02:11:29.839]  What's your take on that?
[02:11:31.764 --> 02:11:38.950]  Well, I suppose, Alex, they just want to make sure that we forget about the Constitution and our rights.
[02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:50.400]  I think they realize that they've created a mess for us, both internationally and domestically, both militarily and economically.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:57.405]  And they want to be sure that the people just sort of give up and accept their fate.
[02:12:01.437 --> 02:12:06.560]  What do you think the American people's response to this should be?
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:12.143]  Well, I think they should get very angry and be very well armed and very well organized.
[02:12:12.143 --> 02:12:21.068]  You know, one of the problems, Alex, as you know very well, is that so many Americans get confused about what patriotism is.
[02:12:21.068 --> 02:12:25.850]  So many of them think that being patriotic means supporting the government.
[02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:28.772]  They don't understand that it means supporting the Constitution.
[02:12:29.815 --> 02:12:29.955]  Yeah.
[02:12:47.088 --> 02:12:58.858]  We're right that your worst enemy is always your government because it alone has the power to break you and control you.
[02:12:58.858 --> 02:13:06.344]  So I think we're a long way from the vast majority of American people coming to that realization.
[02:13:08.407 --> 02:13:10.629]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:13.712]  People are going to have to get hurt a lot worse than they've already been abused.
[02:13:13.712 --> 02:13:19.798]  And, boy, I tell you, I read Bloomberg reporting 46 states are on the verge of going bankrupt.
[02:13:19.798 --> 02:13:27.185]  Federal regulators are, quote, ordering outside of law for large pension fund managers to, quote, invest in failed banks.
[02:13:27.185 --> 02:13:29.166]  Suddenly, CNBC reports that the
[02:13:30.087 --> 02:13:31.629]  Yes, it is kind of funny, isn't it?
[02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:35.352]  I mean, you know, it seems it was just the other day that we had recovery, recovery, recovery.
[02:13:59.343 --> 02:14:08.665]  As you know, I've said for some time that there's no recovery because there's nothing left to recover.
[02:14:08.665 --> 02:14:24.047]  Keep in mind that our pensions, or what remains of them, are in grave danger now because if we do continue into a depression, the government's budget deficit will become huge.
[02:14:24.047 --> 02:14:26.368]  I mean, it's already almost half
[02:14:27.088 --> 02:14:27.548]  Of course.
[02:14:42.076 --> 02:14:42.156]  Yes.
[02:14:59.748 --> 02:15:05.995]  With the situation being as bad as it is, the bonds won't be worth very much.
[02:15:05.995 --> 02:15:10.780]  And so that's how they will finish off our pensions.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:14.584]  Alternatively, they will simply say, well, we're going to have a capital levy.
[02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.929]  All right.
[02:15:15.929 --> 02:15:16.290]  Thank you.
[02:15:32.256 --> 02:15:37.279]  So people don't really quite know how bad it's going to be.
[02:15:37.279 --> 02:15:53.169]  And you can see that all the stimulus programs, despite the massive size, have failed to alleviate the unemployment and apparently have failed to stop the downward descent of the economy.
[02:15:53.169 --> 02:15:57.052]  So if you have the largest budget deficit in history and the lowest interest rates,
[02:15:58.035 --> 02:16:03.119]  And they can't stop an economic downturn.
[02:16:03.119 --> 02:16:10.004]  Then you don't really have any policy left to use.
[02:16:10.004 --> 02:16:25.195]  So I think we're headed into a very serious situation that will, as I've said many times, undermine the dollar as the reserve currency and therefore undermine our ability to import.
[02:16:26.243 --> 02:16:30.627]  Which will affect a whole range of product availability.
[02:16:30.627 --> 02:16:33.789]  Well, sir, that brings me to my next question.
[02:16:33.789 --> 02:16:41.416]  We have, of course, the New York Times, CNN, and others last week coming out and saying, oh, the U.N.
[02:16:41.416 --> 02:16:46.780]  says get rid of the dollars, the world reserve currency, have a SDR, special drawing rights,
[02:16:47.761 --> 02:17:00.511]  And that we'll still have the currencies of the world, but we're going to devalue those, and then all that will be left is this new bank-to-bank thing backed up by the carbon tax, and then it will be basically a global government run by private banks.
[02:17:00.511 --> 02:17:13.661]  So, this is out in the open, and then it's clear that's why they're wrecking things by design, is to force us onto the wreckage of our society that will basically be this new global government.
[02:17:14.341 --> 02:17:21.946]  And, you know, like you said last time when you were on with us about a month ago, that clearly the government is now trying to destroy America by design.
[02:17:21.946 --> 02:17:29.051]  Can you speak to the SDR, this move to a new level of the Ponzi scheme?
[02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:31.973]  Well, Alex, the SDR is
[02:17:34.884 --> 02:17:35.084]  I think?
[02:17:54.184 --> 02:18:10.815]  Point out that the United States was in enough financial difficulty that maybe the puppet states in Europe would distance themselves a little bit and stop supporting such an aggressive American policy in the rest of the world.
[02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:14.738]  Not only toward Iran, but it's also toward Russia.
[02:18:15.718 --> 02:18:24.365]  We have Hillary Clinton in Georgia the other day rebuking Russia for occupying Georgia.
[02:18:24.365 --> 02:18:26.667]  Well, they don't occupy Georgia.
[02:18:26.667 --> 02:18:35.554]  So, I think that that is not meant as a serious solution to the problem.
[02:18:35.554 --> 02:18:42.979]  And I think when the UN report raises it, it's really meant to call attention
[02:18:43.786 --> 02:19:12.890]  to the fact that there isn't a stable dollar and that the whole world relies on the dollar as reserve currency and that the behavior of the United States government running up the massive budget deficits with wars they can't afford, with bank bailouts they can't afford, and running up massive trade deficits by offshoring the industry and the professional service jobs
[02:19:13.715 --> 02:19:25.890]  That I think it's directed at calling attention to the fact that American leadership is not long for this world.
[02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:29.033]  It's run out because the resource base for it
[02:19:30.014 --> 02:19:32.295]  Has run out.
[02:19:32.295 --> 02:19:57.111]  Doctor, when we come back, let's talk about how you see this unfolding then, and how an attack on Iran factors in, and why the establishment seems to think in their own writings that a large global war, as the Rand Corporation said two years ago, would somehow prop up the Anglo-American-Dutch-slash-Israeli alliance, and what you see happening to the US economy.
[02:19:57.111 --> 02:19:59.032]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:20:01.104 --> 02:20:05.311]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:17.995 --> 02:20:18.596]  We're good to go!
[02:20:41.838 --> 02:20:46.900]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:51.062]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.062 --> 02:20:52.863]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.863 --> 02:20:57.465]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.167 --> 02:21:11.195]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:21:11.195 --> 02:21:17.640]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:26.487]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:21:26.867 --> 02:21:36.053]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:21:36.053 --> 02:21:40.656]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:21:40.656 --> 02:21:42.457]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:42.457 --> 02:21:44.959]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[02:24:12.149 --> 02:24:24.813]  Folks, we sit here and we analyze this coldly every day, but when I'm sitting back at 11 o'clock at night reading a book about to turn the light out and go to bed, it just really dawns on me.
[02:24:24.813 --> 02:24:31.456]  We really do have a bunch of Ponzi scheme crooks that wrecked the most wealthy, powerful, wonderful nation in history.
[02:24:31.456 --> 02:24:34.577]  And we've gone from the apple of the world's eye, the light of liberty,
[02:24:35.776 --> 02:24:38.579]  To the country that promotes all these illegal wars.
[02:24:38.579 --> 02:24:42.422]  We've just basically invaded Costa Rica with 44 ships.
[02:24:42.422 --> 02:24:44.945]  It's got their country in an uproar.
[02:24:44.945 --> 02:24:49.930]  We're a nation that promotes torture, secret arrest, and it's only getting worse!
[02:24:49.930 --> 02:25:00.220]  Dr. Roberts, as we went to break, I threw out the question, how do you see this unfolding and how does an attack on Iran play into it from your historical research?
[02:25:02.045 --> 02:25:14.538]  Well, Alex, they want to attack Iran for several reasons, and I suppose the most important is this ideology of American hedge enemy.
[02:25:14.538 --> 02:25:20.104]  And this is the trouble with the one world stuff.
[02:25:20.104 --> 02:25:24.569]  If the Americans talk about one world, what they mean is an American world.
[02:25:26.366 --> 02:25:32.150]  And so, if you look at the Middle East, what's the remaining independent countries?
[02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:36.493]  That is, what countries are not American puppet states?
[02:25:36.493 --> 02:25:39.836]  And we have only Iran and Syria.
[02:25:39.836 --> 02:25:55.387]  Now, the reasoning, I'm told from people that I still know in Washington, is that Syria they can ignore because if they knock off Iran, Syria will simply voluntarily become an American puppet state.
[02:25:56.199 --> 02:25:58.131]  And so they're after Iran.
[02:25:59.467 --> 02:26:07.954]  They would love to have one of their color revolutions and get rid of it without military means.
[02:26:07.954 --> 02:26:12.937]  But they want to get rid of it at any cost.
[02:26:12.937 --> 02:26:18.882]  And you can see that's the reason for all the years of demonization and lies.
[02:26:18.882 --> 02:26:28.069]  And most recently, when the United States somehow got the Security Council of the UN to go along with sanctions.
[02:26:30.363 --> 02:26:31.764]  What did the Americans do?
[02:26:31.764 --> 02:26:32.904]  The minute they got the U.N.
[02:26:32.904 --> 02:26:38.467]  sanctions, Washington then added their own unilateral sanctions.
[02:26:38.467 --> 02:26:49.153]  Which Ron Paul has pointed out on the House floor, and he's read the international law and our national law, that's an act of war, and now in Germany they're not fueling Iranian aircraft?
[02:26:49.153 --> 02:26:51.315]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:26:51.315 --> 02:26:56.277]  Yes, but you see what Washington's doing, it's using the U.N.
[02:26:56.277 --> 02:26:56.818]  sanctions
[02:26:57.987 --> 02:27:00.629]  as a basis for its own.
[02:27:00.629 --> 02:27:04.673]  Well, the Russians said, you've double-crossed us.
[02:27:04.673 --> 02:27:13.901]  And the media will never differentiate between the UN sanctions, which are not so severe, and the American sanctions that have been added to them.
[02:27:13.901 --> 02:27:24.630]  And the ships that we have dispatched, allegedly to stop Iranian ships on the high seas and inspect their cargoes, another act of war,
[02:27:27.648 --> 02:27:32.630]  They're not going to simply be enforcing the UN sanctions.
[02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:49.014]  So we've double-crossed the Security Council again, and we're hoping that some sort of instant will come out of this so that we can have some justification.
[02:27:49.014 --> 02:27:50.115]  I don't know what happened to the...
[02:27:51.434 --> 02:27:56.658]  So we can have some kind of a justification for the attack on Iran.
[02:27:56.658 --> 02:28:06.104]  Now if you go back to Bush's speech, it was January 29, 2002, when he says there's this axis of evil.
[02:28:06.104 --> 02:28:09.306]  There's Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.
[02:28:09.306 --> 02:28:14.330]  And he sort of brought together these three countries which have nothing in common.
[02:28:15.814 --> 02:28:20.556]  North Korea is the last communist country that's isolated in the Far East.
[02:28:20.556 --> 02:28:27.718]  Iran and Iraq had just been fighting an eight-year war, a million casualties.
[02:28:27.718 --> 02:28:29.699]  One is secular, one is Shiite.
[02:28:29.699 --> 02:28:31.320]  They're at each other's throats.
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:32.620]  One was Sunni, one Shiite.
[02:28:34.861 --> 02:28:48.088]  Who've been at odds since the 7th century, nothing in common, and yet Bush's neoconservative wordcrafters created this notion of a common enemy that we face.
[02:28:48.088 --> 02:28:57.574]  So I think, you know, what they're hoping is they can somehow come up with a color revolution
[02:28:58.564 --> 02:28:59.104]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:18.789 --> 02:29:24.753]  Anything less than that, if Iran responds, they probably could block the oil flows from the Persian Gulf.
[02:29:24.753 --> 02:29:25.734]  All right, stay there, Doc.
[02:29:25.734 --> 02:29:27.135]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:27.135 --> 02:29:28.656]  I want you to continue to break that down.
[02:29:28.656 --> 02:29:35.181]  And when we come back, I'm going to also get into the fact that this is an act of war, saying they're going to board their ships.
[02:29:35.181 --> 02:29:38.163]  And Iran has said, you start boarding our ships, we're going to board your ships.
[02:29:38.743 --> 02:29:46.305]  And that's exactly what Cheney wanted back in 2007, that came out in New Yorker Magazine, was to actually attack our own ships and blame it on Iran.
[02:29:46.305 --> 02:29:49.266]  So we may see a false flag in the mix here as well.
[02:29:49.266 --> 02:29:51.266]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.266 --> 02:29:52.667]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.667 --> 02:29:55.187]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.187 --> 02:29:57.868]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.646 --> 02:30:04.829]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:04.829 --> 02:30:11.253]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:11.253 --> 02:30:18.639]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:18.639 --> 02:30:23.182]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:30:32.178 --> 02:30:35.905]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:43.184]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:43.184 --> 02:30:47.087]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:30:47.087 --> 02:30:48.248]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.

[02:31:04.558 --> 02:31:05.839]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:05.839 --> 02:31:09.702]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.702 --> 02:31:12.003]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.003 --> 02:31:17.868]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:24.112]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.512 --> 02:31:30.494]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.494 --> 02:31:34.675]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.675 --> 02:31:38.956]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:38.956 --> 02:31:44.918]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:44.918 --> 02:31:48.459]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.459 --> 02:31:50.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:50.880]  It's here.

[02:34:07.682 --> 02:34:23.273]  And speaking of high quality food, the Interhealth Botanicals Superfood, the Interfood, interfood.com, Interhealth Botanicals, a fantastic company that's been supporting us for years, have been providing
[02:34:24.073 --> 02:34:24.733]  I don't think so.
[02:34:47.628 --> 02:34:50.309]  Now that's something you don't see in store shelves every day.
[02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:58.511]  That's Interfood.com or give them a call right now at 866-762-9238 to see all the available discounts for Alex Jones listeners.

[02:35:03.873 --> 02:35:04.473]  Okay, going back to
[02:35:08.334 --> 02:35:23.159]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, you were finishing up with Iran and talking about trying to get our ships in there in their own waters, boarding all of their ships, saying they're not allowed to have fuel, they're not allowed to have any finished goods.
[02:35:23.159 --> 02:35:29.481]  I mean, this is a classic act of siege of war, and the Iranians are saying they're going to resist.
[02:35:29.481 --> 02:35:32.762]  I remember Bush five years ago admitted in a White House press release that they had
[02:35:34.017 --> 02:35:34.478]  I don't
[02:35:51.997 --> 02:35:58.202]  They're in there bombing the daylights with terrorists inside Iran, and Iran lays there and takes it.
[02:35:58.202 --> 02:36:00.904]  But I can't see Iran putting up with its ships being boarded.
[02:36:00.904 --> 02:36:04.007]  I mean, and how is our media going to spin that?
[02:36:04.007 --> 02:36:05.408]  How dare them Iranians?
[02:36:05.408 --> 02:36:07.590]  They wouldn't let our military board their ships.
[02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:11.293]  I mean, is there no end to the evil that this country won't engage in?
[02:36:12.705 --> 02:36:13.546]  Apparently not.
[02:36:13.546 --> 02:36:24.314]  I mean, look, the Israelis just got away with boarding the aid flotilla to Gaza, killing all those people, and nothing has happened.
[02:36:24.314 --> 02:36:31.459]  Once again, we protected them diplomatically, so if we let them do it, we probably figure we can do it too.
[02:36:31.459 --> 02:36:33.981]  So I don't think, you know, the real question is,
[02:36:36.499 --> 02:36:38.942]  Why does the rest of the world go along with this?
[02:36:38.942 --> 02:36:43.948]  Now, my answer to the Europeans is they're all American puppet states.
[02:36:43.948 --> 02:36:45.369]  We've bought their leadership.
[02:36:45.369 --> 02:36:48.353]  And they're our puppets.
[02:36:48.353 --> 02:36:50.095]  But why Russia and China?
[02:36:51.585 --> 02:37:03.492]  For some reason Russia has never delivered the sophisticated missile air defense that they contracted with Iran to supply.
[02:37:03.492 --> 02:37:06.454]  And they haven't delivered it because we keep telling them not to.
[02:37:06.454 --> 02:37:13.598]  So why does Russia allow us to interfere with their contract with Iran?
[02:37:13.598 --> 02:37:14.919]  And then look at China.
[02:37:14.919 --> 02:37:17.521]  China has massive energy investments.
[02:37:18.484 --> 02:37:19.345]  In Iran.
[02:37:19.345 --> 02:37:22.587]  And China's economy is still going gangbusters.
[02:37:22.587 --> 02:37:24.068]  They need energy.
[02:37:24.068 --> 02:37:29.372]  And our plan for dealing with China is to cut them off from energy.
[02:37:29.372 --> 02:37:33.215]  So why would China go along with this?
[02:37:33.215 --> 02:37:39.981]  And it seems to me that those are questions that I don't know the answer to.
[02:37:39.981 --> 02:37:45.124]  But the rest of the world is somehow complicit in this.
[02:37:46.005 --> 02:37:56.850]  And it makes no sense because the world knows that Bill Clinton lied about the Serbian-Kosovo-Albanian dispute.
[02:37:56.850 --> 02:38:03.973]  We know that Bush lied about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.
[02:38:03.973 --> 02:38:11.237]  We have the International Atomic Energy Agency reports from the inspectors on the ground that there's no diversion.
[02:38:11.977 --> 02:38:12.358]  I'm good.
[02:38:32.606 --> 02:38:42.393]  Why doesn't somebody ask the President, how do you know they have a weapons program when your own intelligence agency says they don't?
[02:38:42.393 --> 02:38:47.697]  How do you know they have weapons when all the Atomic Energy Agency reports say they don't?
[02:38:47.697 --> 02:38:53.641]  How can they possibly have weapons when your own authorities say they're not capable of enriching uranium?
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:56.061]  To that extent.
[02:38:56.061 --> 02:38:57.302]  No one asks these questions.
[02:38:57.302 --> 02:38:59.064]  Nobody in the media asks them.
[02:38:59.064 --> 02:39:12.934]  And Iran has tried, on what, three separate occasions, to give their uranium under UN supervision to the French, to the Turks, to the Brazilians, to enrich it where it's at a level that can't be used in weapons.
[02:39:12.934 --> 02:39:16.537]  And that only enrages the United States and Israel more.
[02:39:16.537 --> 02:39:17.798]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[02:39:17.798 --> 02:39:19.719]  We are the bad guys in this.
[02:39:19.719 --> 02:39:22.501]  We've overthrown Iran's government twice in the last century.
[02:39:23.752 --> 02:39:27.355]  And it's just outrageous that they're positioning us this way.
[02:39:27.355 --> 02:39:37.183]  But from every expert I talked to, Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst, and many others, and just common sense and studying the region, there's close to 70 million Iranians.
[02:39:37.183 --> 02:39:41.546]  They haven't been under siege for a decade plus, like Iraq.
[02:39:41.546 --> 02:39:42.787]  They have high-tech weapons.
[02:39:42.787 --> 02:39:47.131]  They do have sleeper cells, as any large nation does in other countries.
[02:39:48.331 --> 02:39:50.252]  And this is the perfect storm.
[02:39:50.252 --> 02:39:51.633]  They attack Iran.
[02:39:51.633 --> 02:39:54.554]  They won't have to stage terror attacks once the war's on.
[02:39:54.554 --> 02:39:55.735]  Iran will strike back.
[02:39:55.735 --> 02:39:57.196]  It'll be called terrorism.
[02:39:57.196 --> 02:40:09.302]  And the system is going to use this crisis as a pretext to crack down on domestic populations in the U.S., grab pension funds, and do all the other things they do when we're distracted by a war.
[02:40:09.302 --> 02:40:11.843]  And so this is good for the system to start a war.
[02:40:12.443 --> 02:40:17.567]  And a lot of people like to rally around the flag when we are blowing the hell out of some poor group of brown people.
[02:40:17.567 --> 02:40:23.071]  And so I see the system going ahead with it, and all the indicators we've got out of Israel and out of the U.S.
[02:40:23.071 --> 02:40:26.133]  government is, they are moving towards a full green light on this.
[02:40:26.133 --> 02:40:31.898]  What's your take on the green light, and when you think it's coming, and what the aftermath of this war will be?
[02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:35.751]  Well, Alex, I don't think anyone knows when it's coming.
[02:40:35.751 --> 02:40:45.155]  I don't even think the people planning it know that, because they're looking for some sort of rationale, excuse, opportunity.
[02:40:45.155 --> 02:40:51.997]  So, and the outcome, I don't think, is known either.
[02:40:51.997 --> 02:40:57.619]  If I were the Iranians, I wouldn't sit there and wait for the attack.
[02:40:57.619 --> 02:41:00.881]  I mean, why respond after you've been
[02:41:02.054 --> 02:41:04.877]  Badly hurt.
[02:41:04.877 --> 02:41:19.311]  Once I knew the attack was coming and nothing could be done about it, if I were the Iranians, I simply would take out the American aircraft carriers, I would let everything that I had fall on Israel, and I would start it.
[02:41:20.182 --> 02:41:27.648]  Because I wouldn't sit there and then respond with whatever I happen to have left after I've had a massive attack.
[02:41:27.648 --> 02:41:39.457]  You know, the other day, the head of the University of London's Center for International Affairs said that they're gearing up for the total destruction of Iran.
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:45.025]  You see, we've got troops in 10 countries surrounding Iran.
[02:41:45.025 --> 02:41:48.449]  We've stockpiled all these bunker-buster bombs.
[02:41:48.449 --> 02:41:52.654]  Apparently, we've even moved tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:41:52.654 --> 02:41:54.756]  The Aghilarsiyam.
[02:41:54.756 --> 02:41:56.057]  Yes.
[02:41:56.057 --> 02:41:59.821]  And so, I don't think
[02:42:01.089 --> 02:42:09.894]  That they would be doing all of this just in order to scare Iran or pressure them.
[02:42:09.894 --> 02:42:14.837]  No, this is a full court press, just like before the invasion of Iraq both times.
[02:42:14.837 --> 02:42:22.902]  And you're right, they've said that if Iran fights back in any way under Bush, and Obama's continued this doctrine, that they will use nuclear weapons on them.
[02:42:22.902 --> 02:42:29.606]  So, if Iran lifts a hand to protect themselves, the media is going to scream like it's the end of the world.
[02:42:30.206 --> 02:42:38.550]  And I guess Americans are going to sit there while their cities are being nuked, feeling powerful and running American flags out on flagpoles.
[02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:43.173]  Meanwhile, the same global corporate crime syndicate is destroying America's future.
[02:42:43.173 --> 02:42:50.156]  So I guess in a way, if Americans go along with this war, I'm going to have to say we're cursed and we deserve for the bankers to rape us.
[02:42:50.156 --> 02:42:53.658]  But I don't deserve to be raped by them.
[02:42:53.658 --> 02:42:57.440]  So what do you do as an individual living in Nazi Germany?
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:42:59.281]  Yes, you'd be quiet.
[02:43:01.121 --> 02:43:14.296]  Listen Alex, you know, I think that if they do strike Iran in some horrendous way, one possibility would be that all of the colonized puppet state Muslims
[02:43:15.799 --> 02:43:25.922]  would feel so absolutely wrong and powerless that they could possibly overthrow the American puppets.
[02:43:25.922 --> 02:43:30.023]  You might see revolution in Egypt, in Jordan.
[02:43:30.023 --> 02:43:33.504]  You might see it even in Saudi Arabia.
[02:43:33.504 --> 02:43:38.445]  It's entirely possible that we would simply be going too far
[02:43:39.448 --> 02:43:39.909]  I don't know.
[02:43:55.632 --> 02:44:16.488]  And of course, if it disrupts oil in any significant way, that would be really detrimental for... Doctor, doesn't Israel losing in Lebanon three and a half years ago, and having other setbacks, I mean, doesn't that give them some pause before they just head us into World War III?
[02:44:16.488 --> 02:44:19.310]  No, you see, if they get rid of Iran,
[02:44:20.071 --> 02:44:24.754]  Then there's no one to support Hezbollah and Hamas.
[02:44:24.754 --> 02:44:29.678]  And so that's the other reason we didn't get to for the attack on Iran.
[02:44:29.678 --> 02:44:37.944]  It gets rid of all the support for the forces that block Israel from stealing all of Palestine and southern Lebanon.
[02:44:38.524 --> 02:44:48.910]  See, Israel is chomping at the bit to simply evict the few remaining Palestinians and to seize southern Lebanon.
[02:44:48.910 --> 02:44:52.292]  Yeah, they want past the Golan and that water supply.
[02:44:52.292 --> 02:44:54.413]  They want the water supply from southern Lebanon.
[02:44:54.413 --> 02:44:58.476]  So, that's their stake in this war.
[02:44:58.476 --> 02:45:00.097]  They want Iran out of it.
[02:45:01.301 --> 02:45:07.523]  Because then once Hezbollah uses up whatever weapons it has, it wouldn't have any more.
[02:45:07.523 --> 02:45:15.006]  And there would be no way to stop them from simply... How does Iran get the weapons in?
[02:45:15.006 --> 02:45:16.027]  Through Syria?
[02:45:16.027 --> 02:45:17.287]  I don't know.
[02:45:17.287 --> 02:45:22.489]  Why doesn't Iran just make a deal with Israel and have a peace treaty?
[02:45:22.489 --> 02:45:27.031]  Because Iran is looking down the barrel of a nuclear bomb.
[02:45:27.031 --> 02:45:27.951]  I don't know that either.
[02:45:29.633 --> 02:45:34.948]  You know, as I've said, there's so many imponderables, and they're not discussed.
[02:45:34.948 --> 02:45:36.633]  I mean, why does Russia stand aside?
[02:45:37.964 --> 02:45:40.265]  Well, you said earlier Russia has now been betrayed.
[02:45:40.265 --> 02:45:47.247]  We know they've been trying to make deals with Barry Sotaro, known as Barack Obama, and that he's broken those.
[02:45:47.247 --> 02:45:50.828]  And then separately, we see the fear-mongering about these 11 Russian spies.
[02:45:50.828 --> 02:45:57.190]  You notice the Russian spies, and now Russia admits they're spies and want to do a swap, weren't infiltrating the government, because that's ceremonial.
[02:45:57.190 --> 02:46:01.352]  They were infiltrating Harvard and Wall Street, because that's who runs this country.
[02:46:03.206 --> 02:46:05.327]  Well you know they're not accused of spying.
[02:46:05.327 --> 02:46:07.047]  They haven't done any spying.
[02:46:07.047 --> 02:46:11.209]  They're accused of not registering as a foreign agent.
[02:46:11.209 --> 02:46:15.130]  But of course, APAC doesn't register as a foreign agent either.
[02:46:15.130 --> 02:46:20.572]  So I'm very suspicious of that whole thing and what it's about.
[02:46:20.572 --> 02:46:25.854]  Clearly it's not a case of spying because there's no spy charges brought against them.
[02:46:26.724 --> 02:46:30.426]  Yeah, they're just agents of influence, which is just what business is.
[02:46:30.426 --> 02:46:32.927]  But we don't even know they're that.
[02:46:32.927 --> 02:46:38.389]  It's also suspicious to me, Alex, that one of them confessed so quickly.
[02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:41.030]  It's almost like he's put there to confess.
[02:46:42.461 --> 02:47:01.842]  So maybe this is just another way of pressuring Russia to keep them on the defensive and sidelined while we proceed with the roll-up of Iran.
[02:47:03.543 --> 02:47:20.861]  Maybe that's the explanation, because it was very strange to have the Russian president here, meeting with Obama in the White House, and the Russians are falling all low themselves, trying to have good relations with us, despite us putting missile bases in Poland and everywhere else surrounding them.
[02:47:21.542 --> 02:47:23.042]  Turning Georgia into the North?
[02:47:44.767 --> 02:47:49.129]  I mean, it's incredible the baloney the American people are fed.
[02:47:49.129 --> 02:47:50.629]  I mean, I'm not for Russia.
[02:47:50.629 --> 02:47:52.170]  I'm an American.
[02:47:52.170 --> 02:47:57.472]  But I'm not going to sit here and lie and say that Russia attacked Georgia.
[02:47:57.472 --> 02:48:00.554]  I mean, it's like saying the moon's made out of cheese.
[02:48:00.554 --> 02:48:01.394]  Right, right.
[02:48:01.394 --> 02:48:02.314]  That's right.
[02:48:02.314 --> 02:48:05.596]  And the real question, though, you see, the European Union knows that.
[02:48:05.596 --> 02:48:12.659]  The European Union has made it clear that the Georgians, spurred on by the Americans, initiated that war.
[02:48:13.979 --> 02:48:20.563]  So why does the European Union continue to support the expansion of NATO?
[02:48:20.563 --> 02:48:24.344]  Why does it support the American war in Afghanistan?
[02:48:24.344 --> 02:48:32.248]  You know, they have European Union troops under the NATO flag fighting our battles in Afghanistan.
[02:48:32.248 --> 02:48:33.169]  So why?
[02:48:33.169 --> 02:48:41.213]  See, the real question is why do all these countries who've got nothing to gain from this and potentially a tremendous amount to lose
[02:48:42.372 --> 02:48:44.814]  Why are they giving us the green light?
[02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:45.694]  Well, we know why.
[02:48:45.694 --> 02:48:46.575]  We know why.
[02:48:46.575 --> 02:48:53.859]  And that's one reason the director was snapped up and put in prison decades after his reported crime.
[02:48:53.859 --> 02:49:01.203]  If you've seen the movie Ghost Rider, it's actually based on what's been declassified, that Tony Blair was MI6.
[02:49:01.203 --> 02:49:08.268]  And we know there's been a 50-year covert Western program to get the major leaders of Europe elected or compromised.
[02:49:09.128 --> 02:49:11.689]  And that much of Europe is run by U.S.
[02:49:11.689 --> 02:49:14.150]  British slash Israeli puppets.
[02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:18.893]  And so that's why Europe goes along because most of their leaders are actually U.S.
[02:49:18.893 --> 02:49:20.313]  intelligence.
[02:49:20.313 --> 02:49:21.894]  That's probably the case.
[02:49:21.894 --> 02:49:23.915]  We're certainly on the payroll.
[02:49:23.915 --> 02:49:26.316]  But why Russia and China?
[02:49:26.316 --> 02:49:30.518]  I mean, China is a very powerful state.
[02:49:30.518 --> 02:49:32.399]  They're our banker.
[02:49:32.399 --> 02:49:32.919]  Why do they
[02:49:34.448 --> 02:49:35.228]  But they have it now.
[02:49:35.228 --> 02:49:35.908]  They've got it.
[02:49:35.908 --> 02:49:37.189]  They don't need that anymore.
[02:49:37.189 --> 02:49:38.029]  They've got it.
[02:49:52.859 --> 02:50:00.783]  So maybe it's just they have a very short run time horizon on this particular issue.
[02:50:00.783 --> 02:50:02.503]  Or maybe it's just tradition.
[02:50:02.503 --> 02:50:04.584]  Maybe they're just going along.
[02:50:04.584 --> 02:50:14.589]  You know, for a century after the Roman Empire fell, the little principalities that grew up, they still put Caesar's head on their coins.
[02:50:16.974 --> 02:50:18.415]  Because.
[02:50:18.415 --> 02:50:21.556]  Otherwise, they thought people wouldn't trust the money.
[02:50:21.556 --> 02:50:25.457]  So, maybe it's something like that.
[02:50:25.457 --> 02:50:27.298]  Everyone thinks that we're a superpower.
[02:50:27.298 --> 02:50:28.238]  We're not a superpower.
[02:50:28.238 --> 02:50:30.979]  Look, we can't finance our own wars.
[02:50:30.979 --> 02:50:33.200]  We can't finance our own government.
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:38.882]  But we can hold everybody hostage with 50,000 nuclear weapons and bio-weapons.
[02:50:38.882 --> 02:50:39.142]  Maybe.
[02:50:40.879 --> 02:50:43.140]  And, you know, they got a lot of secret weapons as well.
[02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:43.700]  I mean, that's it.
[02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:45.741]  I mean, it's like a bank robber with a gun to your head.
[02:50:45.741 --> 02:50:52.003]  And, of course, the very same bank robbers robbing us, but a percentage of Americans still think it's patriotic to kill people.
[02:50:52.003 --> 02:50:54.504]  They can't find the country on a map, but it sure feels good.
[02:50:54.504 --> 02:50:57.185]  You know, it sure feels good.
[02:50:57.185 --> 02:51:00.527]  We're gonna take calls when we come back with Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, InfoWars.com.
[02:51:01.287 --> 02:51:10.794]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[02:51:10.794 --> 02:51:12.114]  My name is Crystal.
[02:51:12.114 --> 02:51:15.056]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[02:51:15.056 --> 02:51:19.019]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[02:51:19.019 --> 02:51:23.162]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[02:51:23.162 --> 02:51:24.002]  What did Crystal do?
[02:51:24.002 --> 02:51:26.424]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[02:51:27.945 --> 02:51:34.350]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:38.173]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[02:52:09.010 --> 02:52:14.112]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.112 --> 02:52:18.313]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.633 --> 02:52:21.094]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.094 --> 02:52:23.855]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.855 --> 02:52:26.777]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.777 --> 02:52:34.380]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.720 --> 02:52:40.101]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.101 --> 02:52:42.422]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.422 --> 02:52:46.643]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.643 --> 02:52:47.723]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.723 --> 02:52:49.044]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.044 --> 02:52:50.544]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:11.641 --> 02:54:17.484]  I tell you, we got like five, six people here making an Oklahoma City bombing film.
[02:54:17.484 --> 02:54:20.206]  And I've interviewed most of them in the past before.
[02:54:20.206 --> 02:54:21.026]  Great researchers.
[02:54:21.026 --> 02:54:25.208]  We'll try to get all three of them in here off and on.
[02:54:25.208 --> 02:54:31.031]  During the next hour that's coming up, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be with us for five minutes to the next hour.
[02:54:31.031 --> 02:54:31.792]  I want to get to Jeff.
[02:54:33.112 --> 02:54:48.837]  Damon, George, Kyle, Scott, while he's on with us in these next two short segments, but real fast, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, what's your take on the Gulf oil spill and the media being told they can't film or interview people and federal felonies and now the Coast Guard is our boss on land?
[02:54:48.837 --> 02:54:57.140]  It seems like any excuse government gets, it just stomps all over our rights, like Katrina with the gun confiscation.
[02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:57.600]  That's right.
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:54:59.721]  I mean, what else can you say about it?
[02:55:01.818 --> 02:55:05.081]  And what is going on that they don't want us to know?
[02:55:05.081 --> 02:55:07.803]  It's amazing.
[02:55:07.803 --> 02:55:08.704]  It's amazing.
[02:55:08.704 --> 02:55:09.365]  I don't know.
[02:55:09.365 --> 02:55:12.148]  I don't have any answer for that.
[02:55:12.148 --> 02:55:18.133]  I suppose they're just getting us used to accept illegal orders.
[02:55:18.133 --> 02:55:22.017]  You know, it's like if you fly, you get searched without warrants.
[02:55:24.393 --> 02:55:28.475]  They're just getting us used to living in a police state, I suppose.
[02:55:28.475 --> 02:55:29.636]  I don't know what else it is.
[02:55:29.636 --> 02:55:30.236]  No, that's it.
[02:55:30.236 --> 02:55:30.956]  It's disgusting.
[02:55:30.956 --> 02:55:32.617]  We've got to say no.
[02:55:32.617 --> 02:55:34.297]  Let's talk to Jeff in New Hampshire.
[02:55:34.297 --> 02:55:34.958]  You're on the air.
[02:55:34.958 --> 02:55:36.358]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:36.358 --> 02:55:36.918]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:36.918 --> 02:55:37.459]  How you doing?
[02:55:37.459 --> 02:55:43.501]  I just want to say right off the bat that you are the voice of our founding fathers in the 21st century.
[02:55:43.501 --> 02:55:44.021]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:44.021 --> 02:55:44.942]  I try my best, sir.
[02:55:44.942 --> 02:55:45.522]  What's on your mind?
[02:55:46.212 --> 02:55:51.235]  Well, basically, you know, listening to you talk to Dr. Roberts, I had a question.
[02:55:51.235 --> 02:56:01.902]  You know, being someone who has been educated, you know, has a degree in history, I did a bit of research, and I found that the 16th Amendment wasn't properly ratified.
[02:56:01.902 --> 02:56:05.904]  I mean, here in New Hampshire, there's no record that the state even ratified it at all.
[02:56:05.904 --> 02:56:06.804]  No, I've looked into that.
[02:56:06.804 --> 02:56:08.105]  I mean, it really wasn't ratified.
[02:56:08.105 --> 02:56:12.548]  Another fraud, another hoax to give us the income tax, and we built this country without it.
[02:56:12.548 --> 02:56:14.029]  What's your question for Roberts?
[02:56:14.602 --> 02:56:26.414]  Well, what I'm wondering is, is, you know, with the fact that our government is a business and, you know, a business is there, you know, getting paid for their services, here is our government not.
[02:56:27.282 --> 02:56:37.265]  Acting in our best interest, you know, where the 16th Amendment is an illegal amendment, you know, because of Secretary of State Knox saying... Look, it's more than that.
[02:56:37.265 --> 02:56:38.765]  It's Declaration of Independence.
[02:56:38.765 --> 02:56:41.066]  We got an out-of-control, corrupt government.
[02:56:41.066 --> 02:56:42.006]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:42.006 --> 02:56:42.966]  What do we do about that?
[02:56:42.966 --> 02:56:44.786]  And we have the Declaration of Independence.
[02:56:44.786 --> 02:56:50.268]  It's not just our right, it's our duty to remove this government and reform it as we see fit.
[02:56:50.868 --> 02:56:56.031]  But they've been quietly preparing to call us terrorists ahead of this collapse.
[02:56:56.031 --> 02:56:57.652]  They were getting ready for it.
[02:56:57.652 --> 02:56:59.033]  It's completely premeditated.
[02:56:59.033 --> 02:57:03.956]  I mean, what's your take on that?
[02:57:03.956 --> 02:57:06.918]  I mean, what do you do when you know you have a lawless government, Dr. Roberts?
[02:57:08.581 --> 02:57:16.283]  Well, you know, if you and I know we can't do much, we can try to tell other people before they arrest us.
[02:57:16.283 --> 02:57:20.124]  If everybody knew and didn't like it, then they could revoke.
[02:57:20.124 --> 02:57:22.444]  And I think that's where we are.
[02:57:22.444 --> 02:57:32.787]  If we want to get rid of this lawless government, it's not going to happen at the ballot box, and it's not going to happen because we get a third party or libertarians.
[02:57:32.787 --> 02:57:35.768]  If it happens at all, it's because people
[02:57:36.528 --> 02:57:40.129]  Catch on and do something about it.
[02:57:40.129 --> 02:57:47.970]  And by then, as you say, there may be too powerful a force to do anything about it.
[02:57:47.970 --> 02:57:52.171]  The caller is appealing to the law.
[02:57:52.171 --> 02:57:57.112]  He's saying, look, this income tax, it's not legal.
[02:57:57.112 --> 02:57:58.112]  It wasn't ratified.
[02:57:58.112 --> 02:57:59.652]  It's still unconstitutional.
[02:57:59.652 --> 02:58:03.833]  And yet we've had it for almost 100 years.
[02:58:03.833 --> 02:58:04.653]  And how can that be?
[02:58:07.952 --> 02:58:10.154]  We don't have any part of the Constitution.
[02:58:10.154 --> 02:58:13.676]  We don't have habeas corpus.
[02:58:13.676 --> 02:58:15.718]  We have laws against torture.
[02:58:15.718 --> 02:58:17.679]  American laws.
[02:58:17.679 --> 02:58:18.920]  It's lawlessness.
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:20.681]  It's nothing new.
[02:58:20.681 --> 02:58:21.362]  No, I mean, that's it.
[02:58:21.362 --> 02:58:22.943]  We don't just have a corrupt government, folks.
[02:58:22.943 --> 02:58:29.808]  We have a premeditated, lawless, criminal group that is breaking and violating laws to set precedents.
[02:58:29.808 --> 02:58:30.849]  They are dominating us.
[02:58:30.849 --> 02:58:34.251]  They are enforcing their will of evil upon us.
[02:58:34.251 --> 02:58:37.314]  Back in 70 seconds, we'll jam in a few more calls with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:58:38.499 --> 02:58:44.688]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:44.688 --> 02:58:48.654]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.839 --> 02:58:51.600]  Listen up, folks.
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:52.540]  This is important.
[02:58:52.540 --> 02:58:53.641]  Alex Jones here.
[02:58:53.641 --> 02:59:02.008]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy-to-fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.
[02:59:02.008 --> 02:59:07.832]  We have looming evacuations in the southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.
[02:59:07.832 --> 02:59:09.814]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[02:59:10.134 --> 02:59:13.315]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[02:59:13.315 --> 02:59:18.476]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.

[02:59:53.817 --> 02:59:56.219]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.219 --> 02:59:58.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:13.989 --> 03:00:17.010]  Okay, we're into the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:17.010 --> 03:00:27.314]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the best-selling author of The Tyranny of Good Intentions, former Wall Street Journal editor, father of Reaganomics, head of Policy, Department of Treasury under Reagan, is our guest.
[03:00:27.314 --> 03:00:30.076]  We're just jamming in a few calls here at the tail end.
[03:00:30.076 --> 03:00:33.517]  Damon in South Carolina, quick question or comment for Dr. Roberts.
[03:00:34.130 --> 03:00:34.530]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:34.530 --> 03:00:35.910]  I have one comment, one question.
[03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:36.831]  I'll give the comment quick.
[03:00:36.831 --> 03:00:52.295]  I think one of the reasons why Iran is not really fighting back yet is at least some people, I'm sure, in the government have bought into the whole martyrdom situation and that if they are sacrificed, at least the rest of Islam and the world will rise up and avenge them, so to speak.
[03:00:52.295 --> 03:00:53.955]  That's one thought that I have.
[03:00:53.955 --> 03:00:55.015]  The question I have is this.
[03:00:55.015 --> 03:00:57.956]  My wife is from the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Belarus.
[03:01:00.018 --> 03:01:01.660]  I'm 37, she's 36.
[03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:15.677]  She tells me a story that when she was younger and perestroika happened and basically her parents' life savings went from having enough money to buy a lot to not enough money to even buy a bicycle almost overnight.
[03:01:15.677 --> 03:01:17.038]  It was a very short period of time.
[03:01:17.899 --> 03:01:33.265]  And my question to Dr. Roberts is, um, I thought about buying gold, but, you know, if you have what, you know, Roosevelt did or what, um, our government did in the, uh, you know, almost a century ago where, you know, you have a crisis and they come in and they start calling in all the gold.
[03:01:33.265 --> 03:01:35.286]  Well, you have to ignore that at that point.
[03:01:35.286 --> 03:01:36.766]  Nothing's bulletproof, nothing.
[03:01:36.766 --> 03:01:38.887]  I mean, you get in your car every day, you may die.
[03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:42.008]  It's the safest thing out there, history has shown, but nothing's safe.
[03:01:42.008 --> 03:01:43.289]  Dr. Roberts, comments on that?
[03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.580]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:52.943]  In Roosevelt's days, the Americans were extremely gullible and even more naive than today.
[03:01:52.943 --> 03:01:54.364]  But there's always silver.
[03:01:54.364 --> 03:02:00.706]  You know, if you start going to a grocery store with gold, you'll have, you know, bad times arrive.
[03:02:00.706 --> 03:02:02.927]  You'll have trouble getting change.
[03:02:02.927 --> 03:02:06.728]  And you may find armed people waiting on you when you leave the store.
[03:02:09.179 --> 03:02:18.644]  I think everybody should have some sort of precious metal capability to see them through a period in which the money could be inflated away.
[03:02:18.644 --> 03:02:20.826]  Yeah, I mean, nothing's bulletproof.
[03:02:20.826 --> 03:02:22.587]  Nothing is a silver bullet.
[03:02:22.587 --> 03:02:25.728]  The closest thing to a silver bullet is silver, pun intended.
[03:02:25.728 --> 03:02:27.970]  But no, I mean, that's the point of this tyranny.
[03:02:27.970 --> 03:02:29.090]  Nothing is safe.
[03:02:29.090 --> 03:02:31.732]  The only thing that's safe is liberty and freedom.
[03:02:31.732 --> 03:02:33.893]  That's the engine of everything good, Damon.
[03:02:33.893 --> 03:02:34.913]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:34.913 --> 03:02:37.315]  George in Connecticut, last caller for Dr. Roberts.
[03:02:37.315 --> 03:02:37.655]  Go ahead.
[03:02:38.351 --> 03:02:38.651]  I don't
[03:02:58.669 --> 03:02:58.969]  I agree.
[03:02:58.969 --> 03:03:01.991]  The globalists have already moved their second base to China.
[03:03:01.991 --> 03:03:03.052]  That's a great point.
[03:03:03.052 --> 03:03:04.433]  Do you have a question?
[03:03:13.837 --> 03:03:19.826]  Yes, the question is, why doesn't Turkey maybe get in between the United States and say, look, you can't do this.
[03:03:19.826 --> 03:03:21.127]  The U.N.
[03:03:21.127 --> 03:03:22.469]  doesn't allow this.
[03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:23.851]  We didn't agree on this.
[03:03:23.851 --> 03:03:27.937]  Well, Turkey has now said if Israel doesn't apologize, they're breaking off ties.
[03:03:27.937 --> 03:03:28.398]  Good points.
[03:03:28.398 --> 03:03:29.780]  Let's get Dr. Roberts' take on that.
[03:03:30.894 --> 03:03:33.876]  Well, you know, Turkey's a NATO member.
[03:03:33.876 --> 03:03:39.239]  And so they're kind of got a foot in both camps.
[03:03:39.239 --> 03:03:46.184]  I think the Chinese may be betting that we will overreach and destroy ourselves.
[03:03:46.184 --> 03:03:55.010]  But they're taking an enormous risk because we, if we don't, we intend to deny them access to energy.
[03:03:55.010 --> 03:03:58.332]  And so they should see that as a greater threat than they do.
[03:03:59.312 --> 03:03:59.912]  Well, that's right.
[03:03:59.912 --> 03:04:07.258]  They're encircling China, but then also allowing them to get oil, but to only buy it from the Western power bloc.
[03:04:07.258 --> 03:04:12.802]  And the stated policy is to encircle Russia and China, and down the road have a war with them.
[03:04:12.802 --> 03:04:20.447]  And I mean, how do these lunatic neocons that still run things sneak attack Russia, and now it comes out Cheney wanted to have nuclear war?
[03:04:20.447 --> 03:04:23.670]  I mean, these people are mentally ill at their foundation.
[03:04:24.170 --> 03:04:34.779]  Yes, when I was in Washington, in the government, and running around with big shots, the nuclear soldiers, they very much desired to have a war with Russia.
[03:04:34.779 --> 03:04:44.528]  They wanted to defeat the Soviet Union militarily, and they got very angry when Reagan worked out a deal with Gorbachev and ended the Cold War.
[03:04:44.528 --> 03:04:45.949]  They just got very angry.
[03:04:45.949 --> 03:04:46.810]  They didn't like that.
[03:04:48.011 --> 03:04:48.811]  Amazing.
[03:04:48.811 --> 03:04:53.255]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, we've got to have you back on to talk about that piece of history that you witnessed in the future.
[03:04:53.255 --> 03:04:53.795]  God bless you.
[03:04:53.795 --> 03:04:56.738]  Thanks for the time.
[03:04:56.738 --> 03:04:57.198]  You bet.
[03:04:57.198 --> 03:04:58.259]  All right, we'll be right back.
[03:04:58.259 --> 03:04:59.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[03:04:59.700 --> 03:05:00.661]  We've got a guest in studio.

[03:06:00.350 --> 03:06:04.913]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:04.913 --> 03:06:05.834]  Number 1.
[03:06:05.834 --> 03:06:09.256]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.256 --> 03:06:10.117]  Number 2.
[03:06:10.117 --> 03:06:15.000]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:15.741]  It's true.
[03:06:15.741 --> 03:06:20.624]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:20.624 --> 03:06:21.444]  Number 3.
[03:06:21.444 --> 03:06:25.027]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:25.027 --> 03:06:28.950]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:29.210]  Number 4.
[03:06:29.730 --> 03:06:32.491]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:32.491 --> 03:06:36.152]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:36.152 --> 03:06:36.952]  Number 5.
[03:06:36.952 --> 03:06:41.094]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.094 --> 03:06:46.155]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:06:46.155 --> 03:06:50.337]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:30.735]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[03:07:30.735 --> 03:07:32.237]  Buy American and stay clean.

[03:07:58.538 --> 03:08:01.440]  Thank you.
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:06.843]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.843 --> 03:08:09.105]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:12.008 --> 03:08:15.591]  We've got 52 minutes left in broadcast today.
[03:08:15.591 --> 03:08:17.372]  Wednesday, July 7, 2010.
[03:08:20.646 --> 03:08:37.254]  And I know that the Oklahoma City bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah building was 15 years ago, but it's more important than ever because on all these television documentaries, they're invoking it again and saying that people that are against the New World Order and people that are against the federal government taking over in health care, they're terrorists.
[03:08:37.254 --> 03:08:38.815]  They're going to kill you.
[03:08:38.815 --> 03:08:40.395]  And Alex Jones wants violence.
[03:08:40.395 --> 03:08:43.317]  He wants to kill you when we actually call for the opposite.
[03:08:43.997 --> 03:08:44.297]  I don't know.
[03:09:06.616 --> 03:09:06.996]  I don't think so.
[03:09:22.282 --> 03:09:22.762]  I don't think so.
[03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:41.331]  We've got two of them in here now.
[03:09:41.331 --> 03:09:51.576]  Towards the end, I may try to get one of the other fellows in here who I've interviewed before, who's got great connections and research between Oklahoma City 15 years ago and 9-11 nine years ago.
[03:09:51.576 --> 03:09:52.336]  So that's coming up.
[03:09:52.336 --> 03:09:56.478]  But in other news, this is the type of stuff comes across my desk every day.
[03:09:56.478 --> 03:10:01.100]  This is out of the Korea Times, and it says, can good emerge from BP oil spill?
[03:10:01.100 --> 03:10:03.441]  And this is by Kenneth Rogoff.
[03:10:03.441 --> 03:10:06.883]  And Rogoff was the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
[03:10:07.563 --> 03:10:10.065]  Which is openly trying to set up world government.
[03:10:10.065 --> 03:10:21.216]  And he says, the fact that BP oil spill is on the cusp of becoming a political game changer of historic proportions, we may get a carbon tax long advocated by a broad spectrum of economists.
[03:10:21.216 --> 03:10:26.521]  It is a generalized version of a gas tax that hits all forms of carbon emissions, including from coal and natural gas.
[03:10:26.521 --> 03:10:31.366]  In principle, one could create a cap and trade system of qualitative restrictions and accomplishments.
[03:10:31.866 --> 03:10:38.752]  Much the same thing, and it seems to be more palatable to politicians who will jump through hoops to avoid using the word tax.
[03:10:38.752 --> 03:10:46.338]  So the World Bank and the former IMF head, because it's one group, they're basically saying we're going to get a carbon tax out of that.
[03:10:46.338 --> 03:10:47.679]  Interesting little tidbit.
[03:10:47.679 --> 03:10:55.026]  But don't worry, we got thousands of emails with the heads of the UN program hiding the fact that the Earth's been cooling for 10 years.
[03:10:55.866 --> 03:10:56.346]  I think?
[03:11:16.394 --> 03:11:20.741]  Joseph Goebbels run the Nuremberg trials on Hitler.
[03:11:20.741 --> 03:11:24.486]  Or having Bugsy Siegel run the trial of Al Capone.
[03:11:24.486 --> 03:11:28.612]  Or having the Genoveses investigate the Gambinos.
[03:11:28.612 --> 03:11:31.536]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:11:32.537 --> 03:11:34.799]  I mean, it's worse than the fox guarding the hen house.
[03:11:34.799 --> 03:11:38.122]  And we have a key article by Steve Watson up at prisonplanted.com.
[03:11:38.122 --> 03:11:40.364]  Climategate whitewash complete.
[03:11:40.364 --> 03:11:42.886]  Third inquiry clears everyone involved.
[03:11:42.886 --> 03:11:44.547]  And then we have our top stories today.
[03:11:44.547 --> 03:11:45.888]  They're up on GCNlive.com.
[03:11:47.890 --> 03:11:51.332]  That's GCN, the initials, GCNLive.com.
[03:11:51.332 --> 03:11:53.593]  That's the Genesis Network that syndicates this show.
[03:11:53.593 --> 03:11:57.335]  New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscations.
[03:11:57.335 --> 03:12:05.760]  We have the Fox News clip there from the local news and photos of the gun searches and confiscations going on in America at GCNLive.com.
[03:12:06.420 --> 03:12:09.222]  And we also have some other reports up on GCNlive.com.
[03:12:09.222 --> 03:12:14.886]  Polish troops trained to take on American terrorists in our 25-minute video report.
[03:12:14.886 --> 03:12:18.668]  I sent two reporters for a week, two weeks ago, to Chicago.
[03:12:18.668 --> 03:12:20.169]  That report is now filed.
[03:12:20.169 --> 03:12:25.552]  Foreign troops training for gun confiscation on video and to take the American people on as terrorists.
[03:12:25.552 --> 03:12:27.794]  That's all up at GCNlive.com.
[03:12:27.794 --> 03:12:31.176]  So just unbelievably important information.
[03:12:31.176 --> 03:12:35.339]  Now for the balance of the hour, turning to guys who we could have on for 10 hours.
[03:12:35.919 --> 03:12:36.079]  I don't
[03:12:53.675 --> 03:13:07.123]  Explaining why Oklahoma City's important, giving the basic facts, and then you had some nice government documents about Jolly and West, the admitted mind control head, MKUltra doctor, along with Ewing Cameron, being McVeigh's doctor throughout this whole thing.
[03:13:07.123 --> 03:13:13.327]  I mean, you can't, a science fiction writer couldn't come up with stuff this bizarre and in our face.
[03:13:13.327 --> 03:13:17.270]  So, Will, talk about that today and who you think McVeigh really was.
[03:13:17.270 --> 03:13:18.971]  So, Chris Emery, why don't you take it first?
[03:13:19.491 --> 03:13:21.773]  Well, thanks for having us on, Alex.
[03:13:21.773 --> 03:13:30.481]  The reason Oklahoma City is still relevant today is that it is a script that the federal government has followed for the last, I'd say, 35 years.
[03:13:30.481 --> 03:13:31.582]  And it's easy to see
[03:13:32.682 --> 03:13:41.228]  When an action comes up like 9-11 or these militia raids and so forth, you know, pretty much, you set up a clipboard and you know exactly what's going to happen.
[03:13:41.228 --> 03:13:47.973]  And even before I get into filmmaking and the truth movement, so to speak, or research on this, I was listening to your shows and I said, you know what?
[03:13:47.973 --> 03:13:48.533]  Alex is right.
[03:13:48.533 --> 03:13:49.394]  You hit all of the points.
[03:13:50.134 --> 03:13:52.235]  And it's easy to see how they do this.
[03:13:52.235 --> 03:13:53.315]  And they have no compunction.
[03:13:53.315 --> 03:13:54.195]  They're not embarrassed.
[03:13:54.195 --> 03:13:56.656]  They're actually very proud of the fact that they repeat these.
[03:13:56.656 --> 03:13:57.817]  And it's insidious.
[03:13:57.817 --> 03:13:59.517]  It doesn't get any worse than that.
[03:13:59.517 --> 03:14:00.978]  People need to wake up.
[03:14:00.978 --> 03:14:03.599]  And they need to know, not only Oklahoma City, but Waco.
[03:14:03.599 --> 03:14:06.400]  It's a consistent trail of events.
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:07.540]  And it gets worse.
[03:14:07.540 --> 03:14:09.121]  The body count is worse as it goes along.
[03:14:10.001 --> 03:14:14.969]  What we're trying to do with this film is bring out a lot of the information that people haven't been exposed to.
[03:14:14.969 --> 03:14:18.875]  James is going to elaborate on footage that has never been seen before, that has come our way.
[03:14:18.875 --> 03:14:19.737]  We're going to highlight that.
[03:14:19.737 --> 03:14:22.861]  You're interviewing Terence Yeagy's family about how they murdered him?
[03:14:22.861 --> 03:14:24.224]  I mean, you're getting all the interviews.
[03:14:24.224 --> 03:14:24.484]  Yes, sir.
[03:14:25.305 --> 03:14:36.528]  So, anyway, we want to bring a completely fresh perspective on this, information that has never been revealed before, and we are very grateful for having the opportunity to be on here to reveal this information.
[03:14:36.528 --> 03:14:37.469]  Well, I'm glad to have you here.
[03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:40.189]  This was just an apathos that you're here to interview me for the film.
[03:14:40.189 --> 03:14:41.550]  I'm honored to be part of that.
[03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:47.812]  But, I mean, get into just the... Let's say you had three minutes on national TV.
[03:14:47.812 --> 03:14:51.833]  What would you say to the public about Oklahoma City to get them to realize what really happened?
[03:14:52.574 --> 03:14:55.476]  Twelve people were involved that we know of, as many as eighteen.
[03:14:55.476 --> 03:15:00.480]  The scripted two perps and nobody else involved is complete bunk.
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:04.102]  That is a slap in the face to the victim's family members and survivors.
[03:15:04.102 --> 03:15:07.404]  People need to realize that we are going to expose information.
[03:15:07.404 --> 03:15:10.487]  We choose to remember the deaths of these people in the truth versus a lie.
[03:15:11.327 --> 03:15:18.770]  The second thing is that there were so many people, so much resources, there was more money spent covering up this case than actually investigating in the proper manner.
[03:15:18.770 --> 03:15:20.910]  The federal government actually went backwards.
[03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:26.932]  They did a complete U-turn on all of the ethics, all of the integrity, all of the resources, the professional, everything they had.
[03:15:26.932 --> 03:15:32.274]  They threw it right out the window just to make sure that this was covered up because we know that there were actually assets, government assets.
[03:15:32.594 --> 03:15:38.068]  Both the United States and elsewhere, overseas, that were involved in making sure that this thing came down.
[03:15:38.068 --> 03:15:41.596]  They were supposed to stop it at the last minute and it backfired right at their feet.
[03:15:42.742 --> 03:15:45.964]  Well, and that's what they always tell the mid-level people, is, oh, we're going to stop this.
[03:15:45.964 --> 03:15:58.110]  Just like in the first World Trade Center attack, right before Waco, I mean, they hired an Egyptian security agent, Ahmad Salam, had him cook a real bomb, and he's going, look, you're going to let the bombing go forward?
[03:15:58.110 --> 03:15:59.231]  He knew they were setting him up.
[03:15:59.231 --> 03:15:59.631]  Exactly.
[03:15:59.631 --> 03:16:04.574]  So he recorded them, and that came out in the New York Times and CBS, and they said, look, let it go ahead and happen.
[03:16:05.094 --> 03:16:05.555]  We're good to go.
[03:16:20.011 --> 03:16:26.398]  I think the one thing that stood out to me the most as I'm doing my research was the AMFO bomb, the story that it was AMFO that was used.
[03:16:26.398 --> 03:16:30.742]  The ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixture would create a cloud of nitric gas.
[03:16:30.742 --> 03:16:37.529]  Well, we know because of the Terenshiki story that he was there within minutes of the bombing pulling Tom Hall out.
[03:16:37.529 --> 03:16:39.672]  Nobody had any problems with respiration.
[03:16:39.672 --> 03:16:41.774]  We know VZ Lawton, he was there, he's a survivor.
[03:16:41.994 --> 03:16:42.835]  Nobody smelled it.
[03:16:42.835 --> 03:16:45.697]  I mean, and of course, General Parton, the building blown out, not in.
[03:16:45.697 --> 03:16:46.438]  Right.
[03:16:46.438 --> 03:16:51.922]  And so, I mean, if it was not, if it was AMFO, there would have been a huge nitric gas cloud over the building.
[03:16:51.922 --> 03:16:57.166]  And initially, right, the minutes after the bombing, the wind was blown right into the building where VZ Lawton was.
[03:16:57.166 --> 03:16:58.187]  Nobody had any problems with that.
[03:16:58.487 --> 03:17:01.529]  So, I mean, that disproves that AMFA was used.
[03:17:01.529 --> 03:17:07.993]  We have evidence, the 40-year anniversary of a bombing in Madison, Wisconsin, is coming up this August.
[03:17:07.993 --> 03:17:16.638]  And 23 people were sent to the hospital after the first responders were sent to the hospital because they were overcome with the fumes.
[03:17:16.638 --> 03:17:20.060]  So we know that that's the pattern of it, and they expect us to believe this.
[03:17:20.060 --> 03:17:24.363]  It gets so cartoonish, it's almost like Wile E. Coyote tiptoeing in with the Acme bomb.
[03:17:24.363 --> 03:17:26.504]  And this is what they expect the American people to believe.
[03:17:26.684 --> 03:17:30.448]  Then we have the footage of them removing the other bombs that didn't go off.
[03:17:30.448 --> 03:17:34.473]  I mean, and parts of the building blown across the street the opposite direction of the truck bomb.
[03:17:34.473 --> 03:17:41.301]  I mean, it just goes on, and then killing the cop that was exposing it, torturing him to death, and just, just, just, I mean, it goes on and on.
[03:17:41.721 --> 03:17:45.643]  Well, the story of Terence Heekie, you mentioned the video that we did on that.
[03:17:45.643 --> 03:17:47.585]  We just thought it was important for that story to be told.
[03:17:47.585 --> 03:17:49.266]  I mean, that man was a real hero.
[03:17:49.266 --> 03:17:52.168]  He worked himself beyond exhaustion to save people that day.
[03:17:52.168 --> 03:17:55.950]  And he said that the official story was not how it happened.
[03:17:55.950 --> 03:17:58.692]  And, you know, I mean, he was concerned for his safety.
[03:17:58.692 --> 03:18:00.793]  Right before they tortured him to death, he thought he'd been poisoned, right?
[03:18:00.973 --> 03:18:07.836]  Yeah, he was sick, they were talking about getting him to the hospital, and I think to protect his family, he kind of isolated himself from them.
[03:18:07.836 --> 03:18:13.259]  And he was on the way to a meeting that morning, and he never made it.
[03:18:13.259 --> 03:18:14.680]  They found him tortured to death.
[03:18:14.680 --> 03:18:26.766]  Yeah, the rope burns, possible rope burns on the neck, the angle of the shot, he bled out in the car, supposedly walked a quarter of a mile after bleeding out, and then shot himself at a downward angle.
[03:18:26.766 --> 03:18:30.328]  You know, again, ruled suicide immediately, and it's absurd.
[03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:43.678]  The information that we're getting, Alex, you listen to how you're doing on a break, is that there are good members of law enforcement, local, county, state, and federal level that have come forward, either admitted their identity or wanted to be anonymous.
[03:18:43.678 --> 03:18:47.341]  And there's a consistent pattern of, okay, this is the information that makes sense.
[03:18:47.341 --> 03:18:48.582]  What the federal government and their
[03:18:49.082 --> 03:18:51.643]  Like you said, the cartoonish story simply can't hold its own.
[03:18:51.643 --> 03:18:53.644]  There is no factual foundation on it.
[03:18:53.644 --> 03:19:04.750]  So we go back and we say, okay, we're going to present the information that we know is factual, reams of documentation, every single thing that we're going to have on the film will have a bibliography, and there's going to be reference on all of that.
[03:19:04.750 --> 03:19:06.131]  So there's no question.
[03:19:06.131 --> 03:19:07.972]  And we're going to paint a completely different story.
[03:19:07.972 --> 03:19:09.833]  We need to get the truth out on this.
[03:19:09.833 --> 03:19:14.856]  People will have that as a foundation, just like a lot of your movies, to make a judgment call on what's going to happen in the future.
[03:19:14.856 --> 03:19:15.476]  They have to know.
[03:19:15.856 --> 03:19:24.303]  Well, then you've got the FBI coming and brandishing guns at Hoppy Heidelberg, the head grand juror's house, and telling him, you're not going to call these witnesses, you're going to shut up.
[03:19:24.303 --> 03:19:26.384]  I mean, you have the motive.
[03:19:26.384 --> 03:19:31.028]  I mean, Bill Clinton on Air Force One a year after the attack, they said, why did you get reelected?
[03:19:31.028 --> 03:19:32.149]  Your approval rating was way down.
[03:19:32.149 --> 03:19:32.869]  It went way back up.
[03:19:32.869 --> 03:19:34.451]  He said, Oklahoma City got me reelected.
[03:19:35.051 --> 03:19:37.814]  Well, I mean, that's why Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag.
[03:19:37.814 --> 03:19:42.558]  The whitewater documents were housed in the building for the whole investigation.
[03:19:42.558 --> 03:19:44.380]  He was going to go down like a lead balloon.
[03:19:44.380 --> 03:19:45.121]  It was unbelievable.
[03:19:45.121 --> 03:19:48.924]  May of that year, congressional hearings were going to take him down on the whitewater investigation.
[03:19:48.924 --> 03:19:50.926]  Let's fix this all in one shot.
[03:19:50.926 --> 03:19:57.473]  Blow that building, make sure there's kids inside, people love images of them, and get rid of them documents at the same time.
[03:19:57.473 --> 03:19:59.334]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.593 --> 03:20:03.976]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:20:03.976 --> 03:20:06.178]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:20:06.178 --> 03:20:09.521]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:20:09.521 --> 03:20:14.607]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:20:14.607 --> 03:20:18.811]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:20:19.111 --> 03:20:21.472]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:20:21.472 --> 03:20:24.353]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:20:24.353 --> 03:20:27.254]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:20:27.254 --> 03:20:34.857]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:20:35.197 --> 03:20:40.601]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:20:40.601 --> 03:20:42.903]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:20:42.903 --> 03:20:47.126]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:20:47.126 --> 03:20:48.207]  And I got news for you.
[03:20:48.207 --> 03:20:49.548]  You're everyone else.
[03:20:49.548 --> 03:20:51.049]  Invisible Empire.

[03:21:00.811 --> 03:21:10.833]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:10.833 --> 03:21:17.275]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:21:17.275 --> 03:21:26.117]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:26.497 --> 03:21:35.689]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:35.689 --> 03:21:40.295]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:40.295 --> 03:21:42.097]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[03:22:18.827 --> 03:22:20.828]  They are expensive payment plans.

[03:23:02.384 --> 03:23:03.505]  Alex Jones here.

[03:23:40.956 --> 03:23:41.557]  We're good.
[03:24:05.762 --> 03:24:13.188]  Alright, we're gonna go right back to our guest in studio, listening on the radio out there on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave Satellite XM.
[03:24:13.188 --> 03:24:17.452]  You can also watch us live, streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:24:17.452 --> 03:24:22.456]  Chris Emery, filmmaker, director, producer, living in Oklahoma City, known him for many years.
[03:24:22.456 --> 03:24:29.823]  And of course, James Lane, also doing great work, both making a Oklahoma City film set to come out in the winter of this year.
[03:24:30.143 --> 03:24:40.006]  Okay, you were going over incredible information about Jolly and West, other tidbits, things that are documented on record, but are so bizarre, it's where truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:24:40.006 --> 03:24:40.486]  Get into it.
[03:24:40.486 --> 03:24:48.068]  We've got a researcher, Wendy Painting, that has been uncovering these documents, and she's actually getting through information that the FBI hadn't even seen.
[03:24:48.068 --> 03:24:51.849]  It was actual records for the defense.
[03:24:51.849 --> 03:24:54.910]  And we've got a hold of Jolly West's resume.
[03:24:54.910 --> 03:24:58.451]  That's McVeigh's doctor from the time he gets arrested to his execution.
[03:24:59.831 --> 03:25:06.994]  And I always suspected that there was some link with, you know, mind control, psychological warfare.
[03:25:06.994 --> 03:25:12.157]  And sure enough, on the second page of his resume, we've got where he worked for the Tavistock Institute.
[03:25:12.157 --> 03:25:14.818]  Which is the top British mind control operation.
[03:25:14.818 --> 03:25:22.001]  And then, of course, he was in the MKUltra 77 hearings as the number two man in the world in the MKUltra program under Ewing Cameron.
[03:25:22.862 --> 03:25:32.050]  And now this is, Tavistock Institute has direct links back to when the Fabians absorbed the National Socialist Science through Project Paperclip.
[03:25:32.050 --> 03:25:35.493]  So, I mean, this guy was really the inheritor of that knowledge.
[03:25:35.493 --> 03:25:39.817]  And now he goes in to the location there in El Reno.
[03:25:39.817 --> 03:25:43.501]  In fact, guys, do a document cam shot of this.
[03:25:43.501 --> 03:25:45.422]  I'll keep going.
[03:25:45.422 --> 03:25:45.943]  In El Reno.
[03:25:45.943 --> 03:25:48.005]  And what did the warden say there?
[03:25:48.513 --> 03:25:52.555]  Well, the warden says he runs a clean operation that was at the Federal Correctional Facility.
[03:25:52.555 --> 03:25:55.557]  A mile and a half from where Terry Hickey's body was found, by the way.
[03:25:55.557 --> 03:26:01.041]  And when he found out that there were hypodermic needles on McVeigh's trace, that's it.
[03:26:01.041 --> 03:26:02.722]  I do not allow drugs.
[03:26:02.722 --> 03:26:03.742]  I don't allow paraphernalia.
[03:26:03.742 --> 03:26:04.463]  Nothing in my prison.
[03:26:04.463 --> 03:26:05.323]  What's going on here?
[03:26:05.323 --> 03:26:06.704]  Two weeks later, he was relieved.
[03:26:06.704 --> 03:26:08.205]  He was transferred to another facility.
[03:26:08.205 --> 03:26:15.249]  And that's how the Japanese created their mind control assassin ninjas was drugs and sex.
[03:26:15.249 --> 03:26:16.330]  But please continue.
[03:26:16.650 --> 03:26:23.734]  Well, uh, we see that, uh, they say that he was so drugged up, that McVeigh was so drugged up at that point that he would have admitted to assassinating Abraham Lincoln.
[03:26:23.734 --> 03:26:29.297]  Um, then, uh, Jolly West's protege, uh, took over after that, uh, Dr. John Smith.
[03:26:29.297 --> 03:26:33.059]  Now, he is currently, uh, in, in Psychiatric Department at Guantanamo Bay.
[03:26:33.059 --> 03:26:39.443]  So, again, these guys, uh, there's a constant... And they admit Guantanamo Bay has a CIA base on it where they do mind control study.
[03:26:39.443 --> 03:26:39.863]  Yeah.
[03:26:39.863 --> 03:26:40.823]  I mean, that's MSNBC.
[03:26:40.823 --> 03:26:41.784]  Yeah.
[03:26:41.784 --> 03:26:42.364]  Wow.
[03:26:42.364 --> 03:26:43.365]  Man, this is amazing.
[03:26:44.105 --> 03:26:50.248]  And there's transcripts that show where Jolly West is talking about working with Jack Ruby.
[03:26:50.248 --> 03:26:52.349]  I mean, he goes back that far.
[03:26:52.349 --> 03:27:00.312]  And the type of situation that Jack Ruby was going through and the mental stress that he dealt with and comparing that with McVeigh.
[03:27:00.312 --> 03:27:07.776]  McVeigh showed signs of post-traumatic stress, I'm sorry, Gulf War Syndrome, prior to being deployed.
[03:27:07.776 --> 03:27:12.578]  Dental visits, I mean, just an enormous number of dental visits in the military.
[03:27:13.218 --> 03:27:14.719]  Uh, you know, that doesn't happen.
[03:27:14.719 --> 03:27:16.301]  You know, what were they doing with this guy?
[03:27:16.301 --> 03:27:19.303]  Well, that's where they knock you out and you disappear a few days.
[03:27:19.303 --> 03:27:21.846]  And it's enough to pose solid questions, you know?
[03:27:21.846 --> 03:27:28.972]  Well, the state police, when he got pulled over, they said he was just... Yeah, go over what a cop said of him.
[03:27:28.972 --> 03:27:31.033]  He was out of his gourd.
[03:27:31.033 --> 03:27:37.959]  He was surprised to see that McVeigh was packing heat and he had several magazines of rounds on himself and in the car.
[03:27:39.389 --> 03:27:43.072]  The peculiar thing about Charlie Hanger, a lot of folks don't realize, it was his day off.
[03:27:43.072 --> 03:27:45.573]  He's 62 miles outside of his precinct.
[03:27:45.573 --> 03:27:56.300]  What in the world is Charlie Hanger doing, zooming up I-35, going after... In fact, he wasn't chasing anybody in particular, he was just cruising, and he stopped McVeigh for a speeding violation.
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:28:01.864]  And then to find out his tag was off, he wasn't registered, there was a lot of things that certainly posed a lot of questions.
[03:28:01.864 --> 03:28:04.125]  Number one, Charlie Hanger wasn't supposed to be there.
[03:28:04.125 --> 03:28:05.466]  So that's a huge red flag.
[03:28:05.766 --> 03:28:08.048]  No chemical residue on McVeigh at all.
[03:28:08.048 --> 03:28:09.108]  No explosive residue.
[03:28:09.108 --> 03:28:10.209]  They checked his ears.
[03:28:10.209 --> 03:28:11.390]  I mean, nothing.
[03:28:11.390 --> 03:28:16.833]  And of course, the Feds have grabbed all these surveillance tapes and FBI agents told the LA Times they've seen them.
[03:28:16.833 --> 03:28:18.354]  It shows McVeigh with these other men.
[03:28:18.354 --> 03:28:21.816]  So the Feds have these tapes, but they're saying they don't exist.
[03:28:21.816 --> 03:28:24.918]  How many tapes did they copy over?
[03:28:24.918 --> 03:28:29.481]  580 tapes were actually copied and contracted for by the federal government.
[03:28:30.061 --> 03:28:32.363]  Uh, there were survivors that sued for 24.
[03:28:32.363 --> 03:28:37.726]  The FBI lied, said, well, they didn't exist, and they said, well, we lied, but here's another lie.
[03:28:37.726 --> 03:28:43.689]  So, out of 580 tapes, there were 120 of interest, which means they had three copies of 120 tapes.
[03:28:43.689 --> 03:28:47.371]  That's five times more than the original amount that they... But the local news talked to the FBI agent.
[03:28:47.371 --> 03:28:50.573]  They say there's one from right over the truck, and you can see John Doe No.
[03:28:50.573 --> 03:28:51.754]  2 in McVeigh, big as Dallas.
[03:28:52.074 --> 03:29:02.359]  So, all of these things, this body of information literally comes at us by accident or by people that are conscientious, sitting on it for several years, and they come and say, look, we need to get this out.
[03:29:02.359 --> 03:29:12.103]  What do you make of all these people that were in prison with him and Terry Nichols and others with these signed affidavits that McVeigh was like, yeah, I was in black ops, we were setting up militias?
[03:29:12.483 --> 03:29:14.064]  I mean, that fits with the MO we had.
[03:29:33.096 --> 03:29:33.577]  Stay there.
[03:29:33.577 --> 03:29:34.517]  We got a long segment.
[03:29:34.517 --> 03:29:36.559]  I'm gonna try to quit injecting points there.
[03:29:36.559 --> 03:29:39.101]  There's so many, but let's go over who McVeigh was.
[03:29:39.101 --> 03:29:41.142]  Let's go over what's admitted.
[03:29:41.142 --> 03:29:46.266]  I mean, I mean this guy and for all you black ops people out there, you know, they're gonna set you up too.
[03:29:46.266 --> 03:29:47.867]  Okay, they enjoy burning you.
[03:29:47.867 --> 03:29:49.188]  Remember the MIAC report.
[03:29:49.188 --> 03:29:50.009]  They hate veterans.
[03:29:50.009 --> 03:29:51.610]  They hate cops.
[03:29:51.610 --> 03:29:53.011]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.011 --> 03:29:55.553]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.553 --> 03:29:58.215]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.970 --> 03:30:03.353]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:30:03.353 --> 03:30:05.575]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:30:05.575 --> 03:30:08.899]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:30:08.899 --> 03:30:14.005]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:30:14.005 --> 03:30:18.190]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:30:18.510 --> 03:30:20.852]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:30:20.852 --> 03:30:23.733]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:30:23.733 --> 03:30:26.655]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:30:26.655 --> 03:30:34.240]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:30:34.594 --> 03:30:39.979]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:30:39.979 --> 03:30:42.302]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:30:42.302 --> 03:30:46.526]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:30:46.526 --> 03:30:47.587]  And I got news for you.
[03:30:47.587 --> 03:30:48.928]  You're everyone else.
[03:30:48.928 --> 03:30:50.429]  Invisible Empire.

[03:31:00.868 --> 03:31:01.608]  Listen up, folks.
[03:31:01.608 --> 03:31:02.549]  This is important.
[03:31:02.549 --> 03:31:03.670]  Alex Jones here.
[03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:12.015]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy-to-fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.
[03:31:12.015 --> 03:31:17.839]  We have looming evacuations in the Southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.
[03:31:17.839 --> 03:31:19.840]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[03:31:20.160 --> 03:31:23.323]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[03:31:23.323 --> 03:31:28.507]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.

[03:31:38.675 --> 03:31:43.139]  This is Alex Jones wishing you and your family true independence this 4th of July.
[03:31:43.459 --> 03:31:48.062]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:32:05.572 --> 03:32:06.573]  What have we got?
[03:32:06.573 --> 03:32:09.035]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:32:09.035 --> 03:32:12.678]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:32:12.678 --> 03:32:14.941]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:32:14.941 --> 03:32:16.962]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:32:16.962 --> 03:32:18.664]  So they think they own our land?
[03:32:18.664 --> 03:32:19.985]  They think they own our water?
[03:32:19.985 --> 03:32:20.586]  Children?
[03:32:20.586 --> 03:32:21.687]  Our education?
[03:32:21.687 --> 03:32:22.527]  Our money?
[03:32:22.527 --> 03:32:26.191]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:32:26.551 --> 03:32:31.517]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:32:31.517 --> 03:32:32.538]  We have the facts.
[03:32:32.538 --> 03:32:33.720]  We have the Constitution.
[03:32:33.720 --> 03:32:34.621]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:32:34.621 --> 03:32:35.502]  We have common law.
[03:32:35.502 --> 03:32:38.025]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:38.025 --> 03:32:41.809]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:32:41.909 --> 03:32:46.850]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:32:46.850 --> 03:32:48.350]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:32:48.350 --> 03:32:49.451]  Don't tread on me.

[03:33:13.007 --> 03:33:19.129]  We're going right back to our guest with this intriguing information here in just a moment.
[03:33:19.129 --> 03:33:21.690]  But first, I want to tell you about Pure Water Freedom.
[03:33:21.690 --> 03:33:23.891]  Purewaterfreedom.com.

[03:33:27.832 --> 03:33:29.813]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[03:33:30.253 --> 03:33:35.776]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[03:33:35.776 --> 03:33:41.960]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower and bath filters.
[03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:43.881]  All their filters are made in the USA.
[03:33:43.881 --> 03:33:52.507]  Check out their banners on Prison Planet and InfoWars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com today to take control of your water supply.
[03:33:52.507 --> 03:33:57.370]  Or you can just trust the government and the hundreds of deadly chemicals they put in the water by design and not filter your water.
[03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:59.051]  Purewaterfreedom.com
[03:34:17.368 --> 03:34:29.878]  About just, you know, all the bizarre things here in these FBI reports and now the affidavits and all these witnesses and McVeigh telling people, yes, I'm a government agent and one day this is all going to come out.
[03:34:29.878 --> 03:34:36.743]  And then you see him on TV doing interviews, just looks like he's bombed out of his mind, looks like a complete drug addict on the side of the road.
[03:34:36.743 --> 03:34:41.306]  And he's got the top mind control doctor living because Cameron had died by then.
[03:34:41.306 --> 03:34:44.629]  Jolion West there in, you know, shooting him up with this stuff.
[03:34:44.629 --> 03:34:45.510]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:34:46.260 --> 03:34:53.407]  Well, you know, if they would just show us the tapes, you know, there's how many tapes that Jesse Trinidou tried to get?
[03:34:53.407 --> 03:35:00.133]  Jesse had contacted myself and a couple other survivors, members of the bombing committee, and he says, what locations should we ask for the tapes?
[03:35:00.133 --> 03:35:00.913]  And we gave it to him.
[03:35:00.913 --> 03:35:02.595]  He went to the federal government.
[03:35:02.595 --> 03:35:09.782]  They obfuscated, they delayed, they gave him stuff of video footage of people walking in buildings two blocks away, had nothing to do with the Murrah building at all.
[03:35:10.282 --> 03:35:11.402]  I saw that in the news and in papers.
[03:35:11.402 --> 03:35:12.282]  National security on these videos.
[03:35:12.282 --> 03:35:15.363]  Because it's national security that the globalists blew that building up.
[03:35:39.767 --> 03:35:40.387]  Right.
[03:35:40.387 --> 03:35:43.369]  And that's why we're calling the documentary A Noble Lie.
[03:35:43.369 --> 03:35:49.051]  That's from Plato's The Republic, where it's the lie that the elite tell to maintain social harmony in their position.
[03:35:49.051 --> 03:35:56.935]  You know, because, I mean, it was just, again, it was so ridiculous, they just keep perpetuating this lie and expect people to believe it, I guess, you know, national security.
[03:35:56.935 --> 03:35:58.775]  It would be against social harmony.
[03:36:00.436 --> 03:36:03.639]  If they would just show us the tapes, you know, it would answer all the questions.
[03:36:03.639 --> 03:36:08.164]  It would answer the John Doe questions, you know, as far as who was in the truck.
[03:36:08.164 --> 03:36:11.447]  Let's go back, before we get into that, because we left off of that.
[03:36:11.447 --> 03:36:12.729]  Who is McVeigh?
[03:36:12.729 --> 03:36:15.451]  I mean, this guy disappears out of the military.
[03:36:15.451 --> 03:36:17.894]  He's showing up at all these militias all over the country.
[03:36:17.894 --> 03:36:20.897]  He's telling family I'm black ops infiltrating militias.
[03:36:20.897 --> 03:36:23.159]  He's telling others I'm bringing narcotics in for the government.
[03:36:23.920 --> 03:36:25.201]  He was a sharpshooter in the U.S.
[03:36:25.201 --> 03:36:27.162]  Army during the first Persian Gulf War.
[03:36:27.162 --> 03:36:34.548]  In fact, he was so good that he was on the security detail for General Schwarzkopf, which means you really have to get your numbers, accuracy and everything.
[03:36:34.548 --> 03:36:35.749]  And he was commended.
[03:36:35.749 --> 03:36:42.874]  Ironically enough, he was given a medal of commendation when he was in prison, actually, in the county jail in Denver awaiting trial.
[03:36:42.874 --> 03:36:43.734]  That's how good he was.
[03:36:43.734 --> 03:36:45.376]  The Army was obligated to give him that medal.
[03:36:46.201 --> 03:36:52.583]  After he got out, the FBI lost track of him for, what we know, at least four months, as long as six months.
[03:36:52.583 --> 03:37:00.845]  And that's when he turned up with the Bill Bean story, up in South Dakota, or North Dakota, at, let's see here, it was the National Guard training base.
[03:37:00.845 --> 03:37:02.446]  Yeah, where they actually train in explosives.
[03:37:03.306 --> 03:37:08.647]  And there's clear video of him at the explosives base a year after he supposedly got out of the military.
[03:37:08.647 --> 03:37:12.068]  That's all been vetted out by linguistics experts from the University of Utah.
[03:37:12.068 --> 03:37:16.029]  Mr. Bean did a very good job, superb job, everything thorough research right there.
[03:37:16.029 --> 03:37:18.089]  So that's ironclad.
[03:37:18.089 --> 03:37:21.310]  He had at least four different identities that we know of.
[03:37:21.310 --> 03:37:26.791]  South Dakota driver's license, a Michigan driver's license, Arizona driver's license, and an Arkansas driver's license.
[03:37:26.791 --> 03:37:31.992]  He's just like Lee Harvey Oswald, who has now been declassified, was at a CIA base in
[03:37:33.092 --> 03:37:33.794]  I don't know.
[03:37:41.107 --> 03:37:45.450]  Now the people, it's one thing to ask McVeigh, it's the people that he actually surrounds himself with.
[03:37:45.450 --> 03:37:51.474]  Andrea Straussmeier, national from West Germany, dad's number three with the Helmut Kohl administration, traveling throughout the U.S.
[03:37:51.474 --> 03:37:56.918]  with an expired visa for four years, no gainful employment, all of his credit card bills are being paid for.
[03:37:56.918 --> 03:38:06.264]  Come to find out he actually had the passcode to the federal building in downtown Fort Worth, while he's trying to infiltrate these different militia groups, both in Texas and in Oklahoma.
[03:38:06.264 --> 03:38:10.887]  Four weeks before Oklahoma City bombing happened, he was literally kicked out of Texas by the militia groups.
[03:38:11.387 --> 03:38:18.574]  They actually scouted him going into the rear door of the federal courthouse, punching the keypad, the security keypad.
[03:38:18.574 --> 03:38:23.740]  24 hours later, they said, look, you got three days to get out of this state or else we can't guarantee your safety.
[03:38:23.740 --> 03:38:24.360]  Where does he go?
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:26.022]  Ellum City in Oklahoma.
[03:38:26.022 --> 03:38:26.663]  Unbelievable.
[03:38:26.663 --> 03:38:28.745]  And that's got the Southern Poverty Law Center running it.
[03:38:28.745 --> 03:38:29.245]  Absolutely.
[03:38:29.245 --> 03:38:31.347]  They're all over that like white on rice.
[03:38:31.347 --> 03:38:33.730]  So anyway, you wanted to talk about the tapes, I guess.
[03:38:33.730 --> 03:38:34.891]  We had other information on that.
[03:38:35.191 --> 03:38:36.572]  Well, no, we covered that.
[03:38:36.572 --> 03:38:41.396]  I mean, basically, they're just, if they just told us they caught on fire or something, it'd be at least more believable.
[03:38:41.396 --> 03:38:50.584]  But they just, you know, they're like, well, no, that all of the tapes, outside tapes in all the separate buildings, through separate security systems, all changed their tapes at the same time.
[03:38:50.584 --> 03:38:51.945]  You know, it's absurd.
[03:38:51.945 --> 03:39:00.612]  But we have FBI agents who told the LA Times and others, because I have these articles, that they have seen the videos and it shows Tim McVeigh with John Doe No. 2.
[03:39:01.112 --> 03:39:03.954]  Secret Service memorandum actually two weeks after the bombing.
[03:39:03.954 --> 03:39:04.574]  It's right there.
[03:39:04.574 --> 03:39:08.817]  That was actually entered in the state trial for Terry Nichols in March of 2005.
[03:39:08.817 --> 03:39:12.359]  And Nichols has signed an affidavit saying that McVeigh was black ops.
[03:39:12.359 --> 03:39:12.839]  Yes.
[03:39:12.839 --> 03:39:14.240]  He has no reason to make this stuff up.
[03:39:14.240 --> 03:39:17.282]  Terry has everything to lose and nothing to gain by that claim.
[03:39:17.282 --> 03:39:18.783]  What about the new guy that I interviewed?
[03:39:18.783 --> 03:39:19.223]  I mean, he's not new.
[03:39:19.223 --> 03:39:22.245]  He's been around for years, but we were able to get the first interview in over a decade.
[03:39:24.907 --> 03:39:34.293]  Mr. Cooper, and he was saying that McVeigh basically told him the same thing, and they told him, we won't execute you if you'll just shut up.
[03:39:34.293 --> 03:39:35.353]  David Paul Hammer.
[03:39:35.353 --> 03:39:38.355]  Hammer, Hammer, not Cooper.
[03:39:38.355 --> 03:39:40.116]  There's some very good information to support that.
[03:39:40.116 --> 03:39:45.419]  Again, David has some solid info, and Wendy has been able to corroborate a lot of that.
[03:39:45.419 --> 03:39:54.345]  Yeah, and Chris was actually able to go out and scout some locations that was talked about in the book that there's no way that David Paul Hammer would have that knowledge of that.
[03:39:54.865 --> 03:39:57.946]  Unless someone that was there, you know, told him about it.
[03:39:57.946 --> 03:40:04.707]  If I may preface this, Alex, before I decided to really jump feet first into this project, I took, in fact, Devin was with me, and we had a small film crew.
[03:40:04.707 --> 03:40:07.808]  We literally toured five miles around the crime scene.
[03:40:07.808 --> 03:40:10.788]  And we're trying to piece all of the stuff from the official story together.
[03:40:10.788 --> 03:40:11.949]  Didn't make any sense.
[03:40:11.949 --> 03:40:15.009]  Then we went back to what the committee had gathered in a 572-page report.
[03:40:15.009 --> 03:40:18.410]  The Oklahoma's Bombing Investigation Committee.
[03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:21.151]  Okcbombing.net, if you don't mind, we'll plug that.
[03:40:21.151 --> 03:40:22.572]  Yeah, led by Charles Key.
[03:40:22.572 --> 03:40:22.992]  Unbelievable.
[03:40:22.992 --> 03:40:23.633]  He's the state rep.
[03:40:23.633 --> 03:40:31.497]  So we went through that book over a matter of about four weeks and we're looking at all of these locations and we're literally painting a mosaic of, yes, this does make sense.
[03:40:31.497 --> 03:40:38.821]  Physically, these guys, the 12 perps and the additional six, they may or may have not known that they were working for the government in various capacities.
[03:40:38.821 --> 03:40:40.862]  They were at these locations and it was a
[03:40:41.602 --> 03:40:45.364]  At least four different groups working together in concert to make this thing go off.
[03:40:45.364 --> 03:40:49.887]  It wasn't two lone nuts driving an Anfo truck in front of the Murrah Building.
[03:40:49.887 --> 03:40:50.287]  It's ludicrous!
[03:40:50.287 --> 03:40:50.747]  It can't happen!
[03:40:50.747 --> 03:40:57.631]  And how long would it take, you know, 30 minutes or more for them to drive from that park in Kansas to the location in Oklahoma City?
[03:40:57.631 --> 03:41:01.053]  And by that point, the ammonium nitrate fuel oil mixture goes inert.
[03:41:01.053 --> 03:41:03.535]  They would have to have stopped along the way and remixed it.
[03:41:03.535 --> 03:41:09.098]  The Arabs, these 3,000 plus brought in by George Bush Sr.
[03:41:09.098 --> 03:41:10.359]  and then a couple thousand by Clinton,
[03:41:10.999 --> 03:41:15.563]  The media investigating them, claiming that they were connected in with some of these other people.
[03:41:15.563 --> 03:41:18.045]  From your deep research, is that a red herring?
[03:41:18.045 --> 03:41:25.933]  Because that looks like classic government ops, where they just have all sorts of other operations coming in at the same time to create a fog of war.
[03:41:25.933 --> 03:41:26.973]  Yes, it is.
[03:41:26.973 --> 03:41:29.816]  And there were actually stunt doubles of McVeigh that we know of.
[03:41:29.816 --> 03:41:31.918]  There were two teams that carried this thing off.
[03:41:31.918 --> 03:41:36.262]  One to actually do the dirty deed, and of course McVeigh and his useful idiots to take the fall.
[03:41:36.502 --> 03:41:38.704]  There were many concentric circles in play.
[03:42:07.045 --> 03:42:09.054]  It's appalling to see how they pull this off.
[03:42:09.054 --> 03:42:10.903]  Continuing with the concentric team, sorry.
[03:42:12.149 --> 03:42:15.790]  We have basically the two teams downtown.
[03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:17.950]  There were at least 12 individuals.
[03:42:17.950 --> 03:42:24.171]  They were sighted as early as 6 o'clock that morning, actually running, jogging the escape routes they were going to take.
[03:42:24.171 --> 03:42:34.593]  Well, at the same time, the Oklahoma bomb squad is at the courthouse across from the Murrell building, looking for explosives, and they never found any there.
[03:42:34.593 --> 03:42:37.174]  That says eyewitness reports saying that as early as 6 a.m.
[03:42:39.195 --> 03:42:39.535]  6.15 a.m.
[03:42:39.535 --> 03:42:49.282]  there was the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Department and the ATF actually doing a roadblock, a bottleneck, 10 blocks away checking vehicles for incendiary devices.
[03:42:49.282 --> 03:42:58.048]  What about the head of the FBI anti-terrorism crew lying and saying he was in Dallas and then got a flight but then later it was proven credit card receipts he was there days before?
[03:42:58.528 --> 03:43:01.210]  Danny Colson drove up at least 18 hours before.
[03:43:01.210 --> 03:43:03.812]  The credit card receipts at the Embassy Suites does corroborate that.
[03:43:03.812 --> 03:43:09.236]  So we're not quite sure why he chose to, as they say, distort the truth, but that's his deal.
[03:43:09.236 --> 03:43:11.918]  So credibility, right, it was gone.
[03:43:11.918 --> 03:43:13.939]  I can't believe anything he says.
[03:43:13.939 --> 03:43:21.925]  Ironically, Janet Reno removed him from the case four days after the bombing because he had basically turned and said, look, I show up for work every day.
[03:43:22.105 --> 03:43:23.426]  I'm supposed to do a good job on here.
[03:43:23.426 --> 03:43:25.306]  I want to investigate this case correctly.
[03:43:25.306 --> 03:43:27.507]  And she says, no, we don't need you on the team here.
[03:43:27.507 --> 03:43:29.708]  We're bringing in another team to completely corrupt this.
[03:43:29.708 --> 03:43:31.429]  What about ATF?
[03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:38.531]  Because you had some of the emergency crews saying ATF was there in bomb gear and in their raid gear saying, bandage me up.
[03:43:38.531 --> 03:43:39.432]  I was on the ninth floor.
[03:43:39.432 --> 03:43:43.934]  And they're like, everybody, it's on record that that thing was empty and they weren't on the ninth floor.
[03:43:43.934 --> 03:43:44.974]  The elevator was blown out.
[03:43:45.174 --> 03:43:45.774]  That's right.
[03:43:45.774 --> 03:43:46.255]  Exactly.
[03:43:46.255 --> 03:43:50.137]  In fact, it was Dr. Chumley that told these guys to take a flying leave.
[03:43:50.137 --> 03:43:52.158]  Tiffany Bible, she was a paramedic.
[03:43:52.158 --> 03:43:58.662]  She arrived four to five minutes after and she said that there were agents in full gear.
[03:43:58.662 --> 03:44:04.845]  And then you've got other witnesses saying that they overheard the ATF say, is this why we got the page not to come in today?
[03:44:04.845 --> 03:44:08.788]  So, I mean, there is an amount of evidence of foreknowledge.
[03:44:08.788 --> 03:44:12.850]  The FBI evacuation of the building, a separate building that morning,
[03:44:12.930 --> 03:44:18.657]  And it's because a very small part of the government's involved with foreign black ops and others that this does come out.
[03:44:18.657 --> 03:44:20.799]  People always say, well, this stuff would come out if it was real.
[03:44:20.799 --> 03:44:21.620]  It did come out.
[03:44:21.620 --> 03:44:22.161]  Yes.
[03:44:22.161 --> 03:44:24.644]  And in fact, it's out in full view right now.
[03:44:24.644 --> 03:44:27.447]  And that's why we're able to assemble all of the information.
[03:44:27.447 --> 03:44:33.094]  Folks, I can guarantee you right now, you have never heard, I'd say probably 70 percent of this has never been posted
[03:44:33.214 --> 03:44:41.136]  Well I'll tell you what, for your safety, I mean obviously the film's coming out in the winter and I can't wait to carry it at InfoWars.com and get it out to people.
[03:44:41.136 --> 03:44:50.999]  I know you guys are great researchers and have done a lot of original work, but for your own safety and for knowledge out there, I know you've already released some of this footage, it's so important, tell people some of the new developments you've discovered.
[03:44:51.883 --> 03:44:58.366]  We have over 10 hours of footage that hasn't been seen by the general public before, and over a thousand photographs.
[03:44:58.366 --> 03:45:07.511]  We've got excellent footage of the crater, and it's completely offset from the large bite in the building, and as General Partin said, that the building...
[03:45:09.352 --> 03:45:12.113]  First bomb would have been around the third floor.
[03:45:12.113 --> 03:45:22.438]  Well, you can actually see, I mean, it's probably, you know, 30-40 feet offset from the small crater where the car bomb was, and then the floors are actually concaved around the third floor.
[03:45:22.438 --> 03:45:26.900]  So, you can see, and that was the biggest bite in the building, where it blasted that out.
[03:45:26.900 --> 03:45:33.103]  You had people said that they heard what sounded like a rifle shot, a high-powered rifle shot, which is
[03:45:34.824 --> 03:45:36.886]  It works the same way with the C4.
[03:45:36.886 --> 03:45:39.167]  It wouldn't have been as loud of an explosion.
[03:45:39.167 --> 03:45:43.690]  And that's where you hear all of the survivors talking about rubble coming down.
[03:45:43.690 --> 03:45:44.951]  People getting under their desks.
[03:45:44.951 --> 03:45:48.914]  They had time to get under their desks and then the car bomb goes off outside.
[03:45:48.914 --> 03:45:50.515]  The bus tilts twice.
[03:45:50.515 --> 03:45:52.077]  Twice, six blocks away.
[03:45:52.077 --> 03:45:56.760]  Fourteen people were in that building, had enough wherewithal, the cognitive ability to take cover.
[03:45:56.980 --> 03:45:59.981]  That simply wouldn't have happened if they would have been hit.
[03:45:59.981 --> 03:46:01.682]  And you see the repeat with the Feds.
[03:46:01.682 --> 03:46:12.205]  They love to have their diversion, you know, the plane flies in, then the buildings blow up, and then no one notices the 47-story building not hit that falls in perfectly.
[03:46:12.205 --> 03:46:14.666]  We interviewed the guy who was the deputy head of emergency management.
[03:46:14.666 --> 03:46:19.268]  He says, yeah, there were bodies, you know, they blew it up, then he dies mysteriously.
[03:46:19.268 --> 03:46:21.228]  But, I mean, it's the same thing here.
[03:46:21.228 --> 03:46:26.090]  Real bombs go off, diversionary truck bomb, because the public's going to go, well, how did they get bombs inside?
[03:46:26.730 --> 03:46:30.615]  I mean, it's sick how their psychopathic brains work.
[03:46:30.615 --> 03:46:31.475]  It's criminology.
[03:46:31.475 --> 03:46:33.438]  They do the same stuff over and over again.
[03:46:33.438 --> 03:46:34.679]  And the lack of humanity.
[03:46:34.679 --> 03:46:37.082]  I mean, the children that were in the building.
[03:46:37.082 --> 03:46:37.903]  Well, it's a gambit.
[03:46:37.903 --> 03:46:40.986]  I mean, when you understand the military officer mind,
[03:46:41.747 --> 03:46:43.128]  And this goes back thousands of years.
[03:46:43.128 --> 03:46:44.428]  They write about it.
[03:46:44.428 --> 03:46:48.170]  You know, let's say you're Alexander the Great or you're Julius Caesar or somebody else.
[03:46:48.170 --> 03:46:57.495]  If you send out a detachment of, say, 50 guys into a valley where you know an army is set, but you want to draw them out and see their numbers, you know your 50 guys are going to get cut off and killed.
[03:46:57.495 --> 03:47:02.778]  But now your argument is that'll save 100,000 of your main army because now you've gotten that intel.
[03:47:03.058 --> 03:47:04.079]  The ends justify the means.
[03:47:04.079 --> 03:47:05.720]  And so the ends justifies the means.
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:06.861]  The noble lie.
[03:47:06.861 --> 03:47:08.763]  And so America needs to take over.
[03:47:08.763 --> 03:47:09.824]  The Arabs are dangerous.
[03:47:09.824 --> 03:47:11.005]  We're going to blow these buildings.
[03:47:11.005 --> 03:47:16.449]  And we need a Pearl Harbor-level event, as the PNAC document said by the Vice President, to get this done.
[03:47:16.449 --> 03:47:20.352]  And it's the same thing, Oklahoma City, they've got their collectivist world government.
[03:47:20.352 --> 03:47:24.295]  All these states were moving to get out of the UN and to declare a 10th Amendment.
[03:47:24.295 --> 03:47:26.777]  Well, we'll just blow the hell out of this building and blame it on the patriots.
[03:47:26.777 --> 03:47:27.318]  And that's what they did.
[03:47:27.318 --> 03:47:30.801]  Within 10 minutes, Bill Clinton said, talk radio, Rush Limbaugh, it's your phone.
[03:47:31.221 --> 03:47:36.645]  You know, and they're already digging this back up to demonize the renewed patriot movement in this country.
[03:47:36.645 --> 03:47:51.074]  You know, we've got a researcher, Kay Beach, who's going to talk about the MIAC report and the Department of Homeland Security right-wing extremism lexicon and how they use the Oklahoma City bombing to demonize the Tea Party.
[03:47:51.074 --> 03:47:56.238]  It's like, oh, if you believe in supporting the Constitution and you oppose tyranny, well, you're a McVeigh.
[03:47:56.238 --> 03:47:57.519]  You're one of those government haters.
[03:47:57.519 --> 03:47:58.680]  Oh, no, they say I'm a McVeigh.
[03:47:59.500 --> 03:48:05.486]  And boy, I tell you, the Southern Poverty Law Center and that Chris Matthews documentary, they call me by my first name.
[03:48:05.486 --> 03:48:09.710]  Oh, Alex, we're not saying he's going to cause violence, but his followers are.
[03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:14.074]  So now I guess I'm I've never talked to these people, but they're on a first name basis.
[03:48:14.074 --> 03:48:17.117]  That's how much they're because I know they don't like it that I talk about how they were running on.
[03:48:17.737 --> 03:48:26.143]  Well, we were doing the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing press conference at the same time there was a tea party going on outside in Oklahoma City.
[03:48:26.143 --> 03:48:30.866]  And this is at the time that there was a lot of talk about militias again.
[03:48:30.866 --> 03:48:32.246]  And nobody was really even talking about it.
[03:48:32.246 --> 03:48:37.330]  They were talking about like a volunteer force to take over because all the National Guards deployed.
[03:48:37.330 --> 03:48:41.572]  And we have a lot of natural disaster in Oklahoma and they wanted to have some volunteers ready to go in and help.
[03:48:41.572 --> 03:48:43.454]  And that's all that Charles... Civil defense!
[03:48:43.454 --> 03:48:47.076]  Yeah, 22 states have... Charles Key wants a militia to attack the government.
[03:48:47.296 --> 03:48:50.438]  And all of that information that came out was not on the tape.
[03:48:50.438 --> 03:48:51.859]  It was not in the interview.
[03:48:51.859 --> 03:48:56.101]  The editor took the reporter's story and completely fabricated all this stuff.
[03:48:56.101 --> 03:48:58.883]  Well, no, that's like Rand Paul.
[03:48:58.883 --> 03:49:03.045]  There's like a two-second delay and he's like, excuse me, yes, yes, I can hear you.
[03:49:03.045 --> 03:49:05.546]  Oh, you agree with getting rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[03:49:05.546 --> 03:49:06.087]  No, I don't.
[03:49:06.727 --> 03:49:09.628]  And then they ran the headline, he says, get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[03:49:09.628 --> 03:49:11.168]  I mean, these are hoaxers.
[03:49:11.168 --> 03:49:11.428]  Sure.
[03:49:11.428 --> 03:49:12.589]  These are slime bags.
[03:49:12.589 --> 03:49:13.869]  These are crooks.
[03:49:13.869 --> 03:49:21.551]  And it makes you wonder what they're cooking up, because in the public mind, they're trying to link a patriot movement to militias, to violence.
[03:49:21.551 --> 03:49:22.232]  Muslims.
[03:49:22.232 --> 03:49:22.812]  Yeah.
[03:49:22.812 --> 03:49:26.593]  So now they're trying to say that the militias have linked up with Al Qaeda.
[03:49:27.293 --> 03:49:33.375]  Can you believe those dirty American... I mean, yeah, the good old boys are working with Al-Qaeda, when that's admitted CIA.
[03:49:33.375 --> 03:49:35.536]  I mean, folks, they're getting ready to set you up.
[03:49:35.536 --> 03:49:41.618]  The offshore banks know you're awake to what they've done, and they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on you, unless we trump them with the info.
[03:49:41.618 --> 03:49:43.479]  And let me tell you, this hit in 15 years ago.
[03:49:43.479 --> 03:49:46.180]  People know about false flag terror now.
[03:49:46.180 --> 03:49:47.220]  It has entered the lexicon.
[03:49:47.594 --> 03:49:52.960]  And that's why it's so important for this information to get out now, because again, they're using it to demonize the renewed patriot movement in this country.
[03:49:52.960 --> 03:49:53.821]  You guys better hurry.
[03:49:53.821 --> 03:50:01.270]  They could stage more stack attacks, more Oklahoma cities any day.
[03:50:02.867 --> 03:50:06.929]  What we'd like to ask the viewers is to keep an open mind when this movie comes out.
[03:50:06.929 --> 03:50:09.171]  And thanks in no small part to you, Alex.
[03:50:09.171 --> 03:50:11.612]  I mean, you were definitely the support over the years.
[03:50:11.612 --> 03:50:13.393]  You were the inspiration for us to continue on.
[03:50:13.393 --> 03:50:19.297]  There were many times that we wanted to set this aside because literally, cognitive and mentally, it was so overwhelming.
[03:50:19.297 --> 03:50:20.197]  It was so bad.
[03:50:20.197 --> 03:50:20.978]  It was so deep.
[03:50:20.978 --> 03:50:22.819]  It was so far down the rabbit hole.
[03:50:22.819 --> 03:50:22.959]  But
[03:50:23.619 --> 03:50:27.983]  Well, when you know they're lying about that, then you start... everything's a lie.
[03:50:27.983 --> 03:50:28.463]  Exactly.
[03:50:28.463 --> 03:50:29.944]  Well, that's why we want to get the truth out.
[03:50:29.944 --> 03:50:37.610]  I mean, I believe that bravery is contagious, you know, and I'm a member of We Are Change, and I really take that to heart, that we have to be the change that we want to see in the world.
[03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:38.831]  It's an internal process.
[03:50:38.831 --> 03:50:40.853]  We can change the outside by changing the inside.
[03:50:41.093 --> 03:50:41.513]  Stay there.
[03:50:41.513 --> 03:50:42.254]  Final five minutes.
[03:50:42.254 --> 03:50:44.155]  Let's talk about that on the other side.
[03:50:44.155 --> 03:50:47.256]  Because if we don't expose Oklahoma City, we can't expose 9-11.
[03:50:47.256 --> 03:50:48.697]  We can't expose the Gulf of Tonkin.
[03:50:48.697 --> 03:50:50.618]  We can't expose these false flag events.
[03:50:50.618 --> 03:50:52.339]  They're using them to enslave us.

[03:52:06.211 --> 03:52:07.472]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.472 --> 03:52:11.253]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:11.253 --> 03:52:13.633]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.633 --> 03:52:19.015]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.495 --> 03:52:26.162]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[03:52:36.312 --> 03:52:40.595]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[03:52:46.560 --> 03:52:50.102]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[03:53:17.063 --> 03:53:19.285]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:53:19.285 --> 03:53:21.307]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:53:21.307 --> 03:53:22.628]  And if you're in debt already,

[03:54:03.450 --> 03:54:08.393]  All right, Aaron has worked on a 10-minute video that just went live with a story.
[03:54:08.393 --> 03:54:15.178]  Obama guilty of high treason, selling out sovereignty to Mexico with his suit against Arizona.
[03:54:15.178 --> 03:54:17.740]  Key video up on Infowars.com.
[03:54:17.740 --> 03:54:19.781]  It's just now going up there right now.
[03:54:19.781 --> 03:54:20.321]  Look at this one.
[03:54:20.321 --> 03:54:22.983]  This is out of KDVR out of Denver, Colorado.
[03:54:22.983 --> 03:54:26.085]  Thieves could go free while victim faces jail time.
[03:54:26.085 --> 03:54:28.447]  Two illegal aliens were stealing his trailer.
[03:54:28.447 --> 03:54:29.548]  He ran out, told them to stop.
[03:54:30.348 --> 03:54:30.648]  I don't
[03:54:49.503 --> 03:54:53.167]  Vander Newhoff is a really interesting fellow who I've interviewed before.
[03:54:53.167 --> 03:54:58.032]  We'll have him back on when the film comes out, but he's done deep research and he's part of the film team.
[03:54:58.032 --> 03:55:03.517]  Holland, you've worked on the Oklahoma City connections to Oklahoma.
[03:55:03.517 --> 03:55:05.039]  Just real fast, rattle some of those off.
[03:55:05.399 --> 03:55:08.180]  Well, we have a lot of concrete connections.
[03:55:08.180 --> 03:55:11.560]  For one, Hussein Al-Husseini, who was named as John Doe No.
[03:55:11.560 --> 03:55:21.803]  2 by Jayna Davis at KFOR-TV in Oklahoma, filmed, named specifically by witnesses on the scene as that was the man who was in the truck, Hussein Al-Husseini.
[03:55:21.803 --> 03:55:24.703]  He later works for Boston's Logan Airport on the day of 9-11.
[03:55:24.703 --> 03:55:25.884]  He was a baggage handler.
[03:55:25.884 --> 03:55:32.345]  And as I recall, two of the hijackers flew out of there and that's where their luggage went through and they found incriminating will and so forth.
[03:55:32.845 --> 03:55:39.331]  And then you have like Melvin Lattimore, a man whose original credit cards were used in the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
[03:55:39.331 --> 03:55:45.337]  He was a known confederate of Tim McVeigh and friends of Tim McVeigh in 1995 before the bombing.
[03:55:45.337 --> 03:55:50.181]  And later on, he was a roommate of the 20th hijacker, the 20th 9-11 hijacker.
[03:55:50.181 --> 03:55:55.466]  And the guy that got his head sawed off, he was at an airbase and loaned his laptop to one of the 9-11 people.
[03:55:56.087 --> 03:55:57.268]  The point is, this is a spy nest.
[03:56:15.518 --> 03:56:24.120]  So, I mean, there was at least one researcher who appeared before the 9-11 Commission to testify that Norman, Oklahoma was home to an Al-Qaeda cell prior to 9-11.
[03:56:24.120 --> 03:56:26.601]  Well, no one's ever been prosecuted or arrested in this cell.
[03:56:26.601 --> 03:56:33.223]  So, obviously, what was going on, there may have been some kind of logistics or support cell going on, but there were a lot of things going on.
[03:56:33.223 --> 03:56:40.065]  And the only way to view all of these events, World Trade Center 93, Oakland City, 9-11, is that they're not isolated.
[03:56:40.065 --> 03:56:40.685]  They are connected.
[03:56:40.685 --> 03:56:41.565]  They use some of the same people.
[03:56:41.565 --> 03:56:44.566]  They use the same SOPs, the same cover-up methods.
[03:56:45.026 --> 03:56:48.049]  They disregarded the videotapes, the videotapes of the Pentagon.
[03:56:48.049 --> 03:56:51.131]  We've never seen a plane crashing into the Pentagon.
[03:56:51.131 --> 03:56:53.733]  We've never seen the videotapes of what happened in front of the Murrah Building.
[03:56:53.733 --> 03:56:57.837]  They wire a building, fly a plane in, wire a building, bomb a truck.
[03:56:57.837 --> 03:57:01.039]  It's not bad enough that they blow up a truck bomb outside a building or they fly a plane into the building.
[03:57:01.039 --> 03:57:04.462]  They've got to wire the building with explosives to increase the body count.
[03:57:04.462 --> 03:57:05.803]  It's the same SOP.
[03:57:05.803 --> 03:57:12.269]  And one of the points about this movie is unless we confront the people who are doing this, bring them to justice, this is going to keep on going.
[03:57:12.569 --> 03:57:14.893]  It's gonna keep on happening and each time it's gonna get worse.
[03:57:14.893 --> 03:57:16.055]  How did you get involved in this?
[03:57:18.202 --> 03:57:19.043]  I'm from Oklahoma.
[03:57:19.043 --> 03:57:28.426]  I started researching the case, and I started doing some research on my own, putting out a hand-printed newsletter that I would hand out, and I met Chris Emery at an event where he's handing out copies of the final report.
[03:57:28.426 --> 03:57:29.407]  September of 2005.
[03:57:29.407 --> 03:57:30.567]  We started to collaborate.
[03:57:30.567 --> 03:57:38.630]  We started collaborating at other conferences, truth conferences, low-power FM's, radio shows, and this is just another step in trying to expose the truth.
[03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:41.692]  It's been an honor.
[03:57:41.692 --> 03:57:45.093]  Meeting Chris really set me on the path to finding the right thing to do here.
[03:57:45.213 --> 03:57:48.117]  And that's Holland O. Van Der Neuwenhoff.
[03:57:48.117 --> 03:57:48.878]  Did I pronounce that right?
[03:57:48.878 --> 03:57:49.799]  Van Den Neuwenhoff.
[03:57:49.799 --> 03:57:51.120]  Van Den Neuwenhoff.
[03:57:51.120 --> 03:57:52.502]  I always get names wrong here.
[03:57:52.502 --> 03:57:53.643]  It's all right.
[03:57:53.643 --> 03:57:54.745]  Well, it's always good to have you on.
[03:57:54.745 --> 03:57:55.986]  I had you on, what, two, three years ago?
[03:57:55.986 --> 03:57:59.571]  About three or four years ago on when I posted my first articles about the connection between 9-11.
[03:57:59.571 --> 03:58:00.812]  Yeah, that was a good story.
[03:58:02.034 --> 03:58:07.780]  If I may, if we have a second, I want to give a special mention to Devin Winter, our director of photography and our production coordinator.
[03:58:07.780 --> 03:58:11.284]  Devin has actually followed a lot of your work for the last seven, eight years.
[03:58:11.284 --> 03:58:14.967]  He came on board with this film and he says, I'm in because I want the truth to come out.
[03:58:14.967 --> 03:58:18.271]  And he's actually done a lot of the commercial interviews for the official story.
[03:58:18.271 --> 03:58:19.953]  And he says, that doesn't hold water.
[03:58:19.953 --> 03:58:21.254]  He says, I want to come on board with your
[03:58:21.274 --> 03:58:21.874]  That's wonderful.
[03:58:21.874 --> 03:58:30.657]  We look forward to interviewing him when the film comes out, because if they keep staging these terror attacks and blaming it on the Patriots, we're going to lose this war to defend America and save the Republic.
[03:58:30.657 --> 03:58:32.218]  Folks, most terrorism is staged.
[03:58:32.218 --> 03:58:34.279]  It's being used to enslave you and your family.
[03:58:34.279 --> 03:58:35.439]  Stand up and say no.
[03:58:35.439 --> 03:58:37.080]  Thanks for coming in, guys.
[03:58:37.080 --> 03:58:38.760]  Good job to the crew today.
[03:58:38.760 --> 03:58:40.101]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:40.101 --> 03:58:40.421]  Central.
[03:58:40.421 --> 03:58:40.781]  God bless.
