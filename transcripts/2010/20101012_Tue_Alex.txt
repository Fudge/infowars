[00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:05.114]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:06.816]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:08.658]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:10.119]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.801]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:16.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:20.690]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.046]  We are live, my friends!
[00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.467]  It is Tuesday, the 12th day of October 2010.
[00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.527]  We had him on a few weeks ago.
[00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:37.408]  He's going to pop back in for an hour.
[00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:51.471]  Alex Abeya, one of the few people to ever be given access to the RAND Corporation, one of the key globalist think tanks that is charting much of the architecture of this global government that is being formed.
[00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.332]  He is coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:59.214]  We're going to cover a raft of vital news and information today.
[00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:13.220]  The controlled implosion of the global economy is obviously accelerating and the architects of this system are calling for a global syndicate of banks, the ones that have created the very crisis we're in,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.248]  To be allowed to set interest rates globally, control currencies, and tax the world population.
[00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:22.451]  So we're going to be going over that after the break.
[00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:27.657]  Paul Joseph Watson has the key article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:31.742]  Government prepares to seize private pensions.
[00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:36.046]  And CNBC's reporting how wonderful this is.
[00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:45.916]  Many other mainstream publications are now rolling out what we told you five years ago they were planning to do when they began to change the laws and regulations ahead of this.
[00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:49.820]  And of course, that integrates back into the March article.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.747]  Five, six months ago, failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:08.368]  And then you read the article, it says they're already, and this was earlier this year, ordering major private pension systems to, quote, invest, as if the federal government can order, but they are.
[00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:16.155]  They're giving them an offer they can't refuse, because the federal regulators can basically nickel and dime them and shut them down any time they want.
[00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.278]  They're telling them, you will invest in failed banks.
[00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.801]  So they've already stolen most the money.
[00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:23.883]  They're now just getting you ready
[00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:43.357]  For the public theft, when the pension funds all start going down completely, or you're getting into serious trouble and having your benefits cut, they're preparing you for the austerity measures when the government takes over the pensions in the name of bailing them out, in the name of protecting them.
[00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:44.798]  Yes, protecting them.
[00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:49.721]  So we're going to be discussing that and going over exactly what's happening in other parts of the world.
[00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:51.342]  I don't know.
[00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:11.751]  And he links to the London Guardian and other reports going over this.
[00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:15.174]  Here's another incredible report out yesterday.
[00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:18.518]  Greek health system opts for amputation as money saver.
[00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:25.024]  They will not give any treatments to try to save arms or legs with diabetes patients.
[00:03:25.044 --> 00:03:29.148]  They're just going to chop your arms and legs off, even though the limbs are savable.
[00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:35.420]  And all the studies show that will lead to an early death of these people and more money in the health care system.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.684]  But this is the death panels now being announced here in the United States, part of austerity.
[00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:42.485]  Also, U.S.
[00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:45.468]  cities face half a trillion dollars of pension deficits.
[00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:51.552]  So they're already going bankrupt there with the police and fire and school teacher pensions.
[00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:52.934]  It's all been planned.
[00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:54.515]  We've laid it out with total precision.
[00:03:55.075 --> 00:04:07.085]  Because we've seen the globalists do this in countless third world countries, which the IMF World Bank documents that got leaked in 2002 to the BBC showed that was just test model cases in Argentina and Nigeria and places like that.
[00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:14.551]  Now they were planning to do it in Western Europe, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other quote Western wealthy nations.
[00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.734]  The mass looting is now here.
[00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:20.895]  You think you've seen trillions stolen by the banks?
[00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:37.860]  You think watching six million dead and dying veterans from World War II through Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm I, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, you think it's bold to steal their death benefits and not give the insurance money that they paid for to their widows and widowers?
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.140]  You think that's bold?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.822]  We ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:47.025]  They're getting ready to really rape this society financially.
[00:04:47.325 --> 00:04:49.046]  The financial takeover is here.
[00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:50.187]  It is brazen.
[00:04:50.267 --> 00:04:51.088]  It is naked.
[00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:53.769]  Nothing like it has ever been seen before.
[00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.870]  So get ready.
[00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.851]  We are now plunging into the abyss.
[00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:15.708]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:20.390]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:33.408]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:41.455]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:51.723]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:05:52.504 --> 00:05:55.766]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:59.549]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:05.111]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:08.494]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:13.518]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:19.763]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:22.165]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:23.005]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:23.426]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.526 --> 00:06:24.127]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:24.187 --> 00:06:25.248]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:27.711]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:48.529]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:57.992]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:59.977 --> 00:07:04.220]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.140]  Number one.
[00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.603]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:09.443]  Number two.
[00:07:09.744 --> 00:07:14.287]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:15.067]  It's true.
[00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:19.930]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:20.791]  Number three.
[00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:24.353]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:28.356]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:29.097]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.357 --> 00:07:31.719]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.503]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.804 --> 00:07:36.004]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:40.509]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:45.494]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:49.795]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:51.496]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.736 --> 00:07:53.816]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:56.577]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.817 --> 00:08:02.959]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:06.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:15.115]  It is Tuesday, the 12th day of October 2010.
[00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:21.420]  They're issuing new terror threats ahead of the election, right on time.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.922]  Not just for Europe, but for the United States.
[00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:34.590]  New York Daily News, terror threat to restaurants as Al-Qaeda, you mean Al-Cieda, calls for attacks on government workers in D.C.
[00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:45.769]  But don't worry the government run by the banks that are literally scalping our financial system and our economy.
[00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:47.192]  Don't worry.
[00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:54.881]  They are going to keep you safe with submachine guns and naked body scanners and checkpoints and citizen spies.
[00:08:55.861 --> 00:09:05.168]  Over 95% of the entire architecture of this high-tech police state grid is pointed at gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, land rights activists.
[00:09:05.568 --> 00:09:06.529]  But that's okay!
[00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:08.690]  Al-Qaeda's gonna get ya!
[00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.731]  That's why.
[00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:17.375]  A tiny bit of it is spent on surveilling Muslims and what people could call Muslim extremists.
[00:09:17.855 --> 00:09:19.896]  And there certainly are some Froot Loops out there.
[00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:25.399]  And every time they catch one of them trying to plan a shooting or something, they hype it up like it's the end of the world.
[00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:30.641]  Meanwhile, the crime wave pouring across from Mexico, that's just kept on the back burner.
[00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:36.404]  The 28,000 deaths, the massive murders and kidnappings in the United States, that's not a problem.
[00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:37.185]  That's not a threat.
[00:09:37.665 --> 00:09:39.646]  No, it's those evil gun owners you've got to watch.
[00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:44.333]  So we're going to be going over those reports today.
[00:09:44.733 --> 00:09:45.334]  The U.S.
[00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:48.719]  says they're alarmed by harsh tone of China's military.
[00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:51.043]  Well, China owns most of our debt.
[00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:52.505]  After that, the private Federal Reserve.
[00:09:53.482 --> 00:10:03.250]  And I just, I've got an article here about hundreds of thousands of acres being leased in South Texas for oil drilling and gas drilling by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.992]  So if they're such a big threat, why are they allowed to do that?
[00:10:06.653 --> 00:10:08.334]  But see, even the headlines deceptive.
[00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:08.894]  U.S.
[00:10:09.094 --> 00:10:11.336]  alarmed by harsh tone of China's military.
[00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.899]  Our country was conquered in 1913 by the private banking syndicate.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.403]  Since then they've expanded their control over the states and locales and they're looting the nation.
[00:10:21.444 --> 00:10:22.666]  And so to even say the U.S.
[00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.328]  even exists anymore is a lie.
[00:10:24.368 --> 00:10:31.355]  You've got to admit you're under globalist control so that we can point out that it's fraudulent and illegitimate.
[00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:41.066]  But if you don't know you're occupied by a corporate government, by a shadow government that's now coming out into the open, if you don't admit that, you can never set about remedying it.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.823]  Instead, we just rearrange deck chairs of, well, we'll put Obama in because Bush was bad.
[00:10:46.863 --> 00:10:49.925]  Well, we'll put Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin in.
[00:10:49.965 --> 00:10:50.805]  They'll save us!
[00:10:51.445 --> 00:10:51.766]  Really.
[00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:54.627]  Don't hold your breath.
[00:10:55.928 --> 00:11:00.411]  You'll hear a lot of rhetoric, but once they get in, they won't reverse, but maybe a few token things.
[00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:04.093]  And then expand a bunch of other police state operations.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:33.633]  It was Lord Bush, just what, five years ago, and the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress that changed the law and the regulations so that, I remember seeing this in the news, they were pitching it like it was good, so that private pension funds, corporations, can sell off their assets or create a new subsidiary and then not pay the pensions to the employees that signed contracts and agreements for those pensions.
[00:11:35.387 --> 00:11:43.631]  Boy, that was a big red flag, and now it's just all continuing under Barack Hussein Obama, real name Barry Sotaro.
[00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:56.236]  But I forgot, the Gatekeeper Republican talk show host have told us that there's no evidence that he's really Indonesian or gave up his citizenship, even though it's an admitted fact, or that he was born in Kenya, and so you're supposed to sit there and shut up and sit down.
[00:11:56.736 --> 00:11:59.878]  Of course, the same people told us five years ago there was no plan for world government.
[00:12:00.498 --> 00:12:04.622]  But I heard Beck's fill-in host admitting world government this morning.
[00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:08.747]  But it's all run by George Soros and some low-level liberals under him.
[00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:12.651]  No, George Soros is one wing of this criminal system.
[00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:16.355]  And Media Matters put out a report
[00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:30.780]  Just a few days ago, that was one of the only accurate things I've ever seen him put out, George Soros funded outfit, and they said, well, if you're against Fabian Socialist, you should be against all these Republicans who've signed on to the same plan.
[00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:37.426]  And they listed all the Fabian Socialist supporters in the Republican Party, tied in with the London School of Economics.
[00:12:38.407 --> 00:12:44.292]  But, by the way, you guys removed yesterday's stacks, which is great, but will you dig out
[00:12:44.952 --> 00:12:59.058]  Those articles trying to blame myself and Glenn Beck for that guy that got in a shootout with the police in Southern California, who now gave an interview to Media Matters, of course, because they're basically a government operation, all the evidence shows.
[00:13:00.398 --> 00:13:06.821]  And I got a call from their head editor, the head guy over there, and it was a bizarre interview.
[00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:10.863]  And then he kept saying, you didn't record this, did you?
[00:13:12.116 --> 00:13:21.301]  And he said, even if it's one-party consent states that we're both in, you really shouldn't record me.
[00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:23.982]  And I said, I just told you I didn't record you.
[00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:26.784]  And he didn't seem to believe that.
[00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:28.685]  And it was a very strange interview.
[00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.446]  He was acting all friendly, but obviously I knew better.
[00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:32.687]  You know what?
[00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:35.268]  I thought, why don't we try to get that guy on?
[00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:37.770]  In fact, give me his email and bio.
[00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:48.562]  Joe whatever his name is because I'm going to talk about it coming up in the last hour a little bit because it was so bizarre talking to this George Soros outfit.
[00:13:48.883 --> 00:14:00.234]  He was saying well we're not funded by George Soros so I was pulling up federal filings that okay George Soros gave money to moveon.org that gave money and helped found in 2005 Media Matters.
[00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:04.518]  And he was like, well, I don't want to talk about that.
[00:14:04.538 --> 00:14:10.384]  I mean, they play all these little games, but then it got even stranger.
[00:14:10.804 --> 00:14:15.708]  And I'll talk about it more in the next hour, or actually in the last hour, the third hour.
[00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:19.172]  Perhaps we should call him today to see if we can get Joe on.
[00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:24.437]  Because he kept saying, well, Glenn Beck has been calling for violence.
[00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:26.819]  And I said, well, show me where?
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.740]  Show me in your article.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.640]  He says, well, it's right here.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.001]  So I sat there on the phone with him for an hour.
[00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:33.041]  I read the whole article that they'd written.
[00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:39.564]  It was like 20 pages long with him on the phone and nowhere did Glenn Beck call for violence against the Tides Foundation.
[00:14:40.544 --> 00:14:52.888]  That this lunatic was supposedly going to go shoot up Byron Williams.
[00:14:54.786 --> 00:14:58.749]  And then he kept asking me, well, you know, this guy was a fan of you as well, he said.
[00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:01.631]  And, you know, do you feel like you're encouraging this?
[00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:04.073]  And, oh, your speech might cause problems.
[00:15:04.093 --> 00:15:08.196]  And I said, what's causing problems is this society is unraveling.
[00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:10.078]  We're becoming a third world
[00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.458]  Joke, like Mexico.
[00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:16.479]  And no one can deny that.
[00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:18.180]  So you're going to have civil unrest.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:24.922]  But I'm speaking out against civil unrest because the system is going to use that as a pretext to crack down on everyone.
[00:15:25.603 --> 00:15:26.763]  And he just didn't want to hear any of it.
[00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:27.804]  He didn't want to hear any of it.
[00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:30.425]  And he'd make jokes about world government.
[00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:32.206]  And I'd say, you know, they're forming world government.
[00:15:32.426 --> 00:15:35.787]  Would you like me to give you video quotes where they're admitting world government, world leaders?
[00:15:36.107 --> 00:15:37.768]  And it was just all very funny to the guy.
[00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:40.069]  And it shows the delusional
[00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:48.966]  type of worldview that these people basically are living in.
[00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:57.309]  So I will get into that coming up a little bit later in the transmission.
[00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.372]  Some of the other news that we're going to be
[00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.610]  going over
[00:16:22.642 --> 00:16:36.551]  This radio show, my website, InfoWars.com, I noticed they plugged InfoWars.com, but then in the transcript on GlennBeck.com, they removed the reference to InfoWars.com, so that's what they think of their listeners, you know, excising that out.
[00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:41.894]  I would imagine Beck getting medical treatment through a hissy fit when he found out that they had done that.
[00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:58.302]  It was so amazing to watch the 14-minute clip that is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in our article, Beck Sidekicks Attempt to Debunk Diet Coke Controversy, because they made it about the left-right paradigm.
[00:16:58.963 --> 00:17:09.133]  They said, yeah, these liberals don't like Donald Rumsfeld, and they claim that he basically, you know, sneaks in starting in the 80s and poisoned Glenn's Coke to kill him.
[00:17:10.474 --> 00:17:15.057]  And isn't that a stupid business plan to want to debilitate and kill your customers?
[00:17:15.358 --> 00:17:16.678]  You mean like the cigarette makers?
[00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:19.140]  Or the Agent Orange makers?
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.361]  Or DU?
[00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:23.123]  Maming and killing our own troops?
[00:17:24.383 --> 00:17:35.071]  Or our own government injecting black people in this country and men, women, and children in Guatemala and other countries with live syphilis and giving them debilitating disease that ended up killing a bunch of them?
[00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.032]  You mean stuff like that?
[00:17:38.598 --> 00:17:47.680]  And so they made it all about Rumsfeld's disease, because that's what it's been dubbed by many doctors and scientists, because they couldn't get it approved twice in the 70s.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:18:00.323]  Rumsfeld took over the pharmacological company Searle, and he publicly said, we'll make this political, and he got Ronald Reagan to basically pressure the
[00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.525]  FDA to get it approved.
[00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:12.251]  I mean, we have the studies where it gave brain tumors and blindness and other serious problems to the rhesus monkeys.
[00:18:13.412 --> 00:18:14.392]  See, I said I'd get to this later.
[00:18:14.412 --> 00:18:15.213]  I'm already getting into it.
[00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:28.804]  And the article they were making fun of that we had written, a warning to Glenn Beck, don't drink Diet Coke, was linked to Fox News, AP, Reuters, major university studies.
[00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:32.188]  And they didn't care.
[00:18:32.248 --> 00:18:42.578]  They just said we were complete lunatics and that the same chemicals that are in Diet Coke and thousands of other products, tens of thousands now, is what's in orange juice.
[00:18:42.658 --> 00:18:43.599]  And that's the big lie.
[00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:49.531]  About the phenylalanine and some of the other chemicals that they talked about being in there.
[00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:54.353]  Aspartame breaks down into a derivative of wood alcohol and formaldehyde.
[00:18:54.773 --> 00:19:10.701]  And that's why people who were drinking bad gin, bad bathtub booze, in the great decade of prohibition, headed into the Great Depression, that's why so many people went blind.
[00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:12.882]  Anybody knows that, why knows?
[00:19:14.648 --> 00:19:27.191]  End up drinking Sterno, they end up going in to drugstores and buying wood alcohol because it's like 50 cents a bottle, and they drink the stuff and they get high as a kite, but it also makes them go blind.
[00:19:27.732 --> 00:19:29.192]  And it's highly addictive.
[00:19:29.932 --> 00:19:37.614]  Now these guys didn't tell you that aspartame is the secretion, the defecation of the E. coli bacteria.
[00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:39.355]  I mean, that's a fact!
[00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:43.804]  All you gotta do is search the term Aspartame manufacturing process.
[00:19:44.285 --> 00:19:50.110]  But no, it just all became a big joke how we're liberals and if you think Aspartame's bad, you're a 9-11 truther.
[00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:55.595]  I mean, they actually used that mind control of saying that it's...
[00:19:56.676 --> 00:19:59.658]  It's just unspeakable, and we're just trying to warn people here, and we got the facts.
[00:20:00.078 --> 00:20:03.000]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.042]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.804]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:20:07.904 --> 00:20:09.865]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:11.326]  Okay, here it comes!
[00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:12.647]  But first, the facts.
[00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:17.092]  67 other products merely treat symptoms and not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:20:17.352 --> 00:20:20.837]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:20:21.037 --> 00:20:28.446]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:29.447]  Sinofresh.

[00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:50.177]  Mention GCN.

[00:20:50.977 --> 00:20:51.377]  It works!
[00:20:59.813 --> 00:21:03.478]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:09.306]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:10.829]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:10.889 --> 00:21:14.934]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:28.986]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:29.386 --> 00:21:34.691]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:40.876]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.140]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.297 --> 00:22:04.277]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:08.178]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:08.198 --> 00:22:10.719]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:16.160]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:22.841]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:28.802]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:32.923]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:22:33.403 --> 00:22:37.406]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:37.686 --> 00:22:43.210]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.592]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:47.193 --> 00:22:48.614]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:49.174 --> 00:22:49.675]  It's here.

[00:23:53.879 --> 00:23:56.782]  Your one-stop shop for worldwide vehicle transport.
[00:24:12.611 --> 00:24:17.456]  Well, here is our top story, or our top stack of news.
[00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:21.300]  It's all related to what the word austerity means.
[00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:33.233]  When we released the Obama deception, now more than a year and a half ago, the entire two-hour film is about austerity and how it was going to be introduced here and what that word entails.
[00:24:33.914 --> 00:24:39.018]  Total economic implosion and bondage by design.
[00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:42.541]  We told you they would freeze the bailout and not give it to the public.
[00:24:42.901 --> 00:24:45.423]  We told you they would call for more bailouts as stimulus.
[00:24:45.804 --> 00:24:53.010]  We told you they would then start taking the pension funds because this very same group of bankers have done this the world over
[00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:58.113]  To helpless third world nations where they put in paramilitary control systems.
[00:24:58.453 --> 00:25:02.256]  And that's in the IMF World Bank documents that the BBC got leaked in 2002.
[00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:16.865]  Such a key group of documents that we were able to get, where once the society implodes to a certain level, then riots begin and they love that because then they get to come in and crack down even more.
[00:25:17.205 --> 00:25:21.247]  Then that destroys confidence to an even lower level.
[00:25:22.368 --> 00:25:30.272]  And then that causes stocks to go down, infrastructure to go down, the country completely sinks into the financial abyss.
[00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:35.574]  The bankers then come in, flush with all the bailout money, and buy up the entire infrastructure.
[00:25:35.974 --> 00:25:37.455]  So this is the monopoly game.
[00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:42.938]  This is the financial attack and financial terrorism that we're under.
[00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:47.340]  Now here is an article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.961]  Government prepares to seize
[00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:54.991]  We haven't done this in a week.
[00:25:55.111 --> 00:26:02.275]  I want to do a Google search word today so that people get a full spectrum breakdown from Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[00:26:02.716 --> 00:26:06.458]  Government prepares to seize private pensions.
[00:26:06.858 --> 00:26:08.339]  So the search term is three words.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.501]  Seize private pensions.
[00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:20.367]  And I called Paul this morning and asked him to add to his article, so it's ongoing, the fact that this is already happening.
[00:26:21.198 --> 00:26:24.244]  And so before I go over this article, this is how the scam works.
[00:26:24.484 --> 00:26:32.298]  As I told you five years ago, as I told you four years ago, as I told you three years ago, two years ago, one year ago, a month ago.
[00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.351]  Every week we're here, specifically warning you how this is going to work.
[00:26:38.651 --> 00:26:40.752]  Because they've told us how they're going to do it.
[00:26:40.792 --> 00:26:41.092]  You understand?
[00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:42.192]  This is not my opinion.
[00:26:42.672 --> 00:26:44.092]  This is how it's going to be done.
[00:26:44.332 --> 00:26:55.335]  Just like I told you, the Trilateral Commission said in 75, 76, in two different reports, they would get the whole world in debt, dependent, they would sell derivatives about a decade before they pulled the scam, the implosion.
[00:26:56.155 --> 00:27:03.380]  They would use that fiat financial instruments to buy up all the key infrastructure to get countries and individuals in debt.
[00:27:04.461 --> 00:27:07.603]  They would entice people with cheap mortgages who couldn't pay them off.
[00:27:08.424 --> 00:27:18.451]  And then they would have a concerted global devaluation of currencies to offset the giant bubble of tens of trillions of debt per nation.
[00:27:18.711 --> 00:27:19.732]  It's 1,500 plus trillion globally.
[00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:41.110]  impossible to pay off and that they would then say okay the solution is a private global government levying VAT taxes on nations, global VAT financial transactions, taxes on oil and all carbon-based systems.
[00:27:42.574 --> 00:27:44.536]  That's now all in the news every day.
[00:27:44.576 --> 00:27:48.458]  Global government being proposed, global bank, it's the solution to the crisis.
[00:27:48.939 --> 00:28:01.889]  And the general public isn't informed on these issues, so as things get worse and worse, they're saying, okay, set up the world government, save me from the bankers, when the world government is private and run by the bankers.
[00:28:03.504 --> 00:28:17.847]  On the pensions, five years ago, they changed the federal regulations and laws so that private pensions would have no liability to pay employees who'd signed contracts to be paid those pensions, who had had money taken out of their paychecks for those private pensions.
[00:28:18.387 --> 00:28:25.208]  Also money's taken out of your check, as you know, to put into the Social Security pension, which is gone.
[00:28:25.468 --> 00:28:30.049]  They've been spending that, as the money comes in, since Social Security was set up in the 1930s.
[00:28:32.284 --> 00:28:38.928]  And so, they've taken your money, pooled it, leveraged it to the power of infinity through derivatives.
[00:28:39.408 --> 00:28:41.529]  It makes fractional reserve banking look tame.
[00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:49.353]  They've gotten global economic dominance through it, and now they're ready for the final master stroke.
[00:28:49.633 --> 00:28:51.294]  And we're entering this key phase.
[00:28:51.634 --> 00:28:59.619]  Now, on the issue of pensions, in the last year and a half, this was announced in March by Bloomberg,
[00:29:00.725 --> 00:29:03.948]  But we'd already seen it happening at the state level through federal initiatives.
[00:29:04.689 --> 00:29:08.072]  Public and private pensions are ordered, ordered.
[00:29:08.493 --> 00:29:14.179]  There's no law, but they're just ordered because the government's dictatorial and all these pension fund managers are scared.
[00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:21.126]  And part of the inside baseball crew, and they know, follow orders, you'll be taken care of, you'll get your CEO, 20, 30 million a year.
[00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:22.968]  Just do what you're told.
[00:29:24.497 --> 00:29:26.598]  It's like Bernie Madoff was protected for 11 years.
[00:29:26.978 --> 00:29:32.239]  So when we come back, I'm going to explain how all this works, and then go through the aftermath of it.
[00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:45.542]  Because Europe is a year to two years ahead of us in this, so we're going to give you a forecast of exactly what to expect in the economy, dealing with your pensions, and a lot more, coming up straight ahead.
[00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:47.202]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.003 --> 00:29:50.903]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.404 --> 00:29:52.904]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.923 --> 00:29:56.610]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:10.162 --> 00:30:17.267]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:22.131]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:31:59.656 --> 00:32:02.258]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:02.659 --> 00:32:07.623]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.003 --> 00:32:09.745]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.045 --> 00:32:14.869]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:16.010]  How much do you want?
[00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.971]  When do you want it?
[00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:18.952]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:20.053]  When will you need it?
[00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:22.375]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:22.515 --> 00:32:23.616]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:23.857 --> 00:32:24.377]  Will it make your
[00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:30.420]  If your children's sick, if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.802]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:34.222 --> 00:32:37.723]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.024 --> 00:32:39.024]  How much will you need?
[00:32:39.264 --> 00:32:39.864]  We don't know.
[00:32:40.165 --> 00:32:41.085]  How much do you want?
[00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:41.985]  All you can get.
[00:32:42.005 --> 00:32:43.006]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:43.286 --> 00:32:46.049]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:32:48.131 --> 00:32:49.032]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:03.192]  Big Brother.
[00:33:03.452 --> 00:33:04.773]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:06.274]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:06.514 --> 00:33:07.494]  You want answers?
[00:33:07.774 --> 00:33:08.855]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:15.058]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.098 --> 00:33:19.800]  What do you mean I don't believe in God?
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.921]  Talk to him every day.
[00:33:20.941 --> 00:33:25.783]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[00:33:28.457 --> 00:33:29.319]  All right, my friends.
[00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:33.784]  Let me now break down how they are going to take your pension funds.
[00:33:35.707 --> 00:33:38.270]  And they've done this over and over again in other nations.
[00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.993]  We know exactly how they do it.
[00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:48.498]  They are going to take the private pension funds by announcing that they are insolvent.
[00:33:49.259 --> 00:34:01.309]  The same thing with the state and local public pension funds for teachers, firefighters, police, bureaucrats, street sweepers, city janitors, you name it.
[00:34:02.441 --> 00:34:16.740]  So first what they do is they entice the California pension fund, CalPERS, they entice the Texas pension fund, the county pension funds, there's tens of thousands of these, to invest in derivatives, which they did.
[00:34:18.162 --> 00:34:20.345]  Then the value goes way down in those.
[00:34:21.872 --> 00:34:33.477]  The banks, when it still had the value, took the money out for themselves and used it to buy up real assets because, again, this is basically like a big casino and the insiders always win.
[00:34:36.078 --> 00:34:45.301]  And in the last year and a half, they come out and they order the public and private pension funds, the federal government does, that's Bloomberg, to invest in, quote, failed banks.
[00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:46.982]  It's not enough that
[00:34:47.745 --> 00:34:52.712]  The pension fund's invested in some bad derivatives in some cases, and it varies from pension fund to pension fund.
[00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:54.774]  That's not enough.
[00:34:54.954 --> 00:34:57.978]  They order them to invest in failed banks.
[00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:14.598]  Then the banks basically take that money, use it for bonuses, use it to buy up assets, and then blow out the failed bank after they've already moved the money out the back door and come back to you and say, gee, all these state pension funds are going under.
[00:35:14.698 --> 00:35:21.382]  Gee, it's the same thing in Spain and Portugal and Greece and Germany and everywhere.
[00:35:22.222 --> 00:35:26.524]  Gee, the pension funds are close to insolvent.
[00:35:27.185 --> 00:35:31.187]  Either they can go belly up, or you can take a 30% reduction.
[00:35:33.808 --> 00:35:35.589]  And we're going to raise the retirement age.
[00:35:36.049 --> 00:35:43.613]  And we're not going to raise your Social Security COLA, which again is the federal public pension fund for everyone.
[00:35:43.713 --> 00:35:45.354]  It's supposed to be the supplemental pension.
[00:35:46.943 --> 00:35:51.907]  And now they've told you, doesn't matter if inflation's way up, you're not going to get it raised in 2011, probably 2012.
[00:35:51.987 --> 00:35:53.808]  In fact now, they're talking about even cutting it.
[00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:00.397]  So they get you dependent on all this.
[00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:03.658]  Then they pull the plug on the financial system.
[00:36:04.218 --> 00:36:05.638]  Everything starts to implode.
[00:36:05.958 --> 00:36:15.161]  And they come in and say, OK, the government's got to take over all the pension funds, even the solvent ones, and put them into a big pool.
[00:36:15.881 --> 00:36:18.502]  And then we're going to reduce everybody's pension payment.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:33.832]  We're going to take your 401k, one form of pensions, your private pension that you administer yourself, and we're now going to have the federal government put a tax on it and reduce the payment, but at least they saved it.
[00:36:34.173 --> 00:36:35.814]  At least you're going to get something.
[00:36:35.894 --> 00:36:36.395]  Come on!
[00:36:37.476 --> 00:36:42.220]  After they moved the money out the back door, ordered the pensions to invest in failed banks.
[00:36:44.215 --> 00:37:08.236]  I mean, in plain view, they have engineered this entire thing, and the taxes go up and up and up and up, as they cut police, as they cut fire, as they sell off government buildings, as the Greeks sell off more than 600 islands, in some cases for billions of dollars apiece, and these... I've seen London Guardian and BBC articles where private
[00:37:09.613 --> 00:37:34.162]  Uh... banking heads and brokerage fund heads have so much money they've stolen from Greece that I saw a report where one guy's paying over a billion dollars for a little bitty island that was a national park that tourists paid to go to and so he's going to give Greece back some of their money for the island just so he can vacation there and build a palace on it.
[00:37:34.906 --> 00:37:36.207]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[00:37:36.948 --> 00:37:38.069]  They forget that three months ago.
[00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:41.371]  Search the term, Greece selling off islands to pay off debt.
[00:37:41.652 --> 00:37:48.678]  And then you can read in the articles where they're not just selling them off to the brokerage firms and the banks that came in and took Greece over ten years ago.
[00:37:49.983 --> 00:37:53.244]  And they launched this current operation about 11 years ago against the entire planet.
[00:37:54.044 --> 00:38:04.907]  But the specific bank heads, who've made tens of billions individually, are coming in, and like barons, actually taking control of the land themselves.
[00:38:05.267 --> 00:38:06.268]  There it is, London Guardian.
[00:38:06.668 --> 00:38:10.549]  Greece starts putting island land up for sale to save economy.
[00:38:11.328 --> 00:38:18.096]  And I believe that's the very article where they mention the individual billionaires who hold the Greek debt.
[00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:19.978]  You gotta love that!
[00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:23.662]  Physically getting them when they did it all through complete fraud.
[00:38:23.682 --> 00:38:27.106]  They're all Bernie Madoff, total Kinley-type crooks.
[00:38:28.127 --> 00:38:29.689]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:32.156 --> 00:38:45.400]  And these people like George Soros and others literally are financing the media to demonize the First Amendment and try to ban free speech so good people that know the truth about this fraud can be censored and shut up.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.342]  They can't allow us to be on the air exposing what they've done.
[00:38:50.422 --> 00:38:56.944]  Now, what you've seen happening all over the world is now coming here, as I told you five years ago.
[00:38:57.944 --> 00:39:02.686]  They're going to do it to Europe, they're going to do it to the US, they're going to do it to Canada, and how did I know?
[00:39:03.266 --> 00:39:04.866]  They said they were.
[00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:07.807]  Remember Greg Pallast, 2002 on the show?
[00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:09.168]  With those documents?
[00:39:10.088 --> 00:39:13.489]  Right at the time Joseph Stiklitz left the World Bank?
[00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:16.590]  Chief Economist?
[00:39:18.471 --> 00:39:19.751]  Now he says he didn't leak them, but...
[00:39:21.121 --> 00:39:29.325]  The point is that thousands of pages of these leaked, how they were engineering it, and how they were planning it here in America.
[00:39:29.765 --> 00:39:32.086]  And I've been screaming for eight years, Mayday!
[00:39:32.466 --> 00:39:33.026]  Mayday!
[00:39:33.507 --> 00:39:34.207]  Oh my gosh!
[00:39:34.547 --> 00:39:40.330]  A few years later, after 2002, 2005, they changed the rules to start taking your private pension funds.
[00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.971]  People calling me, oh they'll never do that!
[00:39:46.035 --> 00:39:47.296]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:39:47.356 --> 00:39:47.836]  No, it's not.
[00:39:48.276 --> 00:39:49.017]  It's a fact.
[00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:50.858]  This is what these criminals do.
[00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:56.080]  And so, then they come in and they give you socialist health care.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.363]  Not to give you health care, but to say, you're going blind, you get a cane.
[00:40:00.703 --> 00:40:03.624]  That's actually in Daschle's book, who wrote the health care bill.
[00:40:04.565 --> 00:40:06.566]  What does Bill Gates say?
[00:40:06.826 --> 00:40:08.387]  He says, class warfare.
[00:40:08.887 --> 00:40:10.268]  They get everybody in a
[00:40:11.544 --> 00:40:25.918]  Collectivist model, at the grassroots level, the elite are up there in the vertically integrated conduit getting all the power and money, but they convince people that if Granny gets health care, and that's the case for killing Granny, cover of Newsweek, then we've got to fire ten teachers.
[00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:31.723]  So when teachers start losing their jobs, it isn't the banker that did it, it's that Grandma got health care.
[00:40:32.284 --> 00:40:36.347]  No, the more health care you give Grandma, the bigger the economy is.
[00:40:37.318 --> 00:40:40.481]  The more service you demand, the better the economy is.
[00:40:40.782 --> 00:40:46.507]  But they teach you that it's a parasitic, cannibalistic economy where we have to feed on ourselves.
[00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:47.548]  That's what globalism is.
[00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:51.793]  Instead of growing the economy and the unlimited engine of free market wealth,
[00:40:54.298 --> 00:41:07.145]  The bankers come in, create a form of socialism to transfer our wealth to them, and then sell us that it's not fascism slash collectivism slash socialism combination that's destroying us.
[00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:08.966]  They tell you it's the free market.
[00:41:10.046 --> 00:41:11.546]  When this is not the free market.
[00:41:11.866 --> 00:41:16.468]  The Federal Reserve, private bank consortium, getting 28 trillion dollars of U.S.
[00:41:16.508 --> 00:41:22.769]  taxpayer money, and then keeping it for themselves, and telling Congress, we won't tell you where the money went, that isn't free market.
[00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:23.969]  That's bank robbery.
[00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:29.090]  That's giant, mega, Godzilla-size fraud.
[00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:34.192]  In your face, so brazen, so huge, the average person can't deal with it.
[00:41:35.052 --> 00:41:36.372]  So let me get into this and where it's headed.
[00:41:40.396 --> 00:41:44.838]  To put it very simply, when you're talking to your friends and family, they've already stolen most of the private pension funds.
[00:41:44.858 --> 00:41:48.659]  They're getting them to invest in derivatives and ordering them to invest in failed banks.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:42:00.204]  As they go unsolvent, public, private, state, federal, you name it, people will be told it's all going under, the feds have to save it, like the quote, banks, and like GM and Chrysler.
[00:42:01.804 --> 00:42:08.167]  Then that just gives government control over it to vertically integrate all that money and wealth into the top big six banks.
[00:42:09.926 --> 00:42:15.891]  Then they take your pension funds, whether it's your private 401k, your social security, all of it.
[00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:24.497]  You will have the benefits cut, you will have taxes added to it, and in some cases, they will take more than half, is what they're talking about, okay?
[00:42:24.697 --> 00:42:25.938]  And of course, that's just round one.
[00:42:26.198 --> 00:42:28.480]  And then you'll go along with it, because at least I got something.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.681]  At least they saved it.
[00:42:29.861 --> 00:42:33.344]  And then a few years down the road, they'll take another half of the half that's left.
[00:42:33.624 --> 00:42:35.325]  Now you got 25% of what you had.
[00:42:36.586 --> 00:42:37.507]  Then you're gonna riot.
[00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:48.514]  They're gonna gun you down on the street, and what's left of the middle class will side with the elite, and think, well, at least they're protecting me from those hordes of dangerous people burning down cities.
[00:42:48.955 --> 00:42:51.699]  It'll be the feds out there with the rocketeers actually setting the fires.
[00:42:52.924 --> 00:42:54.025]  IMF's been caught doing that.
[00:42:54.565 --> 00:42:57.408]  Okay, government prepares to seize private pensions.
[00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:13.200]  The government is preparing to seize the private 401k pensions of millions of Americans while enforcing an additional 5% payroll tax as part of a new bailout program that will empower the Social Security Administration to redistribute pension funds in a frightening example of big government gone wild.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.123]  And what does the health care bill do of all the different taxes it has?
[00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.132]  It has a private tax, 30 million people that don't want enough to buy overpriced insurance.
[00:43:22.472 --> 00:43:29.235]  It cuts the quality of the health care you get with austerity, with the death panels, to insure the bankers' profits that own the insurance companies.
[00:43:30.076 --> 00:43:38.300]  But it also has a 5% tax in there on all real estate, homes you own or homes you rent to people.
[00:43:40.402 --> 00:43:40.963]  I digress.
[00:43:41.363 --> 00:43:57.756]  The government is preparing to seize the private 401k pensions of millions of Americans while enforcing an additional 5% payroll tax as part of a new bailout program that will empower the Social Security Administration to redistribute pension funds in a frightening example of big government gone wild.
[00:43:59.537 --> 00:44:01.238]  Public pension plans have been so
[00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:10.982]  Aggressively looted already by the government, that cities and counties face a $574 billion funding gap, according to a CNBC report.
[00:44:13.305 --> 00:44:15.929]  And that's just what's currently, you know, this month is owed.
[00:44:15.969 --> 00:44:16.691]  It's in the trillions.
[00:44:18.936 --> 00:44:26.640]  That black hole is set to be filled by a new proposal that will fairly, that's the quote, distribute taxpayer-funded pensions to everyone.
[00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:37.006]  By confiscating the private wealth of millions of Americans, its proponents express staggering arrogance in thinking that they can just steal money people have worked for decades to acquire as if it's their own.
[00:44:38.117 --> 00:44:43.682]  Let's see how they're going to do that is when they start imploding the economy faster than the pension funds that are even private.
[00:44:43.702 --> 00:44:45.023]  The 401ks are going to go down.
[00:44:45.304 --> 00:45:00.578]  It's going to be their argument that they're grabbing the pension funds, dumping more taxpayer money into it with the new taxes, and so a lot of yuppies, after they create a panic and drive down their 401ks, then the government will grab it, the 401ks will go back up, and yuppies will say,
[00:45:01.078 --> 00:45:04.520]  Well, I guess it's all right that my taxes and my neighbor's taxes went up.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.360]  At least my 401k went up.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.521]  This is how these con artists rope you in.
[00:45:08.741 --> 00:45:11.082]  But then two years later, they'll take even more from you.
[00:45:11.763 --> 00:45:14.584]  But you're like an idiot at the casino who's already lost $20,000.
[00:45:14.784 --> 00:45:17.945]  You're writing IOUs to people.
[00:45:17.985 --> 00:45:19.746]  You're calling your cousins, borrowing money.
[00:45:20.006 --> 00:45:27.910]  And you just think, if I keep playing craps here, or if I keep playing roulette, it's going to stop on red soon.
[00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:28.690]  I'm going to win.
[00:45:31.889 --> 00:45:41.933]  Not only would the government confiscate 401k pensions, it would also impose a mandatory 5% payroll tax payable to everyone, according to a hearing chaired last week by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat Iowa.
[00:45:42.253 --> 00:45:58.719]  Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, Pension, Health Committee, this would of course be a sister government Ponzi scheme working in tandem with Social Security, the primary purpose being to give government politicians additional taxpayer funds to raid to pay for their out-of-control spending.
[00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:19.493]  And it goes on and on, and I've had Watson add to this how they set the scam up, getting them to invest public and private pensions in the derivative-backed systems and to get them to invest in failed banks.
[00:46:19.733 --> 00:46:22.294]  And here was that article March 8, 2010, Bloomberg.
[00:46:23.394 --> 00:46:27.615]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:32.100]  But then you read the article that says they're already ordering them.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.621]  You've got to love these articles.
[00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:51.272]  And it says the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is trying to encourage, encourage, like Don Carleone putting a gun to your head and saying, it's enough, you can't refuse, is trying to encourage public retirement funds that can troll more than two trillion to buy all or part of failed lenders.
[00:46:51.893 --> 00:46:53.654]  Oh, and that's a great investment for your pension.
[00:46:54.654 --> 00:46:55.095]  Failed?
[00:46:58.032 --> 00:47:10.180]  Failed derivatives, total made-up crud, backed up with fake mortgages and stolen homes, taking a more direct role in propping up the banking system, said people briefed on the matter.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:25.250]  And it goes on to talk about the Oregon retirement, you name it, how they were ordered, outside of law, just you better do it, to support of state pension funds to solve the crisis surrounding ongoing bank failures.
[00:47:26.184 --> 00:47:31.666]  So they're taking private pension funds and investing it in the state employees' Oregon pension fund.
[00:47:32.827 --> 00:47:36.288]  I mean, this is just the government raping us at every level.
[00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:50.994]  And see, once they tell the cops and bureaucrats, go out there and seize people's kids, write tickets, take their houses, do whatever you have to or you're going to lose your job and your pension, most of them will just lock and load their M-16s, their
[00:47:53.812 --> 00:47:56.455]  AR-15s and they are just going to march out against us.
[00:47:56.475 --> 00:47:57.096]  They already are.
[00:47:58.017 --> 00:48:04.563]  And that's the only place that's hiring is the federal government and the federalized sectors of state government and they are an army of evil.
[00:48:05.504 --> 00:48:08.067]  Individually they may not be evil, but the system is evil.
[00:48:10.089 --> 00:48:14.794]  It says the FDIC shuttered 140 lenders last year and expects to tally the number to rise in 2010.
[00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:17.445]  Okay.
[00:48:17.825 --> 00:48:20.426]  Now, let's talk about the effect of all of this.
[00:48:20.446 --> 00:48:23.467]  Remember, the Google search term is, seize private pensions.
[00:48:23.807 --> 00:48:24.747]  Search those three words.
[00:48:25.007 --> 00:48:27.388]  We'll educate a lot of people today about what's coming down the pike.
[00:48:27.428 --> 00:48:28.308]  In fact, it's already here.
[00:48:28.528 --> 00:48:30.689]  They've already started the controlled implosion.
[00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:34.170]  So it's a guarantee this is going to happen in one permutation or another.
[00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:39.772]  But if people are aware of this politically, they won't get away with it, because the system is going to sell the hoax.
[00:48:40.812 --> 00:48:42.373]  They're going to sell the hoax.
[00:48:43.581 --> 00:48:45.422]  That this is the only way to save your pension fund.
[00:48:45.883 --> 00:48:46.943]  That's how they always do it.
[00:48:48.164 --> 00:48:50.285]  Give your rights up or Al-Qaeda will get you.
[00:48:50.325 --> 00:48:53.648]  Then you learn the whole apparatus of Homeland Security for the American people.
[00:48:54.148 --> 00:48:58.511]  Or give us more tax money to control your life or the seas will rise and you will die.
[00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:03.054]  Global solutions to global problems so they can have a global government.
[00:49:06.553 --> 00:49:20.467]  Now, let me just illustrate everything I've been talking about dealing with Europe and the fact that they're a year and a half, two years ahead of us, so you can see a window into what's happening in live time in the real world and what's going to happen here and already happening to some extent.
[00:49:21.228 --> 00:49:27.715]  Senior Citizens Brace for Social Security Freeze, AP, and it says they're going to freeze it
[00:49:29.198 --> 00:49:31.040]  Just a day ago it was in 2011.
[00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:36.706]  Now they say they have to wait at least until 2012, probably longer.
[00:49:37.267 --> 00:49:39.469]  And I'm also seeing reports now they may even cut it.
[00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:46.918]  So see, first they say, oh, you might not get your Social Security increase COLA for
[00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:53.432]  Inflation, and they're already using cooked lower inflation numbers, so they're already cutting it.
[00:49:54.393 --> 00:49:57.817]  But now they're saying, oh, 2011, oh, 2012, oh, 2013, oh, we're not just gonna freeze it, we're gonna cut it!
[00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:05.932]  Oh, it's okay, you're an old lady.
[00:50:06.592 --> 00:50:10.593]  We'll just, when you get sick from eating dog food, we'll just put you in a hospital and euthanize you, honey.
[00:50:11.314 --> 00:50:14.795]  And we got ten dumb teachers that have been told when you die, they get jobs.
[00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:17.896]  So they're gonna be more than happy to call for your death, Granny.
[00:50:17.916 --> 00:50:21.497]  In fact, we'll put the headline up there, The Case for Killing Granny, Newsweek.
[00:50:21.757 --> 00:50:25.039]  When we come back, I'll play, uh, good old Billy Gates.
[00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:28.740]  Little Billy, little, little, little Bobo Gates.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.101]  Total slime bag.
[00:50:32.588 --> 00:50:44.493]  He's heavily invested in health care and we're going to get into amputations when we come back.
[00:50:44.753 --> 00:50:46.873]  Oh yes, they're saying you're not going to
[00:50:48.956 --> 00:50:52.418]  Get any healthcare, and if you've got diabetes, we're just gonna chop your arms and legs off.
[00:50:53.218 --> 00:50:57.880]  And, uh, we're gonna look at what's happening in Europe right now on that front.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.761]  This is key information straight ahead.
[00:51:00.001 --> 00:51:02.862]  Off-the-grid remedies can still be grown in your own backyard.

[00:51:59.492 --> 00:52:04.355]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:04.435 --> 00:52:05.235]  What have we got?
[00:52:05.435 --> 00:52:07.576]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:07.876 --> 00:52:08.637]  A republic.
[00:52:08.897 --> 00:52:11.478]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:11.538 --> 00:52:13.459]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:15.720]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.101]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:17.521 --> 00:52:18.642]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:18.842 --> 00:52:19.242]  Children?
[00:52:19.442 --> 00:52:20.222]  Our education?
[00:52:20.563 --> 00:52:21.223]  Our money?
[00:52:21.383 --> 00:52:25.045]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.405 --> 00:52:29.071]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:29.111 --> 00:52:30.072]  You're being warned.
[00:52:30.373 --> 00:52:31.214]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:32.516]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:32.576 --> 00:52:33.457]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:33.477 --> 00:52:34.318]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.359 --> 00:52:36.622]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:54:04.643 --> 00:54:10.370]  Okay, so here are some of the headlines of what's happening in Europe, and this is what's coming here.
[00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:14.435]  Greek health system opts for amputation as money saver.
[00:54:15.683 --> 00:54:19.884]  And this is out of the Associated Press and also the Daily Caller.
[00:54:20.484 --> 00:54:30.567]  This Saturday, one of Greece's most respected newspapers, Tuvema, reported that the nation's largest government health insurance provider would no longer pay for special footwear for diabetic patients.
[00:54:31.227 --> 00:54:36.008]  Amputation is cheaper, says the benefits division of the state insurance provider.
[00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.290]  That's what death care is.
[00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:39.110]  That's the death panels.
[00:54:39.551 --> 00:54:44.532]  The new policy was announced in a letter to the Pan-Hellenic Federation of the People with Diabetes.
[00:54:44.932 --> 00:54:49.513]  The federation disputes the science behind the decision of the Benefits Division.
[00:54:49.533 --> 00:54:51.673]  See, I thought it was doctors who decided what to do.
[00:54:51.973 --> 00:54:55.294]  No, now it's government boards, just like here.
[00:54:56.174 --> 00:54:57.635]  And the death panels are in there.
[00:54:59.835 --> 00:55:03.436]  Greece's national health care system was created in the 80s during the tenure of Prime Minister.
[00:55:04.619 --> 00:55:12.041]  Papandreou, an academic who won election under the slogan, which in Greek is the word for change.
[00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:16.883]  Now, let's look at other countries, like the United States, CNBC.
[00:55:17.423 --> 00:55:17.663]  U.S.
[00:55:17.703 --> 00:55:20.364]  cities face half a trillion dollars of pension deficits.
[00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:21.564]  That's just what's due this month.
[00:55:22.304 --> 00:55:25.645]  Don't worry, the Feds are going to take over to fix it and raise taxes.
[00:55:26.446 --> 00:55:30.707]  Continuing here, French workers threaten general strike in response to austerity.
[00:55:31.487 --> 00:55:32.727]  They're having their pensions cut.
[00:55:32.767 --> 00:55:34.108]  They're having their taxes raised.
[00:55:35.168 --> 00:55:36.408]  They're being given death panels.
[00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:39.450]  Government run by eugenicists.
[00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.451]  Sarkozy faces showdown over retirement reform.
[00:55:42.851 --> 00:55:44.371]  Oh, you're not going to retire when you're 60.
[00:55:44.592 --> 00:55:45.972]  You're going to retire when you're 70.
[00:55:46.532 --> 00:55:50.494]  So that's just some of what's going on here.
[00:55:50.554 --> 00:55:51.454]  This is globalism.
[00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:52.595]  This is the race to the bottom.
[00:55:52.875 --> 00:55:54.075]  This is the New World Order.
[00:55:54.495 --> 00:56:01.278]  And Bill Gates with Warren Buffett invest their money as philanthropists in tax-free foundations where only the profit
[00:56:02.435 --> 00:56:08.457]  It goes to UN programs, and I hear all these weak-minded fools going, oh, isn't Bill Gates so wonderful?
[00:56:08.497 --> 00:56:09.398]  He cares so much.
[00:56:09.438 --> 00:56:12.739]  He gave $50 billion, and Buffett gave $30 billion.
[00:56:12.759 --> 00:56:16.000]  They got other billionaires in the Chinese government to invest another $20 billion.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.621]  It's over $100 billion to help children.
[00:56:19.041 --> 00:56:20.722]  It's all eugenics, on record.
[00:56:22.103 --> 00:56:24.223]  All vaccine programs to sterilize people.
[00:56:24.243 --> 00:56:26.204]  We've got all the Rockefeller Foundation documents.
[00:56:26.224 --> 00:56:27.144]  We've shown them on air.
[00:56:27.625 --> 00:56:30.706]  Written countless articles at Infowars.com, our great researchers.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.423]  One wonderful fellow over in the Netherlands just continues to knock it out of the park with his research.
[00:56:35.924 --> 00:56:41.869]  All of this public, and I've got to hear how great Bill Gates is and how much he cares about us.
[00:56:41.909 --> 00:56:43.391]  His diabetes is up 3,000%.
[00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:46.253]  People drinking aspartame is one of the big causes.
[00:56:46.874 --> 00:56:47.535]  They're dying.
[00:56:48.275 --> 00:56:51.218]  And we're not going to tell you to get off the aspartame or sodium fluoride.
[00:56:51.498 --> 00:56:53.180]  We're not going to tell you to stop drinking corn syrup.
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.581]  It's deadly in all the studies.
[00:56:55.081 --> 00:56:57.363]  No, we're just going to kill your butt.
[00:56:57.404 --> 00:56:58.685]  We're not going to give you health care.
[00:56:59.045 --> 00:57:00.747]  We're going to chop your arms and legs off.
[00:57:00.987 --> 00:57:02.828]  We're going to start with your fingers and your toes.
[00:57:03.369 --> 00:57:06.051]  And we're not going to... I mean, here's Bill Gates.
[00:57:07.225 --> 00:57:10.007]  And look, if you're above 60, no eye surgery.
[00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:12.668]  And they play the young people off against the old.
[00:57:13.509 --> 00:57:14.890]  You don't want to pay for that, do you?
[00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.850]  It's a socialist system.
[00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.631]  No, I don't.
[00:57:16.911 --> 00:57:18.972]  Don't give those old people eye surgery.
[00:57:20.113 --> 00:57:21.494]  And then you have a car wreck when you're 25.
[00:57:22.454 --> 00:57:24.496]  You're not going to get the surgery, either.
[00:57:24.936 --> 00:57:30.379]  And it doesn't matter if you have insurance, because it's all federally controlled under this system, and it all gets put into a big pool.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.541]  The government decides what health care you get.
[00:57:32.761 --> 00:57:33.842]  Here's Billy Gates.
[00:57:34.762 --> 00:57:35.903]  That goes to health care.
[00:57:37.005 --> 00:57:38.045]  Is that over allocated?
[00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:46.969]  Well the US spends 17% of GDP on healthcare and you drop down to number 2 which is Switzerland at 12%.
[00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.971]  And so you say, well that, hey, what do we get for that?
[00:57:51.741 --> 00:57:54.002]  Well, we get nothing.
[00:57:55.322 --> 00:58:06.565]  The health outcomes, which are complicated to compare, but the health outcomes are basically slightly worse, both in terms of averages and the inequity.
[00:58:06.865 --> 00:58:12.987]  Our bottom quartile is very ugly compared to all other rich countries' bottom quartile.
[00:58:13.507 --> 00:58:15.568]  Our upper quartile is somewhat better.
[00:58:16.428 --> 00:58:18.589]  But that's how you get the inequity.
[00:58:18.889 --> 00:58:26.553]  So we're spending at a huge rate, which if it wasn't increasing faster than inflation, it's increasing as a percentage of the economy.
[00:58:27.574 --> 00:58:28.574]  This is a long clip.
[00:58:28.594 --> 00:58:36.098]  We're going to come back to the specific clip after break, where Gates says, you know, don't give granny care, hire 10 teachers.
[00:58:36.118 --> 00:58:36.779]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:36.799 --> 00:58:43.022]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:01.898 --> 00:59:08.660]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:10.621 --> 00:59:12.782]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.533]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:59:16.614 --> 00:59:23.005]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:59:23.706 --> 00:59:26.772]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:59:28.762 --> 00:59:30.644]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:30.905 --> 00:59:32.426]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:59:47.282 --> 00:59:47.782]  Others don't.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.480]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:57.861]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.443 --> 01:00:05.103]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.743 --> 01:00:06.804]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:08.744]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.264 --> 01:00:10.104]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.865 --> 01:00:11.805]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.405 --> 01:00:16.066]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.586 --> 01:00:20.687]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.764]  You can go up to PrisonPlanet.com and just search the term...
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.842]  Bill Gates calls for death panels, or supports death panels.
[01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:42.670]  You can get the full video clip, but the whole thing is about, well, higher education's going up, taxes are going up, we've got to basically not give granny treatment so we can keep our economy going.
[01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:45.692]  It's government taking control of healthcare that screwed it up.
[01:00:46.092 --> 01:00:50.495]  We have an incredible engine of free market and liberty, and that's the globalist problem.
[01:00:50.575 --> 01:00:57.900]  If they let the true free market take place, the average person will be so wealthy, so independent, they won't be able to be under government and
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.302]  And hence, globalist control, because the globalists control the government.
[01:01:01.762 --> 01:01:05.664]  And so this is the us-against-them system that collectivism creates.
[01:01:06.084 --> 01:01:12.968]  Let's go ahead and play Gates saying, we've had a trade-off in society, higher education's gone up because of health care costs.
[01:01:12.988 --> 01:01:14.348]  That's what he was saying earlier in the clip.
[01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.929]  Here it is.
[01:01:15.865 --> 01:01:16.025]  I think?
[01:01:38.493 --> 01:01:42.395]  Of course, that's interesting than you just said.
[01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:44.676]  And this is everything they promote.
[01:01:44.736 --> 01:01:51.318]  I mean Bill and Melinda Gates have spent billions of dollars trying to get the health care takeover in place.
[01:01:52.279 --> 01:01:55.200]  And do you hear mainline conservatives attacking Bill Gates?
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.221]  No, I hear them praising him as some great guy.
[01:01:57.701 --> 01:02:00.102]  I mean this guy spent more money than George Soros has.
[01:02:01.289 --> 01:02:23.391]  uh... trying to get the carbon taxes and trying to get the government takeover of health care the big insurance lobbies wrote the legislation put it through but you're not supposed to talk about that you're supposed to blame mid-level communist and socialist and act like that's where all of this is coming from so if you want to understand the death panels
[01:02:24.656 --> 01:02:30.040]  Look at what's happening Europe-wide, and how they're announcing, we're not going to give you any treatment.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:36.565]  If you're having problems with circulation, with diabetes, we're going to chop your arms and legs off, because that's cheaper than giving you any services.
[01:02:37.826 --> 01:02:39.968]  And then of course that causes other debilitating problems.
[01:02:40.028 --> 01:02:44.371]  Now you can't exercise, you can never reverse the trend, and you end up dying.
[01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:50.036]  This is a soft kill form of euthanasia.
[01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:52.549]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:56.751]  All the money has to go to the bankers, because they created the derivative scam.
[01:02:57.132 --> 01:03:01.595]  Everything has to go to the fraudsters, and you have to get your arms and legs chopped off.
[01:03:01.855 --> 01:03:07.899]  And Newsweek tells us, with an image of a plug pulled out of a wall, that we need to kill Granny.
[01:03:08.539 --> 01:03:20.767]  And that this is all a beautiful, wonderful thing, and if you ever want your economy back, support NAFTA, support GATS, support banker bailouts, support having your pensions taken, because it's all because of healthcare costs for Grandma.
[01:03:22.176 --> 01:03:25.898]  From the best healthcare in the world 50 years ago to some of the worst healthcare in the world.
[01:03:26.278 --> 01:03:30.841]  From the highest test scores in the world to what, number 43 on the planet right now?
[01:03:32.982 --> 01:03:33.923]  This is globalism.
[01:03:33.983 --> 01:03:35.264]  This is neo-feudalism.
[01:03:35.504 --> 01:03:36.504]  They want you dependent.
[01:03:36.784 --> 01:03:38.025]  They want you under their control.
[01:03:38.385 --> 01:03:39.826]  They must wreck society.
[01:03:39.866 --> 01:03:47.971]  They must wreck and suppress technological development because they can't have you being independent.
[01:03:49.758 --> 01:04:03.949]  They have to have you under their control, and they think there's too many of us, and they are selling us on how this is the solution, how taking your private pension funds is the solution to what the bankers did, giving them all your money, to killing grandma.
[01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:08.152]  And you notice, you know, do we spend a million dollars in the last three months?
[01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:14.457]  He uses the worst case point example, and out of this, they now have the death panels,
[01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:36.469]  They now have them in Europe and they're now saying we're not going to give you eye surgeries, we're not going to give you cancer surgeries, same thing in England, we're not going to give you basic care so that almost all of your tax money, again you pay more and more taxes into it, goes to the banks and the insurance companies and almost none of it to actual care.
[01:04:37.884 --> 01:04:39.445]  So we have a nightmare future.
[01:04:39.765 --> 01:04:40.745]  You think things are bad now?
[01:04:40.905 --> 01:04:41.886]  We haven't seen anything yet.
[01:04:41.906 --> 01:04:50.850]  We're going to talk to an amazing guest, part two of going inside one of the top globalist think tanks to understand the architecture of the New World Order with Alex Abeya.
[01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.610]  Straight ahead after this break.
[01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.472]  We'll also open the phones up later in the hour for Alex Abeya.
[01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:55.892]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:03.794]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.094 --> 01:05:04.714]  Number one.
[01:05:05.014 --> 01:05:08.176]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.017]  Number two.
[01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:13.860]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:14.641]  It's true.
[01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:19.484]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:20.364]  Number three.
[01:05:20.624 --> 01:05:23.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.207 --> 01:05:27.909]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.670]  Number 4.
[01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:31.272]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.673 --> 01:05:35.056]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.357 --> 01:05:35.577]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.157 --> 01:05:40.062]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.302 --> 01:05:45.067]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:52.784 --> 01:06:53.224]  Thank you!
[01:07:00.228 --> 01:07:03.872]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:03.892 --> 01:07:07.255]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:07.495 --> 01:07:12.279]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:12.299 --> 01:07:18.525]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:18.685 --> 01:07:20.928]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:21.468 --> 01:07:21.748]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:21.768 --> 01:07:22.188]  Bernanke?
[01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:23.029]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:24.210]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.471]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:40.359 --> 01:07:47.285]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:10.051]  You want answers?
[01:08:10.812 --> 01:08:11.692]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.373 --> 01:08:15.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.557 --> 01:08:20.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.664 --> 01:08:29.188]  Okay, I've got two quick program notes, and then we're going to Alex Abea.
[01:08:30.486 --> 01:08:39.029]  Part two of our in-depth interview live, dealing with probably the most powerful and important globalist think tank, setting up world government.
[01:08:39.489 --> 01:08:46.292]  The only person to ever be given massive access to their archives, and he was not expecting what he found.
[01:08:47.132 --> 01:08:49.653]  New York Times best-selling author, researcher.
[01:08:49.673 --> 01:08:53.714]  He's also, of course, an award-winning journalist.
[01:08:54.615 --> 01:08:56.515]  Alex Abeya here in just a moment.
[01:08:56.535 --> 01:08:57.876]  We're going to be talking to him.
[01:08:59.517 --> 01:09:03.679]  But before I go any further, I'm going to be out in California late next week.
[01:09:04.799 --> 01:09:15.564]  Watson's going to be sitting in just on the Friday show and the Monday show because I am going to be out in California, part of an investigation.
[01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:20.647]  And while I'm there, I am going to be speaking
[01:09:23.052 --> 01:09:30.098]  at two KSCO, and the website's ksco.com events, 1080 AM.
[01:09:31.139 --> 01:09:37.885]  The great folks out there, the owner of the two stations that carry us there, and it goes into San Francisco, hundreds of thousands of listeners conservatively every day.
[01:09:38.485 --> 01:09:46.332]  MZ, the owner, has been begging me, really in a nice way, for a year and a half to come out there and speak.
[01:09:47.595 --> 01:10:16.192]  and i said okay i'll come speak and they only have eight hundred seats at the uh... coconut grove theater on the sunday i plugged it three times and it sold out uh... and so i haven't really plugged this yet is probably gonna sell out so if you want the tickets go to ksco dot com i'm gonna be doing my show actually live monday from their studios so i guess Watson won't be filling in on monday i may have him there in the wings as backup uh... but uh... i'm gonna be speaking on sunday and monday if you want to go to the monday event
[01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:24.798]  They've already sold 200 of the 800 tickets, so you need to go to ksco.com if you want to see the two-hour speech and question and answer.
[01:10:25.239 --> 01:10:26.459]  I'm going to do it.
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:31.724]  It's $10.80 for the radio station, of course, after its frequency, 10 a.m.
[01:10:32.404 --> 01:10:37.448]  So ksco.com if you want to get those tickets.
[01:10:39.249 --> 01:10:45.074]  Lastly, we are going to broadcast more than 24 hours live, only 48 hours from now.
[01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:52.310]  Coming up on Thursday morning at 11 a.m.
[01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:54.392]  Central when we kick off the live transmission.
[01:10:55.521 --> 01:11:01.682]  It was a listener who started the first InfoWars.com money bomb three years ago.
[01:11:02.082 --> 01:11:03.542]  It was done in the early summer.
[01:11:03.882 --> 01:11:05.403]  We did it again last year in the early summer.
[01:11:05.423 --> 01:11:06.663]  I wasn't going to do one this year.
[01:11:07.443 --> 01:11:18.325]  We have tripled our audience according to Google Analytics, the stations that get Arbitron, same numbers there, Alexa, and all the statistics out there.
[01:11:18.365 --> 01:11:23.406]  We've tripled the audience, but because we're in a depression, funding has not just stayed the same, it's gone down.
[01:11:24.955 --> 01:11:27.478]  And our bandwidth bill is over $20,000 a month.
[01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:30.301]  I have right at 20 employees and contractors.
[01:11:30.722 --> 01:11:32.664]  We have a 14,000 square foot facility.
[01:11:32.704 --> 01:11:34.426]  We just built the shell of the new studio.
[01:11:34.446 --> 01:11:36.949]  I need to hire the personnel for it.
[01:11:36.969 --> 01:11:38.951]  I need to get the cameras, the switchers, the equipment.
[01:11:39.231 --> 01:11:41.554]  I just paid for the 14,000 for the lighting system.
[01:11:41.614 --> 01:11:42.775]  It sounds like a lot that's cheap.
[01:11:43.556 --> 01:11:45.177]  So we're doing it, you know, prosumer level.
[01:11:45.197 --> 01:11:50.121]  I'm going to launch the daily news television show and then a once a week show that I'm going to try to get on television.
[01:11:50.361 --> 01:11:54.824]  We can buy the time on Dish or something like that, but some may want to actually just pick it up.
[01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:55.924]  We've already had offers in Europe.
[01:11:56.365 --> 01:11:58.046]  So, but we're doing this ourselves.
[01:11:58.066 --> 01:11:59.327]  We're not backed by News Corp.
[01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:12.776]  There was more news today about billions of dollars spent with NBC, Fox, in secret government funding for what's in the shows, not just the ads, what they call behavior placement, what I coined 10 years ago as propaganda placement.
[01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:17.199]  They've just now admitted that what last year they call it behavior placement.
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.220]  That was their secret term.
[01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.583]  My term was propaganda placement.
[01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:21.263]  I think even better.
[01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.765]  We don't have that funding.
[01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:23.986]  We have you supporting us.
[01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:28.149]  And if you believe in what we're doing and you understand we're going into a global depression.
[01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.150]  The world government is here.
[01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:30.371]  We're in a major crisis.
[01:12:31.272 --> 01:12:39.920]  And you want to see the tip of the spear supercharged and sharpened, it is up to you to donate on the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com site.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.963]  Kicking off, we've already raised over $50,000, but I want to raise $500,000.
[01:12:44.724 --> 01:12:48.227]  And so we'll need to raise $400,000 plus in that 24-hour live period.
[01:12:48.547 --> 01:12:53.572]  We're going to have live interviews with amazing guests, phone calls, also a bunch of never-before-seen video interviews.
[01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:55.734]  I've done over 40 interviews on video.
[01:12:56.314 --> 01:12:57.375]  With Lord Monckton.
[01:12:57.435 --> 01:12:58.596]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:12:58.956 --> 01:13:00.717]  This is the best interview I've ever seen with him, by the way.
[01:13:00.737 --> 01:13:02.718]  We're going to just premiere here for the viewers.
[01:13:03.158 --> 01:13:08.302]  And we've been testing it in the last few days.
[01:13:08.482 --> 01:13:13.965]  We put up a free version of PrisonPlanet.tv stream yesterday in the last hour.
[01:13:14.946 --> 01:13:18.368]  And thousands of people logged in to the free live stream.
[01:13:18.388 --> 01:13:20.450]  You know, we have free audio streams on the website.
[01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:21.170]  That's
[01:13:39.642 --> 01:13:46.844]  Just to test it out for the 24-hour transmission, where we're going to try to have it free, unless the servers crash, for everybody.
[01:13:46.884 --> 01:13:57.347]  But we estimate it's going to probably cost $5,000 just to stream free to the hundreds of thousands of people that will watch the video stream coming up Thursday.
[01:13:57.807 --> 01:13:59.668]  In fact, we've done calculations that could cost as much as $20,000.
[01:14:01.408 --> 01:14:04.349]  I mean, that's an example of how the meter is running here.
[01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:06.810]  I mean, Glenn Beck
[01:14:08.484 --> 01:14:11.807]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are bigger than all his sites combined.
[01:14:12.427 --> 01:14:13.588]  Bigger than Rush Limbaugh's site.
[01:14:13.628 --> 01:14:14.549]  Bigger than Sean Hannity.
[01:14:14.969 --> 01:14:15.970]  Bigger than Media Matters.
[01:14:16.511 --> 01:14:20.914]  Infowars.com is now bigger than MSNBC.com in all the rating services.
[01:14:21.695 --> 01:14:23.817]  But their website makes tens of millions of dollars a year.
[01:14:24.197 --> 01:14:28.561]  My website's, you know, doing everything we can, a few million, and that goes into funding things.
[01:14:28.861 --> 01:14:30.702]  This is very expensive, folks.
[01:14:30.943 --> 01:14:36.767]  We're talking about tens of thousands of dollars just to give you a free video feed for 24 hours.
[01:14:39.113 --> 01:14:39.394]  Okay?
[01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:41.577]  That's what we're talking about here.
[01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.681]  And, you know, we've tried Justin.TV and other things to give it away free.
[01:14:44.942 --> 01:14:46.184]  They still can't handle it.
[01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:50.991]  We've sent them feeds before, and when 20,000 people log on, it crashes!
[01:14:52.012 --> 01:14:52.413]  You understand?
[01:14:52.433 --> 01:14:54.596]  There's nothing as big as this show on the Internet.
[01:14:55.276 --> 01:15:03.820]  So, that's our, and I'm sorry to Alex Obey, I just, my cruise keeps pointing out I'm not plugging the money bomb coming up, but he's waiting in the wings.
[01:15:04.261 --> 01:15:15.166]  The issue is, I shouldn't have to spend all my time in this war trying to grub up the money to put in the gas tank of this Abrams tank running over the enemy forces in the Info War.
[01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:16.427]  I need your support.
[01:15:16.487 --> 01:15:23.230]  Buy the books, buy the videos, buy the t-shirts, get the materials, get them out to people, donate at the money bomb, support our sponsors.
[01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:24.691]  That's how we're doing this.
[01:15:25.905 --> 01:15:32.609]  I guess I could be smart like Glenn Beck and, you know, sell out 1,000, 2,000-person theaters and charge $100, and then I guess I would have the money.
[01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:39.253]  But I just have this instinct to just try to pay for the venue, you know, $10.80.
[01:15:40.414 --> 01:15:41.135]  Here's my last point.
[01:15:41.455 --> 01:15:42.655]  Of the top five or six,
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.801]  Most viral films in history, we got three or four of them.
[01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:50.222]  I mean, it's conservative to say the Obama deception's been seen by over 30 million people for free online.
[01:15:50.482 --> 01:15:52.302]  It has caused a major political sea change.
[01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:55.083]  Just that one film, thanks to you getting it out to everybody.
[01:15:55.403 --> 01:15:59.224]  I make a film, cost $125,000, and I give it away!
[01:15:59.524 --> 01:16:01.465]  People say, well then, we don't want to donate.
[01:16:01.505 --> 01:16:02.485]  You should charge for that.
[01:16:03.045 --> 01:16:04.586]  The point is, most people won't pay.
[01:16:04.706 --> 01:16:07.426]  It's you that cares to support what we're doing.
[01:16:07.767 --> 01:16:11.388]  Where can you find an organization or an operation having a bigger effect?
[01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:12.508]  I challenge you!
[01:16:13.288 --> 01:16:21.531]  Who was under more attack from the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, George Soros, Media Matters, MSNBC, Nightline hit pieces, CNN hit pieces?
[01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.393]  We've gotten the documents with the FBI surveilling us.
[01:16:27.293 --> 01:16:29.094]  They've had Army Intelligence surveilling us.
[01:16:29.134 --> 01:16:30.034]  That came out in the news.
[01:16:30.935 --> 01:16:32.835]  Folks, the system is scared of us.
[01:16:32.875 --> 01:16:36.337]  They can't kill me, cross my fingers, because it'll only
[01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:39.304]  Make all my information that much more powerful.
[01:16:40.045 --> 01:16:41.747]  But, they are trying to destroy us.
[01:16:41.807 --> 01:16:43.489]  So, we need the war chest.
[01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:44.711]  500,000 is nothing!
[01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.416]  What we could do with 5 million is unbelievable.
[01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:52.362]  It's nothing in this deflated dollar, in this economy.
[01:16:53.854 --> 01:16:57.657]  Okay, I'm going to shut up and I apologize to Alex Abay for doing that five minute rant while he's holding.
[01:16:57.677 --> 01:16:59.178]  He'll be with us 30 minutes into the next hour.
[01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:02.101]  We're going to be taking your phone calls for him coming up later.
[01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:11.108]  But I just cannot tell you, and that's another issue, all these authors, researchers, scientists, professors, activists, Ron Paul, the platform we've built.
[01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:12.370]  Remember Ron Paul?
[01:17:13.373 --> 01:17:14.054]  Remember Ron Paul?
[01:17:14.975 --> 01:17:20.520]  During the primary, he came on the show without me prompting him, and he said, half the support we're getting, Alex, is from your show.
[01:17:20.701 --> 01:17:21.601]  I want to thank your listeners.
[01:17:22.402 --> 01:17:24.344]  Half the support he got from this show, okay?
[01:17:24.685 --> 01:17:27.187]  That's why this platform is so important.
[01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:28.589]  And we need your support.
[01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:34.254]  But even if you can't donate, I want people that have money out there to donate, if you want to protect the free market in our society.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.343]  People that aren't doing well, do not give a red cent.
[01:17:37.684 --> 01:17:40.368]  Spread the word about the 24-hour broadcast and the money bomb.
[01:17:40.628 --> 01:17:42.651]  Help us get the word out about the free iPhone app.
[01:17:42.971 --> 01:17:44.934]  Help us get the word out about everything we're doing.
[01:17:45.014 --> 01:17:45.755]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:17:46.296 --> 01:17:50.282]  Alex Abeya, it is amazing to have you here with us.
[01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:51.123]  I just had your...
[01:17:58.514 --> 01:18:11.228]  Why don't you, before we go to break, introduce yourself, your research, your Emmy nominated news reporting, everything you've done, and your book about Hitler, all of it.
[01:18:11.428 --> 01:18:13.190]  Then we're going to go to break and come back with you.
[01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:14.070]  Sure, no problem.
[01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:16.792]  First of all, I gotta tell you that, you know, I really appreciate your program.
[01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:21.975]  And, you know, hearing you speak, you know, reminds me of that old biblical injunction, you know, and the truth will set you free.
[01:18:22.495 --> 01:18:23.596]  Because that's what you're doing here.
[01:18:24.156 --> 01:18:27.738]  As for me, I'm just trying my best, you know, to tell people, you know, what the story's all about.
[01:18:27.758 --> 01:18:30.499]  What, how our society has changed.
[01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:36.743]  You know, we've gone from being citizens with rights and responsibilities to being consumers with budgets and choices.
[01:18:36.803 --> 01:18:38.744]  It's, you know, to me there's something wrong with that.
[01:18:39.324 --> 01:18:39.984]  Because it may.
[01:18:40.044 --> 01:18:46.906]  So I wrote this book called Soldiers of Reason, the RAND Corporation, and the Rights of the American Empire.
[01:18:47.646 --> 01:19:00.869]  And I was granted, as far as I know, I was the only journalist ever granted access, untrammeled access, to the files of the RAND Corporation to study them and to see what their effect was on American society and the world at large.
[01:19:01.329 --> 01:19:03.130]  In the book I have a line that says,
[01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:07.252]  You know, we are really the bastard children of Brown, and we don't even know it.
[01:19:08.073 --> 01:19:13.316]  Because they have affected us in so many ways, starting in 1948 when they became incorporated.
[01:19:13.336 --> 01:19:16.818]  That is just truly amazing, and they continue doing so.
[01:19:17.759 --> 01:19:19.320]  How did I come about this?
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:29.006]  Well, because before that I had written a book called Shadow Enemies, about a secret terrorist plot that had been concocted by Adolf Hitler.
[01:19:29.786 --> 01:19:30.307]  Alex, stay there.
[01:19:30.327 --> 01:19:39.493]  You're going to have the floor for the rest of the hour when we come back to lay out the full blueprint of RAND, why this is so important, then we're going to take calls.
[01:19:59.676 --> 01:20:02.698]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:03.039 --> 01:20:06.661]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:20:06.962 --> 01:20:10.404]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:20:10.684 --> 01:20:12.225]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon.

[01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:03.974]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:22:04.094 --> 01:22:04.854]  What have we got?
[01:22:05.074 --> 01:22:07.236]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:22:07.536 --> 01:22:08.277]  A republic.
[01:22:08.537 --> 01:22:11.119]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:22:11.179 --> 01:22:13.100]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:15.362]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:22:15.482 --> 01:22:16.763]  So they think they own our land?

[01:22:18.484 --> 01:22:18.885]  Children?
[01:22:19.085 --> 01:22:19.865]  Our education?
[01:22:20.206 --> 01:22:20.846]  Our money?
[01:22:21.026 --> 01:22:24.689]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:22:25.049 --> 01:22:29.695]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:22:30.015 --> 01:22:30.836]  We have the facts.
[01:22:31.036 --> 01:22:32.157]  We have the Constitution.

[01:22:33.119 --> 01:22:33.960]  We have common law.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.242]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:23:04.302 --> 01:23:04.643]  Listen.
[01:23:05.003 --> 01:23:09.005]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:23:09.266 --> 01:23:12.288]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:23:12.668 --> 01:23:15.510]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:19.072]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[01:23:19.474 --> 01:23:27.726]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.

[01:24:21.713 --> 01:24:29.480]  Okay, Alex Abey, we're getting into how you inadvertently got into Rand Corporation, how they let you in, and what you discovered.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.242]  This is a short segment, long 18-minute segment coming up.
[01:24:32.703 --> 01:24:33.824]  Then we're going to take phone calls.
[01:24:33.904 --> 01:24:38.287]  You've got the floor, because when you talk about, they've charted our history in the last 50 years.
[01:24:38.308 --> 01:24:39.929]  Right, that's right, that's right.
[01:24:39.949 --> 01:24:42.371]  Yeah, we are really, you know, living their world.
[01:24:42.531 --> 01:24:43.052]  Absolutely.
[01:24:43.152 --> 01:24:44.393]  You've got the floor, break it down.
[01:24:47.585 --> 01:24:48.506]  Go ahead, you've got the floor.
[01:24:48.806 --> 01:24:49.226]  Break it down.
[01:24:49.587 --> 01:24:50.127]  Sure, no problem.
[01:24:50.147 --> 01:24:55.112]  Well, as I was saying before, I mean, I've done this book on Nazi terrorists coming here to the U.S.
[01:24:56.012 --> 01:25:01.117]  And while I was signing away one of those books, I met somebody who was at the Rand Corporation.
[01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:10.665]  And I suggested that, you know, the idea came to me that maybe, you know, I should do something about this because I first heard of them back in the 1960s when I was in college.
[01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:13.308]  And I thought, well, you know, what's going on with these people, etc.
[01:25:14.348 --> 01:25:14.949]  I don't know.
[01:25:27.398 --> 01:25:35.704]  Nuclear strategy for the United States starting in the night in late 1940s They were influential in getting JFK elected.
[01:25:35.984 --> 01:25:56.397]  They were the ones who came up with the whole concept of the missile gap meaning that you know, there was a Missile gap between the US and the Soviet Union with the Soviet Union to have more missiles than the United States They were involved from in the rise of the military-industrial complex right from the very beginning They were also instrumental in stopping Daytona in the 1970s
[01:25:57.739 --> 01:26:06.008]  Uh, and, but even more important than all that is, they came up with this whole theory called rational choice theory, which is what I was, you know, talking about before.
[01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:11.955]  That they, they transformed our concept of country.
[01:26:12.515 --> 01:26:16.178]  And our duty to one of being consumers.
[01:26:16.759 --> 01:26:18.400]  So, you know, we're no longer patriots.
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.382]  We're just people who go out and buy and spend.
[01:26:20.402 --> 01:26:25.706]  I mean, it's like, you know, doing the, right after 9-11, when Bush said, you know, you don't have to worry about anything.
[01:26:25.726 --> 01:26:27.028]  Just go out there and do your duty.
[01:26:27.068 --> 01:26:28.749]  And once you do your duty, go out there and spend.
[01:26:28.969 --> 01:26:30.070]  Go out there to the mall.
[01:26:30.090 --> 01:26:34.414]  And I'm thinking, even then, I was thinking, you know, this makes no sense.
[01:26:34.594 --> 01:26:35.515]  How could it be?
[01:26:35.575 --> 01:26:38.637]  How could we as citizens be expected only to be consumers?
[01:26:39.578 --> 01:26:44.060]  And it's a debt system designed to create a debt black hole that can't be paid back.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.140]  That's the financial servitude.
[01:26:46.181 --> 01:26:46.521]  Go ahead.
[01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:47.421]  Yes, exactly.
[01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:54.644]  And not only that, it's to then have the country and the whole world, you know, ruled by an unelected technocracy.
[01:26:55.104 --> 01:26:58.605]  I mean, you know, if you do it, there's so much to talk about.
[01:26:58.665 --> 01:26:59.765]  It's all in the book.
[01:26:59.785 --> 01:27:03.667]  But if you really start looking at this, is that you see that from the very beginning,
[01:27:04.668 --> 01:27:24.855]  That the people at Rand and their main affiliate, which is the Ford Foundation, they have seen themselves as people who are above the fray, who are intellectuals, who have the rule of reason, and nobody else does, and that they can write things, and they can do things the way they should be, and they're not accountable to anyone.
[01:27:25.295 --> 01:27:32.598]  Of course, not realizing, or perhaps realizing it, but, you know, not telling anyone, but they're really accountable to a small group of financiers who are actually backing them all the time.
[01:27:33.392 --> 01:27:37.271]  But that was the original intent of the rant, and it just continues to this very day.
[01:27:40.287 --> 01:27:45.829]  We're about to go to break, but go over mid-air fueling, continuity of government.
[01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:54.533]  I mean, last year they put out a report about how they were going to federalize all local police and have private paramilitary groups ruling every community.
[01:27:54.853 --> 01:28:05.457]  I mean, everything we see, I remember in 99 seeing Rand Corporation and the Austin American Statesman saying, there's going to be big terror attacks, we're going to take your rights, we're going to set up a thing called Homeland Security.
[01:28:05.817 --> 01:28:08.378]  I mean, they really are writing the book on almost everything.
[01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:09.658]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:28:09.698 --> 01:28:12.099]  Because, you know, they always have all these contingency plans.
[01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:14.080]  And in a way, in fact, they're always tipping their hat.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.142]  And it's like the latest thing that they're into right now is Proposition 19, which I don't know if you're aware of it here in California.
[01:28:20.722 --> 01:28:29.805]  You know, it's just, you know, they seem to be almost advocating legalizing pot to again turn consumers, I mean, turn people into mindless consumers.
[01:28:30.186 --> 01:28:31.546]  It's really, it's really amazing.
[01:28:31.966 --> 01:28:36.488]  Now, as regards to the in-flight fueling, well, what happened is that
[01:28:37.248 --> 01:28:50.457]  They needed a way to be able to refuel the planes that would be carrying atomic bombs to the Soviet Union in case there was a war between the United States and the Soviets back in the 50s and 60s.
[01:28:51.538 --> 01:29:05.487]  Because people at RAND had come up with a plan called the BASIC study that basically highlighted certain deficiencies in the national security apparatus of the time.
[01:29:06.988 --> 01:29:07.568]  We're good to go.
[01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:40.144]  Yeah, let's talk about the masters of the RAND Corporation and just the entire spectrum.
[01:29:40.544 --> 01:29:47.125]  And of course their headquarters there in California has a giant mushroom cloud sculpture made out of chain link.
[01:29:47.505 --> 01:29:48.566]  We'll talk about that as well.
[01:29:49.986 --> 01:29:50.886]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.387 --> 01:29:52.967]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.907 --> 01:29:56.588]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.219 --> 01:30:02.822]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:03.222 --> 01:30:08.187]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:08.547 --> 01:30:10.289]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:10.609 --> 01:30:15.414]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:15.594 --> 01:30:16.575]  How much do you want?
[01:30:16.796 --> 01:30:17.536]  When do you want it?
[01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:19.518]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:19.798 --> 01:30:20.619]  When will you need it?
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.942]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.082 --> 01:30:24.123]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:24.403 --> 01:30:25.724]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:25.925 --> 01:30:30.990]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:34.373]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:34.774 --> 01:30:38.277]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:38.598 --> 01:30:39.579]  How much will you need?
[01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:40.440]  We don't know.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:41.641]  How much do you want?
[01:30:41.841 --> 01:30:42.542]  All you can get.
[01:30:42.742 --> 01:30:43.602]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:43.842 --> 01:30:46.604]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:46.904 --> 01:30:49.065]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.085 --> 01:30:50.105]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:02.532]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:31:03.414 --> 01:31:04.315]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:04.676 --> 01:31:08.261]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:08.321 --> 01:31:10.825]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:10.845 --> 01:31:15.892]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:16.693 --> 01:31:22.978]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:23.378 --> 01:31:28.942]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:29.362 --> 01:31:33.005]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:33.525 --> 01:31:37.507]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:37.808 --> 01:31:43.311]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:43.751 --> 01:31:46.713]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:47.313 --> 01:31:48.714]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:49.294 --> 01:31:49.794]  It's here.

[01:32:03.331 --> 01:32:09.356]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:09.736 --> 01:32:16.842]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:17.122 --> 01:32:21.666]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:32:34.895 --> 01:32:41.098]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:41.678 --> 01:32:45.100]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:32:53.004 --> 01:32:53.444]  Thank you.

[01:33:14.838 --> 01:33:19.540]  Well, I've got a lot of questions for Alex Avea, award-winning journalist, best-selling author.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:24.503]  We'll tell you how to get his book several times before he leaves us and gives you his website.
[01:33:25.103 --> 01:33:37.970]  But, Alex, you were getting into the hundreds of inventions, the hundreds of developments, how our society operates, the insurance deductible, how they talked about how to psychologically manipulate people.
[01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:41.831]  I mean, it's thousands of things that the Rand Corporation...
[01:33:42.932 --> 01:33:43.712]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:05.620]  We're good to go.
[01:34:29.729 --> 01:34:31.790]  And therefore, we would take care of our own people.
[01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:38.073]  This was something that was negotiated as well by the labor unions in the late 40s and early 50s.
[01:34:38.553 --> 01:34:44.335]  But by the late 60s, early 70s, the government felt we were spending too much money on the health of the people.
[01:34:44.675 --> 01:34:47.456]  So therefore, they started saying, well, how can we get this money back?
[01:34:47.897 --> 01:34:53.339]  So due to this particular medical study, they came up with the concept of deductibles.
[01:34:54.099 --> 01:34:59.243]  You know, at the beginning it was only, you know, a few cents, then a few dollars, and now you all know how much that is.
[01:34:59.423 --> 01:35:02.805]  You know, it's a big chunk and it's growing every day.
[01:35:02.825 --> 01:35:08.349]  So that's only one of their many contributions to civilization.
[01:35:08.949 --> 01:35:11.751]  We also have the concept, you know, of charging for everything.
[01:35:11.771 --> 01:35:13.212]  That everything has a price.
[01:35:13.692 --> 01:35:21.217]  Because it all stems, again, from their concept of people not so much as citizens, but as consumers.
[01:35:21.698 --> 01:35:23.599]  Which, again, is the concept that came about
[01:35:23.899 --> 01:35:24.480]  I think so.
[01:35:33.815 --> 01:35:43.220]  Let me see if I recall correctly, which would be, from each according to his ability to each according to his needs.
[01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:54.706]  And the way that they thought that was by making people then consumers, which is, you know, whatever it is that you want, that's what you should get, because after all, there's no such thing as a rational collective decision.
[01:35:55.187 --> 01:35:58.428]  That all collective decisions are irrational and tyrannical.
[01:35:59.729 --> 01:36:02.951]  So they came up with this whole concoction, and, you know, we're living in the world right now.
[01:36:04.568 --> 01:36:23.780]  But then you notice that actually the ultra-rich corporations are actually, the Ford Foundation itself promotes a form of collectivism to trick us, and then it transfers the wealth to the elite, but then they sell it as if it's an anti-socialist or communist movement.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:30.804]  But the Rand Corporation has been the biggest promoter of the largest sector of corporate welfare, the military-industrial complex.
[01:36:31.204 --> 01:36:32.305]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:36:32.325 --> 01:36:38.348]  I mean, they were right there, present at the creation, like that, like Dolan said, you know?
[01:36:38.808 --> 01:36:42.791]  They were right there, right from the beginning, like the people in RAND, with the whole study.
[01:36:43.111 --> 01:36:51.836]  There was something called the Gator Report that came out in the late 1950s, in which it advocated increasing military spending in the United States.
[01:36:52.616 --> 01:37:00.581]  And that was made up, you know, of RAND advisors and people from the military, who obviously stood to profit if all of a sudden the Pentagon budget would go up.
[01:37:01.241 --> 01:37:05.665]  President Eisenhower refused to do that because he was a general who had seen what war was all about.
[01:37:05.745 --> 01:37:08.347]  Most of these people had never been through that kind of thing.
[01:37:08.367 --> 01:37:10.268]  And he said, no, I'm not going to do that.
[01:37:10.308 --> 01:37:14.331]  I'm going to try to bring down the budget and give money back to the people in the United States.
[01:37:15.052 --> 01:37:22.658]  Instead, what these guys did is that they sabotaged the candidacy of the Republican candidate, who was Nixon.
[01:37:22.738 --> 01:37:23.719]  And, you know, they brought up
[01:37:24.139 --> 01:37:24.961]  We're good to go.
[01:37:39.198 --> 01:38:07.673]  Now that's their public cover story, but if you look at the CIA and RAND, they prefer military dictatorships to freedom in countries because it allows the megacorporations to interface with a small ruling class and not have to deal with a society where people are allowed
[01:38:09.558 --> 01:38:10.458]  To elect the representatives.
[01:38:10.478 --> 01:38:11.819]  But let's briefly look at Kennedy.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.101]  Did you run into anything on him in their archives?
[01:38:14.141 --> 01:38:17.123]  Because we know at first he doubled defense spending.
[01:38:17.163 --> 01:38:18.564]  He was pro-war.
[01:38:18.965 --> 01:38:22.047]  Then he became anti-Vietnam War, anti-Federal Reserve.
[01:38:22.387 --> 01:38:28.512]  They brought him Operation Northwoods, the plan to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[01:38:29.012 --> 01:38:30.053]  And he said no.
[01:38:30.734 --> 01:38:35.137]  And then he was clearly killed by this very same overall system.
[01:38:35.177 --> 01:38:36.518]  So what happened with Kennedy?
[01:38:36.858 --> 01:38:46.882]  Well, with Kennedy, it's a very interesting dichotomy, because what you have is at the beginning, yes, he's very much a creature of that particular establishment, but then he starts moving away, as you yourself say.
[01:38:47.323 --> 01:38:50.064]  Northwoods, though, was provoked by the whole question of Cuba.
[01:38:50.664 --> 01:38:58.107]  As you know, he screwed up in the Bay of Pigs when he didn't get enough air cover to the Cubans who had landed there.
[01:38:58.307 --> 01:39:00.248]  So that became, like, a real irritant.
[01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:04.550]  And then the United States was preparing for another invasion of Cuba.
[01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:17.019]  And among those things that they were advocating was Northwood, which is, you know, staging supposed attacks by Cuban forces, so then they would give them an excuse to go in and invade.
[01:39:17.339 --> 01:39:25.105]  But the problem was that, you know, right around that time, Castro was also getting all his money and his armaments from the Soviet Union, and obviously his missiles.
[01:39:25.565 --> 01:39:32.971]  And then the missiles crisis erupted, and after that, you know, the United States cut a deal with the Soviet Union that they would no longer invade Cuba.
[01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:45.513]  So in the meantime, though, Kennedy was trying to set up the backing of Cuban exiles when it comes to actually attacking Cuba and having guerrilla warfare over there.
[01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:59.776]  And because of his experience with the CIA and with the Pentagon over the Bay of Pigs and over the missile crisis, because after all, the Pentagon wanted him to go in and invade, and nowadays we know that had
[01:40:00.496 --> 01:40:01.398]  Have he done so?
[01:40:01.498 --> 01:40:10.932]  It would have been a total disaster because they had nuclear weapons that were there and they were about to be sent directly to the United States.
[01:40:10.972 --> 01:40:14.237]  We would not have been able to go in and take out all those missiles.
[01:40:14.938 --> 01:40:16.339]  Because they were operative already.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:24.045]  Because of that, Kennedy started, you know, pulling away from the CIA and from the directives of the military industrial complex.
[01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:28.348]  And, you know, the question is yet to be resolved whether he actually was murdered because of this.
[01:40:28.848 --> 01:40:32.291]  He had grave doubts about Vietnam because of what happened at Bay of Pigs.
[01:40:32.931 --> 01:40:37.593]  And he thought that, you know, liberation movements, you know, really could not be dealt with in that way.
[01:40:37.953 --> 01:40:46.056]  In fact, the day that he was killed, his representative, Richard Goodwin, was meeting with Che Guevara down in South America to see that they could cut some kind of deal.
[01:40:47.137 --> 01:40:50.258]  So, uh, yeah, because there were a lot of people who were after his scalp.
[01:40:50.498 --> 01:40:52.339]  And, you know, unfortunately, he died for that.
[01:40:53.199 --> 01:41:13.798]  You know, and the people who were trying to set up this whole technocracy, which is what I refer to in my book all the time, which is you have a small group of people who feel that, you know, they should rule the world and, you know, they should line their pockets while doing so, going back all the way to the 1940s when, you know, the Ford Foundation
[01:41:14.238 --> 01:41:14.999]  We're good to go.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:52.554]  Obviously that didn't happen, but what did happen is something even better for the people who hold the reins of power, which is, you know, they destroyed the Soviet Union and now you have technocrats over there, you have technocrats over here, and it's a small group of people.
[01:41:52.874 --> 01:41:53.655]  They're ruling the world.
[01:41:54.176 --> 01:41:54.836]  And that's where we're at.
[01:41:54.856 --> 01:41:56.598]  Alright, let me stop you because this is the key.
[01:41:57.774 --> 01:42:08.999]  On the surface they say they're fighting communism and collectivism, but really they're creating a corporate vertical integration system and you're the only person to ever be allowed in to their files.
[01:42:09.059 --> 01:42:09.820]  It's in your book.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.040]  It's on record.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.963]  We have the Forge Foundation documents that mirror what Rand was up to.
[01:42:17.083 --> 01:42:24.667]  Go over specifically the type of technocracy they talked about, same thing as Abignal Brzezinski wrote about in Between Two Ages.
[01:42:25.408 --> 01:42:31.151]  Then, get into the world government, because you talked about you never believed in that, you thought it was a conspiracy theory.
[01:42:31.531 --> 01:42:37.395]  There you were in their own archives, seeing all of this and the type of world government they wanted to build.
[01:42:38.422 --> 01:42:57.399]  I mean, right from the beginning, another one of the major figures in RAN, John Williams, who was a mathematician, who was like, I think, the third or fourth higher in RAN, he said we should go in and nuke the Soviets right now and take over and have a world government, the United States, then merge into a world government that will be controlled by the U.S., but the entire world will be under this government.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:03.505]  And time and again, there have been people at RAN and affiliated with RAN who have come up with this idea.
[01:43:04.325 --> 01:43:21.697]  The problem is that that idea has been discredited in public, but yet there's a lot of people who still believe in that, because again, they believe in what they call the use of reason, and that there's a small group of people who will tell everybody else what to do because they know better.
[01:43:22.237 --> 01:43:24.078]  And thus, we don't need elections.
[01:43:24.499 --> 01:43:26.240]  We don't need the voice of the people.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.361]  We don't need anything like that.
[01:43:28.021 --> 01:43:32.262]  These guys, since they're scientists, or so they claim, they know what's best.
[01:43:32.282 --> 01:43:41.684]  And therefore, I mean, even today, if you go to the Rand Corporation and you say you have a problem, and you give them a question, they say, well, that may not be the question that you should be asking.
[01:43:41.884 --> 01:43:44.224]  Actually, this is the question that you should be asking.
[01:43:44.544 --> 01:43:45.485]  So they turn it around.
[01:43:46.005 --> 01:43:49.526]  So it has not changed at all, on the surface it seems to.
[01:43:49.846 --> 01:43:56.367]  But underneath, you still have these same drives for a small group of technocrats to be ruling the world.
[01:43:57.481 --> 01:44:01.805]  And, you know, obviously, you know, they went hand in hand with the Ford Foundation.
[01:44:01.865 --> 01:44:10.033]  The Ford Foundation used to go around, you know, giving front, giving cover to CIA operations throughout the world.
[01:44:10.554 --> 01:44:19.162]  And, you know, they even set up something called, I don't know if you're aware of this, something called Area 5 of the Ford Foundation, which has dealt with behavioral sciences in the 1950s.
[01:44:21.730 --> 01:44:29.539]  And what they would try to do, basically, is, you know, again, change the way that people think and intervene in foreign governments.
[01:44:29.699 --> 01:44:37.168]  And, you know, they provided cover for, you know, the coups that happened in Burma at the time, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, even Italy.
[01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:41.253]  I mean, these are things that have happened and they continue to happen to this very day.
[01:44:42.827 --> 01:44:43.908]  Now this is so important.
[01:44:43.948 --> 01:44:44.988]  Let's talk about Area 5.
[01:44:45.428 --> 01:44:48.610]  Let's talk about the type of world government they wanted to build.
[01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:53.172]  It has been discredited because patriots have been fighting it for more than 60 years.
[01:44:53.612 --> 01:45:09.200]  But now we do have a corporate global governance run by the banks who bankrupted our society by design and are now offering a global government run by them through the financial system to save us from the financial crisis they created.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.620]  And it's the same thing with the pension funds.
[01:45:11.781 --> 01:45:12.021]  Sure, sure.
[01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:12.702]  What they're doing is...
[01:45:42.845 --> 01:45:51.595]  And this goes back to Edward Bernays before the Rand Corporation, is they take away things like family, property, local control.
[01:45:51.896 --> 01:45:58.443]  They make you not value that, so you sell your soul for some wampum, kind of like the New York Indians.
[01:46:00.008 --> 01:46:05.790]  300 years ago, selling New York and Long Island for one bucket of glass beads.
[01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:09.091]  You know, that basically cost one silver dollar at the time.
[01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:25.877]  And so it's, we'll give you iPhones, we'll give you NFL, we'll give you UT football, we'll make those people, we'll make Michael Jordan the hero, not Mahatma Gandhi, not Jesus, not Martin Luther King, not George Washington,
[01:46:26.557 --> 01:46:31.461]  We will turn you into creatures who are basically me, me, me, me, me.
[01:46:31.901 --> 01:46:33.842]  So everybody's me, me, me, me, me.
[01:46:34.143 --> 01:46:39.827]  And then nobody will stand up for anybody else because we've been psychologically and culturally atomized.
[01:46:40.007 --> 01:46:40.647]  Exactly.
[01:46:40.707 --> 01:46:41.568]  That's exactly.
[01:46:41.928 --> 01:46:45.231]  And that is the main sin of the Rand Corporation.
[01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:47.312]  They introduce this kind of thinking into the world.
[01:46:47.692 --> 01:46:55.256]  They systematized it, formalized it, and thus gave us the foundation for this incredible transformation in the entire world.
[01:46:55.276 --> 01:47:13.904]  That's why I say that we're all Rant bastard children, because it started in the late 1970s and early 80s, but especially under Reagan, who was, again, another creature of the military-industrial complex, who came in and said, well, in the name of freedom, we're going to deregulate everything, because everything is better if it's deregulated.
[01:47:14.244 --> 01:47:18.390]  Which means basically it's like, hey, corporations can do whatever they want because there's no restraints on them.
[01:47:18.710 --> 01:47:21.194]  And, you know, we all saw what happened.
[01:47:21.675 --> 01:47:24.518]  We all saw what happened with, you know, when they repealed the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:47:24.819 --> 01:47:29.846]  You know, all these millions of foreclosures that we're going through, the whole financial collapse.
[01:47:29.906 --> 01:47:31.226]  Because it's not free market.
[01:47:31.326 --> 01:47:36.207]  It allows them who control the government rules to selectively steal and thieve.
[01:47:36.607 --> 01:47:38.348]  Now they've got us communalized.
[01:47:38.728 --> 01:47:41.749]  Now they've got us in a consumer collectivism.
[01:47:42.089 --> 01:47:50.410]  So they say, if you don't want the system to die, that you're now basically a Siamese twin of, connected to, you've got to give in to our next phase.
[01:47:50.850 --> 01:47:51.331]  Absolutely.
[01:47:51.411 --> 01:47:52.451]  I completely agree.
[01:47:52.811 --> 01:47:54.371]  And this is all done deliberately.
[01:47:55.111 --> 01:47:58.012]  You know, I mean, people have to be aware
[01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:02.835]  Continue.
[01:48:22.111 --> 01:48:25.974]  And basically, you know, I mean, that's where we are right now.
[01:48:26.054 --> 01:48:29.217]  I mean, they continue doing this kind of thing.
[01:48:29.297 --> 01:48:30.998]  They keep on feeding us.
[01:48:31.058 --> 01:48:32.299]  It's like bread and circuses.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.782]  Remember, you know, the Roman times.
[01:48:34.802 --> 01:48:36.603]  You know, it's like, we're going to have all these things.
[01:48:36.623 --> 01:48:37.564]  You're going to have all these...
[01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:57.794]  Sweet little product, and in the meantime, don't think too much about who is going to go into office, whether there's really any difference between the Democratic and the Republican Party, whether even if you have a little group of people who finally think, oh, maybe we should do something about this, but then begin to be co-opted immediately by larger forces behind them, such as the Tea Party.
[01:48:57.814 --> 01:49:02.856]  I mean, it's all of a beast, and we have to stand up for our rights.
[01:49:03.057 --> 01:49:05.698]  We have to tell people, no, this cannot be.
[01:49:08.063 --> 01:49:09.224]  You're absolutely right.
[01:49:10.706 --> 01:49:14.910]  Overall, did you get into any of the newer RAND Corporation documents?
[01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:22.097]  Because they're charting the police state takeover, the naked body scanners, the federalization of local police.
[01:49:22.558 --> 01:49:27.222]  They admit they're charting this nightmare system long before the terror attacks came.
[01:49:27.683 --> 01:49:29.184]  They said, we're putting this in place.
[01:49:29.705 --> 01:49:31.026]  The terror attacks are coming.
[01:49:31.854 --> 01:49:34.797]  There's another arm of the system stage of the attacks, of course they knew it.
[01:49:35.457 --> 01:49:51.010]  And we're going to take control of society this way, and in the next phase, and they're already doing it with most of the, you know, tuitions being paid for, the scholarships, are now about data mining, spying, prison guards, surveillance.
[01:49:51.391 --> 01:49:59.598]  They are shifting the economy over to one purely run by the military-industrial complex, where you can't get a job unless it's working for them.
[01:49:59.997 --> 01:50:00.438]  That's right.
[01:50:00.538 --> 01:50:00.999]  That's right.
[01:50:01.079 --> 01:50:02.341]  Or unless you pass through clearance.
[01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:04.183]  I mean, it's absurd.
[01:50:04.344 --> 01:50:05.666]  It's totally absurd.
[01:50:06.026 --> 01:50:12.997]  And one of the things that really bugs me about this kind of thing is that, for instance, you know, it's like, even when you're applying for a job, people want to see your credit record.
[01:50:13.417 --> 01:50:15.961]  And I go, well, what does that have anything to do
[01:50:16.121 --> 01:50:19.203]  What does that have to do with the fact of whether you can do your job?
[01:50:19.543 --> 01:50:22.565]  Whether you can, you know, whether you qualify for this?
[01:50:22.625 --> 01:50:22.825]  No.
[01:50:22.845 --> 01:50:27.028]  They want to see whether you're a true consumer and whether you have paid your debts.
[01:50:27.448 --> 01:50:32.691]  In other words, again, you're being viewed just as a consumer instead of a professional or a citizen.
[01:50:32.951 --> 01:50:34.912]  And that's the kind of thing that I think is intolerable.
[01:50:37.574 --> 01:50:38.054]  Amazing.
[01:50:38.134 --> 01:50:38.895]  Alex, stay there.
[01:50:40.862 --> 01:50:47.208]  We're going to come back and continue with your book, the research, more on world government.

[01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:01.062]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.102 --> 01:51:06.467]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.707 --> 01:51:11.331]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.711 --> 01:51:12.112]  It's true.
[01:51:12.192 --> 01:51:16.756]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.276 --> 01:51:21.981]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:53:52.048 --> 01:53:52.728]  You look like an angel
[01:54:07.905 --> 01:54:12.269]  Alex Abea is our guest.
[01:54:12.289 --> 01:54:19.094]  AlexAbea.com is the website.
[01:54:19.294 --> 01:54:22.396]  Abea spelled A-B-E-L-L-A.
[01:54:31.058 --> 01:54:35.360]  The best-selling book is Soldiers of Reason, the Rand Corporation of the American Empire.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:39.262]  You can get it anywhere, where better books are sold, or Amazon.com.
[01:54:39.362 --> 01:54:43.444]  We're going to go back to Alex, but I want to condense this down, okay?
[01:54:44.605 --> 01:54:47.306]  I've read Propaganda, that's the name of the book, by Edward Bernays.
[01:54:47.366 --> 01:54:48.226]  I've read his other writings.
[01:54:48.727 --> 01:54:50.628]  I've read British Ministry of Defense reports.
[01:54:50.768 --> 01:54:56.931]  I've read the released and declassified information out of British
[01:54:58.078 --> 01:55:21.389]  uh... think tanks uh... that have developed very similar situations and it was brought to a high science by the sixties they have these systems back in the thirties and they weaponize culture with sex and glitz you know i don't defend a lot of the oppressive things going on in some muslim nations but they can recognize this is an alien weaponized culture meant to get our children our women
[01:55:22.489 --> 01:55:25.311]  Break up our families to make us more easily controlled.
[01:55:25.371 --> 01:55:32.016]  And that's why they're the big enemy of the globalists because they're not, you know, they're a billion, 100 million people and most of them aren't going along with it.
[01:55:32.376 --> 01:55:36.900]  Now, if you go back to Joseph McCarthy, he was a good guy.
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:37.740]  He meant well.
[01:55:38.781 --> 01:55:39.842]  He had some problems.
[01:55:39.902 --> 01:55:40.763]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:55:41.243 --> 01:55:43.184]  He was worried about communist infiltration.
[01:55:43.224 --> 01:55:46.967]  He knew about Stalin killing millions and millions of people in Ukraine alone.
[01:55:47.668 --> 01:55:48.929]  And the media used him
[01:55:49.449 --> 01:55:55.371]  To set up hysteria to get the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon more power, but it's been declassified the whole time.
[01:55:55.411 --> 01:55:57.951]  They've been funding the Soviets from before World War II.
[01:55:58.372 --> 01:56:01.973]  They've been funding them and the British have been funding them in 1917.
[01:56:02.093 --> 01:56:06.414]  It's also been declassified that Mao was put into power by the CIA.
[01:56:06.434 --> 01:56:10.655]  David Rockefeller in 1973 wrote about it in the New York Times and said how great Mao Zedong was.
[01:56:10.675 --> 01:56:12.095]  I read those quotes last week.
[01:56:12.115 --> 01:56:13.016]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[01:56:14.076 --> 01:56:24.244]  So they used the threat of the Soviets and, you know, locking up janitors and file clerks, you know, that worked at the FBI or whatever, saying they were commies, because they were going to communist meetings.
[01:56:24.264 --> 01:56:26.385]  They believed this is how you empowered the people.
[01:56:26.425 --> 01:56:28.367]  They were useful idiots, as Lenin would call them.
[01:56:28.887 --> 01:56:30.388]  He was very useful and they loved him.
[01:56:30.788 --> 01:56:37.974]  The minute he found out, well, wait, there's think tanks funding this, Ford Foundation, the army wants to merge us with the Soviet Union?
[01:56:38.294 --> 01:56:40.896]  Because this was all being written up at the time by Rand in the 50s.
[01:56:41.456 --> 01:56:42.237]  These are now public.
[01:56:43.524 --> 01:56:47.227]  He freaked out and came out and said the army's running communism.
[01:56:47.247 --> 01:56:50.069]  Well, yeah, the army set up the UN at Presidio.
[01:56:50.489 --> 01:56:53.232]  They have to control both sides to create the synthesis.
[01:56:53.952 --> 01:56:58.496]  And then he was politically destroyed and they got him up before Congress and said,
[01:56:59.693 --> 01:57:03.057]  You think the army runs the commies?
[01:57:03.998 --> 01:57:05.761]  And it was over for Joseph McCarthy.
[01:57:05.981 --> 01:57:06.862]  He wasn't useful.
[01:57:07.503 --> 01:57:11.928]  Alex Abeya, getting into merging us with the Soviet Union and the Rand Corporation documents.
[01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:13.490]  We're about to go to break.
[01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:16.234]  Sorry, this is a short segment, but what's your take on what I just talked about?
[01:57:16.494 --> 01:57:17.435]  I think you're absolutely correct.
[01:57:17.476 --> 01:57:30.934]  I mean, I think that, you know, McCarthy pointed out the danger of, you know, this kind of communist infiltration, which at the time a lot of liberals thought, well, that's not true, but actually has been proven that, yes, there was a lot of communist infiltration in this country, whether they would have... That's right.
[01:57:30.954 --> 01:57:32.296]  The Soviets opened the files.
[01:57:32.336 --> 01:57:33.418]  He was absolutely...
[01:57:33.718 --> 01:57:34.499]  Yes, he was correct.
[01:57:34.559 --> 01:57:35.059]  He was correct.
[01:57:35.119 --> 01:57:40.925]  I mean, you know, the way in which he went about it, perhaps, you know, could have been better, but he was on the right track.
[01:57:41.285 --> 01:57:43.687]  Unfortunately, you know, he was also an alcoholic, and that was his problem.
[01:57:43.707 --> 01:57:50.934]  The way in which he presented things, in which he went, you know, went off the cuff, you know, destroyed the content, the useful content of what he had.
[01:57:50.954 --> 01:57:56.839]  But you notice he got destroyed, though, when he pointed out that our own government wanted a form of collectivism.
[01:57:57.139 --> 01:57:57.839]  Right, exactly.
[01:57:57.879 --> 01:57:59.440]  But on the other hand, it was true!
[01:57:59.921 --> 01:58:02.542]  A lot of people in the government did think like that.
[01:58:03.522 --> 01:58:05.143]  They thought that that was the way of the world.
[01:58:05.183 --> 01:58:06.364]  You have to remember one thing.
[01:58:06.804 --> 01:58:11.126]  In the late 1940s, a lot of people thought that there was no future for capitalism.
[01:58:11.527 --> 01:58:16.849]  It's hard for us to conceive of that because the Soviet Union went down in flames in the 1980s.
[01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:21.312]  But in the late 1940s, everybody was saying that there is no future for capitalism.
[01:58:21.572 --> 01:58:23.153]  The Soviets and the Communists are going to win.
[01:58:23.793 --> 01:58:34.537]  And, you know, when you get into that kind of mindset, and you start, again, politicizing culture, which is, you know, what happens with that, that is a great danger to any society, and that's what McCarthy was trying to point out.
[01:58:34.577 --> 01:58:36.237]  All right, Alex, back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:36.377 --> 01:58:38.418]  We have a lot of breaks at the end and start of the hour.
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:47.201]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.489 --> 01:59:04.962]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:59:05.963 --> 01:59:09.646]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:10.649 --> 01:59:22.640]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:59:23.421 --> 01:59:30.667]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:59:31.368 --> 01:59:40.956]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:59:41.737 --> 01:59:45.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:48.863]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:59:52.526 --> 01:59:54.428]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.888 --> 01:59:57.651]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.061]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.742 --> 02:00:06.783]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.504 --> 02:00:08.606]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.267 --> 02:00:10.088]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.849 --> 02:00:11.770]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.411 --> 02:00:16.096]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.597 --> 02:00:20.662]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.723 --> 02:00:24.424]  Alex Abeya is our guest in this short segment.
[02:00:24.444 --> 02:00:31.007]  He's going to get into some more of his discoveries in more modern times of Iran Corporation getting us into Iraq and other wars.
[02:00:31.487 --> 02:00:36.589]  Then starting in the next segment, for several more segments, we'll talk to Matt, William, John, Ryan, Steve, and others.
[02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:38.530]  But no group in the globalist
[02:00:39.230 --> 02:00:42.512]  Social engineering hierarchy, the master architects of the New World Order.
[02:00:42.772 --> 02:00:46.714]  Do you find an organization more powerful, more influential than RAND?
[02:00:47.074 --> 02:01:00.421]  RAND was basically given the quarterbacking job by the Ford Foundation and Carnegie Endowment to set up this corporate world government that collectivizes us through a fake free market controlled within a false
[02:01:01.601 --> 02:01:06.304]  I mean, that is such a prime example of what they're doing.
[02:01:06.324 --> 02:01:11.186]  I mean, you know, for crying out loud, you know, we're still in Iraq, right?
[02:01:11.206 --> 02:01:13.267]  We still have 50,000 over there.
[02:01:13.567 --> 02:01:16.209]  And, you know, we're still in Afghanistan.
[02:01:16.409 --> 02:01:20.671]  A lot of people are asking themselves, well, what the hell are we doing there?
[02:01:30.936 --> 02:01:31.276]  We're good to go.
[02:01:50.146 --> 02:01:53.467]  Who is the head of the Office of Net Assessment.
[02:01:53.867 --> 02:01:56.548]  He's been in the Pentagon since 1973.
[02:01:57.509 --> 02:02:03.151]  And every president, including President Obama right now, has reconfirmed him in his post.
[02:02:03.431 --> 02:02:04.311]  And what is his post?
[02:02:04.631 --> 02:02:06.792]  To dream up new weapons.
[02:02:07.132 --> 02:02:11.694]  He's the kind of guy who came up with the whole concept of, you know, the Star Wars approach to missiles.
[02:02:11.714 --> 02:02:13.354]  You know, we went into
[02:02:14.935 --> 02:02:19.017]  He's the one that ordered West Point to make everybody read Starship Troopers, the book.
[02:02:35.604 --> 02:02:36.225]  Absolutely.
[02:02:36.665 --> 02:02:38.447]  Yes, he's the one who's like leading us.
[02:02:38.467 --> 02:02:39.748]  He's like the leading light.
[02:02:40.089 --> 02:02:43.572]  The man is in his late 80s, he's almost 90 right now, and he's still there.
[02:02:44.113 --> 02:02:47.456]  He's like, he looks like something out of science fiction, only it's a science fact.
[02:02:47.917 --> 02:02:50.960]  And he's still there, and he was one of the founders of RAND.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.583]  And he wants to inject all the troops with mind control drugs.
[02:02:55.603 --> 02:02:56.804]  That's even in Wired Magazine.
[02:02:56.844 --> 02:03:00.026]  He says it won't be what weapons they have, but what drugs they're on.
[02:03:11.013 --> 02:03:12.374]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:03:12.695 --> 02:03:29.891]  And the whole rationale for going into Iraq, for going into Desert Storm back in the 80s, is you have to remember, this all dates back to the 1980s, is again, you know, you can trace it directly to RAND studies that came out in the early 70s, saying after the
[02:03:32.125 --> 02:03:39.050]  The problem with the 1973 oil embargo is that the United States has to take control of the Middle East.
[02:03:39.651 --> 02:03:49.438]  I mean, in so many words, they want to, whether it's directly or indirectly with the United States forces there, or indirectly through friendly regimes that will do as the United States bids.
[02:03:50.079 --> 02:03:52.841]  And it's been a constant in their thinking.
[02:03:53.462 --> 02:03:57.625]  But when they say USA, they mean the corporate elite that uses us as their muscle.
[02:03:57.925 --> 02:03:58.366]  Exactly!
[02:03:58.406 --> 02:04:11.998]  I mean, because USA to them is the small group of technocrats who, of course, you know, disguises itself as a democratically elected government, but says we are the ones who actually know what the questions are and what the answers should be.
[02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:14.894]  Well, that's what Carol Quigley said.
[02:04:14.934 --> 02:04:23.706]  He said, we control both parties, we give the illusion of change, and by controlling the leadership, we can continually move our agenda towards world government down the road.
[02:04:24.107 --> 02:04:24.888]  And isn't it true?
[02:04:25.289 --> 02:04:26.651]  Isn't that what we're seeing all around us?
[02:04:28.632 --> 02:04:36.596]  And then meanwhile, the media will admit world government's here, but say it's the solution to all our problems, but then demonize those of us that say there's a world government.
[02:04:37.356 --> 02:04:39.017]  They say we're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[02:04:39.037 --> 02:04:41.738]  I mean, if that isn't mind control, I don't know what is.
[02:04:42.118 --> 02:04:44.439]  Alex Abeo's our guest, alexabeo.com.
[02:04:44.839 --> 02:04:48.681]  We have links to him up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:04:49.121 --> 02:04:53.183]  He's an amazing researcher with key intel on the globalist internal operations.
[02:04:53.663 --> 02:04:57.485]  We'll be right back with your phone calls on the other side, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:59.514 --> 02:05:03.758]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.078 --> 02:05:04.678]  Number 1.
[02:05:04.999 --> 02:05:08.141]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.422 --> 02:05:08.982]  Number 2.
[02:05:09.282 --> 02:05:13.826]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.166 --> 02:05:14.607]  It's true.
[02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:19.471]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:19.791 --> 02:05:20.332]  Number 3.
[02:05:20.612 --> 02:05:23.895]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.195 --> 02:05:27.898]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.098 --> 02:05:28.639]  Number 4.
[02:05:28.899 --> 02:05:31.261]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:31.641 --> 02:05:35.044]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.324 --> 02:05:35.545]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.125 --> 02:05:40.049]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.269 --> 02:05:45.033]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.313 --> 02:05:49.340]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.042]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.283 --> 02:05:53.346]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:05:59.909 --> 02:06:02.510]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:02.931 --> 02:06:07.893]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:08.254 --> 02:06:09.975]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:10.295 --> 02:06:15.117]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:15.297 --> 02:06:16.258]  How much do you want?
[02:06:16.478 --> 02:06:17.238]  When do you want it?
[02:06:17.619 --> 02:06:19.220]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.320]  When will you need it?
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.641]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:22.762 --> 02:06:23.862]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:24.102 --> 02:06:25.423]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:25.623 --> 02:06:30.688]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:30.889 --> 02:06:34.072]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:34.473 --> 02:06:37.976]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:38.297 --> 02:06:39.298]  How much will you need?
[02:06:39.538 --> 02:06:40.139]  We don't know.
[02:06:40.439 --> 02:06:41.360]  How much do you want?
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:42.281]  All you can get.
[02:06:42.481 --> 02:06:43.302]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:43.542 --> 02:06:46.306]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:46.606 --> 02:06:49.710]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:50.652]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:59.451 --> 02:07:04.875]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:06.116 --> 02:07:10.880]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:18.025]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:19.987 --> 02:07:22.289]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:26.372]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:07:28.482 --> 02:07:32.343]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:07:33.064 --> 02:07:36.185]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:07:36.885 --> 02:07:37.705]  Others don't.
[02:07:38.125 --> 02:07:40.006]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:07:40.266 --> 02:07:41.787]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:42.047 --> 02:07:44.607]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:44.948 --> 02:07:51.190]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:51.570 --> 02:07:53.771]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:54.271 --> 02:07:56.291]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:07:56.632 --> 02:07:57.492]  Others don't.
[02:08:01.075 --> 02:08:07.085]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:07.706 --> 02:08:10.691]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.071 --> 02:08:22.558]  Alex Abea, one of the leading experts on the Rand Corporation, Emmy-nominated news producer, best-selling author, is our guest.
[02:08:22.758 --> 02:08:24.419]  AlexAbea.com is the website.
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:27.701]  Alex, I want to go to calls, but I want to get into one other issue.
[02:08:28.922 --> 02:08:31.804]  And for listeners that are new listeners, they won't believe this when I say it.
[02:08:31.824 --> 02:08:33.545]  So guys, search engine right now.
[02:08:34.726 --> 02:08:37.168]  Google acquires company that can predict the future.
[02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:58.074]  I remember going back to declassified corporate and government documents from even 40 years ago where they said we've got to have the uniform product code and then they wanted biometrics in the 90s to track every purchase you make, RFID on all the products, now search engines using NSA keyword technology.
[02:08:58.914 --> 02:09:08.643]  To be able to search the third dimension, not just cyberspace, but to be able to search the real world and Google Street View and all of that is just one facet of that.
[02:09:09.504 --> 02:09:12.487]  And they now say they can predict mass movements by 99%.
[02:09:14.268 --> 02:09:17.590]  In fact, there's the headline, Google invest in company that predicts the future.
[02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:19.191]  No one saw it coming.
[02:09:19.311 --> 02:09:19.791]  Yeah, right.
[02:09:20.291 --> 02:09:23.553]  And of course, that's a Pentagon-admitted funded group, the company they bought.
[02:09:23.953 --> 02:09:29.937]  Also, Google admits they're basically CIA, In-Q-Tel funded just 11 years ago, with total dominance now.
[02:09:31.257 --> 02:09:53.946]  And you go back to the Rand Corporation in the 60s, and your book talks about this, and you talk about this in the interview we did with you out in California last week when I sent a crew out there, that they said that was key to track and surveil everyone, not so much to know what people are doing because they might be terrorists, that's just the cover, but to understand our hopes and dreams so they can learn what propaganda is working and to literally predict the future.
[02:09:55.026 --> 02:09:57.428]  To a very large degree, that's correct, yes.
[02:09:57.488 --> 02:10:03.913]  Of course, you have to remember, of course, I mean, another one of Rand's beautiful inventions was the spy satellite.
[02:10:04.274 --> 02:10:06.355]  You know, we can also thank him for that.
[02:10:06.776 --> 02:10:18.005]  So, you know, today Google uses that spy satellite to be able to really, you know, observe everything that we do, down to, like, not down to the street level, you know, from above, from below.
[02:10:18.025 --> 02:10:20.147]  They're tracking our movements everywhere.
[02:10:20.167 --> 02:10:20.948]  I mean, I just...
[02:10:22.435 --> 02:10:23.677]  It's awful.
[02:10:23.697 --> 02:10:25.799]  It's really awful and we really have to do something about it.
[02:10:34.031 --> 02:10:34.211]  Right.
[02:10:34.271 --> 02:10:36.812]  Well, they figure that everyone is a consumer.
[02:10:36.872 --> 02:10:38.433]  Everyone then has his own price.
[02:10:38.853 --> 02:10:46.556]  That there is a level at which they will go on and do things that they might not otherwise conceive of.
[02:10:46.976 --> 02:10:51.098]  Again, it goes back to the same rationale that people are just consumers.
[02:10:51.138 --> 02:11:02.103]  That people are just creatures that buy and enjoy instead of thinking people that perhaps believe in God, that believe in family, and that believe in their own country.
[02:11:02.663 --> 02:11:11.609]  And then they can find everyone's price and basically get people to literally sell their intellect, their souls, their identity to these people.
[02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:12.929]  Let's take a phone call.
[02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:15.411]  Matt in Minnesota, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:11:16.972 --> 02:11:18.693]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:11:19.073 --> 02:11:19.574]  Good, go ahead.
[02:11:19.774 --> 02:11:20.134]  Hey, hi.
[02:11:21.034 --> 02:11:31.361]  Hi, yeah, InfoWars actually ran an article a couple years ago in October and it was about Rand Corporation lobbying the Pentagon
[02:11:32.185 --> 02:11:36.416]  To, uh, start a war in order to save the, uh, collapsing economy.
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:41.443]  Well, that has always been a tenet of the RAD Corporation.
[02:11:41.463 --> 02:11:42.704]  I mean, they have always said that.
[02:11:43.304 --> 02:11:49.389]  Not necessarily in so many words, but they have always said, you know, there's nothing like a good war to stimulate the economy.
[02:11:49.429 --> 02:11:53.252]  I mean, and they point to the Second World War.
[02:11:53.632 --> 02:11:55.614]  They point, you know, to Vietnam.
[02:11:55.834 --> 02:12:00.698]  And, you know, not to mention, you know, like I said, we were talking about before, you know, the Iraq War.
[02:12:00.778 --> 02:12:03.420]  I mean, you know, all the money... Well, war is the health of the state.
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:03.901]  Yes.
[02:12:05.162 --> 02:12:06.543]  It's a state of perpetual war.
[02:12:07.827 --> 02:12:08.607]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:11.329]  We are definitely in perpetual war right now.
[02:12:11.729 --> 02:12:17.792]  I'm wondering if there's anything new like that out of Orion Corporation recently.
[02:12:18.587 --> 02:12:22.669]  Where they're, you know, asking for a war, asking for this and that.
[02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:26.331]  Well, they wouldn't put in so many words at this point.
[02:12:26.351 --> 02:12:28.172]  They're not that obvious.
[02:12:28.512 --> 02:12:32.114]  But what they do say is that they advocate intervention in certain places, etc.
[02:12:32.154 --> 02:12:33.715]  For instance, in Afghanistan.
[02:12:34.115 --> 02:12:37.537]  I mean, they have links right now with think tanks in Afghanistan.
[02:12:38.277 --> 02:12:46.924]  At the very beginning, after we went in and deposed the Taliban in 9-11, they have constant communications with them.
[02:12:46.984 --> 02:12:50.546]  They have a base in Qatar in the Arab Emirates.
[02:12:52.047 --> 02:12:57.511]  There, they're already trying to change, again, the culture of the place.
[02:12:57.652 --> 02:12:58.672]  I mentioned that in the book.
[02:12:59.993 --> 02:13:02.195]  They're going after the educational system.
[02:13:02.495 --> 02:13:04.297]  They were invited by the Emir of
[02:13:05.077 --> 02:13:05.477]  We're good.
[02:13:27.594 --> 02:13:36.758]  Instead of valuing true freedom, which creates incredible wealth, they give them fake free market consumerism, which then financially destroys us in the end.
[02:13:36.778 --> 02:13:38.339]  They tell us, get into debt.
[02:13:38.839 --> 02:13:40.660]  All of this designed by these people.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:41.541]  Matt, great point.
[02:13:41.561 --> 02:13:42.341]  Appreciate your call.
[02:13:42.661 --> 02:13:44.142]  William in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:13:45.983 --> 02:13:46.283]  Hello?
[02:13:46.523 --> 02:13:46.823]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:48.224 --> 02:13:54.307]  Yes, you know, please keep me on hold after the question, because I can only listen on the phone.
[02:13:54.327 --> 02:13:55.207]  But my question is,
[02:13:56.331 --> 02:14:04.094]  When Alex was reading all of these documents, did he get any sense of hubris from these people?
[02:14:04.174 --> 02:14:05.835]  Obviously, they're very smart people.
[02:14:05.915 --> 02:14:06.575]  Durant's so great.
[02:14:06.595 --> 02:14:08.056]  Hubris is their middle name, sir.
[02:14:09.456 --> 02:14:13.278]  That's exactly... I mean, obviously, what do you expect from people who think that they know all the answers?
[02:14:14.196 --> 02:14:18.980]  I mean, anybody who doubts them is cast out among the unbelievers.
[02:14:21.042 --> 02:14:21.823]  They know everything.
[02:14:22.043 --> 02:14:27.348]  So the hubris is right there, right from the very first papers that they have ever written.
[02:14:28.509 --> 02:14:33.313]  But do you think it indicates any kind of weakness, or do you really think that they
[02:14:34.815 --> 02:14:35.795]  They do know everything.
[02:14:36.156 --> 02:14:37.556]  I don't know.
[02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:46.400]  No, they don't know everything, but they're scientifically studying and categorizing human behavior in their own words to know how to manipulate us.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.061]  Exactly.
[02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:50.562]  And that's why they even set up the Department of Social Sciences.
[02:14:51.102 --> 02:14:55.164]  Originally, Iran was set up to develop new weapons of destruction.
[02:14:55.484 --> 02:15:00.027]  But they realized that in order to develop and to carry out and to
[02:15:11.610 --> 02:15:18.911]  And they learned how to do psychological testing to get police officers with low IQs that enjoy brutality.
[02:15:19.671 --> 02:15:28.794]  They learned how to find specialized psychological types to fill in their compartmentalized system with the types of people they need.
[02:15:28.834 --> 02:15:29.634]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:30.414 --> 02:15:31.735]  But William, let me tell you something.
[02:15:33.335 --> 02:15:36.877]  If you're calling in to listen to the show, we have a free listener line.
[02:15:38.558 --> 02:15:41.419]  It's 646-5000.
[02:15:41.439 --> 02:15:41.859]  646-5000.
[02:15:42.099 --> 02:15:46.641]  So 512-646-5000, William.
[02:15:46.661 --> 02:15:47.441]  Do you have that number?
[02:15:49.522 --> 02:15:55.145]  Okay, because so many people, you know, are trying to listen on shortwave or satellite or the internet or they try to call in to listen.
[02:15:55.165 --> 02:15:55.205]  512-646-5000.
[02:15:58.995 --> 02:16:02.396]  And you can also get the free iPhone app if you have an iPhone, and listen that way.
[02:16:02.997 --> 02:16:04.577]  And that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:16:04.857 --> 02:16:06.318]  John in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:16:06.338 --> 02:16:10.440]  Hey guys, have either of you guys seen Being There?
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:16.302]  It's a movie adapted from Jersey Kozinski's novella with Peter Sellers.
[02:16:16.702 --> 02:16:18.063]  Yes, of course, right, I remember it.
[02:16:18.923 --> 02:16:26.726]  Okay, and I just recently found out that Mr. Kozinski received grants from the Guggenheim Fellowship and the Ford Foundation.
[02:16:28.304 --> 02:16:38.831]  In light of what Mr. Abeya said about Rand's involvement in JFK's kingmaking, do you think that Kuczynski knew anything about the Rand Corporation?
[02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:42.870]  You know, the characters in the movie, their last name is Rand.
[02:16:42.970 --> 02:16:45.011]  So, I mean, I think there's an obvious connection there.
[02:16:45.031 --> 02:16:45.891]  There's an obvious reference.
[02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:47.931]  Besides, Kaczynski did move among those circles.
[02:16:48.451 --> 02:16:50.272]  Obviously, though, he took his life in the 1980s.
[02:16:50.352 --> 02:16:59.413]  But before that, there's one thing that I mentioned in the book, is that Rand was extremely involved in New York City governance under John Lindsay.
[02:16:59.573 --> 02:17:03.754]  And that's when Kaczynski was at his prime, at his peak.
[02:17:04.074 --> 02:17:09.415]  When he wrote The Painted Bird, when he wrote Being There, when he wrote all those novels, those wonderful novels that he wrote.
[02:17:09.955 --> 02:17:10.235]  I think so.
[02:17:31.523 --> 02:17:34.644]  Yeah, they were using New York and then later L.A.
[02:17:34.764 --> 02:17:42.007]  as models of how to basically have the military industrial complex totally, secretly federalized and bring in their system of governance.
[02:17:42.047 --> 02:17:42.867]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:43.167 --> 02:17:50.890]  Speaking of movies, obviously, Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's film, you know, they call it the bland corporation, the mineshaft gap.
[02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:52.091]  Talk about those parallels.
[02:17:52.351 --> 02:17:55.272]  Well, certainly, I mean, Dr. Strangelove was
[02:17:56.324 --> 02:17:56.745]  We're good.
[02:18:11.937 --> 02:18:12.157]  I don't
[02:18:28.362 --> 02:18:31.684]  And his character in the movie is Dr. Strangelove.
[02:18:49.952 --> 02:18:50.933]  Absolutely, yes!
[02:18:51.153 --> 02:18:52.094]  Mein Führer!
[02:18:52.414 --> 02:18:53.115]  I can walk!
[02:18:53.695 --> 02:18:57.518]  Of course, animals would have to be bred and slaughtered.
[02:18:58.079 --> 02:19:04.324]  There would have to be ten females to each mare, and because of the incredible responsibility, they would be chosen for their beauty.
[02:19:04.384 --> 02:19:13.952]  In fact, in fact, Kubrick took so many lines and so many concepts from what Kahn wrote that, you know, Kahn said, hey, you know, I should get royalties from this.
[02:19:14.492 --> 02:19:17.534]  Of course, it'll be quite easy to construct such a machine.
[02:19:17.554 --> 02:19:24.277]  All you have to have is a wheel and a group of complex of computers connected to belly bombs.
[02:19:25.298 --> 02:19:27.199]  But why didn't you tell the world?
[02:19:27.219 --> 02:19:28.039]  That's right.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.140]  All of that.
[02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:33.242]  I mean, obviously, it's exaggerated a little bit, but not much, believe me.
[02:19:33.322 --> 02:19:33.923]  Not much.
[02:19:34.423 --> 02:19:36.484]  I mean, the comic effect comes from the content.
[02:19:37.045 --> 02:19:39.968]  And George C. Scott, we just so happen to have a plan.
[02:19:40.028 --> 02:19:41.649]  Plan R for just this continuancy.
[02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:43.691]  We'll only lose 10, 20 million tops.
[02:19:43.952 --> 02:19:45.153]  I wouldn't say we can get our hair masked.
[02:19:45.313 --> 02:19:46.134]  Come on, let's do it!
[02:19:46.154 --> 02:19:47.996]  You're gonna let the Russian ambassador in here?
[02:19:48.836 --> 02:19:49.817]  They'll see the big board!
[02:19:51.319 --> 02:19:52.800]  He was battered after Curtis LeMay.
[02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:54.402]  Again, one of the main figures in Rats.
[02:19:54.442 --> 02:19:55.643]  Stay there, let's talk about when we come back.
[02:19:55.663 --> 02:19:57.805]  We'll have to keep you into the next last 30 minutes.
[02:19:57.865 --> 02:19:58.406]  It's just too important.
[02:19:59.938 --> 02:20:01.839]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[02:20:01.999 --> 02:20:04.360]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:12.064]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[02:21:03.701 --> 02:21:04.622]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:04.962 --> 02:21:08.644]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:08.664 --> 02:21:11.106]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:11.126 --> 02:21:16.569]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:16.989 --> 02:21:23.213]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:23.653 --> 02:21:29.198]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:29.598 --> 02:21:33.321]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:33.801 --> 02:21:37.825]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:38.105 --> 02:21:43.649]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:44.050 --> 02:21:47.032]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:47.593 --> 02:21:49.014]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:49.574 --> 02:21:50.015]  It's here.

[02:21:58.857 --> 02:22:02.518]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:02.938 --> 02:22:08.339]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:08.819 --> 02:22:13.920]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:28.125]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:28.425 --> 02:22:33.747]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:34.027 --> 02:22:39.909]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:22:44.091 --> 02:22:46.111]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:22:46.131 --> 02:22:46.191]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.168 --> 02:23:00.168]  Do you know someone who's a Constitution basher?
[02:23:00.308 --> 02:23:03.489]  Then here's the ammo you need to silence them once and for all.
[02:23:03.729 --> 02:23:05.570]  Introducing the Crash Course on the U.S.
[02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:10.471]  Constitution, How to Argue with a Liberal About Constitutional Issues and Win Every Time.
[02:23:10.711 --> 02:23:18.952]  If you believe it's time we stop disgusting left-wing lies and start telling the truth about America's Christian heritage, this Crash Course for Patriots is for you.
[02:23:19.212 --> 02:23:21.893]  Start neutralizing the liberal propaganda being
[02:23:22.113 --> 02:23:22.813]  We're good to go.
[02:23:51.425 --> 02:23:56.887]  I would guess that they could then work their way back to the present gross national product within, say, 20 years.
[02:23:58.568 --> 02:24:06.372]  But look here, Doctor, wouldn't this nucleus of survivors be so grief-stricken and anguished that they
[02:24:21.129 --> 02:24:23.811]  Well, envy the dead and not want to go on living?
[02:24:24.811 --> 02:24:25.272]  No, sir.
[02:24:26.232 --> 02:24:26.753]  Excuse me.
[02:24:36.859 --> 02:24:40.542]  Also then, when you go down into the mine, everyone will still be alive!
[02:24:40.902 --> 02:24:47.086]  There will be no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion will be one of nostalgia for those left behind.
[02:24:47.106 --> 02:24:47.907]  Combined,
[02:24:49.207 --> 02:24:53.388]  With a spirit of bold curiosity for the adventure ahead!
[02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:04.651]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:25:05.112 --> 02:25:07.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:10.713 --> 02:25:16.895]  The Rand Corporation, later Dick Cheney and others, came out in Congress in 1986 in the Oliver North hearings.
[02:25:18.339 --> 02:25:31.511]  ...planned on staging crises in these countries, not just in the United States, but all over the Western world, and terror attacks, or war with the Soviets, as a pretext for totally reorganizing society.
[02:25:31.551 --> 02:25:33.673]  And Rand wanted that nuclear war.
[02:25:34.114 --> 02:25:37.097]  They wanted to be hit by the Soviets and have much of the U.S.
[02:25:37.137 --> 02:25:41.321]  wiped out, so they could completely rebuild everything.
[02:25:41.821 --> 02:25:49.125]  And on its ashes, build a world government and reduce population in the aftermath of that attack.
[02:25:49.165 --> 02:25:53.507]  And that's what's covered in the film by Stanley Kubrick, of course, Dr. Strangelove.
[02:25:55.788 --> 02:26:02.812]  I know that there was a lot of pressure put out to even delay the release of the film, and the government was actually upset with some of the things that Stanley Kubrick was doing.
[02:26:03.172 --> 02:26:04.253]  Or was that just a cover?
[02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:05.954]  Was Stanley Kubrick involved with the government?
[02:26:07.276 --> 02:26:08.577]  So I remember where he was not.
[02:26:08.717 --> 02:26:09.237]  No, no.
[02:26:09.357 --> 02:26:17.960]  But here's the thing, which I've always found kind of curious, is that originally the movie was supposed to be a serious movie.
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:21.601]  It was not supposed to be a satire, as it is right now.
[02:26:22.402 --> 02:26:25.443]  And ultimately, you know, he decided to make it funny.
[02:26:26.143 --> 02:26:30.465]  So the question then becomes, well, did he decide to make it funny so as to diffuse
[02:26:31.145 --> 02:26:44.168]  The theories and the opinions and notions that come out and that actually do exist, that actually are taken for serious by people, you know, by the technocrats who want to rule the country.
[02:26:44.888 --> 02:26:57.671]  Or was he also, you know, involved in this whole thing and in a way he said, well, I'm going to do this but I'm going to make it so like everybody laughs at it so they won't realize that this is actually what's going on.
[02:26:58.746 --> 02:27:12.075]  I know that some of the government agencies actually went and talked to Kubrick and said, how did you know about the de-scrambler codes for the nuclear launch orders to be sent to the bombers, the B-52s?
[02:27:12.135 --> 02:27:18.819]  I mean, he had so much internal information, a lot of it that wasn't made public at the time, but has since been made public.
[02:27:18.979 --> 02:27:29.966]  Right, exactly, because, you know, he was getting all the info from the RAND Corporation, from the people in the RAND Corporation, from Herman Kahn, who, you know, who had been one of the luminaries of the RAND Corporation during the 1950s.
[02:27:30.307 --> 02:27:32.108]  And they worked on a doomsday device?
[02:27:32.388 --> 02:27:33.089]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:27:33.289 --> 02:27:34.430]  Oh, yes!
[02:27:34.450 --> 02:27:40.334]  That was one of the main things of Kahn's presentations and of his book on thermonuclear war.
[02:27:40.614 --> 02:27:42.255]  I mean, I have that in my book, you know.
[02:27:42.375 --> 02:27:48.139]  He wanted to jacket them in cobalt and other things to create just deadly radiation.
[02:27:48.519 --> 02:27:52.140]  Well, Rand was also involved in the uses of the H-bomb.
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:59.443]  I mean, after all, I mean, look, the H-bomb, the A-bomb, the bomb, Rand is there from the beginning.
[02:28:00.483 --> 02:28:16.229]  The genesis of Rand is that it's supposed to be another Manhattan Project that developed the A-bomb, because it was set up by this general named Arnold and Frank Colbom, who was his assistant, and Curtis LeMay, who later became the chief of staff.
[02:28:19.353 --> 02:28:22.600]  Uh, and what they wanted to do is create a situation whereby
[02:28:24.605 --> 02:28:34.128]  You would have scientists and military working together in an environment that would be agreeable to the scientists, who then would be able to develop the kind of weapons that the military wanted, right?
[02:28:34.508 --> 02:28:42.430]  Obviously, the military then got in cahoots then with the military-industrial complex that those industrialists stood to make so much money out of what was being developed.
[02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:43.870]  That was right from the beginning.
[02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:51.492]  And like I said, the RAND Corporation did studies on the use of the H-bomb, but studies that were only, you know, declassified a few years ago.
[02:28:52.032 --> 02:28:53.714]  And there's a scene with one of the top generals
[02:29:09.130 --> 02:29:30.037]  Played by George C. Scott, where they know the nukes are now going to be dropped, the doomsday Russian device is going to detonate, and they say, we happen to have a report prepared for this exact eventuality by the Bland Corporation, not the RAND, the Bland, and then they open up, you know, basically the same report about, we've got a contingency, this nuclear war is going to be a good thing,
[02:29:30.837 --> 02:29:35.138]  And the RAND Corporation almost worships the bomb at their facilities, as you know, in California.
[02:29:35.518 --> 02:29:40.859]  They've got a big giant H-bomb sculpture of a mushroom cloud made up out of chain link.
[02:29:40.879 --> 02:29:48.520]  We're going to come back, take five final calls for Alex Ubeya, then I'm going to blitz through some final key news in this third hour.
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:49.040]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.961 --> 02:29:50.861]  We're on the march.

[02:31:58.953 --> 02:32:03.176]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.497 --> 02:32:04.097]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.417 --> 02:32:07.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:08.400]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.701 --> 02:32:13.244]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.584 --> 02:32:14.045]  It's true.
[02:32:14.325 --> 02:32:18.888]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.209 --> 02:32:19.749]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.029 --> 02:32:23.312]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.612 --> 02:32:27.315]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.515 --> 02:32:28.056]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.316 --> 02:32:30.678]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.078 --> 02:32:34.461]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.761 --> 02:32:34.962]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.542 --> 02:32:39.465]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.686 --> 02:32:44.450]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:44.730 --> 02:32:48.751]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:48.911 --> 02:32:50.452]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.692 --> 02:32:52.773]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:52.933 --> 02:32:55.534]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:55.554 --> 02:33:04.317]  Mr. President, there are one or two points I'd like to make, if I may.
[02:33:06.058 --> 02:33:06.678]  Go ahead, General.
[02:33:10.516 --> 02:33:16.800]  Our hopes for recalling the 843rd bombing are quickly being reduced to a very low order of probability.
[02:33:17.581 --> 02:33:17.801]  Two.
[02:33:19.082 --> 02:33:22.524]  In less than 15 minutes from now, the Ruskies will be making radar contact with the planes.
[02:33:23.405 --> 02:33:23.665]  Three.
[02:33:24.486 --> 02:33:28.628]  When they do, they are gonna go absolutely ape, and they're gonna strike back with everything they got.
[02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.709]  Four.
[02:33:30.690 --> 02:33:38.375]  If, prior to this time, we have done nothing further to suppress their retaliatory capabilities, we will suffer virtual annihilation.
[02:33:45.063 --> 02:33:56.169]  If, on the other hand, we were to immediately launch an all-out and coordinated attack on all their airfields and missile bases, we'd stand a damn good chance of catching them with their pants down!
[02:33:57.269 --> 02:33:59.370]  Hell, we got a fireball of missile superiority as it is!
[02:33:59.450 --> 02:34:04.893]  We could easily assign three missiles to every target and still have a very effective reserve force for any other contingency.
[02:34:05.493 --> 02:34:11.276]  That said, an unofficial study that we undertook of this eventuality indicated
[02:34:11.932 --> 02:34:15.473]  That we would destroy 90% of their nuclear capabilities.
[02:34:15.513 --> 02:34:24.275]  We would therefore prevail and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian casualties from the remaining force, which would be badly damaged and uncoordinated.
[02:34:25.235 --> 02:34:30.236]  General, it is the avowed policy of our country never to strike first with nuclear weapons.
[02:34:30.916 --> 02:34:34.557]  Well, Mr. President, I would say that General Ripper has already invalidated that policy.
[02:34:35.277 --> 02:34:39.098]  That was not an act of national policy and there are still alternatives left open to us.
[02:34:40.358 --> 02:34:40.818]  Mr. President,
[02:34:43.408 --> 02:34:48.112]  We are rapidly approaching a moment of truth both for ourselves as human beings and for the life of our nation.
[02:34:48.172 --> 02:34:49.693]  Now, truth is not always a pleasant thing.
[02:34:50.954 --> 02:34:59.500]  But it is necessary now to make a choice, to choose between two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless distinguishable post-war environments.
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:03.563]  One, where you got 20 million people killed, and the other where you got 150 million people killed.
[02:35:04.244 --> 02:35:06.205]  You're talking about mass murder, General, not war.
[02:35:07.756 --> 02:35:14.258]  Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mushed, but I do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed.
[02:35:14.298 --> 02:35:14.518]  Top!
[02:35:16.919 --> 02:35:21.680]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:24.061]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:35:25.421 --> 02:35:29.002]  Remember what came out even in the New York Times three and a half years ago?
[02:35:31.684 --> 02:35:37.148]  That the Pentagon now has a first strike where they preemptively invade countries.
[02:35:37.388 --> 02:35:38.429]  You saw that with Iraq.
[02:35:39.049 --> 02:35:42.952]  But that they want to hit Iran with hundreds of quote, many nukes.
[02:35:43.632 --> 02:35:49.396]  And they've had their PR firms going saying, well these aren't like your daddy's nukes, your grandpappy's nukes.
[02:35:50.016 --> 02:35:52.878]  We need to start preemptively striking people with nukes.
[02:35:53.319 --> 02:35:54.599]  Well, that's Curtis LeMay.
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:55.740]  That's Khan.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.142]  That's the Rand Corporation, isn't it Alex Abaya?
[02:35:58.342 --> 02:35:59.502]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:35:59.522 --> 02:36:02.963]  They were advocating this, advocating this time and again, time and again.
[02:36:02.983 --> 02:36:14.805]  I mean, look, you know, I mean, originally I always thought that, I never much admired Eisenhower, but the more I read about him, and the more I studied Rand, the more I realized what a bulwark he was.
[02:36:14.885 --> 02:36:18.406]  I mean, how he stood up against these people and said, there's no way I'm going to put up with this guy.
[02:36:18.506 --> 02:36:21.847]  And they thought Kennedy was going to be some sex addict that they could control.
[02:36:22.227 --> 02:36:23.507]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:36:23.887 --> 02:36:30.409]  And you know, much to their surprise, but you know, by late 1962 or early 63, he started saying, hey, hey, you know, hold on there, fellas.
[02:36:30.689 --> 02:36:32.169]  I'm not going to go along with your plans.
[02:36:33.130 --> 02:36:33.930]  And you know what happened to him.
[02:36:34.050 --> 02:36:50.414]  And right now at PrisonPlanet.TV, we're showing Google Street View, one of their little creations, of the front of the RAND Corporation there on the coastline by Los Angeles, with the giant sculpture of a mushroom cloud going off, made out of chain links.
[02:36:52.813 --> 02:36:53.073]  Yes.
[02:36:54.776 --> 02:37:01.164]  It's just amazing that they'd read your previous book and thought, hey, this guy's A-OK, and had no idea that you'd get into all their stuff and blow them wide open.
[02:37:01.985 --> 02:37:03.207]  I wasn't telling you too much, brother.
[02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:17.720]  All right, let's rampage through five or six calls, because I do need to get to some other key news here today and a very disturbing little conversation that I had with Joe Stroup of Media Matters yesterday before we end this hour.
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:19.381]  So please have your questions ready.
[02:37:19.401 --> 02:37:20.102]  I want to get to all of you.
[02:37:20.122 --> 02:37:22.324]  I love your calls, but quick question, quick comment.
[02:37:22.384 --> 02:37:25.146]  Ryan, Steve, Dan, Larry, Thomas, because I want to try to get to all of you.
[02:37:25.366 --> 02:37:27.268]  Quick response back from Alex Abea.
[02:37:28.289 --> 02:37:29.690]  Let's talk to Ryan in Illinois.
[02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:30.190]  You're on the air.
[02:37:30.956 --> 02:37:34.680]  Hi Alex and Alex, great book, great show.
[02:37:35.581 --> 02:37:39.165]  My quick question is about Herman Kahn and the Hudson Institute.
[02:37:40.306 --> 02:37:44.451]  It seems that they're, I can't tell whether they're good or bad, on one hand they're talking about
[02:37:45.828 --> 02:37:53.431]  Overpopulation, how it's a myth and that everything's going to be alright, and also they're demonizing Prozac use and things like that.
[02:37:54.552 --> 02:37:56.593]  So there's very mixed messages.
[02:37:56.653 --> 02:38:00.734]  I don't know what they're trying to do, if they're trying to gain our confidence, or just your thoughts on that.
[02:38:05.302 --> 02:38:08.763]  Herman Kahn broke the secret, because that's the whole thing.
[02:38:09.163 --> 02:38:23.689]  The Rand Corporation at the time, to this very day, they're technocrats, they think they're a cabal, they're like the high priests, they tell everybody what to do, and so therefore Kahn went out and he actually popularized all these things, right?
[02:38:24.049 --> 02:38:26.850]  And then he was forced to leave Rand.
[02:38:27.250 --> 02:38:27.490]  We're good.
[02:38:44.764 --> 02:38:45.144]  Yes, I did.
[02:38:45.584 --> 02:38:50.585]  And they have different scientists and different people in the think tanks who have even different views.
[02:38:50.645 --> 02:38:58.187]  They get, they test for all the idiot savants in specialized areas and then they let them operate just to get their data.
[02:38:58.207 --> 02:39:08.269]  So yeah, you'll have somebody in one of these groups who's saying psychotropics and drugs are destroying our country, but, and I've seen what you're talking about, but that's, but they'll use their material in another way.
[02:39:08.289 --> 02:39:08.989]  Do you understand that?
[02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:15.314]  Yeah, it's kind of like Glenn Beck, you know, he tells 90% of the truth and he, you know, just leads you on another path whatsoever.
[02:39:15.374 --> 02:39:15.915]  That's right.
[02:39:16.275 --> 02:39:16.796]  That's right.
[02:39:16.996 --> 02:39:17.756]  You got that straight.
[02:39:18.557 --> 02:39:19.798]  All right, Ryan, appreciate it.
[02:39:19.878 --> 02:39:21.459]  Steve in California, you're on the air.
[02:39:21.479 --> 02:39:22.921]  Hi, Alex.
[02:39:23.301 --> 02:39:23.561]  Hey, Mike.
[02:39:23.581 --> 02:39:24.242]  Hi, Alex and Alex.
[02:39:24.402 --> 02:39:24.602]  Hey.
[02:39:24.622 --> 02:39:25.142]  Thank you, guys.
[02:39:25.162 --> 02:39:28.865]  Hey, real quick, I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:39:29.146 --> 02:39:33.109]  I want to share something that I've actually lived through, and I've actually met with Aaron Russo.
[02:39:33.169 --> 02:39:34.190]  I'm trying to get my film out.
[02:39:34.210 --> 02:39:38.033]  I've been in a Patriot group, and I want to ask a question, too, for Alex.
[02:39:39.326 --> 02:39:42.749]  On Iron Mountain, if that really happened, was rain involved?
[02:39:42.789 --> 02:39:43.809]  No, it was not.
[02:39:44.070 --> 02:40:08.366]  However, what it did do, Iron Mountain, for those listeners that don't know about it, is this particular document that came out in the late 1960s, mid to late 60s, if I recall correctly, in which it was supposed to be like the guideline, like the plot, of a small group of people from the government that met every once in a while in order to, how to take over the government, and to cover the government and the world.
[02:40:09.246 --> 02:40:14.927]  No, that was acknowledged as a satire, but the sad truth about it is that a lot of the things that were mentioned were true.
[02:40:15.507 --> 02:40:17.788]  Only the way that it came out was false.
[02:40:17.828 --> 02:40:19.788]  Yeah, it's just like Dr. Strangelove.
[02:40:19.968 --> 02:40:20.488]  Exactly.
[02:40:21.628 --> 02:40:32.450]  Yeah, just to tie it in there, guys, on Lucid and the DARPA system, in these lists, you know, I've lived through a miscarriage of justice where my children have been taken from me.
[02:40:32.470 --> 02:40:33.391]  I've been kind of labeled.
[02:40:33.411 --> 02:40:35.511]  Someone said there's a flag by my name.
[02:40:36.411 --> 02:40:47.456]  And it seems to me that they are making lists and tying it in with, you know, Clinton and Carol Quigley, that these people really think that we're better off ruled by them.
[02:40:48.316 --> 02:40:50.037]  And the FEMA thing, it's all true.
[02:40:50.097 --> 02:40:53.298]  I mean, I've seen documents like the Marines in 29 Palms.
[02:40:53.898 --> 02:40:59.040]  Would you fire upon American people if they do not give up their guns when a 30-day amnesty period is given?
[02:40:59.081 --> 02:41:00.421]  No, no, that's on record, Steve.
[02:41:00.541 --> 02:41:01.101]  I've got to go.
[02:41:01.141 --> 02:41:02.142]  We're almost out of time.
[02:41:02.462 --> 02:41:04.743]  Any comments on the military being turned against the people?
[02:41:06.135 --> 02:41:06.395]  Alex.
[02:41:07.636 --> 02:41:08.436]  It would surprise me.
[02:41:08.836 --> 02:41:11.738]  It would surprise me because, you know, that's in the plans and that's what they got to do.
[02:41:11.758 --> 02:41:12.458]  That's what they got to do.
[02:41:12.478 --> 02:41:16.140]  The military is just following orders and these guys think, well, you know, we know best.
[02:41:17.581 --> 02:41:18.982]  Dan in Michigan.
[02:41:19.002 --> 02:41:20.422]  You're on the air with Alex Abeya.
[02:41:20.442 --> 02:41:26.626]  Dan, you want to talk?
[02:41:27.446 --> 02:41:29.987]  Yeah, I just had a question about John Nash.
[02:41:30.067 --> 02:41:31.108]  I wonder if he could
[02:41:31.673 --> 02:41:32.714]  Yeah, John Nash.
[02:41:33.194 --> 02:41:39.058]  John Nash was that brilliant mathematician and one of the creators of game theory.
[02:41:39.098 --> 02:41:42.340]  Although he wasn't as big as he was made out to be in the movie.
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:43.681]  Where was it?
[02:41:43.781 --> 02:41:45.382]  Brilliant... A Beautiful Mind.
[02:41:45.402 --> 02:41:46.303]  A Beautiful Mind, thank you.
[02:41:46.663 --> 02:41:48.344]  Right, he was in RAN for a couple of years.
[02:41:48.424 --> 02:41:53.307]  RAN at the time in the 1950s was like the center of game theory.
[02:41:53.348 --> 02:41:56.870]  Matter of fact, without RAN, probably game theory as we know it today would not exist.
[02:41:57.290 --> 02:42:03.574]  Because they thought that with game theory, they'd be able to figure out what the Soviet Union was going to do next.
[02:42:04.035 --> 02:42:06.496]  Because at the time, the Soviet Union was a closed society.
[02:42:06.796 --> 02:42:16.183]  Our spies in the Soviet Union were not getting much information, so they were trying to posit a way by which they could say, well, the Soviet Union is going to act this way, so therefore we should act that way.
[02:42:16.823 --> 02:42:20.826]  And so, you know, Nash was there for a couple of years, but, you know, he went in and out.
[02:42:21.106 --> 02:42:27.070]  And as mentioned in his biography, you know, the most, the crucial things
[02:42:27.090 --> 02:42:27.210]  Hello.
[02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:27.290]  Yes.
[02:42:27.310 --> 02:42:27.610]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:42:27.631 --> 02:42:29.532]  Mr. Bayer, I appreciate you for being around, hanging around so long.
[02:42:29.592 --> 02:42:31.274]  I've followed your work for quite a while.
[02:42:31.294 --> 02:42:31.554]  Thank you.
[02:42:31.574 --> 02:42:35.758]  The first, one of the first things I saw was
[02:42:51.004 --> 02:42:58.370]  You know, it was a book that I got about JFK when the Zapruder films came out and everything, and it talked about Montauk.
[02:42:58.850 --> 02:43:01.992]  And I thought, well, Montauk is, you know, in Martha's Vineyard.
[02:43:02.072 --> 02:43:04.114]  You know, well, that's where everybody's going to meet.
[02:43:04.494 --> 02:43:08.317]  Little did I know about Bohemian Grove and that sort of thing.
[02:43:09.338 --> 02:43:14.842]  And so I just wanted to say I appreciate, you know, everything that you've done over the years.
[02:43:15.863 --> 02:43:17.164]  Also, Mr. Jones, if
[02:43:18.402 --> 02:43:27.268]  If you wouldn't mind, I live on a farm also, and we lease out part of the land to a gentleman who pays the school taxes.
[02:43:27.968 --> 02:43:32.571]  And before I could get out there, he had already laid fallow this year.
[02:43:32.851 --> 02:43:35.573]  He came by and sprayed it completely with Roundup.
[02:43:35.593 --> 02:43:37.794]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Larry.
[02:43:37.834 --> 02:43:39.515]  That's a big problem.
[02:43:40.296 --> 02:43:42.837]  We've got to move here because we're almost out of time.
[02:43:43.618 --> 02:43:46.339]  Let's try to finish up with a quick question from Thomas in Arkansas.
[02:43:46.379 --> 02:43:47.200]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[02:43:48.018 --> 02:43:48.399]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:48.459 --> 02:43:51.623]  Thank you, Alex and Alex.
[02:43:51.683 --> 02:43:52.484]  Just a quick question.
[02:43:52.524 --> 02:43:53.446]  I haven't read the book.
[02:43:53.506 --> 02:43:56.009]  I plan to because I want to see what my brother's up to.
[02:43:56.069 --> 02:43:57.531]  He's an analyst with RAND.
[02:43:58.092 --> 02:44:02.158]  I wanted to know if you mentioned anything in there about the security clearances of the analysts.
[02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:05.500]  No, not directly.
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:11.642]  I know that everybody goes through security clearance in order to be able to be hired by them.
[02:44:11.662 --> 02:44:14.282]  I myself went through one.
[02:44:14.802 --> 02:44:25.224]  The thing is that I was helped by the fact that my brother at one point had worked for a place where he got a high level of clearance.
[02:44:25.844 --> 02:44:28.865]  But I don't specifically go into that, although I have heard
[02:44:28.865 --> 02:44:36.770]  I heard from analysts who have read this, that went to conferences and stuff like that, and they said, you know, they totally agree with what's in the book, and that there's nothing wrong with the book itself.
[02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:42.434]  Well, you were clearly let into one level of the security ring, the deepest anybody outside had ever been allowed to.
[02:44:42.574 --> 02:44:42.814]  Right.
[02:44:43.234 --> 02:44:44.996]  But we know it goes even a lot deeper than that.
[02:44:45.136 --> 02:44:45.536]  Absolutely.
[02:44:45.736 --> 02:44:46.837]  A great question, Thomas.
[02:44:46.857 --> 02:44:47.677]  Sorry we're out of time.
[02:44:48.018 --> 02:44:49.559]  Alex Abeya, great having you on.
[02:44:49.579 --> 02:44:50.219]  My pleasure.
[02:44:50.259 --> 02:44:54.342]  Look forward to having you in our film about the tea parties and the political manipulation.
[02:44:55.002 --> 02:44:57.484]  God bless you, and folks can find out more at alexabeya.com.
[02:44:59.722 --> 02:45:00.803]  There goes Alex Abea.
[02:45:00.843 --> 02:45:04.404]  I want to play this video that's a call to action dealing with the money bomb.
[02:45:04.664 --> 02:45:06.985]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:07.025 --> 02:45:08.746]  I want to ask you to help us get it out to everybody.
[02:45:09.106 --> 02:45:18.871]  Then I'm going to come back in the final segment and get into a really creepy phone call I got from George Soros' one of his little children, Media Matters.
[02:45:19.091 --> 02:45:19.691]  So here's the video.
[02:45:30.162 --> 02:45:32.505]  Hello, fellow lovers of liberty and freedom.
[02:45:33.426 --> 02:45:43.778]  We're going to be doing a special 27-hour live non-stop broadcast coming up on Thursday, October 14, 2010.
[02:45:46.181 --> 02:45:47.922]  It kicks off at 11 a.m.
[02:45:47.942 --> 02:45:53.964]  when my regularly scheduled multicast of radio and television takes place at Infowars.com.
[02:45:54.665 --> 02:46:00.087]  And we have got an incredible lineup of researchers scheduled for the show.
[02:46:00.127 --> 02:46:01.488]  We've got Gerald Cilente.
[02:46:02.088 --> 02:46:09.937]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Alan Watt, Katherine Austin Fitz, the list goes on and on.
[02:46:10.938 --> 02:46:19.969]  And I'm going to be on the air for more than 24 hours straight, taking your phone calls, interviewing guests during the 2010 money bomb.
[02:46:20.690 --> 02:46:21.430]  Three years ago,
[02:46:22.796 --> 02:46:27.839]  Grassroots supporters started the money bomb without my knowledge, and at first I kind of ignored it.
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:32.142]  But as it gained steam, I thought, well, I guess people want us to go to the next level.
[02:46:32.682 --> 02:46:38.166]  And it was that money that came in, that $300,000, that allowed us to move to these new offices.
[02:46:38.766 --> 02:46:42.509]  We used the second money bomb to expand the amount of equipment and employees we had.
[02:46:43.229 --> 02:46:44.391]  And here we are in 2010.
[02:46:45.812 --> 02:46:47.735]  I wasn't going to do a Money Bomb.
[02:46:47.815 --> 02:46:48.996]  People were like, well, why aren't you going to do it?
[02:46:49.016 --> 02:46:51.619]  You did one in the early summer of the last two years.
[02:46:51.639 --> 02:46:57.707]  And I was like, well, we know we're in a depression, and we just want folks to buy the books and videos and support our sponsors.
[02:46:57.747 --> 02:46:58.488]  That should pay for it.
[02:46:58.988 --> 02:47:06.072]  Well, because the economy is falling apart, even though our audience has more than tripled in the last 12 months, we do need to come to you and ask the question.
[02:47:06.612 --> 02:47:23.280]  If you believe in the type of information we cover, the guests we bring on, the platform for liberty that we provide, then please support us on October 14th, 2010, this coming Thursday, by going to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and donating.
[02:47:23.980 --> 02:47:25.921]  And tune in to the live
[02:47:27.222 --> 02:47:30.764]  Four hour plus transmission, 27 hours total.
[02:47:32.124 --> 02:47:35.526]  And even if you can't donate a dollar, that doesn't matter.
[02:47:35.806 --> 02:47:41.289]  Tell your friends and family to tune in to this historic 27 hour transmission.
[02:47:41.869 --> 02:47:52.074]  Posted below, we'll put a link to the tour I've given folks of the studios we were able to build with the last two money bombs and the new shell of the studio we completed.
[02:47:52.694 --> 02:48:00.061]  Now we need to put the equipment in, get the employees, the computers, you know, the air conditioning systems, all of that stuff that goes along with it.
[02:48:00.582 --> 02:48:02.023]  But the shell is now there.
[02:48:02.483 --> 02:48:05.847]  Because we realize that humanity is at a historic crossroads.
[02:48:06.687 --> 02:48:13.213]  And that InfoWars.com, my radio show, our films, the websites, really is at the tip of the spear.
[02:48:13.973 --> 02:48:21.535]  I mean, who can you point to who is having a bigger effect in waking people up to the true nature of this global tyranny we're facing?
[02:48:22.295 --> 02:48:25.515]  The good news is humanity is really waking up right now.
[02:48:25.615 --> 02:48:29.756]  The expansion of understanding is exponential.
[02:48:30.536 --> 02:48:36.398]  And so I'm not going to sit here idly by and just continue at the same level.
[02:48:36.538 --> 02:48:37.438]  I'm going to up
[02:48:38.271 --> 02:48:53.020]  our game against the globalist and I would ask you to join us in that historic mission and so a special 27-hour live transmission kicking off Thursday October 14th and running until 3 p.m.
[02:48:53.500 --> 02:48:55.882]  on the following Friday will be taking place
[02:48:56.502 --> 02:49:11.751]  I've never done anything like this, and I hope that you will join us, because we're going to be having live interviews, also special behind-the-scenes interviews, excerpts of films we never released, some of the interviews in their entirety that are in some of our upcoming films.
[02:49:12.311 --> 02:49:19.115]  This is going to be a really special event, and I hope you'll join us in this, because we won't save the world by this money bomb.
[02:49:19.155 --> 02:49:24.719]  We won't save the world by this 27-hour broadcast, but it will be a little piece
[02:49:26.061 --> 02:49:28.143]  of that overall victory against tyranny.
[02:49:28.583 --> 02:49:39.713]  Because it is the spirit of liberty, the spirit of 1776, the spirit of resistance that will bring down this corporate tyranny that is setting up world government openly.
[02:49:40.314 --> 02:49:41.335]  And I'll close with this.
[02:49:42.296 --> 02:49:51.224]  As the French philosopher more than 150 years ago, Victor Hugo, said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[02:49:52.332 --> 02:49:56.634]  We've done our best and we've had incredible success against tyranny.
[02:49:57.375 --> 02:50:01.597]  But at the end of the day, in the final equation, it is up to you.
[02:50:01.617 --> 02:50:17.306]  Has the idea of a rebirth of liberty and freedom and a renaissance for all to live their lives as they see fit and to be left alone by an all-powerful state, is that an idea whose time has come?
[02:50:18.362 --> 02:50:26.430]  As Patrick Henry said, I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:50:27.011 --> 02:50:30.515]  I'll see you live October 14th at 11 a.m.
[02:50:30.575 --> 02:50:35.460]  Central for the 27-hour marathon transmission against tyranny.
[02:50:59.850 --> 02:51:03.131]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:03.931 --> 02:51:08.173]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:08.433 --> 02:51:14.374]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:14.594 --> 02:51:16.735]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:17.035 --> 02:51:22.997]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:23.117 --> 02:51:26.458]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:26.538 --> 02:51:28.239]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:28.399 --> 02:51:30.440]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:35.241]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:35.461 --> 02:51:36.081]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:36.282 --> 02:51:40.323]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:40.563 --> 02:51:45.368]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:45.388 --> 02:51:46.530]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:47.250]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:51:59.301 --> 02:52:04.165]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:04.265 --> 02:52:05.045]  What have we got?
[02:52:05.265 --> 02:52:07.387]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:07.707 --> 02:52:08.468]  A republic.
[02:52:08.708 --> 02:52:11.290]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:11.370 --> 02:52:13.271]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:13.632 --> 02:52:15.533]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:15.653 --> 02:52:16.934]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:17.334 --> 02:52:18.455]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:18.655 --> 02:52:19.056]  Children?
[02:52:19.256 --> 02:52:20.036]  Our education?
[02:52:20.377 --> 02:52:21.017]  Our money?
[02:52:21.217 --> 02:52:24.860]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:25.220 --> 02:52:29.866]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.186 --> 02:52:31.027]  We have the facts.
[02:52:31.207 --> 02:52:32.328]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:32.368 --> 02:52:33.250]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:33.290 --> 02:52:34.111]  We have common law.
[02:52:34.171 --> 02:52:36.433]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:36.694 --> 02:52:40.478]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:40.578 --> 02:52:45.364]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:45.525 --> 02:52:46.906]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:47.026 --> 02:52:47.868]  Don't tread on me.

[02:53:54.451 --> 02:54:05.795]  We're almost out of time and I've got a bunch of news I want to hit.
[02:54:06.555 --> 02:54:19.620]  I'm waiting for the article to come out today or tomorrow before I really comment on this, but I got called by a chief investigative reporter for Media Matters, Joe Strupp,
[02:54:20.526 --> 02:54:45.908]  and he's written for some of the biggest publications in the country and it was a bizarre hour-long conversation because he was talking about a few months ago this highway shooter had a shootout with cops thank god nobody was killed uh... this byron williams who the court and the police are allowing to talk to media matters and he was supposedly a glenn beck fan and a fan of my show according to the guy's website and
[02:54:47.008 --> 02:54:51.252]  The guy kept saying, well, how do you respond to Glenn Beck calling for violence against the Tides Foundation?
[02:54:51.273 --> 02:54:52.854]  This guy was going to shoot up, he says.
[02:54:52.874 --> 02:54:54.416]  And I said, well, give me the quote.
[02:54:54.436 --> 02:54:55.277]  He says, it's in the story.
[02:54:56.098 --> 02:54:57.920]  So we read the whole story together over the phone.
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:54:59.681]  There was no calls to violence, nothing.
[02:55:00.458 --> 02:55:02.079]  He goes, OK, well, that's not in there, but still.
[02:55:02.419 --> 02:55:03.940]  And, you know, what do you say for yourself?
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:10.305]  And then he goes, what about Napolitano being discredited, you know, for believing in 9-11 truth on your show last week?
[02:55:10.845 --> 02:55:12.426]  I said, we didn't talk about 9-11 truth.
[02:55:12.466 --> 02:55:13.767]  He doesn't get into 9-11 truth.
[02:55:14.467 --> 02:55:15.608]  And he said, yeah, yeah, he does.
[02:55:15.628 --> 02:55:16.629]  Yeah, he does respond.
[02:55:17.189 --> 02:55:19.070]  And then I, it was weird.
[02:55:19.251 --> 02:55:22.072]  I mean, so, and I said, you're trying to drive a wedge.
[02:55:22.092 --> 02:55:27.416]  You're going to try to falsely quote me saying he was on my show about 9-11 truth when he was on about taxes and the economy.
[02:55:27.876 --> 02:55:29.738]  I mean, really bizarre.
[02:55:30.658 --> 02:55:32.619]  And maybe the guy just was out of it or whatever.
[02:55:32.979 --> 02:55:36.260]  He had this whole happy-go-lucky attitude, but it was a bizarre interview.
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:40.082]  I'm like, 20 times he had to say, and then he's like, did you record this?
[02:55:40.262 --> 02:55:40.922]  Did you record this?
[02:55:40.942 --> 02:55:42.162]  I was like, no, I didn't record it.
[02:55:43.583 --> 02:55:46.664]  Well, you're not really allowed to, you know, and it was just really strange, so.
[02:55:47.764 --> 02:55:51.086]  Then he was denying George Soros ever funded him through MoveOn.org.
[02:55:51.166 --> 02:55:51.326]  It was...
[02:55:52.532 --> 02:55:53.853]  Alright, I've spent too much time on that.
[02:55:53.873 --> 02:55:56.275]  We'll see what happens in the next few days.
[02:55:56.776 --> 02:55:58.777]  I've seen a sickening piece on Fox News.
[02:55:58.837 --> 02:56:01.740]  Parents of dying girl seven taunted by neighbors.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:04.622]  And they admit they put up Facebooks with her little face.
[02:56:05.123 --> 02:56:08.405]  She's dying of a degenerative brain disease like so many people are.
[02:56:09.406 --> 02:56:13.870]  And they made fun of her, and they've got a coffin out in front of their house and all this.
[02:56:13.950 --> 02:56:16.051]  And the government's going to use this to restrict free speech.
[02:56:16.071 --> 02:56:17.172]  They're calling it bullying.
[02:56:17.492 --> 02:56:19.114]  And you see the media always hyping it.
[02:56:19.154 --> 02:56:24.298]  That's how they're going to go after free speech, using case points like people protesting at funerals of dead troops.
[02:56:24.358 --> 02:56:28.621]  And who would make fun of a seven-year-old's cupcake dying?
[02:56:29.242 --> 02:56:30.242]  I got a six-year-old daughter.
[02:56:30.282 --> 02:56:31.583]  It makes my blood boil, man.
[02:56:32.324 --> 02:56:33.506]  But that's the sick culture.
[02:56:34.027 --> 02:56:40.457]  And it showed the people at the house that have been taunting her, and they were both wearing like death culture outfits, going, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:56:40.477 --> 02:56:44.163]  I mean, it's just, oh man, this country's so screwed up.
[02:56:45.993 --> 02:56:49.315]  School settles laptop spying case to protect taxpayers.
[02:56:50.215 --> 02:56:55.517]  This is where they took tens of thousands of images of children disrobing in their homes off the government-issued laptops.
[02:56:55.938 --> 02:56:57.638]  How many years ago did I tell you that was going on?
[02:56:57.678 --> 02:57:05.822]  Now it's admitted and the government says they're allowed to, but they're still going to settle to protect taxpayers from these evil kids that didn't like Big Brother watching Winston Smith.
[02:57:06.182 --> 02:57:07.243]  Here's some more bad news.
[02:57:07.283 --> 02:57:08.243]  Christian Science Monitor.
[02:57:08.503 --> 02:57:09.144]  Supreme Court
[02:57:09.944 --> 02:57:19.591]  Declines Bush bumper sticker case where they at town hall meetings they wouldn't allow people in even though they were supposedly open who had any type of anti-Bush sticker or even pro-Democrat stickers in.
[02:57:19.891 --> 02:57:21.472]  Supreme Court says that's great in America.
[02:57:21.753 --> 02:57:25.175]  Yeah, you're banned from going to public events if the government feels like it.
[02:57:25.195 --> 02:57:25.976]  That's just the way it is.
[02:57:26.756 --> 02:57:28.818]  Government prepares to seize private pensions.
[02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:33.704]  That's the Google search term today, dealing with the announcements they plan to take over 401ks and tax them.
[02:57:34.665 --> 02:57:38.689]  So that's up on PrisonPlanet.com, Top Story, also on InfoWars.com.
[02:57:38.949 --> 02:57:39.910]  Please search the term.
[02:57:40.751 --> 02:57:42.112]  Seize private pensions.
[02:57:42.233 --> 02:57:43.934]  It should become the number one term in the next hour.
[02:57:43.954 --> 02:57:45.055]  It usually takes about three hours.
[02:57:45.076 --> 02:57:46.437]  In fact, search that term.
[02:57:46.577 --> 02:57:47.939]  Go to Google Trends the next minute.
[02:57:47.979 --> 02:57:48.419]  Let's see if...
[02:57:49.827 --> 02:57:52.270]  Let's see if it's already number one, or it should be number one in the next 30 minutes.
[02:57:52.510 --> 02:58:02.360]  Keep searching three words, seize private pensions, and we'll get a lot of intel out to people when they look up this particular story, by it being the number one search term.
[02:58:02.621 --> 02:58:04.502]  Powerful tool in our Infowar arsenal.
[02:58:05.484 --> 02:58:10.769]  Up at GCNlive.com, they've got the Ron Paul speech of the Tea Party uncensored at the Neocon Censored.
[02:58:11.790 --> 02:58:14.051]  Obama has lost almost half of his former supporters.
[02:58:14.171 --> 02:58:16.533]  Steve Watson, that's also up at GCNLive.com.
[02:58:16.613 --> 02:58:17.193]  Key article.
[02:58:17.213 --> 02:58:21.236]  Sarah Palin, the next teleprompter reader in the White House, that's at GCNLive.com.
[02:58:21.576 --> 02:58:22.917]  Another big article out of The Age.
[02:58:23.297 --> 02:58:25.098]  Opium crop grows near troop base.
[02:58:25.538 --> 02:58:29.540]  Another article about how the troops are basically protecting the opium fields, whitewashing it.
[02:58:30.341 --> 02:58:31.722]  But again, remember that search term.
[02:58:31.762 --> 02:58:33.262]  Please put it in Google over and over again.
[02:58:33.303 --> 02:58:34.563]  We'll kick their hind ends again.
[02:58:34.923 --> 02:58:37.025]  Seize private pensions are the three words to search.
[02:58:37.285 --> 02:58:38.265]  Great job, Cruz.
[02:58:38.285 --> 02:58:39.046]  See you back live tomorrow.

[02:58:50.228 --> 02:58:52.830]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:53.230 --> 02:58:58.193]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:58.554 --> 02:59:00.315]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:00.615 --> 02:59:05.439]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:05.619 --> 02:59:06.580]  How much do you want?
[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:07.540]  When do you want it?
