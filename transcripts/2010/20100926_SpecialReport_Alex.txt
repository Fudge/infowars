[00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.861]  It's August 31st, 2010.
[00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:13.725]  Three days from now, Machete is going to premiere in theaters across North America.
[00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:25.877]  Going back about three months ago, Hispanic members of Robert Rodriguez's film crew here in Austin, Texas contacted me and said they were really concerned about the film's message and that it was very, very divisive.
[00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.189]  And then it would reflect badly on Hispanics, not just create racial division.
[00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.991]  Then I got a copy of the script, the script that they used for the film.
[00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:48.317]  And it is a race war that bills white people as the devil, and Mr. Trejo, the star, Machete, as a folk hero who they then pray and worship at the end of the film.
[00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:54.801]  And it's got gringos out sacrificing, you know, crucifying Catholic priests, killing Hispanic children.
[00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:55.902]  It's over the top.
[00:00:55.942 --> 00:00:58.544]  It's like a Hispanic version of Birth of the Nation.
[00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:01.186]  I mean, this is really dangerous stuff.
[00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:15.055]  And then Rodriguez told Ain't It Cool News that, okay, I had too much tequila and I am going to cut some stuff out of the film.
[00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:16.236]  It could cause some problems.
[00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:27.211]  And I thought, wow, that was my job, was just simply to point out to him that people on his own crew were concerned, and that he should think about what he's doing, because this could cause racial conflict.
[00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:30.733]  I'm all for his First Amendment, but I have my First Amendment right to criticize it.
[00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:34.235]  And I said, let's wait and see what comes out when the film's released.
[00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:41.479]  Well, then I happen to be in a hamburger place with my kids Saturday, and I see the front page of The Statesman.
[00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.341]  Dealing with the film Machete.
[00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:47.863]  Commission must decide if Machete qualifies for funds.
[00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:51.546]  And they've got yours truly Alex Jones quoted in here.
[00:01:52.187 --> 00:01:56.870]  And the producer of the film is in the newspaper saying that we made it up that we have the script.
[00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:02.074]  Really we made up the Arizona trailer with all those big stars saying those things.
[00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:04.276]  We made up that we got the script.
[00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:10.781]  We made it up that Robert Rodriguez told Any Cool News that he did cut stuff out because it was racially incendiary.
[00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:30.974]  Now I don't know what film is being released on Friday, but I am concerned about the fact that it's going to hype people up to go out and commit acts of violence with all the stuff going on in Arizona.
[00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:37.116]  So we're going to find out this weekend whether or not Rodriguez has put out his race war film.
[00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:44.219]  And we're going to find out if this guy is a total opportunist because what this does is it plays on fears of immigrants.
[00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:56.104]  It tries to export America phobia that does go on in Mexico to the rest of Latin America all over Central and South America and on the island of Puerto Rico.
[00:02:56.445 --> 00:03:05.749]  They are putting up these big posters with an image of a bloody machete in a hand dripping with blood saying everyone with machete.
[00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:08.459]  Like it's a political uprising.
[00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:16.368]  And if you know Central and South America and Mexico's history, the machete is the symbol of the peasant uprising because they've been disarmed.
[00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:19.792]  They're not allowed to own guns, so they use their farm implements.
[00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:25.118]  The machete is kind of like the pitchfork in European lore because they were disarmed.
[00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:32.741]  And so here's Rodriguez with a worldwide promotion of this in the streets of Latin American cities with an image of a blood dripping machete.
[00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:42.105]  And then when you go see the film, at least from what the script says, it's all about evil gringos that must die because they're oppressing the Raza or the race.
[00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:55.955]  And it's also come out that the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others have given billions of dollars total to this liberation theology at the universities, not just here in the United States, but all over the world.
[00:03:56.376 --> 00:04:00.539]  So the system wants Hispanics, whites, and blacks to beat each other's throats.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.083]  And they don't want Hispanics to feel like they're Americans and become pro-Second Amendment.
[00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:07.084]  No, it's got to be a machete.
[00:04:07.124 --> 00:04:09.046]  Do you get the anti-gun message here?
[00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:17.112]  In so many horror movies and films the people are always preyed upon by the criminals and the zombies because they don't have guns.
[00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:20.574]  Hollywood will not show that image of people with guns defending themselves.
[00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:26.639]  So we've got Robert Rodriguez blurring the lines between politics and his race war film.
[00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:35.601]  And then having his surrogates, the producer, in the statesman saying, there's none of this in the script, none of this is going on, this is crazy.
[00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:45.303]  When his own people contacted me, and I have the script, and we have the Arizona trailer, and Rodriguez is out there saying, yeah, I cut this stuff out, it goes a little too far.
[00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:47.644]  So I'm seeing a lot of deception.
[00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.290]  From their camp.
[00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.533]  And for their sake, I hope they have cut the really hardcore race war stuff out.
[00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:59.878]  Because if that actually showed in theaters around the country, I'd say 99% chance you're going to get some stabbings and some killings.
[00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:01.339]  My final point is this.
[00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:04.882]  I've really been researching Mexico in depth for more than 15 years.
[00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:09.486]  Reading what anthropologists, sociologists say from Mexico and the United States.
[00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:23.436]  And just over the weekend, I talked to a lot of my Hispanic friends, some of which actually grew up in Mexico, and they said, Alex, we know that the big foundations are teaching that the United States belongs to Mexico to create division.
[00:05:23.996 --> 00:05:25.377]  We understand what's going on.
[00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:31.038]  And they said, immigrants like the 72 that were just murdered right over the Texas border in Mexico,
[00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:47.030]  come up from Latin America and are held by Los Zetas and the Mexican Mafia and men, women and children are gutted and killed and in many cases raped first as part of an act of terror against these people and the rich
[00:05:47.990 --> 00:06:05.580]  Mexicans in the United States, they're just like poverty pimps, just like Obama, using racial politics to exploit and to basically fire up Hispanics to kind of buy into this whole narco-terrorist El Jefe worldview.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:22.911]  And that it is really a lot of Hispanic Americans who are feeding and using the immigrant community and that's why they're teamed up with the big Fortune 100 companies who also want cheap labor and to allow Mexico to export its revolution to the United States.
[00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:34.343]  And so it's just sickening elitism, the same way Mexico has used anti-Americanism as a distraction from its own internal problems for the last hundred years.
[00:06:34.664 --> 00:06:37.227]  This is now just an exporting of that to the United States.
[00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:40.050]  And I've seen in the news countless cases of mayors,
[00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.813]  And others who are Hispanic who it turns out are coyotes who have Hispanic immigrants as slaves.
[00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:48.394]  They bring them over here.
[00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:50.095]  They hold their families in Mexico.
[00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:53.117]  They make them do drug runs for them over and over again.
[00:06:53.717 --> 00:07:08.224]  And so really we have to realize that especially Central and South American immigrants coming up through Mexico are completely abused and are being used by the corrupt El Jefe types that run Mexico and now much of the Southwest.
[00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:08.865]  And I
[00:07:09.525 --> 00:07:11.406]  Guess that, you know, that's who he's rich and powerful.
[00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.047]  He's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:17.830]  That's who he hangs out with is the Carlos Slim types that dominate Mexico.
[00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:24.275]  And it looks like Robert Rodriguez is really a cold-blooded guy exploiting a lot of people and creating racial division in the process.
[00:07:24.315 --> 00:07:25.876]  But we'll see what film...
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.001]  He releases, but this isn't a joke.
[00:07:29.842 --> 00:07:31.483]  Mexico has fully collapsed.
[00:07:31.883 --> 00:07:35.086]  Every week, mayors are taken in front of their families and murdered.
[00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:38.508]  In some cases, they're raped first as an act of dominance.
[00:07:38.948 --> 00:07:43.912]  Immigrants, by the hundreds every week, are tortured and murdered and have money extorted out of them.
[00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.793]  And you never hear La Raza or Mecha.
[00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:50.240]  Or all these big race groups talking about that.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.741]  They want to distract Hispanics with boogeymen and the minute men who've never killed any immigrants.
[00:07:56.422 --> 00:07:57.562]  But in this movie, do!
[00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:07.525]  They'll give them that myth of who's killing them, when really who's killing them is the CIA-funded Los Zetas and the Mexican Mafia and the rest of them that are killing U.S.
[00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:09.486]  Embassy staff, kidnapping citizens.
[00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:12.427]  Our police are being paid off by them rolling over.
[00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:16.488]  And Robert Rodriguez just gets to glorify it and be the big king up there.
[00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:28.510]  And, you know, create all this racial division and have movie posters put up in Puerto Rico and everywhere else, you know, saying everybody get with machete with a symbol of Latin American revolution dripping with blood.
[00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.131]  And meanwhile, the big banks are funding the whole thing, because after the U.S.
[00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:35.331]  falls, we'll all be like Mexico or Guatemala, nowhere to run.
[00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:38.232]  And that's just their plan, where we're all killing each other.
[00:08:38.572 --> 00:08:44.193]  I don't know if Rodriguez has played into this PSYOP and is being used, or whether he's really a cold-blooded person.
[00:08:45.253 --> 00:08:51.616]  But I've seen a lot of doublespeak out of him and his crew, and I just hope that they have thought about what they're releasing.
[00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:55.658]  I mean, I know supposedly in the script that Machetes fled to the U.S.
[00:08:55.678 --> 00:08:57.399]  because of drug cartels come after him.
[00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:01.881]  But then he finds the ultimate evil is the gringos.
[00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:09.524]  The good news is Hispanics worldwide are sophisticated and intelligent, and they have discovered that the major foundations
[00:09:10.024 --> 00:09:23.534]  And we're going to stand together against the big central banks, against the drug traffickers, against this entire global crime syndicate that's getting rich off of the blood, sweat, and tears of immigrants and other people.
[00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:32.521]  And we're going to decriminalize drugs and take away your main funding mechanism that has empowered this criminal takeover of society.
[00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:39.674]  Rodriguez, you decided to go forward with this Mexican exploitation film with a radical revolutionary edge.
[00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:43.316]  And when people freaked out about it, you pulled it back and denied it even existed.
[00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:49.700]  But now we know you've got posters going up all over Latin America with bloodstained hands with a bloody knife.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:10:00.005]  And let's just hope that what you're invoking, whether consciously or unconsciously, doesn't come true because you will have literal blood on your hands and you will be liable.
[00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:02.166]  But maybe that's the type of fame you're looking for.
[00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:07.974]  We're good to go.
