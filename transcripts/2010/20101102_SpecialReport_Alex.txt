[00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:34.811]  The worst thing that I've ever seen for no common sense in the airport, in light of our new additional security, is that while I was governor, seated governor in the state of Minnesota, I had to fly to Los Angeles.
[00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:40.913]  I was pulled out and totally, you know, searched with the wand and all that.
[00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:47.498]  And while the young man was doing it, I asked him, I said, well, when does common sense enter into this?
[00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:49.319]  And he said to me, well, what do you mean, sir?
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.143]  I said, well, when's the last time a seated governor attempted to hijack a plane?
[00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:56.545]  And he had a great answer.
[00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:59.127]  He said, well, we can't make exceptions for anyone.
[00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.208]  And I said, that's fine.
[00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:04.111]  But I said, again, I asked you, when does common sense enter into this?
[00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:05.132]  And he said, well, what now?
[00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.955]  And I pointed because I had two bodyguards who are state troopers
[00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:14.776]  Secret Service train and of course they go through a different thing because they're going to carry weapons.
[00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:19.217]  And I pointed to these two guys in suits leaning against the wall waiting for me.
[00:01:19.697 --> 00:01:22.358]  And I said, you see the two guys over there wearing the suits?
[00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:23.138]  And he goes, yes.
[00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:27.279]  I said, well those are my bodyguards and they're getting on the plane with me.
[00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.460]  They're both armed with nine millimeters right now.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.380]  I said, when we get on this plane, I'm the boss.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.801]  I simply have to demand their weapon and they have to give it to me.
[00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.984]  So I said again, where is common sense here?
[00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:46.272]  I'm boarding the plane with two armed men carrying 9mm and I'm being searched?
[00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.617]  And I'm being wanted to see if I'm dangerous?
[00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:52.000]  How silly can they get?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.702]  Well, it's clear that the whole...
[00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:55.887]  We're good to go.
[00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:13.073]  Yeah.
[00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.698]  And, you know, like I said, you know, I just found it.
[00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:19.982]  And then, ironically, I was going to California.
[00:02:20.763 --> 00:02:22.485]  Here's how California treated me.
[00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.609]  The plane stopped before it even got up to the thing.
[00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.731]  They took me off the plane at that point.
[00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:32.096]  I was loaded into a California Highway Patrol car and off to do our business.
[00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:36.458]  When we got done, they didn't even take me to the airport.
[00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:55.765]  They drove me right out onto the tarmac to the plane I was going to, stopped right below the plane, and I boarded the plane right there, before anybody even inside, and I never even went through any type of security in California, because I was the governor of Minnesota, and I assume California figured I wasn't exactly a... Al Qaeda.
[00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:57.006]  Al Qaeda terrorist.
[00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:58.287]  What a great story.
[00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:00.328]  A true story, yeah, absolutely true.
[00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:00.989]  Every word of it.
[00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:06.633]  That I was totally searched in Minneapolis, and I was the Minnesota governor at the time it happened.
[00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:08.615]  Well, a prophet's not known in his own country.
[00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:13.738]  Hey, Jesse, that was pretty wild today, hanging out with Willie, wasn't it?
[00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:14.399]  Yeah, a lot of fun.
[00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:15.220]  A lot of fun.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.506]  Willie's a very bright guy, and he knows the issues that concern him and that he pays attention to, and he's pretty well read on them.
[00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.280]  He told me about Waylon Jennings and he back in like the 70s going looking at a piece of property and he bought it.
[00:03:31.164 --> 00:03:33.388]  It's neat how it's up on that hill, all those hills all around it.
[00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:36.746]  Well, like I said to him, Willie, how do you leave?
[00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:40.268]  And he said, it's tough, but it's his love of music.
[00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:41.949]  He loves to play music.
[00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:43.430]  He loves to do shows.
[00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.451]  Obviously, he does hundreds of them a year.
[00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:46.832]  Willie don't need to.
[00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.474]  It isn't like Willie needs the money or anything like that.
[00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:54.256]  So it's his love of music that does it.
[00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:59.218]  Because anyone else that had a beautiful place like he's got, you'd be hard pressed to ever leave it.
[00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.560]  I know I would be.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.401]  He does over 200 shows a year.
[00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:03.701]  I know.
[00:04:22.244 --> 00:04:24.805]  Willie, when did you build this place, this whole little town?
[00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.286]  I did a movie called Red-Headed Stranger.
[00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:29.226]  Oh yeah?
[00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:31.147]  We built the town for that movie.
[00:04:31.207 --> 00:04:32.367]  Come check out the video.
[00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.490]  He played all games.
[00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.792]  Oh, there he is.
[00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:47.872]  Red-Headed Stranger.
[00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:49.153]  Yeah.
[00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:53.536]  Since then, we've done quite a few movies out here.
[00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:03.445]  So, Willie, what do you mainly do when you're not touring?
[00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:05.967]  Nothing.
[00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:07.969]  Resting.
[00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:10.030]  No, I know, that sounds good.
[00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.234]  That's what I do, kicking back and taking it easy.
[00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:17.137]  I've got a horse, but I try not to bother him too much.
[00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:21.554]  Got a golf course, but you know, I go over there occasionally.
[00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.374]  I got a lot of options, you know.
[00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:23.734]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:23.754 --> 00:05:27.495]  I don't have anything that I'm saying, well, when I get off I'm going to do this.
[00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:27.955]  Sure.
[00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:29.976]  When I get off I'm going to not do anything.
[00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.296]  This is a little piece of heaven.
[00:05:32.316 --> 00:05:33.997]  It's nice.
[00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.057]  I enjoy hanging out here.
[00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:38.598]  Oh look, there's John Wayne.
[00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.600]  They filmed that down by San Antonio, didn't they?
[00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:48.126]  What's that now?
[00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:48.386]  Alma.
[00:05:48.586 --> 00:05:48.846]  Alma.
[00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:49.426]  Oh, yeah.
[00:05:51.548 --> 00:05:53.429]  I saw the Alma the last time I was in San Antonio.
[00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:54.469]  Yeah.
[00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.711]  That's a good tale.
[00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.432]  In fact, I stayed right at the hotel, right across the street.
[00:05:59.573 --> 00:06:06.317]  They had me right across the street, so I got up in the morning and walked over there, and the only thing you gotta remember to do is take your hat off when you walk in.
[00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.238]  There's a hotel over there that's, uh... As soon as you're picked, it's a big job.
[00:06:09.258 --> 00:06:13.441]  You just make sure you remove your hat when you walk in, because it's a... It's a sacred place.
[00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:14.762]  It's a sacred place now.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.881]  There's a hotel across the street where the Rough Riders met.
[00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:19.021]  Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.241]  Yeah, that's the hotel I stayed at.
[00:06:20.261 --> 00:06:21.021]  That's a nice hotel.
[00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.382]  It's like the hotel you flew me to.
[00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:26.683]  Yes, it's the old, traditional... Yeah, he's in the dress club.
[00:06:27.823 --> 00:06:29.483]  Yeah, then he checks me in the day.
[00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.824]  Well, he tells me it's haunted.
[00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:32.024]  I said, that's all I need.
[00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:33.604]  What, they're going to keep me up all night?
[00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:38.986]  Couldn't be haunted that bad, because I'll tell you, I slept on nine... Hey, look, they just say it's haunted there.
[00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:40.406]  I don't know if it's true.
[00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:41.906]  Well, I think LBJ walks the halls.
[00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:43.667]  That's what they say on other people.
[00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:45.662]  That LBJ walks the halls?
[00:06:45.682 --> 00:06:47.104]  No, I just made that up.
[00:06:47.424 --> 00:06:50.627]  No, actually, they say a bunch of people.
[00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:51.368]  I wish he would.
[00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:52.930]  I'd have a few questions for him.
[00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.555]  I'd like to run into him and ask him a couple of things that have been on my mind for a few years.
[00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:05.783]  Speaking of JFK, I mean, the E. Howard Hunt, I got the deathbed confession video, not just the audio.
[00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:08.145]  Rolling Stone barbed it last year.
[00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:16.610]  But an upcoming film, we just released it on the web for free for everybody to see it, but an upcoming film, we had more of the interview, and it's E. Howard Hunt, right before he died, you know.
[00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:17.991]  His son, St.
[00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:22.153]  John Hunt, brought it to me, but you know, he was the famous plumber, too, for Nixon.
[00:07:22.473 --> 00:07:25.975]  He was the CIA section chief, but no, he admitted and named it.
[00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:28.177]  Of course, he got picked up as one of the tramps that day.
[00:07:29.317 --> 00:07:33.099]  People, you know, people saw the spitting image, and he said, yeah, I know that.
[00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:34.380]  Basically, we killed Kennedy.
[00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.577]  We're good to go.
[00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:55.816]  He did him that bastard.
[00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:56.516]  I asked about it.
[00:07:56.596 --> 00:08:01.617]  No, and then I found out later that he had done a deathbed confession to his son.
[00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:05.258]  But when I first saw him, he had died a bastard.
[00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:07.318]  He took it all to the grave with him.
[00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:08.439]  Everything he knows.
[00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:21.481]  Because, uh, one of the interesting stories I heard about his son is that initially, Hunt, when Kennedy was killed, they asked him what, uh, what, uh, where he was.
[00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:32.481]  And Hunt had given the story that that day, he and his wife had gone out and bought Chinese and that they came home and they were cooking Chinese dinner for all the kids, right?
[00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:34.182]  And his son says he was gone then.
[00:08:34.342 --> 00:08:36.043]  Well, no, his son didn't even ask.
[00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:38.865]  His son said, my father never cooked.
[00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:46.509]  He said, in my entire life of growing up, I don't remember my father ever coming home and making dinner with my mom.
[00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:47.269]  That wasn't him.
[00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:49.190]  He was a CIA operative.
[00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.691]  He didn't make dinner at home.
[00:08:51.514 --> 00:08:55.697]  And so that's when the son apparently at first thought, wait a minute, what's going on here?
[00:08:55.757 --> 00:08:59.819]  And the story added that he was walking in a campus in California.
[00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:00.620]  Yeah.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.321]  And he saw a photo of the three tramps.
[00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:03.782]  His dad.
[00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:06.263]  And he looked at it and said, that's my father.
[00:09:06.723 --> 00:09:10.185]  His son tried to get it published, tried to get it to the media, they wouldn't take it.
[00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:13.607]  So he called me last year, and he said, do you want this footage?
[00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:18.190]  He'd already, because he'd been a listener, he'd already brought it to the media.
[00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.392]  Here's my dad, I wasn't even asking for money.
[00:09:21.724 --> 00:09:23.965]  He gave it to me, and I said, well, let me pay for this.
[00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:25.106]  He said, no, I don't want any money.
[00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:26.827]  Just get it out.
[00:09:27.447 --> 00:09:28.508]  And so we went ahead and put it out.
[00:09:28.528 --> 00:09:31.109]  But the point is, you know, for free on the internet.
[00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.232]  But I mean, his son didn't know what to do with that.
[00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:36.593]  He said, well, all you can do is put it out.
[00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:40.715]  And months and months have happened, and we released even more of it last week.
[00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:41.716]  Not one publication.
[00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:45.298]  I mean, it's his father on video admitting how they killed him and everything.
[00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:48.900]  I mean, this is the former CIA section chief.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.600]  That's a big deal.
[00:09:51.854 --> 00:09:54.977]  And let me tell you, I didn't like having that tape on me until we got it on the internet.
[00:09:55.037 --> 00:09:56.138]  That's dangerous to have that.
[00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.219]  Really?
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.540]  Oh, hell yeah.
[00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:01.663]  But the point is, they broke in St.
[00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:03.305]  John Hunt's house, you know, his son.
[00:10:03.925 --> 00:10:07.288]  They tore everything up, you know, to bits, stole papers.
[00:10:07.989 --> 00:10:11.692]  And then he lives in Northern California, the car came up to him and started bumping, you know, trying to run him off the road.
[00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.194]  The kid?
[00:10:13.454 --> 00:10:13.894]  The son?
[00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:15.596]  Yeah, and that's why he figured out
[00:10:17.093 --> 00:10:22.118]  Well, he actually called me to come on the radio, and I said, listen, no wonder they're breaking in your house trying to kill you.
[00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:23.339]  I said, look, just put it on the internet.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.621]  He said, well, I don't even really know how to do that.
[00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.704]  And I said, well, get it on the internet.
[00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:30.987]  And then he just said, well, I'll just, you know, give you the tape.
[00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:33.069]  And so we put it on the web.
[00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:34.510]  But, I mean, of course, he was in danger.
[00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:37.313]  You know why they give him no credibility, don't you?
[00:10:38.474 --> 00:10:38.815]  What, St.
[00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:39.195]  John Hunt?
[00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:41.699]  Oh, because he had some little drug condition or something?
[00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:41.899]  No, no.
[00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:43.581]  He was a former drug addict.
[00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:47.583]  And so because he was that, apparently, now he's a college graduate and takes care of handicaps.
[00:10:47.623 --> 00:10:49.925]  But the point is, what should that have to do with anything?
[00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:50.685]  Well, exactly.
[00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:51.446]  It's his father.
[00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:52.586]  It's video of his father.
[00:10:52.626 --> 00:10:53.447]  That's irrelevant.
[00:10:53.547 --> 00:10:55.388]  If the kid had a drug problem, so what?
[00:10:55.849 --> 00:11:00.972]  It doesn't... Like, I always love to use the term, how come all prostitutes have bad vision?
[00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:11.315]  Yeah, because if you bring a prostitute in as a witness, you can't believe her because obviously all prostitutes can't see.
[00:11:13.055 --> 00:11:16.617]  I mean, what the hell has their job got to do with what they do with what they saw?
[00:11:18.058 --> 00:11:22.260]  So it's always kind of a laugh to understand, yes, all prostitutes have bad vision.
[00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.801]  Willie, tell us the name of this town.
[00:11:24.402 --> 00:11:25.182]  Luck, Texas.
[00:11:25.642 --> 00:11:26.403]  Luck, Texas.
[00:11:27.283 --> 00:11:28.984]  You're either in luck or you're out of luck.
[00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:29.544]  Out of luck.
[00:11:29.884 --> 00:11:30.565]  One or the other.
[00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:46.483]  Yeah, I first got introduced, I'm not an early Willie guy because I was a heavy rock and roller as a kid, but I'll always remember when I first got into wrestling, there was always, there's a lot of Texans in wrestling and all that that you'd meet.
[00:11:47.082 --> 00:12:13.327]  I'll never forget when Waylon's album, Luke and Buck Texas, came out, because we'd all ride together, usually, and the guys that were the southern wrestlers all had Luke and Buck Texas, and there was Waylon and Willie and the boys, and that was the first I ever really knew of you, because I wasn't a country guy, I was a Rolling Stone, Beatles type, you know, that was when I grew up up north, but I was a member of Luke and Buck Texas, with Waylon and
[00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.288]  And then I went home and told my wife, guess what?
[00:12:16.308 --> 00:12:19.070]  And I even met Jerry Jeff, who sings about the trains.
[00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:22.213]  Because Jerry Jeff Walker was here last time I was here.
[00:12:22.813 --> 00:12:28.058]  And because of Jerry Jeff's train songs, was the lyrics in there.
[00:12:28.378 --> 00:12:31.821]  But I always remember that song real well, because we'd all be on the road together.
[00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:35.964]  They'd always throw a whale on the stake, and we'd be driving down the road together.
[00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:38.926]  Willie, that's an amazing painting!
[00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:42.009]  It's you and buildings, and it looks like a fire!
[00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:47.014]  That's the Hill County Courthouse in Hillsboro, Texas.
[00:12:51.677 --> 00:12:56.100]  It burned down, and so we did a benefit up there to build it back.
[00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:03.225]  And after we got it built back, we went back and did another benefit to show the people that it was back.
[00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:05.126]  Willie, how long has it been since you cut your hair?
[00:13:05.146 --> 00:13:08.309]  I don't remember.
[00:13:08.349 --> 00:13:08.669]  Just FYI.
[00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:14.539]  You don't remember the last time?
[00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:15.480]  Really?
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.440]  That's hilarious.
[00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:18.101]  Maybe I'll catch you someday.
[00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:20.603]  I've been at it ever since I got out of the office.
[00:13:20.623 --> 00:13:23.585]  They wanted me to shave my head again to do all this stuff and I refused.
[00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:27.968]  I only did it because to shave your head you gotta be in the right frame of mind to do it.
[00:13:28.128 --> 00:13:29.829]  You gotta really be tardy your hair.
[00:13:29.989 --> 00:13:32.811]  Well, and you gotta be in the right frame of mind.
[00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:37.955]  Even a guy like me that's bald, I still, and I fight with people over this.
[00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:41.037]  Do you know who the most discriminated people in America are?
[00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:44.543]  Bald men who have lost their hair.
[00:13:45.084 --> 00:13:49.729]  And I say this because watch TV every night and see how we're insulted.
[00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:56.015]  Every day on television you will watch and be told you're lesser of a human being.
[00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:57.337]  Well that's Madison Avenue.
[00:13:57.357 --> 00:13:58.398]  Because you don't have hair.
[00:13:58.418 --> 00:14:01.201]  Madison Avenue makes women, beautiful women, think they're ugly and they're not.
[00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.984]  Yeah, but this is not Madison Avenue.
[00:14:04.024 --> 00:14:05.085]  This is a male thing.
[00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:11.790]  In the male genre, we're made to feel.
[00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.532]  If you don't have a full head of hair, you're a lesser of a man.
[00:14:15.892 --> 00:14:21.115]  And the reason I say that is also like, I'll never forget the most offensive ad of them all.
[00:14:21.615 --> 00:14:29.199]  I was watching one night on TV and a guy comes out and he's got an arm around two blondes and he looks at the camera and goes, you can have fun again.
[00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:36.163]  In other words, insinuating that I, because I lost my hair, have no fun in life anymore.
[00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.871]  But in reality, a lot of women like that kind of hair.
[00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.972]  They use the same commercial for Viagra.
[00:14:43.152 --> 00:14:45.333]  In reality, women's hair don't matter.
[00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:46.694]  And you know where I learned that?
[00:14:47.574 --> 00:14:50.015]  I was doing the XFL football that one year.
[00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:52.656]  Remember when Vince came out with the Alternative Football League?
[00:14:53.156 --> 00:14:55.077]  And remember those cheerleaders he hired?
[00:14:55.157 --> 00:14:56.117]  Holy crap.
[00:14:56.137 --> 00:15:01.879]  I mean, he went out to every team and bought the Playboy Playmates of the Month for all 12 months.
[00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:03.479]  And these were all the cheerleaders, right?
[00:15:03.499 --> 00:15:05.040]  The most beautiful women you've ever seen.
[00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:14.636]  And one day we were there early at the game and I'm down on the field and the cheerleaders rove in the corner and they were practicing whatever it was they were going to do and I had the shaved head at the time.
[00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:16.557]  And so I thought, you know what?
[00:15:16.777 --> 00:15:17.657]  I'm going to find out.
[00:15:18.257 --> 00:15:24.741]  So I walked over to these twelve girls over there and I said, ladies, I said, can I ask you kind of a personal question?
[00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:25.481]  They said, sure.
[00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:26.482]  You know, they took a break.
[00:15:27.022 --> 00:15:30.664]  I said, I'd like to know, does hair on a man matter?
[00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:36.473]  And the reason I knew I got the truth was because they all answered so quickly.
[00:15:36.993 --> 00:15:37.874]  There was no thought.
[00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:42.037]  They all, all these girls, and these were the most beautiful girls you could imagine.
[00:15:42.397 --> 00:15:44.578]  They all looked at me and said, absolutely not.
[00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:46.980]  It doesn't make any bit of difference.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.141]  And I said... Well, it's the man.
[00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:50.142]  It's who the person is.
[00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:52.503]  No, we're made, this is a male thing.
[00:15:52.523 --> 00:15:53.224]  No, it's brainwashing.
[00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:58.627]  We're made at a young age to believe if you lose your hair, you're somehow lesser of a male.
[00:15:59.128 --> 00:16:00.949]  That you have no self-confidence.
[00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:06.077]  Well, you don't believe it, but it's about being you, Willie, and I use for example... That's the difference.
[00:16:06.117 --> 00:16:08.839]  Willie is immune to the propaganda.
[00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:12.362]  Imagine if they did that to women with breast implants.
[00:16:13.383 --> 00:16:14.504]  The outrage there'd be.
[00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:25.534]  If they got on TV every night and had all these ads telling women, look, if you go get synthetic breast implants, you'll have better personality, you'll have fun again,
[00:16:25.936 --> 00:16:27.617]  Your whole life will change.
[00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:29.098]  You'll be more attractive.
[00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:30.898]  You'll be the complete woman.
[00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:32.679]  Your tits will taste like choke.
[00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:41.003]  If they did that to women every day and pounded that, you would hear an outcry.
[00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.745]  You'd hear people saying, you know, lawsuits and all this.
[00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:46.386]  But with bald men, they can get away with it.
[00:16:46.626 --> 00:16:49.427]  Well, now we've heard the bald men rant.
[00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:50.288]  It's absolutely true.
[00:16:50.987 --> 00:16:57.272]  One of my best friends who's a Los Angeles homicide detective gave me a ride home one night from a thing in L.A.
[00:16:57.432 --> 00:17:01.635]  and he looked at me and said, you have to run for president.
[00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:05.298]  He said, you are the person that has to do it.
[00:17:05.378 --> 00:17:06.359]  And I said, come on, Dennis.
[00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:09.241]  I said, don't put pressure on me like that.
[00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:12.744]  I said, I don't, you know, I don't want that job.
[00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:14.165]  Especially, I wouldn't want it now.
[00:17:15.006 --> 00:17:19.930]  I mean, be it Obama or McCain who ends up with this job,
[00:17:20.882 --> 00:17:26.006]  It's going to be horrible, because they're going to have to spend their entire four years cleaning up George Bush's mess.
[00:17:26.506 --> 00:17:32.290]  Well, more than that, the country's so run by foreign corporations and special interests, the President really doesn't have that much power.
[00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:37.274]  He's got a bully pulpit, and if he was a good guy, he could change things and use the Constitution.
[00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:40.676]  But as they are now, they just think it's... Alex, let me ask you this.
[00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:42.997]  What do you think would happen if I ran and won?
[00:17:43.398 --> 00:17:44.238]  They'd probably kill you.
[00:17:44.418 --> 00:17:44.659]  Really?
[00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:48.010]  Do you really think so?
[00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.730]  Because I am a rogue.
[00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.970]  Nobody owns me.
[00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.571]  They would try to compromise you.
[00:17:53.151 --> 00:17:54.571]  I mean, that says who you are.
[00:17:54.611 --> 00:17:57.932]  But I trust that you're a good guy and who you say you are.
[00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.572]  You have a pretty good record of that.
[00:17:59.652 --> 00:18:03.293]  And I don't think you would go along with what they wanted you to do.
[00:18:03.933 --> 00:18:05.653]  They might be scared of killing you to make you a martyr.
[00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:08.294]  They might just try to drag dirt out and destroy you in the media.
[00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:13.996]  But, I mean, if you didn't go along with it... Or not even drag dirt out, make up dirt.
[00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:14.917]  Well, no, that's what I mean.
[00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:19.359]  Well, you know, they'll take one little speck, or like one percent truth, or no truth.
[00:18:19.379 --> 00:18:25.903]  I mean, I used to think they meant, like with politicians and people in media, they would just take things about us and exaggerate them or twist them.
[00:18:26.323 --> 00:18:30.486]  In my own little life, I've found people now will just whole cloth make up stuff.
[00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:32.087]  I mean, just, none of it's true.
[00:18:32.867 --> 00:18:34.108]  I've had that already, too.
[00:18:34.628 --> 00:18:38.371]  And I've actually had it printed in writing where the paper had to retract it.
[00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:39.711]  Oh, I have too.
[00:18:39.771 --> 00:18:42.672]  I've had situations where the whole thing was made up.
[00:18:42.952 --> 00:18:43.272]  Multiple times.
[00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:45.913]  It was in the Dallas Morning News that I said, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:18:46.454 --> 00:18:47.494]  Who's she?
[00:18:48.094 --> 00:18:50.995]  She's like some neocon and post-apartheid figure and stuff.
[00:18:51.095 --> 00:18:55.857]  But we sent the Dallas Morning News the video, and it didn't say that.
[00:18:55.877 --> 00:18:59.658]  Some provocateur was like, with her, as a joke, going, oh, you want to kill Michelle Malkin?
[00:19:00.158 --> 00:19:02.279]  And the Dallas Morning News had to retract that.
[00:19:03.388 --> 00:19:06.610]  The point is, I mean, you know, I don't know, it's just amazing.
[00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.212]  Well, yeah, you know what they got me for one time?
[00:19:10.152 --> 00:19:18.658]  They said that an elderly couple in Montana said I was out there and I jumped up on a table at a stripper bar and they had to physically remove me.
[00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:20.939]  Just made up.
[00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:24.802]  And that was printed in the Minneapolis paper, those allegations.
[00:19:25.522 --> 00:19:30.265]  And, you know, I laughingly said, I've been to Montana twice.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:46.762]  I said I went through there when I was a child going to the World Fair in Seattle with my mother and I said the second time I've ever been to Montana was traveling back from Portland, Oregon when I had finished wrestling or driving with my wife.
[00:19:47.663 --> 00:19:54.646]  I said I hardly doubt that I would have gone into a stripper bar on either occasion and had to be pulled and removed from the stage.
[00:19:55.206 --> 00:20:02.109]  Well no, I mean that's that false image of just like a out-of-control nut when you seem like a pretty controlled guy.
[00:20:03.462 --> 00:20:09.831]  Well, I've done my share of stuff, which I'll take credit for, but certainly when I didn't do it, I won't take credit for it.
[00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:11.132]  Why did that couple make it up?
[00:20:12.314 --> 00:20:19.283]  I think they were elderly and I think that they probably saw someone with a shaved head and was big and reminded them of me.
[00:20:20.074 --> 00:20:21.835]  That's the best I could come up with.
[00:20:21.895 --> 00:20:28.199]  I really don't think they did it thinking that they were overly, you know, like they were an attack squad.
[00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:29.080]  I had the same thing.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.900]  We lived in this neighborhood.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:44.050]  I think that they just, it was a case of mistaken identity where these elderly people just saw this incident happen and somehow figured out or assumed that it was me four, three, five years, whatever it was, supposedly earlier.
[00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.350]  I don't know.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.104]  I really didn't answer for that, but, you know, I just said it's ridiculous.
[00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:56.150]  I mean, you know, I have been to Montana traveling through it twice, but I said I can't even recollect when and where I stopped to get gas.
[00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.112]  Even though it's a very big state, I'm sure I must have.
[00:21:00.534 --> 00:21:09.862]  But I said the only two times were when I was a child on the train with my mom, when she and my aunt and my brother and I all went to the World's Fair in Seattle.
[00:21:11.255 --> 00:21:15.018]  How was the World's Fair in Seattle?
[00:21:15.278 --> 00:21:16.079]  Great as it did.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.942]  When I went there it was cool.
[00:21:19.002 --> 00:21:24.988]  The thing I remember most about it, they had a big container there that had one million silver dollars in it.
[00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:30.872]  And this was way back in the early 60's where a million dollars was really a lot of money then.
[00:21:30.892 --> 00:21:31.832]  You know, today it's not.
[00:21:31.872 --> 00:21:37.213]  But they had this huge container in a room and it was, you know, a million silver dollars in there.
[00:21:37.233 --> 00:21:38.293]  A million silver dollars?
[00:21:39.614 --> 00:21:47.715]  That's what I remember the most about that they had this big container with a million silver dollars in it.
[00:21:48.295 --> 00:21:51.816]  So I think the cover-up is the biggest piece of evidence that it is an inside job.
[00:21:52.839 --> 00:21:56.683]  That certainly plays a huge role in it.
[00:21:56.743 --> 00:22:14.862]  The show I'm doing, we've actually shifted on that too, saying maybe we should go and instead of worrying about presenting the two sides, the show should say what a massive failure, not on the parts of the volunteer workers, you have to separate them because they did a hell of a job.
[00:22:15.444 --> 00:22:20.446]  Those people that went in there and worked for 69 months are heroes that went in there.
[00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:24.328]  But, the point we want to get to is who was giving the orders?
[00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:28.009]  Who was telling all these guys to remove everything?
[00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:37.873]  Like, I'll never forget, Rudy Giuliani bragged 24 hours later that they had already pulled 120 truckloads of debris was gone.
[00:22:38.994 --> 00:22:43.236]  And, initially, you as an individual go, oh yay, isn't that great?
[00:22:44.187 --> 00:22:48.073]  It sounds good on the surface, but then when you think about it, you go, well, wait a minute.
[00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:49.455]  That's 120 truckloads of evidence.
[00:22:51.975 --> 00:22:55.838]  That you see in hindsight that were removed within 24 hours.
[00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:59.562]  I interviewed one man and he's an honorary firefighter.
[00:22:59.582 --> 00:23:09.230]  He's actually an emergency response guy who spent 257 days at the site and never was paid a penny.
[00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:10.771]  And he's dying now.
[00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:12.513]  He won't admit it, but he's dying.
[00:23:12.613 --> 00:23:13.213]  I sat with him.
[00:23:13.654 --> 00:23:15.775]  He showed me photos of the guys he worked with.
[00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:16.356]  They're all dead.
[00:23:17.748 --> 00:23:18.808]  from just being down there.
[00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:37.176]  He told me about a year later they finally sent him to a specialist and they sent him to a specialist and he talked about how they put him in, at first they found 14 different lethal toxins in his body.
[00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:39.257]  14 different things.
[00:23:39.858 --> 00:23:45.180]  Then they put him in this almost heat box where all he did was drink liquids and urinate.
[00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:52.093]  And they sweated him and he said they took white towels and rubbed them on my arms and they came off yellow.
[00:23:53.813 --> 00:23:56.894]  They were trying to get all the toxins to come out his pores.
[00:23:57.014 --> 00:24:00.175]  It was the only way they knew to attempt to do it.
[00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:13.639]  Well, the sad thing about this gentleman Mike's story is that he goes around now, he actually wrote their book one year after 9-11, before the 9-11 Commission.
[00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:42.129]  and stated that he saw them discover one of the black boxes and his partner came back and said no we found three of the four and he believes his partner because his partner would have no reason to lie to him they were there together he saw one of them his partner saw the other two but they said in their book they said three of the four were were recovered and then what caused him grave concern was when 9-11 came out the commission said there were no black boxes found
[00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:48.432]  And all of this stuff, they never found them at the towers, and to this day they won't acknowledge that they ever found them.
[00:24:48.772 --> 00:24:51.073]  And this guy said, that's bullshit, I saw one.
[00:24:51.693 --> 00:24:52.734]  I saw it recovered.
[00:24:53.034 --> 00:25:02.258]  And he also said, how could they not find them when we went through that debris so fine that we were finding little bone fragments.
[00:25:03.373 --> 00:25:05.776]  That we could then DNA match up to victims.
[00:25:06.376 --> 00:25:10.340]  He said, you're telling me we wouldn't find the black boxes even if they were wrecked?
[00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:13.343]  We would have still found the physical black box.
[00:25:14.084 --> 00:25:17.268]  And you should see what they've done to this guy today, Willie.
[00:25:17.288 --> 00:25:18.269]  This guy's a hero.
[00:25:18.869 --> 00:25:19.470]  He's a hero.
[00:25:20.226 --> 00:25:32.677]  And he was going around to schools with children talking about his experience that day, and he's got a couple relics, pieces of metal that he kind of hijacked from the site.
[00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:35.999]  Well, he's also got what was given to him
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:44.822]  One of those oxygen bottles and units that all firemen wear, and he uses that as part of his presentation.
[00:25:45.382 --> 00:25:54.244]  Well, New York came after him and said that he had that illegally and that he wasn't supposed to have that oxygen bottle.
[00:25:54.564 --> 00:25:56.865]  They wanted to know what firemen gave it to him.
[00:25:57.816 --> 00:25:59.277]  And he said, I'm not telling.
[00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:01.318]  He said, I'm not ratting the guy out.
[00:26:01.358 --> 00:26:02.339]  He said, I will not.
[00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:05.801]  Do with me what you're going to, but I'm not going to say who gave me this.
[00:26:05.821 --> 00:26:08.022]  You know, it was given to me by a fireman.
[00:26:08.542 --> 00:26:10.063]  But he said, I'm not going to rat the guy.
[00:26:10.883 --> 00:26:13.725]  Well, they ended up, they threw him in jail for three days.
[00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:19.568]  When he finally got out of jail, it went in front of the District Attorney of Brooklyn.
[00:26:19.608 --> 00:26:23.270]  And the District Attorney of Brooklyn looked at it and went, what the hell is this?
[00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.492]  He said, this man came to my son's school.
[00:26:26.553 --> 00:26:28.754]  and made his presentation to teach kids.
[00:26:28.794 --> 00:26:30.235]  He said, what is this crap?
[00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:31.456]  He threw it out, hammered it.
[00:26:31.476 --> 00:26:32.836]  He said, gone.
[00:26:33.337 --> 00:26:34.157]  Threw it out of court.
[00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:37.939]  Thank goodness we had a district attorney with some common sense.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.642]  But the point being is here, this guy worked 250 some days for nothing.
[00:26:45.512 --> 00:26:52.457]  And now because he's in possession of something he's not supposedly supposed to be in, they throw him in jail for three days?
[00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:57.961]  Like he said to me, they lost 350 firemen that day and they're worried about an oxygen tank?
[00:26:58.662 --> 00:27:05.287]  Willie, what's your take on how they blocked the funding for the firefighters and police and emergency workers from all that deadly dust?
[00:27:05.627 --> 00:27:06.388]  Why wouldn't Congress
[00:27:07.513 --> 00:27:16.865]  I mean, we've been to Congress, have made a film about it, and they just say, no, we're not going to take care of it, even though all the CAT scans in hospitals say it's killing them.
[00:27:17.626 --> 00:27:19.488]  And this firefighter uses a 600 number.
[00:27:19.508 --> 00:27:25.656]  The official government reports a few months ago say it's over 1,100 have died.
[00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:38.395]  Well, first of all, there's a long list of things that we could talk about that we don't like about this government and what it's doing and what it has done.
[00:27:39.276 --> 00:27:44.577]  And it goes back further than the Bush administration.
[00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:49.498]  It goes all the way back to other administrations a long time ago.
[00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:58.070]  When this country started, we went the wrong way and started doing things around the world thinking that we were the world's policemen.
[00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:08.435]  And if also we were the world's resource gatherer, if there was something over there you had, we're going to come get it.
[00:28:08.515 --> 00:28:10.956]  We'll make you a deal you can't turn down.
[00:28:11.636 --> 00:28:16.398]  So that's been going on as long as I can remember, as long as I've been watching our government operate.
[00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:25.741]  This is just one more time, I think, that they're stepped over the line doing things that they... As far as I'm concerned, that's not what I hired them for.
[00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:30.062]  They work for me, they work for you, they work for Jesse, and they're screwing up.
[00:28:30.682 --> 00:28:36.283]  Well, I think that, like you said earlier, the people are finally really getting fed up, and I don't think they're gonna go back to sleep again.
[00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:38.044]  I think... I think the revolution's on.
[00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:38.144]  I do.
[00:28:39.624 --> 00:28:40.724]  Well, let me tell you... I do.
[00:28:41.505 --> 00:28:43.685]  I don't think they're gonna go back to sleep.
[00:28:45.466 --> 00:28:47.006]  Well, if we wake the motherfuckers up,
[00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:55.039]  Well, we'll wake them up, but I bet they go back to sleep again.
[00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:56.881]  Well, Willie, what do you say?
[00:28:57.041 --> 00:28:58.022]  I hope I'm wrong.
[00:28:58.102 --> 00:29:04.529]  I don't know, I just believe some of them will go back to sleep because some of them didn't want to get woke up.
[00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.635]  But there are a group of intelligent young people out there
[00:29:10.774 --> 00:29:13.616]  Not very many of my age are your age.
[00:29:14.196 --> 00:29:18.119]  Most of the people my age or your age think just exactly like what you said.
[00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:19.880]  Things are the way they are.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.961]  Don't mess with them.
[00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:22.742]  Go do your job.
[00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:24.243]  Keep your head down, you know.
[00:29:24.924 --> 00:29:26.184]  Don't stir up anything.
[00:29:26.405 --> 00:29:30.167]  But there's some young people out there with a lot of guts, a lot of balls.
[00:29:30.387 --> 00:29:31.388]  They're going to stir it up.
[00:29:31.968 --> 00:29:34.090]  And they're going to elect Obama.
[00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.092]  They're going to elect some government officials.
[00:29:37.112 --> 00:29:38.993]  They're going to elect some senators and congressmen.
[00:29:39.293 --> 00:29:42.538]  We'll go in there and start doing the right thing for a while.
[00:29:42.859 --> 00:29:43.600]  And then you're right.
[00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:47.005]  In a little while, everybody will go back to sleep.
[00:29:47.665 --> 00:29:53.507]  And the guys will say, all right, we're going to let them have it for four to eight years because look how we screwed it up.
[00:29:53.927 --> 00:30:05.050]  Let's back out of the way and let them have our problems that we created for a while and we'll go over here and we'll reorganize and we'll think it over and we'll raise some more money and we'll go get it again.
[00:30:05.451 --> 00:30:13.253]  I agree fully because, Alex, we talked about history and how if you don't study history, the old cliche, you're deemed to repeat it.
[00:30:14.272 --> 00:30:16.362]  Well, look at my generation.
[00:30:16.904 --> 00:30:17.487]  And Willie's.
[00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.371]  We're the generation of the 60s.
[00:30:20.871 --> 00:30:22.771]  We were supposed to be the rebels.
[00:30:22.911 --> 00:30:26.132]  We were supposed to be the ones who were anti-establishment.
[00:30:26.493 --> 00:30:28.793]  The ones who learned from Vietnam.
[00:30:29.253 --> 00:30:31.574]  The ones that saw all this stuff go down.
[00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:33.635]  And yet, what has happened to all of us?
[00:30:34.175 --> 00:30:35.575]  Where did we all go?
[00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:37.236]  I was so proud of the peacemakers.
[00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:40.937]  I was so proud of the guys who got out there and fought against the war.
[00:30:41.097 --> 00:30:43.818]  And to come home from Vietnam and say, hey, that's wrong.
[00:30:45.475 --> 00:30:46.435]  But they went back to sleep.
[00:30:46.535 --> 00:30:47.015]  That's right.
[00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:50.797]  But, but, you talked about... Back to, wait, our generation.
[00:30:51.337 --> 00:30:55.118]  We're the generation supposedly of, we're in charge now.
[00:30:56.698 --> 00:30:59.239]  But yet when you go back, the hypocrisy.
[00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:02.380]  We were the generation that believed in free love.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.021]  Now we're telling you abstinence.
[00:31:06.687 --> 00:31:13.870]  We're the generation that used drugs, and yet today we're fighting the biggest war on drugs in the history of the land.
[00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.491]  Exact opposite of what we were.
[00:31:17.091 --> 00:31:20.073]  We're the generation that should have known about war.
[00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:23.514]  That should have known about getting into a deceitful war.
[00:31:23.854 --> 00:31:30.297]  And yet here we've allowed, we're the leaders now, and we've taken the young people into the same thing that we did.
[00:31:30.697 --> 00:31:32.638]  And that's what troubles me the most.
[00:31:33.138 --> 00:31:34.918]  Where the hell are all the people?
[00:31:35.178 --> 00:31:36.539]  Did we all go to sleep?
[00:31:36.879 --> 00:31:39.419]  Did we all become born-again Republicans?
[00:31:39.979 --> 00:31:47.361]  What happened to the Vietnam generation that ought to be in charge today, that ought to know better?
[00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:50.462]  What happened to peace on Earth?
[00:31:51.202 --> 00:31:55.422]  I remember growing up that that was what we were all taught was going to happen one day.
[00:31:55.483 --> 00:32:01.264]  I'd go to church and they'd say, well, you've got the Prince of Peace, Jesus, he's going to come and there's going to be peace on Earth for a thousand years.
[00:32:01.664 --> 00:32:02.444]  I said, I can't wait.
[00:32:04.042 --> 00:32:04.442]  Where is it?
[00:32:05.162 --> 00:32:11.685]  Well, let me just ask this question and then we better move on down the road because I don't want to take too much of Willie's views this time and we're very thankful for it.
[00:32:14.005 --> 00:32:17.487]  Specifically though, you mentioned Super Size Me totally changing the fast food industry.
[00:32:17.507 --> 00:32:18.547]  I mean, it's changed a lot.
[00:32:18.967 --> 00:32:20.928]  That's one film.
[00:32:21.188 --> 00:32:21.488]  For now.
[00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:23.849]  But the point is, look at what Loose Change did.
[00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:29.511]  Over 100 million downloads for free online and it woke up tens of millions of people worldwide.
[00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:30.251]  Well, it woke me up.
[00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:40.175]  So there's another example of individuals standing up, and young people, but everybody, and great elders like you guys, out there standing up.
[00:32:40.335 --> 00:32:46.497]  Look, we know stuff's bad, but it'd be a hell of a lot worse if it wasn't for people like Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and folks like Dennis Kucinich.
[00:32:46.557 --> 00:32:52.120]  All I'm saying is, for everybody else sitting on their butts, be more like a Willie Nelson and get out there and do something.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.541]  But that's essentially the problem.
[00:32:55.561 --> 00:32:57.342]  We do it and hopefully something will
[00:32:58.615 --> 00:33:06.757]  But the problem is this, everybody lives in their own little world, and if their own little world is not affected directly, they will ignore it.
[00:33:06.917 --> 00:33:09.938]  But right now with the economy sinking, their world is affected.
[00:33:10.018 --> 00:33:10.658]  Oh yeah, I agree.
[00:33:11.358 --> 00:33:14.279]  And gasoline, they are affected.
[00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:16.840]  They're going to have to start growing their own vegetables again.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.820]  That's great.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:25.002]  I'm glad to see them having to get out and dig in that soil and plant a seed, and sit back and watch it grow.
[00:33:25.342 --> 00:33:26.122]  But that's America.
[00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.016]  Where they've been is not American.
[00:33:31.252 --> 00:33:41.575]  Living on, you know, eight or ten houses and six yachts and going off and starting these big corporations where they screw me and you out of money and they go overseas and spend it.
[00:33:41.615 --> 00:33:42.375]  That's not America.
[00:33:42.835 --> 00:33:46.776]  Now, I want to see one of those guys get out there and have to grow his own potatoes.
[00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:48.296]  Well, I think that's another issue.
[00:33:48.316 --> 00:33:50.057]  Bring into justice corporate crooks.
[00:33:50.637 --> 00:33:55.478]  But they run the regulators now, so we have to get back control of the regulators so we can punish these crooks.
[00:33:55.718 --> 00:33:58.399]  No, what we have to do is simpler than that.
[00:33:59.195 --> 00:34:02.217]  We have to stop electing Democrats and Republicans.
[00:34:03.237 --> 00:34:11.182]  And we have to start electing and destroying the system they've created that is so corrupt within itself that we're a two-party dictatorship now.
[00:34:11.662 --> 00:34:13.603]  And that, you know how I put it, Alex?
[00:34:13.643 --> 00:34:14.844]  Here's what you have today.
[00:34:14.884 --> 00:34:16.785]  And I do have a little experience on this.
[00:34:17.665 --> 00:34:20.967]  Politics in America today is identical to pro-wrestling.
[00:34:22.668 --> 00:34:27.431]  And what I mean by that is, in front of the cameras and the public, we all hate each other.
[00:34:28.473 --> 00:34:30.414]  I'm going to kick my opponent's butt.
[00:34:30.494 --> 00:34:34.175]  I'm going to wail him from here to high water and beat the crap out of him.
[00:34:34.535 --> 00:34:37.755]  Yet behind the scenes, we all are friends going out to dinner.
[00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.036]  Went to dinner together.
[00:34:39.416 --> 00:34:40.556]  And it's all a work.
[00:34:40.696 --> 00:34:41.376]  All intermarried.
[00:34:41.436 --> 00:34:41.877]  Show business.
[00:34:42.257 --> 00:34:43.097]  It's show biz.
[00:34:43.497 --> 00:34:45.478]  And that's what you have today in politics.
[00:34:45.538 --> 00:34:48.698]  The Democrats and Republicans aren't really opposed to each other.
[00:34:48.738 --> 00:34:50.039]  They're all part of the same.
[00:34:50.579 --> 00:34:53.440]  And I can use as an example, Alex, the election of 2006.
[00:34:55.945 --> 00:35:00.889]  All right, up till 2006 you had a Republican Congress and a Republican President.
[00:35:01.369 --> 00:35:04.952]  Then along came the election of 2006, which was the war in Iraq.
[00:35:05.352 --> 00:35:05.953]  The U.S.
[00:35:06.033 --> 00:35:07.354]  people spoke clearly.
[00:35:07.414 --> 00:35:09.396]  They said, get us out of Iraq.
[00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:11.537]  So they elected the Democrats.
[00:35:11.597 --> 00:35:13.399]  The Democrats took both houses.
[00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:16.481]  And two years later, are we out of Iraq?
[00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:17.162]  No.
[00:35:18.379 --> 00:35:20.460]  Because the Democrats are spineless.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.081]  They're owned by the same corporate interests.
[00:35:22.181 --> 00:35:22.861]  Exactly.
[00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:29.845]  And when the Dems always look at me and go, oh wait, we can't get out, we can't override Bush's veto.
[00:35:30.305 --> 00:35:36.028]  And I look at them and go, but you control all the money, you don't have to override Bush's veto.
[00:35:36.148 --> 00:35:40.490]  All you have to do is, well Obama's already fudging.
[00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:49.338]  He's fudged since day one in this election, where he first said we're getting out, well now it's a timetable and now it's da-da-da, because they're getting to him.
[00:35:49.498 --> 00:35:55.564]  They're understanding that he ain't going to be able to get them out because people more powerful than him got us in.
[00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.711]  I mean, your life has been pretty interesting.
[00:35:58.732 --> 00:36:01.654]  You've seen a lot of things in a lot of over-twisted terms.
[00:36:02.594 --> 00:36:04.396]  What do you see happening to yourself in the future?
[00:36:04.416 --> 00:36:05.536]  I mean, is there a run for president?
[00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:06.917]  I don't know.
[00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:10.300]  You know, I've learned that one thing is that you never say never.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.782]  But right now, I would say no.
[00:36:13.822 --> 00:36:24.210]  To me, it's... You know, that would be one of the most difficult jobs I could imagine to undertake in the world.
[00:36:25.129 --> 00:36:29.433]  And I guess the tough thing for me, Alex, is this.
[00:36:30.994 --> 00:36:37.080]  I'm a very free spirit, and going for a job like that is doing the opposite.
[00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:39.202]  I've said this many times.
[00:36:39.722 --> 00:36:41.744]  Being the president's an oxymoron.
[00:36:42.585 --> 00:36:43.426]  And here's what I mean.
[00:36:44.126 --> 00:36:48.110]  You're the head of the free world, but yet you yourself have no freedom.
[00:36:49.284 --> 00:36:50.064]  And that's what it is.
[00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:52.886]  You're the head of the free world, but where is your freedom?
[00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:57.948]  You can't go anywhere without masses of people around you.
[00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:01.630]  Probably the only time you're alone is in your bedroom.
[00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:08.973]  You know, I would guess that would be the only... Or in the White House, I'm sure you could go to a few rooms there and be by yourself.
[00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:10.694]  But for the most part,
[00:37:11.514 --> 00:37:20.458]  You're never ever... I remember when I left governor how strange it was that day that I left office and I all of a sudden was naked.
[00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:23.239]  What I mean by that is no more protection.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.803]  And it was weird because you went from being fully protected to the very next day when the new governor was sworn into nothing.
[00:37:30.763 --> 00:37:32.084]  You think you needed the protection?
[00:37:32.624 --> 00:37:33.704]  Did I need the protection?
[00:37:33.744 --> 00:37:36.326]  I got a death threat a week when I was in office.
[00:37:36.346 --> 00:37:37.026]  Oh yeah.
[00:37:37.884 --> 00:37:51.016]  Now, probably 99.9 of those death threats are phony, but you have to address every one of them seriously because you don't know the one that you do deem as phony could end up real.
[00:37:51.156 --> 00:37:52.678]  That's like Dick Cheney with the dark side.
[00:37:53.703 --> 00:37:59.125]  I've always believed for the most part, though, that the person that's going to harm you is not going to warn you.
[00:37:59.685 --> 00:38:00.445]  No, no, exactly.
[00:38:00.785 --> 00:38:04.566]  That's the way I kind of... But you still have to take them very seriously.
[00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:07.767]  It was so bad, my daughter got a death threat.
[00:38:08.468 --> 00:38:11.388]  And she, at the time, was just a sophomore in high school.
[00:38:12.029 --> 00:38:13.989]  You know, beautiful young kid going to school.
[00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.050]  Some guy said he was going to chop her up into little pieces.
[00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:19.711]  Unfortunately for him,
[00:38:20.396 --> 00:38:23.362]  He was a blithering idiot because he did it over the internet.
[00:38:25.399 --> 00:38:46.214]  And all it took for my state trooper intelligence squad to do was follow the internet to its source and he was a young gentleman that worked at Best Buy and all of a sudden six state troopers walked into Best Buy and took him to jail, of which he did go to jail because it is a felony to threaten a public official.
[00:38:47.114 --> 00:38:53.459]  You know, if you're an elected official and someone threatens you with bodily harm or violence or death or whatever, that's a felony.
[00:38:54.744 --> 00:38:56.886]  Rest assured, the politicians take care of themselves.
[00:38:56.966 --> 00:38:58.308]  Well, it's a terroristic threat to anybody.
[00:38:58.668 --> 00:39:00.750]  Yeah, but even worse to a politician.
[00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.253]  I know how people threaten me all the time, even using their real names.
[00:39:03.373 --> 00:39:09.238]  I'm just like, they're lucky I don't have time to go press stuff on them.
[00:39:09.279 --> 00:39:13.463]  No, I had a death threat a week, and you know, you have to take them seriously.
[00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.551]  Let's do it, sure.
[00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:18.973]  I'm right behind you, brother.
[00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:20.513]  I'm down here now with Willie.
[00:39:21.034 --> 00:39:21.654]  Good for you.
[00:39:21.834 --> 00:39:23.295]  LeBron called to Willie.
[00:39:23.315 --> 00:39:28.538]  The Backyard opened in May of 1993 with a concert from Willie Nelson and it closes with Willie Nelson.
[00:39:28.618 --> 00:39:34.501]  It's appropriate and the guy that brought out Willie Nelson this evening, Jesse Ventura, how'd this come to be?
[00:39:34.761 --> 00:39:35.862]  What are you doing here?
[00:39:35.882 --> 00:39:46.051]  Well, I've been a friend of Willie's for a number of years, and when I found out that Willie was going to close down the backyard, I figured it was time to fly down from Minnesota and get a chance to see the backyard.
[00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:53.778]  I've never seen it before, and so since this is the last night and Willie's closing it down, it was important for me to be here and watch Willie do it.
[00:39:54.438 --> 00:39:55.919]  It's an awful nice venue, isn't it?
[00:39:55.939 --> 00:39:57.079]  Oh, it's a terrific venue.
[00:39:57.159 --> 00:39:58.860]  I can't understand why they're closing it.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.341]  I'd be opening it if I were them.
[00:40:00.361 --> 00:40:01.321]  Why shut it down?
[00:40:01.381 --> 00:40:05.243]  It's a great gathering for people, you know, on the weekends and that.
[00:40:05.263 --> 00:40:08.264]  They have a good time and we need more of that in the country right now.
[00:40:08.644 --> 00:40:11.505]  We've all heard enough about the bad times in our country.
[00:40:11.926 --> 00:40:15.907]  It's time to get back to thinking positive again and start moving in a positive direction.
[00:40:16.227 --> 00:40:19.129]  And that positive direction for you is anyone but, right?
[00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:20.809]  Yeah, you notice what my shirt says.
[00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.010]  Anyone but.
[00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:33.062]  And until we break this trend of electing Democrats and Republicans people and start electing Independents, we will get out of the problem that we're in if we do that.
[00:40:33.402 --> 00:40:36.366]  But if we look ahead a week, one of those guys is going to win.
[00:40:36.506 --> 00:40:40.130]  Oh, certainly one of them is going to win, but neither one of them will have my vote.
[00:40:40.763 --> 00:40:46.308]  Because, and I urge people that, remember, voting is not picking a horse race.
[00:40:46.888 --> 00:40:47.949]  That isn't why you vote.
[00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:53.473]  You're voting to pick the person who you most believe can run our country the best.
[00:40:54.014 --> 00:40:56.155]  So vote your heart and vote your conscience.
[00:40:56.736 --> 00:40:59.318]  And if you do that, then you haven't wasted your vote.
[00:40:59.598 --> 00:41:04.162]  It's not about picking a winner, it's about picking the person you most want to run the country.
[00:41:04.542 --> 00:41:09.824]  But in the meantime, there's this cross-section of politics and music that we've got here tonight.
[00:41:09.944 --> 00:41:11.325]  Well, there's always been that.
[00:41:11.365 --> 00:41:13.706]  You know, music has always been part of our lives.
[00:41:13.786 --> 00:41:19.428]  And unfortunately, politics works its way into music, which is probably the negative part of music.
[00:41:19.468 --> 00:41:23.630]  But then again, music greatly sings about politics, too.
[00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.210]  So they go hand in hand.
[00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:32.854]  And my belief is, and I challenge all the singers of today, where are the war protest songs of today like we had in the 60s?
[00:41:33.994 --> 00:41:36.155]  It's time for those musicians to get on board.
[00:41:36.895 --> 00:41:43.797]  There he is, Jesse Ventura, and he's here to bring on Willie Nelson, and Willie Nelson is here to close out the backyard.
[00:41:43.817 --> 00:41:45.497]  16 years of live music.
[00:41:45.777 --> 00:41:47.358]  I won't try to understand.
[00:41:52.399 --> 00:41:54.120]  Let the devil take tomorrow.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.461]  But tonight I need a friend.
[00:42:08.988 --> 00:42:11.710]  No, but hey Jimmy, thanks for all you do, my friend.
[00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.132]  Hey, we're beating back some of the toll roads.
[00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.053]  We're beating back some of the toll roads.
[00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:16.854]  Oh, I know.
[00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:19.175]  It's been a lot of success everywhere.
[00:42:19.215 --> 00:42:20.596]  You're tearing them up.
[00:42:20.676 --> 00:42:21.897]  I'm there with you.
[00:42:22.177 --> 00:42:23.198]  Jesse and everybody.
[00:42:23.318 --> 00:42:23.978]  It's great.
[00:42:24.139 --> 00:42:25.840]  It's an exciting time to be here.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.960]  Hey, hey, real fast.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.822]  Let's get you two with Jimmy.
[00:42:28.842 --> 00:42:29.142]  Real fast.
[00:42:29.162 --> 00:42:30.243]  Let's get two minutes with you and Jimmy.
[00:42:45.018 --> 00:42:47.100]  You guys talk about the Rally for the Republic of Minnesota.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.741]  Okay, we can do that.
[00:42:49.621 --> 00:42:50.242]  Yeah, that was great.
[00:42:50.262 --> 00:42:52.844]  You had a fabulous speech there in Minnesota.
[00:42:53.084 --> 00:42:55.186]  I enjoyed every second of it.
[00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:55.586]  Well, thanks.
[00:42:56.146 --> 00:42:58.068]  And it was great to be there.
[00:42:59.188 --> 00:43:01.289]  And feel like you were at least at the right place, didn't you?
[00:43:01.409 --> 00:43:01.649]  Wasn't it?
[00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:03.029]  Yes, very much so.
[00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:06.050]  You know, the thing that I found most remarkable, Jimmy, was this.
[00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:12.791]  I was at the Ron Paul, if you want to call it counter-convention, that day that we were there together.
[00:43:13.532 --> 00:43:19.013]  Well, the next morning I was invited over because I had to do Fox and CNN, so I went over to St.
[00:43:19.053 --> 00:43:22.054]  Paul where the actual Republican convention was.
[00:43:22.614 --> 00:43:27.115]  And when I arrived that morning, the remarkable thing I noticed was that our convention
[00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:29.477]  There was no additional security.
[00:43:30.238 --> 00:43:31.519]  There was nobody outside.
[00:43:31.579 --> 00:43:33.281]  There was regular Asia security.
[00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:35.202]  It was in that building when the timber was placed.
[00:43:35.523 --> 00:43:36.644]  When I went over to St.
[00:43:36.704 --> 00:43:42.769]  Paul, I saw firsthand what it will be like if they ever place our country under martial law.
[00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:48.371]  Because at the Republican Convention, it was martial law implemented in the city of St.
[00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:50.152]  Paul, which I found pathetic.
[00:43:50.592 --> 00:43:54.193]  I mean, you couldn't even pull up to within eight blocks of the building.
[00:43:54.513 --> 00:44:01.595]  You had to go through three of these big rings of security, these temporary... and there were SWAT teams every hundred feet.
[00:44:01.735 --> 00:44:03.656]  And there wasn't even really... there wasn't really much...
[00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:06.450]  None.
[00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.492]  All we had was Asia.
[00:44:09.812 --> 00:44:10.112]  Asia.
[00:44:10.152 --> 00:44:12.153]  They're the normal people when the Timberwolves play.
[00:44:12.173 --> 00:44:13.054]  They're always there.
[00:44:13.634 --> 00:44:15.415]  And that's what I found so remarkable.
[00:44:15.915 --> 00:44:19.057]  We were the people that didn't need to be protected.
[00:44:19.517 --> 00:44:24.220]  We were the people that anyone could walk in and walk out, and yet over at St.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.321]  Paul, helicopters are flying.
[00:44:26.381 --> 00:44:31.724]  It was a case of martial law, and I thought, my God, is that what our country is now, in its political arena?
[00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:33.465]  I would have rather been with you,
[00:44:34.165 --> 00:44:35.466]  Listening to you play music.
[00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:36.086]  We had a great time.
[00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:37.947]  And we had a fantastic time.
[00:44:38.027 --> 00:44:39.768]  And Minnesota loves Jimmy Vaughn.
