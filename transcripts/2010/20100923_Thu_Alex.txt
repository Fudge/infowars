[00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:09.339]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.800]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:12.461]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.426]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.789]  Well, I almost went to jail this morning.
[00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.053]  Just about an hour ago, on my way into work,
[00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:38.670]  I'll be telling you that story coming up in the next segment.
[00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.251]  We are live.
[00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:45.014]  It is Thursday, the 23rd day of September 2010.
[00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:48.917]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.977 --> 00:01:04.228]  We have a very well-respected historian that the AP, Reuters, London Independent, The Guardian, and others are reporting on from the Chinese government's own annals, Frank Dikotter.
[00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:07.177]  We'll be joining us from Rome.
[00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:16.106]  Has written a new book about Mao Tse-Tung killing 45 million people in four years alone.
[00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.950]  Now on record, the CIA put him into power.
[00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.191]  That's now declassified in 1949.
[00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:23.273]  On record.
[00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:24.915]  They even brag about it on the History Channel.
[00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:30.319]  And of course he killed tens of millions after he got warmed up killing the 45 mil.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.783]  We're all trained how to worship government and lick the boots of the police.
[00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:39.566]  And we've been trained in America to be slaves basically.
[00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:43.009]  And that's why our republic is being imploded right now.
[00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:52.763]  So I thought we'd look at Mao Tse-Tung, who was the model for this corporate world government, in the words of David Rockefeller in 1976 in the New York Times.
[00:01:53.304 --> 00:01:55.325]  We went to the microfilm to pull up that article.
[00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:59.188]  It's actually in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:01.916]  And then we've got Judith McGeary.
[00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:06.940]  They've got this Food Safety Act that will basically shut down family farms and ranches.
[00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.862]  They're trying to pass this week.
[00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:11.344]  She'll be joining us from Texas.
[00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.546]  She's a lawyer and farm owner.
[00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:16.648]  She was going to be on a few days ago, but her husband got attacked by a hornet.
[00:02:16.688 --> 00:02:17.709]  He's going to go to the hospital.
[00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.611]  So he's better now.
[00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:26.176]  She'll be joining us coming up in the third hour of radio broadcast today.
[00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:39.941]  I've got enough adrenaline flowing through me right now to fuel 15 or 20 stampeding elephants because I saw for my own eyes the death of this country about an hour and 10 minutes ago yet again.
[00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:46.402]  The strange thing was I went and visited some family that lives out in Lakeway, stayed there last night.
[00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:48.263]  I went for a jog this morning.
[00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:51.998]  And said bye to my wife and children.
[00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:58.982]  And I was just thinking about talking about the police state today and the culture of living in a tyranny.
[00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:10.108]  And how the system is passing laws to make common people criminals so they can basically incarcerate us all or get fake convictions against us to put us into the system.
[00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:18.273]  But then the big criminals, the central banks, the Kinley types, most of the time get away with the real crimes that are going on.
[00:03:19.093 --> 00:03:24.735]  And I thought about how anywhere I am in the United States now, police come over and shake my hand.
[00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:25.655]  They're waking up.
[00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:35.758]  Every time I'm downtown eating, every time, police stop their cars or stop their bikes or their Segways and come over and say, we appreciate what you're doing.
[00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:44.549]  But then we see all these videos of police out of control around the country and we wonder what's the separation there?
[00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.772]  Why are we seeing these two different polar opposites?
[00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:48.813]  And I know why.
[00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:55.579]  They are training and encouraging thuggism and thuggish behavior and intimidating the people.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.081]  And they are promoting thugs.
[00:03:58.262 --> 00:03:59.563]  I've seen this over and over again.
[00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:02.565]  I know one of my friends who is paralyzed from the chest down.
[00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:04.187]  The cops pulled him over.
[00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:06.709]  They said, what are these hand controls?
[00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:07.609]  He said, I'm paralyzed.
[00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.310]  They said, no, you're not.
[00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.830]  Get out of the car.
[00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.892]  He said, well, my wife's got to get the wheelchair out of the back.
[00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:12.293]  I can't walk.
[00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.735]  And the cop pulled him out, beat him up.
[00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:16.837]  And then that cop got promoted to being a commander.
[00:04:17.978 --> 00:04:20.280]  And it was basically the same thing this morning.
[00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:37.347]  When I saw the checkpoint, or whatever it was, I was trying to find out, in a neighborhood, I pulled over into a side street, I got out politely, put on my most charming demeanor, and I'm gonna go through it word for word for you.
[00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:40.189]  I've written notes here of exactly what happened, blow by blow, and...
[00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:47.533]  This state police officer walked up to me with total hate because to him I'm a blood bag.
[00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:48.955]  To him I'm a T-bone steak.
[00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:54.542]  I am here to provide his paycheck and to provide his ego a power trip and nothing more.
[00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:58.008]  Had a lot of trouble controlling myself.
[00:04:58.028 --> 00:04:58.968]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.988 --> 00:04:59.428]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:03.370]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.111]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:09.052]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:11.614]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:17.096]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:23.719]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:29.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.821]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:38.322]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:44.123]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:47.483]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.103 --> 00:05:49.524]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:50.504]  It's here.

[00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.953]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:04.173 --> 00:06:10.217]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:10.597 --> 00:06:14.940]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.320]  I think so.
[00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:41.937]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:45.941]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:53.749]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:54.309]  Thank you.
[00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:15.079]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:19.762]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:32.778]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:40.807]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:51.090]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.131]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.992]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:01.192 --> 00:08:06.753]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:08:07.213 --> 00:08:09.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:12.768 --> 00:08:20.374]  It's no longer denied the United States is listed by major universities as the sixth most oppressive police state in the world.
[00:08:21.074 --> 00:08:24.377]  Naked body scanners are now going mobile, not just the airports.
[00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:27.019]  They are saving your naked bodies' images.
[00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:28.520]  They are bathing you in radiation.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.247]  The feds have now deployed 500 high-powered radiation vans that look right through your walls, violating the Fourth Amendment.
[00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:50.312]  Israeli companies and others are on record, nationwide, hired by Homeland Security to spy on Tea Party groups, land rights groups, Second Amendment groups, forming dossiers on citizens.
[00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:53.894]  There are now criminal investigations in states like Pennsylvania.
[00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:57.715]  The head of state, Homeland Security, has been missing for two weeks, hiding.
[00:08:58.156 --> 00:09:00.737]  Since this broke, it is all completely illegal.
[00:09:01.497 --> 00:09:03.720]  Foreign banks have taken over the United States.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.706]  They've stolen at least $28 trillion in the last two years, according to Bloomberg.
[00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:10.928]  The country is completely bankrupt.
[00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:17.056]  They have tripled the number of police, and they are trying to train them that the American people are their enemy.
[00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:19.799]  Now, I'm going to get into all the financial news.
[00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:24.556]  All of the political news, everything that's happening.
[00:09:24.936 --> 00:09:27.777]  Listeners yesterday made news again.
[00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:28.718]  You did it.
[00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:29.758]  I salute you.
[00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:39.082]  You made the search term dealing with President Obama and the fact that they may stage an attack or let terrorists attack as a pretext to get more control and win the election.
[00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:43.364]  We have White House officials and advisors saying a terror attack would help them.
[00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:50.829]  We have the former head of Homeland Security, Governor Ridge, writing a book admitting that Bush issued fake terror alerts for political aims.
[00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:54.511]  You made that the number one and number two search engine terms.
[00:09:54.912 --> 00:09:56.272]  CNET News picked it up.
[00:09:56.673 --> 00:09:59.695]  Many other newspapers and publications, CBS picked it up.
[00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:01.016]  Good job.
[00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:11.843]  Hundreds of thousands of additional people are now reading Paul Joseph Watson's powerful article, Will Obama Force America to Absorb a Terror Attack to Save His Presidency?
[00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:13.284]  So, great job.
[00:10:13.664 --> 00:10:14.425]  To the listeners.
[00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:21.054]  We have a historian coming on with new evidence of just how many people Mao Zedong killed in the next hour.
[00:10:21.134 --> 00:10:24.939]  I'll probably be listed as anti-government by the state police for criticizing Mao Zedong.
[00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:26.281]  Their hero, I guess.
[00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:29.185]  But that is all coming up as well.
[00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:30.446]  Then we'll talk to Judith McGeary.
[00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:43.146]  Uh, lawyer and farm owner, uh, who is extremely prominent and heads up farmandranchfreedom.org, dealing with this legislation to further shut down farms and ranches nationwide.
[00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:47.549]  Federal regulations have been passed for $15 million fines for garage sales.
[00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:53.713]  Uh, they are trying to pass laws for $5,000 fines for growing tomatoes in your backyard.
[00:10:53.733 --> 00:11:00.717]  Uh, total hell is being released on the American people as they try to break our back and train us that we're slaves.
[00:11:00.938 --> 00:11:01.078]  Now,
[00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:03.159]  Let me get into what happened this morning.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.841]  I didn't stay at my house last night.
[00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:07.042]  I was visiting family out in Lakeway.
[00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:08.604]  We stayed out there last night.
[00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.407]  I got in the car to come into work.
[00:11:13.826 --> 00:11:24.872]  And I was driving around in a neighborhood, in a neighborhood, and saw five, six, seven, it was probably about seven, I didn't have time to count them all, squad cars, state police squad cars.
[00:11:25.232 --> 00:11:28.453]  And they had one of those little tents set up on the side of the road.
[00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:33.716]  And I turned into a neighborhood and parked by somebody's driveway.
[00:11:34.697 --> 00:11:39.179]  And I walked up and I politely said, hey, how you doing troopers?
[00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:40.600]  What's going on?
[00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:43.566]  Because, again, I wanted to see.
[00:11:44.187 --> 00:11:46.910]  And, of course, my iPhone, I checked it as I pulled up.
[00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.011]  It was out of batteries.
[00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:51.174]  It's an old one, so the batteries burn out.
[00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:53.337]  It only takes a charge for about 45 minutes.
[00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:53.977]  It was dead.
[00:11:53.997 --> 00:11:58.662]  Or I would have taken photos with it or recorded audio to document what was going on.
[00:11:59.123 --> 00:12:01.225]  But I just pulled over, and I do this all the time.
[00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:15.413]  One time I saw a bunch of police and news on 360, and I pulled off at a restaurant, walked over, the police, Austin police, didn't run up and get in my face, and I talked to the media, and I said, well, I said, what's going on?
[00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:25.079]  Very politely, and they said, somebody keeps turning the gas on in the neighborhood, and turning the gas off, and they actually then, hey, can we get a quote from you about what you think of this?
[00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:28.501]  So I was on the local news, some folks saw that earlier this year.
[00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:30.361]  But I do that all the time.
[00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:45.048]  If I see a police checkpoint, whether it's on I-35 or in a neighborhood, it's been ruled by the Supreme Court and state courts that it's illegal, and I pull up and walk over and I ask questions, and I'm polite, I stay back at a distance and say, hey!
[00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:46.508]  They come over, what's going on?
[00:12:46.548 --> 00:12:51.931]  And usually they don't treat me like a slave, they treat their boss, the citizen,
[00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:53.912]  Uh, that pays their bill.
[00:12:53.952 --> 00:12:55.952]  I've had cops tell me, oh, no, I pay taxes too.
[00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:56.813]  I pay my salary.
[00:12:57.113 --> 00:13:00.815]  No, the government takes two private sector jobs for every government job.
[00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:01.775]  Get it through your head.
[00:13:02.095 --> 00:13:02.375]  Okay?
[00:13:02.756 --> 00:13:04.376]  We pay your salary and you know it.
[00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:05.137]  Okay?
[00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:10.499]  So there's this arrogance, kind of like Obama's aunt saying, I'm an illegal alien and you owe me welfare.
[00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:11.800]  You owe me citizenship.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.960]  It's this arrogance.
[00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:15.981]  So I'm going to go through exactly what happened.
[00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:18.443]  Then I'm going to walk through how this affects everybody.
[00:13:18.683 --> 00:13:20.203]  And I was already going to talk about this today.
[00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:21.304]  It's funny this happened.
[00:13:22.119 --> 00:13:25.308]  So, I'm driving down this side street by a neighborhood.
[00:13:26.274 --> 00:13:33.818]  A little two-lane road, and there's all these state police milling around, and it looked like what I saw a few months ago when I went to Slitterbond in New Braunfels.
[00:13:34.198 --> 00:13:39.461]  And we had booked it, again, a little motel there to take my kids, but it was such a police state, I canceled it.
[00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:43.963]  And I said I was going to cancel it, and I probably won't go back to Slitterbond because the police are so bad down there.
[00:13:44.583 --> 00:13:45.624]  But of course, you can't run.
[00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:46.784]  I mean, they're putting it in everywhere.
[00:13:47.145 --> 00:13:55.789]  But I noticed every day that when people were getting off the river, the police were taking photos of them, they had tents set up, they were taking people to jail.
[00:13:57.546 --> 00:14:02.515]  And I drove through one of those and my inspection sticker was out.
[00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:03.316]  I hadn't noticed it.
[00:14:03.617 --> 00:14:05.219]  Pulled me over, gave me a ticket, whatever.
[00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:11.704]  But the issue is the illegal aliens can drunk drive, they're above the law, the police are told to leave them alone.
[00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:14.004]  So, again, I'm the mark.
[00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:15.865]  I'm the citizen that deserves all of this.
[00:14:16.325 --> 00:14:22.346]  So it looked like one of those checkpoints, I know the state police were trying to put them in place again in the state of Texas.
[00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:27.587]  So I pulled off, pulled down a side street about 60, 70 yards down.
[00:14:30.107 --> 00:14:33.968]  Even thought about it, I said, well, you know, this is mailboxes and people's houses, I can park here.
[00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:37.290]  I knew they might try to say I was parked illegally.
[00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.792]  You know, any way to get you in their system.
[00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:41.934]  That's why they passed laws, $15 million fines for garage sales.
[00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:45.416]  It's about $5,000 fines for tomatoes being grown in your backyard.
[00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.038]  It's about getting you in the system.
[00:14:47.078 --> 00:14:47.978]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:49.520]  And I walk up...
[00:14:50.735 --> 00:14:55.940]  And there's all these state police officers standing around, probably six, seven, eight, nine, maybe more, but that's just who I could see.
[00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:58.782]  By the way, they were parked out in the road.
[00:14:58.822 --> 00:15:00.343]  They weren't even parked all the way on the shoulder.
[00:15:00.684 --> 00:15:09.011]  So it's a two-lane road, and people were having to stop because you couldn't drive two cars down the road because the state police were all parked haphazardly halfway in the road.
[00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:10.332]  You see this all the time.
[00:15:10.372 --> 00:15:15.797]  It's almost like it's their enjoyment to block traffic and train you, the slave, that they can do whatever they want.
[00:15:16.772 --> 00:15:22.596]  But I walk up politely, and I'm about 30 yards away, and they say, what do you want?
[00:15:23.117 --> 00:15:29.541]  And this state police officer starts walking over to me, and he literally was about as tall as Yosemite Sam.
[00:15:29.822 --> 00:15:30.902]  Folks, I'm 5'10".
[00:15:30.922 --> 00:15:42.291]  I'm not into how tall you are, how big you are, but there is that Napoleonic complex, and the feds have admitted they've written handbooks to hire police now with only under 100 IQ, and they like to hire short ones.
[00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:44.892]  This is on record who have a Napoleonic complex.
[00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:49.374]  You'll notice most of the commanders now are barely pushing five feet because they got something to prove.
[00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:52.635]  And this guy who literally looked like Yosemite Sam.
[00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:57.698]  I mean, he was so little I thought he was a munchkin because I'm not big and he came up to my chest.
[00:15:58.478 --> 00:15:59.659]  I mean, I had like a foot on him.
[00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:03.961]  Yosemite Sam comes up and I said, how you doing?
[00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:06.682]  And he said, who are you?
[00:16:08.407 --> 00:16:09.288]  Like a drill instructor.
[00:16:09.328 --> 00:16:10.028]  Who are you?
[00:16:10.548 --> 00:16:12.410]  And I said, oh, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.290]  He didn't know who I was.
[00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.551]  I said, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.412]  And I was still being nice.
[00:16:16.993 --> 00:16:18.153]  And I said, hey, what are you guys doing?
[00:16:18.173 --> 00:16:18.954]  Is this a checkpoint?
[00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:20.655]  And he goes, none of your business.
[00:16:21.015 --> 00:16:21.816]  Get out of here!
[00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.428]  Just pointed his finger at me and showed his teeth.
[00:16:25.548 --> 00:16:30.031]  I mean, how dare a scumbag citizen think this is a free country?
[00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:33.053]  You don't talk to a king, a savior, a lord.
[00:16:33.073 --> 00:16:36.735]  He said, get in your car and get out of here!
[00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:39.517]  And I said, well, you're not being very nice.
[00:16:39.537 --> 00:16:44.040]  And I said, I just walked over here and politely asked you what you're doing.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.441]  And he said, none of your business.
[00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:46.822]  I said, get out of here.
[00:16:46.842 --> 00:16:48.503]  And he said, you're parked illegally.
[00:16:49.773 --> 00:16:51.674]  And I looked back and knew I wasn't.
[00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:53.035]  But here he was.
[00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:54.737]  This is tyranny, the nature of tyranny.
[00:16:55.157 --> 00:16:56.918]  And he was looking like I was about to get scared.
[00:16:56.938 --> 00:17:03.143]  And I said, why don't you take me to jail and show me I'm your slave?
[00:17:03.983 --> 00:17:07.305]  And then he kind of went, starts putting his hand on his gun.
[00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:09.916]  I said, get out of here!
[00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:10.936]  Get out of here!
[00:17:11.217 --> 00:17:15.879]  And more of the state police start coming over, and some of them are smiling and looking, obviously some of them knew who I was.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.640]  And I said, I'm gonna go.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.522]  But I said, this is why America's dying and falling apart.
[00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.363]  Because you're on a power trip.
[00:17:22.843 --> 00:17:25.965]  And I said, I knew when I came over here you were gonna treat me like this.
[00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:28.466]  And I was as polite as I could be to you.
[00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:32.189]  But I said, you listen and you tune into this radio frequency.
[00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:34.490]  The local station we're on.
[00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.691]  I said, you tune in,
[00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:38.657]  You tune in one hour from now.
[00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:45.545]  And I got in my car, and boy, they were there getting my license plate and reading it and smiling at me.
[00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:47.206]  They love their database.
[00:17:47.246 --> 00:17:47.907]  They love it.
[00:17:47.947 --> 00:17:49.048]  They love the control.
[00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.951]  Oh, it was so good.
[00:17:51.923 --> 00:17:56.206]  And then once I got out on Main 620, here came a sheriff's department car.
[00:17:56.246 --> 00:18:05.432]  I guess they'd called in and he got right behind me and were following me and I was trying to get my phone charged and finally got it working and called Jaron, because I had a, you know, in-car charger.
[00:18:05.692 --> 00:18:09.295]  Finally got it to boot up and I said, Jaron, you know, who knows what's going to happen to me, but they left me alone.
[00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:10.756]  But they followed me all the way down 620.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.984]  All the way down 620, just let me know, listen, you don't get uppity with us.
[00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:23.808]  It's like that movie, Ants, where the grasshoppers are sitting around, they go, we got all this food, boss.
[00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:26.650]  You know, why are we going back to fight with those ants?
[00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.951]  We don't need them to be our slaves.
[00:18:28.432 --> 00:18:32.595]  And he said, those puny little ants outnumber us a thousand to one.
[00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:35.558]  And if they ever figure that out, it's over for us.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.042]  And so I'm talking to Jaron this morning.
[00:18:41.062 --> 00:18:41.983]  He goes, well, guess what happened to me?
[00:18:43.523 --> 00:18:46.764]  He's taking some folks to the airport at 4 a.m.
[00:18:46.784 --> 00:18:47.224]  this morning.
[00:18:47.264 --> 00:18:56.007]  He pulls in to gas up and he goes in to get a Gatorade and this guy's trying to break into his car.
[00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:57.828]  He goes out starts yelling at him saying stop.
[00:18:58.788 --> 00:19:00.229]  The guy starts trying to attack him.
[00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:01.449]  Jaron knocks him out.
[00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.190]  Yells at him for about three minutes.
[00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:06.025]  Knocks him out.
[00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:10.547]  After the guy swings him a couple times and Jaron, you know, they missed him.
[00:19:11.308 --> 00:19:12.048]  Thug missed him.
[00:19:12.588 --> 00:19:14.169]  And then Jaron knocked him out.
[00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:15.890]  You know, punched him in the nose.
[00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.532]  And the police pull up a few minutes later when the guy's getting up off the ground.
[00:19:21.832 --> 00:19:24.694]  And the first few police show up and then it's a female cop.
[00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:26.295]  The guy gets up and starts charging her.
[00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:27.375]  So she pulls her taser out.
[00:19:27.395 --> 00:19:30.096]  He's clearly whacked out of his mind on drugs.
[00:19:31.517 --> 00:19:31.637]  And
[00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:36.753]  Then another cop pulls up and goes, yeah, I heard you screaming and saw that going on.
[00:19:36.773 --> 00:19:37.954]  They were right by the access road.
[00:19:37.974 --> 00:19:44.578]  The cop, one cop saw it and just kept on driving because it wasn't an old lady he could pull over and make a little money off of.
[00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:49.961]  No, it was a guy being attacked in a parking lot at 5 a.m.
[00:19:50.021 --> 00:19:51.562]  after dropping friends off at the airport.
[00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:52.903]  So there you go.
[00:19:53.143 --> 00:19:57.346]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to talk to Officer, oh, I'm sorry, Sergeant Baker.
[00:19:57.586 --> 00:19:58.687]  I forgot part of the story.
[00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:07.520]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:19.584]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:22:00.638 --> 00:22:06.860]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:15.103]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.423 --> 00:22:23.305]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.605 --> 00:22:28.347]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[00:24:24.602 --> 00:24:27.585]  But there was that ant that stood up to me.
[00:24:27.825 --> 00:24:29.906]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:31.968]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[00:24:32.028 --> 00:24:32.808]  One ant.
[00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:35.710]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:37.672]  It's just one ant.
[00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.574]  Yeah, but they're puny.
[00:24:41.575 --> 00:24:42.175]  Puny?
[00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:47.179]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:49.027]  Did that hurt?
[00:24:50.008 --> 00:24:50.668]  Nope.
[00:24:50.708 --> 00:24:52.029]  Well, how about this one?
[00:24:52.889 --> 00:25:00.333]  Are you kidding?
[00:25:00.353 --> 00:25:06.817]  Well, how about this?
[00:25:09.798 --> 00:25:14.981]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:20.391]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:25:20.911 --> 00:25:24.934]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:27.055]  It's not about food.
[00:25:27.775 --> 00:25:36.941]  It's about keeping those... I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:38.722]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:25:39.282 --> 00:25:42.944]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.353]  And that's from A Bug's Life.
[00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:49.618]  It's not about food.
[00:25:49.678 --> 00:25:52.803]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:25:53.364 --> 00:25:56.528]  So, a puny little ant saw what appeared to be a checkpoint.
[00:25:57.958 --> 00:25:58.519]  I didn't know.
[00:25:58.539 --> 00:26:00.220]  They may have been doing something else.
[00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:02.722]  But it looked like other checkpoints I've seen.
[00:26:02.762 --> 00:26:12.410]  I politely park, walk over, wait for one of my kings, my lords, my owners, to walk over and I politely say, Hi Trooper, how you doing?
[00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.851]  What's going on out here?
[00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:15.032]  Who are you?
[00:26:16.633 --> 00:26:17.974]  Well, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:20.857]  Get in your car and get out of here!
[00:26:22.698 --> 00:26:23.118]  And just...
[00:26:24.008 --> 00:26:24.768]  He looked crazy.
[00:26:24.808 --> 00:26:25.888]  He's showing his teeth at me.
[00:26:25.968 --> 00:26:28.229]  Get in your car and get out of here!
[00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:29.149]  Pointing his finger at me.
[00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:31.990]  And I was... I knew that was what was going to happen.
[00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.370]  I was hoping it wouldn't happen.
[00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.011]  I was hoping he'd be a good human being and a guardian of liberty.
[00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:39.931]  But he's just a midget on a power trip.
[00:26:42.632 --> 00:26:51.474]  A guy in a John Wayne outfit, who's no John Wayne, out there in his John Wayne costume, Yosemite Sam,
[00:26:52.847 --> 00:26:59.049]  Yeah, that'll be the new name of Sergeant Baker is Yosemite Sam.
[00:26:59.349 --> 00:27:08.251]  Sergeant Yosemite Sam, state police officer who, I guess, writes tickets to old ladies all day and licks the boots of illegal aliens.
[00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:09.492]  You know, we know they let them go.
[00:27:10.572 --> 00:27:13.753]  And they run from the border when they get shot at by the Mexican troops and cartels.
[00:27:13.793 --> 00:27:18.674]  But, hey, wouldn't you if you had the American cows to milk?
[00:27:20.695 --> 00:27:21.755]  I've forgotten that part of the story.
[00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:27.065]  Right before I turned to leave, as he was saying, you get out of here right now, just enjoy that power.
[00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:28.487]  You slave, you don't ask me anything.
[00:27:28.728 --> 00:27:29.629]  You get out of here!
[00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:32.153]  I looked at his name tag.
[00:27:33.968 --> 00:27:35.569]  But his badge number was covered up.
[00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:42.353]  They always have some little excuse or someone they're remembering to cover up the badge number, which is a violation of state law.
[00:27:42.393 --> 00:27:44.614]  It's the religion to break the law for these people.
[00:27:45.595 --> 00:27:46.835]  But they're the good guys.
[00:27:46.855 --> 00:27:48.256]  They get to do whatever they want.
[00:27:48.636 --> 00:27:51.338]  And I said, so it's Trooper Baker.
[00:27:51.918 --> 00:27:54.139]  And he said, it's Sergeant Baker!
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.561]  Now I said, get out of here!
[00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:58.602]  It's none of your business!
[00:28:00.794 --> 00:28:07.119]  And he was thinking, your only business is to pay my check and build up my ego when I pull your wife and kids over, boy.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:16.087]  He didn't say that, but I remember driving down 37 four or five years ago, going to Port Aransas to do some fishing with my wife and children.
[00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:24.313]  And my two children at the time, now I have three, were asleep in the back, all belted in with their little, little blankets on them.
[00:28:25.174 --> 00:28:28.517]  These two state police pull us over, we're going five miles over the speed limit.
[00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:31.069]  And they're saying, we want the back.
[00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:33.250]  We want to look and see if these seat belts are on right.
[00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.431]  These kids are in the seats right.
[00:28:35.051 --> 00:28:41.253]  And one had horrible breath, and the woman was on a power trip, and they were all acting crazed like they were wolves chasing down a sheep.
[00:28:42.013 --> 00:28:45.354]  And I just said, look, you don't have any probable cause.
[00:28:45.394 --> 00:28:46.375]  My children are belted in.
[00:28:46.395 --> 00:28:47.215]  They're my children.
[00:28:47.475 --> 00:28:48.895]  I care about them a lot more than you do.
[00:28:49.155 --> 00:28:53.417]  I go, you write me your ticket, and then you let me go back on my way.
[00:28:55.543 --> 00:29:04.973]  They got all puffed up, but I mean, you know, and I told him, I looked him right in the face when he was getting in my face and I said, go ahead and arrest me then and show me I'm your slave.
[00:29:06.675 --> 00:29:07.516]  I don't care.
[00:29:07.696 --> 00:29:08.477]  You understand that?
[00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:10.642]  I don't care.
[00:29:10.662 --> 00:29:11.763]  I don't care.
[00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:12.703]  Okay?
[00:29:12.944 --> 00:29:14.225]  I'm a real American.
[00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:20.770]  You may be trained, and we've got the state federal training manuals, that the founding fathers are terrorists and America's bad and everything.
[00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.470]  Okay, fine.
[00:29:21.911 --> 00:29:24.633]  But the issue is, I'm done licking your boots.
[00:29:25.273 --> 00:29:26.855]  You work for a criminal government.
[00:29:27.515 --> 00:29:38.440]  The state's completely out of control, and you won't defend our borders, and all you're doing is out there revenue generating, and all over the country, state police, local police are announcing they won't respond to regular crime.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.021]  They'll only respond to sucking our blood.
[00:29:42.462 --> 00:29:50.125]  And so, Sergeant Baker, out in Lakeway, Sergeant Yosemite Power Trippin' Sam.
[00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:51.646]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:53.647]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.661 --> 00:29:57.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.063 --> 00:30:04.306]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.606 --> 00:30:05.206]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.526 --> 00:30:08.688]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:09.509]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:14.372]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.153]  It's true.
[00:30:15.453 --> 00:30:19.996]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.316 --> 00:30:20.856]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.136 --> 00:30:24.418]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.739 --> 00:30:28.441]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:29.181]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.422 --> 00:30:31.783]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.183 --> 00:30:35.585]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.865 --> 00:30:36.406]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:40.588]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.808 --> 00:30:45.571]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:49.873]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.033 --> 00:30:51.594]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.814 --> 00:30:53.895]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.055 --> 00:30:56.657]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:30:56.677 --> 00:31:01.119]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.139 --> 00:31:04.321]  Remember when I said you spell freedom F-O-O-D?
[00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:05.201]  It's really true.
[00:31:05.481 --> 00:31:09.343]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food.
[00:31:09.643 --> 00:31:14.846]  And a record number of Americans, over 43 million, depend on the government to feed themselves.
[00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:16.948]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[00:31:17.168 --> 00:31:20.391]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:31:20.571 --> 00:31:23.815]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[00:31:24.095 --> 00:31:32.083]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality storable food.
[00:31:32.243 --> 00:31:39.109]  Because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special, eFoodsDirect.com will continue this special until September 27th.
[00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.791]  Right now, you can buy three and get one free at the old prices.
[00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.972]  But move fast, because this offer ends September 27th.
[00:31:46.012 --> 00:31:46.432]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:46.492 --> 00:31:48.633]  Or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:48.653 --> 00:31:49.233]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:31:49.253 --> 00:31:52.455]  Or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:05.550]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.572]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:11.952 --> 00:32:18.715]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:20.676 --> 00:32:22.956]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:32:24.737 --> 00:32:27.038]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:40.713]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:40.973 --> 00:32:42.475]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:42.755 --> 00:32:45.317]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:45.637 --> 00:32:51.901]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:54.483]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:54.963 --> 00:32:56.384]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:56.564 --> 00:32:57.005]  Got it.
[00:32:57.345 --> 00:32:57.825]  Others don't.
[00:33:04.972 --> 00:33:05.713]  Big Brother.
[00:33:07.094 --> 00:33:08.376]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:09.857 --> 00:33:10.998]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.441]  You want answers?
[00:33:14.382 --> 00:33:15.383]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:22.610]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:47.531]  How dare I, a lowly serf, a slave, dare approach Royal State Police, guardians of the bankers, guardians of the criminal government, and dare politely ask them what they were doing, basically blocking part of the road with their squad cars parked out on both sides of the street with a tent running around out in the street.
[00:33:48.513 --> 00:33:49.714]  How dare I?
[00:33:50.054 --> 00:33:51.315]  It's none of your business!
[00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:52.856]  Get out of here!
[00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:54.177]  Get in your car!
[00:33:54.297 --> 00:33:57.379]  And he was just baring his teeth and enjoying it.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.241]  This is when I was being polite.
[00:34:02.843 --> 00:34:05.065]  But I gave him a look to let him know I wasn't a slave.
[00:34:05.325 --> 00:34:08.407]  And I'm letting him know right now, you're not going to be able to shut down the alternative media.
[00:34:08.727 --> 00:34:13.331]  Your federal bosses are trying to pass a cybersecurity act to shut down the web and shut down free speech.
[00:34:14.229 --> 00:34:20.554]  I don't want to tell bad police, people who are on power trips, people that get into it because they enjoy exercising power over people.
[00:34:21.115 --> 00:34:21.615]  Don't worry.
[00:34:21.655 --> 00:34:23.196]  You think you're big and bad and tough?
[00:34:23.977 --> 00:34:27.620]  Your bosses above you are going to take all your pension funds and you're going to love it.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.203]  They're already taking all the dead veterans' benefits, stealing them.
[00:34:31.223 --> 00:34:32.083]  That's mainstream news.
[00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:36.112]  They're already destroying the country and they're going to destroy you right along with it.
[00:34:36.392 --> 00:34:37.973]  So you go ahead and think you're on the winning team.
[00:34:38.293 --> 00:34:41.995]  You go ahead and enjoy your embarrassing power trip.
[00:34:42.555 --> 00:34:47.118]  You know, why is it that big cops, I've never seen them be out of control.
[00:34:47.178 --> 00:34:55.262]  It's always midget men or little tiny women, and a lot of little cops are nice too, that are completely out of their minds.
[00:34:56.943 --> 00:34:58.184]  Because they got something to prove.
[00:34:59.895 --> 00:35:03.339]  And the way he said it, Sergeant Baker!
[00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:06.122]  I mean, he said it, Sergeant Baker!
[00:35:06.142 --> 00:35:09.826]  Oh, oh, I mean, how about King Baker?
[00:35:10.006 --> 00:35:11.247]  How about God Baker?
[00:35:11.647 --> 00:35:13.990]  How about creator of the world?
[00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:14.591]  I mean, how about...
[00:35:15.892 --> 00:35:18.493]  I mean, it's so embarrassing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:19.013 --> 00:35:41.042]  I mean, here we are, on more than 75 AM and FM stations, global shortwave, number one internet show in the world, number one podcast, one of the top channels on YouTube, hundreds of millions of views on YouTube alone, of the top five or six downloaded films in history, three or four of them are mine, and my ego gets smaller.
[00:35:42.219 --> 00:35:46.963]  Oh, I'm aggressive, I'm confident, I'm assertive, but I realize the power I have.
[00:35:47.964 --> 00:35:49.445]  I realize the responsibility I have.
[00:35:50.346 --> 00:35:57.312]  And then some guy's mad, I guess, that he is five feet tall or whatever, and maybe people were mean to him in high school.
[00:35:57.472 --> 00:35:58.033]  I don't know.
[00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:00.555]  And I'm not a big guy.
[00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:01.756]  I'm 5'10", 240 pounds.
[00:36:06.277 --> 00:36:07.198]  Big muscle wise.
[00:36:07.758 --> 00:36:13.282]  But the point is, what was so intimidating when a nice good old boy walks up and, how you doing troopers?
[00:36:13.302 --> 00:36:14.283]  What's going on here?
[00:36:14.343 --> 00:36:15.484]  You know, blocking the road.
[00:36:15.504 --> 00:36:16.564]  They're all over the street.
[00:36:17.025 --> 00:36:19.206]  They're out here with a tent set up.
[00:36:20.867 --> 00:36:23.469]  And that guy was just looking at me with hate.
[00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.891]  And that's what tyranny is.
[00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:28.833]  It's that entitlement.
[00:36:30.749 --> 00:36:34.292]  And I've been having demonstrations and rallies at the state capitol.
[00:36:34.452 --> 00:36:37.095]  I've been down there for more than 17 years, on air for 15.
[00:36:37.575 --> 00:36:40.798]  And those state police were so nice ten years ago.
[00:36:41.278 --> 00:36:43.460]  They were listeners, they were all great.
[00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:49.605]  We've had rallies down there the last three or four years, and I'll walk over while somebody's speaking, hey, how you doing Trooper?
[00:36:50.006 --> 00:36:52.848]  And they'll just, leave me alone, I'm not talking to you.
[00:36:53.328 --> 00:36:54.349]  In fact, let me see your ID.
[00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:55.811]  We've got video of that with Aaron Dykes.
[00:36:56.031 --> 00:36:56.691]  Give me your ID.
[00:36:57.867 --> 00:37:01.148]  Because they are promoting the ones that hate the citizens.
[00:37:01.608 --> 00:37:05.428]  They are promoting the ones that are cowardly and weak and have no honor.
[00:37:05.908 --> 00:37:09.969]  They are promoting people who... I'm a sergeant!
[00:37:10.649 --> 00:37:11.689]  I'm a sergeant!
[00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:16.750]  And you are a scumbag citizen.
[00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:23.751]  At the bottom of the barrel is citizens, then it's illegal aliens, then it's bureaucrats and cops, then it's bankers and crooks.
[00:37:24.431 --> 00:37:27.172]  And they can do whatever they want in this country.
[00:37:32.663 --> 00:37:35.985]  And that's what all the John Wayne outfits and the fancy uniforms are about.
[00:37:36.025 --> 00:37:36.926]  It's about status.
[00:37:37.627 --> 00:37:38.727]  Government is the status.
[00:37:39.168 --> 00:37:43.331]  And government is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:37:43.751 --> 00:37:44.571]  You know who said that?
[00:37:45.372 --> 00:37:56.540]  George Washington, and I have FEMA on video in Kansas City, sent to me by a firefighter, to firefighters, police, and state police, with FEMA telling him George Washington was a terrorist.
[00:37:59.042 --> 00:38:06.828]  Government is a dangerous servant and a fearful master, like fire, not easily controlled.
[00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:08.129]  In fact, I'm paraphrasing that.
[00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:13.694]  We pull up the terrorist, according to these people, George Washington.
[00:38:13.714 --> 00:38:22.561]  Do you think George Washington would, somebody walked up to him when he was a militia commander and said, what are you, what's going on here?
[00:38:24.008 --> 00:38:25.789]  You guys got a checkpoint here on this dirt road.
[00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:26.389]  What's going on?
[00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.311]  You think he'd say, get out of here!
[00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:29.711]  It's none of your business!
[00:38:30.292 --> 00:38:31.552]  Get out of here!
[00:38:34.414 --> 00:38:35.515]  And I watch police.
[00:38:35.955 --> 00:38:42.539]  I see them pull over two middle-aged, one of them looked like she was 75, old women.
[00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:50.116]  Now that's some other article about George Washington was a terrorist.
[00:38:50.776 --> 00:38:55.160]  Pull up George Washington quote, government is a dangerous servant, fearful master.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.141]  I can't remember the rest of the quote.
[00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.063]  I want to quote the terrorist properly.
[00:39:00.484 --> 00:39:02.165]  And I was ashamed for him.
[00:39:03.486 --> 00:39:07.689]  But see, the globalists, the globalists want us to be ashamed of the police.
[00:39:08.564 --> 00:39:09.625]  This is the psychology.
[00:39:09.846 --> 00:39:11.167]  They train them to act like thugs.
[00:39:11.187 --> 00:39:12.268]  They train them to be abusive.
[00:39:12.288 --> 00:39:13.530]  They train them to violate rights.
[00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.911]  They train them to be callous.
[00:39:15.412 --> 00:39:17.474]  They train them to be an us-against-them mentality.
[00:39:18.195 --> 00:39:19.957]  Then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.802]  And the public starts disliking them.
[00:39:24.102 --> 00:39:26.765]  And the feds, with their training, say, see, they don't like you.
[00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.267]  You've all got to stick together.
[00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:31.909]  And it's basically gang mentality.
[00:39:32.489 --> 00:39:34.090]  It's the biggest street gang in the world.
[00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.451]  And it's growing and growing and growing and growing.
[00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:44.554]  And everything that's being done in the public schools and the airports and everywhere are these testing grounds, they admit, to train you to be a total prisoner.
[00:39:44.895 --> 00:39:45.635]  They found the quote.
[00:39:45.675 --> 00:39:48.036]  Let's put it back up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:39:48.376 --> 00:39:49.437]  Government is not reason.
[00:39:49.477 --> 00:39:50.277]  It is not eloquence.
[00:39:50.337 --> 00:39:50.857]  It is force.
[00:39:51.217 --> 00:39:54.379]  Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:58.766]  Let's read that quote again for people.
[00:39:59.307 --> 00:40:02.009]  Now you're either with George Washington or you're against George Washington.
[00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:04.711]  You either think that's extremist talk or it isn't.
[00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:05.672]  Let's put it back on screen.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.801]  And a fearful master.
[00:40:17.901 --> 00:40:20.723]  And government is now trying to be our master.
[00:40:21.483 --> 00:40:23.825]  Every other country in history turns into tyranny.
[00:40:24.205 --> 00:40:30.389]  Every other country has an elite come in that paramilitarizes the police and uses the military against the public.
[00:40:31.696 --> 00:40:37.321]  Every country sets up secret police and tattletale squads and demonization of people who don't like it.
[00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:43.466]  Every government seeks to control farms and ranches and agrarian areas to dominate the public.
[00:40:44.206 --> 00:40:50.451]  If you go down a checklist of tyranny, they are checking each box off repeatedly and adding new boxes.
[00:40:52.113 --> 00:40:53.073]  No one can deny
[00:40:53.953 --> 00:40:55.094]  That this country's in trouble.
[00:40:55.254 --> 00:40:57.375]  And I got news for the globalists and all their minions.
[00:40:57.535 --> 00:40:57.936]  It's over.
[00:40:58.296 --> 00:40:59.257]  The people are waking up.
[00:40:59.717 --> 00:41:08.563]  No amount of staged terror attacks, no amount of new wars, no amount of flu hysteria, no amount of the crises you create are going to put the genie back in the bottle.
[00:41:08.983 --> 00:41:11.945]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:41:12.005 --> 00:41:13.587]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:41:14.027 --> 00:41:19.671]  All the king's horses and all the king's men aren't putting your stinking little tyranny back together again.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.984]  Congress can pass laws giving the UN control over our waterways and our lakes.
[00:41:25.644 --> 00:41:28.186]  You can pass laws to not let us drill water wells.
[00:41:28.406 --> 00:41:30.448]  People are just going to stop following what you have to say.
[00:41:30.708 --> 00:41:40.637]  And as you back them up against a wall, because you want to raise the taxes and put satellite tracker boxes on all the cars to track and trace us and control us, it isn't going to work.
[00:41:41.437 --> 00:41:41.657]  Okay?
[00:41:42.737 --> 00:41:44.741]  And they are psychologically profiling.
[00:41:44.761 --> 00:41:46.203]  Every time I mention this, people don't believe me.
[00:41:46.243 --> 00:41:46.985]  It's so outrageous.
[00:41:47.566 --> 00:41:48.167]  I don't blame you.
[00:41:48.748 --> 00:41:51.573]  In fact, guys, it's MSNBC's first one that comes up.
[00:41:55.387 --> 00:41:59.570]  Police Department, because IQ too high, will pull up some of the articles.
[00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.091]  There's been many of these suits.
[00:42:01.471 --> 00:42:06.555]  And they tell them, your IQ is 102, which is just above average.
[00:42:08.136 --> 00:42:10.257]  I mean, there's people with 190 IQs, folks.
[00:42:10.877 --> 00:42:12.058]  And so we're not going to hire you.
[00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:16.121]  That's a policy that was done secretly through federal funds about 20 years ago.
[00:42:16.421 --> 00:42:17.102]  It's now public.
[00:42:17.922 --> 00:42:19.223]  And now they're trying to lower it to 90.
[00:42:19.443 --> 00:42:21.645]  I mean, 90 is not...
[00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:23.482]  Very smart.
[00:42:23.542 --> 00:42:24.362]  Pretty, pretty dull.
[00:42:24.923 --> 00:42:26.044]  I mean, what soon?
[00:42:26.084 --> 00:42:28.986]  Will they get folks with 70 IQs?
[00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:29.547]  Probably.
[00:42:31.008 --> 00:42:31.489]  Probably.
[00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.731]  Me boss now!
[00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:35.152]  You don't ask!
[00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:38.835]  You don't ask Sergeant Baker questions!
[00:42:39.155 --> 00:42:40.216]  You lick boots!
[00:42:40.597 --> 00:42:42.658]  You polish boots off Baker!
[00:42:43.669 --> 00:42:45.530]  You see my cowboy hat!
[00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.070]  I am tough!
[00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.271]  You don't ask me questions!
[00:42:49.591 --> 00:42:52.813]  You're supposed to be afraid of Sergeant Baker!
[00:42:55.374 --> 00:42:57.154]  What was the other Thomas Jefferson quote?
[00:42:57.234 --> 00:42:59.395]  Another terrorist, according to, I guess, the state police.
[00:43:00.095 --> 00:43:04.257]  And the filthy government we've got that's delusional and believes all its own propaganda.
[00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.379]  Liberty is a
[00:43:10.742 --> 00:43:12.443]  Let me give you the exact quote.
[00:43:12.483 --> 00:43:13.824]  Guys, in fact, pull it up and double-check me.
[00:43:14.144 --> 00:43:20.588]  Thomas Jefferson, when the government fears the people, we have liberty.
[00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:24.091]  When the government fears the people, we have liberty.
[00:43:24.671 --> 00:43:27.293]  When the people fear the government, we have tyranny.
[00:43:30.195 --> 00:43:30.995]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:43:32.056 --> 00:43:34.017]  I'm going to continue to quote terrorists here on air.
[00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:36.479]  Okay?
[00:43:36.819 --> 00:43:39.201]  Remember, the feds are teaching nationwide that
[00:43:40.091 --> 00:43:41.452]  Anything good is terrorism.
[00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:54.361]  And remember, the whole Homeland Security report, sent to us by good state police, and good federal marshal, good people, remember that?
[00:43:54.401 --> 00:44:03.488]  National News said the entire Homeland Security apparatus is for conservatives, gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians,
[00:44:08.314 --> 00:44:09.014]  It's for you.
[00:44:09.335 --> 00:44:14.117]  You're told it's for men in caves that are funded by the CIA, that if you don't give your rights up, they'll come get you.
[00:44:14.157 --> 00:44:14.297]  No.
[00:44:14.797 --> 00:44:15.557]  It's for you.
[00:44:16.078 --> 00:44:16.898]  It's for you.
[00:44:17.258 --> 00:44:18.699]  And the police want you to know that.
[00:44:19.339 --> 00:44:29.004]  Now, a lot of them are good men and women and aren't going along with the programming, but the programming, the directive, is to slap us around, like they're the pimp and we're the prostitute, and they're going to let us know.
[00:44:29.624 --> 00:44:30.905]  Put the quote back up for me, please.
[00:44:33.126 --> 00:44:35.647]  When the people fear their government, there is
[00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:37.329]  Tyranny.
[00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.652]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:44:42.953 --> 00:44:47.377]  And that doesn't say in the quote, that somebody wrote that in an article, somebody flipped the Thomas Jefferson.
[00:44:49.618 --> 00:44:51.820]  Oh, so that's a Thomas Jefferson quote, so I guess I flipped it.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.141]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:56.243]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:44:56.263 --> 00:45:04.429]  I mean, what do you think Thomas Jefferson would have thought if he was in a time machine and he was teleported to the morning of
[00:45:05.737 --> 00:45:28.494]  September 23rd, 2010, and if he could be floating around in the clouds, teleported into the future, 200 plus years, and he sees Alex Jones pull over, parked down a street, I'm in a neighborhood, and I politely walk up and put on my charm, and I was thinking, I hope they're good.
[00:45:28.715 --> 00:45:29.355]  I hope they're good.
[00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:31.397]  I want to find out, A, if this is an illegal checkpoint.
[00:45:32.366 --> 00:45:33.786]  But B, I want to see how they treat me.
[00:45:33.806 --> 00:45:36.487]  And I was thinking, man, I hope they're good, but I got a bad feeling.
[00:45:37.408 --> 00:45:40.108]  And I just said, hi, hey, troopers, how's it going?
[00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:42.009]  What's going on here?
[00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:44.670]  How dare an Al Qaeda?
[00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:45.990]  How dare a combatant?
[00:45:48.071 --> 00:45:49.531]  How dare somebody that can talk?
[00:45:50.632 --> 00:46:00.755]  The citizens are supposed to drive by scared and see the cops and get scared and go in the checkpoints and be asked questions and be put in naked body scanners where they illegally record your genitals and then lied about it and got caught.
[00:46:01.817 --> 00:46:02.677]  It's a criminal government.
[00:46:03.598 --> 00:46:05.359]  They lie even when the truth would suit them better.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.642]  And I politely was humiliated.
[00:46:13.442 --> 00:46:15.023]  But I wasn't humiliated in the way he thought.
[00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:16.544]  I was humiliated for this country.
[00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:18.665]  I was humiliated for my children's future.
[00:46:20.205 --> 00:46:31.194]  I was humiliated by petty nobodies putting thuggish positions of abusive power to boss citizens around with relish and enjoyment and treat me like trash.
[00:46:31.234 --> 00:46:33.837]  That guy was savoring baring his teeth.
[00:46:34.117 --> 00:46:40.362]  He was savoring his eyes just gleaming with hatred like I had, you know, slapped his grandmother or something.
[00:46:40.422 --> 00:46:46.227]  I mean, this was anger and hate and disgust that I could barely even summon for my enemies.
[00:46:46.787 --> 00:46:48.149]  But it summoned in me
[00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:51.300]  Just total disgust.
[00:47:10.467 --> 00:47:12.730]  Nothing compared to what this guy did.
[00:47:13.071 --> 00:47:14.753]  Fade up the audio of this guy talking to Aaron.
[00:47:15.113 --> 00:47:16.075]  From where you had it, it was good.
[00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:17.436]  You don't have any of that.
[00:47:17.797 --> 00:47:18.618]  Why are you asking?
[00:47:18.978 --> 00:47:19.980]  Because that's my job.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.281]  I'm asking you again.
[00:47:21.542 --> 00:47:22.263]  Do you have an ID?
[00:47:23.819 --> 00:47:26.241]  Where's your driver's license at?
[00:47:26.302 --> 00:47:28.543]  I need to see it then.
[00:47:28.583 --> 00:47:31.086]  He sounds calm, but his eyes are angry.
[00:47:31.526 --> 00:47:37.871]  This cop was 100 times, I mean, seething with what I would call demonic hatred.
[00:47:38.612 --> 00:47:38.992]  Hey!
[00:47:39.212 --> 00:47:40.073]  What's going on here?
[00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:41.454]  What are you doing?
[00:47:42.375 --> 00:47:43.396]  I'm just seeing what's going on.
[00:47:43.976 --> 00:47:44.837]  It's none of your business.
[00:47:44.857 --> 00:47:45.578]  Get in your car!
[00:47:45.838 --> 00:47:46.438]  Get out of here!
[00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:48.259]  Get out of here!
[00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:54.464]  I mean, this is the same type of angry energy that you would expect from Davy Crockett defending the Alamo.
[00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:57.986]  This is hatred you summon up when you're fighting for your life.
[00:47:58.046 --> 00:48:02.670]  And I guess he was fighting for his life because his life is being a thug.
[00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:05.272]  That's his way of life.
[00:48:05.412 --> 00:48:13.719]  And he felt it was threatened by a polite, congenial, well-dressed person having good feelings for him.
[00:48:17.642 --> 00:48:18.623]  And they think they're going to win.
[00:48:18.663 --> 00:48:20.305]  They think they're going to bring this country down.
[00:48:20.645 --> 00:48:22.106]  They think they've got it all figured out.
[00:48:23.728 --> 00:48:31.095]  At the surface of their consciousness, at the surface of their consciousness, they're the guardians of us.
[00:48:33.337 --> 00:48:38.002]  But deep down with a control freak like Yosemite Sam Sergeant Baker,
[00:48:40.401 --> 00:48:42.481]  He probably already got a nickname like Yosemite Sam.
[00:48:42.902 --> 00:48:44.562]  Some of the other guys obviously knew who I was.
[00:48:44.602 --> 00:48:46.702]  They were smiling at first and looking.
[00:48:47.403 --> 00:48:52.864]  By the time I got in my car and drove back, he was up there just looking at me, calling in my plates.
[00:48:53.044 --> 00:48:54.044]  Oh, he was going to get me.
[00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:55.824]  Oh, yeah.
[00:48:55.945 --> 00:49:01.926]  Oh, and they got that Travis County Sheriff to get behind me and let me know I'm being watched, boy.
[00:49:02.796 --> 00:49:09.461]  In fact, pull up the Philadelphia, uh, Pennsylvania ad where they say, we're watching you with satellites.
[00:49:09.481 --> 00:49:10.841]  We're going to get our money from you.
[00:49:11.062 --> 00:49:13.884]  They want you to know that you're being watched.
[00:49:13.944 --> 00:49:16.685]  They want you to know you're being controlled.
[00:49:19.047 --> 00:49:21.409]  Remember they denied the satellites were being used against citizens?
[00:49:21.669 --> 00:49:23.390]  Now they're harassing farmers and ranchers with it?
[00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.852]  It's always because it's the law.
[00:49:26.152 --> 00:49:27.353]  It's the rules.
[00:49:28.715 --> 00:49:32.459]  But then when the Federal Reserve gets up and Congress says, where's the trillions of dollars?
[00:49:32.499 --> 00:49:33.660]  They say, we're not going to tell you.
[00:49:35.963 --> 00:49:38.646]  No, you're there to protect the criminal status quo.
[00:49:39.126 --> 00:49:40.808]  And the status quo is getting worse.
[00:49:41.129 --> 00:49:43.972]  Let's go ahead and play this clip where they're intimidating us, letting us know we're being watched.
[00:49:45.609 --> 00:49:48.291]  Miss Tom, you live just off of 5th Street.
[00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:49.452]  Nice car, Tom.
[00:49:49.732 --> 00:49:50.432]  Nice house.
[00:49:50.632 --> 00:49:56.697]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[00:49:57.317 --> 00:49:59.599]  Listen, Tom, we can make this easy.
[00:50:00.099 --> 00:50:05.583]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[00:50:06.543 --> 00:50:09.886]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[00:50:11.462 --> 00:50:12.683]  Find us before we find you.
[00:50:12.723 --> 00:50:14.404]  And they have these announcements nationwide.
[00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:17.447]  More than 10% of Texas has warrants out for them with all the petty stuff.
[00:50:17.507 --> 00:50:18.748]  They can't pay because we're imploding.
[00:50:19.548 --> 00:50:20.549]  And they run ads.
[00:50:20.629 --> 00:50:21.790]  Roundup coming up next week.
[00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:22.190]  Roundup.
[00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.571]  Roundup.
[00:50:22.591 --> 00:50:27.835]  So when they have real political roundups, all the sheep have just heard the term roundup over and over again.
[00:50:30.196 --> 00:50:36.861]  And of course, again, Bloomberg reported last week that 6 million veterans going back to World War II
[00:50:38.134 --> 00:50:42.176]  When they die, their death benefits are being stolen in agreement with the government and prudential.
[00:50:43.936 --> 00:50:44.536]  So don't worry.
[00:50:44.957 --> 00:50:56.181]  You've been given power to shove us around and make us lick your boots because your masters are going to implode this country and carry out a Stalinistic operation.
[00:50:57.121 --> 00:50:58.982]  And your masters are going to come after you.
[00:51:00.632 --> 00:51:02.753]  Do you know someone who's a Constitution basher?
[00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:06.054]  Then here's the ammo you need to silence them once and for all!
[00:51:06.294 --> 00:51:08.155]  Introducing the Crash Course of the U.S.
[00:51:08.215 --> 00:51:13.057]  Constitution, How to Argue with a Liberal About Constitutional Issues and Win Every Time!

[00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:05.742]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.062 --> 00:52:09.724]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.944 --> 00:52:12.205]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.405 --> 00:52:17.668]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.108 --> 00:52:24.391]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:30.314]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.754 --> 00:52:34.416]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:52:34.916 --> 00:52:38.897]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.197 --> 00:52:44.759]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.159 --> 00:52:48.160]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.701 --> 00:52:50.141]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.681 --> 00:52:51.181]  It's here.

[00:54:11.633 --> 00:54:12.954]  I think the song says it all.
[00:54:15.115 --> 00:54:19.758]  Some folks are born, made to wait to fly.
[00:54:20.498 --> 00:54:22.559]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:54:23.139 --> 00:54:24.720]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:32.525]  And when the band plays, hell to the teeth Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:54:36.428 --> 00:54:37.948]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:44.830]  You don't politely ask police what they're doing in a neighborhood with seven squad cars, police running all over the street.
[00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.190]  Clearly some type of checkpoint.
[00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:52.331]  And by the way, I've only been on that road a few times.
[00:54:52.391 --> 00:54:55.392]  It seems I see state police doing stuff there a lot of the time.
[00:54:56.172 --> 00:54:59.873]  I don't know what they're doing out there and I'm not allowed to find out as a scumbag citizen.
[00:55:01.093 --> 00:55:02.893]  I'm here to pay the taxes and lick boots.
[00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.774]  I have mainstream news articles in my stack today
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:12.763]  Where they're giving people jail time and $1,000 a day fines for grass that's over three inches.
[00:55:13.504 --> 00:55:14.284]  All over the country.
[00:55:14.624 --> 00:55:17.226]  Where they're arresting people for gardens in their backyards.
[00:55:18.046 --> 00:55:19.507]  They want to make you criminal.
[00:55:19.807 --> 00:55:20.988]  That's what tyranny does.
[00:55:21.468 --> 00:55:28.592]  And that state police creature... I said, hey, I'm just asking what you're doing.
[00:55:28.612 --> 00:55:30.933]  And he said, hey, you're parked illegally!
[00:55:31.013 --> 00:55:32.014]  I said, get out of here!
[00:55:33.168 --> 00:55:35.149]  By the way, I wasn't parked illegally.
[00:55:35.169 --> 00:55:36.790]  It was a neighborhood.
[00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:45.215]  I was parked on the side of a neighborhood, one-lane street, off a two-lane street, in a neighborhood, with a bunch of state police crawling all over it.
[00:55:47.156 --> 00:56:00.784]  And then this morning, Jaron goes in to buy a Gatorade in South Austin, and some guy, whacked out of his mind, is trying to break into his truck.
[00:56:00.824 --> 00:56:01.764]  He walks out and says,
[00:56:03.732 --> 00:56:05.472]  Starts yelling at him for several minutes.
[00:56:06.592 --> 00:56:08.113]  The guy's able to get into his truck.
[00:56:10.313 --> 00:56:11.653]  Is yelling that it's his car.
[00:56:13.914 --> 00:56:15.154]  Starts attacking Jaron.
[00:56:15.174 --> 00:56:16.694]  Jaron has to knock him out.
[00:56:18.755 --> 00:56:25.896]  And then the police show up and say, yeah, I heard you yell and saw this going on.
[00:56:26.576 --> 00:56:32.897]  One of the cops were right there on Lamar and just drove past because he wasn't, there was no money to be made.
[00:56:37.642 --> 00:56:40.965]  Look, police, you live in this country.
[00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:43.707]  Have you studied Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia?
[00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.888]  Do you know about countries going bad?
[00:56:45.908 --> 00:56:49.611]  Do you know about what the Redcoats were doing to our ancestors when they stood up to them?
[00:56:50.452 --> 00:56:51.252]  Do you understand that?
[00:56:51.392 --> 00:57:03.562]  I mean, I have mainstream news articles on PrisonPlanet.com today, where all over the country, the federal government and foreign intelligence agencies are compiling lists of mainline Second Amendment groups, and the Pittsburgh
[00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:10.926]  Post Gazette reports that the one group is headed up by a state representative and he's on the list.
[00:57:11.546 --> 00:57:17.591]  And of course, it came out in England that the Parliament is spied on by MI5.
[00:57:18.592 --> 00:57:22.195]  The Parliament is the government, but the bureaucracy is the real government.
[00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:29.205]  And all these crook politicians are taking the federal training to their police to treat us like trash.
[00:57:29.805 --> 00:57:31.427]  So, don't say you weren't warned.
[00:57:31.467 --> 00:57:41.615]  If we can't save this country and this planet, a lot of it rests on you, police, because you're where the rubber meets the road, and you are shameful when you act like that lunatic.
[00:57:42.395 --> 00:57:43.236]  Now, I'll say this.
[00:57:45.018 --> 00:57:51.583]  I've had the good luck of not having too many wrecks in the last 20 years, but the two wrecks I've had
[00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:54.673]  One time blowing off the road by a tornado.
[00:57:55.885 --> 00:58:07.414]  The state police of Texas pulled up outside Fredericksburg, actually it was Stonewall, were fans of the show, were incredibly helpful, helped pick up the stuff out of the Tahoe that was all wrecked and smashed.
[00:58:07.434 --> 00:58:10.116]  My paperwork were very nice and very helpful.
[00:58:10.796 --> 00:58:12.938]  And I was in another wreck and the state police were very nice.
[00:58:13.378 --> 00:58:20.844]  I was speeding 10 miles over the speed limit and a black DPS guy pulled me over in Temple and said, well, you were so polite Alex, I'm going to let you go.
[00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:23.386]  I mean, look, I don't want to be your enemy.
[00:58:25.154 --> 00:58:31.539]  I'm sure you'd be nice to go fishing with, Sergeant Baker, but you ought to really look in the mirror and ask yourself why you're out of control.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.063]  Because I bet your grandparents, I bet Papa Smurf would be ashamed of you.
[00:58:37.724 --> 00:58:39.025]  I bet your granddaddy would be ashamed of you.

[01:00:12.211 --> 01:00:16.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:21.116]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:29.461]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we found some video of the state police officer that pulled me over
[01:00:33.432 --> 01:00:34.254]  I'm just joking.
[01:00:34.996 --> 01:00:36.782]  We're showing video of the Smurfs.
[01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:40.734]  The more I think about it, he looked like a cross between Yosemite Sam and Papa Smurf.
[01:00:42.193 --> 01:00:43.053]  All right, I'm joking around.
[01:00:43.093 --> 01:00:43.573]  I shouldn't be.
[01:00:44.314 --> 01:00:52.716]  It was actually very, very sickening to see an illegal checkpoint, where it appeared to be this morning, they wouldn't tell me, and to have them get in my face and treat me like a piece of trash.
[01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:53.857]  I was very polite.
[01:00:54.257 --> 01:00:57.018]  Gold is up $4 a day to $1,295 an ounce.
[01:00:57.038 --> 01:01:02.239]  And it's way over that what you can actually buy it for in the market.
[01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.420]  Shortages have begun.
[01:01:04.907 --> 01:01:07.349]  And the dollar is being devalued.
[01:01:07.369 --> 01:01:13.113]  The Federal Reserve is involved in more quantitative easing, more printing of money.
[01:01:14.554 --> 01:01:17.836]  That's what happened to Mexico, what happened to Zimbabwe, Weimar Republic, Germany.
[01:01:18.977 --> 01:01:20.759]  And they are now buying more and more of U.S.
[01:01:21.239 --> 01:01:21.639]  bonds.
[01:01:22.059 --> 01:01:22.800]  Nobody will buy them.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.641]  Foreign governments, individuals won't buy them.
[01:01:25.322 --> 01:01:27.844]  So gold's going up because the dollar's being devalued.
[01:01:28.874 --> 01:01:48.468]  And I wanted to briefly, ahead of this historian joining us in the next segment on Mao Tse Tung and what we're going to face in this country, there's no doubt about it, it's the same people that ran Mao running this, I wanted to bring Ted up briefly because he ran out of the deals of gold and silver he bought a few months ago that was priced into the market $30, $40, $50, $60 depending on the deal under
[01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.030]  You know, what it should have been selling for.
[01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:56.515]  He's still got some he bought a few weeks ago that is way under what anybody else can sell it to you for.
[01:01:57.375 --> 01:02:00.978]  And so to tell us about what's happening in the gold market briefly is Ted Anderson.
[01:02:00.998 --> 01:02:01.879]  Ted, thanks for joining us.
[01:02:02.279 --> 01:02:03.780]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me up again.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:10.566]  And yeah, like you said, Alex, the Fed is stepping in and that's driving the dollar down, it's driving gold up.
[01:02:11.406 --> 01:02:13.928]  Right now we do have the franc currently at $279.
[01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:18.372]  You do get the full year subscription to the International Forecaster when you buy that.
[01:02:19.032 --> 01:02:27.736]  So, it really discounts it down to about $560 gold, considering the fact that gold's almost $1,300 an ounce today.
[01:02:28.217 --> 01:02:30.398]  That is one wonderful buy.
[01:02:31.058 --> 01:02:33.719]  Walking Liberty halves at $10.50, another great buy.
[01:02:34.199 --> 01:02:35.220]  British Sovereign's at $3.57.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.903]  A lot of people are calling, Alex, for that CBO report, which makes me real happy.
[01:02:41.703 --> 01:02:47.526]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document, which came out of the government,
[01:02:48.046 --> 01:02:53.388]  You know, you just... Ted, what you ought to give out is the Pentagon two weeks ago saying that they believe the U.S.
[01:02:53.448 --> 01:02:54.989]  is going to collapse because of the debt.
[01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:56.930]  Well, that's actually the banker's plan.
[01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.731]  We have the 2002 IMF World Bank documents.
[01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:07.954]  They create the crisis, they offer the solution, giving themselves more power, and these Yosemite Sam police then are more than happy to bully the public.
[01:03:08.482 --> 01:03:15.526]  Well, you know, I really should take a look at that document because nothing makes me more happy than to have the government expose itself in their evil plan.
[01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:19.809]  Yeah, but they're only exposing it to say, see, we better enslave you because we stole everything.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:20.920]  Right, exactly.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.461]  Obviously, there's an agenda there.
[01:03:22.921 --> 01:03:27.803]  But, you know, if people wake up and realize that they can't keep themselves in this paper currency anymore.
[01:03:28.163 --> 01:03:33.106]  I mean, the Bloomberg story says that they have to get out, that they have to buy gold and silver.
[01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:38.808]  It's not like, it's not like, you know, Bloomberg, I mean, here he is a stock guy and he's telling people that they have to buy gold and silver.
[01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:40.149]  This is today's story.
[01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:40.729]  And, you know,
[01:03:41.609 --> 01:04:01.677]  It just, it just gets to the point here now where it's just getting utter ridiculous to stay into the paper currencies, the stock market, the bond market, if you're going to be in the annuities, even in the real estate because there's such a bubble there that, you know, it really doesn't make sense to have anything other than gold and silver because that has been money for over 6,000 years.
[01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:10.120]  And that's why it pleases me to see that people are willing to pick up the CBO report coming from Congress and actually get the information that says, yes, indeed, there's
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.423]  Absolutely, but it's on record we're going into a planned depression.
[01:04:13.463 --> 01:04:14.303]  People need to call.
[01:04:14.924 --> 01:04:16.846]  How much are the silver half dollars right now?
[01:04:16.946 --> 01:04:18.047]  Well, right now they're at $10.50.
[01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:21.990]  Okay, everywhere else the lowest is $12 that I've seen.
[01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.171]  A lot of places $16.
[01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:25.233]  How long will it last at $10.50 a piece?
[01:04:25.573 --> 01:04:27.235]  I'm going to hold it for today for sure.
[01:04:27.255 --> 01:04:28.215]  Alright, let me give you the number.
[01:04:29.597 --> 01:04:29.697]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:29.717 --> 01:04:33.222]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:36.046 --> 01:04:38.991]  They've got all sorts of great coins at great prices in gold.
[01:04:39.071 --> 01:04:45.019]  The Franks, the Sovereigns, the Buffalos that are hard to get normally have huge premiums, not with Midas resources.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.782]  Find out the great listings.
[01:04:46.802 --> 01:04:48.985]  Tell them it's the radio offer or you'll pay more.
[01:04:49.205 --> 01:04:50.407]  And that price is still great.
[01:04:50.747 --> 01:04:51.808]  This is smoking 800-686-2237.
[01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:52.069]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:53.371]  Thanks a lot, Ted Anderson.

[01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:53.971]  Thank you!
[01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:03.893]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.213 --> 01:06:04.814]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.134 --> 01:06:08.276]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.557 --> 01:06:09.097]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:13.961]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.301 --> 01:06:14.741]  It's true.
[01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:19.605]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.925 --> 01:06:20.465]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.746 --> 01:06:24.028]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:28.031]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.231 --> 01:06:28.772]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.032 --> 01:06:31.395]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.795 --> 01:06:35.159]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.479 --> 01:06:36.000]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:40.184]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.405 --> 01:06:45.170]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:49.472]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.632 --> 01:06:51.173]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.413 --> 01:06:53.494]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:53.674 --> 01:06:56.855]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:57.276 --> 01:07:00.757]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:00.777 --> 01:07:03.959]  Remember when I said you spell freedom F-O-O-D?
[01:07:04.139 --> 01:07:04.859]  It's really true.
[01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:09.001]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food.
[01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:14.484]  And a record number of Americans, over 43 million, depend on the government to feed themselves.
[01:07:14.724 --> 01:07:16.605]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[01:07:16.806 --> 01:07:20.028]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:23.450]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[01:07:23.751 --> 01:07:34.999]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality storable food because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special.
[01:07:35.339 --> 01:07:39.220]  eFoodsDirect.com will continue this special until September 27th.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.442]  Right now you can buy three and get one free at the old prices, but move fast because this offer ends September 27th.
[01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:48.062]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:48.082 --> 01:07:52.103]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:08:09.372 --> 01:08:11.193]  This is our land.
[01:08:14.014 --> 01:08:17.276]  These are our people.
[01:08:17.316 --> 01:08:18.056]  The workers.
[01:08:18.076 --> 01:08:19.417]  The strivers.
[01:08:19.497 --> 01:08:21.138]  The builders.
[01:08:21.178 --> 01:08:24.900]  These are our people.
[01:08:27.464 --> 01:08:30.506]  Who are they?
[01:08:30.626 --> 01:08:33.427]  They are the Dark Armies.
[01:08:33.487 --> 01:08:37.469]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[01:08:37.509 --> 01:08:38.009]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:40.291]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:00.316 --> 01:09:02.056]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:10.121]  For the balance of this hour, award-winning historian researcher has a book out that's getting a lot of powerful reviews.
[01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:11.761]  The Chinese government
[01:09:13.092 --> 01:09:17.733]  Help compile a book a decade ago or so admitting that Mao killed 80 plus million.
[01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.794]  Our government says he killed 84 million.
[01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:24.315]  But we have one of the leading experts on Mao's mass murder joining us.
[01:09:24.355 --> 01:09:25.556]  Here's a Bloomberg headline.
[01:09:26.176 --> 01:09:27.276]  Starved by Mao.
[01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:28.877]  Cannibal China ate earth.
[01:09:29.057 --> 01:09:29.917]  Robbed graves.
[01:09:31.018 --> 01:09:31.578]  Continuing.
[01:09:31.658 --> 01:09:34.659]  Mao's great leap forward killed 45 million in four years.
[01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:35.439]  London Independent.
[01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.060]  Here's another one.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:37.781]  London Guardian.
[01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:41.567]  Mao's Great Famine by Frank Dikotter.
[01:09:42.449 --> 01:09:48.979]  The horrors of China's Great Leap Forward are unveiled in this masterfully study of the hateful plan.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.363]  Huge stew pots cooking people.
[01:09:53.383 --> 01:09:56.466]  That's what the Chinese books I've read translated into English talk about.
[01:09:57.406 --> 01:10:01.110]  And this was praised by David Rockefeller in 1976 in the New York Times.
[01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:03.612]  This is what big government does.
[01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:06.374]  And according to our government, any criticism of government is terrorism.
[01:10:06.414 --> 01:10:13.500]  So I guess this is the type of system we all need to live under, according to many people that worship big government and collectivism.
[01:10:14.521 --> 01:10:19.767]  But I really appreciate our guests joining us today.
[01:10:20.608 --> 01:10:28.677]  Frank DeCotter is an author of Mao's Great Famine, the History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, published by Bloomsbury and Walker Books.
[01:10:29.178 --> 01:10:37.984]  He's the Chair Professor of Humanities for the University of Hong Kong and Professor of the Modern History of China on leave from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.
[01:10:38.344 --> 01:10:40.646]  Born in the Netherlands in 61, he's educated in Switzerland.
[01:10:41.186 --> 01:10:42.107]  It goes on and on.
[01:10:42.147 --> 01:10:52.754]  He's published nine books that have changed the way historians view modern China, from the classics, the Discourse on Race in Modern China, The China Before Mao, The Age of Openness.
[01:10:53.514 --> 01:10:55.536]  Frank de Kotter is married and lives in Hong Kong.
[01:10:55.556 --> 01:10:56.856]  He's in Rome right now.
[01:10:57.197 --> 01:10:58.718]  Sir, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:00.539]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:02.482]  You've got the floor.
[01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:03.342]  Start at the beginning.
[01:11:03.483 --> 01:11:06.646]  Mao Zedong, the greatest mass murderer in history.
[01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:11.391]  Now they have coffee shops and hotels and eateries named after him.
[01:11:11.411 --> 01:11:12.632]  Young people wear his shirt.
[01:11:12.712 --> 01:11:13.813]  I see it all over the streets.
[01:11:14.554 --> 01:11:19.259]  He's supposedly like Martin Luther King to many people, so I thought we'd have you on.
[01:11:19.299 --> 01:11:20.701]  Tell us about Mao Zedong.
[01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:24.772]  Well, he's a man who conquered China in 1949.
[01:11:24.952 --> 01:11:31.958]  And he's also a man who started the war in Korea against the Americans a few years later.
[01:11:32.638 --> 01:11:39.383]  And hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people lost their lives during those two events.
[01:11:39.764 --> 01:11:40.725]  But they compare
[01:11:41.585 --> 01:11:56.163]  They do not compare to what happened from 1958 onwards, when Mao wanted to turn every man and every woman in that country into a soldier, into one giant army that he could use in a continuous revolution to somehow...
[01:11:56.343 --> 01:12:00.366]  Now, tackle both agriculture and industry at the same time.
[01:12:00.826 --> 01:12:11.413]  So what he did with the Great Leap Forward in 1958 is very much collectivize everything and herd people in the countryside into giant people's communes.
[01:12:12.593 --> 01:12:19.660]  People in the countryside had their homes collectivized, their land was taken away from them, their belongings were stripped away.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:26.186]  They had nothing left except the choice to obey the party commands.
[01:12:26.647 --> 01:12:31.671]  And the party command was to work all day and all night so that the country could be
[01:12:32.692 --> 01:12:34.994]  To overtake England in 15 years.
[01:12:35.074 --> 01:12:35.994]  That was the slogan.
[01:12:36.054 --> 01:12:37.715]  To overtake England in 15 years.
[01:12:38.536 --> 01:12:48.862]  And before you know it, every incentive to work was stripped away and people had no reason to work except the fear of pain and violence.
[01:12:49.623 --> 01:13:00.790]  So in the countryside, party officials and farmers became locked in a mounting spiral of violence in which people were beaten, were
[01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:09.115]  We're covered in excrement, we're sometimes buried alive for the slightest misdemeanor.
[01:13:09.215 --> 01:13:11.597]  Stealing a potato could warrant a death sentence.
[01:13:14.819 --> 01:13:15.720]  Please continue, sir.
[01:13:45.299 --> 01:13:52.082]  So these are massive archives and they illustrate something that is very prevalent during that period.
[01:13:52.122 --> 01:13:55.304]  Namely that food is used as a weapon.
[01:13:55.944 --> 01:13:58.325]  It is not simply that people starve to death.
[01:13:58.425 --> 01:14:01.607]  They are starved to death, very deliberately.
[01:14:01.627 --> 01:14:06.489]  There's a deliberate selection of people who are banned from the canteen.
[01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.451]  Professor, can I interject something here?
[01:14:09.471 --> 01:14:16.435]  Because I know you're very well-read, one of the leading experts on the last 70 years in China.
[01:14:17.395 --> 01:14:24.619]  Have you noticed that they had a Beijing World Food Summit in the mid-1990s, and the UN said, we will use food as a weapon?
[01:14:24.639 --> 01:14:32.444]  And in State Department Memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger, he talked about using the Chinese model in the third world of using food as a weapon.
[01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:36.428]  I don't know about it, but it doesn't sound very promising.
[01:14:36.468 --> 01:14:37.468]  That's all I can say.
[01:14:37.488 --> 01:14:53.522]  Okay, well let's continue then with the model of using food as a weapon, because I happen to have an article here, the Livable Communities Act, and the stated goal is to force people under Agenda 21 into sustainable cities, and only basically allow big agribusiness to operate.
[01:14:53.982 --> 01:14:56.404]  But sorry, I was just drawing parallels to here.
[01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:57.005]  Go ahead, please.
[01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:20.759]  Of course, there are parallels to be made, but at that particular point in time, the fact that a one-party state was in control of all the food meant that if you did not work, if you did not go to the fields and perform the work that you were asked to do, or if you were too weak, or too vulnerable, or too old, or sometimes too young to actually earn your keep, you were banned from the canteen.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:25.964]  And entire groups of people were deliberately starved to death during that period from 1958
[01:15:27.925 --> 01:15:30.467]  Didn't Stalin do something similar in Ukraine?
[01:15:31.588 --> 01:15:32.869]  Very much a similar thing.
[01:15:33.049 --> 01:15:43.816]  In other words, what Stalin did in Ukraine and in other parts of the Soviet Union was collectivize the countryside and strip every incentive to work away from the farmers.
[01:15:44.497 --> 01:15:55.825]  In other words, people were locked in this cycle of violence with party officials who were there to take as much grain as they could and farmers who saw no reason to work except fear.
[01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:00.493]  Now, you talked about being buried alive for small things.
[01:16:01.354 --> 01:16:02.736]  How would they execute people?
[01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:12.605]  And I remember back in 98 or so, there were some big books that came out in China that the government officially sanctioned, where they talked about 80 million dead.
[01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:16.029]  They talked about large stewpots of human flesh.
[01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:18.972]  Is that true or is that a distortion?
[01:16:20.614 --> 01:16:29.979]  That may have happened in a few very isolated cases, but the most common instrument of punishment at the time was a stick.
[01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:33.101]  You just beat people to get them into the fields.
[01:16:33.141 --> 01:16:35.642]  When they're too famished to work, you beat them to get up.
[01:16:36.103 --> 01:16:41.626]  Or you strip them in the middle of the winter so that they have to work just to stay warm.
[01:16:42.446 --> 01:16:50.413]  The case of people being buried alive is reported all over China, from the north all the way to the south near Canton.
[01:16:50.754 --> 01:16:57.199]  In one case, a man is forced to bury his own son alive because his son has stolen a handful of grain.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.742]  Well, this man obviously is heartbroken.
[01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.904]  He dies of grief after three weeks.
[01:17:02.004 --> 01:17:02.925]  He can't continue.
[01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:12.472]  And there are countless cases of torture taking place for the slightest misdemeanor against some party command.
[01:17:12.492 --> 01:17:15.354]  Well, now if you don't follow the smallest order, you get tasered.
[01:17:15.634 --> 01:17:17.515]  People die every day of heart attacks.
[01:17:17.535 --> 01:17:19.777]  But I guess that's America, so it's okay.
[01:17:19.857 --> 01:17:20.177]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:20.197 --> 01:17:20.558]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:17:21.258 --> 01:17:41.762]  Well, I'd rather get tasered, I would rather get tasered, than have one of my ears chopped off, or my nose lopped off, or being buried alive, or being poured, being covered in excrement, or being tied up and thrown into a pond, or being branded with a sizzling tool like an animal.
[01:17:42.683 --> 01:17:43.263]  Amazing.
[01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:44.623]  Please continue, Professor.
[01:17:44.643 --> 01:17:47.283]  Very common ways of punishing people at the time.
[01:17:48.044 --> 01:17:49.104]  Please continue, Professor.
[01:17:50.410 --> 01:18:06.662]  So what I've found, thanks very much to the party archives, which are only gradually opening up, so God knows what more is still hidden in the central party archives in Beijing, but on the basis of what is open now, it's unavoidable.
[01:18:08.723 --> 01:18:19.151]  The conclusion that two to three million people were actually killed is unavoidable as part of the 45 million people who died unnecessarily during those four years.
[01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:21.352]  An absolutely staggering number of people.
[01:18:23.173 --> 01:18:25.275]  Professor, what's the grand total though?
[01:18:25.575 --> 01:18:28.097]  Because I see numbers of 80 million, 60 million.
[01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:29.718]  I mean, what's the real number from your research?
[01:18:30.398 --> 01:18:33.441]  Overall during the Mao reign?
[01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:49.034]  Well, the frightening thing is that so far, the only one period after 1949 that we've been able to study on the basis of the Communist Party archives is the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 62, when previous estimates ranged from 20 to 30 million.
[01:18:53.118 --> 01:19:04.484]  But on the basis of these unpublished documents, many compiled by the security police, by public security bureaus themselves, that has to go up to 45 million.
[01:19:04.984 --> 01:19:06.945]  Now, the question is, what happened during
[01:19:07.887 --> 01:19:11.430]  Other periods, for instance, the Cultural Revolution, which started a few years later.
[01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:18.696]  Or what happened immediately after 1949, after the conquest of power by the Communist Party, with the Reign of Terror.
[01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:22.479]  So far, people have claimed that two to three million people were killed.
[01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:23.599]  It might be much more.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.862]  We simply won't know, till we can have access to the archives.
[01:19:26.882 --> 01:19:27.402]  How does the U.S.
[01:19:27.422 --> 01:19:32.366]  government... It only happened for that very short period, referred to as the Great Leap Forward.
[01:19:32.707 --> 01:19:34.128]  So, it's anybody's guess.
[01:19:34.508 --> 01:19:35.649]  All right, Professor, stay there.
[01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:37.630]  We're going to tell folks how to get your book on the other side.
[01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.692]  We're very honored that you're spending time with us.
[01:19:40.552 --> 01:19:45.536]  And I want to just continue with whatever you think is most important, because you're the real expert on this.
[01:19:45.556 --> 01:19:47.997]  But I want to ask when we come back, how does the U.S.
[01:19:48.037 --> 01:19:50.299]  government come up with a 64 million number then?
[01:19:50.839 --> 01:19:52.780]  And from your dead reckoning, is that high?
[01:19:52.841 --> 01:19:53.441]  Is that low?
[01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:57.003]  And we'll continue with that on the other side.
[01:19:57.023 --> 01:19:57.624]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:57.724 --> 01:19:59.105]  Infowars.com is the website.

[01:24:24.821 --> 01:24:28.043]  And it's all stated by the United Nations under Agenda 21.
[01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:30.725]  They cite China as the model to control us.
[01:24:30.745 --> 01:24:32.287]  I mean, you can't make up this nightmare.
[01:24:33.227 --> 01:24:35.789]  And so I want you to know the plan here, hearing about Mao.
[01:24:37.363 --> 01:24:40.286]  And remember, Stalin did similar things, but just not on the same scale.
[01:24:41.007 --> 01:24:51.418]  We have, again, a very prestigious researcher and professor on with us, and we're going to talk more about the book itself that goes into just horrifying detail.
[01:24:53.905 --> 01:24:58.909]  Continuing with your research, we were getting into the point, Professor, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:04.874]  I was asking the question about 64 million is the number I see from the U.S.
[01:25:04.914 --> 01:25:05.315]  government.
[01:25:05.655 --> 01:25:07.176]  Where do they come up with that number, do you know?
[01:25:09.118 --> 01:25:11.219]  Pure speculation, pure speculation.
[01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:18.225]  I really don't believe that anybody's got any way of finding out how many died until we have full access to the archives.
[01:25:18.245 --> 01:25:19.847]  That's not going to happen anytime soon.
[01:25:21.482 --> 01:25:23.683]  But in a four year period, it's 45 mil.
[01:25:24.544 --> 01:25:25.324]  Yeah, it is.
[01:25:25.964 --> 01:25:27.205]  So it might be a lot more.
[01:25:27.645 --> 01:25:28.546]  We simply don't know.
[01:25:29.806 --> 01:25:33.168]  What was it like for you when you got access to this?
[01:25:33.488 --> 01:25:34.989]  A and B, how did you get access?
[01:25:36.545 --> 01:25:42.830]  Well, I didn't exactly walk in and ask them to show me all the files about how they went around killing 45 million people.
[01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:46.032]  And they didn't exactly hand it over on a golden plate either.
[01:25:46.432 --> 01:25:53.838]  So it was all very indirect in the sense that I was asking to look at economic history of that period.
[01:25:55.058 --> 01:25:59.761]  And there was a lot of goodwill in the couple of years before the Olympics.
[01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:03.722]  There was a sense of opening up and making more material available.
[01:26:04.063 --> 01:26:05.763]  There was a good feel factor.
[01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:12.306]  And I used that time to read as much as I could in several dozen party archives.
[01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:15.868]  City archives, county archives, provincial archives.
[01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:19.930]  And in some cases, I didn't find much at all.
[01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:23.492]  In other cases, I simply wasn't allowed to read anything.
[01:26:24.172 --> 01:26:27.136]  And once in a while I got very, very lucky.
[01:26:29.045 --> 01:26:39.529]  And when I read it, I have to say, I was quite prepared for tragedy, but nothing like what I encountered in the archives.
[01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:47.972]  I was still under the impression, like many others, that there simply wasn't enough food available, and that was why people died of hunger.
[01:26:47.992 --> 01:26:55.515]  I had no idea that the scope, the scale of coercion was so overwhelming.
[01:26:55.675 --> 01:26:57.316]  I had no idea that violence
[01:26:58.597 --> 01:27:04.446]  Was very much the way in which those four years were governed by the party.
[01:27:07.714 --> 01:27:36.934]  Looking at what happened in in China in 75 they started the one-child policy as taxes as you know and then in 80 as law I mean it seems like China when we know they want to get rid of some of their population And I'd seen in the 70s party leaders saying we would benefit from a nuclear war So as was there an idea that wiping out the the the countryside people, you know might be a good thing or or was it mismanagement?
[01:27:36.954 --> 01:27:37.534]  I mean, what was it?
[01:27:38.334 --> 01:28:00.568]  Well, it's a complex series of factors, but what you say is actually quite accurate in the sense that, at the time, people from the countryside were really seen, not just socially but legally, as inferior to city residents.
[01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.750]  In other words, a farmer
[01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:08.113]  ...did not legally matter as much as a city resident.
[01:28:08.473 --> 01:28:11.416]  They were very much treated as a special caste.
[01:28:12.136 --> 01:28:18.961]  And during the Great Leap Forward, a sort of war was built around the city.
[01:28:19.001 --> 01:28:23.844]  Not a real war, but the cities were fenced off from the countryside.
[01:28:23.884 --> 01:28:24.725]  Well, they do that now!
[01:28:24.785 --> 01:28:31.490]  They lock the rural workers at night in the major cities, AP reports, in basically giant prisons.
[01:28:32.475 --> 01:28:40.316]  Well, to this day, in fact, any migrant from the countryside can be arrested and locked up, and that law dates from the Great Leap Forward, 1958.
[01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:50.338]  The whole divide of the country, I mean, the real line that runs through this society, the real divide, is countryside people and city people.
[01:28:50.738 --> 01:29:00.540]  And there's no doubt that the vast majority of victims during the Great Leap Forward, the tens of millions of people who died, were countryside people, and there's no doubt either
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.647]  That they were pretty much at the very bottom of the social hierarchy during that period.
[01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.051]  Amazing, Professor, but again...
[01:29:11.656 --> 01:29:18.720]  The evidence shows, as you're saying, that the culture was already there to discriminate against the rural population.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.303]  But why do we then see the communists do the same thing in Russia?
[01:29:25.664 --> 01:29:31.387]  And now we see the UN with this attitude, claiming they want to help the rural communities, but actually doing the opposite.
[01:29:31.667 --> 01:29:32.748]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:32.768 --> 01:29:34.549]  We're going to get more into your deep research.
[01:29:35.349 --> 01:29:36.751]  And your book and how people can get it.
[01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:42.776]  We're also going to give a website out where folks can learn about all of your wonderful work.
[01:29:42.796 --> 01:29:46.419]  A true value to humanity historically, so we don't repeat this.
[01:29:46.439 --> 01:29:48.200]  We'll be right back with Professor DeCotter.
[01:29:50.663 --> 01:29:51.563]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.064 --> 01:29:53.665]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:57.268]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:05.139]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.499 --> 01:30:09.041]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.361 --> 01:30:11.643]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.663 --> 01:30:17.107]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.527 --> 01:30:23.751]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.191 --> 01:30:29.734]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.134 --> 01:30:33.836]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.336 --> 01:30:38.338]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.618 --> 01:30:44.141]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:47.562]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.123 --> 01:30:49.543]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.104 --> 01:30:50.544]  It's here.

[01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:15.302]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.303 --> 01:31:19.986]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:20.993 --> 01:31:32.985]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:33.745 --> 01:31:41.012]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:41.693 --> 01:31:51.297]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:58.611]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:14.205]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.638 --> 01:33:28.685]  Okay, we're back live, and we're talking to Professor DeCotter about Mao Zedong, undoubtedly the greatest mass murderer in human history.
[01:33:29.665 --> 01:33:34.429]  But I wanted to read a quote here from the New York Times.
[01:33:34.449 --> 01:33:36.491]  We actually went and got this from the microfilm.
[01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:39.253]  It's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:47.941]  David Rockefeller wrote for the New York Times, August 10th, 1973, after returning from a successful business trip to China, whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded.
[01:33:48.661 --> 01:33:54.063]  In fostering a high morale and community of purpose, general social and economic progress is no less impressive.
[01:33:54.103 --> 01:33:59.865]  The enormous social advances of China have benefited greatly from the singleness of ideology and purpose.
[01:34:00.266 --> 01:34:05.748]  The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in history.
[01:34:06.088 --> 01:34:08.549]  And he goes on in the editorial to praise Mao Zedong.
[01:34:09.089 --> 01:34:13.391]  We just got some footage from one of our associates that's done graphics work for us.
[01:34:14.191 --> 01:34:22.758]  Of being in major Chinese cities with the youth brigades marching with their red flags just this year and whenever they want they beat people up.
[01:34:22.818 --> 01:34:24.199]  I mean, that's all part of the fun.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:26.661]  And I've got CNN here.
[01:34:27.021 --> 01:34:31.765]  CNN tells masses that communism is good for women despite China's nightmare legacy.
[01:34:32.346 --> 01:34:34.548]  What is it like for you, Professor, being one of the
[01:34:35.328 --> 01:34:38.690]  Most respected researchers on Mao and that communist period.
[01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:43.973]  I mean, surely you've noticed all the glorification of Mao in Europe, Canada, the United States.
[01:34:43.993 --> 01:34:45.534]  They're putting statues up for him.
[01:34:46.454 --> 01:34:49.376]  They're basically saying he's a civil rights icon.
[01:34:50.156 --> 01:34:51.317]  Is that disturbing for you?
[01:34:52.236 --> 01:34:53.477]  Yeah, it's quite sickening.
[01:34:54.858 --> 01:35:06.308]  Given that what happened only during the Great Leap Forward would be enough to qualify as one of the three greatest man-made disasters of the 20th century.
[01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:13.915]  It has to be the Gulag, the Holocaust and the Great Leap Forward that count as the three greatest disasters that were pretty much man-made.
[01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:17.478]  I find it, obviously, quite sickening
[01:35:18.378 --> 01:35:27.660]  Here's a regime that not only destroyed human beings into tens of millions, but also everything else that was in its way.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:36.541]  That includes untold damage to nature during the Great Heap Forward, with up to half of the forest coverage lost.
[01:35:36.942 --> 01:35:44.323]  Housing destroyed, up to 40% in some provinces that are the size of a European country like France.
[01:35:46.064 --> 01:35:49.005]  40% of the housing destroyed in the space of four years.
[01:35:50.426 --> 01:35:55.529]  Transportation system that would grind to a halt with the Great Leap Forward.
[01:35:55.589 --> 01:36:03.794]  I mean, something, it's collectivization created such damage at every level that the China that existed before 1949, it's just gone forever.
[01:36:07.197 --> 01:36:25.776]  Another kind of damage that was done when people are reduced to doing everything in order to survive, including eating mud or stealing from their own family members, and that is the unraveling of the social fabric and of moral values altogether.
[01:36:26.697 --> 01:36:28.579]  You talk about the raping of the land.
[01:36:28.599 --> 01:36:30.962]  The website's frankdacotter.com.
[01:36:31.002 --> 01:36:33.885]  We have links to it up on infowars.com and prisonplunder.com.
[01:36:34.405 --> 01:36:38.389]  I mean, why were they destroying so many homes?
[01:36:38.429 --> 01:36:40.852]  I read something about, for quote, fertilizer.
[01:36:40.912 --> 01:36:41.572]  Explain that to me.
[01:36:42.173 --> 01:36:49.937]  Well, it sounds extraordinary, but it comes back in every party document that you can find from that period.
[01:36:51.378 --> 01:37:04.024]  Initially, mud huts were destroyed, or pig sheds, in which animals would have left some organic matter that might be used as fertilizer on the fields.
[01:37:04.445 --> 01:37:07.126]  But bit by bit, entire houses are being destroyed.
[01:37:07.506 --> 01:37:23.939]  And houses were destroyed for other reasons, not just for fertilizer, but to straighten the roads, or to take bricks in order to build up a people's commune or a canteen, or to punish the people who lived inside because they didn't work hard enough or didn't contribute enough grain to the state.
[01:37:25.079 --> 01:37:26.901]  Extraordinary level of destruction.
[01:37:27.161 --> 01:37:45.735]  And sir, I've also read about in this communist system with the police, they became fat and all these little petty thugs and psychopaths and control freaks, they all got recruited because a loving, good, decent person couldn't do things like this, so it gravitated towards absolute despotism.
[01:37:45.755 --> 01:37:47.637]  Can you talk about that psychology?
[01:37:49.207 --> 01:37:49.587]  Indeed.
[01:37:49.607 --> 01:37:54.989]  It isn't just people outside the party who were victims of this, but inside the party.
[01:37:55.049 --> 01:38:00.151]  Party members who didn't want to go along with these policies, who were rejected in some way or another.
[01:38:00.631 --> 01:38:03.632]  They too were expelled, purged from the party.
[01:38:04.112 --> 01:38:05.973]  In the millions, in the millions.
[01:38:06.733 --> 01:38:12.314]  And other, much harder, unscrupulous men were recruited to replace them.
[01:38:12.614 --> 01:38:16.055]  And they were willing to go along with anything Mao Zedong said.
[01:38:16.395 --> 01:38:23.837]  They were willing to very much trim their sails to benefit from these radical winds that were blowing from Peking.
[01:38:24.577 --> 01:38:33.679]  So, what you get is a party of thugs who are very much willing to do anything to curry favour with the current, with the leadership at the time.
[01:38:34.679 --> 01:38:40.780]  History repeats itself over and over again, and people don't recognize it, so they have to live through it.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:46.881]  And I see similar trends worldwide today with the recruiting of thugs, but we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:38:47.582 --> 01:38:59.804]  Professor, I want to get back into your book and tell folks how they get it and flesh out some of the other incredible, groundbreaking research that you've gotten from the Communist Party archives all over China, including local
[01:39:00.624 --> 01:39:15.280]  uh... archives uh... but uh... how much research have you done on the man malatang because i read about him never taking a bath having sex with five ten women a day just uh... just just just being a singularly disgusting creature
[01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:23.107]  That is very true and there is a very good biography by Yong Chang on Mao Zedong as a person.
[01:39:23.648 --> 01:39:41.178]  And what comes across when you start having access to the minutes of secret leadership meetings is an image of a man who is extremely stubborn on the one hand, not willing to listen to anybody else, but also extraordinarily vain.
[01:39:42.219 --> 01:39:52.231]  In the sense that nobody, including number two and number three down the line, down the hierarchy of power, are really willing to upset this man.
[01:39:53.553 --> 01:39:58.178]  And that's linked to a third characteristic that comes across very clearly, and that's paranoia.
[01:39:58.319 --> 01:40:07.469]  Here's a man who is the head of a one-party state and is constantly fearing that there might be somebody stabbing him in the back, somebody undermining him.
[01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:13.576]  So he is very much at the head of a one-party state in which any
[01:40:15.463 --> 01:40:28.496]  Any failure to curry favor or toe the party line results in outright dismissal or much further down the line to violence of extraordinary proportions.
[01:40:28.576 --> 01:40:30.658]  Sounds like a bigger scale North Korea.
[01:40:31.974 --> 01:40:35.255]  It's very much a bigger scale North Korea.
[01:40:35.535 --> 01:40:46.059]  In fact, I made a comparison about a week ago when I spoke to The Independent in England with Pol Pot and Pol Pot and the genocide in Cambodia.
[01:40:46.859 --> 01:40:50.601]  I described it as 20 times what happened in Cambodia.
[01:40:50.621 --> 01:40:53.462]  20 times what the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot did.
[01:40:55.453 --> 01:40:56.134]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:56.154 --> 01:41:00.958]  I want to get back into that period, those four years, 45 million killed in one way or the other.
[01:41:01.538 --> 01:41:08.645]  But looking at the fact that near the end, Mal's wife became a scapegoat.
[01:41:08.665 --> 01:41:10.686]  She was just as sickening as he was.
[01:41:10.706 --> 01:41:11.887]  I want to speak about her.
[01:41:14.278 --> 01:41:19.583]  What China has done to get away from that, but I know they still have the forced labor farming camps.
[01:41:19.623 --> 01:41:20.905]  I know a lot of that is still there.
[01:41:20.925 --> 01:41:25.810]  It's just hidden in that archipelago throughout the country.
[01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:37.902]  But specifically, going through the overall span of his reign of terror, his great leap into hell, how things ended for Mao Zedong and how he's seen in China today.
[01:41:39.215 --> 01:41:45.179]  Well, Mao Zedong did rather well, unlike Adolf Hitler, but not unlike Joseph Stalin.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:42:00.671]  He died very peacefully in his sleep, after having gotten rid of every single one of his enemies, including number two at the time, head of state, Yao Shaoqi, and very much allowing number three, Zhou Enlai, to die of cancer.
[01:42:01.331 --> 01:42:02.972]  By withholding medical treatment.
[01:42:03.192 --> 01:42:07.694]  So he was the one who lived a very long life and died in his sleep.
[01:42:08.174 --> 01:42:09.154]  How is he considered?
[01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:15.777]  Well, I'm sometimes told by people in China that he is still held in great esteem.
[01:42:16.257 --> 01:42:20.118]  But the key point really is that even at the time, while he was
[01:42:21.599 --> 01:42:26.080]  Pretty much taking away the grain from ordinary farmers and starving them to death.
[01:42:26.561 --> 01:42:40.825]  Those very farmers in the countryside who were being starved, with their children taken away to the army, who were sometimes buried alive during that period, they themselves believed that Mao Zedong was a great man.
[01:42:41.465 --> 01:42:43.468]  And it's a very simple way of explaining that.
[01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:45.151]  People need hope.
[01:42:45.532 --> 01:42:49.658]  They believe that the man at the very top is benevolent.
[01:42:49.698 --> 01:42:54.886]  They love their servitude, and once they buy into the con, they can never say they were wrong.
[01:42:55.828 --> 01:42:56.148]  Indeed!
[01:42:56.449 --> 01:43:02.015]  It goes back to a very old traditional way of looking at things under the Chinese Empire.
[01:43:02.295 --> 01:43:06.279]  The emperor is benevolent, but his mandarins are crooked.
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:10.944]  The ones who carry out his orders are wicked.
[01:43:12.711 --> 01:43:16.593]  Now, going back to his number two, having his health care withheld, I had read that.
[01:43:16.933 --> 01:43:41.546]  I mean, that shows that in these tyrannical systems, whatever permutation they take, that it is the people that work for the system, statistically from my, you know, grazing over wide spectrums of history, that generally the most dangerous position, just like with Hitler, wiping out tens of thousands of his brown shirts that took him to power on the Night of the Long Knives, that over and over again, it is the servants of the Dark Lord that are in the most danger.
[01:43:43.906 --> 01:43:46.389]  That is true to a great extent.
[01:43:46.429 --> 01:43:55.403]  For instance, the Cultural Revolution is extremely complex, but essentially boils down to Communist Party members
[01:43:56.764 --> 01:44:01.429]  Purging or killing off or torturing other Communist Party members.
[01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:03.592]  It's a great purge within the party.
[01:44:04.833 --> 01:44:07.797]  And that caused something like two, three million deaths.
[01:44:08.357 --> 01:44:15.986]  But of course, ultimately, ordinary people, the ones who died in the tens of millions are exposed, have far less protection against
[01:44:16.366 --> 01:44:36.516]  violence that comes from above and people inside the party but you are right nobody would relish to be number two or number three in that kind of system and Lin Biao Lin Biao is a very smart man who tried to stay away from it but he too got pulled into it by Mao Zedong himself and he tried to flee and of course died in tragic circumstances.
[01:44:36.676 --> 01:44:44.480]  Well professor we see this this cycle over and over again throughout history that when a aggressive
[01:44:45.541 --> 01:44:50.323]  A group comes in, takes over, that almost always things get worse, not better.
[01:44:50.363 --> 01:44:52.744]  That's why 1776 was so special.
[01:44:52.784 --> 01:45:03.828]  They really did deliver on almost all the promises, and it was, you know, the greatest expression of a true leap forward for freedom.
[01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:11.752]  But if you look at the Communists, if you look at the Nazis, if you look at the decline of Rome, and I'd like you to speak as a historian on this if you can, just overall,
[01:45:12.532 --> 01:45:17.836]  First they take over, kill off their first enemy, whoever was in power before.
[01:45:18.276 --> 01:45:23.019]  Then they wipe out the thugs that brought them to power.
[01:45:23.639 --> 01:45:27.542]  And there's always an escalation in the killing, comparatively.
[01:45:27.682 --> 01:45:31.805]  And then you've got all these killers and psychopaths and sadists and control freaks.
[01:45:32.285 --> 01:45:38.089]  They've still got the bloodlust, the bloodthirsty enjoyment, and the paranoia that goes with it.
[01:45:38.349 --> 01:45:41.972]  And so then it just accelerates, accelerates, accelerates, accelerates.
[01:45:42.752 --> 01:45:43.213]  Yes, quite.
[01:45:43.233 --> 01:45:51.241]  I mean, these one-party states, whether it's under Stalin, under Hitler, under Mao, have very similar structures with similar effects.
[01:45:51.662 --> 01:45:59.590]  And I think Friedrich Hayek, the wonderful writer who wrote this book called The Road to Serfdom... Yes, Road to Serfdom.
[01:46:00.611 --> 01:46:02.232]  Hayek saw it very clearly.
[01:46:02.753 --> 01:46:20.423]  Once you start stripping away every kind of freedom, the freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom to trade, once you replace it by a one-party dictate, there can only be one road, and that's the road to serve them, as he said rather clearly.
[01:46:20.843 --> 01:46:26.767]  I think the Great Leap Forward illustrates that better than anything else in 20th century history.
[01:46:27.421 --> 01:46:30.946]  Well, Professor, I mean, you're obviously a very intelligent person.
[01:46:30.966 --> 01:46:31.908]  You've studied history.
[01:46:32.549 --> 01:46:42.183]  Are you not concerned about global parallels now with this global corporate elite who use collectivism at the national level to consolidate power to then
[01:46:42.964 --> 01:46:48.008]  Combine and move the nation's wealth into their corporate arms.
[01:46:48.348 --> 01:47:00.456]  I mean, globalization, when you really study what it's for, as the head of political science at Georgetown wrote, Bill Clinton's mentor, that this mega-corporate elite, they'll fund fascists, communists, thugs.
[01:47:00.997 --> 01:47:06.220]  Our own CIA admits over and over again they'll choose a dictator over an elected government.
[01:47:06.621 --> 01:47:09.443]  And more and more we see the classical Western liberties
[01:47:10.103 --> 01:47:17.226]  Whether it's England or the United States being dismantled, do you ever see parallels?
[01:47:18.747 --> 01:47:27.110]  What worries me more than anything else is the fact that we still have a one-party state in power in the People's Republic of China.
[01:47:27.130 --> 01:47:31.132]  It's very much the same party that committed all these atrocities some 50 years ago.
[01:47:31.872 --> 01:47:43.925]  Now, right now, the number of people who actually see China and the authoritarian state it represents as an example to be followed, I find that extremely worrying.
[01:47:44.606 --> 01:47:50.091]  And what I find even more worrying is what might happen if things go bad economically.
[01:47:50.552 --> 01:47:52.033]  What if that bubble bursts?
[01:47:52.774 --> 01:47:58.945]  What would happen with a People's Republic and a one-party state when things go downhill economically?
[01:47:59.425 --> 01:48:02.250]  That, to me, seems to be something we should be paying attention to.
[01:48:04.227 --> 01:48:05.608]  I agree with you, Professor.
[01:48:06.628 --> 01:48:15.892]  We'll put your website up on screen, the title of the book, Mal's Great Famine, and Frank DeCotter is our guest.
[01:48:16.032 --> 01:48:18.353]  We've got a little bit of time left in this segment, the next.
[01:48:19.033 --> 01:48:24.616]  I've been asking a lot of the questions, what are some of the other big central points and discoveries that you make in the book?
[01:48:24.676 --> 01:48:27.237]  I haven't read it yet, I've just seen the reviews, but we do have a copy ordered.
[01:48:30.869 --> 01:48:43.199]  I think the sheer extent of... the amount of documentation that comes out of the party archives I find quite extraordinary.
[01:48:43.699 --> 01:48:48.503]  And I just wonder what happened during other periods under Communist rule up to 1949.
[01:48:49.064 --> 01:48:56.390]  When you start looking at 45 million people in four or five years time, you just wonder what happened afterwards or in the decade prior to that.
[01:48:58.591 --> 01:49:13.963]  Most of all, I think that it is not just about trying to see Mao as the greatest mass murderer in human history, which of course he is, but also trying to treat the victims of it and try to, at least in
[01:49:14.563 --> 01:49:30.678]  Respect to the memory of those many tens of millions who died and try to read about this event and treat it with the same degree of respect and knowledge as we treat victims of the Holocaust and victims of the Soviet gulag.
[01:49:31.917 --> 01:49:38.484]  What I'm trying to say, I think, is that people simply don't have a choice or a voice in the People's Republic.
[01:49:38.524 --> 01:49:41.848]  There is no monument to the dead of the Great Leap Forward.
[01:49:41.868 --> 01:49:42.869]  There's no museum.
[01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:44.251]  There's no remembrance.
[01:49:44.351 --> 01:49:50.337]  We have not publicly recognized, even in Western media, just how horrid this period was.
[01:49:50.398 --> 01:49:52.940]  And because it hasn't been called out,
[01:49:53.641 --> 01:49:57.124]  There's restaurants all over the U.S., college kids, I go back to that.
[01:49:57.804 --> 01:50:00.066]  And now, I remember, I've been on air 15 years.
[01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:06.271]  15 years ago, our media would criticize China and its human rights abuses and its organs selling and the rest of it.
[01:50:06.612 --> 01:50:08.553]  Now, sir, I hardly ever hear that.
[01:50:08.813 --> 01:50:20.203]  That's why it was so refreshing to see you coming out and people looking at your research and a lot of media admitting, I mean, this seems like a big step forward towards really recognizing this evil.
[01:50:21.875 --> 01:50:22.275]  Indeed.
[01:50:22.295 --> 01:50:36.930]  That's the tragedy of China becoming more powerful in world politics, is that there are fewer and fewer people actually prepared to look at what happened in the past, or for that matter, what is happening today.
[01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.492]  And that same system's in place now.
[01:50:38.532 --> 01:50:40.253]  We've got five minutes on the other side, but...
[01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:45.259]  Recap and expand on the point you were just making, Professor, and then let's look forward.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.701]  I mean, let's look at who they've got there.
[01:50:47.082 --> 01:50:54.311]  It's the children and grandchildren of the same totally wicked, inbred party elite, and now they own the majority of U.S.
[01:50:54.351 --> 01:50:57.234]  debt and have over 6,000 front companies here in the U.S.
[01:50:57.254 --> 01:50:59.137]  Well, they're right back with the Professor.
[01:51:00.643 --> 01:51:01.904]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.944 --> 01:51:07.306]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.547 --> 01:51:12.149]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.549 --> 01:51:12.949]  It's true.
[01:51:13.029 --> 01:51:17.592]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.132 --> 01:51:22.835]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.356 --> 01:51:25.277]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.657 --> 01:51:30.280]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:31.361]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.581 --> 01:51:34.363]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.643 --> 01:51:37.965]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.286 --> 01:51:41.127]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.468 --> 01:51:43.349]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:43.689 --> 01:51:44.610]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:48.252 --> 01:51:50.034]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:51.216 --> 01:51:57.002]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.323 --> 01:51:59.706]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.016 --> 01:52:02.917]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:52:03.177 --> 01:52:04.598]  Thinking about buying a new one?

[01:53:00.379 --> 01:53:01.520]  This may surprise you.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:05.962]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[01:53:06.222 --> 01:53:07.863]  You or someone you know may have it.
[01:53:08.043 --> 01:53:11.604]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[01:53:11.785 --> 01:53:14.126]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[01:53:14.366 --> 01:53:19.688]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[01:53:19.908 --> 01:53:27.372]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy
[01:53:27.432 --> 01:53:32.555]  It's a great tasting, affordable way to give your body the nutritional tools to help it overcome type 2 diabetes.
[01:53:32.815 --> 01:53:37.457]  Scoop of Greens has been awarded the Diabetes Resource Center Seal of Approval so you know it's safe.
[01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:43.560]  See Scoop of Greens and other world-class, whole living foods and nutraceuticals at DiabeticHealthSolution.com.

[01:54:10.165 --> 01:54:15.267]  Well, we'll definitely have him back up with us again because we haven't even scratched the surface.
[01:54:15.287 --> 01:54:24.269]  I hope you'll get the book, Mal's Great Famine, because it mirrors the separate research I've done, obviously not as in-depth or directly there at the source.
[01:54:24.309 --> 01:54:29.311]  This is confirmed, you know, point of release from within their own annals.
[01:54:29.991 --> 01:54:33.132]  And as he said, it's only the surface and it's so horrific.
[01:54:34.112 --> 01:54:38.876]  We have our own government lighting up the Empire States Building in the communist Chinese colors.
[01:54:39.396 --> 01:54:41.198]  That's like lighting it up as a swastika.
[01:54:41.858 --> 01:54:44.300]  If we don't recognize that the same system is still there.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.924]  My film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:54:49.064 --> 01:54:55.328]  You can get four copies to give to your friends and family of this seminal film for $19.95 for another two weeks.
[01:54:56.569 --> 01:55:01.914]  This documents our government's own admissions, major think tanks, the UN, saying they like what Mao did.
[01:55:02.654 --> 01:55:05.375]  Now, I read you a New York Times quote from David Rockefeller.
[01:55:05.755 --> 01:55:09.657]  You see the young kids, I see them in UT, wearing Mao and Stalin shirts.
[01:55:10.357 --> 01:55:11.197]  This is serious.
[01:55:11.858 --> 01:55:14.639]  This is serious, and we've got to stand up and recognize evil.
[01:55:14.919 --> 01:55:24.583]  So I hope folks get the film at Infowars.com because, uh, sir, finishing up with that point about how we're, that,
[01:55:26.161 --> 01:55:28.967]  The same groups that did this are still in control today.
[01:55:29.549 --> 01:55:31.673]  China owns most of the West's debt.
[01:55:32.876 --> 01:55:36.684]  And where is China going now?
[01:55:38.206 --> 01:55:42.030]  Well, I'm not an expert on China today.
[01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:55.162]  That's one of the troubling things, is that the so-called China experts seem always to be very willing to talk about every aspect of that country, whether it happened a thousand years ago or what is going to happen in ten years' time.
[01:55:55.182 --> 01:55:56.803]  So I'm very prudent with that.
[01:55:57.344 --> 01:55:58.525]  But looking at it,
[01:55:59.345 --> 01:56:03.168]  I think the real worry is whether there's another great leap forward taking place.
[01:56:03.288 --> 01:56:21.601]  Obviously not tens of millions dying of hunger, but again there's great faith by the Chinese government that it has somehow found a way to catapult its country past everybody else through some magic economic plan that has nothing in common with the rest of the world.
[01:56:21.942 --> 01:56:28.046]  This idea that they can somehow do their own thing in a very different way without having to pay respect
[01:56:28.046 --> 01:56:36.190]  Respect to human beings, respect to freedom, the freedom of movement, freedom of association, freedom of religion, freedom of speech.
[01:56:37.070 --> 01:56:41.472]  That seems to me to be rather worrying.
[01:56:41.892 --> 01:56:49.856]  And in any event, it seems to me that if we really want to understand China now, you cannot but read up on its history of the past 50 years.
[01:56:50.096 --> 01:56:54.458]  These are, as you said, very much the same people in power, the same families in power.
[01:56:56.991 --> 01:57:01.052]  The same people in power, the same families, becoming fabulously wealthy.
[01:57:01.112 --> 01:57:13.196]  I mean, generals making hundreds of millions of dollars, and they're killing the Falun Gong, they're killing peaceful groups, they're still oppressing Tibet, and our media more and more defends it.
[01:57:14.476 --> 01:57:14.836]  Indeed.
[01:57:14.857 --> 01:57:25.860]  The other query for China experts out there, of course, not for me as a historian, but would be to find out whether or not these methods are being exported to other countries.
[01:57:27.728 --> 01:57:30.390]  Oh, they certainly are being exported to other countries.
[01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:33.011]  I mean, that's the issue that I see here.
[01:57:33.572 --> 01:57:44.859]  And then China's got so much influence over our internal politics because they own our debt that, I mean, that's the main reason that the State Department two years ago said they're not selling organs when China admits they're selling organs.
[01:57:44.879 --> 01:57:46.540]  So now our government's lying for them.
[01:57:47.865 --> 01:57:49.970]  Well, there you go.
[01:57:51.252 --> 01:57:55.240]  So, again, is it another great leap forward?
[01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:58.066]  I'd be very prudent.
[01:58:00.446 --> 01:58:01.067]  It's incredible.
[01:58:01.107 --> 01:58:05.031]  Well, Professor DeCotter, frankdecotter.com is the website.
[01:58:05.811 --> 01:58:07.052]  I know you're in Rome right now.
[01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:18.363]  I'd like to, while we have you, call you and try to pick a time to interview you again as soon as possible because I'd like to open the phones up to take calls.
[01:58:18.443 --> 01:58:21.746]  So we're going to put you on hold, sir, and find a time to
[01:58:24.036 --> 01:58:27.337]  We'll get you back on in the future, perhaps in studio when you're here in the United States.
[01:58:27.737 --> 01:58:32.158]  I hope folks get your book, and as you said, learn to recognize evil so it doesn't happen again.
[01:58:32.498 --> 01:58:33.238]  God bless you, sir.
[01:58:34.118 --> 01:58:34.519]  Thank you.
[01:58:35.379 --> 01:58:37.779]  There goes Professor Frank the Cotter.
[01:58:37.859 --> 01:58:38.579]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.341 --> 01:58:44.721]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.301 --> 01:58:47.402]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:54.183]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:54.504 --> 01:58:54.784]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.424 --> 01:58:58.567]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:58.847 --> 01:58:59.407]  Number 2.
[01:58:59.708 --> 01:59:04.251]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:04.591 --> 01:59:05.032]  It's true.
[01:59:05.332 --> 01:59:09.895]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.216 --> 01:59:10.756]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.036 --> 01:59:14.319]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:14.619 --> 01:59:18.322]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.522 --> 01:59:19.063]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.323 --> 01:59:21.685]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.085 --> 01:59:25.468]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.768 --> 01:59:25.969]  Number 5.
[01:59:26.549 --> 01:59:30.472]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:30.693 --> 01:59:35.457]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:35.737 --> 01:59:39.778]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.918 --> 01:59:41.479]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.699 --> 01:59:43.779]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:43.959 --> 01:59:46.540]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:53.982]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.918 --> 02:00:09.079]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:10.540]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.241]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.881 --> 02:00:16.542]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.062 --> 02:00:21.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.985 --> 02:00:26.846]  Well, you see the headlines every day.
[02:00:26.866 --> 02:00:31.747]  $5,000 fine for a garden in a guy's backyard he's had for 15 years.
[02:00:31.787 --> 02:00:33.608]  They're coming out with zoning.
[02:00:35.106 --> 02:00:36.728]  New articles, you couldn't make it up.
[02:00:36.908 --> 02:00:41.293]  Georgia man fined $5,000 for growing vegetables.
[02:00:43.195 --> 02:00:45.178]  That's being reported by the newspapers.
[02:00:46.559 --> 02:00:47.581]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:00:49.026 --> 02:00:49.827]  Here's another one.
[02:00:50.367 --> 02:00:53.948]  Sixty days in jail for overgrown grass in New York State.
[02:00:54.329 --> 02:00:56.330]  WVLA Television.
[02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:57.290]  And they say it's good.
[02:00:57.890 --> 02:00:58.611]  Here's another one.
[02:00:59.011 --> 02:01:02.452]  Social engineering bill in Senate will force you into city.
[02:01:02.472 --> 02:01:03.953]  And I've read it.
[02:01:03.973 --> 02:01:04.673]  It is the Agenda 21.
[02:01:05.794 --> 02:01:10.156]  It's called Livable Communities, a blueprint for transformation of society into federal control.
[02:01:10.476 --> 02:01:13.457]  We'll enforce federal sustainable development zoning and control local communities.
[02:01:13.857 --> 02:01:15.778]  We'll create a massive new development bureaucracy.
[02:01:16.118 --> 02:01:18.159]  We'll drive up the cost of energy and heat and cool your home.
[02:01:18.559 --> 02:01:21.620]  We'll drive the cost of gasoline and a way to get in your car.
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:25.001]  We'll force you to spend thousands of dollars in your home in order to comply.
[02:01:25.021 --> 02:01:30.063]  It's basically the sections of the carbon tax bill they couldn't get through.
[02:01:31.291 --> 02:01:31.831]  Here's another one.
[02:01:31.911 --> 02:01:32.151]  U.S.
[02:01:32.171 --> 02:01:34.432]  House puts oceans under U.N.
[02:01:34.512 --> 02:01:35.873]  Senate vote will seal the deal.
[02:01:36.293 --> 02:01:38.173]  It's got quotes from Congressmen.
[02:01:38.293 --> 02:01:39.054]  It's passed the House.
[02:01:39.434 --> 02:01:41.695]  John Boehner's office saying, yes, it's happening.
[02:01:42.015 --> 02:01:43.475]  Probably going to pass this week or next.
[02:01:43.955 --> 02:01:45.876]  I mean, it's H.R.
[02:01:45.896 --> 02:01:45.876]  3534.
[02:01:46.196 --> 02:01:48.037]  Thinly disguised.
[02:01:48.577 --> 02:01:49.077]  Takeover.
[02:01:50.538 --> 02:01:51.398]  And deals with energy.
[02:01:52.602 --> 02:01:54.082]  What's our oil drilling under U.N.
[02:01:54.102 --> 02:01:54.442]  control?
[02:01:54.643 --> 02:01:55.563]  Remember, the U.N.
[02:01:55.603 --> 02:02:00.464]  was created by the megacorporations and the Rockefellers, so they can sign the authority over to them.
[02:02:00.484 --> 02:02:01.624]  People keep saying, well, the U.N.
[02:02:01.664 --> 02:02:03.045]  created, the U.S.
[02:02:03.085 --> 02:02:06.505]  created the U.N., so then why do Americans want out of the U.N.?
[02:02:06.705 --> 02:02:12.167]  Or, well, it's a global corporate construct to then come back in and take over.
[02:02:12.487 --> 02:02:16.408]  That's why our trade and risk government funds it, because it's controlled by the very same robber barons.
[02:02:18.370 --> 02:02:36.541]  For the rest of this hour, we're going to do a quick update later on what's happening with the economy, but we are joined by an amazing lady who we've had on the broadcast before, and she lives right outside Austin, Judith McGarry, a lawyer and family farm operator, farmandranchfreedom.org.
[02:02:37.022 --> 02:02:39.263]  Earlier this week, they just had a conference in Austin.
[02:02:39.723 --> 02:02:46.608]  They've got a House and Senate bill, which could be interpreted, and I've read the language, to say you can't make strawberry jam and give it to your neighbor or sell it.
[02:02:47.068 --> 02:02:50.470]  And you see them SWAT teaming Amish and all of this happening.
[02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:52.251]  And it just shows you the mindset.
[02:02:52.271 --> 02:02:55.633]  We just spent an hour about Mao Zedong using food as a weapon.
[02:02:55.673 --> 02:02:57.414]  Now the UN says they'll use food as a weapon.
[02:02:57.434 --> 02:02:57.935]  That's a quote.
[02:02:58.895 --> 02:03:00.236]  We have our own government saying that.
[02:03:00.456 --> 02:03:02.137]  They don't want you self-sufficient.
[02:03:02.157 --> 02:03:04.198]  They want you under their control as prisoners.
[02:03:05.159 --> 02:03:11.603]  And under the carbon taxes, they say Germany's already passed a law by 2020, ten years from now, no single-family homes are allowed.
[02:03:13.234 --> 02:03:15.616]  They're talking about bulldozing them and building smart homes.
[02:03:15.676 --> 02:03:16.838]  This is total tyranny.
[02:03:17.138 --> 02:03:18.880]  First, they tell you what type of toilet you can have.
[02:03:20.221 --> 02:03:25.226]  Then they tell you what type of light bulbs, little simple things, what type of air conditioning freon.
[02:03:25.646 --> 02:03:27.528]  Then it's, oh, we're going to have a home inspection.
[02:03:27.949 --> 02:03:30.712]  Oh, you've got to have a license to have a garden.
[02:03:32.569 --> 02:03:35.491]  Oh, we've got to inspect your garden and make sure you're not growing marijuana.
[02:03:36.271 --> 02:03:37.832]  Tulsa, Oklahoma has been calling for that.
[02:03:38.132 --> 02:03:41.974]  We're going to go to break, come back with her, and really flesh this out.
[02:03:41.994 --> 02:03:58.142]  But farmandranchfreedom.org is the website, and it's time for farmers and ranchers to not just go to the football game on Friday nights, to not just go drink beer, to not just go complain at county commissioners, to really get aggressive and realize you're under attack.
[02:03:58.303 --> 02:04:00.644]  Mega agribusiness globally, states,
[02:04:01.164 --> 02:04:05.828]  They're passing regulations worldwide to take over your farm and ranch.
[02:04:06.569 --> 02:04:13.855]  To put regulations on you that are not enforced against Tyson Chicken and ConAgra and others.
[02:04:14.395 --> 02:04:15.076]  Monsanto.
[02:04:15.656 --> 02:04:23.143]  And to let Monsanto come on your land and spray your crops to see if any of their genes are in the crops, because if the plants don't die they know.
[02:04:23.963 --> 02:04:26.084]  Uh, that, uh, you know, it's got some of their genetics.
[02:04:26.624 --> 02:04:29.085]  All of this, this is a scientific takeover.
[02:04:30.145 --> 02:04:33.186]  The mega-corporations want world government, they want it now.
[02:04:33.266 --> 02:04:39.048]  So, Judith McGeary, we'll have the floor when we come back to walk through all of this, but you just heard me have...
[02:04:40.137 --> 02:04:50.386]  One of the top head of his department at a prestigious university on about communism, about collectivism, about using food as a weapon, and he agreed it's now happening here.
[02:04:51.047 --> 02:04:52.648]  Look, it's really happening.
[02:04:53.429 --> 02:04:53.729]  Okay?
[02:04:53.749 --> 02:04:54.690]  That's not hyperbole.
[02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:55.871]  They want to do this here.
[02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:57.752]  Our government is totally criminal.
[02:04:57.772 --> 02:04:58.193]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.051 --> 02:05:03.994]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:04.234 --> 02:05:10.278]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:10.638 --> 02:05:17.743]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:05:18.023 --> 02:05:22.606]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:53.398 --> 02:06:55.941]  H-O-M-E G-A-I-N.com.
[02:06:56.262 --> 02:06:57.043]  Check them out today.
[02:06:59.437 --> 02:07:00.638]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:00.678 --> 02:07:03.819]  Remember when I said you spell freedom F-O-O-D?
[02:07:04.019 --> 02:07:04.680]  It's really true.
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.842]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food.
[02:07:09.162 --> 02:07:14.365]  And a record number of Americans, over 43 million, depend on the government to feed themselves.
[02:07:14.625 --> 02:07:16.486]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[02:07:16.686 --> 02:07:19.887]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:07:20.087 --> 02:07:23.329]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:31.592]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality storable food.
[02:07:31.752 --> 02:07:38.615]  Because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special, eFoodsDirect.com will continue this special until September 27th.
[02:07:39.395 --> 02:07:42.316]  Right now, you can buy three and get one free at the old prices.
[02:07:42.677 --> 02:07:45.498]  But move fast, because this offer ends September 27th.

[02:07:52.501 --> 02:07:54.602]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:16.277]  Okay, we're going to break down the UN Agenda 21 stated plan to shut down family farms and ranches.
[02:08:16.977 --> 02:08:18.599]  And they've got Codex Alimentarius.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:21.802]  Europe is now moving to start banning herbs over the counter.
[02:08:21.842 --> 02:08:22.623]  They want it here.
[02:08:23.204 --> 02:08:26.187]  This is a full spectrum attack to take over the food.
[02:08:27.268 --> 02:08:31.332]  We're going to her in just a moment from farmandranchfreedom.org.
[02:08:33.652 --> 02:08:35.313]  And go over this legislation.
[02:08:36.233 --> 02:08:40.415]  But I first wanted to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio broadcast possible.
[02:08:40.995 --> 02:08:50.718]  The globalists have stated that by having tax incentives to move overseas, and having open borders to drive down wages, that they want to destroy our industry to consolidate it.
[02:08:51.158 --> 02:08:52.259]  And they've done that.
[02:08:52.879 --> 02:08:56.140]  They now admit the White House science czar, post-industrial U.S.
[02:08:58.510 --> 02:09:00.591]  Look at Diamond Gusset jeans, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:09:05.332 --> 02:09:05.952]  The fabric.
[02:09:06.012 --> 02:09:06.553]  The sewing.
[02:09:06.693 --> 02:09:07.113]  Everything.

[02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:39.871]  And we're so blessed to even have sponsors that are made in America.
[02:10:39.891 --> 02:10:41.652]  I mean, it's shutting down everywhere.
[02:10:42.253 --> 02:10:51.557]  Okay, let's now go to Judith McGeary of Farm and Ranch Freedom to break down what we're dealing with.
[02:10:53.393 --> 02:11:03.338]  Judith, tell us how you first got into this, the overall view of what's behind this agenda, and as a lawyer being able to research the bills, what we're currently facing with the legislation.
[02:11:04.379 --> 02:11:06.160]  You don't ask a lot at one time.
[02:11:07.481 --> 02:11:17.326]  I got into it at the time I was a practicing attorney, and my husband and I have our own small farm, and I heard about the animal identification system, and they were pushing it here in Texas.
[02:11:18.055 --> 02:11:30.223]  So, the more I researched it, the uglier it looked, and I ended up leaving my legal practice and creating the Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance, along with a group of other farmers and ranchers who were very worried about what NAIS could do.
[02:11:31.503 --> 02:11:38.588]  And so at first our focus was very closely focused just on NAIS, but the more you get into this, the more you realize how many threats there are.
[02:11:39.528 --> 02:11:45.332]  And this year, we put a lot of energy and a lot of focus onto the food safety bills in Congress.
[02:11:45.999 --> 02:11:48.441]  Actually for about the last year and a half now we've been doing that.
[02:11:49.602 --> 02:11:56.206]  Because what's happening is that the federal government is looking at the food system.
[02:11:57.187 --> 02:12:00.610]  And there are a lot of really legitimate concerns about food safety in this country.
[02:12:01.050 --> 02:12:04.512]  I don't feel secure about the quality of the food in the grocery stores.
[02:12:04.753 --> 02:12:07.795]  And unfortunately that's what 95% of people are eating.
[02:12:08.635 --> 02:12:14.880]  But the problem is they're using that as an excuse to create a massive federal regulatory scheme
[02:12:15.501 --> 02:12:17.982]  That covers all the food in this country.
[02:12:18.002 --> 02:12:38.787]  You know, right down to, as you were saying, you know, someone who makes a few jars of jam and, you know, sells them at a local farmer's market or, you know, at the local, you know, park or fair stand or, you know, flea market, you know, for a couple of weeks a year, would be faced with really complicated, convoluted federal regulation.
[02:12:39.527 --> 02:12:42.307]  And frankly, most of them won't be able to deal with it.
[02:12:42.427 --> 02:12:43.388]  That's the short version.
[02:12:43.428 --> 02:12:44.308]  That's the nutshell.
[02:12:45.282 --> 02:12:46.762]  Well, let's go back to the beginning.
[02:12:47.862 --> 02:12:51.423]  The Animal ID, Premises ID, how they tried to force it through.
[02:12:51.983 --> 02:12:55.744]  Now they claim they've backed off, but they're just coming back with it again.
[02:12:56.184 --> 02:12:58.364]  Let's break down the full spectrum takeover.
[02:12:58.424 --> 02:13:02.025]  Big agribusiness, on record, financing this.
[02:13:02.825 --> 02:13:04.826]  They exempt themselves from most of the rules.
[02:13:05.226 --> 02:13:08.546]  It's clearly designed to shut down family farms and ranches.
[02:13:08.946 --> 02:13:11.147]  They're now trying to say hobby farms aren't
[02:13:12.182 --> 02:13:14.623]  Uh, eligible for small tax exemptions.
[02:13:15.063 --> 02:13:17.743]  They're doing everything they can to shut down the family farm.
[02:13:17.983 --> 02:13:22.985]  There is a undeclared war going on against our family farms and ranches.
[02:13:23.685 --> 02:13:27.606]  There's been an undeclared war against our family farms and ranches for a long time.
[02:13:28.046 --> 02:13:33.167]  You know, the official federal government policy for decades has been get big or get out.
[02:13:33.687 --> 02:13:35.788]  And that has been the attitude.
[02:13:36.288 --> 02:13:41.669]  And what we've seen, whether it's Animal ID, whether it's the tax exemptions you're talking about, whether it's the food safety bill,
[02:13:42.523 --> 02:13:50.286]  Is that the federal agencies, the USDA and the FDA, you know, have a revolving door going between them and Big Ag.
[02:13:50.386 --> 02:14:01.810]  So Michael Taylor, who's now the head of food safety at FDA, you know, worked for Monsanto, went to work for FDA, went back to work for a lobbying firm that worked for Monsanto, is now back at FDA.
[02:14:02.671 --> 02:14:06.012]  And you can find story after story after story like that.
[02:14:06.787 --> 02:14:07.888]  And this is who they talk to.
[02:14:07.968 --> 02:14:10.229]  It's the only people, for the most part, that they talk to.
[02:14:10.849 --> 02:14:18.572]  And so they write regulations and they write programs that are based on the interests of how the big agribusiness companies work.
[02:14:18.713 --> 02:14:30.318]  The Cargills, the Tysons, Monsanto, ADM, Grocery Manufacturers of America, you know, all the big groceries in the country have had a major hand in this bill.
[02:14:31.038 --> 02:14:32.038]  You know, this is backwards.
[02:14:32.558 --> 02:14:38.279]  You know, if you want good quality food in this country, we need to get away from the big agribusiness.
[02:14:38.319 --> 02:14:48.761]  We need to renew our small farms, have local food, people being able to buy from people they trust, and focus on decentralized local food systems.
[02:14:49.321 --> 02:14:51.802]  And that is not in, you know, FDA's agenda.
[02:14:52.522 --> 02:14:57.923]  But the good news is, but you're on the front lines so correct me if I'm wrong, there is a renaissance
[02:14:59.108 --> 02:15:00.049]  of course.
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:17.981]  I'm becoming truly sustainable, not the UN eugenics counterfeit of that.
[02:15:18.841 --> 02:15:21.502]  And people have been voting with their pocketbook.
[02:15:22.362 --> 02:15:24.782]  Ten years ago you couldn't find organic food on store shelves.
[02:15:25.663 --> 02:15:26.583]  Now it's everywhere.
[02:15:27.323 --> 02:15:29.623]  You couldn't find non-GMO hormone milk.
[02:15:29.964 --> 02:15:32.864]  Now you can't find the milk with the hormones.
[02:15:32.884 --> 02:15:34.264]  Of course, they still sell it.
[02:15:34.304 --> 02:15:36.365]  It's added to the other products and cheese and things.
[02:15:37.325 --> 02:15:51.709]  And from my research, a lot of this attempt to really take over or accelerate the takeover of family farms and ranches is in response to the movement they're seeing by people to basically come out of Babylon.
[02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:55.690]  I think that's a very good assessment of the situation.
[02:15:55.710 --> 02:15:56.150]  There is.
[02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:59.051]  It's wonderful to watch the local food movement grow.
[02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:01.391]  And it's not just the farmers.
[02:16:01.491 --> 02:16:03.852]  It's the farmers and the consumers working together.
[02:16:04.828 --> 02:16:08.151]  And that, you know, it's critical, and we are natural partners.
[02:16:08.611 --> 02:16:13.776]  The farmers are producing good food for the consumers, and the consumers are providing a fair living wage for farmers.
[02:16:13.936 --> 02:16:15.257]  And it's fantastic.
[02:16:15.858 --> 02:16:17.099]  And if this continues...
[02:16:18.257 --> 02:16:20.858]  The children get to drive out once a week to the farms they like.
[02:16:20.878 --> 02:16:22.719]  They get to see the cows, the goats, the chickens.
[02:16:23.259 --> 02:16:28.662]  Then they get the idea to move to the country, put in a few plum trees, start making their own jam.
[02:16:28.682 --> 02:16:33.824]  We start becoming humans again who are meant to be out in the sunshine and the dirt.
[02:16:33.844 --> 02:16:35.565]  And we go from being 90% urban to maybe 20-30% rural.
[02:16:35.585 --> 02:16:36.925]  That panics the social engineers.
[02:16:41.618 --> 02:16:49.123]  And it goes counter to what they've been saying for decades, which is the stated goal has been to have fewer and fewer farmers.
[02:16:49.183 --> 02:16:50.564]  I mean, it's not a secret.
[02:16:51.045 --> 02:16:56.308]  They think that farming is, you know, a low-value profession.
[02:16:56.569 --> 02:16:58.910]  We want as few people in it as possible.
[02:16:59.290 --> 02:17:00.551]  Get people off the land.
[02:17:00.571 --> 02:17:03.974]  They bring in the illegals with big agribusiness to undercut the real farms.
[02:17:07.372 --> 02:17:08.793]  No, it's a mechanized war.
[02:17:08.854 --> 02:17:10.996]  It's a mechanized, stated UN plan.
[02:17:11.076 --> 02:17:11.636]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:17:12.217 --> 02:17:13.438]  Well, no, not at all.
[02:17:13.718 --> 02:17:23.188]  But, um, the thing is, what we're describing, you know, this wonderful renaissance, as you were saying, you know, ten years ago, it was very hard to get local foods or organic foods in many places.
[02:17:23.928 --> 02:17:26.931]  And ten years ago, big agribusiness didn't worry about us.
[02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:28.793]  We were too small to worry about.
[02:17:29.234 --> 02:17:30.215]  It wasn't a big deal.
[02:17:30.936 --> 02:17:37.842]  Now, the local food movement is growing by so many leaps and bounds, and there's so much energy behind it, and so much publicity.
[02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:41.506]  You know, books like Omnivore's Dilemma, and movies like Food, Inc.
[02:17:41.766 --> 02:17:44.008]  And I'm going to say this right now, and then have you continue.
[02:17:44.869 --> 02:17:47.491]  If you want to defeat the New World Order, folks, start a garden.
[02:17:48.072 --> 02:17:50.774]  It is the act of becoming a human again.
[02:17:50.794 --> 02:17:55.519]  It is the act of the agrarian culture that will bring us back to humanity.
[02:17:55.539 --> 02:17:57.280]  It's one of the single things we can do
[02:17:58.041 --> 02:18:00.485]  To cut off their power and their control.
[02:18:00.885 --> 02:18:02.668]  And so, this is the revolution.
[02:18:02.848 --> 02:18:03.349]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:04.318 --> 02:18:06.119]  So I think that's a wonderful statement.
[02:18:06.199 --> 02:18:13.121]  Reconnecting with our food, growing your own garden, you know, getting to know the people who produce your food, going out to the farm.
[02:18:13.661 --> 02:18:15.082]  Reconnecting with the food is central.
[02:18:15.542 --> 02:18:17.422]  And what we have to do is we have to protect that.
[02:18:17.582 --> 02:18:21.544]  Because what's happening is there's a huge amount of momentum behind this movement.
[02:18:22.284 --> 02:18:29.086]  And if it's allowed to continue, it will continue to grow by leaps and bounds and become the dominant movement.
[02:18:29.787 --> 02:18:33.748]  Unfortunately, if things like Senate Bill 510, the current food safety bill,
[02:18:37.314 --> 02:18:42.477]  And you notice they've already built up these paramilitary armies of Enviro, police and others.
[02:18:42.937 --> 02:18:52.783]  Every day I hear about them going after small farms, small gardens, Amish, I mean SWAT teams, undercover at the farmers markets here in Austin.
[02:18:52.803 --> 02:18:54.383]  There's undercover cops everywhere.
[02:18:54.443 --> 02:18:55.184]  I mean, they're coming.
[02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:59.070]  And that's really one of the core problems we're facing right now.
[02:18:59.090 --> 02:19:02.251]  Specifically, you know, they've got Senate Bill 510 in the Senate.
[02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:03.751]  It's been installed there for months.
[02:19:04.511 --> 02:19:08.773]  But now there's all this momentum to pass it because of the egg recall.
[02:19:08.953 --> 02:19:10.773]  You know, half a billion eggs recalled.
[02:19:11.333 --> 02:19:12.674]  FDA needs more power.
[02:19:12.694 --> 02:19:14.774]  And that was a mega-producer that did that!
[02:19:14.854 --> 02:19:17.115]  Again, but it won't be pointed at them, though.
[02:19:17.685 --> 02:19:18.706]  Exactly, and that's the thing.
[02:19:18.746 --> 02:19:29.292]  I mean, what should be coming out from this egg scare, what people should realize, is that FDA isn't using the power it has now to regulate the big agribusiness.
[02:19:29.853 --> 02:19:32.374]  They don't go after the mega factory farms.
[02:19:32.834 --> 02:19:38.278]  They go after small co-ops and local producers and raw milk and all of these things FDA doesn't like.
[02:19:38.778 --> 02:19:44.082]  And simply giving the same agency more power is not going to improve the food supply.

[02:21:04.759 --> 02:21:05.679]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:06.019 --> 02:21:09.720]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:12.161]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.181 --> 02:21:17.642]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.062 --> 02:21:24.343]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[02:21:48.671 --> 02:21:50.072]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:50.632 --> 02:21:51.112]  It's here.

[02:22:00.134 --> 02:22:00.494]  Gold.
[02:22:00.734 --> 02:22:05.036]  If you listen to the radio, watch TV, or surf the net, you are hearing about gold.
[02:22:05.296 --> 02:22:07.857]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[02:22:08.118 --> 02:22:09.238]  The answer might surprise you.
[02:22:09.538 --> 02:22:11.919]  We protect ourselves and our families from many things.
[02:22:11.939 --> 02:22:13.300]  Do you have medical insurance?
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:14.380]  Is your home insured?
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.761]  Do you carry life insurance?
[02:22:16.001 --> 02:22:17.241]  How about financial insurance?
[02:22:17.562 --> 02:22:19.182]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[02:22:19.522 --> 02:22:22.964]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[02:22:23.224 --> 02:22:24.845]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[02:22:25.265 --> 02:22:26.185]  Do you trust the dollar?
[02:22:26.205 --> 02:22:27.465]  Do you trust the economy?
[02:22:27.485 --> 02:22:28.626]  Do you trust the government?
[02:22:28.906 --> 02:22:30.806]  Gold has always been something you can trust.
[02:22:31.086 --> 02:22:33.747]  For thousands of years, people have put their faith in gold.
[02:22:34.067 --> 02:22:35.187]  Where will you put your faith?

[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:02.601]  How would that make you feel?
[02:23:02.821 --> 02:23:04.182]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:23:04.543 --> 02:23:06.824]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:23:07.085 --> 02:23:14.370]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:15.991]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:23:16.151 --> 02:23:18.813]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[02:23:18.893 --> 02:23:23.937]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:23:24.197 --> 02:23:29.201]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:23:29.421 --> 02:23:34.282]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[02:23:44.225 --> 02:23:46.985]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.

[02:24:08.732 --> 02:24:15.778]  Why do the mega banks, the robber barons for the last hundred years fund communism, socialism, collectivism under many different names?
[02:24:16.639 --> 02:24:17.619]  Because they run the show!
[02:24:20.082 --> 02:24:25.106]  And it doesn't matter what government agency is out there, they're getting bigger and they're treating you like trash.
[02:24:25.906 --> 02:24:29.950]  Now, Judith, looking at these House and Senate bills, let's go over what's in them.
[02:24:31.118 --> 02:24:38.373]  I mean, because it really does say you can't can strawberries and sell them without government, you know, fees and regulations and inspectors who just can't wait to get in your house.
[02:24:39.451 --> 02:24:43.134]  And they're trying to shut down the farmers markets, as you said.
[02:24:43.794 --> 02:24:45.716]  They are going after garage sales.
[02:24:45.756 --> 02:24:49.719]  I mean, they don't want us doing anything that didn't run through a scanner.
[02:24:50.039 --> 02:24:51.921]  So they know exactly what you're buying, what you're doing.
[02:24:52.261 --> 02:24:54.943]  Let's go over this and how we defeat this legislation.
[02:24:54.983 --> 02:24:56.544]  But then there's the second part of the story.
[02:24:56.925 --> 02:25:00.627]  They're already implementing all this before they even have the law in place.
[02:25:00.668 --> 02:25:00.988]  Go ahead.
[02:25:02.125 --> 02:25:11.129]  What I'd like to focus on is Senate Bill 510, because that's the bill that's active right now, and we just got word that there's a good chance it'll be voted on next week.
[02:25:11.689 --> 02:25:14.451]  So, you know, that is where the action's happening right now.
[02:25:15.271 --> 02:25:16.772]  And there's a lot in this bill.
[02:25:16.872 --> 02:25:18.592]  It's 225 pages long.
[02:25:19.013 --> 02:25:21.994]  So I'm going to focus on just a few core provisions out of it.
[02:25:22.794 --> 02:25:26.336]  There's one section that's what they call Produce Safety Standards.
[02:25:27.088 --> 02:25:32.072]  And this applies to anyone who is growing, you know, fruits and vegetables for sale.
[02:25:32.553 --> 02:25:36.837]  Includes, you know, local CSAs, people selling to farmers markets, farm to school programs.
[02:25:36.857 --> 02:25:39.879]  Yeah, you're not going to sell peaches on the side of the road, they're going to SWAT team you.
[02:25:39.919 --> 02:25:40.700]  And I mean, they do.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.403]  They have an undercover cop come up, buy a peach, and then they get to arrest you.
[02:25:44.964 --> 02:25:54.012]  So the first stage, before you get to the enforcement stage though, the first stage is they're going to be telling you, they're going to be adopting regulations on how to grow and harvest these crops.
[02:25:54.557 --> 02:26:11.305]  The FDA is going to be empowered to say, here's what kind of water you can use, what standards you need to meet for your compost, when you could use animal manure, when you can't use animal manure, whether you need toilets in an area, what your workers need to wear, what you need to wear, what you need to wash in.
[02:26:11.325 --> 02:26:14.386]  You know, really long, extensive regulations.
[02:26:15.367 --> 02:26:18.188]  And, you know, this is something, by the way, FDA is already working on.
[02:26:18.228 --> 02:26:22.650]  As you said, even without this bill, FDA is looking at trying to adopt these kinds of regulations.
[02:26:23.749 --> 02:26:26.890]  And you would have to, right now, there are no exemptions.
[02:26:27.451 --> 02:26:37.475]  Right now, the way the bill is written, if you grow a large backyard garden and you take your excess produce to the local farmer's market, because what else are you going to do with all that squash?
[02:26:38.275 --> 02:26:41.777]  You'd have to comply with federal regulation on how you grew that squash.
[02:26:41.797 --> 02:26:44.378]  So it's a federal takeover of just everything?
[02:26:45.158 --> 02:26:46.859]  It's incredibly expensive.
[02:26:47.552 --> 02:26:48.873]  And we've never seen anything like it.
[02:26:49.053 --> 02:26:52.814]  I mean, this is very different even from the power that we already have.
[02:26:52.854 --> 02:26:54.535]  Well, our health care is government-run now.
[02:26:54.555 --> 02:26:55.735]  I mean, this is the new America.
[02:26:56.295 --> 02:26:57.436]  So that's one big section.
[02:26:57.476 --> 02:27:02.458]  The next section that I try to focus on is what you're talking about in terms of jam-making.
[02:27:02.638 --> 02:27:06.419]  It applies to anyone who does any kind of food processing.
[02:27:06.879 --> 02:27:09.801]  And that means jam-making, cheese-making, bread-making.
[02:27:09.821 --> 02:27:11.341]  You know, someone who makes pies.
[02:27:11.361 --> 02:27:13.182]  Someone who makes sun-dried tomatoes.
[02:27:13.782 --> 02:27:17.585]  Pretty much if you take raw ingredients and you change them in any form or fashion.
[02:27:17.645 --> 02:27:24.230]  And they're already using local zoning under Agenda 21 written by the UN to arrest people for uncut grass for gardens.
[02:27:24.251 --> 02:27:25.732]  I mean, it's already happening.
[02:27:26.312 --> 02:27:38.622]  And what happens now, or what would happen if Bill 510 passes, is that all these folks who are doing small-scale food production would again come under federal regulation.
[02:27:39.318 --> 02:27:47.363]  And then basically, food wardens like game wardens, you know, the kid that was a control freak in school, now he's got a gun on his side and he's coming.
[02:27:59.588 --> 02:28:15.293]  Well, and you have to come, so Federal Agent will come, and you'll have to create this very large, convoluted paperwork plan that tells, you know, exactly where there could be a problem, what you're going to do about it, how you're going to monitor it, how you're going to test it, what corrective action you're going to take.
[02:28:15.753 --> 02:28:19.815]  It's really detailed, and it's up to their approval.
[02:28:19.915 --> 02:28:23.016]  So if they don't like what you've written, they can say, go back and do it again.
[02:28:23.036 --> 02:28:25.156]  Hey, but that's like Mao's Great Leap Forward.
[02:28:25.236 --> 02:28:27.057]  I mean, the government's going to help us.
[02:28:28.254 --> 02:28:35.863]  You know, it's, you know, there is, there are a lot of problems at the big agribusiness, big ag, you know, big food level.
[02:28:36.244 --> 02:28:38.286]  But, you know, we're not seeing problems.
[02:28:38.306 --> 02:28:46.035]  You know, the local jam makers... Yeah, and folks are finding out the local markets are better, and that's not going to be allowed, so here come the police!
[02:28:46.897 --> 02:28:51.919]  It's going to be, you know, it's one of those things that it's going to, I'm not sure how I say won't be allowed, but it's going to be a lot more difficult.
[02:28:52.119 --> 02:28:59.221]  It's going to be one of those things that we're going to go from this thriving, vibrant, growing movement to, you know, a few people trying to hold on.
[02:28:59.721 --> 02:29:01.422]  Yeah, now they're going to nickel and dime you.
[02:29:01.462 --> 02:29:04.363]  Listen, they already have undercover police at the Austin markets.
[02:29:04.943 --> 02:29:05.983]  I mean, they're already out there.
[02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:08.464]  They're not arresting the illegal aliens, kidnapping people.
[02:29:08.784 --> 02:29:11.065]  They're there harassing old women selling strawberries.
[02:29:11.755 --> 02:29:14.017]  And, you know, the bigger it gets, the harder it is.
[02:29:14.177 --> 02:29:23.225]  You know, when it's at a local level, when it's at a state level, you at least have the opportunity to go face-to-face with folks, go up to the state capitol and talk with them.
[02:29:23.425 --> 02:29:30.171]  I don't know, I tried talking to some state police this morning and they looked right at me and they said, you get in your car and you get out of here.
[02:29:30.711 --> 02:29:31.412]  Get out of here!
[02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:36.985]  If you were to stay there, a long segment coming up, you'll be able to roll through all these subsections and the enforcement areas.
[02:29:37.005 --> 02:29:41.846]  We'll tie it into Agenda 21 and a lot of other things like the Livable Communities Act going through.
[02:29:41.866 --> 02:29:44.007]  Folks, you want to live in Soviet China?
[02:29:44.267 --> 02:29:45.027]  Communist China?
[02:29:45.588 --> 02:29:46.988]  You're going to get a front row seat to it.
[02:29:47.028 --> 02:29:48.989]  Every control freak's going to be squatting on you.
[02:29:50.549 --> 02:29:51.430]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.930 --> 02:29:53.550]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.471 --> 02:29:57.132]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:05.881]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:07.122 --> 02:30:11.884]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:12.264 --> 02:30:19.288]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:20.989 --> 02:30:23.311]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:25.052 --> 02:30:27.013]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:29.489 --> 02:30:33.372]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:30:34.072 --> 02:30:37.195]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:30:37.915 --> 02:30:38.716]  Others don't.
[02:30:39.136 --> 02:30:41.017]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:41.277 --> 02:30:42.799]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:43.079 --> 02:30:45.621]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:45.961 --> 02:30:52.225]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:52.585 --> 02:30:54.807]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:55.287 --> 02:30:57.329]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:30:57.649 --> 02:30:58.530]  Others don't.
[02:30:59.653 --> 02:31:03.876]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.196 --> 02:31:04.797]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.117 --> 02:31:08.259]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:09.100]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:13.944]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.284 --> 02:31:14.744]  It's true.
[02:31:15.024 --> 02:31:19.588]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:19.908 --> 02:31:20.448]  Number 3.
[02:31:20.729 --> 02:31:24.011]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.311 --> 02:31:28.014]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.

[02:33:07.344 --> 02:33:11.426]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:11.806 --> 02:33:15.648]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:16.609 --> 02:33:21.951]  If you want to know where all of this is coming from, it's Agenda 21 of the United Nations.
[02:33:23.152 --> 02:33:24.713]  All the major governments work with them.
[02:33:24.733 --> 02:33:26.313]  The Chinese government loves it.
[02:33:27.174 --> 02:33:28.895]  It's what they did with the Great Leap Forward.
[02:33:31.056 --> 02:33:33.337]  Literally, I had a top professor on agreeing last hour.
[02:33:35.283 --> 02:33:36.424]  And it's total control.
[02:33:36.484 --> 02:33:38.485]  You control food and water, you control it all.
[02:33:38.865 --> 02:33:41.967]  Don't collect rainwater, you know, a month in jail.
[02:33:42.528 --> 02:33:43.248]  Here's a headline.
[02:33:43.268 --> 02:33:46.150]  60 days in jail for overgrown grass in New York State.
[02:33:46.770 --> 02:33:47.551]  WVLA.
[02:33:47.991 --> 02:33:49.512]  They want to pack their prisons.
[02:33:50.793 --> 02:33:55.055]  Now, they were giving people jail time here in Austin for three-inch grass, mainly old folks.
[02:33:55.896 --> 02:34:02.140]  I went and showed city council people with two-foot grass, the health department with foot-tall grass, and they shut it down real quick.
[02:34:03.751 --> 02:34:06.172]  But you've got to stand up against these crooks.
[02:34:06.532 --> 02:34:10.494]  I mean, it's a parasitic government in almost every level.
[02:34:12.755 --> 02:34:15.976]  And the local rules are federally and internationally written.
[02:34:16.476 --> 02:34:19.377]  They've got international zoning law, SB 1619, SB 1619.
[02:34:19.537 --> 02:34:22.498]  The livable communities, which is a biodiversity smart growth.
[02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:41.570]  situation and their stated goal is the end of our industrial society and that includes farming and they've also got new rules they're trying to push and even if they can't have Congress pass it, they're saying any dust from tilling is not allowed.
[02:34:42.612 --> 02:34:43.213]  Any dust!
[02:34:44.284 --> 02:34:47.546]  Unless you buy variances like big agribusiness does.
[02:34:47.586 --> 02:34:58.450]  I saw the cases years ago in the Associated Press where there'd be thousands of violations in Arkansas and they wouldn't get in trouble but then some little plant would get one violation and be shut down.
[02:34:58.851 --> 02:35:01.192]  Going back to Judith McGarry of
[02:35:02.212 --> 02:35:05.535]  uh... the groups that are out there fighting all of this.
[02:35:05.615 --> 02:35:07.417]  I appreciate her joining us.
[02:35:07.437 --> 02:35:09.299]  The website's farmandranchfreedom.org.
[02:35:09.559 --> 02:35:11.100]  They're trying to pass this bill next week.
[02:35:11.361 --> 02:35:16.946]  Let's continue walking through some of the things it does and then let's get into the enforcement arm and then how we fight this.
[02:35:16.986 --> 02:35:17.286]  Judith.
[02:35:18.387 --> 02:35:28.116]  So another one of the things it does is it provides, this is partly enforcement but they don't phrase it as enforcement, it provides that FDA can charge you for the cost of the re-inspection.
[02:35:28.769 --> 02:35:37.616]  So let's say they come through your little commercial kitchen where you're making a small amount of jam for the local market, and they find you've done something wrong.
[02:35:37.757 --> 02:35:38.517]  One violation.
[02:35:39.358 --> 02:35:41.580]  They can charge the cost of coming back.
[02:35:42.549 --> 02:35:57.102]  And, you know, charge their travel expenses, charge their staff rates, you know, put the financial burden on that small little jam maker, which creates a wonderful incentive for FDA to keep telling small producers, no, you've done something wrong.
[02:35:57.122 --> 02:35:58.804]  Let's remember, the FDA for more than...
[02:35:59.284 --> 02:36:10.108]  You know, several decades allows certain amounts of cockroach parts, cockroach feces, rat droppings, rat hair in the food legally, but you're not gonna be on that standard.
[02:36:10.408 --> 02:36:16.970]  If they don't like how your kitchen looks and doesn't have an OSHA runway to it, you know, you're gonna have trouble.
[02:36:17.503 --> 02:36:21.185]  And that's one of the core issues here is FDA's discretion.
[02:36:21.665 --> 02:36:29.589]  There were a lot of changes made to this bill that were intended to sort of be good for small and sustainable farms.
[02:36:30.149 --> 02:36:32.790]  But they all come down to FDA's discretion.
[02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:35.692]  So FDA is supposed to provide flexibility.
[02:36:36.012 --> 02:36:38.113]  FDA is supposed to take into consideration
[02:36:38.553 --> 02:36:40.494]  There's no death panels in the bill?
[02:37:06.246 --> 02:37:09.388]  Yeah, and I think some of the staff literally doesn't understand it.
[02:37:09.468 --> 02:37:17.313]  I mean, to be fair to them, I think they don't understand the reality of what it means to be farming on the ground, what it means to be a small-scale producer.
[02:37:17.893 --> 02:37:20.015]  And they need to hear from people.
[02:37:20.215 --> 02:37:23.377]  We need calls going in to the senators right now.
[02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:29.534]  Saying, you know, you either need to kill this bill or at the very least exempt out the small-scale producers.
[02:37:29.634 --> 02:37:35.198]  But you've seen all the videos of the Amish and others being raided by police with guns drawn.
[02:37:35.219 --> 02:37:42.084]  I mean, you've seen those countless videos coming out where they come in and aim guns at people, you know, who have small food co-ops.
[02:37:42.944 --> 02:37:45.686]  Yeah, I mean, it's scary what's going on.
[02:37:45.867 --> 02:37:49.810]  It is very scary what is going on and it's at every level.
[02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:52.772]  And right now it's scattered incidents.
[02:37:53.587 --> 02:38:01.608]  Um, but the problem is anytime one of those incidents happens, all of us who are in small-scale production look around and go, ooh, could that be us next?
[02:38:02.369 --> 02:38:09.370]  You know, it's terrifying to live with this idea that, you know, significant chunks of the government don't like small-scale producers.
[02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:21.652]  And I'll say, you know, and Alex, you and I may disagree on this, but I've talked to some of the government officials at different levels, state, local, federal, and there are individuals in that who are good folks who do support us, who do want to see,
[02:38:22.574 --> 02:38:25.844]  Judith, Judith, the same thing in Communist China or Nazi Germany.
[02:38:26.165 --> 02:38:28.271]  There were Nazis that tried to save Jews.
[02:38:28.833 --> 02:38:30.277]  The issue here is that...
[02:38:31.647 --> 02:38:35.348]  Is the direction at the top we know is to shut down family farms.
[02:38:35.488 --> 02:38:37.069]  As you said earlier, that's admitted.
[02:38:37.669 --> 02:38:45.812]  And I mean, we have John P. Holdren, head of the White House Science Department, saying they want to destroy an industry and literally knock us back to the Stone Age.
[02:38:45.852 --> 02:38:47.553]  I played that clip on Sunday.
[02:38:47.993 --> 02:38:51.875]  So yes, there are a lot of people that don't like what they're doing, but it doesn't matter.
[02:38:51.935 --> 02:38:52.675]  They still do it.
[02:38:53.123 --> 02:38:54.143]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[02:38:54.183 --> 02:39:11.988]  I just wanted to put in, because I deal with some of these good folks on a regular basis, but the problem is the policies, the people in charge, the dominant theme is still get big or get out, and they're still listening to big agribusiness, and they're still supporting and promoting big agribusiness.
[02:39:12.759 --> 02:39:17.742]  And this bill gives them every bit of flexibility they need to continue doing that.
[02:39:17.882 --> 02:39:29.049]  They can continue to basically give a lot of big food and big agribusiness a free ride and, you know, slam down on small-scale producers, you know, the way that bill's written right now.
[02:39:31.330 --> 02:39:32.011]  Absolutely.
[02:39:33.432 --> 02:39:34.112]  So what do we do?
[02:39:34.152 --> 02:39:35.012]  We call Congress?
[02:39:35.052 --> 02:39:37.114]  Are there any key senators to call about this bill?
[02:39:37.974 --> 02:39:40.756]  I think the key is to call the senators from your state.
[02:39:41.363 --> 02:39:43.924]  So, right now, that's who you're going to have influence with.
[02:39:44.664 --> 02:39:46.425]  I'd encourage everyone to call both Senators.
[02:39:46.565 --> 02:39:48.265]  Remember, you have two Senators from your state.
[02:39:49.746 --> 02:39:52.006]  You know, I hope you know who they are, everybody.
[02:39:52.246 --> 02:39:55.287]  If you don't, you can just call the Capitol Switchboard line.
[02:39:55.587 --> 02:39:55.807]  It's 202-224-3121.
[02:39:55.927 --> 02:39:58.548]  And ask, you know, say I live in Texas.
[02:39:58.568 --> 02:40:01.369]  I want to talk to my Senators.
[02:40:05.430 --> 02:40:08.491]  And tell them to amend or oppose Senate Bill 510.
[02:40:09.272 --> 02:40:16.855]  There is going to be an amendment proposed to exempt small-scale direct marketing producers from the two provisions we've been talking about.
[02:40:17.035 --> 02:40:22.558]  Are Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Bilderberg member, and Cornyn supporting S510?
[02:40:22.838 --> 02:40:27.340]  We don't have commitments from them either way yet.
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.541]  They have not publicly taken positions yet.
[02:40:31.581 --> 02:40:39.727]  And there's a new twist, speaking of enforcement, which we've sort of skimmed over, that there may be an amendment introduced to also add criminal penalties.
[02:40:39.767 --> 02:40:40.588]  No, of course!
[02:40:41.188 --> 02:40:53.437]  So, up till now, there haven't been criminal penalties on that bill, but Senator Leahy of Vermont introduced the bill last week to add criminal penalties, and word is that it may get tacked on as an amendment to Senate Bill 510.
[02:40:54.238 --> 02:40:55.859]  What are the prospects for the bill?
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:59.102]  I mean, is it looking bad, like it's going to pass?
[02:41:00.285 --> 02:41:05.906]  You know, I've given up trying to predict this thing because I've made so many incorrect predictions on it in the last year, Alex.
[02:41:08.107 --> 02:41:13.488]  Senator Coburn from Oklahoma is very strongly opposing passage of the bill currently.
[02:41:13.508 --> 02:41:20.209]  His main issue that he's talked about the most is the financial impact of it and the fact that it would increase the debt.
[02:41:20.449 --> 02:41:21.890]  This is an unfunded mandate.
[02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:27.951]  But there's some indication that they may be able to work that out and bring the bill to a vote next week.
[02:41:28.712 --> 02:41:30.695]  I think if it comes to a vote, it will pass.
[02:41:31.556 --> 02:41:43.310]  I think if it comes to the floor of the Senate, there are going to be enough Senators who don't want a headline that reads, you know, Senator so-and-so opposes food safety bill, that it will ultimately pass if it comes to a vote.
[02:41:46.292 --> 02:41:53.922]  A, there's room for it not to come to a vote, and B, if it comes to a vote, we need an amendment to exempt our small-scale producers.
[02:41:54.042 --> 02:42:01.552]  It's not perfect, it's not the optimum, you know, it's not everything I would have wanted, but it's a good, strong amendment that's being proposed by Senator Kester.
[02:42:01.957 --> 02:42:06.642]  And they just sell this hysteria of, oh, something's on the spinach coming from big factory farms.
[02:42:07.383 --> 02:42:08.544]  Oh, you know, the eggs.
[02:42:08.644 --> 02:42:11.708]  Again, big mega-farm, big production facility.
[02:42:12.068 --> 02:42:13.750]  Meanwhile, I've done the research.
[02:42:14.310 --> 02:42:16.893]  Listen to Derry Brownfield, who has constant guest on covering this.
[02:42:17.694 --> 02:42:27.638]  It's on record that they do almost nothing to look at pork, beef, poultry, produce coming out of Latin America, coming out of Asia.
[02:42:28.719 --> 02:42:33.901]  Almost all the enforcement is just harassing the living daylights out of small farms and ranches.
[02:42:34.721 --> 02:42:37.122]  And again, that's not going to really change under this bill.
[02:42:37.202 --> 02:42:40.884]  The bill does have provisions to deal with foreign facilities.
[02:42:41.658 --> 02:42:43.359]  But there are two big catches to that.
[02:42:43.619 --> 02:42:46.421]  The biggest catch is it deals with third-party certifiers.
[02:42:47.001 --> 02:42:52.105]  So, you know, they're going to go hire companies in China to inspect Chinese facilities.
[02:42:53.165 --> 02:42:57.128]  Well, we also have the FDA saying melamine in milk is not bad for children.
[02:42:57.328 --> 02:42:58.509]  Pull up the AP headline.
[02:42:58.989 --> 02:43:01.751]  Melamine not, you know, some melamine not bad for children.
[02:43:01.971 --> 02:43:09.776]  So something that causes kidney failure and death, they say that's okay from China, but Judith McGarry, she's not going to make Blackberry Jam.
[02:43:11.325 --> 02:43:11.605]  Exactly.
[02:43:11.685 --> 02:43:16.787]  I mean, what we need, the track record of imported food is very poor.
[02:43:16.928 --> 02:43:18.108]  I mean, very, very bad.
[02:43:18.828 --> 02:43:31.494]  And the idea that third-party certification, that hiring companies within those countries is going to somehow solve the problem, really defies normal common sense and defies the track record.
[02:43:31.514 --> 02:43:33.155]  It defies what we've seen happening.
[02:43:34.015 --> 02:43:49.692]  I spoke with one of my folks, actually, who has a supplement company, and he was telling me he brings in ingredients from China, he does, but they do quality control, and he kept hiring companies in China to try to do quality control over there, and every time it failed.
[02:43:50.212 --> 02:43:54.737]  You know, every time the quality control folks basically sold out.
[02:43:55.615 --> 02:43:59.778]  And he had to, you know, return a bunch of stuff and keep doing the quality control here.
[02:44:00.259 --> 02:44:02.561]  And he's a private company and he chooses to do that.
[02:44:02.701 --> 02:44:09.386]  Did you know about 92% or more, but the numbers I see are 92% of our vaccines are now made in China?
[02:44:10.967 --> 02:44:12.628]  You know, that's a terrifying number.
[02:44:12.648 --> 02:44:16.912]  But again, that's not the problem though.
[02:44:17.893 --> 02:44:20.675]  It's people selling pumpkins.
[02:44:22.423 --> 02:44:28.866]  And it's, you know, they say that, and I hear, you know, I hear health inspectors talk about how dangerous food in the open air is.
[02:44:29.006 --> 02:44:29.846]  It's amazing.
[02:44:30.167 --> 02:44:31.287]  They're scared of open air.
[02:44:31.747 --> 02:44:34.329]  And the track record, again, I like going to track records.
[02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:36.349]  I like going to what have we seen.
[02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:40.371]  We don't see foodborne illnesses coming out of the small producers.
[02:44:40.832 --> 02:44:43.593]  You know, occasionally, very small, very sporadic.
[02:44:43.733 --> 02:44:45.654]  And the media drops it when it does.
[02:44:46.758 --> 02:44:47.399]  So rare!
[02:44:47.939 --> 02:44:52.322]  And when it does happen, you know immediately where it comes from, you know immediately how to stop it.
[02:44:52.462 --> 02:44:55.504]  It's not a widespread issue.
[02:44:55.604 --> 02:44:56.705]  Well, let's give the bottom line.
[02:44:56.925 --> 02:45:01.249]  You know, they irradiate the meat, they MSG, all this stuff.
[02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:11.156]  They know it's the big mega producers that are as dirty as you can imagine, and they know they can't compete with good locally produced food that's organic and non-GMO.
[02:45:11.756 --> 02:45:13.718]  And they know there's a rebellion worldwide to it.
[02:45:13.758 --> 02:45:17.160]  Everything that's happening here is happening worldwide, because this is UN written, as I said earlier.
[02:45:17.761 --> 02:45:24.867]  What are some other attacks, separate from the bill S-510, that folks need to really get on today, tomorrow, and next week?
[02:45:25.827 --> 02:45:27.669]  But what are some of the other attacks?
[02:45:27.689 --> 02:45:29.390]  I know there's a lot of other stuff going on.
[02:45:29.410 --> 02:45:31.792]  I see the IRS three years ago saying,
[02:45:32.913 --> 02:45:39.704]  If your farm or ranch doesn't make money, you work in town but still run it just to keep your farm, to pay the taxes, that's not enough.
[02:45:40.385 --> 02:45:42.628]  We're going to get rid of any tax exemptions you have.
[02:45:42.889 --> 02:45:44.592]  I mean, they're really pulling the stops out.
[02:45:46.361 --> 02:45:48.123]  Gosh, the list of threats is so long.
[02:45:48.163 --> 02:45:51.046]  I mean, right now, the most immediate one is Senate Bill 510.
[02:45:51.166 --> 02:45:54.029]  I mean, that's the one that is happening right now.
[02:45:54.489 --> 02:45:57.172]  No long-term animal ID is still out there.
[02:45:57.412 --> 02:45:58.133]  It's not dead.
[02:45:58.373 --> 02:45:59.635]  It's still a continuing issue.
[02:46:00.796 --> 02:46:02.798]  We've got issues of GMOs.
[02:46:03.158 --> 02:46:04.240]  There's a lot of fighting.
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:07.203]  There's actually a very current fight happening over genetically engineered salmon.
[02:46:08.090 --> 02:46:17.632]  And, you know, if they manage to push through... Oh yeah, the FDA is going to approve a GMO cross-species that's had insect genes added and will extinct regular salmon, major universities have found.
[02:46:18.012 --> 02:46:19.112]  That's okay, though.
[02:46:19.913 --> 02:46:23.453]  Well, yeah, I mean, according to FDA it is, but we've got a chance to fight it.
[02:46:23.553 --> 02:46:25.654]  Exactly, that's okay... It's the first animal.
[02:46:26.694 --> 02:46:26.994]  Go ahead.
[02:46:27.154 --> 02:46:30.335]  Sorry, I said, this is a key fight because it would be the first animal.
[02:46:30.871 --> 02:46:37.553]  So, you know, if we can stop them from approving it, it puts a major, you know, a major barrier in their way.
[02:46:37.873 --> 02:46:39.714]  If they approve it, well, guess what?
[02:46:39.754 --> 02:46:42.355]  The next thing on the list is genetically engineered pigs.
[02:46:43.375 --> 02:46:48.357]  So, you know, Center for Food Safety is doing excellent work on the genetically engineered salmon issue.
[02:46:49.222 --> 02:46:52.525]  And that's a very current and very immediate issue.
[02:46:53.025 --> 02:47:01.553]  There's also regulations that are trying to reduce the control of the big agribusinesses over the market, just the livestock market.
[02:47:02.574 --> 02:47:09.840]  And we're working on that issue in coordination with other groups and trying to get rules passed, and that's coming up over the next couple of months.
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:12.421]  So, you know, there's this back and forth.
[02:47:12.441 --> 02:47:20.783]  We're fighting back against agribusiness and trying to break that control, and at the same time trying to prevent them from getting new, bad legislation and regulations in.
[02:47:21.623 --> 02:47:27.745]  Well, going back to the salmon, here's all these fake environmentalists that want to put taxes on carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[02:47:28.345 --> 02:47:38.408]  Meanwhile, they want to approve a salmon which, in major controlled trials, kills and extincts the other natural salmon, and it's a genetically engineered cross-species clone.
[02:47:39.745 --> 02:47:40.746]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:47:41.186 --> 02:47:48.530]  And they allow open-air planting of GMO cross-species plants everywhere that major studies show are killing the bees, you name it.
[02:47:48.810 --> 02:47:49.710]  They don't care about that.
[02:47:50.170 --> 02:47:56.514]  They want to send inspectors to your pecan farm, to your orange orchard.
[02:47:56.934 --> 02:48:03.317]  They want to shut down your... I mean, it's just outrageous, Judith, and thank God you're there fighting these people.
[02:48:03.357 --> 02:48:05.298]  What are some of the other threats, to let folks know briefly?
[02:48:08.102 --> 02:48:09.142]  I'm running out of issues.
[02:48:09.182 --> 02:48:10.223]  Not that I'm running out.
[02:48:10.263 --> 02:48:10.964]  There are so many.
[02:48:11.044 --> 02:48:12.465]  But those are the immediate ones.
[02:48:12.485 --> 02:48:13.726]  And that's how I tend to focus.
[02:48:13.746 --> 02:48:16.047]  Because God knows we've got our hands full.
[02:48:16.708 --> 02:48:18.029]  And GMOs is a big one.
[02:48:19.450 --> 02:48:21.611]  It was the most popular talk at our conference.
[02:48:21.651 --> 02:48:27.295]  We had a farmer who's doing research on the effects of GMOs on health speak at our conference.
[02:48:28.056 --> 02:48:32.919]  And he showed pictures of what GMO corn is doing to pig stomachs.
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:35.141]  Animals are fed GMO corn.
[02:48:35.201 --> 02:48:36.842]  Here's what their stomachs look like.
[02:48:37.512 --> 02:48:49.978]  And you look at them and you feel sick and you go, oh, hmm, everybody I know with Crohn's disease, digestive problems, heartburn, I wonder if that might be because most of the corn and soybeans in this country are GMO.
[02:48:50.579 --> 02:48:52.820]  You know, it's really scary.
[02:48:52.900 --> 02:48:58.803]  GMO to produce their own pesticide in them, so if bugs eat it, they die, but then they feed it to us.
[02:48:58.903 --> 02:49:00.784]  Gee, that's not hard to figure out.
[02:49:01.434 --> 02:49:08.999]  And, you know, the sad thing is, I've actually seen a lot of people out there saying things like GMOs reduce the use of herbicides.
[02:49:09.419 --> 02:49:14.162]  Well, the major GMO crops, the most widespread ones, are what's called Roundup Ready crops.
[02:49:14.803 --> 02:49:22.628]  The whole point of them is that you can plant them and then spray the fields with Roundup, a herbicide, without killing the crop.
[02:49:22.668 --> 02:49:23.748]  You just kill everything else.
[02:49:24.689 --> 02:49:30.793]  The whole point of these GMO crops, frankly, is to allow for increased use of herbicides.
[02:49:31.124 --> 02:49:34.626]  Yeah, but they have all the Bt stuff that grows the pesticide in the plant.
[02:49:34.666 --> 02:49:35.947]  It's a pharmacological crop.
[02:49:36.107 --> 02:49:36.607]  That too.
[02:49:36.787 --> 02:49:38.348]  That's another branch of them.
[02:49:38.989 --> 02:49:46.213]  So, you know, the GMOs, you know, this fight with the GE Salmon, their fights over sugar beet going on, genetically engineered sugar beet.
[02:49:46.855 --> 02:49:47.296]  I'm good.
[02:50:03.112 --> 02:50:07.174]  Only way to protect ourselves is to start limiting the use of these GMO crops.
[02:50:07.354 --> 02:50:09.015]  Well, Judith, we're out of time.
[02:50:09.055 --> 02:50:10.776]  I look forward to having you on in the near future.
[02:50:11.177 --> 02:50:11.737]  God bless you.
[02:50:11.757 --> 02:50:12.637]  I want to get you in studio.
[02:50:12.657 --> 02:50:14.639]  I know you live outside Austin on your family farm.
[02:50:14.659 --> 02:50:19.441]  And I think another thing is for everybody to Google local food co-ops or farmers markets.
[02:50:19.541 --> 02:50:20.422]  Start going out.
[02:50:20.942 --> 02:50:23.183]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:50:23.543 --> 02:50:31.668]  If we move this movement of real, local, healthy food and really make it grow even faster, that'll give them even more targets to go after.
[02:50:32.168 --> 02:50:33.629]  Resistance is victory.
[02:50:33.649 --> 02:50:39.372]  We're going to come back and cover some financial news, but I really appreciate you spending time with us today.
[02:50:39.452 --> 02:50:40.892]  FarmandRanchFreedom.org.
[02:50:41.132 --> 02:50:42.413]  The bill's S-510.
[02:50:42.793 --> 02:50:43.634]  Call your senators.
[02:50:43.854 --> 02:50:44.474]  Thank you, Judith.
[02:50:44.854 --> 02:50:45.575]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:46.175 --> 02:50:46.716]  Wonderful lady.
[02:50:46.736 --> 02:50:52.125]  We're going to come back and get some of the latest news on the economy and the police state on the other side of this quick break.
[02:50:53.126 --> 02:50:54.709]  We're fighting tyranny, make no mistake.
[02:50:58.075 --> 02:51:01.238]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:01.618 --> 02:51:03.459]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:04.320]  Don't!
[02:51:04.781 --> 02:51:07.803]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:51:08.223 --> 02:51:15.349]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:51:15.329 --> 02:51:16.991]  's number one debt secret.
[02:51:17.311 --> 02:51:20.974]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:51:21.354 --> 02:51:24.097]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:51:24.518 --> 02:51:31.546]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:51:31.886 --> 02:51:32.867]  Herb K was right.
[02:51:33.067 --> 02:51:36.111]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:51:36.271 --> 02:51:37.152]  What do you have to lose?
[02:51:37.532 --> 02:51:38.472]  Stop the calls now.
[02:51:38.732 --> 02:51:40.473]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:51:40.714 --> 02:51:41.294]  Get Herb K.'
[02:51:41.214 --> 02:51:43.475]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[02:51:44.356 --> 02:51:44.936]  That's 800-405-7850.
[02:51:44.956 --> 02:51:44.996]  800-405-7850.
[02:51:57.830 --> 02:52:02.693]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:02.793 --> 02:52:03.574]  What have we got?
[02:52:03.794 --> 02:52:05.915]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:06.255 --> 02:52:06.996]  A republic.
[02:52:07.256 --> 02:52:09.837]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:09.897 --> 02:52:11.819]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:12.159 --> 02:52:14.080]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:15.461]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:15.881 --> 02:52:17.002]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:17.202 --> 02:52:17.602]  Children?
[02:52:17.802 --> 02:52:18.603]  Our education?
[02:52:18.923 --> 02:52:19.563]  Our money?
[02:52:19.744 --> 02:52:23.406]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:23.766 --> 02:52:27.429]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:28.449]  You're being warned!
[02:52:28.730 --> 02:52:29.570]  We have the facts.
[02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:30.871]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:30.931 --> 02:52:31.812]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:31.832 --> 02:52:32.672]  We have common law.
[02:52:32.712 --> 02:52:34.974]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:45.441]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:45.582 --> 02:52:46.422]  Don't Tread on Me.

[02:52:49.224 --> 02:52:50.045]  Afraid to answer it?

[02:53:06.361 --> 02:53:13.365]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:53:13.645 --> 02:53:15.687]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:53:15.867 --> 02:53:17.648]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:53:17.888 --> 02:53:22.411]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?

[02:54:03.683 --> 02:54:06.866]  Alright, final segment for this hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:09.168 --> 02:54:13.271]  The hour coming up, I get into the state police run that I had in this morning.
[02:54:13.512 --> 02:54:17.875]  Very depressing, but very important information being covered coming up.
[02:54:19.417 --> 02:54:23.140]  They did find the article, I think that was out of the Washington Post, I'd seen it in the AP.
[02:54:24.541 --> 02:54:26.121]  Uh, where is U.S.
[02:54:26.161 --> 02:54:27.142]  baby formula safe?
[02:54:27.222 --> 02:54:31.083]  Nobody knows for sure, but several experts tell WebMD they think U.S.
[02:54:31.123 --> 02:54:34.383]  baby formula is safe despite containing trace amounts of melamine.
[02:54:34.784 --> 02:54:38.925]  Yeah, yeah, no, you can actually find the headline where the FDA says some melamine's safe.
[02:54:39.905 --> 02:54:44.266]  Uh, of course, it bioaccumulates in the kidneys and can cause kidney failure, but so what?
[02:54:45.006 --> 02:54:47.008]  Let's just shut down local farms and ranches.
[02:54:47.048 --> 02:54:48.209]  And here's a new article today.
[02:54:48.689 --> 02:54:54.474]  Feds target Americans as terrorists in effort to break back of big government resistance.
[02:54:56.696 --> 02:55:05.363]  And it gets into, we've got a group coming on tomorrow, a state representative put on the terror list for being part of a second amendment group in Pennsylvania.
[02:55:05.423 --> 02:55:07.024]  I mean, this is the bizarreness.
[02:55:07.064 --> 02:55:07.765]  This is real.
[02:55:08.624 --> 02:55:13.386]  And folks, we reach new people on the AM and FM dial, internet, all of it, by you spreading the word.
[02:55:13.706 --> 02:55:19.188]  Please send out links to the ListenFree links and the free iPhone app to everyone you know.
[02:55:19.848 --> 02:55:21.529]  Please call your friends and family.
[02:55:21.909 --> 02:55:23.750]  Tell them to tune in to the radio broadcast daily.
[02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:27.391]  You may know all this information, but we've got to reach more people.
[02:55:27.491 --> 02:55:30.612]  Folks are really ready to hear the truth now.
[02:55:31.092 --> 02:55:37.135]  And I'm glad that we see people like Glenn Beck and others covering some of this, but they don't go one-tenth as far as they need to.
[02:55:38.015 --> 02:55:41.557]  And I'm sorry, I don't think a big Republican takeover of Congress is going to fix everything.
[02:55:41.897 --> 02:55:43.338]  It shows the people are waking up, though.
[02:55:44.018 --> 02:55:47.180]  I mean, we're in such serious times, and this depression is real.
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:49.821]  This is so real, what's happening.
[02:55:50.861 --> 02:55:53.443]  And if we just wake up to it, the nightmare can end.
[02:55:53.543 --> 02:56:00.426]  The world will never be a perfect place, but we've got a lot better chance in reversing all of this tyranny and corruption.
[02:56:01.066 --> 02:56:05.789]  But we've got to study history, we've got to see the facts, and we're reaching so many new people every day.
[02:56:06.249 --> 02:56:15.751]  Thanks to you, spreading the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, making the search terms yesterday, the top search, CNET News and others reported on Obama, Willie's stage of terror attack.
[02:56:16.091 --> 02:56:23.933]  I mean, we're really having effect, and the system's doing everything they can to try to block us and shut us down and restrict people coming to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:23.953 --> 02:56:29.695]  And we've got more and more foreign countries trying to block us from people being able to get to us, and that's because we're effective.
[02:56:30.612 --> 02:56:37.817]  Here at the very end of this hour, because gold went up to, what, just $5 short of $1,300 an ounce.
[02:56:37.877 --> 02:56:39.278]  We'll follow this tomorrow.
[02:56:39.678 --> 02:56:41.679]  I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:45.762]  Ted, watching this situation, it's bittersweet.
[02:56:46.182 --> 02:56:51.026]  Yeah, we're right again, but it's because the Federal Reserve is buying U.S.
[02:56:51.066 --> 02:56:52.907]  debt instead of foreign governments or individuals.
[02:56:53.407 --> 02:56:58.531]  I mean, more and more, they're signaling that it is the long march into depression.
[02:56:59.249 --> 02:57:06.195]  Yeah, you're right about that, and that's why you're seeing so many institutional buyers get into gold, and so many people walk away from the dollar.
[02:57:06.275 --> 02:57:14.123]  I mean, just about every newsletter service, even places like Bloomberg and Reuters are saying, buy gold.
[02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:15.164]  You have to buy gold.
[02:57:15.584 --> 02:57:17.506]  It's not like they're even leaving an option for it.
[02:57:17.986 --> 02:57:20.148]  And Alex, today we've seen a high of $1,297.20.
[02:57:22.671 --> 02:57:23.392]  And a low of $1,286.
[02:57:23.652 --> 02:57:25.334]  You know what that means?
[02:57:25.675 --> 02:57:29.260]  It means we could see $1,300 an ounce before the end of this week.
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:35.729]  I'm going to emphasize could, but we're so close to it, Alex, that it would only take a $5 uptick and we're over $1,300 an ounce in gold.
[02:57:38.973 --> 02:57:40.354]  Well, Ted, you've got silver.
[02:57:40.815 --> 02:57:42.836]  The silver half dollars at $10.50 apiece.
[02:57:42.956 --> 02:57:44.277]  Nobody's got them anywhere near that.
[02:57:44.297 --> 02:57:46.319]  You've got gold that you bought in the last few weeks.
[02:57:46.859 --> 02:57:50.182]  When it was much lower, you can pass on those savings, but it's the radio special.
[02:57:50.582 --> 02:57:51.643]  People need to call 800-686-2237.
[02:57:51.663 --> 02:57:52.084]  800-686-2237.
[02:57:52.204 --> 02:57:56.627]  Throw out some of the special coin offers you've got, what you've got in stock at the low price.
[02:58:01.371 --> 02:58:04.893]  Well again, one of the great buys right now is the Walking Liberty Half.
[02:58:05.273 --> 02:58:06.974]  It's currently trading at $10.50.
[02:58:08.255 --> 02:58:09.596]  We have the Frank right now.
[02:58:09.636 --> 02:58:11.937]  That coin is discounted even at $2.79.
[02:58:12.457 --> 02:58:13.017]  $2.80 is now.
[02:58:13.057 --> 02:58:15.839]  You get a full year subscription of the International Forecaster.
[02:58:16.219 --> 02:58:17.220]  All you gotta do is call that 800-686-2237.
[02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:18.460]  Take advantage of the specials.
[02:58:18.541 --> 02:58:19.601]  It's a good time to do it.
[02:58:23.263 --> 02:58:23.864]  Absolutely.
[02:58:23.884 --> 02:58:24.064]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:24.084 --> 02:58:32.329]  When we come back, I'll tell you about my run-in with a modern-day Papa Smurf Yosemite Sam.
[02:58:32.729 --> 02:58:33.550]  It was interesting.
[02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:35.451]  I just want to say great job to the crew.
[02:58:35.491 --> 02:58:36.872]  Big guest coming up tomorrow, by the way.
[02:58:39.153 --> 02:58:40.914]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:42.415 --> 02:58:43.696]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:47.372 --> 02:58:48.574]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:48.614 --> 02:58:51.779]  Remember when I said you spell freedom F-O-O-D?
[02:58:51.959 --> 02:58:52.640]  It's really true.
[02:58:52.941 --> 02:58:55.725]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growth.
