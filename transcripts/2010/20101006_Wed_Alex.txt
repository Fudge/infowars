[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.757]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:11.339]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.261]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:17.085]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:53.054]  I'm going to attempt to be calm, to be focused, to be cogent, and to walk through all of the news that we have before us here today.
[00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:54.895]  But when I got up at about 6 a.m.
[00:00:54.895 --> 00:01:01.639]  this morning and went to PrisonPlanet.com, because it is updated first every day,
[00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:11.601]  I saw a video by the International Center for 9-11 Studies.
[00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:28.156]  They, of course, were involved suing NIST with others, the federal government agency, to get videos released, thousands of them, of the firefighters and police during the 9-11 attacks.
[00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:37.896]  Because the New York Fire Department and Police Department have, in all of their units, camera people.
[00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:42.140]  In the last decade plus, now it's become more prolific.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.969]  Even small departments, you'll see it even roadside checkpoints or community events, you'll see police there with cameras documenting what's going on in case something happens.
[00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.232]  They've got a record of it, similar to squad car cameras.
[00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.473]  And that's the problem with Big Brother, it can backfire.
[00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:25.330]  I called Paul Watson this morning, and I asked him to do a special report on this that the skeleton of is going to be up in the next 10 minutes at InfoWars.com, but he's going to be adding to it throughout the day.
[00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.592]  And when you just see one more of these videos,
[00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:47.385]  Where firefighters are talking about, before the towers collapse, in one case, before the second plane had even hit the other tower, saying that there were explosions going off in the lobby.
[00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:51.309]  In the lobby of one of the towers.
[00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:52.450]  The first tower to be hit.
[00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.741]  This is, this is, you know, a long time before the building collapses.
[00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:07.204]  And we go back to William Rodriguez, the hero, who went around opening doors and saving people and helping people and barely got out.
[00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:09.745]  I mean, he got out as the building collapsed.
[00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:11.946]  And he came out that day to local news.
[00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:12.766]  They said, what did you see?
[00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:14.267]  And they said, explosions, bombs.
[00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:19.773]  And we have firefighter tapes and police tapes where they say bombs are going off.
[00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:27.337]  And on this latest video, it's several firefighters sitting there, bleeding, dust all over them.
[00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:30.058]  The only thing we've cut is the cussing.
[00:03:30.058 --> 00:03:32.760]  You can't blame them after going through something like this.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.441]  And they're saying, you know, we got to get out of here.
[00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:35.521]  There could be more bombs.
[00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:36.742]  They could go off any time.
[00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:39.939]  There's bombs in these buildings.
[00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.500]  These are trained professionals.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:52.445]  And then the media tried to spin it and said, oh, you know, when Willie Rodriguez and police and firemen, you know, later talked about this, but also in the past videos that were shot live that day.
[00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:57.707]  And they said, well, gas fuel went down the elevators to the, to the lobby.
[00:03:57.707 --> 00:03:59.328]  Well, the, well, the elevators are staggered.
[00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:03.823]  There are many, many floors.
[00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:06.084]  Memory says over 30 floors up.
[00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:09.464]  You go up elevators, have to get off, and then the elevators are staggered.
[00:04:09.464 --> 00:04:11.825]  They're not continual.
[00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:15.425]  There were no fires lower down in the floors.
[00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:22.127]  There were no natural explosions caused by a generator blowing up or whatever.
[00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:30.488]  They're down there in the building, and one of the major towers, and there's bombs going off everywhere.
[00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:44.916]  And then you just come to the realization, even though we have all this evidence of 9-11 being an inside job and the official story being a fraud, but just when you see another video like this, it really hits home just how right we've been.
[00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.838]  And I have a sick feeling.
[00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:48.659]  I'm not happy that I'm right about this.
[00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.581]  I wish it was men in caves.
[00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:57.348]  That's a lot less scary than the criminals that run our government, that run our police, being the terrorist.
[00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.872]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:52.776]  Thank you!
[00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:04.401]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.322]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:08.745]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:09.605]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:14.489]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:15.229]  It's true.
[00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.113]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:20.934]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:24.516]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:28.219]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.220]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.982]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:35.666]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:36.447]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.447 --> 00:06:40.610]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.375]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:49.818]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.818 --> 00:06:51.599]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.860]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.481]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:56.481 --> 00:07:00.384]  Listen up, friends.
[00:07:00.384 --> 00:07:02.725]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:06.527]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:09.149]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.770]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.531]  They're the best company out there.
[00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:20.711]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:23.052]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:26.373]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:28.353]  Try their new Evacuation Pack.
[00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:30.914]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:07:30.914 --> 00:07:33.034]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:41.620]  With open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.982]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:43.982 --> 00:07:51.828]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:51.828 --> 00:07:56.872]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:08.243]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:17.065]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.065 --> 00:08:21.306]  It is Wednesday, the 6th day of October 2010.
[00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:27.968]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, G. Edward Griffin, on his new documentary dealing with
[00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:29.609]  I think?
[00:08:55.208 --> 00:09:15.668]  At the bottom of the hour, when Watson's report is posted at PrisonPlanet.com, I'm going to go into this in full and play the different video clips and audio clips for radio and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers so we have a clear, concise report on this, but I got sick to my stomach.
[00:09:15.668 --> 00:09:17.269]  I mean, physically got nauseated.
[00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:18.391]  This happens occasionally.
[00:09:19.537 --> 00:09:29.025]  When everything we've documented, everything we've researched just gets more added to it that further confirms what we're talking about.
[00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:33.709]  I wish every day that 9-11 was not an inside job.
[00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:35.491]  I wish it was a foreign enemy.
[00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:41.616]  I wish it was a few hundred ragtag men in caves that wore turbans on their heads.
[00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:43.898]  That is not scary.
[00:09:43.898 --> 00:09:44.899]  It's a little scary, but
[00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:55.032]  It's not one one millionth as scary as a giant military-industrial complex who on record has staged other terror attacks.
[00:09:55.032 --> 00:10:07.257]  Operation Gladio, hundreds of times in Europe, Operation Ajax, Gulf of Tonkin, Northwoods, Army field manuals training Black Op captains and above how to stage terror.
[00:10:07.257 --> 00:10:09.438]  That's two years old and admitted.
[00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:19.096]  Leaked by WikiLeaks, the Pentagon admits it's real and said they would arrest whoever had released it if they could find them.
[00:10:19.096 --> 00:10:24.341]  I wish every day that it was Men in Caves.
[00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:26.082]  But it's not, my friends.
[00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:33.088]  And when you really get into 9-11 truth, when you really research it, and government-sponsored terror and false flag events,
[00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:35.282]  It just never ends.
[00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:36.583]  There is so much evidence.
[00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:40.104]  The official story is such a ridiculous lie.
[00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:52.988]  I mean, there's simple things like within eight hours of the attacks, they had one of the unburned passports of one of the reported Saudi Arabian hijackers found at Ground Zero.
[00:10:52.988 --> 00:10:53.368]  There were
[00:10:54.608 --> 00:10:56.668]  Hundreds of millions of papers.
[00:10:56.668 --> 00:10:57.889]  Hundreds of millions.
[00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:01.689]  Thousands and thousands of offices with tens of thousands of papers.
[00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:03.750]  Mainly Wall Street firms.
[00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.891]  There were, you know, in some areas, 10, 15, 20 feet of papers on the ground.
[00:11:08.891 --> 00:11:12.951]  All over lower Manhattan, there were several inches of papers.
[00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:15.512]  Several feet of dust.
[00:11:15.512 --> 00:11:17.412]  Asbestos, the rest of it.
[00:11:17.412 --> 00:11:19.553]  And magically, the FBI
[00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:26.038]  Finds a passport and then finds another one.
[00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:29.420]  Two passports in one day.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:40.747]  You've got planes going 550 miles an hour, they fly into aluminum and steel structure buildings, there's a huge fireball, there's fires, and two passports fly out and go to the ground.
[00:11:40.747 --> 00:11:45.870]  That is one of thousands of smoking guns of 9-11.
[00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.792]  It's a fraud, it's a lie, it's a joke.
[00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:50.353]  Same thing at
[00:11:51.434 --> 00:11:55.919]  The airline that crashed in Pennsylvania.
[00:11:55.919 --> 00:12:00.944]  They magically found one of the passports there as well.
[00:12:00.944 --> 00:12:04.127]  This is a sick joke.
[00:12:04.127 --> 00:12:06.449]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:31.702]  You have Barry Jennings, the Deputy Head of Emergency Management in New York City, at Building 7 at the Command Center, and he comes out from the building, Building 7, in the morning, with dust all over him, with the Head of Emergency Management, and says that there were explosions before the building even caught on fire, hours before it even collapsed, Building 7, the 47-story building.
[00:12:31.702 --> 00:12:36.785]  Then we get an interview with him for a loose change final cut,
[00:12:38.942 --> 00:12:42.584]  And then suddenly he starts getting threatened and he says, please don't use it.
[00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:49.828]  And then he winds up dead within a few days.
[00:12:49.828 --> 00:12:52.709]  Neighbors, we've talked to neighbors.
[00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:57.772]  Neighbors say that he just, that the family just moved out in days, just disappeared.
[00:12:57.772 --> 00:12:59.513]  Probably a witness protection program.
[00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:02.454]  Who even knows if he's alive or dead.
[00:13:02.454 --> 00:13:04.996]  This has the classic MO of him being put under
[00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:09.747]  But, I mean, he may have died of a cancer that killed him in a week.
[00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:14.911]  I mean, one of those cancers that kills you like a cold in a couple days.
[00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:20.835]  Kind of like Jack Ruby, who took out the Patsy Oswald.
[00:13:20.835 --> 00:13:24.577]  And we're going to be playing all of that, but there's a new video up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:24.577 --> 00:13:28.700]  New video, 9-1-1 Fireman Secondary Explosion Testimony.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.883]  Newly released footage obtained from NIST by the International Center for 9-11 Studies.
[00:13:32.883 --> 00:13:33.864]  They had to sue to get these.
[00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:39.666]  Shows firefighters describing secondary explosions shortly before the collapse of the Twin Towers.
[00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:47.091]  And of course, a few weeks ago, they released video of explosions going off in Seven before the other towers had even collapsed.
[00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:50.674]  Nothing has hit it, no plane, no debris.
[00:13:50.674 --> 00:13:59.000]  Building Seven is literally, it's gotta be 300 yards away from even the North Tower.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.082]  And there's explosions going off.
[00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:11.720]  And then Jennings reports, the fire department comes in and gets them out and there's dead bodies all over the floor in the lobby.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.705]  First thing Black Ops does is detonate a bomb to cause confusion before they go in and burn the place down.
[00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:24.873]  The CIA was in the building, Defense Intelligence, FBI, all totaled more than 20 federal agencies, IRS, the list goes on and on.
[00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:34.799]  So we've got people, very credible witnesses, saying bombs going off in Building 7 before North and South Tower had fallen.
[00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:37.762]  Do you understand this?
[00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:49.873]  We have the police, we have the janitors, we have the firemen in many videos, but two local newscasts saying there were explosions going off before the buildings fell.
[00:14:51.294 --> 00:15:04.042]  Namely, the North Tower that Willie Rodriguez, the hero, was in, who went back in to unlock doors, and to get people out of stairwells, because the elevators were shut down, and they were trying to get through, and the elevator and stairwells are staggered.
[00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:06.403]  You know, they don't go straight up and down.
[00:15:06.403 --> 00:15:07.084]  There's different levels.
[00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:13.208]  You have to get off at certain elevators, get off at certain... Look at the blueprints online.
[00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.769]  Certain stairwells, you know, get off to get on other stairwells.
[00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:16.750]  It isn't straight up and down.
[00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:24.540]  And everything Rodriguez talked about and others talked about has been borne out to be true.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.362]  And now they've released a lot of the audio tapes.
[00:15:26.362 --> 00:15:31.509]  Just hundreds of firefighters and police talking about there's bombs going off.
[00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:33.672]  There's got to be bombs everywhere down here.
[00:15:33.672 --> 00:15:34.573]  This is incredible.
[00:15:35.413 --> 00:15:47.202]  So at the bottom of the hour, or a little bit after, I'm going to do the full report here, but I did want to play this video for Radio and PrisonPlanet.TV viewers right now, and this is unedited.
[00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:50.124]  This was shot by the New York Fire Department.
[00:15:50.124 --> 00:15:55.547]  The only thing that we bleeped out is the firefighters using the F word, and who can blame them?
[00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:57.049]  One of them is bleeding out of his nose.
[00:15:57.049 --> 00:15:58.390]  They've got cuts on them, dust.
[00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.371]  And we've got all these other tapes, too, of police saying, get back, they're bringing down 7.
[00:16:03.371 --> 00:16:05.172]  They're going to blow that building up.
[00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:08.113]  And then the news says building 7 has fallen.
[00:16:08.113 --> 00:16:09.253]  And it hadn't fallen.
[00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:11.213]  They were already putting the official story out.
[00:16:11.213 --> 00:16:12.154]  They full started.
[00:16:12.154 --> 00:16:14.434]  That's very common.
[00:16:14.434 --> 00:16:23.277]  Just like in Australia and New Zealand and several other countries, hours before Lee Harvey Oswald was captured or his name was released,
[00:16:24.246 --> 00:16:27.188]  They had already done off the wire.
[00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:32.051]  They hadn't happened in the US or Europe or England, but they got their time zones wrong.
[00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:37.255]  They'd already fed them Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:16:37.255 --> 00:16:38.616]  They'd already.
[00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:43.219]  So again, stunning evidence on that front.
[00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:48.162]  So the video is up on
[00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:56.040]  PrisonPlanet.com and Paul Watson's article just went live minutes ago.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.340]  Let's put that back up there.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.261]  Thank you.
[00:16:58.261 --> 00:16:59.201]  Video.
[00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:00.002]  This is the headline.
[00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:01.602]  This is the article to get out to everyone.
[00:17:01.602 --> 00:17:06.004]  And then below it, Watson all day is going to be adding more evidence because there's so much.
[00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:13.427]  It takes days just to get all the old articles we've written, all the old videos, all the hundreds of admissions, all saying the same thing.
[00:17:13.427 --> 00:17:16.108]  Firefighters, police, deputy head of emergency management.
[00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:21.434]  Medical workers, janitors, all the same thing.
[00:17:21.434 --> 00:17:24.376]  See, you can't pick and choose what you want to believe.
[00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.918]  I know it's frightening that the globalists did this.
[00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:30.821]  I know it's frightening they clearly used private contractors to set this up.
[00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:38.006]  I know it's scary to know we've got a government as bad as Hitler, who firebombed his own capital to bring in martial law.
[00:17:38.006 --> 00:17:42.409]  But now they admit homeland security is for you, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:45.832]  Well, you were sold on tyranny in the name of hatin' brown people that wear turbans.
[00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.970]  By the way, we're founded by the CIA, the Taliban, and Al Qaeda.
[00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.291]  That's on record.
[00:17:51.291 --> 00:18:06.908]  While all that was happening, Sybil Edmonds, the high-level FBI, NSA liaison interpreter, has now broken her gag order earlier this year.
[00:18:06.908 --> 00:18:08.790]  She testified before the 9-11 Commission.
[00:18:10.148 --> 00:18:32.030]  And she said, look, the information I told the commission, the information that they gagged me from telling anybody, is that I was listening to conversations with the commanders of Al-Qaeda working for the CIA in narcotics trafficking, weapons trafficking, human trafficking, and terror, and that they were about to launch a major operation under CIA command.
[00:18:38.746 --> 00:18:39.806]  Do you understand?
[00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:41.167]  This is on record.
[00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:45.668]  And as we told you years ago with Abel Danger, we've had Anthony Schaeffer on, Tony Schaeffer.
[00:18:45.668 --> 00:18:47.208]  It's now Fox News exclusive.
[00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:49.909]  Yeah, they're going to tell us the sun comes up in the morning.
[00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:59.132]  Witnesses and Defense Department reports suggest cover-up of 9-11 findings, backing up what Tony Schaeffer, the colonel, said that there were contractors
[00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:11.596]  Over there, who knew all about Al-Qaeda, were clearly working in and around them, and that they tried to go in and take out these groups, and found out that this operation was about to be launched, and they were barred from stopping it.
[00:19:11.596 --> 00:19:14.337]  But that was only a sub cover story.
[00:19:14.337 --> 00:19:18.198]  We know Adda and the other hijackers, on record, worked at U.S.
[00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:27.921]  military bases and had security clearances, and I've had the head of the visa section of the Saudi Arabian Jeddah office, Mr. Springman, on nine years ago.
[00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:28.922]  We had him back on this year.
[00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:40.477]  Who talked to CIA people and others in the State Department and were told, yes, we gave, we ordered them to be given visas, ATTA and others, to come back in, even though they were on terror list, because it was a cover.
[00:19:40.477 --> 00:19:42.619]  They were CIA operatives.
[00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:48.444]  I mean, we've got this thing from A to Z. We know it's an inside job.
[00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:48.684]  Period.
[00:19:48.684 --> 00:19:49.725]  Period.
[00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:53.287]  We're gonna play this audio and video when we come back.
[00:19:53.287 --> 00:19:53.668]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.327 --> 00:20:01.687]  This may surprise you.
[00:20:01.687 --> 00:20:06.169]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.

[00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:27.241]  So this explosive article just went live at PrisonPlanet.com video 9-1-1 firefighters revealed huge explosions before towers collapse and that's in the bottom of the buildings and this just confirms everybody else and the local newscast and all the witnesses but then NIST and others
[00:24:28.317 --> 00:24:34.222]  And FEMA guarded the site, wouldn't let anybody get in to look at it, and now we know why.
[00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:37.544]  Because they were shooting their own video, and their own video shows what happened.
[00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:43.629]  The columns blasted off, controlled demolition, the whole nine yards.
[00:24:43.629 --> 00:24:49.533]  We're going to do a Google search term again today, another devastating blow against the globalists.
[00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:52.776]  The last search term we did was the number one and number two search terms.
[00:24:53.717 --> 00:24:55.799]  So you've been very, very successful at getting this out.
[00:24:55.799 --> 00:25:00.282]  Can you imagine when you Google the term over and over again, huge explosions?
[00:25:00.282 --> 00:25:16.295]  It's going to lead people directly to prisonplanet.com and this article full of video clip, after video clip, after video clip, after video clip, after video clip, after video clip, of police and firemen and the deputy head of emergency management.
[00:25:16.295 --> 00:25:22.760]  Bombs going off in all three buildings, including building seven, not even hit by a plane or debris, way down the road.
[00:25:24.608 --> 00:25:26.990]  No doubt they were running the attacks out of 7.
[00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:47.208]  That's why the mayor at the time, Giuliani, went on ABC News that morning and said, it's very strange, we're running a drill called Tripod 2 in the, he also told CBS News, in Building 7, but in the drill, Building 7 is under attack, so we were told days before by FEMA,
[00:25:48.612 --> 00:25:56.636]  And remember that deputy head of FEMA said, oh yes, we arrived in New York September 10th the night before, so we were able to respond quite well the next morning.
[00:25:56.636 --> 00:25:59.257]  Yeah, they had to be there to be involved in the cover-up.
[00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:08.361]  And then Giuliani is talking out of school and saying, yeah, we were running a drill that morning, so we'd moved everything to mobile command units out at the end of the pier.
[00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:10.562]  Well, yeah, you've got to manage your staged attack, don't you?
[00:26:12.802 --> 00:26:18.604]  And see, most people in the fire department, police department, in the emergency management, they're not involved.
[00:26:18.604 --> 00:26:19.545]  This is all a drill.
[00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:21.205]  They're waiting for an attack on the buildings.
[00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:21.525]  Boom!
[00:26:21.525 --> 00:26:22.466]  It happens.
[00:26:22.466 --> 00:26:23.806]  And they're in control of it.
[00:26:23.806 --> 00:26:28.608]  And their command center, the county and city and state command center, were all in building 7.
[00:26:28.608 --> 00:26:31.029]  They all had their command trucks moved.
[00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:34.390]  But Barry Jennings, he was still in the building.
[00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.211]  And they get word that
[00:26:36.209 --> 00:26:42.112]  The first tower's been hit, and within minutes, boom, boom, boom, lights go out.
[00:26:42.112 --> 00:26:44.313]  He's going through the building, trying to get out.
[00:26:44.313 --> 00:26:47.094]  Goes down the stairwell.
[00:26:47.094 --> 00:26:47.995]  Gets down to the bottom.
[00:26:47.995 --> 00:26:49.815]  There's dead bodies everywhere.
[00:26:49.815 --> 00:26:53.537]  Nothing's hit seven.
[00:26:53.537 --> 00:26:54.898]  Meanwhile, Willie Rodriguez...
[00:26:56.172 --> 00:26:57.933]  He's in the North Tower.
[00:26:57.933 --> 00:26:59.173]  He's one of the head janitors.
[00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:00.313]  He's got the master key.
[00:27:00.313 --> 00:27:01.774]  He's going in to get people out.
[00:27:01.774 --> 00:27:03.595]  The lobby's blowing up.
[00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:08.156]  Firefighters, citizens are going around with their faces blown off.
[00:27:08.156 --> 00:27:09.857]  He described it like a horror movie.
[00:27:09.857 --> 00:27:10.797]  Just blood.
[00:27:10.797 --> 00:27:12.678]  Their skin completely burned off.
[00:27:12.678 --> 00:27:14.178]  People on fire.
[00:27:14.178 --> 00:27:14.778]  Ah!
[00:27:14.778 --> 00:27:16.959]  Bombs going off all over the place.
[00:27:16.959 --> 00:27:18.720]  Collapsing lobby.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.821]  The elevators are 30 floors up.
[00:27:21.821 --> 00:27:23.021]  They stop and stagger.
[00:27:23.021 --> 00:27:25.002]  It wasn't jet fuel coming down.
[00:27:29.343 --> 00:27:33.164]  There was only fires for a few floors under the impact points.
[00:27:33.164 --> 00:27:34.804]  Most of the fuel dissipated.
[00:27:34.804 --> 00:27:36.604]  We have the firefighter tapes with the reporting.
[00:27:36.604 --> 00:27:39.005]  We've knocked out almost all the fires in both towers.
[00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:43.846]  There's people standing in the holes in the buildings, waving their shirts.
[00:27:43.846 --> 00:27:45.446]  Remember the woman, the man?
[00:27:45.446 --> 00:27:46.986]  Help me, helicopters!
[00:27:46.986 --> 00:27:47.786]  Help me!
[00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:50.067]  Help me!
[00:27:50.067 --> 00:27:53.088]  Like something out of the movie King Kong.
[00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:55.528]  You know, where she's up on top of the Empire States Building.
[00:27:56.912 --> 00:28:12.797]  And then seconds later, giant four-foot-round beams are shattered and ejected 600 to 800 feet, and the building is demolished into tiny pieces.
[00:28:12.797 --> 00:28:15.218]  And we have photos from the day of the rubble.
[00:28:15.218 --> 00:28:17.418]  The big major beams sliced off at an angle.
[00:28:17.418 --> 00:28:21.960]  You don't slice them straight across, because the beams, because of their pressure, can still stand.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.461]  You slice them at an angle, so they slide off.
[00:28:26.468 --> 00:28:28.410]  Like a hot knife through caramel.
[00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:37.581]  Now when we come back, we're going to play this new tape.
[00:28:37.581 --> 00:28:43.128]  This is shot by the fire department and seized by NIST.
[00:28:43.128 --> 00:28:46.612]  Thousands of these videos that they've refused to release have been ordered released.
[00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:51.547]  I mean, I've become so desensitized to this.
[00:28:51.547 --> 00:28:56.491]  Two weeks ago, the same group that sued the International Center for 9-11 Studies, that's a group to support.
[00:28:56.491 --> 00:28:57.212]  They're the real deal.
[00:28:57.212 --> 00:29:01.156]  Everybody needs to really... I'm gonna get them on.
[00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:05.119]  They released another video where there's bombs going off in Building 7.
[00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:12.186]  Well, we already knew that, but we already had the Deputy Head of Emergency Management telling us that, and others.
[00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:14.328]  This is going on at, you know, 9 o'clock in the morning.
[00:29:18.348 --> 00:29:25.811]  Eight hours later, at 525 Building 7, 47 stories, collapses into its own footprint.
[00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:36.135]  And 25 minutes before, they're on two different live feeds, BBC World, BBC 24, saying the exact same words about how it fell in its own footprint from fires.
[00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:40.056]  And I knew right then, I said, that's some secret news wire they were giving, because they're both saying the same thing live.
[00:29:40.056 --> 00:29:41.737]  Then seeing it ended the same thing,
[00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:45.261]  And I said, probably an internal Reuters.
[00:29:45.261 --> 00:29:50.590]  And then, years later, they admitted, okay, Reuters gave us a report it was wrong.
[00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.992]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.992 --> 00:29:54.516]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.516 --> 00:29:57.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.285 --> 00:30:02.786]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:02.786 --> 00:30:08.129]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.398 --> 00:30:30.380]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.541]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:38.842]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.842 --> 00:30:44.784]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.784 --> 00:30:48.345]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:50.306]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:50.746]  It's here.

[00:31:01.032 --> 00:31:16.501]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:20.183]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:33.967]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:33.967 --> 00:31:41.233]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:41.914 --> 00:31:52.280]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.202]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:56.202 --> 00:31:59.324]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:32:01.283 --> 00:32:05.304]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.304 --> 00:32:08.545]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.545 --> 00:32:13.346]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:13.346 --> 00:32:19.728]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.728 --> 00:32:21.969]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.969]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.969 --> 00:32:23.310]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.990]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.091]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:27.513]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.403 --> 00:32:48.692]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.692 --> 00:32:57.804]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:17.214 --> 00:33:27.803]  There's a reason I'm one of the most attacked and demonized people by government, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, internet trolls, COINTELPRO.
[00:33:27.803 --> 00:33:34.208]  It's because I've committed my life, my name, my treasure, my wife, my children, to extreme danger.
[00:33:36.095 --> 00:33:38.738]  And the system doesn't know what to do with somebody like Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.738 --> 00:33:52.192]  So I do need your prayers, ladies and gentlemen, because the attacks are intensifying, because we understand the enemy's operations, and we are having a huge effect reaching millions and millions of new people, and that's what scares the system.
[00:33:52.192 --> 00:33:54.455]  We're not just preaching to the choir every week.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.201]  And the crew has done a great job.
[00:33:58.201 --> 00:34:05.683]  You know, I saw this video about 6 30 in the morning, did research, then decided about 10 to pull all the old clips along with this new clip.
[00:34:05.683 --> 00:34:16.626]  And the problem is so many of these clips have profanity in them with police, firefighters and others who just lost friends and themselves are injured, talking like sailors that, you know, just got home for leave.
[00:34:17.926 --> 00:34:22.269]  Uh, and we've been trying to review all these videos, and then most of them have cussing.
[00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:30.333]  Then we have to go find versions that we previously played years ago on our computer, uh, to be able to play the ones that don't have, uh, the cussing.
[00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:31.614]  But here's the new video!
[00:34:33.547 --> 00:34:35.868]  And again, the search term today is huge explosions.
[00:34:35.868 --> 00:34:40.510]  That will lead people to this Paul Joseph Watson article that details this whole history.
[00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.992]  This is just one aspect of the inside job.
[00:34:42.992 --> 00:34:46.794]  That there were bombs in all those buildings, they blew them sky high.
[00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:48.134]  Then you get into all the other areas.
[00:34:48.134 --> 00:34:50.916]  It's just every area you look at, it's unending.
[00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:53.157]  Okay, I'm sorry it's an inside job.
[00:34:54.105 --> 00:35:04.652]  Okay, I wish our country wasn't run by complete psychopathic murderers who will shoot up Guatemalan children and black people in this country with syphilis and watch them die.
[00:35:04.652 --> 00:35:11.876]  I wish they didn't take 4,000 plus foster children declassified and radiate them to death in the US.
[00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:18.961]  I wish they weren't putting sodium fluoride in the water to give you cancer and give me cancer and attack your genitals and reduce your fertility.
[00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:27.079]  I wish that every major GMO crop in every major study didn't cause organ failure in every mammal species.
[00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:27.439]  Okay?
[00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:32.624]  I wish the globalists weren't out in the open saying they want to set up a world government and kill us.
[00:35:32.624 --> 00:35:34.306]  They're not just going to bankrupt the country.
[00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:35.828]  They're not just going to lower your standard of living.
[00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:39.808]  They're going to intensify the amount of soft kills they're putting out there.
[00:35:39.808 --> 00:35:43.929]  And don't you get it, FBI agents and defense intelligence people?
[00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:53.052]  I know most of you know the truth and are supportive, but those of you that work on the dark side of this, don't you get it that you are going to be destroyed by this?
[00:35:53.052 --> 00:36:00.794]  Even if you like power and dark evil and being part of this, don't you understand you're going to be annihilated as well?
[00:36:00.794 --> 00:36:06.336]  I mean, I pray, I pray that this doesn't have to continue.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.125]  The government's been hyping nukes going off in the country.
[00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:27.584]  If you think they got a police state going into high gear, staging 3,000 deaths at 9-11, that PNAC said a year before on September 20, 2000, barring a Pearl Harbor event on the mainland of the U.S., we won't be able to launch these wars against Iraq and Afghanistan and Iran.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:43.265]  If they'll do something like that, ladies and gentlemen, they'll do anything, and they're destroying our entire civilization, our entire society is under attack by this.
[00:36:43.265 --> 00:36:44.785]  So let's go ahead and start getting to the clips.
[00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:50.047]  Here is the new clips of bleeding and injured firefighters.
[00:36:50.047 --> 00:36:53.689]  And one of them looks up and he goes, there could be bombs in all these buildings.
[00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:54.569]  We gotta get out of here.
[00:36:55.543 --> 00:36:58.264]  Here's the new clip that NIST didn't want you to see.
[00:36:58.264 --> 00:37:05.668]  And there's literally thousands of these videos that the International Center for 9-11 Studies and others sued and got.
[00:37:05.668 --> 00:37:10.150]  The one two weeks ago is bombs going off in Building 7 at 9-something in the morning.
[00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.350]  Just what Jennings said!
[00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:18.653]  And you're like, well, why would they have planes crashing and bombs going off?
[00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:19.634]  That's a black op.
[00:37:21.476 --> 00:37:25.580]  You know, I've read about Operation Ajax in 1953 when they were taking over Iran.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:38.351]  The CIA, this is declassified, led by Kermit Roosevelt and MI6 commanders, blew up mosques, machine gun crowds, attacked police stations, did random things like, you know, set fires at a horse stall.
[00:37:38.351 --> 00:37:39.793]  People are like, well, why do that?
[00:37:39.793 --> 00:37:40.854]  Just, just confusion!
[00:37:42.125 --> 00:37:45.529]  They'd randomly shoot people in the street.
[00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:46.910]  Confusion!
[00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:47.832]  Confusion!
[00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:49.714]  And then they blamed it on Mohammed Mosaddegh.
[00:37:49.714 --> 00:37:53.098]  Handed out handbills saying he had done it.
[00:37:53.098 --> 00:37:59.345]  And then they used Muslim extremists to overthrow him, then put the Shah in, who then suppressed the Muslim extremists who brought him to power.
[00:38:02.366 --> 00:38:06.308]  You know, Hitler took over a lot of the Middle East covertly, and then North Africa physically.
[00:38:06.308 --> 00:38:27.819]  He went in, in the years before he launched his wars, and made deals with the Arab League and others, and all the CIA had to do at the end of World War II was step right in, OSS, MI6, then CIA in 1947, was step in right where Hitler had been with those networks, and promised the Muslim extremists, go overthrow this secular government.
[00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.861]  And we'll put you in power, and they double-cross them.
[00:38:30.861 --> 00:38:34.943]  The radical Muslims work for the globalists.
[00:38:34.943 --> 00:38:38.745]  Look at Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the supposed 19 came from.
[00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:47.691]  There's another Saudi prince, you know, top relative of the king, you know, raping and biting somebody to death in a hotel room, and he may not even get in trouble.
[00:38:47.691 --> 00:38:50.333]  That's in mainstream news today.
[00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:52.154]  Are we ever told Saudi Arabia's bad?
[00:38:52.154 --> 00:38:53.695]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:53.695 --> 00:38:56.917]  Any secular government that doesn't put women in burqas
[00:38:57.978 --> 00:39:06.122]  Any secular government that has 60% of their college graduates, including doctors, being women like Iraq, they're going to be set up, demonized and destroyed.
[00:39:06.122 --> 00:39:07.542]  Does it mean Saddam was perfect?
[00:39:07.542 --> 00:39:08.162]  No!
[00:39:08.162 --> 00:39:10.403]  But he's a lot better than Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:10.403 --> 00:39:14.725]  He was our stinking ally until the globalists set him up and told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:39:14.725 --> 00:39:20.188]  April Gillespie, it's on video.
[00:39:20.188 --> 00:39:25.010]  They gave him 30 plus billion to attack Iran eight years before and it was the same teletype, same message.
[00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:28.042]  Do you want me to attack Iran?
[00:39:28.042 --> 00:39:32.045]  They said, we're not going to get involved in their Arab affairs.
[00:39:32.045 --> 00:39:34.167]  He said, yes, sir, and launched the attack.
[00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:39.451]  He was put in power by black ops, by the people that run this government.
[00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:41.793]  Our government has been seized by foreign banks.
[00:39:41.793 --> 00:39:43.434]  We don't have a government anymore.
[00:39:43.434 --> 00:39:46.697]  We don't have a country and no one's safe from these people.
[00:39:46.697 --> 00:39:53.122]  The sky is the limit with their hubris and their imperial arrogance and the chutzpah, the bravado.
[00:39:55.114 --> 00:39:58.115]  The machismo, whatever you want to call it, okay?
[00:39:58.115 --> 00:39:59.236]  The globalists got it.
[00:39:59.236 --> 00:40:00.196]  They're bold.
[00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:02.557]  They're in charge because they are bold.
[00:40:02.557 --> 00:40:07.879]  They will blow up three buildings in front of you and tell you men in caves did it.
[00:40:07.879 --> 00:40:21.345]  They will order NORAD to stand down in front of you and even when Norman Panetta comes out, the head of the Transportation Department, in the bunker with Cheney and watches Cheney order the stand down of the Pentagon defenses,
[00:40:22.247 --> 00:40:26.950]  When the plane's 60 miles out, 45 miles out, 10 miles out.
[00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.411]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:40:28.411 --> 00:40:30.313]  People say, well, something this big, it would come out.
[00:40:30.313 --> 00:40:31.354]  It did come out!
[00:40:31.354 --> 00:40:43.763]  I've interviewed the police, the firemen, who saw the countdown to blow up Building 7 years before somebody at CNN leaked, because people hadn't captured or forgotten about it, live CNN saying, get back.
[00:40:44.403 --> 00:40:46.405]  They're going to blow up Building 7.
[00:40:46.405 --> 00:40:47.125]  It's coming down.
[00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:48.366]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:40:48.366 --> 00:40:54.451]  Exactly what Craig Bartmer and other police officers told me to my face.
[00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:58.174]  Literally shaking in New York, looking over their shoulder.
[00:40:58.174 --> 00:41:00.296]  You think they like this stuff?
[00:41:00.296 --> 00:41:04.739]  But see, there's the big lie offered.
[00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:06.600]  Don't believe in 9-11 truth.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.902]  It's communists that believe it.
[00:41:07.902 --> 00:41:10.443]  You know, out of the full spectrum of top
[00:41:11.314 --> 00:41:23.321]  Japanese officials, former German defense head, former head of German intelligence, former head of Italian intelligence, former Italian president coming out saying 9-11's an inside job.
[00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:26.122]  I mean, do they talk about any of them on the news?
[00:41:26.122 --> 00:41:37.008]  No, they'll go pick some guy like Van Jones who signed a petition for a new investigation and then decried 9-11 truth and say, see, if you were for 9-11 truth, you're a communist.
[00:41:37.008 --> 00:41:38.409]  The system is hoping
[00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.554]  And putting all their money on the fact that you'll just get scared of talking about 9-11 truth.
[00:41:44.554 --> 00:41:53.041]  They're hoping with every ounce of energy that they've got, that you won't look at the evidence, or if you learn the evidence, you'll just shut up so they can stage more terror attacks.
[00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:53.962]  That's their agenda.
[00:41:53.962 --> 00:42:01.568]  And take our freedoms, and take our rights, and put this high-tech electronic jackboot straitjacket over our society.
[00:42:01.568 --> 00:42:02.309]  That's what's happening.
[00:42:04.918 --> 00:42:09.301]  So, 9-11 being an inside job is hidden in plain view.
[00:42:09.301 --> 00:42:13.764]  And they hope you're delusional and weak-minded and that choose to not look at the evidence.
[00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.165]  Choose to not believe it.
[00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:18.447]  You can't choose what reality is.
[00:42:18.447 --> 00:42:21.589]  If you stick your finger in a light socket, you're going to get shocked.
[00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:24.831]  If you jump in boiling water, you're going to get burned.
[00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:27.973]  If you pour gasoline on yourself and light yourself on fire, you're going to get burned.
[00:42:27.973 --> 00:42:32.856]  If you let foreign banks come in and issue tens of trillions of fiat currency and buy up the planet,
[00:42:33.814 --> 00:42:35.234]  You're going to be enslaved.
[00:42:35.234 --> 00:42:37.615]  It's all happening.
[00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:38.095]  Okay?
[00:42:38.095 --> 00:42:42.537]  I wish it wasn't an inside job, but the truth is the truth is the truth.
[00:42:42.537 --> 00:42:42.917]  Okay?
[00:42:42.917 --> 00:42:43.557]  It is.
[00:42:43.557 --> 00:42:46.158]  Now, here are the firefighters.
[00:42:46.158 --> 00:42:49.339]  Here's the latest clip that NIST had been suppressing.
[00:42:49.339 --> 00:42:50.939]  There's now hundreds of these coming out.
[00:42:50.939 --> 00:42:53.480]  Thousands of videos total.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:43:00.722]  Each one more bombshell than the last, confirming what all the other videos and testimony and radio chatter said.
[00:43:00.722 --> 00:43:02.823]  There were bombs going off in those buildings.
[00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:13.273]  From the minute the planes hit and during the entire time in the lower floors below the basement, they were blowing the main supports.
[00:43:13.273 --> 00:43:15.834]  They were doing it in rolling explosions.
[00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:17.654]  Let's go to the tape.
[00:43:17.654 --> 00:43:18.935]  What happened?
[00:43:18.935 --> 00:43:20.015]  It was an explosion.
[00:43:21.209 --> 00:43:25.232]  He's in the lobby, and the third explosion, the whole lobby collapsed on us.
[00:43:25.232 --> 00:43:26.013]  What was it like?
[00:43:26.013 --> 00:43:27.834]  What was it like?
[00:43:27.834 --> 00:43:28.174]  Horrible.
[00:43:28.174 --> 00:43:29.115]  It's like hell.
[00:43:29.115 --> 00:43:30.056]  You don't want to know.
[00:43:30.056 --> 00:43:32.598]  The whole building just collapsed on us, inside the lobby.
[00:43:32.598 --> 00:43:34.239]  Was that a secondary explosion?
[00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:34.920]  Yes, it was.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.980]  That was the final problem?
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.522]  Yeah, definitely a secondary explosion.
[00:43:37.522 --> 00:43:42.525]  We was inside waiting to go upstairs, and on the way upstairs, the whole thing blew.
[00:43:42.525 --> 00:43:44.287]  We just collapsed on everybody inside the lobby.
[00:43:44.287 --> 00:43:46.509]  Similar to the first tower coming down, secondary?
[00:43:46.509 --> 00:43:49.171]  I don't know about the first one, but I know the second one, it was terrible.
[00:43:49.171 --> 00:43:50.812]  Then there was a third one, too, after that one.
[00:43:52.503 --> 00:43:53.944]  That's right.
[00:43:53.944 --> 00:43:58.248]  Everybody was inside the building, waiting to go upstairs, and they just let loose.
[00:43:58.248 --> 00:44:00.570]  Everything just let loose inside the building.
[00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:05.134]  So, what you're telling me is that there was a plane or whatever hit the building and a secondary explosion?
[00:44:05.134 --> 00:44:06.855]  It was like three explosions after that.
[00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:08.396]  We came in after the fire.
[00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:10.838]  We came when the fire was going on already.
[00:44:10.838 --> 00:44:14.742]  We was in the staging area inside the building, waiting to go upstairs.
[00:44:14.742 --> 00:44:16.203]  And then it exploded.
[00:44:16.203 --> 00:44:18.765]  The whole lobby collapsed on the lobby inside.
[00:44:18.765 --> 00:44:20.987]  And it was this mayhem after that?
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.141]  You know, just may everybody try to work their way out.
[00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:25.901]  Just trying to help all the brothers get out.
[00:44:25.901 --> 00:44:28.342]  A lot of people, a lot of people trapped inside.
[00:44:28.342 --> 00:44:31.662]  We're sitting in the Brooklyn Navy Yard across from Brooklyn.
[00:44:31.662 --> 00:44:33.023]  We watched the first explosion.
[00:44:33.023 --> 00:44:38.304]  As we're watching the buildings, we saw a black, very large airplane fly right into the second building.
[00:44:38.304 --> 00:44:39.784]  It came out of the south.
[00:44:39.784 --> 00:44:42.485]  Right, right in front of our eyes.
[00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:44.365]  Just... It was so surreal, like a movie set.
[00:44:49.028 --> 00:44:51.509]  That is three firefighters, one of them senior.
[00:45:13.547 --> 00:45:19.129]  Who went into the North Tower exactly as Willie Rodriguez, the hero, said, and many others.
[00:45:19.129 --> 00:45:21.930]  Let me tell you, I've been with these firefighters.
[00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:27.712]  I've been with these police at bars and hotels when we've met with them, and they are shaking.
[00:45:27.712 --> 00:45:29.372]  They are looking over their shoulder.
[00:45:29.372 --> 00:45:32.454]  They tell me how they've been threatened.
[00:45:32.454 --> 00:45:36.975]  This is like living in an action-adventure movie, but this is real.
[00:45:42.998 --> 00:45:46.000]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.723]  And... You notice... See, you can't have firefighters getting there too early.
[00:45:52.723 --> 00:45:55.704]  You can't have firefighters noticing bombs that are in the building.
[00:45:55.704 --> 00:45:59.747]  So, you have it pre-planned when the main group gets in to get ready to go upstairs.
[00:45:59.747 --> 00:46:02.448]  This is before firefighters started going up.
[00:46:02.448 --> 00:46:04.189]  This is, you know, 15 minutes or so into it.
[00:46:04.189 --> 00:46:06.810]  It's what Willie Rodriguez says, and that's exactly what they're saying.
[00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.172]  They go in, they're staging, and the lobby just starts blowing up.
[00:46:14.488 --> 00:46:20.410]  And the same thing happens in the other tower, and the same thing happens at 7.
[00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.191]  But 7's not hit by a plane, and the same thing happens.
[00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:28.492]  Because you can't have the police and fire people that aren't part of the attack going in and seeing what's happening.
[00:46:28.492 --> 00:46:37.735]  And then Rodriguez, while this is going on, he'd be, you know, opening closets and opening doors, you know, in the smoke, and he'd open it and there'd be dead bodies, people who'd been killed, shoved in them.
[00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:45.317]  They were busy killing members of the teams that had been there that day who they didn't want to know what was going on.
[00:46:45.317 --> 00:46:46.157]  That's always what happens.
[00:46:46.157 --> 00:46:48.918]  You kill a lot of the assassins.
[00:46:48.918 --> 00:47:01.581]  Remember the former deputy head of the FBI, Mr. O'Neill, who had been fired from the FBI and told British newspaper The Telegraph, quote, they're going to let al Qaeda attack to get a police state in America and attack Afghanistan.
[00:47:01.581 --> 00:47:06.782]  He was then hired as the new head of security and his first day at work was September 11th and he died in the towers.
[00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:15.495]  Now here's Barry Jennings down the street after he gets out of Building 7.
[00:47:15.495 --> 00:47:16.857]  Hours and hours.
[00:47:16.857 --> 00:47:17.437]  Let me see.
[00:47:17.437 --> 00:47:18.698]  This is after 9 o'clock.
[00:47:18.698 --> 00:47:19.900]  It collapses at 5.30.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:25.966]  3 and 5 is 8.
[00:47:25.966 --> 00:47:30.991]  This is 8 hours plus before Building 7 falls.
[00:47:30.991 --> 00:47:34.174]  Here's Barry Jennings, the Deputy Head of Emergency Management.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.127]  Who didn't get the memo to be down with Giuliani at the new command center, because they pulled out of the building.
[00:47:41.127 --> 00:47:43.350]  Here he is, telling you what he saw.
[00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.071]  Here's Barry Jennings.
[00:47:45.424 --> 00:47:48.445]  From this space back, on Chambers, in that area.
[00:47:48.445 --> 00:47:50.505]  So now they're walking back toward the World Trade Center.
[00:47:50.505 --> 00:48:01.828]  And as we keep letting you hear the personal stories, the survivor stories, of exactly what happened inside the World Trade Center when that first plane went in, and of course the collapses since then, we're gonna bring more of those to you now.
[00:48:01.828 --> 00:48:05.369]  Barry Jennings, you're on the 8th floor, you work for the City Housing Department.
[00:48:05.369 --> 00:48:08.149]  Explain to me the moment of impact.
[00:48:08.149 --> 00:48:10.990]  Well, me and Mr. Hesch, the Corporation Council, were on the 23rd floor.
[00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.730]  I told them we gotta get out of here.
[00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.591]  We started walking down the stairs, we made it to the 8th floor.
[00:48:15.547 --> 00:48:16.728]  Big explosion.
[00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:18.931]  Blew us back into the 8th floor.
[00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:19.791]  And I turned to Hesh.
[00:48:19.791 --> 00:48:20.993]  I said, this is it.
[00:48:20.993 --> 00:48:21.573]  We're dead.
[00:48:21.573 --> 00:48:22.955]  We're not going to make it out of here.
[00:48:22.955 --> 00:48:26.258]  I took a fire extinguisher and I bust the window out.
[00:48:26.258 --> 00:48:29.421]  That's when this gentleman here heard my cries for help.
[00:48:29.421 --> 00:48:30.422]  This gentleman right here.
[00:48:30.422 --> 00:48:32.104]  And he kept saying, stand by.
[00:48:32.104 --> 00:48:33.005]  Somebody's coming to get you.
[00:48:33.005 --> 00:48:35.427]  They couldn't get to us for an hour because they couldn't find us.
[00:48:35.427 --> 00:48:36.308]  You thought that was it?
[00:48:36.308 --> 00:48:37.589]  I thought we were dead.
[00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:38.150]  I thought that was it.
[00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:40.591]  I started praying to Allah, so that's it.
[00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:41.212]  We're going.
[00:48:41.212 --> 00:48:41.752]  It's over.
[00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:42.833]  What was it like for you?
[00:48:42.833 --> 00:48:43.834]  You were inside there as well.
[00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:45.054]  It was pandemonium.
[00:48:45.054 --> 00:48:50.298]  I mean, it was something like out of a Bruce Willis' Die Hard movie.
[00:48:50.298 --> 00:48:54.561]  He was there, and he was crying, and there was another gentleman crying, and for help.
[00:48:54.561 --> 00:48:55.421]  We couldn't get to him.
[00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:58.083]  We tried to get through the... We went through the buildings.
[00:48:58.083 --> 00:48:59.344]  We were lost.
[00:48:59.344 --> 00:49:02.046]  Most aircases, the back side was completely blown away.
[00:49:02.046 --> 00:49:03.206]  There was no way to access it.
[00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.707]  We couldn't get to him.
[00:49:04.707 --> 00:49:08.050]  And finally, one of the fire department teams found him.
[00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:12.031]  But uh, we didn't think, we didn't think they were going to make it.
[00:49:12.031 --> 00:49:13.972]  Well certainly you got out, many others didn't.
[00:49:13.972 --> 00:49:16.873]  Of course we don't have a number right now of fatalities or injuries.
[00:49:16.873 --> 00:49:17.293]  Alright.
[00:49:17.293 --> 00:49:18.673]  But I want to translate a story to you.
[00:49:18.673 --> 00:49:22.055]  Now, that's building 7 before it collapsed.
[00:49:22.055 --> 00:49:25.516]  Now, that's in the morning.
[00:49:25.516 --> 00:49:32.078]  Now, they've now released NIST footage of Jennings and Hess, the head of emergency management, screaming for help, confirming the other witness.
[00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:38.783]  And they've released audio that you can hear on the video of explosions going on.
[00:49:38.783 --> 00:49:41.123]  I mean, nothing's hit 7.
[00:49:41.123 --> 00:49:43.184]  There's a few windows knocked out from some small debris.
[00:49:43.184 --> 00:49:44.324]  Suddenly, boom!
[00:49:44.324 --> 00:49:48.546]  Whole side of the building's blowing out.
[00:49:48.546 --> 00:49:51.267]  Then NIST gave six different reasons why 7 fell.
[00:49:51.267 --> 00:49:57.049]  Now they've had to retract all those and they don't say why it fell.
[00:49:57.049 --> 00:49:59.770]  Overbuilt to sustain a terror attack.
[00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.171]  Now when we come back, we're gonna play
[00:50:04.206 --> 00:50:08.867]  Fire Department described the bombs planted in the World Trade Center.
[00:50:08.867 --> 00:50:11.187]  It's as if they had detonators.
[00:50:11.187 --> 00:50:12.188]  Boom, boom, boom!
[00:50:12.188 --> 00:50:16.248]  The floor started popping out.
[00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:18.909]  It was like we were in a foundry, a volcano.
[00:50:18.909 --> 00:50:22.130]  There was molten steel everywhere.
[00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:24.070]  We don't know how you melt the steel.
[00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:25.870]  The jet fuel can't do it.
[00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.491]  It was like a foundry.
[00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:29.191]  It's called thermite.
[00:50:32.543 --> 00:50:33.824]  It's called thermite.
[00:50:33.824 --> 00:50:36.365]  Explosive thermite.
[00:50:36.365 --> 00:50:38.767]  It was just that they had detonators.
[00:50:38.767 --> 00:50:40.248]  What'd the other firefighter say?
[00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:42.850]  He wouldn't say anything while the others were telling the story and he goes, Look!
[00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.411]  We gotta get out of here!
[00:50:44.411 --> 00:50:45.351]  There's bombs!
[00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:45.912]  There's bombs!
[00:50:45.912 --> 00:50:47.573]  All these buildings could stop blowing!
[00:50:47.573 --> 00:50:49.334]  They have bombs in there!
[00:50:49.334 --> 00:50:50.715]  And we're told, No!
[00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:51.915]  No, you didn't see that!
[00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:55.157]  Sit down and breathe the asbestos and die, okay?
[00:50:55.157 --> 00:50:56.698]  That's how we're gonna take care of you.
[00:50:56.698 --> 00:50:57.299]  You got that?
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.780]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.281]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:08.181]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:15.382]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.382 --> 00:51:19.783]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:19.783 --> 00:51:30.045]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.285 --> 00:51:31.925]  Under any circumstance.

[00:51:39.148 --> 00:51:39.828]  But listen up.

[00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:53.652]  Right now.
[00:52:04.487 --> 00:52:05.748]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:05.748 --> 00:52:09.468]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.468 --> 00:52:11.909]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:11.909 --> 00:52:17.770]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:23.992]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.432 --> 00:52:30.414]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:34.595]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:34.595 --> 00:52:38.876]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:38.876 --> 00:52:44.818]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:44.818 --> 00:52:48.379]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.379 --> 00:52:50.360]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:50.800]  It's here.

[00:52:59.325 --> 00:53:02.708]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:02.708 --> 00:53:06.610]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:10.333]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:17.858]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:53:17.878 --> 00:53:18.178]  I think so.
[00:53:32.927 --> 00:53:33.267]  I think so.
[00:54:09.016 --> 00:54:23.389]  Again, we only play these clips, we played the new one today, a couple times a year, and it's in our computers, but I thought we had the one without the cussing, where they're talking about, you know, the bombs, the detonators.
[00:54:23.389 --> 00:54:29.294]  It'll take a little while, we've got the clip, they're having to put beeps over the firefighters, so that'll be in the next segment or the segment after that.
[00:54:30.075 --> 00:54:41.718]  Uh, but we do have one clip, uh, from New York TV when they were interviewing him that day, uh, where they're not cussing and they're talking about molten steel coming down the channel rails like it was a foundry.
[00:54:41.718 --> 00:54:43.319]  That's where they smelt metal.
[00:54:43.319 --> 00:54:45.559]  Uh, it's like lava.
[00:54:45.559 --> 00:54:47.380]  So here is that clip.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:54.382]  I think he just did it to, who knew?
[00:54:54.382 --> 00:54:57.923]  I, to be honest with you, I think he might've thought that was it for us though.
[00:54:59.091 --> 00:55:03.355]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel.
[00:55:03.355 --> 00:55:07.038]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[00:55:07.038 --> 00:55:09.600]  Like you're in a foundry.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.522]  Like lava on a volcano.
[00:55:11.522 --> 00:55:17.988]  There wasn't a lot of screaming, there wasn't a lot of yelling.
[00:55:17.988 --> 00:55:19.469]  Obviously there was no machinery.
[00:55:19.469 --> 00:55:23.433]  And they're in there not understanding why
[00:55:27.162 --> 00:55:31.165]  This is when the planes have hit, they're going in, and there's molten metal just pouring out.
[00:55:31.165 --> 00:55:33.046]  They're like, what is this?
[00:55:33.046 --> 00:55:35.968]  Folks, jet fuel burns, maybe 1,800 degrees.
[00:55:35.968 --> 00:55:37.849]  Steel starts weakening at about 2,500.
[00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:44.194]  It starts melting past 3,000, depending on its makeup, what type of steel it is.
[00:55:44.194 --> 00:55:52.420]  And that's what the thermal photographs by NASA from its aircraft show of temperatures months later.
[00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:57.598]  In the pile of over 2,500, 2,600 degrees.
[00:55:57.598 --> 00:55:59.339]  Some of the readings show over 3,000.
[00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:00.319]  This is months later.
[00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:06.702]  This was high-tech weapons that they were using in there, high-tech bombs.
[00:56:06.702 --> 00:56:18.268]  And I've got a list here of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 different clips just in Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[00:56:18.268 --> 00:56:21.210]  I'm begging you, if you've been a critic of 9-11 Truth,
[00:56:22.864 --> 00:56:25.165]  And you haven't looked at the evidence and you make jokes about it.
[00:56:25.165 --> 00:56:26.005]  This isn't a joke.
[00:56:26.005 --> 00:56:27.665]  This is your life we're talking about.
[00:56:27.665 --> 00:56:28.726]  Our lives.
[00:56:28.726 --> 00:56:30.766]  Go watch all the firefighters.
[00:56:30.766 --> 00:56:33.807]  Go watch all the videos.
[00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:36.007]  Understand this is impossible.
[00:56:36.007 --> 00:56:44.550]  Understand that Willie Rodriguez, who was, you know, this big hero on national TV, that he was then demonized for saying, no, there were bombs going off.
[00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:46.110]  The firefighters all know about it.
[00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:49.091]  There were bombs going off down the bottom of the World Trade Center North Tower.
[00:56:50.558 --> 00:56:52.179]  He's a hero.
[00:56:52.179 --> 00:56:55.961]  He's had the courage to come out with many others and then they get ridiculed.
[00:56:55.961 --> 00:57:00.604]  And then for nine years they say the dust isn't bad for you and it turns out the government knew and lied about it.
[00:57:00.604 --> 00:57:06.847]  And I saw the New York Post call the firefighters and police ambulance chasers that they're trying to get medical care.
[00:57:06.847 --> 00:57:11.149]  Just like our troops who were exposed to the depleted uranium.
[00:57:11.149 --> 00:57:14.191]  Our troops are exposed to the depleted uranium.
[00:57:14.191 --> 00:57:19.274]  The Army's own reports know it's going to give them cancers, birth defects, kill them.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.382]  With degenerative cancers and other disorders.
[00:57:23.382 --> 00:57:25.844]  And, you know, they just say, doesn't matter.
[00:57:25.844 --> 00:57:36.874]  The Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs, the VA will not give them medical care for the DU because they won't admit DU's hurting them when the Army's own manuals.
[00:57:36.874 --> 00:57:39.296]  I've had the head of the Army's DU program on the show.
[00:57:40.902 --> 00:57:42.363]  A lot of his team have died.
[00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:44.624]  He's had 20 plus surgeries.
[00:57:44.624 --> 00:57:46.185]  That's destroyed his kidneys.
[00:57:46.185 --> 00:57:53.790]  That's because that's where it comes out of the bones and the body and really concentrates in the kidneys and the urinary tract.
[00:57:55.489 --> 00:58:00.952]  He's got cataracts from it, and that's what their own reports from before Desert Storm and the new war.
[00:58:00.952 --> 00:58:04.873]  The army knew this back in the 50s when they were looking at using DU as a weapon.
[00:58:04.873 --> 00:58:06.194]  They said, we can't.
[00:58:06.194 --> 00:58:07.295]  It causes organ failure.
[00:58:07.295 --> 00:58:08.155]  It attacks the kidneys.
[00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:09.396]  It causes skin cancer.
[00:58:09.396 --> 00:58:14.058]  It causes cancer of the sinus.
[00:58:14.058 --> 00:58:15.478]  It concentrates.
[00:58:15.478 --> 00:58:18.860]  It's like asbestos, but hundreds of times worse.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.261]  This is what they think of you.
[00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:24.643]  Don't you understand that they're murderers who see human life as
[00:58:25.888 --> 00:58:27.229]  Less than worthless?
[00:58:27.229 --> 00:58:30.593]  They see it as a negative, as trash to be taken out?
[00:58:30.593 --> 00:58:33.516]  They see it like dog droppings in your house?
[00:58:33.516 --> 00:58:42.025]  They don't just not care about you, they hate you and want you dead because you are heroes.
[00:58:42.025 --> 00:58:43.406]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:54.862]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.862 --> 00:58:55.782]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.782 --> 00:58:59.205]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.205 --> 00:59:00.065]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.065 --> 00:59:04.968]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.968 --> 00:59:05.709]  It's true.
[00:59:05.709 --> 00:59:10.572]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.572 --> 00:59:11.412]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.412 --> 00:59:14.995]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.995 --> 00:59:18.697]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.897 --> 00:59:19.678]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.678 --> 00:59:22.441]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.441 --> 00:59:26.125]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.125 --> 00:59:26.925]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.925 --> 00:59:31.070]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:35.835]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:46.938 --> 00:59:48.299]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:54.221]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:09.993]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.993 --> 01:00:11.595]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.595 --> 01:00:12.496]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.496 --> 01:00:17.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:21.386]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:34.260]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I've got news on the economy that is off the charts insane.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.521]  I've got police state news.
[01:00:36.521 --> 01:00:40.502]  I've got this Texas lake where a bunch of people have been shot at and robbed.
[01:00:40.502 --> 01:00:42.982]  And this woman watches her husband killed.
[01:00:42.982 --> 01:00:47.364]  And CBS News is trying to imply that she's a liar.
[01:00:47.364 --> 01:00:49.864]  And the police are going, no, we get shot at all the time.
[01:00:49.864 --> 01:00:52.345]  You shouldn't even be on the lake now.
[01:00:52.345 --> 01:00:57.066]  Poor tourists come in to go bass fishing or water skiing and you die, you get kidnapped.
[01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:02.116]  And the media's like, oh, this woman, her husband probably just drowned.
[01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:04.457]  She said three boats pulled up and shot him right in the head.
[01:01:04.457 --> 01:01:12.819]  And then they sat there laughing at her while she was trying to pull him up on the jet ski, which anybody who's ridden a jet ski knows is next to impossible.
[01:01:12.819 --> 01:01:17.001]  And it's just funny, the Mexican government's like, ah, shut up, conspiracy theory.
[01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.441]  There's nothing going on in Mexico.
[01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.782]  There's no murders on the border.
[01:01:20.782 --> 01:01:23.242]  Five mayors killed in the last month down there, 28,000 dead.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.481]  Capital of kidnapping in the U.S.
[01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:30.183]  now, Arizona.
[01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:31.504]  There's no problem.
[01:01:31.504 --> 01:01:36.847]  But getting back to 9-11 and this huge news, let's play that clip again.
[01:01:36.847 --> 01:01:42.930]  The clip of firefighters saying it was as if there were detonators, floors popping out.
[01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:44.611]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:45.012]  Here it is.
[01:01:47.279 --> 01:01:49.000]  We made it outside, we made it about a block.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.503]  We made it at least two blocks, and we started running.
[01:01:53.503 --> 01:01:55.544]  Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[01:01:55.544 --> 01:01:57.305]  It was like, it was as if they had detonated.
[01:01:57.305 --> 01:01:58.226]  Yeah, detonated.
[01:01:58.226 --> 01:02:00.127]  As if they were planning to take down a building.
[01:02:00.127 --> 01:02:01.427]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:02.048]  All the way down.
[01:02:02.048 --> 01:02:03.509]  I was marching in and running.
[01:02:03.509 --> 01:02:04.369]  Just ran up West Street.
[01:02:04.369 --> 01:02:08.332]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of **** takes you down.
[01:02:08.332 --> 01:02:09.312]  Couldn't outrun it.
[01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:10.193]  I couldn't outrun it.
[01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:10.773]  So what'd you do?
[01:02:10.773 --> 01:02:13.815]  I jumped behind a battalion car, I hid under the car, I just went and died.
[01:02:16.593 --> 01:02:19.356]  Okay, so there you have it.
[01:02:19.356 --> 01:02:23.820]  We had to cut out again a few of the cuss words.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:34.731]  Now let's play the new video where the International Center for 9-11 Studies shows firefighters describing secondary explosions shortly before the collapse
[01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:35.812]  It was an explosion.
[01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:07.990]  He's in the lobby and the third explosion, the whole lobby collapsed on us.
[01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.750]  What was it like?
[01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.611]  What was it like?
[01:03:10.611 --> 01:03:10.951]  Horrible.
[01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:11.791]  It's like hell.
[01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:12.832]  You don't want to know.
[01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:15.373]  The whole building just collapsed on us, inside the lobby.
[01:03:15.373 --> 01:03:17.013]  Was that a secondary explosion?
[01:03:17.013 --> 01:03:17.674]  Yes, it was.
[01:03:17.674 --> 01:03:18.974]  That was the plan for everything?
[01:03:18.974 --> 01:03:20.295]  Yeah, definitely a secondary explosion.
[01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:25.157]  We was inside waiting to go upstairs, and on the way upstairs, the whole thing went blue.
[01:03:25.157 --> 01:03:27.217]  It just collapsed on everybody inside the lobby.
[01:03:27.217 --> 01:03:29.078]  Similar to the first tower coming down, secondary?
[01:03:29.078 --> 01:03:31.919]  I don't know about the first one, but I know the second one, it was terrible.
[01:03:31.919 --> 01:03:33.600]  Then there was a third one, too, after that one.
[01:03:35.273 --> 01:03:36.714]  That's right.
[01:03:36.714 --> 01:03:40.998]  Everybody was inside the building, waiting to go upstairs, and they just let loose.
[01:03:40.998 --> 01:03:43.340]  Everything just let loose inside the building.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:47.785]  So, what you're telling me is that there was a plane or whatever hit the building, and a secondary explosion?
[01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:49.606]  There was like three explosions after that.
[01:03:49.606 --> 01:03:51.668]  We came in after the fire.
[01:03:51.668 --> 01:03:53.570]  We came when the fire was going on already.
[01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:58.474]  We was in the staging area inside the building, waiting to go upstairs, and it exploded.
[01:03:58.474 --> 01:04:00.656]  The whole lobby collapsed on the lobby inside.
[01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:03.607]  May I'm after that?
[01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:06.149]  No, just may everybody try to work their way out.
[01:04:06.149 --> 01:04:07.990]  Just trying to help all the brothers get out of there.
[01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:10.011]  A lot of people's trapped inside.
[01:04:10.011 --> 01:04:13.253]  We are crossing Brooklyn.
[01:04:13.253 --> 01:04:16.976]  We watched the first explosion as we watched the buildings.
[01:04:16.976 --> 01:04:20.818]  A black, very large airplane fly right into the second building.
[01:04:20.818 --> 01:04:22.559]  Came out of the south.
[01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.641]  Right in front of our eyes.
[01:04:24.641 --> 01:04:26.562]  It was so surreal, like a movie set.
[01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.163]  Second and third explosions also.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.242]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is more proof and it's all in our article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:42.683]  9-1-1 firefighters reveal huge explosions before towers collapse.

[01:05:11.015 --> 01:05:18.401]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:23.284]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:42.956]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?

[01:07:02.923 --> 01:07:06.724]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:07:06.724 --> 01:07:09.585]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:07:09.585 --> 01:07:14.527]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:07:57.210 --> 01:08:06.535]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.243 --> 01:08:20.612]  This is a major strike against tyranny that for nine years the federal government has blocked the release of the firefighter and police video interviews from during the attack.
[01:08:20.612 --> 01:08:33.242]  Where they have units of firefighters and police that were documenting everything and we know why they barred the release of this but via the lawsuit some of it has been now released because it shows the bombs going off in Building 7.
[01:08:35.307 --> 01:08:38.331]  In fact, I want to play a clip, give you guys a heads up.
[01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:41.716]  I want to play 1843 clip.
[01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.558]  Keep your eye on that building.
[01:08:43.558 --> 01:08:45.361]  It'll be coming down soon.
[01:08:45.361 --> 01:08:48.885]  Now, before this CNN footage.
[01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:51.216]  We're good to go.
[01:09:07.295 --> 01:09:09.836]  You know, the firefighter commanders, the police commanders.
[01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:14.418]  And the globalists spin this and say, you're saying the fire chief and the police were involved.
[01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:15.478]  No, they're compartmentalized.
[01:09:15.478 --> 01:09:17.139]  They're told, get back, it's coming down.
[01:09:17.139 --> 01:09:18.620]  So they didn't hide that fact.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.541]  They go, get back, it's coming down.
[01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:21.621]  Keep your eye on that building.
[01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:23.542]  It's going to be blowing up in a minute.
[01:09:23.542 --> 01:09:27.844]  And you've had all the local newscasts that we've aired where they were saying, we're thinking about blowing up 7.
[01:09:27.844 --> 01:09:31.985]  Well, then the question is, how did you blow up 7 so quickly?
[01:09:31.985 --> 01:09:35.687]  How did you get bombs in a building that had already blown up in the morning when nothing hit it?
[01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:40.590]  As police and the deputy head of emergency management Barry Jennings and others have set on record.
[01:09:42.858 --> 01:09:46.060]  But I had interviewed people who said this exact same thing before it happened.
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:50.222]  I talked to an EMT as well, who walked up and said, what's going on?
[01:09:50.222 --> 01:09:51.643]  Why get back?
[01:09:51.643 --> 01:09:58.107]  And it was a plainclothes person on the radio, identifying himself as part of the medical team.
[01:09:58.107 --> 01:10:00.809]  And they said, look, look, I can't tell you, I can't tell you.
[01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:06.952]  And then all of a sudden he just turns the radio and it's seven, six, five, four.
[01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:09.614]  And he goes, just run for your lives!
[01:10:10.254 --> 01:10:13.677]  And that's why you see cops and firefighters and everybody starts running.
[01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:20.542]  Amy Goodman, when she had a local show, the head of Democracy Now!, she's there and you see her and you see firemen and police running.
[01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:24.806]  There's Building 7 a few blocks down and she's going, what's going on?
[01:10:24.806 --> 01:10:29.950]  And I've talked to the police, the firefighters, the medical workers who all saw this, the countdown, the screaming, the yelling.
[01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:36.034]  And we've got footage from multiple local stations and CNN as they're saying, get back, they're bringing it down.
[01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.978]  And Amy Goodman starts running, and boom, boom, boom!
[01:10:39.978 --> 01:10:43.141]  That sucker goes down on its own footprint at free-fall speed.
[01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:48.686]  And the government lied and said, no, it wasn't free-fall, you know, because that would mean bombs, and later they said, okay, it was free-fall.
[01:10:48.686 --> 01:10:49.787]  Free-fall!
[01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:56.093]  Now let's go ahead and play this clip of the cops saying, get back, get back, keep your eye on that building, it's not going to be there in a minute, here it is.
[01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:32.417]  Just in the last few seconds another building, building number seven, one of the buildings in support of the World Trade Center towers has collapsed.
[01:11:36.914 --> 01:11:39.855]  This is no small building, as you can see.
[01:11:39.855 --> 01:11:47.177]  At 47 stories, it would stand out in most American cities.
[01:11:47.177 --> 01:11:49.658]  What did Dan Rather say?
[01:11:49.658 --> 01:11:52.779]  He said, let's go to tape of building 7, seconds after it fell.
[01:11:52.779 --> 01:11:54.139]  He said, let's replay the tape.
[01:11:54.139 --> 01:11:59.341]  This is reminiscent of where they use dynamite to knock a building down.
[01:12:00.523 --> 01:12:08.745]  Peter Jennings said the same thing, but you can hear the police going, get back, it's coming down, it's not going to be there, and you hear, pow, pow, pow, pow.
[01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:10.446]  They're like, you hear that?
[01:12:10.446 --> 01:12:11.926]  You hear that?
[01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:20.008]  All these clips are in Paul Joseph Watson's article right now, video, 9-1-1 firefighters reveal huge explosions before towers collapse.
[01:12:20.008 --> 01:12:22.148]  The North Tower, that was all seven.
[01:12:22.148 --> 01:12:23.709]  Same story with
[01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:25.539]  The North Tower.
[01:12:25.539 --> 01:12:28.201]  But this is a long time.
[01:12:28.201 --> 01:12:30.763]  You can go to the timeline from Willie Rodriguez and others.
[01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.045]  A long time before it fell.
[01:12:33.045 --> 01:12:34.566]  Firefighters had just gotten there.
[01:12:34.566 --> 01:12:35.987]  They were going into the lobby.
[01:12:35.987 --> 01:12:38.289]  Boom!
[01:12:38.289 --> 01:12:39.610]  And then boom!
[01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:40.891]  Boom!
[01:12:40.891 --> 01:12:43.333]  Same thing in Building 7.
[01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:44.414]  How do you create confusion?
[01:12:44.414 --> 01:12:47.297]  How do you make sure all the cops and emergency workers don't figure out what's going on?
[01:12:47.297 --> 01:12:49.579]  You blow up several floors of Building 7.
[01:12:51.636 --> 01:13:00.942]  At least 10 minutes after the towers had been hit, if you go to the timeline, a little bit more than 10 minutes, and then they're trying to get out of the building, and boom!
[01:13:00.942 --> 01:13:02.623]  You're not going anywhere.
[01:13:02.623 --> 01:13:05.245]  You aren't on the team that got the warning.
[01:13:05.245 --> 01:13:10.208]  You're not part of the dark side.
[01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:20.195]  Now, how important is it to get this new video that we played earlier in the last hour, video, 9-1-1 firefighters reveal huge explosion before twin towers collapsed.
[01:13:21.516 --> 01:13:27.940]  And then you read the article and it goes through everything and has links to all the videos.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.481]  And it's already a lengthy article.
[01:13:29.481 --> 01:13:34.684]  Watson is going to be adding more evidence because it's a bottomless pit of evidence all day long to this article.
[01:13:34.684 --> 01:13:38.746]  Curt Nemo is getting it up at Infowars.com right now.
[01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:44.210]  We need your help to get this story out to everyone because the globalists have built their global war.
[01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:57.380]  They have built all their tyranny, their naked body scanners, their secret police, their citizen spies, their MIAC and Homeland Security reports, and now switching from Al Qaeda being the enemy to conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, returning veterans.
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:00.482]  And they're training youth teams to hunt down and kill veterans.
[01:14:00.482 --> 01:14:05.726]  New York Times, scouts trained to take on veterans.
[01:14:05.726 --> 01:14:10.110]  You cannot make this type of stuff up.
[01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:20.444]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, again, this is so hardcore what's happening.
[01:14:20.444 --> 01:14:23.689]  This is so huge what's happening.
[01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:25.671]  And I wish this wasn't true.
[01:14:25.671 --> 01:14:26.873]  I wish this wasn't the case.
[01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:32.074]  Okay, I wish that 9-11 wasn't an inside job, but it is.
[01:14:32.074 --> 01:14:37.218]  Just with the bombs, just with the buildings, that's total proof, and the thermite residue and all that evidence.
[01:14:37.218 --> 01:14:38.759]  Then you got NORAD standing down.
[01:14:38.759 --> 01:14:44.443]  You got Cheney ordering the Pentagon to stand down in front of Norman Panetta, the head of transportation.
[01:14:44.443 --> 01:14:47.286]  You've got the head of the U.S.
[01:14:47.286 --> 01:14:52.349]  visa section in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Springman, being told, you know, I'm not going to let these people in.
[01:14:52.349 --> 01:14:53.770]  They've got terrorist backgrounds.
[01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:55.752]  State Department says, don't worry, it's a CIA cover.
[01:14:57.315 --> 01:14:59.341]  You know, let Mohammed Adda and all these people in.
[01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:00.063]  That's what he was told.
[01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:04.502]  Then we have MSNBC, hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:15:04.502 --> 01:15:05.562]  military bases.
[01:15:05.562 --> 01:15:15.783]  You have James Woods, the actor, a week before the attacks, on a plane, and Adda and others are getting up, like, doing drills, because they thought they were doing, you know, airport security drills.
[01:15:15.783 --> 01:15:19.224]  They were hired by Homeland Security, but what do they get set up?
[01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:22.705]  And we now don't know if the FBI was paying for their houses, their credit cards.
[01:15:22.705 --> 01:15:24.065]  This has all come out.
[01:15:24.065 --> 01:15:26.945]  They had Israelis shadowing them as well.
[01:15:26.945 --> 01:15:28.126]  The art students.
[01:15:28.126 --> 01:15:29.746]  This all even came out on Fox News.
[01:15:30.546 --> 01:15:40.677]  So you've got all this intelligence going on, and James Woods tells the flight crew, when the plane hits its destination, he tells everybody, they say, don't worry about it.
[01:15:40.677 --> 01:15:48.546]  A day later, the FBI shows up and basically says, shut your mouth about what you saw.
[01:15:48.546 --> 01:15:50.789]  And we know, Atta, and then we're doing drills everywhere.
[01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:58.769]  And good people in government who aren't part of the dark side, they tried to stop all this, like Anthony Schaeffer, the colonel.
[01:15:58.769 --> 01:16:19.387]  And now it's come out with other witnesses in the Pentagon that he's telling the truth, that they were blocked from stopping al-Qaeda when it was running this operation because Sybil Edmonds, who was tracking it as an FBI translator, listening to the NSA tapes, she said on the day of 9-11, the CIA was commanding al-Qaeda in Afghanistan for a major attack.
[01:16:21.004 --> 01:16:22.745]  Running Al-Qaeda!
[01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.407]  Sybil Edmonds, running Al-Qaeda!
[01:16:25.407 --> 01:16:29.150]  She told the 9-11 Commission that, and they slapped a gag on her.
[01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:30.631]  But she broke the gag last year.
[01:16:30.631 --> 01:16:33.574]  A lot of courage.
[01:16:33.574 --> 01:16:38.498]  They can't shut us all up, but they want to cover this up.
[01:16:38.498 --> 01:16:48.966]  Shifting gears, because G. Edward Griffin is coming up, and we're going to play a special video interview we did last week with him in Los Angeles concerning the new film.
[01:16:51.237 --> 01:16:53.558]  What in the world are they spraying dealing with geoengineering?
[01:16:53.558 --> 01:16:57.800]  We're going to play that video clip at 33 after before we go to him live.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:04.143]  But for the rest of this segment and the next, I want to get in to the
[01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:23.942]  economy because it is incredibly important obviously gold has hit another all-time record today and we'll put that on screen and to talk about this what is it $1345
[01:17:30.091 --> 01:17:35.595]  And 50 cents, it's not even taking a breather, normally does, before it goes back up again.
[01:17:35.595 --> 01:17:38.917]  It's up $4.90 today.
[01:17:38.917 --> 01:17:53.267]  And while I'm digging out my financial news stack that I know is here somewhere in front of me, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up to give us a report on what he sees happening in the precious metals market today.
[01:17:53.267 --> 01:17:54.348]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[01:17:54.798 --> 01:17:57.299]  Yeah, thanks for having me up today, Alex.
[01:17:57.299 --> 01:17:58.779]  We did hit a high already today at $13.50.
[01:17:58.779 --> 01:18:00.079]  Silver went over $23 an ounce, $23.09.
[01:18:00.079 --> 01:18:01.860]  Like you said, it's right now, I've got it at $13.40, $6.80, $23.05 for silver.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.201]  The resistance level now was moved upward from that $13.50 level now to $13.75 gold.
[01:18:05.201 --> 01:18:06.621]  And the support level is at $13.13, which is up from $13.00.
[01:18:24.605 --> 01:18:27.927]  Alex, gold and silver is breaking loose and breaking forward.
[01:18:27.927 --> 01:18:31.108]  Again, we're still in early October.
[01:18:31.108 --> 01:18:38.091]  Morgan Stanley is out of the business of manipulating the market, according to what they say from the news yesterday.
[01:18:38.091 --> 01:18:40.511]  That could have a lot to do with why gold is going up.
[01:18:40.511 --> 01:18:42.872]  I know the dollar is falling.
[01:18:42.872 --> 01:18:51.136]  A lot of things that used to be in place aren't in place anymore, so there's going to be a little bit more of a free market movement in the gold and silver.
[01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:58.362]  You know, Alex, you and I just said it last summer, please get into gold and silver.
[01:18:58.362 --> 01:19:01.865]  Do it now while the prices are low.
[01:19:01.865 --> 01:19:04.768]  We're still in, you know, I mean, gold right now at $13.50.
[01:19:04.768 --> 01:19:08.071]  For those of you who have been thinking about it but haven't moved yet,
[01:19:08.812 --> 01:19:12.993]  You know, you're now looking at $1,350 rather than $1,200.
[01:19:12.993 --> 01:19:20.475]  And if you wait, my guess is you're going to be paying over $1,400 an ounce in that spot range for gold.
[01:19:20.475 --> 01:19:25.597]  Well, I mean, I've got MSNBC and AP saying $2,000 in the near future.
[01:19:25.597 --> 01:19:27.878]  So we've actually been squeamish.
[01:19:27.878 --> 01:19:31.499]  I have gold as an emergency backup.
[01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:33.139]  Remember that Bloomberg headline yesterday?
[01:19:33.139 --> 01:19:35.840]  The ultra-rich are buying gold by the ton.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:49.772]  The ultra-rich are taking physical collection of it, and the Federal Reserve was back out today saying, and Curt Nemo's got an article about it at InfoWars.com, that they are going to accelerate the devaluation of the dollar.
[01:19:49.772 --> 01:19:51.453]  We'll talk about what that means.
[01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:57.879]  The only way I know to somewhat protect yourself, because nothing's perfect, from devaluation of the currency is precious metals.
[01:19:57.879 --> 01:19:59.060]  We'll be right back with Ted Anderson.
[01:20:01.607 --> 01:20:05.951]  To ship a vehicle safely from point A to point B, which company should you choose?

[01:21:59.471 --> 01:22:02.434]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:02.434 --> 01:22:06.579]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:22:06.579 --> 01:22:08.861]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:08.861 --> 01:22:14.027]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:14.027 --> 01:22:15.849]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:15.849 --> 01:22:17.150]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.852]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:18.852 --> 01:22:22.236]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:22.236 --> 01:22:27.602]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:27.602 --> 01:22:36.712]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[01:22:58.929 --> 01:23:03.833]  You've seen our SinoFresh banner on the GCN website, yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:23:03.973 --> 01:23:06.735]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:23:06.735 --> 01:23:08.957]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:23:08.957 --> 01:23:10.358]  Okay, here it comes!
[01:23:10.358 --> 01:23:12.279]  But first, the facts.
[01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:14.200]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.182]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:23:16.182 --> 01:23:19.885]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:23:19.885 --> 01:23:27.630]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:28.511]  Sinofresh.

[01:23:48.283 --> 01:23:49.064]  Mention GCN.
[01:23:49.064 --> 01:23:49.804]  Buysinofresh.com.
[01:23:49.804 --> 01:23:50.204]  It works!
[01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:12.871]  The globalist CEU is expendable.
[01:24:12.871 --> 01:24:17.572]  They are financially destroying us to conquer us.
[01:24:17.572 --> 01:24:26.093]  But the good news is, they've been trying to suppress gold and silver while they were devaluing the currency globally in a concerted devaluation, coordinated devaluation.
[01:24:26.093 --> 01:24:27.134]  They can't do that anymore.
[01:24:27.134 --> 01:24:29.114]  They can't hide the fact we're going into a depression.
[01:24:31.069 --> 01:24:36.012]  We may be able to get some real monetary reforms if the people wake up, and that's starting to happen.
[01:24:36.012 --> 01:24:41.076]  Private sector sheds 39,000 jobs in September.
[01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.457]  That's from Reuters.
[01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:43.618]  Here's another one.
[01:24:43.618 --> 01:24:48.061]  Fed hints it will print and inflate dollars as gold hits new record.
[01:24:48.061 --> 01:24:50.202]  CurtinMoInfoWars.com.
[01:24:50.202 --> 01:24:51.583]  Here's Market Watch.
[01:24:51.583 --> 01:24:56.126]  The Fed is dead, maybe by 2012.
[01:24:56.126 --> 01:24:58.368]  But the problem is they're going to roll it into a new global bank.
[01:24:59.366 --> 01:25:00.847]  That's Market Watch.
[01:25:00.847 --> 01:25:02.408]  The Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:02.408 --> 01:25:03.089]  Here's another one.
[01:25:03.089 --> 01:25:04.310]  Legendary Investor.
[01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:08.653]  It's a given that gold will exceed $2,000 an ounce.
[01:25:08.653 --> 01:25:14.537]  Currency wars will see precious metals continue to soar.
[01:25:14.537 --> 01:25:15.177]  Continuing.
[01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:18.279]  New Yorkers' income falls for the first time in 70 years.
[01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.001]  CNBC.
[01:25:20.001 --> 01:25:20.601]  Here's another one.
[01:25:20.601 --> 01:25:21.101]  Bloomberg.
[01:25:21.101 --> 01:25:22.282]  Goldman Sachs says U.S.
[01:25:22.282 --> 01:25:24.384]  economy may be fairly bad.
[01:25:24.384 --> 01:25:26.545]  Tell us something we don't know, criminals.
[01:25:26.545 --> 01:25:27.166]  Here's another one.
[01:25:28.322 --> 01:25:38.951]  Greek debt and deficit figures to shoot up EU and they raise your taxes as services get cut everything goes for interest on the debt that isn't owed to the bankers.
[01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:43.015]  They make record bonuses you become homeless.
[01:25:43.015 --> 01:25:49.800]  Ireland's rating has been downgraded on cost of banking bailout and it came out in Ireland it's coming out in England it's coming out in
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:52.561]  I don't know.
[01:26:08.973 --> 01:26:13.579]  I just saw in the paper a few days ago a Texas bank where the executives had stolen billions.
[01:26:13.579 --> 01:26:25.474]  And the news, my dad actually showed it to me, with his Texas-based bank, said that, well, since they were the executives, it doesn't matter if it's accounting fraud or controller fraud, they're not going to get in trouble
[01:26:25.734 --> 01:26:26.155]  We're good
[01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:43.819]  Gold is shooting up.
[01:26:43.819 --> 01:26:45.220]  I think now is the time.
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:48.202]  I mean, it's not rocket science for folks to calling it gold and silver.
[01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:55.607]  And I know the deals at MidasResources.com, the deals we're linked to on Infowars.com are excellent, but the radio specials are the very best.
[01:26:55.607 --> 01:27:02.232]  Now, you're about to run out of gold that, again, you bought a few weeks ago, just like you ran out of gold that you bought a month ago.
[01:27:02.232 --> 01:27:05.534]  What are your specials now, and how long can you hold them?
[01:27:06.451 --> 01:27:13.714]  Well, the specials are the same as they were yesterday, despite the fact that both silver and gold has just rocketed upward.
[01:27:13.714 --> 01:27:16.015]  The Walking Liberty half is at $10.83.
[01:27:16.015 --> 01:27:16.595]  Franks are at $2.89.
[01:27:16.595 --> 01:27:17.915]  British Sovereign's $3.62.
[01:27:17.915 --> 01:27:19.216]  Again, we have bags of silver.
[01:27:19.216 --> 01:27:20.576]  $20 Liberties, here's a good one, $16.85.
[01:27:27.739 --> 01:27:33.482]  Twenty-dollar liberties usually carry a premium that's much higher than that in relativity to spot gold.
[01:27:33.482 --> 01:27:35.102]  There's a whole long list of things.
[01:27:35.102 --> 01:27:37.123]  We just barely touched on it yesterday.
[01:27:37.123 --> 01:27:39.625]  I notice you still have buffaloes on your site.
[01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:41.906]  I do, because I'm trading them onesies, twosies, man.
[01:27:41.906 --> 01:27:46.848]  If you want to have a buffalo or two, you can order them, and I'll fill that order, but you're not going to get a hundred of them.
[01:27:48.009 --> 01:27:52.873]  The creature from Jekyll Island you mentioned yesterday, Alex, is that I'm selling it at $19.95.
[01:27:52.873 --> 01:27:55.195]  We put a silver dollar in there.
[01:27:55.195 --> 01:27:57.938]  Silver is $23 an ounce.
[01:27:57.938 --> 01:27:59.699]  Excuse me, excuse me, it was $26.
[01:27:59.699 --> 01:28:03.983]  You've lowered it with silver dollars on average are going for about $25 a piece, spot silver over $22.
[01:28:03.983 --> 01:28:05.885]  $19, you get a $19 book and basically a free silver dollar.
[01:28:11.693 --> 01:28:20.304]  Yeah, well, but there is $6.50 for the priority shipping, so all together it's $26.45, but, you know, I don't care.
[01:28:20.304 --> 01:28:25.991]  Where you look, under what rock across the entire world right now, try to buy silver dollars.
[01:28:25.991 --> 01:28:29.375]  You're not going to buy a silver dollar and get it shipped to you for less than 26 smackers.
[01:28:30.316 --> 01:28:31.878]  No, you're not.
[01:28:31.878 --> 01:28:40.245]  And then you get the Creature from Jekyll Island book, which is just a great essay on how the Fed came into existence and what they've been doing to us.
[01:28:40.245 --> 01:28:42.307]  Ted, you cannot beat that.
[01:28:42.307 --> 01:28:44.629]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:52.797]  Ted has been around for 30 years, but he's becoming a major player because these radio specials, nobody can match him.
[01:28:52.797 --> 01:28:54.658]  And Ted is a wild man.
[01:28:54.658 --> 01:28:55.139]  But again,
[01:28:55.439 --> 01:29:00.987]  Even though these are great deals, it's gonna go up, and the next deal will be great, because it'll be less than what anybody else has.
[01:29:00.987 --> 01:29:02.689]  But get involved now, folks.
[01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:04.691]  That is... I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[01:29:04.691 --> 01:29:04.952]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:04.952 --> 01:29:05.012]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:05.232]  It's key!
[01:29:11.516 --> 01:29:18.283]  When you call to explain, this is the radio special from Alex Jones, because your prices are more if it's not the special, right?
[01:29:18.283 --> 01:29:28.073]  They are, and every now and then somebody will call in and say, hey, I want that Buffalo coin, and the broker is going to give them a price that's current, and they're going to say, wait a minute, you have it on the internet, and it's a lower price.
[01:29:28.073 --> 01:29:30.376]  The reason why that is is because it's a special for Alex.
[01:29:30.376 --> 01:29:31.537]  You have to mention that.
[01:29:31.877 --> 01:29:33.579]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:33.579 --> 01:29:35.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:07.665]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.665 --> 01:30:12.808]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.808 --> 01:30:21.533]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.533 --> 01:30:25.615]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:25.615 --> 01:30:27.557]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:30.032 --> 01:30:34.613]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:30:34.613 --> 01:30:38.454]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:30:38.454 --> 01:30:39.674]  Others don't.
[01:30:39.674 --> 01:30:41.834]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.834 --> 01:30:43.615]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.615 --> 01:30:46.495]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.495 --> 01:30:50.736]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:53.137]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:53.137 --> 01:30:55.817]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:58.198]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:30:58.198 --> 01:30:59.058]  Others don't.
[01:31:00.230 --> 01:31:04.793]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:05.714]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.714 --> 01:31:09.136]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:09.997]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.997 --> 01:31:14.880]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:15.640]  It's true.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:20.504]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.504 --> 01:31:21.324]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.324 --> 01:31:24.906]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.906 --> 01:31:28.609]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.809 --> 01:31:29.610]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:32.373]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.373 --> 01:31:36.057]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:36.837]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.837 --> 01:31:41.002]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.002 --> 01:31:45.747]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:58.482 --> 01:33:01.143]  Thank you.
[01:33:01.143 --> 01:33:07.166]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:07.166 --> 01:33:09.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.445 --> 01:33:22.328]  Yeah.
[01:33:31.624 --> 01:33:38.930]  Yes, the film, What in the World Are They Spraying?, I think, is going to be a very important film, and it's going to shock a lot of people.
[01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:39.970]  That's interesting, Gail and Christina.
[01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:43.733]  This is of interest not just in this country, but European countries and, frankly, all over the world.
[01:33:43.733 --> 01:33:44.694]  A lot of folks are interested in it.
[01:33:44.694 --> 01:33:53.701]  Well, Dave, you mentioned that climatologists and others who study the atmosphere believe that they'd be able to surely spot any kind of signs of an ominous plot.
[01:33:54.221 --> 01:34:12.230]  Scientists gathered at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Diego to discuss the plausibility of implementing various geoengineering campaigns throughout the world, all under the guise that the Earth has a man-made global warming problem that can, in part, be solved by spraying aerosol, aluminum, and other particles into the sky to block the sun.
[01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:18.353]  When these scientists were asked about existing aerosol programs, they stated that no such programs have been implemented to date.
[01:34:18.353 --> 01:34:23.035]  This contradicts the claims of many who state that worldwide aerosol programs have already been started.
[01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:25.651]  Uh, they are spraying something.
[01:34:25.651 --> 01:34:34.357]  I think everyone's innate intelligence tells them what they see in the sky, those crisscrossing of these white trails that go to horizon to horizon.
[01:34:34.357 --> 01:34:38.741]  That's not just ice crystals forming at the back end of a jet engine.
[01:34:39.321 --> 01:34:42.302]  Those ice crystals are absorbed into the atmosphere very soon.
[01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:45.704]  You can see them trailing along right behind an airplane as it flies across the sky.
[01:34:45.704 --> 01:34:49.786]  There's a little trail of white smoke and it just follows the plane and disappears.
[01:34:49.786 --> 01:35:01.231]  That's totally different from these billowing fumes of smoke that go from horizon to horizon and spread out and by the mid-afternoon the sky is milky white.
[01:35:01.231 --> 01:35:06.254]  It's a result of a relatively new industry springing up called geoengineering.
[01:35:06.914 --> 01:35:18.875]  There's a group of scientists and political figures and corporations who are planning to make a great deal of money in changing the nature of our planet.
[01:35:19.642 --> 01:35:21.584]  It is called geoengineering.
[01:35:21.584 --> 01:35:28.212]  Fighting global warming by putting a chemical dust in the atmosphere and reflecting harmful radiation back into space.
[01:35:28.212 --> 01:35:33.678]  We take geoengineering to mean deliberate, large-scale intervention in the Earth system.
[01:35:33.678 --> 01:35:37.642]  There are a variety of schemes that have been discussed for geoengineering.
[01:35:38.643 --> 01:35:44.728]  The classic example is injecting reflecting particles into Earth orbit.
[01:35:44.728 --> 01:35:47.811]  And they say that it's just in the talking stage right now.
[01:35:47.811 --> 01:35:53.236]  They say we're talking about spraying aluminum and barium into the atmosphere.
[01:35:53.236 --> 01:35:57.399]  And they say we need to do studies to see if there are toxic effects and so forth.
[01:35:57.399 --> 01:36:00.622]  And they're saying all the right things as though they're deliberating it.
[01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:02.484]  But the evidence is abundant now.
[01:36:03.064 --> 01:36:05.685]  That this has been going on for over a decade.
[01:36:05.685 --> 01:36:06.745]  It's been going on.
[01:36:06.745 --> 01:36:08.606]  It's going on right now as we speak.
[01:36:08.606 --> 01:36:13.287]  Believe it or not, military aircraft flying through the region is dropping chaff.
[01:36:13.287 --> 01:36:19.589]  Small bits of aluminum, sometimes it's made of plastic or even metallicized paper products.
[01:36:19.589 --> 01:36:23.311]  But it's used as an anti-radar issue and obviously they're up there practicing.
[01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:27.692]  Now they won't confirm that, but I was in the Marine Corps for many years and I'll tell you right now, but that's what it is.
[01:36:27.932 --> 01:36:31.395]  This is inevitably military or something going on.
[01:36:31.395 --> 01:36:32.575]  The government, the Air Force.
[01:36:32.575 --> 01:36:36.859]  You see this kind of a pattern like this, you can rest assured there's something going on.
[01:36:36.859 --> 01:36:42.563]  They're actually a little bitty magnetic and little bitty strips of whether it's aluminum.
[01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:44.744]  We now know what they're spraying.
[01:36:44.744 --> 01:36:45.705]  We can identify it.
[01:36:45.705 --> 01:36:51.469]  There have been many laboratory tests taken of not only the soil and the water,
[01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:54.452]  But from the rainwater and from the snow.
[01:36:54.452 --> 01:36:56.193]  Now this comes from the sky.
[01:36:56.193 --> 01:36:58.335]  You can't say it came up out of the ground.
[01:36:58.335 --> 01:37:07.602]  And these tests have been taken from atmosphere and rainwater and snow in areas that are hundreds of miles away from industrial centers.
[01:37:07.602 --> 01:37:11.766]  So you can't say it's being blown there from a smokestack or something like that.
[01:37:11.766 --> 01:37:12.706]  And what they're finding
[01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:17.188]  There's an alarming high level of toxic substances.
[01:37:17.188 --> 01:37:25.433]  On Mount Shasta, for example, you should find no aluminum whatsoever in snow up there because it came from the sky.
[01:37:25.433 --> 01:37:31.357]  It's 60 times higher than the snow on Mount Shasta.
[01:37:31.357 --> 01:37:32.477]  Extremely toxic.
[01:37:32.477 --> 01:37:33.738]  Hikers are drinking that stuff.
[01:37:33.738 --> 01:37:36.540]  They're going to kill themselves or they'll lose their minds or something like that.
[01:37:37.165 --> 01:37:39.386]  And we find this all over, not just in Mount Shasta.
[01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:45.609]  We've found high levels in beautiful islands of Hawaii, where they've been spraying a lot.
[01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:48.270]  And you take the samples out of the rainwater.
[01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:50.631]  This stuff is coming from the sky!
[01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:53.933]  But to make matters even worse, they're lying to us about it.
[01:37:53.933 --> 01:37:57.855]  And that's the message in our film, What in the World Are They Spraying?
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:07.361]  I'm G. Edward Griffin.
[01:38:07.361 --> 01:38:11.567]  I'm one of the producers of the video, What in the World Are They Spraying?
[01:38:11.567 --> 01:38:16.513]  In my view, it's one of the most important documentaries you're going to see, perhaps in your lifetime.
[01:38:16.513 --> 01:38:17.494]  Order it now.
[01:38:17.494 --> 01:38:20.158]  It'll be delivered on October 22nd.
[01:38:20.158 --> 01:38:23.122]  But get your copy now, so you'll be one of the first ones to have it.
[01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:36.174]  This film, What in the World Are They Spraying, goes a long way towards waking the people up.
[01:38:36.174 --> 01:38:48.982]  So I salute the filmmakers and I ask all of you to get involved today and to make sure that everyone in your circle understands just how deep this globalist program is.
[01:38:48.982 --> 01:38:51.084]  The film is What in the World Are They Spraying.
[01:38:51.084 --> 01:38:55.267]  Pre-order it now and see it first on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:59.147 --> 01:39:08.536]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and you just saw the new five and a half minute trailer that we shot last week with G. Edward Griffin in Southern California.
[01:39:08.536 --> 01:39:16.884]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if you want to go see it if you're a radio listener.
[01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:23.726]  You can find that at the video is titled G. Edward Griffin Talks About New Chemtrail Film.
[01:39:23.726 --> 01:39:26.707]  It's also at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:39:26.707 --> 01:39:32.449]  And if you want to pre-order it, it's going to be shipping out on or right after the 22nd of October.
[01:39:32.449 --> 01:39:33.009]  It's completed.
[01:39:33.909 --> 01:39:36.170]  It's now going into the manufacturing process.
[01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:38.210]  I've seen the final of it.
[01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:44.011]  Very, very powerful film because it's the first film post-disclosure.
[01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:46.432]  They haven't disclosed it fully, but they go, yeah, we've been doing some testing.
[01:39:46.432 --> 01:39:48.452]  We want to do more testing.
[01:39:48.452 --> 01:39:50.452]  But we know it's a huge secret global program.
[01:39:50.452 --> 01:39:53.833]  There was a Nobel Prize handed out in the early 90s for the idea.
[01:39:53.833 --> 01:39:56.534]  The White House science czar John P. Holdren talks about it.
[01:39:56.534 --> 01:39:58.374]  They're going to save us from global warming by spring.
[01:39:58.914 --> 01:40:03.097]  Aluminum dioxide and barium salts that are very toxic on the population.
[01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:11.102]  And, of course, G. Edward Griffin is a writer and documentary filmmaker, and he really needs no introduction.
[01:40:11.102 --> 01:40:14.865]  And, of course, he's in our film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:40:14.865 --> 01:40:18.387]  He's also in the film I produced, Invisible Empire.
[01:40:18.387 --> 01:40:22.950]  And these films are very well done, they're very well documented, and they're waking people up.
[01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:26.653]  Yes, you know all about this, most of you, but your friends and family don't.
[01:40:27.253 --> 01:40:32.254]  And so you can give them what in the world are they spraying and it's going to be shipped out in the order that they're received.
[01:40:32.254 --> 01:40:36.916]  It usually just takes us a few days to ship out all the pre-orders once we can officially release it.
[01:40:36.916 --> 01:40:37.956]  What in the world are they spraying?
[01:40:37.956 --> 01:40:41.877]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:40:46.218 --> 01:40:52.282]  You can also write to us, and by the time we get your order in the mail, it should be about time to ship it out to you, at P.O.
[01:40:52.282 --> 01:40:53.263]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:40:53.263 --> 01:40:53.923]  Again, P.O.
[01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:56.205]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760, or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:56.205 --> 01:41:00.068]  The easiest way to get it is the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:09.594 --> 01:41:15.276]  And we're going to add today some combos where you can get the video and get some of my films discounted while you're at it.
[01:41:15.276 --> 01:41:16.937]  Makes a great Christmas gift.
[01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:25.100]  But the fact is, the main mission here is to expose this global secret program and several of the big facets are covered in G.E.B.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:25.601]  Griffin's film.
[01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:34.765]  We even sent camera people to some of the same government meetings that are actually in this film where they're admitting that they want to do this and are looking at it.
[01:41:34.765 --> 01:41:42.348]  But we have all the declassifications, we have the patents, where they can mix it with the jet fuel, where they've been already testing it.
[01:41:42.348 --> 01:41:44.529]  They call this giant global program testing.
[01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:47.411]  But some countries don't have it, some do.
[01:41:47.411 --> 01:41:52.895]  Any country basically dominated by the Anglo-American establishment has chemtrailing going on all the time.
[01:41:52.895 --> 01:41:55.617]  And it's weather modification, but it's more than that.
[01:41:55.617 --> 01:42:04.443]  And I was excited to see that they were making a film, because my film that covers chemtrails partially, in my years of research, we're working on two years, won't be out till next year.
[01:42:04.443 --> 01:42:05.624]  So we don't have time.
[01:42:06.004 --> 01:42:07.425]  Who knows what will be next year?
[01:42:07.425 --> 01:42:08.465]  This is a great film.
[01:42:08.465 --> 01:42:13.708]  Order What in the World Are They Spraying at Infowars.com and get it first.
[01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:21.932]  Also, there's going to be an event where they're going to premiere it on the 22nd out in Atlanta, Georgia, and we'll also tell you about that as well.
[01:42:21.932 --> 01:42:24.553]  But going to G. Edward Griffin.
[01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:32.257]  G. Edward, it's good to have you here with us, and I'm glad that you're in this film and have put your name behind it and are producing it because this is vital information.
[01:42:32.717 --> 01:42:33.638]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:42:33.638 --> 01:42:34.979]  I'm glad to be here.
[01:42:34.979 --> 01:42:47.270]  And turning that around, I'm delighted that you've got such an intense interest and knowledge on this because, you know, you're the kind of a guy with the credibility and the following that can really put this over.
[01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:48.792]  So, thanks for doing that.
[01:42:48.792 --> 01:42:49.292]  Oh, you bet.
[01:42:49.292 --> 01:42:58.841]  Tell us how you, I mean, when you started researching aerosol spray, weather modification, persistent jet contrails, as they're known, and about this film.
[01:42:59.707 --> 01:43:03.530]  Well, I kind of backed into this, Alex, as you probably remember.
[01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:12.218]  I've always had a strong interest in the topic, but I've never had the time to dig into it myself and do some really original independent research.
[01:43:12.218 --> 01:43:17.643]  I've always depended on the research of others, and still it's pretty much that way.
[01:43:17.643 --> 01:43:22.908]  But I wished I had had time, but I was so tied up with the issues relating to the Federal Reserve System and
[01:43:23.508 --> 01:43:25.970]  Uh, and alternative health issues and so forth.
[01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:28.732]  The items in which I've worked mostly in the past.
[01:43:28.732 --> 01:43:32.294]  I just didn't have time to go any further into this chemtrail issue.
[01:43:32.294 --> 01:43:33.475]  I had strong feelings.
[01:43:33.475 --> 01:43:34.835]  I had enough information.
[01:43:34.835 --> 01:43:38.318]  But I knew that it wasn't these simple vapor trails.
[01:43:38.318 --> 01:43:40.019]  It wasn't just contrails, as they say.
[01:43:40.559 --> 01:43:45.302]  But anyway, beyond that, I wasn't really prepared to offer myself as any kind of an authority.
[01:43:45.302 --> 01:43:57.848]  Well, it turns out that there were a couple of young filmmakers, Paul Wittenberg and Michael Murphy, that decided they were going to do a video investigation of chemtrails.
[01:43:58.388 --> 01:44:05.753]  So, uh, as luck would have it, they called me and asked if I had an opinion on it, and if so, would I mind making a statement for their cameras?
[01:44:05.753 --> 01:44:08.615]  I said, oh, sure, I've got an opinion on it, so come on over.
[01:44:08.615 --> 01:44:10.816]  So that's how I met these fellows.
[01:44:10.816 --> 01:44:25.826]  So I gave them my little statement on camera, and then they put it up on the Internet, and, boy, it was such a strong response that we discovered that there are people all over the world that are equally concerned and just dying for real information.
[01:44:26.386 --> 01:44:32.489]  So anyway, to make a long story short, Paul and Mike and I decided to pool our resources.
[01:44:32.489 --> 01:44:42.315]  I decided that if I could go on and try and provide some funding and ask for donations to get this film done, give them the money to complete it, that then they could run with it.
[01:44:42.495 --> 01:44:47.316]  Well, they went to Hawaii, they went to Europe, they went all over the U.S.
[01:44:47.316 --> 01:44:48.136]  Just amazing.
[01:44:48.136 --> 01:44:52.097]  And since I announced, you know, a year ago or so, send us footage of chemtrails.
[01:44:52.097 --> 01:44:56.939]  I've gotten them from Australia, Spain, Russia, Mexico.
[01:44:56.939 --> 01:45:05.221]  I mean, time lapse of just a blue sky and then it's just turned into pure trails that hours later are still there.
[01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:06.481]  That's not ice crystals.
[01:45:06.821 --> 01:45:08.102]  Absolutely not.
[01:45:08.102 --> 01:45:10.885]  And it's amazing, you know, I get a lot of flack.
[01:45:10.885 --> 01:45:14.729]  Flack just as you do, I'm sure, from people who say, well, yes, it really is ice crystals.
[01:45:14.729 --> 01:45:16.370]  And they try and justify it.
[01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:20.794]  And, of course, they can make a pretty interesting case until you start looking into the details.
[01:45:20.794 --> 01:45:22.276]  We don't want to go into all that now.
[01:45:22.276 --> 01:45:25.779]  This common sense tells you that these are not ice crystals.
[01:45:25.779 --> 01:45:27.421]  And, of course, the proof of the pudding.
[01:45:29.282 --> 01:45:31.483]  Is that you measure what's coming out of the sky.
[01:45:31.483 --> 01:45:37.344]  I mean, there's stuff coming out of the sky and you can catch it in rainwater, you can catch it in the snow.
[01:45:37.344 --> 01:45:43.385]  And these fellas have been around the world, as you mentioned, and they're talking to researchers who've done exactly that.
[01:45:43.385 --> 01:45:46.466]  One interesting case was up in Mount Shasta area.
[01:45:46.466 --> 01:45:50.026]  Oh my gosh, you can't think of a more pristine area than that.
[01:45:50.026 --> 01:45:54.267]  It's hundreds of miles away from any industrial area.
[01:45:54.267 --> 01:45:57.988]  So you can't say, well, this is just smoke coming out from the smokestacks or something like that.
[01:45:58.695 --> 01:46:07.843]  And they went up and up to these snow caps on top of Mount Shasta, and that's supposed to be about as pure water as you can find anywhere in the world.
[01:46:07.843 --> 01:46:12.307]  And they tested it, and lo and behold, there's aluminum in it.
[01:46:12.307 --> 01:46:13.509]  Aluminum and barium.
[01:46:13.509 --> 01:46:16.932]  Now there's not supposed to be any aluminum and barium falling out of the sky.
[01:46:17.552 --> 01:46:19.094]  That's supposed to be zero.
[01:46:19.094 --> 01:46:19.994]  But what did they find?
[01:46:19.994 --> 01:46:24.879]  Well, it's interesting that the EPA has a measurement that triggers an alert.
[01:46:24.879 --> 01:46:31.826]  You have to do something if there's as many as a thousand parts per billion of aluminum in water.
[01:46:31.826 --> 01:46:32.967]  So what did they find up there?
[01:46:32.967 --> 01:46:34.768]  60,000 parts per billion.
[01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:41.876]  And you've got the test all over California, Hawaii, other areas that are even higher than that!
[01:46:51.826 --> 01:46:52.847]  Yeah, pristine areas!
[01:46:52.847 --> 01:46:53.567]  Hawaii!
[01:46:53.567 --> 01:46:55.008]  I mean, what's going on in Hawaii?
[01:46:55.008 --> 01:47:00.690]  There's no reason for aluminum and barium and strontium to be falling from the sky in Hawaii!
[01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:09.895]  So anyway, you can argue to your blue-in-the-face about these are contrails or these are ice crystals, but the proof really is in what is falling from the sky.
[01:47:09.895 --> 01:47:17.399]  So that's, you know, that's I think where we should focus, rather than the issue of chem versus contrails.
[01:47:17.399 --> 01:47:19.220]  Well, absolutely, but I mean,
[01:47:20.313 --> 01:47:25.317]  Aaron Dykes was up here late last night, but if he's here now, will you guys bring me the big blue folder?
[01:47:25.317 --> 01:47:27.319]  Because next hour, I want to go over our research.
[01:47:27.319 --> 01:47:29.701]  I mean, I'm not waiting until my film comes out next year.
[01:47:29.701 --> 01:47:30.502]  I've seen your film.
[01:47:30.502 --> 01:47:31.503]  It's excellent.
[01:47:31.503 --> 01:47:36.747]  It covers a lot of key facets that are admitted and then gets into some of the things that are being discovered.
[01:47:36.747 --> 01:47:39.289]  But I want to actually show people the patents, the admissions.
[01:47:41.411 --> 01:47:49.297]  If you search the terms, there are thousands of universities, Department of Energy, the Pentagon, they're all up there, quote, doing testing.
[01:47:49.297 --> 01:47:55.122]  They call it testing, but now for the public, they're coming out and saying, oh, we're about to start testing.
[01:47:55.122 --> 01:48:01.747]  And people 15 years ago, when I was first covering this with experts who'd gotten samples, they were saying aluminum dioxide, barium salts.
[01:48:01.747 --> 01:48:05.049]  Then magically, what does that White House science czar say?
[01:48:05.049 --> 01:48:07.971]  Magically, what do all these big scientific journals say?
[01:48:07.971 --> 01:48:10.433]  We want to spray aluminum dioxide, barium salts,
[01:48:11.514 --> 01:48:12.094]  I don't
[01:48:34.059 --> 01:48:36.440]  I mean, I remember being on the radio in 1996.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.141]  People saying, what is this with these trails?
[01:48:38.141 --> 01:48:38.802]  It's the summer.
[01:48:38.802 --> 01:48:40.543]  They're at like 5,000 feet.
[01:48:40.543 --> 01:48:41.723]  They're persistent.
[01:48:41.723 --> 01:48:43.424]  It makes me sick when they hit me.
[01:48:43.424 --> 01:48:47.407]  I mean, before people were even calling them chemtrails, people were talking about this.
[01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:49.506]  Well, yeah.
[01:48:49.506 --> 01:48:53.367]  The evidence has been there, as you said, for at least 15 years.
[01:48:53.367 --> 01:48:58.629]  And it's just amazing to me how so many of my associates never noticed.
[01:48:58.629 --> 01:49:07.331]  I mean, the sky is covered with these crisscrossing trails, horizon to horizon, and by mid-afternoon, it's milky gray, and it's coming down.
[01:49:07.331 --> 01:49:10.152]  You can see sometimes it just sort of streaks down.
[01:49:10.152 --> 01:49:12.032]  You can feel it in your lungs.
[01:49:12.032 --> 01:49:13.633]  People are complaining about having
[01:49:14.273 --> 01:49:16.275]  Uh, congested lungs.
[01:49:16.275 --> 01:49:22.039]  People are getting analysis and finding these chemicals in their hair and their fingernails and their bloodstream.
[01:49:22.039 --> 01:49:24.602]  Chemicals at high levels that aren't supposed to be there.
[01:49:24.602 --> 01:49:26.663]  And I noticed all my friends look upset.
[01:49:26.663 --> 01:49:27.184]  Chemtrails?
[01:49:27.184 --> 01:49:27.964]  Chemtrails?
[01:49:27.964 --> 01:49:28.765]  What chemtrails?
[01:49:29.085 --> 01:49:31.206]  I mean, my gosh, it's just amazing.
[01:49:31.206 --> 01:49:33.387]  I guess it's a modern phenomenon.
[01:49:33.387 --> 01:49:34.527]  We live in big cities.
[01:49:34.527 --> 01:49:37.409]  We don't look up because normally you can't see the sky anyway.
[01:49:37.409 --> 01:49:39.770]  It's tall buildings everywhere you go.
[01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:43.291]  But it's amazing how people are in denial.
[01:49:43.291 --> 01:49:45.552]  They say, well, oh, yeah, I see those.
[01:49:45.552 --> 01:49:46.973]  There's something wrong with those.
[01:49:48.332 --> 01:49:48.833]  I don't know.
[01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:55.877]  I guess they never looked at the sky before, but I think what it is is that there's a tendency for people to believe authority.
[01:49:55.877 --> 01:49:59.540]  So if authority says it's nothing but contrails, then that's it.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:00.801]  That's the end of it.
[01:50:00.801 --> 01:50:05.764]  Or if authority doesn't bring it to their attention and say there's something wrong, then they say, well, there's nothing wrong.
[01:50:06.644 --> 01:50:15.450]  As you know, Alex, there's a big move now for prestigious scientific groups to try and convince people that these are nothing but contrails.
[01:50:15.450 --> 01:50:19.612]  Like, NASA has come out fairly recently on their website.
[01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:28.217]  You can go there, anybody, click on it, and it'll explain to you in detail how all of these streaks of smoke and everything, nothing but ice crystals.
[01:50:28.217 --> 01:50:34.001]  The reason that we're seeing more of it now than before, they say, is because there's more air traffic now than before.
[01:50:34.246 --> 01:50:41.008]  Let's talk about that when we come back and get into the aluminum and the soil and what that means to plants and what Monsanto is up to.
[01:50:41.008 --> 01:50:43.989]  The film covers with devastating accuracy.
[01:50:43.989 --> 01:50:51.231]  And then we'll show that next to the admissions of giving people syphilis in Guatemala.
[01:50:51.231 --> 01:50:53.491]  This is all part of a larger program.
[01:50:53.491 --> 01:50:55.072]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[01:50:55.072 --> 01:50:55.792]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:00.814 --> 01:51:02.114]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.114 --> 01:51:07.716]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.716 --> 01:51:12.738]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.738 --> 01:51:17.760]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:23.526]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.526 --> 01:51:30.654]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.654 --> 01:51:31.775]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.775 --> 01:51:38.122]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.442 --> 01:51:41.625]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.625 --> 01:51:43.848]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:44.989 --> 01:51:48.433]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.433 --> 01:51:50.194]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.385 --> 01:52:04.406]  Are you fed up with government of, by, and for the banksters and gangsters?

[01:52:54.306 --> 01:52:55.487]  My name is Crystal.
[01:52:55.487 --> 01:52:57.407]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:53:14.014 --> 01:53:17.977]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:53:17.977 --> 01:53:22.121]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:53:22.121 --> 01:53:22.961]  What did Crystal do?
[01:53:22.961 --> 01:53:26.924]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[01:53:26.924 --> 01:53:30.207]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula.

[01:54:09.306 --> 01:54:17.432]  We are back live with G. Edward Griffin and we have Michael J. Murphy.
[01:54:33.323 --> 01:54:44.693]  One of the other producers and directors is a journalist, political activist from the Los Angeles area, and he's put out this great film, What in the World Are They Spraying, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:44.693 --> 01:54:46.555]  It'll be premiering in Atlanta on the 22nd.
[01:54:46.555 --> 01:54:48.336]  G. Edward Griffin will be there.
[01:54:48.336 --> 01:54:51.939]  We'll give you a website coming up in the next hour so you can get tickets to that and attend that.
[01:54:51.939 --> 01:54:55.362]  Side issue, I'm speaking at the Coconut Grove in
[01:54:56.743 --> 01:54:58.825]  Santa Cruz on the 24th of October.
[01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:00.606]  It seats 800.
[01:55:00.606 --> 01:55:04.228]  They've sold almost 700 tickets with me plugging it twice.
[01:55:04.228 --> 01:55:05.389]  That's what I keep telling people.
[01:55:05.389 --> 01:55:09.051]  I don't do speaking events, folks, very often because I don't have the time.
[01:55:10.097 --> 01:55:21.080]  Though we can reach a lot of people, make local news, do all that, should I do five or six radio interviews a day and make films and reach tens of millions, or should I fly around giving speeches?
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:31.343]  But because I'm already out in California in a secret investigation, I'll just leave it at that, I'm gonna kill two birds with one stone, because the great folks out there at that station have done this.
[01:55:31.343 --> 01:55:34.223]  In fact, we'll put up their website on screen.
[01:55:34.223 --> 01:55:35.364]  And now I'm talking to MZ,
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:37.360]  I don't
[01:55:54.939 --> 01:56:03.490]  Just to show people the real power of this show and the real patriot movement, maybe we should have an event in DC in six months and have 500,000 there.
[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:07.675]  I mean, I don't think people understand, folks, the amount of people we're reaching.
[01:56:07.675 --> 01:56:11.900]  When I say we're reaching a million live on the show, over a million after when it rebroadcast,
[01:56:12.441 --> 01:56:16.563]  I mean, at current growth rates, it'll be 3 million a day in a couple of months.
[01:56:16.563 --> 01:56:17.803]  I'm not bragging.
[01:56:17.803 --> 01:56:21.945]  It's actually very daunting to have this responsibility on me.
[01:56:21.945 --> 01:56:25.447]  But shifting gears before we get back into the chemtrails, Joe McGriffin, you've talked about this.
[01:56:25.447 --> 01:56:30.469]  I mean, what's your breakdown of the level of the explosive awakening we're seeing?
[01:56:30.469 --> 01:56:32.970]  And the globalists are openly saying they want to start censoring the web now.
[01:56:33.837 --> 01:56:35.499]  Well, I think you've pretty well covered it.
[01:56:35.499 --> 01:56:36.760]  It is explosive.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.402]  It's exponential.
[01:56:38.402 --> 01:56:49.635]  And on this issue of geoengineering, or chemtrails, whatever you want to call it, it was already such a massive proportion that I didn't realize it.
[01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:53.999]  I thought, from my personal experience, that we have a hard
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.241]  Uh, rode a hoe there in the beginning, getting people interested in it.
[01:56:59.241 --> 01:57:07.184]  And I think, as I mentioned before, when I put it up on our little website, which doesn't have anywhere near the exposure as yours, I said, well, we're interested in doing a video.
[01:57:07.184 --> 01:57:08.364]  Anybody want to help us?
[01:57:08.364 --> 01:57:12.105]  Well, we were inundated with responses, immediate responses.
[01:57:12.105 --> 01:57:15.986]  I mean, within two days, we had this whole thing done from all over the world.
[01:57:15.986 --> 01:57:22.728]  People were, you know, contacting us from all of the, basically, the NATO countries where they have all the spraying going on.
[01:57:23.408 --> 01:57:29.373]  So yeah, it started off with such an explosion that I couldn't believe it, and it's gotten even more so.
[01:57:29.373 --> 01:57:33.456]  I got a phone call just before the show here from a fellow in Toronto.
[01:57:33.456 --> 01:57:34.817]  There's a bookstore there.
[01:57:34.817 --> 01:57:37.238]  He says, we want to do a screening.
[01:57:37.238 --> 01:57:38.099]  Is that okay?
[01:57:38.099 --> 01:57:40.121]  I said, okay, of course it's okay.
[01:57:40.121 --> 01:57:41.302]  We're delighted.
[01:57:41.302 --> 01:57:47.146]  And so people are just volunteering to do the kinds of things that in the past we used to have to promote, you know?
[01:57:47.754 --> 01:57:49.074]  We'd have to go out and say, will you do this?
[01:57:49.074 --> 01:57:49.675]  Will you do that?
[01:57:49.675 --> 01:57:50.635]  And we want to promote this.
[01:57:50.635 --> 01:57:53.876]  And now they're coming to us and saying, how can we help?
[01:57:53.876 --> 01:57:57.137]  So we've really touched a nerve here.
[01:57:57.137 --> 01:57:58.418]  And I think you're right, Alex.
[01:57:58.418 --> 01:58:10.542]  If you want to go on the road or put something to show just for the media purposes, just show the massiveness of this movement, I think it probably would work out exactly as you said.
[01:58:11.698 --> 01:58:13.078]  It's incredible.
[01:58:13.078 --> 01:58:19.420]  We're gonna come back and get into human experimentation just to show, you know, they don't care if aluminum hurts you.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:21.821]  They don't care.
[01:58:21.821 --> 01:58:23.181]  This is part of their larger plan.
[01:58:23.181 --> 01:58:26.622]  They call it killing more than two birds with one stone.
[01:58:26.622 --> 01:58:29.082]  Don't forget, we're making this search term number one today.
[01:58:29.082 --> 01:58:31.283]  You the listeners.
[01:58:31.283 --> 01:58:34.104]  And it is huge explosions.
[01:58:34.104 --> 01:58:38.445]  That will lead them to the new videos released by NIST of firefighters saying bombs in the buildings.
[01:58:43.296 --> 01:58:46.723]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.723 --> 01:58:48.948]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.906 --> 01:58:55.929]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.929 --> 01:58:59.172]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.172 --> 01:59:03.956]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:03.956 --> 01:59:10.361]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.361 --> 01:59:12.583]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.123 --> 01:59:13.423]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.423 --> 01:59:13.944]  Bernanke?
[01:59:13.944 --> 01:59:14.624]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.624 --> 01:59:15.885]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.885 --> 01:59:18.146]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.034 --> 01:59:34.155]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.155 --> 01:59:39.298]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.298 --> 01:59:53.686]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:56.067]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.067 --> 01:59:58.829]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.529 --> 02:00:10.354]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.354 --> 02:00:11.935]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.935 --> 02:00:13.497]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.497 --> 02:00:17.681]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.681 --> 02:00:21.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.778 --> 02:00:28.280]  Here's the headline from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:36.766]  Obama administration pressures ISP to censor websites because they haven't been able to pass their Cybersecurity Act where everything's wired through the federal government.
[02:00:36.766 --> 02:00:37.486]  It's already wired.
[02:00:37.486 --> 02:00:39.888]  They just want to be able to officially do it.
[02:00:39.888 --> 02:00:43.530]  We've got this article from Mainstream News, is what Paul Watson sources.
[02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:53.401]  And they say, we want to just be able, and in fact you saw Lieberman say this last year, he wants his office to be able to tell YouTube when to take something down.
[02:00:53.401 --> 02:00:57.986]  There's no judge, there's no jury, there's no free speech, everything's censored by Herr Lieberman.
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:06.642]  And, you know, that's the scary thing here, G. Edward Griffin, before we get back into chemtrails and your new film, is that we are exponentially growing.
[02:01:06.642 --> 02:01:07.563]  We're going to win.
[02:01:07.563 --> 02:01:10.163]  We can see the end of the finish line.
[02:01:10.163 --> 02:01:11.924]  We're actually ahead of the globalists.
[02:01:11.924 --> 02:01:16.745]  They're trying to come out in the open, intimidate us, tell us to shut up, make us think that they're invincible.
[02:01:16.745 --> 02:01:18.626]  You know, the Borg can't be stopped.
[02:01:18.626 --> 02:01:21.827]  You will be assimilated and resistance is futile.
[02:01:21.827 --> 02:01:28.469]  But they are really putting up trial balloons and promoting it in Europe as well to really start censoring people.
[02:01:30.376 --> 02:01:31.677]  There's no question about that.
[02:01:31.677 --> 02:01:34.859]  They've been talking about that for decades, haven't they?
[02:01:34.859 --> 02:01:38.482]  I remember when the Internet first became a reality.
[02:01:38.482 --> 02:01:44.246]  A lot of my friends, some of whom are pretty well known, would say, don't worry about it.
[02:01:44.246 --> 02:01:47.329]  We've won because they can't censor the Internet.
[02:01:47.329 --> 02:01:48.750]  It's just physically impossible.
[02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:49.871]  I said, are you kidding?
[02:01:49.871 --> 02:01:51.272]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:01:51.272 --> 02:01:55.215]  These guys run the governments of the world and they have the police power.
[02:01:55.215 --> 02:01:56.656]  They can intervene in some way.
[02:01:57.216 --> 02:01:58.037]  Oh, you're wrong, Ed.
[02:01:58.037 --> 02:01:59.298]  The Internet is different.
[02:01:59.298 --> 02:02:10.826]  Well, anyway, we've seen it all change, and now, yeah, they've got the technology, they can throw the switches, they can pass the laws and make anybody that doesn't comply guilty of some kind of a heinous crime, and away they go.
[02:02:10.826 --> 02:02:13.328]  But that's the bad side.
[02:02:13.328 --> 02:02:19.873]  The good side is that the movement of awareness that we're discussing is growing in exponential fashion.
[02:02:19.873 --> 02:02:26.078]  And there comes a point, I don't know where it is, but there's a tipping point where they just can't get away with it anymore without some kind of
[02:02:27.098 --> 02:02:31.861]  Massive negative reaction that shows up in the political arena.
[02:02:31.861 --> 02:02:51.010]  That's why they're, you know, planning to, I think they're planning to have some kind of a major crisis event, so as to distract from all that and regain that momentum in favor of, let's have more security, let's, you know, have more police action here to protect us from this dreaded enemy.
[02:02:51.010 --> 02:02:55.372]  Could be a terrorist attack, it could be a biological attack, I don't even know what they
[02:02:56.772 --> 02:03:00.454]  Global warming, global economic collapse, global poverty.
[02:03:00.454 --> 02:03:02.135]  They've always got a solution.
[02:03:02.135 --> 02:03:09.760]  Give the central banking families and the royalty the power to set up a private world government that sets all the rules and levies taxes.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.701]  Yeah, and that's all for our good, you see.
[02:03:11.701 --> 02:03:13.182]  Just like this global warming theme.
[02:03:13.642 --> 02:03:18.706]  They're not doing that to control the population or to make money or increase their political power.
[02:03:18.706 --> 02:03:19.807]  They're doing it for us.
[02:03:19.807 --> 02:03:25.652]  They're doing it to save us, to save our planet, to improve crops and all of that nonsense that they dream up.
[02:03:25.652 --> 02:03:29.895]  And unfortunately, many people believe it because they want to believe it, you know?
[02:03:29.895 --> 02:03:31.917]  They're in love with authority.
[02:03:31.917 --> 02:03:33.178]  They're in love with licking boots.
[02:03:35.131 --> 02:03:36.552]  I guess they don't feel good about themselves.
[02:03:36.552 --> 02:03:50.085]  Briefly, before we go to break and get back into the chemtrails and human experimentation and your discoveries on aluminum and the patents and all the rest of it with this aerosol program that's now starting to come out of the shadows into the open because we've been exposing it.
[02:03:50.085 --> 02:03:57.912]  But briefly, dealing with 9-11, we've seen all these new terror alerts ahead of the election.
[02:03:57.912 --> 02:03:59.614]  Are you concerned about false flag events?
[02:04:00.259 --> 02:04:12.622]  I'm very concerned about that, Alex, because, you know, anybody that's been following this movement for any amount of time knows that that's one of the most powerful cards they have up their sleeve.
[02:04:12.622 --> 02:04:19.924]  It used to be that when totalitarian leaders were getting in trouble and losing support at home, they would start a war.
[02:04:19.924 --> 02:04:25.706]  That was the traditional time-tested method of bringing the population back under the control of the ruler.
[02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:28.828]  Well now, it's a little refinement on that.
[02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:36.635]  It's not just a war, but it's a war that's triggered by some kind of a false flag event so that the people are angry.
[02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:40.018]  They think, we've been attacked, we've been injured, you know, we've been insulted.
[02:04:40.018 --> 02:04:42.741]  We can't stand by and just let this happen.
[02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:45.864]  Now let us get behind our glorious leader and fight back.
[02:04:47.168 --> 02:04:48.891]  His name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:04:48.891 --> 02:04:51.276]  He is the producer of What in the World Are They Spraying?
[02:04:51.276 --> 02:04:54.321]  It starts shipping on or right after October 22nd.

[02:05:03.772 --> 02:05:07.556]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:05:07.556 --> 02:05:10.439]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:05:10.439 --> 02:05:15.824]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:06.062]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.062 --> 02:06:09.725]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.725 --> 02:06:12.227]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.227 --> 02:06:18.092]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.092 --> 02:06:24.357]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.757 --> 02:06:30.743]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.743 --> 02:06:34.906]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.906 --> 02:06:39.210]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:45.155]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.155 --> 02:06:48.718]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.718 --> 02:06:50.700]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:51.141]  It's here.

[02:07:00.441 --> 02:07:04.643]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:07:04.643 --> 02:07:11.047]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:11.047 --> 02:07:18.431]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:18.431 --> 02:07:23.314]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:07:31.963 --> 02:07:35.688]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:42.977]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:07:42.977 --> 02:07:46.879]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:07:46.879 --> 02:07:54.301]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.

[02:08:01.092 --> 02:08:12.725]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.725 --> 02:08:21.254]  Okay, for the next 45 minutes or so, I need to do the last segment on a news blitz, because there's just so much I haven't gotten to, but this is a big issue.
[02:08:21.254 --> 02:08:21.774]  A secret...
[02:08:22.697 --> 02:08:24.820]  NATO country, it's in all the NATO countries.
[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:27.925]  It isn't in other countries that aren't NATO controlled, we've noticed.
[02:08:27.925 --> 02:08:29.948]  The Anglo-American establishment nations.
[02:08:29.948 --> 02:08:32.872]  Huge aerosol spraying weather modification program.
[02:08:32.872 --> 02:08:33.994]  But that's only one part of it.
[02:08:33.994 --> 02:08:36.537]  And now, they're coming out with more and more of it.
[02:08:36.537 --> 02:08:38.600]  In fact, did you guys find Aaron's big blue folder?
[02:08:39.161 --> 02:08:39.541]  We're good to go.
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.980]  That's right, with the GMO, Steve.
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:06.401]  But Paul Winterberger, as well as involved with the film, we brought him onto the project, and he did a great job.
[02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:06.961]  But essentially, our
[02:09:27.248 --> 02:09:44.802]  Our investigation into these programs started at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Conference, where geoengineers proposed spraying 10 to 20 million tons of toxic aluminum into the sky for what they call the stated goal to cool the planet.
[02:09:44.802 --> 02:09:48.825]  So after that meeting, when they're literally coming out
[02:09:49.369 --> 02:09:58.417]  Publicly addressing this issue and essentially selling it to the public in denial that these programs have been already implemented.
[02:09:58.417 --> 02:10:01.159]  But what they're saying is that they're looking at these.
[02:10:01.159 --> 02:10:11.849]  However, we went around literally over to Europe, over to several different states here in America, and we researched tasks which revealed
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:22.523]  Extremely high levels of aluminum, barium, strontium, the areas where they've been finding these tests in the rain, snow, and soil.
[02:10:22.523 --> 02:10:36.188]  They've also been finding major declines in the forest and in the crops that are producing because, as the scientists that we spoke to, aluminum, barium, and strontium will increase the pH of soil.
[02:10:36.188 --> 02:10:42.070]  So, for instance, in Northern California, they have seen, at a bare minimum, 10 times
[02:10:42.748 --> 02:10:53.257]  The increase in the alkalinity in their soils, and the scientists up there believe that this is a direct result of the spraying of aluminum barium and strontium.
[02:10:53.257 --> 02:11:05.907]  What a lot of people believe these programs are in part, obviously, is a multi-agenda operation, but they believe, speaking about this new GMO seed, that it could be an attempt to kill off
[02:11:06.736 --> 02:11:19.490]  Anything that's natural and organic because there is a new GMO aluminum resistant seed that has been manufactured that will thrive in a high aluminum soil.
[02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:20.451]  Oh, don't worry!
[02:11:20.451 --> 02:11:28.699]  You know, all these major croplands have been poisoned and normal natural plants won't grow in it, but Monsanto's got a whole new
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:37.842]  Seedline, corn, wheat, whatever it is, canola, soybeans, it's all being developed, it's all being patented.
[02:11:37.842 --> 02:11:40.802]  We've got stuff that'll grow and nothing else will.
[02:11:40.802 --> 02:11:44.723]  Oh, you notice your trees all over Central Texas are dying.
[02:11:44.723 --> 02:11:52.704]  Oh, on the California coast they're dying and arborists and plant experts are testing it and saying it's aluminum and they're dying in Hawaii.
[02:11:52.704 --> 02:11:55.805]  But don't worry, Monsanto's not just developing
[02:11:56.565 --> 02:11:58.365]  Major food crops now.
[02:11:58.365 --> 02:12:00.586]  They're coming out with GMO palm trees.
[02:12:00.586 --> 02:12:03.046]  They're going to come out with the tea tree oil.
[02:12:03.046 --> 02:12:05.087]  They've got it all for you.
[02:12:05.087 --> 02:12:07.587]  Isn't that sweet of them?
[02:12:07.587 --> 02:12:08.408]  Very true.
[02:12:08.408 --> 02:12:10.988]  And that's a concern for many of us.
[02:12:10.988 --> 02:12:14.869]  And we also filmed for a week on a remote part of the island in Maui, Hawaii.
[02:12:14.869 --> 02:12:17.010]  And I know that you saw the film, Alex.
[02:12:17.010 --> 02:12:22.971]  But for a week, Paul and I stayed on this little organic farm and we ate off of the land.
[02:12:22.971 --> 02:12:23.671]  You know, we'd go out
[02:12:24.514 --> 02:12:29.178]  Oh, well, S510 would end that, because you're not allowed to even grow and eat your own food under that.
[02:12:46.565 --> 02:12:48.787]  And that's just one part of it.
[02:12:48.787 --> 02:12:53.430]  Yeah, and that's very scary to many of us who are aware of that.
[02:12:53.430 --> 02:13:00.656]  But they're concerned that not only with the new legislation, this might be an attempt to just peel off anything that's on their land.
[02:13:00.656 --> 02:13:06.100]  And, you know, I couldn't help but to look forward and say, what is this going to be like in 10 years?
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:11.024]  Are the people that live here going to have to go to a corporation for a corporate seat?
[02:13:11.024 --> 02:13:12.485]  And what are the requirements for that?
[02:13:13.206 --> 02:13:14.387]  Will they have to get licensed?
[02:13:14.387 --> 02:13:16.529]  Will they have to pass certain exams?
[02:13:16.529 --> 02:13:17.549]  What will be the taxes on that?
[02:13:17.549 --> 02:13:22.873]  And we know the honeybees are dying all over the Western world and NATO countries mainly.
[02:13:22.873 --> 02:13:24.735]  We know that a lot of crops are having trouble.
[02:13:24.735 --> 02:13:33.942]  You guys interviewed scientists and others who would go into streams and, you know, talk about how just 10 years ago it was full of, you know, all sorts of life, but now it's dead.
[02:13:33.942 --> 02:13:35.843]  And what do they find?
[02:13:35.843 --> 02:13:36.924]  Loving aluminum.
[02:13:39.008 --> 02:13:41.329]  Yes, in major quantities.
[02:13:41.329 --> 02:13:46.692]  And, you know, I'd like to bring to light a test which was taken on Mount Shasta.
[02:13:46.692 --> 02:13:56.056]  And at the baseline, about seven years ago, they took a snow test and it revealed seven parts per billion aluminum, also barium and strontium at much lower levels.
[02:13:56.056 --> 02:14:01.859]  However, one year ago, Francis Mangels, who is a retired USDA biologist, took another test
[02:14:02.822 --> 02:14:06.066]  And I just want to throw this out there.
[02:14:06.066 --> 02:14:09.450]  How high do you think that test was?
[02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:13.154]  It was 60 parts per billion or 60 times the safe level.
[02:14:13.154 --> 02:14:14.716]  60,000 I think.
[02:14:14.716 --> 02:14:18.360]  I already gave that away, Michael.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:22.145]  Excuse me, it wasn't 60?
[02:14:22.145 --> 02:14:22.846]  Give us those numbers.
[02:14:24.335 --> 02:14:25.697]  It was 61,100 parts per billion.
[02:14:25.697 --> 02:14:28.903]  That's over 61 times the safe level established for drinking water.
[02:14:38.516 --> 02:14:43.197]  And people are climbing that mountain and they're using the snow to hydrate.
[02:14:43.197 --> 02:14:52.138]  And by the way, you have a clip in the film of a local newscast in Washington State with the guy going, look, I was in the military.
[02:14:52.138 --> 02:14:57.699]  This is some kind of military spraying of aluminum here, not just chaff, more than that.
[02:14:57.699 --> 02:15:02.860]  And there you have the newscast in the very area where you're finding the aluminum in high levels.
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.941]  And you've got the newscaster saying, look at this.
[02:15:04.941 --> 02:15:06.461]  This is not a natural weather system.
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:18.523]  Exactly, and there are literally... This has been on the corporate mainstream media, just not at the level of attention that we believe that it deserves.
[02:15:18.523 --> 02:15:21.684]  It's been covered a little bit here, a little bit there.
[02:15:21.684 --> 02:15:23.704]  But, you know, something's so damaging.
[02:15:23.704 --> 02:15:35.207]  I mean, aluminum is so toxic to ecosystems, but also we interviewed a lot of physicians and healthcare professionals, and they said aluminum is extremely toxic to human health.
[02:15:35.207 --> 02:15:36.248]  And we've seen
[02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:39.353]  God, in the 10-year period in L.A.
[02:15:39.353 --> 02:15:47.306]  County, we've seen over a 200% increase in Alzheimer's, and at the same time, worldwide, we're seeing an incredible increase
[02:15:48.976 --> 02:16:10.393]  Well, we're now seeing early onset and even, you know, youth, people 25, 30, getting Alzheimer-like symptoms, and then we've had top brain scientists on, like Dr. Blaylock, Russell Blaylock, and they're just seeing it across the board, not just the tin cans we're drinking out of that are coated in bisphenol A that's bad enough.
[02:16:10.393 --> 02:16:11.134]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:16:12.515 --> 02:16:15.378]  I mean, this is so big and it's out in the open now.
[02:16:15.378 --> 02:16:17.480]  More and more it's coming out in the open.
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:24.967]  Give us your breakdown on all of this, G. Edward Griffin, and the discovery of Monsanto developing these aluminum-resistant seeds.
[02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:36.103]  Well, I certainly have to go along with the general observation that corporations like Monsanto, they're certainly not the only ones in the field.
[02:16:36.103 --> 02:16:43.946]  They have buildings full of scientists and marketing experts who are looking for ways to make money using
[02:16:44.586 --> 02:16:46.287]  Well, they admit they are!
[02:17:03.844 --> 02:17:16.593]  I do say, however, that we have to be a little cautious when we talk about this, because these people are not dumb, and the information they reveal, even in their patents, may not be trustworthy.
[02:17:16.593 --> 02:17:24.500]  Because, for example, I don't want to get too deeply into this, but just to give you an idea of the pitfalls and the minefields that are out there for us.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:38.381]  I've been talking with a biochemist recently that said, well, the kind of aluminum that is in the patent that we're talking about is an aluminum which, believe it or not, is considered to be acidic.
[02:17:39.002 --> 02:17:51.068]  It's been, depending on the molecular form of it, there is a form of aluminum that is acidic, at least it's more acidic than other forms, which are clearly in the alkaline range.
[02:17:51.068 --> 02:18:02.934]  And he said that if they sprayed that on the soil, it would have the effect of actually preserving the acidic quality of the soil, rather than making it alkaline.
[02:18:03.734 --> 02:18:04.515]  How can that be?
[02:18:04.515 --> 02:18:05.596]  Well, he explained it to me.
[02:18:05.596 --> 02:18:06.296]  He convinced me.
[02:18:06.296 --> 02:18:07.057]  He's a scientist.
[02:18:07.057 --> 02:18:08.758]  He's a, you know, he's a Ph.D.
[02:18:08.758 --> 02:18:09.178]  guy.
[02:18:09.178 --> 02:18:11.019]  This has been his life's work.
[02:18:11.019 --> 02:18:16.343]  And I said, oh, I see, because of the cations or the little electron connections.
[02:18:16.343 --> 02:18:18.885]  It measures as borosidic.
[02:18:18.885 --> 02:18:19.325]  That's right.
[02:18:19.865 --> 02:18:26.529]  So, we both concluded that, well, that means that what they're spraying may not be what they patented for.
[02:18:26.529 --> 02:18:27.350]  It may be something else.
[02:18:27.350 --> 02:18:28.110]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:29.151]  There's hundreds of patents.
[02:18:29.151 --> 02:18:31.633]  Vic, I'll show listeners this right here.
[02:18:31.633 --> 02:18:35.695]  This is just one of the folders of our research for Arkem Drill Film.
[02:18:35.695 --> 02:18:39.218]  And we know it's a whole bunch of different programs and operations.
[02:18:39.218 --> 02:18:42.219]  But here's the $64 million question to both of you.
[02:18:42.219 --> 02:18:44.481]  What type of aluminum do they find on Mount Shasta?
[02:18:45.435 --> 02:18:48.620]  Well, they didn't test for any specific type of aluminum.
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:19:01.438]  However, getting back to the patent, I've spoken to a lot of scientists as well, and the concern, while everything that Ed says is truly correct, aluminum can easily be activated because it's very complex.
[02:19:02.210 --> 02:19:03.692]  No, I don't think so.
[02:19:18.021 --> 02:19:19.582]  Yeah, let's do anything.
[02:19:19.582 --> 02:19:20.783]  We just have to be careful.
[02:19:20.783 --> 02:19:30.308]  And I might add, just to finish this out, that this fellow I was talking to said, well, there's another aspect of this that has nothing to do with pH.
[02:19:30.308 --> 02:19:30.889]  I said, what?
[02:19:30.889 --> 02:19:32.289]  Wow, what could that be?
[02:19:32.289 --> 02:19:39.554]  He said, well, all forms of aluminum tend to inhibit the ability of a plant to uptake moisture.
[02:19:40.521 --> 02:19:43.742]  So maybe we're looking at the wrong thing at this pH level.
[02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:47.903]  Any form of aluminum will inhibit the plant's ability to uptake moisture.
[02:19:47.903 --> 02:19:57.246]  And that's the reason that these seeds have to be genetically modified to deal with the moisture question, not necessarily the pH question.
[02:19:57.246 --> 02:19:58.066]  So it gets complicated.
[02:19:58.226 --> 02:20:00.268]  Look, regardless, they've covered up the program.
[02:20:00.268 --> 02:20:01.250]  We know the program's real.
[02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:02.291]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.291 --> 02:20:07.898]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:07.898 --> 02:20:12.904]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:12.904 --> 02:20:13.384]  It's true.
[02:20:13.384 --> 02:20:16.207]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:20:16.207 --> 02:20:17.950]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:23.694]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:23.694 --> 02:20:25.995]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:20:25.995 --> 02:20:30.798]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:30.798 --> 02:20:31.919]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:31.919 --> 02:20:35.001]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:38.624]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.624 --> 02:20:41.806]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:41.806 --> 02:20:44.027]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:44.027 --> 02:20:44.948]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:51.554]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:51.554 --> 02:20:57.662]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:57.662 --> 02:21:00.045]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:05.006 --> 02:21:06.247]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:06.247 --> 02:21:09.809]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:09.809 --> 02:21:12.591]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.591 --> 02:21:18.295]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.295 --> 02:21:24.960]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:30.944]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:30.944 --> 02:21:34.647]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.107 --> 02:21:39.389]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:39.389 --> 02:21:45.330]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:48.892]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:48.892 --> 02:21:50.872]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:50.872 --> 02:21:51.993]  It's here.

[02:21:59.733 --> 02:22:06.415]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.415 --> 02:22:14.517]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:14.517 --> 02:22:22.359]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:22.699 --> 02:22:27.785]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:27.785 --> 02:22:33.011]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:37.356]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:37.356 --> 02:22:38.457]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:23:00.547 --> 02:23:02.308]  What is a wind generator?
[02:23:02.308 --> 02:23:04.688]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:23:04.688 --> 02:23:08.049]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:23:08.049 --> 02:23:10.010]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?
[02:23:10.728 --> 02:23:14.610]  For answers to questions about wind power, visit windbluepower.com.
[02:23:14.610 --> 02:23:17.652]  Did you know the wind can provide your family with emergency power?

[02:23:40.006 --> 02:23:41.107]  Okay, Michael, Woody, Mark,
[02:24:11.257 --> 02:24:14.257]  Wesley and others, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:15.236 --> 02:24:20.660]  We have Michael J. Murphy, one of the producers and directors of What in the World Are They Spraying, the powerful new film.
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:23.021]  We have the interview we did in person with J.E.B.
[02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:30.426]  Griffin last week, mixed into a new trailer up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for What in the World Are They Spraying.
[02:24:30.426 --> 02:24:33.128]  We premiered that earlier in the last hour.
[02:24:33.128 --> 02:24:34.709]  Here's this giant folder I've got.
[02:24:34.709 --> 02:24:36.550]  While they're talking, I'm going to be flipping through it.
[02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:44.916]  We've got a giant section on patents, including something I've never seen anybody cover, for mixing aluminum dioxide and things with jet fuel to disperse it.
[02:24:45.856 --> 02:24:47.877]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:24:47.877 --> 02:24:55.659]  And this is just one small folder, even though it's about four inches tall, of all of this garbage that's going on.
[02:24:55.659 --> 02:24:58.260]  And I think what Gia Berggriffin said is absolutely accurate.
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:00.680]  We don't know the larger operation.
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:06.642]  We just know that old-timers did test and said it's aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other things.
[02:25:06.642 --> 02:25:10.643]  And now they admit, oh, we want to do tests with this to spray from jets.
[02:25:11.283 --> 02:25:19.247]  I mean, it's exactly what the old-timers analyzed it to be, and we know there's a weather modification, an over-the-horizon radar use of this.
[02:25:19.247 --> 02:25:23.029]  I mean, there's a lot of things going on here, G. Eber-Griffin.
[02:25:23.029 --> 02:25:28.572]  Well, that's right, and it's enough to make your head spin, and sometimes I think that's
[02:25:29.893 --> 02:25:30.953]  Not to our advantage.
[02:25:30.953 --> 02:25:39.256]  We cover too much and people get in overload and they tend to just drop away because they can't hold it all up there the first time around.
[02:25:39.256 --> 02:25:48.138]  But I think the bottom line and the thing to keep really focused on is that the evidence is now overwhelming that they are dumping toxic stuff on us.
[02:25:48.138 --> 02:25:54.240]  They're spraying toxic stuff on us, supposedly for our own good and to make matters worse,
[02:25:55.171 --> 02:25:56.653]  They're lying about it.
[02:25:56.653 --> 02:26:02.980]  That's all we really need to know before... We ought to be energized into action with that information.
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:07.346]  Whether we understand all of the rest of this is, you know, it's almost secondary.
[02:26:07.346 --> 02:26:11.831]  They're spraying us, they're killing us, they're making us sick, and they're lying to us about it.
[02:26:12.179 --> 02:26:12.579]  That's right.
[02:26:12.579 --> 02:26:19.006]  I remember about five years ago, a caller called the show, because you don't know the term to search for.
[02:26:19.006 --> 02:26:23.310]  We had a lot of government documents about weather modification and chemtrailing, but nothing.
[02:26:23.310 --> 02:26:24.672]  We have like a thousand times now.
[02:26:24.672 --> 02:26:26.774]  I mean, I'm buried in it to my neck.
[02:26:26.774 --> 02:26:31.239]  And the caller said, Alex, search indirect and semi-direct aerosol campaign.
[02:26:31.239 --> 02:26:33.881]  Indirect and semi-direct aerosol campaign.
[02:26:34.722 --> 02:26:35.863]  And you'll find it all.
[02:26:35.863 --> 02:27:01.082]  And I magically put it into Google, and it was tens of thousands of governments, universities, Department of Energy, and it was just a sea, bigger than the Manhattan Project, literally, of just wild testing of everything you could imagine going on, aluminum being one small part of it, but something that keeps rearing its ugly head.
[02:27:01.082 --> 02:27:04.165]  But your comments on that, G. Edward and Mr. Murphy?
[02:27:05.339 --> 02:27:06.680]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:08.241]  Well, you know, I can address that.
[02:27:08.241 --> 02:27:17.228]  While we believe these are spraying much more than simply the aluminum, barium, and strontium, we just focused on what's being found, which is scary enough.
[02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:27.876]  And I'm going to go back to the ecological problems that they're seeing around the world, and then the health problems, of course, that have seen a major increase.
[02:27:27.876 --> 02:27:29.277]  With just addressing that,
[02:27:29.858 --> 02:27:32.580]  You know, and we are just scratching the surface with the film.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:37.504]  We're hoping that other people might address this and question it and look into it more deeply.
[02:27:37.504 --> 02:27:39.425]  Oh, you more than scratch the surface.
[02:27:39.425 --> 02:27:41.647]  You show they admit they've been doing testing.
[02:27:41.647 --> 02:27:48.792]  Now they're proposing it publicly and then denying they're even doing testing when you put them on the hot seat.
[02:27:48.792 --> 02:27:52.395]  Well, they absolutely are emphatically denying this.
[02:27:52.395 --> 02:27:58.199]  Stuart Howe, Jeremy Rothschild and myself were at the AAAS meeting and we confronted them.
[02:27:59.131 --> 02:27:59.431]  I think so.
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:16.980]  Well,
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:42.944]  No, no, and if somebody took from what I was saying that this film was only scratching the surface, this film is extremely deep and covers a whole bunch of key subjects.
[02:28:42.944 --> 02:28:44.385]  That's the point I was making.
[02:28:44.385 --> 02:28:45.805]  I'm drowning in it.
[02:28:45.805 --> 02:28:51.548]  I've been trying to make one for two years and it's just so much evidence and so many different programs.
[02:28:51.548 --> 02:28:54.669]  I don't know where to start, so I salute you guys getting this film out so quickly.
[02:28:56.328 --> 02:29:02.430]  Well, one of our decisions we had to make right up front is, you know, how many issues or sub-issues do we cover?
[02:29:02.430 --> 02:29:09.392]  And I kind of looked at each other and said, man, we'll never get it done if we try and cover every aspect of it.
[02:29:09.392 --> 02:29:14.274]  So that was a decision just to focus on the spraying part and the toxicity part.
[02:29:15.277 --> 02:29:23.004]  And you know a moment ago when I said they're lying to us about it, that's a pretty strong statement and I don't make statements like that unless I'm prepared to back it up.
[02:29:23.004 --> 02:29:32.431]  And the two areas in which they're lying to us, one is that they deny that this is underway and the other area is that they deny that they know anything about toxicity.
[02:29:32.431 --> 02:29:37.175]  On the film you see one of these scientists say, well we don't know if it's toxic, we haven't looked into that yet.
[02:29:37.175 --> 02:29:42.800]  And now we have the papers right on the internet that show that they have looked into it and they found out it's terribly toxic.
[02:29:44.241 --> 02:29:45.682]  Let's expand on that after the break.
[02:29:45.682 --> 02:29:51.207]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:51.207 --> 02:29:52.608]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.608 --> 02:29:55.131]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.131 --> 02:29:57.813]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.701 --> 02:30:17.176]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:30:17.176 --> 02:30:20.860]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:21.877 --> 02:30:34.621]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:30:34.621 --> 02:30:41.883]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:30:42.583 --> 02:30:52.946]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:30:52.946 --> 02:30:56.888]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:30:56.888 --> 02:30:59.989]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:31:00.569 --> 02:31:05.110]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:06.030]  Number one.
[02:31:06.030 --> 02:31:09.451]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.451 --> 02:31:10.311]  Number two.
[02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:15.193]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.193 --> 02:31:15.933]  It's true.
[02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:20.814]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.814 --> 02:31:21.634]  Number three.
[02:31:21.634 --> 02:31:25.215]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.215 --> 02:31:28.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.136 --> 02:31:29.916]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.916 --> 02:31:32.677]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.677 --> 02:31:36.359]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.359 --> 02:31:37.159]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.159 --> 02:31:41.301]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.301 --> 02:31:46.363]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:50.524]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.524 --> 02:31:52.325]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.325 --> 02:31:56.927]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:31:57.227 --> 02:32:00.270]  877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:03.413]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:32:03.413 --> 02:32:07.217]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:32:07.217 --> 02:32:10.100]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:15.005]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:15.465 --> 02:32:21.407]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[02:33:03.622 --> 02:33:08.584]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:08.584 --> 02:33:10.324]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.324 --> 02:33:20.247]  Well we're definitely going to have to have these guys back up in the near future to do another hour or two just to take calls and cover more of the
[02:33:22.179 --> 02:33:25.160]  Seminal, groundbreaking film.
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:26.400]  What in the world are they spraying?
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:32.302]  And again, it's available at Infowars.com or you can call toll-free to get it.
[02:33:32.302 --> 02:33:33.962]  888-253-3139.
[02:33:33.962 --> 02:33:48.946]  When the film starts shipping and when it premieres, you can go to Atlanta, Georgia and the website is AtlantaPremier.com to get tickets to hear G. Ever Griffin speak and to see the film premiere on the 22nd of this month coming up.
[02:33:50.177 --> 02:33:53.338]  I'm sorry to interrupt, it's actually the 23rd.
[02:33:53.338 --> 02:33:54.718]  Oh, I apologize.
[02:33:54.718 --> 02:33:55.659]  No problem.
[02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:56.019]  Okay, the 23rd.
[02:33:56.019 --> 02:33:58.720]  Well, they'll find out at AtlantaPremier.com.
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:01.961]  Now, gentlemen, continuing here, Gieber, you got cut off by the break.
[02:34:01.961 --> 02:34:09.183]  You were getting into how they're lying, how they're trying to cover it up, and then you find the very scientist-owned papers, and I'm showing a counsel...
[02:34:10.263 --> 02:34:23.834]  On foreign relations paper that they put out three years ago, where they just came right out and admitted geoengineering workshop on unilateral planetary scale geoengineering.
[02:34:23.834 --> 02:34:25.555]  And oh, guess what?
[02:34:25.555 --> 02:34:32.801]  They talk, all these government heads talk about chemtrailing, spraying the atmosphere with aluminum dioxide.
[02:34:32.801 --> 02:34:34.222]  So, G. Ebert, please continue.
[02:34:34.605 --> 02:34:41.130]  Yeah, I think it bears repeating, Alex, because I've said that these people are lying, and that's a very strong statement.
[02:34:41.130 --> 02:34:45.194]  I wouldn't say that unless it was easy to prove.
[02:34:45.194 --> 02:34:46.655]  They're lying at two levels.
[02:34:46.655 --> 02:34:50.338]  First of all, they say that the spraying activity is not going on.
[02:34:50.338 --> 02:34:52.139]  They're just discussing it.
[02:34:52.139 --> 02:34:54.682]  And, well, we've got that nailed.
[02:34:54.682 --> 02:34:55.342]  That's for sure.
[02:34:55.342 --> 02:34:58.465]  It's been going on for at least 10 years and longer.
[02:34:59.292 --> 02:35:07.175]  But now, to me, more important than that is that they say, well, they don't know whether this stuff is going to be harmful to health or not.
[02:35:07.175 --> 02:35:09.915]  We haven't looked into that yet, but we certainly must do that.
[02:35:09.915 --> 02:35:15.177]  We won't start this spring, you understand, until we've checked that out and made sure that, you know, it's okay.
[02:35:15.177 --> 02:35:27.741]  And now we find out that there are documents all over the place, and you can even get them on the internet, documents showing research studies put out by the military, for one thing, where they've checked into the toxic effects of these compounds.
[02:35:28.141 --> 02:35:30.342]  Well, there's a major parallel, and I want both of you to speak to this, Mr. Murphy first.
[02:35:57.369 --> 02:36:13.235]  The parallel is, 20 years ago, or 19 years, gotta be technical, the Army's own report said depleted uranium is deadly, we can't use it in regular combat because it will increase cancers, organ failure, it's deadly.
[02:36:14.261 --> 02:36:16.802]  Then they went ahead and used it in 91.
[02:36:16.802 --> 02:36:20.064]  Now they're using it at shooting ranges and proving grounds everywhere.
[02:36:20.064 --> 02:36:26.427]  They're using it in wars in Serbia and in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Iraq.
[02:36:26.427 --> 02:36:30.649]  And it's 15 times the birth defects and cancers in children in Iraq.
[02:36:30.649 --> 02:36:33.491]  In the cities where it's used, that's the British Medical Journal.
[02:36:33.491 --> 02:36:36.672]  It's three to four times deformities and cancers in troops.
[02:36:36.672 --> 02:36:40.994]  They know this and they just have made the decision, we're going to use this and put it out everywhere.
[02:36:40.994 --> 02:36:41.395]  And it goes to
[02:36:42.395 --> 02:36:48.638]  Not just Tuskegee, but now, oh, we're sorry we shot up men, women, and children with syphilis by the thousands in Guatemala.
[02:36:48.638 --> 02:36:51.500]  That came out late last week.
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:37:01.866]  And this really goes to the point of they put out video games for kids, like Super Mega Worm, where you go around as a worm ridding the earth of humans, killing women with baby carriages and police.
[02:37:01.866 --> 02:37:03.507]  They have Al Gore.
[02:37:04.813 --> 02:37:04.893]  I'm
[02:37:21.465 --> 02:37:22.406]  Pay us carbon money.
[02:37:22.406 --> 02:37:23.486]  We're coming for you.
[02:37:23.486 --> 02:37:30.050]  It's an excuse for mass murder, an excuse for death, and these people are spraying their own families with the aluminum.
[02:37:30.050 --> 02:37:38.035]  They're using the DU, and really they are just psychopathic people with a death wish who want to kill all humans when you really read what they have to say.
[02:37:38.035 --> 02:37:40.817]  G. Edward Griffin, I want to get your take on that and Mr. Murphy.
[02:37:41.531 --> 02:37:44.073]  Well, I'll start the ball rolling on that.
[02:37:44.073 --> 02:37:45.193]  I'm sure you're right, Alex.
[02:37:45.193 --> 02:37:59.382]  There are a lot of psychopaths out there that really hate the human race and that they've been so indoctrinated, I suppose, that they feel that all of the problems in the world, especially the ecological problems, are a result of that ugly species called Homo sapiens.
[02:38:00.362 --> 02:38:06.004]  They kind of think of themselves as being god-like and not really homo sapiens themselves.
[02:38:06.004 --> 02:38:07.124]  They're sort of above it all.
[02:38:07.124 --> 02:38:14.287]  Yeah, there are a few people that really want to see the elimination of the human race, or greatly reduced at any rate.
[02:38:14.287 --> 02:38:24.930]  But I think a lot more people fit into a different category, which is that they're part of this collectivist system and they're imbued with this desire to follow authority no matter what.
[02:38:25.610 --> 02:38:27.151]  And they're part of a system.
[02:38:27.151 --> 02:38:29.393]  And especially you find this in the military.
[02:38:29.393 --> 02:38:30.294]  You just follow orders.
[02:38:30.294 --> 02:38:31.094]  You don't question.
[02:38:31.094 --> 02:38:34.277]  And they feel like they have power through the system.
[02:38:34.277 --> 02:38:35.318]  Through the system, yes.
[02:38:35.318 --> 02:38:39.301]  But their power derives from the fact that they don't question.
[02:38:39.301 --> 02:38:42.403]  And so I think there are a lot more people in that category.
[02:38:42.403 --> 02:38:45.205]  They're given an order or they see that they're part of a movement.
[02:38:45.205 --> 02:38:45.986]  They don't question it.
[02:38:45.986 --> 02:38:47.627]  They just go along with it.
[02:38:47.627 --> 02:38:53.031]  And maybe in the deep recesses of their minds, they may think, gee, I wonder if this is good for humanity.
[02:38:53.371 --> 02:39:01.398]  I wonder if it's good for me or my family, but they don't think about that too much because they know that the world which supports them doesn't allow that kind of thinking.
[02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:09.846]  So, I think it's that element more than this conscious desire to get rid of the human race.
[02:39:09.846 --> 02:39:12.028]  Michael, your take on that?
[02:39:12.028 --> 02:39:14.110]  You know, I definitely agree with that.
[02:39:14.110 --> 02:39:19.635]  One thing, you know, we're reaching out to the people who are flying these planes, who are involved with these programs.
[02:39:20.817 --> 02:39:24.381]  I believe that a lot of these people do not know exactly what they're doing.
[02:39:24.381 --> 02:39:29.286]  So we're hoping to awaken some of those people and really question things.
[02:39:29.286 --> 02:39:35.633]  You know, with that being said, you know, if you look at the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and their eugenics policies,
[02:39:36.252 --> 02:39:40.936]  You know, there clearly is an agenda to reduce the earth's population.
[02:39:40.936 --> 02:39:45.440]  I forgot to say Bill Gates, who is a heavy funder in the geoengineering program.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:46.201]  Oh, he's huge!
[02:39:46.201 --> 02:39:51.005]  He's got a bunch of patents for hurricane machines, chemtrailing.
[02:39:51.005 --> 02:39:53.367]  I mean, he's there.
[02:39:53.367 --> 02:39:54.107]  Absolutely.
[02:39:54.107 --> 02:39:58.311]  And, you know, he's funding David Keith and Ken Caldera.
[02:39:58.311 --> 02:40:00.813]  And we know, you know, what is behind this man.
[02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:10.035]  I think at the highest levels, yes, there are plans to definitely hurt and make people sick and to lower the population.
[02:40:10.035 --> 02:40:17.540]  However, I think that, again, a lot of people involved with these programs are really not aware of how damaging and how much damage they're doing.
[02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:27.346]  You know, we're hoping to reach out to the pilot so they might know that what they're doing is hurting their children, could be hurting their parents, you know?
[02:40:27.346 --> 02:40:31.569]  So that's really something that we're trying to do is reach out to everybody.
[02:40:32.796 --> 02:40:49.617]  Well, I just hope that everybody out there who's been laughed at for talking about persistent jet aerosol, known by laymen as chemtrail, and all of you that are concerned about this, will understand this is a professionally, well-balanced, focused, documented film.
[02:40:50.558 --> 02:40:52.300]  What in the world are they spraying?
[02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:59.787]  And it is the best film I've seen out there of many, because so much of this is now coming out in the open, and it's also great filmmakers, and G.E.B.R.
[02:40:59.787 --> 02:41:01.228]  Griffin behind it.
[02:41:01.228 --> 02:41:02.529]  People need to get this film.
[02:41:02.529 --> 02:41:05.712]  You need to show it to everyone you know.
[02:41:05.712 --> 02:41:07.334]  Guys, I'll put you on the spot here.
[02:41:07.334 --> 02:41:12.438]  You know, all of my films, I want people to air them on AXS TV, to make copies of them.
[02:41:12.438 --> 02:41:13.759]  I know you got a lot of producers and
[02:41:14.704 --> 02:41:33.184]  Filmmakers involved in this you have to get there okay for it, but I I mean Obviously if you tell the grassroots air this on access TV make copies give it to people obviously for nonprofit not for sell purposes Or you could lose control of your of your work But I mean you have any plan on that to really try to get people to have this film go viral
[02:41:33.652 --> 02:41:35.193]  Yes, Alex, I'll address that one.
[02:41:35.193 --> 02:41:43.996]  That was our plan from the very beginning, is to put this up on the internet and to have people make copies of it.
[02:41:43.996 --> 02:41:52.299]  Our only hope is that we can cover the production expenses and make enough return to make it worthwhile for the filmmakers.
[02:41:52.299 --> 02:41:55.960]  Paul and Michael, they're spending a lot, have spent a tremendous amount of time.
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:56.901]  I think so.
[02:42:19.524 --> 02:42:23.707]  Which is a little DVD that we produce over at the Reality Zone.
[02:42:23.707 --> 02:42:25.529]  That's our little company.
[02:42:25.529 --> 02:42:34.956]  And Project Red Pill is a DVD which has anywhere from five to six full length documentaries.
[02:42:34.956 --> 02:42:39.840]  It's not high resolution, it's the same resolution as you would find on the internet.
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:47.427]  But those are sold for under a dollar each, and we ask people to buy those and then make copies of those.
[02:42:47.427 --> 02:42:54.394]  In other words, we want tens of millions of copies of this thing to be put into circulation.
[02:42:54.394 --> 02:42:58.097]  It's the only way we can make an end run around the controlled media.
[02:42:58.527 --> 02:43:01.888]  Absolutely, and that's been the secret to our success.
[02:43:01.888 --> 02:43:03.728]  People didn't believe me that they'd signed U.N.
[02:43:03.728 --> 02:43:06.989]  agreements to hand over our national parks and areas to U.N.
[02:43:06.989 --> 02:43:14.071]  control, so I went out and interviewed people, showed the documents, went there, and really, we were some of the first in 96, 97.
[02:43:16.852 --> 02:43:28.605]  To really pioneer what so many others are now doing and that's great because they can't just kill an Alex Jones or a G. Edward Griffin or set us up or put us in prison because there's so many other people coming online.
[02:43:28.605 --> 02:43:31.327]  So many thousands of filmmakers and authors.
[02:43:31.327 --> 02:43:36.273]  It is a powerful, powerful, powerful thing.
[02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:38.014]  Let's take some phone calls.
[02:43:38.935 --> 02:43:42.177]  Let me see who is up first here.
[02:43:42.177 --> 02:43:43.278]  Michael in Florida.
[02:43:43.278 --> 02:43:47.820]  You're on the air with G. Edward Griffin and the other filmmaker Michael J. Murphy.
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:49.121]  Welcome.
[02:43:49.121 --> 02:43:50.082]  How you guys doing tonight?
[02:43:50.082 --> 02:43:51.523]  Good, Michael.
[02:43:51.523 --> 02:43:52.583]  Good.
[02:43:52.583 --> 02:44:02.189]  I got a question and forgive my ignorance on the way that our whole atmosphere works, but I just shot a very quick bit of chemtrail over my house in Central Florida.
[02:44:03.050 --> 02:44:08.875]  And it was very obvious that at the treetop level, the winds were blowing at about 20 miles an hour, 30 miles an hour.
[02:44:08.875 --> 02:44:10.797]  They were really swaying good.
[02:44:10.797 --> 02:44:14.200]  And then at about 3 or 4,000 feet, the clouds were moving.
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:16.482]  You could visibly see all the clouds moving in the sky.
[02:44:18.030 --> 02:44:25.554]  The Ken Trail that was above us was maybe 500, maybe 1,000 feet above the clouds, but it wasn't moving at all.
[02:44:25.554 --> 02:44:35.960]  Well, there's different weather strata, there's different prevailing winds, jet streams, and jet streams are pretty easy to forecast.
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:43.284]  One of the big jet streams coming out of China and across the western United States dumps between New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.
[02:44:43.664 --> 02:44:50.867]  So, so much of the toxic waste from China ends up dumping in here, and that could be some of the aluminum and toxins we're already seeing.
[02:44:50.867 --> 02:44:56.729]  But, I mean, specifically, you know, you're asking why, why was the chemtrail moving at a different rate?
[02:44:56.729 --> 02:45:00.551]  You can see weather systems where clouds are going this way and other clouds are going that way.
[02:45:00.551 --> 02:45:03.872]  That's normally a natural function.
[02:45:03.872 --> 02:45:06.253]  You want to comment on that, Jeh Eber-Griffin or Mr. Murphy?
[02:45:06.713 --> 02:45:13.265]  Well, yeah, just to confirm that there are wind currents at different elevations, and they often go in different directions.
[02:45:13.265 --> 02:45:19.276]  It's kind of like looking at a big bowl of water, if you dumped some
[02:45:20.999 --> 02:45:21.660]  We're good to go.
[02:45:37.418 --> 02:45:39.019]  And that's why the Pentagon's declassified.
[02:45:39.019 --> 02:45:46.066]  In the 60s, they were able to direct major weather systems and dump jet streams with water directly into flood people.
[02:45:46.066 --> 02:45:49.289]  And that's one of the most declassified areas that we've interviewed, of course.
[02:45:49.289 --> 02:45:51.331]  Ben Levinson, the father of weather weapons.
[02:45:51.331 --> 02:45:52.852]  That's going to be in our film.
[02:45:52.852 --> 02:45:56.235]  Let's go ahead and talk... May I make one more comment, Alex, on that?
[02:45:56.235 --> 02:45:59.698]  I think it's important to know that in Hawaii, for example,
[02:46:01.209 --> 02:46:17.024]  The people there, although they were being completely sprayed, very seldom did they see the planes because the planes apparently were flying off the edge of offshore and letting the chemtrails ride in with the wind currents.
[02:46:17.024 --> 02:46:17.225]  Yes.
[02:46:19.514 --> 02:46:20.375]  Yeah, that's another.
[02:46:20.375 --> 02:46:24.417]  They know where to spray to target something sometimes 5,000 miles away.
[02:46:24.417 --> 02:46:29.541]  Some people say, planes aren't spraying you at 20,000 feet, Mr. Jones, to hit you on the ground.
[02:46:29.541 --> 02:46:30.742]  It's going somewhere else.
[02:46:30.742 --> 02:46:31.722]  Exactly.
[02:46:31.722 --> 02:46:32.143]  That's right.
[02:46:32.143 --> 02:46:44.291]  Well, it was also interesting because it is kind of covert because you don't see the planes, but when we were there, we also spoke publicly about the issue and urged people to do rain tests
[02:46:44.795 --> 02:46:45.515]  Absolutely!
[02:46:45.515 --> 02:46:47.096]  Let's talk to Woody in Seattle.
[02:46:47.096 --> 02:46:48.016]  Woody, you're on the air.
[02:46:48.016 --> 02:46:49.757]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:46:49.757 --> 02:46:54.319]  I've been taking a lot of time and effort in researching chemtrails over the last two years.
[02:46:54.319 --> 02:46:55.079]  I've been retired
[02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:22.186]  I'm retired 25 year law enforcement and I've traveled extensively across the United States and I've seen it virtually in every major city and every medium-sized city that I've traveled through.
[02:47:22.186 --> 02:47:33.711]  And some of my research indicates that initially this goes all the way back to the 90s when they discovered that the ozone shield was basically disappearing.
[02:47:34.631 --> 02:47:41.515]  And that the scientists basically devised this program initially to combat the deterioration... No, I've seen that.
[02:47:41.515 --> 02:47:43.656]  I've seen that from the 70s in our documents.
[02:47:43.656 --> 02:47:45.817]  That's exactly the research.
[02:47:45.817 --> 02:47:47.198]  I believe that's a cover story.
[02:47:47.198 --> 02:47:56.002]  Because four years ago they had a government-issued textbook for 6th graders that said, oh, we're spraying you like a sunscreen to save the Earth.
[02:47:56.002 --> 02:47:57.103]  G. Edward Griffin comments.
[02:47:57.915 --> 02:48:02.797]  Well, I agree with that, and they always come up with some explanation for why they're doing it.
[02:48:02.797 --> 02:48:05.378]  I mean, they're going to repair the ozone hole and all that stuff.
[02:48:05.378 --> 02:48:08.240]  Well, if that was the truth, why'd they keep it secret, then?
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:08.820]  Right.
[02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:10.561]  Yeah.
[02:48:10.561 --> 02:48:11.061]  Right on.
[02:48:11.061 --> 02:48:13.722]  I'm going to skip this break and just keep you guys to the end of the hour.
[02:48:13.722 --> 02:48:17.684]  We don't skip breaks a lot, but this is just too important, what we're doing today.
[02:48:17.684 --> 02:48:19.725]  Woody, anything else?
[02:48:19.725 --> 02:48:26.968]  Alex, I just wanted to tell you that also, if they can go back and research the Montreal Protocols,
[02:48:27.386 --> 02:48:38.798]  They'll also discover that the pesticides that we've been using all over the United States on our crops also contributed majorly to the... Your phone cut out.
[02:48:38.798 --> 02:48:39.738]  I'm gonna have to let you go.
[02:48:39.738 --> 02:48:41.140]  Somebody called you on the fax machine.
[02:48:43.678 --> 02:48:51.822]  They will ban pesticides that are not very toxic and bad for humans and lie about DDT that did not make the eggs thin.
[02:48:51.822 --> 02:48:53.583]  That's admitted now in other hoax.
[02:48:53.583 --> 02:48:58.985]  But then they'll allow incredibly deadly pesticides and herbicides to be used.
[02:48:58.985 --> 02:49:02.507]  You guys want to comment on that?
[02:49:02.507 --> 02:49:03.928]  Oh, we didn't lose the caller.
[02:49:03.928 --> 02:49:06.489]  We lost one of the guests.
[02:49:06.489 --> 02:49:07.669]  Okay.
[02:49:07.669 --> 02:49:08.790]  Well, okay.
[02:49:11.716 --> 02:49:13.058]  Okay, do we have G. Edward?
[02:49:13.058 --> 02:49:14.679]  Yeah, I'm back on.
[02:49:14.679 --> 02:49:16.842]  My phone just went dead a moment ago.
[02:49:16.842 --> 02:49:22.528]  Okay, I think that was our phone system that went dead because we lost everybody.
[02:49:22.528 --> 02:49:31.338]  The caller was talking about how they'll ban pesticides like DDT and lie about them, but then they'll authorize really deadly pesticides to be used.
[02:49:32.779 --> 02:49:33.339]  Well, sure.
[02:49:33.339 --> 02:49:38.163]  In other words, duh, we're talking about hidden agendas here.
[02:49:38.163 --> 02:49:39.764]  How much evidence do we need, you know?
[02:49:39.764 --> 02:49:44.208]  This is back to my harsh statement about they're lying about this.
[02:49:44.208 --> 02:49:52.334]  It's hard for people to believe that the authorities whom they've trusted all these years will actually lie to them about such an important issue.
[02:49:52.334 --> 02:49:53.836]  But there it is, folks.
[02:49:53.836 --> 02:49:56.197]  You cannot deny it anymore.
[02:49:56.197 --> 02:49:59.080]  Well, it goes back to just this.
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:01.882]  I mean, literally in my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:50:02.830 --> 02:50:03.310]  Yep, that's it.
[02:50:03.310 --> 02:50:03.931]  They absolutely are.
[02:50:29.721 --> 02:50:30.602]  Well, it's amazing.
[02:50:30.602 --> 02:50:32.563]  I'm going to skip this final break.
[02:50:32.563 --> 02:50:34.685]  It's a network break, so stations should carry it.
[02:50:34.685 --> 02:50:35.465]  Appreciate everybody.
[02:50:35.465 --> 02:50:39.208]  Let's try to get Mark, Wesley, Sue, and Lex on.
[02:50:39.208 --> 02:50:40.749]  Quick questions or comments.
[02:50:40.749 --> 02:50:43.010]  Mark in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:44.471]  Hi Alex.
[02:50:44.471 --> 02:50:49.915]  I've been working outside for the past 12 years with the lawn maintenance in Florida.
[02:50:49.915 --> 02:50:51.897]  West Central Florida.
[02:50:51.897 --> 02:50:58.942]  And I can speak through first-hand experience that literally it takes
[02:51:00.985 --> 02:51:03.628]  The grass growing time has cut in half.
[02:51:03.628 --> 02:51:05.530]  Like, the grass is not growing.
[02:51:05.530 --> 02:51:08.773]  It doesn't matter if it rains all week.
[02:51:08.773 --> 02:51:14.799]  I've heard people talk about how you get joint pains when they're in the sky and it's all true.
[02:51:14.799 --> 02:51:15.559]  No, no.
[02:51:15.559 --> 02:51:19.863]  Farmers all over are saying they've never seen vegetable gardens not grow.
[02:51:19.863 --> 02:51:23.287]  It's happening to our family with property in East Texas.
[02:51:23.287 --> 02:51:25.349]  Guys, you cover some of that in the film, don't you?
[02:51:26.172 --> 02:51:31.074]  Well, we absolutely do, and we spent some time with Francis Mangels and Dane Wigginton.
[02:51:31.074 --> 02:51:35.416]  Francis, of course, is a retired biologist, and he's saying just that.
[02:51:35.416 --> 02:51:44.379]  He also does gardens for people, and gardens are struggling, you know, in that area and as well around the country and around the world.
[02:51:44.379 --> 02:51:49.662]  Also, Dane made that statement similar to the gentleman about the grass.
[02:51:49.662 --> 02:51:50.762]  The grass is not growing.
[02:51:50.762 --> 02:51:52.703]  It's about half of the height.
[02:51:53.867 --> 02:51:57.449]  All over Northern California, trees are just dying everywhere.
[02:52:08.064 --> 02:52:10.986]  And of course, he's been finding very high amounts of again.
[02:52:10.986 --> 02:52:14.869]  And the bats are dying and they're finding aluminum and the bees are dying.
[02:52:14.869 --> 02:52:17.490]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:52:17.490 --> 02:52:18.751]  And meanwhile, the U.N.
[02:52:18.751 --> 02:52:29.959]  and Bill and Melinda Gates have over 45 bunkers, many of them hidden, North Pole, other places, bunkers hidden with armed guards guarding giant seed vaults.
[02:52:29.959 --> 02:52:32.721]  I tell you, G. Edward Griffin, this looks like a Moonraker scenario to me.
[02:52:33.061 --> 02:52:34.722]  Yeah, it's really weird.
[02:52:34.722 --> 02:52:38.546]  And that seed vault issue has often caused me to puzzle.
[02:52:38.546 --> 02:52:39.847]  Why do you suppose they're doing that?
[02:52:39.847 --> 02:52:42.969]  Are they really trying to guard the seeds?
[02:52:42.969 --> 02:52:47.693]  Do they expect that what they're doing may just wipe everything out and then have to start over again?
[02:52:47.693 --> 02:52:51.376]  Or are they guarding them to make sure that nobody else guards them?
[02:52:51.376 --> 02:52:52.457]  I don't know.
[02:52:52.457 --> 02:52:55.720]  You know, your mind can run wild with things like this.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:57.261]  There's so many unanswered questions.
[02:52:57.261 --> 02:53:00.864]  No, I mean, after they wreck everything, that stuff's going to be the most valuable thing on the planet.
[02:53:02.467 --> 02:53:06.389]  Yes, but they're going to sit on top of it and make sure that you and I don't get hold of it.
[02:53:06.389 --> 02:53:11.413]  And they've got mega companies doing whatever they can, sometimes paying a hundred times over the P.E.
[02:53:11.413 --> 02:53:14.756]  ratio for small heirloom seed companies.
[02:53:14.756 --> 02:53:15.736]  Yes.
[02:53:15.736 --> 02:53:17.758]  Okay, there's our next business venture, everybody.
[02:53:17.758 --> 02:53:20.560]  Let's go form an heirloom seed company.
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:21.220]  There you go.
[02:53:21.220 --> 02:53:23.182]  We've got some great sponsors doing that.
[02:53:23.182 --> 02:53:24.023]  Mark, great points.
[02:53:24.023 --> 02:53:25.724]  Let's talk to Wesley in Oklahoma.
[02:53:28.371 --> 02:53:29.572]  Hey, thank you.
[02:53:29.572 --> 02:53:30.253]  Hey, can you hear me?
[02:53:30.253 --> 02:53:31.594]  Yes, I can.
[02:53:31.594 --> 02:53:32.414]  Alright, thank you.
[02:53:32.414 --> 02:53:37.318]  I just wanted to talk about, um, you know, Mr. Griffin and tell you how they ride, uh, along with the current.
[02:53:37.318 --> 02:53:46.664]  And last Thursday, I was at school here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and, uh, I went in at 930 and I saw up in the cloud that, you know, there was X's of, uh, trails.
[02:53:46.664 --> 02:53:52.809]  And when I got out at three, I noticed those trails had moved along with the wind, except they didn't move like clouds.
[02:53:52.809 --> 02:53:54.370]  And then, uh, so,
[02:53:55.655 --> 02:53:59.416]  You know, that goes, you know, to the point of how, you know, it's the whole drift thing.
[02:53:59.416 --> 02:54:09.738]  Oh, hey, hey, what about two years ago, the major meteorology association, NOAA, came out and said, there's now not three kinds of clouds, a new cloud in the last decade has appeared.
[02:54:09.738 --> 02:54:14.619]  So there's now new clouds, and you look at the classification, it's a chemtrail.
[02:54:14.619 --> 02:54:21.960]  Yeah, and so, you know, I'm, I text, you know, 10 people, I try getting people to, you know, look up and say, yo, that's not a cloud.
[02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:22.140]  And, uh,
[02:54:22.833 --> 02:54:28.697]  And I agree with Mr. Murphy, you know, you can only be lied to for so long before you've got to start reaching out to other people.
[02:54:28.697 --> 02:54:35.522]  And, uh, you know, with Mr. Griffin, uh, he's talking about, you know, the God-like people that, you know, want to get rid of the human race.
[02:54:35.522 --> 02:54:47.830]  Uh, I found an article Friday night, uh, if you Google, uh, it is, you can, you can type in, we can all change, one, two, three, with no spaces in it.
[02:54:48.513 --> 02:54:51.336]  And, uh, that article should, uh, be a helpful article.
[02:54:51.336 --> 02:54:55.480]  Yeah, we have BBC articles where it says, elite believe we will split into two species.
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:57.802]  It goes back to, uh, H.G.
[02:54:57.802 --> 02:54:59.403]  Wells, who was a big globalist in N.E.S.
[02:54:59.403 --> 02:55:02.326]  They're on complete megalomaniacal, uh, power trips.
[02:55:02.326 --> 02:55:03.227]  We're almost out of time.
[02:55:03.227 --> 02:55:05.149]  Quickly, Sue in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:55:05.871 --> 02:55:09.352]  Yeah, hi Alex, Mr. Griffin for taking my call.
[02:55:09.352 --> 02:55:20.654]  I'm just really interested in this and considering with all the fluoride that we've been doused with, I've read a lot about it and I've read that the fluoride ion has an affinity to bonding with aluminum that they're spraying us with.
[02:55:20.654 --> 02:55:26.975]  Yes, Dr. Boylock says the two excite each other and have a magnifying effect.
[02:55:26.975 --> 02:55:35.176]  Right, right, and due to all the neurological diseases that have been increasing with the brain plaques like MS and all the other diseases,
[02:55:35.563 --> 02:55:48.696]  I'm just saying, is this possible that they're using these different avenues in collaboration with each other for their, you know, original intent, which is, you know, trying to kill us?
[02:55:48.696 --> 02:55:53.281]  Well, it's certainly possible, and some of us might even think it's probable.
[02:55:53.997 --> 02:55:55.018]  Oh, we actually have those studies.
[02:55:55.018 --> 02:55:55.138]  You do?
[02:56:09.167 --> 02:56:10.609]  Yeah, in Canada and the U.S.
[02:56:10.609 --> 02:56:16.676]  and China, the IQ is upwards of 20 points lower, and there's massive increases in neurological disorders.
[02:56:16.676 --> 02:56:18.198]  We're out of time, Sue.
[02:56:18.198 --> 02:56:18.919]  By the way, I was wrong.
[02:56:18.919 --> 02:56:20.361]  There were four types of clouds.
[02:56:20.361 --> 02:56:24.746]  They've discovered a fifth type, and when you look at the news articles, it's chemtrails they're showing.
[02:56:24.746 --> 02:56:27.069]  Oh, look, there's a new cloud type, and it's chemtrails.
[02:56:28.035 --> 02:56:32.059]  I mean, watch old movies from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, or commercials.
[02:56:32.059 --> 02:56:33.300]  You never see chemtrails.
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:35.082]  Now in the TV ads, it's chemtrails.
[02:56:35.082 --> 02:56:38.845]  You can't go out and shoot most of the time without these being there.
[02:56:38.845 --> 02:56:40.987]  Folks, get the film.
[02:56:40.987 --> 02:56:41.848]  Get it out to everyone.
[02:56:41.848 --> 02:56:44.491]  Support filmmakers like G. Edward Griffin and Mr. Murphy.
[02:56:45.011 --> 02:56:45.772]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:56:45.772 --> 02:56:46.092]  Good luck.
[02:57:06.610 --> 02:57:07.231]  Amazing.
[02:57:07.231 --> 02:57:07.891]  God bless you.
[02:57:07.891 --> 02:57:09.612]  Sorry we don't have time to get to the other callers.
[02:57:09.612 --> 02:57:11.854]  I've got a few final items I wanted to hit.
[02:57:11.854 --> 02:57:21.881]  We're doing a search term today, hopefully it'll be number one, to send people to the huge new 9-11 information that has come out.
[02:57:21.881 --> 02:57:29.727]  In fact, I'm looking for Paul Joseph Watson's headline there, but it deals with these new firefighter videos that got released.
[02:57:29.727 --> 02:57:29.887]  It is
[02:57:30.507 --> 02:57:45.206]  It is so important, and the new search term is, for folks that don't remember it, so it'll lead them to the article, video, 9-1-1 firefighters reveal huge explosions before towers collapse, prisonplanet.com.
[02:57:45.206 --> 02:57:48.190]  The search term is huge explosions.
[02:57:48.951 --> 02:57:50.654]  Huge Explosions!
[02:58:05.155 --> 02:58:23.450]  Let's search the term 9 slash 1 1 firefighters 9 slash 1 1 1 9 slash 1 1 firefighters so 9 1 1 firefighters search that as a secondary search term and hey throw in building 7 let's have 3 let's make them really mad search building 7
[02:58:24.631 --> 02:58:25.432]  Building 7.
[02:58:25.432 --> 02:58:28.057]  That'll lead them to everybody who's covering this stuff.
[02:58:28.057 --> 02:58:29.139]  So those are the search terms.
[02:58:29.139 --> 02:58:30.361]  Great job to everybody.
[02:58:30.361 --> 02:58:32.965]  By the way, they only have 800 tickets available.
[02:58:32.965 --> 02:58:38.033]  They've sold over 600 for the KSCO.com event where I'm going to be speaking out in Santa Cruz.
[02:58:38.033 --> 02:58:40.898]  Get your copies or get your tickets at KSCO.com.
