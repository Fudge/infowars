[00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:08.286]  Societies don't change.
[00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:17.014]  Whether it was the Roman Empire or Nazi Germany, the population is obsessed with sports and petty celebrities.
[00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:19.236]  And the United States is no different.
[00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:25.081]  MSNBC, the New York Times, they're all reporting that we are going into a depression.
[00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.263]  One of the greatest depressions in world history.
[00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:34.790]  And our decadent, slob-like public, and that's not everyone, but large percentages of the public, could care less.
[00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.152]  They're not involved in their communities.
[00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:40.795]  We've got 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:43.378]  The government's raising taxes on every level.
[00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:45.820]  The border with Mexico is collapsing.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.601]  Mexico has collapsed.
[00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:51.144]  And the public doesn't care, because the media has set the agenda.
[00:00:51.144 --> 00:00:54.928]  And they tell you to care about LeBron James and his decision.
[00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.551]  And he's playing into it and is going to announce his stupid decision.
[00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:01.913]  It doesn't matter what basketball team he goes to.
[00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:04.716]  This is a distraction by design.
[00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:14.984]  We have the governor of the state he's currently living in, in a bizarre, we are LeBron, we are the world, literal worship fest with hundreds of celebrities.
[00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:15.865]  This is sickening.
[00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:38.485]  Imagine the Ohio government begging and pleading on television and serenading LeBron James with hundreds of other celebrities when Ohio is one of the states slated to go completely bankrupt.
[00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:39.826]  We're going into a depression.
[00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:43.910]  They're about to launch World War III with Iran openly.
[00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.132]  Fox News is reporting as if it's a good thing.
[00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:56.039]  In New York State and Illinois that troops have helped arrest thousands of citizens and are doing gun sweeps in people's homes and searching people's cars.
[00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.081]  We're going in to marshal law.
[00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:01.543]  Offshore banks have overthrown the US.
[00:02:01.543 --> 00:02:05.866]  They've stolen tens of trillions of dollars like we're some third world country they're looting.
[00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:07.527]  Everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:13.412]  So if you want to know why your children have no future, if you want to know why you're bankrupt, if you want to know why you're in debt, if you want to know
[00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:17.956]  Why you have no future and have lost your job or getting your pay cut.
[00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:20.659]  It's because your priorities are wrong.
[00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:29.948]  It's because you let that idiot box, the television program you since the days that your mother and father set you in front of the TV for 12 hours a day in your crap filled diapers.
[00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.312]  It's not too late to admit we're a sick, decadent, degenerate society crumbling.
[00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:37.773]  We are Rome.
[00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:38.973]  It's 410.
[00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:41.115]  We're about to collapse, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:41.895]  I know you won't know.
[00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.476]  You know about LeBron James.
[00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:47.098]  You don't know 410 is when Rome completely fell to Alaric, the Visigoth leader.
[00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:48.379]  You better learn history.
[00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.639]  This is dangerous.
[00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.080]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.321]  The globalist engineers.
[00:02:53.041 --> 00:03:01.424]  The globalist social engineers look at you and how pathetic you are and how the whole world is waiting to see where LeBron James goes.
[00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:05.926]  The social controllers look at you and see how you're obsessed with LeBron James.
[00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.586]  And they decide, we've got a bunch of schmucks.
[00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.967]  We've got a bunch of idiots.
[00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:11.728]  We've got a bunch of morons right where we want them.
[00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:13.048]  Let's destroy their society.
[00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:13.749]  Let's loot it.
[00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.249]  Let's pass carbon taxes.
[00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.770]  Let's expand NAFTA and GATT.
[00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.671]  Let's announce an end to the dollar as the global reserve currency.
[00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:20.931]  Do you know what that means?
[00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:22.472]  We've already lost almost all our industry.
[00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:24.113]  We're already in a depression.
[00:03:24.113 --> 00:03:29.638]  When they get rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency, your life, as you know it, is officially over.
[00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:33.181]  You're going to be a third world slave like they are in Mexico or Nigeria.
[00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:34.062]  And you know what?
[00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:36.264]  Those people down there at least know why they're slaves.
[00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:43.451]  You are so stupid and so focused on crap, you'll probably still be talking about Lindsay Lohan when you're living as a homeless person on the street.
[00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.315]  My friends, we've got to set our priorities and set them now.
[00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:48.877]  Liberty or tyranny.
[00:03:48.877 --> 00:03:51.661]  You've got to wake up and decide what is important to you.
[00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.982]  Saving our republic?
[00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.785]  Stopping the globalist takeover?
[00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:58.629]  Or knowing all the mindless trivia about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan?
[00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.971]  There isn't much more time.
[00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:07.472]  I'm begging you to ask yourselves to look in the mirror and really realize how sick this is.
[00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:21.195]  It's not bad like a basketball game, but it is mentally ill and sick to buy into this manufactured hype and to have government officials that should be working for the people, sitting there in these disgusting media spectacles, worshiping somebody.
[00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:25.596]  Our role models, our icons, the people that our children look up to,
[00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:27.036]  We're clowns!
[00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:50.911]  They've taken our heroes and our role models away.
[00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:57.262]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have been warned, and this whole LeBron James decision means absolutely nothing.
[00:04:57.262 --> 00:05:00.427]  This obsession with petty issues of little or no significance...
[00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:08.777]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:02.824]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:07:02.824 --> 00:07:05.166]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:08.370]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.476]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:17.681]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:20.324]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:23.208]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.132]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:33.742]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:39.447]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:42.307]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:07:42.307 --> 00:07:45.988]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:47.069]  And I got news for you.
[00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:48.409]  You're everyone else.

[00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:15.716]  We're live, my friends.
[00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:17.396]  It is Monday, July 12, 2010.
[00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.977]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:31.140]  We're going to start simulcasting the radio broadcast coming up at the 33-minute mark today for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.440]  Okay.
[00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:56.318]  Every day we start the broadcast and I make the point that there is a quickening, there is an acceleration in tyranny worldwide, in oppression, in the private offshore banking cartels, bankrupting nations by design, preparing to launch new wars.
[00:08:56.318 --> 00:09:00.380]  We're going to be discussing it all today.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.522]  But I just want to point out again at the start of the broadcast that
[00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:14.888]  What we discuss here is so real, so pertinent, so amazingly vital.
[00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:24.833]  Our world is being suffocated, is being enslaved, and we must speak out against it.
[00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:27.414]  We must all say no to the system.
[00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:29.075]  The good news is, the awakening
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.941]  He is turbocharged.
[00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:33.342]  People are concerned.
[00:09:33.342 --> 00:09:48.313]  They are beginning to basically engage in a crash course of research and discover how the world really works and who controls our planet and what this criminal power structure is up to.
[00:09:48.313 --> 00:09:54.958]  But this morning, I saw a story up on Infowars.com that completely blew me away.
[00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.219]  Now, I knew this was coming.
[00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:08.693]  But to know something is coming and then to actually see it unfold is another thing entirely.
[00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:22.263]  And to see the lies and manipulation and how they're rolling this program out against the public, well, that's the rest of the story.
[00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:23.224]  What am I talking about?
[00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:36.492]  Fighting gangsters, LA police teach Marines tactics to take down Taliban, train Afghan police, Fox News.
[00:10:36.492 --> 00:10:39.573]  Here's another one, MSNBC.
[00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:43.735]  Cops show Marines how to take on the Taliban.
[00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:49.337]  Camp Pendleton Marines went to one of LA's toughest neighborhoods.
[00:10:49.337 --> 00:10:52.099]  And they helped run checkpoints and pulled citizens over.
[00:10:53.168 --> 00:11:03.895]  Now when you read these articles, these are written to sell you on a Marine Corps, regular Marine Corps presence on your streets.
[00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:10.979]  When you've been following this for 13 years, I've been on air 15, but I really became aware of this about 13 years ago.
[00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:24.780]  I became aware of a secret, strategic, long-term program going on since at least the late 1980s with Marines, regular Marines.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.002]  This is completely illegal.
[00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:34.742]  Secretly raiding gun dealers' shops and homes in Virginia and other areas.
[00:11:34.742 --> 00:11:43.785]  I then discovered secret programs of regular army training with emergency managers and county police for gun confiscation.
[00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:51.828]  I interviewed emergency managers, police chiefs, who discovered it when they were told this was happening.
[00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:54.529]  Al A. Philippus, the chief of police of San Antonio,
[00:11:55.595 --> 00:12:02.582]  Military veteran himself was approached by Delta Force for a secret martial law takeover plan.
[00:12:02.582 --> 00:12:10.689]  Thomas Sanchez, the head of emergency management, himself a highly decorated army officer in Vietnam.
[00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:20.379]  They approached him under PDD 25 and said these drills were going to conduct in the county of taking over the city council, the county courthouse,
[00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:23.871]  Of course, we have the congressional hearings from the 1980s, 1986.
[00:12:35.575 --> 00:12:41.139]  With RECS 84, a secret federal program to overthrow the states and take over local governments.
[00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:50.225]  This is on record that this has been going on, but they have exponentially expanded the training and the acclamation.
[00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:58.230]  In California, in Illinois, in Iowa, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, Arizona,
[00:13:00.632 --> 00:13:05.894]  We have sent cameramen to Maryland, Illinois, the list goes on and on.
[00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:09.035]  I have traveled to California.
[00:13:09.035 --> 00:13:24.881]  I have witnessed Marines training to take over our cities with role players playing the part of American gun owners being put into processing centers and being face scanned and thumb printed and then being divided up into different areas of the camps.
[00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.782]  We have documented that the federal government is training
[00:13:29.181 --> 00:13:46.428]  Now over 50,000 prominent preachers in at least a six-year-old program now called the Clergy Response Team to teach their flocks, their congregations, to accept martial law, forced inoculations, gun confiscations, and processing into camps.
[00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:47.208]  What are camps?
[00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:49.569]  Your local sports stadium and all the drills.
[00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:52.470]  They can turn it into a camp in one hour or less.
[00:13:54.619 --> 00:13:56.101]  This is all on record.
[00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:58.444]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:13:58.444 --> 00:14:05.532]  And this is what I cover in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:10.058]  15 years of research, all condensed into 2 hours 24 minutes.
[00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.540]  The latest information.
[00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:19.974]  Whether it's the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, you see National Guard out, armed with 45s, as security.
[00:14:19.974 --> 00:14:25.775]  Somebody runs out on the field after the race, they run out and beat them up in front of everyone.
[00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:28.016]  I go to New York.
[00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:29.296]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:37.778]  Troops run across the street when I'm videotaping them, armed, and begin screaming and cussing at me in America, telling me not to tape them.
[00:14:40.182 --> 00:14:53.705]  This has nothing, zero, big zero, zip, nada, nil, nothing to do with turbaned men in Afghanistan on the CIA payroll.
[00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:54.106]  Zero.
[00:14:56.232 --> 00:15:01.878]  And now it's not once a month I read about a gun confiscation drill in Arcadia, Iowa.
[00:15:01.878 --> 00:15:10.308]  It's not once a month I see a governor or the legislature of Illinois calling for National Guard to take part in gun confiscation door-to-door sweeps.
[00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:21.216]  It's not once a month I get footage of National Guard in the middle of nowhere in Oregon in the middle of farmland searching people's cars at checkpoints.
[00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:24.479]  It is now every single day.
[00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:27.781]  They are massively increasing this and we have two years ago
[00:15:29.002 --> 00:15:42.791]  The Army Times reporting Brigade Homeland, 4,000 battle-hardened regular Army troops, the best troops they've got in their own words, training to quote, this is in the Army Times, pull triggers on Americans.
[00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:45.653]  They said, we don't like it, but we're training to pull triggers.
[00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.234]  That was a quote.
[00:15:47.234 --> 00:15:56.981]  Then after a month of me harping on it, the Army Times, but not before we saved it at InfoWars.com, that's why we do that on key articles, they took the part about pulling triggers out.
[00:15:58.188 --> 00:15:59.069]  They excised it.
[00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:00.370]  They didn't retract it.
[00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.211]  They didn't put a blurb and say we were mistaken.
[00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.953]  They removed those key areas.
[00:16:04.953 --> 00:16:10.958]  You read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, concurrently passed the next three years.
[00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:18.344]  They say we're training the military to take on states, to take over governorships.
[00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:25.009]  Now they've set up the 10-member Governor's Council, appointed by the President, so they can claim, oh look, we still represent the states.
[00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:26.210]  It's the Governor's Council.
[00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:32.698]  Not your governor, not all 50 governors, but 10 hand-picked.
[00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:36.859]  And then you read the psyops all over the news today.
[00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:45.061]  Fox, MSNBC, NBC, AP, all going, oh, the Marines are out doing weapons sweeps.
[00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:48.522]  And yeah, they're stopping people at checkpoints, but it's only part of a drill.
[00:16:48.522 --> 00:16:52.883]  But remember, two years ago.
[00:16:52.883 --> 00:16:54.423]  This isn't just the local news.
[00:16:54.423 --> 00:16:56.804]  I actually have the chip news
[00:16:59.312 --> 00:17:06.374]  Basin Area Office, 29 Palms Highway, Joshua Tree, California.
[00:17:06.374 --> 00:17:09.275]  Contact Officer Rob McLeod, 760-358-3707 for immediate release December 10, 2008.
[00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:13.196]  Chipped to conduct sobriety driver license check point.
[00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:23.242]  With irregular U.S.
[00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:23.943]  Marines.
[00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:24.883]  And then it happened.
[00:17:24.883 --> 00:17:30.127]  Armed Marines went out all over the county, pulling citizens over at checkpoints.
[00:17:30.127 --> 00:17:32.569]  These are not drills.
[00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:47.440]  These are training exercises for full military occupation of the United States by the treacherous, treasonous federal government, now suing Arizona, trying to block the state from simply trying to conduct law and order.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.382]  Oh, you can have a Marine Corps checkpoint to warrantly search citizens.
[00:17:51.257 --> 00:18:01.431]  But you don't have a first contact under law and probable cause when you pull an illegal over for speeding or drunk driving and they don't have an ID and they're an illegal alien.
[00:18:01.431 --> 00:18:02.793]  You're not to take them to jail.
[00:18:02.793 --> 00:18:03.955]  You are to let them go.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:16.969]  But if you're a citizen, the book gets thrown at you, and the media and the federal government run these giant hoaxes, telling you they're going to round up anybody who's Hispanic in America, when that's complete balderdash.
[00:18:16.969 --> 00:18:23.634]  In these southwestern states, more than half the population is Hispanic, and more than half the cops are Hispanic.
[00:18:23.634 --> 00:18:27.517]  You think Hispanic Americans are going to arrest Hispanic Americans?
[00:18:27.517 --> 00:18:28.598]  No.
[00:18:28.598 --> 00:18:33.682]  No, they're going to arrest illegal aliens, ladies and gentlemen, when they pull them over for drunk driving.
[00:18:36.152 --> 00:18:42.175]  So we are witnessing high treason and now they're doing gun sweeps, you name it.
[00:18:42.175 --> 00:18:44.697]  And I never even got to this Friday.
[00:18:44.697 --> 00:18:51.620]  We have the article up on PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:58.004]  Two thousand plus arrests aided by the National Guard and that's in the local Fox News newscast in the part two.
[00:18:59.696 --> 00:18:59.916]  I think?
[00:19:25.196 --> 00:19:27.177]  We covered Part 1 on Thursday that aired Wednesday.
[00:19:27.177 --> 00:19:31.019]  We got to some of what happened with Part 2 on Friday that aired Thursday.
[00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:31.900]  I'm told a Part 3 aired.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.141]  I haven't seen it yet.
[00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:36.322]  There's so much intel coming in, I can't even watch it all.
[00:19:36.322 --> 00:19:40.805]  But in Part 2, they said, oh, we helped arrest 2,000 people.
[00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:43.847]  National Guard arresting people with the police?
[00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:47.429]  This is the federal government engaged in high treason.
[00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:48.890]  This is completely illegal.
[00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.612]  Oh, they whittled down posse comitatus, but they didn't get rid of them.
[00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:55.388]  And so they're getting ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:55.388 --> 00:19:56.329]  This is really happening.
[00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.770]  And here's the worst part.
[00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.311]  They're openly trading with foreign troops.
[00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:00.172]  We'll cover that when we get back.
[00:20:02.102 --> 00:20:05.705]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.366]  That's right, hair.
[00:20:07.366 --> 00:20:10.568]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[00:20:10.568 --> 00:20:12.469]  The drain claw.
[00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:14.651]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:16.552]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[00:20:16.552 --> 00:20:20.995]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[00:20:20.995 --> 00:20:24.678]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[00:20:24.918 --> 00:20:32.221]  The Drain Claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.

[00:21:03.676 --> 00:21:09.439]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:19.325]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on prison
[00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:20.197]  I think so.
[00:21:36.369 --> 00:21:50.502]  All organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.

[00:22:02.182 --> 00:22:03.203]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:03.203 --> 00:22:08.730]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.291]  I get it.
[00:22:09.291 --> 00:22:18.903]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:18.903 --> 00:22:20.085]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:28.771]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:32.173]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:32.173 --> 00:22:36.436]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:36.436 --> 00:22:38.037]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:38.037 --> 00:22:42.000]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.602]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:46.703]  You should too.
[00:22:46.703 --> 00:22:47.864]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:47.864 --> 00:22:50.786]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:50.846]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.846 --> 00:22:50.906]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.906 --> 00:22:51.267]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.525 --> 00:23:04.729]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!
[00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:08.473]  Introducing the most revolutionary, most comfortable, and coolest pillow ever!

[00:23:38.301 --> 00:23:43.005]  And best of all, MyPillow comes with a 10-year warranty and a 60-day money-back guarantee.
[00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.067]  So what do you have to lose except poor sleep?
[00:23:45.447 --> 00:23:45.827]  Think about it.
[00:23:45.827 --> 00:23:47.948]  The Pentagon has taken over hundreds of countries.
[00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:49.789]  They have financed the overthrow of more than 50.
[00:24:15.262 --> 00:24:29.220]  Using dictators, rebel groups, bordering nations to go in and overthrow countries that they don't like, or countries whose resources they want to steal and give to globalist corporations.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.325]  And we have fit the bill as the American people for all of this.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:49.950]  I remember in 2001 seeing mainstream news reports in Reuters and the Toronto Star where agreements were signed as part of the SPP to use Canadian and Mexican troops, quote, to fight American terrorists.
[00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:50.971]  We witnessed U.S.
[00:24:50.971 --> 00:25:01.318]  troops being used in Canada to, quote, help with security at the Olympic Games just a few months ago.
[00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:09.170]  And you see the same thing in England, the same thing in Europe, the same thing in the United States.
[00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:21.838]  Everywhere, we see the same slow incremental conditioning of the police being federalized and of foreign troops being used in the United States.
[00:25:21.838 --> 00:25:28.442]  Then we had NLE09 last year with troops from 14 countries, quote, training to take on American terrorists.
[00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:37.099]  And also, quote, helping with digital surveillance of the American people, wiretapping.
[00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:40.921]  These are giant war games against us, but now it's not just war games.
[00:25:40.921 --> 00:25:51.909]  It's real army, real National Guard, real bonafide regular Marines, not Marine Reserves, out searching Americans armed.
[00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:53.511]  That came out in the California papers.
[00:25:54.773 --> 00:26:08.798]  We started reporting on it off the press release back in 2008, and then several local papers went out and confirmed armed Marines, in some cases by themselves, at checkpoints, searching citizens and arresting citizens.
[00:26:08.798 --> 00:26:18.202]  And then they add, of course, other PR releases in the Army Times and other publications saying, well, the Army's going to be out helping with care flight.
[00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:19.322]  You've had a bad car wreck.
[00:26:19.322 --> 00:26:21.023]  What's wrong with the Army?
[00:26:21.023 --> 00:26:23.384]  They're going to help fly you out to safety.
[00:26:25.077 --> 00:26:29.059]  We're going to have, you know, Army with Jaws of Life cutting you out of the vehicle.
[00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:32.000]  Oh!
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.263]  And now I've got reports, oh, the military is going to help do blood draws at DWI checkpoints.
[00:26:39.263 --> 00:26:41.144]  Now you have to ask yourself, why has there been a
[00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:51.415]  20 plus year secret program to have Marines raiding gun dealers' homes in almost every case.
[00:26:51.415 --> 00:26:53.757]  That's what their main target is.
[00:26:53.757 --> 00:26:58.140]  This is in Road to Tyranny that I made eight and a half years ago.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.140]  We show you the documents.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.582]  I interview a Marine Corps officer.
[00:27:01.582 --> 00:27:05.044]  This is totally illegal.
[00:27:05.044 --> 00:27:09.507]  And why did the Marine Corps officer call me in 2000?
[00:27:10.964 --> 00:27:12.385]  It was a local TV report at the time.
[00:27:12.385 --> 00:27:16.049]  I put it in the film in 2002.
[00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:25.217]  Because he was driving a I-35 from San Antonio and came up to an army checkpoint searching people's vehicles just south of Austin.
[00:27:25.217 --> 00:27:26.339]  And he got so upset.
[00:27:26.339 --> 00:27:32.604]  He'd been listening to my show and he knew that he'd been part of secret programs that were completely illegal.
[00:27:32.604 --> 00:27:36.148]  And then here he was with the National Guard wanting to search his vehicle.
[00:27:37.577 --> 00:27:42.219]  And so the average person is just hearing, oh, the Marines are training for Afghanistan.
[00:27:42.219 --> 00:27:56.425]  You know, when I went to Urban Warrior with thousands of Marines and troops from at least six foreign nations, Czech Republic, Poland, Israel, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, France, I don't know, how many is that?
[00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:59.646]  Yeah, it's more than six.
[00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:02.727]  And I witnessed them with the role players going, I'm an American, no, not the camp.
[00:28:02.727 --> 00:28:04.688]  And them saying, where did you get this helmet?
[00:28:04.688 --> 00:28:05.668]  Where'd you get this gun?
[00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:07.009]  Well, I got it in San Francisco.
[00:28:09.363 --> 00:28:12.384]  Then I went home to my hotel room that night and turned on CNN.
[00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:13.264]  They'd been there.
[00:28:13.264 --> 00:28:20.386]  And they said, troops are training for Serbia and Macedonia.
[00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:21.386]  Total lie.
[00:28:21.386 --> 00:28:25.247]  I interviewed Colonel Love of the Marines, one of the commanders.
[00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:27.967]  He admitted it was for international and domestic.
[00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:29.628]  That's all in Police State 2000.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:38.584]  They have a huge covert secret program on record to take your guns, and they're training with foreign troops.
[00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:38.964]  And then what?
[00:28:38.964 --> 00:28:42.386]  A month ago, I sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas.
[00:28:42.386 --> 00:28:48.330]  They filed a 25-minute report at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.172]  They filed a 25-minute special report.
[00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:59.406]  That story should be mega viral right now.
[00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:12.796]  They went up to Illinois and witnessed Polish troops and other Eastern Bloc troops with the Army, National Guard and regular Army, all over the surrounding area of Chicago.
[00:29:12.796 --> 00:29:15.638]  And then the day they left and had to catch their flight, they're at the drill.
[00:29:15.638 --> 00:29:18.360]  And they said, oh, there's an unscheduled drill you guys can come to.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.121]  We're going to be at the local sports stadium.
[00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.767]  Doing a civil unrest drill.
[00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:26.428]  But the guys already had their tickets and had to get on the plane and leave.
[00:29:26.428 --> 00:29:28.689]  The point is, there was even more scheduled.
[00:29:28.689 --> 00:29:31.130]  With foreign trips.
[00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.171]  And the guys didn't call me.
[00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:36.913]  I'd have told them just ditch the thousand dollars in tickets or so and stay there.
[00:29:36.913 --> 00:29:39.954]  But of course, they've been away from their families five days, but they got most of it.
[00:29:39.954 --> 00:29:42.255]  It's just, it's always worse than you can imagine.
[00:29:42.255 --> 00:29:48.018]  Foreign trips and regular Army and Marines are training to take your guns and put you in concentration camps.
[00:29:48.018 --> 00:29:49.478]  Do you understand this is real?
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.883]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.883 --> 00:30:01.408]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:03.069]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:06.432]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:30:06.432 --> 00:30:11.656]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:30:11.656 --> 00:30:15.099]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:17.441]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:30:21.585 --> 00:30:22.726]  Take my word for it.
[00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:25.388]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:30:25.388 --> 00:30:31.895]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:30:31.895 --> 00:30:33.396]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.441]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:53.961]  Thank you!
[00:31:01.107 --> 00:31:06.071]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:07.072]  What have we got?
[00:31:07.072 --> 00:31:09.514]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:31:09.514 --> 00:31:10.515]  A republic.
[00:31:10.515 --> 00:31:13.177]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:31:13.177 --> 00:31:15.439]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:17.461]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:31:17.461 --> 00:31:19.142]  So they think they own our land?
[00:31:19.142 --> 00:31:20.464]  They think they own our water?
[00:31:20.464 --> 00:31:21.064]  Children?
[00:31:21.064 --> 00:31:22.185]  Our education?
[00:31:22.185 --> 00:31:23.026]  Our money?
[00:31:23.026 --> 00:31:26.669]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:32.015]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:33.036]  We have the facts.
[00:31:33.036 --> 00:31:34.177]  We have the Constitution.
[00:31:34.177 --> 00:31:35.098]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:35.098 --> 00:31:35.979]  We have common law.
[00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:38.502]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:38.502 --> 00:31:42.286]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:47.330]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.831]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:31:48.831 --> 00:31:49.931]  Don't tread on me.
[00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:56.336]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:05.380]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.300]  Number 1.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.721]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:10.581]  Number 2.
[00:32:10.581 --> 00:32:15.483]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.483 --> 00:32:16.223]  It's true.
[00:32:16.223 --> 00:32:21.084]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:21.084 --> 00:32:21.924]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.924 --> 00:32:25.505]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.505 --> 00:32:29.206]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:30.207]  Number 4.
[00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:32.970]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.654]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:37.434]  Number 5.
[00:32:37.434 --> 00:32:41.599]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:46.364]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:46.644 --> 00:32:50.809]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.809 --> 00:32:52.591]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:52.591 --> 00:32:54.854]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.854 --> 00:32:57.197]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:19.636 --> 00:33:21.777]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:33:21.777 --> 00:33:29.322]  We are live here on the radio and we're simulcasting the balance of the broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:29.322 --> 00:33:36.706]  Coming up at one o'clock Central Standard Time today, Peter Schiff will be joining us.
[00:33:36.706 --> 00:33:46.392]  He is, of course, an author, businessman, financial commentator, economic advisor to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign and 2010 candidate for the United States Senate.
[00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:57.361]  He will be joining us coming up in the last hour today, and we're also going to be opening the phones up when he joins us.
[00:33:57.361 --> 00:34:02.267]  I specifically want to open the phones up for listeners to talk about the economy,
[00:34:03.803 --> 00:34:21.437]  To give me your take on the fact that they are now admitting that Marines are helping run checkpoints all over California, but the mainstream media is spinning it, saying it's for training overseas, when we have their actual press releases that it is for domestic operations.
[00:34:21.437 --> 00:34:23.538]  It is completely illegal.
[00:34:23.538 --> 00:34:29.543]  Also, there's a Senate bill to make airport body scanners mandatory federal law, so that you couldn't refuse these.
[00:34:32.398 --> 00:34:40.621]  They now admit, depending on the scanner type, 20 to 50 times the cancer risk they had previously said, and they are recording your naked body.
[00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:50.145]  Also, it made big national news on the Drudge Report, and quite a few newspapers picked up and reported over the weekend on my little five and a half minute video about LeBron James.
[00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:54.169]  And the fact that people are obsessed with issues of little or no significance.
[00:34:54.169 --> 00:35:03.439]  I have an article I want to read that Paul Watson wrote about that today dealing with the brainwashing that's going on and how the mainstream media tries to set the agenda.
[00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:04.739]  Yeah.
[00:35:21.387 --> 00:35:28.113]  You can jump through all these hoops and pay a fee and basically take psychological testing as part of the five hours.
[00:35:28.113 --> 00:35:38.522]  And then if they decide you can have the privilege, then you can have a gun locked up in your house but can't even have it on your porch or take it outside your home.
[00:35:38.522 --> 00:35:43.486]  And now nationally, this is what the Supreme Court is saying our Second Amendment means.
[00:35:43.486 --> 00:35:45.468]  A highly restricted privilege.
[00:35:46.633 --> 00:35:54.718]  That's the same way they basically went from guns being completely legal in New York in the last 60 years to being completely illegal in New York City.
[00:35:54.718 --> 00:36:01.762]  There's still a route to get a concealed permit or a gun license in New York, but very few are able to get it.
[00:36:01.762 --> 00:36:05.904]  So we'll also be discussing that key issue.
[00:36:05.904 --> 00:36:10.407]  And we're also seeing a big push for the carbon tax once again.
[00:36:10.407 --> 00:36:13.349]  In fact, there's a Stan Cox article in the Washington Post today
[00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:24.622]  In the heat wave, the case against air conditioning, and they go on to say that the 100 plus degree weather must be global warming, when the East Coast routinely goes above 100 degrees.
[00:36:26.525 --> 00:36:31.930]  And then they continued to say that we need to ban air conditioners.
[00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:37.414]  And I see articles in the New York Times last week calling for a one-child policy here in the United States.
[00:36:37.414 --> 00:36:47.082]  In fact, the BBC is reporting global population study launched by Royal Society calling for a global population reduction to stop the carbon that humans exhale.
[00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:48.503]  And here's another one.
[00:36:48.503 --> 00:36:53.448]  UN World Population Day 2010, Beijing announces measures to stop unauthorized births.
[00:36:53.988 --> 00:36:58.272]  Including forced abortion and accelerated infanticide.
[00:36:58.272 --> 00:37:02.016]  So we're going to be breaking that down as well today.
[00:37:02.016 --> 00:37:04.819]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:04.879]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:13.467 --> 00:37:16.671]  to discuss any of these issues.
[00:37:16.671 --> 00:37:19.335]  I also want to get into what's happening with the states.
[00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:20.917]  Look at this Fox News headline.
[00:37:20.917 --> 00:37:24.902]  Struggling states seek more aid from Washington.
[00:37:28.709 --> 00:37:33.837]  And it says governors hamstrung by the sluggish economy rebound in their states.
[00:37:33.837 --> 00:37:35.740]  Sluggish rebound.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:42.129]  Are bound to balance their own budgets, are passing and pressing anew for Washington to step up more help.
[00:37:42.129 --> 00:37:44.373]  Some say it means adding to the nation's red ink.
[00:37:45.745 --> 00:37:46.986]  You gotta love that.
[00:37:46.986 --> 00:37:49.247]  The states are where the tax money comes from.
[00:37:49.247 --> 00:37:56.711]  The feds take it, give most of it to the offshore banks that have bought off the federal government, and then send a little bit of money back with strings attached.
[00:37:56.711 --> 00:38:04.115]  And I see all these newscasts with locals from all over the country saying, we need the army on the streets of Schenectady, New York.
[00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.836]  We need them to carry out police work.
[00:38:05.836 --> 00:38:08.857]  We need martial law in Schenectady.
[00:38:08.857 --> 00:38:10.578]  We need martial law in Illinois.
[00:38:10.578 --> 00:38:13.300]  We need martial law in Iowa.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.861]  The feds have got all the free money.
[00:38:15.899 --> 00:38:19.882]  I mean, they're not having mayors suddenly all over the country.
[00:38:19.882 --> 00:38:23.244]  Every week, I see another mayor calling for, quote, martial law.
[00:38:23.244 --> 00:38:25.205]  They're even using that term.
[00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:30.189]  I saw one of the city council members last year in Milwaukee call for martial law.
[00:38:30.189 --> 00:38:31.510]  They're just, that'll fix it.
[00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.351]  Let's just have troops.
[00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:37.053]  And all over the country, mayors say, there's now a daytime curfew.
[00:38:37.053 --> 00:38:41.116]  We're gonna be searching cars citywide and asking why you're out at 12 noon.
[00:38:42.817 --> 00:38:49.722]  In Arkansas and Oklahoma, and we need to inspect your home gardens to make sure you're not growing marijuana.
[00:38:49.722 --> 00:38:51.543]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:38:51.543 --> 00:38:54.145]  We know what authoritarianism is.
[00:38:54.145 --> 00:38:55.446]  We know what it looks like.
[00:38:55.446 --> 00:38:58.047]  It's here.
[00:38:58.047 --> 00:39:00.709]  And the states are saying, oh, feds, please give us money.
[00:39:00.709 --> 00:39:08.495]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens, especially in the southwestern states, are the main deciding factor bankrupting state budgets.
[00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:19.897]  The free health care, the free births of babies, the jail and prison populations in many cities in the Southwest are over half illegal alien.
[00:39:19.897 --> 00:39:27.403]  But God forbid we actually stem the tide of illegals pouring in, predominantly from Latin America that's in its own depression.
[00:39:27.403 --> 00:39:29.825]  I mean, it's worse than a depression in Mexico.
[00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:30.565]  No, no, no.
[00:39:30.565 --> 00:39:33.328]  We need to have more red ink and raise taxes even more.
[00:39:34.363 --> 00:39:50.656]  When that only further stalls the economy, which then again bankrupts the states to a greater extent, and then the feds themselves, globalized, they come in and take over the states, and their answer is marines and army and police at checkpoints.
[00:39:50.656 --> 00:39:54.680]  Here's the headline, New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of US citizens.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.122]  I'm going to play a clip of this in the next hour.
[00:39:57.122 --> 00:39:58.423]  Here's another one, Fox News.
[00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:02.157]  This is out on Sunday.
[00:40:02.157 --> 00:40:04.577]  Yesterday, July 11th, fighting gangsters.
[00:40:04.577 --> 00:40:04.757]  L.A.
[00:40:04.757 --> 00:40:09.238]  police teach Marines tactics to take down Taliban, train Afghan police.
[00:40:09.238 --> 00:40:13.119]  But I actually have the police press releases here.
[00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:17.421]  They admit in these press releases that they're actually arresting people.
[00:40:17.421 --> 00:40:18.721]  This is real.
[00:40:18.721 --> 00:40:19.581]  This is illegal.
[00:40:19.581 --> 00:40:20.361]  This is tyranny.
[00:40:20.361 --> 00:40:22.362]  This is so incredible.
[00:40:22.362 --> 00:40:24.222]  And I kept telling you this was coming.
[00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:26.503]  And they're just rolling it out now everywhere.
[00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:29.701]  But we can't have troops on the border.
[00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:33.143]  Oh, Marines can set up checkpoints and search citizens all over the country.
[00:40:33.143 --> 00:40:42.691]  But God forbid if you pull over a drunk driver and then they're an illegal alien, whether they be from Russia or Mexico or wherever else, you're not allowed to arrest them.
[00:40:42.691 --> 00:40:44.172]  You're not allowed to even ask for their ID.
[00:40:44.172 --> 00:40:46.354]  If they don't have an ID, you're supposed to let them go.
[00:40:46.354 --> 00:40:48.355]  This is a sick joke.
[00:40:48.355 --> 00:40:50.397]  Oh yes, the government are a bunch of civil libertarians.
[00:40:50.397 --> 00:40:52.659]  They care so much about the illegal alien's rights.
[00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:53.920]  Nobody's violating their rights.
[00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:58.070]  Here it is, cops show Marines how to take on Taliban.
[00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.171]  But then you actually read what they're doing.
[00:41:01.171 --> 00:41:03.932]  This is a PSYOP.
[00:41:03.932 --> 00:41:11.154]  And of course, here's our article from years ago.
[00:41:11.154 --> 00:41:14.235]  Marine presence confirmed.
[00:41:14.235 --> 00:41:16.516]  Again, there we are two years ago covering it.
[00:41:16.516 --> 00:41:23.878]  And now here it is in Fox News and NBC LA two years later.
[00:41:25.489 --> 00:41:25.829]  We're good to go.
[00:41:45.939 --> 00:41:54.661]  Somebody made a YouTube video about this, we haven't made one, and I just happened to cross it and saw the comments that were clearly psyops going, Alex is a liar!
[00:41:54.661 --> 00:42:06.883]  You know, the National Guard isn't out there doing gun confiscation, why they assisted in 2,000 drug arrests in this one area of New York State.
[00:42:06.883 --> 00:42:12.224]  And then you go watch part one and part two of the newscast, they admit they're doing gun arrests, gun sweeps,
[00:42:13.214 --> 00:42:18.320]  Mayors are calling for martial law in those cities like Schenectady.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.883]  And they did help arrest 2,000 people.
[00:42:21.883 --> 00:42:23.125]  That's the headline.
[00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:26.829]  And they're going after guns as well as part of that.
[00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:28.611]  But people are in denial.
[00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:31.374]  These same people would deny that the military was already being used.
[00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:38.623]  In law enforcement activities a few years ago, now that it's all admitted in mainstream news, they say, okay, that's fine, but Alex, you're a liar.
[00:42:38.623 --> 00:42:39.984]  What am I lying about?
[00:42:39.984 --> 00:42:41.304]  What have we been wrong about?
[00:42:41.304 --> 00:42:47.108]  We told you derivatives 11 years ago would cause the country to go bankrupt by design.
[00:42:47.108 --> 00:42:49.249]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:42:49.249 --> 00:42:51.590]  We told you they lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.271]  Now it's admitted.
[00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:57.601]  We told you that the CIA was protecting the Taliban and Al Qaeda and growing the opium.
[00:42:57.601 --> 00:42:58.641]  Now it's admitted.
[00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:02.082]  I mean, what else do you have to see come true that we discuss?
[00:43:02.082 --> 00:43:03.763]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:03.763 --> 00:43:06.204]  You can know what you're talking about.
[00:43:06.204 --> 00:43:15.307]  You can become just as informed as I am if you'll actually start researching history and how the Pentagon has taken over countless nations.
[00:43:15.307 --> 00:43:18.949]  What's the number one danger in history, whether it was Rome 2,000 years ago or Babylon 2,500 years ago?
[00:43:23.717 --> 00:43:28.153]  What was the greatest threat in Alexander the Great's time?
[00:43:28.153 --> 00:43:28.675]  His father.
[00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.371]  was killed in a coup d'etat.
[00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:36.716]  He was only a Macedonian king, not one of the full kings from Southern Greece.
[00:43:36.716 --> 00:43:38.698]  They had regional kings at the time.
[00:43:38.698 --> 00:43:54.071]  And his father, at a military inspection, one of the Greeks who supported another rival family, there when he was inspecting thousands of troops, because they were in the middle of a war, threw a javelin through the heart of Alexander the Great's father.
[00:43:54.943 --> 00:44:09.057]  And there was a military coup, but then they fought that off and Alexander got back into control and then realized that he had to go ahead and conquer all of Greece to secure his area because there were rival clans always trying to overthrow Macedonia.
[00:44:09.057 --> 00:44:10.719]  What's the number one threat in the third world?
[00:44:10.719 --> 00:44:14.523]  What are you always hearing about in Africa and poor areas of Asia and Latin America?
[00:44:14.523 --> 00:44:16.625]  Every couple of months you hear about a military coup.
[00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:18.347]  I mean, they're going on constantly.
[00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:30.838]  Because if you've got a group with the weapons, and you've got a group that's in control of the intelligence, and you've got a group that's got the funding, they're going to overthrow your government.
[00:44:30.838 --> 00:44:32.760]  But it's more sophisticated than that here.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.464]  You've got this offshore corporate group that's engaged in all these takeovers.
[00:44:37.464 --> 00:44:40.506]  They use our military as their muscle.
[00:44:40.506 --> 00:44:41.807]  They brainwash the troops.
[00:44:43.052 --> 00:44:51.354]  They have gotten their Rhodes Scholars and their Council on Foreign Relations and their Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs Generals.
[00:44:51.354 --> 00:45:02.337]  Look at where McChrystal and look at where Petraeus, Petraeus and all of these people, I call him Petraeus so much now that's his actual name in my mind.
[00:45:04.298 --> 00:45:04.398]  They
[00:45:21.997 --> 00:45:31.725]  And are put into a higher position of power, and they end up being on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the heads of CENTCOM, or NORTHCOM, or SOUTHCOM, or AFRICOM, AFRICOR.
[00:45:31.725 --> 00:45:32.325]  All of this.
[00:45:32.325 --> 00:45:33.386]  This is how they govern.
[00:45:33.386 --> 00:45:34.928]  This is how they control.
[00:45:34.928 --> 00:45:37.790]  And so, they know the American people.
[00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:47.117]  They know the only threat to this global, corporate, illegitimate, criminal, treasonous, treacherous takeover of our country, that is the New World Order, is the American people taking their states back.
[00:45:48.075 --> 00:45:51.219]  And get in control of the federal government that way.
[00:45:51.219 --> 00:45:55.365]  That's why they can't let Arizona fix the problem with the open borders and the crime wave.
[00:45:55.365 --> 00:45:59.010]  That's why they want the states bankrupt under federal control.
[00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:03.456]  That's why they want the states always with unfunded mandates to not be able to pay their bills.
[00:46:03.456 --> 00:46:04.999]  Federally unfunded mandates.
[00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:08.072]  That's the goal!
[00:46:08.072 --> 00:46:10.355]  That's how they took down all these third world countries.
[00:46:10.355 --> 00:46:20.586]  We have the IMF World Bank plans from 2002, how they've done this to countless nations, and how they were planning it in Europe, the United States, England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada.
[00:46:20.586 --> 00:46:21.828]  And now it's happening!
[00:46:21.828 --> 00:46:26.112]  I mean, if I have their actual blueprints, if I have their actual battle plans,
[00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:30.152]  How am I not supposed to come up here and warn you?
[00:46:30.152 --> 00:46:32.313]  I'm not that smart.
[00:46:32.313 --> 00:46:33.434]  I've learned history.
[00:46:33.434 --> 00:46:34.454]  I've studied history.
[00:46:34.454 --> 00:46:37.696]  How governments operate, how elites operate, how they do it.
[00:46:37.696 --> 00:46:48.881]  And the number one threat is any corrupt elite coming in and buying off your government, buying off your military, promising them even more power if they help have a overthrow of the country.
[00:46:50.066 --> 00:46:54.809]  And if you look at England, if you look at Australia, if you look at Canada, look at the United States, it's all the same.
[00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:56.030]  You see the same articles.
[00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:12.322]  Oh, to help with security and to bolster security right now at the G20, or in Toronto, or in Illinois, or in California, oh, we're gonna have army out at checkpoints.
[00:47:12.322 --> 00:47:16.445]  And you see the same stories written the same way everywhere.
[00:47:16.445 --> 00:47:17.726]  And they're shake and bake articles.
[00:47:19.195 --> 00:47:29.347]  No matter how many times you buy the same pancake mix and it says take two eggs and this much milk and stir it up and then put it on the griddle.
[00:47:30.643 --> 00:47:34.904]  These articles are like box pancakes.
[00:47:34.904 --> 00:47:45.388]  It doesn't matter if it's Australia, England, Northern Ireland, the United States, Germany, it's the same report over and over and over and over again.
[00:47:45.388 --> 00:47:48.128]  Just the names are changed, the names of the towns are changed.
[00:47:48.128 --> 00:47:52.690]  This is a strategic, creeping death takeover of our society.
[00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:08.693]  Now I want to go to Joe and John and Redneck and Vic and JG and others here in just a moment.
[00:48:08.693 --> 00:48:20.219]  And we're going to take calls to the bottom of the next hour and then I'm going to cover
[00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.633]  Governor's voice grave concern over immigration.
[00:48:24.633 --> 00:48:29.057]  The latest on the immigration developments and the states' rights fight in Arizona.
[00:48:29.057 --> 00:48:30.559]  I'm going to get into the economy.
[00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:32.721]  I'm going to get into LeBron Nation.
[00:48:32.721 --> 00:48:35.744]  Americans hypnotized as country collapses.
[00:48:35.744 --> 00:48:40.749]  Key new article by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:42.073 --> 00:48:49.159]  Then I'm going to get into these newscasts from around the country where they openly roll out martial law by stealth.
[00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:51.801]  They're not going to announce martial law overnight.
[00:48:51.801 --> 00:48:55.243]  They're just going to incrementally do it.
[00:48:55.243 --> 00:49:05.672]  You understand that in the late 90s, I interviewed on air Thomas Sanchez, emergency manager, Ale Philip, a chief of police, San Antonio, countless people.
[00:49:06.961 --> 00:49:20.309]  And we would send cameramen, or I would go, and I would have Marines and Army walk up to me, and my cameramen would, with their guns, in Main Street, USA, and say, you turn your camera off.
[00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:25.092]  I've had the Army, with Marines, do it in Belton, Texas.
[00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:32.376]  I've witnessed our camera guys in Brooksville, Florida, this happened to us.
[00:49:33.855 --> 00:49:39.643]  I have got the footage of it happening in Hebron, Maryland, in Swansboro.
[00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.945]  The list goes on and on.
[00:49:40.945 --> 00:49:44.249]  You haven't experienced the tyranny until you've been there.
[00:49:44.249 --> 00:49:45.250]  I mean, I tried to cover
[00:49:46.325 --> 00:50:02.857]  Brooksville, Florida and announced I was going to cover an urban warfare takeover drill because people inside the army had told me that this was a practice takeover drill of the airport, the local municipal airport with the local police, a roundup drill.
[00:50:02.857 --> 00:50:04.438]  And I got there and we interviewed people.
[00:50:04.438 --> 00:50:10.502]  This is in police state to the takeover and I'm walking around in neighborhoods in Brooksville, Florida and women come out and go, yeah, are you Alex Jones?
[00:50:10.502 --> 00:50:13.905]  The army came and knocked on my door and said, don't talk to you.
[00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:21.156]  That you are a dangerous kook.
[00:50:21.156 --> 00:50:26.519]  And then, I'm sitting there trying to videotape through the municipal airport fence at night, totally legal.
[00:50:27.438 --> 00:50:33.642]  And they have a special forces guy jump out of the bushes and start trying to light fires, blaming me for it.
[00:50:33.642 --> 00:50:35.783]  And I've got to start stomping them out.
[00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:39.506]  And I've got to physically begin restraining the person from doing it.
[00:50:39.506 --> 00:50:42.547]  I mean, these people are jumping out with lighters.
[00:50:42.547 --> 00:50:45.809]  Troops in plain clothes, jumping out with lighters, lighting fires.
[00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.871]  These are terrorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:47.871 --> 00:50:51.373]  They have been trained to engage in black ops against the American people.
[00:50:53.476 --> 00:50:55.119]  Because they're going to take your pension funds.
[00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:56.481]  They're going to loot this country.
[00:50:56.481 --> 00:50:58.524]  We're being militarily conquered.
[00:50:58.524 --> 00:50:59.205]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.205 --> 00:50:59.605]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:07.183]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:02.082 --> 00:52:07.045]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:07.045 --> 00:52:08.045]  What have we got?
[00:52:08.045 --> 00:52:10.486]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:10.486 --> 00:52:11.507]  A republic.
[00:52:11.507 --> 00:52:14.148]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:14.148 --> 00:52:16.409]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:16.409 --> 00:52:18.430]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:24.013]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[00:52:24.013 --> 00:52:27.655]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:28.015 --> 00:52:31.718]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.718 --> 00:52:32.979]  You're being warned.
[00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:34.000]  We have the facts.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.161]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:35.161 --> 00:52:36.081]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:36.081 --> 00:52:36.962]  We have common law.
[00:52:36.962 --> 00:52:39.484]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:39.484 --> 00:52:42.426]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:43.267]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:43.387 --> 00:52:48.329]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:48.329 --> 00:52:49.830]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:50.910]  Don't tread on me.

[00:53:01.994 --> 00:53:11.219]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:53:11.219 --> 00:53:14.781]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:53:14.781 --> 00:53:24.367]  Introducing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.

[00:53:57.674 --> 00:54:00.535]  You look like an angel.
[00:54:00.535 --> 00:54:06.158]  Walk like an angel.
[00:54:06.158 --> 00:54:07.759]  Talk like an angel.
[00:54:21.647 --> 00:54:27.850]  All right, we're going to your phone calls here in a moment, but I just want to make it clear.
[00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:31.591]  A lot of people say, I don't care if they have military checkpoints.
[00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:32.992]  I don't care if they search my car.
[00:54:32.992 --> 00:54:35.713]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:54:35.713 --> 00:54:43.337]  Ladies and gentlemen, I see reports every week where police pull somebody over with guns in their trunk, even in places like Texas, and they're not illegal.
[00:54:43.337 --> 00:54:45.638]  And the cops just go ahead and arrest you and take the guns.
[00:54:45.638 --> 00:54:48.739]  You never even get them back, even when you sue them.
[00:54:50.037 --> 00:54:52.478]  Remember Katrina?
[00:54:52.478 --> 00:54:56.760]  Remember what happened there?
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:06.185]  The establishment hasn't had a 20 plus year secret program to merge the police and the military and to train them to work together against the people for nothing.
[00:55:07.796 --> 00:55:13.581]  The globalists took over this society a long time ago, and they said, why don't we just use the US as an engine for global domination?
[00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:16.904]  They said, well, why don't we just start robbing the people blind?
[00:55:16.904 --> 00:55:18.305]  Well, they'll get angry.
[00:55:18.305 --> 00:55:19.046]  They'll get upset.
[00:55:19.046 --> 00:55:20.827]  They could take the states back.
[00:55:20.827 --> 00:55:23.410]  We'll just get the states in debt.
[00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.851]  Buy them off.
[00:55:24.851 --> 00:55:27.393]  We'll federalize local police by stealth.
[00:55:28.567 --> 00:55:32.269]  And then we'll stage terror attacks as a pretext to clamp down on the public.
[00:55:32.269 --> 00:55:34.851]  And the public will be told we're doing this for their safety.
[00:55:34.851 --> 00:55:35.712]  Okay.
[00:55:35.712 --> 00:55:36.232]  Let's do it.
[00:55:36.232 --> 00:55:38.213]  Just as long as we don't get caught.
[00:55:38.213 --> 00:55:39.914]  Just as long as we're in control.
[00:55:39.914 --> 00:55:40.675]  We're in control.
[00:55:40.675 --> 00:55:41.815]  Let's do it.
[00:55:41.815 --> 00:55:45.198]  Hell, look how many countries we've overthrown using this army.
[00:55:45.198 --> 00:55:47.879]  We'll do it here in the U.S.
[00:55:47.879 --> 00:55:53.323]  That's the new world order in a nutshell.
[00:55:53.323 --> 00:55:55.144]  And none of us are safe, my friends.
[00:55:57.159 --> 00:55:58.179]  None of us are safe.
[00:55:58.179 --> 00:56:00.860]  It is time to wake up to these realities.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:07.661]  It's time to wake up to these facts now and understand just how serious, just how serious this really is.

[01:00:18.786 --> 01:00:23.489]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:27.210]  It's hour number two on this Monday, the 12th day of July, 2010.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.424]  And we are going to be going to your phone calls momentarily here.
[01:00:33.424 --> 01:00:44.315]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to start going over a ton of economic news, police state news, land grabbing news, but also a lot of great people are starting to counter all of this.
[01:00:44.315 --> 01:00:48.499]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:51.883]  Let's go ahead and speak to Joe in Texas.
[01:00:51.883 --> 01:00:52.544]  Joe, welcome.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.921]  Hello Alex, are you sir?
[01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:56.161]  Good!
[01:00:56.161 --> 01:01:00.384]  Uh, Alex, I, uh, this is Gunsmith up in Hill, your fellow Hill Country member.
[01:01:00.384 --> 01:01:10.109]  I, I wanted to, you know, the Bible says in two witnesses confirmation, and because of you, uh, I use a lot of discernment.
[01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:14.592]  Um, my sister has bought some property up here in Hill Country, lives in Beaumont.
[01:01:14.592 --> 01:01:20.415]  The reason I called Alex is she had a DirecTV installation installed.
[01:01:21.312 --> 01:01:28.474]  And the man who installed it just got back, had been back for three months from Iraq, had done three years.
[01:01:28.474 --> 01:01:30.675]  Communication specialist.
[01:01:30.675 --> 01:01:34.235]  The man told me, we were talking, we were sharing horror stories.
[01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:39.977]  I was telling him about Central and South America, Manuel Noriega, all of that.
[01:01:39.977 --> 01:01:47.099]  He was telling me that he was, that Iraq is under martial law.
[01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:47.639]  His words.
[01:01:48.467 --> 01:01:52.330]  He also said that two of his friends were in this stop-loss thing.
[01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.773]  They got back and they turned around and sent them to Afghanistan.
[01:01:56.773 --> 01:02:04.958]  A man that spent three years with him in Iraq is now back and is in the National Guard Reserve.
[01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:05.819]  He called him.
[01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:08.901]  He quoted to me this three days ago.
[01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:17.367]  I'm sorry, it was on Thursday, Alex, last week, that his friend stated to him, they are gearing up for
[01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:24.024]  Uh, Marshall Law and from Texas City to Florida.
[01:02:24.024 --> 01:02:26.685]  They already have the tents.
[01:02:26.685 --> 01:02:31.547]  Confirming what you said about putting these tents in stadiums.
[01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:38.810]  His words that they are talking about evacuation from the coastline, 50 miles inland.
[01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:40.891]  They are geared up for it.
[01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:41.831]  His friend's words.
[01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.613]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:07.136 --> 01:03:17.658]  His friend stated to him in the service, the man's name is Greg, I have his home phone number, really nice man, said that they do have tents in place to put in stadiums.
[01:03:29.981 --> 01:03:30.662]  As a drill.
[01:03:47.922 --> 01:03:51.608]  After I take this round of calls, come on in, Du.
[01:03:51.608 --> 01:03:55.533]  Du, what sports stadium was that they had the civil unrest in Chicago?
[01:03:55.533 --> 01:03:56.414]  Toyota Park.
[01:03:56.414 --> 01:03:57.135]  Toyota Park.
[01:03:57.135 --> 01:03:57.656]  Yeah.
[01:03:57.656 --> 01:04:00.761]  And also doing stuff at a giant, Soldier Field.
[01:04:00.761 --> 01:04:01.401]  Soldier Field.
[01:04:01.401 --> 01:04:03.665]  Was another one, but Toyota Park was where we were at and filmed.
[01:04:03.945 --> 01:04:05.266]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:06.506]  And I mean, they just admit this.
[01:04:06.506 --> 01:04:11.548]  So, I mean, I've been there and I've read all the press releases by the military.
[01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:15.470]  They train with foreign troops to take your families, take your kids.
[01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:17.311]  They put the women in one area, the men in another.
[01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:18.131]  They take your kids.
[01:04:18.131 --> 01:04:19.952]  The CPS has their way with them.
[01:04:19.952 --> 01:04:21.393]  The military just... And folks,
[01:04:22.338 --> 01:04:24.220]  And we're so trained to worship the military.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.802]  The military, it's like Nazi Germany.
[01:04:26.802 --> 01:04:32.167]  The German soldiers, by and large, weren't bad, but their leader, Adolf A. Louis Hitler, was bad.
[01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:35.090]  I'm sure the Russian army wasn't bad, but Stalin was bad.
[01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:40.034]  And, I mean, I'm sorry, a Russian soldier tries to take, I mean, what else did he say?
[01:04:40.034 --> 01:04:43.097]  I mean, did he say his friend was concerned about this joke?
[01:04:43.097 --> 01:04:44.879]  He said, Alex, that it's
[01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:46.661]  Stay there, stay there Joe.
[01:04:46.661 --> 01:04:49.885]  I'm going to come back to you because I want to break this down.

[01:08:10.683 --> 01:08:12.324]  Okay, Joe in Texas.
[01:08:12.324 --> 01:08:13.485]  We're going back to him in a moment.
[01:08:13.485 --> 01:08:13.905]  Not yet.
[01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:16.527]  We're going to other calls.
[01:08:16.527 --> 01:08:21.430]  He called in and said that a man was installing a satellite system at their house.
[01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.631]  He'd been in Iraq three years.
[01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:27.074]  He talked to his buddy, who's in the National Guard, just rotated back from Iraq.
[01:08:28.226 --> 01:08:41.414]  And that they are preparing for martial law from Texas City, and they've been taking the cameras of reporters south of Houston, a PBS reporter last week, from Texas City all the way to the Keys.
[01:08:41.414 --> 01:08:42.835]  Martial law.
[01:08:42.835 --> 01:08:54.342]  It's already martial law when they say it's a federal felony to videotape the police and military, and you have the general, the admiral, in charge of the Coast Guard saying that a week and a half ago.
[01:08:54.342 --> 01:08:55.803]  We read the quotes, we played the clips.
[01:08:57.116 --> 01:08:58.096]  That is martial law.
[01:08:58.096 --> 01:09:00.137]  They just don't tell you it's martial law.
[01:09:00.137 --> 01:09:05.158]  Martial law is rolling up to a checkpoint, and Austin police taking blood without warrants.
[01:09:05.158 --> 01:09:09.880]  That's in the news today, and they say they're going to videotape while they take your blood.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.260]  And that's a federal grant.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.801]  Your police being under federal control is martial law.
[01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:15.421]  But it's a continuum.
[01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:18.482]  Martial law is a graph, okay?
[01:09:18.482 --> 01:09:21.763]  And that's that article I wrote with Ed Homan 12 years ago.
[01:09:21.763 --> 01:09:24.264]  Martial law is here, and it's a three on the Richter scale.
[01:09:25.236 --> 01:09:27.357]  But guys, Google that article, see if we can pull it up.
[01:09:27.357 --> 01:09:29.159]  It's in an old InfoWars format.
[01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:32.221]  Martial Law, and it's a three on the Richter scale.
[01:09:32.221 --> 01:09:37.765]  And I show Army Checkpoint, regular Army, in Belton.
[01:09:37.765 --> 01:09:42.208]  And then again, years later in 2000, I went up there and the troops came up and said, you were here before!
[01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:43.369]  Get out of here!
[01:09:43.369 --> 01:09:46.611]  And then Marines came over and started trying to threaten us.
[01:09:48.786 --> 01:09:49.227]  I don't
[01:10:11.653 --> 01:10:12.854]  That they have set up.
[01:10:12.854 --> 01:10:24.303]  The main thing that they have deployed is battle plans in every city and even small towns to use your soccer field, your football stadium, these Walmart distribution centers.
[01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:28.086]  I was told that many years before I then saw mainstream articles.
[01:10:28.086 --> 01:10:31.929]  You know, you get intel, you don't know if it's real, but you file it.
[01:10:31.929 --> 01:10:39.635]  And then you see an article, Walmart says during a flu outbreak, they've done a deal with Homeland Security to use distribution centers as places for people to be held,
[01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:47.302]  I mean, you just do this day after day, you get a very clear crystal clear picture.
[01:10:47.302 --> 01:10:50.263]  But now I don't have to have a crystal clear picture for my own intel.
[01:10:50.263 --> 01:10:52.504]  It's all out in the open.
[01:10:52.504 --> 01:10:54.866]  Now, let me say this.
[01:10:54.866 --> 01:10:59.308]  This is so important, and please listen to me carefully, please.
[01:10:59.308 --> 01:11:05.792]  Remember in January of last year, we had the interview with the emergency manager from Indiana.
[01:11:06.747 --> 01:11:20.761]  It came out in several newspapers there that emergency managers in Illinois and Indiana didn't know why they were being told flu will be horrible this year, millions will die, there will be martial law.
[01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:22.743]  This was in 2009.
[01:11:22.743 --> 01:11:31.111]  Now this is two plus months before in the middle of April, the out of season, wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year, flu showed up and you're gonna, I'm gonna connect this in a moment.
[01:11:32.628 --> 01:11:47.144]  In the wrong time of year, wrong hemisphere, everything, this novel flu with no genealogy, with no family tree, because flu has a genetic history, just shows up out of nowhere.
[01:11:47.144 --> 01:11:51.849]  The media admits that this was engineered, that this was manufactured somehow.
[01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:52.550]  Now, let's go back.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.481]  I get intel out of Indiana.
[01:11:56.481 --> 01:11:58.061]  Then I get intel out of California.
[01:11:58.061 --> 01:12:00.241]  Then I get intel out of Arizona.
[01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:03.142]  Then I get intel out of New York.
[01:12:03.142 --> 01:12:12.525]  And that was the last key piece I got when I went red level on air and started saying emergency, emergency, emergency in January and February and March and then into April.
[01:12:12.525 --> 01:12:13.465]  So three months before.
[01:12:14.275 --> 01:12:18.438]  Remember every day I said red alert, red alert, flu is coming, flu is coming.
[01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:20.559]  We don't know if this is going to be a real flu.
[01:12:20.559 --> 01:12:35.108]  We don't know if it's going to be a binary weapon or a tracker simulant because I've seen documents about them having an H1N1 simulant attenuated virus that they had quote released to track how flu would spread.
[01:12:35.108 --> 01:12:41.952]  We weren't sure but we had all these key pieces and we knew that all over the country police were being trained for martial law.
[01:12:42.893 --> 01:12:43.033]  I don't
[01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:02.488]  I think?
[01:13:23.146 --> 01:13:23.626]  We're good to go.
[01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:53.772]  A Bureau of Cemeteries, Department of Cemeteries plan in New York State for millions of dead.
[01:13:53.772 --> 01:13:57.914]  They were going to all the main cemeteries and saying, can you bury 100,000 here from flu?
[01:13:57.914 --> 01:14:00.496]  Can you bury a half million from flu here?
[01:14:00.496 --> 01:14:01.516]  There it is.
[01:14:01.516 --> 01:14:06.259]  Plans for mass graves confirmed, government survey, cemetery readiness for flu outbreak.
[01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:10.361]  And guys, scroll down and click on the actual documents for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:12.803]  If you're a radio listener, you can just search engine that term.
[01:14:14.025 --> 01:14:15.246]  Division of Cemeteries.
[01:14:15.246 --> 01:14:17.807]  Okay, I was calling it Bureau, going from memory.
[01:14:17.807 --> 01:14:21.349]  State of New York, Department of Division of Cemeteries.
[01:14:21.349 --> 01:14:26.651]  Okay, so that's preparing for mass flu outbreaks and mass death, okay?
[01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:34.976]  And then, I off-air talked to sources in several other states, confirming they'd received these letters in 2007, eight, and nine.
[01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:38.557]  But in nine, they told them, we are going to have this.
[01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:39.958]  This is going to happen.
[01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:41.419]  Flu will break out this year.
[01:14:41.419 --> 01:14:43.360]  Now, this is months before
[01:14:44.485 --> 01:14:51.251]  This novel flu out of left field just shows up and pops up, okay?
[01:14:51.251 --> 01:15:00.539]  Now, I said on air, I said I don't know if this is gonna be a real outbreak, I don't know how deadly it's gonna be, but in the training they're doing with local police,
[01:15:02.281 --> 01:15:15.404]  They're having them harden their police stations, harden their sheriff's departments, harden their emergency management centers and fire departments for IED attacks and terror attacks.
[01:15:15.404 --> 01:15:18.244]  Now, why would small towns be needing to do this?
[01:15:18.244 --> 01:15:22.725]  Well, this is if society completely collapses, which the banks have done by design.
[01:15:22.725 --> 01:15:25.266]  90% of people were self-sufficient in the Great Depression.
[01:15:25.266 --> 01:15:29.707]  At least 7 million starved to death conservatively in university studies over that decade.
[01:15:29.707 --> 01:15:30.547]  Now 90% are urban.
[01:15:31.943 --> 01:15:36.887]  Less than the 10% that are rural, around half of those are self-sufficient.
[01:15:36.887 --> 01:15:42.791]  So we have millions starving to death and dying in graves of wrath with 90% self-sufficient.
[01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:47.034]  Now with 90 plus percent that aren't self-sufficient, what's gonna happen?
[01:15:47.034 --> 01:15:49.456]  You understand what's being set up here?
[01:15:49.456 --> 01:15:50.736]  Now this is being looked at.
[01:15:50.736 --> 01:15:53.358]  This is a current battle plan they've got.
[01:15:53.358 --> 01:15:55.400]  But that doesn't mean this will be implemented.
[01:15:57.065 --> 01:16:07.631]  And I said, they're using this flu as a martial law takeover screen, as a martial law template rationalization, a cover story, an excuse.
[01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:09.452]  I've learned how they operate.
[01:16:09.452 --> 01:16:12.934]  And then when the flu popped up, we said, we don't know if this is going to be deadly or not.
[01:16:12.934 --> 01:16:20.399]  But they went in and told doctors nationwide and state emergency managers that it was going to be all these hundreds of thousands dead and was going to be martial law.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.982]  to further hype the fear in April.
[01:16:23.982 --> 01:16:46.054]  But because we exposed the fact that it was a manufactured flu, because we pointed out that the people were not really getting sick and this was manufactured hype, because we pointed out the fact that most people dying had already had the regular seasonal flu shot and that that was what was killing them, because that information got out, they had to back off the program and didn't go ahead with it.
[01:16:46.054 --> 01:16:48.636]  Now, if you analyze this oil spill,
[01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:56.749]  And the way they gave orders to the well operators that they knew would cause it to come in early and fail.
[01:16:56.749 --> 01:17:00.192]  And the way they blocked the response in the Gulf the last 83 days.
[01:17:00.192 --> 01:17:02.814]  Now 84 days today.
[01:17:02.814 --> 01:17:05.257]  And the way they wouldn't let locals deal with it.
[01:17:05.257 --> 01:17:09.120]  And the way that they've been blocking any coverage of it.
[01:17:10.256 --> 01:17:23.766]  And now the intel is flooding in from Marines and Army people that indeed this is true and that martial law is being prepared in the Gulf States.
[01:17:23.766 --> 01:17:31.412]  And then that will be the perfect cover story with this hysteria, with this breakdown of society going into the November election.
[01:17:32.622 --> 01:17:36.186]  For Obama to make everybody forget about government takeover of healthcare.
[01:17:36.186 --> 01:17:38.368]  And forget about the Arizona situation.
[01:17:38.368 --> 01:17:40.631]  And forget about everything that's happening.
[01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:42.853]  And so they can launch a war with Iran.
[01:17:42.853 --> 01:17:54.006]  So they could perhaps even suspend the election or use it as a smoke screen to divert people during the election if they use the electronic voting machines in Nationwide that have been proven to be fraudulent.
[01:17:55.796 --> 01:18:01.679]  But if we get the word out about what's happening, there's a good chance they may back off because they're listening with the NSA.
[01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:04.000]  They're tracking what citizens are saying and doing.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.181]  They know if the public's going to buy into something or not.
[01:18:07.181 --> 01:18:10.022]  So clearly, this is a staged event in the Gulf.
[01:18:10.022 --> 01:18:13.064]  Clearly, martial law is already in effect there.
[01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:17.046]  The Washington Post and others are talking about forced mass evacuations.
[01:18:17.046 --> 01:18:18.146]  Now, Joe, you've got a minute and a half.
[01:18:18.146 --> 01:18:19.707]  We're going to come back with our calls.
[01:18:19.707 --> 01:18:22.248]  But finish up any other points that this source told you.
[01:18:23.471 --> 01:18:31.953]  Uh, the only other thing they said, Alex, was like every one of these facilities and these stadiums would be, they would be, tents would be in there.
[01:18:31.953 --> 01:18:39.274]  They would have medical facilities inside, or medical tents, inside the, the, uh, stadiums.
[01:18:39.274 --> 01:18:48.596]  And that, what, what started the whole conversation with this veteran, fellow veteran, Alex, was, he said, uh, that they've got martial law in Iraq.
[01:18:49.316 --> 01:18:52.818]  And he said, just like they're going to do here, and I said, well, what do you mean?
[01:18:52.818 --> 01:19:08.545]  And that's when he told me about his fellow Army buddy that he had talked to that stated this to them, and they would be, they are on standby right now, and that they would be having live ammunition on.
[01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:17.849]  And what concerns me, Alex, is that I'm looking at this whole oil thing as a big front, just like you do.
[01:19:17.849 --> 01:19:21.831]  And I don't think you're a psychic, Alex, but I will say this, brother.
[01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:26.514]  You do have spiritual discernment, and I'm grateful for that, brother.
[01:19:26.514 --> 01:19:29.595]  And that's about really all the man had told me.
[01:19:29.595 --> 01:19:31.936]  He lives in San Antonio, Texas.
[01:19:31.936 --> 01:19:32.837]  His name is Greg.
[01:19:33.553 --> 01:19:35.154]  And he did state this to me.
[01:19:35.154 --> 01:19:42.721]  And it has me concerned because I don't think it's over the oil spill, Alex.
[01:19:42.721 --> 01:19:48.125]  And he told me to tell my sister she better go ahead and sell her house in Beaumont, Texas.
[01:20:02.108 --> 01:20:11.633]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:20:11.633 --> 01:20:12.954]  My name is Crystal.

[01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:19.837]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:20:19.837 --> 01:20:23.799]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:20:23.979 --> 01:20:24.800]  What did Crystal do?
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:28.765]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:20:28.765 --> 01:20:35.172]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[01:23:01.245 --> 01:23:04.607]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:04.607 --> 01:23:08.529]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:08.529 --> 01:23:12.251]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:19.374]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[01:23:19.434 --> 01:23:19.834]  I think so.
[01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:34.811]  I think so.
[01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:10.865]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:24:10.865 --> 01:24:11.905]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:24:11.905 --> 01:24:28.118]  Now just like they went all over the country telling police, harden your facilities, the American people are about to attack you during a flu collapse.
[01:24:29.446 --> 01:24:44.129]  In the months before they launched the fake flu attack out of Mexico last year, they may not declare martial law with the troops, or they may not actively implement it in a wider area.
[01:24:44.129 --> 01:24:47.029]  Right now it's just on the coastline, and it is martial law.
[01:24:47.029 --> 01:24:55.811]  When they come up and tell you don't videotape police, don't videotape National Guard, don't videotape the relief effort, that is the First Amendment being suspended.
[01:24:55.811 --> 01:24:57.251]  That's the heart of martial law.
[01:24:59.417 --> 01:25:04.419]  They may just use all this fear in the Gulf to artificially drive down property values.
[01:25:04.419 --> 01:25:07.980]  They may use it as a pretext to have a military presence there.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:17.784]  Or they may be going for martial law, as the Gulf being the kickoff during a financial collapse, and blame the financial collapse on the Gulf.
[01:25:17.784 --> 01:25:24.666]  It's certainly a contributing factor, but it's almost like just a complication infection from the main disease.
[01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:26.187]  Now, I'm gonna talk to Redneck Vic
[01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:28.599]  I don't think so.
[01:25:50.914 --> 01:25:52.335]  I guess we should just get past the fear.
[01:25:52.335 --> 01:25:57.238]  I'm just saying that they are listening to everything that's admitted, and a lot of people are scared to call.
[01:25:57.238 --> 01:25:59.859]  I've been told that on the street by military.
[01:25:59.859 --> 01:26:02.720]  But are you being told you're preparing for martial law?
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:08.563]  We've gotten so much intel with the people's names and the rest of it, but they say we can't use their names.
[01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:14.426]  But I would specifically like to hear from you about if you're being trained for martial law in the Gulf.
[01:26:14.426 --> 01:26:15.267]  We know snipers,
[01:26:16.287 --> 01:26:19.488]  We know civil unrest, MPs are being sent to the Gulf.
[01:26:19.488 --> 01:26:21.609]  That's confirmed, but I'd like to get your calls on that.
[01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:22.109]  800-259-9231.
[01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:22.409]  800-259-9231.
[01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:36.135]  So when I finish up with these five callers, we're going to leave the phones open for military only, or police, who've got any intel on this.
[01:26:36.135 --> 01:26:39.136]  They're keeping it highly compartmentalized, but this is important.
[01:26:39.136 --> 01:26:44.778]  And this may be the crisis that the Obama handlers are going to use, because their entire agenda is collapsing.
[01:26:45.578 --> 01:26:49.640]  And so they may use a new war, martial law, you name it.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.682]  Staged terror attacks as a pretext to keep their agenda going.
[01:26:53.682 --> 01:26:55.303]  Let's talk to Redneck in Mississippi.
[01:26:55.303 --> 01:26:56.844]  Go ahead, Redneck.
[01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.305]  Hey, what's going on, Mr. Jones?
[01:26:58.305 --> 01:26:59.465]  How you doing this afternoon?
[01:26:59.465 --> 01:26:59.706]  Good.
[01:26:59.706 --> 01:27:00.566]  Worldwide broadcast.
[01:27:00.566 --> 01:27:01.887]  What's on your mind?
[01:27:01.887 --> 01:27:09.691]  Well, I tell you, I got a little solution that people can think into as far as how this economy is going in the down spiral here.
[01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:11.532]  Old technology called gasification.
[01:27:11.532 --> 01:27:13.713]  Have you ever heard about it or familiar with it?
[01:27:14.915 --> 01:27:17.116]  Yes, but why don't you fill us in?
[01:27:17.116 --> 01:27:26.622]  Alright, well, I know back in World War II, Europe was basically a wood gas-fired area of the world, you know, because of the oil shortages and whatnot.
[01:27:26.622 --> 01:27:31.485]  And basically, it's very simple.
[01:27:31.485 --> 01:27:43.952]  You pyrolyze, through pyrolysis, without actually burning the wood, you actually heat it up and draw off carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogens, stuff like that, and you can use that gas
[01:27:44.608 --> 01:27:49.031]  On internal combustion engines, heating boilers.
[01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:01.369]  Here's the headline.
[01:28:01.369 --> 01:28:10.192]  In the heat wave, the case against air conditioning, this is the globalists seizing all forms of energy and making it illegal for you to be self-sufficient.
[01:28:10.192 --> 01:28:11.513]  This is siege.
[01:28:11.513 --> 01:28:13.074]  But I appreciate your call, Redneck.
[01:28:13.074 --> 01:28:19.416]  Yes, there are many ways for us to power our society, and all of it is being blocked right now by the globalists.
[01:28:19.416 --> 01:28:20.736]  This is a takeover.
[01:28:20.736 --> 01:28:22.997]  They are seizing the energy supplies.
[01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:26.518]  And they're going to use this oil spill to try to nationalize the oil companies.
[01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:27.979]  Vic and Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.362]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:28:31.362 --> 01:28:32.242]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:28:32.242 --> 01:28:34.284]  Yes, I can.
[01:28:34.284 --> 01:28:35.385]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:28:35.385 --> 01:28:37.367]  We appreciate your work.
[01:28:37.367 --> 01:28:42.812]  I have followed a lot of this for many years since the 70s, but that's not the reason I called.
[01:28:42.812 --> 01:28:46.215]  I called to give you a very, very special alert.
[01:28:46.215 --> 01:28:55.523]  I'm a Christian, and very simply, I've received word in the spirit that there will be shortly an assassination attempt on your life.
[01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:58.050]  I was just simply calling to let you know.
[01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:03.114]  I saw it in the spirit, and I'm asking all our brothers and sisters out there to pray for you.
[01:29:03.114 --> 01:29:09.119]  It will occur just before the United States is totally locked down into martial law.
[01:29:09.119 --> 01:29:10.340]  And that's all I wanted to tell you.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:11.781]  God bless you.
[01:29:11.781 --> 01:29:13.062]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:29:13.062 --> 01:29:22.429]  You know, I don't... This morning I was exercising, and I just really realized the fact that the elite have
[01:29:23.516 --> 01:29:31.219]  Come to the perspective and understanding that this radio show and our work is a major affront to their operations.
[01:29:31.219 --> 01:29:35.461]  And they've not wanted to kill me in the past because they don't want to underline my work.
[01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:36.942]  They don't want to highlight it.
[01:29:36.942 --> 01:29:46.126]  But they understand that I'm becoming more focused and that my analysis is really having a big effect and that I think we're all entering a danger zone.
[01:29:46.126 --> 01:29:47.547]  So your prayers are needed.
[01:29:47.547 --> 01:29:50.088]  But whatever God's will is, that will be what happens.
[01:29:52.352 --> 01:29:56.275]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.275 --> 01:29:58.937]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.584 --> 01:30:06.127]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:06.127 --> 01:30:07.047]  Number 1.
[01:30:07.047 --> 01:30:10.469]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:10.469 --> 01:30:11.329]  Number 2.
[01:30:11.329 --> 01:30:16.212]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:16.212 --> 01:30:16.973]  It's true.
[01:30:16.973 --> 01:30:21.835]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.835 --> 01:30:22.656]  Number 3.
[01:30:22.656 --> 01:30:26.238]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:26.238 --> 01:30:29.960]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:30.941]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.941 --> 01:30:33.704]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:33.704 --> 01:30:37.388]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:37.388 --> 01:30:38.188]  Number 5.
[01:30:38.188 --> 01:30:42.333]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:47.098]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:47.378 --> 01:30:51.545]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:51.545 --> 01:30:53.328]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:53.328 --> 01:30:55.591]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:57.935]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.385 --> 01:31:05.567]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:05.567 --> 01:31:11.969]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:11.969 --> 01:31:19.351]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:19.351 --> 01:31:24.233]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:32.877 --> 01:31:36.600]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:31:37.153 --> 01:31:43.919]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:43.919 --> 01:31:47.802]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:31:47.802 --> 01:32:00.132]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler.
[01:32:00.132 --> 01:32:01.273]  Thank you.
[01:32:01.273 --> 01:32:04.075]  You may be arrested and or subject to
[01:32:05.336 --> 01:32:06.598]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:06.598 --> 01:32:10.482]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:10.482 --> 01:32:12.764]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.764 --> 01:32:18.650]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:24.897]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:25.297 --> 01:32:31.239]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:31.239 --> 01:32:35.440]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:39.741]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.741 --> 01:32:45.703]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:45.703 --> 01:32:49.244]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:49.244 --> 01:32:51.225]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:51.225 --> 01:32:51.645]  It's here.

[01:33:07.688 --> 01:33:11.949]  Okay, I'm opening the phones up specifically for military people.
[01:33:11.949 --> 01:33:14.950]  We'll do this throughout the next few days.
[01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:20.131]  Are you being trained and prepared for forced evacuations?
[01:33:20.131 --> 01:33:21.491]  They're not going to call it martial law.
[01:33:22.947 --> 01:33:26.328]  Anybody who's carried it out in Iraq or other areas knows what it is.
[01:33:26.328 --> 01:33:27.929]  It's just you have no rights.
[01:33:27.929 --> 01:33:30.170]  You're in a total police state.
[01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:32.350]  That's what martial law is.
[01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:39.273]  And the greatest extension of that is don't come outside your doors and the secret police going around and arresting people and putting bags over their heads.
[01:33:39.273 --> 01:33:50.657]  And whether it's England, Canada or the United States, every time they have an urban warfare drill or a special event like G20, they actually have private security people in plain clothes in front of news cameras
[01:33:51.517 --> 01:33:55.064]  Grabbing people, putting bags over their heads, and putting them in vehicles.
[01:33:55.064 --> 01:33:56.987]  And they're doing that just to acclimate you.
[01:33:56.987 --> 01:33:58.910]  Yeah, I've seen that on the news.
[01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:59.812]  What's the big deal?
[01:33:59.812 --> 01:34:01.635]  Private people putting bags over your heads.
[01:34:02.836 --> 01:34:06.720]  It's a PSYOP being done to condition you.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.182]  All of this is acclimation.
[01:34:08.182 --> 01:34:22.356]  Let's move quickly through your calls, because as soon as I've gone through J, G, Angie, and David, I think we've got some lines open right now, specifically for military or police that are being trained for forced evacuation.
[01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:23.777]  And again, that's starting to come out in the news.
[01:34:23.777 --> 01:34:25.880]  They may do this when the oil comes ashore.
[01:34:26.823 --> 01:34:29.425]  But the oil is going to come in in waves, not all at once.
[01:34:29.425 --> 01:34:31.606]  It can be cleaned up if they let them clean it up.
[01:34:31.606 --> 01:34:33.507]  I don't think an evacuation is needed.
[01:34:33.507 --> 01:34:35.449]  Maybe a few miles inland.
[01:34:35.449 --> 01:34:40.032]  But you know they're going to use this crisis to the maximum effect.
[01:34:40.032 --> 01:34:42.753]  Let's go ahead and go to JG in California.
[01:34:42.753 --> 01:34:43.294]  You're on the air.
[01:34:44.409 --> 01:34:45.630]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:48.192]  Some of my background has been in federal law enforcement.
[01:34:48.192 --> 01:34:56.738]  You know, Alex, in years past, we never had heard any idea of this kind of treason, you know, being peddled amongst federal or military.
[01:34:56.738 --> 01:35:07.686]  And some of my colleagues years ago, you know, down on the border had gotten bits and pieces of sightings, you know, of foreign personnel down there, you know, Cubans and Chinese looking like military troops.
[01:35:09.442 --> 01:35:21.669]  I just can't believe that you're saying already that the Marines, Alex, are the Marines in California arresting gun owners carrying it unloaded safely, which is legal in California, carrying in their trunks?
[01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:22.249]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:30.213]  We have confirmed nationwide that police, military, National Guard, and I've got newscast from Fox in
[01:35:33.177 --> 01:35:40.263]  New York State, where they are running cars through an x-ray machine going, oh look, we got a rifle, we're gonna make arrest.
[01:35:40.263 --> 01:35:52.693]  Absolutely, they are, I mean, you see it in the news all the time where somebody carries a deer rifle out of their car, the police get called, and the police arrest them because they find 10 guns in their garage that are legal.
[01:35:52.693 --> 01:35:54.975]  I mean, this is going on constantly.
[01:35:54.975 --> 01:35:57.857]  I've got video of them arresting people for a pocket constitution.
[01:35:59.352 --> 01:36:23.037]  I've heard you talk about these things but you know the fact that you know like I myself Alex I call ahead you know to the state that I may travel through that I don't have a CCW and call ahead how to carry the weapon legally and for the last 10 years I've had no problem but this this lately you know like I'm near Vegas now okay have you heard anything any problems in Nevada and Eastern California where
[01:36:23.877 --> 01:36:25.417]  Citizens are carrying weapons.
[01:36:25.417 --> 01:36:29.058]  Are the Marines near Fort Irwin and 29 Palms doing this?
[01:36:29.058 --> 01:36:30.859]  Yes.
[01:36:30.859 --> 01:36:33.019]  They're arresting citizens.
[01:36:33.019 --> 01:36:34.280]  Yeah, let me show you.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.301]  In fact, guys, can I have a document cam shot, please?
[01:36:37.301 --> 01:36:41.042]  Yeah, let me just show you a State Highway Patrol press release.
[01:36:41.042 --> 01:36:44.883]  Even if you're listening on the radio, you can watch this at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:36:44.883 --> 01:36:45.723]  Chip News.
[01:36:46.752 --> 01:36:54.821]  And when you read the CHIP news, it says they're running DWI checkpoints and they're armed and they search the vehicles.
[01:36:54.821 --> 01:36:59.447]  And yes, they are, in these reports, harassing gun owners.
[01:36:59.447 --> 01:37:04.373]  And if they decide that you've got a gun that they think might be illegal, they go ahead and just take you on into jail.
[01:37:04.913 --> 01:37:08.376]  So yes, they are training also for gun confiscation.
[01:37:08.376 --> 01:37:14.860]  I mean, I had a colonel on last year in Arcadia, Iowa, where they were doing gun confiscation drills in the town.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:21.405]  But the point is, just having Marines at checkpoints for DWIs against citizens, that is illegal.
[01:37:21.405 --> 01:37:24.427]  And then here is the news articles from Fox News.
[01:37:25.408 --> 01:37:37.988]  And out of NBC LA, cops show Marines how to take on Taliban, but then when you read deeper into this, and we had reports of this confirmed two years ago, they're engaged in law enforcement action with the police.
[01:37:37.988 --> 01:37:39.671]  So they're openly merging them now, sir.
[01:37:40.612 --> 01:37:45.255]  Yeah, well, those citizens that are carrying them legally, Alex, I don't see how they can take it upon themselves.
[01:37:45.255 --> 01:37:58.424]  I mean, I hear you talk about the cops in southern Texas, and, you know, I can understand that down there with those kind of cops, but the Northeast and, you know, in the West Coast, I haven't ever heard of such tyranny and parasitic, you know, trampling on our rights.
[01:38:10.952 --> 01:38:12.994]  I wasn't loaded?
[01:38:12.994 --> 01:38:14.135]  No.
[01:38:14.135 --> 01:38:15.016]  Yeah.
[01:38:15.016 --> 01:38:18.700]  Yeah, I'm believing all this, Alex, coming out of you and a couple other of my colleagues.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:21.282]  I mean, no, I mean, look, look, look, look, sir, sir.
[01:38:21.282 --> 01:38:32.593]  I remember Law Enforcement Technology Magazine, five or six years ago, said, Officer, if you see someone with a Get Us Out of the UN sticker on their car,
[01:38:33.925 --> 01:38:34.506]  I'm a veteran, Alex.
[01:39:00.882 --> 01:39:04.925]  To have troops of the Kentucky Derby arresting people.
[01:39:04.925 --> 01:39:07.487]  They're just acclimating everyone.
[01:39:07.487 --> 01:39:08.328]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:08.328 --> 01:39:14.873]  I mean, it's illegal that they blocked food and water for five days, wouldn't let the National Guard bring the food into the Superdome.
[01:39:14.873 --> 01:39:21.659]  People sat up for five days begging for it through the barbed wire, but then they sent them into the dry areas, into wealthy homes and took their guns.
[01:39:21.659 --> 01:39:22.660]  I mean, that really happened.
[01:39:23.513 --> 01:39:25.554]  This is what the military is training to do.
[01:39:25.554 --> 01:39:26.955]  This is what's happening.
[01:39:26.955 --> 01:39:28.155]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:39:28.155 --> 01:39:29.576]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:29.576 --> 01:39:31.036]  Angie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:39:31.036 --> 01:39:35.198]  Hi, I live here in Brownsville.
[01:39:35.198 --> 01:39:35.618]  Yes.
[01:39:35.618 --> 01:39:41.021]  And I wanted to let you know a couple of things that went on during Hurricane Alec.
[01:39:41.021 --> 01:39:50.325]  The first thing was that there was a newscast report saying how, you know, how they're going to process people into the shelters.
[01:39:51.314 --> 01:39:58.980]  And I said, Oh my gosh, because I thought back to your commercial about the bracelets and it popped up again right now.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:08.808]  They were showing how they process people, how they give them the bracelets and how they have to give them certain information.
[01:40:08.808 --> 01:40:10.890]  Then they give them these yellow bracelets.
[01:40:13.551 --> 01:40:15.013]  Yes ma'am.
[01:40:15.013 --> 01:40:19.758]  And again, each time it gets more extreme because they know it's hard to beat incrementalism.
[01:40:19.758 --> 01:40:26.486]  And they then put people in these camps and you're not allowed to go out at night.
[01:40:26.486 --> 01:40:30.511]  And sometimes they'll break up families and bus different people to different areas.
[01:40:30.511 --> 01:40:31.732]  The CPS is there.
[01:40:32.533 --> 01:40:36.658]  You know, looking for bruises on your children to try to take them.
[01:40:36.658 --> 01:40:37.719]  This is what goes on.
[01:40:37.719 --> 01:40:40.362]  It's just incrementally they're ratcheting it up.
[01:40:40.362 --> 01:40:41.944]  Take the public schools.
[01:40:41.944 --> 01:40:49.873]  Warrantless checkpoints, ID cards, thumb printing to get school lunches, to get library books, being trained to tattle on their parents.
[01:40:49.873 --> 01:40:52.937]  We're all being immersed in classical authoritarianism.
[01:40:54.315 --> 01:40:55.476]  Yes, exactly.
[01:40:55.476 --> 01:41:01.302]  And down here, I mean, last night me and my husband were driving home and it was just amazing.
[01:41:01.302 --> 01:41:08.890]  I have never seen that many state troopers and cops all over the expressway, all over the road.
[01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:10.812]  It was just like, wow, what's going on?
[01:41:10.812 --> 01:41:12.654]  Is there anything special going on here?
[01:41:12.654 --> 01:41:20.536]  They've tripled the number of police in the last 15 years, and they've basically federalized them, and we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:41:20.536 --> 01:41:34.640]  And I see reports every few days where they'll lay off half or more of sheriffs, deputies, or police, and then they're in the news saying, and the officers we've got are for revenue generation, we're not going to respond to most crime, you better buy a gun, which is actually an honest statement.
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:43.611]  Uh, but, uh, I mean, this country is going into a full collapse by design, and the Feds are going to try to use the collapse for a total takeover.
[01:41:43.611 --> 01:41:44.653]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:44.653 --> 01:41:49.019]  Uh, let's talk to Anonymous, who is U.S.
[01:41:49.019 --> 01:41:50.100]  military.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.103]  Now, again, I'm only taking calls until we got a break.
[01:41:53.556 --> 01:42:02.684]  And until Peter Schiff comes on in about 25 minutes, specifically, specifically, for military or police, they're not going to march in and say, we're getting ready for martial law.
[01:42:02.684 --> 01:42:05.587]  It's like, this is a security situation in the Gulf.
[01:42:05.587 --> 01:42:08.510]  We are preparing for mass evacuations.
[01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:15.936]  If the main oil comes ashore, most of it's offshore, 99 percent, they estimate, of the 150 plus, and that number's two weeks old.
[01:42:15.936 --> 01:42:16.997]  God knows what it is.
[01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:18.078]  It's hundreds of millions of gallons.
[01:42:19.573 --> 01:42:24.516]  It's off-gassing, benzene, other toxic chemicals, methane gas.
[01:42:24.516 --> 01:42:27.898]  If this comes ashore, we may have a crisis, so we're gearing up for that.
[01:42:27.898 --> 01:42:32.340]  So, prepare to have a lockdown situation.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.721]  What is your intel on this?
[01:42:33.721 --> 01:42:35.722]  Let's talk to Anonymous US Military.
[01:42:35.722 --> 01:42:37.202]  Give us your take.
[01:42:37.202 --> 01:42:37.743]  Hello?
[01:42:37.743 --> 01:42:39.083]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:39.083 --> 01:42:47.908]  Okay, I just want to first say I'm at a little risk talking to you here, but first I just want to ask you something about
[01:42:49.174 --> 01:42:52.176]  Have you heard of the society called the Oath Keepers?
[01:42:52.176 --> 01:42:53.617]  Yes, of course we've heard about Oath Keepers.
[01:42:53.617 --> 01:42:54.677]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:54.677 --> 01:43:03.022]  And do you believe that's a good organization and like constitutional soldiers willing to separate from tyrannical commanders?
[01:43:03.022 --> 01:43:03.483]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:03.483 --> 01:43:06.244]  We were the first major radio show to interview Oath Keepers.
[01:43:06.244 --> 01:43:08.065]  I've made a mini-documentary about it.
[01:43:08.065 --> 01:43:09.666]  Stuart Rhodes.
[01:43:09.666 --> 01:43:14.529]  Their code of conduct is just simply the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, what you've sworn an oath to.
[01:43:14.529 --> 01:43:15.650]  So I think it's a good organization.
[01:43:17.136 --> 01:43:23.337]  Okay, well, I'm currently trying to get into a membership with them.
[01:43:23.337 --> 01:43:25.617]  Well, listen, most people aren't members.
[01:43:25.617 --> 01:43:28.558]  It's just a code for people to go look at.
[01:43:28.558 --> 01:43:31.539]  And so, again, that's a separate issue.
[01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.499]  But you're in the military.
[01:43:33.499 --> 01:43:37.620]  Do you have any information about martial law in the Gulf?
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:45.821]  Not in the Gulf necessarily, but as I'm speaking, I know someone who is training right now, a friend of mine who's also in the military.
[01:43:47.026 --> 01:43:58.453]  And I have this website that you can go to, and they're openly training with police, and they have pictures and videos of firemen and police and National Guardsmen training together.
[01:43:58.453 --> 01:43:59.253]  Can you write it down?
[01:43:59.253 --> 01:44:00.074]  Are you ready?
[01:44:00.074 --> 01:44:00.474]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:00.474 --> 01:44:02.836]  I mean, I've been to literally dozens of these events.
[01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:06.358]  I'm fully aware of that, but go ahead and give it to us.
[01:44:06.358 --> 01:44:11.061]  Okay, it's M-U-T-C dot I-N dot N-G.
[01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:12.842]  Say that a little bit slower.
[01:44:12.842 --> 01:44:14.463]  Okay, M-U-T-C
[01:44:21.538 --> 01:44:26.120]  Well, the best thing for you to do, sir, is give me the headline on the first article.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.241]  That's the best way to search.
[01:44:27.241 --> 01:44:28.521]  It's not long URLs.
[01:44:30.996 --> 01:44:31.216]  U.S.
[01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:36.077]  Army North announces field training exercise Vibrant Response 10.2.
[01:44:36.077 --> 01:44:37.557]  Oh, absolutely, I'm aware of that.
[01:44:37.557 --> 01:44:43.078]  Yes, that's brigade homeland that they want to get up to 400,000 troop strength by 2011.
[01:44:43.078 --> 01:44:49.659]  It's reportedly over 100,000 domestic operatives right now, and that's just the public intel.
[01:44:49.659 --> 01:44:50.439]  We are the enemy.
[01:44:50.439 --> 01:44:53.560]  The American people are the enemy, so we're never given the full picture.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.960]  Neither are the troops.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.800]  But they say it's over 100,000 right now.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.741]  Yes, sir, I'm aware.
[01:44:57.741 --> 01:44:59.421]  And there's photos on those sites.
[01:45:00.381 --> 01:45:05.523]  Of citizens with their hands behind their heads with troops aiming M16s at them?
[01:45:05.523 --> 01:45:06.804]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:06.804 --> 01:45:10.325]  Yes, sir, I am aware of that.
[01:45:10.325 --> 01:45:14.087]  So what does your associate who's training in this tell you it's for?
[01:45:14.087 --> 01:45:16.127]  Well, he's in a command position.
[01:45:16.127 --> 01:45:17.908]  I'm not going to reveal his name or rank.
[01:45:17.908 --> 01:45:18.568]  Yeah, don't do that.
[01:45:18.568 --> 01:45:20.349]  Just give us the info.
[01:45:20.349 --> 01:45:27.252]  Well, they're training in a sense to just be able to destabilize
[01:45:28.297 --> 01:45:36.867]  Gun owners and people who... people who are declared unlawful and are really not in a sense.
[01:45:36.867 --> 01:45:41.752]  Yeah, and by disabled or neutralized that means lining up against a wall and shoot you.
[01:45:42.481 --> 01:45:43.182]  Yeah.
[01:45:43.182 --> 01:45:45.323]  By the way, I have this on video.
[01:45:45.323 --> 01:45:49.186]  They wouldn't let me into a certain Marine Corps training drill in Urban Warrior.
[01:45:49.186 --> 01:45:51.047]  They kept keeping me away.
[01:45:51.047 --> 01:45:57.392]  But we were able to slip someone in as a, quote, tourist, because they were allowing citizens to have tours.
[01:45:57.392 --> 01:46:02.155]  And the Marines were practicing putting citizens on their knees and shooting them in the back of the head.
[01:46:02.155 --> 01:46:04.117]  And that's in Police Day 2000.
[01:46:04.117 --> 01:46:06.638]  They said, hey, now you're going to get to see an execution.
[01:46:06.638 --> 01:46:08.220]  And the Marine says, don't tape this.
[01:46:09.215 --> 01:46:15.224]  And they practice taking the people out of their apartment, setting them down on their knees, and shooting them right in the back of the head.
[01:46:15.224 --> 01:46:18.509]  And so your friend says that he's part of this training.
[01:46:20.125 --> 01:46:22.987]  As we speak right now, he's in Indiana training.
[01:46:22.987 --> 01:46:24.648]  Oh, Indiana's the main epicenter.
[01:46:24.648 --> 01:46:27.649]  I tell you, we get so many intel hits on that that are confirmed.
[01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:28.970]  It is bad news.
[01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:31.291]  Because they think Illinois is going to flee.
[01:46:31.291 --> 01:46:36.434]  I really, and the CFR said this too, and they like to brag about what they're planning.
[01:46:36.434 --> 01:46:39.236]  They said Chicago's the next big main nuke target.
[01:46:39.236 --> 01:46:42.858]  Because I don't know if the bankers want to nuke themselves even with a small nuke in New York.
[01:46:42.858 --> 01:46:45.959]  But Chicago, let me tell you, that's in the cards.
[01:46:45.959 --> 01:46:46.500]  Anything else?
[01:46:47.985 --> 01:46:58.193]  I just want to say that to anyone listening that the military people who you see running these checkpoints in California, they're just following orders.
[01:46:58.193 --> 01:47:03.217]  They're not necessarily think what they're doing is necessarily right.
[01:47:03.217 --> 01:47:16.867]  And if it's training, they don't understand that a lot of young privates don't understand the big picture of things that are going on and how this could change the way their neighbors and everybody around them.
[01:47:17.318 --> 01:47:21.679]  Well, the point is, is that America's been overthrown by foreign banks.
[01:47:21.679 --> 01:47:25.760]  It wasn't the Russians, it wasn't the Chi-Coms, though the globalists used China to de-industrialize us.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.100]  They're part of the globalist team.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:35.362]  We've been overthrown, and now they're about to come take everything and shut our industry completely off to break us, to make us slaves.
[01:47:35.362 --> 01:47:37.142]  I mean, that's their own statements.
[01:47:37.142 --> 01:47:38.863]  The end of the industrialized society.
[01:47:38.863 --> 01:47:39.983]  We're going into bondage.
[01:47:40.583 --> 01:47:46.668]  Just like Israel, every time they became evil, you know, God sent them into bondage, foreign captivity.
[01:47:46.668 --> 01:47:48.830]  And this is what happens to every country.
[01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:51.252]  Rome became decadent and fell.
[01:47:51.252 --> 01:47:51.853]  Heaven help us.
[01:47:51.853 --> 01:47:52.774]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:52.774 --> 01:47:54.455]  I remember talking to the Marine Corps commander.
[01:47:54.455 --> 01:47:58.259]  In fact, his name's in this Chips press release.
[01:47:58.259 --> 01:48:01.462]  But it says the
[01:48:06.581 --> 01:48:17.527]  Based in office of the California Highway Patrol, Chip, in conjunction with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department and the USMC Military Police, will conduct a joint sobriety driver's checkpoint on Friday, December 12, 2008.
[01:48:17.527 --> 01:48:20.709]  This is just one of them, and it was just dozens of these.
[01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:23.231]  And I called and talked to the commander, the guy that was over this.
[01:48:24.051 --> 01:48:25.412]  And he knew exactly who I was.
[01:48:25.412 --> 01:48:26.513]  He was real arrogant.
[01:48:26.513 --> 01:48:28.394]  And he's like, we're stopping drunks.
[01:48:28.394 --> 01:48:29.455]  What's your problem with that?
[01:48:29.455 --> 01:48:34.719]  And I was like, well, why don't you just I should have recorded it, but I said, well, why don't you just come on and tell us how this is good?
[01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:36.360]  I don't have time for this.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.142]  I'm not coming on your show.
[01:48:38.142 --> 01:48:39.222]  And I know who you are.
[01:48:39.222 --> 01:48:41.224]  You know, you need to be pro military.
[01:48:41.224 --> 01:48:42.025]  We're working hard.
[01:48:45.265 --> 01:48:48.167]  And you know the Redcoats in 1775 acted the same way.
[01:48:48.167 --> 01:48:52.311]  You know, when the British citizens were saying, we're colonists, but we have the same rights.
[01:48:52.311 --> 01:48:56.053]  You're taking our freedoms, you're pushing us around, you're confiscating our guns.
[01:48:56.053 --> 01:48:57.154]  Shut up, you traitor!
[01:48:57.154 --> 01:48:58.655]  I'm just doing my job!
[01:48:58.655 --> 01:49:03.559]  Alright, do we have any other military people that want to comment on this?
[01:49:03.559 --> 01:49:03.659]  800-259-9231.
[01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:03.860]  What, John?
[01:49:08.564 --> 01:49:09.905]  I'm leaving the phones wide open.
[01:49:09.905 --> 01:49:10.105]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:10.105 --> 01:49:13.987]  Are we men or are we mice?
[01:49:13.987 --> 01:49:18.670]  I mean, are we so afraid as military people?
[01:49:18.670 --> 01:49:23.092]  See, that's why they kind of admit the NSA's listening to everything now that we're being tracked.
[01:49:23.092 --> 01:49:24.113]  And they let the troops know.
[01:49:24.113 --> 01:49:26.154]  Everything you do, talking to your family, is being recorded.
[01:49:27.014 --> 01:49:32.818]  And then that gets NSA people used to just listening to people without warrants.
[01:49:32.818 --> 01:49:37.141]  You know, the same way they bathe the military in tyranny and the police in tyranny, they bathe us.
[01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:38.341]  They wash our minds.
[01:49:38.341 --> 01:49:39.742]  That's what brainwashing is.
[01:49:39.742 --> 01:49:44.465]  They wash out what was there, your old morals, and they give you new ones.
[01:49:44.465 --> 01:49:46.907]  But they can't stop us all.
[01:49:46.907 --> 01:49:51.410]  I mean, okay, can I have military that was involved in the gun confiscations in New Orleans five years ago?
[01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:54.171]  Can you call and say that was wrong?
[01:49:54.171 --> 01:49:55.112]  No, they're afraid to do that.
[01:49:55.112 --> 01:49:55.973]  I've talked to them on the street.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:14.766]  All the time, I'll go see a movie once a month, or be at the grocery store, and somebody will come over in uniform, or come over, you know, who's got military tattoos, high and tight haircut, and they'll say, one time I had a colonel in a barbecue place, it happens all the time, go listen, we all know you're telling the truth, and we understand what's happening, and we're really concerned, but we can't talk, everything's being surveilled.
[01:50:14.766 --> 01:50:18.147]  I mean, they know that this isn't Kansas anymore.
[01:50:18.147 --> 01:50:23.369]  Go rent the movie that's based on a true story, The Lives of Others, about the Stasi spying on East Germans.
[01:50:24.329 --> 01:50:26.310]  We're under many times that.
[01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:27.931]  This isn't freedom.
[01:50:27.931 --> 01:50:32.613]  And it has nothing to do with stopping Al-Qaeda bugaboos.
[01:50:32.613 --> 01:50:35.355]  Okay?
[01:50:35.355 --> 01:50:36.835]  Oh, man.
[01:50:36.835 --> 01:50:39.077]  I just wish this wasn't happening.
[01:50:39.077 --> 01:50:47.021]  And it is all over the news the last week that they are transferring state, federal, corporate pension funds to, quote, failed banks.
[01:50:47.021 --> 01:50:48.962]  They have already taken your pension funds.
[01:50:49.924 --> 01:50:51.968]  Okay, and you're just not getting the word yet.
[01:50:51.968 --> 01:50:57.939]  They are going to take all or part of everyone's pension funds, and they're going to devalue the dollar, and they're going to increase inflation.
[01:50:57.939 --> 01:50:59.061]  They want to bankrupt you.
[01:50:59.061 --> 01:51:00.964]  This is a military scientific takeover.
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:05.562]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:51:05.562 --> 01:51:07.623]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:51:07.623 --> 01:51:10.384]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:51:10.384 --> 01:51:12.605]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:51:12.605 --> 01:51:14.026]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:51:14.026 --> 01:51:15.907]  But first, the facts.
[01:51:15.907 --> 01:51:17.848]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:51:17.848 --> 01:51:19.829]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:51:19.829 --> 01:51:23.531]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:51:23.531 --> 01:51:31.276]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:51:31.276 --> 01:51:31.876]  Sinofresh.
[01:51:32.136 --> 01:51:35.218]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:51:51.528 --> 01:51:51.888]  Mention GCN.

[01:51:52.829 --> 01:51:53.189]  It works!
[01:52:02.233 --> 01:52:03.535]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:03.535 --> 01:52:09.142]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:09.142 --> 01:52:14.169]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:14.169 --> 01:52:19.195]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:19.716 --> 01:52:24.940]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.261]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:27.261 --> 01:52:32.064]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:32.064 --> 01:52:33.185]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:33.185 --> 01:52:36.247]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:36.247 --> 01:52:39.870]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:43.072]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:43.072 --> 01:52:45.293]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:45.293 --> 01:52:46.214]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:49.856 --> 01:52:51.277]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.277 --> 01:52:58.923]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:58.923 --> 01:53:02.727]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:02.727 --> 01:53:13.115]  Protect your freedoms and be independent by learning how to maintain, repair, and customize your own firearms through these exclusive video training courses on DVD from the American Gunsmithing Institute.

[01:53:31.128 --> 01:53:34.891]  You can even get certified as a gunsmith to make money part-time, full-time.
[01:53:35.091 --> 01:53:35.471]  We're good to go.
[01:54:11.923 --> 01:54:15.824]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, this radio broadcast is funded by your support.
[01:54:15.824 --> 01:54:17.385]  How do you support us?
[01:54:17.385 --> 01:54:27.269]  Well, with the great videos, books, t-shirts, ball caps, bumper stickers, memory sticks, we have infoware.com,
[01:54:29.369 --> 01:54:30.150]  Infowars.com
[01:54:48.422 --> 01:54:54.806]  And of course we also have the new film, The Secret of Oz, that exposes the banking system and has solutions.
[01:54:54.806 --> 01:54:58.508]  Because we can't just oppose this foreign offshore banking cartel.
[01:54:58.508 --> 01:55:02.350]  We've got to have solutions to counter that.
[01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:04.812]  And that is all covered in The Secret of Oz.
[01:55:05.512 --> 01:55:08.354]  Don't forget Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:55:08.354 --> 01:55:12.716]  Anybody that needs to understand what's happening with the police state takeover needs to see this film.
[01:55:12.716 --> 01:55:22.642]  You'll have a master's degree in the New World Order takeover system, the FEMA camps, the executive orders, how they're going to use the sports stadiums, the clergy response teams, everything.
[01:55:22.642 --> 01:55:32.008]  The foreign troops, the snatch and grab squads, it's all covered in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:36.377 --> 01:55:36.757]  I'll go ahead
[01:55:54.724 --> 01:56:22.690]  92.31 we are simulcasting this syndicated radio broadcast at PrisonPlanet.TV and when you are a PrisonPlanet.TV member for 15 cents a day that also funds our operation but more importantly you can download any of the thousands and thousands of video cast archives any of my 25 films or other films have been authorized to post like Camp FEMA and Don't Tread on Me the Rise of the Republic they're there all of my films you can download burn to disk like
[01:56:23.650 --> 01:56:31.553]  Marshall Law, 9-1-1, the rise of FEMA, Terror Storm, the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:56:31.553 --> 01:56:33.513]  Takes about 30 seconds to sign up.
[01:56:33.513 --> 01:56:39.795]  Just create your name and passcode, and you can share that with up to six of your friends.
[01:56:39.795 --> 01:56:40.836]  Well, really more than that.
[01:56:40.836 --> 01:56:47.438]  You can log in under the same username and passcode, simultaneously, six different ways.
[01:56:49.178 --> 01:57:00.131]  And so you can also share your passcode with a few friends and family, but tell them not to share it too much or then it'll lock you out sometimes when more people are actually online watching the films.
[01:57:00.131 --> 01:57:03.555]  But it's an armory of resistance and information.
[01:57:03.555 --> 01:57:05.798]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:05.798 --> 01:57:06.979]  And we couldn't have done any of this
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.625]  Without all of you supporting us over the years.
[01:57:10.625 --> 01:57:12.628]  But the people are now ready to be awakened.
[01:57:12.628 --> 01:57:14.370]  Now is the time to get the word out.
[01:57:14.370 --> 01:57:19.117]  We're gonna come back in the next little five-minute segment, cover a bunch of news I haven't really gotten to yet.
[01:57:20.131 --> 01:57:24.955]  Then we got Peter Schiff joining us in the hour after that today.
[01:57:24.955 --> 01:57:29.298]  But the total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:57:29.298 --> 01:57:34.483]  I wanted to tell you about some of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[01:57:34.483 --> 01:57:37.525]  One of them is Ecolablue, the atmospheric water generators.
[01:57:37.525 --> 01:57:41.588]  They've got the smaller units that do seven and a half gallons a day and then grabs
[01:57:42.409 --> 01:57:45.191]  Humidity right out of the air and then runs it through seven to twelve filters.
[01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.873]  They have larger units.
[01:57:46.873 --> 01:57:51.597]  It's very affordable and it's the cleanest, best drinking water you can find out there, period.
[01:57:51.597 --> 01:57:54.619]  Because it hadn't come out of the water table or out of a river or lake.
[01:57:54.619 --> 01:57:55.700]  It hadn't been fluoridated.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:56.821]  It's just right out of the atmosphere.
[01:57:57.762 --> 01:58:01.745]  acolablue.com or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[01:58:01.745 --> 01:58:09.850]  And last but not least, I want to tell you about Front Sight Firearms Training.
[01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:11.671]  It's not enough to simply own firearms.
[01:58:11.671 --> 01:58:15.673]  You need to be trained to levels that exceed law enforcement or even military training.
[01:58:15.673 --> 01:58:16.974]  It's award-winning.
[01:58:16.974 --> 01:58:19.756]  There's no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[01:58:19.756 --> 01:58:24.378]  It's Front Sight, like the front of your gun barrel, frontsight.com.
[01:58:24.378 --> 01:58:25.819]  And if you act fast on their
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.101]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:36.876 --> 01:59:37.576]  Look for Max

[01:59:42.278 --> 01:59:43.519]  You'll love this site.
[01:59:43.519 --> 01:59:45.379]  It's HomeGain.com.
[01:59:45.379 --> 01:59:48.261]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:59:48.261 --> 01:59:54.964]  Check them out today.
[01:59:54.964 --> 01:59:57.345]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:57.345 --> 02:00:00.126]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.909 --> 02:00:11.753]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.753 --> 02:00:13.334]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.334 --> 02:00:14.896]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.896 --> 02:00:19.079]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.079 --> 02:00:28.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.246 --> 02:00:32.870]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are into this third hour of world-wide broadcast.
[02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:36.033]  Senatorial candidate Peter Schiff will be joining us.
[02:00:38.148 --> 02:00:44.331]  We're gonna open the phones up if you'd like to talk to him, 800-259-9231.
[02:00:44.331 --> 02:00:53.656]  Look at this Ossacola headline, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, out of Iowa.
[02:00:53.656 --> 02:00:56.837]  This is out of the Sioux Journal, Sioux City Journal.
[02:00:56.837 --> 02:01:01.779]  Federal Judge Orders County Sheriff to Issue Gun Permit, and the article is incredible.
[02:01:01.779 --> 02:01:06.602]  To paraphrase, in the interest of time, this person wrote a letter to the editor, critical of the government,
[02:01:07.597 --> 02:01:10.380]  And critical of the sheriff's anti-gun stance.
[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:15.985]  So the sheriff told him in the town, you are banned from getting a gun permit.
[02:01:15.985 --> 02:01:22.291]  And see, that's your new gun right, folks, is you go get a permit from the government and then they deny it if they want.
[02:01:23.257 --> 02:01:25.418]  That's basically what the Supreme Court ruling has said.
[02:01:25.418 --> 02:01:29.161]  But a lower-level federal court has ordered U.S.
[02:01:29.161 --> 02:01:38.947]  District Judge Walter W. Bennett has ordered the County Sheriff Douglas L. Weber to issue a gun permit to a resident and to complete a college-level course involving the First Amendment.
[02:01:38.947 --> 02:01:52.577]  The court finds a tsunami, a maelstrom of avalanche of direct, uncontroverted evidence in Sheriff Weber's own testimony conclude beyond all doubt that he unquestionably violated the First Amendment right
[02:01:53.519 --> 02:01:58.003]  of at least Paul Dorr, Bennett wrote in his ruling.
[02:01:58.003 --> 02:02:15.619]  And he told him because he protested once and sent a letter to the editor that the, he called the gun owner a wacko, delusional, a nut job, a spook, and a narcissist.
[02:02:18.533 --> 02:02:21.035]  And just said, I don't allow you to own a gun.
[02:02:21.035 --> 02:02:22.837]  This is the government being God.
[02:02:22.837 --> 02:02:24.519]  You can't have prior restraint.
[02:02:24.519 --> 02:02:27.842]  When somebody commits a crime with a gun, then they're held accountable.
[02:02:27.842 --> 02:02:31.685]  I mean, that's the essence of freedom.
[02:02:31.685 --> 02:02:32.706]  We've seen Chicago.
[02:02:32.706 --> 02:02:33.627]  We've seen New York.
[02:02:33.627 --> 02:02:36.449]  We know where they ban guns, crime rates explode.
[02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.631]  And I've gone over the new Chicago gun law.
[02:02:39.474 --> 02:02:50.041]  It's basically impossible to get a gun, and they're calling it your privilege, and that they're permitting you to have a gun, that mafia-run city.
[02:02:50.041 --> 02:02:53.964]  But overall, I guess the ruling's good, and then it does say that at least there is some right.
[02:02:55.933 --> 02:02:56.213]  I don't
[02:03:20.728 --> 02:03:20.948]  Thank you.
[02:03:34.721 --> 02:03:35.301]  We're good to go.
[02:03:53.632 --> 02:03:55.293]  But what does the White House say?
[02:03:55.293 --> 02:04:00.397]  Oh, well, they're gonna sue on racial profiling issues, even though the law doesn't say racial profiling.
[02:04:00.397 --> 02:04:10.283]  It says, after first contact for suspicion of another crime, drunk driving, speeding, whatever it is, if you don't have an ID and you're an illegal alien, they're gonna arrest you for that, too.
[02:04:10.283 --> 02:04:14.746]  Now, that's what the stinking bill says, not what the media hoax says.
[02:04:14.746 --> 02:04:18.589]  Just like they have a media hoax saying you're a racist if you're against government-run healthcare.
[02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:19.670]  What does that have to do with it?
[02:04:19.670 --> 02:04:19.970]  Nothing.
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.302]  Holder floats possibility of racial profiling suit on top of the new suit.
[02:04:28.604 --> 02:04:28.884]  U.S.
[02:04:28.884 --> 02:04:31.125]  might launch second suit against Arizona immigration law.
[02:04:31.125 --> 02:04:38.129]  Holder says, this is only illustrating to everybody that we have a government involved in high treason against the Republic.
[02:04:38.129 --> 02:04:40.150]  And they are not going to get away with it.
[02:04:40.150 --> 02:04:47.874]  And that is such exciting news that they're being forced to come out in the open and show everybody just how treacherous and un-American and hateful they are.
[02:04:47.874 --> 02:04:50.336]  Our federal government is run by globalists.
[02:04:50.336 --> 02:04:51.576]  It is a corporate takeover.
[02:04:51.576 --> 02:04:54.918]  They use the United States like a throwaway whore.
[02:04:54.918 --> 02:04:55.639]  It's that simple.
[02:04:55.639 --> 02:04:56.199]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:02.059 --> 02:05:02.820]  Listen up, folks.
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:03.761]  This is important.
[02:05:03.761 --> 02:05:04.862]  Alex Jones here.

[02:07:01.411 --> 02:07:05.954]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.954 --> 02:07:06.874]  Number 1.
[02:07:06.874 --> 02:07:10.297]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:10.297 --> 02:07:11.157]  Number 2.
[02:07:11.157 --> 02:07:16.040]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:16.801]  It's true.
[02:07:16.801 --> 02:07:21.664]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.664 --> 02:07:22.484]  Number 3.
[02:07:22.484 --> 02:07:26.067]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:26.067 --> 02:07:29.769]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.969 --> 02:07:30.769]  Number 4.
[02:07:30.769 --> 02:07:33.530]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:37.212]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:37.212 --> 02:07:38.012]  Number 5.
[02:07:38.012 --> 02:07:42.154]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:42.154 --> 02:07:47.196]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:47.196 --> 02:07:51.377]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.377 --> 02:07:53.158]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:06.110]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:06.110 --> 02:08:08.934]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:31.508 --> 02:08:34.009]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:08:34.009 --> 02:08:36.230]  Peter Schiff, running for the U.S.
[02:08:36.230 --> 02:08:38.470]  Senate, is our guest.
[02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:49.574]  He, of course, is a businessman, financial commentator, economic advisor to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign and 2010 candidate for the United States Senate in the state of Connecticut.
[02:08:49.574 --> 02:08:52.615]  And, Peter Schiff, it's good to have you here with us for the Balance of the Hour.
[02:08:52.615 --> 02:08:53.736]  Thanks, Alex, for having me on.
[02:08:54.414 --> 02:09:01.221]  Well, so much has happened, so much has developed in the last 8-9 months since we last had you on.
[02:09:01.221 --> 02:09:09.629]  Before we get into your run for the Senate, as a guy who's predicted what would happen in the economy, break down what you see happening.
[02:09:10.632 --> 02:09:21.440]  Well, unfortunately, the politicians who poisoned the well with their subsidies and regulations and cheap money, the government stimulus is simply more of the problem.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:28.766]  You know, we got into this economic mess because we stimulated the economy with low interest rates and government guarantees.
[02:09:28.766 --> 02:09:31.568]  Consumers spent too much money because of government subsidies.
[02:09:31.568 --> 02:09:33.869]  We bought houses and cars that we couldn't afford.
[02:09:33.869 --> 02:09:35.631]  We imported products that we couldn't afford.
[02:09:35.631 --> 02:09:38.052]  The government spent money it didn't have.
[02:09:38.052 --> 02:09:39.894]  That's how we dug our way into this hole.
[02:09:40.254 --> 02:09:40.775]  We're good to go.
[02:09:56.796 --> 02:09:57.636]  We're good to go.
[02:10:13.921 --> 02:10:20.705]  And I think we're now teetering on the brink of a depression, not because the government didn't do enough, but because it did too much.
[02:10:20.705 --> 02:10:26.728]  I think it's going to be an inflationary depression, and I want to be in Washington to put an end to it before it's too late.
[02:10:29.073 --> 02:10:46.786]  Well, I mean, Peter, Ron Paul, myself, many others get called conspiracy theorists when we read IMF World Bank plans going back 20 years to establish a global currency where this private group of banks set, you know, the value of currencies worldwide, where we pay carbon taxes to them.
[02:10:46.786 --> 02:10:56.053]  Now that's all out in the open and the very same big central banks and the very same governments that have bankrupted our economy, that have created 600 trillion or more
[02:10:56.613 --> 02:10:57.214]  Yeah, I mean I...
[02:11:20.416 --> 02:11:24.518]  I don't think that our leaders are smart enough to have conspired to cause this.
[02:11:24.518 --> 02:11:35.363]  I think it's their own incompetence that did it, and their own, you know, all they care about is their own re-election, and so to further their own political campaigns and careers, they do things that are detrimental to the country.
[02:11:35.363 --> 02:11:39.084]  But they certainly take advantage of a crisis, even if they're the ones that caused it.
[02:11:39.084 --> 02:11:43.006]  So I know that Barack Obama and his buddies in Washington are a bunch of socialists.
[02:11:43.386 --> 02:11:45.347]  They don't think the market works anyway.
[02:11:45.347 --> 02:11:48.568]  And when their policies destroy it, you know, they take credit.
[02:11:48.568 --> 02:11:53.871]  They basically say it's the free, it's capital that doesn't work, it's freedom that doesn't work, and the solution is more government.
[02:11:53.871 --> 02:11:55.951]  So they certainly don't waste the crisis.
[02:11:55.951 --> 02:12:00.013]  It's like they set a fire, and then they go to put it out with gasoline.
[02:12:00.013 --> 02:12:05.095]  And when it gets bigger, they take credit for trying to put it out, but then they pour more gasoline on it.
[02:12:05.095 --> 02:12:06.196]  So it's great for them.
[02:12:06.536 --> 02:12:16.465]  Because it means more government, more bureaucracy, we surrender more of our liberties, the weaker the economy gets, the more poverty government creates, the bigger the role for government in their eyes.
[02:12:16.465 --> 02:12:24.893]  And the only way that we can end this cycle is for someone to go to Washington and take away the gasoline, and let the, you know, and then the fire can go out.
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:28.501]  Well, Peter, you know, I agree with you on that point.
[02:12:28.501 --> 02:12:30.841]  But, I mean, there is some organization to this.
[02:12:30.841 --> 02:12:39.103]  We see the Timberwolf emails where they're saying this stuff is crap, but let's sell it to our customers and then we'll make money on both sides of it.
[02:12:39.103 --> 02:12:43.905]  We see Rahm Emanuel saying don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:12:43.905 --> 02:12:48.626]  We know Washington wants to bankrupt the states so they can just further federalize them.
[02:12:48.626 --> 02:12:49.446]  I mean, they know
[02:12:49.946 --> 02:12:51.627]  Well, yeah, that's what they're doing with healthcare.
[02:12:51.627 --> 02:12:53.807]  I mean, they have set up this new Obamacare.
[02:12:53.807 --> 02:12:57.668]  Basically, what this is going to do, ultimately, is destroy private healthcare.
[02:12:57.668 --> 02:13:00.909]  It's going to destroy the insurance industry because it can't work.
[02:13:00.909 --> 02:13:05.371]  And then when the whole thing falls apart, they're going to say, you see, we need a single-payer plan.
[02:13:05.371 --> 02:13:09.872]  I mean, the government gets in and creates the problem that it's destined to fail.
[02:13:09.872 --> 02:13:11.853]  It's like the camel's nose under the tent.
[02:13:11.853 --> 02:13:13.313]  And that's what this thing is.
[02:13:13.313 --> 02:13:15.554]  It's the camel's nose of socialized medicine.
[02:13:17.581 --> 02:13:22.126]  Well, sure, and then they screw up health care even more, and their answer is, more government to fix it.
[02:13:22.126 --> 02:13:26.792]  Right, of course, the only reason that health care is so expensive is because of all the government involvement.
[02:13:26.792 --> 02:13:32.378]  If we actually had a free market in health care the way we do in, let's say, cell phones or
[02:13:32.418 --> 02:13:33.319]  We're good to go.
[02:13:47.841 --> 02:13:48.081]  Well, Peter,
[02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:08.750]  Look at Obama.
[02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:12.952]  He got conservatively four times the Wall Street money John McCain did.
[02:14:12.952 --> 02:14:20.555]  Wall Street has gotten trillions of dollars in the aggregate out of these bailouts from that.
[02:14:20.555 --> 02:14:26.057]  And my whole issue is a lot of the interest on Wall Street want crony capitalism.
[02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:28.198]  They want to deal with the government.
[02:14:28.198 --> 02:14:31.139]  So when people say Obama's a socialist, I agree that
[02:14:31.579 --> 02:14:46.694]  You know, his wife and Hillary and all these people and Kagan wrote their thesis on socialism and they themselves are socialist, but the big banks and the big, you know, monopoly men, they want a socialist model to socialize our wealth and then give it to them.
[02:14:47.154 --> 02:14:48.816]  Wall Street is not just monolithic.
[02:14:48.816 --> 02:14:52.240]  I mean, I am part of Wall Street, and I didn't want a single bailout.
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.441]  I wanted those firms to fail.
[02:14:53.441 --> 02:15:01.631]  There are a lot of smaller firms that are not politically connected, that don't benefit from the bailouts and the large reps, but you have a handful of large firms
[02:15:02.051 --> 02:15:08.773]  That basically have bought their way into the government, and I blame the government more than I blame the businesses.
[02:15:08.773 --> 02:15:14.875]  I mean, yeah, sure, they're trying to make a buck, and the fact that we have a corrupt government that they can bribe, you know, it's the fault of the government.
[02:15:14.875 --> 02:15:15.915]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:15:15.915 --> 02:15:16.975]  I totally agree with you.
[02:15:16.975 --> 02:15:25.797]  Corporate corruption needs a big government to give them government power to engage in market rigging and oligopolies.
[02:15:25.797 --> 02:15:31.179]  If we take away the power from the bureaucrats, then there's no reason to try to bribe them because they have nothing to give you.
[02:15:33.814 --> 02:15:40.316]  It's not really a conspiracy, but it's a cooperation between big government and Wall Street, and it's bleeding the country dry.
[02:15:40.316 --> 02:15:43.097]  And it's got to end, and it starts with the Federal Reserve.
[02:15:43.097 --> 02:15:46.638]  The Federal Reserve is feeding these companies cheap money.
[02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:47.979]  They make riskless profits.
[02:15:47.979 --> 02:15:50.220]  You've got government backstopping everything.
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:54.801]  So when they can make all these risky bets, and when the bets pay off, they win.
[02:15:54.801 --> 02:15:58.342]  And when the bets lose, they win again, because we bail them out.
[02:15:58.342 --> 02:16:00.003]  That is the problem, and it's not going to stop.
[02:16:00.263 --> 02:16:01.103]  I totally agree with you.
[02:16:01.103 --> 02:16:02.444]  Government is the main vector.
[02:16:02.444 --> 02:16:04.264]  Government is what allows this to happen.
[02:16:04.264 --> 02:16:06.045]  My only issue is, I found with the left,
[02:16:22.210 --> 02:16:39.382]  If you go out and explain to them that the health care plan was written by a consortium of insurance companies to lower care and raise taxes and ensure that 30-something million people had to buy overpriced, cruddy care from their plans, I mean, the left is now actually starting to discover that.
[02:16:39.382 --> 02:16:40.763]  I'm seeing them go, what?
[02:16:40.763 --> 02:16:41.823]  I don't get a free lunch?
[02:16:41.823 --> 02:16:43.164]  I don't get some free health care?
[02:16:43.164 --> 02:16:45.446]  This doesn't cover pre-existing conditions?
[02:16:45.446 --> 02:16:48.928]  This does set up these federal panels that cut the quality of care?
[02:16:48.928 --> 02:16:50.629]  I mean, that do lead to death panels?
[02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:59.058]  I just see it when we approach it from the classic libertarian perspective, it doesn't seem to telegraph through because it's so nuanced.
[02:16:59.058 --> 02:17:00.219]  I mean, here's another example.
[02:17:00.219 --> 02:17:07.828]  Yeah, I mean, here you've got an industry that is now, through government force, compelling people to buy their products whether they want them or not.
[02:17:08.388 --> 02:17:14.051]  I mean, the beauty of the free market is a business has to win me as a customer.
[02:17:14.051 --> 02:17:17.212]  I have to voluntarily buy their product, which means I have to want it.
[02:17:17.212 --> 02:17:19.293]  I have to think it's better than the competition.
[02:17:19.293 --> 02:17:21.474]  Now you have the government saying, you've got no choice.
[02:17:21.474 --> 02:17:23.735]  You've got to buy this, no matter how crappy it is.
[02:17:25.936 --> 02:17:35.820]  All right, now I want to get into your campaign and get your stance on issues for listeners out there so they know where you come from because most people know who you are, but some may not.
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:42.983]  But going back to the banking reform bill, even the head of the Texas Banking Association wrote a story a few months ago.
[02:17:43.883 --> 02:17:56.389]  Breaking it down, he said the big mega banks that created the derivatives, that have a sweetheart deal with the government, who have almost every regulatory position, they have written this to shut us down and take us over and take down smaller Wall Street firms.
[02:17:56.389 --> 02:18:07.555]  Ron Paul concurred here two weeks ago on the show, saying that's exactly what it does, but the media's running a hoax, saying, oh, this banking reform bill, it's going to get JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.
[02:18:07.555 --> 02:18:08.395]  What's your take on that?
[02:18:08.575 --> 02:18:09.255]  Absolutely not.
[02:18:09.255 --> 02:18:10.616]  I mean, there's no way that's going to happen.
[02:18:10.616 --> 02:18:18.799]  I mean, I know that whenever Wall Street screws up and they get their buddies in government to write regulations, it punishes the smaller firms that compete with them.
[02:18:18.799 --> 02:18:22.540]  You see, these big firms are like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan.
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:23.921]  They have economies of scale.
[02:18:24.141 --> 02:18:25.901]  They don't care how much rules and regulations.
[02:18:25.901 --> 02:18:27.762]  They have an army of lawyers on staff.
[02:18:27.762 --> 02:18:29.402]  They can handle it.
[02:18:29.402 --> 02:18:33.684]  In little firms like me, you know, my compliance costs have gone through the roof.
[02:18:33.684 --> 02:18:39.365]  I now have an 8-person compliance department, whereas 10 years ago, I did it all myself.
[02:18:39.365 --> 02:18:41.926]  And I'm spending millions of dollars a year on compliance.
[02:18:41.926 --> 02:18:42.906]  It is worthless.
[02:18:42.906 --> 02:18:44.367]  The Patriot Act has killed me.
[02:18:44.367 --> 02:18:45.547]  The anti-money laundering stuff.
[02:18:46.147 --> 02:18:46.708]  We're good.
[02:19:17.188 --> 02:19:24.091]  And it's all gonna be selectively enforced because the big six banks literally have all the regulators as their former alumni.
[02:19:34.176 --> 02:19:37.117]  But yeah, I mean, a lot of firms aren't going to get started.
[02:19:37.117 --> 02:19:42.398]  A lot of smaller firms are going to go out of business because they can't survive the regulatory onslaught.
[02:19:42.398 --> 02:19:49.739]  And all of this is music to the ears of these big, too-big-to-fail firms that are going to get a lot bigger and make a lot more money off the backs of the American people.
[02:19:49.739 --> 02:19:51.060]  Yeah, this is Veritas.
[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:52.440]  That's the heart of it.
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:56.761]  And you explain that to some socialist liberal, they'll actually understand that.
[02:19:56.761 --> 02:20:00.662]  We'll be right back with Peter Schiff, our guest, running for Senate in Connecticut.

[02:22:31.895 --> 02:22:33.156]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:33.156 --> 02:22:37.719]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:37.719 --> 02:22:43.523]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:43.523 --> 02:22:47.165]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:47.165 --> 02:22:49.887]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:06.129 --> 02:24:09.290]  Schiff4Senate.com is the website.
[02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:13.011]  We've got it up on screen for PresidentPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:24:13.011 --> 02:24:21.874]  Of course, his big claim to fame is Ron Paul's main presidential advisor for his presidential campaign on the economy.
[02:24:21.874 --> 02:24:24.875]  And he, of course, predicted a lot of what has now unfolded.
[02:24:24.875 --> 02:24:29.557]  I want to, before he leaves us, another 35 minutes left with him, get back into how he sees
[02:24:30.537 --> 02:24:33.360]  The situation with the economy unraveling.
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.503]  I mean, they're now starting to admit we're in a depression, not just a double-dip recession.
[02:24:37.503 --> 02:24:39.364]  So we'll get his take on that.
[02:24:39.364 --> 02:24:45.049]  In fact, let's just get your take more on the economy right now, because that's what you're really an expert on.
[02:24:45.049 --> 02:24:46.530]  Where do you see things going?
[02:24:46.530 --> 02:24:49.052]  I mean, they're now not just calling it a double-dip recession.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:54.323]  Well, I've been calling it a depression since it began, and it's going to be an inflationary depression.
[02:24:54.323 --> 02:24:58.086]  That's going to make it that much more depressing for most Americans.
[02:24:58.086 --> 02:25:01.708]  And it's not because of reasons, but Paul Krugman is saying.
[02:25:01.708 --> 02:25:04.310]  He says we're going to have a depression because the government isn't doing enough.
[02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:06.611]  It's doing too much.
[02:25:06.611 --> 02:25:08.152]  That's why we're going to have a depression.
[02:25:08.152 --> 02:25:15.196]  The government is starving the economy of the resources that it needs to grow and produce and provide employment opportunities.
[02:25:15.196 --> 02:25:19.638]  You see, we can't try to return to the way things were while the bubble was inflating.
[02:25:19.638 --> 02:25:20.939]  That was the problem.
[02:25:20.939 --> 02:25:25.121]  We have to return to an economy based on under-consumption savings.
[02:25:25.661 --> 02:25:26.102]  I think so.
[02:25:43.817 --> 02:25:44.618]  Buy more houses.
[02:25:44.618 --> 02:25:44.878]  Why?
[02:25:44.878 --> 02:25:46.419]  We bought too many houses.
[02:25:46.419 --> 02:25:48.621]  You know, we're not in trouble because we didn't spend enough.
[02:25:48.621 --> 02:25:50.282]  We're in trouble because we didn't save enough.
[02:25:50.282 --> 02:25:51.503]  We spent too much.
[02:25:51.503 --> 02:25:54.766]  So we've got to save our money so that businesses can invest and grow the economy.
[02:25:54.766 --> 02:25:56.307]  But the government won't let that happen.
[02:25:56.307 --> 02:25:58.269]  The government is borrowing everything.
[02:25:58.269 --> 02:26:00.311]  You know, people say the banks aren't loaning.
[02:26:00.311 --> 02:26:01.532]  They're sitting on the money.
[02:26:01.532 --> 02:26:02.612]  They are loaning it.
[02:26:02.612 --> 02:26:04.014]  They're loaning it to the government.
[02:26:04.014 --> 02:26:10.559]  They're borrowing from the Federal Reserve at practically nothing and then buying Treasuries and earning a spread on money they don't even have.
[02:26:10.919 --> 02:26:15.243]  But the credit is funding the growth of government, which is undermining our economy.
[02:26:15.243 --> 02:26:19.167]  It's making our economy less productive, less able to compete.
[02:26:19.167 --> 02:26:20.468]  It's destroying opportunity.
[02:26:20.468 --> 02:26:21.709]  It's destroying jobs.
[02:26:21.709 --> 02:26:30.417]  Peter, you say that they don't know what they're doing, but when California raised taxes in the last few years and tax receipts went down, that's 101.
[02:26:30.417 --> 02:26:30.998]  They know Kennedy.
[02:26:32.199 --> 02:26:32.419]  I don't
[02:26:49.411 --> 02:26:58.194]  I said before, you know, they do, the state, the government wants to perpetuate poverty and dependency because that's how they feed, uh, they're like a parasite.
[02:26:58.194 --> 02:27:03.476]  That's what they live off of, our misery, because if they can keep us broke, then they can keep getting our votes.
[02:27:03.476 --> 02:27:11.799]  If they can dole out money that we depend on, then they can, then they can have our votes because you're going to vote against anybody who wants to take away that free lunch.
[02:27:12.299 --> 02:27:15.601]  But the reality is, without all this government help, we'd all be better off.
[02:27:15.601 --> 02:27:23.006]  It's like Harry Brown used to say, the government is an expert at crippling you, then handing you a crutch, and saying, see, without me, you couldn't walk.
[02:27:23.006 --> 02:27:26.588]  Well, you did say four or five years ago, we were going into a depression.
[02:27:26.588 --> 02:27:28.850]  You did say two and a half years ago, this is a depression.
[02:27:28.850 --> 02:27:30.271]  So, you've been dead on.
[02:27:30.271 --> 02:27:38.256]  So, I'm asking you, sir, with your own financial planning, with your own research, where do you see America in six months, a year out, two years out?
[02:27:38.256 --> 02:27:39.757]  How bad is this depression gonna get?
[02:27:40.077 --> 02:27:48.981]  Well, you know, right now we're still drinking the government alcohol, the stimulus alcohol, so for a while, you know, we don't feel the ill effects of what we're doing as we go deeper into debt.
[02:27:48.981 --> 02:27:54.403]  But I think sometime soon, I don't know if it's in six months or a year or two, but we're going to see a collapse of the dollar.
[02:27:54.403 --> 02:27:57.184]  You know, we just saw a downgrade today of U.S.
[02:27:57.184 --> 02:28:00.445]  government debt by rating agencies in China.
[02:28:00.445 --> 02:28:02.466]  We're going to start to see an aversion to U.S.
[02:28:02.466 --> 02:28:06.828]  government debt around the world, and the dollar's going to plunge, interest rates are going to soar,
[02:28:07.348 --> 02:28:11.589]  And then this recession is going to kick into, or depression, a higher gear.
[02:28:11.589 --> 02:28:19.552]  And at that point, the government is going to be forced, with a very, very uncomfortable choice, to create massive inflation or default on its promises.
[02:28:19.552 --> 02:28:26.614]  And my fear is that we will choose the inflation route because it's more politically expedient, and then we will have runaway inflation.
[02:28:26.614 --> 02:28:33.496]  We will destroy the value of our money, and we will create misery on a scale never experienced before in this country.
[02:28:33.496 --> 02:28:36.517]  Something worse than our grandparents endured during the Great Depression.
[02:28:37.237 --> 02:28:39.698]  And we don't have a lot of time to head this off.
[02:28:39.698 --> 02:28:41.818]  Otherwise, I wouldn't be running for the United States Senate.
[02:28:41.818 --> 02:28:53.902]  If I didn't think the situation was that dire, believe me, there are better things I could do with my time than try to convince 99 senators to change course.
[02:28:53.902 --> 02:28:56.062]  I want to talk about the campaign.
[02:28:56.062 --> 02:29:01.464]  Give us some of the key dates coming up for you to be able to win the Senate in Connecticut.
[02:29:01.872 --> 02:29:04.573]  Well, the big key date is the primary, which is August 10th.
[02:29:04.573 --> 02:29:08.133]  If I don't win the Republican primary, then I'm not part of the election.
[02:29:08.133 --> 02:29:10.694]  I'm not going to run as an Independent or a Libertarian.
[02:29:10.694 --> 02:29:14.235]  If I can't win the Republican nomination, I'm not going to run.
[02:29:14.235 --> 02:29:16.435]  And so, it's a three-person race right now.
[02:29:16.435 --> 02:29:18.436]  I'm in third, but, you know, I can win.
[02:29:18.436 --> 02:29:23.397]  I mean, if you look at the polls, my favorables are ten times my unfavorables.
[02:29:23.397 --> 02:29:24.617]  Nobody else is close.
[02:29:24.617 --> 02:29:27.658]  The only reason I'm not winning is because enough people don't know who I am.
[02:29:27.998 --> 02:29:30.701]  The people who know who I am overwhelmingly support me.
[02:29:30.701 --> 02:29:32.923]  So that's where your audience can help out.
[02:29:32.923 --> 02:29:33.965]  There's two things that they can do.
[02:29:33.965 --> 02:29:34.565]  Well, stay there!
[02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:36.968]  We have a long segment coming up with Peter Schiff.
[02:29:36.968 --> 02:29:38.289]  Schiff4Senate.com.
[02:29:38.289 --> 02:29:43.014]  We're going to talk about how you can win the Senate from Connecticut when we come back.
[02:29:43.014 --> 02:29:46.418]  How we can capture that lightning in a bottle that we saw with Rand Paul.
[02:29:46.418 --> 02:29:47.259]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.259 --> 02:29:47.700]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.697 --> 02:29:56.621]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.621 --> 02:30:02.125]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.125 --> 02:30:03.787]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:30:23.445 --> 02:30:26.088]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:30:26.088 --> 02:30:32.614]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:30:54.632 --> 02:30:55.292]  Thank you!
[02:31:01.823 --> 02:31:03.164]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:31:03.164 --> 02:31:05.106]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:31:05.106 --> 02:31:10.052]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:31:19.361 --> 02:31:21.702]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:31:21.702 --> 02:31:24.584]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:31:24.584 --> 02:31:27.506]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:31:27.506 --> 02:31:35.090]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:31:35.447 --> 02:31:40.830]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:43.672]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:31:43.672 --> 02:31:47.374]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:31:47.374 --> 02:31:48.435]  And I got news for you.
[02:31:48.435 --> 02:31:49.776]  You're everyone else.
[02:31:49.776 --> 02:31:51.277]  Invisible Empire.

[02:32:02.461 --> 02:32:03.402]  This is important.
[02:32:03.402 --> 02:32:04.503]  Alex Jones here.

[02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:16.231]  Peter Schiff is our guest.
[02:33:16.231 --> 02:33:24.897]  We're going to take some phone calls for him and also talk about where he stands on issues for people around the country that want to support him and also people in Connecticut.
[02:33:24.897 --> 02:33:33.984]  This key primary coming up and we see anti-incumbent candidates being elected everywhere, winning primaries, winning special elections.
[02:33:33.984 --> 02:33:36.366]  We're going to talk about the political realignment in a moment.
[02:33:37.086 --> 02:33:37.266]  I think?
[02:33:57.923 --> 02:34:10.153]  Army Special Operations soldier Adam Dillon told a New Orleans television station that British Petroleum is not interested in cleaning up oil spill because the company is run by cutthroat individuals who only care about money.
[02:34:10.153 --> 02:34:11.514]  And it goes on from there.
[02:34:11.514 --> 02:34:15.377]  That's just one of the stories that's up at GCNlive.com.
[02:34:15.377 --> 02:34:20.380]  Another article that's up there dealing with the viral video I put out Thursday.
[02:34:21.221 --> 02:34:23.243]  LeBron Nation.
[02:34:23.243 --> 02:34:25.706]  Americans hypnotized as country collapses.
[02:34:25.706 --> 02:34:32.293]  Programmed zombies get hysterical about basketball while their future is being destroyed because that's what's valuable to them.
[02:34:32.293 --> 02:34:41.783]  They know all about football, basketball, all about Hollywood stars, all about the latest controversy, but nothing about what's happening in this nation.
[02:34:42.484 --> 02:34:46.788]  So that's also up at GCNLive.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:46.788 --> 02:34:52.752]  There's also been six killed, four injured, including the gunman, after a shooting spree in Albuquerque Company.
[02:34:52.752 --> 02:34:57.536]  They say it's not terror-related and that his wife worked there and he previously worked there.
[02:34:57.536 --> 02:34:59.998]  So more stress out there in society.
[02:34:59.998 --> 02:35:02.660]  Our prayers go out to those that have been killed.
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:06.683]  Okay, Peter, I'd like to run through where you stand.
[02:35:06.683 --> 02:35:08.665]  But first off, your chance of winning.
[02:35:08.665 --> 02:35:10.026]  We've seen a lot of patriot
[02:35:10.606 --> 02:35:11.666]  What's your view on that?
[02:35:36.335 --> 02:35:38.437]  I think I'm very viable if people know me.
[02:35:38.437 --> 02:35:40.139]  My story is very compelling.
[02:35:40.139 --> 02:35:46.966]  I mean, if you go to the website SchiffForSenate.com and just watch the 4-minute video, Who Is Peter Schiff?, that's on the home page.
[02:35:46.966 --> 02:35:54.734]  I mean, if people find my story, the one guy that was warning about the financial crisis on television, nobody would listen to him.
[02:35:54.734 --> 02:35:55.835]  Everybody laughed at him.
[02:35:56.295 --> 02:35:57.035]  I mean, it's perfect.
[02:35:57.035 --> 02:36:01.357]  We have an economic crisis on our hands, yet the people who caused it are still in charge.
[02:36:01.357 --> 02:36:04.678]  Why not send one of the only people that predicted it to Washington?
[02:36:04.678 --> 02:36:08.079]  My business background, I mean, it makes perfect sense.
[02:36:08.079 --> 02:36:10.400]  That's why when people know about me, they support me.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:19.903]  But, you know, the Republican Party establishment is afraid of my winning this campaign, so they're doing whatever they can to try to marginalize me, to ignore me in the campaign.
[02:36:19.903 --> 02:36:21.264]  But, you know, it's a small state.
[02:36:21.804 --> 02:36:26.628]  There's only going to be about, let's say, 100,000 people who are going to vote in the Republican primary.
[02:36:26.628 --> 02:36:28.729]  And, you know, we can get to those people.
[02:36:28.729 --> 02:36:32.212]  You know, I've got, there's two ways that people that are listening to this show can help me.
[02:36:32.212 --> 02:36:35.354]  One, they can go to share4senate.com and make a donation.
[02:36:35.354 --> 02:36:42.039]  We need a lot of money now to be able to afford the media that we need to win in the closing weeks of the primary.
[02:36:42.039 --> 02:36:43.661]  So, I need donations.
[02:36:43.661 --> 02:36:46.563]  So you can donate personally, you can talk to your friends about donating.
[02:36:47.083 --> 02:37:00.468]  But if you're, you know, once you've donated all that you can, if you can donate some of your time every day for the next month to my phone banking system, right on the front page of my website, there's a big Liberty Bell that flashes back and forth for dialing.
[02:37:00.468 --> 02:37:04.530]  If you click on that and follow the instructions, you can phone bank.
[02:37:04.530 --> 02:37:08.251]  You can call an 800 number from a landline, and then it's totally free.
[02:37:08.251 --> 02:37:12.272]  All the long-distance charges are taken by the campaign, and you don't even have to dial.
[02:37:12.272 --> 02:37:13.753]  The program will dial for you.
[02:37:14.313 --> 02:37:18.035]  And it's only dialing registered Republicans in the state of Connecticut.
[02:37:18.035 --> 02:37:25.018]  And if a voicemail picks up, you just push a button and it will leave a message from me about my campaign.
[02:37:25.018 --> 02:37:27.979]  If a live person answers, then you just talk.
[02:37:27.979 --> 02:37:31.101]  You tell them about Peter Schiff and then you go on to the next call.
[02:37:31.101 --> 02:37:33.301]  There are some people, one person made over 800 calls.
[02:37:34.662 --> 02:37:35.163]  I don't know.
[02:37:58.166 --> 02:38:00.987]  Every single registered Republican, several times!
[02:38:00.987 --> 02:38:05.748]  And so, we can win this thing, and if I win the nomination, I can win the general election.
[02:38:05.748 --> 02:38:15.051]  It will be a huge publicity for me to come from behind, to beat the establishment, to beat Linda McMahon's money, and Dick Blumenthal, who's our Attorney General, he's vulnerable.
[02:38:15.051 --> 02:38:17.872]  I can beat that guy, especially if I debate him.
[02:38:17.872 --> 02:38:25.674]  You know, we had a debate initially when the three of us were there, and I beat everybody so badly, the press said that I won, nobody came in second.
[02:38:25.674 --> 02:38:27.275]  I can't, nobody will debate me anymore.
[02:38:27.643 --> 02:38:29.584]  Let me throw out some quick questions.
[02:38:29.584 --> 02:38:32.907]  I want to go to calls in the time we have here, Peter.
[02:38:32.907 --> 02:38:35.569]  So people basically get where you stand on things.
[02:38:35.569 --> 02:38:38.110]  But let me bring up the toughest issue first.
[02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:40.692]  But I want to add the caveat up front.
[02:38:40.692 --> 02:38:49.178]  I have watched the mainstream media, who loved having you on about economics, ignore your Senate campaign because they are scared of you.
[02:38:49.178 --> 02:38:51.680]  And you have been for abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:54.662]  And that's why I like you and support you and I think you're a great mind.
[02:38:55.282 --> 02:39:11.484]  Now expanding on that, and I know your family going back years has done important work fighting this whole corrupt system, but expanding on that, I think it hurts you six, eight months ago, and perhaps now you'd like to fill my listeners in on this, when you said
[02:39:12.105 --> 02:39:14.226]  This is where we think those weapons are.
[02:39:14.226 --> 02:39:16.286]  You need to let our inspectors in there.
[02:39:16.286 --> 02:39:19.707]  If they don't let us in, we just blow the place up.
[02:39:19.707 --> 02:39:23.748]  Speaking about Iran and reported weapon sites.
[02:39:23.748 --> 02:39:28.049]  So, I mean, obviously, you don't have to be a carbon copy of Ron Paul for people to support.
[02:39:28.049 --> 02:39:30.710]  His son is a bit more hawkish than he is.
[02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:37.792]  I would say you're a lot more hawkish from the statements I've seen, but perhaps those are out of context because people really don't want
[02:39:38.232 --> 02:39:39.433]  Yeah, well that's the main problem.
[02:40:02.648 --> 02:40:15.715]  Ron Paul had in the campaign, and I think, again, you know, I think the criticism was not warranted of Ron, but they were like, I love him on the economy, but I just can't vote for him because his defense is national security.
[02:40:15.715 --> 02:40:22.618]  So, I've got to win a Republican primary, so I can't appear as if I don't want any national defense, okay?
[02:40:22.618 --> 02:40:28.021]  And what I said in that one interview, again, and people spun it all out of proportion, they said, what?
[02:40:28.021 --> 02:40:30.062]  The guy gave me a hypothetical question.
[02:40:30.482 --> 02:40:33.705]  What if Iran was developing nuclear weapons?
[02:40:33.705 --> 02:40:35.787]  What would you do if they had nuclear weapons?
[02:40:35.787 --> 02:40:39.411]  I said, well, first I want to verify that they actually have them.
[02:40:39.411 --> 02:40:39.711]  Alright?
[02:40:39.711 --> 02:40:47.178]  I mean, if they have nuclear weapons, we need to find some method of diplomacy to verify if our intelligence is accurate.
[02:40:47.178 --> 02:40:49.360]  Is Iran building nuclear weapons?
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:55.105]  If they are building nuclear weapons, that is something that I, as an American, take as a serious threat.
[02:40:55.105 --> 02:40:58.968]  I do not think that we should allow Iran to build nuclear weapons.
[02:40:58.968 --> 02:41:12.159]  And what I said is, if diplomacy fails, and we have credible intelligence that says, here is a facility where they are developing nuclear weapons, I am not against using a military action to neutralize that facility, to bomb that facility.
[02:41:12.159 --> 02:41:12.819]  Absolutely.
[02:41:12.819 --> 02:41:15.980]  I said I am not in favor of invading and occupying the country.
[02:41:15.980 --> 02:41:24.783]  I don't want to do that, but I do want to use our might to prevent a nuclear weapon from being developed in a potential hostile part of the world.
[02:41:24.783 --> 02:41:29.905]  I don't want to wait for them to launch it and watch millions of people die and then retaliate.
[02:41:29.905 --> 02:41:38.388]  If we can simply and decisively and surgically remove that kind of threat, then that's what we need to do.
[02:41:38.388 --> 02:41:39.529]  And that's what Americans want.
[02:41:40.609 --> 02:41:40.989]  Well, Peter...
[02:42:06.451 --> 02:42:09.533]  Peter, that's all, I mean that's very eloquently said.
[02:42:09.533 --> 02:42:17.258]  The issue is we have a federal government that lied to us about WMDs in Iraq premeditatedly, yellow cake, aluminum tubes.
[02:42:17.258 --> 02:42:24.022]  So we've seen all this before and now, and now even... I was against, remember Alex, I was against in real time going into Iraq.
[02:42:24.022 --> 02:42:26.324]  I criticized President Bush for going into Iraq.
[02:42:26.544 --> 02:42:37.706]  No, no, Peter, I understand that what I'm trying to get across to you, and I know you're a smart guy, but for the audience to hear this as well, is that now we have a lot of Republicans coming out saying Afghanistan is Obama's war.
[02:42:37.706 --> 02:42:41.267]  We have the head of the Republican Party, Steele, saying that.
[02:42:41.267 --> 02:42:47.228]  We have Rohrabacher saying that most House Republicans think we shouldn't have gone to Iraq now.
[02:42:47.228 --> 02:42:54.469]  I'm just simply saying that I think Ron Paul's right about Iran, and even if they were to get a nuclear weapon, which their system is peaceful,
[02:42:55.269 --> 02:42:55.549]  I don't
[02:43:10.462 --> 02:43:16.165]  And certainly the system is ignoring you or attacking you, so that shows that they don't want you to be senator.
[02:43:16.165 --> 02:43:18.247]  That's why I've got you here and I support you.
[02:43:18.247 --> 02:43:27.092]  I'm just telling you that I will probably be attacked, you know, for saying Peter Schiff is better than these other candidates, and so I was putting that out there on the table because I am against attacking Iran.
[02:43:27.092 --> 02:43:30.494]  I mean, I am against preemptive strikes on countries.
[02:43:31.405 --> 02:43:31.905]  I think so.
[02:44:01.385 --> 02:44:03.567]  Well, Peter, we have a government that lied to us!
[02:44:25.623 --> 02:44:26.525]  We're good to go.
[02:44:40.395 --> 02:44:57.510]  No, I agree with you, but Peter, you're a well-spoken, intelligent guy who's made a lot of accurate predictions, and I'm only saying that with the grassroots, with the Rand Paul base, I think you would have seen the type of Rand Paul-level support
[02:44:58.891 --> 02:45:00.071]  I don't know.
[02:45:28.050 --> 02:45:29.431]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, though.
[02:45:29.431 --> 02:45:30.312]  I would tell you one thing.
[02:45:30.312 --> 02:45:38.420]  If I was going to take the position that a nuclear Iran was okay with me, then there'd be no point in my even asking for volunteers, because I couldn't win in the state of Connecticut.
[02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:44.886]  So, if I actually adopted that position, it wouldn't matter how many people worked for my campaign, I couldn't get elected.
[02:45:44.886 --> 02:45:46.167]  So, people have to decide.
[02:45:47.199 --> 02:45:48.620]  Is there enough positive things?
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:50.240]  I want to go there and shut down the government.
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:51.841]  I want to stop the deficit spending.
[02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:53.262]  I want to restore sanity.
[02:45:53.262 --> 02:45:55.303]  I don't want to see this country collapse.
[02:45:55.303 --> 02:45:56.643]  And that's what I'm going to do.
[02:45:56.643 --> 02:46:00.505]  And if people are going to say, gee, Peter's some kind of warmonger.
[02:46:00.505 --> 02:46:03.026]  I mean, if you think I'm going to Washington to start a war?
[02:46:03.026 --> 02:46:04.927]  I mean, you're crazy.
[02:46:04.927 --> 02:46:07.428]  Well, Peter, nobody... Look, I'm not saying that.
[02:46:09.218 --> 02:46:20.581]  Well, I think the statement is, if Iran developed nuclear weapons and there was provable intelligence, that they were going to try to deploy it, and were putting out rhetoric like they would use it then, and I think people would understand that more than just saying, blow the place up.
[02:46:43.575 --> 02:46:44.035]  Get out of there.
[02:46:44.035 --> 02:46:45.495]  No, no, I was just reading your quote.
[02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:50.396]  I understand, I understand you're saying, the place with the weapons, but I was quoting, just blow the place up.
[02:46:50.396 --> 02:46:51.176]  I don't mean Iran.
[02:46:51.176 --> 02:46:54.277]  It's weird, and that's if we know that they're there.
[02:46:54.277 --> 02:46:57.337]  It's such a... I'm trying to do the absolute minimum.
[02:46:57.337 --> 02:46:59.478]  And then there are people that say, oh no, we don't even want to do that.
[02:46:59.478 --> 02:47:08.519]  We want to wait until Iran actually drops a nuclear weapon, smuggles it into a major American city, murders millions of people, and then will respond.
[02:47:08.519 --> 02:47:12.820]  That is not the credible policy for a Senate candidate, I don't think.
[02:47:14.213 --> 02:47:17.899]  Vote for me and I'll allow a nuclear weapon to be blown up in your backyard.
[02:47:17.899 --> 02:47:21.084]  I don't think that's a passive victory.
[02:47:21.084 --> 02:47:24.871]  But believe me, that's what my opponents would say if that was my position.
[02:47:25.427 --> 02:47:26.207]  No, I understand.
[02:47:26.207 --> 02:47:31.671]  I was just getting the issue out there because, I mean, as you know, that was raised quite a bit, and so I hope you beat those other candidates.
[02:47:31.671 --> 02:47:32.991]  That's why we've got you here.
[02:47:32.991 --> 02:47:39.875]  I mean, I think you'd be a great guy to really push through the audit of the Fed, and I'd love to see you grilling them in banking committee meetings.
[02:47:39.875 --> 02:47:43.257]  It'd be wonderful, and I think you've got a shot at it, so people should certainly support.
[02:47:43.257 --> 02:47:46.059]  I just would be remiss if I didn't raise that.
[02:47:46.059 --> 02:47:51.642]  Let's jam in a few calls here, and then at the end, I want to ask you about your view on the Arizona situation and the borders.
[02:47:51.642 --> 02:47:52.603]  Let's talk to Ken
[02:47:53.303 --> 02:47:54.784]  In California.
[02:47:54.784 --> 02:47:56.606]  Go ahead, Ken, you're on the air.
[02:47:56.606 --> 02:47:57.066]  Oh, hi.
[02:47:57.066 --> 02:47:57.967]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:57.967 --> 02:48:00.268]  This is my question.
[02:48:00.268 --> 02:48:13.999]  Walmart had record profits for several years, and they got sued by counties all over the United States because they would provide no health insurance for 90% of their workers.
[02:48:13.999 --> 02:48:19.162]  Then, after this health care bill came out, all these lawsuits have been
[02:48:20.103 --> 02:48:26.447]  Well, Walmart's had unfair trade advantage with its inside deals with China.
[02:48:26.447 --> 02:48:27.807]  That's where the issue is.
[02:48:27.807 --> 02:48:29.528]  What would you do with healthcare, Peter Schiff?
[02:48:48.319 --> 02:48:49.119]  And no more bailouts!
[02:48:49.119 --> 02:48:50.420]  And no more bailouts!
[02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:51.820]  I mean, you pledged no more bailouts.
[02:49:16.168 --> 02:49:16.908]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:49:16.908 --> 02:49:18.349]  Good to speak to you.
[02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.689]  And Mr. Schiff,
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.501]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[02:49:45.501 --> 02:49:50.264]  What happens when we lose the dollar as the world reserve currency?
[02:50:12.930 --> 02:50:15.492]  Well, I mean, it's not a question of can we, it's just when we.
[02:50:15.492 --> 02:50:18.294]  And, you know, will it happen next year, two years from now?
[02:50:18.294 --> 02:50:19.975]  You know, it's going to happen.
[02:50:19.975 --> 02:50:34.024]  I mean, you can't... We became the world's reserve currency because the dollar was backed by gold, because we were the world's biggest creditor nation, we had the least amount of government regulations and the lowest taxes, we were flooding the world with investment capital and manufactured goods.
[02:50:34.024 --> 02:50:40.108]  I mean, we have nothing in common with the America that was able to secure the dollars, the world's reserve currency.
[02:50:40.108 --> 02:50:42.310]  We're now the world's biggest debtor, we have huge trade deficits,
[02:50:43.370 --> 02:50:47.673]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:50:47.673 --> 02:50:48.013]  Think again.
[02:51:08.422 --> 02:51:16.065]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:51:16.065 --> 02:51:23.289]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:51:23.289 --> 02:51:28.691]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[02:51:28.891 --> 02:51:31.854]  On how to clean the air on boats, aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[02:52:06.866 --> 02:52:08.107]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:08.107 --> 02:52:11.991]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:11.991 --> 02:52:14.293]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:14.293 --> 02:52:20.158]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:20.158 --> 02:52:26.384]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:26.804 --> 02:52:32.785]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:32.785 --> 02:52:36.966]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:36.966 --> 02:52:41.247]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:41.247 --> 02:52:47.188]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:47.188 --> 02:52:50.748]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:50.748 --> 02:52:52.729]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:52.729 --> 02:52:53.169]  It's here.

[02:53:02.113 --> 02:53:05.654]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:53:05.654 --> 02:53:07.935]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:53:07.935 --> 02:53:08.816]  Don't!
[02:53:08.816 --> 02:53:12.237]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:53:35.914 --> 02:53:37.115]  Herb K was right.
[02:53:37.115 --> 02:53:40.159]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:53:40.299 --> 02:53:41.560]  What do you have to lose?

[02:53:48.983 --> 02:53:49.023]  800-405-7850.
[02:54:06.687 --> 02:54:09.809]  Okay, I'm going to throw out four or five questions with one-line answers.
[02:54:09.809 --> 02:54:12.331]  Then we're going to take a few final calls with Peter Schiff.
[02:54:12.331 --> 02:54:17.735]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to get into all the military takeover drills, Marines on the streets of LA.
[02:54:17.735 --> 02:54:19.836]  This is mainstream news, MSNBC.
[02:54:19.836 --> 02:54:21.797]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:21.797 --> 02:54:24.880]  But right now, going back to Peter Schiff.
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:27.962]  Peter, where do you stand on the borders and on Arizona?
[02:54:28.643 --> 02:54:35.569]  Well, you know, I think protecting the borders is one of the few things the federal government should be doing, and it's not doing it because it's doing so many things that it shouldn't be doing.
[02:54:35.569 --> 02:54:41.614]  So, I do want to crack down on illegal immigration, but I want to make it easier for people who want to work at the immigration of the country.
[02:54:41.614 --> 02:54:43.495]  But, you know, I'm more concerned about emigration.
[02:54:43.495 --> 02:54:51.001]  I think if we don't do the right thing, waves and waves of Americans are going to be fleeing the country to escape oppressive taxation, regulation, and inflation.
[02:54:51.001 --> 02:54:54.004]  And I want to make sure that young Americans stay here and don't leave the country.
[02:54:54.892 --> 02:54:59.754]  Well, Mexico needs to fix its house instead of letting their whole system collapse into the United States.
[02:54:59.754 --> 02:55:01.234]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:55:01.234 --> 02:55:02.975]  The Second Amendment, where do you stand on that?
[02:55:02.975 --> 02:55:04.116]  I stand right behind it.
[02:55:04.116 --> 02:55:06.637]  And, you know, it's not about hunting and it's not about a militia.
[02:55:06.637 --> 02:55:09.818]  It's about preserving liberty, keeping the government in check.
[02:55:09.818 --> 02:55:14.560]  Americans need to be armed, you know, to preserve liberty and, of course, for crime.
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:23.003]  I mean, if you have gun control, all you do is take the guns away from law-abiding citizens and you empower the criminals because they know their victims are defenseless.
[02:55:24.344 --> 02:55:25.965]  Shift4Senate.com.
[02:55:25.965 --> 02:55:27.547]  Our websites are InfoWars.com.
[02:55:27.547 --> 02:55:37.255]  Don't forget the new film, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, that has solutions to take our states and county sheriffs back with myself, Sheriff Mac, and many others available at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:37.255 --> 02:55:40.398]  And your purchase of the films also finances this entire operation.
[02:55:40.398 --> 02:55:44.301]  Let's take a few final calls for Peter Schiff with quick questions and quick answers.
[02:55:44.301 --> 02:55:48.264]  Chris in Colorado wants to know your take on America's situation.
[02:55:48.264 --> 02:55:50.626]  I think we already kind of covered that, but real fast.
[02:55:50.626 --> 02:55:51.147]  Question, Chris.
[02:55:52.438 --> 02:55:54.339]  Hey, quick question.
[02:55:54.339 --> 02:56:02.444]  If you had 15 seconds to address Americans, to capture their attention, what would you do?
[02:56:02.444 --> 02:56:05.386]  I thought we'd stop the spending.
[02:56:05.386 --> 02:56:08.208]  We can't stimulate the economy until we shrink the government.
[02:56:08.208 --> 02:56:14.852]  We've got to preserve the Constitution, restore freedom, restore liberty, embrace the principles that made us wealthy.
[02:56:14.852 --> 02:56:17.394]  Don't follow the principles that impoverished other nations.
[02:56:19.966 --> 02:56:20.666]  Let's go ahead.
[02:56:20.666 --> 02:56:21.346]  Thank you, caller.
[02:56:21.346 --> 02:56:23.587]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Illinois.
[02:56:23.587 --> 02:56:24.927]  He has a question about mortgages.
[02:56:24.927 --> 02:56:26.787]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:56:26.787 --> 02:56:27.647]  Oh yes, Peter.
[02:56:27.647 --> 02:56:33.748]  I'm sick of the old battle cry of people that got mortgages they couldn't afford.
[02:56:33.748 --> 02:56:35.309]  I was able to afford mine.
[02:56:35.309 --> 02:56:37.109]  That was ten years ago.
[02:56:37.109 --> 02:56:39.529]  My income has been cut in half.
[02:56:39.529 --> 02:56:40.930]  I'm self-employed.
[02:56:40.930 --> 02:56:42.990]  I don't get unemployment insurance.
[02:56:42.990 --> 02:56:45.150]  That's a big niche you haven't addressed.
[02:56:45.150 --> 02:56:46.851]  I haven't heard anyone address.
[02:56:46.851 --> 02:56:48.731]  What do I supposed to do?
[02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:49.151]  About what?
[02:56:51.008 --> 02:56:52.389]  Where do I turn?
[02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:54.511]  Well, we're not saying you deserve to lose your mortgage.
[02:56:54.511 --> 02:56:56.232]  I mean, there's too many taxes.
[02:56:56.232 --> 02:56:59.134]  I mean, first of all, we gotta get the government out of the mortgage business.
[02:56:59.134 --> 02:57:01.936]  People should not be buying houses that they can't afford.
[02:57:01.936 --> 02:57:05.579]  And if you need the government to guarantee the mortgage, then you can't afford that house.
[02:57:05.579 --> 02:57:08.781]  You know, if you don't have a 20% down payment, you can't afford that house.
[02:57:08.781 --> 02:57:10.343]  We need to have a free market in housing.
[02:57:10.343 --> 02:57:14.446]  Well, government money in housing, Peter, as you know, is what drove up prices.
[02:57:15.046 --> 02:57:21.167]  Yeah, Jim, the answer is, if they wouldn't have put these trillions of dollars into government money, you wouldn't have had all the flipping of houses, and your house wouldn't be too expensive.
[02:57:21.167 --> 02:57:22.007]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:22.007 --> 02:57:22.708]  Matthew in Canada, last caller.
[02:57:22.708 --> 02:57:23.468]  Quick question for Peter Schiff.
[02:57:23.468 --> 02:57:23.948]  Yes, hello, Mr. Schiff.
[02:57:23.948 --> 02:57:26.108]  My question is, I'm a Canadian citizen, and I was just wondering,
[02:57:44.676 --> 02:57:50.962]  How do you see the state of the Canadian economy given the fact that the American economy is going down a drain?
[02:57:50.962 --> 02:57:51.802]  I think it's much better.
[02:57:51.802 --> 02:57:55.226]  You know, I've invested quite a bit of money in Canadian securities.
[02:57:55.226 --> 02:58:00.430]  I think Canada kind of got its fiscal health in order over a decade ago when they were having some problems.
[02:58:00.430 --> 02:58:03.833]  It's not a paradise up there in Canada, but compared to us they are.
[02:58:03.833 --> 02:58:07.457]  And I think, you know, we're having problems with immigration from south of our border.
[02:58:07.457 --> 02:58:10.019]  Pretty soon the Canadians are going to have the same problem with Americans.
[02:58:10.339 --> 02:58:11.780]  But I think that they will embrace us.
[02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:19.527]  I think as American refugees flee America for, you know, freer planes up in Canada, I think they will welcome Americans.
[02:58:19.527 --> 02:58:24.171]  But I think, unfortunately, a lot of Americans are going to find, you know, Canada to be their home.
[02:58:24.171 --> 02:58:25.272]  I mean, it's a little colder up there.
[02:58:25.712 --> 02:58:27.214]  Yeah, we're out of time.
[02:58:27.214 --> 02:58:33.220]  Canada is rated number one in the world right now for economies, but that doesn't mean much when it's a worldwide depression.
[02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:35.102]  Peter Schiff, I appreciate you joining us.
[02:58:35.102 --> 02:58:38.486]  We'll talk to you again right ahead of the election coming up in August.
