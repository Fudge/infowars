[00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.133]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.915]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:09.676]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.257]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:12.798]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:17.001]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.643 --> 00:00:33.565]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.746]  It is Monday, the 24th day of May, 2010.
[00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:40.229]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:48.535]  Christopher C. Horner, his new book, Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:53.481]  He'll be joining us coming up in the last hour today.
[00:00:53.481 --> 00:01:09.354]  In the first three hours of the radio broadcast, I'm gonna go over massive stacks of vitally important news on basically every subject under the sun, interspersed with your phone calls.
[00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:15.279]  And I want to hear what you have to say about all the issues
[00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:22.789]  That we are going to be covering here today.
[00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.910]  I want to discuss it all.
[00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:39.993]  Whether it's revealed how Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons or the fact that there's a populist constitutionalist realignment that's clearly happened.
[00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:42.854]  We're all incumbents in the last
[00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:48.357]  Round of primary elections.
[00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.340]  They have all lost.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.225]  If it's an establishment Democrat in the primary, they lose to the anti-establishment Democrat.
[00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.690]  If it's an establishment Republican, they lose to
[00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.972]  The anti-establishment Republican.
[00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:13.284]  And in the few cases where you have a seat being replaced by someone who's died, you have Republicans taking it away from Democrats.
[00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:16.769]  And we've never seen something like this happen before.
[00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.209]  Normally,
[00:02:18.408 --> 00:02:20.550]  One party's in favor, the other party's out of favor.
[00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:30.457]  The good news here is there is a massive political realignment against incumbents and the establishment, against the New World Order.
[00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:33.419]  What does Zbigniew Brzezinski say last week?
[00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:43.066]  He said, for the first time in history period, the entire world is awake to the true political structure and that makes it hard for the world government.
[00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:54.365]  That makes it hard for the world government.
[00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:57.088]  Because we're now aware of what they're doing.
[00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:00.593]  We're now awake to what they are doing.
[00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:04.190]  We've got a fighting chance at this.
[00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.011]  That's why the bankers are going for everything.
[00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.674]  They're trying to destroy the world economy to make us dependent on them now.
[00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:12.977]  They're trying to move in with a hardcore police state now.
[00:03:12.977 --> 00:03:30.491]  Though that reveals them to the planet at an even greater level, they know that down the road things just get tougher for them as more people really get educated on the deep politics of the real situation that we're facing as a society, the true geopolitical landscape.
[00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:33.788]  Here's the type of headlines we have.
[00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:38.550]  One false move in Europe could set off global chain reaction.
[00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.390]  Here's another.
[00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.171]  Euro down sharply as banking concerns resurface.
[00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.512]  Robini said the bubble would burst and it did.
[00:03:47.512 --> 00:03:48.652]  So what's next?
[00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:50.393]  We'll go over that.
[00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:50.673]  U.S.
[00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:54.014]  military told to get ready in Korean standoff.
[00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:57.655]  Obama orders commanders to prepare to deter further aggression.
[00:03:57.655 --> 00:03:57.995]  War.
[00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.874]  South Korea threatens war if North Korea makes one more provocation.
[00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:09.556]  Iranians shouting for jobs during Ahmadinejad's speech.
[00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:11.237]  The whole world's angry, folks.
[00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:12.978]  The whole world's in turmoil.
[00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:16.120]  This is how world wars start.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.380]  U.S.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.243]  State Department says conspiracy theories exist in the realm of myth.
[00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:25.048]  If you think global warming's not man-made, conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:31.156]  If you believe depleted uranium is bad for you to breathe, even when it's in the Army's own reports, conspiracy theory.
[00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:38.259]  Canadian government pays organization to troll political chat forums.
[00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.920]  That's from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.642]  Pentagon Cyber Command prepares war against the American people.
[00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:46.583]  Curt Nemo's excellent breakdown, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:48.764]  Obama calls for global government.
[00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:50.946]  A new international order.
[00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:53.347]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.108]  Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:56.968]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:57.729]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.381]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:06.984]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:11.986]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:17.029]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.794]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:22.794 --> 00:05:29.901]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:31.022]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:31.022 --> 00:05:37.388]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:40.891]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.113]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:44.053]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:44.254]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:47.696]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:49.478]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:06.001]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:07.002]  What have we got?
[00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:09.444]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:06:09.444 --> 00:06:10.444]  A republic.
[00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:13.106]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.367]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:17.389]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.953]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[00:06:22.953 --> 00:06:26.595]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:30.654]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:06:30.654 --> 00:06:31.934]  You are being warned.
[00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:32.954]  We have the facts.
[00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:34.115]  We have the Constitution.
[00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:35.015]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:35.916]  We have common law.
[00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:38.437]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:41.378]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:42.318]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:47.280]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.781]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:49.861]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:51.082]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:52.382 --> 00:06:56.731]  For PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:09.866]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:15.870]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.394]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.362]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.804]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:35.411]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:38.935]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:42.799]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[00:07:45.962 --> 00:07:49.125]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.327]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:54.990]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.695]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:06.080]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.382]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.653 --> 00:08:22.575]  I've been meaning to cover this since last Thursday and I've never gotten to it.
[00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:28.598]  So later in the third hour today, I will cover it.
[00:08:28.598 --> 00:08:33.980]  Because it deals with media, it deals with culture, it deals with borders, sovereignty.
[00:08:36.263 --> 00:08:42.367]  Robert Rodriguez backpedals on his message to Arizona is the headline.
[00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:45.950]  It's also being reported on in the Fort Worth Star Telegram.
[00:08:45.950 --> 00:09:01.000]  And Rodriguez has now given an interview, the film director, to Ain't It Cool News, actually last Thursday, I just haven't had time to go over it yet, saying, okay, he's going to edit the race war stuff out of his film.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.681]  So there you have it.
[00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:10.762]  We have the script.
[00:09:10.762 --> 00:09:11.782]  We knew what was in it.
[00:09:11.782 --> 00:09:12.942]  I know it's dangerous.
[00:09:12.942 --> 00:09:14.703]  I know it's racist.
[00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:16.744]  I know it creates division.
[00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:19.725]  And I never called for him to edit his film.
[00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:25.126]  I simply stated that he was on the hook for it when it caused violence.
[00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:30.608]  And there's no doubt it would generate at least some copycat violence.
[00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.089]  But I'm going to go back over that.
[00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:42.558]  Coming up for about 10-15 minutes in the third hour today.
[00:09:42.558 --> 00:09:45.179]  Now here's what I want to do.
[00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:50.460]  I have all these important stacks of news and information I want to cover.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.980]  But I want to shake the radio broadcast up.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.622]  And I'm always attempting to take calls in the first hour and to take a lot of your calls and I rarely succeed.
[00:09:59.622 --> 00:10:01.102]  But we're going to do it today.
[00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:07.343]  Sometimes we succeed, but we're going to succeed today.
[00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:14.424]  No matter how riveting or thought-provoking or compelling your story is, you got to tell it in 60 seconds.
[00:10:14.424 --> 00:10:20.485]  And then I've got to have my comments or addendums to what you have to say in 15 seconds.
[00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:22.245]  So that's about a call every minute and a half.
[00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:28.487]  Because it takes 15 seconds or so just to say, hello, yes, thank you, good to have you with us.
[00:10:28.487 --> 00:10:30.767]  You're calling from Timbuktu or
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.021]  Wherever you're calling from.
[00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:53.217]  We want to hear from you today, and I want to get your take on the Rand Paul situation, the North Korea situation, the Iran situation, the government health care bill, with all the new tax rules and regulations now hitting.
[00:10:53.217 --> 00:10:57.120]  Also want to add, we do have some interesting surprise guests coming up later in the week.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.702]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:10:59.633 --> 00:11:14.878]  You'll definitely want to join us tomorrow, you'll definitely want to join us on Thursday, and of course you'll want to join us each and every day, but Friday looks like it's shaping up to be quite interesting and informative as well.
[00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:26.022]  So before I get into this pantheon, this panoptagon, this cornucopia of news and information,
[00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:40.660]  I'm going to open the phones up right now and any subject, question, comment, you agree with me, you disagree, you want to call me out on the carpet for something, the only thing you're not allowed to do is call in and praise me, okay?
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.283]  Just because I don't have the highest view of myself.
[00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:48.383]  I'm doing the best I can.
[00:11:48.383 --> 00:11:49.084]  I'm doing my duty.
[00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:51.800]  And I appreciate everybody's support.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:12:11.888]  If you support and appreciate what I'm doing, then please get the films, make copies of them, get them out to everybody you know, have public showings, air them on AXS TV, spread the URL to the websites, the news articles that my great writers, Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, and others put together.
[00:12:11.888 --> 00:12:12.788]  That's why we're here.
[00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:14.689]  We're here to stop this New World Order.
[00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:18.651]  Look, I know that you've got better things to do to fight the New World Order.
[00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:23.083]  Believe me, I'd rather be fishing every day with my children.
[00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:24.184]  I'd rather be canoeing.
[00:12:24.184 --> 00:12:26.265]  I'd rather be camping every weekend.
[00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:28.187]  I'd rather be rock climbing.
[00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:30.668]  I would rather be barbecuing.
[00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:34.991]  I would rather be on a softball team.
[00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.854]  If you really want to get down to brass tacks, I'm a jock, folks.
[00:12:38.854 --> 00:12:43.737]  I would be playing softball or baseball year-round.
[00:12:43.737 --> 00:12:48.000]  I would be probably in a boxing club.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.001]  I would be camping every weekend.
[00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:53.981]  That's what I'd be doing.
[00:12:53.981 --> 00:13:13.346]  I mean, you're only alive once, but I'm here six, seven days a week, working as many hours as I can, because I realize that all of the wonderful things in the world, all the freedoms, all the things that are so special, are going bye-bye very quickly.
[00:13:13.346 --> 00:13:15.727]  This isn't the incremental march of big government anymore.
[00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.767]  Okay, this is Mach 10 with its hair on fire.
[00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:24.749]  This is all coming down now.
[00:13:24.749 --> 00:13:26.590]  Are you noticing?
[00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.872]  They're talking about nuclear war with North Korea, and this is real, folks.
[00:13:30.872 --> 00:13:43.940]  North Korea is evil, does have nukes, is out of control, did torpedo that ship, is trying to start World War III, is run by a psychopathic munchkin goblin named Kim Jong-il.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.762]  I'm going to talk about that coming up.
[00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.530]  And who gave him the nukes?
[00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.751]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:54.353]  Who put aspartame in your food and in your drinks?
[00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:56.534]  Over 10,000 foods now.
[00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:57.594]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:13:57.594 --> 00:13:58.755]  Who got DU approved?
[00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:02.216]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.877]  If it's evil, Donald Rumsfeld did it.
[00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.818]  Who gave weapon systems to Saddam and the nerve gas?
[00:14:06.818 --> 00:14:11.060]  And the helicopters and the satellite images to use it?
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.401]  And the CIA weather reports?
[00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:14.762]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:16.322]  Who's going to Hades when he dies?
[00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.103]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:20.877]  This is the type of real issues we're dealing with.
[00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:28.222]  We're headed into a World War III, any way you slice it, and coming up next hour I'm going to break down what World War III is going to look like.
[00:14:28.222 --> 00:14:34.026]  The different ways these balls can break when the 8-ball slams into them, okay?
[00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:43.052]  I'm going to tell you about the different type of scenarios we're looking at.
[00:14:43.052 --> 00:14:45.554]  So that's all coming up.
[00:14:47.312 --> 00:14:51.336]  But I'm going to take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:55.300]  We don't screen your phone calls.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.321]  We have a lot of great callers.
[00:14:56.321 --> 00:15:04.068]  We also have a lot of callers that call in who I think are drinking a half bottle of whiskey or smoking 10 marijuana cigarettes and sound like they're asleep.
[00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:05.970]  So if you're asleep, I'm hanging up on you.
[00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.153]  No hard feelings.
[00:15:09.153 --> 00:15:10.715]  All's fair in love and war here.
[00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:14.068]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:20.571]  Let's go to John in Illinois.
[00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:22.151]  John, you're on the air.
[00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:24.132]  Welcome.
[00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:27.553]  Alex, this may be an old news item that crossed your desk before.
[00:15:27.553 --> 00:15:29.634]  It's from August 2008.
[00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:38.397]  California activists propose a wealth tax and probable unconstitutional exit tax, where they want to tax you at like 55%
[00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:45.513]  Well, those are both excellent points, and I did see that idea floated a few years ago.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.884]  To have an exit tax, and they've already put exit taxes into the US that go into effect next year.
[00:16:10.884 --> 00:16:14.326]  I mean, they've ratcheted a few up over the years, but the big ones go in next year.
[00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:20.831]  That's why all the money, I mean, the big money has all been leaving the last three years.
[00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:26.795]  It's a mass exodus because they know they're calling in a government airstrike on the country.
[00:16:26.795 --> 00:16:29.577]  Most of them are involved in it, so they're, you know, getting out of the way of their own
[00:16:30.994 --> 00:16:34.395]  Stage terror attacks and financial implosions.
[00:16:34.395 --> 00:16:42.798]  They're all running off to Caribbean and Mediterranean islands and South American islands and armored redoubts in the Cook Islands.
[00:16:42.798 --> 00:16:44.099]  And so that's going on.
[00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:49.661]  And listen, folks, California has collapsed, OK?
[00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:50.641]  It has collapsed.
[00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:52.742]  Mexico has collapsed.
[00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:56.303]  And the Texas border hadn't been safe in a decade.
[00:16:56.303 --> 00:16:59.304]  But now I've had family that's gone down there on business.
[00:17:01.472 --> 00:17:23.528]  Uh, and everything's boarded up, the hotels are shut down, it is a war zone, you can hear machine gun fire every night, media that speaks out against what is killed, hand grenade attacks, truck bombs, kidnappings, mass murder everywhere, ranchers being slaughtered, even nice ranchers who put out water for the illegals, the coyotes just come in and kill them because they want to
[00:17:24.028 --> 00:17:25.669]  Have the ranch house for themselves.
[00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:30.771]  The police cower literally with the yellow streams going down their legs.
[00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:34.412]  I've had sheriff on who were robbed at gunpoints.
[00:17:34.412 --> 00:17:38.714]  The Mexican troops will come up to their police stations, up to their cars, pull guns on them.
[00:17:38.714 --> 00:17:42.376]  The police get down on their ground, basically lick their boots.
[00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:47.158]  And it's just total implosion of society all by CIA design.
[00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:54.460]  And this is all part of the North American Union, but I'm supposed to be real proud of it and love it and say, yes, Felipe called Iran.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.520]  Take my semi-automatic guns.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.461]  You are my king.
[00:17:57.461 --> 00:17:59.321]  I appreciate your call, John.
[00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:03.583]  Now, see, John did limit himself to a minute, and I didn't, so.
[00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.303]  It's just, it's a total raping.
[00:18:06.303 --> 00:18:07.584]  It's just, they're going to take everything.
[00:18:07.584 --> 00:18:11.945]  I mean, this is what happens in the final phase of a society collapsing.
[00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:13.585]  They're looting Rome right now.
[00:18:13.585 --> 00:18:15.186]  Ryan in Alaska, you're on the air.
[00:18:16.215 --> 00:18:20.176]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say something about the illegal immigration stuff.
[00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:21.236]  You mean the gods?
[00:18:21.236 --> 00:18:23.576]  Yes, would you like to pray to them?
[00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:25.197]  Uh, yeah.
[00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:26.477]  Well, I got myself in trouble.
[00:18:26.477 --> 00:18:33.398]  I got a DOI not too long ago, and I'm not even allowed to step foot in Canada for the next five years.
[00:18:33.398 --> 00:18:36.639]  Well, but meanwhile the illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:38.799]  That's right.
[00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:39.519]  And it's admitted!
[00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:42.640]  You know, I've had illegals call in and go, yeah, I get let go for drinking and driving, so what?
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.883]  Because again, they're key to bringing the country down.
[00:18:48.883 --> 00:18:54.068]  Do you know if there's any more as far as needing passports to go between states?
[00:18:54.068 --> 00:19:10.401]  The feds are saying that under federal jurisdiction, under the REAL ID Act, they're going to set up, and this was back under Clinton but now it's official, hardened checkpoints to go from state to state, claiming that under interstate commerce, the feds now control the state borders and hence the states.
[00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:34.920]  And the feds are saying to go on a national park or to fly on an airplane or to have a job or file any taxes or get a bank account or a car loan or a rental car or any of the thousands of things under Patriot Act compliance that you will have to have the Real ID Act ID card to have a job but again the illegals are all by executive fiat given waivers and selective enforcement.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]  So again as I say
[00:19:36.912 --> 00:19:39.214]  We, the American people, are the roaches.
[00:19:39.214 --> 00:19:41.455]  We're not allowed to get out of the country.
[00:19:41.455 --> 00:19:44.897]  We're here for one reason and one reason only.
[00:19:44.897 --> 00:19:48.480]  We're here to be bled dry and worship government.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.301]  Land of the coward, home of the bootlicking slave.
[00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.763]  And until we realize that, we'll never get it back.
[00:19:53.763 --> 00:19:57.025]  Until you get angry and face up the trouble we're in, it's over.
[00:19:57.025 --> 00:19:57.806]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.660]  Fact.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.261]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:03.261 --> 00:20:05.382]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:05.382 --> 00:20:05.903]  Fact.
[00:20:05.903 --> 00:20:09.585]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:10.205]  Fact.
[00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:15.709]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.709 --> 00:20:16.069]  Fact.
[00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:20.551]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:21.132]  Fact.
[00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:24.834]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:21:00.683 --> 00:21:03.625]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:07.768]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:10.050]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:15.214]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:15.214 --> 00:21:17.035]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:17.035 --> 00:21:18.356]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:18.576 --> 00:21:20.057]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:20.057 --> 00:21:23.438]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:23.438 --> 00:21:28.800]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:37.904]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:21:38.144 --> 00:21:38.665]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.118 --> 00:22:06.241]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:13.705]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:22:13.705 --> 00:22:19.448]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:22:19.448 --> 00:22:22.409]  Starve or surrender.
[00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:26.211]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:27.112]  What then?
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.905]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:22:32.905 --> 00:22:37.226]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.

[00:23:00.219 --> 00:23:03.603]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[00:24:04.308 --> 00:24:08.031]  We are in a scientific dictatorship.
[00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:15.576]  The latest technological developments are being used to brainwash, dumb down and mesmerize the already poisoned public.
[00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:22.817]  The Cybersecurity Command is now, quote, stood up, as the Pentagon says it.
[00:24:22.817 --> 00:24:30.521]  And in all of its real-world training, it's out there countering free speech, supporters of the Republic, true Americans.
[00:24:30.521 --> 00:24:33.762]  Because the Pentagon itself is now run by offshore banks.
[00:24:33.762 --> 00:24:40.265]  Either we wake up to this fact and speak out against it, or it is over as a society.
[00:24:41.345 --> 00:24:43.706]  The globalists are not going to give us quarter.
[00:24:43.706 --> 00:24:49.310]  I'm going to cover the latest cyber security developments as well, coming up in the next hour.
[00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.731]  But right now, let's talk to Ernie in California.
[00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:53.812]  Ernie, you're on the air.
[00:24:53.812 --> 00:24:54.773]  Hey Alex, real quick.
[00:24:54.773 --> 00:24:56.574]  I'm going to be fast, just like you said.
[00:24:56.574 --> 00:24:57.174]  Okay.
[00:24:57.174 --> 00:25:04.919]  Hey, on the 21st, Governor Brewer of Arizona did a little interview with Gretchen, what's her name, Gretchen... Greta Van Sestern.
[00:25:05.464 --> 00:25:06.564]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:25:06.564 --> 00:25:08.445]  And this lady was right on.
[00:25:08.445 --> 00:25:12.066]  And it's basically the government's not doing nothing.
[00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:16.107]  Just like this oil spill, which personally I think is a hella burden job.
[00:25:16.107 --> 00:25:17.747]  This is a disaster of Obama.
[00:25:17.747 --> 00:25:19.328]  They're looking at it like it's nothing.
[00:25:19.328 --> 00:25:20.668]  And just one weird thing.
[00:25:20.668 --> 00:25:29.511]  I was watching the movie Knowing with Nicolas Cage the other day, and one of the disasters on the prediction was an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf on fire.
[00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:31.011]  Are they sticking it in our face again?
[00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:33.668]  And that's all I gotta say.
[00:25:33.668 --> 00:25:35.889]  Other than that, I am against the New World Order.
[00:25:35.889 --> 00:25:45.593]  I'm pushing out your videos as much as I can, but this lady's on, this administration is pushing the New World and they're laughing and destroying our country on the ocean and on the inside.
[00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:46.434]  Thank you.
[00:25:46.434 --> 00:25:47.334]  Well, thank you.
[00:25:47.334 --> 00:25:52.377]  Thirty-five, thirty-six days into this, I think they blew it up on purpose more and more.
[00:25:52.377 --> 00:25:55.298]  You say, why would BP do this?
[00:25:55.298 --> 00:25:56.719]  Why would... Well, BP
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.282]  He's the main funder of sustainability, i.e.
[00:26:00.282 --> 00:26:01.603]  land grabbing.
[00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:06.166]  BP is the main pusher of the global warming taxes, on record.
[00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:09.028]  They were the main sponsor of the Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:26:09.028 --> 00:26:14.132]  And the globalists are all about falling on their sword and being rebuilt later.
[00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:19.615]  And so they pay a few billion bucks, but in the cost of oil going up, they make a few billion extra.
[00:26:19.615 --> 00:26:26.921]  And then it becomes a great political diversion for all the legislation moving its way through Congress and the gear up towards war.
[00:26:28.666 --> 00:26:36.691]  And this very oil rig was given awards by Obama two hours before they were reporting problems.
[00:26:36.691 --> 00:26:38.492]  They've been lying about it since day one.
[00:26:38.492 --> 00:26:47.458]  He had announced they were going to allow offshore drilling everywhere and then suddenly this happens and it's always, well it's actually BP that gets most of the Alaska oil.
[00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:50.079]  That's what a sweetheart deal they've got with our government.
[00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:55.683]  They're so elite, owned by the Queen of the Netherlands and the Queen of England are the two partners, biggest partners in it.
[00:26:57.608 --> 00:27:04.450]  That now this is going to allow a shutdown of oil drilling all over, not just the coastlines of the U.S., but inside the U.S.
[00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.750]  And I could go on and on.
[00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.611]  It's taken me over a month.
[00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:10.632]  I've just let the information collate.
[00:27:10.632 --> 00:27:13.112]  You know, I mean, a good cop will call it a hunch.
[00:27:13.112 --> 00:27:15.253]  It's not really a hunch, folks.
[00:27:15.253 --> 00:27:19.434]  It's the human brain you've got, the incredible supercomputer.
[00:27:19.434 --> 00:27:23.415]  And I just get all the data, and then a lot of times I can't even tell you why.
[00:27:23.415 --> 00:27:26.676]  You know, simply, I think it's an inside job.
[00:27:28.894 --> 00:27:36.380]  I just suddenly in my gut know, and then I could go over all the evidence, which we just covered some of it, it's just, it's my gut.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:44.466]  Now something like Gulf of Tonkin, it's not my gut, it's been declassified that was staged, or Operation Ajax, or Operation Gladio, or 9-11, or 7-7.
[00:27:44.466 --> 00:27:51.471]  By the way, of all places, that's the London Guardian headline, government investigating MI5 role in 7-7.
[00:27:54.704 --> 00:27:58.688]  Wow, five years later and the government role.
[00:27:58.688 --> 00:28:00.069]  In fact, guys, I had that article.
[00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:01.490]  Will you reprint me that?
[00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.151]  I can't find it.
[00:28:02.151 --> 00:28:04.533]  It was in my stack and it was moved.
[00:28:04.533 --> 00:28:05.394]  Thank you.
[00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:09.798]  Government role, MI5 role in 7-7 Problem and Guardian.
[00:28:09.798 --> 00:28:10.959]  I want to go over some of that today.
[00:28:10.959 --> 00:28:13.421]  I meant to cover it yesterday.
[00:28:13.421 --> 00:28:15.202]  But okay, let's go back to your calls.
[00:28:15.202 --> 00:28:19.526]  Let's talk to Gary in New Orleans, getting hit by the oil.
[00:28:19.526 --> 00:28:20.147]  Gary, welcome.
[00:28:21.257 --> 00:28:23.039]  Hey, appreciate it.
[00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:34.214]  I'm calling from WGSO 990 AM, this is the Patriot Radio Show, and we're calling for advice because the New World Order is at our doorstep at the moment, and what's happened for the last 30 days
[00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:38.261]  It's the same template as Katrina.
[00:28:38.261 --> 00:28:49.528]  All help locally or on the state level has been denied, and now the oil is already through Grand Isle, already into Timalaya Bay, and they're still not allowing any help.
[00:28:49.528 --> 00:28:52.250]  And they don't allow the media to go.
[00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.312]  Even CBS, they're told, look, we're private contractors.
[00:28:55.312 --> 00:28:56.533]  BP's in command.
[00:28:56.533 --> 00:28:57.914]  Back up.
[00:28:57.914 --> 00:28:58.214]  Right.
[00:28:58.214 --> 00:29:01.596]  Well, what's happening is that the fishermen... BP blew it on purpose.
[00:29:01.596 --> 00:29:01.957]  I'm sorry.
[00:29:01.957 --> 00:29:02.257]  Go ahead.
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:11.433]  Yes sir, but what I'm calling for is advice because the fishermen and the local people are lining up because there's no more time to waste.
[00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:13.674]  And what would be the best course of action?
[00:29:13.674 --> 00:29:17.556]  Would it be to try to set up a fund for the parish president?
[00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:23.779]  Because, let me just say this, Janet Napolitano is in cutoff Louisiana right now.
[00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:26.640]  That should tell you enough that we're in an emergency.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.780]  So what can we do?
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.202]  Because we're at the point to where the governor's saying we can't wait anymore.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.705]  Um, FEMA, Homeland Security, they're saying we have to, uh, just wait.
[00:29:36.705 --> 00:29:39.447]  And, um, it's already destroying us.
[00:29:39.447 --> 00:29:45.192]  And on top of that, they're dispersing this corrected chemical, and it's, um... Which is worse than the oil.
[00:29:45.192 --> 00:29:48.575]  Yeah, oil is gooping and messy, but it's not that toxic.
[00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:50.958]  Stay there.
[00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:52.359]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:54.881]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:57.604]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:01.977]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.977 --> 00:30:05.340]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:24.295]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:30:24.295 --> 00:30:30.821]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:30:36.065 --> 00:30:37.366]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.501]  Thank you!
[00:30:59.932 --> 00:31:02.334]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:02.334 --> 00:31:04.656]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:31:04.656 --> 00:31:07.858]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:31:07.858 --> 00:31:12.962]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:31:12.962 --> 00:31:17.146]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:19.808]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:31:19.808 --> 00:31:22.711]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:25.614]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:33.222]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:38.934]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:31:38.934 --> 00:31:41.796]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:31:41.796 --> 00:31:45.479]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:46.559]  And I got news for you.
[00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:47.900]  You're everyone else.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.402]  Invisible Empire.

[00:32:00.506 --> 00:32:03.507]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.507 --> 00:32:08.850]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.891]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.891 --> 00:32:15.893]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.893 --> 00:32:17.074]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.074 --> 00:32:18.194]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.194 --> 00:32:20.075]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.075 --> 00:32:21.156]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.156 --> 00:32:23.357]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.357 --> 00:32:24.697]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.697 --> 00:32:26.018]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.218 --> 00:32:31.484]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.484 --> 00:32:35.068]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:38.893]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.893 --> 00:32:40.134]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.134 --> 00:32:41.035]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.035 --> 00:32:42.137]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.137 --> 00:32:43.078]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.078 --> 00:32:43.839]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:47.200]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:54.723]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:54.723 --> 00:32:55.884]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:55.884 --> 00:33:07.448]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.448 --> 00:33:09.649]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:17.247 --> 00:33:26.655]  Folks on a similar vein, along the lines of the oil spill, the globalists are into the occult, and they're into numerology.
[00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:31.980]  And they believe that they have to tell you what they're going to do before they do it.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:43.971]  That's why they had TV ads, radio ads, print ads, movies, in the lead-up to 9-11, where they told you, on 9-11, we're going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[00:33:44.872 --> 00:33:54.185]  To the point of, I was able to go on air six months before, three months before, and specifically two months before, and lay out how and when it was going to happen.
[00:33:54.185 --> 00:33:54.946]  And that's on record.
[00:33:55.745 --> 00:34:05.209]  Remember they had Lone Gunman episodes where the government hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center and uses a drill to make NORAD stand down.
[00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.250]  They're going to blame it on Afghanistan.
[00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.831]  The exact same thing happened.
[00:34:08.831 --> 00:34:14.354]  We just confirmed, my wife kept telling me to watch this Nicolas Cage movie, but I didn't have time, called Knowing.
[00:34:14.354 --> 00:34:18.535]  And it's about the end of the world and basically aliens rapture us.
[00:34:18.535 --> 00:34:21.177]  It's like a UFO cult meets Revelations.
[00:34:22.117 --> 00:34:28.278]  And we just went and watched the clip on the TV screen from the film as he's waking up.
[00:34:28.278 --> 00:34:35.940]  April 20th, there is a oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico and a huge oil leak.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.761]  And this is April 20th, 2010 in the movie.
[00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:43.022]  Well, guess what happened on April 20th, 2010?
[00:34:43.022 --> 00:34:47.703]  And the folks that pointed this out from the knowing, it's a YouTube clip of it,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:56.802]  They point out, they show the so-called CNN reporter on the knowing, and then they cut to the real CNN reporter saying almost word-for-word the same thing.
[00:34:56.802 --> 00:35:09.206]  This is just like Oil Storm, the made-for-TV movie, where they even got the mayor of New Orleans to be in it about a hurricane hitting and it flooding everything and people going to the Superdome.
[00:35:09.206 --> 00:35:13.467]  They love throwing it in our face.
[00:35:13.467 --> 00:35:14.287]  And yes, I've had
[00:35:15.868 --> 00:35:18.349]  Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons on.
[00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:21.011]  Stanford Research Institute, 67.
[00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:25.553]  They've been creating and controlling and steering hurricanes since the early 60s, but U.S.
[00:35:25.553 --> 00:35:34.197]  government certified in 1967, and that's up on PrisonPlanet.tv, that full interview if you want to watch it from four years ago.
[00:35:34.197 --> 00:35:35.598]  But I can't even handle this anymore.
[00:35:35.598 --> 00:35:38.379]  In fact, get me Paul Watson on air right now.
[00:35:38.379 --> 00:35:39.840]  Just get me Paul Watson on air.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.701]  Dial him in right now.
[00:35:40.701 --> 00:35:43.062]  I want to talk to Watson live on air right now.
[00:35:44.923 --> 00:35:47.205]  These people, I just can't handle it.
[00:35:47.205 --> 00:35:52.570]  They love the plausible deniability of putting this in their movies.
[00:35:52.570 --> 00:36:01.999]  And if they are starting to plant things, because I'm now reading the synopsis, looks like it has North Korea in the movie, a bunch of, and now that started up.
[00:36:01.999 --> 00:36:03.520]  The globalists just love to play God.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.943]  That's why they love weather control, tectonic weapons.
[00:36:07.583 --> 00:36:09.024]  And this is a conspiracy theory.
[00:36:09.024 --> 00:36:13.866]  This is conspiracy fact that they do this kind of stuff.
[00:36:13.866 --> 00:36:25.172]  So when we go live on TV next hour, I'm going to get into this, and why the globalists engage in these type of activities.
[00:36:25.172 --> 00:36:28.573]  While they're getting Watson on the line, I want to talk to him live on air.
[00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:34.636]  I'm going to give this job to Watson.
[00:36:34.636 --> 00:36:35.917]  Just tell him I'm putting him on air right now.
[00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:39.180]  Good.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:48.206]  And then I'm going to go back to Gary, Julio, Kathy, Tommy, Mike, Tommy, Chris, and others.
[00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:53.409]  Watson, are you there?
[00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:54.890]  Are you there, Watson?
[00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.371]  Yeah.
[00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:57.732]  You weren't listening to the show, were you?
[00:36:57.732 --> 00:37:01.495]  No, I was finishing an article.
[00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:04.397]  An article on what?
[00:37:04.397 --> 00:37:04.937]  Rand Paul.
[00:37:07.842 --> 00:37:10.086]  Oh, I tell you, that's just disgusting what they're doing to him.
[00:37:10.086 --> 00:37:16.215]  Okay, well, we're live on the air right now, just so you know.
[00:37:16.215 --> 00:37:23.205]  I got shook up by what I just saw because it's just, it's gotta be the, it's happened over a hundred times.
[00:37:24.574 --> 00:37:53.552]  Now remember all those articles you wrote and that I wrote and that the videos we posted in like 2002, 2003, 2004 about how the New York lottery on the one-year anniversary came up 9-1-1 only in New York or how they had TV ads, radio ads, lone gunmen, other shows where the government is going to blow up the towers for martial law and they're going to use a drill to make NORAD stand down and all the numerology and
[00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:54.685]  Yes.
[00:38:06.272 --> 00:38:12.376]  And how they have this revelation of the method to condition the public and why they do it.
[00:38:12.376 --> 00:38:14.878]  How it's like a psychopathic calling card.
[00:38:14.878 --> 00:38:19.141]  You know, like psychos like to taunt the police department before they strike again.
[00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:28.247]  But they also believe that it gives them more magical power in the first level of the lesser magic to make the announcement publicly beforehand.
[00:38:28.247 --> 00:38:30.969]  Nicholas Cage made a film called The Knowing.
[00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:32.950]  My wife says it's powerful.
[00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.011]  I've read the synopsis.
[00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:34.751]  I haven't seen it.
[00:38:34.751 --> 00:38:35.892]  Have you seen The Knowing?
[00:38:37.813 --> 00:38:38.453]  No, I haven't.
[00:38:38.453 --> 00:38:39.833]  I'm just watching the trailer now.
[00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:58.192]  Just get Saddle Up and go get it right now.
[00:38:58.192 --> 00:38:59.613]  Thank you.
[00:38:59.613 --> 00:39:25.004]  In the film, we've confirmed this from YouTube clips of it, they show a CNN clip, 2010, April 20th, where they blow up, where a giant oil rig blows up with an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, and this is one of the trigger points for the aliens slash angels to have a rapture of the good humans before they blow the earth up.
[00:39:29.093 --> 00:39:31.095]  This is about 99% confirmed.
[00:39:31.095 --> 00:39:33.977]  They do say April 20th on the clip, I saw that.
[00:39:33.977 --> 00:39:38.721]  The oil rig blast did happen April 20th.
[00:39:38.721 --> 00:39:39.822]  I pulled it up, correct men?
[00:39:39.822 --> 00:39:43.144]  I mean, it is 35 days later, correct?
[00:39:43.144 --> 00:39:44.986]  And it is the 24th today.
[00:39:44.986 --> 00:39:49.430]  The oil rig blast did happen on April 20th, correct?
[00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.072]  I just checked it during the break.
[00:39:52.072 --> 00:39:54.794]  We already confirmed it myself, but you can confirm it out there, correct?
[00:39:56.638 --> 00:39:57.398]  Yeah.
[00:39:57.398 --> 00:39:57.638]  Confirmed.
[00:39:57.638 --> 00:39:59.279]  I'll get on it straight away.
[00:40:21.314 --> 00:40:21.614]  Okay.
[00:40:21.614 --> 00:40:21.694]  Okay.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.681]  Okay?
[00:40:42.681 --> 00:40:48.646]  Yeah, but I don't want to wait just to send him a camera, because he's going with this whole camera line to mail it to England and get it hooked up.
[00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:53.530]  I want to have him on tomorrow with the video Skype connection he's got.
[00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.751]  Okay?
[00:40:54.751 --> 00:41:02.557]  I don't see, because there's a thing in society, and patriots do it, the general public does it, we always want to do something perfect before we do it.
[00:41:03.257 --> 00:41:13.664]  Imagine, would Lewis and Clark have gone across the country if they'd have waited to have it done perfectly, to have like a three-lane, you know, highway on both sides, blacktop paved with rest stops every mile?
[00:41:13.664 --> 00:41:14.685]  No.
[00:41:14.685 --> 00:41:15.986]  Okay, it's not a big deal.
[00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:17.587]  This is not Lewis and Clark.
[00:41:17.587 --> 00:41:19.248]  Watson will be on Skype.
[00:41:19.248 --> 00:41:23.491]  I'm sick of the bad telephone.
[00:41:23.491 --> 00:41:25.253]  Appreciate you joining us, Watson.
[00:41:25.253 --> 00:41:25.573]  Goodbye.
[00:41:25.573 --> 00:41:29.115]  Alright, we're going to disconnect him now.
[00:41:29.115 --> 00:41:31.137]  I'll just direct everything here.
[00:41:34.841 --> 00:41:39.766]  You know what, I mean, it almost does a disservice for me to even come on air and talk about this.
[00:41:39.766 --> 00:41:43.931]  We ought to be running around the streets, pulling our hair out, screaming and yelling.
[00:41:43.931 --> 00:41:49.057]  I mean, I was sent an internal Big Brother video.
[00:41:50.643 --> 00:42:17.215]  for government in England by a security contractor about face scanning body recognition technology and about how it's the government against the people and I just I can't even watch it it's so evil and and and the sickening narrator they got you know who who'll be like a movie star to the psychopath government people that watch it and it should be ruled by a bunch of inbred psychopaths that think it's funny all the stuff they do and I know the public thinks it's funny when I tell your water supplies being poisoned
[00:42:18.015 --> 00:42:21.418]  And of course they're not letting people clean up the oil.
[00:42:21.418 --> 00:42:23.979]  Of course they're going to let it all come in.
[00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:28.403]  Of course they want a bigger disaster to get more funds and more power.
[00:42:28.403 --> 00:42:35.308]  Nobody gets in trouble when FEMA blocks the aid in Katrina and cuts the police communication lines.
[00:42:35.308 --> 00:42:36.789]  They get more power.
[00:42:36.789 --> 00:42:42.393]  And of course they get more power when they let all the oil flood in and keep it gushing.
[00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.895]  And now they're going to shut down all of BP's competition.
[00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.156]  BP is so powerful.
[00:42:47.605 --> 00:42:56.551]  British Petroleum, they're the only company allowed to export 80% of the oil to Asia, out of Alaska.
[00:42:56.551 --> 00:43:00.894]  They've got a duopoly up there.
[00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:05.677]  They're the big carbon tax people, their whole Copenhagen thing fell apart.
[00:43:05.677 --> 00:43:09.820]  So of course they rigged this whole deal, and of course they're letting it, and they're never going to cap it.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:16.705]  They found a big old gusher, blew the lid off of it, and they're going to turn the whole Gulf of Mexico into an oil bath, and they're going to teach you how to be a slave!
[00:43:19.545 --> 00:43:29.294]  April 20th, Deepwater Horizon deepwater oil drill rig explodes and catches fire in the Gulf of Mexico at about 10 p.m.
[00:43:29.294 --> 00:43:32.016]  126 people were on board, 11 go missing.
[00:43:32.016 --> 00:43:33.438]  At least 15 injured.
[00:43:33.438 --> 00:43:44.628]  And then I'm watching The Knowing with Nicolas Cage about the end of the world and it shows an April 20th, 2010 oil rig blow up with an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:43:45.788 --> 00:43:47.389]  Just can't handle it anymore, folks.
[00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:51.331]  I can't handle it.
[00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:51.872]  You know what?
[00:43:51.872 --> 00:43:52.912]  This isn't entertainment.
[00:43:52.912 --> 00:43:57.695]  It isn't about me being a celebrity or who Alex Jones, everybody knows who he is.
[00:43:57.695 --> 00:43:59.956]  You think this is fun or a joke or a game?
[00:43:59.956 --> 00:44:02.198]  You think I like going up against these psychopathic devils?
[00:44:03.203 --> 00:44:07.308]  The only reason I'm going up against them is because I've studied history and I know I don't have a choice, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:07.308 --> 00:44:10.572]  The only way I'm getting out of this is going straight through these people.
[00:44:10.572 --> 00:44:11.653]  You understand that?
[00:44:11.653 --> 00:44:17.440]  The only way we're going to get out of this is to break the spell we're under and to stomp these devils into the ground!
[00:44:18.513 --> 00:44:21.375]  And that means everything they're for, I'm against.
[00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:23.537]  They're for vaccines, I'm against it.
[00:44:23.537 --> 00:44:25.559]  Then you go research it, you learn why.
[00:44:25.559 --> 00:44:27.781]  They're for open borders, I'm against it.
[00:44:27.781 --> 00:44:29.943]  They're for NAFTA and GATT, I'm against it.
[00:44:29.943 --> 00:44:31.884]  They're for all these wars, I'm against it.
[00:44:31.884 --> 00:44:34.166]  They're for face scanning cameras, I'm against it.
[00:44:34.166 --> 00:44:36.428]  They're for federalization of police, I'm against it.
[00:44:36.428 --> 00:44:38.330]  They're for torture, I'm against it.
[00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.512]  They're for torture of children, I'm against it.
[00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.615]  I'm against every stinking thing they stand for, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:45:04.830]  And the good news is there's an awakening, every incumbent's getting thrown out on their hind end, from Hawaii to Kentucky, from Utah to Pennsylvania, from Colorado to New York, from Massachusetts to Maine, but it ain't enough, okay?
[00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:09.753]  I need to be hit between the eyes like a laser beam with just how real this is every day.
[00:45:09.753 --> 00:45:12.935]  I need to wake up and get serious and get hardcore.
[00:45:13.806 --> 00:45:15.627]  We need to get hardcore!
[00:45:15.627 --> 00:45:17.848]  This is hardcore!
[00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:20.750]  You understand this, folks?
[00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:30.815]  I mean, it doesn't get any more hardcore than spiking your water with hundreds of deadly chemicals to literally make every one of your organs shut down so you die of every blood disease and cancer imaginable.
[00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:36.398]  Diabetes everywhere, kids retarded left and right all over the place, their brains rotted to hell.
[00:45:36.398 --> 00:45:37.219]  This isn't a joke!
[00:45:38.717 --> 00:45:40.718]  And I'm sorry if I get really intense.
[00:45:40.718 --> 00:45:45.200]  I just love my crew and everybody else here, but I almost just threw the microphone through the window just now.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:58.107]  I almost just overturned this desk, because at a primitive level, I am sick of these people, and I'm sick of looking at them, and I'm sick of hearing their lies, and I'm sick of watching people fall for it.
[00:45:58.107 --> 00:46:03.410]  I just want some red blood to start boiling out there, and some real guts to start rising.
[00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.770]  Where are the men?
[00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.732]  Where are the people that recognize real threats when they see it?
[00:46:08.092 --> 00:46:10.693]  Where are they?
[00:46:10.693 --> 00:46:16.296]  Where is the motivation against this, folks?
[00:46:16.296 --> 00:46:22.279]  You know, if I was lying about the stuff I cover on the air, I'd be the dirtiest, most evil person on earth.
[00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.400]  I was thinking about it this weekend.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.483]  It was the 2006 9-11 anniversary, and I was in New York City five years after.
[00:46:29.483 --> 00:46:34.566]  And I was on KTSA with, I think, Trey Ware was the host.
[00:46:35.758 --> 00:46:38.500]  He didn't attack me for being a 9-11 truther.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.601]  He didn't call me names.
[00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:41.522]  He let me put out evidence.
[00:46:41.522 --> 00:46:55.612]  And he really, in a heartfelt way, he said, Alex, you better hope you're right about what you say about 9-11 because this is all on you.
[00:46:55.612 --> 00:46:57.153]  You're going to have to answer for God.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.944]  For the information you're putting out and you, you better hope you're right as bad as this information is.
[00:47:03.944 --> 00:47:04.344]  And you know what?
[00:47:04.344 --> 00:47:06.926]  It felt good when he said that to me.
[00:47:06.926 --> 00:47:08.628]  It felt good.
[00:47:08.628 --> 00:47:09.108]  You know why?
[00:47:09.108 --> 00:47:12.090]  Because it made me reflect on everything I've done and you know what?
[00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.411]  It's good.
[00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:14.192]  It's the truth.
[00:47:14.192 --> 00:47:15.973]  It's the reality, okay?
[00:47:15.973 --> 00:47:17.974]  I've got the guts to tell the truth.
[00:47:17.974 --> 00:47:24.059]  Not because I'm a tough guy, folks, but because I've got a fighting instinct and a survival instinct.
[00:47:24.059 --> 00:47:27.001]  People, don't you ever praise me again, anybody.
[00:47:27.927 --> 00:47:31.689]  Praise me for what I've done?
[00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:35.652]  I'm embarrassed when I enjoy food, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:37.473]  I'm embarrassed when I enjoy anything.
[00:47:37.473 --> 00:47:42.936]  Because I realize just how evil this new world order is and I feel like I should be doing nothing but fighting the globalists.
[00:47:42.936 --> 00:47:45.358]  But more and more I realize you can't be unbalanced.
[00:47:45.358 --> 00:47:47.319]  I can't just fight all the time.
[00:47:47.319 --> 00:47:50.681]  So I'm gonna actually be taking more time off to get myself right with God.
[00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:51.982]  But I'll tell you something, folks.
[00:47:51.982 --> 00:47:55.504]  You better get your butts right with God right now.
[00:47:55.504 --> 00:47:57.445]  Because this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:01.609]  This could well be.
[00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:05.759]  This could well be revelations.
[00:48:05.759 --> 00:48:06.420]  Do you understand that?
[00:48:08.288 --> 00:48:14.133]  And let me tell you, all you thumb-sucking fake Christians that think you're gonna be teleported out of this, just watch, folks.
[00:48:14.133 --> 00:48:17.096]  Watch, and you're gonna wish later you'd have stood up and done something.
[00:48:17.096 --> 00:48:20.559]  And don't give me this, well, if the world government's foretold.
[00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.140]  My son has read the Bible over and over again.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.241]  He's seven years old.
[00:48:23.241 --> 00:48:25.343]  He reads the King James Version.
[00:48:25.343 --> 00:48:27.105]  He reads full-length novels, history books.
[00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:31.448]  He said to me last night, he said, but Daddy, you're not gonna beat the new world order.
[00:48:31.448 --> 00:48:34.791]  He just looked at me, so young and handsome and smart and full of life.
[00:48:35.751 --> 00:48:40.375]  Makes me hate the New World Order every time I look at him, just thinking about how good he is.
[00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:47.881]  And he said, you're not gonna beat the New World Order because the Bible, you know, the Bible says the world government's gonna come.
[00:48:47.881 --> 00:48:50.764]  I said, son, it doesn't matter if we beat it or not.
[00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:58.270]  We've got a responsibility to stand up against it and to warn people about it so they at least spiritually don't fall to it.
[00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.131]  Do you understand that?
[00:49:00.299 --> 00:49:01.319]  Let me just tell people something.
[00:49:01.319 --> 00:49:22.488]  Those of you out there that call yourselves Christians, if you don't have a burning, absolute, total, driving, uncontrollable desire to warn everyone you know about what's happening right now and to be active and to be out there facing down evil with courage.
[00:49:22.488 --> 00:49:23.589]  It isn't even courage.
[00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:24.769]  It transcends that.
[00:49:24.769 --> 00:49:26.610]  You shouldn't be able to control yourself.
[00:49:27.822 --> 00:49:32.786]  If you don't have that burning drive, ladies and gentlemen, you are of the world.
[00:49:32.786 --> 00:49:38.371]  And I'm not up here on some high horse, folks, you know, about what you did sexually or what drugs you did.
[00:49:38.371 --> 00:49:39.472]  I'm not here judging you.
[00:49:39.472 --> 00:49:41.855]  We're all dirty rags, folks.
[00:49:41.855 --> 00:49:42.135]  Okay?
[00:49:44.005 --> 00:49:45.406]  The point is your heart.
[00:49:45.406 --> 00:49:47.548]  Which side are you on spiritually?
[00:49:47.548 --> 00:49:50.010]  What decision have you made?
[00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:54.695]  And the New World Order is out there telling its armies of darkness, you know, make your choice.
[00:49:54.695 --> 00:50:04.463]  I was watching this internal British propaganda film for their security forces by Blackwell Briggs, secret parliamentary lobbying video.
[00:50:04.463 --> 00:50:06.986]  It's going up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:50:08.847 --> 00:50:19.396]  And the guy says, with just dark evil, he just says, you must choose your side now for our civilization in the fight against our enemies.
[00:50:19.396 --> 00:50:22.598]  And they're talking about us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:22.598 --> 00:50:30.925]  And they've got their black armor on, and they imagine the evil force to spike the water supply with poison.
[00:50:32.222 --> 00:50:36.123]  I mean, and just to consciously do it, the boldness of that.
[00:50:36.123 --> 00:50:40.105]  And that's only one of thousands of their crimes against you and your family.
[00:50:40.105 --> 00:50:45.927]  Alright, we're going to go back to Gary, Julio, Kathy, Tommy, Mike, Chris, others.
[00:50:45.927 --> 00:50:48.448]  Your call's continuing straight ahead.
[00:50:48.448 --> 00:50:54.150]  But I tell you, you just need to gut up and realize just how real this is every single stinking day.
[00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:57.971]  And it shouldn't depress you, it should get you fired up, because reality's reality.
[00:51:01.653 --> 00:51:02.893]  Global meltdowns.
[00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.314]  Massive unemployment.
[00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:05.514]  Endless wars.
[00:51:05.514 --> 00:51:07.155]  A new currency crisis.
[00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:09.256]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:51:09.256 --> 00:51:11.396]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:11.396 --> 00:51:13.297]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:51:13.297 --> 00:51:15.378]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:51:15.378 --> 00:51:17.358]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:23.861]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:51:23.861 --> 00:51:29.142]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[00:51:29.142 --> 00:51:31.063]  Off The Grid News is fiercely independent
[00:51:31.343 --> 00:51:41.408]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold, and guns.
[00:51:41.408 --> 00:51:43.549]  With absolutely no apologies.
[00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:44.370]  And the best part?
[00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:48.432]  This $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:51:48.432 --> 00:51:52.674]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.

[00:52:00.936 --> 00:52:03.317]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.317 --> 00:52:05.638]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.638 --> 00:52:08.839]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:13.941]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.941 --> 00:52:18.142]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.462 --> 00:52:20.803]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.803 --> 00:52:23.344]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.344 --> 00:52:26.606]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.606 --> 00:52:34.209]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:39.833]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.833 --> 00:52:42.255]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.255 --> 00:52:46.478]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.478 --> 00:52:47.559]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.559 --> 00:52:48.900]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.381]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:00.325 --> 00:53:02.086]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:53:02.086 --> 00:53:03.427]  How would that make you feel?
[00:53:03.427 --> 00:53:05.148]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.690]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:15.254]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:53:15.254 --> 00:53:16.755]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:53:16.755 --> 00:53:19.497]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[00:53:19.497 --> 00:53:24.820]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:29.883]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:53:30.043 --> 00:53:35.144]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:35.144 --> 00:53:39.566]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:53:39.566 --> 00:53:44.087]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:47.628]  And folks, I did not expect this at all.
[00:53:47.628 --> 00:53:52.349]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:56.890]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:54:08.524 --> 00:54:10.404]  Yeah, you've always got to double-check everything.
[00:54:10.404 --> 00:54:15.185]  The website I was looking at said that both dates were April 20th.
[00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:15.925]  There is an April 20th.
[00:54:15.925 --> 00:54:18.566]  There's a whole bunch of dates in the movie.
[00:54:18.566 --> 00:54:21.527]  But that's not the date with the oil rig thing, so I feel a lot better.
[00:54:21.527 --> 00:54:26.788]  I'm just so sick of them throwing in our face with the hundreds of other cases where they specifically do that.
[00:54:26.788 --> 00:54:28.508]  But we'll continue to analyze that.
[00:54:28.508 --> 00:54:31.169]  I'm glad Watson is on, on the case.
[00:54:32.426 --> 00:54:34.087]  Alright, I said I'm going to take calls.
[00:54:34.087 --> 00:54:35.728]  I've done an okay job of that.
[00:54:35.728 --> 00:54:40.711]  But I've still failed to just spend about a minute and a half with each caller.
[00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.633]  So we're going to do that now until the bottom of the hour.
[00:54:43.633 --> 00:54:48.155]  Then I'm going to get into the situation with North Korea that is very, very serious.
[00:54:48.155 --> 00:54:50.336]  What's happening with the global economy.
[00:54:50.336 --> 00:54:52.658]  It's just a quickening that's happening right now.
[00:54:55.236 --> 00:54:57.479]  Let's go ahead and go back to Gary in New Orleans.
[00:54:57.479 --> 00:55:03.426]  Gary, you've just got to point out that the feds are blocking locals from being able to protect their own areas.
[00:55:03.426 --> 00:55:09.814]  I've seen the studies that the chemicals BP is using are even more toxic than the oil itself.
[00:55:11.004 --> 00:55:12.245]  But I don't know what else to say.
[00:55:12.245 --> 00:55:17.149]  I mean, the federal government cannot and will not help you.
[00:55:17.149 --> 00:55:18.431]  It's like the mafia.
[00:55:18.431 --> 00:55:20.012]  It's like taking a loan from the mafia.
[00:55:20.012 --> 00:55:24.316]  You get a $1,000 loan from a loan shark, but you're never going to be able to pay it back.
[00:55:24.316 --> 00:55:27.418]  You pay it back $100,000, it won't be paid back.
[00:55:27.418 --> 00:55:29.560]  So, I mean, what do you say?
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.763]  Well, you were asking where the men are that are ready to stand up.
[00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:36.006]  Well, the local people and the fishermen are beginning to mobilize
[00:55:36.601 --> 00:55:38.123]  Well, that's exciting news.
[00:55:38.123 --> 00:55:39.164]  I haven't seen that.
[00:55:39.164 --> 00:55:41.807]  I mean, does that come out in the paper?
[00:55:41.807 --> 00:55:45.030]  That the parish is just going to do the job themselves?
[00:55:56.104 --> 00:56:00.605]  Well, they're beginning to do that, but they've been waiting a month, and we just keep getting more and more.
[00:56:00.605 --> 00:56:02.606]  It's Katrina and ultra slow motion.
[00:56:02.606 --> 00:56:05.327]  Are you hearing stuff about Katrina and ultra slow motion?
[00:56:05.327 --> 00:56:14.589]  Have you heard about the reporters like CBS and others being told they're not allowed to videotape public beaches?
[00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:16.310]  Alex, I'm all over this one, okay?
[00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.450]  This was our study 9-11 JFK.
[00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.931]  This is happening and unfolding.
[00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:22.051]  The dust hasn't settled yet here.
[00:56:22.051 --> 00:56:23.952]  Now, my big question is, should we
[00:56:24.508 --> 00:56:25.471]  We're good to go.
[00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:37.213]  And then there has to be a study by the Army Corps of Engineers before they're going to do anything.
[00:56:37.213 --> 00:56:38.734]  Yeah, that's the federal control.
[00:56:38.734 --> 00:56:43.436]  Look, the sheriff can just get together and say, all the men that want to help me, let's go.
[00:56:43.436 --> 00:56:46.278]  And they can go out there and do a lot more than the government could ever do.
[00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.719]  I appreciate your call.
[00:56:47.719 --> 00:56:48.879]  I mean, that's what's going to be needed.
[00:56:48.879 --> 00:56:54.883]  You give a bunch of money to the politicians, it'll take six months for them to do anything with it, and they'll sit around.
[00:56:54.883 --> 00:56:57.484]  We're paralyzed by government in this country now.
[00:56:57.484 --> 00:56:59.145]  Julio and Illinois are on the air.
[00:57:00.492 --> 00:57:04.534]  Hey Alex, I'm pressed for time, so I'm going to quickly go to my point.
[00:57:04.534 --> 00:57:14.659]  First off, the Mockingbird media, instead of talking about Europe on the verge of crisis, they're talking about Lindsay Lohan in court today.
[00:57:14.659 --> 00:57:20.502]  All three of the Mockingbird cable networks immediately went to live coverage on that, which is kind of disgusting.
[00:57:20.982 --> 00:57:39.156]  Secondly, whoever is a member of the Wayne Matz Report needs to print as many copies as possible, send it out to friends, send it out to Sotoro lovers and believers, because his special report and what he's been investigating here in Chicago is pretty amazing stuff.
[00:57:39.156 --> 00:57:42.018]  I heard him on the show the other day, and I'm reading what
[00:57:43.277 --> 00:57:56.970]  He's been talking about here, and for those in the know in Chicago, on the north side of town, who know about Boys Town, will be kind of shocked when they hear about Mr. Emanuel and Barry Fitoro and what they have been doing.
[00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:02.336]  I heard your interview with the member of the Love Police on Thursday, and I watched their videos on YouTube.
[00:58:02.336 --> 00:58:06.740]  Everyone needs to do that because it's very uplifting.
[00:58:07.646 --> 00:58:09.210]  And this is what we need to do.
[00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:17.568]  Whoever sees... We are changed in confronting our political leaders, but when we do that, I want to do this anytime I see someone.
[00:58:18.058 --> 00:58:29.507]  But let's reveal the fact that they are Zionist worshippers who believe in satanic cults and who do these, you know, homoerotic activities.
[00:58:29.507 --> 00:58:31.248]  All right, Julio, we're out of time.
[00:58:31.248 --> 00:58:38.453]  You know, I just think it plays into the divide and conquer to sit here and talk about one group running the New World Order.
[00:58:38.453 --> 00:58:43.037]  It's more of the same.
[00:58:43.037 --> 00:58:44.178]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.529 --> 00:58:47.836]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today!
[00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:55.374]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:58:55.374 --> 00:58:56.354]  What have we got?
[00:58:56.354 --> 00:58:58.816]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:58:58.816 --> 00:58:59.817]  A republic.
[00:58:59.817 --> 00:59:02.459]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:59:02.459 --> 00:59:04.721]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:06.742]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:59:06.742 --> 00:59:08.423]  So they think they own our land?
[00:59:08.423 --> 00:59:09.744]  They think they own our water?
[00:59:09.744 --> 00:59:10.365]  Children?
[00:59:10.365 --> 00:59:11.486]  Our education?
[00:59:11.486 --> 00:59:12.306]  Our money?
[00:59:12.306 --> 00:59:15.969]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:21.296]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:59:21.296 --> 00:59:22.317]  We have the facts.
[00:59:22.317 --> 00:59:23.479]  We have the Constitution.
[00:59:23.479 --> 00:59:24.380]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.281]  We have common law.
[00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:27.805]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:27.805 --> 00:59:31.570]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:36.634]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:59:36.634 --> 00:59:38.135]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:59:38.135 --> 00:59:39.216]  Don't tread on me.
[00:59:39.216 --> 00:59:53.588]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:59:53.588 --> 00:59:55.969]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.969 --> 00:59:58.732]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.342 --> 01:00:06.643]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.643 --> 01:00:08.425]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.425 --> 01:00:10.186]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.186 --> 01:00:11.767]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.767 --> 01:00:13.309]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:17.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:23.597]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.597 --> 01:00:25.299]  Well, North Korea is just...
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.241]  An incredibly dangerous situation.
[01:00:28.241 --> 01:00:33.183]  I'm going to be covering that coming up in a huge news blitz at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:41.147]  Also, the amazing political realignment, not just happening here in the United States, but worldwide against the New World Order.
[01:00:41.147 --> 01:00:45.249]  A lot of other key news on the economy coming up.
[01:00:46.837 --> 01:00:50.540]  And I want to continue with Kathy, Mike, Chris, and others.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:56.104]  The toll-free number to join us, wide open phones today, is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:56.104 --> 01:01:00.007]  Now, I got cut off by the break if you just joined us.
[01:01:00.007 --> 01:01:01.128]  Some stations just joined us.
[01:01:01.128 --> 01:01:10.095]  And Julio was bringing up the fact that he wants to go out and confront politicians and globalists and bring up the fact that they're Zionist.
[01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:21.042]  Now I had the love police on, because specifically when that political activist group saw some people who were part of the Zionist lobby, they yelled that at them.
[01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:21.643]  Okay?
[01:01:21.643 --> 01:01:22.064]  In England.
[01:01:23.567 --> 01:01:24.427]  I'm all for that.
[01:01:24.427 --> 01:01:32.769]  I mean, when Israel does something wrong, or Israel's involved in corruption, every major government is, call out the Zionist Mafia, if you would.
[01:01:32.769 --> 01:01:41.111]  But there's the Communist Chinese Mafia, there's the Dutch Mafia, there's the British Mafia, and they're all intermarried and connected.
[01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:44.912]  So people get confused by my stance on this.
[01:01:44.912 --> 01:01:47.552]  I am for confronting evil mafias.
[01:01:47.552 --> 01:01:49.653]  Larry Silverstein's part of a mafia.
[01:01:49.653 --> 01:01:50.153]  Clearly.
[01:01:50.153 --> 01:01:50.933]  So's Mayor Daley.
[01:01:51.735 --> 01:02:00.839]  But that doesn't mean I'm against Irish people, because I'm against the Irish Mafia in Chicago.
[01:02:00.839 --> 01:02:04.601]  You know, that's like if I'm against the Italian Mafia, I'm not against Italians.
[01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:11.344]  And as long as we approach fighting these Mafias from that perspective, we can get everybody together to defeat the New World Order.
[01:02:11.344 --> 01:02:13.665]  You know, it's like the open borders in Latin Americans.
[01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:16.047]  Latin Americans are great, hard-working, smart people.
[01:02:16.047 --> 01:02:18.388]  They've lived under tyranny for hundreds of years.
[01:02:18.388 --> 01:02:18.908]  The U.S.
[01:02:18.908 --> 01:02:19.788]  was special.
[01:02:19.788 --> 01:02:20.909]  We had a little bit of liberty.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:28.203]  Certainly not perfect, but more than most, we had more private property, so we had all the wealth.
[01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.664]  Now we're losing that.
[01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:34.426]  And so I want to reach out to Latin Americans and say, why don't you be free market?
[01:02:34.426 --> 01:02:36.607]  Why do you go with the big communist route?
[01:02:36.607 --> 01:02:42.711]  You know, supposedly either have an El Jefe, right-wing military junta that runs you, or communism.
[01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:45.202]  How about be libertarian?
[01:02:45.202 --> 01:02:47.184]  How about be true private property?
[01:02:47.184 --> 01:02:57.711]  Well, they always like the communist model because the El Hefes control 99% of the property, and so to the average person, it sounds good to redisperse that wealth.
[01:02:57.711 --> 01:03:02.915]  And then, you know, there's the dangerous route of, well, how do you take the 99% of the wealth from the thieves?
[01:03:02.915 --> 01:03:04.676]  Then what, have a lottery?
[01:03:04.676 --> 01:03:06.898]  Where you divide up the land?
[01:03:06.898 --> 01:03:09.300]  Or do you nationalize the land and then divide it up equally?
[01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:16.507]  See, that's why communism looks good from a, say, Latin American perspective, but you never really get communism, do you?
[01:03:16.507 --> 01:03:20.128]  No, you never really get that land.
[01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:23.569]  You just become another form of slave.
[01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:26.250]  So, what do you do with the people that have never had freedom?
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.161]  Most of the world hadn't had freedom.
[01:03:30.161 --> 01:03:34.684]  But I'm not here bashing people from Latin America because they're Latin American.
[01:03:34.684 --> 01:03:43.629]  I'm bashing the system, and through the North American Union, they're trying to merge us with that political system, and I'm not going to give up my Second Amendment or private property.
[01:03:43.629 --> 01:03:45.930]  No, no, no.
[01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:55.015]  I mean, they just arrested the nuclear physicist who'd been in jail for 18 years for admitting that Israel has nukes.
[01:03:55.015 --> 01:03:56.576]  Well, they publicly have nukes.
[01:03:56.576 --> 01:03:57.637]  They've arrested him again.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:07.063]  And I saw people in the Jerusalem Post going, oh, he deserves to be arrested, you know, for giving out national secrets.
[01:04:07.063 --> 01:04:08.163]  National secrets?
[01:04:08.163 --> 01:04:25.389]  Israel is saying, nuke Iran, because in the next five years they might get a primitive A-bomb, when Israel has high-tech intercontinental ballistic missiles and the warheads, the hydrogen bombs, to be delivered in those warheads, and then Israel wants to play this game and say they don't have nukes when they publicly have them?
[01:04:26.178 --> 01:04:29.801]  And we're giving them to Pakistan and South Africa?
[01:04:29.801 --> 01:04:33.564]  What is Israel doing helping give nukes to Pakistan?
[01:04:33.564 --> 01:04:36.166]  It's a bunch of lawless thugs that run Israel, that's why!
[01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:41.050]  Well then why do they hate Iran so much?
[01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:44.113]  Because Iran used to belong to who?
[01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:47.616]  British Petroleum!
[01:04:47.616 --> 01:04:48.076]  Until 53.
[01:04:48.076 --> 01:04:53.701]  Alright, we're going to come back and go to your phone calls.
[01:04:54.983 --> 01:04:56.976]  The more you know though, the more you know you don't know.
[01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:57.559]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.407 --> 01:05:04.611]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:04.611 --> 01:05:11.016]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:11.016 --> 01:05:18.403]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.403 --> 01:05:23.287]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:25.409]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:31.975]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:31.975 --> 01:05:34.258]  I'm happy to say, our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:34.258 --> 01:05:34.818]  Call us at 1-800-5-6-7.
[01:05:48.994 --> 01:05:50.517]  We're good to go.
[01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:09.965]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:20.872]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:06:20.872 --> 01:06:26.296]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:06:26.856 --> 01:06:31.739]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:06:31.739 --> 01:06:40.805]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:06:40.805 --> 01:06:50.932]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:06:50.932 --> 01:06:54.615]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:54.615 --> 01:06:55.635]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:07:00.157 --> 01:07:01.457]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.457 --> 01:07:07.058]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:07.058 --> 01:07:12.059]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:17.641]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:07:17.641 --> 01:07:19.461]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:07:19.741 --> 01:07:20.241]  We're good to go!
[01:07:48.102 --> 01:07:52.003]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:52.003 --> 01:07:56.824]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:56.824 --> 01:08:02.225]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[01:08:02.225 --> 01:08:04.345]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.345 --> 01:08:07.726]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.355 --> 01:08:24.362]  Wickedness in high places throughout history, government.
[01:08:24.362 --> 01:08:27.145]  A hundred to one is run by wicked crooks.
[01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:31.652]  It doesn't matter what color, religion, creed.
[01:08:31.652 --> 01:08:32.312]  Our republic
[01:08:33.424 --> 01:08:37.808]  It isn't perfect, but it's the best it's ever been, and look at the wealth and power it's created.
[01:08:37.808 --> 01:08:39.710]  Now we've fallen to tyranny.
[01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.132]  We're now an engine of world government and domination.
[01:08:42.132 --> 01:08:58.247]  If we don't break the spell, shake ourselves loose of the idiot box, and relearn the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and take action against the high-tech tyranny, we're going to fall to a level of despotism and dehumanization never before seen.
[01:08:59.548 --> 01:09:02.489]  Now, I'm going to your calls in rapid pace.
[01:09:02.489 --> 01:09:04.910]  Kathy in Montana.
[01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:06.371]  Welcome!
[01:09:06.371 --> 01:09:08.051]  Hello, Alex.
[01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:09.692]  I'm glad to hear your voice here.
[01:09:09.692 --> 01:09:14.514]  I just wanted to ask you about, and this falls right in with the guy that just called.
[01:09:14.514 --> 01:09:16.734]  He was in Louisiana about the oil spill.
[01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:17.235]  Yes.
[01:09:17.235 --> 01:09:20.956]  About the Costner Ocean Therapy Machines.
[01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.917]  It's really hard to find any information.
[01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:24.637]  I have to keep going online.
[01:09:24.637 --> 01:09:26.298]  I just found one from Friday.
[01:09:27.316 --> 01:09:44.049]  Um, where they're saying that the Hotton, his business partner, was saying that they had as many as 26 machines dispatched throughout the Gulf, and our largest is 112 inches highways, 200, or two and a half tons, and cleans 210,000 gallons a day of oily water and spits back out
[01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:51.892]  99% clean.
[01:09:51.892 --> 01:10:01.519]  But they're having now, everybody has drugged their feet so much on this stuff that everybody is trying to position for where they're going to be put.
[01:10:01.519 --> 01:10:06.883]  And they're not even using, evidently, all the machines that they have available to them.
[01:10:06.883 --> 01:10:08.104]  Well, absolutely, look.
[01:10:09.281 --> 01:10:13.182]  That oil spill is like a thousand miles long now and growing.
[01:10:13.182 --> 01:10:15.423]  It's already caught up in different currents.
[01:10:15.423 --> 01:10:17.764]  They're not going to be able to clean it up.
[01:10:17.764 --> 01:10:30.748]  All they can do is when it comes into shore, they should have been setting this up day one with booms, block it from going into the estuaries, from going into the brackish water where the fish and birds breed.
[01:10:31.548 --> 01:10:35.189]  It's easy to clean it off the beach, but the feds didn't do that.
[01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:37.830]  And they knew full well what they were doing.
[01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:44.052]  They want a disaster so they can clamp down on other drilling and make us more dependent on foreign oil.
[01:10:44.052 --> 01:10:46.172]  That's what BP has always promoted.
[01:10:46.172 --> 01:10:48.093]  They have the motive to have staged this.
[01:10:49.053 --> 01:10:49.973]  Yes, I have two points.
[01:10:49.973 --> 01:10:54.074]  One is I heard today on the Power Hour that there's lockboxes on the rig and that they conveniently
[01:11:18.547 --> 01:11:23.128]  Don't have any information at the time of the explosion.
[01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:33.752]  And also, I heard last week on Declarer Independence with Arash Hancock, that there was inspectors on the rig, like, two hours before the explosion.
[01:11:34.471 --> 01:12:03.771]  Yes, no, that was in the Associated Press that they had Wi-Fi, digital, audio, video, data connections to this $150-plus million dollar rig, and that that went dead the hours before, and that there were inspectors already dispatched out there for some type of emergency problem, and now it's time for Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, or Steve Watson, or Aaron Dykes, one of my great crew,
[01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:12.715]  To do a report on this, because now we have enough bizarre discrepancies, now we can see the motive.
[01:12:12.715 --> 01:12:14.216]  What do you think of what's happening, Mike?
[01:12:14.216 --> 01:12:17.938]  I mean, does it stink to high heaven to you?
[01:12:17.938 --> 01:12:24.401]  With your piece about the movie Knowing, I definitely think it's foul play.
[01:12:25.683 --> 01:12:27.264]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:35.291]  But to be specific, the website we were reading said that the show said April 20th, and in reality, the rig blew up on April 20th.
[01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:37.813]  It's another date in the film.
[01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:44.339]  But again, you have other movies that they've put out where the exact thing happens that's in the film.
[01:12:44.339 --> 01:12:46.781]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:12:46.781 --> 01:12:51.205]  But let's continue here with Chris in Kentucky.
[01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:52.486]  Another call from Kentucky.
[01:12:52.486 --> 01:12:53.147]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:12:53.942 --> 01:13:01.430]  Hey Alex, I tell ya, you know, I'm just so outraged with these ads about Rand Paul local this morning on a radio talk show.
[01:13:02.233 --> 01:13:16.422]  They're already demonizing him, and it's not going to work with me, because the radio talk show host Mandy Connell said he didn't want to show up or be on her program or make appearances, and I just slammed on the brakes, pounded on my dash, and the first thing I did, here they go again.
[01:13:16.422 --> 01:13:19.324]  They're so determined to get a neocon back in there.
[01:13:19.324 --> 01:13:21.065]  Well, it's not going to work.
[01:13:21.065 --> 01:13:22.666]  Well, let's be specific.
[01:13:22.666 --> 01:13:25.929]  Is this a neocon or a fake liberal?
[01:13:25.929 --> 01:13:30.432]  What form of parasite operative is it that was attacking Paul?
[01:13:31.132 --> 01:13:41.377]  Well, I just had turned on the radio at the time, and she was saying that, she was talking about Rand Paul not making appearances, and he didn't want to come on my show.
[01:13:41.377 --> 01:13:45.259]  I know, but is she, what is her political stripe?
[01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:51.182]  She's a new radio talk show host, and I think she's actually, she thinks she's so patriotic, but I think she's a neocon under the rug.
[01:13:51.182 --> 01:13:52.043]  She's putting on a show.
[01:13:52.043 --> 01:13:55.184]  Well, yeah, I mean, the Republicans are claiming they want to help Rand Paul.
[01:13:55.184 --> 01:13:56.565]  They'd rather have a Democrat in there.
[01:13:59.045 --> 01:14:04.050]  I'm going to cover that coming up, but it's a total hoax.
[01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:10.256]  It's just like the headline, UK bans doctor who linked autism to vaccine.
[01:14:10.256 --> 01:14:15.341]  And I've read what the doctor did here on Austin and Studies, Andrew Wakefield.
[01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:16.762]  He did nothing wrong.
[01:14:16.762 --> 01:14:19.965]  His studies are mirrored by all the other studies.
[01:14:19.965 --> 01:14:22.628]  We know mercury is linked to neurological disorders.
[01:14:22.628 --> 01:14:23.669]  We know they're way up.
[01:14:24.389 --> 01:14:29.471]  We know it's conclusively linked to 18 months old, the third round of shots.
[01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:31.992]  His evidence is completely backed up.
[01:14:31.992 --> 01:14:36.774]  Meanwhile, we have all these other fake studies put out by Big Pharma, where they've been caught lying.
[01:14:36.774 --> 01:14:38.174]  That's not a big issue.
[01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:41.536]  But the media runs this hoax that, oh, it's all been disproven.
[01:14:41.536 --> 01:14:43.516]  Vaccines aren't bad for you.
[01:14:43.516 --> 01:14:45.477]  It's all a lie.
[01:14:45.477 --> 01:14:47.398]  And it's a hoax.
[01:14:47.398 --> 01:14:49.559]  And we've got Wakefield on tomorrow, by the way.
[01:14:49.559 --> 01:14:51.339]  And it's the same thing with Rand Paul.
[01:14:51.339 --> 01:14:52.460]  They just announced, yeah?
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.081]  Yeah, he's for the Klan.
[01:14:55.081 --> 01:14:59.345]  Yeah, he's against the Civil Rights Act.
[01:14:59.345 --> 01:15:01.266]  Never said that.
[01:15:01.266 --> 01:15:03.208]  Never made it a campaign issue.
[01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:05.129]  Never called for its repeal.
[01:15:05.129 --> 01:15:06.591]  Never discussed it.
[01:15:06.591 --> 01:15:09.293]  They know that a popular libertarian point
[01:15:10.461 --> 01:15:30.117]  Is that the Civil Rights Act has gone too far, ordering private clubs in lawsuits where white people have demanded to be part of black fraternities, or women have demanded to be part of the Bohemian Grove, male only, or reporters, mainly female, have demanded to get into the Masters Golf locker room, or to get into the NFL locker rooms.
[01:15:30.117 --> 01:15:32.438]  You've all seen the suits on the news.
[01:15:32.438 --> 01:15:33.760]  And he's saying, look,
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:38.709]  People are allowed to associate with who they want.
[01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:41.033]  I mean, do you think they're going to have me in a Mecha meeting?
[01:15:42.634 --> 01:15:43.635]  Okay?
[01:15:43.635 --> 01:15:51.500]  I mean, one time I tried to go to an anti-gun meeting at a synagogue to speak out against it, and they saw me there and threw me out.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.321]  Put their hands on me, folks!
[01:15:53.321 --> 01:16:00.906]  Now, should I be able to sue and say, I'm allowed to go to your meeting, your gun-grabbing meeting, or your mecha meeting?
[01:16:00.906 --> 01:16:01.786]  No!
[01:16:01.786 --> 01:16:02.186]  I shouldn't.
[01:16:02.186 --> 01:16:03.107]  I mean, you know what?
[01:16:03.107 --> 01:16:03.948]  That's their business.
[01:16:04.948 --> 01:16:10.173]  And if the leaders of the church, or the synagogue, or Mecha, or whatever it is, don't want me in there?
[01:16:10.173 --> 01:16:15.918]  Listen, if some business didn't want black people in there, they're going to lose all that money.
[01:16:15.918 --> 01:16:18.020]  There's no way anyone would ever bring that back.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:21.643]  It's just a ridiculous situation.
[01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:27.108]  But because he's honest, he said, I think the civil rights stuff is used too far with private clubs.
[01:16:28.652 --> 01:16:30.593]  Look, Rand Paul will audit the Fed.
[01:16:30.593 --> 01:16:32.414]  Rand Paul will end these wars.
[01:16:32.414 --> 01:16:36.797]  Rand Paul will reverse anti-Second Amendment stuff.
[01:16:36.797 --> 01:16:39.258]  Rand Paul would not go for Kagan.
[01:16:39.258 --> 01:16:40.739]  One senator could block her.
[01:16:40.739 --> 01:16:42.940]  She says no free speech, no Second Amendment.
[01:16:44.193 --> 01:16:46.215]  I have her quotes!
[01:16:46.215 --> 01:16:48.376]  I mean, it's outrageous!
[01:16:48.376 --> 01:16:49.357]  But no!
[01:16:49.357 --> 01:16:50.638]  No!
[01:16:50.638 --> 01:16:52.440]  But I like the point he made on ABC News.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.142]  He said, well, what about Senator Byrd, a member of the Ku Klux Klan?
[01:16:56.142 --> 01:16:56.883]  He didn't even say that.
[01:16:56.883 --> 01:17:02.147]  He pointed out that he filibustered the Civil Rights Act.
[01:17:02.147 --> 01:17:04.409]  What is... Oh, but he's a liberal.
[01:17:04.409 --> 01:17:05.009]  Oh, he's so...
[01:17:06.172 --> 01:17:08.594]  It's, it's, what did they do with the health care plan?
[01:17:08.594 --> 01:17:09.955]  And they barely got it.
[01:17:09.955 --> 01:17:19.200]  If you're against the government running your health care and getting involved in every facet of your life and garnishing your wages even more, you hate black people.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.822]  What does that have to do with black people?
[01:17:21.822 --> 01:17:22.743]  Zero.
[01:17:22.743 --> 01:17:23.323]  Zip.
[01:17:23.323 --> 01:17:24.124]  Nada.
[01:17:24.124 --> 01:17:24.924]  Nothing.
[01:17:24.924 --> 01:17:28.326]  So they injected into it.
[01:17:28.326 --> 01:17:30.328]  You get anti-NAFTA GATT groups out there.
[01:17:30.908 --> 01:17:37.952]  They have Hal Turner, the FBI agent, running around and mixing white supremacy with it to make it look bad.
[01:17:37.952 --> 01:17:40.133]  And it's the same thing.
[01:17:40.133 --> 01:17:42.254]  But go ahead and finish up your point, Chris.
[01:17:42.254 --> 01:17:48.638]  I mean, I think Rand Paul is doing the right thing because every new interview he does, they're spinning it.
[01:17:49.662 --> 01:17:56.226]  And lying about what he said, like they say, oh, well, what do you stand for on the Disabilities Act?
[01:17:56.226 --> 01:18:02.430]  And he said, well, I think it shut down a lot of small businesses, a lot of businesses owned by people that are handicapped.
[01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:09.195]  They'd like to be able to hire people, but they gotta put in a $100,000 elevator to their two-story house.
[01:18:09.195 --> 01:18:13.537]  And, you know, people should be, you know, allowed to make other accommodations.
[01:18:13.537 --> 01:18:16.860]  I think there shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all, but I'm not for repealing it.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.501]  Headlines.
[01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:20.442]  He wants to repeal the Disabilities Act.
[01:18:20.442 --> 01:18:21.263]  Hey!
[01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:25.085]  They don't have Disability Act in China.
[01:18:25.085 --> 01:18:26.826]  Have you noticed we're falling apart?
[01:18:26.826 --> 01:18:28.688]  Have you noticed we're de-industrialized?
[01:18:28.688 --> 01:18:31.229]  Mexico can't even compete with China and India.
[01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:32.390]  It's over, folks.
[01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:33.351]  None of you are going to have jobs.
[01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:34.892]  You're not even going to fix the highways.
[01:18:34.892 --> 01:18:36.913]  We're going to be a giant third world country.
[01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:40.415]  Once the bankers are done, and then none of you are going to get any of your disability.
[01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:43.618]  You're not going to get your Medicare, your Medicaid, you're not going to get your Social Security.
[01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:44.678]  They're now announcing that.
[01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:45.479]  Don't worry!
[01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:51.114]  And of course, when they take your Social Security, they've already cut your Medicare and Medicaid by 20-plus percent.
[01:18:51.114 --> 01:18:53.635]  There's not going to be a big deal made out of that.
[01:18:53.635 --> 01:18:58.478]  But lots of hand-wringing and hyperventilating over Rand Paul.
[01:18:58.478 --> 01:19:00.539]  He's going to get you!
[01:19:00.539 --> 01:19:02.300]  Anything else, Chris?
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.340]  Yes, very well said.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.302]  And I also want to say, don't support BP.
[01:19:06.302 --> 01:19:07.883]  Let's don't support BP.
[01:19:07.883 --> 01:19:10.204]  And I also want to make real quick, I was thinking about something.
[01:19:10.564 --> 01:19:19.531]  Could you make it a day where you can have people that work for county, government, state, or local have a day to call in to see if they know what's going on with the new world order and know what's wrong with government?
[01:19:19.531 --> 01:19:21.373]  Could you have a day with that?
[01:19:21.373 --> 01:19:22.314]  That's a great idea.
[01:19:22.314 --> 01:19:24.916]  Guys, remind me someday this week to do a couple hours on that.
[01:19:24.916 --> 01:19:25.837]  Great points, Chris.
[01:19:25.837 --> 01:19:27.858]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:27.858 --> 01:19:30.721]  Keith, Joe, Angel Eyes.
[01:19:30.721 --> 01:19:31.621]  Angel Eyes?
[01:19:31.621 --> 01:19:33.583]  Aha!
[01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:35.464]  Look at the little Angel Eyes!
[01:19:35.464 --> 01:19:37.066]  Bet they don't call you Angel Eyes!
[01:19:38.658 --> 01:19:42.741]  I was watching the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly this morning.
[01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:49.365]  Only time I watch movies, really, is when I'm jogging down the treadmill in the garage, pouring sweat.
[01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:55.369]  And I was watching the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly with Lee Van Cleef.
[01:19:55.369 --> 01:19:59.372]  Alright, folks, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Angel Eyes.

[01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:07.584]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:22:07.584 --> 01:22:09.846]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:15.011]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:15.011 --> 01:22:16.833]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:18.134]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:18.354 --> 01:22:19.854]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:19.854 --> 01:22:23.215]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:23.215 --> 01:22:28.597]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.597 --> 01:22:37.679]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:38.339]  We're good to go.

[01:24:03.944 --> 01:24:06.786]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:24:06.786 --> 01:24:10.588]  Keith in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:24:15.692 --> 01:24:19.693]  Alex, I know I called yesterday, but I had to chime back in about the movie Knowing.
[01:24:19.693 --> 01:24:22.094]  The song in there, I had talked to you about it before.
[01:24:22.094 --> 01:24:24.695]  It's called Beethoven Symphony No.
[01:24:24.695 --> 01:24:24.775]  7.
[01:24:24.775 --> 01:24:29.577]  If people pay attention, that's the song that they play during the cremation of care ceremony at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:24:29.577 --> 01:24:34.558]  If you Google search it, you'll learn that there are occult origins to that.
[01:24:34.558 --> 01:24:37.399]  That it actually goes to worship of the god Dionysus.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:46.286]  Who has this whole idea of destruction and rebirth, great destruction that the elites subscribe to.
[01:24:46.286 --> 01:24:55.533]  Yeah, they believe that that's part of nature, so when they destroy you and kill you, it's beautiful and loving, but then meanwhile, they never want to be destroyed or killed.
[01:24:55.533 --> 01:24:58.395]  No, it's only when they're destroying us that that happens.
[01:24:58.395 --> 01:25:00.436]  Anything else?
[01:25:00.436 --> 01:25:01.857]  No, I just wanted people to research that.
[01:25:01.857 --> 01:25:05.000]  That's what people should be paying attention to about this movie, is that song.
[01:25:05.945 --> 01:25:07.066]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:25:07.066 --> 01:25:08.847]  We'll look into it.
[01:25:08.847 --> 01:25:10.588]  Joe in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:25:10.588 --> 01:25:12.489]  Go ahead.
[01:25:12.489 --> 01:25:14.330]  Hey, hey Alex.
[01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:15.451]  Welcome.
[01:25:15.451 --> 01:25:19.994]  Hey, forefather of the 21st century, I've got a lot of good points I'm going to make to you.
[01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:28.459]  Illegal immigration, in my eyes, is a federal offense due to their jumping state line after state line after state line.
[01:25:28.459 --> 01:25:34.103]  Since they want to interpret the law, they want to, we've got to somehow interpret that right back to a different way.
[01:25:34.904 --> 01:25:35.924]  Yeah, I'm listening to you.
[01:25:58.357 --> 01:26:05.061]  And if we can get, and we're talking all 50 states, give them one term, so that way we can stop the corruption up.
[01:26:05.061 --> 01:26:11.324]  Because there's going to be good ones that want to go in there, but they're under so much corruption from the ones that stay there forever, we never get rid of them.
[01:26:11.324 --> 01:26:15.346]  So we got to go to, like the President type deal, where they have two terms, that's it.
[01:26:15.346 --> 01:26:17.988]  One term senators, so we can get fresh ideas in.
[01:26:18.448 --> 01:26:20.330]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:25.294]  It's just under that system we wouldn't have Ron Paul, but I do see your point.
[01:26:25.294 --> 01:26:29.318]  They become petty kings and get really entrenched up there.
[01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:31.560]  Hey, but you just saw Spectre.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.842]  You know, term limits are people being voted out.
[01:26:33.842 --> 01:26:39.286]  And the public's growing up and not being so ignorant.
[01:26:39.286 --> 01:26:41.769]  I'm going to cover that coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:41.769 --> 01:26:44.151]  Let's go ahead and who's up here next, John?
[01:26:45.541 --> 01:26:47.042]  Angel Eyes!
[01:26:47.042 --> 01:26:49.324]  You're on the air, go ahead, from Texas.
[01:26:49.324 --> 01:26:50.344]  Hello, Alex?
[01:26:50.344 --> 01:26:51.765]  Yes.
[01:26:51.765 --> 01:26:56.128]  I disagree with you on your 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny video.
[01:26:56.128 --> 01:27:02.773]  You said that Chandra Levy, Congressman Condit, was like a smoke screen.
[01:27:02.773 --> 01:27:04.214]  Nothing's a smoke screen.
[01:27:04.214 --> 01:27:07.016]  When there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:27:07.016 --> 01:27:12.900]  The week of 9-1-1, Chandra Levy's aunt was on with Baba Wawa.
[01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:22.008]  Uh, telling about how that, uh, Sondra called her and told her something real big was going to happen in America.
[01:27:22.008 --> 01:27:24.188]  And she said she couldn't tell her about it.
[01:27:24.188 --> 01:27:25.649]  And she said, well, what is it?
[01:27:25.649 --> 01:27:27.429]  Well, I can't tell you.
[01:27:27.429 --> 01:27:32.590]  And then she said, well, it's in Washington, DC, New York, Boston.
[01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:38.972]  Uh, your boss, I think Boston was where the, most of the planes took off from where the hijackers were on.
[01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:44.483]  Did I say something in Road to Tyranny about Chandra Levy?
[01:27:44.483 --> 01:27:45.804]  I don't remember saying anything about her.
[01:27:52.022 --> 01:27:52.062]  9-1-1?
[01:28:12.105 --> 01:28:19.572]  You're saying her family said that something big was going to happen in New York and D.C., and of course she was a congressman's aide that died mysteriously.
[01:28:19.572 --> 01:28:22.775]  They later found her bones in the park.
[01:28:22.775 --> 01:28:26.058]  But, I mean, do you have a video clip of that or did you just remember seeing it?
[01:28:26.058 --> 01:28:26.398]  No, sir.
[01:28:26.398 --> 01:28:36.908]  I mean, Baba Wawa's not my favorite person, and I got up and walked out of the room, and my mother watched it and told me about it.
[01:28:38.857 --> 01:28:42.019]  I just kind of, you know, back-barnered it.
[01:28:42.019 --> 01:28:42.159]  Hey!
[01:28:42.159 --> 01:28:44.080]  Somebody email it to us, okay?
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.642]  ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[01:28:46.642 --> 01:28:49.744]  We'll ferret that out with the great listeners out there.
[01:28:49.744 --> 01:28:52.145]  Thank you so much, Angel Eyes.
[01:28:52.145 --> 01:28:54.167]  Let's talk to Scott in California.
[01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:55.508]  Go ahead, Scott.
[01:28:55.508 --> 01:28:58.930]  Mr. Jones, blessings upon you, your family, and your staff.
[01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:00.211]  Keep it going.
[01:29:00.211 --> 01:29:00.571]  Thank you.
[01:29:00.571 --> 01:29:07.195]  It's so important that you keep this information going out to the public, because there are so many people out there who just
[01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:12.179]  Do not want to believe that their government is against them.
[01:29:12.179 --> 01:29:16.982]  And they're so blinded because they don't want to see this.
[01:29:16.982 --> 01:29:30.528]  And it's also very important, not only that you point out all the things that are being used against the American public, but important to give hope by providing solutions on taking back our country non-violently.
[01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:35.051]  Don't just focus on all the things that are happening to you.
[01:29:35.051 --> 01:29:36.832]  Go out there and take your country back.
[01:29:36.832 --> 01:29:38.332]  And go out there and stand up.
[01:29:38.332 --> 01:29:42.594]  The slave will never seek freedom if he already thinks that he's free.
[01:29:42.594 --> 01:29:46.715]  You are not free until you take your mind back.
[01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.235]  Well said!
[01:29:48.235 --> 01:29:51.277]  More calls and news straight ahead.
[01:29:51.277 --> 01:29:52.697]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.697 --> 01:29:55.218]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.218 --> 01:29:57.919]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:07.616]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.616 --> 01:30:12.760]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:27.874]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:30:39.627 --> 01:30:41.768]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.768 --> 01:30:43.568]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:46.449]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.449 --> 01:30:50.670]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:53.071]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:53.071 --> 01:30:55.772]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:55.772 --> 01:30:57.352]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:57.352 --> 01:30:58.133]  Got it.
[01:30:58.133 --> 01:30:59.013]  Others don't.
[01:31:03.922 --> 01:31:04.622]  Action!
[01:31:04.622 --> 01:31:05.883]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.883 --> 01:31:09.604]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.604 --> 01:31:12.045]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.045 --> 01:31:17.907]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.907 --> 01:31:24.129]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.569 --> 01:31:30.550]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:34.711]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.711 --> 01:31:39.012]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.012 --> 01:31:44.953]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.953 --> 01:31:48.513]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.513 --> 01:31:50.494]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.494 --> 01:31:50.934]  It's here.

[01:32:00.942 --> 01:32:03.964]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.964 --> 01:32:09.289]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.289 --> 01:32:11.330]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:16.334]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.334 --> 01:32:17.515]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.515 --> 01:32:18.256]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.636 --> 01:32:20.518]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:21.579]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:23.780]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:25.122]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:26.663]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.663 --> 01:32:31.927]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.927 --> 01:32:35.050]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:39.311]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.311 --> 01:32:40.552]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.552 --> 01:32:41.452]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.452 --> 01:32:42.552]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.552 --> 01:32:43.493]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.493 --> 01:32:44.573]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.573 --> 01:32:47.634]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.634 --> 01:32:49.395]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.395 --> 01:32:50.315]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:01.388 --> 01:33:04.130]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:10.735]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:10.735 --> 01:33:13.677]  Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:33:13.677 --> 01:33:20.502]  I'm gonna take four or five more calls, then I'm gonna start getting into the news.
[01:33:20.502 --> 01:33:25.286]  The situation with North Korea... You name it.
[01:33:28.624 --> 01:33:36.571]  Before I finish up with some of your calls in the cellar, we'll continue in the two hours that follow.
[01:33:36.571 --> 01:33:38.112]  I know many of you are awake.
[01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:45.678]  Most of you understand what's happening globally to a level that exceeds my understanding.
[01:33:45.678 --> 01:33:50.242]  But your friends, your family, your co-workers, your neighbors, your community, they don't know.
[01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:54.482]  Yes, they do understand there's a world government that's been formed.
[01:33:54.482 --> 01:33:57.243]  They know foreign banks are robbing us.
[01:33:57.243 --> 01:34:01.884]  But they don't understand the nuts and bolts, the mechanics of it.
[01:34:01.884 --> 01:34:17.969]  And my films, The Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, those are the two films that I made last year that really break it down the best of any documentaries out there.
[01:34:17.969 --> 01:34:18.709]  And they're evergreen.
[01:34:19.502 --> 01:34:24.743]  Meaning you can watch these in five years, and they'll be more pertinent than they are today.
[01:34:24.743 --> 01:34:27.764]  So they only get better with time.
[01:34:27.764 --> 01:34:31.965]  Because people will watch the Obama deception out 14 months ago, and it's all come true.
[01:34:31.965 --> 01:34:36.026]  They'll watch Fall of the Republic out six, seven months ago, and it's all coming true.
[01:34:36.026 --> 01:34:41.368]  And it breaks down who the globalists are, how they operate, how to stop them, what their system is.
[01:34:41.368 --> 01:34:45.789]  You've got to know your enemy as Sung Soo said thousands of years ago in The Art of War.
[01:34:47.938 --> 01:34:51.736]  And then now our latest documentary, Invisible Empire A New Order Defined.
[01:34:53.615 --> 01:34:58.879]  Goes over their agenda, their mindset, their crimes, what makes them tick.
[01:34:58.879 --> 01:35:02.841]  It's a great two-hour, 20-plus minute film with expanded extras.
[01:35:02.841 --> 01:35:05.824]  And your purchase of the videos also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:35:05.824 --> 01:35:11.227]  They're all available at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore.
[01:35:11.227 --> 01:35:12.448]  InfoWars.com.
[01:35:12.448 --> 01:35:14.049]  Or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:14.049 --> 01:35:14.229]  That's 888.
[01:35:20.954 --> 01:35:23.496]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:35:23.496 --> 01:35:24.918]  You can also write to me at P.O.
[01:35:24.918 --> 01:35:32.304]  Box 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 7-8-7-6-0.
[01:35:32.304 --> 01:35:32.804]  Again, P.O.
[01:35:32.804 --> 01:35:39.990]  Box 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 7-8-7-6-0.
[01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:44.214]  And you can see all of my films and the films we produce at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:36:00.446]  By the way, I had just read this in the last decade, and then I had Jesse Ventura on, and he was talking about he just read The Secret Team, republished by Fletcher Prouty, who died in 2001.
[01:36:00.446 --> 01:36:03.788]  They had a black ops between the Pentagon and the CIA.
[01:36:03.788 --> 01:36:08.290]  And, you know, they would always go in and buy up all the books as soon as they hit store shelves.
[01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:11.372]  Then they bought up his publisher to stop it being published.
[01:36:11.372 --> 01:36:14.313]  So there's only about 40,000 copies out there, though it was a bestseller.
[01:36:16.186 --> 01:36:18.287]  And those have all fallen apart, basically.
[01:36:18.287 --> 01:36:22.108]  I read an old copy a decade ago that literally fell apart as I read it.
[01:36:22.108 --> 01:36:26.430]  It's back out in print by Skyhorse Publishing, the folks that published Ventura's book.
[01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:29.151]  We've got it discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:31.532]  This is the book the CIA does not want you to read.
[01:36:31.532 --> 01:36:36.073]  I started rereading it last week and just finished it this weekend.
[01:36:36.073 --> 01:36:36.814]  Couldn't put it down.
[01:36:38.655 --> 01:36:57.280]  Every night I started reading it, and of course, you think you know it all, but just to read it again, and how dastardly, and how our government funded the Communists, and made deals with them, and how it's all staged, and... I mean, this guy was the head of black ops for covert operations.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.941]  The liaison from the Pentagon to the CIA.
[01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:01.281]  Up until 1963.
[01:37:04.634 --> 01:37:06.956]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[01:37:06.956 --> 01:37:11.860]  These guys think of us as a bunch of dumb animals, and they've decided just to steal everything.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.821]  And look, I want to say this.
[01:37:12.821 --> 01:37:18.066]  It's one thing to have a corrupt government shipping in some drugs and running some whores and killing some people.
[01:37:18.066 --> 01:37:23.310]  That's bad enough, but that's always going to go on.
[01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:29.256]  The reason you've got to stop it is because it always leads to what we have now, total collapse.
[01:37:30.418 --> 01:37:40.668]  Where you greedy people now want everybody's pension funds, and you talk about how we're all spoiled and deserve it, and how, you know, ha ha ha, yeah, we're spiking your water to dumb you down, it's real funny.
[01:37:40.668 --> 01:37:45.352]  I mean, it's just, it's far beyond evil now.
[01:37:45.352 --> 01:37:47.114]  It's to a new level of just darkness.
[01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:50.959]  Alright, I'm going to stop babbling.
[01:37:50.959 --> 01:37:52.600]  The point is, it's all available.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.860]  Of course, Don't Tread on Me is now available at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:58.621]  We were authorized to post it there for members of the highest quality.
[01:37:58.621 --> 01:38:02.322]  And we're posting Camp FEMA two days from now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:02.322 --> 01:38:05.042]  Authorized to post that there for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:38:05.042 --> 01:38:08.323]  Of course, both those DVDs are also available at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:08.323 --> 01:38:12.424]  But I digress.
[01:38:12.424 --> 01:38:14.164]  Let's go to Kathy in Florida.
[01:38:14.164 --> 01:38:15.164]  You're on the air, Kathy.
[01:38:15.164 --> 01:38:16.625]  Go ahead.
[01:38:16.625 --> 01:38:17.265]  Hi, Alex.
[01:38:17.265 --> 01:38:18.665]  I've only called once before.
[01:38:19.306 --> 01:38:23.389]  Kudos to your fantastic show and your videos.
[01:38:23.389 --> 01:38:24.089]  Thank you.
[01:38:24.089 --> 01:38:29.693]  Last time I called, I gave you my little skit, the idiot pledge.
[01:38:29.693 --> 01:38:34.997]  Today, I would like to share with everybody the time that it is.
[01:38:34.997 --> 01:38:36.478]  It's way past dangerous.
[01:38:36.478 --> 01:38:37.439]  It's so obvious.
[01:38:37.439 --> 01:38:38.840]  It's in your face.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.681]  We are under attack.
[01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:44.604]  It's time for all patriots of all stripes to circle the wagons.
[01:38:45.177 --> 01:38:48.019]  And throw the globalists out of this country.
[01:38:48.019 --> 01:38:58.147]  And if we do that... And be prepared for them to set off nukes and terror attacks and every other form of evil to cause crises so they can pose as our saviors.
[01:38:58.147 --> 01:39:03.171]  We've got to tell the whole truth or we'll fall to their future tricks.
[01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:05.653]  Okay, I am aware of their tricks.
[01:39:05.653 --> 01:39:07.174]  Reading is what I do.
[01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:14.420]  I think all patriots should email all of the monopoly media and tell them we are sick of hearing about your Hollywood celebrities
[01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:16.691]  Report the real damn news.
[01:39:16.691 --> 01:39:19.353]  We're sick of the garbage you're feeding us.
[01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:20.354]  We want some real news.
[01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:21.835]  Well, I think they know that, Kathy.
[01:39:21.835 --> 01:39:25.178]  That's why they're all basically on the verge of going bankrupt or have gone bankrupt.
[01:39:25.178 --> 01:39:33.784]  But they've still got to continue to fire on us from their positions and try to keep, you know, that 30, 40 percent of just mindless drones marching forward.
[01:39:33.784 --> 01:39:38.508]  But they know that the tide has shifted against them.
[01:39:38.508 --> 01:39:42.491]  That's why they're all on Facebook, sticking their finger up in the air, seeing which way the wind is blowing.
[01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:45.373]  And then jumping out, pretending like they're leading us.
[01:39:45.373 --> 01:39:48.256]  You know, their actions are so obvious.
[01:39:48.256 --> 01:39:51.039]  If you do not see it, you are a sleeper drug, one of the two.
[01:39:51.969 --> 01:39:52.790]  I hear you, Kathy.
[01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:53.570]  Beautiful points.
[01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:55.692]  Alright, I'm going to go to John in Ohio.
[01:39:55.692 --> 01:39:59.114]  And I like calls that disagree, but we don't get a lot of them.
[01:39:59.114 --> 01:40:12.844]  We tend to get five or ten of the same people that call in, and it's going to start with, yeah, I really agree with some of the work you do in exposing the fascist corporations and NATO and false flag terror and other things like that.
[01:40:13.584 --> 01:40:27.450]  But at the same time, you push a lot of CIA propaganda about Hugo Chavez being bad and the Communist Chinese being bad, and I just really, really think, you know, I want to plug these Communist websites now, Alex, and let me give these websites out to you.
[01:40:27.450 --> 01:40:28.391]  So, John, there.
[01:40:28.391 --> 01:40:29.852]  I've said what you always said.
[01:40:29.852 --> 01:40:35.654]  If you're going to repeat the same thing, I just don't even need to hear it today.
[01:40:35.654 --> 01:40:36.555]  John in Ohio.
[01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:43.678]  How about you plug InfoWars.com for us today instead of WSWS.org or other good websites.
[01:40:43.678 --> 01:40:44.678]  I really like them.
[01:40:44.678 --> 01:40:46.079]  They do some good work.
[01:40:46.079 --> 01:40:47.600]  John, go ahead.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.180]  Okay, that was approximate.
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:51.741]  Replication was approximate.
[01:40:51.741 --> 01:41:01.486]  Not exactly, but I wasn't going to bring that up right now because I used to plug you, but I can't anymore because I want to mention something about Rand Paul that turns up on
[01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:05.512]  InformationClearingHouse.com.
[01:41:05.512 --> 01:41:06.533]  Oh boy.
[01:41:06.533 --> 01:41:14.198]  I wanted to point out that he is actually, he is going to be on Joseph Lieberman and pushing the neocon Zionist line.
[01:41:14.198 --> 01:41:19.242]  He's put out a, to all of his members, his position on Israel.
[01:41:19.242 --> 01:41:25.526]  And it's incredible, if you'll read this article, it's from the American Spectator, but it was picked up by Information Clearing House.
[01:41:25.526 --> 01:41:26.847]  Stop right there, I've seen it.
[01:41:28.139 --> 01:41:30.300]  But let me just tell you this.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:38.505]  Why is Frum and all these other AIPAC lobbyists, why are they all savaging Rand Paul then?
[01:41:38.505 --> 01:41:52.713]  Because all he has said is he supports Israel's right to exist, and he has said that he's against foreign aid, by the way, and he said that if Iran does attack us, we should defend ourselves.
[01:41:52.713 --> 01:41:54.655]  And why are the neocons attacking him?
[01:41:55.595 --> 01:41:59.981]  Because they know he is a patriot.
[01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:01.543]  Okay, that's why they don't want him in.
[01:42:01.543 --> 01:42:05.489]  That's why the entire media is coming down on him with both feet.
[01:42:05.489 --> 01:42:10.035]  And you got the neocons and the controlled left all attacking him.
[01:42:10.035 --> 01:42:12.098]  Doesn't that tell you that Rand Paul's a good guy?
[01:42:13.399 --> 01:42:21.020]  It may not be their favorite neocon, but it's incredible the amount of things that your generalization of what he said is absolutely not true.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:24.761]  He's called for the attacks against Iran.
[01:42:24.761 --> 01:42:29.962]  He has set up the attacks and whitewashed the attacks on the people in Gaza.
[01:42:29.962 --> 01:42:37.764]  In this article to all of his supporters, people have to read this because this could have been written by Joseph Lieberman.
[01:42:37.764 --> 01:42:38.864]  I mean, the idea that
[01:42:39.454 --> 01:42:55.667]  You're going to support the government that is probably the most dangerous bullet point for dragging us into a war against Iran, Israel, whether they're the dog wagging the tail or otherwise, they are the leading spear for dragging us into a war.
[01:42:55.667 --> 01:42:58.850]  Okay, listen, listen, use your head, John.
[01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:06.116]  The entire media establishment is demonizing him as if he is Adolf Hitler incarnate, okay?
[01:43:07.663 --> 01:43:08.804]  Use your brain.
[01:43:08.804 --> 01:43:10.306]  I have read what he said.
[01:43:10.306 --> 01:43:24.639]  He has said that Israel has a right to defend itself and he has said that if Iraq ever, if Iran ever attacks us that he will be for defending ourselves.
[01:43:24.639 --> 01:43:30.124]  He was on Fox News last week and wouldn't say he was for attacking Iran and they criticized him for it.
[01:43:31.798 --> 01:43:38.400]  I'm not forever playing politics, and if I ever see Rand Paul flip-flop, I'll come out against him.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.820]  I've not seen him flip-flop.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:45.522]  He is more hawkish than his father by a million miles, okay?
[01:43:45.522 --> 01:43:53.384]  Ron Paul is, I mean, I'm telling you, you just can't improve on him, and he never wavers.
[01:43:53.384 --> 01:43:56.025]  Now, Rand Paul is not perfect.
[01:43:56.926 --> 01:43:59.348]  But there's no way he's going to get elected to the Senate.
[01:43:59.348 --> 01:44:01.109]  Do I have to spell it out for you here?
[01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:06.994]  There's no way he's going to get elected to the Senate unless he makes some hawking squawking noises.
[01:44:06.994 --> 01:44:08.315]  What's a noise that a hawk makes?
[01:44:08.315 --> 01:44:16.661]  Frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[01:44:17.079 --> 01:44:26.868]  There's no way he's getting elected in hawkish Kentucky without... And I believe it's what he really means.
[01:44:26.868 --> 01:44:30.050]  I mean, I believe that he is for defending the United States.
[01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:32.132]  But he's going to cut the defense budget.
[01:44:32.132 --> 01:44:34.134]  He's going to shut down a bunch of bases.
[01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:36.997]  So I don't think you're listening fully to what he has to say there, John.
[01:44:37.517 --> 01:44:41.278]  I don't think you're giving the accurate quotation.
[01:44:41.278 --> 01:44:42.358]  Okay, read me the quotes!
[01:44:42.358 --> 01:44:43.638]  Read me the quotes!
[01:44:43.638 --> 01:44:46.459]  Well, I'll give you some quotes, okay.
[01:44:46.459 --> 01:44:53.160]  Finally, thankfully, Israel is one of the bravest elite military forces in the world.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.860]  I believe that the United States should increase the pressure on Iran.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:45:01.401]  I would mandate that all public managed investment funds divest from Iran immediately.
[01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:05.022]  What is going on here when it's Israel that is threatening these countries?
[01:45:05.775 --> 01:45:08.619]  of the Middle East, dragging us into World War III.
[01:45:08.619 --> 01:45:17.709]  Now if you would read the full text of what he says, he is actually going beyond the neocons, whether they want him in as their favorite neocon or whatever.
[01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:18.330]  Hold on!
[01:45:18.330 --> 01:45:18.731]  Hold on!
[01:45:18.731 --> 01:45:20.092]  I think I hear Rand Paul!
[01:45:20.092 --> 01:45:20.733]  Hold on!
[01:45:20.733 --> 01:45:21.974]  I think you're right, John!
[01:45:21.974 --> 01:45:24.477]  Hold on!
[01:45:24.477 --> 01:45:25.018]  Is that him?
[01:45:26.383 --> 01:45:31.767]  Look, they're all in panic mode about him, and they say he's lying to get into office.
[01:45:31.767 --> 01:45:37.092]  I don't think that's what he's doing, but I'm confident he's the man for the job.
[01:45:37.092 --> 01:45:44.518]  Why do you think the entire establishment... See, John, this is where you got a real blind spot here, pal.
[01:45:44.518 --> 01:45:53.906]  You know, you like Hugo Chavez because the corporate media is attacking him, and I'll agree he did kill the Summit of the Americas, the expansion of the NAU into Central and South America.
[01:45:55.259 --> 01:46:01.124]  And so he's not perfect, but he is a sandal in their works.
[01:46:01.124 --> 01:46:10.692]  He is sabotaging the larger NAU, spreading into the larger Americas.
[01:46:10.692 --> 01:46:20.320]  So why then is Chavez good because the corporate media is after him, but now Rand Paul is bad, even though the media is having conniption fits over him?
[01:46:21.314 --> 01:46:28.239]  Well, I'm saying that Chavez is not calling for allowing Israel at the time that they're threatening to attack Iran.
[01:46:28.239 --> 01:46:30.000]  I'm against an attack on Iran, pal!
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.821]  I'm against World War III.
[01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:32.782]  So is Ron Paul.
[01:46:32.782 --> 01:46:38.445]  Ron Paul has called sanctions an act of war against Iran, an illegal act of war.
[01:46:38.445 --> 01:46:40.027]  And I agree with him.
[01:46:40.027 --> 01:46:47.371]  And I really think you need to re-examine why the neocons are hyperventilating and attacking Rand Paul from every angle.
[01:46:47.371 --> 01:46:50.674]  I've read the quotes you're talking about and it's...
[01:46:52.695 --> 01:46:55.057]  I mean, read that quote again.
[01:46:55.057 --> 01:47:00.200]  He's against government sanctions that are an act of war, and he thinks that if private U.S.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.443]  corporations want to put sanctions on them, that's their business.
[01:47:04.548 --> 01:47:06.029]  Let me make a point about this.
[01:47:06.029 --> 01:47:09.191]  Ron Paul is different on this issue than Rand Paul.
[01:47:09.191 --> 01:47:11.532]  And you know that because you've read this issue.
[01:47:11.532 --> 01:47:12.873]  That's what I just said!
[01:47:12.873 --> 01:47:21.598]  And the point I'm making is that Rand Paul is supporting the threatened war, nuclear war even, by Israel against Iran, which will drag us into World War III.
[01:47:21.598 --> 01:47:24.039]  Now that is completely off the charts.
[01:47:24.039 --> 01:47:27.481]  He is pushing... Read me a quote or he supports nuclear war.
[01:47:28.362 --> 01:47:40.086]  He's supporting giving Israel the total freedom to do what it's calling for right now, to attack Iran anytime they want.
[01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:44.708]  Read me that quote again.
[01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:49.150]  I'm trying to look at it here, but if you said you've read it, you realize that he said it.
[01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:50.170]  No, I read that article.
[01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:53.631]  It was about a week old.
[01:47:53.631 --> 01:47:54.592]  What's the name of the article again?
[01:47:54.592 --> 01:47:55.172]  I want to pull it up.
[01:47:55.828 --> 01:48:00.695]  Alright, it's called Rand Paul and Israel.
[01:48:00.695 --> 01:48:03.078]  Tea Party candidates are owned by Israel.
[01:48:03.078 --> 01:48:09.106]  It's from an earlier American Spectator, which is not any kind of a liberal magazine.
[01:48:09.474 --> 01:48:19.145]  And he calls for allowing, at the time that they're threatening to attack Iran as the leading spear for dragging us into World War III, he's saying we shouldn't criticize them for doing this.
[01:48:19.145 --> 01:48:26.033]  In the context of what they're doing right now, he is... I know, but John, John, John, John, you just gave me their headline.
[01:48:26.033 --> 01:48:27.775]  What is the American Spectator headline?
[01:48:31.459 --> 01:48:32.099]  I'm not sure.
[01:48:32.099 --> 01:48:39.401]  I would imagine they'd be jumping up and down for glee, the American spectator, over this talk.
[01:48:39.401 --> 01:48:47.142]  But I want to see the quote, because that is disturbing, saying, Israel, you go ahead and nuke them.
[01:48:47.142 --> 01:48:55.604]  I would imagine he said, we're going to cut off foreign aid to everybody, and what sovereign countries do is what sovereign countries do, knowing that Israel is not going to attack without U.S.
[01:48:55.604 --> 01:48:56.984]  backing.
[01:48:56.984 --> 01:48:57.624]  Support it.
[01:48:57.624 --> 01:49:00.585]  Anything that Israel wants to do in the context of attacking
[01:49:01.033 --> 01:49:04.015]  Any country that he calls a threat to Israel.
[01:49:04.015 --> 01:49:10.139]  I mean, that is exactly supporting the incredible and planetary... Is that a quote?
[01:49:10.139 --> 01:49:14.621]  That's a very close paraphrase of what he said yesterday.
[01:49:14.621 --> 01:49:15.682]  No, I want to see the quote.
[01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:22.246]  Listen, send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com right now.
[01:49:22.246 --> 01:49:25.908]  John, and I want to read that quote for myself because that is disturbing.
[01:49:25.908 --> 01:49:28.750]  And also... I don't want to read a paraphrase, John.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:47.754]  I don't have it in front of me at the moment, but what I'm saying is that he's calling for giving total aid to Israel at a time when they're threatening a nuclear war, giving total sanction against Iran, and allowing Israel to do what it wants because we are such a close and brotherly ally of Israel.
[01:49:47.754 --> 01:49:49.155]  That sounds like Joseph Lieberman.
[01:49:49.631 --> 01:50:00.181]  And if you're talking about Chavez, if you want to talk about Republicans... Well, hold on, you're not... Let's go back to the other issue here before you digress into your Lord.
[01:50:00.181 --> 01:50:03.664]  John, I'm trying to understand here.
[01:50:03.664 --> 01:50:05.306]  These don't sound like quotes you're reading.
[01:50:05.306 --> 01:50:07.688]  I've never seen these quotes.
[01:50:07.688 --> 01:50:14.334]  It's not the place of outsiders, he says, to meddle or pass judgment or use our power to force Israel to go into their own interest.
[01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:21.613]  And then he talks about them in the context of their possible attack on Iran.
[01:50:21.613 --> 01:50:26.654]  And then he demonizes Iran as the problem in the Middle East.
[01:50:26.654 --> 01:50:30.996]  Exactly the kinds of propaganda we're getting out of the neocons and Joseph Lieberman.
[01:50:30.996 --> 01:50:35.458]  And it's distinguished from Ron Paul, at least on the war issues and the police state issues, I agree with him.
[01:50:35.458 --> 01:50:44.001]  But he comes down on the side of the Wall Street banks with his libertarianism, slashing and gutting all social programs, which is exactly the IMF and World Bank and Wall Street interest.
[01:50:44.449 --> 01:50:53.655]  I at least agree with his father on that issue, but Grandpa, in this exorable position paper, is a total Zionist.
[01:50:53.655 --> 01:50:56.317]  And I think that's got to be realized.
[01:50:56.317 --> 01:50:59.439]  Whether they're his favorite... Okay, hey, hey, you had your time.
[01:50:59.439 --> 01:51:00.160]  I got the article.

[01:52:01.334 --> 01:52:02.654]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.654 --> 01:52:08.236]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.236 --> 01:52:13.257]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.257 --> 01:52:18.819]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.819 --> 01:52:23.500]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.281]  Here's a question.

[01:53:53.088 --> 01:53:53.508]  That's 508-759-0010.
[01:54:13.875 --> 01:54:19.557]  Look, I'm very loyal to Ron Paul, and I agree with him on every subject.
[01:54:19.557 --> 01:54:20.457]  And I like Rand.
[01:54:20.457 --> 01:54:22.238]  He's been on the show.
[01:54:22.238 --> 01:54:23.519]  He does want to audit the Fed.
[01:54:23.519 --> 01:54:26.580]  He does want to kick the New World Order out.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:31.082]  And he said, look, Israel, you want to attack a country, go ahead and do it.
[01:54:31.082 --> 01:54:33.443]  And that's the extreme paraphrase.
[01:54:33.443 --> 01:54:37.305]  I mean, I know he said, look, countries can do what they want, but he doesn't want to cut foreign aid.
[01:54:39.338 --> 01:54:45.762]  And all I know is the whole media is piling in and attacking him, and I'm gonna support Rand Paul.
[01:54:45.762 --> 01:54:58.731]  And if I start seeing him flip-flop, if he gets into the Senate, on any promises he's made, including promises he's made me personally, I am gonna go absolutely ape.
[01:54:58.731 --> 01:55:00.252]  Know that.
[01:55:00.252 --> 01:55:01.893]  And believe me, I'm gonna get attacked.
[01:55:03.479 --> 01:55:13.462]  Just like when Deborah Medina flip-flopped, 9-11 truth is healthy and good, it's a wonderful thing, those towers fell in a strange way.
[01:55:13.462 --> 01:55:22.745]  She was saying that after the Glenn Beck thing, and then a week later started saying, yes I agree, they're total scum, it's despicable.
[01:55:22.745 --> 01:55:31.708]  That's why I got mad at her, not that she didn't agree with 9-11 truth, as the straw man put out, knowing full well what they did, but that's why they're losers, and you know, they're not us.
[01:55:33.419 --> 01:55:34.620]  I'm sad for Debra Medina.
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:37.522]  You know, she didn't ever even give a concession speech when she lost.
[01:55:37.522 --> 01:55:38.783]  Never even updated her website.
[01:55:38.783 --> 01:55:44.426]  It was like, I'm not going to be able to support her in any future endeavors because of dirty tricks I saw out of her campaign.
[01:55:44.426 --> 01:55:47.328]  I'll just be honest with you, I haven't even talked about this on air.
[01:55:47.328 --> 01:55:50.970]  I mean, this is a whole thing is a dirty business, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:55.493]  And I know Ron Paul's for real and is awesome.
[01:55:55.493 --> 01:56:00.777]  And I know the neocons believe that Ron Paul is playing possum on the military issue.
[01:56:01.701 --> 01:56:02.641]  I don't think he is.
[01:56:02.641 --> 01:56:06.123]  I mean, I think he's more hawkish than his father.
[01:56:06.123 --> 01:56:14.326]  And I believe that he really does support Israel's right, if they want to go attack Iran, to go ahead and try it.
[01:56:14.326 --> 01:56:16.627]  And to keep the United States out of it.
[01:56:16.627 --> 01:56:23.470]  And you notice these are also campaign texts that are being circulated, because I do have the material now here in front of me.
[01:56:24.577 --> 01:56:26.058]  It's Rand Paul in Israel.
[01:56:26.058 --> 01:56:28.520]  If I have time later, I'm going to get into it, but listen.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.761]  Listen, here's the deal.
[01:56:29.761 --> 01:56:33.885]  I've opened the phones up today and I've already gotten deep into the show without really plowing into news.
[01:56:33.885 --> 01:56:38.989]  I want to get into the North Korea situation, what's happening in the world, why all these crises are kicking in right now.
[01:56:38.989 --> 01:56:40.850]  I want to get into the economy.
[01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:42.452]  There's just so much.
[01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:47.257]  I want to get into the political realignment that's happened, where the world is going.
[01:56:47.257 --> 01:56:49.458]  It all ties together at the 8 after.
[01:56:49.458 --> 01:56:53.120]  I'm done with calls at least until about 40 into the next hour.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:56.121]  This segment and the next, your phone calls right now.
[01:56:56.121 --> 01:57:02.003]  We just blew like 10 minutes with John, but he did have some serious points.
[01:57:02.003 --> 01:57:03.664]  Let's go ahead and talk to another John.
[01:57:03.664 --> 01:57:06.025]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:57:06.025 --> 01:57:06.605]  Alex?
[01:57:06.605 --> 01:57:06.985]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:06.985 --> 01:57:07.986]  Can you hear me?
[01:57:07.986 --> 01:57:09.306]  Yes, I do.
[01:57:09.306 --> 01:57:09.546]  Okay.
[01:57:09.546 --> 01:57:11.207]  A couple of months ago I was
[01:57:12.233 --> 01:57:20.818]  Linked on to a blog site, or a website, they had a Chinese news program and they were covering the joint Chinese-Russian maneuvers in China.
[01:57:20.818 --> 01:57:21.759]  Yeah.
[01:57:21.759 --> 01:57:35.848]  And when it was over with, they had this great big huge formation, thousands of them, they had this Chinese general standing up in front of them talking, but all they talked about was they were peacekeepers and they were going on peacekeeping missions and they were training for peacekeeping operations.
[01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:39.310]  And I was wondering how these people are going to fit into any kind of
[01:57:39.969 --> 01:57:41.710]  Military operation against Korea.
[01:57:41.710 --> 01:57:55.735]  If they're going to be against it, which they probably will be, but... Well, I'm going to cover that at 8 after, but you... I always love the synchronicity, or serendipity, either way you slice it, of callers calling in about subjects I plan to cover.
[01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:58.857]  Not just peacekeeping in the Korean Peninsula.
[01:57:58.857 --> 01:58:00.277]  And we know that war was staged.
[01:58:00.277 --> 01:58:04.079]  In fact, guys, will you get me the Secret Team book?
[01:58:04.079 --> 01:58:04.999]  Thank you.
[01:58:04.999 --> 01:58:06.420]  It's in the back.
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.220]  By Fletcher Prouty.
[01:58:09.963 --> 01:58:11.644]  Listen, this is not my opinion.
[01:58:11.644 --> 01:58:23.531]  I would laugh at Patriots 15 years ago saying they're planning to use foreign troops in America until I went to drills and witnessed the role players with foreign troops practicing for the US.
[01:58:23.531 --> 01:58:27.213]  Now we have NLE09, NLE010 documents.
[01:58:27.213 --> 01:58:29.174]  We have the West Point statements.
[01:58:29.174 --> 01:58:38.440]  They really are planning to use Chinese, European Union, NATO, German, Israeli, French, Australian troops in America.
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:39.602]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:50.836 --> 01:58:54.917]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:59:56.306 --> 02:00:05.449]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.449 --> 02:00:06.750]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:07.730]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.511 --> 02:00:10.272]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.272 --> 02:00:11.853]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.853 --> 02:00:13.114]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.114 --> 02:00:17.597]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.597 --> 02:00:24.081]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.081 --> 02:00:34.048]  Yeah, the Shanghai Cooperative Organization between Russia and China is openly drilling to go into southern and northern Korea.
[02:00:35.663 --> 02:00:39.905]  The whole world is gearing up for fireworks on every front.
[02:00:39.905 --> 02:00:41.446]  It's all happening now.
[02:00:41.446 --> 02:00:43.667]  Just like in the lead up to World War I and World War II.
[02:00:43.667 --> 02:00:46.869]  And it's not just Alex Jones saying this.
[02:00:46.869 --> 02:00:58.614]  Any geopolitical strategist who's worth ten cents of salt can tell that we better buckle up.
[02:00:58.614 --> 02:00:59.495]  Buckle up!
[02:01:00.552 --> 02:01:04.193]  Because you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:01:04.193 --> 02:01:08.075]  The world is going into controlled, orchestrated chaos.
[02:01:08.075 --> 02:01:12.476]  But John in Texas, I think you answered your question with the statement you made.
[02:01:12.476 --> 02:01:27.401]  Yes, they're gearing up for what appears to be an engineered regional conflict, but done in multiple regions of the planet, engineered, controlled World War III to bring in the global government.
[02:01:27.401 --> 02:01:28.622]  I was in the infantry in Vietnam in 1970.
[02:01:29.983 --> 02:01:31.644]  And we were fighting the Chinese by proxy.
[02:01:31.644 --> 02:01:36.365]  We were killing Chinese advisors that were leading the NVA patrols when I was over there.
[02:01:36.365 --> 02:01:41.067]  And, uh, I think they wanted to engineer the destruction of our firebase, firebase Ripcord.
[02:01:41.067 --> 02:01:43.328]  It was totally, you know, annihilated.
[02:01:43.328 --> 02:01:47.449]  And, uh, uh, you've seen how they behaved in the Korean War.
[02:01:47.449 --> 02:01:51.530]  They, they burn our, our prisoners of war alive in their, the Trojan Reservoir.
[02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:55.071]  They overran medical teams and burned all the prisoners alive.
[02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:56.552]  And they backed the Khyber Rouge.
[02:01:57.237 --> 02:02:00.047]  And you've seen how they treat their people at Tiananmen Square, I mean...
[02:02:02.026 --> 02:02:07.727]  If they were to ever get into this country or whatever, I know how they'd behave.
[02:02:07.727 --> 02:02:09.588]  Oh, this country's for sale.
[02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:18.930]  The globalists, 30 years ago, made the decision to have Europe be their new western command base, but their eastern command base is China.
[02:02:18.930 --> 02:02:23.171]  According to the globalists, and you now see that in the headlines, America is gone.
[02:02:23.171 --> 02:02:24.512]  You won't recognize America.
[02:02:24.512 --> 02:02:25.752]  They're letting you know.
[02:02:25.752 --> 02:02:26.952]  We raped you.
[02:02:26.952 --> 02:02:28.433]  We stole everything.
[02:02:28.433 --> 02:02:29.953]  Now we're going to totally get rid of you.
[02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:57.744]  and uh... it's just in any of the average cop says i don't care i'm going out of the ship least i get the boston slaves and so we're just gonna sink unless we wake up to help a static we aren't admit were slaves and only by admitting how pathetic we are can we ever get our past freedom and glory back uh... but uh... no china is the model it's the chinese century that mean the chinese people but it means that their slave masters
[02:02:58.664 --> 02:03:04.127]  Because they've got the best slave system, have been chosen as the apple of the New World Order's eye.
[02:03:04.127 --> 02:03:06.648]  I appreciate your call, John.
[02:03:06.648 --> 02:03:08.149]  Let's talk to Matt in Indiana.
[02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:09.790]  You're on the air.
[02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:10.770]  Mr. Jones.
[02:03:10.770 --> 02:03:11.791]  Hey, buddy.
[02:03:11.791 --> 02:03:24.357]  I think it's no coincidence, leading up to the oil rig thing, we had all those coal mine disasters, and I think it's almost a silver bullet, but to decriminalize and legalize hemp, which re-industrialized
[02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:36.397]  I mean, it really would, because it's better than cotton, it's better than polyester, it's a miracle product.
[02:03:36.397 --> 02:03:37.117]  But you know what?
[02:03:37.117 --> 02:03:43.722]  People would rather have asbestos in their house, and they'd rather have polyester, and they'd rather have petrochemicals.
[02:03:43.722 --> 02:03:44.863]  So you know what?
[02:03:44.863 --> 02:03:50.567]  Again, George Washington grew it, and the Constitution's written on it, but it's evil, okay?
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:59.084]  And I'd like to give a little rundown of the police state city that I live in, Evansville, Indiana, home of the Liberty Dollar.
[02:03:59.084 --> 02:04:05.228]  Since 94, the general OTC was military recruiting in the schools, cameras on the buses.
[02:04:05.228 --> 02:04:07.169]  Indiana has a secure ID.
[02:04:07.169 --> 02:04:10.451]  We got two chains of gas stations here scanning IDs for cigarettes.
[02:04:10.956 --> 02:04:14.457]  We got facial recognition cameras at the airport and the license branches.
[02:04:14.457 --> 02:04:19.259]  Now, I've always found Indiana is top of the food chain in police state.
[02:04:19.259 --> 02:04:21.760]  Every time evil pops up, it's Indiana.
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:23.640]  And see, Indiana's got great folks.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:29.102]  Going back over 20 years, they did an analysis and found that Indiana was just full of great people.
[02:04:29.102 --> 02:04:33.444]  Just like Idaho, or Utah, or Texas.
[02:04:33.444 --> 02:04:36.645]  Wherever they know there's good Americans, they move the grid in.
[02:04:37.921 --> 02:04:43.527]  We have an Indiana Department of Homeland Security Mobile Command Center parked on a street here in Evansville, Indiana.
[02:04:43.527 --> 02:04:45.008]  Oh, making sure of the slaves?
[02:04:45.008 --> 02:04:46.790]  You're milk cows, man.
[02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:50.094]  When they're done using you up for milk, they're gonna slit your throat.
[02:04:50.094 --> 02:04:54.338]  And they've got devil dog troops ready to kill you and ask for seconds.
[02:04:54.338 --> 02:04:55.960]  Hoorah!
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.261]  It's good to butcher America!
[02:05:00.738 --> 02:05:03.140]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:05.463]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:05:05.463 --> 02:05:08.665]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:05:08.665 --> 02:05:13.770]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:05:13.770 --> 02:05:17.974]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:05:18.274 --> 02:05:20.618]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:05:20.618 --> 02:05:23.162]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:05:23.162 --> 02:05:26.426]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:05:26.426 --> 02:05:34.038]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:05:34.352 --> 02:05:39.754]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:05:39.754 --> 02:05:42.614]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:42.614 --> 02:05:46.295]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:05:46.295 --> 02:05:47.356]  And I got news for you.
[02:05:47.356 --> 02:05:48.696]  You're everyone else.
[02:05:48.696 --> 02:05:50.197]  Invisible Empire.

[02:06:54.096 --> 02:06:54.536]  Thank you!
[02:07:00.441 --> 02:07:05.405]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.405 --> 02:07:06.406]  What have we got?
[02:07:06.406 --> 02:07:08.848]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.848 --> 02:07:09.849]  A republic.
[02:07:09.849 --> 02:07:12.511]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.511 --> 02:07:14.773]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.773 --> 02:07:16.795]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.795 --> 02:07:18.476]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:18.476 --> 02:07:19.798]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:19.798 --> 02:07:20.398]  Children?
[02:07:20.398 --> 02:07:21.519]  Our education?
[02:07:21.519 --> 02:07:22.360]  Our money?
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:26.003]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.363 --> 02:07:31.329]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:31.329 --> 02:07:32.370]  We have the facts.
[02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:33.511]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:33.511 --> 02:07:34.433]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.433 --> 02:07:35.314]  We have common law.
[02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:37.837]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:37.837 --> 02:07:41.621]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:07:48.167 --> 02:07:49.248]  Don't tread on me.

[02:08:11.004 --> 02:08:12.586]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.586 --> 02:08:14.127]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.127 --> 02:08:18.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:22.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.739 --> 02:08:41.740]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:46.743]  Samuel Casting, The Syndicated Radio Broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:46.743 --> 02:08:48.665]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:48.665 --> 02:08:58.872]  I'm going to cover a bunch of news right now until later in the hour, then we'll open the phones back up at 1-800-259-9231 for everyone that is patiently holding around the country and the world who is tuned in.
[02:09:05.211 --> 02:09:17.422]  Okay, before I get into the political realignment happening here in the United States and in other parts of the globe, before I get into the economy, I want to cover North Korea, because it all integrates together.
[02:09:17.422 --> 02:09:31.474]  It was Lenin, Vladimir Lenin, who said that there are times in history when more happens in a week than happen in a year, and when more happens in a year than happen in the previous hundred years.
[02:09:33.737 --> 02:09:57.266]  And we are definitely in that time frame right now, but because of the convergence of technological developments, population, communication, and high-powered military hardware, and other factors all combining together now, you're not going to see a decade of rapid change.
[02:09:58.331 --> 02:09:58.391]  I'm
[02:10:16.970 --> 02:10:31.501]  The issue is, though, the ruling global elite, from their own statements and white papers, the ruling global elite that are in control of society right now, have disdain for the general public.
[02:10:31.501 --> 02:10:33.143]  They think of you as scum and trash.
[02:10:34.013 --> 02:10:36.615]  They don't even want to dumb you down or enslave you further.
[02:10:36.615 --> 02:10:42.098]  They want to set up a global police state so they can then exterminate you.
[02:10:42.098 --> 02:10:43.539]  And this is their stated goal.
[02:10:43.539 --> 02:10:49.663]  We've covered it ad nauseum with my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and other documentaries.
[02:10:49.663 --> 02:10:54.827]  And we've read their publications and quotes here on air over and over and over again.
[02:10:55.347 --> 02:11:02.331]  And so if you're a new viewer or listener and you're laughing about this, you better do a little research.
[02:11:02.331 --> 02:11:16.199]  Say at WhatIsTheEndGame.com or EndGameTheMovie.com and read the full bibliography for the two and a half hour film and check all the facts and claims for yourself.
[02:11:16.199 --> 02:11:19.341]  You might want to read Ecoscience written by the White House Science Czar.
[02:11:20.875 --> 02:11:22.097]  1100 pages.
[02:11:22.097 --> 02:11:25.721]  You might want to read the 900 pages of Tragedy and Hope.
[02:11:25.721 --> 02:11:32.690]  You might want to read The Secret Team by Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty.
[02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:35.434]  Now back in print, by the way, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:37.483 --> 02:11:53.809]  Of course, Ecoscience and Tragedy and Hope are written by top globalists from their perspective of how they've got to have a planetary dictatorship to then kill you, to do it as humanely as possible, sterilize you with the fluoride, but that's not enough.
[02:11:53.809 --> 02:12:05.433]  You can read the head Pentagon liaison, and they don't deny this, it's on record, between the Pentagon and black ops, Bay of Pigs, you name it, where he details
[02:12:07.404 --> 02:12:11.367]  Everything that Joseph McCarthy said was true.
[02:12:11.367 --> 02:12:15.631]  Everything and more.
[02:12:15.631 --> 02:12:22.556]  Of course, the Russians in the last decade have declassified their McCarthy files, and you've seen the headline in the New York Times, McCarthy was right!
[02:12:23.732 --> 02:12:25.833]  But now it's quaint and funny.
[02:12:25.833 --> 02:12:44.142]  Kind of like a decade ago, time sure flies, I was watching History Channel, and they had the 90-plus-year-old former CIA Section Chief on from 1949, who was over China, and also into China, not just China proper, but also over Vietnam.
[02:12:45.652 --> 02:12:57.127]  And he bragged and said, yes, we put Mao Zedong in power, we didn't like Shanghai's check, but we couldn't tell the public that at the time because communism was unpopular.
[02:12:57.127 --> 02:12:59.651]  Now, I literally almost fell out of my chair.
[02:13:02.247 --> 02:13:07.373]  Just like when I heard BBC admit our government grows and ships out the opium out of Afghanistan last year.
[02:13:07.373 --> 02:13:10.417]  I almost ran off the road listening to XM.
[02:13:10.417 --> 02:13:19.288]  Because I already knew this, but to hear them, to hear Kermit Roosevelt six, seven years ago on NPR, it was a tape after he died,
[02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:32.343]  He died in 99, CIA commander, 53, with Schwarzkopf's daddy, overthrown Iran, bragging that they staged terror attacks and used radical Muslims to overthrow Mohammad Mossadegh.
[02:13:32.343 --> 02:13:37.869]  Again, I already know all of this, but to hear him brag about it.
[02:13:38.863 --> 02:13:52.091]  Knowing that the public's so dumbed down and so pathetic that they can now have Geraldo Rivera go on Fox and talk to Marine Corps commanders with the troops gathered around going, you're growing the opium here.
[02:13:52.091 --> 02:13:52.771]  Tell us why.
[02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:55.533]  Well, we have to grow it or Al-Qaeda will get it.
[02:13:55.533 --> 02:14:01.537]  So we gotta help the farmers grow it and ship it out.
[02:14:01.537 --> 02:14:05.019]  We don't cover conspiracy theories here on this show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:06.285 --> 02:14:06.986]  99% of the time.
[02:14:06.986 --> 02:14:12.189]  If we get into numerology and the occult and how the elite are obsessed with it, yes.
[02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:15.190]  But only because that's what they're into.
[02:14:15.190 --> 02:14:18.832]  It's all conspiracy, no theory.
[02:14:18.832 --> 02:14:26.957]  But rereading The Secret Team, because Jesse Ventura recommended I reread it, he had just read it and was blown away by it, paradigm shifting for him.
[02:14:26.957 --> 02:14:32.280]  Then I told Ventura, off-air, I said, now you've got to read Tragedy and Hope.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.541]  Don't just read somebody on the inside who was against it.
[02:14:39.557 --> 02:14:45.580]  Read somebody from the inside who was for it.
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:47.622]  What does this have to do with North Korea?
[02:14:47.622 --> 02:14:52.084]  Everything.
[02:14:52.084 --> 02:15:04.691]  There were several meetings with Roosevelt and Churchill that they had at the end of World War II and then
[02:15:06.247 --> 02:15:15.211]  After Roosevelt died, meetings with Stalin and, of course, Harry Truman.
[02:15:15.211 --> 02:15:22.154]  And those were public meetings that they announced each time months after it had happened.
[02:15:22.154 --> 02:15:29.957]  And he talks about in there how the Soviets, who'd been our ally during World War II, the West said, how do we set up a police state domestically?
[02:15:29.957 --> 02:15:31.338]  How do you set up a police state?
[02:15:31.338 --> 02:15:31.958]  You need an enemy.
[02:15:33.382 --> 02:15:40.588]  And they said, well, we'll demonize you, you demonize us.
[02:15:40.588 --> 02:15:43.430]  We'll cover your atrocities, you'll cover ours.
[02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:47.453]  And then we'll have proxy wars with each other, so we don't ever have to nuke each other.
[02:15:47.453 --> 02:15:50.076]  And we'll take half of a country, and you take the other half.
[02:15:50.076 --> 02:15:52.197]  You take half of Korea, we take the other half.
[02:15:52.197 --> 02:15:53.438]  Half of Vietnam, the other half.
[02:15:53.438 --> 02:16:00.044]  We take half of Europe, which they divided Germany in half, of course, and took over half of Eastern Europe.
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:03.461]  We'll divide it all in half with you.
[02:16:03.461 --> 02:16:05.862]  And at first it was even public.
[02:16:05.862 --> 02:16:07.323]  And it was all staged.
[02:16:07.323 --> 02:16:08.564]  Every stinking bit of it.
[02:16:08.564 --> 02:16:16.988]  Oh, it's not staged when you're in a foxhole, you know, fighting communists.
[02:16:16.988 --> 02:16:23.352]  But it's staged when you're in the upper command and you're not allowed to bomb actual factories in the North.
[02:16:26.428 --> 02:16:28.828]  And of course it got declassified two weeks ago that the U.S.
[02:16:28.828 --> 02:16:30.849]  wanted to nuke China with Russia.
[02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:34.909]  In fact, reprint me that London Guardian article.
[02:16:34.909 --> 02:16:38.770]  The headline was, Russia wanted to nuke China.
[02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:41.051]  And then you read that, well, the U.S.
[02:16:41.051 --> 02:16:50.932]  two years before had wanted to nuke them as part of their deal with the Communist, because China wasn't following their agreements that had been made when the U.S.
[02:16:50.932 --> 02:16:52.493]  put Mao into power.
[02:16:52.493 --> 02:16:54.773]  So there is some infighting going on.
[02:16:56.038 --> 02:16:57.899]  From time to time.
[02:16:57.899 --> 02:17:00.420]  There's no honor among thieves with these people.
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:02.221]  So they're always double-checking each other.
[02:17:02.221 --> 02:17:07.803]  It's like the final round of Risk, or multi-dimensional, multi-level chess.
[02:17:07.803 --> 02:17:10.985]  They're not just playing with two colors, okay?
[02:17:10.985 --> 02:17:19.548]  It's more like five or six big factions with sub-factions all in there cheating each other.
[02:17:19.548 --> 02:17:21.089]  Now what did McCarthy said?
[02:17:21.089 --> 02:17:24.330]  McCarthy had said there were communists everywhere taking over America.
[02:17:24.330 --> 02:17:25.391]  Look at us 50 years later.
[02:17:26.909 --> 02:17:28.810]  Big government runs everything.
[02:17:28.810 --> 02:17:35.836]  They tell you what size your lightbulb can be, what type of toilet you can have, where your kids can, you know, just everything's controlled now.
[02:17:35.836 --> 02:17:38.437]  But it's communism by the banks.
[02:17:38.437 --> 02:17:42.761]  They take your money and then give it to themselves through the government.
[02:17:42.761 --> 02:17:51.107]  But as soon as Joseph McCarthy, and if you understand this, you understand everything, as soon as Joseph McCarthy realized
[02:17:52.239 --> 02:17:59.060]  And went public and said, I've discovered the communist conspiracy is run by the Pentagon.
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:04.001]  And they said, excuse me, you're saying that the commies in Russia have infiltrated the Pentagon.
[02:18:04.001 --> 02:18:04.981]  And he said, no.
[02:18:04.981 --> 02:18:07.362]  I mean, go read his speeches.
[02:18:07.362 --> 02:18:10.622]  He said, no, the Pentagon is the communist.
[02:18:10.622 --> 02:18:12.883]  That's who runs the whole thing.
[02:18:12.883 --> 02:18:15.923]  Well, who had set up the UN in 45?
[02:18:15.923 --> 02:18:21.264]  Who had set up the tank and tractor factories with General Motors and Ford?
[02:18:23.410 --> 02:18:37.477]  Who gave Russia the weapons and the oil and the raw materials to then ship it to North Korea and ship it to Northern Vietnam and to ship it into Cuba?
[02:18:37.477 --> 02:18:38.658]  Because again, the U.S.
[02:18:38.658 --> 02:18:40.759]  gets to take part of a country.
[02:18:40.759 --> 02:18:42.500]  Again, it goes back to World War II.
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:43.980]  What did Hitler do?
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:45.801]  He made a secret deal with Stalin.
[02:18:45.801 --> 02:18:48.283]  This is now declassified in public.
[02:18:48.283 --> 02:18:50.684]  The Nazi-slash-Soviet pact.
[02:18:51.769 --> 02:19:01.251]  They made a deal to where Hitler said he was protecting Poland from the Russians, and the Russians were protecting the other part of Poland from the Nazis.
[02:19:01.251 --> 02:19:05.332]  And so they came in and divided the country of Poland.
[02:19:05.332 --> 02:19:11.554]  I mean, if you want to defeat the New World Order, folks, you've got to understand their master strategic planning.
[02:19:12.679 --> 02:19:14.520]  And why they're so hard to beat.
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:22.283]  And stop thinking black versus white, Christian versus Muslim, you know, two-dimensional game of checkers.
[02:19:22.283 --> 02:19:24.424]  This is chess, but at multi-level.
[02:19:24.424 --> 02:19:32.628]  It's like playing ten chess games at once, folks, with millions of different factors coming in.
[02:19:32.628 --> 02:19:39.771]  And so as soon as McCarthy realized that the communist conspiracy was run by Wall Street,
[02:19:41.468 --> 02:19:42.890]  He was no longer useful.
[02:19:42.890 --> 02:19:52.660]  Oh, he was very useful letting the feds take over Hollywood and create a right-wing backlash that they could push a police state with as part of this dialectic.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:56.904]  But as soon as he figured out the real takeover, he was out of there in a New York minute.
[02:19:56.904 --> 02:19:57.465]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.141 --> 02:20:02.462]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.462 --> 02:20:08.044]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.044 --> 02:20:13.066]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.066 --> 02:20:13.526]  It's true.
[02:20:13.526 --> 02:20:18.628]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:18.628 --> 02:20:23.850]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:25.731]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:20:26.161 --> 02:20:30.964]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:30.964 --> 02:20:32.085]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.085 --> 02:20:35.147]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.147 --> 02:20:38.769]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.769 --> 02:20:41.971]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:41.971 --> 02:20:44.193]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:44.193 --> 02:20:45.134]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.134 --> 02:20:45.314]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.905 --> 02:20:57.807]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:57.807 --> 02:21:01.248]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:01.248 --> 02:21:03.589]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.589 --> 02:21:05.950]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:09.171]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.171 --> 02:21:14.273]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.273 --> 02:21:18.455]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.775 --> 02:21:21.117]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.117 --> 02:21:23.660]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:26.923]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.923 --> 02:21:34.530]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.850 --> 02:21:40.252]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.252 --> 02:21:43.092]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.092 --> 02:21:46.793]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.793 --> 02:21:47.854]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.854 --> 02:21:49.194]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:49.194 --> 02:21:50.695]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:00.566 --> 02:22:03.507]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:22:03.507 --> 02:22:07.669]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:22:07.669 --> 02:22:09.930]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:09.930 --> 02:22:15.092]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:15.092 --> 02:22:16.912]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:22:16.912 --> 02:22:18.233]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:18.453 --> 02:22:19.934]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:19.934 --> 02:22:23.315]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:23.315 --> 02:22:28.697]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:22:28.697 --> 02:22:37.781]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:22:38.021 --> 02:22:43.203]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.203 --> 02:22:46.684]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.

[02:22:53.367 --> 02:22:54.167]  Let's talk tough.
[02:22:54.167 --> 02:22:54.948]  Let's talk comfort.
[02:23:04.130 --> 02:23:06.511]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:09.433]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[02:23:09.433 --> 02:23:11.454]  Like you wore as a kid.
[02:23:11.454 --> 02:23:12.334]  Remember?
[02:23:12.334 --> 02:23:27.362]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond-gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:23:30.997 --> 02:23:41.901]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:23:41.901 --> 02:23:43.401]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[02:23:43.401 --> 02:23:46.662]  In our Defender Motorcycle Jeans comes Kevlar reinforced.
[02:23:46.662 --> 02:23:51.204]  See them at gusset.com, that's gusset.com, or call 888-848-7738.
[02:23:54.185 --> 02:23:57.027]  That's 888-848-7738.
[02:23:57.027 --> 02:23:58.629]  Diamond Gus of Gene's got it.
[02:23:58.629 --> 02:24:04.253]  Others don't.
[02:24:04.253 --> 02:24:11.719]  Okay, so that was quite a bit of preface in the last segment before I get into North Korea.
[02:24:11.719 --> 02:24:18.784]  Fast forwarding to 1995-96, the head of ABB, the Swiss nuclear power plant company,
[02:24:19.958 --> 02:24:24.660]  Is Donald Rumsfeld a key gopher for the globalist?
[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:28.741]  I mean, he's the guy that gets DEU approved for our troops to use.
[02:24:28.741 --> 02:24:30.962]  He's the guy that gets Aspartame approved.
[02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:33.403]  He's the guy that gets Prozac approved.
[02:24:33.403 --> 02:24:37.445]  I mean, he is the key man on so many levels.
[02:24:37.445 --> 02:24:40.246]  He gets, what was it, six?
[02:24:40.246 --> 02:24:41.206]  We can pull up the article.
[02:24:41.206 --> 02:24:42.927]  In fact, I don't want to go off memory.
[02:24:42.927 --> 02:24:47.709]  Google nuclear reactors to North Korea, Donald Rumsfeld, ABB.
[02:24:48.971 --> 02:24:56.465]  But multiple reactors are sent, and they're the type that you can actually create A-bombs with the material.
[02:24:57.762 --> 02:25:02.243]  And the media was like, why did the Swiss sell them this?
[02:25:02.243 --> 02:25:02.843]  Why did the U.S.
[02:25:02.843 --> 02:25:04.143]  government stand by?
[02:25:04.143 --> 02:25:20.126]  Why did our government and Israel help, on record, give AQ Khan Laboratories, from the late 80s through the mid 90s, the components to not just make hydrogen bombs or A-bombs, but to have medium-range and long-range delivery system.
[02:25:20.126 --> 02:25:20.866]  There it is.
[02:25:20.866 --> 02:25:22.346]  There's ABB's website.
[02:25:22.346 --> 02:25:25.387]  ABB to deliver systems equipped to North Korean nuclear plants.
[02:25:26.007 --> 02:25:27.189]  There's their press release.
[02:25:27.189 --> 02:25:29.111]  Good job, guys.
[02:25:29.111 --> 02:25:29.812]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:34.672]  And he's always the head of the company for like six months.
[02:25:34.672 --> 02:25:37.493]  He'll step in and get aspartame approved.
[02:25:37.493 --> 02:25:40.015]  Chemical weapon feces from bacteria.
[02:25:40.015 --> 02:25:41.475]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:25:41.475 --> 02:25:45.898]  He'll step in and get Prozac approved as the head of the company.
[02:25:45.898 --> 02:25:48.859]  He'll step in and get Terminator seeds approved.
[02:25:48.859 --> 02:25:53.141]  He'll step in and get the bioweapons of Saddam in 84.
[02:25:53.141 --> 02:25:56.023]  He'll step in and get the reactors transferred.
[02:25:57.694 --> 02:26:01.916]  Brzezinski's a similar high-level globalist.
[02:26:01.916 --> 02:26:02.837]  So is Kissinger.
[02:26:02.837 --> 02:26:11.822]  But the issue here is... In fact, here's another headline today.
[02:26:11.822 --> 02:26:14.283]  Dealing with Israel.
[02:26:14.283 --> 02:26:24.229]  London Guardian giving nukes to South Africa.
[02:26:24.229 --> 02:26:24.429]  Why?
[02:26:25.854 --> 02:26:27.475]  Why was Israel involved with the U.S.
[02:26:27.475 --> 02:26:30.217]  and England creating the Mujahideen to fight the Russians?
[02:26:30.217 --> 02:26:34.979]  They've always run these Muslim extremists.
[02:26:34.979 --> 02:26:48.087]  And again, you'll have the top terror controllers, who are Muslim leaders, who are global double and triple agents, who literally have Muslim extremists working for them, who really think they're fighting for Allah out doing this.
[02:26:48.087 --> 02:26:52.610]  So, the guy they bust in the street, he's a real Muslim terrorist.
[02:26:52.610 --> 02:26:54.591]  But he doesn't know he's working for Mossad.
[02:26:56.351 --> 02:26:57.272]  Or MI6?
[02:26:57.272 --> 02:27:01.476]  In fact, I've got another stack of mainstream articles here today.
[02:27:01.476 --> 02:27:07.282]  Headline, Terror Inquest May Probe MI5 Role, BBC.
[02:27:07.282 --> 02:27:12.667]  MI5 Faces Probe Over July 7 Bombings.
[02:27:12.667 --> 02:27:16.151]  MI5 Faces Probe Over 7-7 and Their Role in It.
[02:27:18.936 --> 02:27:20.997]  How long have we told you that that's an inside job?
[02:27:20.997 --> 02:27:24.498]  And the families have demanded this investigation on the cover-up.
[02:27:24.498 --> 02:27:28.259]  And you go to the evidence, the government ran those attacks on 7-7.
[02:27:28.259 --> 02:27:32.340]  And had some idiots they'd hired to take part in a drill, who they blew up.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:35.301]  One guy got away, so they shot him up at Canary Wharf.
[02:27:35.301 --> 02:27:38.982]  That was on the news!
[02:27:38.982 --> 02:27:39.982]  But, I'm digressing.
[02:27:41.377 --> 02:27:56.482]  Here it is, London Telegraph, USSR planned nuclear attack on China in 69, but buried in the declassification from the Chinese and Russian archives is that the US had had a secret deal with the Russians against China.
[02:27:56.482 --> 02:28:08.246]  And that Nixon was mad that two years before, Russia hadn't agreed to launch a sneak attack on China when they wanted to.
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:16.442]  And so by then, Nixon already made a deal with China to menace Russia.
[02:28:16.442 --> 02:28:19.884]  So this back and forth is always going on behind the scenes.
[02:28:19.884 --> 02:28:28.007]  But it is on record now that our government put Mao Zedong in, who killed between 64 and 82 million people.
[02:28:28.007 --> 02:28:29.867]  The Chinese government says 82 million.
[02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:31.368]  Our government says 84 million.
[02:28:31.368 --> 02:28:31.748]  Whatever.
[02:28:32.481 --> 02:28:34.023]  After 84 million, who's counting?
[02:28:34.023 --> 02:28:35.964]  Well, each one's a human being.
[02:28:35.964 --> 02:28:42.611]  How many sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people is that to give you an image of the humanity disappearing?
[02:28:42.611 --> 02:28:49.357]  And David Rockefeller writing books about how great Mao is, and editorials in the New York Times praising communism?
[02:28:49.357 --> 02:28:51.820]  Why would one of the richest men in the world be praising communism?
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:53.161]  Well, read his stinking column!
[02:28:53.161 --> 02:28:53.942]  He tells you why!
[02:28:53.942 --> 02:28:56.845]  Okay, I'm gonna settle down.
[02:28:58.991 --> 02:29:11.298]  The issue is with all of that backdrop and our government helping transfer nuclear weapons fissile material to North Korea, why would our government do that?
[02:29:11.298 --> 02:29:17.701]  Because they don't want Japan and South Korea living in peace.
[02:29:17.701 --> 02:29:24.525]  Because they won't need our bases there if they're not being menaced from the North.
[02:29:24.525 --> 02:29:26.906]  Japan won't need our bases if
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:37.447]  The North Korean dictator every year or so isn't shooting ICBMs over their country that land a few miles off their coast, threatening to nuke them.
[02:29:37.447 --> 02:29:46.214]  We'll explain this when we come back, then get into the political realignment worldwide, a bunch of economic news, a smattering of other key info, and then your phone calls and a guest coming up.
[02:29:46.214 --> 02:29:51.538]  But this is important, so I'm going over the backstory first.
[02:29:51.538 --> 02:29:52.940]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:54.461]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.465 --> 02:30:00.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.866 --> 02:30:02.167]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.167 --> 02:30:07.768]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:30:07.768 --> 02:30:12.790]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:17.811]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:30:18.351 --> 02:30:23.572]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:30:45.039 --> 02:30:48.481]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:30:48.481 --> 02:30:50.242]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:01.155 --> 02:31:04.176]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.176 --> 02:31:09.497]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.497 --> 02:31:11.538]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.538 --> 02:31:16.539]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.539 --> 02:31:17.720]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:18.460]  When do you want it?
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:20.722]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.722 --> 02:31:21.803]  When will you need it?
[02:31:21.803 --> 02:31:24.006]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.006 --> 02:31:25.347]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.347 --> 02:31:26.869]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:26.869 --> 02:31:32.154]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.154 --> 02:31:35.738]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.738 --> 02:31:39.202]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.542 --> 02:31:40.763]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.763 --> 02:31:41.664]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.664 --> 02:31:42.766]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.766 --> 02:31:43.707]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.707 --> 02:31:44.808]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.808 --> 02:31:47.851]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:47.851 --> 02:31:49.633]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:49.633 --> 02:31:50.554]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:01.571]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.571 --> 02:32:07.153]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.153 --> 02:32:12.175]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.175 --> 02:32:17.217]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:17.757 --> 02:32:22.981]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:22.981 --> 02:32:25.282]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:32:25.282 --> 02:32:30.085]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.085 --> 02:32:31.206]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.206 --> 02:32:34.288]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:34.288 --> 02:32:37.911]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:37.911 --> 02:32:41.093]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:41.093 --> 02:32:43.314]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:43.314 --> 02:32:44.235]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:47.877 --> 02:32:50.838]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:50.838 --> 02:32:56.940]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:56.940 --> 02:32:59.340]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:18.345 --> 02:33:24.970]  So what's outrageous about all this is, they know you're naive, but not just naive, gullible.
[02:33:24.970 --> 02:33:31.636]  You don't want to believe the government's growing the opium and the cocaine, the coca, and controlling who can ship it in.
[02:33:31.636 --> 02:33:36.860]  You don't want to believe DynCorp's been caught in Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:41.264]  Even when it comes out in the Houston Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:33:43.038 --> 02:33:50.660]  You don't want to believe that the government funded the communist and Hitler before that, even though it's declassified in public.
[02:33:50.660 --> 02:34:03.182]  You don't want to believe that our government put the North Koreans in power and put Ho Chi Minh, who was admittedly OSS, in power and worked with the OSS during World War II.
[02:34:03.182 --> 02:34:07.083]  You don't want to admit it because it's so diabolical.
[02:34:08.237 --> 02:34:09.718]  But it's all on record.
[02:34:09.718 --> 02:34:14.182]  And now, because the information age, they go, okay, yeah, we put the commies in power.
[02:34:14.182 --> 02:34:15.383]  Yeah, we're growing opium.
[02:34:15.383 --> 02:34:17.524]  Yeah, we got CIA aircraft.
[02:34:17.524 --> 02:34:19.266]  We fly people out that are to be tortured.
[02:34:19.266 --> 02:34:20.847]  We fly cocaine in.
[02:34:20.847 --> 02:34:28.513]  And they have congressional hearings, you know, the CIA solicitor general saying, we did bring all the coke in and we did do it, but we're sorry now.
[02:34:31.641 --> 02:34:35.483]  And so of course they're in the news saying they're getting ready to take more of your pension funds.
[02:34:35.483 --> 02:34:41.407]  Of course they're going to come out and say, we want to put lithium in the water to make you behave yourself on Fox News.
[02:34:41.407 --> 02:34:45.989]  They're just going to come right out and say, you're not going to admit you're in a nightmare.
[02:34:45.989 --> 02:34:55.315]  See, once you buy into corruption and rationalize it by increments, pretty soon those increments add up to really big things you're accepting.
[02:34:58.507 --> 02:35:00.548]  Of course 9-11 is staged!
[02:35:00.548 --> 02:35:02.048]  Of course!
[02:35:02.048 --> 02:35:06.089]  I mean, what idiot looks at the facts and doesn't know it?
[02:35:06.089 --> 02:35:17.132]  Not just the evidence, look at how within 15 minutes of the attack happening, this is a new world order, everything's changed, we've got to attack Iraq, we've got to take all your rights away, and blah blah blah.
[02:35:17.132 --> 02:35:18.813]  The same talking points everywhere.
[02:35:24.224 --> 02:35:26.226]  And then it goes on and on, how the U.S.
[02:35:26.226 --> 02:35:28.888]  troops were already masked to invade the month before.
[02:35:28.888 --> 02:35:30.589]  Bush had already signed the launch order.
[02:35:30.589 --> 02:35:39.856]  They announced Building 7 had fallen exactly how it did fall right before it fell.
[02:35:39.856 --> 02:35:41.137]  On and on and on.
[02:35:41.137 --> 02:35:43.919]  None of us are safe while this continues.
[02:35:43.919 --> 02:35:46.261]  You know how bold these people are?
[02:35:46.261 --> 02:35:49.544]  They could have killed Kennedy, who had health problems with poison in his drink.
[02:35:51.718 --> 02:35:54.380]  They could have killed, you know, any of these people.
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:36:04.689]  No, they wanted to blow his head off in plain view of hundreds of people and dozens of police with everyone seeing the men behind the Grassy Knoll firing.
[02:36:04.689 --> 02:36:11.995]  They did that as a public execution at high noon to let you know we run things now.
[02:36:11.995 --> 02:36:17.980]  Look, at the end of World War II, 22,000, this is on record,
[02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.649]  I think?
[02:36:34.264 --> 02:36:38.105]  Didn't want to have a PR problem, they just said, keep them!
[02:36:38.105 --> 02:36:42.007]  22,000 troops don't mean jack diddly squat.
[02:36:42.007 --> 02:36:51.930]  Now, if 22,000 troops don't mean jack diddly squat for the people that ran our government in 1945, who do you think's running things now?
[02:36:51.930 --> 02:36:59.733]  Because the way corruption works is it always gets worse until it's brought fully to heel.
[02:36:59.733 --> 02:37:01.714]  What do you think's going to happen, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:37:03.302 --> 02:37:06.505]  Do you think any of you are safe?
[02:37:06.505 --> 02:37:08.587]  See, that's the big mind trick.
[02:37:08.587 --> 02:37:12.250]  That's the big game.
[02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:17.094]  Is that people think they're safe by cowering and by going along with corruption.
[02:37:17.094 --> 02:37:26.162]  They think the safe path is not speaking up, not popping your head up above the grass, just going along to get along.
[02:37:26.162 --> 02:37:30.166]  When you have a nation of castrated, gilded, dumb men,
[02:37:32.739 --> 02:37:33.980]  Because they're more than just cowards.
[02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:36.683]  They're dumb.
[02:37:36.683 --> 02:37:42.488]  Because only a fool thinks you give in to corruption and you somehow get ahead.
[02:37:42.488 --> 02:37:45.030]  No, you become a slave.
[02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:47.873]  And your children become a slave.
[02:37:47.873 --> 02:37:50.535]  And you lose your hopes and your dreams and your future.
[02:37:50.535 --> 02:37:54.839]  And I've said this many times, I'll say it again, you're only alive once, folks.
[02:37:54.839 --> 02:37:56.861]  Now is only now.
[02:37:58.154 --> 02:38:00.136]  And the crossroads we're at.
[02:38:00.136 --> 02:38:03.318]  Going into the future, you're not going to be able to make the right decision later.
[02:38:03.318 --> 02:38:10.404]  You're not going to be able to turn back and wish that when the Republic was on its knees, but still had a fighting chance of getting on its feet.
[02:38:10.404 --> 02:38:14.387]  If we can just get the country on its feet, and right now it's trying to get up.
[02:38:14.387 --> 02:38:23.255]  The Sleeping Giant's awake, and it hadn't walked in decades, and it's trying to get up, trying to get out there.
[02:38:24.457 --> 02:38:35.301]  In therapy, and take a few steps, and every one of us have to give our blood, our sweat, our tears, our soul, our spirit, our very energy.
[02:38:35.301 --> 02:38:39.042]  And by give your soul to it, commit to liberty and freedom.
[02:38:39.042 --> 02:38:39.922]  Give your soul to God.
[02:38:39.922 --> 02:38:42.583]  If you give your soul to God, you're not gonna be able to control yourself.
[02:38:42.583 --> 02:38:50.466]  All you out there that think you're a Christian, or think you're on the side of the light, look, if you're not fighting evil, come on.
[02:38:50.466 --> 02:38:51.646]  Faith without works is dead.
[02:38:54.130 --> 02:39:05.584]  I'm not afraid of dying, I'm not afraid of being destroyed, I'm not afraid of being demonized, I'm not afraid of being tortured, I'm not afraid of them making stuff up about me in the media, coming out and saying Lord knows what.
[02:39:05.584 --> 02:39:09.289]  I'm only afraid of failing.
[02:39:09.289 --> 02:39:10.931]  That's why a lot of days I hate myself.
[02:39:12.142 --> 02:39:17.829]  Because I'll be watching a previous show and I'll think, I should have explained that better or I said that date wrong.
[02:39:17.829 --> 02:39:18.589]  Whatever!
[02:39:18.589 --> 02:39:19.851]  It doesn't matter.
[02:39:19.851 --> 02:39:25.037]  We can't get caught up in the fact that we're not perfect and we don't have all the answers.
[02:39:25.037 --> 02:39:30.803]  We know the globalists are consciously against free humanity and must be dealt with.
[02:39:30.803 --> 02:39:31.845]  And you notice that
[02:39:33.214 --> 02:39:34.355]  Everything's quickening.
[02:39:34.355 --> 02:39:36.057]  Everything's getting more accelerated.
[02:39:36.057 --> 02:39:39.120]  Everything's getting more intense by the millisecond.
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:46.026]  And that's because everything is starting to come to a head right now.
[02:39:46.026 --> 02:39:52.653]  Just like before World War I and World War II, which we now know were orchestrated by the British Empire.
[02:39:52.653 --> 02:39:57.337]  And the modern British Empire is the Anglo-American New World Order slash
[02:39:58.154 --> 02:40:01.236]  You know, Israeli power arm.
[02:40:01.236 --> 02:40:03.778]  It's all merged, one big group.
[02:40:03.778 --> 02:40:09.502]  You can't say which head of the Hydra runs the Hydra, because it's all part of the same creature.
[02:40:09.502 --> 02:40:16.147]  One head of the Hydra is just as guilty as the other head of the Hydra.
[02:40:16.147 --> 02:40:19.209]  And the Hydra will destroy people who aren't good.
[02:40:19.209 --> 02:40:21.611]  It'll destroy people who are good.
[02:40:21.611 --> 02:40:23.252]  The point is, it's the big Hydra.
[02:40:23.252 --> 02:40:24.493]  It's the big dragon.
[02:40:24.493 --> 02:40:25.414]  It's the big monster.
[02:40:27.742 --> 02:40:34.728]  But it'll saddle up beside some other petty tyranny and say, look, I'm better than that tyranny, join me the dragon.
[02:40:34.728 --> 02:40:36.129]  That's its trick.
[02:40:36.129 --> 02:40:50.682]  To the point of it created the Nazis, it created the Soviets, it created all of these enemies, so it could menace you with those enemies, so it could have its war.
[02:40:50.682 --> 02:40:55.066]  I mean, it goes back to the Rothschilds and others funding both sides of any war.
[02:40:57.796 --> 02:40:59.119]  That way they always win!
[02:40:59.119 --> 02:41:04.789]  And then it's elementary to understand that
[02:41:07.503 --> 02:41:16.809]  Kim Jong-il is a pea in a pod with the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the Dutch royalty and the British royalty and these elites.
[02:41:16.809 --> 02:41:17.990]  He wears a jumpsuit.
[02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:19.611]  He's got cameras watching people.
[02:41:19.611 --> 02:41:21.212]  He's got slave camps.
[02:41:21.212 --> 02:41:23.114]  He's what the globalists want.
[02:41:23.114 --> 02:41:26.056]  They let men and women together one day a year to breed.
[02:41:26.056 --> 02:41:30.679]  They take the babies away the way you take eggs away from a chicken.
[02:41:30.679 --> 02:41:32.980]  There's no such thing as family there.
[02:41:32.980 --> 02:41:33.821]  They are the model.
[02:41:36.522 --> 02:41:42.085]  And that's why our government gave them weapons systems, and that's why our government gave them nukes.
[02:41:42.085 --> 02:41:44.966]  And because they like them.
[02:41:44.966 --> 02:41:47.407]  The globalists don't like Iran.
[02:41:47.407 --> 02:41:50.089]  They're pro-family and they got their own problems.
[02:41:50.089 --> 02:41:59.313]  But they're pro-family, they're pro-sovereignty, they're pro-free market, and they hate the New World Order, folks.
[02:41:59.313 --> 02:42:04.796]  You know, you don't have people taking people's kids and raising them in government brainwashing camps.
[02:42:06.363 --> 02:42:09.745]  They've got their own form of tribal brainwashing, but everybody does.
[02:42:09.745 --> 02:42:13.747]  I mean, the issue is, we know why they're going up against Iran, okay?
[02:42:13.747 --> 02:42:25.913]  Because once they've got that country, they've got from Turkey all the way to Pakistan, they've got that whole area controlled to continue their operations.
[02:42:25.913 --> 02:42:34.357]  And so now, notice as the world goes into financial collapse, as we go into this crisis,
[02:42:35.566 --> 02:42:42.628]  And the government starts demonizing domestic groups ahead of staged terror attacks here to be blamed on us.
[02:42:42.628 --> 02:42:50.571]  Simultaneously, North Korea launches torpedo attacks on ships in international waters.
[02:42:50.571 --> 02:42:53.072]  Starts threatening to attack the South.
[02:42:53.072 --> 02:42:56.653]  That forces the South Korean government that have been talking about making U.S.
[02:42:56.653 --> 02:43:01.795]  forces go home, suddenly have to talk about war.
[02:43:01.795 --> 02:43:02.975]  They never had a peace treaty.
[02:43:02.975 --> 02:43:05.056]  There's just been a ceasefire for 50 plus years.
[02:43:08.877 --> 02:43:33.387]  And we are now right up to the point of open World War III starting with Iran, with North Korea, with Pakistan who has nukes, and you look at all three cases, Pakistan giving nukes by the West, North Korea giving nukes by the West, Iran not giving nukes by the West.
[02:43:33.387 --> 02:43:34.908]  Nowhere near to getting a nuke.
[02:43:36.581 --> 02:43:44.286]  They're being picked off because they don't have nukes, and because they have not been chosen to menace their neighbors.
[02:43:44.286 --> 02:43:50.449]  Because Iran hasn't made a deal with the globalists.
[02:43:50.449 --> 02:44:02.737]  And if you go back and really study the history, not only did the Persians, under Mohammed Mosaddegh, who was secular, kick out the Muslim extremists the British and CIA had brought in,
[02:44:04.246 --> 02:44:08.390]  But he was going to use the oil money for the Iranian people to become a first world nation.
[02:44:08.390 --> 02:44:16.077]  Now once he got kicked out, the Shah started double-crossing him, as Tarpley talked about, in the late 70s.
[02:44:16.077 --> 02:44:22.063]  So they planned to bring in their CIA-controlled Ayatollah Khomeini into the country.
[02:44:23.291 --> 02:44:29.833]  And that's why they had arms for hostages deals and all that stuff you saw and then they double-crossed the West again.
[02:44:29.833 --> 02:44:32.534]  It's on record they brought the Ayatollah Khomeini in.
[02:44:32.534 --> 02:44:34.094]  It's on record they supported him.
[02:44:34.094 --> 02:44:36.295]  This is how this stuff works.
[02:44:36.295 --> 02:44:38.796]  And in hindsight it's all on record.
[02:44:38.796 --> 02:44:45.378]  So that's why they hate Iran so much is they've double-crossed him repeatedly.
[02:44:45.378 --> 02:44:45.818]  And so
[02:44:47.365 --> 02:44:50.766]  We've said it over and over again, the globalists have to have a war.
[02:44:50.766 --> 02:45:04.032]  They are politically in so much trouble now, the only way they're going to kickstart their global government and their banking takeover is to create crises that make us as humans gather around.
[02:45:04.032 --> 02:45:16.077]  You go back 3,000 years ago, let's say where Berlin is today, in Germania, and you may not like your Chief Hrothgar, or whatever his name is,
[02:45:17.478 --> 02:45:36.356]  Or your Chief Alaric, whatever Vandal or Visigoth name he's got, and he may do bad things to you, but when the neighboring tribe comes pouring up over the hill and across the
[02:45:37.569 --> 02:45:46.896]  across the valley and starts coming across the river, you're going to forget how much you don't like Rothgar, and you're going to mount up and get ready for war to defend your family.
[02:45:46.896 --> 02:45:47.937]  And it's the same thing.
[02:45:47.937 --> 02:45:50.259]  They understand human psychology.
[02:45:50.259 --> 02:45:58.445]  As much of a civilization as we've built, we are still just tribal creatures.
[02:45:58.445 --> 02:46:03.950]  And the globalists understand psychology, and they know how to manipulate us.
[02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:05.291]  And they understand these tricks.
[02:46:06.809 --> 02:46:11.779]  And so if you've just won World War II with the Soviets, and the Soviets are fully U.S.
[02:46:11.779 --> 02:46:15.025]  funded, on record, 1970, funded by the U.S.
[02:46:15.025 --> 02:46:18.231]  and British government, on record, to overthrow the Tsar.
[02:46:21.348 --> 02:46:22.990]  What are you going to do?
[02:46:22.990 --> 02:46:28.355]  You've just divided Europe up with the Soviets and you go, how do we invade more countries?
[02:46:28.355 --> 02:46:28.995]  This is great.
[02:46:28.995 --> 02:46:30.497]  How do we now have an empire?
[02:46:30.497 --> 02:46:34.300]  Well, we act like we're opposing each other and we have proxy wars all over the planet.
[02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:35.982]  You take half, we take half.
[02:46:35.982 --> 02:46:37.984]  That's what me and Hitler did, Stalin said.
[02:46:37.984 --> 02:46:39.465]  This is on record now.
[02:46:39.465 --> 02:46:40.286]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[02:46:40.286 --> 02:46:40.767]  Sounds great.
[02:46:42.617 --> 02:46:44.759]  And if our government would just write off 22,000 U.S.
[02:46:44.759 --> 02:46:57.791]  troops because it was easy, or would just openly talk about committing half of Europe over to Soviet tyranny, the Soviets had already killed at least 40 million people up until that time, your life means nothing here in America.
[02:46:58.715 --> 02:47:02.338]  The only issue is you have a history of guns, a history of the Second Amendment.
[02:47:02.338 --> 02:47:06.782]  And that's why they said, well, we've launched this Soviet takeover operation worldwide.
[02:47:06.782 --> 02:47:07.323]  What are we going to do?
[02:47:07.323 --> 02:47:09.585]  The American people have got all these guns.
[02:47:09.585 --> 02:47:17.952]  Well, they'll give up most of their rights in the name of fighting communists, while we incrementally set up wealth redistribution and get them domesticated.
[02:47:17.952 --> 02:47:24.318]  Later, this is all in the RAND Corporation documents, Club of Rome documents, CFR documents, you know, the merger.
[02:47:25.896 --> 02:47:30.819]  We had Bilderberg Group documents, what the Tucker got a year and a half before the Berlin Wall was brought down.
[02:47:30.819 --> 02:47:34.961]  That was all staged.
[02:47:34.961 --> 02:47:39.584]  And they said that we'll get them to give their rights up in the name of fighting communists.
[02:47:41.189 --> 02:47:48.992]  But then at the key point, we'll say communism doesn't exist when we actually set up communism here domestically, and we're just going to merge all these countries together.
[02:47:48.992 --> 02:47:54.493]  Then we'll use the US, Europe, and China to mop up the rest of the planet.
[02:47:54.493 --> 02:47:59.555]  But things don't always go the way the New World Order wants.
[02:47:59.555 --> 02:48:05.277]  The Russians are as crooked as a barrel of snakes, but they're old corruption, old evil.
[02:48:06.989 --> 02:48:08.150]  And they want to survive.
[02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:09.931]  They have a Russian identity.
[02:48:09.931 --> 02:48:11.873]  They still have a culture.
[02:48:11.873 --> 02:48:19.259]  They're paying their people for over a decade to have babies, because they've lost over 30 million of their people through eugenics.
[02:48:19.259 --> 02:48:22.742]  They're openly talking about the New World Order, and they want their own system.
[02:48:23.795 --> 02:48:37.400]  And if you look at the splits, and Brzezinski talks about this, China is more allied with Europe and the US, Russia is that wild card, and it's still engaged with the globalists, it's still interfacing.
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:42.882]  But, going back over the last decade, Vladimir Putin arrested all the oligarchs.
[02:48:42.882 --> 02:48:46.883]  Every time they got arrested, it turned out they were CIA fronts or Rothschild fronts.
[02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:47.703]  That was in the news.
[02:48:47.703 --> 02:48:49.384]  You know, he would seize a company,
[02:48:51.417 --> 02:48:54.099]  And it would turn out, oh, doesn't matter, the assets are already in Europe.
[02:48:54.099 --> 02:48:56.581]  They're already in England.
[02:48:56.581 --> 02:49:00.223]  And so those are all the different power blocks out there.
[02:49:00.223 --> 02:49:03.826]  And there may be a deal later with the Russians to double-cross China again.
[02:49:03.826 --> 02:49:06.768]  I mean, there's no honor amongst these people.
[02:49:08.126 --> 02:49:10.788]  And so now, we stand at the precipice.
[02:49:10.788 --> 02:49:10.928]  U.S.
[02:49:10.928 --> 02:49:19.994]  military told, get ready, in Korean standoff, Obama orders commanders to prepare to deter further aggression with military operations.
[02:49:19.994 --> 02:49:25.378]  South Korea threatens war if North Korea makes one more provocation.
[02:49:25.378 --> 02:49:31.021]  They've said, if you enter our territorial waters, our airspace, our territory, we will respond militarily.
[02:49:31.021 --> 02:49:33.203]  So, this could start any time
[02:49:34.537 --> 02:49:49.341]  And notice, right as the banks are in trouble, right as the global government is being formed, right as they're out in the open, suddenly, we've got to attack Iran, suddenly, North Korea is out there engaging provocations.
[02:49:49.341 --> 02:49:51.382]  And publicly stating provocations.
[02:49:51.382 --> 02:49:55.643]  I mean, this isn't a false flag all the evidence shows on North Korea because this is their posture.
[02:49:55.643 --> 02:49:58.023]  This is what they want.
[02:49:58.023 --> 02:50:03.625]  And there's no doubt Kim Jong-il is liaisoning
[02:50:05.572 --> 02:50:10.155]  Through the Chinese, and this is all a rigged game.
[02:50:10.155 --> 02:50:14.718]  This is all a ruse to threaten South Korea, to keep U.S.
[02:50:14.718 --> 02:50:18.240]  forces there, and they may even have a military exchange!
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:23.803]  The war may start again!
[02:50:23.803 --> 02:50:26.065]  And you know, there won't be an instant decapitation.
[02:50:28.217 --> 02:50:29.158]  They've done the analysis.
[02:50:29.158 --> 02:50:32.160]  They know the North Koreans want to get out of the slavery.
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:34.161]  No, there won't be a nuking of the Capitol.
[02:50:34.161 --> 02:50:39.265]  There won't be a wiping out of the troops on the front lines.
[02:50:39.265 --> 02:50:42.867]  No, they'll just keep them there because they like North Korea.
[02:50:42.867 --> 02:50:45.209]  They like how Kim Jong-il gets things done.
[02:50:45.209 --> 02:50:48.191]  They like people being total dehumanized slaves.
[02:50:48.191 --> 02:50:52.214]  People running our government liked killing 22,000 of our own vets.
[02:50:52.214 --> 02:50:53.215]  They hate you.
[02:50:53.215 --> 02:50:54.456]  They hate America.
[02:50:54.456 --> 02:50:55.536]  They hate freedom.
[02:50:55.536 --> 02:50:57.518]  They want to make you domesticated animals.
[02:50:58.834 --> 02:51:00.674]  So they're getting ready to really stage some big events.
[02:51:01.772 --> 02:51:04.774]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:51:04.774 --> 02:51:06.836]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:51:06.836 --> 02:51:09.598]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:51:09.598 --> 02:51:11.820]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:13.241]  Okay, here it comes.

[02:51:15.142 --> 02:51:17.063]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:51:17.063 --> 02:51:19.045]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:51:19.045 --> 02:51:22.748]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:51:22.748 --> 02:51:30.493]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[02:51:52.049 --> 02:51:52.330]  It works!
[02:52:03.329 --> 02:52:05.811]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:52:05.811 --> 02:52:07.072]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:07.072 --> 02:52:10.794]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.794 --> 02:52:13.235]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.235 --> 02:52:19.099]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:19.099 --> 02:52:25.323]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.763 --> 02:52:31.725]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.725 --> 02:52:35.926]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.926 --> 02:52:40.208]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:40.208 --> 02:52:46.150]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:49.111]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.711 --> 02:52:51.672]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.672 --> 02:52:52.813]  It's here.

[02:53:00.939 --> 02:53:02.079]  Fatigue.
[02:53:02.079 --> 02:53:03.200]  Headaches.
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:04.561]  Allergies and asthma.
[02:53:04.561 --> 02:53:05.962]  Chronic disease.
[02:53:05.962 --> 02:53:07.823]  Is your home making you sick?
[02:53:07.823 --> 02:53:08.744]  Here's a fact.
[02:53:08.744 --> 02:53:16.409]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander and even chemtrail particulates.

[02:54:17.517 --> 02:54:25.582]  The CIA and its allies in control of the United States and the world, The Secret Team, by Fletcher Prouty.
[02:54:25.582 --> 02:54:27.544]  Colonel Prouty.
[02:54:27.544 --> 02:54:34.908]  This is the book the CIA does not want you to read, available at Infowars.com.
[02:54:34.908 --> 02:54:36.850]  The head of Black Ops for the Pentagon,
[02:54:38.507 --> 02:54:41.128]  For nine years.
[02:54:41.128 --> 02:54:44.610]  Of course, 25 years in the Air Force.
[02:54:44.610 --> 02:54:46.191]  Very important book.
[02:54:46.191 --> 02:54:48.972]  Available at Infowars.com, now back in print.
[02:54:48.972 --> 02:54:50.973]  Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined.
[02:54:50.973 --> 02:54:57.236]  And of course, Don't Tread on Me, dealing with a way to take the country back at the state level.
[02:54:57.236 --> 02:55:01.958]  Okay, I meant to get into the massive political awakening and realignment that's happened.
[02:55:05.202 --> 02:55:07.303]  And that's why the globalists have to launch World War III.
[02:55:07.303 --> 02:55:09.964]  That's why they've got to start giant crises.
[02:55:09.964 --> 02:55:13.605]  Because Merkel has lost the parliamentary elections.
[02:55:13.605 --> 02:55:16.026]  They have those in phases in Germany.
[02:55:16.026 --> 02:55:19.268]  So next time there's an election, she's going to be out of office.
[02:55:19.268 --> 02:55:21.689]  Sarkozy lost his parliamentary elections.
[02:55:21.689 --> 02:55:24.130]  It's barely hanging on.
[02:55:24.130 --> 02:55:26.691]  Gordon Brown lost and is now gone.
[02:55:26.691 --> 02:55:29.132]  A new puppet's in.
[02:55:29.132 --> 02:55:31.913]  In Hawaii, the first Republican elected to the Congress.
[02:55:35.205 --> 02:55:35.345]  Yeah.
[02:55:50.089 --> 02:55:56.970]  In Kentucky, you see the same thing with an anti-establishment Democrat beating Specter in the primary.
[02:55:56.970 --> 02:56:07.533]  Same thing, anti-establishment Democrat coming from nowhere, trouncing the establishment Democrat in Colorado over the weekend.
[02:56:07.533 --> 02:56:11.814]  People just go in and say, okay, who's the media telling me I should vote for?
[02:56:11.814 --> 02:56:13.574]  I'm going to vote for the opposite person.
[02:56:17.717 --> 02:56:19.418]  And that really threatens the system.
[02:56:19.418 --> 02:56:21.220]  That threatens the shadow government.
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:24.302]  Because they got a bunch of puppets in Congress that'll do whatever they're told.
[02:56:24.302 --> 02:56:34.930]  So all over the world, people are resisting these governments that have become vassals, or tools, or minions of the offshore banks.
[02:56:36.596 --> 02:56:39.337]  What did Brzezinski talk about last week to the CFR?
[02:56:39.337 --> 02:56:44.578]  For the first time in history, the entire world is awake to our world government.
[02:56:44.578 --> 02:56:47.139]  We have never been in a crisis this great.
[02:56:47.139 --> 02:56:49.820]  They are fully aware of us and our operations.
[02:56:49.820 --> 02:56:56.742]  This makes it very hard for us to continue the expansion of global governance.
[02:56:56.742 --> 02:57:02.203]  That's basically what he says.
[02:57:02.203 --> 02:57:03.364]  And so, what do they do?
[02:57:03.364 --> 02:57:04.264]  They don't play games.
[02:57:05.899 --> 02:57:10.300]  I mean, they grow opium and... ship it into the country publicly.
[02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:11.660]  They ship the cocaine in publicly.
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:13.500]  They don't care!
[02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:14.040]  Shut up!
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.621]  So some of you know we bring it in!
[02:57:16.621 --> 02:57:18.021]  You pathetic scum!
[02:57:18.021 --> 02:57:19.601]  Soon we have world government in place.
[02:57:19.601 --> 02:57:20.922]  We eliminate you all!
[02:57:20.922 --> 02:57:21.442]  Hehehe!
[02:57:21.442 --> 02:57:25.362]  I mean, I mean, you know, the... These guys are very... They love it!
[02:57:25.362 --> 02:57:33.104]  They love to get up and publicly tell us what they're going to do to us, yeah!
[02:57:33.104 --> 02:57:33.904]  They enjoy it!
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:39.140]  Well, I think more of people.
[02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:39.941]  I think we're men.
[02:57:39.941 --> 02:57:43.422]  I think we're going to wake up to all their tricks and their games.
[02:57:43.422 --> 02:57:47.784]  Yeah, we weren't paying attention before, but we are now.
[02:57:47.784 --> 02:58:02.291]  And so I'm going to tell you right now, folks, since the end of the official war with North Korea, we've never been in more danger on the peninsula.
[02:58:02.291 --> 02:58:04.452]  And we've never had a bigger danger with Iran.
[02:58:05.769 --> 02:58:07.170]  Or staged terror attacks.
[02:58:07.170 --> 02:58:14.132]  You know, the globalists are going to start wars and stage terror attacks to go after all their enemies.
[02:58:14.132 --> 02:58:20.834]  And you see all the preconditioning leading up to domestic terror attacks.
[02:58:20.834 --> 02:58:22.875]  Pro-gun groups are working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:22.875 --> 02:58:24.315]  I know, isn't that horrible?
[02:58:24.315 --> 02:58:26.836]  Those darn gun owners working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:26.836 --> 02:58:28.937]  We better get rid of the Second Amendment.
[02:58:28.937 --> 02:58:31.198]  Yeah, I'm not about to let Al-Qaeda do that to me.
[02:58:32.674 --> 02:58:37.037]  Yeah, those darn ranchers and farmers won't give their land up.
[02:58:37.037 --> 02:58:39.018]  They're American Al Qaeda too!
[02:58:39.018 --> 02:58:39.899]  We gotta stomp them!
[02:58:39.899 --> 02:58:44.182]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.861 --> 02:58:56.822]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:56.822 --> 02:59:05.684]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:05.684 --> 02:59:10.325]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:10.325 --> 02:59:21.127]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:21.767 --> 02:59:31.289]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:31.289 --> 02:59:36.711]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:36.711 --> 02:59:44.192]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:44.192 --> 02:59:46.953]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:59:54.088 --> 02:59:56.470]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:59:56.470 --> 03:00:04.316]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:04.316 --> 03:00:15.604]  Alright, we're back live.
[03:00:15.604 --> 03:00:17.646]  We're now into our number four.
[03:00:17.646 --> 03:00:18.787]  We have a guest coming up.
[03:00:22.304 --> 03:00:29.067]  I will intersperse some financial news and some treason news coming up during this interview.
[03:00:29.067 --> 03:00:31.909]  Very important treason news coming up.
[03:00:31.909 --> 03:00:35.891]  But right now, let's jam a few more phone calls in here.
[03:00:35.891 --> 03:00:38.452]  Up next is Michael in Colorado.
[03:00:38.452 --> 03:00:42.053]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:42.053 --> 03:00:43.394]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:43.394 --> 03:00:45.475]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:45.475 --> 03:00:48.557]  To do with what you were saying, like how they
[03:00:49.773 --> 03:00:54.454]  Put things in front of our face before they execute the attack.
[03:00:54.454 --> 03:00:59.956]  Like last year, I was watching Discovery and it was a show about like ice ages, right?
[03:00:59.956 --> 03:01:10.459]  So they get to this thing where they have all these scientists talking about the ice age and how they're actually talking about how there's an ice age coming instead of global warming, but that's not the point.
[03:01:10.459 --> 03:01:12.239]  They were working on these satellites, right?
[03:01:12.239 --> 03:01:14.000]  With these reflectors.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.981]  And they were saying that with like four or five of these lights pointed at one spot,
[03:01:19.642 --> 03:01:20.923]  Well, I know this.
[03:01:42.904 --> 03:01:52.930]  Now the UN is saying they're worried about global freezing, and we're supposed to forget about all their fake global warming, and they're teaching school kids we must stabilize the climate.
[03:01:52.930 --> 03:01:55.151]  The climate is always unstable.
[03:01:55.151 --> 03:01:59.113]  I mean, they're even trying to blame volcanoes on global warming now.
[03:01:59.113 --> 03:02:01.874]  I mean, I joked about that a few weeks ago about the Iceland volcano.
[03:02:03.015 --> 03:02:09.436]  They're now in the news saying, oh yes, thawing glaciers reduced pressure on the volcano.
[03:02:09.436 --> 03:02:11.377]  That has nothing to do with it.
[03:02:11.377 --> 03:02:16.658]  And, by the way, glaciers worldwide in the last three years have been getting bigger!
[03:02:16.658 --> 03:02:20.979]  So, I mean, they say the Haitian earthquake was caused by global warming.
[03:02:20.979 --> 03:02:26.060]  They say the Chilean earthquake was caused by it.
[03:02:26.060 --> 03:02:28.881]  Because they know the public is kind of halfway paying attention.
[03:02:30.013 --> 03:02:31.154]  Oh, you better pay Al Gore?
[03:02:31.154 --> 03:02:36.619]  But meanwhile, Al Gore says he believes that the sea levels are going to rise in the next ten years and flood all the major cities.
[03:02:36.619 --> 03:02:40.782]  He's bought two mansions on waterfront property.
[03:02:40.782 --> 03:02:42.684]  It's just made-up fraud!
[03:02:42.684 --> 03:02:53.793]  He got this big, demonic, fat, lying piece of trash that told us naphtha and gout was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, and then he's up there saying, pay him money,
[03:02:55.134 --> 03:02:56.315]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[03:03:18.544 --> 03:03:23.886]  Good, and I hope you hear the word thank you enough every day, every week, because you're certainly doing a lot for our country.
[03:03:23.886 --> 03:03:24.947]  Well, I appreciate you, buddy.
[03:03:24.947 --> 03:03:26.067]  I'm just trying to save my family.
[03:03:26.067 --> 03:03:27.067]  Go ahead.
[03:03:27.067 --> 03:03:29.728]  Me too, and I have a 10-year-old son, so I hear that.
[03:03:29.728 --> 03:03:37.932]  But I'm a musician, actually a conservative libertarian musician living in Boston, so you can see how that works out for me here in liberal Boston.
[03:03:37.932 --> 03:03:43.194]  But actually, Bob Chapman sent you a song that I wrote called Freedom.
[03:03:43.194 --> 03:03:44.874]  I was on a radio program with him.
[03:03:44.874 --> 03:03:46.535]  I'm not sure if you heard the song at all.
[03:03:48.174 --> 03:03:50.316]  You know, it does ring a bell.
[03:03:50.316 --> 03:03:53.938]  I mean, I've heard so much good music, I'll have to go pull it up.
[03:03:53.938 --> 03:03:55.039]  Is it on YouTube?
[03:03:55.039 --> 03:04:01.524]  Yeah, it's on YouTube, and you can look up, I think April 28th, Bob sent you the email with the YouTube link.
[03:04:01.524 --> 03:04:10.731]  But I wanted to, you know, if you ever want to use that song for any of your movies, free of charge, I just want to be part of the cause, and, you know... What's the name of this song on YouTube?
[03:04:10.731 --> 03:04:12.312]  It's called Freedom.
[03:04:12.312 --> 03:04:14.173]  Probably a lot of stuff under Freedom, isn't it?
[03:04:14.173 --> 03:04:16.335]  Yeah, look up Chris Ross, Freedom.
[03:04:16.335 --> 03:04:17.436]  Okay, good, we'll check it out.
[03:04:18.295 --> 03:04:21.258]  By the way, I looked up American Spectator, and I had the quote.
[03:04:21.258 --> 03:04:24.640]  I'm not sure if anyone... What, by Rand Paul?
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:25.381]  Yeah.
[03:04:25.381 --> 03:04:26.922]  Yeah, give us the quote.
[03:04:26.922 --> 03:04:31.706]  He basically just said, as a United States Senator, I would never vote to condemn Israel for defending herself.
[03:04:31.706 --> 03:04:33.868]  And that's it.
[03:04:33.868 --> 03:04:39.432]  Well, yeah, and I mean, if Israel gets attacked, then they have a right to defend themselves.
[03:04:40.638 --> 03:04:42.679]  So how is that?
[03:04:42.679 --> 03:04:45.380]  You've got the left media, you've got the right-wing media.
[03:04:45.380 --> 03:04:49.142]  They're all establishment incumbents attacking Rand Paul.
[03:04:49.142 --> 03:04:50.643]  What does that tell you about him?
[03:04:50.643 --> 03:04:56.425]  I mean, when you've got the entire fake political spectrum attacking him, you know he's good.
[03:04:56.425 --> 03:04:57.706]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.706 --> 03:04:58.126]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.447 --> 03:05:05.250]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:05:05.250 --> 03:05:11.654]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:05:11.654 --> 03:05:15.557]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[03:05:15.737 --> 03:05:16.137]  We're good to go.
[03:05:36.827 --> 03:05:43.592]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:05:43.592 --> 03:05:47.495]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:05:47.495 --> 03:05:53.580]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[03:05:53.580 --> 03:05:53.880]  Thank you.
[03:05:53.880 --> 03:05:59.044]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:06:04.988 --> 03:06:06.249]  Tyranny is here.
[03:06:06.249 --> 03:06:09.972]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:06:09.972 --> 03:06:12.414]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:06:12.414 --> 03:06:18.279]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:06:18.279 --> 03:06:24.524]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:06:24.944 --> 03:06:30.927]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:06:30.927 --> 03:06:35.108]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:06:35.108 --> 03:06:39.390]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:06:39.390 --> 03:06:45.332]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:06:45.332 --> 03:06:48.894]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:06:48.894 --> 03:06:50.855]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:06:50.855 --> 03:06:51.295]  It's here.

[03:07:07.764 --> 03:07:12.906]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:07:12.906 --> 03:07:19.570]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:07:21.616 --> 03:07:37.783]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gusset's got it

[03:07:58.303 --> 03:07:58.783]  Others don't.
[03:08:03.007 --> 03:08:09.633]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.633 --> 03:08:13.697]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.697 --> 03:08:16.860]  Christopher C. Horner is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:21.545]  He serves as a senior fellow at CEI, Competitive Enterprise Institute.
[03:08:21.545 --> 03:08:23.046]  He's an attorney in Washington, D.C.
[03:08:23.046 --> 03:08:24.147]  Horner is representative at CEI.
[03:08:25.717 --> 03:08:27.777]  As well as scientist and members of the U.S.
[03:08:27.777 --> 03:08:32.899]  House and Senate on matters of environmental policy in the federal courts, including the Supreme Court.
[03:08:32.899 --> 03:08:50.542]  He has written on numerous topics and publications, ranging from law reviews to legal and industrial trade journals, to print and online opinion pages, and is the author of the two best-selling books, Red Hot Lies, How Global Warming Alarmists Use Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed.
[03:08:50.542 --> 03:08:52.683]  Greenpeace has repeatedly targeted Mr. Horner
[03:08:53.363 --> 03:09:01.669]  By stealing his garbage on a weekly basis, issuing press releases announcing with whom he dines, and including him in various other hysterical publications.
[03:09:01.669 --> 03:09:03.590]  Of course, they're funded by big central banks.
[03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:07.733]  They have a fleet bigger than major governments' fleets.
[03:09:07.733 --> 03:09:08.574]  They want your property.
[03:09:08.574 --> 03:09:11.496]  They want to guilt you into handing everything over to the elite.
[03:09:15.822 --> 03:09:23.552]  His new book is Power Grab, How Obama's Green Police, Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[03:09:23.552 --> 03:09:28.799]  Again, new book, Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[03:09:28.799 --> 03:09:29.419]  And folks,
[03:09:30.501 --> 03:09:35.323]  My issue here is rhetoric cannot describe how bad they are.
[03:09:35.323 --> 03:09:38.824]  I mean, you watch Audi commercials like Green Police.
[03:09:38.824 --> 03:09:42.445]  That's actually what they're doing in Europe and what they have planned here.
[03:09:42.445 --> 03:09:44.265]  This has nothing to do with the environment.
[03:09:44.265 --> 03:09:49.347]  It's a bunch of control freaks running your life, controlling every facet of it.
[03:09:50.933 --> 03:09:52.914]  They know global warming's a fraud.
[03:09:52.914 --> 03:09:56.675]  They've already moved on to other scaremongering.
[03:09:56.675 --> 03:09:58.216]  And they're not going to stop.
[03:09:58.216 --> 03:10:02.477]  And they've said, even if the Senate won't pass this legislation, they don't care.
[03:10:02.477 --> 03:10:05.138]  They're going to have the executive branch implement it.
[03:10:05.138 --> 03:10:07.739]  So, if they are successful, it's over.
[03:10:08.399 --> 03:10:08.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:10:32.483 --> 03:10:33.624]  So much is going on.
[03:10:33.624 --> 03:10:49.993]  Let's get into, since we had you on two or three months ago, what's happened with the power grab, the fake environmental movement, and what new heads the Hydra has sprouted, and where all this is going.
[03:10:49.993 --> 03:10:55.255]  Okay, so about 11 months ago, the House passed this cap-and-trade bill.
[03:10:55.255 --> 03:10:57.177]  It was about 1,300 pages long, and they
[03:11:00.367 --> 03:11:01.488]  Obviously did not read the bill.
[03:11:01.488 --> 03:11:05.352]  They snuck in 300 more pages of buying votes at 3 a.m.
[03:11:05.352 --> 03:11:08.015]  the morning of the vote.
[03:11:08.015 --> 03:11:10.037]  And folks declared it dead in the Senate.
[03:11:10.037 --> 03:11:11.339]  And then something strange happened.
[03:11:12.106 --> 03:11:23.134]  People did get upset, and they had recently been talking about drill here, drill now, and we're sitting on the world's largest energy reserves, and the real national security issue is refusing to tap your domestic energy resources.
[03:11:23.134 --> 03:11:26.097]  We won't pass an energy rationing scheme, right?
[03:11:26.097 --> 03:11:35.524]  Well, about two and a half weeks ago, three weeks ago, Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, openly said to Washington Papers, Politico and I think The Hill,
[03:11:36.371 --> 03:11:44.515]  That he was going to suspend the committee process in the Senate in order to cramp cap-and-trade down, but they decided they wouldn't call it cap-and-trade.
[03:11:44.515 --> 03:11:51.638]  Reid said, several people said things that are very important, there are four people, Harry Reid, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, and Lindy Graham.
[03:11:51.638 --> 03:11:58.301]  Harry Reid said, well, this would entail the jurisdiction of almost every Senate committee, now pause and stop, why?
[03:11:58.965 --> 03:12:04.548]  Because it impacts almost every aspect of your life, including the Senate Finance Committee, which writes the tax law.
[03:12:04.548 --> 03:12:06.929]  It's the biggest tax increase in our history, and so on.
[03:12:06.929 --> 03:12:11.912]  Reid said, therefore, obviously the four dears would just get confused, he's going to write the bill.
[03:12:11.912 --> 03:12:20.596]  And he began bringing in constituencies, and that means not your listeners, by the way, it means even the chamber and API and green pressure groups.
[03:12:20.596 --> 03:12:23.918]  And he asked them, what do you need in order to support this bill?
[03:12:24.821 --> 03:12:31.565]  And he asked the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, what do you need to not run those television ads?
[03:12:31.565 --> 03:12:39.069]  Because both groups raised a lot of money to run ads educating voters on this energy tax, unless it gave them what they want.
[03:12:39.855 --> 03:12:48.899]  And so far it appears they probably got what they want, which is essentially a gas tax on top of the light switch tax to funnel money to projects.
[03:12:48.899 --> 03:12:55.041]  And now they're claiming, I've heard them on the news, oh there's a new bill in the Senate to fund the cleanup in the Gulf.
[03:12:55.041 --> 03:13:00.864]  How convenient that this BP spill happened when they're one of the biggest pushers of the carbon tax.
[03:13:00.864 --> 03:13:08.127]  And how convenient they wouldn't put the booms in early in Louisiana and Mississippi and Florida and are letting the oil come in.
[03:13:08.527 --> 03:13:11.688]  Oh, I'm afraid they have to have their taxes now.
[03:13:11.688 --> 03:13:12.509]  Let me tell you something.
[03:13:12.509 --> 03:13:14.510]  I was in a room with BP.
[03:13:14.510 --> 03:13:17.011]  I sat in for a gentleman named Ken Lay.
[03:13:17.011 --> 03:13:25.735]  Thirteen years ago this month, I was, as I've discussed with you, very briefly, I was the Director of Federal Government Relations for a company called Enron.
[03:13:26.514 --> 03:13:32.558]  And my number one priority, I was told, after I took the job, was to get a global warming treaty and a domestic cap and trade scheme.
[03:13:32.558 --> 03:13:37.841]  And the company they developed it with was BP, and they had set up this market with Goldman Sachs.
[03:13:37.841 --> 03:13:39.962]  This does fit very conveniently.
[03:13:39.962 --> 03:13:46.586]  Look, I understand how it fits into the narrative today, but you have to understand, I was the crazy guy on the street corner muttering about this for about
[03:13:47.452 --> 03:13:49.834]  Six years before anybody... Oh, wait a second!
[03:13:49.834 --> 03:13:50.354]  I got it!
[03:13:50.354 --> 03:13:51.835]  It's called rent-seeking.
[03:13:51.835 --> 03:14:03.024]  These businesses trying to make money the old-fashioned way by having their buddies in government agree to take some of their power in return for a guaranteed opposition to competition and a wealth transfer from you and me to them.
[03:14:03.024 --> 03:14:09.229]  So they bought all these uneconomic industries like Enron had the world's largest windmill company they bought on the cheap.
[03:14:09.229 --> 03:14:10.610]  It's now called GE Wind.
[03:14:11.343 --> 03:14:12.603]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[03:14:12.603 --> 03:14:14.704]  BP will pay a billion dollar fine.
[03:14:14.704 --> 03:14:17.824]  They've already made that in increased oil prices.
[03:14:17.824 --> 03:14:21.585]  And then, now they'll get more liability protection from government.
[03:14:21.585 --> 03:14:24.726]  Their competition won't be able to drill in the Gulf.
[03:14:24.726 --> 03:14:29.887]  It's just like FEMA got more power by screwing up what happened in Katrina.
[03:14:29.887 --> 03:14:30.867]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:14:30.867 --> 03:14:37.508]  It's pretty clear that, well, in the public record, that the Green Groups, actually, with whom I met, by the way, that same day, in the same room,
[03:14:38.297 --> 03:14:41.679]  They were groups like Union of Concerned Scientists and the National Resources Defense Council.
[03:14:41.679 --> 03:14:44.421]  They were Baptist and bootlegger coalitions.
[03:14:44.421 --> 03:14:55.147]  The green groups after the BP, after the well exploded, the green groups were shrieking to the White House, don't you dare burn that oil off.
[03:14:55.147 --> 03:14:59.730]  And they screamed about consequences of burning, igniting the oil before it got too well mixed.
[03:14:59.730 --> 03:15:06.074]  Well, as I said actually on a TV show, I think that night, or within a few days, you have to understand something.
[03:15:06.636 --> 03:15:27.409]  I could be as irresponsible as a lot of people were about Bush, and just say, look, the administration, which, by the way, was BP's favorite political candidate over 20 years, as you know, the administration was just taking orders from its Green Group buddies, and they want this to be as bad as it can possibly be, because the damage, while real, is temporary.
[03:15:27.409 --> 03:15:29.610]  The tragedy was the 11 men who lost their lives.
[03:15:30.208 --> 03:15:33.572]  But this is a White House that says never let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:15:33.572 --> 03:15:38.377]  They even engineer crises like claiming a global catastrophe from global warming.
[03:15:38.377 --> 03:15:42.061]  And the Greens, of course, have never made money hand over fist like they have.
[03:15:42.412 --> 03:15:49.514]  And for those that don't know, and for those that don't know, if they would have ignited this within hours, there would be almost zero problem.
[03:15:49.514 --> 03:15:52.514]  Almost all of it would have burned off at the source.
[03:15:52.514 --> 03:15:57.736]  Carbon dioxide would have been put into the atmosphere, you know, much smaller than a volcano.
[03:15:57.736 --> 03:16:07.618]  Would have literally had almost no effect if they would have done what the old-timers did and set that sucker on fire until they figured out a plan to cap it.
[03:16:08.158 --> 03:16:21.730]  And now we know why 35 days later the White House has done everything they can to block this because now they're going to get their carbon taxes that Paul Volcker demands we must have to pay Goldman Sachs their bonuses.
[03:16:21.730 --> 03:16:23.171]  Now they're going to get it.
[03:16:23.171 --> 03:16:25.153]  Let me tell you, okay, so we know what
[03:16:25.842 --> 03:16:29.884]  BP actually did engineer this, and the Greens are biting them as you knew they would.
[03:16:29.884 --> 03:16:31.824]  BP and Enron were in on this from the beginning.
[03:16:31.824 --> 03:16:32.665]  Again, I was in the room.
[03:16:32.665 --> 03:16:34.005]  There's no point denying it.
[03:16:34.005 --> 03:16:36.166]  The Greens did tell the White House, don't burn it off.
[03:16:36.166 --> 03:16:38.267]  We just know the White House said, don't burn it off.
[03:16:38.267 --> 03:16:41.908]  It probably is a co-incidence that they weren't taking their marching orders from the Greens.
[03:16:41.908 --> 03:16:53.073]  But, we know BP has been pushing an agenda that John Kerry said, even after the spill, ironically, he said, I've been working with these companies, BP and Shell, to write this law.
[03:16:53.780 --> 03:17:00.186]  He said this, it's again in the public domain, so Harry Reid said, I'm going to suspend the committee process like with healthcare.
[03:17:00.186 --> 03:17:04.891]  John Kerry said, I'm not going to call this Bill Cap-and-Trade because I don't know what Cap-and-Trade means.
[03:17:04.891 --> 03:17:16.322]  Yes he does, and it has Cap-and-Trade in it, he just said it's mean if you call it that because of course, there's a memo I talk about in PowerGraph written by Stanley Greenberg who was Bill Clinton's pollster.
[03:17:16.846 --> 03:17:23.008]  He conducted some polling, and he said to his client, who are Democratic politicians, you have to do two things.
[03:17:23.008 --> 03:17:28.170]  Stop saying cap and trade and global warming, and start calling it something else, and then it might work.
[03:17:28.170 --> 03:17:30.331]  Don't change your agenda, just call the agenda something else.
[03:17:30.331 --> 03:17:33.952]  Yeah, he called it our deteriorating atmosphere!
[03:17:33.952 --> 03:17:36.993]  Well, he said, here are the catchphrases that I've polled well.
[03:17:36.993 --> 03:17:38.854]  Green jobs and clean energy.
[03:17:38.854 --> 03:17:42.395]  So John Kerry said, I don't want to call it cap and trade, I don't know what cap and trade means.
[03:17:42.395 --> 03:17:45.556]  It's a jobs and national security bill, clean energy, of course of this year.
[03:17:46.438 --> 03:17:52.482]  Joe Lieberman said, oh, I don't want to call it cap and trade because you remember the artist formerly known as Prince?
[03:17:52.482 --> 03:17:54.763]  Well, this is now called pollution emission.
[03:17:54.763 --> 03:17:55.824]  He said that.
[03:17:55.824 --> 03:17:59.806]  This is now called the pollution emission reduction credits or something.
[03:17:59.806 --> 03:18:00.887]  He won't say cap and trade.
[03:18:01.463 --> 03:18:10.410]  Lindsey Graham said two weeks ago, this isn't a global warming bill because global warming no longer exists as a reason to pass legislation.
[03:18:10.410 --> 03:18:11.991]  It's still the same bill.
[03:18:11.991 --> 03:18:13.692]  He still said he'd vote for it.
[03:18:13.692 --> 03:18:14.493]  He just took his name.
[03:18:14.493 --> 03:18:20.297]  He said, I won't be a sponsor because I'll get in all sorts of trouble with my constituents, but I'll still support it.
[03:18:20.297 --> 03:18:22.419]  But it's no longer the reason that it's always been.
[03:18:23.177 --> 03:18:26.261]  The point of all this is where I begin with the book.
[03:18:26.261 --> 03:18:28.864]  Nobody says cap and trade would detectably impact the climate.
[03:18:28.864 --> 03:18:35.232]  I repeat, nobody says the temperature after cap and trade would be any different than it otherwise was going to be.
[03:18:35.232 --> 03:18:36.454]  It's not about the temperature.
[03:18:36.454 --> 03:18:38.496]  It was offered in the name of the temperature.
[03:18:38.496 --> 03:18:39.698]  Their postman told them that their
[03:18:41.463 --> 03:18:46.750]  Of course it's about deciding who can have industry, who can have businesses, and taxing the hell out of us.
[03:18:46.750 --> 03:18:47.190]  Yep.
[03:18:47.190 --> 03:18:49.092]  And in fact, here's what I do.
[03:18:49.092 --> 03:18:53.017]  I begin by pointing out, we know it's not about the climate, so what's it about?
[03:18:53.017 --> 03:18:54.639]  Well, it turns out it's about power.
[03:18:54.639 --> 03:19:00.727]  It turns out that it is about, they can't trust you with your various freedoms that they never thought they could trust you with anyway.
[03:19:01.411 --> 03:19:05.955]  And I've got quotes in here that are out there that, for some reason, nobody's running with.
[03:19:05.955 --> 03:19:06.875]  Carol Browner gave it.
[03:19:06.875 --> 03:19:22.367]  She's the energy and climate czar who had a phony position, that position, created for her because she could never achieve Senate confirmation and she would cause great political havoc, of course, having been a commissioner for the Socialist International, if Obama tried to get her confirmed.
[03:19:22.367 --> 03:19:27.190]  She was put into this phony position to lord over Cabinet officials and she gave an interview to U.S.
[03:19:27.190 --> 03:19:29.112]  News in March of last year in which she said,
[03:19:29.770 --> 03:19:38.612]  It's their objective to get to the point where the electric utilities hold back power from you, so that you'll still be able to cool your home, just not as much as you would like.
[03:19:38.612 --> 03:19:39.932]  Meaning what, Alex?
[03:19:39.932 --> 03:19:41.732]  As much as they would like!
[03:19:41.732 --> 03:19:42.952]  They're admitting it!
[03:19:42.952 --> 03:19:44.112]  Stay there, this is incredible.
[03:19:44.112 --> 03:19:48.453]  Let's come back and talk about the control freak Panopticon.
[03:19:48.453 --> 03:19:52.314]  And Texas, I already had it put into my office that I couldn't say no.
[03:19:52.314 --> 03:19:57.955]  California, they're gonna remote control your thermostat, they're gonna run everything and surveil you.
[03:19:57.955 --> 03:19:59.015]  We'll be back with our guest.
[03:20:02.475 --> 03:20:05.480]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:10.828]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:10.828 --> 03:20:12.872]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:20:12.872 --> 03:20:17.619]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.619 --> 03:20:17.959]  We're good.
[03:20:37.551 --> 03:20:37.791]  We're good.
[03:21:01.636 --> 03:21:03.017]  Are you prepared?
[03:21:03.017 --> 03:21:05.318]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[03:21:05.318 --> 03:21:06.699]  There is a difference.
[03:21:06.699 --> 03:21:12.583]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.

[03:22:03.317 --> 03:22:05.780]  And you're subject to other police action.
[03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:07.041]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:07.041 --> 03:22:10.745]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:10.745 --> 03:22:13.207]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:13.207 --> 03:22:19.093]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:19.093 --> 03:22:25.279]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.737 --> 03:22:31.702]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:31.702 --> 03:22:35.886]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:35.886 --> 03:22:40.189]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:22:40.189 --> 03:22:46.134]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:46.134 --> 03:22:49.037]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:49.678 --> 03:22:51.662]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:51.662 --> 03:22:52.784]  It's here.

[03:23:01.454 --> 03:23:02.495]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:23:02.495 --> 03:23:08.020]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:23:08.020 --> 03:23:08.560]  I get it.
[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:18.188]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:23:18.188 --> 03:23:19.609]  That's not what's happening.
[03:23:19.609 --> 03:23:23.973]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:23:24.173 --> 03:23:26.014]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[03:23:26.014 --> 03:23:28.056]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:23:28.056 --> 03:23:31.458]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:23:31.458 --> 03:23:35.721]  For the realist, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:23:35.721 --> 03:23:37.323]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:23:37.323 --> 03:23:40.725]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:23:40.725 --> 03:23:45.108]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:23:45.108 --> 03:23:46.009]  You should too.
[03:23:46.009 --> 03:23:47.170]  Find out what they know.
[03:23:47.170 --> 03:23:50.412]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:23:50.725 --> 03:23:51.045]  800-686-2237 800-686-2237 That's 800-686-2237
[03:24:02.571 --> 03:24:05.773]  All right, Chris Horner's new book is Power Grab.
[03:24:05.773 --> 03:24:08.275]  I'll tell you how to get that before he leaves us.
[03:24:08.275 --> 03:24:12.519]  Very important info, but all his books are best sellers, so you'll see it all over the place.
[03:24:12.519 --> 03:24:14.340]  And again, I research this constantly.
[03:24:14.340 --> 03:24:16.181]  Everything he's saying is on record.
[03:24:16.181 --> 03:24:17.763]  He's bringing up Carol Browner.
[03:24:17.763 --> 03:24:18.643]  He's going to go over more of these.
[03:24:18.643 --> 03:24:20.525]  Like, we'll control your thermostat.
[03:24:20.525 --> 03:24:21.986]  We'll run your life.
[03:24:21.986 --> 03:24:22.827]  We're your God.
[03:24:23.527 --> 03:24:25.308]  What about Elena Kagan?
[03:24:25.308 --> 03:24:28.550]  Over and over again saying, if we don't like your speech, it's banned.
[03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:31.791]  Or Cass Sunstein, or we're gonna get your guns.
[03:24:31.791 --> 03:24:36.874]  Or the White House science czar, we're gonna put stuff in the water to sterilize you.
[03:24:36.874 --> 03:24:40.616]  I mean, folks, I don't just say this, I have their white papers.
[03:24:40.616 --> 03:24:43.757]  Here's Elena Kagan, University of Chicago Law Review.
[03:24:43.757 --> 03:24:44.878]  I mean, I've got...
[03:24:45.578 --> 03:24:48.699]  I've got the White House Science Czar's own textbook right here.
[03:24:48.699 --> 03:24:52.140]  These people, these people are in league with Hitler and Stalin.
[03:24:52.140 --> 03:24:54.621]  And I don't say that for rhetoric.
[03:24:54.621 --> 03:24:55.461]  Let me go back to my guest.
[03:24:55.461 --> 03:24:58.082]  Chris, you started reading her quotes.
[03:24:58.082 --> 03:25:00.523]  It's just, it's like a bad dream.
[03:25:00.523 --> 03:25:08.006]  I mean, how can these people be such dirtbags, so obviously evil, and such a threat to everybody?
[03:25:08.006 --> 03:25:10.827]  I mean, most people I know with money are fleeing the country.
[03:25:10.827 --> 03:25:11.207]  Go ahead.
[03:25:11.937 --> 03:25:20.384]  Well, the one thing that's never changed is their utopian vision, or dystopian, you ask me, but this idea that they will organize society.
[03:25:20.384 --> 03:25:21.885]  What changes is their vehicle.
[03:25:21.885 --> 03:25:22.786]  What's the excuse?
[03:25:22.786 --> 03:25:26.869]  What's the latest victim that has to be rescued from the horrors of individual liberty?
[03:25:26.869 --> 03:25:32.654]  And it was, of course, the worker, and the worker threw off those shackles, so it became the environment, which can't speak back.
[03:25:32.654 --> 03:25:33.455]  Wealthier is healthier.
[03:25:33.455 --> 03:25:34.235]  Wealthier is cleaner.
[03:25:34.235 --> 03:25:36.557]  They have to know this, but they really hate wealth.
[03:25:36.557 --> 03:25:39.219]  It's just the excuse, the latest excuse.
[03:25:39.219 --> 03:25:40.981]  Freedom brings wealth, so they attack your freedom.
[03:25:41.559 --> 03:25:42.800]  How badly?
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:46.904]  Well, alright, the President has given some speeches that in isolation just seem weird.
[03:25:46.904 --> 03:25:53.571]  He said, of course, under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket.
[03:25:53.571 --> 03:25:57.214]  He said he would use it to bankrupt industries he didn't like.
[03:25:57.214 --> 03:25:59.897]  His quote was, coal, you know, natural gas,
[03:26:00.277 --> 03:26:27.863]  Whatever the industries then he admitted it would be passed on to the consumer and he said and this will also raise billions of dollars Well in the book I detail how I used FOIA to get Treasury documents that say there was a there was a memo written six days after Obama was elected in which they said he wants to do this here's what we can do and under the justification paragraph they wrote Revenues this will raise quote possibly up to several percentage points of GDP parentheses ie
[03:26:29.532 --> 03:26:32.074]  Uh, the equivalent of the corporate income tax rate.
[03:26:32.074 --> 03:26:34.115]  Well, the corporate income tax.
[03:26:34.115 --> 03:26:38.857]  The corporate income tax, among the highest in the world, raises $400 billion per year.
[03:26:38.857 --> 03:26:46.422]  The biggest tax increase in our history, to pay off World War II, which was an expiring tax, it cost the dollars $107 billion per year.
[03:26:46.422 --> 03:26:48.503]  So we're talking about a spectacular amount of money.
[03:26:49.082 --> 03:26:52.125]  But they don't just want to steal your money, they want to steal your freedoms.
[03:26:52.125 --> 03:26:57.029]  He gave another speech in which he said that you can't eat what you want, drive what you want, or put your thermostat where you want.
[03:26:57.029 --> 03:27:07.237]  The specific quote was, we can't eat as much as we want, drive our SUVs, and keep our thermostats at 72 degrees at all times, and expect that other countries are just going to say, okay.
[03:27:07.237 --> 03:27:08.839]  Well, I didn't ask, okay?
[03:27:08.839 --> 03:27:16.245]  But B, what is the President of the United States doing obsessing about how much I can eat, what I can drive, and where I can put my thermostat?
[03:27:16.513 --> 03:27:27.227]  Well, he's also playing us off against other countries and invoking hatred of us, just like he had Calderon here last week saying, ban all our semi-automatic rifles and handguns.
[03:27:27.227 --> 03:27:29.851]  This is the Socialist Internationale.
[03:27:29.851 --> 03:27:30.852]  This is their mode.
[03:27:31.553 --> 03:27:33.775]  Well, sovereignty is not a big thing to them.
[03:27:33.775 --> 03:27:41.843]  They do believe that one way to skin this cat is through... Global governance is not the same as a global government, though the global governance crowd would of course love that.
[03:27:41.843 --> 03:27:44.965]  I'm just saying, he's a big proponent of global governance.
[03:27:44.965 --> 03:27:53.874]  What I'd like to do, if we can stay when I come back, is talk about the way they want to control your thermostat, and you're not going to believe the documents that someone slipped me.
[03:27:53.874 --> 03:27:57.497]  But the Guardian in the UK, Old Red herself,
[03:27:58.132 --> 03:28:09.478]  ...reported that the Obama administration was briefing European diplomats before Copenhagen had failed... Oh yeah, no, no, they're gonna tax you for any amount and then they say in peak times they're gonna control it.
[03:28:09.478 --> 03:28:11.659]  That's actually... they're announcing that in California.
[03:28:11.659 --> 03:28:12.760]  Start getting into it right now.
[03:28:13.285 --> 03:28:16.687]  Well, okay, well, uh, they want to use these things called smart meters.
[03:28:16.687 --> 03:28:23.931]  Smart meters put the meat on the bones of what Carol Browner said when she said, we want to get to a system whereby the utility holds back power from you.
[03:28:23.931 --> 03:28:25.692]  Why would a utility hold back power from you?
[03:28:25.692 --> 03:28:27.633]  They're in the business of selling you power.
[03:28:27.633 --> 03:28:35.038]  Because there's physical scarcity, which this crowd is arranging, as I detail in the book, and because they've got a requirement that they hold back power from you.
[03:28:35.038 --> 03:28:41.682]  So the state is going to use the utility according to the energy czar to decide, she said, you'll still be able to cool your home
[03:28:42.341 --> 03:28:46.226]  Just not as much as you would like, which means just as much as they would like.
[03:28:46.226 --> 03:28:54.978]  Well, it turns out, the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency, a woman who was Al Gore's CEO before she took this job, making $325,000 a year as a Green Pressure Group CEO.
[03:28:58.141 --> 03:29:03.826]  She divested herself of utility stocks because of course the appearances would be terrible if she didn't.
[03:29:03.826 --> 03:29:07.569]  But someone slipped me her financial disclosure documents and guess what?
[03:29:07.569 --> 03:29:11.953]  She held on to a half million dollars in a smart meter company.
[03:29:11.953 --> 03:29:12.253]  Oh!
[03:29:12.253 --> 03:29:13.715]  Yeah, how about that?
[03:29:13.715 --> 03:29:22.883]  Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency in charge of getting the smart meter mandate in that Carol Browner says is the way that you can't control your thermostat, the state will.
[03:29:23.383 --> 03:29:34.748]  And we've got a woman who held on to between $265,000 and $550,000 of Smart Meter Company stock, in addition to another green cut jobs company, her husband.
[03:29:34.748 --> 03:29:35.468]  It's incredible.
[03:29:35.468 --> 03:29:36.149]  Stay there.
[03:29:36.149 --> 03:29:38.229]  Folks, this is why I get angry.
[03:29:38.229 --> 03:29:40.010]  And you should be angry too.
[03:29:40.010 --> 03:29:45.072]  They're openly saying they're going to decide what temp your house is.
[03:29:45.072 --> 03:29:46.933]  Naked body scanners aren't enough.
[03:29:46.933 --> 03:29:48.954]  All their taxes aren't enough.
[03:29:48.954 --> 03:29:50.575]  Nothing is enough for these people.
[03:29:51.738 --> 03:29:55.663]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.663 --> 03:29:58.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:01.411 --> 03:31:04.435]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:04.435 --> 03:31:09.761]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:31:09.761 --> 03:31:11.804]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:31:11.804 --> 03:31:16.810]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:31:16.810 --> 03:31:18.012]  How much do you want?
[03:31:18.012 --> 03:31:18.733]  When do you want it?
[03:31:19.113 --> 03:31:20.993]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:20.993 --> 03:31:22.074]  When will you need it?
[03:31:22.074 --> 03:31:24.274]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:31:24.274 --> 03:31:25.595]  Will there be any food?
[03:31:25.595 --> 03:31:27.135]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:31:27.135 --> 03:31:32.396]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:31:32.396 --> 03:31:35.977]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:31:35.977 --> 03:31:39.458]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:31:39.798 --> 03:31:41.019]  How much will you need?
[03:31:41.019 --> 03:31:41.940]  We don't know.
[03:31:41.940 --> 03:31:43.040]  How much do you want?
[03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:43.961]  All you can get.
[03:31:43.961 --> 03:31:45.062]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:45.062 --> 03:31:48.104]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:31:48.104 --> 03:31:49.906]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:49.906 --> 03:31:50.806]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:01.257 --> 03:32:05.802]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:05.802 --> 03:32:10.147]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:10.147 --> 03:32:15.213]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to
[03:32:17.841 --> 03:32:18.321]  We're good to go!
[03:32:41.994 --> 03:32:47.056]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:47.056 --> 03:32:51.217]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:51.217 --> 03:32:53.017]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:53.017 --> 03:32:57.158]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:32:57.158 --> 03:32:59.139]  We're going back to Christopher Horner right now.
[03:33:10.222 --> 03:33:14.948]  New book, Power Grab, Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[03:33:14.948 --> 03:33:22.197]  But Matt Ryan for years, who's one of the TV slash radio board ops and producers, he worked at Austin Energy.
[03:33:24.088 --> 03:33:28.871]  And of course he's talked about the meetings where they point out that the illegal aliens wouldn't pay their power bill.
[03:33:28.871 --> 03:33:31.672]  The city just said, let them have free power.
[03:33:31.672 --> 03:33:34.994]  I've talked to Austin cops, they're ordered to let them go, DWI.
[03:33:34.994 --> 03:33:37.275]  That's a separate issue though.
[03:33:37.275 --> 03:33:41.317]  But I walked out during the break and I said, well the city didn't ask us here at our business.
[03:33:41.317 --> 03:33:44.479]  They came and stuck the new smart thermostat on last year.
[03:33:45.339 --> 03:34:02.704]  And in the brochure it said, well, since your thermostat was free, businesses don't have an option, you know, free, taxpayer paid for it, we may turn your heat down in the winter, or your cool, you know, up in the summer, if we're having problems supplying power.
[03:34:02.704 --> 03:34:09.586]  Now that was the old Enron scam, where they got caught to create artificial scarcity, where they were showing congressmen and the state legislature
[03:34:10.066 --> 03:34:10.466]  Thank you.
[03:34:28.883 --> 03:34:32.908]  Here on air, I mean, plus we can dig up the Austin Energy contract, says it.
[03:34:32.908 --> 03:34:35.571]  I mean, I'd read this, but he goes, no, you're absolutely correct.
[03:34:35.571 --> 03:34:37.974]  Austin already has this.
[03:34:37.974 --> 03:34:42.459]  They already control this building's thermostat.
[03:34:42.459 --> 03:34:45.563]  I am under these criminals' control.
[03:34:45.563 --> 03:34:46.444]  Matt Ryan, tell folks.
[03:34:46.604 --> 03:34:51.487]  Right, these programmable thermostats are one of the green initiatives sponsored by Austin Energy.
[03:34:51.487 --> 03:34:55.130]  You call them up, they'll give you a free thermostat, a programmable thermostat.
[03:34:55.130 --> 03:35:01.735]  It'll work for you 24-7 around the clock, except during what they call peak usage times, which
[03:35:03.257 --> 03:35:29.874]  is a time period usually in the afternoon when they say okay well there's a lot of people turning their ACs on they can turn yours off and they will turn yours off for usually about 15 minutes during a day when they they feel that they're having peak usage and that's in the federal legislation to even control what what goes in air conditioners right just like your cell phone since 96 tracks you in real time they're designing the big brother grid but I want to tell you with this business we don't have a choice
[03:35:30.334 --> 03:35:31.795]  They are our lord!
[03:35:31.795 --> 03:35:33.036]  They are our king!
[03:35:33.036 --> 03:35:39.602]  I can't tell you how many times I got a call from an apartment tenant saying, why did y'all come out here and put this in?
[03:35:39.602 --> 03:35:41.323]  I do not want this meter in here.
[03:35:41.323 --> 03:35:45.426]  And it's their landlord that said, oh, programmable thermostats, that's a perk!
[03:35:45.426 --> 03:35:47.408]  We'll give it to all of our tenants.
[03:35:47.408 --> 03:35:52.212]  And whether they like it or not, and believe me, they would complain, they got an all-energy thermostat.
[03:35:52.312 --> 03:35:53.953]  I want to have you back and talk about this more in the future.
[03:35:53.953 --> 03:35:57.615]  I want to go back to Christopher Horner, but thank you for coming in and telling us.
[03:35:57.615 --> 03:35:59.576]  So, Christopher Horner, here we are.
[03:35:59.576 --> 03:36:10.022]  I mean, I'm already under these people's control, and if they can naked body scan my kids to fly, if they can control the temperature in my office, I mean, literally, this is worse than the Soviet Union.
[03:36:10.796 --> 03:36:13.779]  What they're talking about is squeezing you at both ends.
[03:36:13.779 --> 03:36:19.445]  They're trying to ration the physical supply, create physical scarcity where there should not be any.
[03:36:19.445 --> 03:36:22.748]  Remember, the United States sits on the world's largest energy reserves.
[03:36:22.748 --> 03:36:27.854]  We don't have physical scarcity that would lead to this sort of, in essence, micro brownout.
[03:36:28.334 --> 03:36:41.828]  But you're going to get to the larger point of brownouts, because we're following the UK's path of saying, no coal, no nuclear, we'll just build offshore wind farms someday, and then you're going to see them obsessing about the fact that when they get to the Olympics, they're actually not going to have the electricity.
[03:36:41.828 --> 03:36:48.054]  But what you've got here is, Browner is saying things like, okay, this is not just the smart meters that will tell us when you're using your energy.
[03:36:48.627 --> 03:37:02.921]  What, I guess, that Cathy's always also invested in with this company Landis & Gear, a Swiss smart meter company, half a million dollars worth of stock, and just wait until she succeeds in getting those mandated in one of the biggest markets in the world.
[03:37:02.921 --> 03:37:12.610]  They're talking about also getting to the point, like Matt was discussing, whereby they can say, I'm sorry, you've been running your dishwasher too often, wrong time of day, closed washer, sorry.
[03:37:13.511 --> 03:37:15.713]  Carol Browner sold it in this interview to U.S.
[03:37:15.713 --> 03:37:25.022]  News as a savings to the consumer, and I just want your listeners to know they're saving a fortune in India right now, in Haiti, and all over the world by not using energy.
[03:37:25.022 --> 03:37:31.088]  But we live in the richest country in the world, sitting on top of the world's largest energy resources, but that means we have freedom, and they don't like it.
[03:37:31.641 --> 03:37:47.050]  Dan Jones, the communist self-avowed communist radical, he said, this is a quote, also in the book, among many others, the green economy will start off as a small subset and we will push it and push it and push it until it becomes the engine for, wait for it,
[03:37:47.930 --> 03:37:50.291]  Transforming the whole society.
[03:37:50.291 --> 03:37:51.812]  Yes, he said that.
[03:37:51.812 --> 03:38:01.337]  It always comes down to, this is the vehicle for doing to this terribly flawed transgressor of America that they have to fundamentally transform.
[03:38:01.337 --> 03:38:02.317]  This is the vehicle.
[03:38:02.317 --> 03:38:03.518]  This is the excuse.
[03:38:03.518 --> 03:38:05.139]  Your freedoms are simply nothing.
[03:38:05.139 --> 03:38:05.759]  You can be trusted.
[03:38:06.059 --> 03:38:19.252]  And then meanwhile, Enron, and of course you briefly worked for them for about a month and you quit and exposed it all on record and valiantly so, they wrote the cap-and-trade carbon tax fraud, literally made off level.
[03:38:19.252 --> 03:38:30.102]  Going back to California, they tried the same scam there, and in their memos it said, we turn their power off, then they perceive it's more valuable, they'll put up with a triple price increase.
[03:38:30.402 --> 03:38:33.583]  Ha ha ha, we're raping these schmucks.
[03:38:33.583 --> 03:38:38.785]  I mean, so you've got the big money, it's just not free market money, who wants this government monopoly.
[03:38:38.785 --> 03:38:46.288]  I think that's the key to defeat these little green devils, is to expose that they could care less about the environment.
[03:38:46.288 --> 03:38:48.289]  This is all a way just to run everybody's lives.
[03:38:48.882 --> 03:38:53.725]  Yeah, the temperature after cabin tray will be, according to everybody, whatever it would have been.
[03:38:53.725 --> 03:38:55.226]  So we know it's not about that.
[03:38:55.226 --> 03:38:56.687]  It's an excuse.
[03:38:56.687 --> 03:39:03.592]  And the point is, the President comes out there, and this is another quote, he says, some of America's biggest companies support this, by way of saying, so it must be a good idea.
[03:39:03.592 --> 03:39:06.033]  Of course, that's usually his position, right?
[03:39:06.033 --> 03:39:10.656]  No one's ever asked publicly, okay, but why?
[03:39:10.656 --> 03:39:16.180]  Why is GE, which has Enron's old windmills, which nobody wants unless you mandate and heavily subsidize them,
[03:39:16.770 --> 03:39:21.958]  Why is the gas... Did you know the gas industry is actually running these ads calling for more windmills?
[03:39:21.958 --> 03:39:24.842]  Because more windmills simply mean more gas.
[03:39:24.842 --> 03:39:27.926]  You can't really dial a coal plant up and down to meet the...
[03:39:30.184 --> 03:39:36.952]  Oh yeah, they know the wind doesn't work, doesn't transfer the power.
[03:39:36.952 --> 03:39:38.254]  They love it.
[03:39:38.254 --> 03:39:40.657]  Exactly, the gas refining companies, they love it.
[03:39:40.657 --> 03:39:43.000]  They go, sure idiots, get rid of coal.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:45.863]  Shut down what produces 51% of our power.
[03:39:45.863 --> 03:39:47.245]  Shut down our competition.
[03:39:47.245 --> 03:39:47.786]  We love it!
[03:39:49.585 --> 03:39:58.108]  Well, you're right about creating artificial scarcity and the seeming paradox of it, and business is pushing the idea of scarcity.
[03:39:58.108 --> 03:40:02.270]  But you also pointed out why businesses can benefit from scarcity.
[03:40:02.270 --> 03:40:07.172]  Now what I did in the book is I pointed out this is by no means, and it's obviously the world's second oldest profession,
[03:40:07.652 --> 03:40:26.173]  But this is also a very long history in the U.S., and there are left-wingers who point out that the history of the progressive movement was the corporate tie-ups to keep competition out, to lock in a nice livelihood for themselves with their buddies in government, and this is absolutely reminiscent of that for reasons I go into.
[03:40:26.833 --> 03:40:30.375]  And again, it started with the railroads and then various other industries.
[03:40:30.375 --> 03:40:38.439]  We've now got it with something extremely important to your lives and your family's lives and our national security and your family's security, and that is energy.
[03:40:38.439 --> 03:40:39.920]  They're seeking to script
[03:40:40.501 --> 03:40:41.402]  Scarcity.
[03:40:41.402 --> 03:40:43.003]  Dangerous scarcity.
[03:40:43.003 --> 03:40:46.225]  In the name of a boogeyman that keeps changing and now is national security.
[03:40:46.225 --> 03:40:50.247]  But then they'll be the savior with your energy allotment of your poor.
[03:40:50.247 --> 03:40:54.409]  Once they make you poor, now you're dependent on them and you'll vote.
[03:40:54.409 --> 03:40:56.651]  You want power in the winter, old lady?
[03:40:56.651 --> 03:40:58.392]  Vote to ban the Second Amendment.
[03:41:00.598 --> 03:41:02.059]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:41:02.059 --> 03:41:04.962]  This is a very big tent, probably for a lot of reasons.
[03:41:04.962 --> 03:41:11.947]  There's a strange thing going on when you look at why are the population zealots so supportive of this?
[03:41:11.947 --> 03:41:14.049]  Why are the fallen communists so supportive?
[03:41:14.049 --> 03:41:19.574]  The persistent communists, the Greens, the Reds, the pro-tax, the anti-development.
[03:41:19.574 --> 03:41:21.976]  There is a very broad coalition here that I want to
[03:41:22.971 --> 03:41:25.053]  I want folks to think about this.
[03:41:25.053 --> 03:41:31.820]  Why is this extremely disparate group, along with some of, as the President said, America's biggest companies, pushing something?
[03:41:31.820 --> 03:41:34.322]  You're not at the table to get essentially screwed.
[03:41:34.322 --> 03:41:37.305]  They're negotiating you out of the deal, but at your expense.
[03:41:37.305 --> 03:41:38.827]  All of them have this agenda in common.
[03:41:38.827 --> 03:41:39.267]  Why?
[03:41:39.267 --> 03:41:41.750]  And the why is, again, the point of the book.
[03:41:41.750 --> 03:41:42.931]  This is a vehicle.
[03:41:43.775 --> 03:41:47.377]  For their long-held wish list of organizing society.
[03:41:47.377 --> 03:41:50.940]  And there will be trade-offs, yes, involved, and your life will be very different.
[03:41:50.940 --> 03:41:58.305]  And when they orchestrate collapse, on one level or another, it's true, they rush in with more state as the solution.
[03:41:58.305 --> 03:42:07.931]  Now, the President is lecturing Spain to cut it out right now, because he doesn't want them to drag us down, be the next Greece, and drag us down with them, because he's got a fundamental transformation to impose here.
[03:42:07.931 --> 03:42:11.674]  But last week, in a Spanish newspaper, La Gazeta, there was a full-paged
[03:42:12.808 --> 03:42:20.255]  The headline of which was, quote, direct translation, Spain admits that green economy as sold to Obama is a disaster.
[03:42:20.255 --> 03:42:21.016]  Yeah, I saw that.
[03:42:21.016 --> 03:42:22.337]  So here's the deal.
[03:42:22.337 --> 03:42:36.469]  Their globalization, their command destruction, their neo-feudalism has been too good at destroying things and so it's blowing up in their face before they get all the vice grips in place.
[03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:39.032]  I have to say that when the state controls power,
[03:42:39.702 --> 03:42:41.423]  The state controls an awful lot.
[03:42:41.423 --> 03:42:50.831]  And what this agenda does is transfer basic energy use and production and transmission, all these decisions from individuals, producers and consumers to the state.
[03:42:50.831 --> 03:42:54.593]  And when you do that, you are giving up an awful lot of your liberties.
[03:42:54.593 --> 03:42:55.694]  Now, I married a European.
[03:42:55.694 --> 03:43:02.760]  She's from a country where they have a joke, at least they're still laughing for now, that it's a good thing we don't have all the cars we pay for.
[03:43:02.760 --> 03:43:03.740]  Where would we put them?
[03:43:03.740 --> 03:43:05.562]  What they mean by that in Denmark is
[03:43:06.300 --> 03:43:16.483]  Through the Special Assessment and the VAT, they have doubled the price of cars there, in order to force scarcity upon the public, because it's a wealthy country, and they would have all these cars.
[03:43:16.483 --> 03:43:17.164]  Oh, no!
[03:43:17.164 --> 03:43:18.504]  The statists didn't care for that.
[03:43:18.504 --> 03:43:24.486]  And so what they did is they, in effect, doubled the price of a vehicle to force the population out of automobility.
[03:43:24.486 --> 03:43:30.068]  Now, when you start letting go of automobility, pretty soon you'll find yourself letting go of control of every basic decision.
[03:43:30.908 --> 03:43:32.852]  The temp, as you pointed out.
[03:43:32.852 --> 03:43:39.024]  Now when you let go of things like this, please don't be surprised when you wake up one morning and there's an awful lot more that's just gone.
[03:43:40.367 --> 03:43:48.793]  Well, no, I mean, the social engineers admit that they want to have one-child policy, that they want to decide what we're going to be when we grow up.
[03:43:48.793 --> 03:43:53.737]  They're literally organizing all of human society in a nightmarish way.
[03:43:53.737 --> 03:43:58.241]  I mean, we know when people try to organize things, you know, from top down, it always is a disaster.
[03:43:58.241 --> 03:44:03.224]  But they want to wreck things, and that's my next question to you, because you're, you know, an insider who really studies this.
[03:44:04.265 --> 03:44:08.408]  Every incumbent, whether Republican or Democrat, is being thrown out of office.
[03:44:08.408 --> 03:44:15.074]  Whether it's Specter, whether it's what just happened with the congressional seat in Hawaii, whether it's Massachusetts, it doesn't matter.
[03:44:16.412 --> 03:44:20.357]  I've never seen such a realignment against the establishment.
[03:44:20.357 --> 03:44:24.763]  So they've really, you know, Obama was the fake revolution against Bush.
[03:44:24.763 --> 03:44:29.308]  Now people realize, my God, Obama is the real takeover.
[03:44:29.308 --> 03:44:34.655]  And so people are really, I mean, Zbigniew Brzezinski last week said, our global governance is in trouble.
[03:44:35.215 --> 03:44:38.159]  He said, the people have finally woken up worldwide to us.
[03:44:38.159 --> 03:44:38.920]  We're now in trouble.
[03:44:38.920 --> 03:44:40.623]  I don't know if you saw that speech.
[03:44:40.623 --> 03:44:42.926]  But they admit they're in trouble.
[03:44:42.926 --> 03:44:45.149]  How do you see them striking back?
[03:44:45.149 --> 03:44:52.279]  I mean, because from every way I slice this, we are now really at the make it or break it crossroads.
[03:44:53.134 --> 03:45:09.621]  Well, there is a real push, and again, I was in the room in The Hague in November 2000 when Jacques Chirac gave his speech calling Kyoto the global warming treaty that covered 35 industrial titans like Iceland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia, but not China, India, Mexico, Brazil, and so on.
[03:45:09.621 --> 03:45:19.345]  I was in the room with some members of Congress and a few other Americans who were the only ones surprised when Jacques Chirac, who at the time was the President of France, said Kyoto was the first component of an authentic global governance.
[03:45:19.890 --> 03:45:28.095]  Jim Sensenbrenner is a Wisconsin Republican who marched outside and held an impromptu press conference, but I stood there watching the left-wing press swearing at him.
[03:45:28.095 --> 03:45:31.277]  The Guardian reporter was swearing bollocks at him.
[03:45:31.277 --> 03:45:34.800]  And Sensenbrenner said, if you want to keep us out of something, call it global governance.
[03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:46.387]  Well, I said the Guardian noted that Obama's diplomats were telling EU diplomats there may be a delay on Kyoto II in the United States because he's considering something called a Congressional Executive Agreement.
[03:45:46.969 --> 03:45:49.071]  That was, uh, I heard you mention NAFTA before.
[03:45:49.071 --> 03:45:50.532]  NAFTA is precedent.
[03:45:50.532 --> 03:45:53.074]  It's never been tried, the constitutionality of this.
[03:45:53.074 --> 03:45:54.395]  It did not get to this.
[03:45:54.395 --> 03:46:01.640]  But the issue of Congress waiving Article 2, Section 2 ratification, uh, advice and consent, the two-thirds ratification.
[03:46:02.180 --> 03:46:06.603]  NAFTA was a treaty between three countries that Congress just said is not a treaty.
[03:46:06.603 --> 03:46:18.932]  And they granted something called Fast Track Authority, which is a suggestion of what should be in it, and a promise to give it an up or down, no amendment, no filibuster, 50 plus 1 vote in both houses.
[03:46:18.932 --> 03:46:25.637]  Now, if you do this, and the administration apparently is telling Europeans, we may have to try this because we're going to call Kyoto 2 not a treaty,
[03:46:26.932 --> 03:46:31.414]  You're gonna have a problem because it's then left up to the courts and you know how activist they've become.
[03:46:31.414 --> 03:46:34.436]  But what you're talking about is you have one bite at the apple.
[03:46:34.436 --> 03:46:35.796]  Don't trust the courts.
[03:46:35.796 --> 03:46:37.037]  You saw campaign finance.
[03:46:37.037 --> 03:46:37.617]  Oh, don't worry.
[03:46:37.617 --> 03:46:38.998]  The court will fix it.
[03:46:38.998 --> 03:46:39.798]  Don't trust them.
[03:46:39.798 --> 03:46:44.401]  What you have to do is block it at the granting of fast track for Kyoto 2.
[03:46:44.401 --> 03:46:46.241]  They won't call it Kyoto 2.
[03:46:46.241 --> 03:46:52.204]  They're going to call it Johannesburg because that's where the World Environment Summit is in 2012.
[03:46:52.204 --> 03:46:55.206]  They're actually going to try to get Kyoto 2 according to
[03:46:56.460 --> 03:47:06.849]  Lefty advisors to Obama like this fella Nigel Purvis, who's counseling him, just declared this next key global warming treaty not a treaty.
[03:47:06.849 --> 03:47:10.932]  It's got all, it quacks, flies and does everything it ought to, it's like a duck.
[03:47:10.932 --> 03:47:18.358]  But if you get Congress to say it's not a treaty, and the only difference is it means no two-thirds ratification.
[03:47:18.358 --> 03:47:20.500]  Well, that's your one bite at the apple.
[03:47:20.500 --> 03:47:22.882]  The courts aren't going to help you is my guess.
[03:47:22.882 --> 03:47:25.804]  And you have a 50 plus 1 requirement and it would take
[03:47:26.471 --> 03:47:39.696]  You know, you see incumbents being thrown out, but I just don't know, given the way, you know, you didn't see the Democrats... So they're going to come at us with a violation of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, treason, like this article.
[03:47:39.696 --> 03:47:42.417]  Top official says Feds may not process illegals.
[03:47:43.357 --> 03:47:45.237]  Referred from Arizona.
[03:47:45.237 --> 03:47:50.019]  So, you know, citizens have no rights, but if illegal aliens get arrested, we won't pick them up.
[03:47:50.019 --> 03:47:51.659]  So it's the same thing here.
[03:47:51.659 --> 03:47:55.600]  The federal government just doesn't care what we say or who we elect or what we do.
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:47:58.460]  They're just going to do it because they're God.
[03:47:58.460 --> 03:48:04.582]  Expanding on that and, you know, trying to see where you see this going.
[03:48:04.582 --> 03:48:06.002]  What about the Republicans?
[03:48:06.002 --> 03:48:09.583]  I mean, you know, they've got a big hand in allowing this to happen as well.
[03:48:10.131 --> 03:48:11.972]  Yeah, you've got a problem.
[03:48:11.972 --> 03:48:15.413]  Right now, for example, this week, we're supposed to have a vote.
[03:48:15.413 --> 03:48:22.216]  It just requires 51 or 50 votes, not 60, saying EPA does not have the authority to do this through the back door.
[03:48:22.216 --> 03:48:23.836]  This, of course, came through the courts.
[03:48:23.836 --> 03:48:25.097]  It was a 5-4 decision.
[03:48:25.097 --> 03:48:26.097]  We lost.
[03:48:26.097 --> 03:48:28.698]  I represented the skeptic scientist in this case.
[03:48:28.698 --> 03:48:38.762]  The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Massachusetts versus EPA, saying EPA has the authority, does not have to, but has the authority to treat exhalation as pollution.
[03:48:39.389 --> 03:48:48.665]  Well, there's a resolution by Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and she's saying EPA does not... Congress is allowed to vote veto major rules within 60 days.
[03:48:49.805 --> 03:48:51.686]  And she's saying no.
[03:48:51.686 --> 03:48:56.508]  The problem is it has 41 co-sponsors, 3 Democrats, and that means 3 Republicans have said no.
[03:48:56.508 --> 03:49:01.051]  They're from the Northeast, to no surprise, Scott Brown, and the ladies from Maine.
[03:49:01.051 --> 03:49:11.996]  Now, Scott Brown, during the campaign, said, climate change is, we all know this, what I don't want to do is something as big as what EPA is proposing, or cap and trade, without getting to the bottom of the scientific scandals.
[03:49:11.996 --> 03:49:15.258]  Well, I assure you we've not gotten to the bottom of the scientific scandals.
[03:49:15.258 --> 03:49:19.180]  I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the University of Virginia on Friday.
[03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:21.961]  I'm not sure how far we'll get, but we will litigate it.
[03:49:21.961 --> 03:49:25.622]  We're suing NASA probably this week for our own climate case.
[03:49:25.622 --> 03:49:26.782]  We're pushing this.
[03:49:26.782 --> 03:49:34.824]  But right now we've already got three Republicans in the Senate who have not co-sponsored a bill to say EPA will not do this to the back door.
[03:49:34.824 --> 03:49:42.026]  Instead, the world's greatest deliberative body, why, we shall deliberate on what will be the biggest intervention in our economy and our history.
[03:49:42.026 --> 03:49:44.907]  And you have three Republicans not just co-sponsoring this thing?
[03:49:45.467 --> 03:49:51.075]  You need to shut down the business of the Senate if the administration tries to do this through the back door.
[03:49:51.075 --> 03:49:53.097]  And three Republicans have not codified it.
[03:49:53.097 --> 03:49:55.080]  Is that why they're so scared of Rand Paul?
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:50:01.068]  Because he gave that speech saying, we're not going to let you use fake environmentalism to shut our economy down?
[03:50:02.092 --> 03:50:05.354]  I'm sure he troubled some by pointing some things out.
[03:50:05.354 --> 03:50:17.561]  I was told by the Spanish green jobs professor, Dr. Calzada, in an email that ran Paul in one of his acceptance speeches, pointed out that there's a new steel mill in Kentucky, the North American Stainless Plant, with 175 workers.
[03:50:17.561 --> 03:50:19.562]  I write about this in my book.
[03:50:19.562 --> 03:50:25.226]  Power grab in which those steel workers are jobs that are sent from Spain because of cap and trade and green jobs schemes.
[03:50:25.226 --> 03:50:26.947]  The CEO was very clear.
[03:50:26.947 --> 03:50:29.849]  He said, you can make windmills out of steel, but you can't make steel using windmills.
[03:50:29.849 --> 03:50:30.449]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:50:31.215 --> 03:50:39.980]  But, uh, Rand Paul pointed this out, and I don't think people in Washington like to hear the idea that the state is not responsible for economic growth.
[03:50:39.980 --> 03:50:51.646]  Yeah, I mean, the grass grows, uh, you know, the sky is blue, the sun comes up in the morning because... because Barack Obama reads off a teleprompter.
[03:50:51.646 --> 03:50:52.166]  Stay there.
[03:50:52.166 --> 03:51:00.171]  Final segment with our guest, uh, the new book, I've got to read it, Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America.
[03:51:02.403 --> 03:51:04.265]  Don't answer it!

[03:52:01.328 --> 03:52:06.292]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.292 --> 03:52:07.293]  What have we got?
[03:52:07.293 --> 03:52:09.735]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:09.735 --> 03:52:10.755]  A republic.
[03:52:10.755 --> 03:52:13.377]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:13.377 --> 03:52:15.659]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:52:15.659 --> 03:52:17.681]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:17.681 --> 03:52:19.362]  So they think they own our land?
[03:52:19.362 --> 03:52:20.683]  They think they own our water?
[03:52:20.683 --> 03:52:21.284]  Children?
[03:52:21.284 --> 03:52:22.404]  Our education?
[03:52:22.404 --> 03:52:23.245]  Our money?
[03:52:23.245 --> 03:52:26.888]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:27.242 --> 03:52:32.223]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:32.223 --> 03:52:33.244]  We have the facts.
[03:52:33.244 --> 03:52:34.404]  We have the Constitution.
[03:52:34.404 --> 03:52:35.304]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:52:35.304 --> 03:52:36.205]  We have common law.
[03:52:36.205 --> 03:52:38.725]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:38.725 --> 03:52:42.606]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:52:42.606 --> 03:52:47.568]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:52:47.568 --> 03:52:49.068]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[03:52:49.068 --> 03:52:50.148]  Don't Tread on Me.

[03:52:57.111 --> 03:52:58.592]  How can I make safe drinking water?

[03:54:12.503 --> 03:54:18.587]  Christopher Horner, author, researcher, litigator at the Supreme Court, advisor to Congress, new book, Power Grab.
[03:54:18.587 --> 03:54:30.694]  Don't forget our new video we're carrying, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, State's Rights Movement, Difference Between a Democracy and a Republic, available at Infowars.com or you can watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:32.395 --> 03:54:36.299]  And your purchases of books and videos make this radio broadcast what we do here possible.
[03:54:36.299 --> 03:54:41.165]  So you got big mega-corporations in bed with government to create monopolies.
[03:54:41.165 --> 03:54:45.289]  As John D. Rockefeller I said, competition is a sin.
[03:54:45.289 --> 03:54:49.454]  And this will destroy our free market system that's made this nation so great.
[03:54:49.454 --> 03:54:51.696]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[03:54:51.696 --> 03:54:53.098]  Chris, we were talking during the break.
[03:54:54.053 --> 03:54:57.036]  You pled, you know, many times before the Supreme Court.
[03:54:57.036 --> 03:55:05.785]  The arrogance level, though, I mean, I don't see Republicans opposing Elena Kagan, who is like Joe Stalin in drag or something.
[03:55:05.785 --> 03:55:11.051]  And then I was talking to you about what's happening with BP and, you know, it just seems like it's a lawlessness.
[03:55:11.051 --> 03:55:13.153]  But give us your take on that in closing.
[03:55:13.660 --> 03:55:22.264]  Well, what we said before going out last time was the idea to many elected officials that Washington is not responsible for economic growth is an asthma here.
[03:55:22.264 --> 03:55:24.965]  So somebody like Rand Paul who's going to come up and say those things...
[03:55:25.823 --> 03:55:28.264]  Uh, it's going to be a troublemaker and isolated.
[03:55:28.264 --> 03:55:30.546]  You've got companies like BP who choose.
[03:55:30.546 --> 03:55:38.910]  Remember, their favorite politician in the last two decades was Barack Obama, a guy who swore to cause your listeners' energy prices to skyrocket.
[03:55:38.910 --> 03:55:40.611]  BP had no problem with that.
[03:55:40.611 --> 03:55:43.993]  Obama swore he had no problem with high gas prices.
[03:55:43.993 --> 03:55:46.734]  He just said they shouldn't go up too fast for the obvious reason.
[03:55:46.734 --> 03:55:48.075]  People will start calling for
[03:55:49.256 --> 03:55:53.359]  Uh, policies that will allow us greater access to the greatest energy reserves in the world.
[03:55:53.359 --> 03:56:00.044]  So you've got a problem with these companies like BP that are a bit, look, they can have their public spats now, but it's not that much of a spat.
[03:56:00.044 --> 03:56:08.891]  BP remains in bed mostly with the left, sometimes with the right, uh, in Washington-style right, because they, like Enron, lost the plot.
[03:56:08.891 --> 03:56:16.396]  They began as an energy company and then they started to try to make money off of derivatives and windmills and solar panels and pushing paper and not making anything.
[03:56:16.396 --> 03:56:18.438]  They tried to make money off of doing nothing.
[03:56:19.002 --> 03:56:33.147]  Now, a couple of months after I left Enron in 1997, there was an Oval Office meeting, August 4th, 1997, Sir John Brown of BP and Ken Lay from Enron, with the President of the United States and the Vice President Al Gore.
[03:56:33.147 --> 03:56:42.751]  And on August 1st, 1997, a Friday, in preparation for the Monday Oval Office meeting, there was a briefing memo written for Ken Lay, which is available online at masterresource.org.
[03:56:43.601 --> 03:56:44.742]  You can find it.
[03:56:44.742 --> 03:56:51.805]  In it they say, okay, the unanimous Senate, I mean the context was a week or so before the Senate had unanimously said, don't go to Kyoto and do this.
[03:56:51.805 --> 03:56:58.589]  So these two fellows, Ken Lay and John Brown of BP, go into the Oval Office and they say, ignore that Senate.
[03:56:58.589 --> 03:57:01.770]  You gotta go to Kyoto and you gotta do it and here's what it has to be.
[03:57:01.770 --> 03:57:10.295]  And since, obviously we know who won that one, there's a memo also available at Master Resource, and I discussed it in my book, from Ken Lay's Kyoto advisor from Kyoto,
[03:57:11.804 --> 03:57:15.627]  Five months later, saying this treaty is exactly what we've been lobbying for.
[03:57:15.627 --> 03:57:20.832]  So the unanimous Senate gets ignored when they say, look, you know, we go along with a lot, but not this.
[03:57:20.832 --> 03:57:22.613]  Not what Jacques Chirac calls global governance.
[03:57:22.613 --> 03:57:24.314]  Not an obvious wealth transfer.
[03:57:24.314 --> 03:57:25.996]  Not obviously rationing energy here.
[03:57:25.996 --> 03:57:27.577]  How has the Senate changed, though?
[03:57:27.577 --> 03:57:33.062]  I mean, they can see that everything Obama's doing is political suicide, and still it looks like they'll be able to pass it.
[03:57:33.062 --> 03:57:34.303]  I mean, are they all bought off?
[03:57:34.303 --> 03:57:35.163]  Are they blackmailed?
[03:57:35.163 --> 03:57:35.804]  What's going on?
[03:57:36.244 --> 03:57:38.146]  Well, Lindsey Graham's gotten so much pushback.
[03:57:38.146 --> 03:57:41.629]  He was the test case, and now the folks in South Carolina aren't happy with him.
[03:57:41.629 --> 03:57:44.311]  And so he says he'll vote for it, but he won't be a co-sponsor.
[03:57:44.311 --> 03:57:49.956]  Look, progress, I know, as Cap Weinberger said about Daytona, if this is progress, we can't afford much more progress.
[03:57:49.956 --> 03:57:53.138]  But you start setting some examples here.
[03:57:53.138 --> 03:58:00.965]  When Democrats are running as anti-capitrators, as happened in the Pennsylvania race, in which they succeeded, when Scott Brown wins Massachusetts, saying in Cambridge,
[03:58:02.005 --> 03:58:02.446]  No, no, no.
[03:58:02.446 --> 03:58:04.807]  You don't do this until you get to the bottom of what stinks.
[03:58:04.807 --> 03:58:06.888]  Of course, we don't know where he's going to vote on this thing.
[03:58:06.888 --> 03:58:10.731]  You are turning a very big ship of statism trying to steal your liberty.
[03:58:10.731 --> 03:58:13.372]  But read that book and listen to what they're saying.
[03:58:13.372 --> 03:58:14.193]  No, no, I agree with you.
[03:58:14.193 --> 03:58:19.396]  I mean, we're having victories that they're having to bait and switch now and aren't calling it cap and trade.
[03:58:19.396 --> 03:58:20.016]  Amazing.
[03:58:20.016 --> 03:58:22.117]  Christopher Horner, thank you for coming on with us.
[03:58:22.117 --> 03:58:23.839]  The book is Power Grab.

[03:58:29.862 --> 03:58:30.563]  I'm out of time.
[03:58:30.563 --> 03:58:33.785]  Retransmission starts now, ladies and gentlemen.
