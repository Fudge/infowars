[00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:05.858]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:07.639]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.400]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.981]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:12.542]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:16.724]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:25.129]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:31.733]  After ClimateGate, PachariGate, GlacierGate, AmazonGate, and you've got
[00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:41.598]  Racketeering Globally, that document came out two months ago with the UN going and organizing key universities to engage in fraud.
[00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:46.582]  We go look at each university, Canada, Australia, the US, New Zealand, England.
[00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:55.188]  They are all cooking the books, cutting out temperature data that shows that we're cooling in the last 10 years at least.
[00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.991]  The heating ended 15 years ago.
[00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.872]  You've got Pachari making all this money.
[00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:17.144]  This is unprecedented because the entire globalist agenda for the UN-IMF World Bank to set up world taxation and to be able to shut down or curtail any industry that isn't part of their inside coterie, it's all imploding.
[00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:19.207]  But the battle isn't over.
[00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:20.428]  We've won a lot of big battles.
[00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:21.710]  We've now got the initiative.
[00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.552]  We can beat them, but they're in sconce, they're dug in.
[00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:29.373]  We're going to have to go house to house with these people in our towns, our cities.
[00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:33.634]  Schwarzenegger's organizing governors and mayors to take over locally.
[00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.854]  Absolute treason, and he needs to go back to his own country.
[00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:38.535]  They'll sure kick him out in Austria.
[00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:43.656]  James Dillingpole writes regularly for the Times of London, the Sunday Times, the Daily Telegraph.
[00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:45.016]  He's also a TV critic.
[00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:47.657]  The Spectator, he is the author of various novels, including
[00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:50.118]  And we'll tell you about some of those.
[00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:55.541]  Also, he's a best-selling author and one of the great analysts.
[00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:58.783]  Breaking down what these people are up to.
[00:01:58.783 --> 00:02:00.384]  We'll also give you his website.
[00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:12.732]  This is a short segment, but James, is it safe to say, or let me ask you this question, is this exploding in their face in an even bigger fashion than you thought ClimateGate would originally?
[00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.110]  Definitely.
[00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.171]  You know, I thought Christmas had come early with climate change.
[00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:21.073]  It seems that next Christmas has come early as well because this has been fantastic.
[00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:26.095]  We are having so many scandals, I almost can't keep up with it.
[00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:27.075]  But that's the good news.
[00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:31.237]  The bad news is, as Shakespeare said, we have scotched the snake.
[00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:41.421]  I think the great AGW, anthropogenic global warming snake, is much more dangerous now it's wounded.
[00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:53.952]  I think you're going to see all sorts of devious attempts by the IPCC, by the various green movements, to try and trick their way out of the situation and we've got to be on our guard.
[00:02:55.305 --> 00:03:06.068]  They've gone from stonewalling to now the BBC, The Age and others going, oh, there were a few bad scientists that meant well because they know how real the problem is.
[00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:13.649]  And we now see the IPCC head and others saying, well, we did want to make it look worse because it is a real problem.
[00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.330]  So now they're saying we lied to save you.
[00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:18.318]  Well, it's interesting, Alex.
[00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:24.060]  Are you familiar with Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the guy in charge, the beardy guy?
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.142]  He looks a bit like... I call him the troll impersonator.
[00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:29.963]  He looks a bit like Saruman from Lord of the Rings.
[00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:34.605]  Well, he looks like Osama Bin Laden's older brother.
[00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:35.625]  He does, he does!
[00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:36.606]  His ugly older brother.
[00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:55.363]  Dr Pachauri is in charge of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and as you know, he's been exposed for having all sorts of extraordinarily diverse business connections.
[00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.265]  He's heavily involved in carbon trading.
[00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:03.509]  He's even got an involvement in an oil company, which is kind of weird, given that he's supposed to be saving the planet.
[00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:08.902]  We're good to go.
[00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:35.154]  Stay there, James.
[00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:41.558]  James Dillingpole, top writer over in England, author, researcher, somebody who's really been tracking this fraud.
[00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:42.938]  Long segment coming up.
[00:04:42.938 --> 00:04:47.521]  I want to just go through all the new scandals one by one, each one
[00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:49.742]  Dwarfing Climategate.
[00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:51.043]  Each one more wild.
[00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:51.964]  And you said it.
[00:04:51.964 --> 00:04:54.146]  It's five or six new scandals a day.
[00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:57.008]  I can't even keep track of it, but we're gonna try here today.
[00:04:57.008 --> 00:04:59.550]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.673]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:05:03.673 --> 00:05:06.555]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:07.816]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:08.637]  It's very real.
[00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:10.858]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:12.520]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.843]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.544]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:25.566]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:30.347]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:05:30.347 --> 00:05:33.168]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:35.909]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:43.051]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:47.092]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:47.352]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.352 --> 00:05:49.013]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:06:00.678 --> 00:06:02.900]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.704]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:12.066]  We have the best-selling author of Obama Land.
[00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:15.148]  I've seen the future and it doesn't work.
[00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:18.050]  Journalist Mr. Dillingpole with us.
[00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.652]  His website is jamesdillingpole.com.
[00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:23.054]  And he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:28.238]  Now, if you just joined us, we're going to chronicle the aftermath of Climategate.
[00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:39.545]  And it's kind of like a battle at sea where you torpedo a big ship and it starts exploding and burning but then the magazine
[00:06:40.578 --> 00:06:48.505]  We're all of its explosives and artillery shells are stored ignites and the whole ship just blows up.
[00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:50.447]  Now they're still in our local towns and cities.
[00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:52.128]  They've invested hundreds of billions.
[00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:58.694]  They're not going to stop, but their capital ship, their main flagship has completely exploded.
[00:06:58.694 --> 00:07:01.096]  They are now known as frauds, but they don't care.
[00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:02.658]  They're going to continue on.
[00:07:02.658 --> 00:07:05.500]  So we're going through the UN climate chief.
[00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:15.965]  Uh, who is admitting all these errors in their reports, but it's coming out that they, quote, did want to make it look worse so that we would accept them saving us.
[00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:26.029]  And, of course, he makes money off shutting down ancient, and when I say ancient, some of the oldest and best steel mills, uh, forges in England.
[00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:29.571]  And the government pays him to then set one up in India.
[00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.874]  So this is also a hijacking of industry.
[00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:39.321]  We're covering that scandal first, then we're going to get into all the other scandals with Mr. Dillingpole.
[00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:40.102]  Please continue, sir.
[00:07:57.824 --> 00:07:58.524]  We're good to go.
[00:08:17.918 --> 00:08:26.560]  This guy has got connections with the Chicago Carbon Exchange, which, of course, his shareholders include Goldman Sachs and Al Gore.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.181]  So, you know, the net broadens.
[00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:34.923]  There are a lot of very rich people and organizations who are involved in this massive scam.
[00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:42.905]  And so Pachauri Gage, as we call it, is this guy being exposed as being compromised, let us say.
[00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:48.954]  Then after Pachauri Gate we get this thing called Glacier Gate.
[00:08:48.954 --> 00:08:56.566]  It turns out that the United Nations, the IPCC's fourth assessment report, you know,
[00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:13.961]  The most accurate, up-to-date, most scientifically reliable report on the state of the planet, climate-wise, tells us that the world's glaciers could be gone by 2035.
[00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:18.805]  Now, 2035 is not very far away, is it?
[00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:21.348]  And so that's kind of quite a scary prospect.
[00:09:21.348 --> 00:09:22.029]  Could it be that
[00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:28.932]  I don't know.
[00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:58.180]  2,000 expert scientists in their field, 2,500 peer-reviewed scientists, we're told.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.964]  How come this mistake got slipped into this reliable report?
[00:10:02.964 --> 00:10:10.589]  Well, it turns out that the IPCC plays pretty fast and loose with its scientific facts.
[00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:15.312]  It got this from a magazine article in New Scientist.
[00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:20.786]  Where did New Scientist get this information from about the glaciers melting by 2035?
[00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:27.415]  It got this information from a conversation on a mobile phone with an Indian.
[00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:37.465]  Now James Dillingpole investigating this for major publications in England and the United States
[00:10:57.967 --> 00:11:02.408]  We know that when they have this mantra of, but it's peer-reviewed.
[00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:04.509]  It's peer-reviewed.
[00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:12.811]  Ignore ClimateGate and one of the main climate facilities used by the UN at East Anglia, England.
[00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:15.852]  Ignore the fact that they are trying to hide decline.
[00:11:15.852 --> 00:11:22.254]  We have all these other scientists all peer-reviewed, but when you look at it, they are all using the data collated
[00:11:22.774 --> 00:11:22.934]  Yep.
[00:11:53.294 --> 00:11:54.135]  That's absolutely right.
[00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:59.477]  I think whenever you hear somebody use the phrase peer-reviewed, you should reach for your Browning.
[00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:07.379]  Because peer-reviewed, I'm sorry to say, is a bankrupt notion since Climategate.
[00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:07.980]  Because what the
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.640]  I don't think so.
[00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:29.049]  But in the new science, you're not allowed to question Al Gore.
[00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:29.509]  He says it's settled.
[00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:30.089]  That's the end of it.
[00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:59.183]  But isn't it worse, sir, because they're not just only allowing a small inner group to produce these fake studies that have been proven to all be absolute fraud.
[00:12:59.183 --> 00:13:01.984]  They will never release the data.
[00:13:01.984 --> 00:13:06.607]  And now, because the data is being forced to be released, we find out when you actually go to Russia.
[00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:07.607]  Well, I know.
[00:13:07.607 --> 00:13:13.371]  I mean, have you seen the fantastic report released today by Joseph DiLeo, who's a meteorologist, and Anthony Watts of the famous What's Up With That?
[00:13:37.447 --> 00:13:39.307]  It's fantastic.
[00:13:39.307 --> 00:13:44.708]  It says, Surface Temperature Records, Policy-Driven Deception.
[00:13:44.708 --> 00:14:03.912]  And what it argues, this very thorough report, is that the surface data records from the last century or so are so corrupt and unreliable that we cannot even be sure that any global warming whatsoever has taken place in the last century or so.
[00:14:04.397 --> 00:14:06.559]  And they've got a lot of tricks too.
[00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:29.777]  All over the world, this is on record now, we posted the mainstream articles where they admit it, in the last 20 years these funded groups have set up their own reading systems or they have contracted with airports or they've contracted with weather centers on top of buildings where they know the temperature is going to be many degrees hotter and that's another way.
[00:14:31.084 --> 00:14:34.165]  Well, the urban heat island effect.
[00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:57.654]  What this means is that the weather sites, you know, where temperatures have been measured around the world, originally they were built maybe on the edge of town, and as civilization, as cities have grown in size, so the area surrounding the weather gauge has become, you know, more and more built up.
[00:14:57.654 --> 00:14:59.495]  Some of these things are sited near airports.
[00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:13.792]  So what this means is that, inevitably, the temperature records they're keeping have been distorted by the urban heat island effect of the cities, because cities are warmer than the country outside.
[00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:15.434]  That's how it works.
[00:15:15.434 --> 00:15:16.755]  So how are we to trust
[00:15:18.277 --> 00:15:26.963]  These records which show that the Earth is getting warmer when it may simply be the result of the urban heat island effect.
[00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:29.806]  But that's not all.
[00:15:29.806 --> 00:15:45.918]  What happened sometime between the 1970s and the 1990s is that they vastly reduced the number of weather stations used to compile the world temperature data record.
[00:15:59.517 --> 00:16:04.060]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:04.981]  Number one.
[00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:08.403]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:08.403 --> 00:16:09.264]  Number two.
[00:16:09.264 --> 00:16:14.168]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:14.168 --> 00:16:14.908]  It's true.
[00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:19.772]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:19.772 --> 00:16:20.232]  Number three.
[00:16:20.592 --> 00:16:24.174]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:24.174 --> 00:16:28.897]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:28.897 --> 00:16:31.659]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:36.121]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:40.264]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:40.264 --> 00:16:45.027]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:16:45.307 --> 00:16:49.491]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:51.273]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:51.273 --> 00:16:53.535]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:55.878]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:05.255]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:12.570]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:18.954]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:18:18.954 --> 00:18:21.196]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:22.036]  Tim Geithner?
[00:18:22.036 --> 00:18:22.537]  Bernanke?
[00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:23.218]  They're arsonists!
[00:18:23.218 --> 00:18:24.499]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:26.741]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:18:40.635 --> 00:18:47.924]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:19:04.594 --> 00:19:07.358]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:19:07.358 --> 00:19:13.006]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:04.052]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:07.273]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:21.461 --> 00:20:28.705]  I'm going to break down all the other big hoaxes coming up in the next hour.
[00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:36.209]  You know, we told you back in 2002, we'd gotten all the details then, that it was the most weaponized U.S.
[00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:38.370]  Great Anthrax ever seen.
[00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:44.333]  Now, eight years later, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Times,
[00:20:46.468 --> 00:20:54.702]  Reporting it was the most super weaponized U.S.
[00:20:54.702 --> 00:20:57.186]  and that Fort Detrick couldn't even do it.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:58.520]  What's
[00:21:17.566 --> 00:21:18.107]  Doesn't work.
[00:21:38.965 --> 00:22:01.710]  How you see them counterattacking, how they're trying to buttress themselves by giving each other awards, Prince Charles going and visiting the main nest of criminals, what happened with ClimateGate, the new investigations, in hindsight, what ClimateGate blowing up the Copenhagen fraud did to the move for the EU-wide global dictatorship.
[00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.170]  James Dillingpole, break it down.
[00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:12.336]  Well, Alex, I had a very depressing lunch on New Year's Day with a distant member of my family.
[00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:18.581]  And it turns out that he's now working for something called the European Climate Foundation.
[00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:21.423]  And the European Climate Foundation is one of those
[00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:32.660]  Charitable bodies, which is pumping in a lot, lot, lot of money into funding climate change advocacy groups.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.321]  You know, it is up to the neck.
[00:22:34.321 --> 00:22:40.123]  It was there at Copenhagen at the negotiating table, you know, staying in all the best hotels.
[00:22:40.123 --> 00:22:51.107]  And I asked him whether Climategate, which as you remember, broke during the, the story broke during the, at the beginning of the Copenhagen, you know, libtard fest.
[00:22:51.888 --> 00:22:52.128]  Yes.
[00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:04.573]  We're good to go.
[00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:40.790]  The reason this scam is so dangerous, as I keep trying to remind you, I blog about this every day for the Telegraph in London, and some people say to me, why do you keep going on and on about this subject?
[00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.550]  Why can't you talk about something else?
[00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.732]  Because, I mean, I want to hear your answer, but it's a takeover of society.
[00:23:46.732 --> 00:23:47.432]  It's a cult.
[00:23:47.432 --> 00:23:52.354]  You've got Common Purpose and others funded by this EU group.
[00:23:52.354 --> 00:23:55.315]  Here, locally in Austin, they reported last year that a CIA
[00:23:56.856 --> 00:23:56.916]  I'm
[00:24:13.712 --> 00:24:18.616]  I would say, Alex, that it is no exaggeration at all to say that the Green Movement is more dangerous than the
[00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:41.039]  I don't think so.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.400]  I don't
[00:25:27.194 --> 00:25:34.416]  This movement threatens our society, threatens our freedoms, threatens everything we believe in.
[00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:42.618]  It's a big problem because, you know, a lot of the people involved in the Green Movement are cuddly, polar bear loving, caring people.
[00:25:42.618 --> 00:25:45.319]  They're not nasty people.
[00:25:45.319 --> 00:25:51.080]  And it is a constant struggle fighting against their arguments.
[00:25:52.366 --> 00:25:54.228]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:25:54.228 --> 00:25:56.271]  And I mean, I have the New York Times.
[00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:57.372]  I have the LA Times.
[00:25:57.372 --> 00:25:58.513]  I see it where I live.
[00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:00.155]  I see the textbooks.
[00:26:01.235 --> 00:26:14.339]  I put my children in a... For example, my daughter started having choir lessons at Christmas and one of the songs they sang was that lovely song about the snowman, which is very nice.
[00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:19.001]  And another of the songs was called, When Will We Learn?
[00:26:19.001 --> 00:26:23.102]  And it went on and on about, you know, when will we learn to stop being so
[00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:40.709]  Let me stop you, let me stop you, because I was about to say, I put my kids in private school for one year, and even a Christian private school, it was all government approved brainwashing.
[00:26:40.709 --> 00:26:44.631]  We tried to even buy homeschooling material, most of it has the brainwashing.
[00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:49.212]  And they chant these songs in the public schools.
[00:26:49.212 --> 00:26:54.534]  They have the kids go home and write fake tickets and reports on their parents.
[00:26:54.534 --> 00:26:55.874]  Don't take a hot bath.
[00:26:55.874 --> 00:26:58.055]  Don't run the water while you brush your teeth.
[00:26:58.055 --> 00:26:59.635]  And it has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:26:59.635 --> 00:27:00.135]  That's the thing.
[00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:01.616]  They say, well, it's to save the earth.
[00:27:01.616 --> 00:27:12.539]  No, these are cold-hearted tacticians at the top that want to create an anti-human guilt to make humanity the enemy so the collectivist can run the state.
[00:27:12.939 --> 00:27:13.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.944]  I mean, it is very much like the Hitler Youth being encouraged to report on their parents.
[00:27:19.944 --> 00:27:29.191]  You know, my son is at one of the most expensive, most highly rated private prep schools in the country.
[00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:32.373]  And even he gets fed the eco-propaganda.
[00:27:32.373 --> 00:27:38.458]  And one of the reasons he gets this eco-propaganda, and the school has actually designated itself an eco-school,
[00:27:39.218 --> 00:27:39.999]  We're good to go.
[00:27:47.932 --> 00:27:48.572]  Let me go further.
[00:27:48.572 --> 00:27:58.137]  Mark Dice, who's a reporter who I know, he went out last week in San Diego, and over 90% of the people he talked to, it was mainly women, young women and middle-class, middle-aged women,
[00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:22.069]  They all, the women except for one old lady, said, ban free speech.
[00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:29.034]  He had a fake petition saying, ban free speech, arrest anybody that disagrees with Obama, it's time to shut these people up.
[00:28:29.034 --> 00:28:32.176]  And they would sign it, put their name, their info.
[00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:34.337]  I mean, they are ready.
[00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:44.584]  And they think we run society, we're good, and so now it's a Nazi slash Soviet movement run by a bunch of useful idiot women.
[00:29:00.233 --> 00:29:03.255]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:08.578]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:29:08.578 --> 00:29:10.619]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:15.622]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:29:15.622 --> 00:29:16.802]  How much do you want?
[00:29:16.802 --> 00:29:17.943]  When do you want it?
[00:29:17.943 --> 00:29:19.824]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:20.905]  When will you need it?
[00:29:20.905 --> 00:29:23.086]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:29:23.086 --> 00:29:24.447]  Will there be any food?
[00:29:24.447 --> 00:29:25.967]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:29:25.967 --> 00:29:27.028]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:29:27.168 --> 00:29:28.489]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:29:28.489 --> 00:29:31.212]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:29:31.212 --> 00:29:34.816]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:38.620]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.862]  How much will you need?
[00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:40.763]  We don't know.
[00:29:40.763 --> 00:29:41.864]  How much do you want?
[00:29:41.864 --> 00:29:42.605]  All you can get.
[00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:43.606]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:31:59.264 --> 00:32:03.807]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.807 --> 00:32:04.707]  Number one.
[00:32:04.707 --> 00:32:08.149]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:09.010]  Number two.
[00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.892]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.892 --> 00:32:14.633]  It's true.
[00:32:14.633 --> 00:32:19.516]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.516 --> 00:32:19.956]  Number three.
[00:32:20.316 --> 00:32:23.899]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:23.899 --> 00:32:28.622]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.622 --> 00:32:31.384]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.384 --> 00:32:35.867]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.867 --> 00:32:40.010]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.774]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:37.473]  We're now into the second segment of this four-hour syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:33:37.473 --> 00:33:42.454]  And Mark Faber, editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom and Doom Report.
[00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:46.735]  The website is www.GloomBoomDoom.com.
[00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:50.436]  That's GloomBoomDoom.com is with us for the next 22 minutes or so.
[00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:59.744]  He has one of the most accurate records in forecasting the economy and picking investments and analyzing what's happening.
[00:33:59.744 --> 00:34:05.370]  Dr. Mark Faber, again, was born in Zurich, Switzerland, and you can read his entire amazing
[00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.572]  It's my pleasure.
[00:34:08.572 --> 00:34:09.813]  Thank you very much for having me.
[00:34:26.237 --> 00:34:27.238]  It's good to have you here.
[00:34:27.238 --> 00:34:30.320]  Okay, so much is going on.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.261]  What's really happening in the world economy?
[00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:37.625]  What's really happening with sovereign debt, private debt, the dollar, dollar devaluation?
[00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:42.269]  Write down what's currently happening and your forecast, please, sir.
[00:34:42.269 --> 00:34:51.416]  Well, basically what we have is excessive credit growth that led in the period 2001 to 2008 to the housing bubble.
[00:34:56.405 --> 00:35:00.186]  And then the collapse of the housing bubble.
[00:35:00.186 --> 00:35:06.489]  And then we had the recession in 2008, 2009.
[00:35:06.489 --> 00:35:12.751]  And the recession was cushioned through huge government stimulus and monetizing.
[00:35:12.751 --> 00:35:22.115]  In other words, the government, through the Federal Reserve, is buying government debt and is expanding its balance sheet.
[00:35:22.115 --> 00:35:25.656]  And I think that this will not help the economy very much.
[00:35:26.516 --> 00:35:30.277]  But what it's helped is essentially emerging economies.
[00:35:30.277 --> 00:35:39.779]  Because don't forget, after 1998, because of the credit bubble and the housing bubble, what the U.S.
[00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:42.039]  did was to overconsume.
[00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:49.581]  And this overconsumption, in other words, consumption went up as a percent of the economy, led to the trade deficit.
[00:35:58.194 --> 00:35:58.914]  We're good to go.
[00:36:28.131 --> 00:36:28.871]  Thank you very much.
[00:36:49.238 --> 00:37:04.783]  Now, when we look at what's happening with the economy, they've been telling us in the last year that we've had a recovery, that unemployment's only 10.2, but most of the big private institutions that use the old numbers-crunching system that the government previously used,
[00:37:05.603 --> 00:37:09.766]  Most statisticians and economists believe is much more accurate.
[00:37:09.766 --> 00:37:21.392]  They say it's over 22% right now and that we're just going to continue sliding in to a deepening, really, depression for Main Street.
[00:37:21.392 --> 00:37:26.415]  The big banks and brokerage firms are all having record profits off all the money they've stolen through the bailouts.
[00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:34.240]  Can you speak to what you think the economy is going to look like and the health of the dollar and what you see unfolding?
[00:37:35.908 --> 00:37:54.124]  Well, I mean, given the huge stimulus we had, and also given that the economy collapsed between September 2008 and March 2009, the figures, economically speaking, will look somewhat better in the next three months.
[00:37:54.124 --> 00:37:59.789]  Because these months, January, February, March 2009, were very bad.
[00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:03.712]  So, I mean, maybe the economy shows signs of bottoming out.
[00:38:08.021 --> 00:38:16.544]  In general, I think that the outlook for future growth is very poor.
[00:38:16.544 --> 00:38:35.389]  In other words, the large deficits lead to larger government debt that keeps interest rates on long-dated securities, in other words, on long-term bonds, relatively high, and may even lead to inflation at some point.
[00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:48.828]  I mean, my sense is that in the last 20 years, actually, the typical household in the US, the median household, as they call it, has not made any progress.
[00:38:48.828 --> 00:38:54.514]  But who's made progress are, of course, as you said, the thieves on Wall Street.
[00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:57.117]  They have made a lot of progress.
[00:38:57.117 --> 00:38:58.639]  And government employees.
[00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:06.304]  Well, that's the issue, is that government is exploding in size.
[00:39:06.304 --> 00:39:10.787]  Obama has spent more money in one year than all presidents before him combined.
[00:39:10.787 --> 00:39:12.989]  They're just hiring more police, more bureaucrats.
[00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:24.136]  That's the only sector that's growing, and they're now saying they're going to continue the spending and that they're going to raise taxes, and they are raising taxes at every level, state, federal, local, international, and that
[00:39:25.297 --> 00:39:30.280]  We see many UN chiefs and others saying, look, we want to end the industrialized world.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.723]  Government says we're consuming too much, so they're doing us a favor clamping down on the economy.
[00:39:34.723 --> 00:39:40.707]  And this is actually being done by design, many experts believe.
[00:39:40.707 --> 00:39:43.749]  What's your take on that?
[00:39:43.749 --> 00:39:53.875]  Well, basically, I think that Mr. Obama is right to hire a lot of policemen because if I were such a bad president, I would also need increasing protection.
[00:39:55.103 --> 00:40:06.856]  But in general, I think that his administration is a complete failure in terms of economic and foreign policies.
[00:40:06.856 --> 00:40:10.160]  Nothing has been addressed overseas.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.205]  He has increased the engagement in Afghanistan.
[00:40:14.978 --> 00:40:22.846]  And I can assure you that Afghanistan is a country where nobody has an interest that the U.S.
[00:40:22.846 --> 00:40:24.888]  will win the conflict.
[00:40:24.888 --> 00:40:33.335]  Neither the Chinese, nor the Indians, nor the Pakistanis, nor the Russians, nor the mercenaries who are hired in Pakistan.
[00:40:33.335 --> 00:40:36.699]  So it will never end and it will be a bottomless pit.
[00:40:37.799 --> 00:40:45.541]  And in terms of domestic policies, the health care reform is another disaster because it creates uncertainty.
[00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:47.282]  So let's assume you have a business.
[00:40:47.282 --> 00:40:49.382]  You employ 50 people.
[00:40:49.382 --> 00:40:52.663]  You don't know what your tax rate will be three years from now.
[00:40:52.663 --> 00:40:56.344]  You don't know what your health care bill will be three years from now.
[00:40:56.344 --> 00:40:59.065]  But the last thing you will do is hire people.
[00:40:59.844 --> 00:41:05.508]  In addition to that, as you just pointed out, he has piled up huge deficits.
[00:41:05.508 --> 00:41:11.271]  They're running now at an annual rate of, say, $1.5 trillion.
[00:41:11.271 --> 00:41:14.233]  The problem is that they will not go down.
[00:41:14.233 --> 00:41:17.055]  I think they will actually increase.
[00:41:17.055 --> 00:41:19.336]  And so the government debt increases.
[00:41:19.336 --> 00:41:25.440]  And one day, this increased government debt will lead to substantially higher interest rates.
[00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:30.784]  Well, Venezuela, as you know, last week devalued their currency by 50%.
[00:41:30.784 --> 00:41:46.714]  We have experienced a long slide in the value of a dollar, evidenced by a candy bar 20 years ago being a quarter, and now it's a dollar, or a beer being a quarter, and now it's $1.50 or $2.
[00:41:46.714 --> 00:41:53.719]  I mean, obviously people know there's real inflation, but towards the end of a devaluation,
[00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:55.860]  It tends to accelerate.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.162]  We're certainly seeing that right now.
[00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:04.988]  You know, there's temporary, as people do the reverse carry trade, for those that don't know, back into the United States.
[00:42:04.988 --> 00:42:10.913]  We saw a booing for a time, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and other economists have predicted on the show, in the fall of last year.
[00:42:10.913 --> 00:42:19.339]  But they say, overall, it is a downward-sliding, slow death of the dollar, and that global interests have decided to go ahead and abandon the dollar.
[00:42:19.339 --> 00:42:21.561]  The only question is how to abandon it.
[00:42:21.561 --> 00:42:22.942]  What's your take on that, Dr. Faber?
[00:42:24.133 --> 00:42:30.036]  There isn't really an international currency at the present to replace the dollar.
[00:42:30.036 --> 00:42:46.084]  And also, whereas I'm very critical of US monetary and fiscal policies, I'm also critical of other countries' fiscal and monetary policies, because other countries are also very good at printing money.
[00:42:46.084 --> 00:42:51.267]  When the people leave, the leaders they will have to follow.
[00:42:55.526 --> 00:42:59.030]  Lies and their alibis they will have to swallow.
[00:43:00.285 --> 00:43:03.306]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:43:03.306 --> 00:43:08.629]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:43:08.629 --> 00:43:10.669]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:43:10.669 --> 00:43:15.672]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:43:15.672 --> 00:43:16.852]  How much do you want?
[00:43:16.852 --> 00:43:17.993]  When do you want it?
[00:43:17.993 --> 00:43:19.873]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:43:19.873 --> 00:43:20.934]  When will you need it?
[00:43:20.934 --> 00:43:23.135]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:43:23.135 --> 00:43:24.495]  Will there be any food?
[00:43:24.495 --> 00:43:25.796]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:43:25.996 --> 00:43:31.262]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:34.867]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:43:34.867 --> 00:43:38.691]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:39.912]  How much will you need?
[00:43:39.912 --> 00:43:40.814]  We don't know.
[00:43:40.814 --> 00:43:41.915]  How much do you want?
[00:43:41.915 --> 00:43:42.656]  All you can get.
[00:43:42.656 --> 00:43:43.677]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:43.917 --> 00:43:46.980]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:44:47.098 --> 00:44:49.019]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:44:59.056 --> 00:45:03.619]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:04.519]  Number one.
[00:45:04.519 --> 00:45:07.942]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:45:07.942 --> 00:45:08.802]  Number two.
[00:45:08.802 --> 00:45:13.705]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:45:13.705 --> 00:45:14.446]  It's true.
[00:45:14.446 --> 00:45:19.309]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:20.149]  Number three.
[00:45:20.149 --> 00:45:23.732]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:45:23.732 --> 00:45:27.434]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:45:27.634 --> 00:45:28.435]  Number 4.
[00:45:28.435 --> 00:45:31.197]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:45:31.197 --> 00:45:34.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.660]  Number 5.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.803]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:44.567]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:49.030]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.811]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:53.073]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:45:53.073 --> 00:45:55.415]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:46:00.836 --> 00:46:04.777]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:46:04.777 --> 00:46:13.639]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:18.260]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:29.082]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:46:29.722 --> 00:46:39.224]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:46:39.224 --> 00:46:44.666]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:46:44.666 --> 00:46:52.147]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:46:52.147 --> 00:46:54.888]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:47:00.498 --> 00:47:04.106]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.106 --> 00:47:07.312]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:37.117]  Now, Dr. Faber, looking at that, so you have all the major currencies in the world simultaneously engaging basically in the same big government footprint, and huge deficits, and thus devaluation of currencies, so it's happening simultaneously.
[00:47:37.117 --> 00:47:42.539]  Yes, it's a coordinated debasement of paper money.
[00:47:43.081 --> 00:47:46.342]  And that's what the G20 admits they're doing.
[00:47:46.342 --> 00:47:56.425]  Meanwhile, helicopter Ben Bernanke is delivering billion dollar bills out of helicopters, but only directly into JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and his own pocket.
[00:47:56.425 --> 00:47:57.805]  And so now there's open talk.
[00:47:57.805 --> 00:47:58.945]  That is correct.
[00:47:58.945 --> 00:48:01.526]  It's so funny.
[00:48:01.526 --> 00:48:05.187]  I mean, it's actually tragic.
[00:48:05.187 --> 00:48:10.949]  It sounds funny, but it's tragic because it doesn't reach decent people in America.
[00:48:10.949 --> 00:48:11.389]  In fact,
[00:48:12.162 --> 00:48:17.204]  Through monetary policies, they have impoverished normal people.
[00:48:17.204 --> 00:48:18.824]  And let me explain you why.
[00:48:18.824 --> 00:48:28.748]  First of all, when you cut down interest rates to zero, a lot of decent people, they accumulated savings in their lives.
[00:48:28.748 --> 00:48:35.150]  They have these savings on certificates of deposits in banks or on bank deposits.
[00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:40.732]  Now, even if you have $20 million on zero interest, you can't live.
[00:48:41.658 --> 00:48:48.419]  So if the interest was, say, 5% on $20 million, you would have an income of $1 million.
[00:48:48.419 --> 00:49:04.122]  Secondly, commodity prices went up and peaked out in May 2006, and then they moved sideways, including oil, which was prior to the rate cuts in September 2007 at $75.
[00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:15.413]  At that time, the combined expenditures for oil in the United States were approximately $500 billion.
[00:49:15.413 --> 00:49:29.158]  But when Mr. Bernanke slashed interest rates to zero, oil went to $147, and the combined expenditures for oil in 2008 went to an annualized rate of a trillion dollars.
[00:49:29.158 --> 00:49:33.059]  So the consumer, you and decent people in America,
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.585]  We're saddened with another 500 billion dollars in taxes.
[00:49:39.585 --> 00:49:45.330]  And the beneficiaries of that were the speculators largely on Wall Street.
[00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:45.970]  Absolutely.
[00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:51.395]  So we have the real economy being fed into the speculators' gaping mouths.
[00:49:51.395 --> 00:49:51.876]  Correct.
[00:49:51.876 --> 00:49:52.836]  You have a pie.
[00:49:52.836 --> 00:49:58.761]  And the pie has obviously through the recession become somewhat smaller.
[00:49:58.761 --> 00:50:00.243]  But what is now happening
[00:50:01.753 --> 00:50:28.193]  The gangsters like Mr. Ben Bernanke and Mr. Larry Summers and Mr. Tim Geithner, they take the smaller pie but allocate a larger portion of the pie to their friends on Wall Street and in the banking sector and to very questionable organizations like AIG and so forth at the expense of decent people who work in America.
[00:50:28.706 --> 00:50:30.147]  So where is it all heading?
[00:50:30.147 --> 00:50:34.209]  I mean, you talk about them hiring more policemen to protect themselves.
[00:50:34.209 --> 00:50:38.011]  I was recently interviewed by Parents, which is a leading financial paper.
[00:50:38.011 --> 00:50:40.432]  I said, we're all doomed.
[00:50:40.432 --> 00:50:43.654]  It's going to end in a complete disaster.
[00:50:43.654 --> 00:50:46.436]  But we have to distinguish.
[00:50:46.436 --> 00:50:53.199]  The disaster may not happen for five to ten years, but we're heading into an iceberg.
[00:50:53.199 --> 00:50:56.221]  And what will eventually happen is that
[00:50:56.874 --> 00:51:03.056]  The population will suffer very badly from inflation and declining real wages.
[00:51:03.056 --> 00:51:08.539]  And the establishment, including the government, will protect itself.
[00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:20.303]  And when everything becomes very bad, and you have simultaneous essentially a recession, depression, like you said, unemployment is of course higher than 10 percent.
[00:51:20.303 --> 00:51:23.985]  I don't think it's 22 percent, but say maybe 15 percent.
[00:51:25.177 --> 00:51:28.480]  When that doesn't improve, they'll go to war.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:35.465]  And nobody can pay for the war, so you print more and more money, and you have hyperinflation, and then the system goes.
[00:51:35.465 --> 00:51:48.256]  That's why I'm telling everybody, you ought to own some land, and you ought to own some stocks, and you ought to own some gold, or a lot of gold and other precious metals.
[00:51:49.136 --> 00:51:56.522]  Because paper money and bonds are very vulnerable over the next five to ten years.
[00:51:56.522 --> 00:51:57.122]  Absolutely.
[00:51:57.122 --> 00:52:03.707]  I mean, this is a giant black hole of debt that's mathematically impossible to get out of.
[00:52:03.707 --> 00:52:05.308]  It is impossible.
[00:52:05.308 --> 00:52:07.030]  I have made the calculation.
[00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:09.431]  I don't want to bore you with everything.
[00:52:09.431 --> 00:52:16.497]  But when you consider debt to GDP, 375 percent, but that excludes the unfunded
[00:52:17.401 --> 00:52:26.007]  The state's liabilities, the unfunded liabilities arising from Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are coming due.
[00:52:26.007 --> 00:52:30.511]  I mean, the hole is so big, we are doomed.
[00:52:32.512 --> 00:52:34.974]  And that's what the private central bank set up.
[00:52:34.974 --> 00:52:39.358]  They take over the world with fiat currency and credit they put out.
[00:52:39.358 --> 00:52:43.182]  They bring in a cashless society after they bankrupt it all.
[00:52:43.182 --> 00:52:47.205]  And the entire world is a giant scientific police state, Dr. Wobber.
[00:52:47.205 --> 00:52:57.595]  That is clearly, from all of their own documents, their own statements, this has been a premeditated, as you said, concerted, coordinated, master economic
[00:52:58.315 --> 00:53:02.176]  Well, first of all, I don't think so because I have to also say there's no political will.
[00:53:22.296 --> 00:53:25.659]  Because, as you say, the U.S.
[00:53:25.659 --> 00:53:28.381]  Federal Reserve is actually a corporation.
[00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:31.404]  In other words, it's a private entity.
[00:53:31.404 --> 00:53:35.247]  And it's most likely owned by all the banks in the United States.
[00:53:35.247 --> 00:53:42.994]  But the point is, there were voices in the United States that rightly asked for the Federal Reserve to be audited.
[00:53:42.994 --> 00:53:44.916]  But why do they refuse to be audited?
[00:53:45.592 --> 00:53:52.999]  If you have a business and someone comes along and says, listen, we want to audit you because we want to do business with you.
[00:53:52.999 --> 00:53:55.982]  Then you said, sure, if you have nothing to hide.
[00:53:55.982 --> 00:54:00.026]  But if you have something to hide, you say, I refuse to be audited.
[00:54:00.026 --> 00:54:06.252]  So I think the Federal Reserve is, first of all, 99% responsible
[00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:15.009]  For the Nasdaq bubble and the subsequent crash.
[00:54:15.009 --> 00:54:21.373]  99% responsible for the debt build-up and subsequent housing crash.
[00:54:21.373 --> 00:54:34.840]  And 99% responsible for having misled people who simply from their education cannot make a decision about how much leverage they use when they buy a house.
[00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:51.032]  Because if you buy a house and you borrow only 50% on your house and the house may drop 50% in value and your mortgage is still not underwater, but if you borrow 99% or 120% then you have a big problem.
[00:54:51.032 --> 00:55:00.334]  And the Federal Reserve, especially Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke, encourage people to take second home loan mortgages
[00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:07.167]  And so now here we are and their media is still putting out the hype that people's housing loans caused this.
[00:55:07.167 --> 00:55:12.852]  They baited and switched day one with the bailout money and didn't use it for that and said we're not going to tell you where it's going.
[00:55:12.852 --> 00:55:15.254]  They're clearly out of control.
[00:55:15.254 --> 00:55:21.920]  Congress is talking about not re-approving the nomination of Bernanke for another term.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.901]  They're talking about indicting Geithner.
[00:55:25.014 --> 00:55:25.494]  Yeah, I know.
[00:55:25.494 --> 00:55:25.634]  I mean...
[00:55:54.602 --> 00:56:03.324]  The problem is that nobody in government and in the establishment wants to face the truth.
[00:56:03.324 --> 00:56:12.706]  And even very decent people, they tell you the truth, but they are very diplomatic about the statements they make.
[00:56:12.706 --> 00:56:18.748]  They don't say it's inevitable that eventually there'll be a huge mess.
[00:56:18.748 --> 00:56:20.408]  They guard themselves very much.
[00:56:20.984 --> 00:56:26.609]  But the mainstream and the government officials, they keep on misleading people.
[00:56:26.609 --> 00:56:27.590]  That is the problem.
[00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.510]  And they know, don't they?
[00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.551]  I mean, they've designed it.
[00:56:29.551 --> 00:56:37.178]  Well, I'm not sure they know because, you know, the intelligence level of government employees is obviously not very high.
[00:56:37.178 --> 00:56:42.222]  But I'm at the bankers, the actual technicians running this.
[00:56:42.222 --> 00:56:43.503]  Yes.
[00:56:43.503 --> 00:56:45.305]  I mean, that's the real government is the banks.
[00:56:45.305 --> 00:56:46.526]  Even Congress admits that now.
[00:56:47.242 --> 00:56:59.985]  Well, I mean, the government basically is financed by large corporations and by election campaign contributions and so forth and so on.
[00:56:59.985 --> 00:57:07.027]  And then every politician then owes something to the people that gave him money, that brought him into office.
[00:57:07.027 --> 00:57:12.208]  And so nothing really gets ever decided when there is a crack in the building.
[00:57:13.325 --> 00:57:15.126]  They don't fix the crack.
[00:57:15.126 --> 00:57:24.871]  They just put paint on top of it and then two or three years later the crack reappears and they put fresh paint until the whole thing collapses.
[00:57:24.871 --> 00:57:27.273]  Dr. Mark Faber is our guest.
[00:57:27.273 --> 00:57:31.035]  Gloomboomdoom.com is his website.
[00:57:31.035 --> 00:57:36.558]  Sir, I really appreciate you spending time with us and I look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[00:57:36.558 --> 00:57:36.898]  Take care.
[00:57:38.905 --> 00:57:44.079]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the news blitz and other guests coming up.
[00:57:44.079 --> 00:57:45.482]  You'll definitely want to stay with us today.
[00:57:45.482 --> 00:57:46.886]  This transmission is key.
[00:57:50.965 --> 00:57:54.988]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:58.211]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:03.035]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:58:03.035 --> 00:58:09.420]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.662]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:58:12.162 --> 00:58:12.482]  Tim Geithner?
[00:58:12.482 --> 00:58:13.003]  Bernanke?
[00:58:13.003 --> 00:58:13.663]  They're arsonists!
[00:58:13.663 --> 00:58:14.964]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:58:14.964 --> 00:58:17.206]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:58:31.095 --> 00:58:33.218]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:58:33.218 --> 00:58:38.364]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:58:38.364 --> 00:58:47.494]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:49.662 --> 00:58:54.964]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:57.705]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:58:57.705 --> 00:59:03.047]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:59:03.047 --> 00:59:07.528]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.

[00:59:52.159 --> 00:59:54.200]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.423]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:09.554]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.554 --> 01:00:11.176]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.176 --> 01:00:12.717]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.717 --> 01:00:16.901]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.901 --> 01:00:24.108]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.108 --> 01:00:26.910]  Well, Patriot icon, Red Beckman,
[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:34.592]  Was already scheduled for the show, but now he can comment on Patriot icon Eustace Mullins.
[01:00:34.592 --> 01:00:42.254]  He'll also talk about the New World Order Master Plan, his 50 years fighting it, and a lot more coming up.
[01:00:42.254 --> 01:00:43.614]  I just talked to him.
[01:00:43.614 --> 01:00:46.415]  He certainly has a comment on the illegals being above the law.
[01:00:46.415 --> 01:00:48.416]  I mean, talk about fraud.
[01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:51.197]  Talk about unjust weights and measures.
[01:00:51.197 --> 01:00:52.677]  It is fraud.
[01:00:52.677 --> 01:00:53.617]  They are above the law.
[01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:54.958]  They get all the free welfare.
[01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:55.878]  Citizens get nothing.
[01:00:57.227 --> 01:00:59.388]  Well, our standard of living implodes.
[01:00:59.388 --> 01:01:01.350]  Going back to Ken in Michigan.
[01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:02.811]  Ken, finish up your point.
[01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:16.480]  Well, I just noticed all you have to do is, I'm not a big TV watcher, but all you have to do really is watch some of the police documentaries like First 48, Cop.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:26.267]  All you see is a bunch of criminal Mexicans, probably most of them are illegal, and they're causing havoc, and nobody seems to care.
[01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:36.738]  Well, you know there's a hundred million people in Mexico, and criminals flee there and come here.
[01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:40.401]  It's a shame, you know, and they've been doing this for how long, Alex?
[01:01:40.401 --> 01:01:44.785]  I mean, when are people gonna wake up?
[01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:50.409]  They have woken up, but the government, whether it's Republican or Democrat, is controlled by the New World Order.
[01:01:54.173 --> 01:01:57.578]  Yeah, they come at us from so many angles sometimes.
[01:01:57.578 --> 01:01:58.339]  It's just hard.
[01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:03.305]  I can't imagine, you know, how you deal with it all.
[01:02:03.305 --> 01:02:04.767]  This is how I deal with it.
[01:02:04.767 --> 01:02:06.729]  This is how I deal with it, Ken.
[01:02:06.729 --> 01:02:10.675]  Things would be a thousand percent worse if people like
[01:02:11.986 --> 01:02:29.362]  Red Beckman and Bill Benson and G. Edward Griffin and Myron Fagan and Eustace Mullins and countless other people 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago hadn't been telling the truth.
[01:02:29.362 --> 01:02:31.804]  People like Gary Allen,
[01:02:32.898 --> 01:02:42.283]  People like Bob Chapman, they understood what was happening, they warned us so other generations of people could wake up and we grew slowly.
[01:02:42.283 --> 01:02:49.928]  But we are now probably 30% of the population and it took 3-5% to win the Revolutionary War.
[01:02:49.928 --> 01:02:52.089]  Look, 80% of the public wanted to be slaves.
[01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.457]  Okay.
[01:02:54.457 --> 01:03:01.300]  And another 17% or so supported the Patriots, but it was only about 3 to 5% that started it and won it.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.981]  And so we're in the right.
[01:03:02.981 --> 01:03:04.841]  We've got 30%.
[01:03:04.841 --> 01:03:09.804]  If the globalists don't go to full martial law in the next year, we'll have 50% another year or two.
[01:03:09.804 --> 01:03:11.365]  We are growing that fast.
[01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:15.867]  It's been a slow growth, but it's been exponential, and now it's doubling.
[01:03:16.947 --> 01:03:19.749]  And just expanding massively every few years.
[01:03:19.749 --> 01:03:21.851]  And we'll talk to Red Beckman about the mass awakening.
[01:03:21.851 --> 01:03:25.874]  And when we say mass awakening, folks, it is a mass awakening.
[01:03:25.874 --> 01:03:30.557]  And that's why they openly said they want to restrict and censor and have the UN take over the Internet.
[01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:31.978]  That's openly being announced.
[01:03:31.978 --> 01:03:34.820]  World government's openly being announced.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.342]  They tried the game of denying any of this existed for decades.
[01:03:38.342 --> 01:03:39.964]  That doesn't work anymore.
[01:03:39.964 --> 01:03:43.646]  So now they say, oh, well, world government's good.
[01:03:43.646 --> 01:03:45.147]  So, Ken, that's why I
[01:03:47.129 --> 01:03:48.313]  Stay in the fight.
[01:03:48.313 --> 01:03:49.759]  I don't have a choice.
[01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:50.924]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:03:50.924 --> 01:03:52.149]  If there was some free country...
[01:03:53.274 --> 01:03:58.977]  I'd be just like my ancestors jumping on the Mayflower and coming to a new land to be free and left alone by government.
[01:03:58.977 --> 01:04:01.318]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:02.898]  My roots are here.
[01:04:02.898 --> 01:04:04.079]  I'm cornered.
[01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.580]  I have nowhere to go.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.480]  I've got to fight.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.541]  And that's a powerful position, folks.
[01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:16.925]  When you've committed, that you know there's nothing else you can do, and you realize you're going to die regardless, you might as well stand up and fight.
[01:04:16.925 --> 01:04:19.726]  And just commit to it, all of you.
[01:04:19.726 --> 01:04:21.287]  So, what do you think of them apples, Ken?
[01:04:22.244 --> 01:04:30.092]  Well, you're about right on, and I hope more people will wake up to what's going on.
[01:04:30.092 --> 01:04:42.145]  I try to wake up as many people as I can, and I think we got a chance, but we all need to band together and fight against the satanic Hitler wannabes.
[01:04:43.436 --> 01:04:44.257]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:04:44.257 --> 01:04:45.158]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:45.158 --> 01:04:47.400]  In three minutes, we're back with Red Beckman.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.562]  He'll be with us 20 minutes in the next hour.
[01:04:49.562 --> 01:04:50.643]  And yes, we'll open the phones.
[01:04:50.643 --> 01:04:52.545]  You can comment on any issue.
[01:04:52.545 --> 01:04:54.867]  Red Beckman, a real treasure.
[01:04:54.867 --> 01:04:55.348]  Straight ahead.
[01:05:00.578 --> 01:05:03.579]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:03.579 --> 01:05:08.902]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.902 --> 01:05:10.962]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:10.962 --> 01:05:15.964]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:15.964 --> 01:05:17.145]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:18.265]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.265 --> 01:05:20.146]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.146 --> 01:05:21.227]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.227 --> 01:05:23.428]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:23.428 --> 01:05:24.768]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:26.069]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.749 --> 01:05:28.832]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:05:28.832 --> 01:05:31.555]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:31.555 --> 01:05:35.139]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:38.964]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:38.964 --> 01:05:40.205]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.205 --> 01:05:41.086]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.086 --> 01:05:42.208]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:43.129]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.129 --> 01:05:43.930]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:47.254]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:47.254 --> 01:05:49.036]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:49.036 --> 01:05:49.957]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:59.795 --> 01:06:05.198]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:05.198 --> 01:06:07.540]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:14.264]  Brad Beckman, author of The Law That Never Was and Born Again Republic.
[01:06:14.264 --> 01:06:24.811]  Beckman is the founder of the Fully Informed Juries Association that is all over the United States and informs juries that they're the boss, not the corrupt judge or prosecutor.
[01:06:27.065 --> 01:06:28.286]  Very good to be with you.
[01:06:49.495 --> 01:06:53.136]  For those that may not know who you are, we have a lot of new affiliates and listeners.
[01:06:53.136 --> 01:07:03.500]  Encapsulate who you are, your awakening and what you've seen over the last 50 years fighting this tyranny and where you think we are today.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:13.284]  Well, I think that when I really woke up to the fact that our government was not performing as it was supposed to,
[01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:14.768]  I think so.
[01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.930]  I got out of the service in December of 52.
[01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:46.853]  I tried to be involved in the political process and it took me a number of years to figure out that our vote on election day just didn't do the job as far as controlling our government.
[01:07:46.853 --> 01:07:51.174]  And so I had to do some studying and all and of course I discovered that
[01:07:52.294 --> 01:08:08.097]  Uh, our votes, uh, we have a three-vote system, not a one-vote system, uh, because we have learned to our sorrow that, uh, just, uh, electing people to Congress and such, uh, that we don't have the control that we should have.
[01:08:08.097 --> 01:08:21.239]  And the founders were wise men, and they put the grand jury system in, and they put the trial jury system in, and, um, and both the grand jury and the trial jury had been in existence for centuries.
[01:08:22.392 --> 01:08:24.634]  Uh, prior to our war of independence.
[01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:33.099]  And so, uh, I found that, uh, the juries have the power to nullify law.
[01:08:33.099 --> 01:08:36.341]  And that the, we the people, are the sovereign.
[01:08:36.341 --> 01:08:40.003]  We're not, we're not the peons of government.
[01:08:40.003 --> 01:08:42.545]  Uh, we are to control government.
[01:08:42.545 --> 01:08:51.310]  And, uh, and of course, uh, the government controls the schools, the education process, they actually control the churches and the media.
[01:08:52.408 --> 01:09:11.405]  And you have hit it so hard over the years about how they are attacking our minds and trying to control our minds, and they do that by feeding us a lot of propaganda, a lot of lies, and so we have to overcome that.
[01:09:11.405 --> 01:09:20.153]  And today, we have an exciting situation going on in this country with all the tea parties, the Oath Keepers,
[01:09:21.042 --> 01:09:27.986]  Uh, the fully informed juries, uh, all these, uh, Sheriff Mack, all these things are happening right now.
[01:09:27.986 --> 01:09:33.350]  And of course, here I am at 81 years of age, and I'm getting to see all of this.
[01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:37.732]  I'm getting to enjoy, uh, what's happening.
[01:09:37.732 --> 01:09:48.219]  Uh, we the people, um, you know, the, the concept, the Declaration of Independence says that, uh, the government, uh, derives or just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:09:48.985 --> 01:09:57.029]  Well, if they can tamper with the minds of the people, then they can derive unjust powers.
[01:09:57.029 --> 01:10:00.990]  They get unjust powers, and we the people pay the bills.
[01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:05.192]  And that's what has happened to us in this country.
[01:10:05.192 --> 01:10:11.575]  Too much of our power, the people power, has been transferred to government.
[01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:14.856]  Now, government isn't going to give that power back.
[01:10:14.856 --> 01:10:18.318]  They're not just going to give it back when we say we want our power back.
[01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:22.604]  Uh, they're a greedy bunch, and they will keep your power.
[01:10:22.604 --> 01:10:25.166]  Uh, I'm seeing it happen.
[01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:28.909]  I'm seeing the things that are happening all across this country.
[01:10:28.909 --> 01:10:33.011]  And, uh, it's a real, uh, exciting time.
[01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:43.518]  Uh, in 1989, I wrote my little book, Walls and Our Minds, and I made the statement how that Germany was the first, uh, country to be conquered by the Nazis.
[01:10:43.518 --> 01:10:47.601]  And, of course, Germany paid an awful price for letting an enemy within
[01:10:48.894 --> 01:10:50.395]  I concur the nation.
[01:10:50.395 --> 01:10:57.944]  They paid the price of World War II because they allowed an enemy within.
[01:10:57.944 --> 01:11:03.170]  And of course in 89 I wrote about how our government had become an enemy within.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:09.906]  And that our future was somewhat cloudy.
[01:11:09.906 --> 01:11:25.263]  And here we are, 20 years later, and of course at that time I said that we would probably have an economic crash or meltdown and that would open the door and people would wake up.
[01:11:26.014 --> 01:11:29.937]  And so, Alex, we're seeing it, and what a thrill it is.
[01:11:29.937 --> 01:11:45.807]  But there's the added danger, though, that people are waking up because now the enemy is trying to fully implode the country so they can control it, and robbing us of tens of trillions of dollars a year, and launching all these new wars in our name.
[01:11:45.807 --> 01:11:52.411]  And so it's good that people are waking up, but they should be, because we're in very, very dire straits.
[01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:54.553]  Red Beckman, from your 50 years of study,
[01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:56.694]  Who runs the New World Order?
[01:11:56.694 --> 01:11:58.175]  What is the New World Order?
[01:11:58.175 --> 01:11:59.596]  What is this system?
[01:11:59.596 --> 01:12:01.617]  How do the central banks get so much power?
[01:12:12.743 --> 01:12:15.844]  Well, some people call them mattoids.
[01:12:15.844 --> 01:12:27.048]  They're mental cripples who think that they are far superior to anybody else and that they have a, well, they used to call it the divine right of kings.
[01:12:27.048 --> 01:12:30.930]  And our generations are no different.
[01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.231]  I've seen three generations now at my age.
[01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:39.473]  We have these people show up and they really belong in mental institutions.
[01:12:40.859 --> 01:12:41.859]  But we don't.
[01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:55.043]  We end up following them because they usually have enough propaganda and such to where they line up enough suckers to believe what they are trying to tell you.
[01:12:55.043 --> 01:13:04.945]  And of course, over the history of our country, we've had some of these people always trying to get a central bank.
[01:13:05.735 --> 01:13:09.780]  And of course, we've had a couple of presidents that said no.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.644]  They understood how dangerous the central bank is.
[01:13:13.644 --> 01:13:20.932]  Well, in 1913, of course, we got the income tax and the 17th Amendment.
[01:13:20.932 --> 01:13:22.394]  We got the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:40.932]  Because we had about 30 million immigrants in this country that had come from Western Europe, and they hadn't really assimilated to the point where they understood our language, our political system, and all of that.
[01:13:40.932 --> 01:13:44.914]  And they were too easily manipulated.
[01:13:46.063 --> 01:13:51.205]  That's how Wilson became President of the United States, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:13:51.205 --> 01:13:53.146]  That's what happened.
[01:13:53.146 --> 01:13:56.908]  And of course, we have somewhat of a parallel today.
[01:13:56.908 --> 01:14:02.710]  We have so many of these immigrants, and so many of them are illegal.
[01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:11.614]  And as I told you before we went on the air, I had recently written an op-ed piece.
[01:14:12.798 --> 01:14:41.273]  And I told Hal that the Roe v. Wade decision, the abortion thing, those first people that lost their lives in the abortion mill back there would now be 37, 38 years old in the prime of their life, of their productive life, and we have now murdered over 50 million, and that's our workforce that we eliminated through the abortion thing.
[01:14:41.974 --> 01:14:45.475]  And the globalists in many of their own documents admit that was their plan.
[01:14:45.475 --> 01:14:53.677]  Kill off the Americans, bring in the foreigners, then they'll pull the lever for gun control, big government, everything, and it's now happening.
[01:14:53.677 --> 01:14:55.618]  Yep.
[01:14:55.618 --> 01:15:00.759]  There was that vacuum in our workforce, and they brought in all these illegals.
[01:15:01.477 --> 01:15:01.917]  I don't know.
[01:15:14.765 --> 01:15:18.807]  Uh, we the people of this country, we're getting the short end of the stick.
[01:15:18.807 --> 01:15:28.412]  And we subsidize driving down our own wages, and with the consular matricula, on record, they will give unlimited numbers of these, uh, to citizens.
[01:15:28.412 --> 01:15:36.956]  Now other countries are duplicating what Mexico's done, to where they literally are godlike with all the identities they want, everything they want.
[01:15:36.956 --> 01:15:39.898]  It's a second set of rules designed to cripple the country.
[01:16:00.117 --> 01:16:01.277]  What's your home worth?
[01:16:01.277 --> 01:16:03.398]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:16:03.398 --> 01:16:06.439]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:16:06.439 --> 01:16:14.141]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:17:59.312 --> 01:18:03.875]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:04.776]  Number one.
[01:18:04.776 --> 01:18:08.218]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:08.218 --> 01:18:09.058]  Number two.
[01:18:09.058 --> 01:18:13.961]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:14.702]  It's true.
[01:18:14.702 --> 01:18:19.265]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:19.565 --> 01:18:20.386]  Number 3.
[01:18:20.386 --> 01:18:23.968]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:23.968 --> 01:18:27.891]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:28.692]  Number 4.
[01:18:28.692 --> 01:18:31.453]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:31.453 --> 01:18:35.136]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:18:35.136 --> 01:18:35.937]  Number 5.
[01:18:35.937 --> 01:18:40.080]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.843]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:18:59.775 --> 01:19:02.776]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:08.099]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:19:08.099 --> 01:19:10.160]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.162]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:19:15.162 --> 01:19:16.343]  How much do you want?
[01:19:16.343 --> 01:19:17.463]  When do you want it?
[01:19:17.463 --> 01:19:19.344]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:19:19.344 --> 01:19:20.425]  When will you need it?
[01:19:20.425 --> 01:19:22.626]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:19:22.626 --> 01:19:23.966]  Will there be any food?
[01:19:23.966 --> 01:19:25.267]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:19:25.487 --> 01:19:30.753]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:19:30.753 --> 01:19:34.338]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:19:34.338 --> 01:19:38.162]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:19:38.162 --> 01:19:39.403]  How much will you need?
[01:19:39.403 --> 01:19:40.284]  We don't know.
[01:19:40.284 --> 01:19:41.386]  How much do you want?
[01:19:41.386 --> 01:19:42.327]  All you can get.
[01:19:42.327 --> 01:19:43.148]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:43.408 --> 01:19:46.449]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.230]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:49.310]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:53.412]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:14.372 --> 01:20:15.893]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:15.893 --> 01:20:20.535]  The last 30 minutes, Red Beckman has been on, but this will be with us halfway into the next hour.
[01:20:20.535 --> 01:20:26.397]  We just started simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Video Color.
[01:20:26.397 --> 01:20:30.039]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:20:30.039 --> 01:20:34.241]  By the way, we're going to be adding a lot of new features in the next few weeks.
[01:20:34.241 --> 01:20:36.282]  I'm just going to leave it at that, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:39.283 --> 01:20:42.384]  So certainly, I look forward to that for all the great members over there.
[01:20:42.384 --> 01:20:49.686]  And of course, everybody can listen for free on your local AM and FM, shortwave, satellite, or the free podcast at InfoWars.com.

[01:21:06.992 --> 01:21:08.593]  Infowars.com.
[01:21:08.593 --> 01:21:12.477]  And don't forget, we fund our operation through you, the listener.
[01:21:12.477 --> 01:21:13.317]  You support us.
[01:21:13.317 --> 01:21:23.645]  When you buy a book, a t-shirt, that funds this 8,000 square foot office, the documentaries, the books, the live radio show, my crew.
[01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:31.091]  We are in the midst of finishing up our big TV studio next door and launching a whole bunch of new operations.
[01:21:31.832 --> 01:21:33.453]  I'm not risking my life.
[01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:43.201]  I'm not fighting 14, 15, some days 18 hours a day, some days 24 hours a day against the globalists because I think I'm going to lose.
[01:21:43.201 --> 01:21:45.522]  These people are dangerous killers.
[01:21:45.522 --> 01:21:46.863]  They run the planet.
[01:21:46.863 --> 01:21:48.264]  They do whatever they want.
[01:21:48.264 --> 01:21:51.206]  But history shows tyrants always reach too far.
[01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:55.470]  I wouldn't be fighting them and risking my life if I didn't know they
[01:21:56.533 --> 01:21:56.833]  Could they?
[01:22:11.912 --> 01:22:12.293]  I don't
[01:22:30.692 --> 01:22:41.079]  But I started waging war 16 years ago against the tyranny, 14 years ago on air, Red Beckman back in the early 1950s, and it takes time.
[01:22:41.079 --> 01:22:42.520]  And that's the number one message.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:50.106]  Now, going back to Red Beckman and then your phone calls and a lot of other issues, Red, I was asking you the question of the enemy's counter operations.
[01:22:50.106 --> 01:22:54.309]  I mean, I am shocked by how out in the open they are now.
[01:22:55.149 --> 01:23:08.054]  I guess that's hubris or false arrogance or a face they're putting on because they're internal documents from Cass Sunstein, the Congress, the UN, stuff they don't widely publicize but that is publicly available.
[01:23:08.054 --> 01:23:09.654]  They say they're in deep danger.
[01:23:09.654 --> 01:23:16.477]  They are freaking out saying we've got to go with shutting down web, arresting people that criticize government.
[01:23:16.477 --> 01:23:23.920]  We've got to go to a hot tyranny, not a cold incremental tyranny, which is good because the cold incremental tyranny is hard to beat.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:30.881]  Because it sneaks around, like Cicero said, inside your gates.
[01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:34.362]  I like it that they're coming right out in the open.
[01:23:34.362 --> 01:23:37.323]  And so why do you think they're openly announcing world government?
[01:23:37.323 --> 01:23:43.904]  Why do you think they're openly shifting from denying all this to admitting it, but putting their spin on it?
[01:23:43.904 --> 01:23:47.225]  And how do you see them counter striking?
[01:23:47.225 --> 01:23:50.446]  Well, you know, I think that so much of this is
[01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.451]  Uh, the Spin Masters, of course.
[01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:57.652]  Uh, they're just paid.
[01:23:57.652 --> 01:24:01.273]  These are people that are paid to come up with all this stuff.
[01:24:01.273 --> 01:24:05.935]  I think that they're in a state of terror.
[01:24:05.935 --> 01:24:07.836]  Uh, they're looking for a place to hide.
[01:24:07.836 --> 01:24:14.798]  Uh, they're, uh, you know, everything is going backwards for them.
[01:24:14.798 --> 01:24:16.899]  They're not getting the job done.
[01:24:16.899 --> 01:24:18.219]  They're not getting the guns.
[01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.680]  They're not going to get the guns.
[01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:28.495]  I mean, they might get what comes out the end of the barrel of the gun, but they're not going to get the gun itself.
[01:24:28.495 --> 01:24:45.707]  And I think that, you know, 9-1-1, they were able to, you know, fool the American people initially into thinking it was those foreigners, those aliens.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:52.606]  That had pulled us off of taking control of those planes and flying into the World Trade Center.
[01:24:52.606 --> 01:24:57.590]  How many Americans today are there that still believe that?
[01:24:57.590 --> 01:25:00.072]  Very, very, very few.
[01:25:00.072 --> 01:25:10.241]  And what we have is we've got hundreds of people all over this nation that are trying to put the pieces together.
[01:25:10.241 --> 01:25:12.643]  They're collecting the evidence.
[01:25:12.643 --> 01:25:12.903]  And, uh,
[01:25:14.134 --> 01:25:20.298]  I would dare say that there's some people out there that pull that off.
[01:25:20.298 --> 01:25:23.459]  They're right here in this country.
[01:25:23.459 --> 01:25:24.800]  They've got an escape hatch.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.403]  They'll fly to some other country or something when it gets too hot, but they're still here.
[01:25:30.403 --> 01:25:38.508]  But I would dare say they kind of rub their necks once in a while, and I wonder if they kind of feel that rope settling around their neck.
[01:25:39.238 --> 01:25:53.423]  Because, um, if they take another, do another, uh, dirty trick like they did 9-1-1, the American people are not going to sit still for any more of their false flags.
[01:25:53.423 --> 01:25:55.383]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:25:55.383 --> 01:26:05.727]  And I think that what we've got going on in Iraq and Afghanistan right now, I think that the military, uh, they're, um,
[01:26:07.113 --> 01:26:08.994]  They're doing some thinking on their own.
[01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:13.917]  They're not depending on Obama to give them a sense of direction.
[01:26:13.917 --> 01:26:19.981]  I think they are getting along with the Iraqi people like they have never done.
[01:26:19.981 --> 01:26:22.523]  They're getting along with the Afghans.
[01:26:22.523 --> 01:26:34.391]  If you're reading between the lines, and even not always between the lines, we're getting a different picture coming from both Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:26:35.037 --> 01:26:48.360]  Because I think our military, I think they, we've got some people in there that have enough smarts to recognize that we cannot finance all these wars out there such as we've been doing.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:27:01.983]  Well the attempt is to bankrupt the nation, it's to bankrupt the states, to the bankers who made all this money out of fiat thin air and want to bankrupt us just like a local bank wants to bankrupt the farmer, they want the land.
[01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:02.183]  Sure.
[01:27:03.670 --> 01:27:11.716]  And, uh, but, uh, I'll tell ya, um, uh, it's coming to an end, and coming very, very rapidly.
[01:27:11.716 --> 01:27:16.620]  Uh, much faster than I would have ever, uh, thought that it could happen.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:31.811]  Uh, because I see it happening, uh, oh, the last time I was on your show, several months ago, I, you know, uh, you, you put my address on there, and we said, anybody that sends a five dollar bill, we'll send them a copy of that little book, Walls on Our Minds.
[01:27:32.825 --> 01:27:35.107]  We sent out hundreds of them.
[01:27:35.107 --> 01:27:39.390]  We had never... I've done hundreds of talk shows and I have never...
[01:27:40.502 --> 01:27:45.625]  Never had the response that we had from that show.
[01:27:45.625 --> 01:27:50.667]  We were on, I was on for at least an hour, I think, but we got a tremendous response.
[01:27:50.667 --> 01:28:01.953]  Which is another indicator of how large the radio show's gotten, but how active the people are and how hungry they are for information.
[01:28:01.953 --> 01:28:05.055]  Red, so much other stuff is going on.
[01:28:07.356 --> 01:28:07.917]  That's right.
[01:28:24.563 --> 01:28:29.105]  I even had the head of the American Legion on speaking out against it.
[01:28:29.105 --> 01:28:31.646]  But then they spin it and say the troops are angry.
[01:28:31.646 --> 01:28:34.567]  They say Obama isn't waging enough wars.
[01:28:34.567 --> 01:28:40.390]  They say Obama isn't giving them the surge they need, which is total false reality.
[01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:41.970]  The troops know we're going bankrupt.
[01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:43.031]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:28:43.031 --> 01:28:44.351]  They know it's a lie.
[01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:45.852]  They don't want to be there.
[01:28:45.852 --> 01:28:52.235]  But the media creates this fake spin that Obama's a liberal against the war when he's actually expanding it.
[01:28:59.858 --> 01:29:03.961]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:06.823]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:29:06.823 --> 01:29:08.924]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:29:08.924 --> 01:29:11.166]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:29:11.166 --> 01:29:12.827]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:29:12.827 --> 01:29:17.130]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:29:47.662 --> 01:29:49.584]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:29:59.622 --> 01:30:04.164]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.164 --> 01:30:05.085]  Number one.
[01:30:05.085 --> 01:30:08.506]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.506 --> 01:30:09.367]  Number two.
[01:30:09.367 --> 01:30:14.249]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.249 --> 01:30:15.009]  It's true.
[01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:19.872]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:19.872 --> 01:30:20.332]  Number three.
[01:30:20.692 --> 01:30:24.275]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.275 --> 01:30:28.998]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.998 --> 01:30:31.760]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.223]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:40.366]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.366 --> 01:30:45.130]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:49.594]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:49.594 --> 01:30:51.376]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:51.376 --> 01:30:53.618]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:53.618 --> 01:30:55.981]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.363 --> 01:31:05.326]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:14.193]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:14.193 --> 01:31:18.816]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:18.816 --> 01:31:29.645]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:30.265 --> 01:31:39.768]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:39.768 --> 01:31:45.210]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:52.693]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:52.693 --> 01:31:55.434]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:32:00.572 --> 01:32:04.575]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:04.575 --> 01:32:07.817]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:07.817 --> 01:32:12.621]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:12.621 --> 01:32:19.025]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.025 --> 01:32:21.267]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:21.767 --> 01:32:22.087]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:22.087 --> 01:32:22.608]  Bernanke?
[01:32:22.608 --> 01:32:23.409]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:23.409 --> 01:32:24.570]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:26.812]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:40.686 --> 01:32:42.547]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:32:42.547 --> 01:32:47.970]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:32:47.970 --> 01:33:00.778]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:00.778 --> 01:33:02.319]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:02.319 --> 01:33:04.380]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.582]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:11.039 --> 01:33:13.800]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:34.546]  Well, Red Beckman is just going to be with us for the rest of the hour, and I want to start getting to your phone calls with our guest, but Red, you were trying to make a point
[01:33:36.345 --> 01:33:40.008]  Well, if we're in a revolution, it's the third.
[01:34:07.046 --> 01:34:07.666]  I don't
[01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:34.839]  Some of those people back there in that generation who also thought that they were smart enough to where they could rule and the rest of us would be their servants.
[01:34:34.839 --> 01:34:41.361]  And so, through subversion, and it comes down, you can trace it all the way down through our history.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:54.183]  The Civil War was an absolute atrocity that was perpetrated by some of these so-called very wise people, smart people.
[01:34:54.183 --> 01:35:01.666]  Well it's on record that the Rothschilds and the British, I mean it's mainline history, manipulated both sides to have the war.
[01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:04.006]  There wasn't a good side or a bad side.
[01:35:04.006 --> 01:35:06.367]  It was all manipulated to try to break the country up.
[01:35:06.966 --> 01:35:31.708]  Right, and you can see it then, and of course as you come down through history, you can see that tremendous influx of European, West European immigrants coming into this country, starting about 1880 for sure, and continuing on until about 1910 or 1920.
[01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:33.890]  Thirty some odd million, they figure, came.
[01:35:34.642 --> 01:35:37.466]  And of course, they didn't learn the language that quick.
[01:35:37.466 --> 01:35:41.411]  They learned it, and they became great Americans.
[01:35:41.411 --> 01:35:44.455]  But they were so easily manipulated.
[01:35:44.455 --> 01:35:51.805]  And of course, like I said earlier, we got the income tax and the 17th Amendment, of course.
[01:35:52.438 --> 01:35:55.820]  And we got the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:57.140]  That's right.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.402]  Most of the first Americans really wanted to get away from tyranny.
[01:36:00.402 --> 01:36:06.605]  Doesn't mean they were angels or perfect, but they were pretty street smart, wise, and sly.
[01:36:06.605 --> 01:36:09.747]  But you get a bunch of people, say, from Germany, hardworking, great people,
[01:36:10.447 --> 01:36:13.190]  They were property of their local lord.
[01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:15.632]  You had the Hessians who were military slaves.
[01:36:15.632 --> 01:36:22.077]  You know, they don't teach that in school because supposedly only blacks were indentured servants or slaves, complete fraud.
[01:36:22.077 --> 01:36:24.819]  You had other people from Poland, people from France.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.702]  Absolutely, and it's all according to their plan.
[01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:55.632]  And here's the thing that I have said.
[01:36:55.632 --> 01:37:00.974]  I've had so many people call me over the years and just so concerned.
[01:37:00.974 --> 01:37:04.716]  They say, oh, they're going to bring in the foreign troops.
[01:37:04.716 --> 01:37:07.578]  And there might be a certain amount of that.
[01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:15.162]  But you see, that's where we reach these people, these foreign troops, when they come in.
[01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:20.545]  And they are going to be absolutely amazed at what we have in this country.
[01:37:21.443 --> 01:37:32.791]  No, instead, they're incrementally having drills with foreign troops and having foreign troops help run the command and control.
[01:37:32.791 --> 01:37:36.433]  But no, they're recruiting the boy scouts to be the paramilitary.
[01:37:36.433 --> 01:37:38.354]  They're militarizing the police.
[01:37:38.354 --> 01:37:42.137]  They're bringing in the immigrants and making them our police and our military.
[01:37:42.137 --> 01:37:44.118]  They don't need to bring in a foreign force.
[01:37:44.118 --> 01:37:46.540]  They're turning the force into a foreign force.
[01:37:46.946 --> 01:37:56.353]  Yeah, well, the thing is, we have to inform those people and they'll come over and they'll be on our side.
[01:37:56.353 --> 01:37:58.254]  In fact, that happened in the Revolutionary War.
[01:37:58.254 --> 01:38:03.378]  I know you know this, but tell folks about the Germans defecting en masse to our side.
[01:38:03.378 --> 01:38:05.660]  Oh, there was a tremendous number of them.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:09.463]  They were the English, of course.
[01:38:09.463 --> 01:38:13.626]  They hired the Hessians.
[01:38:13.626 --> 01:38:15.167]  They were German troops.
[01:38:16.085 --> 01:38:25.832]  And of course they're the ones that were the victims of George Washington and Trenton, the famous crossing of the Delaware River.
[01:38:25.832 --> 01:38:27.453]  I think it was the Delaware, if I remember right.
[01:38:27.453 --> 01:38:30.515]  It was Trenton, yes, it was Trenton.
[01:38:30.515 --> 01:38:40.642]  And of course, I just think that it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out how corrupt our government is.
[01:38:42.305 --> 01:38:53.611]  And as long as we're able to speak, and as long as we have our written materials out there and such, the whole world is watching us now.
[01:38:53.611 --> 01:38:55.972]  They're watching us very close.
[01:38:55.972 --> 01:39:06.458]  And I think that we've got more people out there in the other countries of the world that are cheering us on.
[01:39:07.537 --> 01:39:10.358]  They're all for us.
[01:39:10.358 --> 01:39:15.779]  They recognize that we have something here that they would all like to have.
[01:39:15.779 --> 01:39:22.260]  And they don't, you know, they don't like the central banks.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:25.521]  The central banks are in trouble all over this world today.
[01:39:25.521 --> 01:39:26.401]  Yes.
[01:39:26.401 --> 01:39:30.382]  And so, you know, the euro isn't doing all that great.
[01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:35.383]  The dollar, the only thing that's holding up the dollar at this point is the fact that the euro's having a problem.
[01:39:35.503 --> 01:39:38.284]  Well Red, think how far we've come.
[01:39:38.284 --> 01:39:41.805]  And now they go, okay, it's all real, what's the big deal?
[01:39:41.805 --> 01:39:49.267]  I want to go to phone calls, but coming up I want to get into your book, Why the Militia, with an encapsulation of what the militia really is.
[01:39:49.267 --> 01:39:56.470]  How do you stop infiltration, provocateur, false flag setups, and the enemy racing to put their cashless grid in.
[01:39:57.210 --> 01:40:02.531]  And so how getting back to rural communities, being self-sufficient, will defeat the enemy.
[01:40:02.531 --> 01:40:03.692]  It's like a cancer.
[01:40:03.692 --> 01:40:08.473]  It can only come into a certain, or it's like something with a run-down immune system.
[01:40:08.473 --> 01:40:12.274]  So we're going to talk about that as well, but are you ready to go to calls, Red?
[01:40:12.274 --> 01:40:13.554]  Oh, anytime.
[01:40:13.554 --> 01:40:19.576]  Okay, we're going to go to Brian, Nick, Trevor, Mark, Karen, Kenneth, and others.
[01:40:19.576 --> 01:40:21.516]  James, well James just hung up.
[01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:24.777]  Brian in Canada, you're on the air with Red Beckman, go ahead.
[01:40:26.212 --> 01:40:26.872]  Yeah, hi.
[01:40:26.872 --> 01:40:30.114]  I'm not in Canada, I'm actually in China.
[01:40:30.114 --> 01:40:31.735]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[01:40:31.735 --> 01:40:32.876]  Well, that's close enough!
[01:40:32.876 --> 01:40:36.558]  I mean... I misread it.
[01:40:36.558 --> 01:40:39.080]  The next caller's from Canada, but you're calling from China.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.061]  Go ahead.
[01:40:41.061 --> 01:40:45.083]  I just want to say that all of your sites have been banned here in China.
[01:40:45.083 --> 01:40:49.266]  I can't access any of them.
[01:40:49.266 --> 01:40:54.709]  And the only way I can access it is with a special program that, you know, deals with the proxy.
[01:40:55.862 --> 01:40:58.125]  I don't know if you know that.
[01:40:58.125 --> 01:40:59.688]  I don't know if you knew that at all.
[01:41:11.161 --> 01:41:14.404]  I haven't checked them out, but I checked Prison Planet and Infowars.
[01:41:14.404 --> 01:41:16.085]  They're definitely banned.
[01:41:16.085 --> 01:41:22.350]  Well, that's why... Why don't you take a screenshot of how it's banned and email it if you can even get it out of the country.
[01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:32.298]  What do you think of the announcements of the Italian, the Australian, the British and the UN that they want worldwide Chinese-style censorship?
[01:41:32.298 --> 01:41:35.941]  Well, I'm actually an Australian myself and I heard that, you know, Clinton is
[01:41:37.003 --> 01:41:42.708]  You know, asking for free internet, but at the same time, they're censoring it.
[01:41:42.708 --> 01:41:49.435]  I mean, you know, in England, you know, everything is logged and kept for over a year or something like that.
[01:41:49.435 --> 01:41:55.601]  Also, the so-called free government broadband for the public, that the public pays for, it's not free.
[01:41:57.003 --> 01:41:58.664]  Well, it wasn't that long ago, actually.
[01:41:58.664 --> 01:42:00.385]  It wasn't that long ago at all.
[01:42:00.385 --> 01:42:02.265]  You know, my father thinks that it's
[01:42:23.308 --> 01:42:42.043]  You know, they're trying to pick a fight with China, they want a world war, then they want a... You know, I worked my father up to this, 9-11, and he said for years, you know, that I was just, you know, just crazy, but after I showed him some videos, he's... And yeah, he's pretty along about it too now.
[01:42:42.043 --> 01:42:47.528]  So you're working in China, and you can't go to m4wars.com or prisonplanet.com?
[01:43:00.063 --> 01:43:05.370]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:43:05.370 --> 01:43:08.134]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:43:08.134 --> 01:43:13.481]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:43:13.481 --> 01:43:16.245]  Friends, I hope that you will order shadow government.

[01:44:00.506 --> 01:44:03.527]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:44:03.527 --> 01:44:08.850]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:44:08.850 --> 01:44:10.911]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:15.913]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:44:15.913 --> 01:44:17.094]  How much do you want?
[01:44:17.094 --> 01:44:18.214]  When do you want it?
[01:44:18.214 --> 01:44:20.095]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:44:20.095 --> 01:44:21.176]  When will you need it?
[01:44:21.176 --> 01:44:23.377]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:44:23.377 --> 01:44:24.717]  Will there be any food?
[01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:26.018]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:44:26.238 --> 01:44:31.504]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:44:31.504 --> 01:44:35.089]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:44:35.089 --> 01:44:38.913]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:44:38.913 --> 01:44:40.134]  How much will you need?
[01:44:40.134 --> 01:44:41.035]  We don't know.
[01:44:41.035 --> 01:44:42.137]  How much do you want?
[01:44:42.137 --> 01:44:42.898]  All you can get.
[01:44:42.898 --> 01:44:43.879]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:47.203]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:47:33.203 --> 01:47:44.076]  We launched our new free Alex Jones Radio Show app yesterday and it's already number 8 on the iPhone's app in the news section.
[01:47:44.076 --> 01:47:48.802]  At current rates it will eclipse by next week the number 2 and number 1 spot of the New York Times.
[01:47:50.444 --> 01:47:59.931]  The free app to listen how you want, when you want, where you want on your iPhone is at InfoWars.com, a link to the subsection so you don't have to search for it at the iPhone store.
[01:47:59.931 --> 01:48:12.321]  Of course, for over a year we've been listed as the top news radio talk show on Flycast that has hundreds of stations and shows, so you can listen on any cell phone with that system, but this is easy.
[01:48:12.321 --> 01:48:13.402]  Just get the app, you've got it.
[01:48:13.942 --> 01:48:19.023]  We're adding a news feature to it, news tickers, it's got an alarm clock, a bunch of other features.
[01:48:19.023 --> 01:48:24.064]  It's got a big back end we can add things to, it's already got a bunch of features, and that's free.
[01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:34.126]  About five weeks ago or so, we had Max Keiser on the show, and he was talking about learned helplessness.
[01:48:34.126 --> 01:48:38.006]  And he was reading from an article, Are Americans a Broken People?
[01:48:38.006 --> 01:48:40.807]  Why We've Stopped Fighting Back Against the Forces of Oppression.
[01:48:42.492 --> 01:48:55.024]  And then I had a chance to see Dr. Bruce E. Levine on Max's TV show, so we got him on the broadcast today because I've read so many corporate documents.
[01:48:55.024 --> 01:49:03.031]  One of the best examples was in 2001, they had a RFID summit in Chicago with Gillette, the Pentagon, and others saying,
[01:49:03.692 --> 01:49:16.104]  How do we force everybody to accept RFID in every can of beans, every razor, all your tires, tracking everywhere you go will make the real world like a Google searchable system where everything's tracked.
[01:49:16.104 --> 01:49:20.428]  And they said our internal studies show 87% don't want this, but
[01:49:21.747 --> 01:49:28.149]  It also shows we can create a sense of brokenness or desperation where they just submit once we break through these barriers.
[01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:29.909]  So they know what they're doing.
[01:49:29.909 --> 01:49:35.671]  And the naked body scanners recording you and your children's genitals, lying about it, saying they don't record it.
[01:49:35.671 --> 01:49:39.592]  Now it's admitted they do record it in the TSA's own documents.
[01:49:39.592 --> 01:49:41.813]  It's all about a journey into total enslavement.
[01:49:41.813 --> 01:49:44.654]  Now the chief of police in Austin takes blood without warrants.
[01:49:44.654 --> 01:49:47.354]  They do it all over the state of Texas.
[01:49:47.354 --> 01:49:48.735]  I mean, under a federal grant,
[01:49:50.057 --> 01:49:53.942]  In England, they come up and do random checkpoints and ask you if you're a terrorist.
[01:49:53.942 --> 01:49:56.085]  We're being bathed in tyranny.
[01:49:56.085 --> 01:49:59.771]  Bruce E. Levine, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and author.
[01:50:01.107 --> 01:50:02.027]  We've been decking it.
[01:50:02.027 --> 01:50:04.828]  We've had it really good for a long time and that always leads
[01:50:26.056 --> 01:50:26.696]  to weakness.
[01:50:26.696 --> 01:50:28.357]  We've been spoiled our children.
[01:50:28.357 --> 01:50:29.537]  We haven't gone through adversity.
[01:50:29.537 --> 01:50:30.697]  People don't appreciate things.
[01:50:30.697 --> 01:50:47.621]  I think the most important thing of a cornucopia of factors, and I want Dr. Levine to talk about this because I've read his writings and really think it's very piercing, and right along my own research just from studying this and watching and being part of it, the process of awakening people
[01:50:49.153 --> 01:50:56.161]  That Madison Avenue, and I've read Bernays two books, I've read many other books by the big modern fathers of advertising and propaganda.
[01:50:56.161 --> 01:51:02.868]  And most people know this, but they don't consciously put it into their decision making every day.
[01:51:02.868 --> 01:51:05.190]  And people don't think about it.
[01:51:05.190 --> 01:51:06.111]  But most people know.
[01:51:07.108 --> 01:51:12.570]  That Madison Avenue learned about 100 years ago to make you feel inadequate.
[01:51:12.570 --> 01:51:16.431]  So they choose a body type, on average, that women don't look like.
[01:51:16.431 --> 01:51:21.932]  For thousands of years, the full-bodied, voluptuous figure was the most beautiful in every culture.
[01:51:21.932 --> 01:51:22.673]  It's what I like.
[01:51:22.673 --> 01:51:23.393]  It's what men like.
[01:51:24.218 --> 01:51:29.683]  I don't like what modern porn has done in a lot of ways, but in one respect it has brought back the real figure men like.
[01:51:29.683 --> 01:51:35.548]  You know, the market has shown they don't want some skinny heroin head.
[01:51:35.548 --> 01:51:43.656]  But Madison Avenue chose that because then women will feel inadequate and they can sell them all the cosmetics, the drugs, the diets.
[01:51:43.656 --> 01:51:49.381]  Edward Bernays, you know, they had women with cigarettes at rallies, they paid them to smoke cigarettes.
[01:51:52.245 --> 01:51:52.926]  We're good to go.
[01:52:06.522 --> 01:52:21.349]  They make you feel inadequate, men, women, then they can give you a false image of what it is to be a strong man or woman, which actually makes you feel even less empowered, and then people just keep doing more and more of what the system says, and so people don't see themselves as leaders.
[01:52:21.349 --> 01:52:23.950]  They don't see themselves as trailblazers.
[01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:33.374]  Our role models aren't inventors and civil rights activists and scientists and trailblazers and explorers, as America's
[01:52:35.083 --> 01:52:35.423]  I don't
[01:52:55.962 --> 01:53:01.348]  One out of 10,000 are going to be able to do, or maybe one out of a million in some cases, be a movie star.
[01:53:01.348 --> 01:53:04.011]  And so people feel pathetic about themselves.
[01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:06.433]  So how could they stand up and be leaders?
[01:53:06.433 --> 01:53:08.375]  Going back to Dr. Levine.
[01:53:08.375 --> 01:53:08.816]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:53:09.318 --> 01:53:14.362]  Yeah, I mean, I think there's two really insidious forces working at the same time.
[01:53:14.362 --> 01:53:25.992]  One is that there's, you know, what you're talking about, just kind of making people feel bad about their basic humanity, you know, pathologizing, medicalizing, diseasing, doing all these kinds of things.
[01:53:26.252 --> 01:53:26.332]  Yes.
[01:53:44.053 --> 01:53:48.396]  Kind of compliant population who feel lousy about themselves.
[01:53:48.396 --> 01:53:56.022]  So it's in the total interest of the kind of corporate authoritarian kind of society that we have here, that that gets spread.
[01:53:56.022 --> 01:54:00.906]  And that's why it will not be confronted in any kind of mass media.
[01:54:00.906 --> 01:54:07.411]  I mean, for the obvious thing is that they're being supported by commercials, by all these kinds of different companies that are selling it.
[01:54:07.411 --> 01:54:09.953]  But on another level, it won't be confronted by any
[01:54:10.373 --> 01:54:13.934]  Is this not a corporate psychological dictatorship we're living under?
[01:54:24.594 --> 01:54:26.655]  Well, it has been for a pretty long time.
[01:54:26.655 --> 01:54:29.115]  I'll give you one little story here.
[01:54:29.115 --> 01:54:43.139]  The actual father of the American Psychiatric Association, literally, I mean, if you took a look at their image, their, you know, that adorns the American Psychiatric Association seal, it's a guy named Dr. Benjamin Rush.
[01:54:43.139 --> 01:54:44.300]  You know, he's like signed the
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.341]  The Declaration of Independence, and so he's, you know, they're real proud of him.
[01:54:48.341 --> 01:54:55.703]  Well, what this guy did was, in addition to many other crazy treatments that killed a lot of people... Including George Washington!
[01:54:55.703 --> 01:54:57.243]  Including George Washington.
[01:54:57.243 --> 01:54:57.924]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:57.924 --> 01:55:05.866]  I mean, one of his illnesses that he came up with was something called anarchy, which he defined as, quote, an excessive passion for liberty.
[01:55:06.446 --> 01:55:09.048]  And it constituted for him a form of insanity.
[01:55:09.048 --> 01:55:25.240]  So for him, certainly anybody at the time who was upset about the American Revolution going in the way of a more centralized, totalitarian kind of society that we've ended up with here today, anybody who confronted that, they had some kind of disease called anarchy.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.382]  And throughout the whole history of my profession, you'll see that.
[01:55:29.382 --> 01:55:46.372]  And so today, I mean, more and more people, I used to say this, and guys like you who are interviewing me, they think I'm making this up, that I'm being sarcastic, but more and more people are hip to the idea that there actually is an illness today in my business called oppositional defiant disorder, ODD.
[01:55:46.372 --> 01:55:51.615]  And this is not an arcane diagnosis as it's given often, and kids are behaviorally modified.
[01:55:51.715 --> 01:55:52.617]  No, no, no, no.
[01:55:52.617 --> 01:55:56.123]  John Gartner on the phone was basically telling me I had this.
[01:55:56.123 --> 01:55:57.746]  That you had ODD?
[01:55:57.746 --> 01:56:01.192]  Yeah, I mean, basically, I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah, and schizophrenic.
[01:56:02.183 --> 01:56:09.049]  Well, let me tell your audience, I would doubt that there's one member of your audience there who does not have the symptoms of ODD.
[01:56:09.049 --> 01:56:10.590]  I sure as heck am proud to have it.
[01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:15.474]  I mean, some of the symptoms that they call an illness are, one, often argues with adults.
[01:56:15.474 --> 01:56:18.656]  Two, often refuses to comply with adults.
[01:56:18.656 --> 01:56:21.859]  I mean, you know, often gets upset and angry with adults.
[01:56:21.859 --> 01:56:24.341]  I mean, these are the symptoms of an illness.
[01:56:24.341 --> 01:56:26.162]  And, you know, that's the most obvious.
[01:56:27.783 --> 01:56:33.065]  Um, so-called psychiatric, you know, so-called illnesses, that it's clearly a form of rebellion.
[01:56:33.065 --> 01:56:46.469]  But if you take a look at almost everything else that has been labeled as a illness or a pathology or, you know, throughout the history of my business, it's really either an overt or a covert form of rebellion.
[01:56:46.469 --> 01:56:54.952]  And of course, there's much more money to be made by labeling an illness, especially nowadays when you drug everything and pharmaceutical companies are making a ton.
[01:56:55.492 --> 01:56:56.072]  We're good to go.
[01:57:20.643 --> 01:57:31.592]  Absolutely, because the media always demonizes protests, puts them in free speech zones, hires provocateurs on record to engage in violence in front of news cameras, so they can then attack the peaceful crowd.
[01:57:31.592 --> 01:57:38.879]  We know that's how they're keeping people from getting out on the streets and involved, and they admit they're spying on everybody now, so there's this overall chilling effect.
[01:57:38.879 --> 01:57:40.920]  Doctor, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:57:49.909 --> 01:57:54.452]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:54.452 --> 01:57:55.373]  Number one.
[01:57:55.373 --> 01:57:58.796]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:58.796 --> 01:57:59.656]  Number two.
[01:57:59.656 --> 01:58:04.540]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:05.301]  It's true.
[01:58:05.301 --> 01:58:10.164]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:10.164 --> 01:58:10.685]  Number three.
[01:58:10.965 --> 01:58:14.548]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:58:14.548 --> 01:58:19.271]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:58:19.271 --> 01:58:22.033]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:58:22.033 --> 01:58:26.516]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:26.516 --> 01:58:30.639]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:58:30.639 --> 01:58:35.423]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:58:35.703 --> 01:58:39.870]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:41.653]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:41.653 --> 01:58:43.917]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:58:43.917 --> 01:58:46.261]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:53.392]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:58.714]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:58.714 --> 01:59:00.775]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:00.775 --> 01:59:05.778]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:05.778 --> 01:59:06.959]  How much do you want?
[01:59:06.959 --> 01:59:08.079]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.079 --> 01:59:09.960]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.041]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.041 --> 01:59:13.242]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:13.242 --> 01:59:14.583]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:14.583 --> 01:59:16.103]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:16.103 --> 01:59:17.164]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:59:17.304 --> 01:59:18.646]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:59:18.646 --> 01:59:21.368]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:21.368 --> 01:59:24.952]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:24.952 --> 01:59:28.776]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:28.776 --> 01:59:29.998]  How much will you need?
[01:59:29.998 --> 01:59:30.899]  We don't know.
[01:59:30.899 --> 01:59:32.000]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:32.941]  All you can get.
[01:59:32.941 --> 01:59:33.762]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.022 --> 01:59:37.064]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.064 --> 01:59:44.608]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:44.608 --> 01:59:46.469]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:46.469 --> 01:59:57.694]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
