[00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:19.464]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.270]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:31.799]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.880]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.342]  It is Monday, the 16th day of August, 2010.
[00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:53.498]  Coming up in the third hour, we have our once-a-month visit with Max Keiser live to break down all the huge announcements in the economy, like the Chicago Tribune reporting that government is preparing to take all or part of pension funds.
[00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:12.664]  We'll be discussing the Hindenburg Omen that we've seen time and time again with stock market crashes, with top analysts at major banks like Societal General saying that they believe there's going to be a major stock market crash in the next few months.
[00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:16.106]  There's also incredible developments dealing with Iran.
[00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:20.047]  The neocons are out in full force right now.
[00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:30.930]  Calling for war with Iran, and Ray McGovern, of course, a month ago said he believed that there was a very good chance the attack had been green-lighted for August.
[00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.834]  And now, unfortunately, it looks like they are seriously considering Israel launching an attack and then dragging the United States into it.
[00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:40.175]  That is all coming up.
[00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:50.141]  We have a special guest joining us who's only joined us one time in the past, about two years ago.
[00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.531]  And we were contacted again.
[00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.852]  And they are coming on the broadcast in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:01:57.872 --> 00:02:01.073]  But I will not announce the special guest until they are here with us.
[00:02:01.093 --> 00:02:05.195]  But this is very important and extremely newsworthy.
[00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:07.055]  This will be a news maker.
[00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:10.556]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[00:02:11.357 --> 00:02:14.158]  But Max Keiser joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:16.919]  Special guest joining us for one hour in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.774]  Let's go ahead and just read some of the headlines dealing with the
[00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.352]  Iran first.
[00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:40.272]  Reuters.
[00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:45.095]  Iran says that they are to push ahead with new enrichment plants.
[00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:53.540]  And the Russians are set at the end of the week to deliver the uranium, the peaceful uranium that cannot be used in weapons systems, to them.
[00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:59.984]  But the media is engaged in the West in a giant hoax saying that it is for weapons.
[00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:03.387]  Even though Iran has tried to give their uranium to Brazil,
[00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:07.568]  Turkey, France, and others for them to enrich the other half.
[00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:09.369]  The Russians have one half of it.
[00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:18.932]  They wanted to give basically all of their remaining uranium to the West and say, fine, you enrich it for reactors, knowing we can't then use it for fissile material and nukes.
[00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:22.994]  And their answer is, no, we're going to attack you.
[00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:25.309]  I don't know.
[00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:52.428]  And I looked him up and found out he was basically Israeli intelligence and had worked in the IDF and also worked at prisons in Israel.
[00:03:52.448 --> 00:04:00.291]  And that he was one of the main people pushing the disinfo on WMDs.
[00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:32.484]  in iraq in the lead up to that invasion uh... seven years ago in two thousand three and so when a ambassador from the neocons wants to visit you uh... you don't say no i i i knew i was being assessed and uh... interesting meeting to say the least and that shows you how we're under the microscope uh... here uh... with these people they would dispatch one of the chief neocons uh... to interview me
[00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.633]  A neocon preps U.S.
[00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:38.674]  for war with Iran.
[00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:39.695]  That's Ray McGovern.
[00:04:39.715 --> 00:04:44.560]  We're going to get him on the next few days dealing with the Atlantic writer Jeffrey Goldberg.
[00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:47.122]  Kurt Nemo's got a headline.
[00:04:47.202 --> 00:04:49.565]  Iran attack this week with a question mark.
[00:04:50.846 --> 00:04:57.132]  And we've got Fox News and others reporting that they're getting ready for an attack with Bolton.
[00:04:57.513 --> 00:04:58.013]  Hyping it.
[00:04:58.033 --> 00:04:58.454]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:04.386]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:08.332]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:10.916]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:16.344]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:23.046]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:28.988]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.110]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.572]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:43.396]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:46.778]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.378 --> 00:05:48.799]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:49.879]  It's here.

[00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:09.212]  We are on the march.
[00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.994]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:16.458]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:21.461]  It's Monday, 16th day of August, 2010.
[00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:22.742]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:25.504]  Max Geiser coming up the third hour with his monthly visit.
[00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:28.647]  Always informative in the third hour.
[00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:36.533]  Few guests give me butterflies, but this is a very serious person we've got coming on.
[00:08:37.873 --> 00:08:45.235]  In about 22 minutes from now, I'll just leave it as a surprise when they join us.
[00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:56.759]  But there couldn't be a better time to have this individual on than today with all that's happening in the world, in the Middle East, in Central Asia, Afghanistan, and of course, Pakistan.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.560]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:04.306]  Coming up in about 22 minutes from now.
[00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:10.827]  So, we see massive drum beating going on for an attack on Iran.
[00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:21.850]  And Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, said that he believed Cheney was going to stage a Gulf of Tonkin event three and a half years ago.
[00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.211]  And it came out six months later that he did just that.
[00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:26.871]  Tried to paint up U.S.
[00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:29.672]  patrol boats like Iranian boats to have them attack U.S.
[00:09:29.732 --> 00:09:30.052]  ships.
[00:09:31.727 --> 00:09:33.770]  So when he talks, I listen.
[00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:45.024]  And he said his intel is that they have more than 50-50 chance that they've green-lighted, to a certain extent, an attack to take place
[00:09:46.141 --> 00:10:07.792]  against iran led by the israelis in mid to late august well it's it's now mid-august it's now the sixteenth day of august uh... and uh... there is a full court press that iran is about to get nuclear weapons and may use them any minute it's almost an exact replay
[00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:23.907]  Instant replay of the propaganda that led to the bombardment and the subsequent invasion and the seven-year mass murder and slaughter and Wargaming a martial law training that Iraq has been used for kicking off of course in 2003
[00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:30.543]  So we are on the verge of something very, very serious.
[00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:33.805]  Iran has 70 million people, not 23 million.
[00:10:34.505 --> 00:10:44.432]  They have a lot more high-tech weapons, and they're better organized militarily and historically than Iraq, and will surely block the Strait of Hormuz, bare minimum.
[00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:54.719]  The terror attacks that are launched, whether manufactured or real, will be used to clamp down on the global corporate crime syndicates, real enemies, the people of the West.
[00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:59.262]  The entire architecture of their attack system is pointed at we the people.
[00:10:59.623 --> 00:11:04.807]  They just use outside threats as the smokescreen to launch these expanded takeovers.
[00:11:05.888 --> 00:11:10.151]  Iran will build uranium enrichment centers, nuclear chief says.
[00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:17.257]  Tehran, CNN, Iran plans to begin construction of 10 uranium enrichment centers across the country by next year.
[00:11:17.617 --> 00:11:22.041]  State-run media has quoted Iran's nuclear chief as saying.
[00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:32.287]  Continuing, here is an article by Ray McGovern from Consortium News posted at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:11:33.247 --> 00:11:35.547]  Neocons prep U.S.
[00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:37.408]  for war with Iran.
[00:11:37.428 --> 00:11:46.589]  I guess I was naive in thinking that the Atlantic and its American-Israeli writer Jeffrey Goldberg might shy away from arguing for yet another war.
[00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.910]  This one with Iran.
[00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.991]  While the cauldrons are still boiling in Afghanistan and Iraq, it's worth remembering
[00:11:55.441 --> 00:12:00.312]  How Goldberg helped to make the case for the US invasion of Iraq, for instance, the October 3rd, 2002.
[00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:18.119]  As America's war fever was building, Goldberg wrote in Slate, the online magazine, and he was put on all the big news shows, that the Bush administration is planning to launch what many people would undoubtedly call a short-sighted and inexcusable act of aggression.
[00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:24.581]  In five years, however, I believe that the coming invasion of Iraq will be remembered as an act of profound morality.
[00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:30.843]  Looking back on Goldberg's commentaries at the time, it's also a reminder of how many U.S.
[00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:31.643]  publications
[00:12:32.623 --> 00:12:38.146]  ...that are considered centrist, or even liberal, were bending over backwards to get in line with the coming invasion.
[00:12:38.926 --> 00:13:00.617]  Even earlier, on March 25th, 2002, Goldberg filed the pages of the New Yorker with a mammoth 17,000 word story, hyping Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's ties to terrorism, including Al Qaeda, which of course was false, and glossing over the ambiguities regarding the gassing of civilians in Kurdish city during the Iran-Iraq war.
[00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:10.750]  Goldberg's magnum opus entitled The Great Terror earned him high marks from other neocons and essentially made Goldberg's career.
[00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:16.813]  The story was also made to order, so to speak, for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.
[00:13:17.493 --> 00:13:27.717]  Presenting Goldberg with an award for his article, the overseas press club saw fit to note that the former CIA Director James Woolsey described the story as blockbuster.
[00:13:28.297 --> 00:13:30.478]  Woolsey, the self-described anchor
[00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:43.488]  of the Presbyterian wing of the J.I.N.S.A., the Jewish Institute for National Securities Affairs, has been a strong advocate for the use of force against any and all perceived enemies of Israel.
[00:13:43.848 --> 00:13:51.133]  Woolsey also is the prime manufacturer and the key disseminator of bogus intelligence on Saddam's al-Qaeda connection.
[00:13:51.593 --> 00:13:59.098]  The New Yorker article, while exaggerating Iraq's links to terrorism, Goldberg quotes Woolsey complaining about the CIA's alleged aversion
[00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:03.688]  to learning about Saddam's ties to Al-Qaeda, because it wasn't true.
[00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:11.294]  It is safe bet that Goldberg's prose under the subhead, the Al-Qaeda link, was inspired by Woolsey, but it gets worse.
[00:14:11.715 --> 00:14:20.783]  The details in that section came mostly from a drug dealer in a Kurdish prison, whom British journalists following up Goldberg's reporting quickly determined to be a, quote, liar.
[00:14:21.766 --> 00:14:29.069]  And then he goes on to talk about how Goldberg is now on television and in new articles promoting a new war.
[00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:34.671]  It is a lengthy, detailed report breaking down the history of this.
[00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:48.936]  This criminal war they launched seven and a half years ago, and it gets into how they're launching the exact same propaganda, just changing the last letter of Iraq with a Q to Iran with an N.
[00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:52.595]  The last part of the story says, pitching for war.
[00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:55.397]  Goldberg's mission this time, pitching war with Iran.
[00:14:55.797 --> 00:15:04.504]  This time Goldberg and the Israelis want us to buy into all of their propaganda without a valid major premise, their argument.
[00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:15.112]  Presupposes that Iran has made the decision to develop nuclear weapons and is hard at work on such a program, which is why they want Americans to believe whether there's evidence or not.
[00:15:15.813 --> 00:15:30.604]  The fawning corporate media, FCM, and the neocons who brought us the war in Iraq and, of course, the President himself, speak as though Iran has restarted work on nuclear weapons, part of their nuclear energy program.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:52.930]  Then he goes on to document how that is not the case, how they've tried to get their uranium enriched outside the country so that it can be proven that it's not weapons grade, how the Russians isn't anywhere near weapons grade, and how they're claiming now that when the Russians deliver this uranium that they're going to be able to have nuclear weapons so they've got to launch a new attack now.
[00:15:53.550 --> 00:16:01.753]  Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen and CENTCOM Commander William Fox Fallon have been living in fear of Cheney-inspired order to commit U.S.
[00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:03.353]  forces to war with Iran.
[00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:12.876]  Fallon actually had told retired Colonel Patrick Lang a few months before Fallon was removed, we are not going to do Iran on my watch.
[00:16:13.156 --> 00:16:13.456]  Fear?
[00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:14.616]  Yes, fear.
[00:16:15.077 --> 00:16:16.837]  An altogether sensible reaction.
[00:16:17.197 --> 00:16:19.378]  No commander worth his salt looks
[00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:20.798]  I think?
[00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.573]  On the one hand, in carrying out an order that he knows to be faithfully misguided.
[00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:57.158]  On the other, good sense prevailed over Cheney's strong objections and Bush sent Mullen to Israel in June 2008 with intentions and instructions to warn the Israelis in no uncertain terms not to provoke war with Iran.
[00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:08.835]  And now he goes into how they're rewriting history about what happened, claiming they went to Iraq to bring democracy, not that they went into Iraq lying about WMDs.
[00:17:10.036 --> 00:17:12.398]  Now, we've gone over that report.
[00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:22.745]  Continuing, here is the report from Kurt Nimmo at Infowars.com.
[00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:25.647]  It has the accompanying video clips in the article.
[00:17:26.347 --> 00:17:27.108]  Iran attack
[00:17:28.224 --> 00:17:28.752]  This week!
[00:17:29.994 --> 00:17:42.118]  Former interim UN ambassador and leading neocon John Bolton went on Fox News on Friday and shouted the alarm bells over Russia's pending delivery of nuclear fuel to Iran's Bashir reactor.
[00:17:42.538 --> 00:17:58.324]  If Israel plans to attack Bashir, Bolton said, it must act now because allowing the Russians to load nuclear fuel rods at the site will make Iran essentially immune from attack by Israel because once the rods in the reactor are in place, an attack on the reactor risks spreading
[00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:02.929]  Radiation in the air and perhaps into the water of the Persian Gulf.
[00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.515]  The fuel will be loaded on August 21st.
[00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:08.796]  This is the start of the
[00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:20.326]  Physics launch of the reactor said Sergei Nakov, a spokesman for Rostom, the Russian energy state nuclear corporation.
[00:18:20.687 --> 00:18:26.009]  From that moment, the Bashir plant will be officially considered a nuclear energy installation.
[00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:34.434]  Russia is currently operating under a $1 billion contract with Iran and has worked for over a decade on the reactor that I would add is peaceful.
[00:18:35.134 --> 00:18:45.437]  Scrolling up on the article, you can see the Fox News propaganda piece where they are preparing the public for this new war.
[00:18:46.238 --> 00:18:54.000]  As a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has the right to build nuclear reactors for its chival energy needs.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.322]  By the way, they import just about half their gasoline because they don't have the refineries.
[00:19:00.342 --> 00:19:01.062]  They're too expensive.
[00:19:01.082 --> 00:19:03.183]  They have lots of oil, but not enough refineries.
[00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:04.491]  Yes.
[00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:19.751]  That's right.
[00:19:40.788 --> 00:19:50.050]  So they are talking about needing to strike Iran in the next six to seven days before they load the fuel rods.
[00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:58.673]  Because if you bomb an active nuclear site, it will create something bigger than Chernobyl and rain down radiation all over Asia.
[00:20:00.495 --> 00:20:04.959]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:13.826]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:20:39.207 --> 00:20:39.748]  That's right.

[00:21:01.987 --> 00:21:06.890]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:07.771 --> 00:21:18.559]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:27.395]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:28.095 --> 00:21:31.796]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.

[00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:56.986]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:02.839]  You've got your gold, water filters and storable food.

[00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:32.384]  Did somebody say stills?
[00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:35.866]  That's how Grandpappy made his own sour mash and you can too!
[00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:40.168]  Revenure stills can be used to make brandies, liquors, whiskey, vodka and more.

[00:22:56.756 --> 00:22:58.477]  Fine quality alcohol stills.
[00:23:00.038 --> 00:23:02.418]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:11.302]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.

[00:23:24.828 --> 00:23:37.738]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly, beneficial settlements, manageable monthly payments, and quick restoration of credit are more easily attained, potentially saving you thousands of dollars in interest charges, fees, and unpaid debt.
[00:23:37.878 --> 00:23:38.878]  Don't procrastinate!

[00:23:49.505 --> 00:23:49.545]  800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:49.765]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[00:24:11.021 --> 00:24:12.061]  We are back live.
[00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:15.782]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[00:24:17.962 --> 00:24:28.424]  We will talk more later in the broadcast about the situation with Iran, but I did want to get into a press release put out by Harvard University.
[00:24:29.465 --> 00:24:34.066]  Harvard University Fund sells all Israeli holdings.
[00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:40.507]  Any holdings, any investments in Israeli-based companies, Harvard has sold them.
[00:24:41.468 --> 00:24:45.331]  And is moving more into communist Chinese holdings.
[00:24:46.912 --> 00:24:57.021]  All these major universities, just like other quasi-governmental institutions, like the University of Texas at Austin, have tens of billions of dollars of investments.
[00:24:58.647 --> 00:25:05.269]  And a lot of these investments, of course, they were pushed into buying by Bernie Madoff and others.
[00:25:05.989 --> 00:25:10.250]  But in another blow to Israeli shares, the Harvard Management Company notified the U.S.
[00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:17.712]  Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, on Friday that it had sold all its holdings in Israeli companies during the second quarter of 2010.
[00:25:19.353 --> 00:25:24.174]  What's going to happen to Israeli companies if World War III starts in the Middle East with Iran?
[00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:27.409]  No reason for the sale was mentioned.
[00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:30.951]  The Harvard Management Company manages Harvard University's endowment.
[00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:38.736]  Harvard Management Company stated that it's in its 13-F form that it sold 483,590 shares in Teva Pharmacological Industries, LTD, Nice Systems,
[00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:54.413]  Checkpoint Software Technologies, Partner Communications, Celacom Israeli, and a whole bunch of other companies.
[00:25:54.714 --> 00:26:10.601]  Harvard Management Company, 13-F form shows some investing trends in its largest holdings, each worth $295 million or iShares ETFs, one with Chinese equities and the other on emerging markets.
[00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:14.223]  Harvard also owns $181 million in Brazilian ETF.
[00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:17.621]  So that's some of the other foreign holdings.
[00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:20.022]  They have billions and billions in their endowment.
[00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:24.663]  Last time I checked, UT, it was over $50 billion in their endowment.
[00:26:25.143 --> 00:26:30.824]  But they're raising the tuition cost, and raising parking fees, and raising the dorm cost.
[00:26:31.064 --> 00:26:32.424]  All these major universities are.
[00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:39.226]  And you go get a $100,000 degree, and then it's near worthless for you.
[00:26:40.069 --> 00:26:48.173]  So we'll be talking more about that, but why would Harvard and many other institutions be completely divesting in Israel?
[00:26:50.333 --> 00:27:04.920]  Well, because a full-out war in the Middle East, Israel is sure to be attacked by Syria, by Lebanon, and by other countries in the region as part of a large war, and even if Israel comes out victorious using their nuclear weapons.
[00:27:05.931 --> 00:27:12.133]  It is going to destroy much of the industry and terrorism in that region.
[00:27:13.073 --> 00:27:19.015]  But Obama and the globalists, to get their world government established, need this political smokescreen.
[00:27:19.535 --> 00:27:30.238]  Because in Israel and the United States and England, if we're in a major war, most people will still rally around the government as if it is the flag, as if it is the country.
[00:27:30.738 --> 00:27:36.019]  As if that is what is patriotic when our governments have been seized by criminal interest.
[00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:41.881]  And what did Robert Shapiro and many others say in the last month in the Times of London and other publications?
[00:27:42.981 --> 00:27:45.162]  Including the Financial Times and Associated Press.
[00:27:45.202 --> 00:27:55.064]  They said Obama needs a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 event so that he can look strong and have a political distraction going into the November elections.
[00:27:55.884 --> 00:27:58.945]  And his approval rating continues to plunge every week.
[00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:05.372]  Within six months of being in office, he's now been in for almost a year and a half, or now over a year and a half.
[00:28:05.692 --> 00:28:09.434]  Been in since January of last year, so that's over a year and a half.
[00:28:12.275 --> 00:28:15.877]  Within six months, he had the lowest approval rating of any president six months in.
[00:28:16.217 --> 00:28:19.178]  Now it's the lowest of any president a year and a half in.
[00:28:19.458 --> 00:28:20.759]  He's breaking records.
[00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.471]  And their whole agenda is in trouble.
[00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:24.292]  It's all or nothing.
[00:28:24.312 --> 00:28:37.160]  They've committed so many crimes, with looting pension funds, and tens of trillions in bailouts to private banks, and all the no-bid contracts, and the four-plus trillion missing at the Pentagon under Clinton, Bush, and now Obama.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.181]  All of their crimes are coming out.
[00:28:40.342 --> 00:28:45.445]  Patriots, anti-globalists are winning elections at the state and federal level, in every major primary.
[00:28:45.725 --> 00:28:47.887]  The establishment candidates are losing.
[00:28:48.652 --> 00:28:56.658]  The system knows there's a major political realignment happening globally, and they are panicking big time right now.
[00:28:57.479 --> 00:29:00.521]  So they want to escalate wars in the Middle East.
[00:29:00.621 --> 00:29:01.902]  They want to go into Iran.
[00:29:01.942 --> 00:29:03.303]  They want to bombard Iran.
[00:29:03.423 --> 00:29:05.865]  They lied for the last two years and said U.S.
[00:29:05.885 --> 00:29:09.308]  forces and Halliburton contractors were not in Pakistan.
[00:29:09.608 --> 00:29:13.211]  Three weeks ago, they admitted, OK, we've got massive contractors there.
[00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:21.499]  They need these wars as distractions and they're big payoffs to the military-industrial complex as well.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:22.961]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:24.402]  We're gonna come back.
[00:29:25.676 --> 00:29:28.638]  With a very interesting and informative guest.
[00:29:28.678 --> 00:29:30.899]  This is going to be a major newsmaker.
[00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:40.144]  Lieutenant General Hamid Gul will be joining us from Pakistan on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:48.889]  Of course, when the WikiLeaks documents came out, I said it looked like propaganda within those battlefield reports, and that's what the General says as well.
[00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:50.870]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.872]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.873 --> 00:29:56.571]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.192 --> 00:30:03.435]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.355]  Number one.
[00:30:04.656 --> 00:30:07.818]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.078 --> 00:30:08.658]  Number two.
[00:30:08.939 --> 00:30:13.502]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:13.842 --> 00:30:14.282]  It's true.
[00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:19.145]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:20.006]  Number three.
[00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:23.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:23.868 --> 00:30:27.551]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:27.771 --> 00:30:28.312]  Number 4.
[00:30:28.552 --> 00:30:30.914]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.315 --> 00:30:34.698]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:35.539]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:39.704]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:39.944 --> 00:30:44.709]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:03.229 --> 00:31:09.274]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:16.740]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:21.605]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:33:01.448 --> 00:33:09.153]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.752 --> 00:33:25.717]  Well, my friends, for the next hour, joining us from Pakistan is Lieutenant General Hamid Gul.
[00:33:26.577 --> 00:33:35.002]  You've seen the mainstream media say that he's, quote, quarterbacking and commanding all the attacks on our forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:33:35.022 --> 00:33:37.864]  Of course, from my research, this is not the case.
[00:33:37.904 --> 00:33:44.849]  He was the big hero, the Pakistani general, the head of the ISI, who led the attacks against the Soviet invasion.
[00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:48.832]  Uh, and let me read over his bio, then he'll be with us for the next hour.
[00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:52.056]  Hamid Gul was, uh, commissioned in the Pakistani Army in 58.
[00:33:52.116 --> 00:34:00.044]  He was an Armored Corps 19 Lancers Tank Commander in major battles, uh, on the front with India in 1965.
[00:34:01.946 --> 00:34:13.159]  During 72 to 76 he directly served under another top general as battalion commander when General Zia was the GOC 1st Armored Division and commander of the 2nd Corps.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.687]  It goes on, Gould was promoted to Brigadier General in 1978 and steadily rose to be commander of the 1st Armored Division.
[00:34:21.708 --> 00:34:35.471]  In 1980, Gould was then sent to the GHQ as the DG Military Intelligence under a top general, who then nominated him as the ISI chief, succeeding another general in March of 1987.
[00:34:36.011 --> 00:34:42.712]  He was later replaced by ISI commander by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in May of 1989.
[00:34:43.292 --> 00:34:46.773]  He was then transferred to commander of the Second Corps.
[00:34:47.513 --> 00:34:49.514]  In this capacity, General Gould conducted the
[00:34:52.392 --> 00:34:55.674]  Zarb-e-Moham military exercise November-December of 89.
[00:34:56.234 --> 00:35:02.277]  The biggest Pakistani armed forces show of muscle since 71 Indo-Pakistan war until now.
[00:35:02.557 --> 00:35:08.800]  So he's been a frontline commander and of course a general and the head of Pakistani intelligence and I won't go any further.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.241]  I've got a huge laundry list
[00:35:11.821 --> 00:35:13.263]  of things to talk about with the general.
[00:35:13.683 --> 00:35:22.672]  Two years ago when they had the Mumbai attacks, he came on the show and said the evidence shows it was staged by British, Israeli and US intelligence.
[00:35:22.732 --> 00:35:31.700]  It's now come out in the Chicago Tribune with the headline that US agent was the head of that attack.
[00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:39.963]  The head of Indian intelligence also said the West led the false flag attack to blame it on Pakistan and to get Pakistan and India fighting again.
[00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:41.984]  That's how they play them off against each other.
[00:35:43.284 --> 00:35:46.185]  Hamid Gul has also questioned the official story of 9-11.
[00:35:46.525 --> 00:35:51.567]  He's also going to give us his expert take on why the U.S.
[00:35:51.627 --> 00:35:54.948]  is, quote, failing in its war in Afghanistan.
[00:35:55.268 --> 00:35:57.749]  And he joins us now for a full hour.
[00:35:58.309 --> 00:36:00.630]  Lieutenant General Hamid Gul, thank you for joining us.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.021]  And thank you.
[00:36:02.081 --> 00:36:04.184]  My greetings to all your audience, please.
[00:36:05.186 --> 00:36:08.651]  Why did you agree to come on this broadcast, General?
[00:36:09.673 --> 00:36:13.419]  Well, basically because my version is not going out to America.
[00:36:13.439 --> 00:36:16.023]  I have been denied the visa to travel to America.
[00:36:17.181 --> 00:36:23.391]  And these people would not let me into America because they're afraid that I will speak the truth.
[00:36:23.952 --> 00:36:31.264]  People will listen to the truth and then they would find out that these people have made a mess of the American plans.
[00:36:32.592 --> 00:36:35.015]  They are actually deceiving their own people.
[00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:37.479]  The American generals are failing.
[00:36:37.539 --> 00:36:39.982]  The American intelligence is a disaster.
[00:36:40.503 --> 00:36:41.123]  And they know that.
[00:36:41.244 --> 00:36:42.605]  I will speak in their idiom.
[00:36:42.725 --> 00:36:46.490]  And because I've worked with them, I've done my intelligence course.
[00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.576]  You did not mention it in my career record.
[00:36:51.256 --> 00:36:55.581]  I did an intelligence course in Okinawa when I was a captain under the U.S.
[00:36:55.681 --> 00:37:01.767]  Army, and I know exactly where the failings are, and they do not want it exposed.
[00:37:01.827 --> 00:37:08.033]  But lately, I was quite concerned because I was on Fareed Zakaria's show, GPS.
[00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.574]  We're good to go.
[00:37:23.818 --> 00:37:27.379]  But he put out only six minutes of my version.
[00:37:27.399 --> 00:37:34.742]  So that is not fair, because I was informed, and especially the things that I said, which were stark realities.
[00:37:35.322 --> 00:37:47.227]  And he wanted, obviously, to keep the American people in the dark about these things, feelings which are going on in Afghanistan, of the American policy, of the American
[00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:52.374]  Military generals, they are failing in every possible respect.
[00:37:53.255 --> 00:38:03.784]  This is my academic position, and I am prepared to face any general in America, any people in the academia, that look, this is what is going wrong.
[00:38:04.044 --> 00:38:05.586]  I am a friend of American people.
[00:38:05.606 --> 00:38:10.690]  I criticize their policy, and they think that anyone who criticizes the policy is the enemy.
[00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.030]  This is totally wrong.
[00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:13.271]  This is a misperception.
[00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.512]  We work together with the CIA.
[00:38:15.552 --> 00:38:17.013]  We work together with the Americans.
[00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:18.874]  I have a lot of friends there.
[00:38:18.894 --> 00:38:19.774]  I respect them.
[00:38:20.434 --> 00:38:29.778]  And I could also, my advice could also be useful, even at this time, because nobody understands the Afghan society better than I do, because I've worked with them.
[00:38:29.798 --> 00:38:31.499]  I read their soul.
[00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:32.860]  I read their spirit.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.821]  And I know, I respect those people.
[00:38:35.301 --> 00:38:37.282]  I admire their courage and their valor.
[00:38:37.822 --> 00:38:39.504]  They have to be your friends.
[00:38:39.524 --> 00:38:40.424]  It's a period.
[00:38:40.504 --> 00:38:45.669]  I'm telling you, you cannot afford to lose Afghanistan as a friendly country.
[00:38:46.129 --> 00:38:58.279]  But unfortunately, the way things are going, if they are not handled properly, the future of Afghanistan would be hostile to America, which would neither be in the interest of Pakistan nor in the interest of America and its allies.
[00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:17.751]  But, General, it would be in the interest of the global crime syndicate known as the New World Order that wants to bring order out of chaos, that wants to create crises, that wants to destabilize Pakistan and Afghanistan and ship hundreds of billions of dollars of opium out a year to the streets of America.
[00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:25.496]  They think we're so stupid, they admit on Fox News that our troops help grow the opium in Afghanistan now.
[00:39:25.556 --> 00:39:27.177]  So, the reasons we're there
[00:39:27.737 --> 00:39:33.459]  We're publicly told one thing, but we're actually there for another reason, destabilization.
[00:39:33.479 --> 00:39:38.661]  I want you to speak to that and see if you agree, but first, you are live, uncensored.
[00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:46.264]  What do you want to tell the American people on more than 80 AM and FM radio stations and the number one internet radio show in the world?
[00:39:46.644 --> 00:39:51.846]  What do you want to tell the world about what's really happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan?
[00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:53.207]  Because just three weeks ago,
[00:39:54.227 --> 00:39:57.149]  They finally admitted that they have been lying and that U.S.
[00:39:57.189 --> 00:40:10.256]  advisors, troops, and mercenaries, Blackwater and others, have been operating illegally inside Pakistan in what I have analyzed to be a destabilization campaign.
[00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:12.197]  What's really going on over there, General?
[00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:26.563]  Well, we know that Blackwater, now operating under the title of Z Worldwide Services, and Dancorp, which is another such organization, they are called the security contractors.
[00:40:26.603 --> 00:40:28.525]  This is a fundamental fault.
[00:40:29.105 --> 00:40:38.798]  There are 105,000 security contractors, the troopers of the security contractors, operating in Afghanistan alone.
[00:40:39.318 --> 00:40:41.461]  And I guess there are no figures available.
[00:40:41.601 --> 00:40:45.226]  I think no less than 2,000 are operating inside Pakistan.
[00:40:45.866 --> 00:41:08.262]  No, this is something which ought never have to be done, because the reason is that the professional armies, when they start engaging the services of civilians, whose motivation is none other than making money and cashing dollars, then you can expect the kind of result that the Americans are getting.
[00:41:08.322 --> 00:41:13.005]  And American people, the taxpayers, they have to suck out a lot of money.
[00:41:13.025 --> 00:41:14.987]  A lot of American blood is going to waste.
[00:41:15.607 --> 00:41:22.092]  No, all this is a disaster, because you, and now the latest one is the WikiLeaks.
[00:41:22.652 --> 00:41:30.658]  In this, again, all the compilation that they've been doing, on which they have been basing their plans, I tell you it's a disaster.
[00:41:30.718 --> 00:41:32.199]  It's an intelligence disaster.
[00:41:33.167 --> 00:41:33.528]  Why?
[00:41:33.608 --> 00:41:41.895]  Because they have heavily depended on the security contractors for even intelligence gathering.
[00:41:41.915 --> 00:41:45.578]  Now imagine, how can they be such foolish people?
[00:41:45.658 --> 00:41:57.769]  I mean, the CIA, the FBI, and all the other, and to top it all, there is this Task Force 373, which has been indulging in massive civilian
[00:41:58.209 --> 00:41:58.769]  We're good to go.
[00:42:25.081 --> 00:42:25.461]  I think so.
[00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.291]  General, let me go back to something you said.
[00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:56.771]  I'm going to put it in layman terms.
[00:42:57.371 --> 00:43:06.855]  You have tens of billions of dollars in no-bid contracts going to DynCorp, going to XZ, formerly Blackwater, Blackwater Worldwide.
[00:43:07.495 --> 00:43:16.198]  They have an incentive to want the wars to continue and to be expanded because they're making billions of dollars out of it.
[00:43:16.459 --> 00:43:20.360]  So of course they're going to give intelligence to blame Pakistan and widen the war.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:42.617]  Of course they're going to give intelligence that targets civilians, knowing that there is the honor code in Pakistan and Afghanistan, just like there was in the past here in America before we lost our souls to a certain extent, that if you kill somebody's wife or children, they are going to kill you or die trying to kill you with this blood-honored debt.
[00:43:43.057 --> 00:43:44.338]  That's why they continue.
[00:43:44.378 --> 00:43:45.719]  And now they have the CIA
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:44:15.317]  and the army piloting drones from Virginia and they are killing quote in fact guys search this term no name terrorist if someone has a gun when everybody has guns over there you know so-called free country like America used to be and they are killing innocent people knowing it's going to stir them up and make them mad so they fight back then they can call them terrorist then they can expand the war then the contractors can make more money
[00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:18.206]  Precisely, Alex.
[00:44:18.266 --> 00:44:19.667]  This is exactly.
[00:44:19.707 --> 00:44:25.813]  You have painted it so beautifully and so vividly, there could not be a better explanation.
[00:44:25.833 --> 00:44:30.937]  This honor code is as old as the Afon Society itself.
[00:44:31.078 --> 00:44:36.182]  I mean, it runs through their blood for the past 5,000 years.
[00:44:36.683 --> 00:44:38.424]  And this is called Pakhtoonwali.
[00:44:38.464 --> 00:44:40.226]  Pakhtoonwali is an honor code.
[00:44:40.746 --> 00:44:45.049]  This evokes even stronger sentiments than the religion.
[00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:49.712]  Therefore, these people are not going to forgive all this.
[00:44:50.373 --> 00:44:55.536]  And I am afraid that we will have lost this region forever to America, to the West.
[00:44:55.997 --> 00:44:57.298]  And this will not be good for us.
[00:44:57.438 --> 00:44:57.938]  I agree.
[00:44:58.318 --> 00:45:01.961]  I think it is still time that we redress the situation.
[00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:02.982]  I think so.
[00:45:20.539 --> 00:45:27.941]  We're in a very big disaster for American reputation, for their honor, for their self-respect, and we don't want to have this done.
[00:45:28.001 --> 00:45:34.463]  I can assure you, I genuinely am telling this because American people are such noble people.
[00:45:34.923 --> 00:45:42.225]  Sometimes they say they are so gullible and they are so innocent that this borders on being criminally innocent.
[00:45:42.865 --> 00:45:43.986]  Well, I don't know.
[00:46:00.947 --> 00:46:04.450]  Well, General, as you know, this is the divide and conquer British model.
[00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:21.023]  You had Mohamed Mozadek, somewhat secular, pro-Western, but he wanted to build up Iran and keep some of their own money, so they used radical Muslims to overthrow him, then they put the Shah in and double-crossed the Muslims.
[00:46:21.823 --> 00:46:23.465]  Then, the same thing with the Serbs.
[00:46:24.005 --> 00:46:24.205]  I don't
[00:46:46.853 --> 00:46:49.116]  So there is a rhyme and reason to this.
[00:46:49.136 --> 00:46:54.262]  It's just so cold-blooded and so evil, the average person cannot grasp it.
[00:46:56.425 --> 00:46:58.167]  Yeah, that's right, Alex.
[00:46:58.307 --> 00:47:06.057]  I think America, American policy makers have, for their own reason, I don't know, I have not been able to fathom that as yet.
[00:47:06.937 --> 00:47:19.120]  But they have allowed the old British, what would we say, mischievous mind to lead American policymaking by the nose.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:28.302]  And I can tell you, I know them, I worked with them, I did my staff course there in Camberley in the UK, and I know them inside out.
[00:47:29.102 --> 00:47:31.324]  They are extremely jealous of America.
[00:47:31.344 --> 00:47:33.766]  They do not want to see America flourish.
[00:47:34.247 --> 00:47:37.689]  Inside their heart, they want to pull their leg.
[00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:39.171]  They make a fool of them.
[00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:40.972]  And they talk about it.
[00:47:41.052 --> 00:47:45.376]  They have coined jokes for the Americans.
[00:47:45.396 --> 00:47:49.940]  So this has to be done away with.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.161]  That is fundamental.
[00:47:51.521 --> 00:47:56.906]  The other power, which for its own reason, and those are very mischievous reasons,
[00:47:57.366 --> 00:47:58.166]  That is Israel.
[00:47:58.386 --> 00:48:01.607]  And Israel now is joined in by the Indians, unfortunately.
[00:48:01.627 --> 00:48:05.168]  So together, they form the club.
[00:48:05.268 --> 00:48:10.490]  That club, you can call it the extra or ultra-imperial club.
[00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:14.931]  This imperial club is responsible for a lot of problems in the world.
[00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:17.492]  And American people are exploited.
[00:48:17.532 --> 00:48:20.392]  They are the most innocent people on God's Earth.
[00:48:20.772 --> 00:48:22.413]  But they are exploited to the hilt.
[00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:36.825]  For that implementation of their dark impulse and their dark agenda, which is only a handful of people, there is a clique only, in my assessment, who are indulging in this exercise.
[00:48:37.509 --> 00:48:39.190]  General, let's get into WikiLeaks.
[00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:52.779]  I noticed day one that what the media focused on, out of 90 plus thousand documents, were documents, battlefield reports, as you said, fed by private contractors, classically unreliable, completely unreliable.
[00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:55.281]  It's like going to the devil, you know, for the truth.
[00:48:56.021 --> 00:48:58.043]  And it all points at Pakistan.
[00:48:58.063 --> 00:48:59.223]  It all points at you.
[00:48:59.624 --> 00:49:02.406]  It says that Hamid Gul, here's the quote,
[00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:05.047]  This is diabolical nonsense.
[00:49:05.187 --> 00:49:15.330]  And if this is the kind of intelligence that America is basing its policies on in this region, then God help America.
[00:49:25.265 --> 00:49:30.933]  Because this is totally false, it's fabricated, and I tell you, who are the elements involved in it?
[00:49:31.694 --> 00:49:41.668]  One, the Afghan intelligence, and good luck that Amarullah Saleh, who was an old communist, who was heading the intelligence setup of Afghanistan,
[00:49:42.608 --> 00:49:49.273]  And the intelligence service there in Afghanistan is still infested by the old communist diehards.
[00:49:49.954 --> 00:50:00.522]  And they have an axe to grind, especially against me as a person, because I was responsible in part for their ouster from Afghanistan, from their ouster from power.
[00:50:01.377 --> 00:50:07.080]  Then the Indians have joined up with them, and they also have things to settle with Pakistan.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.781]  They want to destabilize Pakistan.
[00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:15.045]  They're sitting on our back, under the shadow of America, and they're stabbing Pakistan.
[00:50:15.065 --> 00:50:22.009]  An ally, a friend of America, we have been friends, not now, but we have been friends right through the days of Cold War.
[00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:28.193]  Ever since Mr. Dulles, Foster Dulles, he framed the policy of defending Pakistan.
[00:50:28.693 --> 00:50:36.115]  We have been a very loyal friend of America, and we have given huge sacrifices to uphold that friendship.
[00:50:36.495 --> 00:50:44.157]  But unfortunately, the Indians would have us put down completely, and they would want Pakistan to be subservient to India.
[00:50:44.937 --> 00:50:47.698]  This is not acceptable to people of Pakistan.
[00:50:48.258 --> 00:50:59.173]  Now this is how WikiLeaks has been giving, of course there are only 180 reports with regard to Pakistan and my person.
[00:50:59.193 --> 00:51:00.755]  Eight times I've been mentioned in this.
[00:51:01.468 --> 00:51:22.467]  But I said to the CNN also, for heaven's sake, if you think that a 74-year-old general retired some 18 and a half years ago from the army and left ISI 21 years ago, if he's still responsible for defeating America in Afghanistan, which is inevitable because America is now
[00:51:23.367 --> 00:51:26.568]  They have to continue to defeat Afghanistan.
[00:51:26.588 --> 00:51:27.549]  There is no way.
[00:51:28.049 --> 00:51:32.090]  And I will speak about it professionally at a later stage if you ask me.
[00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:38.372]  So if they are going to record it in history, in the history books,
[00:51:38.912 --> 00:51:42.193]  What are the American future generation going to read?
[00:51:42.653 --> 00:51:54.457]  That the mightiest power ever in the history of mankind was defeated with the help of a retired 74-year-old general living in his house, a retired life.
[00:51:54.477 --> 00:51:56.098]  I mean, this would be shameful.
[00:51:56.118 --> 00:51:57.658]  They would be ashamed of it.
[00:51:57.898 --> 00:52:00.339]  Let the future generation not be ashamed.
[00:52:01.079 --> 00:52:02.700]  Speak the truth that you have failed.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:08.843]  You have failed because your own policy makers have not come up with the recipes that were required.
[00:52:09.664 --> 00:52:13.826]  Your own generals would not measure up to the task that was given to them.
[00:52:14.426 --> 00:52:25.512]  So why don't you accept the failure rather than rub the blame on somebody else and start finding scapegoats and those two scapegoats which would not sell in the market.
[00:52:25.732 --> 00:52:26.773]  Please, for God's sake.
[00:52:27.493 --> 00:52:38.680]  As far as I am concerned, I can tell you my future generation will be proud that he was responsible not only in defeat of one superpower, but in defeat of another superpower also.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.920]  But that's not the case.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.002]  I don't want America to be defeated there.
[00:52:42.402 --> 00:52:45.023]  I want them to exit Afghanistan gracefully.
[00:52:45.424 --> 00:52:50.627]  I don't want them to get involved into a running fight in Afghanistan like they did in Vietnam.
[00:52:51.047 --> 00:52:52.488]  Why don't they learn their lesson?
[00:52:52.928 --> 00:52:56.310]  And in Vietnam also, it's not too far back in history,
[00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.370]  I think so.
[00:53:13.096 --> 00:53:14.038]  And what did you do?
[00:53:14.198 --> 00:53:16.921]  I mean, they ran out from Vietnam.
[00:53:17.422 --> 00:53:19.704]  Why could they not have thought of it earlier on?
[00:53:19.784 --> 00:53:23.429]  And similar situation now confronts them in Afghanistan.
[00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:28.415]  So, from my point of view, being a friend of America, I won't.
[00:53:28.895 --> 00:53:29.075]  Okay.
[00:53:29.095 --> 00:53:29.596]  Uh, General?
[00:53:57.256 --> 00:54:01.479]  There will be no option left but to cut and run out of Afghanistan.
[00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:29.978]  Just a few weeks after that tragic event and you fingered Western intelligence for staging it to stir up enmity between India and Pakistan and as a pretext to bring U.S.
[00:54:30.018 --> 00:54:32.019]  forces covertly into Pakistan.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.801]  We now know that was the case.
[00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:43.427]  I want to show viewers mainstream news here in the United States including the Chicago Tribune and others admitting that quote the head of that attack was a U.S.
[00:54:43.587 --> 00:54:47.590]  agent and explain to people why they do this and but
[00:54:48.410 --> 00:55:06.524]  First, let's get into a basic boil down from your military expertise and expert on the region, what the real policy, what the real objective has been by the United States being used by these globalists inside your country and bordering Afghanistan.
[00:55:07.685 --> 00:55:08.565]  Yeah, nine years of occupation now.
[00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:13.048]  Nine years of this dirty war which has been going on for a wrong purpose, at a wrong time, in a wrong place.
[00:55:30.729 --> 00:55:32.191]  Now, what is the real?
[00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:39.438]  The declared or the stated goal of the war was to disperse Al-Qaeda to catch Osama Bin Laden.
[00:55:39.458 --> 00:55:45.184]  Now, lately, President Obama has come up with a new formulation, and that says
[00:55:46.565 --> 00:55:49.948]  That we have to reverse the momentum of Taliban.
[00:55:50.148 --> 00:55:51.549]  And who are Taliban?
[00:55:51.569 --> 00:55:54.331]  Taliban are resistance fighters.
[00:55:54.371 --> 00:55:56.052]  They are the Mujahideen of the old.
[00:55:56.072 --> 00:56:02.937]  I mean, they are the same people or their sons and daughters who fought against the Soviet Union.
[00:56:03.458 --> 00:56:08.321]  And they are fighting for the same reason as they were fighting against the Soviet Union at that time.
[00:56:08.802 --> 00:56:09.802]  What is that reason?
[00:56:10.163 --> 00:56:12.985]  That reason is to protect their way of life.
[00:56:13.565 --> 00:56:23.970]  Whatever it is, you may not agree with that way of life, but the point is, as you are jealous of protecting your way of life, they are jealous of protecting their way of life.
[00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:34.015]  The other is liberation, because they look upon the Americans and the allied forces as the occupation forces.
[00:56:34.536 --> 00:56:38.217]  And so they want to liberate, they will not settle for anything less than that.
[00:56:38.718 --> 00:56:41.019]  So really you are fighting the Afghan nation.
[00:56:41.659 --> 00:56:44.882]  Do you want to reverse the momentum of the Afghan nation?
[00:56:45.883 --> 00:56:46.864]  Is it achievable?
[00:56:46.884 --> 00:56:49.366]  In my opinion, it is not achievable.
[00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:51.067]  It is not worth it.
[00:56:51.507 --> 00:56:53.049]  First of all, it is not proper.
[00:56:53.109 --> 00:57:05.479]  It is not morally correct that you should be trying to state-jacket a nation, and a nation as proud as the Afghans, in a certain mold that you have visualized for them.
[00:57:05.499 --> 00:57:09.623]  This is immoral, this is incorrect, and it is not achievable.
[00:57:10.163 --> 00:57:35.983]  So the real aim, the hidden aim, the latent aim, I have been saying that before also, that was basically, A, for corporate America to install itself within the center of the oil rich area, the resources of the Caspian Sea Basin area, resources of the Middle East,
[00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:39.772]  B, to check China from moving into this region.
[00:57:39.792 --> 00:57:41.493]  That is the strategic aim.
[00:57:42.353 --> 00:57:50.218]  And C, to any new system should not emerge, because they are afraid that their system is a failure.
[00:57:50.778 --> 00:58:05.126]  And if any new system, based on Islamic principles of egalitarianism, equality, fraternity and freedom, if these principles are really adopted, then imperial power will have no place to hide.
[00:58:05.806 --> 00:58:09.369]  So, really, this was the second, third aim.
[00:58:10.009 --> 00:58:18.595]  And fourth one, unfortunately, and very unfortunate for America, is to provide a security shield to the state of Israel.
[00:58:19.336 --> 00:58:22.098]  And with that, they want to strengthen India.
[00:58:22.478 --> 00:58:34.286]  Now imagine, a country as big, as powerful, as enlightened as America should be acting to provide security to somebody else!
[00:58:34.346 --> 00:58:35.247]  For what reason?
[00:58:35.666 --> 00:58:36.727]  General Gould got a break.
[00:58:36.787 --> 00:58:37.927]  Back in 70 seconds.

[00:59:52.372 --> 00:59:54.293]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.753 --> 00:59:57.535]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.284 --> 01:00:08.445]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:09.906]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.686 --> 01:00:11.606]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.247 --> 01:00:15.908]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.428 --> 01:00:20.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.031 --> 01:00:30.993]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, for the last 30 minutes, retired Lieutenant General Hamid Gul has been our guest, former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[01:00:32.113 --> 01:00:38.799]  The Washington Post wrote, if the documents are to be believed, and the uncooperated U.S.
[01:00:38.859 --> 01:00:41.020]  intelligence reports must be read with caution.
[01:00:41.701 --> 01:00:46.265]  So they add that this is just battlefield reports fed by contractors.
[01:00:46.825 --> 01:00:54.231]  Ghoul has taken a direct hand in quarterbacking attacks against U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
[01:00:55.492 --> 01:00:58.234]  Ghoul calls the reports fiction and nothing else.
[01:00:58.315 --> 01:01:00.857]  So this is a guy, from what I've seen,
[01:01:02.062 --> 01:01:03.302]  Who's told the truth.
[01:01:03.682 --> 01:01:06.783]  I mean, I don't trust anybody except my wife and children and God.
[01:01:07.223 --> 01:01:17.286]  But I just go off long-term study, long-term looking at geopolitical systems, the British model of the great game that our country's adopted, how we're being used.
[01:01:17.326 --> 01:01:19.186]  I mean, for five years, U.S.
[01:01:19.206 --> 01:01:31.269]  troops and contractors have been sneaking around in Afghanistan, excuse me, nine years there, in Pakistan, and now they came out three weeks ago and admitted, okay, we lied to you, we got contractors and troops there.
[01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:39.316]  And, you know, Gould said two years ago on this show they were there to stir up the tribal areas to destabilize Pakistan.
[01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:40.637]  And now that's admitted.
[01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:48.764]  I mean, these global corporations that suck us dry with these wars, they have a motive to expand these wars.
[01:01:48.844 --> 01:01:51.827]  So, this is a short segment, General, but brief answers on this.
[01:01:52.127 --> 01:01:54.289]  Finishing up on Israel and the U.S.
[01:01:54.329 --> 01:01:57.792]  being used as a tool that you were talking about there, and then
[01:01:58.453 --> 01:02:08.721]  How can we get out of there on friendly terms with the Pakistan's folks and with the Afghans and versus how it will end if we don't pull out?
[01:02:10.463 --> 01:02:18.269]  Let me tell you that there is everything to be gained by pulling out and there is everything to be lost by continuing to stay here.
[01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:22.132]  So that's my judgment and I'm quite convinced that this is right.
[01:02:22.995 --> 01:02:36.126]  Now, by pulling out, you are going to, because there is a natural affinity between America and Pakistan and America and even Afghanistan, because, you know, they have cooperated in the past throughout.
[01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:37.828]  We have a long history of cooperation.
[01:02:38.628 --> 01:02:45.558]  When India was in the USSR camp, Pakistan was all along, and Afghanistan too, was in the American camp.
[01:02:45.638 --> 01:02:52.207]  Afghanistan made a mistake of being in the USSR camp, and USSR came and attacked it at that time.
[01:02:52.347 --> 01:02:53.469]  And of course they resisted.
[01:02:54.129 --> 01:02:54.929]  We're good to go.
[01:03:12.114 --> 01:03:15.036]  Go for a hearing before the Senate or the Congress.
[01:03:15.476 --> 01:03:17.758]  Whatever you want me to do, I am prepared.
[01:03:17.798 --> 01:03:28.185]  If I'm a terrorist, if I'm quarterbacking, as you rightly said, these attacks in Afghanistan, then you can catch me.
[01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:31.447]  I mean, here is a terrorist who is offering himself.
[01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:34.609]  He says, OK, catch me, hold me responsible.
[01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:39.973]  Take me anywhere, to Congress, to any court, to any interrogation center.
[01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:41.014]  I'm prepared for all this.
[01:03:42.546 --> 01:03:43.226]  They are lying.
[01:03:43.366 --> 01:03:46.687]  I tell you, they are lying to the American people more than anyone else.
[01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:54.769]  And if they have a change of heart, we will find ways and means when they can pull out safely.
[01:03:55.229 --> 01:03:56.389]  They will not be followed.
[01:03:57.069 --> 01:04:10.072]  Now, the speech that President Obama made on 8th of May 2009 in Cairo, addressing the Al-Azhar University, I think that was remarkable, because in this he had said,
[01:04:10.852 --> 01:04:22.458]  If there is no chance of attack or there is no threat of attack from that region to America, then in that case we are prepared to pull out every single troop from that region.
[01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:30.722]  And I at that time also on some of the TV channels, I said that this is a legitimate demand.
[01:04:30.862 --> 01:04:31.963]  Okay, we accept this.
[01:04:32.745 --> 01:04:35.808]  That there should be no attack on America from this area.
[01:04:35.868 --> 01:04:38.590]  That no one has ever been found in the past also.
[01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:50.900]  And that automatically means that the responsibility will be on the new government, which will be installed in Afghanistan, to make sure that there is no threat to American interest.
[01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.182]  General, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:53.943]  We've got to go to break.
[01:04:54.003 --> 01:04:56.024]  Come back and repeat that thought and finish it up.
[01:04:56.244 --> 01:04:57.846]  We'll be right back with General Hamid Gul.
[01:04:59.505 --> 01:05:04.368]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:05.249]  What have we got?
[01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.590]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:05:07.911 --> 01:05:08.631]  A republic.
[01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:11.513]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:13.474]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:15.736]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:05:15.856 --> 01:05:17.137]  So they think they own our land?
[01:05:17.537 --> 01:05:18.678]  They think they own our water?
[01:05:18.858 --> 01:05:19.258]  Children?
[01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:20.259]  Our education?
[01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:21.199]  Our money?
[01:05:21.419 --> 01:05:25.062]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:30.066]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:05:30.407 --> 01:05:31.227]  We have the facts.
[01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.529]  We have the Constitution.
[01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:33.469]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:05:33.489 --> 01:05:34.330]  We have common law.
[01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:36.632]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:40.676]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:05:40.776 --> 01:05:45.579]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.120]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:05:47.241 --> 01:05:48.081]  Don't tread on me.

[01:05:59.269 --> 01:06:03.491]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:03.811 --> 01:06:04.431]  Number one.
[01:06:04.731 --> 01:06:07.872]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.152 --> 01:06:08.732]  Number two.
[01:06:09.012 --> 01:06:13.554]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:13.894 --> 01:06:14.354]  It's true.
[01:06:14.654 --> 01:06:19.196]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.516 --> 01:06:20.056]  Number three.
[01:06:20.336 --> 01:06:23.618]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:23.918 --> 01:06:27.619]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:28.380]  Number 4.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.002]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.403 --> 01:06:34.786]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.067 --> 01:06:35.287]  Number 5.
[01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:39.792]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.012 --> 01:06:44.777]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:57.447 --> 01:07:57.887]  Thank you.
[01:08:00.188 --> 01:08:04.530]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future.
[01:08:05.311 --> 01:08:07.552]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.841]  This is not a new world.
[01:08:11.002 --> 01:08:14.324]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:22.890]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:30.715]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:08:31.869 --> 01:08:36.532]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:08:37.593 --> 01:08:39.695]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.036]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:41.136 --> 01:08:50.222]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:03.092 --> 01:09:12.681]  Well, we've been talking to Lieutenant General Hamid Gul about a host of really important issues and he's joining us from Pakistan.
[01:09:15.884 --> 01:09:24.693]  Last time we had him on, the regular phone number was being blocked and we were having trouble getting through on the other line.
[01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:29.419]  And it looks like we may be having some phone troubles now.
[01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:32.561]  We may try to reconnect with him in a moment.
[01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:33.502]  General, do we have you?
[01:09:36.104 --> 01:09:42.209]  Now again, I have researched all of this information in depth.
[01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:51.776]  And we've had the former CIA commander for the entire Afghan war on, who wrote the book Jawbreaker, and he admitted that they would pick up 12, 13, 14, 15-year-old kids
[01:09:55.032 --> 01:10:02.674]  And would send them to Guantanamo Bay as terrorists, knowing they were totally innocent, just to create this illusion.
[01:10:02.734 --> 01:10:13.377]  It's a manufactured war as a pretext to feed our troops into a meat grinder as a giant laboratory of control.
[01:10:15.518 --> 01:10:18.258]  And that's the bottom line of what's been going on here.
[01:10:19.179 --> 01:10:24.000]  Going back to General Hamid Ghul, General, I have looked
[01:10:25.379 --> 01:10:35.364]  at all of the information uh... concerned here and the clearly the pentagon plans to expand the war into pakistan they now admit that u.s.
[01:10:35.404 --> 01:10:46.270]  forces and contractors are there illegally uh... congress had been lied to about this where is all this leading and and what are the western forces doing in pakistan
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:56.606]  Well, they are on sabotage, subversion mission, and inciting people to rise against the central government of Pakistan.
[01:10:57.386 --> 01:11:05.812]  So, they are on destabilizing exercise, not realizing that this is going to hurt them more than it is going to hurt us, because we are in any case suffering.
[01:11:05.832 --> 01:11:09.995]  There is a state of flood at the moment we are facing in Pakistan.
[01:11:10.055 --> 01:11:13.637]  It is a great human tragedy that we are in the middle of it.
[01:11:14.609 --> 01:11:28.120]  And on top of it, our friends America and their allies, some of their allies, and India, they are in collusion to bash Pakistan and to really unravel it from inside.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.184]  This is very unfair and I don't think they will be able to do it at the end of the day.
[01:11:33.264 --> 01:11:39.810]  I think if they get embroiled in Pakistan, then they will keep on staying here for a very long time.
[01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:43.533]  And I don't think the American people have a heart for it.
[01:11:43.693 --> 01:11:47.316]  I think 60% of Americans are already against this war.
[01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:59.165]  And if they're going to expand this war, because I know one thing, the irregular fight that is going to be put up to Americans, whether in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Iran, now the
[01:12:02.362 --> 01:12:12.015]  Larger the area of conflict and longer the period of conflict, the established power, the one who is equipped with more firepower, cannot win.
[01:12:12.035 --> 01:12:14.619]  This is a lesson from history.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.602]  And it is immutable.
[01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:19.646]  Because if they enlarge the area of conflict,
[01:12:20.146 --> 01:12:20.526]  General Ghul.
[01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:42.556]  Where is this leading if the United States doesn't pull out?
[01:12:43.016 --> 01:12:50.638]  Clearly our government, controlled by these offshore corporate interests, wants to expand this into Pakistan with this destabilization.
[01:12:51.058 --> 01:12:57.360]  From your research, how many contractors are sneaking around in your country versus regular U.S.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:57.780]  forces?
[01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:06.659]  Well, I think the security contractors, at this moment, they are trying to spread their wings into Balochistan area.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:16.131]  And Americans have been granted permission, it is understood, to open, because they arm-twisted our government and our leaders.
[01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:17.091]  I think?
[01:13:46.911 --> 01:13:49.932]  And it's a long border with Iran.
[01:13:50.012 --> 01:13:53.833]  It is about 900 kilometers long border that we share with Iran.
[01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:56.174]  So it has twin purpose.
[01:13:56.414 --> 01:14:11.699]  A, to destabilize Pakistan and B, to get inside Iran and try to destabilize them because those areas are Sunni populated and they are definitely trying to create a problem for Iran from that point.
[01:14:12.519 --> 01:14:21.267]  So, really, at this moment, I would put the figure of the security contractors to less than 5,000.
[01:14:21.447 --> 01:14:24.309]  I don't think they are more than this number.
[01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:33.357]  And they're trying to expand because very recently, 650 visas were issued to American servicemen.
[01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.779]  So they're trying to turn him into...
[01:14:58.346 --> 01:15:07.364]  Exactly, trying to turn them into covert spies so they can't be differentiated between them, regular troops, and the different contractors.
[01:15:07.384 --> 01:15:09.528]  Speaking of Iran, General Ghoul.
[01:15:10.731 --> 01:15:20.716]  We continue to hear over and over again that Iran is funding insurgency in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:15:20.756 --> 01:15:27.600]  And many analysts, even here in the West, even many people in the CIA say that that's asinine, that that's a lie.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:28.520]  What's the truth there?
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.801]  Oh, it's not a lie.
[01:15:30.841 --> 01:15:34.363]  Believe you me, Iran is not doing anything of this nature.
[01:15:35.423 --> 01:15:39.225]  But they would have us believe that Iran is our enemy.
[01:15:39.245 --> 01:15:40.046]  They're not our enemy.
[01:15:40.962 --> 01:15:44.706]  There has been no hostility between Iran and Pakistan.
[01:15:44.766 --> 01:15:46.067]  That border is quiet.
[01:15:46.127 --> 01:15:50.811]  There is absolutely peaceful movement of goods and people on that border.
[01:15:51.372 --> 01:15:53.093]  So this is not a lie.
[01:15:53.254 --> 01:15:55.215]  It's only to malign Iran.
[01:15:55.696 --> 01:15:56.477]  But I tell you,
[01:15:57.552 --> 01:16:05.842]  Israel is hell-bent to draw America into a wider war by attacking Iran.
[01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:12.590]  If they go in for unilaterally to attack some target, even drop a few bombs here and there,
[01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.993]  I think it will flare up a conflict that they will not be able to control.
[01:16:17.413 --> 01:16:20.315]  And America is likely to get sucked into this war.
[01:16:20.495 --> 01:16:22.977]  And this may turn out to be the third world war.
[01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:25.618]  It will be a disaster of the first order.
[01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:28.040]  I think it must be avoided at all costs.
[01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:42.345]  Well, General Gould, it's not just you, a formidable intelligence and military expert who's worked at every level from ground commander up to major general right through here, but dealing with this,
[01:16:43.607 --> 01:16:51.236]  The word that I get from Ray McGovern, high-level CIA analysts, retired and others, is that they're looking at green-lighting it this month.
[01:16:51.376 --> 01:16:56.862]  They may attack, Israel may attack, in the next 15 days or even sooner.
[01:16:56.922 --> 01:17:04.410]  We are on the edge of what most, even Western analysts say, and the Russians agree, could lead to World War III.
[01:17:06.004 --> 01:17:06.944]  Yes, I agree with you.
[01:17:06.964 --> 01:17:09.305]  I would have said that independently.
[01:17:09.805 --> 01:17:19.349]  I didn't have this information that you have, but all the same, I think my calculation as a strategist and as an intelligence expert is that this would be a disaster.
[01:17:19.829 --> 01:17:24.130]  I don't think that Russia can be kept back, or China for that matter.
[01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:28.632]  I don't know which of all other countries will get sucked into this imbroglio.
[01:17:29.152 --> 01:17:31.433]  And this will be an inferno that will consume
[01:17:32.493 --> 01:17:33.333]  So many things.
[01:17:33.874 --> 01:17:36.314]  And corporate America would be the biggest sufferer.
[01:17:36.334 --> 01:17:37.355]  They don't realize this.
[01:17:37.855 --> 01:17:45.678]  Because if it results eventually in destabilization of the entire region, where are they going to sell their goods?
[01:17:45.738 --> 01:17:47.518]  And how are they going to pick up the oil?
[01:17:48.018 --> 01:17:51.740]  And especially the European countries will be the biggest sufferers.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.081]  And the Japanese economy will collapse.
[01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:55.301]  So many things will happen.
[01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:57.962]  You can't simply say it's incalculable at this time.
[01:17:58.993 --> 01:18:02.635]  By the way, that's what literally hundreds of top Western analysts are saying.
[01:18:02.675 --> 01:18:05.017]  They confer with General Hamid Gul.
[01:18:05.057 --> 01:18:07.278]  General, we're running out of time.
[01:18:07.399 --> 01:18:08.879]  We've got one more segment coming up.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.182]  I may try to keep you a bit longer, but I wanted to get into some other issues.
[01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:15.084]  We're also simulcasting on television.
[01:18:15.384 --> 01:18:17.385]  If I can have a document cam shot right here.
[01:18:17.945 --> 01:18:18.366]  Evidence.
[01:18:18.786 --> 01:18:21.548]  Mumbai attackers were Anglo-American intel operatives.
[01:18:21.568 --> 01:18:26.271]  That's Kurt Nemo in November of 2008 about the Mumbai attacks.
[01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:27.652]  Now we have
[01:18:28.192 --> 01:18:35.580]  December of last year, Times of London, Mumbai terror suspect David Headley was rogue U.S.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.081]  agent.
[01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:40.726]  The Chicago Tribune went on to report he was the commander of the operation.
[01:18:40.766 --> 01:18:47.393]  The head of Indian counterterrorism said it was a Western op, but they killed him that day to shut him up.
[01:18:48.434 --> 01:18:48.975]  Here's another one.
[01:18:48.995 --> 01:18:52.041]  Chicago man charged in 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.
[01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:53.864]  Intelligence connection.
[01:18:53.884 --> 01:19:00.455]  So, how did you know two years ago, day one, that this was a Western op that they tried to blame on you and Pakistan?
[01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:10.076]  Well, I have an uncanny sixth sense about this because of my experience, because of the fact that I worked with the CIA and I know how their mind works.
[01:19:10.596 --> 01:19:11.817]  I can read their mind.
[01:19:12.277 --> 01:19:23.641]  For instance, I had said that this attack, 9-11 attack, was because of the internal cavity inside America itself.
[01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:28.842]  To date, they have not been able to come up with a charge sheet against Osama Bin Laden.
[01:19:29.202 --> 01:19:32.604]  He should have been tried in absentia if they had enough evidence on him.
[01:19:33.125 --> 01:19:34.766]  Why have they not tried him in absentia?
[01:19:55.443 --> 01:19:57.734]  Stay there, General Hamid Ghul, our guest.
[01:19:57.935 --> 01:19:58.578]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.941 --> 01:20:02.303]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[01:20:02.543 --> 01:20:11.210]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.

[01:20:24.761 --> 01:20:27.724]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[01:20:27.884 --> 01:20:37.651]  Beneficial settlements, manageable monthly payments, and quick restoration of credit are more easily attained, potentially saving you thousands of dollars in interest charges, fees, and unpaid debt.
[01:20:37.772 --> 01:20:38.772]  Don't procrastinate.

[01:21:59.589 --> 01:22:00.449]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:05.952]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:06.152 --> 01:22:06.572]  I get it.
[01:22:06.692 --> 01:22:16.037]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:16.297 --> 01:22:17.478]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:17.698 --> 01:22:25.961]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:26.181 --> 01:22:29.462]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:29.562 --> 01:22:33.664]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:33.844 --> 01:22:35.405]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:35.445 --> 01:22:38.666]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:38.846 --> 01:22:43.008]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:43.928]  You should, too.
[01:22:44.109 --> 01:22:45.089]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:45.249 --> 01:22:48.551]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:48.571 --> 01:22:48.611]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:48.912]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.972 --> 01:22:49.152]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.076 --> 01:23:02.118]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:06.081]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:06.362 --> 01:23:09.824]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:23:51.595 --> 01:23:52.237]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[01:24:03.365 --> 01:24:11.209]  Okay, he's a retired three-star general, so it is Lieutenant General, former head of Pakistani intelligence, General Hamid Gul.
[01:24:12.109 --> 01:24:14.190]  And he is with us today.
[01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:17.351]  And I have to tell you, I've researched this all in-depth myself.
[01:24:17.371 --> 01:24:22.274]  It's been declassified, the CIA, Mossad, MI6 stage terror attacks.
[01:24:22.714 --> 01:24:26.756]  They're doing everything they can to get us into a full-bore war with Pakistan.
[01:24:26.776 --> 01:24:30.177]  Then they'll have to go in with a full invasion to get the nukes.
[01:24:32.196 --> 01:24:39.578]  I mean, if you think that the Afghans are tough and hard to beat, the Pakistanis are just as tough or tougher and have nuclear weapons.
[01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:41.739]  But I'll get into that in a moment with General Gould.
[01:24:41.779 --> 01:24:44.260]  General Gould, I brought up the Mumbai attacks.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:51.142]  It was later confirmed that that was run by Western intelligence and you were getting into 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:24:51.242 --> 01:24:52.402]  Please spend some time on that.
[01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:56.572]  Yeah, 9-11, they haven't given the evidence so far.
[01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:01.234]  And I think much hype was created now they don't even mention Osama Bin Laden.
[01:25:01.714 --> 01:25:04.056]  The latest statement is by General Petraeus.
[01:25:04.396 --> 01:25:10.439]  He said that he is so far away that whether he is alive or dead doesn't matter at all.
[01:25:11.119 --> 01:25:18.943]  So that way they have forgotten about Osama Bin Laden now, and they are out to destroy the Afghan nation and then come for Pakistan.
[01:25:18.983 --> 01:25:22.705]  From day one I said 9-11 was a pretext.
[01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:30.188]  Afghanistan is the lodging place, this is the staging point, and from there they will jump into Pakistan.
[01:25:30.929 --> 01:25:33.090]  And I fear that this is coming true.
[01:25:33.810 --> 01:25:38.752]  But in Pakistan, there's overwhelming interest of both India and Israel.
[01:25:38.992 --> 01:25:44.554]  It's not America's interest because America won't bother whether Pakistan has 30, 40 or 100 bombs.
[01:25:44.614 --> 01:25:46.154]  It makes no difference to America.
[01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:49.016]  We have no such hostility between us.
[01:25:49.156 --> 01:25:52.917]  In fact, we have been very fast friends in the past and we still are friends.
[01:25:53.617 --> 01:26:00.762]  Anyway, the point is that Israel would simply not be able to digest Pakistan's nuclear program, nor the Indians.
[01:26:01.502 --> 01:26:09.727]  So, Pakistan's nuclear program is one point which needs to be now resolved, one way or another.
[01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:16.091]  Either they have to accept that Pakistan is a de facto nuclear power and should be entered into the nuclear club,
[01:26:16.764 --> 01:26:18.006]  Because that's a reality.
[01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:28.157]  And the fact that they have not accepted it, while India's nuclear capability has been accepted, that means they are still out to destroy it somehow.
[01:26:28.738 --> 01:26:32.142]  They can't reverse it and they cannot destroy it.
[01:26:32.602 --> 01:26:34.004]  Now that is where
[01:26:35.258 --> 01:26:42.024]  My understanding of Pakistan's ability, Pakistan's will to resist and its resilience comes into play.
[01:26:42.284 --> 01:26:56.375]  I can assure you there is a complete consensus in Pakistan on this one issue, that nuclear capability we have to protect even if in the process we end up with a total destruction.
[01:26:56.775 --> 01:27:01.098]  Doesn't matter, but we will protect this capability of ours.
[01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:02.780]  It's a great asset for Pakistan.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:16.751]  But my fear, Alex, is that if Pakistan is put to the corner and it is pushed against the wall, Pakistan being an Islamic state could also declare international jihad.
[01:27:17.492 --> 01:27:24.478]  Now, if that Islamic state declares international jihad, it becomes binding on the Muslims of the rest of the world.
[01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.130]  To come out in support of Jihad.
[01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:32.692]  That is what will change the modern history altogether, if that call is given.
[01:27:33.312 --> 01:27:41.814]  So let Pakistan not be taken lightly by the adversaries, by India, by Israel, or even by America.
[01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:45.975]  Pakistan has a potential, which is a very dangerous potential.
[01:27:45.995 --> 01:27:47.015]  We wouldn't like to do that.
[01:27:47.555 --> 01:27:54.586]  But if we have no other choice, if it is an existentialist threat to us, then anything is possible.
[01:27:55.007 --> 01:27:57.651]  And it better be avoided by our adversaries.
[01:27:59.059 --> 01:28:10.207]  General, I'm showing viewers Spy Talk, the issue from about two months ago in the Washington Post, with a headline, CIA's Unit Wacky Idea Depicts Saddam as Gay.
[01:28:10.787 --> 01:28:15.450]  But buried in the article, they admit that they made fake Bin Laden videos.
[01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:19.253]  The famous Bin Laden video is a fake.
[01:28:19.433 --> 01:28:23.576]  So, Bin Laden was writing letters saying he didn't do this after the attacks.
[01:28:24.176 --> 01:28:29.022]  Meanwhile, they use message boards and fake videos and they admit it was a fake video.
[01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:33.006]  Why would the CIA arrogantly come out and admit they're growing the opium?
[01:28:33.367 --> 01:28:38.693]  Why would they arrogantly come out and brag that they are creating fake Bin Laden videos?
[01:28:38.733 --> 01:28:41.256]  I mean, why are they so arrogant?
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:51.714]  Well, this is the imperial arrogance, imperial hubris, which I think afflicts every nation which comes into that position, where it stands at the pinnacle.
[01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:57.703]  And there is no one to destroy them, but they themselves, their own internal cavities destroy them.
[01:28:58.704 --> 01:28:59.404]  I don't think so.
[01:29:19.392 --> 01:29:21.454]  General, stay there.
[01:29:21.534 --> 01:29:25.176]  Final segment with you coming up straight ahead.
[01:29:25.216 --> 01:29:27.838]  We'll talk more about World War III.
[01:29:49.833 --> 01:29:52.836]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.757 --> 01:29:56.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.956 --> 01:30:01.718]  Listen up, friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:30:02.099 --> 01:30:05.622]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:30:05.882 --> 01:30:08.544]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:30:08.764 --> 01:30:13.789]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:32:02.825 --> 01:32:03.746]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:04.086 --> 01:32:07.788]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:07.948 --> 01:32:10.250]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:15.713]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:16.113 --> 01:32:22.357]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:22.777 --> 01:32:28.322]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:28.762 --> 01:32:32.445]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:32.926 --> 01:32:36.949]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:37.230 --> 01:32:42.754]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:43.175 --> 01:32:46.157]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:46.738 --> 01:32:48.179]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:49.140]  It's here.

[01:33:06.509 --> 01:33:08.610]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:10.892 --> 01:33:16.595]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:19.286 --> 01:33:25.291]  Three-star General Hamid Gul, former head of Pakistani intelligence, who led the forces to victory against the Soviet bear.
[01:33:26.192 --> 01:33:36.040]  When you watch the films and read the documents about the Soviets massacring villages, carpet bombing villages, it's exactly what our criminal government's doing.
[01:33:36.621 --> 01:33:42.425]  The same corporations that have occupied Afghanistan, using our military, are occupying my country.
[01:33:43.166 --> 01:33:48.471]  They're waging war against my Bill of Rights, my Constitution, my children's future.
[01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:50.632]  I want my Republic back.
[01:33:51.013 --> 01:33:53.395]  I want to be known as the land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:33:53.655 --> 01:33:56.517]  An example of goodness, not an example of evil.
[01:33:57.158 --> 01:33:57.838]  They lie to you.
[01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.680]  They give you fake Bin Laden videos.
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.141]  They stage terror attacks.
[01:34:01.601 --> 01:34:04.144]  They say Saddam's got WMDs when he doesn't.
[01:34:04.784 --> 01:34:09.488]  And they want to start World War III, not just with Iran, but Pakistan.
[01:34:09.668 --> 01:34:17.715]  I concur with General Gould's analysis 100% from my own deep 18-hour-a-day research, many days.
[01:34:18.235 --> 01:34:18.535]  Okay?
[01:34:19.216 --> 01:34:28.924]  We are going into World War III, and General Gould, you talked about how they want to cause the collapse of Pakistan, how they're funding radicals there, which has been admitted.
[01:34:28.964 --> 01:34:29.624]  They've been caught.
[01:34:30.976 --> 01:34:51.261]  And how they want Pakistan to have their back against a wall, so they have to declare an emergency jihad to protect themselves and call on aid, as Afghanistan did, so they can have what the PENAC documents and the Israelis and Dick Cheney called for in the September 20th, 2000 Rebuilding America's Defense's PENAC document, a clash of civilizations.
[01:34:51.621 --> 01:34:55.102]  They want to force the American people into a bare-knuckle war
[01:34:55.822 --> 01:34:57.003]  to fully commit us.
[01:34:57.203 --> 01:34:59.324]  I believe they're going to set off nukes in the U.S.
[01:34:59.384 --> 01:35:00.925]  and blame it on Pakistan and Iran.
[01:35:02.406 --> 01:35:06.469]  I see them putting out this story to where the Americans will howl with pure rage.
[01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:12.213]  They will ship three million Americans over there, bloodthirsty, ready for absolute genocide.
[01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:19.378]  And so your people, my people, have to stand together against the New World Order, just like they want to put two pit bulls in a
[01:35:20.338 --> 01:35:22.159]  in a ring and have us kill each other.
[01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:23.519]  We don't need to do this.
[01:35:23.559 --> 01:35:26.780]  We need to be smart enough to avert this and the evidence is clear.
[01:35:27.161 --> 01:35:35.804]  We are on the verge of them launching World War III, a clash between Christendom, what's left of it in the West, and the East.
[01:35:36.404 --> 01:35:37.884]  A war without end.
[01:35:37.984 --> 01:35:38.985]  General, your comments.
[01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:42.937]  My comments are that there is no clash of civilization.
[01:35:42.977 --> 01:35:45.758]  This is a myth that has been created, unfortunately.
[01:35:45.779 --> 01:35:48.440]  There has to be a meeting of civilization.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.442]  And as far as Islam is concerned, why is it being looked upon as an enemy, as an adversary?
[01:35:53.902 --> 01:35:56.703]  Islam encompasses Christianity and Judaism.
[01:35:57.004 --> 01:36:03.406]  It is not an entity in itself, but actually it encompasses all the three religions of the book.
[01:36:03.887 --> 01:36:06.688]  So there has to be enmity, peace among us.
[01:36:07.348 --> 01:36:09.069]  And everyone has to gain from it.
[01:36:09.609 --> 01:36:15.210]  And therefore, there is no need for the dark impulse in the American system.
[01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:17.871]  I won't say in the American people, because they are so good.
[01:36:18.531 --> 01:36:22.852]  It is in the American system that dark impulse has to be removed.
[01:36:23.353 --> 01:36:31.355]  And it can only be removed by the American people if they rise against it, like the moratorium movement back in the Vietnam days.
[01:36:32.015 --> 01:36:50.584]  When it picked up from Berkeley's campus and then it spread across the cities and villages of whole of America, it became the battle cry for American people that this was a useless war, this was a debilitating war, and we must quit as soon as possible.
[01:36:51.024 --> 01:36:54.686]  Which they did, and of course America still remained a great power.
[01:36:55.166 --> 01:37:05.413]  And eventually, it's because of the Afghan blood, because of the services of Pakistan and men like me, that America enjoys today the status of the sole superpower.
[01:37:05.933 --> 01:37:16.180]  Now, America is hell-bent, or that dark impulse in the American system is hell-bent, that they destroy America's position as the sole superpower.
[01:37:16.601 --> 01:37:18.642]  So, it has to be morally corrected.
[01:37:20.483 --> 01:37:27.605]  Telling lies with regard to Iraq, telling lies with regard to 9-11, and telling lies now with regard to Bombay attacks.
[01:37:28.165 --> 01:37:31.045]  Everywhere it is lies, lies, and lies.
[01:37:31.065 --> 01:37:31.646]  Nothing else.
[01:37:32.226 --> 01:37:39.227]  And that is not going to be helpful because that is going to totally demolish the American position.
[01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:46.989]  American economy is in doldrums, but the generals of the Pentagon, they would want America to commit more forces.
[01:37:47.969 --> 01:37:54.053]  In Afghanistan and elsewhere, and now they want to pick a fight with Iran at the same time, pick a fight with Pakistan.
[01:37:54.093 --> 01:37:54.713]  I don't know.
[01:37:55.134 --> 01:38:01.317]  They have to sit down, war game it, and if I am there, I will tell each one of them how wrong they are.
[01:38:01.958 --> 01:38:04.379]  There are lessons to be learned from military history.
[01:38:04.759 --> 01:38:08.162]  In Afghanistan, for instance, the spaces are not in their control.
[01:38:11.338 --> 01:38:15.779]  Is actually the outcome of three, interplay of three factors, which is very important.
[01:38:15.819 --> 01:38:18.139]  Now I'm talking as a professional soldier.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.220]  The time, space and relative strength.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:27.902]  In Afghanistan, Americans have the watch and opposition has the time.
[01:38:27.942 --> 01:38:29.142]  The Mujahideen have the time.
[01:38:30.042 --> 01:38:34.703]  In Afghanistan, again, they have, the spaces are with the opposition.
[01:38:35.681 --> 01:38:40.085]  And Americans are confined only to garrison town.
[01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:43.268]  More and more, they will be squeezed into the garrison town.
[01:38:43.808 --> 01:38:54.237]  And third factor, that of relative strength, agreed that America has firepower, but America does not have a willing, motivated manpower.
[01:38:54.857 --> 01:39:00.280]  Slowly, gradually, the American soldiers have started now asking, what are we here for?
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.241]  Why are we laying down our lives?
[01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:08.004]  And I think this is a terrible situation if it seeps into the minds of the soldiers.
[01:39:08.424 --> 01:39:14.947]  And I think before this really erupts, it's better for America, it's better for the world that they pull out of here.
[01:39:15.527 --> 01:39:22.270]  And they abandon any notions of attacking Iran or coming for Pakistan's nuclear capability.
[01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:29.152]  They cannot pluck it out and it can create a desperate Pakistan which could do anything.
[01:39:29.312 --> 01:39:43.298]  I'm not saying that Pakistan would do it, but I think there are possibilities and there are chances that Pakistan may actually have to for its own existence, for its own honor, for its own well-being.
[01:39:44.398 --> 01:39:53.865]  Go to the extreme limit, which would not be good for the countries who want to see Pakistan's nuclear capability destroyed and Pakistan cut to pieces.
[01:39:54.065 --> 01:39:55.286]  No, it will not happen.
[01:39:55.666 --> 01:39:56.607]  I can assure you this.
[01:39:57.027 --> 01:40:01.711]  And they better disamuse their minds and their plans of this kind of notion.
[01:40:03.806 --> 01:40:08.909]  General, a few other points I wanted to bring up to you, and then any other points you'd like to make, and we'll let you go.
[01:40:08.929 --> 01:40:12.051]  We're very thankful for your time today and your courage to come on this broadcast.
[01:40:13.112 --> 01:40:17.755]  But specifically, Benazir Bhutto dealing with another lie.
[01:40:17.775 --> 01:40:25.460]  Our media said that she fell and hit her head on the side of a car, even though all over European and Central Asian news,
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:44.277]  It showed her being machine-gunned in the chest by Western contractors as the intel, and then when it came out that she had been murdered and that our media had lied, they tried to claim that forces associated with the Taliban, which is any tribal group that resists occupation, had done it.
[01:40:44.557 --> 01:40:49.142]  What is the truth from your research about the assassination of Buddha?
[01:40:50.003 --> 01:40:52.126]  I've been saying that all along.
[01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.369]  He has been killed by the Americans.
[01:40:54.389 --> 01:40:56.511]  He's been killed by Dick Cheney's people.
[01:40:57.172 --> 01:41:07.806]  They are the ones who are operating in Dick Cheney's order because Dick Cheney has drawn up a plan of governance for Pakistan and Benazir has become rebellious.
[01:41:08.306 --> 01:41:15.568]  She refused to meet Negra Ponte because Negra Ponte had told her not to go in Pakistan until after the election.
[01:41:15.588 --> 01:41:20.010]  But she dared them and she came and she said, I want independent judiciary.
[01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:30.313]  She sent me a message through an emissary, a good friend of hers and me, and he came and said that she says, General, I am now agreeing with you.
[01:41:30.373 --> 01:41:34.814]  I tend to agree with you that the Americans have evil designs on Pakistan.
[01:41:35.514 --> 01:41:46.302]  And therefore I know that she had become very dangerous for them, for Dick Cheney and company, who wanted things to happen in a certain way in Pakistan.
[01:41:46.883 --> 01:41:52.267]  Unfortunately, those things are happening in that fashion, and I think Pakistan is in tatters today.
[01:41:52.687 --> 01:41:59.953]  Pakistan has to be redeemed, and I think the young generation of Pakistan is very angry, very unhappy with America.
[01:42:00.493 --> 01:42:04.975]  So America must not think of ruling Pakistan by proxies.
[01:42:05.515 --> 01:42:06.235]  This is wrong.
[01:42:06.455 --> 01:42:10.537]  And I think they should quit this idea as soon as possible.
[01:42:10.777 --> 01:42:13.938]  Well, General Ghul, here is my message to the Pakistani people.
[01:42:13.998 --> 01:42:20.380]  I know you're hardworking, intelligent, good people who have always been friends with the United States.
[01:42:21.121 --> 01:42:27.583]  And I have the globalist-owned PNAC plans to go in and destabilize you and overthrow your country and then put
[01:42:28.263 --> 01:42:53.891]  extremist in power so that you won't have a highly developed civilization and they're threatened by that and they also want to use up America's treasure and our good name and destroy us in the international community via your destruction so that this new global corporate state known as the New World Order can rise and they now admit they're forming a world government run by private banks
[01:42:54.631 --> 01:42:58.414]  They have a global carbon tax that's meant to strangle development.
[01:42:58.735 --> 01:42:59.896]  This is eugenics.
[01:42:59.996 --> 01:43:10.105]  And from my research, I've never read your writings on this subject, but I'm curious your view on the aim of this global corporate Anglo-American New World Order system.
[01:43:10.705 --> 01:43:12.467]  And are you aware that they've been caught
[01:43:12.907 --> 01:43:18.332]  Giving children in Central Asia, this is CBS News, real polio in the shots to kill them.
[01:43:18.573 --> 01:43:23.037]  They've been caught adding sterilants to the tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[01:43:23.537 --> 01:43:33.347]  And that from my research, Latin America, Africa, Central Asia, Pakistan, particularly, is targeted by a covert population reduction program.
[01:43:33.367 --> 01:43:34.208]  Are you aware of that, sir?
[01:43:35.407 --> 01:43:40.390]  Yes, I've heard of it and I think it's very obnoxious to say the least.
[01:43:40.971 --> 01:43:53.119]  But America appears to be becoming heartless and I think the American people have got to win back their heart and they have to come up with an opinion.
[01:43:53.979 --> 01:43:54.660]  We're good to go.
[01:44:21.477 --> 01:44:24.882]  General Hamid Gul, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:44:24.902 --> 01:44:32.633]  I look forward to speaking to you again in the future and I hope that our two countries can be friends and I hope that we can get our nation back from the globalists.
[01:44:32.653 --> 01:44:33.395]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:44:34.082 --> 01:44:35.363]  Thank you, Alex, and goodbye.
[01:44:35.563 --> 01:44:36.643]  Goodbye, General Gould.
[01:44:37.243 --> 01:44:47.348]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen, an hour and fifteen minute live, uncensored interview with three-star General Hamid Gould, former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[01:44:47.468 --> 01:44:51.570]  And I will post this video and audio at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:52.490 --> 01:45:00.634]  If you missed any of it in the live show today, it'll be up just minutes after the live broadcast ends, after Max Keiser is with us on the economy and other news.
[01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:05.151]  But what you just heard is the truth from all of my research.
[01:45:05.612 --> 01:45:14.455]  Separately, with doing my own research, I can find nothing that Hamid Gul said here that isn't veritas, that isn't the truth.
[01:45:15.096 --> 01:45:19.858]  And this guy was a hero in our media in the 80s, leading the attacks against the Soviets.
[01:45:21.051 --> 01:45:45.485]  uh... and and and now uh... you know it's it's it's the russians saying we better be careful in afghanistan and pakistan and it's our own government run by a bunch of crooks uh... that is trying to expand all of this so uh... very informative uh... interview with lieutenant general hameed uh... dual and obviously in the days to come uh... you'll probably see a lot of news articles uh... written about uh... all of this but
[01:45:47.526 --> 01:45:55.469]  What was the one line, Jaren, that he said that you thought would be a good idea to name the video of this when we posted it at PrisonPlanet.tv?
[01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:57.710]  God help America.
[01:45:57.990 --> 01:46:00.031]  Hamid Gul, God help America.
[01:46:00.051 --> 01:46:02.012]  This is a guy actually trained over here.
[01:46:04.373 --> 01:46:14.177]  And our media is using fake battlefield reports, even the Washington Post said are very questionable, to claim that this 74-year-old gentleman
[01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:25.144]  You say 74, 76 to claim that he is running all these attacks when it's all these different tribes, all these different groups who many times are even fighting with each other.
[01:46:25.164 --> 01:46:27.326]  I mean, nobody's running this.
[01:46:27.486 --> 01:46:28.767]  Nobody's controlling this.
[01:46:29.328 --> 01:46:37.274]  That's the globalist mindset is they create crises so big and so out of control that
[01:46:38.649 --> 01:46:50.475]  That the problems just get bigger and then they can spend more money and more troops and project more power in the name of cleaning it up, but the plan is only to make it worse and commit us to an endless war.
[01:46:51.496 --> 01:46:59.380]  And that's why as a patriotic American who defends the entire Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, and Constitution, I agree with George Washington.
[01:47:00.021 --> 01:47:02.362]  And we know FEMA demonizes George Washington.
[01:47:02.382 --> 01:47:10.687]  I have video training films where they teach police and firefighters and sheriff's deputies that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were terrorists and were bad.
[01:47:10.707 --> 01:47:12.328]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:22.604]  And it's just so disgusting to see this, but George Washington, now Al-Qaeda according to our government, I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true.
[01:47:23.164 --> 01:47:24.865]  He said no foreign entanglements.
[01:47:24.925 --> 01:47:26.046]  We're not an empire.
[01:47:26.626 --> 01:47:28.727]  We're going to trade with people, like Ron Paul says.
[01:47:28.767 --> 01:47:30.348]  We're going to have business with people.
[01:47:30.788 --> 01:47:36.292]  Now I've got a bunch of other news coming up on the economy I want to hit on, ahead of Max Keiser joining us, some other military news.
[01:47:36.632 --> 01:47:50.841]  We've got a break here in a moment, but I've done an hour and 47 minutes without telling you about what makes this operation float, what funds this operation, but more importantly, that's just a caveat, a fringe benefit, a symbiosis, a symbiotic relationship.
[01:47:51.241 --> 01:47:52.922]  These films are waking people up.
[01:47:53.422 --> 01:47:58.426]  You can show them the well-produced, well-documented, riveting, real-world films,
[01:47:59.446 --> 01:48:02.087]  And your friends and family are ready to be awakened.
[01:48:02.107 --> 01:48:10.189]  You can get all my films or films I produced and make copies of them and air them on AXS TV and give them to people for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:13.430]  Invisible Empire, a New World Order defined by Jason Burma.
[01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:14.591]  Such an important film.
[01:48:14.931 --> 01:48:16.671]  Took us a year and a half to make this.
[01:48:17.232 --> 01:48:22.913]  Covers the whole New World Order architecture, their order out of chaos program, hundreds of New World Order global government quotes.
[01:48:23.274 --> 01:48:24.554]  This is such an important film.
[01:48:24.894 --> 01:48:26.855]  This special ends next Monday.
[01:48:26.895 --> 01:48:27.535]  You've got a week
[01:48:27.995 --> 01:48:30.677]  To take advantage of this, buy one copy, get three free.
[01:48:31.498 --> 01:48:34.120]  You can go ahead and do all your Christmas shopping early, have it all.

[01:48:57.034 --> 01:48:59.055]  Same thing with Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[01:48:59.336 --> 01:49:11.985]  The entire 15 years of my research, the latest developments, the secret governor's councils, the Military Commissions Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the executive orders, all of it is covered in this film.
[01:49:12.945 --> 01:49:23.336]  The FEMA camps, the clergy response teams, how the underwear bombing on Christmas Day was staged, it is all covered in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:49:23.796 --> 01:49:26.058]  So many subjects, well documented.
[01:49:26.098 --> 01:49:27.300]  Buy one, get three free.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.402]  Buy two, get eight free.

[01:49:34.531 --> 01:49:36.732]  Same thing with Part 2 of the Obama Deception.
[01:49:36.993 --> 01:49:38.634]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:49:39.154 --> 01:49:40.875]  The presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[01:49:40.895 --> 01:49:42.237]  How they plan to start the wars.
[01:49:42.457 --> 01:49:44.018]  How they plan to steal the pension funds.
[01:49:44.358 --> 01:49:45.559]  Made this almost a year ago.
[01:49:46.059 --> 01:49:47.521]  It's all coming true now.
[01:49:47.601 --> 01:49:49.282]  People see this and are blown away.
[01:49:49.602 --> 01:49:51.203]  The production quality is off the chart.
[01:49:51.524 --> 01:49:52.684]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:49:53.005 --> 01:49:54.306]  You can get all three of these films.
[01:49:54.366 --> 01:49:55.447]  Buy one, get three free.
[01:49:56.604 --> 01:49:58.185]  Buy two, get eight free.
[01:49:58.685 --> 01:50:01.546]  And also other great documentaries that we carry.
[01:50:01.927 --> 01:50:02.507]  Discounted.
[01:50:02.547 --> 01:50:04.708]  Global Warming, Emerging Science, and Understanding.
[01:50:05.148 --> 01:50:07.349]  Solutions for a Broken Economy, The Secret of Oz.
[01:50:07.629 --> 01:50:08.610]  Directed by Bill Still.
[01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:09.330]  Get it discounted.
[01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:10.731]  The Obama Deception.
[01:50:11.291 --> 01:50:13.192]  All of these are available

[01:50:33.476 --> 01:50:36.317]  They've got a 64 kilobit audio podcast there.
[01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:44.021]  They've got the 64, it's actually 120 or even higher, audio video of the entire archive of the full show.
[01:50:44.081 --> 01:50:47.963]  We now do the whole transmission as TV as well, not just part of it.
[01:50:48.343 --> 01:50:52.145]  It's all at PrisonPlanet.TV and your memberships make all this possible.
[01:50:52.185 --> 01:50:58.488]  And later this week, exclusive for PrisonPlanet.TV members, my interview with Jesse Ventura on KeyInfo here in Austin last week.
[01:50:59.631 --> 01:51:00.111]  Attention!
[01:51:00.231 --> 01:51:05.132]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:51:05.232 --> 01:51:10.774]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:17.876]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:51:18.056 --> 01:51:26.798]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[01:51:28.018 --> 01:51:30.940]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:37.824]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:51:38.004 --> 01:51:46.829]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:51:46.969 --> 01:51:51.592]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[01:51:51.732 --> 01:51:53.393]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again, 800-902-6969 Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:53.413 --> 01:51:58.437]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:58.457 --> 01:52:00.979]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:08.524 --> 01:52:11.326]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:11.706 --> 01:52:16.790]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:21.994]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.514 --> 01:52:29.439]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.639 --> 01:52:30.480]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:33.502]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:33.802 --> 01:52:37.104]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.424 --> 01:52:40.246]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:40.606 --> 01:52:42.507]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.827 --> 01:52:43.768]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:43.788 --> 01:52:43.988]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.028 --> 01:52:46.910]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:47.410 --> 01:52:49.151]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:59.744 --> 01:53:01.826]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:53:02.266 --> 01:53:05.369]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:13.817]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:53:14.317 --> 01:53:19.242]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:53:19.802 --> 01:53:24.887]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:53:25.407 --> 01:53:32.933]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[01:53:33.454 --> 01:53:38.458]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:53:38.919 --> 01:53:40.140]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.185]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:49.248]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[01:53:49.569 --> 01:53:52.812]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:53:52.832 --> 01:53:54.293]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[01:54:04.264 --> 01:54:08.546]  Hi, this is former Governor Jesse Ventura, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:09.026 --> 01:54:21.852]  I recommend you all pay attention to Alex, because Alex and I are teaming up again this fall for a second season of Conspiracy Theory, where we will attempt to get to the bottom of these conspiracies.
[01:54:22.272 --> 01:54:25.054]  Until then, keep watching and listening to Alex.
[01:54:32.171 --> 01:54:38.475]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:54:41.056 --> 01:54:54.983]  Well, right when we kick off the third hour, Max Keiser, stockbroker, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, great trends forecaster, he'll be joining us today on this live Monday, 16th day of August, 2010.
[01:54:57.381 --> 01:55:01.364]  I'm going to get into the economy with Kaiser coming up and the Iran situation.
[01:55:02.044 --> 01:55:04.946]  But first, I wanted to get into some Big Brother news.
[01:55:04.986 --> 01:55:09.349]  This is up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:18.175]  Remember six, seven years ago in Australia and the U.S., the NSA was going to give local police and Bureau of Land Management
[01:55:19.076 --> 01:55:35.630]  And environmental groups, even private ones, access to satellite images, lifetime, of people's farms and ranches and in businesses, so they could harass people so that they couldn't build a barn or couldn't, you know, plant crops without being harassed.
[01:55:36.811 --> 01:55:44.257]  Well, all Google did, which is admittedly part of the NSA, I mean, I told you that many years ago, now they admit it, is they just made it all public to everybody.
[01:55:45.994 --> 01:55:52.644]  And government is now using this to harass people, and all over the world, because the same global corporations are setting this up.
[01:55:53.406 --> 01:55:59.735]  They're banning people collecting their own rainwater, and now they're saying you've got to pay for rain to fall on your crops.
[01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:02.991]  But then other nations don't have to do that.
[01:56:03.031 --> 01:56:03.872]  It's all selective.
[01:56:04.112 --> 01:56:05.432]  It's all part of the carbon tax.
[01:56:05.873 --> 01:56:08.754]  This will shut down our industry and our farming even more.
[01:56:09.114 --> 01:56:13.157]  Key article up at PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson today.
[01:56:14.077 --> 01:56:18.560]  Government using Google Earth to loot destitute Americans.
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:20.441]  And I actually heard an NPR piece
[01:56:21.321 --> 01:56:38.713]  About two weeks ago and thought to call Watson, because a lot of times I call Watson or Kurt, well Kurt works here now, he's moved to Austin from New Mexico, but so I'll usually go into their office or call them, Watson's in England, both Watsons are, and I'll say write on this, and I forgot to, but that's why I love Watson, because he thinks just like I do, and he wrote a story about it.
[01:56:38.954 --> 01:56:47.500]  But NPR was saying it was good in Greece and in other countries, the government to raise money
[01:56:48.539 --> 01:56:55.802]  Is charging people, depending on the city, $300 to $1,000 or 1,000 euros for a swimming pool fee.
[01:56:56.463 --> 01:57:00.805]  Or they notice if your swimming pool looks like it's in disuse, they come and fine you.
[01:57:01.085 --> 01:57:03.286]  So it's all part of this surveillance harassment.
[01:57:03.306 --> 01:57:09.629]  Remember that Pennsylvania tax collection ad where it says, hey, Tom, we're watching you.
[01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:12.970]  You didn't pay $4,000 taxes and we know where you live.
[01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:16.912]  And it shows the earth and they zoom in from space and show the guy's house.
[01:57:19.009 --> 01:57:21.571]  Again, this is all designed for you.
[01:57:21.671 --> 01:57:22.031]  Here it is.
[01:57:22.131 --> 01:57:22.612]  Smile.
[01:57:22.772 --> 01:57:25.353]  Aerial images being used to enforce laws.
[01:57:25.453 --> 01:57:26.514]  Associated Press.
[01:57:27.795 --> 01:57:29.896]  And that was August 14th, just two days ago.
[01:57:29.916 --> 01:57:31.978]  In fact, crank this ad up.
[01:57:32.418 --> 01:57:32.878]  Start it over.
[01:57:32.898 --> 01:57:33.559]  That's a good idea.
[01:57:34.479 --> 01:57:38.242]  Crank up the ad, because I want people to actually see and hear this ad where they're intimidating people.
[01:57:38.282 --> 01:57:38.562]  Here it is.
[01:57:41.018 --> 01:57:42.340]  Just off of 5th Street.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:43.501]  Nice car, Tom.
[01:57:43.761 --> 01:57:44.482]  Nice house.
[01:57:44.663 --> 01:57:50.730]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[01:57:51.351 --> 01:57:53.634]  Listen, Tom, we can make this easy.
[01:57:54.134 --> 01:57:59.601]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[01:58:00.542 --> 01:58:03.923]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[01:58:05.223 --> 01:58:07.124]  Oh, find us before we find you.
[01:58:07.564 --> 01:58:09.865]  So this whole grid isn't for the terrorists.
[01:58:10.045 --> 01:58:10.685]  That's the government.
[01:58:10.705 --> 01:58:11.865]  They're staging almost all of it.
[01:58:12.126 --> 01:58:12.666]  It's for us.
[01:58:13.546 --> 01:58:27.230]  State utilizing aerial imagery technology to enforce petty ordinances and loot destitute citizens of whatever income they have left after having had trillions in wealth stolen and transferred to foreign banks and trillions spent to build these satellites and launch them.
[01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:29.511]  And the whole article just goes over
[01:58:30.572 --> 01:58:30.933]  Uh, Ed.
[01:58:31.233 --> 01:58:32.655]  And then there's another report here.
[01:58:32.675 --> 01:58:35.920]  They're now coming in to charge you for rainwater usage.
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:46.976]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.144 --> 01:58:53.106]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:53.346 --> 01:58:59.390]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:58:59.750 --> 01:59:06.854]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:07.134 --> 01:59:11.677]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:11.997 --> 01:59:20.485]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:59:20.665 --> 01:59:24.469]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:24.929 --> 01:59:31.115]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:31.696 --> 01:59:35.139]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:35.619 --> 01:59:36.060]  Call us.
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.001]  At 1-800-340-7091.
[01:59:37.141 --> 01:59:47.650]  Visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:48.330]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.233 --> 01:59:54.155]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.615 --> 01:59:57.398]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:08.281]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.922 --> 02:00:09.743]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.524 --> 02:00:11.425]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.066 --> 02:00:15.750]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.271 --> 02:00:20.315]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.254 --> 02:00:28.279]  We have a lot of incredible news to cover in this hour with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:00:28.319 --> 02:00:30.301]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:00:31.042 --> 02:00:39.931]  The Chicago Tribune is reporting that the state has changed the laws to be able to take public pension funds of fire, police, school teachers, state workers.
[02:00:40.652 --> 02:00:43.095]  And they're now saying that you're not guaranteed to get your money.
[02:00:43.435 --> 02:00:51.225]  Bloomberg is reporting in the last six months that the feds are ordering pension fund managers, public and private, to quote invest in failed banks.
[02:00:51.706 --> 02:00:55.510]  So they're really moving towards this new scenario of looting and stealing.
[02:00:56.732 --> 02:00:57.352]  Separately,
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.401]  Alex Jones, pleasure to be back!
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:26.205]  I told you during the break that I had Hamid Gul on and I was flattered to hear you were listening and you said you found it interesting.
[02:01:26.486 --> 02:01:30.610]  What was your take on the man our media is now claiming is the new Osama Bin Laden?
[02:01:31.854 --> 02:01:34.555]  Well, I don't listen to the American media at all.
[02:01:35.135 --> 02:01:37.555]  I just don't care what the American media says.
[02:01:37.775 --> 02:01:39.375]  I am part of those Europeans.
[02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:46.597]  If you look at the story that just came out in Newsweek, they said we've entered a new period in Europe here.
[02:01:46.617 --> 02:01:58.159]  It's a post-anti-Americanism that the press in Europe depicts America as a fraying empire of obese, ignorant, debt gridlock, stagnation, and mindless people.
[02:01:59.185 --> 02:01:59.846]  Uh, sure.
[02:02:00.286 --> 02:02:03.708]  And so, basically, nobody... America's not that interesting anymore.
[02:02:03.968 --> 02:02:05.509]  It's a shrinking country.
[02:02:05.549 --> 02:02:07.131]  It's the incredible shrinking country.
[02:02:07.831 --> 02:02:13.335]  It's, uh... It's not a world superpower, because it's the world's super debtor.
[02:02:13.475 --> 02:02:14.315]  It's just got debt.
[02:02:14.375 --> 02:02:15.216]  That's not equity.
[02:02:15.236 --> 02:02:16.437]  It's not bailout jobs.
[02:02:16.557 --> 02:02:27.464]  But it has psychopaths running it, and a brainwashed lithium-head, fluoride-head public with almost a 20-point IQ drop from the chemicals in our water, shitting on top 40,000 nuclear weapons.
[02:02:30.006 --> 02:02:35.370]  So, you know, what the American media says about somebody else, it's worthless.
[02:02:35.530 --> 02:02:36.971]  They have no weight anymore.
[02:02:36.991 --> 02:02:38.212]  They've got no juice.
[02:02:38.532 --> 02:02:38.932]  The U.S.
[02:02:38.972 --> 02:02:42.795]  dollar is being held up with vapors and mirrors.
[02:02:42.815 --> 02:02:49.640]  It's soon to be dropped into the floor, and America will just be in the seventh, eighth, ninth world.
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:50.261]  Who cares?
[02:02:50.581 --> 02:02:51.602]  We're post-America.
[02:02:51.642 --> 02:02:52.362]  America's finished.
[02:02:52.442 --> 02:02:52.843]  It died.
[02:02:53.523 --> 02:02:54.304]  Years ago!
[02:02:54.365 --> 02:02:56.748]  I'm surprised I still get calls from America!
[02:02:56.768 --> 02:02:58.450]  You must be one of the only people left there!
[02:02:58.850 --> 02:02:59.231]  Ha ha!
[02:02:59.732 --> 02:03:00.973]  Max, you know the U.S.
[02:03:01.033 --> 02:03:06.200]  is held by the very same global corporations Europe is, and I think the American empire is dying.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:11.147]  Hopefully, out of this death, we don't get World War III as they try to hold on to it all.
[02:03:12.296 --> 02:03:13.678]  Alright, well, World War III.
[02:03:14.319 --> 02:03:15.761]  I'm glad you brought that up, Alex.
[02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:20.507]  It's being fought right now, really, in the currency wars.
[02:03:20.948 --> 02:03:24.012]  And now, this is very interesting, because for the last few years,
[02:03:24.953 --> 02:03:38.382]  Everybody has come on to television and on radio and talked about how China needs to value their currency higher because they're a currency manipulator and it's not fair that America can't export.
[02:03:38.723 --> 02:03:39.803]  Well, guess what?
[02:03:40.084 --> 02:03:43.986]  China is getting themselves off the dollar peg and guess what they've done?
[02:03:44.186 --> 02:03:51.692]  They're lowering the value of the yuan because they're engaged in a financial war with the U.S.
[02:03:53.233 --> 02:03:54.894]  And for those who don't know, the U.S.
[02:03:54.914 --> 02:04:02.899]  has been begging them to not lower it, and then sometimes changing the policies, asking them to not increase its value.
[02:04:02.919 --> 02:04:03.700]  So what does this mean?
[02:04:05.001 --> 02:04:09.464]  Well, this means that, first of all, China, just this past week, surpassed Japan.
[02:04:09.644 --> 02:04:11.185]  It's now the number two global economy.
[02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:12.712]  Alright, Max, stay there!
[02:04:41.832 --> 02:04:47.679]  Stay there, let's talk about how you see this playing out and unfolding on the other side and where that will lead us.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.604]  We've already got welfare riots coast to coast, people wanting their free goodies.
[02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:58.192]  What's going to happen when the blood flow to the corporate ticks and their dependence ends?
[02:05:01.175 --> 02:05:04.798]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:05.138 --> 02:05:13.264]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:14.005 --> 02:05:18.028]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:18.628 --> 02:05:29.457]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:30.077 --> 02:05:39.079]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:39.579 --> 02:05:44.620]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:45.001 --> 02:05:52.182]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:52.502 --> 02:05:54.903]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:05:59.073 --> 02:06:03.316]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:03.616 --> 02:06:04.237]  Number one.
[02:06:04.537 --> 02:06:07.679]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:08.520]  Number two.
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:13.364]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:13.704 --> 02:06:14.144]  It's true.
[02:06:14.444 --> 02:06:19.008]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:19.328 --> 02:06:19.868]  Number three.
[02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:23.431]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:23.731 --> 02:06:27.434]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:27.634 --> 02:06:28.175]  Number 4.
[02:06:28.435 --> 02:06:30.797]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:31.197 --> 02:06:34.581]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:34.881 --> 02:06:35.081]  Number 5.
[02:06:35.662 --> 02:06:39.585]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.805 --> 02:06:44.570]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:48.892]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.033 --> 02:06:50.593]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.814 --> 02:06:52.895]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:53.075 --> 02:06:55.676]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:58.818 --> 02:07:01.560]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:05.482]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:07:05.742 --> 02:07:08.364]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:07:08.604 --> 02:07:13.627]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:13.987 --> 02:07:15.508]  They're the best company out there.
[02:07:15.748 --> 02:07:19.651]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[02:07:19.931 --> 02:07:21.972]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[02:07:22.272 --> 02:07:25.294]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[02:07:25.614 --> 02:07:27.415]  Try their new Evacuation Pack.
[02:07:27.575 --> 02:07:29.897]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[02:07:30.137 --> 02:07:32.258]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[02:07:32.518 --> 02:07:40.460]  With open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.
[02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:42.881]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[02:07:51.044 --> 02:07:56.065]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.594 --> 02:08:06.636]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:07.557 --> 02:08:09.018]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:18.339 --> 02:08:21.741]  Max Keiser is our guest for the remainder of the hour.
[02:08:21.761 --> 02:08:26.044]  We're going to get into the economy and all the economic news that's coming in.
[02:08:26.804 --> 02:08:34.549]  Max, in Atlanta, Georgia and other cities, we've seen people getting into fights, riots breaking out over food stamps.
[02:08:35.469 --> 02:08:37.491]  We've now got 42 million Americans.
[02:08:37.531 --> 02:08:42.574]  Just a few months ago it was 40 million on food stamps, the equivalent of digital soup lines.
[02:08:43.434 --> 02:08:43.734]  I don't know.
[02:09:01.781 --> 02:09:07.363]  The services are being removed, like Argentina or some other country that's been looted by these people.
[02:09:07.743 --> 02:09:09.264]  These global banks are offshore.
[02:09:09.544 --> 02:09:12.405]  They tried to go into Europe in the last six months and loot that.
[02:09:12.765 --> 02:09:14.686]  Merkel kicked them out, calling them criminal.
[02:09:15.526 --> 02:09:17.327]  So they've come back towards the dollar.
[02:09:18.007 --> 02:09:23.109]  There's some talk of China imploding and a lot of manipulation happening there.
[02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:27.390]  So break down this currency war.
[02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:29.151]  Who's running it and where you see it going?
[02:09:30.017 --> 02:09:32.379]  Well, you know, here's how I'm making money on it.
[02:09:32.399 --> 02:09:36.703]  In other words, I'm not thinking about, uh, saving anybody in America.
[02:09:36.943 --> 02:09:37.363]  Forget them.
[02:09:37.483 --> 02:09:38.024]  They're lost.
[02:09:38.064 --> 02:09:39.065]  They won't save themselves.
[02:09:39.265 --> 02:09:40.266]  So here's how I'm playing it.
[02:09:40.306 --> 02:09:43.588]  I'm buying Corrections Corps of America, straight out of the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:09:43.889 --> 02:09:45.050]  They've got a deal with ICE.
[02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:48.272]  You know, ICE goes out down there and rounds up people and throws them in jail?
[02:09:48.593 --> 02:09:49.653]  They have a deal with ICE.
[02:09:49.974 --> 02:09:51.875]  They pay them $11 million a month.
[02:09:53.317 --> 02:10:02.241]  So the Correctional Corps of America is paying ICE $11 million a month to go round up people to put in prison because prison is a hugely profitable business.
[02:10:02.441 --> 02:10:05.182]  You own the prisons, you own the restaurants, you own the hotels.
[02:10:05.402 --> 02:10:09.063]  So I'm buying CCA, Correctional Corps of America, so bring it on!
[02:10:09.504 --> 02:10:17.667]  All those stupid people who are allowing their government to arrest them and throw them in jail and treat them like slaves and nincompoops.
[02:10:18.147 --> 02:10:19.888]  It's gonna make money for CCA!
[02:10:20.148 --> 02:10:22.509]  In other words, I'm passive, Alex.
[02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:25.190]  I'm not gonna say anything to help anybody there anymore.
[02:10:25.410 --> 02:10:27.291]  Because I'm making money like the rest of the world!
[02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:30.873]  95% of the world's population is not American!
[02:10:31.053 --> 02:10:34.274]  They're looking at America now as a place to just stop money out!
[02:10:34.334 --> 02:10:34.974]  To make money!
[02:10:35.295 --> 02:10:36.855]  It's not a beacon of democracy!
[02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.036]  It's not worth saving!
[02:10:38.456 --> 02:10:42.700]  It's a place to make a few extra bucks and then drop it like a load of garbage on the street.
[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:43.701]  Well, Max, let me stop you.
[02:10:43.741 --> 02:10:45.282]  I know you're being somewhat sarcastic here.
[02:10:45.302 --> 02:10:51.768]  You normally talk about doing things with stocks, you know, to be moral, like going out and trying to, you know, drive down the price of Coca-Cola.
[02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:55.811]  If everybody gets this casino gulag attitude and gives in to the evil...
[02:10:59.955 --> 02:11:01.316]  Look at this story out of the UK.
[02:11:01.556 --> 02:11:05.358]  The NHS is launching a pill with a patch.
[02:11:05.818 --> 02:11:14.043]  You swallow the pill, and then when your body, through the patch, senses that the pill is wearing off, it sends a text email to you to take another pill.
[02:11:15.263 --> 02:11:17.004]  Now if that's not the casino gulag, look it up.
[02:11:17.044 --> 02:11:22.047]  It's called Chippin' Pill, the high-tech tablet that will text you when it's time to take another dose.
[02:11:23.197 --> 02:11:28.101]  So here you have all these people in America, no job, no wages, on food stamps.
[02:11:28.322 --> 02:11:34.006]  So here's a new pill that tells you when to give yourself another pill.
[02:11:34.067 --> 02:11:41.253]  So now you have all these neurotic, psychotic people with no jobs who are being dosed by themselves through their text.
[02:11:42.554 --> 02:11:50.460]  And now the media is proposing lithium in our water and vaccines that literally destroy neurons in the brain to make you docile.
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:53.442]  We are entering something worse than Soylent Green.
[02:11:54.696 --> 02:11:56.037]  Well, yeah, of course.
[02:11:56.077 --> 02:12:03.745]  The technology is there to make it all very high-tech and seamless and cost-efficient for the people.
[02:12:03.765 --> 02:12:06.928]  You know, I am shocked at this Google-Verizon deal.
[02:12:06.988 --> 02:12:15.457]  I mean, I find this to be really hideous because here you have Google that became a $100 billion company riding
[02:12:15.957 --> 02:12:16.617]  On the Internet.
[02:12:16.737 --> 02:12:19.458]  Riding on DARPA, which was built by the American taxpayer.
[02:12:19.519 --> 02:12:22.340]  If it wasn't for the American taxpayer, there would be no Google.
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:25.941]  And now they're turning around and they're shutting the Internet down.
[02:12:26.161 --> 02:12:27.242]  They're creating silos.
[02:12:27.262 --> 02:12:33.224]  They're creating two-tier Internet to enhance their multi-hundred billion dollar profits and to
[02:12:33.824 --> 02:12:35.725]  And that's just at the start!
[02:12:55.157 --> 02:12:56.118]  That's just at the start.
[02:12:56.138 --> 02:12:57.098]  This is Internet 2.
[02:12:57.539 --> 02:13:00.360]  They're doing it because the alternative media is kicking their butt.
[02:13:00.761 --> 02:13:06.744]  The White House admits they're allowing this to happen to move towards shutting down the free web.
[02:13:06.764 --> 02:13:09.806]  So they're really showing us just how criminal they are.
[02:13:09.826 --> 02:13:13.789]  Well, who's going to stop them?
[02:13:14.009 --> 02:13:17.211]  I mean, look, the issue is net neutrality.
[02:13:17.993 --> 02:13:22.700]  And who has just come out in the last week against net neutrality?
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:24.362]  The Tea Party folks.
[02:13:24.823 --> 02:13:25.844]  Now that's absurd!
[02:13:25.864 --> 02:13:33.014]  If you are in support of anything that has anything to do with civil rights and individual rights,
[02:13:33.434 --> 02:13:34.315]  We're good to go.
[02:13:52.066 --> 02:13:59.091]  Well, Max, there's eight different Tea Parties, and four of them are neocon clones, and you're absolutely right.
[02:13:59.491 --> 02:14:01.653]  Net neutrality is the Internet.
[02:14:02.093 --> 02:14:04.655]  If you don't have net neutrality, you don't have an Internet.
[02:14:05.215 --> 02:14:05.595]  That's right.
[02:14:06.476 --> 02:14:07.377]  You've got to support it.
[02:14:07.697 --> 02:14:10.359]  You've made your entire bones on net neutrality.
[02:14:10.439 --> 02:14:16.323]  You have access to your broadcasting, and you're competing head-to-head with CNN, and Fox News, and everybody else.
[02:14:16.623 --> 02:14:20.185]  If we get rid of net neutrality, Alex Jones goes the way of...
[02:14:21.306 --> 02:14:22.226]  Here's why they're doing it.
[02:14:22.727 --> 02:14:24.467]  The mainstream media is in free fall.
[02:14:24.527 --> 02:14:30.629]  The alternative media, a year and a half ago, became bigger than the mainstream media in their own breakdowns and actuaries.
[02:14:31.249 --> 02:14:36.291]  So government doesn't want freedom on the web because we're exposing their absurdist lies and propaganda and stealing.
[02:14:36.871 --> 02:14:38.932]  The big corporations don't want a free web.
[02:14:38.952 --> 02:14:40.872]  And so there's a perfect storm.
[02:14:41.513 --> 02:14:43.393]  I don't think they're going to get away with it, Max.
[02:14:44.134 --> 02:14:46.854]  I think it's going to take them too long to try to strangle the web.
[02:14:47.395 --> 02:14:48.215]  I think they're going to fail.
[02:14:49.417 --> 02:14:54.181]  Well, the key issue that's plugged into this is the copyright law.
[02:14:54.442 --> 02:15:02.969]  Copyright law for now, every time Mickey Mouse is about to enter the public domain, Disney Corporation gets Congress to expand copyright law.
[02:15:03.190 --> 02:15:09.996]  So the people who are in the copyright business, major media, Hollywood film studios, and the labels, they hate the fact that
[02:15:10.656 --> 02:15:17.801]  Eventually, material returns to the public domain from where it came, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in Article 17 of the Constitution.
[02:15:18.281 --> 02:15:31.830]  Intellectual property must return to the public domain from where it came, but the media companies put it on these balance sheets for perpetual copyright protection, thus depriving us of the very intellectual property that we ourselves created.
[02:15:32.170 --> 02:15:38.935]  Now this creates an annuity strain for these media companies, and they hate the fact that P2P file swapping, net neutrality, and
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:46.342]  And that's how they're coming in with prior constraint.
[02:15:46.362 --> 02:15:52.969]  They're saying on the internet too, everything you do will have to be approved and only mega sites will be allowed to be on the web.
[02:15:53.330 --> 02:15:56.253]  You'll have to go through them to get to alternative sites.
[02:15:56.273 --> 02:15:57.254]  This is the end of the web.
[02:15:57.964 --> 02:16:05.372]  Every file that crosses every email is tagged with a number, and it'll go through copyright law protection.
[02:16:05.792 --> 02:16:09.315]  People get in their emails every month a bill.
[02:16:09.776 --> 02:16:15.842]  If they use the word Microsoft in an email, they'll get a bill from Microsoft saying, we have a copyright on the word Microsoft.
[02:16:15.862 --> 02:16:17.524]  You owe us one-tenth of a penny.
[02:16:18.104 --> 02:16:25.807]  So every single month you'll get a bill for the words that you used in your email because these corporations say they own the copyright to these words.
[02:16:26.347 --> 02:16:34.509]  So we can't communicate anymore because we can't afford to communicate anymore because everything is going to be controlled by copyright and Google and Verizon and a two-tier internet.
[02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:39.091]  And by the way, Google is allowed to violate real copyrights.
[02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:45.313]  Entire books and things, they don't get in trouble because they're an admitted NSA, CIA government
[02:16:46.147 --> 02:16:47.408]  Consolidation tool.
[02:16:47.748 --> 02:16:53.613]  But did you see where Sky Television, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is going after Skype?
[02:16:54.033 --> 02:16:57.316]  Because in the word Skype, is the word Sky.
[02:16:57.796 --> 02:17:01.699]  So now, if you write Skylark, they'll sue you.
[02:17:01.959 --> 02:17:05.582]  Because a bird is a Skylark, but it has the word Sky in it.
[02:17:06.002 --> 02:17:08.344]  This is the absurdity of the copyright tyranny.
[02:17:08.894 --> 02:17:34.711]  Right, and we could get around it because it was so absurd, but now with this two-tiered internet, and with the Google-NSA relationship, and the intelligence, and the surveillance, and the Bush era, and now the Obama era, as you point out, the Obama deception, the new laws under the Patriot Act, where they can just read everyone's email, it's all stored on databases, this is all toward a time when every single word that you say
[02:17:35.351 --> 02:17:45.497]  Uh, or right, is going to be tagged and possibly up for violating a copyright law, and of course you will have to pay every month, and since no one will have a job to pay for it, you'll have to go into debt.
[02:17:45.717 --> 02:17:46.877]  So where do you go to spend debt?
[02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:47.898]  Oh, you go to Wall Street!
[02:17:47.958 --> 02:18:02.146]  That's right, Wall Street will be selling you loans to pay for your copyright bill at the end of the month, which of course you'll never get out of, because you can never stop talking, because if you needed to figure out how to pay your copyright bill, you'll use another word that's copyrighted, and it'll go on ad infinitum!
[02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:25.349]  And now they're saying they're going to put cameras and microphones on all street corners, and in all aircraft, and this is Associated Press, all cars, will have a camera that watches you real time, hooked into the local police department and the Threat Fusion Center, and when you say words like McDonald's, you'll be charged copyright, you're not allowed to talk.
[02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:27.631]  So it's also a new thought crime system.
[02:18:27.671 --> 02:18:28.252]  I'm not joking.
[02:18:29.289 --> 02:18:31.350]  Let's talk about this guy.
[02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:32.491]  Who's behind all this?
[02:18:32.831 --> 02:18:34.652]  Well, Wall Street and hedge funds.
[02:18:34.852 --> 02:18:37.173]  Here's a quote from Stephen Schwarzman.
[02:18:37.333 --> 02:18:40.034]  He runs Blackstone, a very big private equity group.
[02:18:40.234 --> 02:18:47.298]  He said if Obama tries to tax us, private equity, it would be like Hitler invading Poland.
[02:18:48.388 --> 02:19:06.494]  Okay, he's pulling out the Hitler invading Poland analogy to describe if he, a private equity group, that has drained hundreds of billions from the public coffers, engaged in market manipulation and insider trading, he's saying if you try to tax any of this money, we're going to consider this an act like Hitler invading Poland.
[02:19:06.795 --> 02:19:14.077]  Which means, of course, they can use the program trading, they can do a flash crash, as they did a couple of months ago, a thousand point drop, any day they want to.
[02:19:14.337 --> 02:19:16.358]  Because they use the financial terrorist tool.
[02:19:16.838 --> 02:19:17.699]  Any day they want to.
[02:19:17.899 --> 02:19:20.600]  They've got an entrenched hedge fund oligarchy.
[02:19:21.201 --> 02:19:25.664]  They're setting the precedent that they can naked body scan us, lie about it and save the images.
[02:19:25.984 --> 02:19:31.267]  They're setting the precedent to put lithium in our water and vaccines to make us serve aisle on record.
[02:19:31.688 --> 02:19:35.770]  They're setting the precedent to do anything they want and then we can do nothing.
[02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:38.892]  They are attempting to break us like a pimp breaks a whore.
[02:19:39.252 --> 02:19:41.074]  They're attempting to fully dominate us.
[02:19:42.014 --> 02:19:43.576]  ...and engage in whatever crimes they want.
[02:19:44.056 --> 02:19:51.463]  I want to ask you about the Wall Street Journal yesterday saying that junk bonds and derivatives are now being issued at a record pace.
[02:19:51.863 --> 02:19:54.285]  The Financial Reform Act allows them to do this.
[02:19:54.826 --> 02:19:56.287]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[02:19:56.387 --> 02:19:57.068]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:57.128 --> 02:19:58.449]  MaxKeiser.com is the website.
[02:19:59.855 --> 02:20:02.217]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:20:02.457 --> 02:20:11.125]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:20:11.285 --> 02:20:23.576]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[02:20:23.756 --> 02:20:24.456]  But don't wait!
[02:20:24.656 --> 02:20:27.619]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[02:20:27.779 --> 02:20:28.139]  We're good.
[02:20:44.892 --> 02:20:47.334]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[02:20:47.414 --> 02:20:49.275]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.295 --> 02:20:49.375]  800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.395 --> 02:20:49.555]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.575 --> 02:20:52.837]  The fall of America and the Western world is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:20:52.857 --> 02:20:56.400]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[02:21:12.489 --> 02:21:26.033]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolfe, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casen, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[02:21:26.133 --> 02:21:31.294]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[02:21:42.057 --> 02:21:47.225]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[02:21:47.245 --> 02:21:49.408]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[02:21:49.428 --> 02:21:50.049]  fallofamerica.net.
[02:21:59.724 --> 02:22:03.389]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:09.218]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:09.699 --> 02:22:10.760]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:14.846]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:15.487 --> 02:22:28.912]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:29.292 --> 02:22:34.614]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:34.894 --> 02:22:40.796]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:22:41.536 --> 02:22:42.798]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:42.818 --> 02:22:44.319]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:22:44.339 --> 02:22:44.780]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:46.983]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:22:47.003 --> 02:22:47.063]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.973 --> 02:23:08.059]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:23:08.199 --> 02:23:11.542]  So what's the best way to get ready, to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:23:11.742 --> 02:23:21.188]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:23:21.348 --> 02:23:26.592]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:23:26.872 --> 02:23:29.033]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent.
[02:23:29.353 --> 02:23:40.197]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[02:23:40.357 --> 02:23:42.138]  With absolutely no apologies.
[02:23:42.318 --> 02:23:46.820]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:47.400]  That's right.
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:51.023]  Free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:23:51.123 --> 02:23:53.104]  That's OffTheGridNews.com.

[02:24:12.674 --> 02:24:22.819]  Well, the Wall Street Journal, Business Insider, many others are reporting companies are falling over themselves, issue even more junk bonds, basically a form of derivative, than last year's record.
[02:24:22.899 --> 02:24:37.945]  So, what's happened with this Financial Reform Act is it's given the top banksters even more power to do whatever they want, and they're also reporting that every economic indicator shows this country is deteriorating very, very quickly.
[02:24:38.285 --> 02:24:41.367]  I mean, they're hell-bent on running this country into the ground, Max Keiser.
[02:24:42.506 --> 02:24:42.866]  Well, yeah.
[02:24:43.006 --> 02:24:44.426]  I mean, the scam works this way.
[02:24:44.446 --> 02:24:51.168]  Let's say you're a bank and you've got, uh, your, your value is, uh, $40 billion.
[02:24:52.028 --> 02:24:54.388]  And you, now you're going to sell some junk bonds.
[02:24:54.828 --> 02:24:57.749]  So you put up the bank's asset as collateral.
[02:24:58.129 --> 02:25:02.670]  You sell 40 billion, uh, you borrow essentially 40 more billion dollars.
[02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:07.150]  Uh, the CEO pays himself a $4 billion bonus.
[02:25:08.151 --> 02:25:10.531]  And now the company has $40 billion more in debt.
[02:25:11.914 --> 02:25:14.215]  Six months later or nine months later, it can't pay the debt.
[02:25:14.235 --> 02:25:17.156]  So it goes to the government, and the government has to bail them out again.
[02:25:17.876 --> 02:25:25.198]  So all the bailout money that was given to Wall Street, the hundreds of billions, trillions given to Wall Street, they are sitting on it.
[02:25:25.458 --> 02:25:28.919]  They're using it to pay off the debt, and they're paying themselves huge bonuses and salaries.
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:34.001]  Now, they're selling hundreds of billions of more junk bonds today.
[02:25:34.581 --> 02:25:36.802]  Nine months from now, they will not be able to pay.
[02:25:37.648 --> 02:25:38.148]  They know that.
[02:25:38.649 --> 02:25:47.715]  And they'll go back to the government, and they'll put the gun to the government's head, and they'll say, either give us another $5 trillion, or we're going to crash your economy like we did back in October 2008 with Hank Paulson.
[02:25:48.175 --> 02:25:56.822]  And the government, of course, Barack Obama, having no spine whatsoever, will just give them another $5 to $10 trillion, or give them some other multi-hundred billion dollar bonus.
[02:25:57.042 --> 02:26:02.626]  How can Wall Street continue to pay itself record bonuses if the economy is having record losses?
[02:26:03.433 --> 02:26:04.773]  There's a disconnect there.
[02:26:05.073 --> 02:26:06.614]  Well, the answer is quite easy.
[02:26:06.634 --> 02:26:09.434]  It's a kleptocracy of Wall Street bankers.
[02:26:09.674 --> 02:26:14.375]  They've got a gun to the head of Congress, and anytime that Congress flinches, they do a flash crash.
[02:26:14.715 --> 02:26:15.736]  They just crash the market.
[02:26:15.936 --> 02:26:18.376]  Financial terrorism, as I explained on your show last time.
[02:26:18.576 --> 02:26:26.018]  They just have a computer algorithm that goes in there to sell, overwhelms the specialist system, drops the price of stocks down.
[02:26:26.098 --> 02:26:26.778]  Everyone panics.
[02:26:26.998 --> 02:26:30.219]  Nancy Pelosi gets her little knickers in a twist and runs around like,
[02:26:31.419 --> 02:26:32.680]  I don't know.
[02:26:49.105 --> 02:26:52.086]  The local tax is going up, the federal tax is going up.
[02:26:52.567 --> 02:26:58.970]  Wall Street is the main lobbyist for taxes on the little guy, but almost no taxes on themselves.
[02:26:59.450 --> 02:27:01.611]  I mean, this is a criminal... Because they're doing God's work!
[02:27:01.811 --> 02:27:04.813]  You know, Lloyd Blankfein, oh, I'm doing God's work!
[02:27:04.933 --> 02:27:06.553]  That was his explanation.
[02:27:06.573 --> 02:27:09.935]  We have to make money, because we're like the Vatican of America.
[02:27:10.355 --> 02:27:11.956]  We have a direct line with God!
[02:27:12.276 --> 02:27:14.817]  If we don't make money, it means that there's no trickle-down.
[02:27:14.977 --> 02:27:21.700]  There's no trickle-down out of the end of our pants, down onto the faces of those Americans that they're putting into the street, mud down, face in the mud.
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:23.240]  The guy is a terrorist!
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:25.741]  Why can't we stop being brought up on charges right now?
[02:27:26.021 --> 02:27:27.702]  And how do you see them?
[02:27:27.842 --> 02:27:30.203]  Because we know they've already stolen most of the pension fund money.
[02:27:30.283 --> 02:27:31.783]  Bloomberg reported that back in March.
[02:27:32.984 --> 02:27:35.225]  And then now we have the Chicago Tribune.
[02:27:35.585 --> 02:27:38.026]  Can the Illinois pension catastrophe be stopped?
[02:27:39.006 --> 02:27:39.467]  I don't
[02:27:57.077 --> 02:28:16.648]  State employees' pension funds, and what we've seen them do in Argentina and Nigeria and other places is, they'll say, we're taking half of it, the government will hold the other half, your check will be half as big, but if you don't go along with this, you'll lose it all, and then a few years later they'll steal half of that half, then half of that half, but because they do it in a process
[02:28:17.228 --> 02:28:23.571]  Just like the CPS takes your child in a process, people just say, okay, take my pension fund.
[02:28:23.951 --> 02:28:27.412]  The government will say, that's right, now drink your fluoride and die of cancer, trash.
[02:28:27.793 --> 02:28:30.614]  And the police and everybody will say, yes sir, we love it!
[02:28:31.254 --> 02:28:35.016]  And then the cops will take their six-year-old to the doctor and they'll say, your son has leukemia.
[02:28:35.056 --> 02:28:37.417]  And the cop will say, good, I love the government.
[02:28:37.637 --> 02:28:42.699]  Let's give my son more aspartame drinks and maybe some lithium.
[02:28:43.019 --> 02:28:44.600]  I mean, they just love it, don't they, Max?
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:50.568]  I think the Argentina comparison is the best one to make, and I've been saying this for years.
[02:28:50.648 --> 02:28:55.575]  You know, people make comparisons to different economies during different periods of stress.
[02:28:55.895 --> 02:29:01.003]  You know, you look at the Japanese economy, people are saying, oh, deflation like we had in Japan for the last 20 years.
[02:29:01.844 --> 02:29:03.065]  But this is different.
[02:29:03.085 --> 02:29:04.486]  This is a kleptocracy.
[02:29:04.506 --> 02:29:06.147]  You really have to go to Argentina, 2000-2001.
[02:29:06.467 --> 02:29:12.852]  And there's a fantastic 12-part YouTube series on this if you look at collapse in Argentina.
[02:29:13.112 --> 02:29:13.913]  And they go through it.
[02:29:14.353 --> 02:29:17.355]  And I met, actually, the filmmaker was here in Paris and we talked about it a little bit.
[02:29:17.916 --> 02:29:22.099]  And it's just a process where the banks and the government get together and they loot.
[02:29:22.959 --> 02:29:23.439]  The money.
[02:29:23.859 --> 02:29:31.962]  And the reason why they're doing this is because the ability for the American economy to generate any growth or inflation at this point is zero.
[02:29:32.262 --> 02:29:41.206]  Because all of the assets that have been used as collateral to sustain a 25-year borrowing and spending consumer bin are still collapsing in value.
[02:29:41.226 --> 02:29:45.947]  Alright, well let's talk about how the collapse is going to take place with Max Keiser straight ahead.
[02:29:45.967 --> 02:29:47.348]  A lot of other key news as well.
[02:29:49.659 --> 02:29:52.644]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.585 --> 02:29:56.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.113 --> 02:30:03.957]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:04.077 --> 02:30:04.837]  What have we got?
[02:30:05.077 --> 02:30:07.199]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:07.519 --> 02:30:08.240]  A republic.
[02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:11.102]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:11.162 --> 02:30:13.083]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:13.444 --> 02:30:15.345]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:15.465 --> 02:30:16.746]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:17.146 --> 02:30:18.267]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:18.467 --> 02:30:18.868]  Children?
[02:30:19.068 --> 02:30:19.848]  Our education?
[02:30:20.189 --> 02:30:20.789]  Our money?
[02:30:21.009 --> 02:30:24.672]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.

[02:30:29.998 --> 02:30:30.819]  We have the facts.
[02:30:31.019 --> 02:30:32.140]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:33.062]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:33.102 --> 02:30:33.923]  We have common law.
[02:30:33.983 --> 02:30:36.245]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:36.506 --> 02:30:40.290]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:32:50.911 --> 02:32:51.732]  Thank you!
[02:32:58.524 --> 02:33:00.445]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:01.385]  A lie!
[02:33:01.805 --> 02:33:03.485]  No man is obsolete!
[02:33:03.805 --> 02:33:05.646]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:05.686 --> 02:33:08.567]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:33:08.927 --> 02:33:14.008]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:33:14.368 --> 02:33:17.129]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect!
[02:33:17.569 --> 02:33:21.632]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:33:22.233 --> 02:33:23.334]  I am a human being!
[02:33:23.754 --> 02:33:26.136]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:26.777 --> 02:33:29.038]  That have no substance and no dimension!
[02:33:29.479 --> 02:33:30.960]  Like air, like the wind!
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:32.181]  I don't care!
[02:33:32.621 --> 02:33:33.602]  I tell you, I don't care!
[02:33:33.622 --> 02:33:35.684]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[02:33:36.792 --> 02:33:42.415]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:33:42.935 --> 02:33:45.617]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:46.077 --> 02:33:53.521]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[02:33:53.781 --> 02:33:59.124]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the strength has no use for your kind!
[02:34:00.788 --> 02:34:04.331]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:04.912 --> 02:34:06.693]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:09.215 --> 02:34:12.298]  Max Keiser is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:34:12.318 --> 02:34:14.740]  We're about to go right back to him here in just a moment.
[02:34:16.516 --> 02:34:22.137]  I wanted to hit some of the news that's up on the network website GCNLive.com.
[02:34:22.157 --> 02:34:24.958]  The letters GCNLive.com.
[02:34:25.418 --> 02:34:28.459]  Hal Turner betrayed and burned by government he served.
[02:34:28.919 --> 02:34:36.281]  Dealing with the government agent neo-Nazi who they now flush down the toilet just like the torturers who followed Bush's orders.
[02:34:36.621 --> 02:34:40.362]  He comes out and brags he ordered torture but they go to prison when they get caught.
[02:34:40.662 --> 02:34:42.983]  Key article by Curt Nemo at GCNLive.com.
[02:34:43.003 --> 02:34:44.443]  It's also up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:44.963 --> 02:34:45.543]  Here's another one.
[02:34:45.583 --> 02:34:47.884]  Neocons are prepping us for war with Iran.
[02:34:47.964 --> 02:34:48.604]  Ray McGovern.
[02:34:48.964 --> 02:34:52.065]  That's at GCNLive.com and it dovetails with Kurt Nemo's article.
[02:34:52.445 --> 02:34:53.405]  We're not saying this.
[02:34:53.445 --> 02:35:00.686]  The neocons are saying that they're going to fuel those nuclear reactors on the 21st of this month and they must be attacked before then.
[02:35:01.087 --> 02:35:03.847]  And Ray McGovern agrees that they may green light it the next week.
[02:35:03.867 --> 02:35:04.867]  Let's pray that isn't the case.
[02:35:05.227 --> 02:35:06.608]  That article at GCNLive.com.
[02:35:07.648 --> 02:35:12.529]  Bob Chapman's got an article, Dreadful Market Predictions, dealing with the Hindenburg Omen.
[02:35:12.549 --> 02:35:15.910]  I'm going to ask Max Keiser about that in just a moment.
[02:35:16.651 --> 02:35:23.873]  But another story here in my stack deals with record drug recalls from CNN.
[02:35:24.853 --> 02:35:40.204]  I mean, record recalls of powdered milk, of formula, recalls of... More and more companies are acting like there's nothing left in the future, and so just criminality and an every-man-for-himself attitude is happening, which is only going to make the crisis worse.
[02:35:40.244 --> 02:35:47.889]  It's not going to help all these self-serving yuppies that think it's a virtue to be arrogant, mindless idiots drinking sodium fluoride and lithium.
[02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:52.052]  But Max Keiser dealing with this, I'm sure you saw the report,
[02:35:52.512 --> 02:35:52.812]  Yeah, I did.
[02:36:15.683 --> 02:36:25.527]  Well, because Israel is the new apartheid state, like South Africa, and they want to divest out of Israel because of this growing movement to divest and boycott Israel.
[02:36:25.587 --> 02:36:34.051]  Because Israel is operating a ghetto in the form of Palestine, and there's a global movement to punish Israel and to get them out of the ghetto.
[02:36:34.471 --> 02:36:37.656]  Harvard is full of big Israel supporters.
[02:36:38.037 --> 02:36:40.521]  I mean, that's where Elena Kagan and Cass Sunstein came from.
[02:36:40.541 --> 02:36:44.067]  I mean, I don't think it's because they didn't say why they did it.
[02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:46.191]  I think it's because they know war's coming.
[02:36:46.803 --> 02:36:58.669]  Well, they said that Israel is no longer a growth story, and that it's an emerging market, that they're going to now go into other areas like Brazil and China, which they consider to be an emerging market.
[02:36:59.089 --> 02:37:04.592]  But look, Israel is really losing.
[02:37:04.852 --> 02:37:06.312]  This is my take on Israel.
[02:37:06.512 --> 02:37:11.995]  They're going to attack Iran, and then America is going to do to Israel what they did to the South Vietnamese.
[02:37:12.255 --> 02:37:13.656]  They're going to abandon them.
[02:37:14.136 --> 02:37:21.202]  And Israel is going to be out there with their, you know what in their hand, attacking Iran with nobody backing them up.
[02:37:21.702 --> 02:37:24.645]  So we're going to go back to 1947, pre-Israel.
[02:37:27.927 --> 02:37:32.231]  Oh, I think when terrorists attack, or the government stages attacks, that the U.S.
[02:37:32.271 --> 02:37:33.392]  military is going to get behind them.
[02:37:34.565 --> 02:37:35.265]  I don't know.
[02:37:35.385 --> 02:37:35.845]  The U.S.
[02:37:35.885 --> 02:37:38.726]  military never gets behind any of their so-called allies.
[02:37:38.766 --> 02:37:39.406]  They couldn't run.
[02:37:39.946 --> 02:37:42.427]  The South Vietnamese are just one example.
[02:37:42.447 --> 02:37:43.187]  They're famous for this.
[02:37:43.507 --> 02:37:44.347]  They talk big.
[02:37:44.487 --> 02:37:45.667]  They flash the big star.
[02:37:45.687 --> 02:37:47.128]  They get the Ronald Reagan hat on.
[02:37:47.148 --> 02:37:48.648]  They go, yeah, go over the hill.
[02:37:48.928 --> 02:37:52.049]  Then the guys, they all attack, and then they go, oh, we were just kidding.
[02:37:52.089 --> 02:37:54.009]  We're back home, you know, smoking a bowl.
[02:37:54.229 --> 02:37:55.469]  You know, we don't really care.
[02:37:55.529 --> 02:37:57.470]  We're just here with a world reserve currency.
[02:37:57.650 --> 02:37:58.230]  We're writing checks.
[02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:59.070]  We never have to cash.
[02:37:59.290 --> 02:38:02.231]  We're down here at Starbucks just slurping up all these bad lattes.
[02:38:02.271 --> 02:38:02.931]  We don't go.
[02:38:03.011 --> 02:38:04.091]  It's your problem now, buddy.
[02:38:05.155 --> 02:38:06.715]  That's what I think.
[02:38:06.935 --> 02:38:14.857]  So Harvard knows, basically, that Israel and the shekel are about to crash, because Israel's about to commit the stupidest thing of their history.
[02:38:14.877 --> 02:38:15.977]  They're going to invade Iran.
[02:38:15.997 --> 02:38:17.458]  The shekel's going to crash.
[02:38:17.658 --> 02:38:19.238]  The Israeli stock market's going to crash.
[02:38:19.458 --> 02:38:21.598]  Harvard's like, oh, oh, it's the emerging market.
[02:38:21.619 --> 02:38:22.339]  We're going to get out of here.
[02:38:22.539 --> 02:38:25.319]  They're a greedy little, you know, so-and-so.
[02:38:25.359 --> 02:38:27.020]  Well, that is one thing I've noticed.
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:28.140]  These global bankers
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:36.807]  We'll even screw their own, and just like Madoff was cheating all these Jews, I think you've got a point there.
[02:38:37.348 --> 02:38:39.089]  Yeah, but it's going to crash!
[02:38:39.169 --> 02:38:39.990]  Israel's going to crash!
[02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:41.011]  The shekel's going to crash!
[02:38:41.331 --> 02:38:47.897]  Now, you know, I went on your show last year on record, and I said that online gambling is going to become a reality.
[02:38:48.077 --> 02:38:49.499]  Here's a headline from two days ago.
[02:38:50.079 --> 02:38:54.123]  Federal online gambling legislation clears big hurdle.
[02:38:54.958 --> 02:38:56.720]  Sponsored by Barney Frank.
[02:38:57.141 --> 02:38:57.461]  Okay?
[02:38:57.721 --> 02:39:00.024]  Online gambling is coming to America.
[02:39:00.064 --> 02:39:02.527]  The Castino Gulag is coming, Alex!
[02:39:04.629 --> 02:39:07.872]  And then meanwhile, those of us that want to produce and want to be decent...
[02:39:08.874 --> 02:39:12.718]  You can convert your methamphetamine habit to a gambling habit and help the U.S.
[02:39:12.738 --> 02:39:14.259]  government pay its debt to China.
[02:39:33.149 --> 02:39:45.374]  Hey, speaking of truth, you know, Alex, let me take this moment to remind you that on piratemyfilm.com, the Alex in Wonderland project, the symbol is truth.
[02:39:45.914 --> 02:39:47.335]  T-R-U-T-H.
[02:39:47.375 --> 02:39:52.257]  That's the symbol for the project I have dedicated to you on piratemyfilm.com.
[02:39:52.437 --> 02:39:55.218]  You should go to that site immediately and check it out.
[02:39:56.698 --> 02:40:00.800]  And how that works is if people invest in it, then you'll make the film and they'll share in the profit.
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:04.141]  Well, we reserve a share right now.
[02:40:04.241 --> 02:40:08.343]  When we get to 100% and 60% funded, I'm trying to raise $5,000.
[02:40:09.163 --> 02:40:15.186]  Once we raise $5,000, we go make the film, then we play it on the internet, and we share the ad revenue.
[02:40:15.866 --> 02:40:16.607]  With everybody.
[02:40:16.627 --> 02:40:17.708]  It's only 5,000?
[02:40:17.948 --> 02:40:20.230]  Your stuff gets seen by millions of people.
[02:40:20.251 --> 02:40:22.853]  I should fund Alex and Wonderland.
[02:40:23.213 --> 02:40:24.955]  I want to see Max Keiser make a movie.
[02:40:25.015 --> 02:40:25.776]  I called Matt.
[02:40:25.876 --> 02:40:27.037]  I emailed Matt to do this.
[02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:30.881]  But he's out there in the back, you know, smoking a cigarette or something.
[02:40:30.921 --> 02:40:31.782]  Get that guy Matt.
[02:40:32.102 --> 02:40:33.583]  Matt's got to get on the job here.
[02:40:33.603 --> 02:40:34.945]  He's a flacker.
[02:40:35.005 --> 02:40:35.726]  Matt's a flacker.
[02:40:36.506 --> 02:40:37.868]  You know, Matt... Is he Generation X?
[02:40:38.988 --> 02:40:39.268]  No, no.
[02:40:39.989 --> 02:40:41.270]  Matt Ryan doesn't smoke.
[02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:42.511]  What's he doing?
[02:40:42.551 --> 02:40:45.773]  He's driving around his Corvette with the top down, looking at all the girls.
[02:40:46.033 --> 02:40:47.214]  He's not doing anything!
[02:40:47.334 --> 02:40:47.654]  No, no.
[02:40:47.674 --> 02:40:48.275]  He's married.
[02:40:48.575 --> 02:40:51.317]  But the rest of them are outside smoking cigarettes.
[02:40:52.018 --> 02:40:52.598]  Him and Phil.
[02:40:52.618 --> 02:40:55.840]  Somebody's got to crack the whip over there, Alex, okay?
[02:40:56.101 --> 02:40:57.682]  PirateMyFilm.com.
[02:40:57.882 --> 02:41:00.064]  The symbol is truth.
[02:41:00.244 --> 02:41:04.347]  And $5,000 is so low because your crew is a bunch of slackers.
[02:41:06.207 --> 02:41:06.867]  Let's be fair.
[02:41:07.447 --> 02:41:14.689]  They come to me every two or three days with stacks of Max Keiser emails and ask me to look at them and then I say I'm too busy.
[02:41:15.249 --> 02:41:16.429]  I don't email anymore.
[02:41:16.449 --> 02:41:17.429]  I don't bother with you.
[02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:18.029]  I don't care.
[02:41:18.049 --> 02:41:21.390]  It doesn't matter because I know that they're just using the rolling paper.
[02:41:21.610 --> 02:41:23.030]  Hey Max!
[02:41:23.050 --> 02:41:24.491]  Max!
[02:41:24.571 --> 02:41:24.751]  Max!
[02:41:24.791 --> 02:41:25.951]  We love having you on.
[02:41:25.971 --> 02:41:30.112]  And they're always like, we got pirate of my film emails here.
[02:41:30.132 --> 02:41:31.972]  And I'm like, great, let Max do it.
[02:41:32.632 --> 02:41:33.733]  So it's not their fault.
[02:41:33.793 --> 02:41:35.013]  It's my fault, Lord Keiser.
[02:41:35.908 --> 02:41:36.809]  Alright, fine.
[02:41:36.829 --> 02:41:38.549]  Well, you're a stand-up guy.
[02:41:38.709 --> 02:41:41.531]  You know, that's why you should be running the country over there in America.
[02:41:41.571 --> 02:41:43.372]  Why don't you become a senator?
[02:41:43.452 --> 02:41:45.092]  You know, Peter Schiff ran for senator.
[02:41:45.833 --> 02:41:49.454]  Unfortunately, the people in Connecticut are too stupid to vote for a smart guy.
[02:41:49.474 --> 02:41:52.656]  You know, why don't you become the senator from Texas?
[02:41:52.676 --> 02:41:58.599]  Why don't you become emperor and be Maximilian Kaiser, global ruler?
[02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.930]  In Europe.
[02:41:59.950 --> 02:42:01.991]  In Europe, my friend.
[02:42:02.171 --> 02:42:03.092]  I'm making inroads.
[02:42:03.753 --> 02:42:06.355]  The globalization of the Max Geyser meme!
[02:42:06.735 --> 02:42:08.697]  But go to piratemyfilm.com.
[02:42:08.797 --> 02:42:09.377]  It's TRUTH.
[02:42:09.617 --> 02:42:10.358]  T-R-U-T-H.
[02:42:10.598 --> 02:42:11.419]  Alex in Wonderland.
[02:42:12.039 --> 02:42:20.086]  I can raise the budget, and I want to make Matt, or somebody from your crew, the official producer on the site, just send me an email, and I'll make you guys the producers.
[02:42:20.166 --> 02:42:22.948]  No, I'm not involved in your investment operation.
[02:42:23.409 --> 02:42:25.670]  If you want to make a movie about me, that's fine.
[02:42:25.991 --> 02:42:28.593]  But, I mean, tell us about Alex in Wonderland, then.
[02:42:29.847 --> 02:42:36.832]  Well, the project, the way Prior to My Film works is, you put up a project and you find out what people, you know, what the appetite for the project is.
[02:42:36.852 --> 02:42:38.032]  You just reserve a share.
[02:42:38.053 --> 02:42:40.814]  If you don't like the way the film is developing, you cancel your reservation.
[02:42:41.034 --> 02:42:42.455]  You're not committing any money.
[02:42:43.096 --> 02:42:47.919]  Once you get to 100% of the reservation, then you get the email that says, OK, we raised $5,000.
[02:42:48.399 --> 02:42:53.363]  If you're still interested, we'll debit you $5 and we'll go make this film.
[02:42:53.583 --> 02:42:59.567]  But during the process of the few months leading up to it, it can change 100 times, depending on what people really want.
[02:42:59.827 --> 02:43:00.787]  That's what they want us to do.
[02:43:00.807 --> 02:43:06.008]  So right now, the film is about, you know, Alex Jones goes mainstream in America.
[02:43:06.028 --> 02:43:11.909]  Basically, he replaces Larry King, and America finally wakes up, and there's a new dawn in America.
[02:43:12.089 --> 02:43:17.150]  But if that idea stinks, people can say, you know what, forget it, I don't like that idea, and it can evolve.
[02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:19.650]  But during the whole process, nobody puts up any money.
[02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:28.292]  So in total, it gets to a point where people are like, yeah, I like that idea, then we go make the film, we get a director, we get a producer, then we play it on the web,
[02:43:29.973 --> 02:43:30.393]  I got it.
[02:43:30.433 --> 02:43:30.793]  I got it.
[02:43:30.813 --> 02:43:31.133]  I get it.
[02:43:31.173 --> 02:43:31.413]  I get it.
[02:43:31.433 --> 02:43:32.034]  It's very interesting.
[02:43:32.714 --> 02:43:36.976]  Now, Max, in the time we've got left with you, some other issues that need to be gotten into.
[02:43:37.356 --> 02:43:40.158]  Specifically, you've been predicting this crash.
[02:43:40.658 --> 02:43:43.880]  The system shows that they're only going in a direction that'll make it worse.
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:52.868]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury, Wall Street Journal editor, he agrees it's being done by design to create a road warrior level collapse.
[02:43:53.248 --> 02:44:00.075]  Then the bankers will just move offshore with all the blood they've sucked out of us when we're just a dry skeleton laying in the corner.
[02:44:00.635 --> 02:44:04.436]  How do you see this unfolding in the next few months, the next year?
[02:44:04.796 --> 02:44:06.016]  What's the time frame here?
[02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:12.417]  Because they've gone from saying we're in a wonderful economy to, okay, it's a double-dip recession going into a depression.
[02:44:12.457 --> 02:44:15.378]  So they've stopped lying to a certain extent.
[02:44:15.418 --> 02:44:16.278]  Where is all this going?
[02:44:17.178 --> 02:44:18.679]  The economy died in 2008.
[02:44:18.859 --> 02:44:20.279]  It was dead.
[02:44:20.439 --> 02:44:21.799]  It had no heartbeat at all.
[02:44:22.059 --> 02:44:23.459]  There's a dead corpse called the U.S.
[02:44:23.519 --> 02:44:23.900]  economy.
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:26.080]  Obama came in with the stimulus.
[02:44:26.678 --> 02:44:29.541]  Which was basically putting a blood transfusion to the corpse.
[02:44:29.761 --> 02:44:31.682]  I'm on my mobile phone.
[02:44:31.702 --> 02:44:34.265]  Did I scream like that much?
[02:44:45.342 --> 02:44:47.243]  I'm standing on top of the Eiffel Tower.
[02:44:47.383 --> 02:44:49.825]  There's too many Parisians on their cell phones right now.
[02:44:49.885 --> 02:44:50.986]  It sounds a little fishy.
[02:44:51.506 --> 02:44:54.028]  All right, let me move locations here.
[02:44:54.048 --> 02:44:54.648]  How's that?
[02:44:54.688 --> 02:44:55.428]  Is that a little better?
[02:44:55.829 --> 02:44:56.709]  Stand on your head.
[02:44:58.450 --> 02:44:59.451]  I'm on my head.
[02:44:59.511 --> 02:45:00.852]  Now you want me to stand up regular?
[02:45:01.792 --> 02:45:04.674]  Well, see, now that we're joking around... Oh, Kaiser.
[02:45:05.795 --> 02:45:06.856]  Can you hear me any better?
[02:45:06.876 --> 02:45:08.096]  A little bit better.
[02:45:08.136 --> 02:45:09.197]  Why don't you go outside?
[02:45:09.217 --> 02:45:10.938]  Are you serious?
[02:45:12.439 --> 02:45:13.260]  It's not working.
[02:45:15.066 --> 02:45:15.767]  Oh my God.
[02:45:15.787 --> 02:45:17.028]  Oh, it's working, it's working.
[02:45:17.248 --> 02:45:18.929]  Okay, what do you see happening with the economy?
[02:45:19.549 --> 02:45:25.394]  Alright, look, when you see this sort of quantitative easing, you see this in the press all the time.
[02:45:25.934 --> 02:45:26.775]  What does that mean?
[02:45:27.515 --> 02:45:39.124]  It means, basically, that the Federal Reserve Bank, which accepted from Wall Street roughly $3 trillion in their bad loans, they are unable to roll them.
[02:45:39.264 --> 02:45:40.625]  They're unable to move them.
[02:45:40.645 --> 02:45:42.066]  They're unable to sell them.
[02:45:53.074 --> 02:45:54.035]  Max, hold it there!
[02:45:54.155 --> 02:45:56.997]  We're going to disconnect and call you right back and see if that fixes the line.
[02:45:57.377 --> 02:46:04.401]  Joining us from Paris, the expatriate Max Keiser, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, made a lot of very accurate predictions.
[02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:06.162]  We're going to get him back on with us.
[02:46:06.202 --> 02:46:07.963]  His cell phone's usually better than his landline.
[02:46:08.903 --> 02:46:12.685]  And we always have Skype problems with him, or we'd have him be a video uplink with us.
[02:46:12.725 --> 02:46:15.826]  Of course, he's a TV host with BBC, RT.
[02:46:16.426 --> 02:46:17.927]  He's done shows with Al Jazeera.
[02:46:17.967 --> 02:46:20.448]  He has his own radio show, Saturdays, here on Genesis.
[02:46:21.309 --> 02:46:25.611]  And he's a very colorful fellow who at least joins us once a month when a bunch of stuff's happening.
[02:46:25.631 --> 02:46:26.991]  He sometimes joins us twice a month.
[02:46:27.471 --> 02:46:28.392]  He joined us two weeks ago.
[02:46:28.432 --> 02:46:30.833]  We re-aired it Thursday when I was hanging out with Jesse Ventura.
[02:46:31.153 --> 02:46:32.053]  Wasn't really hanging out.
[02:46:32.094 --> 02:46:34.875]  Jesse came here to work on a project with me, this television show.
[02:46:35.795 --> 02:46:37.356]  Uh, but I had to take off Thursday.
[02:46:37.536 --> 02:46:40.118]  Watson sat in, uh, for one of the hours.
[02:46:40.558 --> 02:46:42.599]  Okay, uh, quantitative easing.
[02:46:42.619 --> 02:46:51.865]  They're now admitting that they're monetizing debt, uh, and the Federal Reserve is basically charging us for the right for taxpayers to give them money.
[02:46:51.925 --> 02:46:52.806]  Max, please continue.
[02:46:53.584 --> 02:46:53.924]  Right.
[02:46:54.064 --> 02:46:59.566]  In other words, the system in 2008, systemically, it completely broke down.
[02:46:59.606 --> 02:47:01.307]  This is what people don't understand.
[02:47:01.807 --> 02:47:04.008]  Money is not moving at all in the system.
[02:47:04.468 --> 02:47:05.528]  There's no credit.
[02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:06.288]  There's no loans.
[02:47:06.368 --> 02:47:07.869]  It's absolutely dead.
[02:47:09.229 --> 02:47:16.332]  But the Fed took on board a couple of trillion in these awful Wall Street debts.
[02:47:16.992 --> 02:47:18.293]  But they can't sell them.
[02:47:18.313 --> 02:47:19.233]  They can't roll them.
[02:47:19.273 --> 02:47:20.493]  They can't refinance them.
[02:47:20.513 --> 02:47:22.434]  So they're going to print up more money.
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.102]  Well, here's the beautiful thing about it.
[02:47:25.142 --> 02:47:35.153]  This is what makes this just an unbelievable thing to watch, is that the Fed will say, we're going to print up $2 trillion more to help roll this bad debt.
[02:47:35.513 --> 02:47:43.842]  And on that day, Wall Street will tell the Fed, oh, by the way, did we fail to mention we've got another $5 trillion of bad debt right here that we didn't tell you about?
[02:47:44.685 --> 02:47:46.127]  It's exactly what happened in the UK.
[02:47:46.147 --> 02:47:51.993]  The UK, when the new government came into office under Cameron, they had 800 billion in debt.
[02:47:52.013 --> 02:47:54.556]  It was the biggest debt the country had in generations.
[02:47:54.916 --> 02:47:58.580]  The second they came into office, the Treasury reported to No.
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:02.925]  10 Downing Street, oh, the number's not 800 billion, it's 5 trillion pounds in debt.
[02:48:03.265 --> 02:48:04.566]  That's five times their GDP.
[02:48:05.527 --> 02:48:06.548]  Same thing's going to happen now.
[02:48:06.708 --> 02:48:12.834]  The Fed's going to say, oh yeah, we're in quantitative easing, we need to print up 2 trillion more in paper to roll this horrible debt.
[02:48:13.174 --> 02:48:18.299]  And Walter's going to say, oh by the way, we've got another 5, 6 trillion of bad debt we didn't tell you.
[02:48:18.799 --> 02:48:26.126]  So that means that the crisis and the real estate market and the jobs and the wages are going to continue to fall like a rock.
[02:48:26.226 --> 02:48:48.869]  And the best part is we get to have our taxes raised to pay for all this free money we give the bankers who are also trying to pass carbon taxes to shut down the economy even more because as they destroy us all we've got is them and then they get even more power out of it and the cops don't know it, the bureaucrats don't know it, the yuppies just know how to have coach handbags and drink coffee and act cool.
[02:48:49.509 --> 02:48:54.873]  And the real men are running around, you know, in their UFC shirts talking about beating up other people.
[02:48:55.373 --> 02:48:57.995]  And everybody else is drinking fluoride and sucking their thumb.
[02:48:58.315 --> 02:48:59.556]  So this sounds good, Max.
[02:48:59.596 --> 02:49:00.577]  This sounds really good.
[02:49:19.589 --> 02:49:22.771]  And I was also reading how they're having record people sign up for the military now.
[02:49:22.791 --> 02:49:26.213]  It's the only job they've got and now they will police us domestically.
[02:49:26.594 --> 02:49:27.114]  This is great.
[02:49:27.134 --> 02:49:35.059]  Instead of the welfare guy, you know, sitting there in his welfare house smoking pot on my paycheck, now he'll have a machine gun.
[02:49:35.479 --> 02:49:39.182]  And he can hardly talk, but he can sure beat the hell out of me.
[02:49:40.303 --> 02:49:42.984]  People are going to be begging to become taxpayers.
[02:49:43.044 --> 02:49:46.967]  They would love to pay tax because it would imply that they actually have a bona fide job.
[02:49:49.329 --> 02:49:50.949]  Well, it really does sound fun, Max.
[02:49:50.969 --> 02:49:53.010]  So how long until this completely unravels?
[02:49:54.550 --> 02:50:02.671]  Well, I think it... You know, the thing is... There's a great story by... It's called The Death of Ivan Ilyich.
[02:50:03.752 --> 02:50:06.032]  By a great Russian writer.
[02:50:06.872 --> 02:50:09.553]  And it's a story about a man who's dead.
[02:50:10.153 --> 02:50:16.714]  And he listens to the people come into the... Into the... Into the parlor... Into the... Into the funeral parlor talking about him.
[02:50:17.449 --> 02:50:20.770]  And you can still hear these people talking about him even though he's dead.
[02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:23.351]  Now, you can hear my voice, Alex.
[02:50:23.551 --> 02:50:24.271]  I know you can.
[02:50:24.591 --> 02:50:26.792]  But the fact is, America is dead.
[02:50:27.152 --> 02:50:29.233]  You think it's alive, but it's a corpse.
[02:50:29.753 --> 02:50:30.513]  It's nothing.
[02:50:30.653 --> 02:50:31.654]  There's lights are on.
[02:50:32.054 --> 02:50:32.794]  Nobody's home.
[02:50:32.994 --> 02:50:33.894]  There's no credit.
[02:50:34.175 --> 02:50:35.415]  There's no money.
[02:50:35.995 --> 02:50:37.816]  It's dead, dead, dead.
[02:50:37.976 --> 02:50:41.157]  The only people who don't understand that are the people who live in America.
[02:50:41.177 --> 02:50:44.798]  The 5% of the world's population that's become incredibly insignificant.
[02:50:44.838 --> 02:50:45.438]  Attention!
[02:50:45.458 --> 02:50:49.440]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:56.803]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed due to the financial crisis in America.
[02:51:12.810 --> 02:51:17.895]  The IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:51:18.096 --> 02:51:26.865]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:51:26.925 --> 02:51:27.605]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:51:31.209 --> 02:51:37.832]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:51:38.032 --> 02:51:46.856]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:51:46.996 --> 02:51:51.658]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:51:51.678 --> 02:51:51.718]  800-902-6969.
[02:51:51.738 --> 02:51:51.819]  800-902-6969.
[02:51:51.839 --> 02:51:51.999]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[02:51:59.801 --> 02:52:02.103]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:02.183 --> 02:52:04.425]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:04.505 --> 02:52:07.308]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.708 --> 02:52:12.472]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.832 --> 02:52:17.016]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:17.316 --> 02:52:19.659]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:19.679 --> 02:52:22.203]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.223 --> 02:52:25.126]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:25.487 --> 02:52:33.097]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:33.419 --> 02:52:38.661]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.801 --> 02:52:41.061]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:41.121 --> 02:52:45.082]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:45.342 --> 02:52:46.263]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:46.403 --> 02:52:47.703]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:47.743 --> 02:52:48.743]  Invisible Empire.

[02:52:59.246 --> 02:53:02.168]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:53:02.248 --> 02:53:04.209]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:53:04.329 --> 02:53:06.970]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:53:07.071 --> 02:53:09.032]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:53:09.292 --> 02:53:10.492]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:53:10.713 --> 02:53:12.314]  But first, the facts.
[02:53:12.614 --> 02:53:16.256]  67 other products merely treat symptoms and not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:53:16.536 --> 02:53:20.018]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:53:20.218 --> 02:53:27.622]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:53:27.963 --> 02:53:28.583]  Sinofresh.
[02:53:28.843 --> 02:53:31.704]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[02:53:46.908 --> 02:53:47.008]  888-906-3636.
[02:53:47.028 --> 02:53:48.548]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[02:53:48.568 --> 02:53:48.968]  Mention GCN.
[02:53:49.249 --> 02:53:49.909]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[02:53:50.149 --> 02:53:50.549]  It works!
[02:54:08.158 --> 02:54:10.701]  You know what concerns me about what Max Keiser is saying?
[02:54:10.721 --> 02:54:21.635]  It's like a Christmas carol with Charles Dickens where Scrooge can, you know, see himself dead, nobody coming to his funeral with the ghost of Christmas future.
[02:54:22.799 --> 02:54:33.409]  Or it's kind of like to use a Star Trek analogy, the wrath of Khan when Spock's been radiated fixing the ship and Kirk's trying to get in and they hold him back and they say, he says, we gotta save him!
[02:54:33.449 --> 02:54:35.931]  And he says, he's dead already.
[02:54:36.672 --> 02:54:40.515]  The elites for four years have been acting like this country's dead already.
[02:54:41.016 --> 02:54:46.141]  And you've got all these big investment groups dumping all of their Israeli holdings, all of them, including Harvard.
[02:54:46.761 --> 02:54:48.942]  You've got them headlong towards World War III.
[02:54:49.322 --> 02:54:50.342]  The banks are offshore.
[02:54:50.422 --> 02:54:51.103]  They don't care.
[02:54:51.123 --> 02:54:53.904]  And it's either us or these global bankers.
[02:54:54.624 --> 02:54:57.705]  And these creatures are announcing world government.
[02:54:58.545 --> 02:54:59.566]  It's all happening.
[02:55:00.346 --> 02:55:11.690]  And so I think what Kaiser is saying is we're already irrevocably screwed, unless we do what Ron Paul and others have said, and what we cover, what's covered in the film The Secret of Oz, and what we've covered here with the maker of that film.
[02:55:12.310 --> 02:55:14.531]  Unless we have a real awakening, we are dead.
[02:55:15.111 --> 02:55:19.794]  I mean, this country still has great wealth and energy if we say no to the parasite.
[02:55:20.154 --> 02:55:23.957]  But Max, it doesn't look like people are, you know, ready to accept that.
[02:55:23.977 --> 02:55:26.819]  They're starting to wake up, but, you know, I look at Europe.
[02:55:26.839 --> 02:55:30.201]  They've got big debt ratios and other big problems as well.
[02:55:30.761 --> 02:55:42.249]  Europe's, you know, not even replacing itself, a 1.3 replacement level, so you always feel a little snug over there in your redoubt, in your keep, but I don't think you're in good shape either there in Paris, buddy.
[02:55:43.169 --> 02:55:45.390]  The Federal Reserve Bank is not owned by the U.S.
[02:55:45.470 --> 02:55:48.291]  It's the only reserve bank in the world that's not owned by the country itself.
[02:55:48.331 --> 02:55:48.711]  No, I know.
[02:55:48.771 --> 02:55:49.371]  We're a joke.
[02:55:49.411 --> 02:55:50.031]  Let me talk.
[02:55:50.071 --> 02:55:50.631]  Let me talk.
[02:55:50.671 --> 02:55:53.092]  The bank went out from Angkor Wat in 2008.
[02:55:53.132 --> 02:55:53.832]  Where'd that money go?
[02:55:53.952 --> 02:55:54.652]  European banks.
[02:55:55.132 --> 02:56:01.614]  The European banks can always rely on the American taxpayer to bail them out through vis-a-vis AIG or Goldman Sachs because we own you.
[02:56:01.634 --> 02:56:02.334]  Okay?
[02:56:02.374 --> 02:56:04.335]  You guys are the weak hand at the poker table.
[02:56:04.495 --> 02:56:04.735]  You're the
[02:56:04.735 --> 02:56:05.836]  Let's jump at the poker table.
[02:56:06.116 --> 02:56:11.419]  Now whether you're talking Star Trek or Tolstoy, who wrote The Death of Ivan Ilyich, I'll give you one upside here.
[02:56:11.739 --> 02:56:20.464]  When the dollar collapses, as it inevitably will, the one thing that America has that'll be priced competitively on the word market is cotton.
[02:56:20.964 --> 02:56:22.285]  Cotton will be king again.
[02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:24.467]  So Alex, I got a song for you.
[02:56:24.487 --> 02:56:26.728]  I want all your listeners to listen to this song and learn this song.
[02:56:27.546 --> 02:56:29.868]  Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton.
[02:56:29.928 --> 02:56:31.909]  Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of two.
[02:56:32.350 --> 02:56:34.311]  I'm a slave now, picking all my cotton.
[02:56:34.611 --> 02:56:36.733]  I'm a slave now, working for the Wall Street.
[02:56:36.813 --> 02:56:37.013]  Jump!
[02:56:37.113 --> 02:56:37.954]  You get my point?
[02:56:38.194 --> 02:56:39.435]  You're all a bunch of slaves now!
[02:56:39.495 --> 02:56:41.656]  Hold my soul to the company store!
[02:56:42.357 --> 02:56:42.757]  That's right!
[02:56:42.797 --> 02:56:43.918]  Cotton will be competitive!
[02:56:44.078 --> 02:56:45.059]  You'll all be cotton farmers!
[02:56:45.079 --> 02:56:45.859]  You'll be picking cotton!
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:47.641]  Down there on the plantation!
[02:56:48.688 --> 02:56:50.450]  And that's where we're going to save America!
[02:56:50.570 --> 02:56:52.753]  We're going right back to pre-Civil War America!
[02:56:53.153 --> 02:56:55.095]  And that's a round trip to nowhere!
[02:56:55.315 --> 02:56:58.819]  And we'll have carpetbaggers running around with armed forces robbing us!
[02:57:01.701 --> 02:57:02.161]  That's me!
[02:57:02.261 --> 02:57:02.921]  I'm here in Europe!
[02:57:03.102 --> 02:57:06.083]  I can pick off you guys from Europe as easy as getting out of line!
[02:57:06.323 --> 02:57:08.424]  I'll buy Corrections Corp of America all day long!
[02:57:08.444 --> 02:57:13.005]  Stock's gonna double, because nobody's gonna stop going to prison to make Wall Street more money!
[02:57:13.566 --> 02:57:14.546]  I'll buy Verizon!
[02:57:14.726 --> 02:57:15.606]  I'll buy Google!
[02:57:15.886 --> 02:57:18.127]  Because no one there's gonna stop to help themselves!
[02:57:18.427 --> 02:57:19.048]  What's the point?
[02:57:19.428 --> 02:57:21.028]  It's like cat and shooting fish in a barrel!
[02:57:21.208 --> 02:57:22.829]  Nobody's gonna stop to help themselves!
[02:57:22.889 --> 02:57:25.530]  Max, you are not an immoral... You're not an immoral person.
[02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:27.551]  You're illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[02:57:27.771 --> 02:57:30.172]  You're not... You're not really gonna do that, are you?
[02:57:31.641 --> 02:57:38.871]  Well, Alex, if somebody is not going to, you know... People are waking up, Max!
[02:57:38.891 --> 02:57:42.295]  The pool has to be scrubbed of the stupid people.
[02:57:45.139 --> 02:57:46.200]  Well, I got news for you.
[02:57:46.220 --> 02:57:47.782]  The stupid people work for the government.
[02:57:47.802 --> 02:57:48.844]  They're coming for you, Max.
[02:57:51.617 --> 02:57:53.558]  Max, France is dead!
[02:57:53.578 --> 02:57:55.118]  France is dead!
[02:57:55.378 --> 02:57:57.739]  You're a dead man, you just don't know it yet.
[02:57:58.119 --> 02:58:04.861]  You can look across from your pile of crap and tell me that I'm knee-deep in a pig pie, but so are you, pal.
[02:58:05.241 --> 02:58:05.741]  Smell it.
[02:58:06.161 --> 02:58:07.142]  It ain't daisies.
[02:58:07.662 --> 02:58:09.402]  You're sitting in the same situation.
[02:58:09.442 --> 02:58:12.043]  This is a new world order, Max.
[02:58:14.012 --> 02:58:15.593]  You know, I was rallying, my friend.
[02:58:16.094 --> 02:58:16.934]  We're doing well.
[02:58:16.994 --> 02:58:18.055]  Hey, well, let me tell you this.
[02:58:18.695 --> 02:58:21.998]  As the center of the empire and having to fund this whorehouse, we are in worse shape.
[02:58:22.318 --> 02:58:23.979]  But we're all in this together, Max.
[02:58:24.619 --> 02:58:27.081]  And free humanity is going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:58:27.361 --> 02:58:29.022]  We don't have a choice, my friend.
[02:58:29.043 --> 02:58:30.784]  We can't let them demoralize us.
[02:58:31.084 --> 02:58:33.145]  We have just begun to fight, and we're going to crush them.
[02:58:33.405 --> 02:58:36.748]  Max Keiser, let me say bye to you at the end of the show, but Hamid Ghul coming up.
[02:58:36.788 --> 02:58:38.929]  Incredible information straight ahead at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:40.931 --> 02:58:42.612]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:46.548]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:49.155 --> 02:58:53.399]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:53.719 --> 02:58:54.339]  Number one.
[02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:57.782]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:58.063 --> 02:58:58.623]  Number two.
[02:58:58.923 --> 02:59:03.467]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:03.807 --> 02:59:04.248]  It's true.
[02:59:04.548 --> 02:59:09.112]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:09.432 --> 02:59:09.973]  Number three.
[02:59:10.253 --> 02:59:13.536]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:13.836 --> 02:59:17.539]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:17.739 --> 02:59:18.279]  Number 4.
[02:59:18.519 --> 02:59:20.880]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:21.280 --> 02:59:24.661]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:24.961 --> 02:59:25.181]  Number 5.
[02:59:25.761 --> 02:59:29.663]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:29.903 --> 02:59:34.644]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
