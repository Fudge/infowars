[00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.502]  Centered deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:08.092]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:11.105]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:17.727]  We're now an hour and eight minutes into the syndicated radio transmission on this Tuesday, the 16th day of February 2010.
[00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:22.849]  For the rest of the hour, Michael Badnarek is our guest.
[00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:27.030]  He, of course, was a Libertarian candidate for the Libertarians.
[00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.251]  He has given thousands of lectures around the country.
[00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:34.872]  He's an author, documentary filmmaker, former GCN radio host.
[00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:46.555]  And a few months ago, he had a really serious heart attack while at a rally in Wisconsin trying to stop the banning of raw milk being sold.
[00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:49.956]  I mean, they're not just trying to keep marijuana illegal, folks.
[00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:51.556]  They're trying to ban vitamins right now.
[00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:53.137]  Canada is openly moving to do it.
[00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:58.084]  So they're attacking all of our freedoms and he had a serious, serious heart attack.
[00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:06.596]  I heard he had a rough go of it but it was great to hear yesterday that he's doing a lot better now and so we're very honored to have him with us.
[00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:07.377]  I want to talk about
[00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:19.121]  What happened with Michael, but then also want to get into a whole host of other issues and how much ground the Liberty Movement, the awakening to tyranny, has gained.
[00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:33.151]  Climategate, government health care in deep trouble, the police state being exposed, the TSA, naked body scanners in deep trouble, open talk of them being removed, so many other positive things happening.
[00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:34.913]  Polls between 75 and 91 percent of people
[00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:37.554]  Thank you so much.
[00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:38.194]  Don't close the casket yet.
[00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:39.655]  I'm still alive.
[00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:05.833]  Well, you look great watching here on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:11.895]  Michael, talk about your ordeal and everybody's prayers and the donations and everything else.
[00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:20.078]  Well, I was invited to Wisconsin to speak at a rally in favor of raw milk.
[00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:23.959]  I've been drinking raw milk for about a year, year and a half.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.141]  It is so much better than the stuff you can buy in the store.
[00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.201]  It's also much healthier for you.
[00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:31.342]  And as you said in the intro,
[00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:37.720]  I mean, it's not just marijuana or just heroin or cocaine that the government is trying to make illegal.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.966]  They're trying to make milk illegal, something that humans have been drinking for literally centuries.
[00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:47.708]  And so I went and spoke.
[00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.750]  Now, most of it, I don't remember.
[00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.456]  The hospital gave me a combination of drugs that they lovingly refer to as milk of amnesia.
[00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:00.159]  So most of the bad part, I do not remember.
[00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:03.838]  The doctors and nurses were really surprised, however.
[00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:11.184]  I wasn't supposed to be able to lift a finger, and on several occasions I was sitting up in bed looking for my pants.
[00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:17.068]  I guess I was hoping to leave, and the doctors and nurses wanted to know what I was made out of.
[00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.052]  My friends, the people who know me well, were not surprised.
[00:03:21.992 --> 00:03:25.395]  They know how dedicated I am, especially when it comes to liberty.
[00:03:26.184 --> 00:03:31.167]  The good news is that I went to Gunderson Lutheran Hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin.
[00:03:31.747 --> 00:03:34.169]  I think it's the best hospital in the United States.
[00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:40.193]  They took fantastic care of me and literally brought me back from the brink of death.
[00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:41.613]  I want to thank them.
[00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:44.595]  And I'm back to 100%.
[00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:47.197]  My voice is good.
[00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:48.358]  My energy is good.
[00:03:49.198 --> 00:03:54.081]  And as long as I'm alive and able to breathe, you know that I'm going to be lighting the fires of liberty.
[00:03:54.694 --> 00:04:00.956]  And I want to thank you in particular for letting your listeners know what was going on.
[00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:08.159]  My mother was touched that you would do a little presentation to tell everybody about my status.
[00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.599]  So I want to thank you.
[00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.779]  I want to thank your listeners.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.221]  I am back to normal as far as I can tell.
[00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:24.064]  And the one good thing, for years I've been telling people that if I die, liberty is no longer my problem.
[00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:31.128]  And the lesson I hoped I was teaching was that everybody has to get involved on a personal basis.
[00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:32.989]  This is your Constitution.
[00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:35.789]  This is your Bill of Rights.
[00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:43.350]  And now that I've had this heart attack, people are understanding that and they are jumping on board.
[00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:51.632]  So I think that we're going to see an even greater increase in the number of people who are helping us in the Patriot Movement.
[00:04:52.247 --> 00:04:59.909]  Well, I don't want to dwell on it, but we are blessed to have you here with us, because talking to your family and others, they say it was a really bad heart attack.
[00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:04.610]  Specifically, if you don't mind telling us, people are wondering, what type of heart attack did you have, Michael?
[00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.971]  I had a 100% blockage.
[00:05:10.012 --> 00:05:13.953]  I had a heart attack about 11 years ago on the back side of my heart.
[00:05:14.474 --> 00:05:18.356]  Which affected the atriums, the top of the heart.
[00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:20.777]  Well, that's not as serious.
[00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:23.959]  This one was in front of the heart.
[00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.602]  It directly affected the ventricles, the part that actually pushed the blood through your body.
[00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:36.325]  And, well, in the ambulance and at the hospital, I was technically dead for about 10 minutes.
[00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:36.966]  Wow!
[00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:39.607]  And I was on life support.
[00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:44.134]  Uh, in a chemically induced coma for 16 days.
[00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:53.458]  So I, I genuinely appreciate everybody's prayers and concern, um, because it was a very serious thing.
[00:05:54.198 --> 00:06:07.764]  And, uh, I am, I'm just so grateful to still be here so that I can work with you and, and all the other patriots here in Texas and across the country, because we are, we are going to restore this Constitutional Republic.
[00:06:08.373 --> 00:06:09.614]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:15.416]  The only question is, you know, just how interesting and messy it's going to be between now and then.
[00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:18.698]  Well, no doubt the prayers certainly helped.
[00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:20.659]  I know a lot of people were praying for you, Michael.
[00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.700]  Well, my mother was thanking me personally.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:37.147]  She said, if nothing else, I brought a lot of people back to religion and faith because, well, I know at least two of my friends had started praying for me.
[00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:46.577]  They hadn't prayed in over a decade, and it was my condition that caused them to get back into prayer.
[00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:50.361]  So I want to genuinely thank everybody who was concerned about me.
[00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:57.288]  I know for a fact that that helped, and I think that my stubborn attitude had a little bit to do with it, too.
[00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:07.199]  Absolutely, but not among the living for 10 minutes, but definitely you're the same Michael Bagneri we knew, so it didn't hurt your brain too bad.
[00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.382]  A true blessing and a miracle that you're here with us today.
[00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:23.070]  I want to talk about a host of issues with you and then have you back soon with us as well to cover more of the Constitution itself, that you really are an amazing
[00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:24.932]  We're good to go.
[00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:48.187]  Deborah Medina was gaining five points a week.
[00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:52.130]  We'll soon get polls later in the week to see if this staged Glenn Beck event.
[00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.331]  We've now talked to Medina's people.
[00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:58.054]  She's coming on later Sunday or Monday, one of those days.
[00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:03.518]  It's clear that Beck was cutting her audio off so she couldn't understand even what she was saying.
[00:08:03.878 --> 00:08:05.860]  She never really talked about 9-11 Truth.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.782]  She said people have a right to their own opinions, just like six of the ten commission members.
[00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:16.750]  Have said it's a cover-up, and Farmer, the head lawyer on it, has written a book saying it was a criminal conspiracy and cover-up.
[00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:27.352]  But Glenn Beck, the reason I talk a lot about him more and more is they've positioned him as the leader of the Patriot movement when he calls for a value-added tax, a sales tax to pay the bankers.
[00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:30.192]  He calls for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.
[00:08:30.232 --> 00:08:32.253]  He called for the banker bailout takeover bill.
[00:08:32.673 --> 00:08:39.414]  He attacks Ron Paul constantly, but then two-facedly has him on and supports him, but kind of giggles at him with disdain.
[00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:43.996]  He's now savaged Debra Medina and the media is saying she's going to lose because of this.
[00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:46.778]  I think they're just telling people she's a loser so they won't vote for her.
[00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:50.120]  I think she clearly will get into the runoff and her numbers are still growing.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.941]  A lot of this backfired.
[00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:54.863]  The donations have more than doubled since this happened.
[00:08:55.843 --> 00:09:07.313]  Specifically, how important this Deborah Medina race is, because you have a real patriot running, not just some rhino, Republican in name only, like we saw in Massachusetts taking the Kennedy seat.
[00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:13.519]  This was a bellwether event, and we see him always at key moments, showing he's a Benedict Arnold.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.124]  Well, I've been saying that Glenn Beck was controlled opposition for a long time.
[00:09:21.568 --> 00:09:34.594]  For a long time he was saying the right things, but I said, be careful, because he's going to turn around, and as many people have finally recognized, the interview with Debra Medina showed his true colors.
[00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:46.220]  The good news, and I'm always looking for the silver lining, this is, if they're attacking and savaging Debra Medina, you know that we are doing the right thing.
[00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:49.530]  Deborah has so much support here in Texas.
[00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.371]  She is gaining in the popularity polls.
[00:09:53.412 --> 00:09:54.832]  People all over Texas.
[00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:59.975]  I have dozens of friends who are actively working on her campaign.
[00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:02.896]  And we have an opportunity.
[00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:13.300]  We have a real opportunity here in Texas to show people the way, the path to liberty, by electing someone other than the Democrats or Republicans.
[00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:22.215]  As you were talking earlier, this drive for liberty and freedom is increasing, and it's going to happen.
[00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:25.157]  I'm hoping that it happens in this election.
[00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:42.068]  I really hope that we elect Deborah as our governor, because Oklahoma is trying to elect a liberty-minded candidate, and that will be the first dominoes that will fall as we restore this public.
[00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:43.589]  It's very, very important.
[00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:44.910]  Well, let me expand on that.
[00:10:45.987 --> 00:10:50.429]  They tried to keep her out of the debates, but people protested and got the word out, so she got in the debate.
[00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.669]  She clearly won both of them.
[00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:57.912]  And they saw that she was going to win, gaining four to five points a week.
[00:10:57.952 --> 00:10:58.672]  She was going to end up
[00:10:59.818 --> 00:11:01.540]  As of this week, overtaking Hutchinson.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.761]  Next week, overtaking Perry.
[00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:04.763]  End of the main election early next month.
[00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:07.945]  Early voting begins on Friday.
[00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:21.198]  So, all of this is going on, so they know it's a danger to come out and attack her because that elevates her, but they did it from somebody we supposedly would trust, Glenn Beck, a Benedict Arnold in our army.
[00:11:21.938 --> 00:11:29.520]  And so again, that shows how viable she is, that they did this whole, rumors of her demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:37.461]  And that's why I'm spending so much time on this, is because Beck has been positioned to engage in key sabotage at every juncture.
[00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.062]  Ron Paul surging, he says he may be a terrorist who wants to bomb buildings.
[00:11:41.442 --> 00:11:43.442]  We need to use the army against Ron Paul supporters, 2007.
[00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:47.603]  Medina surging, about to lead the States Rights Rebellion.
[00:11:48.223 --> 00:11:51.064]  In comes in the enemy Thai fighters blasting at her X-Wing.
[00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:53.106]  Stay there, Michael Bagneri.
[00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:56.370]  We'll continue to talk about the Great Awakening that's happening and a lot more.
[00:11:57.458 --> 00:12:01.742]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.064]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:13:05.104 --> 00:13:09.490]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.932]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:31.273]  All right, going back to Michael Badnarek, our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:34.855]  Michael, fire out your website for folks that just joined us.
[00:16:35.955 --> 00:16:48.481]  My website is constitutionpreservation.org, and I want you to know that it just went live with a new design a half an hour ago, just when I knew I was going to be on your program.
[00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:51.663]  I went ahead and went live with the new design.
[00:16:52.113 --> 00:16:56.498]  Should be prettier, easier to navigate, and I'm very excited about it.
[00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:59.681]  So it's constitutionpreservation.org.
[00:17:00.973 --> 00:17:07.838]  Well, again, good to have you here, and of course the books and films and things you've made are all available there on the site as well.
[00:17:07.878 --> 00:17:09.619]  You know, so much to talk about, Michael.
[00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:23.588]  I want to get into ClimateGate, go over the swine flu fraud falling apart, the banks robbing everybody, that's now revealing the structure, why the globalists are now admitting world government after decades of denying it.
[00:17:23.908 --> 00:17:27.151]  But before we go there, what does Michael Bagnerik want to talk about?
[00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:28.852]  What's most important on your mind right now?
[00:17:30.871 --> 00:17:42.621]  Well, I am really, I'm probably lucky that I was in a coma when the ATF shut down the gun show in Austin, because I probably would have had an adverse reaction to that.
[00:17:43.522 --> 00:17:59.575]  I want to make sure that we get that gun show back up and running someplace, and I want everybody to know that 23,000 gun laws in the United States are unconstitutional, because they directly infringe on your right to protect yourself, your family, your property.
[00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:13.155]  And the ATF is a federal agency that spends 900 million dollars, almost a billion dollars a year, trying to put gun dealers and gun owners out of business.
[00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:17.416]  So, I can't let that happen in my backyard.
[00:18:17.936 --> 00:18:19.836]  So, that's my big issue.
[00:18:19.856 --> 00:18:21.657]  I'm not sure exactly what we can do about it.
[00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:26.578]  I know that people in Austin have already had a huge rally to protest that.
[00:18:27.078 --> 00:18:28.659]  That's my personal hot button.
[00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:30.594]  Well, absolutely.
[00:18:30.814 --> 00:18:32.575]  And I have been studying this.
[00:18:32.595 --> 00:18:36.798]  You know, we broke the story about the gun show, had Mr. Bedecker on about what happened.
[00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:39.780]  They did get a new location at the Target Center.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.823]  He's on in the last 30 minutes today to talk about that.
[00:18:43.283 --> 00:18:46.926]  But it then came out that the feds did come in, did basically order it.
[00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:50.648]  The police tried to lie, later admitted it, and we pointed out they had no law.
[00:18:50.668 --> 00:18:53.951]  And they said, oh, well, we used a crack house nuisance abatement.
[00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:56.971]  Uh, to shut it, uh, down.
[00:18:57.732 --> 00:19:03.993]  And then we've also found out that clearly, and I didn't believe this at first, I had to see it, and I may cover it coming up in the next few days.
[00:19:04.453 --> 00:19:13.655]  Clearly, people working for the police and the ADL are involved, even in the Austin pro-gun movement, trying to destabilize it and things, and even go after me.
[00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:19.336]  And it blew me, they even write articles how great the ADL is, and they write about me being bad, and, you know, staging these different events.
[00:19:19.376 --> 00:19:21.096]  I mean, it's getting really crazy.
[00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:28.798]  Which shows Austin is a test ground example of what they want to do nationwide.
[00:19:28.818 --> 00:19:37.541]  And Obama announced, as you know, earlier in the week, they said, look, signing statements, executive orders, we're going to implement the carbon taxes regardless around Congress.
[00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.562]  We're going to implement government health care even if Congress doesn't pass it.
[00:19:40.802 --> 00:19:43.503]  We're going to implement amnesty even if the Congress doesn't pass it.
[00:19:43.823 --> 00:19:45.264]  I mean, Michael, this is
[00:19:46.104 --> 00:19:46.545]  Tyranny!
[00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:47.768]  It's just getting worse and worse!
[00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.459]  Oh, it is treason to an exponential degree, and...
[00:19:53.374 --> 00:19:53.794]  It is.
[00:19:53.874 --> 00:20:00.436]  It's because of this blatant tyranny that our fellow citizens are finally starting to wake up.
[00:20:01.236 --> 00:20:05.557]  I remember back in 1997, I met you for the first time.
[00:20:05.597 --> 00:20:09.138]  We were participating in a rally at the state capitol.
[00:20:09.478 --> 00:20:16.079]  I don't even remember what our issue was, but you and I were trying to wake people up over ten years ago.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.820]  And now, finally,
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:30.999]  The government is being so preposterous that the people who didn't believe us, the people who thought that you and I were radical and extremist, now they're starting to realize that we were telling them the truth and they are now...
[00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:42.292]  Well, here's another example.
[00:20:42.672 --> 00:21:01.937]  The National Paws of Toronto Star last week reported in their headlines that pharmacies, drugstores, health food stores get notices, stop selling all vitamins, minerals and nutrients, including vitamin C, maloluca oil, things like fish oil,
[00:21:03.798 --> 00:21:09.982]  They listed things like, oh, what's the plant they use for burns?
[00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:10.683]  Aloe vera.
[00:21:10.963 --> 00:21:11.824]  Aloe vera, yes.
[00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:18.529]  And they said, under UN treaty with Codex Alimentarius, that was a huge wake-up call.
[00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:19.830]  I mean, this is really going on.
[00:21:20.511 --> 00:21:21.291]  It really is.
[00:21:21.772 --> 00:21:26.075]  And like I said, you and I have been telling the people, and they just didn't believe us.
[00:21:26.095 --> 00:21:27.676]  They were in denial.
[00:21:28.337 --> 00:21:30.699]  Our government would never do anything like that.
[00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:32.931]  The United States is the good guys.
[00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:40.578]  You know, Congress would never... Well, wake up, ladies and gentlemen, because they will, they are, and it is up to us.
[00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:43.020]  Freedom is our responsibility.
[00:21:44.181 --> 00:21:46.263]  Long segment coming up with Michael Bagneri.
[00:21:47.104 --> 00:21:48.065]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:50.126]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.047 --> 00:21:53.730]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:56.343 --> 00:22:00.344]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:03.185]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:22:03.325 --> 00:22:05.266]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:22:05.406 --> 00:22:07.527]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:22:07.647 --> 00:22:09.167]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:13.609]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:46.066]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:22:56.141 --> 00:23:00.364]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:00.684 --> 00:23:01.284]  Number 1.
[00:23:01.604 --> 00:23:04.766]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:05.027 --> 00:23:05.587]  Number 2.
[00:23:05.887 --> 00:23:10.430]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.231]  It's true.
[00:23:11.511 --> 00:23:16.094]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:16.934]  Number 3.
[00:23:17.214 --> 00:23:20.496]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:20.797 --> 00:23:24.499]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:24.699 --> 00:23:25.240]  Number 4.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.862]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:28.262 --> 00:23:31.645]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:32.146]  Number 5.
[00:23:32.726 --> 00:23:36.649]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.634]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:45.958]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:46.098 --> 00:23:47.660]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:23:50.142 --> 00:23:52.485]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:23:56.598 --> 00:23:59.201]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:23:59.621 --> 00:24:04.586]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:24:04.946 --> 00:24:06.688]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:11.813]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:24:11.993 --> 00:24:12.914]  How much do you want?
[00:24:13.174 --> 00:24:13.915]  When do you want it?
[00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:15.896]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:16.997]  When will you need it?
[00:24:17.257 --> 00:24:19.318]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.559]  Will there be any food?
[00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:22.120]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.384]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:24:27.584 --> 00:24:30.786]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:34.649]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:35.970]  How much will you need?
[00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:36.810]  We don't know.
[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.011]  How much do you want?
[00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:38.951]  All you can get.
[00:24:39.151 --> 00:24:39.992]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:40.232 --> 00:24:42.993]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:24:43.294 --> 00:24:45.055]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:45.075 --> 00:24:45.975]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:03.678 --> 00:25:16.781]  I want to walk through a Newsweek hit piece against myself and others with Michael Bagnerik to illustrate the fact that the establishment is shooting blanks.
[00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:21.982]  They still think this is 30 years ago where they control reality.
[00:25:22.102 --> 00:25:26.363]  Like Karl Rove said to a group of reporters.
[00:25:27.063 --> 00:25:28.283]  We're going back to Michael in a moment.
[00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:39.092]  In fact, I'll tell you that story here in just a moment, but before we do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[00:25:39.632 --> 00:25:46.454]  One of them is the unbelievably fantastic, that I use in my office and home, Acola Blue 28 and the Acola Blue 30.
[00:25:46.834 --> 00:25:47.955]  Those are the smaller units.
[00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:50.355]  One puts it through 7 filters, the other through 12.
[00:25:50.395 --> 00:25:52.116]  I have the 7 filter units.
[00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:59.984]  Reverse osmosis, carbon, UV filter, and it grabs the water out of the air.
[00:26:00.165 --> 00:26:02.387]  You cannot get cleaner, better water.
[00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:03.388]  acolablue.com
[00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:06.850]  It's a moisture evaporator.
[00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.612]  It just grabs it right out of the air and then purifies it.
[00:26:09.632 --> 00:26:12.874]  And it's got a little high-tech computer system, hot and cold water, you name it.
[00:26:12.894 --> 00:26:17.017]  Just check it out at E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[00:26:17.337 --> 00:26:22.881]  AcolaBlue.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[00:26:22.901 --> 00:26:23.161]  800-691-6043.
[00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:27.684]  Or keep drinking the government water, or I guess trust the bottled water that's had so many problems.
[00:26:28.905 --> 00:26:30.226]  Plus, it's the cheapest form of water.
[00:26:31.813 --> 00:26:35.283]  They've got all the statistics on how inexpensive this is with the unit.
[00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:37.890]  Also, I want to tell you about my solar backup.
[00:26:40.984 --> 00:26:44.785]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:51.647]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:26:51.687 --> 00:26:52.167]  Here's why.
[00:26:52.608 --> 00:26:55.628]  Plug-and-play solar generators are now available from Solutions from Science.
[00:26:55.648 --> 00:26:57.149]  They've been available for about two years.
[00:26:57.189 --> 00:26:57.849]  Our listeners love them.
[00:26:58.269 --> 00:27:03.231]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever or whenever you need it.
[00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:04.371]  We're good to go.
[00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:22.363]  Painful power outages again.
[00:27:23.003 --> 00:27:26.584]  So go to solarbackup.com to request a free information package today.
[00:27:26.944 --> 00:27:32.286]  That's mysolarbackup.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:27:32.646 --> 00:27:37.928]  That's 877-327-0365, mysolarbackup.com, and of course, acolablue.com.
[00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:40.369]  Okay, going back to Michael Bagneri.
[00:27:40.749 --> 00:27:43.250]  Michael, I mean, you were dead for ten minutes.
[00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.131]  You were in a coma for two weeks.
[00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:53.437]  I mean, it's just so good to have you here, because we all just expect our friends and our colleagues, people we admire, to be here forever.
[00:27:53.777 --> 00:27:54.658]  But I agree with you.
[00:27:54.758 --> 00:27:56.680]  I realize how transitory life is.
[00:27:57.161 --> 00:27:59.543]  There's been a few times in my life I've almost been killed.
[00:28:00.464 --> 00:28:04.988]  And in a way, it makes me be less fearful about death, to just know it's coming.
[00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:08.810]  And obviously you're going to be here for a long time.
[00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:16.232]  I hope at some level you take it easy sometimes, but I know in a way you probably you'll be a hundred if you just keep fighting.
[00:28:16.932 --> 00:28:18.753]  But I guess that's kind of a catch 22.
[00:28:19.213 --> 00:28:21.473]  But it's just so good to have you here with us, my friend.
[00:28:22.314 --> 00:28:26.035]  Well, it is good to be here as a skydiving instructor.
[00:28:26.115 --> 00:28:28.155]  I know that life is transitory.
[00:28:28.215 --> 00:28:31.996]  We we have to take advantage of every moment that we are here.
[00:28:32.717 --> 00:28:34.317]  And I highly recommend
[00:28:34.932 --> 00:28:40.237]  That you talk to your family, your friends, and tell them how much you love them.
[00:28:40.337 --> 00:28:44.962]  Tell them how important they are in your life because you don't know.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.702]  When either they will, you know, disappear, or when you will.
[00:28:50.402 --> 00:28:52.724]  And the same is true for fighting for liberty.
[00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.444]  Don't postpone it.
[00:28:54.925 --> 00:29:01.068]  Don't do it next week, or I'll go and get a power generator next month, or when it's more convenient.
[00:29:01.648 --> 00:29:02.608]  Do it now.
[00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.989]  We've got to get on board.
[00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:05.870]  Yeah, I'll go to a gun rally next year.
[00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:10.813]  I'll go to city council and tell them, don't bring in UN-run carbon taxes.
[00:29:10.873 --> 00:29:13.414]  No, you've got to do it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:14.324 --> 00:29:14.925]  Absolutely.
[00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:23.072]  Now, while you're still alive, while you still have the energy, and it was my love of liberty that brought me back.
[00:29:23.132 --> 00:29:29.838]  It was a little bit like I've been practicing football, and now, right before the Super Bowl, I'm going to, you know, cash in my chips.
[00:29:30.218 --> 00:29:31.159]  There's no way.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.703]  Alex, I love you, but I'm not going to let you fight for liberty all by yourself.
[00:29:35.783 --> 00:29:39.587]  I just had to be here and help you out.
[00:29:40.438 --> 00:29:45.781]  Well, you're a classy guy, my friend, and you get better like fine wine as the years go.
[00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:51.865]  I mean, the great presentations, the constitutional classes you give, are you going to be giving any of those in the future?
[00:29:52.745 --> 00:29:53.426]  Absolutely.
[00:29:53.566 --> 00:29:56.808]  I'm kind of keeping it close to home as I recover.
[00:29:57.228 --> 00:30:01.851]  I'll be teaching a class in Farmers Branch here in Dallas on March 6th.
[00:30:02.271 --> 00:30:08.775]  I'm coming to Austin on March 13th, and I'll be in Fort Worth on March 20th.
[00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:17.698]  So, anywhere here in Texas, you can go to my website, constitutionpreservation.org, to find out more information.
[00:30:18.118 --> 00:30:19.199]  My phone number's there.
[00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:20.660]  You know, just give me a call.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:28.725]  I'd love to have, you know... Well, Michael, I'm not going to tell you to take it easy, because I've read the statistics where a lot of people have a heart attack, they take it easy, and then they...
[00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:30.206]  It's about a month now.
[00:30:30.226 --> 00:30:31.286]  It was early January.
[00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:55.598]  And I was in the hospital for an additional two weeks.
[00:30:56.418 --> 00:31:02.403]  When I finally opened my eyes, my best friend was there and he said, do you know who you are?
[00:31:03.424 --> 00:31:05.546]  And I thought, well, that's pretty condescending.
[00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:07.507]  Of course I know who I am.
[00:31:08.088 --> 00:31:09.889]  And he says, do you know what day it is?
[00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.352]  And I was supposed to give a speech on December 21st.
[00:31:13.933 --> 00:31:17.376]  And so I'm thinking, well, I don't know, maybe December 22nd.
[00:31:17.816 --> 00:31:19.717]  And he says, it is January 6th.
[00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:21.499]  I said, 2010?
[00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:22.699]  Yeah!
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.981]  And so it was a little bit like discovering that you're adopted after you're 50 years old.
[00:31:30.361 --> 00:31:31.581]  I mean, it was just a shock.
[00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:35.962]  I mean, I had to sit there and evaluate that and go, wow.
[00:31:36.422 --> 00:31:37.682]  I said, I missed Christmas.
[00:31:38.302 --> 00:31:40.163]  He said, yeah, you missed New Year's, too.
[00:31:41.103 --> 00:31:46.664]  So it was very serious and I am, again, thankful to everybody who showed their concern.
[00:31:47.104 --> 00:31:47.744]  I've still got
[00:31:48.737 --> 00:31:55.259]  Get well cards that I really haven't had time to open, but the most important thing is that I am back.
[00:31:55.519 --> 00:32:00.920]  I am back with a vengeance, and I'm getting back on the Liberty Trail as of March 6th.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.561]  Well, that's certainly fantastic, Michael, but at the same time, I was told that these heart problems run in the family.
[00:32:08.742 --> 00:32:09.202]  They do.
[00:32:09.602 --> 00:32:13.063]  Both of my grandfathers died early of heart attacks.
[00:32:13.523 --> 00:32:15.783]  Mom has had a quadruple bypass.
[00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:17.684]  My youngest brother has had a
[00:32:18.902 --> 00:32:28.047]  I've been a pacemaker for 20 years, and so the only solution really would be for me to select different parents at this late date.
[00:32:28.687 --> 00:32:31.048]  I don't think that's possible.
[00:32:31.728 --> 00:32:37.772]  One of the reasons that I've recovered so quickly is because I was taking such good care of myself beforehand.
[00:32:38.152 --> 00:32:43.755]  Taking the fish oil, taking the vitamin C, avoiding red meat.
[00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:48.557]  I'd have a good steak every once in a while, but eating fish and chicken and salad
[00:32:49.262 --> 00:32:49.823]  Absolutely.
[00:32:49.863 --> 00:32:50.843]  So much is genetics.
[00:32:51.364 --> 00:32:57.569]  Now, I want to go over an article here because I said I would do this yesterday and I didn't really do it.
[00:33:11.385 --> 00:33:19.299]  It's as if the heavens have opened up and dropped lightning bolts on us, but the lightning bolts bounce off at every level.
[00:33:20.202 --> 00:33:29.631]  Dirty tricks, COINTELPRO, national media, local media attacking me specifically, but also others who are standing up for liberty because they're scared now.
[00:33:29.971 --> 00:33:36.397]  They tried to ignore us before, but two different Newsweek articles attacking me and others in just the last week.
[00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:39.360]  There's a big quasi-hit piece coming out this week.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.423]  It's a featured story.
[00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:47.468]  Texas Monthly, so I'm wondering what that's going to be like.
[00:33:47.528 --> 00:33:51.191]  But the issue is we're drawing their fire, that means we're having an effect.
[00:33:51.472 --> 00:33:53.153]  And maybe it's not going to be a hit piece, I haven't read it yet.
[00:33:53.193 --> 00:34:01.161]  But the point is, Paul Watson wrote a counter-article to this yesterday, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:34:01.502 --> 00:34:02.042]  Newsweek!
[00:34:02.983 --> 00:34:04.685]  Powerful people do bad things.
[00:34:04.765 --> 00:34:05.866]  Too silly to discuss.
[00:34:06.206 --> 00:34:07.207]  That's an actual quote.
[00:34:10.527 --> 00:34:15.174]  The article's titled, that's our counter-article titled, Know Your Conspiracy Theories.
[00:34:15.194 --> 00:34:20.581]  And I want to show people a document Cam shot, and I'm going to go over these and just get you to respond.
[00:34:20.681 --> 00:34:23.605]  And they mix in a few silly ones to try to give way to this.
[00:34:25.738 --> 00:34:29.760]  Number two, they say, man-made global warming is a hoax.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.481]  Anthropogenic global warming is a hoax.
[00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:38.604]  And they go on to say, there is no story, there is no climate gate, it doesn't exist, it's completely insane.
[00:34:39.605 --> 00:34:42.766]  Even as, look at this document cam shot, folks.
[00:34:42.786 --> 00:34:43.967]  If you're a radio listener, go pull it up.
[00:34:44.347 --> 00:34:47.589]  You turn a scientist at center of row, or argument,
[00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.991]  He admits there has been no global warming since 95.
[00:34:51.331 --> 00:34:55.853]  Globally, with the UN, with over 100 universities, they concertedly fudge the numbers.
[00:34:55.873 --> 00:34:56.554]  They've now been caught.
[00:34:56.934 --> 00:34:59.815]  He now admits it, because he knows he's facing criminal prosecution.
[00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:00.816]  Here's another one.
[00:35:00.996 --> 00:35:02.737]  The continuing climate meltdown.
[00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:04.058]  Here's another one.
[00:35:05.578 --> 00:35:08.660]  Science blogger finds errors in Met Office climate change records.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.221]  Every facility lying.
[00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:11.762]  Warming meltdown.
[00:35:13.374 --> 00:35:13.815]  I don't know.
[00:35:24.366 --> 00:35:25.747]  That the sun doesn't come up in the morning.
[00:35:26.247 --> 00:35:33.232]  They just say it doesn't exist, and that our claim that a global government is being established through this doesn't exist.
[00:35:33.552 --> 00:35:35.893]  That's what the UN said at Copenhagen!
[00:35:36.374 --> 00:35:47.041]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are to say, know your conspiracies, guide to today's trendiest, hippest, and least likely fringe beliefs, and it's full of just mainline stuff.
[00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:53.665]  I mean, don't they know this is political suicide, or are they just speaking to their tiny audience they've got left?
[00:35:54.025 --> 00:36:00.508]  I think it's an effort to spin people around five or six times and get them dizzy so they don't know what to think.
[00:36:00.528 --> 00:36:01.909]  You know, the best lies are significantly true.
[00:36:20.925 --> 00:36:35.138]  What happens in people's thought process, if I meet you for the first time, Alex, and you tell me ten things that I know are true, eventually I go, this Alex Jones guy is a really good guy, and I stop analyzing.
[00:36:35.879 --> 00:36:39.702]  I mean, most people will just say, okay, Alex is a good guy.
[00:36:39.843 --> 00:36:43.406]  From now on, whatever Alex says, I assume to be true.
[00:36:43.786 --> 00:36:45.608]  That's what they did with Glenn Beck.
[00:36:46.403 --> 00:36:53.391]  Glenn Beck got on the radio and the television and for a long time he sounded like he was on our side.
[00:36:53.832 --> 00:36:58.237]  And what they were doing is they wanted Glenn Beck to establish credibility.
[00:36:58.778 --> 00:37:05.366]  So now that everybody's on the Glenn Beck bandwagon, that's when he has established our trust
[00:37:05.836 --> 00:37:12.740]  And that's when he can turn around and savage Debra Medina and make it sound like she has no chance.
[00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:18.324]  So what we need to do as people is to question everything.
[00:37:18.844 --> 00:37:19.245]  Think!
[00:37:19.785 --> 00:37:22.627]  Your parents taught you the difference between right and wrong.
[00:37:23.227 --> 00:37:27.371]  Well, that's why I tell people to always check out all the COINTELPRO lies about me.
[00:37:27.672 --> 00:37:29.173]  We are not owned by ABC.
[00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.195]  We have nothing to do with ABC.
[00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:34.278]  Years ago, we leased a radio feed, which anybody in radio does.
[00:37:34.538 --> 00:37:35.439]  We now have another one.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.981]  I am not owned by Saudi Arabians.
[00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:39.383]  I am not owned by the Brothmans.
[00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:40.564]  I've never met a Brothman.
[00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:41.805]  No connection to Brothmans.
[00:37:42.165 --> 00:37:43.526]  But the establishment
[00:37:44.247 --> 00:37:44.507]  I don't
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:15.625]  They have people's credibility and they make up stories about, you know, Cheney's been arrested or Alex Jones is a reptoid or they mix Bigfoot in and they know what they're doing.
[00:38:16.986 --> 00:38:17.566]  Absolutely.
[00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:19.948]  And it's just, you know, supports what I said.
[00:38:20.448 --> 00:38:22.649]  People will be critical.
[00:38:22.669 --> 00:38:25.410]  They'll be suspicious up to a certain point.
[00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.351]  And then they drop their defenses.
[00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:33.174]  And after that, you know, they just pretty much assume that that people are credible.
[00:38:34.297 --> 00:38:38.285]  I mean, if you're going to be a traitor, you've got to infiltrate.
[00:38:38.325 --> 00:38:40.249]  You've got to look like your friend.
[00:38:42.364 --> 00:38:46.447]  And then once you get inside the defenses, then you can destroy it.
[00:38:46.987 --> 00:38:51.871]  So, we need to have people continue to do critical thinking.
[00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.332]  Figure it out for yourself.
[00:38:54.953 --> 00:39:08.422]  Yeah, but how dumb, I mean, but with Newsweek, it's so ridiculous, like they have another article, and they say Alex Jones is the prophet of the Tea Parties, and he makes up this wild story that they want a global government with the carbon taxes.
[00:39:09.002 --> 00:39:14.524]  I mean, it's all on record in the treaty with all the world leaders saying it.
[00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:21.045]  What is the psychological tactic to admit they're doing it, but then say it's insane, it doesn't exist?
[00:39:23.426 --> 00:39:24.526]  I really don't know.
[00:39:24.586 --> 00:39:34.089]  The people who are trying to take over the world, they have such weird philosophies that, I mean, trying to figure out how they think or what they think,
[00:39:34.995 --> 00:39:36.917]  It hurts.
[00:39:37.017 --> 00:39:38.679]  My brain doesn't work like that.
[00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:40.822]  I agree with you.
[00:39:41.202 --> 00:39:44.125]  You and I believe in individual rights and private property.
[00:39:45.347 --> 00:39:54.877]  It boggles our minds to assume that someone would try to commit murder or try to steal your property.
[00:39:55.299 --> 00:39:58.200]  Or try to control the world.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.200]  And I think that's it.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.960]  That's what the globalists count on.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.081]  Here's number three from the article.
[00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:14.043]  Goldman Sachs intentionally created the economic crises, and then they give credit to Matt Tebe, who reported on it years after we did at Rolling Stone, and then just basically says none of it's true.
[00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:21.365]  When we have a five-part series with the internal emails of Goldman Sachs from major publications,
[00:40:22.409 --> 00:40:23.549]  What was the five-part series?
[00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:24.630]  I'm having one of those moments.
[00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.751]  It was... What was the five-part series?
[00:40:29.932 --> 00:40:30.952]  Yeah, McClatchy News Service.
[00:40:30.972 --> 00:40:31.972]  I had one of those moments there.
[00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:37.674]  Confirming it was premeditated, and now it's come out they engineered Iceland and Greece.
[00:40:37.734 --> 00:40:39.295]  That's in Reuters today!
[00:40:39.815 --> 00:40:44.777]  So, of course the banks engineered this, and here's Newsweek saying Goldman Sachs had nothing to do with this.
[00:40:46.897 --> 00:40:48.478]  Well, it's a last-ditch effort.
[00:40:48.886 --> 00:40:49.467]  on their part.
[00:41:10.911 --> 00:41:12.854]  You know, your listeners know the truth.
[00:41:13.255 --> 00:41:16.480]  The people who take my class cannot be confused.
[00:41:16.881 --> 00:41:24.713]  It's just a couple of those people who are still in doubt will read this article and go, well, I'm just not going to worry about it.
[00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:29.900]  And they just won't try to figure things out.
[00:41:47.393 --> 00:42:00.099]  It does create a government bureaucracy, and Tom Daschle's own book said it, where they will restrict health care to people that are above 60, and in Europe they've done this, and it is a bioethicist death panel.
[00:42:00.159 --> 00:42:06.281]  Newsweek's own publication had the case for killing granny saying, go ahead and kill grandma.
[00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:12.524]  So, I mean, again, it's like the schizophrenia where they say, we want to kill your grandma, but we're not saying that, it doesn't exist.
[00:42:14.127 --> 00:42:20.334]  Well, at some point I think that they are so delusional that they start to believe their own hype.
[00:42:21.035 --> 00:42:23.418]  I mean, they are coming apart at the seams.
[00:42:23.858 --> 00:42:29.244]  The only thing we have that is necessary for us is just to not give up.
[00:42:29.805 --> 00:42:31.367]  Liberty will be restored.
[00:42:31.847 --> 00:42:34.851]  We are moving forward and, you know,
[00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:40.425]  The only way that we can lose is if we decide, if we start to doubt ourselves.
[00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:41.986]  And we've gained a lot of ground.
[00:42:42.046 --> 00:42:44.829]  I got Webster Tarpley coming up at the 8 after next hour.
[00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.752]  Michael, let me twist your arm to stay an extra five minutes.
[00:42:47.772 --> 00:42:49.394]  This next segment, one more, okay?
[00:42:49.995 --> 00:42:50.755]  Okay, I will do.
[00:42:51.256 --> 00:42:51.877]  Fantastic.
[00:42:51.897 --> 00:42:55.621]  We'll be right back because I want to go over a few more of these and then I've got some other questions.
[00:42:57.182 --> 00:42:59.122]  Is your computer running slowly?
[00:42:59.362 --> 00:43:00.803]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[00:43:01.123 --> 00:43:02.183]  Don't waste your money!
[00:43:02.323 --> 00:43:08.464]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[00:43:08.644 --> 00:43:10.065]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[00:43:56.522 --> 00:43:57.782]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:57.822 --> 00:44:03.164]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:44:03.404 --> 00:44:08.045]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:44:08.425 --> 00:44:13.487]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:44:14.007 --> 00:44:18.688]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:19.449]  I think so.
[00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:47.838]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:52.866]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:44:53.187 --> 00:44:55.571]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:56.505 --> 00:45:03.347]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:45:03.487 --> 00:45:05.427]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:07.708]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:09.328]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:45:09.469 --> 00:45:13.790]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.310]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:45:22.512 --> 00:45:27.253]  Their bestseller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:45:27.313 --> 00:45:30.053]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:45:30.133 --> 00:45:32.754]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:45:32.854 --> 00:45:40.035]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:45:40.315 --> 00:45:44.036]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:45:44.056 --> 00:45:44.256]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:45:49.737 --> 00:46:00.780]  Take a look out your window, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.640]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
[00:46:07.781 --> 00:46:10.602]  Man, he's playing Dixie.
[00:46:10.842 --> 00:46:15.083]  Man, got his hand outstretched.
[00:46:15.163 --> 00:46:18.044]  Could be the purest.
[00:46:22.464 --> 00:46:26.547]  Take how the globalists for one audience tell the truth and for another audience lie.
[00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:30.571]  Gary Hart wrote a letter four years ago to Iran saying the U.S.
[00:46:30.591 --> 00:46:32.873]  government will stage a terror attack in the U.S.
[00:46:33.233 --> 00:46:33.994]  to blame it on you.
[00:46:34.014 --> 00:46:35.035]  You better do what we say.
[00:46:35.776 --> 00:46:37.037]  Then we are changed interviewed him.
[00:46:37.057 --> 00:46:39.339]  He admitted it after they could read the quotes to him.
[00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:40.580]  He first lied and denied it.
[00:46:41.541 --> 00:46:43.323]  And then he published it in the Huffington Post.
[00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:46.139]  But here's another one.
[00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:49.780]  Time Magazine wants to restrict internet to licensed users.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.321]  Time, in concert with pro-censorship groups, is backing a plan that would require a license, i.e.
[00:46:55.361 --> 00:46:57.681]  government sanction, for people to get on the internet.
[00:46:57.701 --> 00:46:58.221]  Proponents.
[00:46:59.101 --> 00:47:02.102]  Radio host and conspiracy junkie Alex Jones.
[00:47:03.142 --> 00:47:03.922]  Colonel of Truth.
[00:47:03.982 --> 00:47:14.524]  Time published a story reporting on Microsoft executive at a UN Davos meeting who'd like to see licensing to combat anonymity, which the White House and Cass Sunstein called for, and which Time Magazine said was good.
[00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:18.686]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:47:18.786 --> 00:47:25.350]  So they even here say, they say this is happening, but yeah, we are kind of calling for it, but still Alex Jones is a junkie.
[00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.692]  I mean, it's just, it's just idiocy.
[00:47:27.752 --> 00:47:30.173]  It shows their contempt for the general public.
[00:47:30.193 --> 00:47:31.074]  And I agree with you.
[00:47:31.554 --> 00:47:32.635]  I think they're delusional.
[00:47:32.755 --> 00:47:38.339]  I think they've got so much chutzpah or arrogance or bravado that they don't understand what's happening, Michael.
[00:47:38.359 --> 00:47:44.663]  I mean, when I say liberty's on fire, every major globalist agenda is crashing and burning right now.
[00:47:45.043 --> 00:47:46.324]  I'm worried about false flag.
[00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:56.949]  Yes, I, gosh, I wish I didn't agree with you, but they probably will do something.
[00:47:57.489 --> 00:47:58.670]  People are going to die.
[00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:04.312]  They're going to try to terrify us into, you know, following the government.
[00:48:04.712 --> 00:48:14.857]  Anytime there's this, you know, like the World Trade Center coming down, you know, a significant portion of the public will turn to the government to go protect us, save us, help us.
[00:48:17.219 --> 00:48:36.084]  I don't think that's going to be as prevalent, but yeah, you're right, they will probably do something, kill people in America, but I think that most of our patriots, fellow patriots, will recognize it for what it is, and that will be their moment that they jump on board.
[00:48:36.144 --> 00:48:38.705]  We are going to restore this republic.
[00:48:39.656 --> 00:48:40.476]  Well, I agree.
[00:48:40.496 --> 00:48:44.558]  I mean, look at Kurt Haskell with the underwear bomber and his wife and other witnesses.
[00:48:45.158 --> 00:48:46.939]  They aren't really 9-11 truthers.
[00:48:46.959 --> 00:48:48.079]  I mean, they've admitted that.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.981]  But they like to keep that somewhat on the low down so the media doesn't make too big an issue out of it.
[00:48:53.741 --> 00:48:54.762]  And they called them liars.
[00:48:54.782 --> 00:48:55.642]  And then later it came out.
[00:48:55.702 --> 00:48:56.402]  It was all true.
[00:48:56.442 --> 00:48:56.863]  The U.S.
[00:48:56.883 --> 00:48:59.103]  government ordered him to be allowed on that plane.
[00:48:59.364 --> 00:49:04.505]  That's mainstream news because we now have our people everywhere watching them.
[00:49:07.947 --> 00:49:08.267]  I agree.
[00:49:08.977 --> 00:49:17.126]  And I strongly recommend that your listeners walk around with a video camera because you never know where you're going to see tyranny manifested.
[00:49:17.527 --> 00:49:20.069]  You know, we do live in a totalitarian police state.
[00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.153]  That's obvious to anybody who's got their eyes open.
[00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:28.739]  Naked body scanners violate child porn laws in the US, Canada, England.
[00:49:28.759 --> 00:49:29.579]  They're putting them in.
[00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:32.961]  Chertoff's making money off of it, who made the order a year and a half ago.
[00:49:33.321 --> 00:49:34.621]  Obama's continuing it.
[00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:38.283]  Clearly an act of domination, a way to make us submit.
[00:49:38.743 --> 00:49:41.684]  And now they've been caught lying, saying they don't record your naked bodies.
[00:49:41.744 --> 00:49:43.525]  I mean, when does government not lie?
[00:49:43.545 --> 00:49:45.966]  Well, I don't know.
[00:49:46.346 --> 00:49:51.948]  I've been studying the government for many, many years, and there are very few instances of that.
[00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:53.269]  So, yeah.
[00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:56.023]  I am concerned about those as well.
[00:49:56.443 --> 00:50:05.773]  I mean, personally, I don't care that they take a photo of my body, but I think it is a violation of everybody's privacy, and we need to put an end to it.
[00:50:07.936 --> 00:50:08.596]  Absolutely.
[00:50:08.616 --> 00:50:13.138]  We predicted they'd start videotaping TV and movie stars, and now it's been confirmed that's happening.
[00:50:13.658 --> 00:50:16.459]  The British government tried to lie about it at first, then got caught.
[00:50:16.499 --> 00:50:17.439]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:50:17.779 --> 00:50:18.780]  Five final minutes.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.761]  We're coming back in 70 seconds after this break to start the halfway point of the radio broadcast.
[00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:31.164]  Then at the 8 after, after Michael Bagnerik leaves us, we've got Webster Tarpley coming on with one of the most important stories we're covering.
[00:50:31.624 --> 00:50:35.265]  The neocons are laying the groundwork for an attempted assassination of Obama.
[00:50:38.843 --> 00:50:40.427]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:52:00.876 --> 00:52:01.517]  Big Brother.
[00:52:02.177 --> 00:52:03.218]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:03.938 --> 00:52:05.039]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.521]  You want answers?
[00:52:07.301 --> 00:52:08.222]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:08.842 --> 00:52:12.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:13.026 --> 00:52:17.069]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:18.934 --> 00:52:22.575]  Top story at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:52:22.916 --> 00:52:25.437]  Obama is being blackmailed into attacking Iran.
[00:52:25.457 --> 00:52:29.458]  Neocon's hype assassination attempt on President to be blamed on political extremists.
[00:52:29.858 --> 00:52:32.599]  Obama is the next false flag.
[00:52:32.839 --> 00:52:42.963]  They're definitely pre-programming the population for this, as they did before 9-11, as they did before Copenhagen, as they did before the flu outbreak we told you three months before.
[00:52:43.383 --> 00:52:44.804]  We understand their operations.
[00:52:44.944 --> 00:52:46.965]  I'm telling you, they're moving on this front.
[00:52:47.745 --> 00:52:54.028]  Michael Bagnerik, all I can say is I am so glad you didn't die, even though you did die for 10 minutes with that massive total heart attack.
[00:52:54.548 --> 00:52:55.869]  And it's good to have you back with us.
[00:52:55.929 --> 00:53:03.352]  We've got four minutes left and I'd like to just get your final comments, statements, words of encouragement.
[00:53:03.632 --> 00:53:04.733]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:53:05.513 --> 00:53:11.496]  Well, I'd like to invite you and your wife to attend my Constitution class on March 13th as my guest.
[00:53:12.577 --> 00:53:15.398]  I would love to get out to see you again.
[00:53:15.851 --> 00:53:17.834]  Maybe we can have dinner when I come into town.
[00:53:19.136 --> 00:53:22.520]  But for your listeners, really, just don't give up hope.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.523]  It's always darkest just before the dawn.
[00:53:25.204 --> 00:53:31.333]  I know that the New World Order is coming down with a lot of really strange laws.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.342]  But that's only because we are being successful in the Liberty Movement.
[00:53:37.703 --> 00:53:39.183]  You know, get to know your neighbors.
[00:53:39.584 --> 00:53:41.805]  Throw a little barbecue as soon as it warms up.
[00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:43.185]  Get to know your neighbors.
[00:53:43.225 --> 00:53:51.549]  Those are the people that you're going to need to rely on, you know, if the electricity goes out or, you know, when there's a little bit of social unrest.
[00:53:51.869 --> 00:53:53.290]  You need to know who you can trust.
[00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:56.024]  And you need to get involved with your neighbors now.
[00:53:56.504 --> 00:53:57.484]  Stock up on food.
[00:53:58.284 --> 00:54:03.006]  Get one of the solar power generators that Alex advertises.
[00:54:03.786 --> 00:54:04.807]  You need to be prepared.
[00:54:05.427 --> 00:54:06.927]  And you need to know the truth.
[00:54:07.467 --> 00:54:10.889]  So continue listening to Alex's program.
[00:54:11.389 --> 00:54:17.711]  And if you'd like to take my class, you can find out all you need at constitutionpreservation.org.
[00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:28.565]  And when we get up here and we say we're winning, we're having success, I mean, ten years ago I was saying we're doomed if people don't wake up.
[00:54:28.926 --> 00:54:30.627]  I mean, I don't just get up here and cheerlead.
[00:54:31.027 --> 00:54:32.348]  Look at all the evidence.
[00:54:32.468 --> 00:54:34.030]  Look at the success we're having.
[00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:41.696]  That's why it's more important than ever that people that were fighting 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago and then quit, all that
[00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:47.833]  Work they did decades ago is now bearing fruit, but now, you know, make hay while the sun's shining.
[00:54:48.673 --> 00:54:50.874]  People's minds are fertile to be unlocked now.
[00:54:50.934 --> 00:55:00.316]  I mean, there is an awakening that's terrifying the globalists, and they're so greedy that the banks are openly robbing the planet, but they're now revealed.
[00:55:00.356 --> 00:55:02.016]  I mean, this is so positive.
[00:55:02.056 --> 00:55:06.017]  In closing, why do you think they've gone public with world government after denying it?
[00:55:06.357 --> 00:55:07.738]  I mean, I guess we're just to that point now.
[00:55:07.958 --> 00:55:08.918]  It's time for them to admit it.
[00:55:09.924 --> 00:55:13.987]  I think their window of opportunity is closing.
[00:55:15.008 --> 00:55:22.513]  If you're a farmer and you've got all the animals inside the corral, you don't have to rush because there's no way that the animals can escape.
[00:55:23.093 --> 00:55:32.900]  But if there's an open gate someplace where the animals get out, you've got to run and try to close that gate to trap all the animals.
[00:55:33.587 --> 00:55:39.450]  And I think from their point of view, they do not have things, you know, completely in hand.
[00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:46.112]  Otherwise, there'd be no reason for them to rush, to try to push this through as quickly as possible.
[00:55:46.492 --> 00:55:50.254]  And I believe that it is, especially because we are waking up.
[00:55:51.595 --> 00:55:57.917]  I can't even estimate how many people you've brought, woke up with your programs and your videos.
[00:55:58.638 --> 00:56:02.019]  When I was at home recovering with my parents, my mother and I,
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:08.224]  Watch the Fall of the Republic and she sat on the edge of the couch with her mouth open.
[00:56:08.644 --> 00:56:11.506]  I have to confess, I kept pushing pause to go, see?
[00:56:11.787 --> 00:56:12.387]  I told ya!
[00:56:12.727 --> 00:56:13.388]  I told ya!
[00:56:13.408 --> 00:56:14.829]  And then we'd push play again.
[00:56:15.771 --> 00:56:17.092]  Well, I want to interview you.
[00:56:17.132 --> 00:56:20.575]  I keep meaning to do this for the next fall of the Republic.
[00:56:20.995 --> 00:56:27.380]  So perhaps when you do come to Austin, you can come a day early and I can get you a hotel room a day early and then we can come interview you.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.520]  Maybe go to dinner that way.
[00:56:29.421 --> 00:56:31.823]  I would want to be a distraction at your event.
[00:56:32.103 --> 00:56:34.465]  There might be some COINTELPRO show up and say I'm not supposed to be there.
[00:56:36.506 --> 00:56:37.007]  I'm serious.
[00:56:37.107 --> 00:56:37.808]  It's unbelievable.
[00:56:37.828 --> 00:56:38.469]  They're all over me.
[00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:42.214]  Michael Bagnerik, I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:56:42.655 --> 00:56:43.876]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[00:56:43.916 --> 00:56:49.103]  Webster Tarpley's coming up after I play a four-minute clip of Ron Paul on the economic implosion in Europe.
[00:56:49.384 --> 00:56:51.106]  Webster Tarpley with key info straight ahead.
[00:56:51.567 --> 00:56:52.989]  Michael Bagnerik, we love you.
[00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.649]  You're awesome.
[00:56:54.386 --> 00:56:55.227]  You are too, Alex.
[00:56:55.307 --> 00:56:55.627]  Thanks.
[00:56:56.327 --> 00:57:00.550]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:01.490]  Number one.
[00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:04.952]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:05.212 --> 00:57:05.793]  Number two.
[00:57:06.073 --> 00:57:10.636]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:10.956 --> 00:57:11.416]  It's true.
[00:57:11.696 --> 00:57:16.259]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:17.120]  Number 3.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.682]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:20.983 --> 00:57:24.685]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:24.906 --> 00:57:25.446]  Number 4.
[00:57:25.686 --> 00:57:28.068]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:28.448 --> 00:57:31.831]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:32.131 --> 00:57:32.331]  Number 5.
[00:57:32.932 --> 00:57:36.855]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:37.075 --> 00:57:41.839]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:42.119 --> 00:57:46.143]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:46.283 --> 00:57:47.865]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:48.065 --> 00:57:50.167]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:57:50.327 --> 00:57:52.670]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:57:57.998 --> 00:58:01.639]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:01.959 --> 00:58:10.081]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:58:10.822 --> 00:58:14.883]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:58:15.443 --> 00:58:26.266]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:58:26.906 --> 00:58:35.914]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:36.415 --> 00:58:41.439]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:49.046]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:49.346 --> 00:58:52.089]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:58:57.193 --> 00:59:00.856]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:01.216 --> 00:59:04.218]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:09.242]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:09.262 --> 00:59:15.506]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:15.646 --> 00:59:17.888]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:18.688]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:18.708 --> 00:59:19.149]  Bernanke?
[00:59:19.229 --> 00:59:19.829]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:21.170]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:23.432]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:37.321 --> 00:59:39.161]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:44.222]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:44.583 --> 00:59:54.525]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:55.665 --> 00:59:59.286]  Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update for February 15th.
[00:59:59.986 --> 01:00:05.107]  Last week we were reminded that ours is not the only country suffering from severe economic turmoil.
[01:00:05.808 --> 01:00:09.831]  The Greek government is the latest to come close to default on their massive public debt.
[01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:17.056]  Greece has insufficient funds in their treasury to make even the minimum payments that are now coming due.
[01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:25.401]  Their debt level is about 120% of their gross domestic product, and their public sector absorbs what amounts to 40% of GDP.
[01:00:26.202 --> 01:00:32.246]  Any talk of cutting costs and spending is met with violent protests from the many Greeks heavily dependent on government payments.
[01:00:33.035 --> 01:00:38.199]  Mounting fears of default have sent shockwaves through their creditors and all of the Eurozone countries.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:46.205]  There have been statements made by the European Central Bank to calm fears and give assurances that Greece will get the aid it needs.
[01:00:46.805 --> 01:00:49.547]  Details of agreements are not forthcoming.
[01:00:50.348 --> 01:00:54.911]  Is it possible that our Federal Reserve has had some hand in bailing out Greece?
[01:00:55.481 --> 01:01:02.983]  The fact is, we don't know, and current laws exempt agreements between the Fed and foreign central banks from disclosure or audit.
[01:01:03.603 --> 01:01:09.965]  Greece is only the latest in a series of countries that have faced this type of crisis in recent memory.
[01:01:10.525 --> 01:01:16.266]  Not too long ago, the same types of fears were mounting about Dubai, and before that, Iceland.
[01:01:17.387 --> 01:01:21.828]  Several other countries, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Latvia,
[01:01:22.521 --> 01:01:25.662]  Are approaching crisis level with public debt as well.
[01:01:26.262 --> 01:01:34.523]  Many have strong ties to Goldman Sachs and the case could easily be made that default could have serious implications for big U.S.
[01:01:34.703 --> 01:01:35.844]  banking cartels.
[01:01:36.884 --> 01:01:41.905]  Considering the ties between the Fed and these big banks, it's not outlandish to wonder if the U.S.
[01:01:41.945 --> 01:01:48.346]  taxpayer is secretly bailing out the entire world, country by country, even as our real unemployment tops 20%.
[01:01:50.757 --> 01:02:00.920]  Unless laws are changed to allow a complete and meaningful audit of the Federal Reserve, including its agreements with foreign central banks, we might never know if this is occurring or not.
[01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:08.643]  This global financial crisis is a predictable result of secretive central banking and unsound fiat currency.
[01:02:10.163 --> 01:02:15.545]  Governments are entirely committed to this system of fiat money and fraction reserve banking for obvious reasons.
[01:02:16.437 --> 01:02:20.801]  It enables them to do what they love most, spend hordes of money with near impunity.
[01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:24.924]  Without the limitations of sound money, governments will spend without limit.
[01:02:25.305 --> 01:02:38.816]  They will spend money to hire their cronies, pay off special interests, give out favors, create dependents, and generally distract from the terrible job that they do as their chief mandate, which is to protect the liberties of the people.
[01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:52.266]  Fiat money is a blank check to government, which is very dangerous, and we are witnessing the death throes of the system as the bills come due, and the underlying capital is squandered away.
[01:02:53.727 --> 01:03:05.474]  Because of our globe-straddling empire and lingering reserve currency status, perhaps no one has a more vested interest in keeping the system cobbled together than our own government and the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:06.573 --> 01:03:16.775]  The agreements that Iceland and Dubai and Greece have negotiated can amount to little more than kicking the kingdom down the road, as their overall spending habits remain largely intact.
[01:03:17.115 --> 01:03:22.477]  Fiat currencies are still legal tender, and more debt is issued on top of unsustainable debt.
[01:03:23.817 --> 01:03:31.859]  The American people have the right to know if they are going to be the ones holding the bag in the end, because the Federal Reserve secretly put them on the hook for it.
[01:03:32.805 --> 01:03:39.011]  This knowledge would be a key factor in peacefully dismantling this immoral and unconstitutional system.
[01:03:40.232 --> 01:03:41.434]  Thanks for calling this update.
[01:03:41.714 --> 01:03:44.677]  A new update is placed on this number, 888-322-1100.
[01:03:44.897 --> 01:03:47.419]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that's Ron Paul.
[01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:51.523]  We're going to be talking about the complete economic meltdown that's clearly happening.
[01:03:51.984 --> 01:03:55.607]  Sales tax revenues, property tax revenues, all plunging.
[01:03:56.548 --> 01:04:01.953]  The next big crisis now beginning in commercial real estate as shops where I live shut down everywhere.
[01:04:02.314 --> 01:04:05.256]  Many shopping centers, even in middle class areas, are half empty.
[01:04:05.637 --> 01:04:07.118]  Poor areas, it's even worse.
[01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:17.087]  I want to go over that coming up in about 30 minutes with Webster Griffin Tarbley, who is an economist, a PhD of history as well, a doctor of history.
[01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:19.889]  And we really appreciate him joining us.
[01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.551]  We sell all four of his published books.
[01:04:22.571 --> 01:04:27.353]  9-11 Synthetic Terror, his two books on Obama, his Economic Cataclysm book.
[01:04:27.373 --> 01:04:31.375]  They're all invaluable and discounted at Infowars.com.
[01:04:31.415 --> 01:04:33.636]  And you may know all this stuff, or may think you know it all.
[01:04:33.976 --> 01:04:35.377]  You'll learn a lot reading Tarpley's books.
[01:04:35.757 --> 01:04:37.238]  Get them, give them to other folks.
[01:04:37.398 --> 01:04:41.220]  Every mind you unlock is one step closer to bringing down the New World Order.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.902]  Believing that these people aren't invincible is half the battle.
[01:04:45.222 --> 01:04:46.283]  Knowing who the enemy is.
[01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, is half the battle.
[01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:49.444]  Taking action is the rest.
[01:04:49.524 --> 01:04:52.665]  Now, we're going to go to Tarpley in a moment.
[01:04:52.705 --> 01:04:55.706]  I first want to read from some of this article.
[01:04:56.246 --> 01:05:14.492]  I thought of Tarpley over the weekend as I was doing research because I had remembered months ago when they had the gate crashes at the White House and how they talked about how that he wasn't safe in the White House and Tarpley tied it in with some other news and I've learned to respect what he has to say is piercing understanding
[01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:25.235]  He said these were threats to Obama and that they were opening the public mind and creating kind of a track that Obama is going to be assassinated.
[01:05:25.695 --> 01:05:28.216]  There's already been a huge discussion of this in the media.
[01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:37.340]  Then I started seeing Sean Hannity and other neocon mouthpieces like Glenn Beck saying 9-11 truthers will try to kill Obama.
[01:05:37.941 --> 01:05:40.122]  Now 9-11 truthers are against
[01:05:41.268 --> 01:05:43.516]  9-11 truthers expose false flag.
[01:05:43.536 --> 01:05:46.648]  9-11 truthers expose Obama as a puppet.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200]  You know, they're non-partisan.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:49.901]  It's been proven.
[01:05:51.221 --> 01:05:52.601]  Under Bush, they said we were liberals.
[01:05:52.641 --> 01:05:54.642]  Now, under Obama, they say we're right-wingers.
[01:05:55.022 --> 01:06:01.624]  And they talk about, oh my gosh, Debra Medina might be a 9-11 truther, and the Democratic candidate in Texas is openly questioning 9-11.
[01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:02.844]  It's like everybody is.
[01:06:03.165 --> 01:06:04.225]  And the polls show that.
[01:06:04.825 --> 01:06:09.466]  And so, depending on the poll, 36% to 84%, they vary widely.
[01:06:09.486 --> 01:06:13.708]  And Angus and Reed and Gallup and Scripps Howard News Service polls.
[01:06:14.088 --> 01:06:14.708]  But let's say 50%.
[01:06:15.108 --> 01:06:16.288]  Let's take the medium.
[01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:17.709]  I mean, let's take the middle here.
[01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:35.274]  When they try to stage an attack on the Christmas Day, you got 9-11 truthers, people that are tuned in on board, they notice he was led on, protected, somebody else had a bomb, the FBI says they're liars, a month later it comes out, the FBI reverses their story, okay, we helped him get on the plane, you know, as a part of an intelligence operation.
[01:06:35.294 --> 01:06:37.855]  We'll talk about that with Tarpley as well.
[01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:40.695]  We may have to keep a little bit in the next hour because I'm getting to him late here.
[01:06:41.616 --> 01:06:48.157]  But, again, there's so much data that goes into this, I'm always trying to give listeners a picture of my mind and my understanding.
[01:06:50.529 --> 01:06:56.053]  Then, when I saw Glenn Beck start singing on the radio and TV the last three weeks, and I'm just spot-checking him.
[01:06:56.873 --> 01:07:01.436]  I tune in, he calls for a new value-added tax, a new sales tax to pay the bankers, another bailout.
[01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:04.278]  I tune in, he's for the Patriot Act.
[01:07:04.378 --> 01:07:06.120]  I tune in, same thing with O'Reilly.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.102]  9-11 troopers want to kill the President.
[01:07:09.662 --> 01:07:11.383]  No evidence, they're just saying this.
[01:07:11.703 --> 01:07:12.704]  Who's their number one enemy?
[01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:19.669]  According to White House regulations are, that Obama's now operating under, saying he'll just use executive orders to circumvent everything.
[01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:22.365]  9-11 truthers.
[01:07:22.485 --> 01:07:24.990]  What does North Common Homeland Security say their big enemy is?
[01:07:25.411 --> 01:07:27.655]  Christians, conservatives, returning veterans, gun owners.
[01:07:27.675 --> 01:07:28.477]  9-11 truthers.
[01:07:28.597 --> 01:07:29.178]  In the fetters.
[01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:31.222]  People that are awake.
[01:07:31.302 --> 01:07:31.863]  Populist.
[01:07:32.124 --> 01:07:32.946]  Constitutionalist.
[01:07:34.221 --> 01:07:38.384]  And so I see them openly saying 9-11 truth is going to try to kill him.
[01:07:38.824 --> 01:07:41.005]  And Beck's like, I'm predicting it, mark my words.
[01:07:41.566 --> 01:07:43.167]  They love to act like prophets.
[01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:44.728]  So we know.
[01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:46.829]  That's how I knew they were going to launch 9-11.
[01:07:46.889 --> 01:07:49.731]  I saw them introducing bin Laden as the boogeyman.
[01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:50.532]  He's going to get you.
[01:07:50.572 --> 01:07:51.452]  He's going to attack you.
[01:07:51.772 --> 01:07:53.674]  I knew the feds had cooked the bomb, trained the driver in 93.
[01:07:53.714 --> 01:07:55.755]  I knew they'd already attacked the World Trade Center.
[01:07:56.235 --> 01:07:59.998]  I knew they had foreign operatives running the World Trade Center and a bunch of other data.
[01:08:00.058 --> 01:08:02.859]  I said they're going to attack it the next few months, blame it on bin Laden.
[01:08:02.899 --> 01:08:03.340]  I was right.
[01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:07.113]  Three months before the flu outbreak, I got government documents.
[01:08:07.133 --> 01:08:08.835]  They were getting ready to stage something on flu.
[01:08:08.895 --> 01:08:09.335]  Told you!
[01:08:10.116 --> 01:08:11.077]  It's the same thing here.
[01:08:11.277 --> 01:08:13.519]  They are planning to attempt to kill Obama.
[01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:14.459]  He's probably in on it.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:25.509]  It'll be staged like ten years ago with the situation in Taiwan with their president staging a shooting of himself and it came out it was fake.
[01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:28.471]  They did a fake grazing and just had some blanks go off.
[01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:30.333]  And a little fake cut he put on himself.
[01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:34.222]  So this is done over and over again, or they could really kill him.
[01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:41.965]  And that's why I've got Webster Tarpley on to break this down and give us his take on it from his slightly different perspective from mine.
[01:08:42.025 --> 01:08:44.166]  It's not that we disagree, I just want to get his view on it.
[01:08:44.866 --> 01:08:49.808]  But key article up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:08:49.928 --> 01:08:53.169]  Obama is being blackmailed into attacking Iran.
[01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:58.351]  Neocons hype assassination attempt on President to be blamed on political extremists.
[01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:00.012]  And this is why this is important.
[01:09:00.532 --> 01:09:06.454]  Dovetailed with all this, they say, if you attack Iran, we're going to support you.
[01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:07.974]  Sarah Palin, Beck, have all said it.
[01:09:09.874 --> 01:09:12.355]  If you don't, the 9-11 truthers will kill you.
[01:09:12.695 --> 01:09:17.556]  So the message is, we're going to kill you and blame it on our opposition if you don't do this.
[01:09:17.636 --> 01:09:21.257]  Now, let's see if Webster Griffin Tarpley agrees with my analysis.
[01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:23.498]  I didn't talk to him before he went on air.
[01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:24.958]  You're going to find out with me right now.
[01:09:25.278 --> 01:09:27.379]  Dr. Tarpley, do you agree and what can you add?
[01:09:28.433 --> 01:09:31.094]  Well, I think you've certainly identified a real problem.
[01:09:31.695 --> 01:09:36.477]  Maybe we take a couple of steps backward, though, because I think it's a complex problem.
[01:09:37.278 --> 01:09:48.084]  During the election campaign, the idea that Obama's life was in danger was largely a myth spread by his own campaign, I think, by his own followers.
[01:09:48.124 --> 01:09:52.146]  They had a deep emotional need to believe that Obama was in danger.
[01:09:52.786 --> 01:09:56.947]  Because this helped to mask the fact that he was so obviously a Wall Street puppet.
[01:09:56.967 --> 01:09:59.927]  In other words, he was a wholly owned subsidiary of Wall Street.
[01:09:59.967 --> 01:10:13.030]  But somehow, the emotional need of the Obama supporter was to view him as somebody who was an anti-establishment rebel and insurgent and therefore in grave danger because he was... So is this back trying to invoke Democrats to hate 9-11 truthers?
[01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:15.030]  Well, I think that's now a different phase.
[01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:17.051]  Now, let's also look at what the...
[01:10:18.522 --> 01:10:26.586]  The idea that Obama needs to be blackmailed in order to attack Iran, I think, is also probably not germane.
[01:10:26.986 --> 01:10:28.587]  Obama ran as a warmonger, right?
[01:10:28.607 --> 01:10:36.131]  We have to remember, he ran as the guy who was going to bomb Pakistan unilaterally without talking to the Pakistani government.
[01:10:36.591 --> 01:10:40.753]  He was very, very adamant about that, and he was going to win the war in Afghanistan.
[01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:49.899]  And we had this famous incident where Obama said, I'm going to send assassins, and I'm going to send predator drones into Pakistan to get Obama where he lives.
[01:10:50.759 --> 01:10:52.800]  And Hillary Clinton said, no, this is too much.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.261]  McCain said, it's too much.
[01:10:54.661 --> 01:11:00.305]  And even Bush said, no, it's too much, because I talked to my friend Musharraf there, who was running Pakistan at the time.
[01:11:00.425 --> 01:11:04.127]  Only the fake liberal could get away with expanding war.
[01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:05.728]  So... All right, now that's one phase.
[01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:10.572]  If we look at, Obama has had these, I think, three incidents, right?
[01:11:10.592 --> 01:11:15.798]  We had the Salahis on the night of the Manmohan Singh state dinner back in December.
[01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:18.761]  We had another guy who got in the same night.
[01:11:19.281 --> 01:11:24.367]  So there were two incidents counting three people that night, and then apparently a month before that,
[01:11:24.867 --> 01:11:29.591]  There was a middle-aged black war veteran and his wife who got into a breakfast.
[01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:33.914]  So it's a total of three incidents, five people got in who should not have gotten in.
[01:11:34.014 --> 01:11:37.417]  Obama would have been well advised to fire the head of the Secret Service, which he didn't do.
[01:11:40.322 --> 01:11:42.563]  We're going to skip this break because this is so important.
[01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:43.603]  I do this occasionally.
[01:11:44.103 --> 01:11:44.884]  Webster, continue.
[01:11:44.904 --> 01:11:46.144]  Let's compare this, right?
[01:11:46.184 --> 01:11:47.585]  Let's compare it to some others, right?
[01:11:47.605 --> 01:11:52.426]  Because what I would argue is that Obama's treatment has been relatively mild so far.
[01:11:53.567 --> 01:11:55.607]  Ronald Reagan, what did he have?
[01:11:55.947 --> 01:11:57.368]  He had Hinckley shooting at him.
[01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:59.969]  So I think that's a pretty clear one.
[01:12:00.589 --> 01:12:03.450]  Gerald Ford had at least two people, right?
[01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:06.971]  He had Lynette Squeaky Fromm and Sarah Jane Moore shooting at him.
[01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:08.832]  In the case of Clinton,
[01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:15.636]  It's often forgotten, in 1993-94, there were lots of really rough things done to Clinton.
[01:12:16.377 --> 01:12:22.882]  His helicopter crashed, killing three or four Marines who were flying that Marine One.
[01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.903]  There was a guy in the D.C.
[01:12:24.963 --> 01:12:33.349]  City Council here, who was a political friend of Clinton's by the name of Wilson, who was found hanged in his apartment.
[01:12:34.282 --> 01:12:44.425]  And then you've got Vince Foster, and I always viewed Vince Foster as the intelligence community murdering a person in Clinton's immediate entourage in order to intimidate him.
[01:12:44.785 --> 01:12:46.766]  Other people saw it as Clinton doing this.
[01:12:46.826 --> 01:12:48.166]  I don't see how that makes any sense.
[01:12:48.667 --> 01:12:55.809]  What makes sense to me is that's the intelligence community doing that, right up here in Fort Marcy, above the Potomac.
[01:12:56.469 --> 01:13:07.394]  You also had in Clinton's, a little bit later in the Clinton presidency, you had this case where a light plane actually crashed into the side of the White House, not so far from Clinton's office, right?
[01:13:07.414 --> 01:13:08.415]  That was a few years on.
[01:13:09.298 --> 01:13:15.963]  In the case of Bush, we have to remember 9-11 itself, it was full of threats to Bush.
[01:13:16.003 --> 01:13:17.964]  And I've written about this at great length, right?
[01:13:17.984 --> 01:13:25.770]  There were reports coming to Bush that there was an attack going on on his ranch, that there were other planes were going to come crash into Air Force One.
[01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:26.950]  He ran away scared.
[01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:29.012]  So clearly he's such a delusional puppet.
[01:13:29.032 --> 01:13:32.714]  You're saying from your research, he was only let in on it later?
[01:13:33.695 --> 01:13:34.015]  Sure.
[01:13:34.876 --> 01:13:40.940]  He's a very low-level participant in this, and indeed, the centerpiece of 9-11 is Angel Is Next.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:46.164]  I have a whole chapter about Angel Is Next in my book on 9-11, which is a direct threat to Bush.
[01:13:46.544 --> 01:13:59.573]  If you don't do what we want, which is to declare the war of civilizations against Iraq and get going and start saying bin Laden and al-Qaeda and terrorism and all this, then something bad is going to happen to you.
[01:14:01.074 --> 01:14:05.995]  So you can see that compared to other presidents, this has not been very rough, right?
[01:14:06.015 --> 01:14:10.316]  Obama has now got these incidents, three incidents, five people.
[01:14:10.816 --> 01:14:19.299]  He's also got a significant number of death threats, but he's also—a couple of people have already been sentenced to jail for threatening Obama.
[01:14:19.339 --> 01:14:28.881]  But I think, on the whole, this is not the roughest treatment that we've seen in recent years, although it unmistakably is a reminder to Obama
[01:14:29.804 --> 01:14:33.045]  That he is a puppet, and he better remember that he's a puppet.
[01:14:33.526 --> 01:14:59.257]  I think what we saw in the case of the Christmas Patsy, with the State Department now revealing through this guy, Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy, they've revealed that there was a desire in the State Department, an intention in the State Department to revoke the visa of the Detroit Christmas Patsy, Muttalib, but that this revoking of the visa was blocked.
[01:14:59.838 --> 01:15:00.739]  By a U.S.
[01:15:00.839 --> 01:15:02.940]  agency, which he refused to name in public.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.120]  He wouldn't tell you what it was.
[01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:09.223]  But somebody came forward and said, no, we're putting a national security override on this.
[01:15:09.263 --> 01:15:12.184]  We're flagging this guy's name because we're tailing him.
[01:15:12.224 --> 01:15:12.985]  We're watching him.
[01:15:13.025 --> 01:15:13.965]  We've got eyes on him.
[01:15:14.346 --> 01:15:16.407]  He's going to lead us to some really big fish.
[01:15:16.747 --> 01:15:18.087]  So, therefore, you can't touch him.
[01:15:18.127 --> 01:15:18.748]  He's immune.
[01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:23.690]  And, of course, that's the classic method that a mole uses to protect a patsy.
[01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.772]  The mole's responsibility is to make sure that the patsy got through.
[01:15:26.972 --> 01:15:51.582]  And we see that with Oklahoma City, we see it with 9-11, in every case, the shoe bomber, the government gets them on the plane, the government causes a stand-down, they're always being trained, but Webster... Rather than say Alex, rather than say government, in this case you see that Obama... It's private, global, corporate, intelligence, nexus networks, with key rogue groups interfacing at international level, but you also have...
[01:15:53.052 --> 01:15:53.352]  We're good.
[01:16:10.154 --> 01:16:18.876]  The Obama White House thinks that the Christmas Day incident was intentional by a network with an alternative agenda and that it's designed to make Obama look bad.
[01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:26.218]  Now, the Obama look bad part is very superficial and trivial compared to the big geopolitical goals that are always involved, right?
[01:16:26.238 --> 01:16:27.298]  We had several weeks of hysteria.
[01:16:27.378 --> 01:16:30.359]  Launch the new Yemen war, get the naked body scanners in.
[01:16:30.399 --> 01:16:39.141]  Look, I want to go over all this with you, but first, specifically, I know clearly they are putting out the talking point
[01:16:39.961 --> 01:17:02.701]  Through Neocon Channels, that 9-11 Truth, who we know is the White House and the Rogue Network's number one enemy, we have Cass Sunstein admitting it, we have Bush's congressional hearings saying it, Webster, they're clearly putting out the trial balloon, the psychological backstory, the history that 9-11 Truth is going to kill
[01:17:03.666 --> 01:17:04.267]  I don't know.
[01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:28.364]  Uh, getting ready to play it, considering that they may go ahead and try it.
[01:17:28.984 --> 01:17:40.835]  So they're gauging right now, uh, to stage an assassination on Obama to get his approval ratings up, and I believe he's probably involved in it, and then it could have the added intimidation threat on top of it.
[01:17:40.995 --> 01:17:46.600]  I mean, why are the neocons and others right now saying 9-11 Truth is going to try to kill him?
[01:17:47.475 --> 01:17:49.397]  Well, I think you have to take that very seriously.
[01:17:49.678 --> 01:17:56.706]  And the reason I think you should take it seriously is also because what's going on in the background, I think, is a very important strategic shift.
[01:17:56.766 --> 01:17:58.148]  And again, you have to take a step back.
[01:17:58.789 --> 01:18:02.914]  Last week, we had February 11th in Iran, right?
[01:18:02.934 --> 01:18:04.316]  The anniversary of the revolution.
[01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:05.517]  We're good.
[01:18:21.634 --> 01:18:30.117]  And overwhelm the Ahmadinejad supporters, overwhelm the existing government, and maybe start a people power coup on February 11th.
[01:18:30.858 --> 01:18:32.658]  This has been going on, of course, since last summer.
[01:18:32.998 --> 01:18:34.599]  Now, this was a complete failure.
[01:18:34.679 --> 01:18:36.320]  It fizzled completely.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:37.600]  They did not have the people.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.281]  They were not coordinated.
[01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:41.702]  Their forces are demoralized and so forth.
[01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:50.145]  So it means that, for the moment, the idea of overthrowing the Iranian government from within and getting a regime change is out the window.
[01:18:51.318 --> 01:19:03.182]  Now what you see from Hillary Clinton and others is beating the drum for crippling economic sanctions against Iran, but then behind that looms what I think is an important shift.
[01:19:03.562 --> 01:19:08.744]  For the first time in two years now, I think the attack on Iran is on the front burner.
[01:19:08.864 --> 01:19:10.264]  It was way on the back burner.
[01:19:10.665 --> 01:19:11.805]  It was several rows back.
[01:19:13.866 --> 01:19:17.009]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:19:17.029 --> 01:19:30.058]  They're moving in troops, moving in ships, moving in missile systems, defensive and offensive, and I want to walk through this with you, Webster, but specifically, when my little alarm bells start going off, you know, it's almost more than just the data.
[01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:33.881]  It's like a hunch, but I've pretty much always been right.
[01:19:34.442 --> 01:19:37.864]  Why are they saying 9-11 Truth is going to kill Obama?
[01:19:37.904 --> 01:19:38.745]  What's the point of that?
[01:19:39.181 --> 01:19:40.382]  Well, they want the option.
[01:19:40.683 --> 01:19:44.447]  Again, we have to be aware, though, there would probably be other options, right?
[01:19:44.467 --> 01:19:45.709]  You've mentioned some of them, right?
[01:19:45.729 --> 01:19:48.752]  Some of them would be disgruntled right-wing war veterans.
[01:19:48.832 --> 01:19:54.079]  But then again, the other possibility is somebody with a link to Iran would also be very convenient.
[01:19:54.119 --> 01:19:55.580]  No, no, that's what Beck's saying.
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.823]  He says 9-11 Truth works with Iran.
[01:19:57.843 --> 01:19:59.365]  So they're going to get a double goody.
[01:19:59.997 --> 01:20:02.159]  Well, that makes it even more plausible then.
[01:20:02.199 --> 01:20:05.722]  So I think everybody should take that stuff very, very, very seriously.
[01:20:05.782 --> 01:20:08.224]  So you think, I mean, you think my concerns are valid?
[01:20:08.444 --> 01:20:09.485]  Absolutely valid, sure.
[01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:20.033]  The only thing is that we've got to keep in mind that there's an array of possibilities, and every one of them gives them certain advantages.
[01:20:20.453 --> 01:20:21.154]  Here's the thing, though.
[01:20:21.494 --> 01:20:26.879]  The attack on Iran now is not the same as the attack on Iran in 2006-2007, when Cheney
[01:20:30.101 --> 01:20:43.955]  The Cheney group, the rogue network, invisible government, with Cheney as the visible part of that, above the waterline, they really wanted to attack Iran for the purpose of destroying Iran, and the other stuff would have been secondary.
[01:20:44.356 --> 01:20:48.540]  Right now, the attack on Iran is primarily directed against China.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:55.201]  Because the big thing in Washington right now is the absolute hysteria of the ruling class, right?
[01:20:55.221 --> 01:21:03.843]  The elite, the Wall Street group and their political commissars here in Washington, is the idea that China is catching up and passing the United States, right?
[01:21:03.863 --> 01:21:05.844]  It's already the world's biggest exporter.
[01:21:06.284 --> 01:21:10.365]  There's some question about whether it's past Japan to become the world's biggest economy.
[01:21:10.885 --> 01:21:11.466]  Stay there!
[01:21:11.506 --> 01:21:11.866]  Stay there!
[01:21:34.221 --> 01:21:34.862]  We've got a break.
[01:21:34.882 --> 01:21:36.963]  We're going to come back and go over this.
[01:21:36.983 --> 01:21:42.507]  And we have Hillary saying, we'll put sanctions on China if you don't let us attack Iran.
[01:21:42.547 --> 01:21:43.348]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:21:46.991 --> 01:21:47.891]  We're on the march.
[01:21:48.392 --> 01:21:49.993]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:50.934 --> 01:21:53.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:56.033 --> 01:22:01.395]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:22:01.415 --> 01:22:04.135]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:22:04.175 --> 01:22:08.597]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:22:09.497 --> 01:22:13.958]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.

[01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:59.152]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:59.552 --> 01:23:04.515]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:04.895 --> 01:23:06.616]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:06.936 --> 01:23:11.759]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:12.900]  How much do you want?
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:13.861]  When do you want it?
[01:23:14.241 --> 01:23:15.842]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:16.122 --> 01:23:16.963]  When will you need it?
[01:23:17.203 --> 01:23:19.264]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:19.404 --> 01:23:20.505]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:22.066]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:23:22.346 --> 01:23:27.330]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:30.713]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:23:31.113 --> 01:23:34.616]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:23:34.936 --> 01:23:35.917]  How much will you need?
[01:23:36.157 --> 01:23:36.777]  We don't know.
[01:23:37.058 --> 01:23:37.978]  How much do you want?
[01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:38.899]  All you can get.
[01:23:38.919 --> 01:23:39.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.943]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:23:43.244 --> 01:23:45.867]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:46.888]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:23:55.854 --> 01:23:56.835]  What's your home worth?
[01:23:57.016 --> 01:23:58.938]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:01.862]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:09.691]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:09.738]  Okay, Webster.
[01:25:11.859 --> 01:25:16.782]  Continuing as you give us this larger geopolitical breakdown, I agree with you.
[01:25:16.823 --> 01:25:23.907]  If you remember one of the few predictions where you were wrong, and nobody's perfect, but you were sure they were going to attack Iran, what was it, four years ago?
[01:25:24.748 --> 01:25:27.450]  And I didn't believe they were, from all my sources.
[01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:33.455]  But you've been right more times than I have been, and I agree with you this time, and that's why I'm worried.
[01:25:33.975 --> 01:25:36.718]  They clearly are saying they want to go into Iran.
[01:25:36.858 --> 01:25:37.718]  Israel's saying it.
[01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:38.859]  They're pre-positioning.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.701]  What will the attack look like?
[01:25:40.861 --> 01:25:41.862]  It's now on the front burner.
[01:25:41.922 --> 01:25:45.365]  How do we stop it from happening?
[01:25:46.126 --> 01:25:50.489]  And on the larger scene, how will they precipitate it?
[01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.371]  Will it be a false flag?
[01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:54.493]  What type of false flag are you looking for?
[01:25:55.145 --> 01:25:56.325]  Let me just backtrack.
[01:25:56.345 --> 01:26:09.788]  Now, the last time we had this active danger was 2006-2007, which was the twilight of the neocon, Cheney, invisible government regime under the second Bush administration.
[01:26:09.848 --> 01:26:19.651]  And that was, of course, the rogue B-52 of August to September 2007 was the high point of that, after which the danger, I think, because it had been blocked, right?
[01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:21.071]  The missing cruise missiles.
[01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:23.432]  That was blocked by forces inside the U.S.
[01:26:23.492 --> 01:26:25.213]  military and the intelligence community.
[01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.494]  And Fox Fallon said no?
[01:26:27.514 --> 01:26:29.615]  I mean, that was the real end of it.
[01:26:29.875 --> 01:26:32.856]  It went up the ladder and then the answer came back no.
[01:26:32.916 --> 01:26:36.458]  And the no probably came from Robert Gates and the Pentagon by then.
[01:26:36.478 --> 01:26:41.460]  The Brzezinski guy put in with the idea that they were going to change the policy and get rid of the neocon.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.981]  Approach to these things.
[01:26:43.462 --> 01:27:01.802]  When you had the national intelligence estimate of December 2007 saying, and it's worth stressing again today, there is no Iranian nuclear weapons program as of December 2007, that was a sign that inside the bureaucracy, the people who wanted the attack on Iran
[01:27:02.799 --> 01:27:03.319]  I think so.
[01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:28.478]  That you could then use Iran against China by cutting off oil, and against Russia by making trouble in the Caspian Sea and in Central Asia in general.
[01:27:28.818 --> 01:27:37.365]  So as soon as, I think by January 2008, I put out now that the attack on Iran was getting to be less and less likely.
[01:27:37.825 --> 01:27:39.647]  And I think that has held true during 2008, 2009.
[01:27:42.489 --> 01:27:46.631]  And now, currently, Iran is not making anything near fissile material.
[01:27:46.871 --> 01:27:52.193]  They asked France to enrich it for them so everybody would know it couldn't be used in a weapons system.
[01:27:52.213 --> 01:27:55.195]  They want to supply nuclear energy to the Middle East.
[01:27:55.255 --> 01:27:59.257]  They know that they can't count on oil, and they're told no, no, no.
[01:28:00.416 --> 01:28:04.199]  Right, which is, of course, illegal, it's outrageous, it's a double standard, right?
[01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:07.542]  Pakistan has nuclear weapons, Israel has nuclear weapons.
[01:28:07.602 --> 01:28:09.483]  What is the signaling out of Iran?
[01:28:10.064 --> 01:28:15.508]  It's contrary to international law, because in international law, everybody has to be equal, formally equal.
[01:28:15.528 --> 01:28:19.131]  There has to be complete reciprocity, no hypocrisy, no double standards.
[01:28:19.151 --> 01:28:20.211]  And we go back to 53.
[01:28:20.732 --> 01:28:23.234]  It's been an Anglo-American-British possession.
[01:28:23.414 --> 01:28:24.555]  They've always wanted it back.
[01:28:25.196 --> 01:28:29.699]  Right now, just in terms of the war danger, a couple of things to cite.
[01:28:30.199 --> 01:28:40.085]  Ahmadinejad, in his speech I guess yesterday or this morning even, says Israel wants war by spring-summer of this year.
[01:28:40.105 --> 01:28:42.326]  So, that's Ahmadinejad.
[01:28:42.966 --> 01:28:53.532]  And General Ivashoff, right, the former head of the Russian military, high official of the Russian Defense Ministry, I met him at Thierry Meyssan's Axis for Peace back in 2005.
[01:28:55.013 --> 01:29:01.518]  He says that the danger of an Israeli attack on Iran right now is greater than it ever was.
[01:29:02.039 --> 01:29:10.425]  And you've got Netanyahu in Moscow for two days trying to convince Russia, among other things, not to deliver this A300.
[01:29:12.126 --> 01:29:12.546]  I think so.
[01:29:27.134 --> 01:29:28.295]  All of this is coming together.
[01:29:28.555 --> 01:29:34.279]  In the middle of this, Hillary Clinton has made a speech, which I think is really a teachable moment.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:39.803]  She says, and she repeated this three times yesterday, she's in the Gulf, right?
[01:29:39.843 --> 01:29:43.366]  She was in Qatar, I guess, and then she went on to Saudi Arabia.
[01:29:43.386 --> 01:29:49.630]  She's trying to organize the Saudis and their friends in the Gulf Cooperation Council to be part of what looks
[01:29:49.810 --> 01:29:53.213]  And we now have a Saudi minister agreeing that sanctions aren't enough.
[01:29:53.273 --> 01:29:58.858]  So Saudi Arabia, where the 15 hijackers came from, always wanting to attack other countries.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:06.263]  Well, I think they fear Iran, and I think they've been cajoled and threatened, maybe, to go along with this.
[01:30:06.303 --> 01:30:08.924]  But here's what Hillary Clinton says is really bizarre.
[01:30:09.304 --> 01:30:15.207]  She says, the big danger now is that Iran is getting to be a military dictatorship.
[01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:27.052]  I think that is correct, and that's been visible for the past three, four, five months, that it's no longer the mullahs, it's no longer the mullahs, it's no longer the theocratic Islamic Republic.
[01:30:27.512 --> 01:30:28.313]  We're good to go.
[01:30:47.735 --> 01:30:52.559]  Yeah, they love a bunch of people running around, mutilating their women, acting like fools.
[01:30:52.619 --> 01:30:54.120]  That's why they fund these brigades.
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:31:00.305]  But they're scared of what they are, a scientific military dictatorship with high-tech propaganda.
[01:31:00.565 --> 01:31:04.248]  They fear themselves in the mirror that they see in Iran.
[01:31:05.010 --> 01:31:08.094]  Yeah, you look at Nasser in Egypt, they didn't like that.
[01:31:08.474 --> 01:31:13.300]  You look at the military government that preceded Saddam Hussein, the U.S.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:13.921]  didn't like that.
[01:31:14.321 --> 01:31:15.883]  But now she comes out and says it.
[01:31:15.923 --> 01:31:23.613]  She says, we want sanctions against Iran to protect the Islamic Republic and the rule of the mullahs.
[01:31:28.794 --> 01:31:36.617]  And that's clearly last summer's coup was really a bunch of the original revolutionaries the CIA clearly funded.
[01:31:36.797 --> 01:31:39.538]  Let's go back then Webster, let's go back in a snapshot.
[01:31:39.798 --> 01:31:42.058]  This is historical fact, a lot of people don't know this.
[01:31:42.499 --> 01:31:49.661]  Explain to people what happened, what really happened in 79 and flying, you know, the Kingpin in from Paris.
[01:31:50.021 --> 01:31:53.442]  Explain what that strategic Brzezinski model was really about.
[01:31:54.323 --> 01:31:54.703]  Exactly.
[01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.466]  That's what Hillary Clinton has shown, that the U.S.
[01:31:57.506 --> 01:32:02.212]  policy is to support an Islamic fundamentalist theocracy in Iran.
[01:32:02.252 --> 01:32:02.792]  The U.S.
[01:32:02.832 --> 01:32:04.494]  has always been the main backer.
[01:32:04.514 --> 01:32:06.036]  Look at who they put in Iraq!
[01:32:06.076 --> 01:32:07.558]  The women are now wearing the turbans.
[01:32:07.938 --> 01:32:09.260]  It's now an Islamic Republic.
[01:32:10.441 --> 01:32:15.145]  In other words, enforced backwardness and enforced self-isolation.
[01:32:15.506 --> 01:32:16.326]  1979 is simply this.
[01:32:16.767 --> 01:32:18.829]  The Shah has two sides.
[01:32:19.329 --> 01:32:24.214]  The Shah is politically a monster, of course, because he's got the sabacc, he's got this awful
[01:32:24.734 --> 01:32:25.616]  We're good to go.
[01:32:41.577 --> 01:32:42.557]  Urban mass transit.
[01:32:42.597 --> 01:32:44.618]  He's building a whole nuclear industry.
[01:32:45.218 --> 01:32:54.460]  If the Shah's plans had been allowed to go through, Iran would have been a nuclear power in terms of nuclear energy and probably more, you know, decades ago.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.960]  Wouldn't have never been an issue.
[01:32:56.401 --> 01:33:03.242]  And as soon as Khomeini came in, he immediately shut down $75 to $80 billion of these development projects.
[01:33:03.702 --> 01:33:10.724]  Among other things, they took the cooling towers of nuclear reactors and tried to use them as silos to store grain in.
[01:33:11.224 --> 01:33:13.665]  So this was a tremendous step backward.
[01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:15.647]  The other thing about the Shah that the U.S.
[01:33:15.747 --> 01:33:24.471]  objected to a great deal was that he was making deals not with London and Washington, New York, but he was dealing with the Italians.
[01:33:25.672 --> 01:33:33.056]  The Italian civil engineering companies were building the city of, well, today it's called Bandar Khomeini, but it was Bandar Abbas in those days.
[01:33:33.576 --> 01:33:39.717]  And the Soviets and the Japanese and everybody else was a welcome partner in Iran.
[01:33:39.737 --> 01:33:40.198]  So the U.S.
[01:33:40.238 --> 01:33:43.878]  said, no, we will not allow these other countries to come in and develop Iran.
[01:33:43.898 --> 01:33:46.579]  We're going to enforce backwardness on Iran.
[01:33:46.939 --> 01:33:54.441]  And so here comes the Muslim brigade they use against the U.S., they use against every other country, they use against the Serbs.
[01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.401]  They use them against the Russians.
[01:33:56.801 --> 01:33:58.442]  It's admittedly their creation.
[01:33:58.722 --> 01:34:02.923]  And Glenn Beck's saying we better give all our rights up or the radical Muslims will get us.
[01:34:03.343 --> 01:34:12.145]  And then meanwhile Bush, three years ago, puts out a press release at WhiteHouse.gov admitting that they're using Wahhabist Al-Qaeda groups to attack the Iranians.
[01:34:12.505 --> 01:34:17.406]  Meanwhile, the news says Iran is Al-Qaeda when it's Shiite, the opposite group.
[01:34:17.866 --> 01:34:19.726]  Yeah, it's an incredible mishmash.
[01:34:19.766 --> 01:34:22.467]  But the one constant that goes through it is
[01:34:23.047 --> 01:34:32.394]  Zbigniew Brzezinski said in 78-79, Islamic fundamentalism is our great bulwark against Soviet communism, meaning against Russia.
[01:34:33.015 --> 01:34:43.143]  Today, Hillary Clinton says the role of the United States is to interfere in the internal affairs of Iran with these sanctions because we want to protect the Mullah regime.
[01:34:43.183 --> 01:34:47.706]  We want to protect this domination, this theocracy in effect.
[01:34:47.726 --> 01:34:49.808]  What an incredible statement she's saying!
[01:34:51.912 --> 01:34:56.318]  I mean it's letting the cat out of the bag in a very, very gross way.
[01:34:56.338 --> 01:34:58.941]  I mean everybody in the world is noticing how bizarre is this.
[01:34:59.322 --> 01:35:06.451]  Now she may be saying that to try to make it easier for the Saudis to get into a war with Iran because she can say,
[01:35:07.012 --> 01:35:08.193]  You Saudis, don't worry.
[01:35:08.233 --> 01:35:10.974]  These are not fellow Muslims, even on paper.
[01:35:11.014 --> 01:35:13.275]  These are really military dictators.
[01:35:13.315 --> 01:35:16.857]  These are really communists or socialists or something like this, right?
[01:35:16.897 --> 01:35:20.699]  Like Saddam Hussein or Nasser or something like this.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.921]  So this is now the situation.
[01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:32.806]  So I would, once again, say the big shift is now we're back to the attack on Iran as a definite possibility in the short run.
[01:35:33.466 --> 01:35:41.935]  But now this is mainly against China, because if you're attacking Iran today, this is to cut off oil to China.
[01:35:42.035 --> 01:35:47.561]  Iran, I think, sends China about 11 or 12 percent of the oil that China imports.
[01:35:47.581 --> 01:35:49.823]  It's about $75-80 billion of development deals.
[01:35:53.627 --> 01:36:04.557]  But explain to me in globalization why they then give tax incentives to move all our businesses there, which select global corporations get basically oligopolies or cartels out of.
[01:36:04.577 --> 01:36:07.699]  I mean, what's the method to that madness?
[01:36:07.739 --> 01:36:11.763]  They give China all this power, but then on record are encircling them.
[01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:19.218]  The only way to approach it is that it's hopelessly contradictory because it's hopelessly irrational.
[01:36:19.298 --> 01:36:25.161]  So the bankers are greedy and want to go set everything up in China, but at the same time they want to cut their oil off?
[01:36:25.422 --> 01:36:35.528]  They want to have their cake and eat it too, and they want to make money individually off Chinese labor and Chinese economic development, but then at the same time we have this
[01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:39.611]  Well, hold on, plus that phase is over.
[01:36:39.691 --> 01:36:40.672]  China's done its job.
[01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.234]  It's de-industrialized the U.S.
[01:36:43.982 --> 01:36:47.225]  Yeah, well, again, nobody could de-industrialize the U.S.
[01:36:47.285 --> 01:36:48.305]  except the U.S.
[01:36:48.345 --> 01:36:49.966]  I'm putting that on the U.S.
[01:36:50.046 --> 01:36:51.047]  ruling class directly.
[01:36:51.087 --> 01:36:52.888]  No, I know, but that's what I'm saying.
[01:36:52.928 --> 01:37:07.038]  They partnered and set that up, just like they're plunging the euro today, and Goldman Sachs is in there sucking Spain and Greece and next Ireland dry, and they just move on as carrion birds from point to point.
[01:37:07.745 --> 01:37:13.748]  Yeah, look, the mood in Washington, I would compare it to Great Britain looking at Germany before 1914.
[01:37:13.868 --> 01:37:20.691]  At that time, you know, Britain was the dominant financial center, certainly with significant industry.
[01:37:21.092 --> 01:37:23.173]  But Germany was coming up really fast.
[01:37:23.333 --> 01:37:27.595]  And after the Boer War, in the 10 or 15 years before World War I,
[01:37:28.275 --> 01:37:29.535]  The British had a choice.
[01:37:29.956 --> 01:37:34.577]  They looked at Germany and they said, well, this is very rapid economic development.
[01:37:34.997 --> 01:37:36.378]  Do we want to match that, right?
[01:37:36.438 --> 01:37:40.739]  China's getting 8, 9 percent, 10 percent economic growth per year.
[01:37:41.119 --> 01:37:41.599]  The U.S.
[01:37:41.639 --> 01:37:45.100]  has 10 percent unemployment, officially, really 20 percent.
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:48.181]  And the Chinese have 10 percent economic growth.
[01:37:48.201 --> 01:37:50.342]  There's a poll today that, you know,
[01:37:50.982 --> 01:37:55.507]  Five out of seven Chinese think they're going to have more money in the coming year.
[01:38:08.942 --> 01:38:20.626]  That deterioration, that I think is why this attack on Iran is in many ways even more dangerous, because it is, right now it's an oblique attack, a proxy attack on China.
[01:38:20.966 --> 01:38:23.147]  But the thing with China is, the U.S.
[01:38:23.187 --> 01:38:25.748]  could say, alright, let's have a peace race.
[01:38:26.228 --> 01:38:28.989]  If China is building 21 nuclear reactors,
[01:38:29.509 --> 01:38:29.929]  We'll build 100.
[01:38:29.989 --> 01:38:35.090]  If they're building 18,000 miles of fast rail, we'll build 100,000 miles.
[01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:41.332]  But the parasite offshore bankers want all the money for themselves to go buy up third world countries.
[01:38:41.352 --> 01:38:43.832]  They don't want us getting jack squat of our tax money.
[01:38:43.932 --> 01:38:44.332]  Exactly.
[01:38:44.352 --> 01:38:48.813]  And then there would be a lot of people in Goldman Sachs would say that that threatens our money.
[01:38:49.313 --> 01:38:51.554]  So the bankers are worse than the commies.
[01:38:52.571 --> 01:38:52.791]  Yes.
[01:38:53.172 --> 01:38:58.697]  Again, I don't know what, you know, commie applied to China today.
[01:39:00.318 --> 01:39:05.524]  There are some, of course, but the economic process in general is not really communism at all.
[01:39:05.784 --> 01:39:11.509]  It's rather more like a derogism or mercantilism of a rather traditional type.
[01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:15.173]  But the big problem is the U.S.
[01:39:15.233 --> 01:39:17.235]  ruling class, they have a choice.
[01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:20.813]  You could have a peace race, and you could engage with China.
[01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:25.417]  Again, if you're concerned because you're falling behind, then match the Chinese.
[01:39:25.457 --> 01:39:26.278]  Here, an example.
[01:39:26.719 --> 01:39:32.344]  Before 1914, the British felt threatened by the growth of the German fleet.
[01:39:32.804 --> 01:39:37.249]  So every time the Germans would lay down the keel of a battleship and start building it,
[01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:39.070]  The British would lay down two.
[01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:41.091]  They call this two keels to one.
[01:39:41.491 --> 01:39:41.931]  So fine.
[01:39:42.312 --> 01:39:52.297]  If you're worried about China, have two nuclear reactors to one, two miles of fast rail for every one they build, and put twice as much money into your space program.
[01:39:52.337 --> 01:40:02.643]  I'd assume we're going to have the Chinese will be on the moon, and we'll be sitting here in poverty with credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and Goldman Sachs running the show.
[01:40:03.123 --> 01:40:04.363]  So the big problem for the U.S.
[01:40:04.383 --> 01:40:05.204]  ruling class is
[01:40:05.874 --> 01:40:26.505]  You've got to choose a peace race and come away from these stupid policies, because what they're doing now is saying, we'll foment war, we'll foment rebellion in Tibet, we're going to cause trouble with Taiwan, we're going to cause trouble in Xinjiang with this World Uyghur Conference, we're going to have a front to China, right?
[01:40:26.525 --> 01:40:29.467]  We're having the Dalai Lama here in Washington this week.
[01:40:30.007 --> 01:40:37.971]  And then we'll use Iran, as you can call it, the Iran monkey trap, because they think they've got China in a bind, right?
[01:40:38.051 --> 01:40:45.015]  China needs Iran, because they need that pipeline from Iran across Pakistan and into China, right?
[01:40:45.035 --> 01:40:51.618]  That's the long-term solution to China's energy problems, or at least a very large part of it, is to build those pipelines.
[01:40:51.638 --> 01:40:54.800]  So if you can break Chinese relations with Iran,
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:41:04.883]  They lose 10 or 12 percent of their oil now, 70, 80 billion of development contracts, plus hundreds of billions of future oil that they've contracted for, right?
[01:41:04.923 --> 01:41:05.943]  That could all be lost.
[01:41:06.443 --> 01:41:20.528]  And what Mrs. Clinton was doing in Saudi Arabia, she went there to get the Saudis to say, don't worry, Iran, we will give you the oil that you would have gotten from Iran if we put the sanctions on Iran.
[01:41:20.568 --> 01:41:21.748]  But it's basically a fraud.
[01:41:22.268 --> 01:41:25.850]  Okay, well listen, we understand the larger picture, and this is really excellent.
[01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:27.531]  I'm sure you do it as no one else can.
[01:41:28.671 --> 01:41:35.215]  How do they precipitate, how do they get the American people to go along with this attack on Iran?
[01:41:35.615 --> 01:41:46.340]  And militarily, we know Cheney, they wanted a two-month Sardi, thousands of flights, bombing the entire infrastructure, power plants, water treatment, factories, military bases, naval fleets.
[01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:51.643]  How do they get us to war, and what will the war look like?
[01:41:52.512 --> 01:42:00.521]  Well, even though during the course of 2009, one of the things we've seen is the return of false flag operations.
[01:42:00.721 --> 01:42:07.208]  We had Major Hassan at Fort Hood in November, and then we had the Christmas Patsy in December.
[01:42:07.308 --> 01:42:10.312]  And every time intelligence knows all about it and protects them.
[01:42:10.856 --> 01:42:11.256]  I don't know.
[01:42:31.048 --> 01:42:39.434]  The Westchester Patsies who are going to attack a synagogue in Riverdale and also an airbase a little bit north of New York City.
[01:42:39.454 --> 01:42:40.935]  So that has been building up.
[01:42:40.975 --> 01:42:43.977]  There's a big, big increase during 2009 compared to 2009.
[01:42:44.017 --> 01:42:44.838]  All right, stay there then.
[01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:48.541]  We're going to answer those two key questions straight ahead with Wes Griffin Tarpley.
[01:42:48.981 --> 01:42:49.841]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:49.862 --> 01:42:52.563]  We're going to answer how do they launch the false flag?
[01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:54.685]  What will the attack on Iran look like?
[01:42:54.865 --> 01:42:55.926]  What will the aftermath be?
[01:42:57.834 --> 01:43:00.115]  Our economy is in great distress.
[01:43:00.715 --> 01:43:03.596]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[01:43:04.257 --> 01:43:08.979]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen, and prepare just in case it does.
[01:43:09.779 --> 01:43:11.580]  You have auto and home insurance.
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.521]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:18.322]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:20.823]  Because it might take years to recover.
[01:43:21.604 --> 01:43:27.266]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[01:43:28.121 --> 01:43:35.446]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[01:43:35.466 --> 01:43:42.691]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[01:43:43.571 --> 01:43:47.133]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[01:43:48.054 --> 01:43:53.878]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:43:56.929 --> 01:44:00.574]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:00.955 --> 01:44:03.959]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.622]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.961]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:08.981 --> 01:44:15.262]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:20.423]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:20.584 --> 01:44:30.566]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:30.686 --> 01:44:32.787]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:33.027 --> 01:44:34.368]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:34.608 --> 01:44:36.909]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:37.069 --> 01:44:38.909]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:43.972]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.462]  Webster Griffin Tarpley will be with us about 50 minutes to the next hour.
[01:46:06.482 --> 01:46:08.303]  Then I'm going to hit some other key news.
[01:46:08.643 --> 01:46:11.885]  The Darwin Betaker from the Austin Gun Show is going to be joining us.
[01:46:11.926 --> 01:46:19.030]  They successfully, outside of law, shut down his gun show that had been in North Austin under other people for 18 years.
[01:46:19.050 --> 01:46:33.560]  Before we go back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, as we look into the crystal ball of what the globalists are doing, most of it publicly, and continue with false flag terror being reintroduced, these are just some of the books and videos we carry at Infowars.com, the online video bookstore.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:42.745]  How We Won the West, exposing the phony drug war, the 9th and 10th Amendment fight that's waking up the left to getting states' rights back.
[01:46:42.805 --> 01:46:43.665]  This film is excellent.
[01:46:43.685 --> 01:46:44.746]  I consulted on it and I'm in it.
[01:46:44.766 --> 01:46:46.386]  It exposes government drug dealing.
[01:46:47.047 --> 01:46:50.028]  We have this new book, Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies.
[01:46:50.448 --> 01:46:58.933]  We can't ship these until the start of next month, but you can get a $5 discount on the book and then get a free film of your choice at InfoWars.com with the book.
[01:46:58.953 --> 01:46:59.653]  A 1995 book.
[01:47:02.572 --> 01:47:05.014]  We've got all four of Webster's books.
[01:47:05.194 --> 01:47:06.755]  I've got three of them here.
[01:47:06.795 --> 01:47:08.235]  Obama, The Postmodern Coup.
[01:47:08.275 --> 01:47:08.496]  Excellent.
[01:47:23.168 --> 01:47:28.209]  Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, His 9-11 Synthetic Terror, and Surviving the Cataclysm.
[01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:31.250]  You want to have a deep knowledge of this stuff, I've read all these books.
[01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.990]  They are powerful.
[01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:37.172]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:47:38.132 --> 01:47:43.673]  Okay, Webster, you got cut off by the break, so I'm going to reintroduce the questions.
[01:47:44.473 --> 01:47:46.174]  How will they launch the war with Iran?
[01:47:46.994 --> 01:47:53.519]  We've got some of their public planning on how they're going to hit Iran, who will be involved in that, and what are the possible outcomes of it?
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.183]  Well, I think given the weakness of the U.S.
[01:47:58.223 --> 01:48:04.468]  and the general method of the people who are now in power, probably not starting with a direct U.S.
[01:48:04.508 --> 01:48:11.113]  attack on Iran, but through some proxy, and there, of course, Israel always comes into
[01:48:11.947 --> 01:48:14.089]  So you think the U.S.
[01:48:14.109 --> 01:48:15.570]  is the body and Israel's the tail?
[01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:16.991]  You don't think Israel's wagging the U.S.? ?
[01:48:33.448 --> 01:48:34.029]  Is one of them.
[01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:39.012]  But in this case, there's also a constituency in Israel to do this kind of stuff.
[01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:41.053]  But I think there's also an opposition.
[01:48:42.574 --> 01:48:46.097]  Let's keep that one as probably the leading example, right?
[01:48:46.117 --> 01:48:46.817]  So then the U.S.
[01:48:46.857 --> 01:48:49.319]  could say, why, this is a breakaway ally.
[01:48:49.399 --> 01:48:50.259]  We didn't do this.
[01:48:50.319 --> 01:48:54.442]  But now, don't you dare retaliate, because that would destabilize the nation.
[01:48:54.502 --> 01:48:55.863]  And they said that's the policy.
[01:48:55.903 --> 01:48:58.445]  They said, Israel, don't attack, but we won't stop you if you do.
[01:48:58.485 --> 01:48:59.345]  We're going to support you.
[01:48:59.365 --> 01:49:03.148]  And if anybody raises a hand, even block your attacks, that will be called terrorism.
[01:49:04.268 --> 01:49:09.210]  Well, the thing that there's been—the Israelis in the past two years have been told, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:12.231]  And now I wonder if that is changing behind the scenes.
[01:49:12.311 --> 01:49:14.972]  That's a big, obvious question.
[01:49:15.332 --> 01:49:21.154]  Otherwise, you have all of these Gulf of Tonkin false flag events of all different types.
[01:49:21.214 --> 01:49:25.555]  I mean, the entire panoply that we've discussed over the years comes into play.
[01:49:25.956 --> 01:49:29.837]  Let's talk about how you mobilize to stop this, though, because I think this is really essential.
[01:49:30.535 --> 01:49:51.631]  The first thing is, this Christmas Patsy story, right, the Umar Farooq Abdul Muttalib, this has fallen apart faster and more than any other similar case in recent years, because we now have the testimony, not of just anybody, but the Undersecretary of State
[01:49:52.347 --> 01:50:12.018]  Patrick Kennedy, undersecretary of state for management, that means consular services and visas, saying, we wanted to take his visa away, but there's this other federal agency that overrode it and said, no, we have a national security reason for you to keep the visa in his hands, because we're following him.
[01:50:12.279 --> 01:50:14.040]  We want to know what federal agency.
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:14.860]  We want to know who.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:15.761]  People.
[01:50:15.921 --> 01:50:16.341]  Names.
[01:50:16.861 --> 01:50:17.262]  Posts.
[01:50:17.662 --> 01:50:20.623]  Well, they said intelligence agency, so it's probably the CIA.
[01:50:21.564 --> 01:50:22.785]  Stay there, back in 70 seconds.
[01:50:22.805 --> 01:50:24.386]  With the final hour, Webster, we will continue.
[01:50:45.908 --> 01:50:49.891]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:50:50.011 --> 01:50:52.754]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:50:52.894 --> 01:50:54.856]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:50:54.976 --> 01:50:57.097]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:50:57.218 --> 01:50:58.739]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:50:58.879 --> 01:51:03.223]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:51:03.363 --> 01:51:05.725]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:10.569]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:16.651]  For your home or business, their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:51:16.711 --> 01:51:19.452]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:51:19.532 --> 01:51:22.153]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:51:22.253 --> 01:51:29.416]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:35.638]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:51:35.678 --> 01:51:37.939]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:51:38.519 --> 01:51:45.082]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:51:48.943 --> 01:51:50.864]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:51.344 --> 01:51:54.125]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:09.786 --> 01:52:12.029]  Here's the French news agency headline.
[01:52:12.349 --> 01:52:14.571]  Israel mulling a spring or summer war.
[01:52:14.751 --> 01:52:15.372]  Ahmed Dineshie.
[01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:21.998]  But in response, AP, Netanyahu, Israel not planning war with Iran.
[01:52:24.127 --> 01:52:26.048]  They continue to put out both stories.
[01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:30.552]  Webster Tarpey says it's now on the front burner and it's being green-lighted.
[01:52:31.532 --> 01:52:37.877]  Notice we hear the media saying it's been red-lighted and that Admiral Mullen and the head of the Joint Chiefs have said no.
[01:52:38.337 --> 01:52:47.184]  Webster, you were getting into false flag terror as the pretext, but how fast it's been exposed because the majority of the population knows about false flag and knows what to watch for.
[01:52:47.584 --> 01:52:49.426]  So continuing with how they
[01:52:51.035 --> 01:53:11.114]  Again, the thing that we have to mobilize on is we now have this testimony from the undersecretary of state of the United States saying we wanted to take the visa away and somebody came forward inside the federal
[01:53:11.869 --> 01:53:18.953]  The intelligence community, either law enforcement or intelligence, and said, no, he keeps his visa.
[01:53:19.273 --> 01:53:20.334]  He gets on the plane.
[01:53:20.414 --> 01:53:22.475]  In effect, we want the incident.
[01:53:22.515 --> 01:53:24.136]  Now, that's a string to pull.
[01:53:24.416 --> 01:53:28.199]  You pull on that thread, it leads you to the invisible government.
[01:53:28.239 --> 01:53:32.901]  It leads you to this honest-to-God rogue network, which is an empirical reality.
[01:53:32.921 --> 01:53:36.323]  It's not just some legend or myth or shadowy presence.
[01:53:36.723 --> 01:53:37.224]  Here it is.
[01:53:37.264 --> 01:53:39.105]  They're caught in the act, right?
[01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:41.251]  They're, you know, red-handed.
[01:53:41.652 --> 01:53:43.373]  So, this is the time to pull on that.
[01:53:43.433 --> 01:53:51.720]  Now, in that House Homeland Security Committee, one of the people leading the questioning, I think, is your congressman, Alex McCall?
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:52.681]  Is that his name?
[01:53:53.621 --> 01:53:53.901]  Yes.
[01:53:54.301 --> 01:53:55.722]  Yeah, he's right there in Austin.
[01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:56.943]  Now, he was interested in this.
[01:53:56.963 --> 01:53:59.364]  You had Benny Thompson of Mississippi, right?
[01:53:59.384 --> 01:54:00.324]  A black Democrat.
[01:54:00.364 --> 01:54:06.127]  You had a whole bunch of these people struggling, or pretending to struggle, I don't know, to figure out what this is.
[01:54:06.147 --> 01:54:14.891]  The members of the Homeland Security Committee, you can look this up on their website, those are the people you want to talk to about this, right?
[01:54:14.931 --> 01:54:17.993]  Plus, obviously, other people like, you know, Leahy of Vermont, right?
[01:54:18.033 --> 01:54:19.854]  The Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:28.980]  This is a big, big story, and you can see how afraid the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the TV networks are, because they don't cover this.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:38.547]  This is essentially a phantom story, which, you know, it's out on the Internet and different websites, but none of the mainstream media have it, because they're really afraid of this.
[01:54:39.768 --> 01:54:45.434]  Authoritative, conclusive testimony that this whole thing was a fraud, that it was staged.
[01:54:45.835 --> 01:54:49.819]  Now, the other side of it, I would say, let me appeal to people who are friendly to Obama.
[01:54:49.839 --> 01:54:51.621]  I'm sure there are some listening in, right?
[01:54:52.121 --> 01:54:54.564]  Or even, you don't even have to be friendly to Obama.
[01:54:54.584 --> 01:55:02.152]  You just have to be, you know, interested in the presidency or avoiding this outcome that we've been talking about.
[01:55:02.899 --> 01:55:06.422]  Obama needed to fire the head of the Secret Service.
[01:55:06.582 --> 01:55:13.207]  In other words, when you have three groups of people led into the White House, he's got to fire the head of the Secret Service.
[01:55:13.247 --> 01:55:15.769]  The name is escaping me right now, but it's easy to find out.
[01:55:16.410 --> 01:55:18.772]  And this woman, Desiree Rogers, right?
[01:55:18.812 --> 01:55:21.374]  The social secretary in the White House.
[01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:25.057]  I mean, her public pose is that she's a celebrity, right?
[01:55:25.097 --> 01:55:26.158]  That she wants to be a...
[01:55:27.078 --> 01:55:30.843]  Uh, you know, a famous person, and therefore she milks her job for that.
[01:55:31.203 --> 01:55:41.255]  But there may be something more sinister with her, so it would be good practice to fire her, because she's the one who keeps the list, makes the list of who gets invited to these White House events.
[01:55:41.876 --> 01:55:44.860]  And the head of the Secret Service, by all means, should be fired.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:56:03.889]  Generally speaking, Obama needed to fire people on January 4th, January 5th, when he came out with that stuff that Richard Wolff put on MSNBC, that the White House was considering that this Christmas incident was a staged, intentional incident with the alternative agenda.
[01:56:04.429 --> 01:56:07.412]  The only answer to that is heads must roll.
[01:56:07.732 --> 01:56:14.318]  You've got to start firing people, whether or not you know if they're incompetent or if they're in the rogue network.
[01:56:14.358 --> 01:56:19.103]  But if you find people who are party to this kind of a lapse, you have to fire them.
[01:56:19.383 --> 01:56:21.405]  So Napolitano needed to be fired.
[01:56:22.206 --> 01:56:24.207]  Probably Panetta needed to be fired.
[01:56:24.688 --> 01:56:26.750]  Dennis Blair, the intelligence czar.
[01:56:27.210 --> 01:56:28.610]  Certainly needed to be fine.
[01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:30.711]  Webster, final segment with you straight ahead.
[01:56:31.311 --> 01:56:35.212]  Separately, you have Jay Rockefeller saying Obama's not believable.
[01:56:35.712 --> 01:56:38.013]  You've got all these people throwing him under the bus.
[01:56:38.053 --> 01:56:43.394]  They've ridden this horse as far as they can unless they stage some attack on him.
[01:56:44.014 --> 01:56:46.114]  And I, again, see them preparing this.
[01:56:46.154 --> 01:56:47.775]  You agree it's a serious danger.
[01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:54.597]  I just think we really need to get out ahead of this because an attempted assassination will buoy him.
[01:56:54.937 --> 01:56:55.597]  We'll talk about it.
[01:56:55.897 --> 01:57:00.138]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:00.459 --> 01:57:04.540]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.260]  Number two,
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:10.204]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:10.544 --> 01:57:11.004]  It's true.
[01:57:11.285 --> 01:57:15.848]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:16.148 --> 01:57:16.709]  Number 3.
[01:57:16.989 --> 01:57:20.272]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:57:20.572 --> 01:57:24.315]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:57:24.495 --> 01:57:25.035]  Number 4.
[01:57:25.275 --> 01:57:27.657]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:57:28.038 --> 01:57:31.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:31.941]  Number 5.
[01:57:32.501 --> 01:57:36.424]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:57:36.644 --> 01:57:41.408]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:45.732]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:45.872 --> 01:57:47.433]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:57:56.345 --> 01:57:58.947]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:59.347 --> 01:58:04.311]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:04.671 --> 01:58:06.412]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:58:06.732 --> 01:58:11.535]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:58:11.736 --> 01:58:12.696]  How much do you want?
[01:58:12.916 --> 01:58:13.657]  When do you want it?
[01:58:14.037 --> 01:58:15.638]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:58:15.918 --> 01:58:16.739]  When will you need it?
[01:58:16.999 --> 01:58:19.061]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:58:19.201 --> 01:58:20.302]  Will there be any food?
[01:58:20.542 --> 01:58:21.883]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:58:22.063 --> 01:58:22.423]  If there's a
[01:58:22.483 --> 01:58:24.426]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:58:24.586 --> 01:58:27.129]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:30.514]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:58:30.915 --> 01:58:34.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:35.721]  How much will you need?
[01:58:35.962 --> 01:58:36.563]  We don't know.
[01:58:36.863 --> 01:58:37.784]  How much do you want?
[01:58:37.965 --> 01:58:38.706]  All you can get.
[01:58:38.886 --> 01:58:39.587]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:39.967 --> 01:58:42.728]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:58:43.028 --> 01:58:45.649]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:45.869 --> 01:58:46.670]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:55.879 --> 01:58:59.162]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[01:58:59.562 --> 01:59:00.223]  I'm Cramer.
[01:59:00.483 --> 01:59:05.287]  Money talks, and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[01:59:05.647 --> 01:59:12.192]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.
[01:59:12.452 --> 01:59:16.696]  And whether the market's up, down, or sideways, Jim's always hunting down a bull market.

[01:59:56.401 --> 02:00:01.505]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.786 --> 02:00:04.088]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:00:06.272 --> 02:00:12.055]  Okay, I want to try to cover a bunch of other little subjects here with Webster Carver before he leaves us.
[02:00:12.075 --> 02:00:24.660]  In areas of Australia, China, Italy, New Zealand, two weeks ago, and this came out in mainstream news, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com got banned.
[02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:34.745]  We had a Google shopping cart we'd launched, and they came and banned it, and said that it's advocating against a protected group.
[02:00:35.799 --> 02:00:40.663]  And the shopping cart we started with, I've only had a few of my films, and you know we're not a racial show.
[02:00:41.604 --> 02:00:44.366]  Even if we were, shouldn't we be allowed to sell things?
[02:00:44.426 --> 02:00:47.829]  Because then once you start that discrimination, it happens to everybody.
[02:00:48.689 --> 02:00:49.990]  We're all about bringing people together.
[02:00:51.071 --> 02:00:53.954]  And we got a direct letter from Google saying,
[02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:58.011]  Well, you can read the letter at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:58.031 --> 02:01:02.074]  Paul Watson's written an article, Google Bans DVD Critical of Obama Administration.
[02:01:02.694 --> 02:01:06.577]  Both the Obama deception and fall of the republic.
[02:01:06.637 --> 02:01:10.680]  We even, with other merchant accounts, went and set him up just with one video.
[02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:17.224]  And they sent us a letter and said basically no criticism of Obama because he's black.
[02:01:18.065 --> 02:01:19.166]  People get confused by this.
[02:01:19.186 --> 02:01:23.169]  I don't care if he's black, Chinese, Anglo-Saxon, Jewish, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:23.991 --> 02:01:24.791]  It's what he does.
[02:01:24.952 --> 02:01:25.532]  He's a puppet.
[02:01:27.353 --> 02:01:29.995]  And people get confused when I go over the math of this.
[02:01:30.315 --> 02:01:31.836]  Technically, he's 6% African.
[02:01:31.856 --> 02:01:36.739]  If you look at his eight grandparents, one of them was half African.
[02:01:36.799 --> 02:01:37.719]  So he's 6%.
[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:48.866]  See, so, I mean, because he's 6% black, you can't... You know, I mean, I sell videos exposing black genocide, how they abort more black babies than are born.
[02:01:50.504 --> 02:01:51.645]  Endgame exposes that.
[02:01:51.845 --> 02:01:54.888]  But it doesn't matter, even if I was bashing black people.
[02:01:55.108 --> 02:01:58.791]  I mean, every time I talk about Kool-Aid drinkers, that just means Jim Jones.
[02:01:58.851 --> 02:02:02.094]  I get news articles saying I'm saying blacks drink Kool-Aid.
[02:02:02.574 --> 02:02:03.975]  I don't even know what that means.
[02:02:04.336 --> 02:02:07.999]  It's like, you can't say government programs corrupt or you're racist.
[02:02:08.159 --> 02:02:13.664]  I mean, they're playing the race card as big city machines do.
[02:02:14.224 --> 02:02:18.267]  And we now see Time, Newsweek, all these other publications,
[02:02:19.321 --> 02:02:22.924]  Microsoft's head technology officer Bill Gates comes out and supports it.
[02:02:22.944 --> 02:02:24.005]  The UN supports it.
[02:02:24.265 --> 02:02:32.031]  Cass Sunstein writes papers saying at the White House we've got a restrict free speech ban criticizing man-made global warming.
[02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:36.674]  Newsweek comes out and says it's a conspiracy theory that ClimateGate never even happened.
[02:02:37.155 --> 02:02:43.039]  Webster, they are really moving ahead with Chinese style net censorship here in the West.
[02:02:43.079 --> 02:02:44.100]  Are you concerned about this?
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.921]  I wouldn't call it Chinese.
[02:02:45.941 --> 02:02:47.361]  This is American style.
[02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:49.082]  It's even worse, yeah.
[02:02:49.162 --> 02:02:51.182]  What you're pointing at, because it's more hypocritical.
[02:02:51.823 --> 02:02:52.623]  No, no, no.
[02:02:52.643 --> 02:02:53.303]  Let me stop you.
[02:02:53.343 --> 02:02:53.703]  No, no, no.
[02:02:53.903 --> 02:03:00.986]  They want a web ID to get online and then government indexes over cybersecurity that ban anything they want from any network.
[02:03:01.026 --> 02:03:01.286]  Go ahead.
[02:03:02.418 --> 02:03:03.298]  You were also on Russia Today.
[02:03:03.318 --> 02:03:03.938]  We played it here, yes.
[02:03:23.024 --> 02:03:23.765]  We're good to go.
[02:03:39.952 --> 02:03:45.314]  Right, and what people know as Google Earth was the CIA's Project Keyhole.
[02:03:45.334 --> 02:03:47.555]  So, uh, there it is, right?
[02:03:47.635 --> 02:03:51.156]  It's a... We'll go back over it, because what does this signify?
[02:03:51.456 --> 02:03:52.256]  The U.S.
[02:03:52.336 --> 02:03:54.697]  only censors when it's getting ready for war.
[02:03:55.538 --> 02:04:03.082]  Well, the hypocrisy of Google is Google says they object to Chinese censorship, but they are themselves an engine of U.S.
[02:04:03.142 --> 02:04:03.923]  censorship, right?
[02:04:03.943 --> 02:04:05.384]  They've done this now to you.
[02:04:05.784 --> 02:04:11.767]  I can also cite this instance of Sybil Edmonds when she was going to appear before the Congress to testify.
[02:04:11.827 --> 02:04:18.691]  Google shut down her blog, which she located on Google, because they didn't like the contents of it, right?
[02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:20.492]  Because it was a challenge to the official 9-11 story.
[02:04:21.733 --> 02:04:23.534]  And other whistleblowing themes.
[02:04:23.854 --> 02:04:33.519]  Notice how in China they might accuse you of anti-state activity, but in the United States you're accused of spamming, or you're attacking some protected group, right?
[02:04:33.559 --> 02:04:35.100]  Hate speech or something like this.
[02:04:35.561 --> 02:04:49.548]  But this is the essence of censorship, and people need to be aware that these companies, right, from Twitter to Google, that come on the scene as wonderful paladins of free speech, are in reality tools of the intelligence community.
[02:04:49.628 --> 02:04:50.229]  Thank you.
[02:05:06.081 --> 02:05:09.704]  That's one of the features... Let me just add, let me just add to interrupt you.
[02:05:09.724 --> 02:05:11.265]  Here's PC World today.
[02:05:11.666 --> 02:05:14.208]  Why Google has become Microsoft's evil twin.
[02:05:14.788 --> 02:05:19.352]  And then it goes on to say the backlash over Google Buzz reveals an even bigger problem.
[02:05:19.512 --> 02:05:22.314]  The people behind the search engine are deeply out of touch.
[02:05:22.714 --> 02:05:26.738]  So even mainline PC World is saying they are evil.
[02:05:27.198 --> 02:05:28.139]  We have the head of Apple.
[02:05:28.459 --> 02:05:32.282]  Jobs saying their slogan, don't be evil, is a joke.
[02:05:32.382 --> 02:05:42.829]  I mean, Webster, we are getting hundreds of emails a day with screenshots of Time Warner, Cox, all over the world, banning going to InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:05:43.009 --> 02:05:44.990]  Everybody needs to go do banner hangs.
[02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:46.651]  They need to support our sites.
[02:05:47.031 --> 02:05:50.554]  What is it that my sites are doing that has them coming after us, Webster?
[02:05:50.934 --> 02:05:56.376]  Well, it's a challenge to the mind control universe of these forces, right?
[02:05:56.436 --> 02:06:09.782]  And you can see that they feel that they've absorbed the Tea Party movement and that they've somehow brought that back under the control of traditional bankrupt Republican politicians, right?
[02:06:09.882 --> 02:06:15.484]  The pro-war, pro-globalist, pro-Federal Reserve Republican party.
[02:06:15.504 --> 02:06:20.186]  Palin is out supporting John McCain re-election, Rick Perry, all globalists.
[02:06:21.044 --> 02:06:25.005]  Yes, and therefore they say, well, that year we'll draw the line, right?
[02:06:25.045 --> 02:06:45.170]  In other words, we'll erect a border at the extreme of the Tea Party, you might say, that anybody who is not a warmonger, anybody who's interested in nationalizing the Federal Reserve, anybody who's interested in a bunch of other themes is going to be declared totally heretical and beyond the pale.
[02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:48.233]  That's it, because the core of the Tea Party is 9-11 truth.
[02:06:48.653 --> 02:06:49.574]  It is patriots.
[02:06:49.634 --> 02:06:51.595]  It's a true populist, diverse movement.
[02:06:51.976 --> 02:06:55.979]  They're scared to death of the real Tea Party, so they've got to shut down the real Tea Party.
[02:06:56.339 --> 02:06:56.480]  Right.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:10.612]  They would like to make this into a kind of Ross Perot movement that's just about exclusively concerned with taxes and deficits, right, and ignores the issue of the General Depression, and above all ignores unemployment, right, not interested at all in the question of
[02:07:12.134 --> 02:07:18.948]  So what do we do about the growing censorship and open calls and I mean I've read the cybersecurity bill on air.
[02:07:19.349 --> 02:07:22.576]  It's the total takeover of all infrastructure and open censorship.
[02:07:23.251 --> 02:07:26.733]  Well, the secret of the First Amendment has always been use it or lose it.
[02:07:26.753 --> 02:07:35.137]  In other words, the First Amendment lives through us, and it atrophies and wilts in any generation when people don't use it as vigorously as possible.
[02:07:35.197 --> 02:07:46.043]  So the idea is simply promote the kind of media that you represent and make that into a mass vehicle, right, a clearinghouse in exchange for all kinds of ideas.
[02:07:46.723 --> 02:07:53.926]  I don't think it's going to be possible for anybody to reimpose the orthodoxy on global warming.
[02:07:54.627 --> 02:07:55.807]  I'm sitting at home now.
[02:07:56.227 --> 02:08:05.792]  I've got snow piled up about five feet high in my front yard that I had to shovel off the driveway and the sidewalks over a period of several days.
[02:08:07.333 --> 02:08:11.658]  Global warming is pretty much a dead duck here in the Middle East.
[02:08:11.698 --> 02:08:12.619]  Let me stop you.
[02:08:12.859 --> 02:08:16.463]  Sure, Jones comes out and says we've been cooling since 1995.
[02:08:17.204 --> 02:08:19.446]  All the universities are caught in red-handed fraud.
[02:08:19.486 --> 02:08:21.048]  Pechari ripping everybody off.
[02:08:21.408 --> 02:08:25.493]  You've got the head climatologist at NASA saying we want to destroy industrial society.
[02:08:25.793 --> 02:08:27.075]  We have the UN saying it.
[02:08:27.655 --> 02:08:33.022]  Austin announces, we're gonna put 2.6 billion in energy taxes in the next three years.
[02:08:33.443 --> 02:08:35.125]  The whole city's going bankrupt.
[02:08:35.325 --> 02:08:36.687]  They're robbing everything.
[02:08:37.108 --> 02:08:40.432]  You say it's dead, but yeah, they don't care, Webster!
[02:08:40.692 --> 02:08:43.055]  They're just going ahead with it at the barrel of a gun!
[02:08:43.656 --> 02:08:51.183]  Well, activism is the only cure, and above all, the kind of activism we're going to need is some organizational form.
[02:08:51.943 --> 02:09:08.998]  If you look at the debate inside the Tea Party, the authentic people are the people who say, no to the Democrats, no to the Republicans, therefore we must consider a third party or something along these lines, independent of the bankrupt politicians of the current majority and the current minority.
[02:09:09.718 --> 02:09:24.311]  And therefore, I would urge people to think about this, too, because if you don't translate movement and ferment into an organizational structure that remains, that remains as a vehicle, then ultimately you're going to be reabsorbed, right?
[02:09:24.331 --> 02:09:25.952]  And Palin actually came out and said it.
[02:09:26.292 --> 02:09:33.759]  Palin said the Republican Party should absorb the Tea Party, and largely I think they've done it, although some people
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:35.981]  We'd like to break off from that.
[02:09:36.282 --> 02:09:49.656]  The people who would like to break off from the Tea Party, I think should now consider, along with others, right, open it up to people who are anti-war, open it up to people who are leftist, left of center, whatever it is, right?
[02:09:49.997 --> 02:09:54.342]  People, you know, if you're anti-war, anti-Federal Reserve, anti-globalization,
[02:09:54.842 --> 02:09:59.406]  I think that's a good basis for discussion, and then work out the differences on the other things.
[02:09:59.687 --> 02:10:01.808]  But you're going to need an organizational form.
[02:10:01.868 --> 02:10:06.793]  And again, the big question is, you can listen to Hannity, listen to Limbaugh every day.
[02:10:06.833 --> 02:10:10.937]  They say, we need the Republican Party, the Republican Party, the Republican Party.
[02:10:11.277 --> 02:10:16.802]  Anybody who is saying that, and simply leave it at that, I think is essentially giving people a bum steer.
[02:10:18.496 --> 02:10:31.432]  Well, I agree with you and there's no doubt we're going into very tumultuous times right now and all of our voices are more important and will be listened to more than ever right now.
[02:10:33.746 --> 02:10:42.751]  Again, we're being censored, we're being attacked, we're being hit from all sides, and it's because we have been effective here at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:42.771 --> 02:10:48.454]  We're a platform for Ron Paul and Webster Tarpley and Sheriff Mack and countless others.
[02:10:48.494 --> 02:10:56.138]  Sheriff Mack's in the New York Times saying he came on this show and it energized him nationwide for speaking engagements to thousands.
[02:10:57.839 --> 02:11:02.422]  From what we've built to all these different diverse ideas that are outside the very small cloistered
[02:11:14.637 --> 02:11:16.058]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:16.078 --> 02:11:16.358]  Bye bye.
[02:11:41.863 --> 02:11:42.284]  There he goes.
[02:11:42.324 --> 02:11:50.193]  Again, I'm going to come back in a few other news stories, then we're going to look at the 2nd Amendment attack that is going on around the country and a few other key news articles.
[02:11:50.253 --> 02:11:54.378]  But yes, Google admits no Obama deception.
[02:11:54.779 --> 02:11:54.939]  No!
[02:11:56.024 --> 02:11:59.207]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:11:59.567 --> 02:12:01.409]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:02.290]  Don't!
[02:12:02.730 --> 02:12:05.753]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:12:06.174 --> 02:12:13.300]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:14.942]  's number one debt secret.
[02:12:15.262 --> 02:12:18.926]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:12:19.326 --> 02:12:22.049]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:12:22.469 --> 02:12:29.496]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:12:29.836 --> 02:12:30.857]  Herb K was right.
[02:12:31.037 --> 02:12:34.120]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:35.221]  What have you got to lose?
[02:12:35.562 --> 02:12:38.705]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:12:39.265 --> 02:12:42.929]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[02:12:43.209 --> 02:12:43.549]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:12:43.569 --> 02:12:44.050]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:12:44.070 --> 02:12:44.110]  888-352-7726.
[02:12:55.791 --> 02:12:57.992]  Hi, this is Peter Krochnoble with Midas Resources.
[02:12:58.172 --> 02:13:02.854]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[02:13:02.934 --> 02:13:09.416]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[02:13:09.556 --> 02:13:11.977]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:13:12.057 --> 02:13:14.538]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[02:13:14.638 --> 02:13:19.599]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[02:13:19.799 --> 02:13:21.140]  Lose on your capital investment,
[02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:24.522]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[02:13:24.682 --> 02:13:30.866]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[02:13:31.026 --> 02:13:34.888]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:39.471]  Call me today, Peter Krochnay with 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:13:39.591 --> 02:13:44.675]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:13:44.715 --> 02:13:44.935]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:47.136 --> 02:13:49.779]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:13:49.799 --> 02:13:51.781]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:14:06.596 --> 02:14:09.257]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:14:10.017 --> 02:14:15.478]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:14:15.638 --> 02:14:20.679]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:30.822]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:14:30.942 --> 02:14:33.043]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:14:33.284 --> 02:14:34.624]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:14:34.885 --> 02:14:37.146]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:14:37.346 --> 02:14:39.167]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:14:39.467 --> 02:14:44.250]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:14:44.611 --> 02:14:49.394]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:14:55.774 --> 02:14:58.798]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:14:59.158 --> 02:15:02.763]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[02:15:03.064 --> 02:15:06.508]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:15:06.788 --> 02:15:14.258]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[02:15:14.258 --> 02:15:14.558]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:15:14.578 --> 02:15:15.559]  I mean, it's from municipal water.
[02:15:15.779 --> 02:15:23.684]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from the smallest to the largest systems.
[02:15:24.085 --> 02:15:27.867]  Big Berkey water filters .com has what you need with your system purchase.

[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:48.980]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.801]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[02:16:14.455 --> 02:16:20.880]  Well, there's probably 50, 60, I don't know, articles here I haven't even gotten to.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:25.164]  I'm going to try to put a few of these in right now.
[02:16:26.064 --> 02:16:28.466]  Coming up, uh, Byron Bedecker.
[02:16:30.648 --> 02:16:35.792]  I mean, I've got stories here, two of them today, without even looking.
[02:16:36.786 --> 02:16:42.791]  Where police are arresting people who are 50, 100 yards away, videotaping them, beating people up.
[02:16:42.811 --> 02:16:45.333]  They just come up and arrest you too and charge you with assaulting them.
[02:16:45.994 --> 02:16:47.355]  And charge you with wiretapping.
[02:16:48.155 --> 02:16:50.758]  Though there's no perception of privacy on the street, they know that.
[02:16:51.358 --> 02:16:51.979]  It's criminal!
[02:16:52.019 --> 02:16:53.000]  They're criminals, man!
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:56.943]  And if police say, a lot of cops tune in and say, well I'm not a criminal, okay, fine!
[02:16:57.223 --> 02:16:58.144]  Speak out against it.
[02:16:59.566 --> 02:17:05.111]  And you've got the cop in Philadelphia trying to fly his handicapped four-year-old son who can't walk.
[02:17:05.451 --> 02:17:09.754]  They make him get out of the wheelchair, make him take the wheel, the braces off, scream at him.
[02:17:09.995 --> 02:17:12.537]  The cop's all mad, saying, I'm a cop, you can't do this to me.
[02:17:12.897 --> 02:17:15.299]  Of course, they're going to steal your whole bank account, cop!
[02:17:15.559 --> 02:17:17.360]  The bankers don't care about you.
[02:17:17.681 --> 02:17:20.523]  You're with Alex Jones, whether you know it or not, and I'm with you.
[02:17:21.264 --> 02:17:23.225]  We don't have time to be idiots anymore.
[02:17:23.645 --> 02:17:24.906]  We're being trained how to be slaves.
[02:17:25.287 --> 02:17:27.829]  And then I see articles every day out of England and Scotland.
[02:17:28.715 --> 02:17:31.938]  Where any protest, any criticism of government, you get arrested.
[02:17:32.378 --> 02:17:33.700]  Here's one out of the Press Journal.
[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:36.302]  Sex abuse family, legal advisor arrested.
[02:17:37.263 --> 02:17:43.269]  And you read this article, the legal advisor, which is a part of the court in their system,
[02:17:44.659 --> 02:17:58.011]  Was gonna go downtown with the family and hand out flyers and they were arrested by the police and they said you're not allowed to hand out flyers in Scotland because the report is about police sexually abusing children.
[02:17:58.631 --> 02:18:02.575]  I mean, this is major news and they report it like it's normal.
[02:18:02.695 --> 02:18:05.277]  Oh, you don't have any right to any freedom in Scotland.
[02:18:06.898 --> 02:18:09.420]  And they're trying the same kind of stuff here in the United States.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.184]  I mean, I have stacks and stacks and stacks
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:19.582]  of similar articles where government is just going crazy and you know I talked about this some in the first hour.
[02:18:19.602 --> 02:18:20.803]  I've got to talk more about it tomorrow.
[02:18:23.424 --> 02:18:33.848]  The whole green fraud imploding as a way to steal property and tax people and control our lives and shut down industrial society they want to wreck you is coming out but they're not stopping.
[02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:39.011]  And then I've got home values plunging while sales taxes are going up in every state in the union.
[02:18:39.551 --> 02:18:41.932]  We've got in 41 states the lowest
[02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:47.512]  Two-year period for a drop in sales tax.
[02:18:47.572 --> 02:18:48.873]  That's a depression, folks!
[02:18:50.234 --> 02:18:52.015]  Jobs are being lost everywhere.
[02:18:52.315 --> 02:18:54.136]  Shops and businesses are shutting down.
[02:18:54.396 --> 02:18:56.938]  And Obama's answer is, we'll put more taxes on you.
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:02.181]  Meanwhile, the same banks are looting Europe.
[02:19:03.442 --> 02:19:06.945]  And the Spanish government is saying, intelligence-probing debt attacks.
[02:19:07.325 --> 02:19:11.848]  And then it turns out, this is in Reuters, and also on Telegraph, that Goldman Sachs is involved.
[02:19:13.226 --> 02:19:19.287]  I mean, it's come out they're involved in Iceland, they're involved in the U.S., they're involved in Africa, they're involved everywhere.
[02:19:20.307 --> 02:19:21.227]  This is criminal!
[02:19:23.388 --> 02:19:26.248]  This is absolutely criminal what's going on.
[02:19:26.268 --> 02:19:32.710]  Do you understand they're raising property taxes nationwide as property values go down?
[02:19:32.730 --> 02:19:38.851]  I mean, I know in reality my house has gone down by about 20%.
[02:19:38.891 --> 02:19:39.571]  Property tax went up!
[02:19:43.663 --> 02:19:49.530]  This is a lawless, criminal government that's here to rob you.
[02:19:50.231 --> 02:19:50.812]  Period.
[02:19:52.013 --> 02:19:53.836]  Does that mean every person in government is bad?
[02:19:53.956 --> 02:19:54.196]  No.
[02:19:54.276 --> 02:19:57.200]  But the system is run to steal.
[02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:00.504]  The system is a fraud and is illegitimate.
[02:20:02.159 --> 02:20:17.828]  They've been telling you the economy's getting great, as the joblessness explodes, as the factories shut down, as everything falls apart, as the roads collapse, as the railways collapse, everything's rotting, foreign banks are coming in, grabbing major roads, putting toll roads on it.
[02:20:18.089 --> 02:20:21.411]  They're squeezing, and squeezing, and squeezing.
[02:20:23.752 --> 02:20:26.594]  It just absolutely makes my head spin.
[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:37.909]  To see all of this happening and to know that in every major city, the UN openly comes in with Agenda 21 under UNESCO agreements.
[02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:41.032]  Incredible article at Infowars.com detailing this.
[02:20:41.552 --> 02:20:44.094]  Agenda 21 alerts sustainable development of the ruling class.
[02:20:44.935 --> 02:20:48.659]  I told people about sustainable development in the late 90s with the documents, they didn't believe me.
[02:20:49.636 --> 02:20:51.037]  They didn't believe that the U.N.
[02:20:51.077 --> 02:21:06.988]  was taking over national parks and buffer zones and not letting people have coal mines or gold mines or oil rigs or factories or businesses for hundreds of square miles around the 60-plus now World Heritage Sites and World Biosphere Sites.
[02:21:07.028 --> 02:21:10.291]  We've got, I guess it's more than that, you combine the two, here in the U.S.
[02:21:11.343 --> 02:21:15.244]  This is what the big banks have done in the third world, taking over land and receivership.
[02:21:15.585 --> 02:21:18.386]  And it's all done through fraud.
[02:21:18.486 --> 02:21:29.690]  My city is run by a bunch of lawless criminals, where foreign banks come in and steal whatever they want, and the government throws the book at the pathetic citizenry and then says, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:32.831]  And it's the same in almost every city.
[02:21:32.891 --> 02:21:33.571]  It's a joke!
[02:21:35.916 --> 02:21:42.102]  Then I've got articles where the Feds are paying to forcibly fluoridate all the major water supplies, which they admit gives people cancer and dumbs them down.
[02:21:42.603 --> 02:21:43.664]  It's insane!
[02:21:43.704 --> 02:21:44.485]  We'll be right back.
[02:21:46.047 --> 02:21:46.928]  We're on the march.
[02:21:47.428 --> 02:21:49.030]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:49.971 --> 02:21:52.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.489 --> 02:22:02.332]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:22:02.452 --> 02:22:04.433]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:22:04.553 --> 02:22:06.674]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:22:06.794 --> 02:22:08.314]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:22:57.107 --> 02:23:00.771]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:23:01.131 --> 02:23:04.153]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:23:04.374 --> 02:23:05.775]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:23:06.474 --> 02:23:09.155]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:23:09.915 --> 02:23:15.377]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:23:15.537 --> 02:23:21.079]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:23:21.099 --> 02:23:30.722]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:23:30.842 --> 02:23:32.943]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:23:33.183 --> 02:23:34.523]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:23:34.783 --> 02:23:37.044]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:23:37.224 --> 02:23:39.065]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:23:39.345 --> 02:23:44.166]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:23:44.506 --> 02:23:53.609]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:24:25.012 --> 02:24:34.298]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:24:34.338 --> 02:24:35.079]  This capitalism?
[02:24:35.139 --> 02:24:41.283]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:24:41.403 --> 02:24:42.244]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:24:42.284 --> 02:24:45.366]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:24:45.546 --> 02:24:46.306]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[02:25:01.176 --> 02:25:17.506]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:22.481]  We're going to shift gears and look at Obama with his U.N.
[02:25:22.541 --> 02:25:27.182]  treaty to go after our guns, what's happening in the Supreme Court, what's happening to gun shows.
[02:25:27.222 --> 02:25:29.762]  Darwin Betteker did get a new gun show site.
[02:25:43.485 --> 02:25:45.126]  It is filling up quickly.
[02:25:45.166 --> 02:25:47.667]  I think he said it may be sold out for tables.
[02:25:48.087 --> 02:25:48.948]  You can still come.
[02:25:49.408 --> 02:25:50.609]  Private sales, everything.
[02:25:51.069 --> 02:25:53.030]  I'm going to have my crew there Saturday and Sunday.
[02:25:53.050 --> 02:25:54.311]  I'm going to pop in a few times.
[02:25:54.331 --> 02:25:58.053]  I've got to spend some time with my family, but we hope to see everybody out there.
[02:25:58.073 --> 02:25:59.453]  We're going to Darwin-Bettiger here in a moment.
[02:25:59.753 --> 02:26:02.915]  I want to thank a few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[02:26:03.315 --> 02:26:06.517]  First off, FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[02:26:08.342 --> 02:26:09.783]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:26:09.823 --> 02:26:12.865]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:26:12.905 --> 02:26:20.669]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:26:20.729 --> 02:26:21.750]  Plus, if you act fast...
[02:26:22.927 --> 02:26:26.530]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:31.593]  I believe now is the time for you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:26:32.034 --> 02:26:36.277]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:26:36.297 --> 02:26:37.898]  They really are the best, folks.
[02:26:38.379 --> 02:26:38.959]  Check them out.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:41.301]  Go to frontsight.com today.
[02:26:41.341 --> 02:26:43.002]  That's frontsight.com.
[02:26:43.022 --> 02:26:46.805]  A lot of great free info as well and a free newsletter there at frontsight.com.
[02:26:46.845 --> 02:26:51.829]  And lastly, I want to thank the great folks at my
[02:26:53.695 --> 02:26:55.415]  Favorite place to get storable food?
[02:26:55.916 --> 02:26:57.916]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:26:59.256 --> 02:27:01.517]  You will never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:27:01.557 --> 02:27:09.778]  It's non-GMO, non-hybrid, they've got fully organic lines, they've got fully prepared meals, they've got everything, and it's all made monthly.
[02:27:09.818 --> 02:27:11.519]  It's not 10-year-old crud they sell you.
[02:27:11.799 --> 02:27:16.640]  I bought quite a bit of storable food and found out most of it was 10-year-old crud until I found eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:17.900]  And of course, they're the best.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:27.443]  After I did even more research, efoodsdirect.com, that's the letter, efoodsdirect.com, or bigfatmanners, up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, give them a call.
[02:27:27.883 --> 02:27:39.446]  If you can't go online and check out their awesome website with video, audio, photos of all the food, efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, your source for high-quality, storable foods, so you won't be dependent on the mega-government.
[02:27:47.139 --> 02:27:49.101]  Okay, going to Darwin Bedecker.
[02:27:50.342 --> 02:28:03.055]  This became a national story because a listener called me the Sunday that the show was their final day there and said they ordered him to post a notice saying no private sale of firearms.
[02:28:03.075 --> 02:28:04.436]  Well, there's no law against that.
[02:28:04.956 --> 02:28:06.778]  And the police lied and said, oh, we didn't do that.
[02:28:06.818 --> 02:28:09.261]  And later they said, yeah, we did order him basically to shut down.
[02:28:09.641 --> 02:28:11.543]  It was a nuisance abatement like a crack house.
[02:28:13.254 --> 02:28:15.815]  Then they had a staged arrest that wasn't an arrest.
[02:28:15.835 --> 02:28:16.735]  They let the guy go.
[02:28:16.755 --> 02:28:19.976]  Or they just put him in handcuffs and let him out.
[02:28:23.198 --> 02:28:30.320]  They told the media basically that Darwin was the previous Saxon, who were great people, who'd been there since the early 1990s, who they ran out of town.
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:32.341]  The biggest gun show in Texas.
[02:28:32.381 --> 02:28:36.662]  So TexasGunShows.net only has two shows in Texas.
[02:28:36.782 --> 02:28:38.203]  It's small, but a great outfit.
[02:28:38.956 --> 02:28:44.279]  They got, then after they stood up against them, H-E-B just said, look, just get out of here, your lease is over.
[02:28:44.719 --> 02:28:45.559]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:52.563]  And the B-A-T-F who ordered this and the police, them were more honest and said, yeah, the Fed said do this, we did it.
[02:28:53.399 --> 02:29:00.182]  So amazing, absolutely amazing that all of this has gone on.
[02:29:00.802 --> 02:29:08.285]  And the establishment tried to come in and get people to infight locally, to get it shifted off the story of the gun show that we broke, onto other issues.
[02:29:08.325 --> 02:29:09.025]  That hasn't worked.
[02:29:09.165 --> 02:29:12.787]  They were able to secure another great location, this time in South Austin.
[02:29:12.807 --> 02:29:13.887]  We're going to give you that address.
[02:29:14.448 --> 02:29:17.569]  And it's coming up this Saturday and Sunday in Austin, Texas.
[02:29:17.929 --> 02:29:20.050]  Darwin Bedecker, good to have you back on with us.
[02:29:21.381 --> 02:29:22.382]  Good to be back on, Alex.
[02:29:22.442 --> 02:29:23.282]  I really appreciate it.
[02:29:24.703 --> 02:29:28.885]  What's your general take on everything that's happened in this saga?
[02:29:29.485 --> 02:29:33.107]  And then bring us up to date on what's coming up this Saturday and Sunday.
[02:29:33.888 --> 02:29:44.213]  Okay, well, first let me start by saying I really appreciate y'all breaking the story and all your listeners have been overwhelmingly supportive.
[02:29:45.053 --> 02:29:48.195]  And I really, really want to thank everybody on your staff.
[02:29:49.028 --> 02:29:55.733]  For keeping in contact with me, and y'all have definitely been leading the fight to try to get us a new location.
[02:29:55.773 --> 02:29:58.955]  But we have been able to find a new location.
[02:29:58.995 --> 02:30:06.420]  Like you said, it's an old Target building with 110,000 square feet, so it's about three times bigger than where we were before.
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:11.604]  So there's plenty enough room to make it probably the largest show in all of Central and South Texas.
[02:30:12.565 --> 02:30:14.506]  And we'll be there.
[02:30:14.546 --> 02:30:16.067]  We'll be there this weekend, like you said.
[02:30:16.928 --> 02:30:18.529]  And we're just trying to get as many people out.
[02:30:26.754 --> 02:30:29.996]  Yeah, here's the key.
[02:30:30.236 --> 02:30:35.760]  They'll probably, because you talk about how they just walk in the back door like they own it, they're not allowed to do that lawfully.
[02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:37.982]  So we're going to have people watching those doors.
[02:30:38.062 --> 02:30:44.147]  I'm going to, as you've told me off air, no cameras are allowed but ours to try to control and stop any provocateuring.
[02:30:45.207 --> 02:30:57.175]  You talked about printing off a little leaflet to people that are doing private sales that you better ask for a driver's license under state and federal law, you know, to make sure they are a citizen, but it's a private sale.
[02:30:57.216 --> 02:31:02.519]  If they are able to push this through law, which they've tried, you won't be able to give your son or daughter a gun or your wife a gun.
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:04.761]  This is the so-called gun show loophole.
[02:31:04.821 --> 02:31:06.122]  Private sale, they want to shut down.
[02:31:06.142 --> 02:31:08.803]  They're harassing not just gun shows, but also
[02:31:10.264 --> 02:31:13.967]  Swap meets, bazaars, garage sales.
[02:31:13.987 --> 02:31:15.648]  This is a big fight nationwide.
[02:31:16.048 --> 02:31:33.580]  Obama has announced that on gun control, on amnesty, on open borders, on the green taxes, he's going to use executive orders and just, this is in the New York Times, and orders to the bureaucracy outside of law, not even executive order, to just do whatever he wants.
[02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:35.141]  And this is a test in Austin.
[02:31:35.541 --> 02:31:39.504]  So we've got to make sure that there's always eyes and ears there every month
[02:31:40.224 --> 02:31:41.645]  This is a major battleground.
[02:31:41.685 --> 02:31:43.467]  There's no doubt they're going to try to run you out.
[02:31:43.847 --> 02:31:51.313]  We need everybody to be there this month, next month, the month after, because this is a national fight with the BATFE.
[02:31:51.793 --> 02:31:55.996]  And so I'm going to have a crew there from the opening of the show to the shutdown each day.
[02:31:56.016 --> 02:31:58.278]  I'm going to be popping in as well.
[02:31:58.358 --> 02:31:59.559]  We've got tables up at the front.
[02:31:59.599 --> 02:32:01.020]  You've given us, we're very thankful for that.
[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:04.282]  Tell people the location, when it opens.
[02:32:05.543 --> 02:32:07.445]  Am I correct in saying you've sold out the tables?
[02:32:08.356 --> 02:32:08.757]  I don't know.
[02:32:08.777 --> 02:32:10.278]  We still have some tables available.
[02:32:10.298 --> 02:32:17.908]  Like I said, the building itself is 110,000 square feet, so if we ever did fill up the entire building, you'd be looking at about 1,000 tables.
[02:32:18.588 --> 02:32:26.318]  But we still have room for anybody else that wants some last-minute tables, and we'll find them a spot, definitely.
[02:32:27.168 --> 02:32:33.470]  And we need people there with books and videos and material, not just guns, to make this an educational experience.
[02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:37.091]  Again, we're going to be there, but very, very exciting.
[02:32:37.571 --> 02:32:43.653]  Now, the address is at texasgunshows.net, but give people the address who aren't on the internet.
[02:32:44.073 --> 02:32:47.654]  Yes, it's 6405 South IH 35.
[02:32:47.894 --> 02:32:49.915]  It's on the south side of Austin.
[02:32:50.495 --> 02:32:53.816]  It's exit 228, which is the William Cannon exit.
[02:32:54.571 --> 02:32:55.791]  And it's really easy to find.
[02:32:55.851 --> 02:32:57.952]  It's right behind the McDonald's right there.
[02:32:59.072 --> 02:33:00.273]  Absolutely.
[02:33:01.473 --> 02:33:05.134]  It's in South Austin, right off I-35, in the Target Center.
[02:33:05.294 --> 02:33:06.394]  Very easy to find.
[02:33:06.774 --> 02:33:08.315]  Give folks that address one more time.
[02:33:09.075 --> 02:33:10.355]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:10.955 --> 02:33:13.016]  It's 6405 South IH 35.
[02:33:13.676 --> 02:33:15.697]  I mean, it's really easy on, easy off.
[02:33:15.717 --> 02:33:17.817]  You don't have to go, you know, very far off the 35.
[02:33:18.097 --> 02:33:19.358]  It's right off the access.
[02:33:19.458 --> 02:33:20.938]  It's an old super target.
[02:33:21.633 --> 02:33:25.375]  Now what if folks want to call and book a table and can't get online?
[02:33:25.416 --> 02:33:28.157]  What's the phone number?
[02:33:28.798 --> 02:33:31.500]  It's 210-872-7469.
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:40.245]  And the other thing I was going to mention is, you know, we're trying to make this a record show, just to show APD that we're back in full strength.
[02:33:40.465 --> 02:33:50.292]  And if anybody that's listening, I know you have a lot of listeners that will not be able to make it to the show, they can still visit the website to buy complimentary tickets online.
[02:33:52.250 --> 02:33:57.475]  And again, you put all this advertising in when they shut the other show down.
[02:33:57.515 --> 02:33:58.796]  This has really set you back.
[02:33:59.337 --> 02:34:03.261]  So it's important, just like in 1776, to financially support.
[02:34:03.601 --> 02:34:05.243]  That's one of the biggest ways people can vote.
[02:34:05.683 --> 02:34:08.326]  You also have a petition on there.
[02:34:08.386 --> 02:34:09.547]  Tell folks about the petition.
[02:34:10.356 --> 02:34:28.711]  Yeah, we have a petition on our website that you can go on there and sign, and when we collect 150,000 signatures, which we're well on our way, we're going to turn that over to the Attorney General just to let them know that, you know, you have a lot of upset Americans, a lot of upset Texans, that, you know, they don't want you getting into their gun rights.
[02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:39.138]  And I want to warn the federal police force we have that masquerades as the Austin Police Department in violation of state law.
[02:34:39.859 --> 02:34:40.960]  I want to tell them something.
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:44.204]  And I know most of the police officers themselves are against what happened.
[02:34:44.924 --> 02:34:47.007]  But when I showed up at that protest,
[02:34:49.172 --> 02:34:50.974]  You know, not a rally, it was a protest.
[02:34:52.115 --> 02:35:03.106]  And when I showed up there and I saw police, and we have the video of this, we've been so busy we haven't posted it, up there with their sniper rifles on us and police in the windows taking photos of everybody, that made me angry.
[02:35:03.826 --> 02:35:06.109]  Now again, the average cop is against what's happened here.
[02:35:06.129 --> 02:35:09.312]  I know some police officers came with you, friends of yours from San Antonio.
[02:35:09.752 --> 02:35:12.855]  So we need police officers who've said they're going to support to come out as well.
[02:35:13.736 --> 02:35:14.517]  Oh yeah, I've seen it.
[02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:35.411]  He said it does look like harassment and intimidation, and if they do it again, it's clearly criminal.
[02:35:36.091 --> 02:35:37.432]  So, I want to warn them.
[02:35:37.872 --> 02:35:41.273]  Do not engage in the type of racketeering you've already engaged in.
[02:35:41.374 --> 02:35:42.514]  Don't try it.
[02:35:43.034 --> 02:35:50.077]  Because we're going to be there at the shows, other people are going to be there at the shows, when they drag somebody out for a fake arrest, we're going to document it.
[02:35:50.777 --> 02:35:55.099]  And they need to follow the law and not the federal government.
[02:35:57.276 --> 02:36:07.590]  Yeah, and the other thing I was going to mention is that, you know, a lot of people that haven't actually been to a gun show that want to see their rights protected, I don't want them to think that it's just guns, you know, that are being sold there.
[02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:09.172]  There's jewelry and
[02:36:10.021 --> 02:36:14.663]  Fine jewelry, guns, I mean, it's the right thing.
[02:36:15.263 --> 02:36:19.504]  Blow dart, guns that are fun, crossbows, archery stuff.
[02:36:19.524 --> 02:36:21.045]  What I love is the bird bombs.
[02:36:21.425 --> 02:36:24.666]  I don't shoot them at birds that are on runways, what they're meant for.
[02:36:25.006 --> 02:36:29.668]  I like taking them out to a pond and, I mean, it's a high-powered firecracker.
[02:36:29.688 --> 02:36:34.389]  A lot better one you can buy from a firework store and shooting them into the water and then you see the big flash underwater.
[02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:35.610]  A lot of fun toys.
[02:36:36.593 --> 02:36:37.615]  Yeah, no, they're a lot of fun.
[02:36:38.236 --> 02:36:42.261]  And I mean, it's a wide assortment of products that's going to be sold there.
[02:36:42.582 --> 02:36:44.525]  We're going to have book dealers there and everything else.
[02:36:44.545 --> 02:36:48.871]  And of course, you know, with y'all being there, it should be one of our best shows ever.
[02:36:48.891 --> 02:36:50.313]  I'm really looking forward to it.
[02:36:51.155 --> 02:36:53.939]  Absolutely, because, you know, I had Michael Bagnerica on earlier.
[02:36:53.979 --> 02:36:57.123]  He didn't even know that you guys had got another show so quickly.
[02:36:57.423 --> 02:36:58.885]  So a lot of people don't know.
[02:36:58.905 --> 02:37:06.054]  So it's important for all the activist listeners and people to understand that we're going to have a table there selling our books and videos.
[02:37:06.795 --> 02:37:08.998]  But really, that's just because my guys are going to be staking it out.
[02:37:09.973 --> 02:37:10.334]  I don't know.
[02:37:24.753 --> 02:37:25.433]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[02:37:25.473 --> 02:37:28.154]  And, you know, the other thing I was going to mention is,
[02:37:52.748 --> 02:38:02.153]  You know, the more people, the more people that show up and the bigger the crowd look, I think that the least likely that they'll try the same tactics that they did.
[02:38:02.674 --> 02:38:18.943]  It's only because, you know, we had such a small show and because of the recommendations we had to follow, that allowed them to come in and basically intimidate, you know, intimidate me by, you know, having such a small show where if there's large numbers there and a great turnout, I think that'd be, you know, least likely to happen.
[02:38:19.563 --> 02:38:21.785]  Well, the key is, Darwin, you got bushwhacked.
[02:38:23.789 --> 02:38:27.391]  Called in three days before the show and told this is the way it is.
[02:38:27.411 --> 02:38:31.194]  And they were so dumbed down they thought you were the last show they'd criminally run out.
[02:38:32.215 --> 02:38:38.639]  And now you're standing up and you stood up day one and had the petition there and that's why they punish you by shutting your show down.
[02:38:39.219 --> 02:38:47.105]  If we allow them to shut down commerce, Google has banned us selling on a Google shopping cart, Obama deception, fall of the republic.
[02:38:47.685 --> 02:38:49.666]  That story's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:38:50.327 --> 02:38:55.350]  They're trying to ban our commerce in self-defense implements, in freedom teeth.
[02:38:56.471 --> 02:38:58.313]  And this is how tyranny works.
[02:38:58.393 --> 02:39:01.795]  It tries to shut people down from their right to commerce.
[02:39:02.195 --> 02:39:13.063]  This is really a property, a private property, and a right to contract issue, and they want to keep this illusion going that it's illegal to sell your neighbor a gun, or illegal for a private seller to go sell somebody a gun.
[02:39:13.363 --> 02:39:15.024]  But when I went to the
[02:39:16.252 --> 02:39:18.794]  Impromptu demonstration at the police station.
[02:39:18.814 --> 02:39:20.716]  You know, I handed out hundreds.
[02:39:21.217 --> 02:39:33.267]  My dad showed up without me even knowing that he was coming handing out the law from the BATF's own website explaining it is not illegal to privately sell guns.
[02:39:33.287 --> 02:39:35.429]  But they got on the news and said it was illegal.
[02:39:36.370 --> 02:39:42.276]  Yeah, you know the thing that strikes me as strange is, you know, when the story broke and, you know,
[02:39:43.129 --> 02:39:45.371]  Your staff was the one that broke it.
[02:39:45.411 --> 02:39:52.535]  But, you know, all these TV stations and everybody in Austin, media outlets, they all wanted interviews and they all wanted to know what was going on.
[02:39:53.016 --> 02:39:59.360]  But, you know, now that we've found a new location, to me, I would think that would be just as big of news that we're actually back in Austin.
[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:07.145]  And, you know, nobody, you know, none of these liberal TV stations are calling one, you know, to talk about how the show is back on or anything like that.
[02:40:07.205 --> 02:40:07.946]  I find that strange.
[02:40:08.331 --> 02:40:18.073]  No, they just wanted to celebrate that they'd shut down Freedom in Austin, and now that it's back, they don't want people to know, but folks should call all those stations and invite them out.
[02:40:18.133 --> 02:40:19.734]  I'm sure you'd talk to them if they came out.
[02:40:21.054 --> 02:40:21.494]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:40:21.534 --> 02:40:22.134]  No, I talked to them.
[02:40:22.214 --> 02:40:22.494]  I did.
[02:40:22.554 --> 02:40:29.236]  You know, there at the rally, I talked to a few stations, and every one of them said, well, you know, definitely let us know as soon as you find a new location.
[02:40:29.616 --> 02:40:32.937]  And I've done that, and they, you know, they haven't really expressed any interest.
[02:40:34.946 --> 02:40:36.507]  Well, they want to do what they've done in the dark.
[02:40:36.887 --> 02:40:41.529]  I will say the CBS guy came up and said, Alex, I'm a listener of yours.
[02:40:41.609 --> 02:40:43.550]  Look, all I did was report what the police told me.
[02:40:44.031 --> 02:40:46.132]  And I gave him the law, and he did report it.
[02:40:46.192 --> 02:40:52.675]  So CBS did rectify some of what they'd done, but I still said, why do you just believe whatever the police tell you?
[02:40:55.657 --> 02:40:57.117]  I'm sorry, my phone was cut out, Alex.
[02:40:57.177 --> 02:40:57.938]  What'd you say?
[02:40:57.958 --> 02:41:02.180]  No, I mean, I just said to CBS, why do you just believe whatever the police tell you?
[02:41:03.188 --> 02:41:15.657]  Well, yeah, no, I mean, that's what I don't understand either because, you know, they're going to spend it, they're going to, the police are going to spend it in whatever way is going to seem more favorable, you know, for them because they don't want to admit that they came in and did exactly what they did.
[02:41:17.178 --> 02:41:21.841]  Well, you've also heard from a lot of police who go to church in our community, go to the grocery store in our community.
[02:41:21.861 --> 02:41:22.542]  They live with us.
[02:41:23.042 --> 02:41:24.443]  We're their fellow Americans.
[02:41:24.503 --> 02:41:25.544]  We're fellow Americans.
[02:41:26.545 --> 02:41:28.806]  I've heard from a lot of police nationwide and locally.
[02:41:28.846 --> 02:41:32.009]  You've heard from a lot, you told me off air, who are really upset about this.
[02:41:32.858 --> 02:41:33.498]  Very upset.
[02:41:33.658 --> 02:41:50.725]  And I've gotten a huge, huge, you know, supportive response from not just police, I mean, you know, from firefighters, from, you know, even a couple ATF agents themselves that, you know, said they were with ATF but didn't want to mention their name or anything.
[02:41:50.765 --> 02:41:55.487]  I mean, they even called up, you know, from out of state and everybody was real supportive.
[02:41:55.647 --> 02:41:59.248]  And, you know, like I said before, I totally respect the profession.
[02:42:00.036 --> 02:42:00.877]  You know, it's a tough one.
[02:42:00.897 --> 02:42:01.517]  It's a hard one.
[02:42:02.018 --> 02:42:07.362]  But, you know, when you have a few bad seeds, then it kind of overshadows everybody else.
[02:42:07.522 --> 02:42:14.627]  And as far as the department goes with those, I mean, I'm totally supportive of APD as a department.
[02:42:15.207 --> 02:42:25.475]  But, you know, when you have a few people out there pursuing their own agenda, you know, basically because they don't like guns, they don't want to have gun shows, and they're in a position where they can make it happen, it's not right.
[02:42:26.377 --> 02:42:27.418]  Well, it's very simple.
[02:42:27.538 --> 02:42:34.342]  When the police and the government become rogue, they become North Korea or Mexico or Communist Russia.
[02:42:34.983 --> 02:42:38.665]  And we have to keep government confined to its constitutional parameters.
[02:42:39.306 --> 02:42:43.949]  Let's come back with a few final important questions I've got for Darwin Bedecker straight ahead.
[02:42:44.129 --> 02:42:51.974]  Send a message to Obama, to the globalists, to the gun grabbers, that you won't let them illegally in the dark of night shut down a gun show.
[02:42:52.295 --> 02:42:54.776]  Show up this Saturday and Sunday in South Austin.
[02:42:55.917 --> 02:42:59.099]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[02:42:59.499 --> 02:43:00.160]  I'm Cramer.
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:05.222]  Money talks, and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[02:43:05.583 --> 02:43:12.126]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.
[02:43:12.386 --> 02:43:16.609]  And whether the market's up, down, or sideways, Jim's always hunting down a bull market.
[02:43:16.869 --> 02:43:20.051]  And now you can follow Cramer's portfolio at getcramer.com.
[02:43:20.971 --> 02:43:22.091]  Okay, here's how it works.
[02:43:22.472 --> 02:43:26.193]  Every time I buy or sell, I will email you ahead of time.
[02:43:26.413 --> 02:43:27.073]  Did you hear me?
[02:43:27.273 --> 02:43:28.113]  Ahead of time!
[02:43:28.453 --> 02:43:30.834]  It's like, if you can read, you can read my mind!
[02:43:31.094 --> 02:43:36.136]  My portfolio, fueled by my great research, is designed to deliver success.
[02:43:36.656 --> 02:43:39.777]  And I'll share it with you at GetKramer.com.
[02:43:40.268 --> 02:43:43.409]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:43:43.449 --> 02:43:45.650]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:43:45.710 --> 02:43:47.311]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:44:06.218 --> 02:44:08.879]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:08.899 --> 02:44:15.101]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:15.281 --> 02:44:20.303]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:20.823 --> 02:44:30.446]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:30.566 --> 02:44:32.687]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:44:32.927 --> 02:44:34.248]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:34.508 --> 02:44:36.789]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:36.969 --> 02:44:38.810]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:39.111 --> 02:44:43.893]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:44.233 --> 02:44:53.358]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:56.004 --> 02:44:56.884]  Global meltdowns.
[02:44:57.244 --> 02:44:58.265]  Massive unemployment.
[02:44:58.645 --> 02:44:59.445]  Endless wars.
[02:44:59.865 --> 02:45:01.125]  A new currency crisis.
[02:45:01.506 --> 02:45:03.246]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:45:03.586 --> 02:45:05.447]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:45:05.747 --> 02:45:07.367]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:45:07.647 --> 02:45:09.348]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:45:09.728 --> 02:45:11.308]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[02:45:11.708 --> 02:45:17.210]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:45:20.276 --> 02:45:20.856]  We're good to go.
[02:45:50.277 --> 02:45:51.746]  OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:45:52.129 --> 02:45:53.619]  OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:46:03.697 --> 02:46:07.280]  The story is only up at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.001]  Soon it'll be up on InfoWars.com.
[02:46:09.021 --> 02:46:11.243]  It's in the featured news section.
[02:46:11.703 --> 02:46:15.005]  Google Bans DVD Critical of Obama Administration.
[02:46:15.586 --> 02:46:16.466]  This is admitted.
[02:46:16.507 --> 02:46:18.088]  We have the letter from Google.
[02:46:18.488 --> 02:46:19.749]  We are being censored.
[02:46:20.409 --> 02:46:22.291]  We need the story to go mega viral.
[02:46:22.711 --> 02:46:25.133]  What they're doing, this is huge.
[02:46:26.134 --> 02:46:30.337]  I'm going to be using a YouTube format tonight to counter them on their own system.
[02:46:31.417 --> 02:46:35.221]  We need to not let them incrementally bring in Chinese-style net censorship.
[02:46:35.261 --> 02:46:37.123]  This story is so important.
[02:46:37.163 --> 02:46:38.264]  Please get it out to everyone.
[02:46:38.604 --> 02:46:41.407]  Google bans DVD critical of Obama administration.
[02:46:42.028 --> 02:46:46.953]  Same thing, Obama shutting down gun shows without statutory authority, outside the law.
[02:46:47.794 --> 02:46:52.539]  They're doing this on every front, and they told us it's because we're critical of Obama.
[02:46:52.639 --> 02:46:54.481]  That is not allowed.
[02:46:55.489 --> 02:46:57.411]  I mean, this is outrageous!
[02:46:58.191 --> 02:46:59.572]  This is outrageous!
[02:46:59.592 --> 02:47:04.797]  So get that story at PrisonPlanet.com, Google Band's DVD critical of Obama administration.
[02:47:05.037 --> 02:47:10.401]  Because it's going to be your site next, and when other sites get censored, and it's clearly documented, we come to your support.
[02:47:11.082 --> 02:47:12.703]  This is serious!
[02:47:13.584 --> 02:47:16.646]  I saw some COINTELPRO sites saying, oh, we're glad he's being censored.
[02:47:16.666 --> 02:47:17.367]  You idiots!
[02:47:18.167 --> 02:47:21.350]  Even if you hate me, it's Alex Jones today, because I'm big.
[02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:23.031]  It's you tomorrow.
[02:47:23.872 --> 02:47:25.173]  Same thing with Darwin Bedecker.
[02:47:25.213 --> 02:47:28.655]  I bet there's even a few greedy gun shop owners are like, good, we don't need one.
[02:47:28.675 --> 02:47:29.475]  We'll make more money.
[02:47:29.956 --> 02:47:31.977]  It's you next week, fools!
[02:47:32.517 --> 02:47:37.260]  Darwin, you know, the big threat is that they're going to use the U.N.
[02:47:37.300 --> 02:47:42.183]  treaty Obama announced a month and a half ago under treaty to start restricting the Second Amendment.
[02:47:42.543 --> 02:47:44.084]  They're beefing up the BATF.
[02:47:44.204 --> 02:47:45.605]  This is a key event coming up.
[02:47:45.905 --> 02:47:46.846]  Plug it one more time.
[02:47:48.807 --> 02:47:50.648]  This weekend, Saturday or Sunday,
[02:47:51.625 --> 02:47:52.726]  And it's a huge facility.
[02:47:52.886 --> 02:47:55.728]  Talking to you earlier, you said it was already real big.
[02:47:55.748 --> 02:47:57.889]  I mean, you've already sold a lot of tables, right?
[02:48:14.889 --> 02:48:20.254]  Yeah, we've sold a lot of tables, but like I said, I mean, when this place is full, we'll be able to put a thousand tables in there.
[02:48:20.674 --> 02:48:28.642]  So hopefully, I mean, here in the next couple months, when people see the support of Austin Heights coming out, that we'll be able to pull that off.
[02:48:30.029 --> 02:48:30.769]  Absolutely.
[02:48:31.270 --> 02:48:33.470]  And again, you vote by showing up.
[02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:34.911]  You vote by buying a table.
[02:48:35.351 --> 02:48:36.892]  You vote by coming to the event.
[02:48:37.752 --> 02:48:40.453]  And again, my crew will be there selling books and videos both days.
[02:48:40.633 --> 02:48:43.214]  I will be popping in on both days.
[02:48:43.254 --> 02:48:48.056]  I'm obviously on air Sunday evening, so I'll have to leave Sunday at around 2 o'clock or so.
[02:48:48.957 --> 02:48:49.677]  Breaking news!
[02:48:49.757 --> 02:48:51.017]  JP Morgan bombing.
[02:48:51.077 --> 02:48:53.218]  Bomb explodes at bank offices in Athens.
[02:48:53.678 --> 02:48:54.339]  This is from AP.
[02:48:55.419 --> 02:48:56.460]  The banks have been caught.
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:01.083]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, engineering what happened in Greece with their collapse.
[02:49:01.323 --> 02:49:02.444]  That's in mainstream news.
[02:49:02.724 --> 02:49:05.246]  And suddenly someone bombs them, but no one was hurt.
[02:49:05.846 --> 02:49:07.528]  I bet that's a false flag, but who knows.
[02:49:07.908 --> 02:49:16.014]  The blast occurred early evening Tuesday in an upscale area of central Athens following a warning telephone call to an Athens newspaper.
[02:49:16.434 --> 02:49:19.136]  Darwin, I'm going to be plugging throughout the week and again on Friday.
[02:49:19.156 --> 02:49:20.757]  We'll get a quick report from you on Friday.
[02:49:20.797 --> 02:49:21.738]  Pop it in for 10 minutes.
[02:49:22.518 --> 02:49:24.099]  It's TexasGunShows.net.
[02:49:24.199 --> 02:49:25.300]  I'll see you this weekend.
[02:49:26.141 --> 02:49:26.961]  Thank you much, Alex.
[02:49:26.981 --> 02:49:27.582]  You've been a blessing.
[02:49:28.342 --> 02:49:31.104]  You've been a blessing as well with your willingness to stand up to these people.
[02:49:31.244 --> 02:49:31.684]  God bless.
[02:49:31.704 --> 02:49:32.705]  Thank you.
[02:49:34.026 --> 02:49:46.174]  Now, in closing, we had the first radio interview I know of with the guy that died for 10 minutes when he had a heart attack a few months ago in a coma for, I think he said, 16 days.
[02:49:48.789 --> 02:49:50.613]  Michael Bagnerik was on in the second hour.
[02:49:50.773 --> 02:49:55.343]  Tarpley on the neocons saying 9-11 Truth is going to assassinate Obama.
[02:49:55.383 --> 02:49:58.129]  That's the big next false flag, I believe, once we expose it.
[02:49:59.318 --> 02:50:00.198]  And then Darwin Bedecker.
[02:50:00.218 --> 02:50:04.200]  That's all coming up in retransmission on your local AM and FM station that re-airs us when they do.
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:10.803]  Or you can always get the free podcast in the listen page on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:10.903 --> 02:50:17.226]  Or get the free iPhone app, one of the top apps now in the news section, and send to your friends and family.
[02:50:17.266 --> 02:50:18.407]  It's a call to action.
[02:50:18.847 --> 02:50:21.608]  Think of all your friends and family that have iPhones or Apple systems.
[02:50:22.008 --> 02:50:22.929]  Send them the free app.
[02:50:22.949 --> 02:50:24.729]  They can download it, listen on their cell phone.
[02:50:24.769 --> 02:50:25.490]  Sounds great.
[02:50:25.710 --> 02:50:26.530]  Works really good.
[02:50:26.610 --> 02:50:27.611]  Five-star ratings.
[02:50:28.711 --> 02:50:30.613]  Stand up against the censorship we're under.
[02:50:30.913 --> 02:50:33.614]  Every time we get censored, though, we just start new media operations.
[02:50:33.855 --> 02:50:35.316]  It's the starfish method.
