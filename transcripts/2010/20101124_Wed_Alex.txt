[00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.183]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.764]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:13.305]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:17.489]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:25.615]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:26.636]  Well, this is it.
[00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:28.597]  The day before Thanksgiving.
[00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.737]  The 24th day of November 2010, National Opt-Out Day.
[00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:40.990]  And we will cover all of the different political fireworks as they unfold.
[00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.296]  We've already had people stripping down into their Speedos with Screw Big Sis painted on their back.
[00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:51.619]  We had the first article on that at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com today.
[00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:55.222]  It's now become a big national news story as well.
[00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.103]  Very exciting.
[00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:59.366]  And I'm not tooting our horn that, hey, look, we had it first.
[00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.268]  We're continuing to drive the news.
[00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:10.045]  Like in the last six years, we've pointed out that TSA plans to be on the streets of America with naked body scanners.
[00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:11.667]  Now it's happening.
[00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:17.874]  Weeks after we've been beating the drum hard, The Hill newspaper, AP, Reuters, they're all talking about it.
[00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:21.578]  The alternative media, really spearheaded by the Drudge Report,
[00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:28.462]  Is now forcing all of this out in the open very very exciting and there's so many facets to it.
[00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:50.578]  I want to cover it Coming up and open the phones up and we have Joel Skousen popping back in already had him on once this week But I got him on for 30 minutes because of his deep research into the Korean Peninsula China using North Korea as a surrogate the United States and NATO using South Korea as a surrogate for conflict or as a pawn
[00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:57.541]  We have a representative coming on who's very upset, a member of Congress dealing with the TSA.
[00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:04.183]  And we have Webster Tarpley popping in to give us his view on the North Korea situation and what's happening with the economy.
[00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:12.485]  But all of our guests are just on for about 20 minutes apiece today, so we'll have time to also open the phones up and cover all of the other news.
[00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:16.547]  Obviously, amazing economic developments we're going to be going over.
[00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:19.848]  Also, going in at grocery stores, salons.
[00:02:21.068 --> 00:02:23.510]  All right.
[00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:46.987]  By the Feds, who are above the law and operate outside of common law, the Constitution, and Bill of Rights.
[00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:51.250]  That's exactly what's going on, so we'll be covering that report as well.
[00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.553]  But there's a lot of different facets to this TSA.
[00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:58.856]  There's the fact that if anybody else did this, they'd be arrested.
[00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.018]  There's the fact that they're not above the law.
[00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:03.500]  There's the fact that it's unsanitary.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.262]  There's the fact that it doesn't protect you.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.681]  And that the borders are wide open.
[00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.985]  There's the issue of all the scientific polls show between 60 and 90 plus percent.
[00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.746]  It varies against this.
[00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:18.147]  And I see that in public opinion on the street.
[00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:19.268]  Plus it's unconstitutional.
[00:03:19.268 --> 00:03:22.810]  So it doesn't matter if 99 percent were for this, you still can't do it.
[00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.031]  But it just so happens the public's with the Constitution.
[00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:28.053]  But we've seen this hoax from Ryan Williams on NBC.
[00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:32.796]  I was on Man Cow this morning, he was playing the clip of it, saying 98 percent in their poll agree with it.
[00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:38.080]  But all the other polls, like Zogby, are 61% totally opposed.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.983]  Reuters, 96% opposed.
[00:03:40.983 --> 00:03:44.907]  I mean, you know, I mean, you hear it on talk radio, liberal, conservative, doesn't matter.
[00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:48.770]  Almost everybody calling in, maybe 15 callers out of one.
[00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.537]  I was listening to local radio this morning, off and on all morning, and you might go 20 callers, because, you know, these shows are call-driven.
[00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.639]  I was listening to 590 to their
[00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.280]  Morning Show with Mark, Ed, and Sgt.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.164]  Sam, and then I was listening to the show came on after that, and they'd go 15, 20 calls for one person called in who agreed with it.
[00:04:10.164 --> 00:04:12.805]  And the people that agreed with it could hardly talk.
[00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:19.668]  They were just like, I think it's safe, you gonna let terrorists get, we gotta do, you know, it's like you go to the doctor and
[00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:27.917]  They touch you in ways you don't like to find out if you got p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p
[00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:46.207]  It's a lie that 98% of people agree with this, and we all know it.
[00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.468]  So that goes to the media.
[00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:52.975]  But I'm going to get into North Korea's situation first, the economy, then the TSA, your phone calls.
[00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:56.660]  It's all coming up on this Opt Out Day.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.462]  Maybe I'll cover TSA first when we get back.
[00:04:58.462 --> 00:04:59.523]  I'm pretty fired up about this.
[00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:00.004]  What about you?
[00:05:01.812 --> 00:05:05.833]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:09.074]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:13.855]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:20.257]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:22.498]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:23.338]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:23.859]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:24.499]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:25.180]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.321]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.932 --> 00:05:46.315]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:49.217]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:58.343]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:06:52.803 --> 00:06:53.624]  Thank you!
[00:06:59.943 --> 00:07:04.486]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:05.407]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.407 --> 00:07:08.829]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:09.690]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.573]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.573 --> 00:07:15.333]  It's true.
[00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:20.197]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:21.017]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:24.599]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:28.302]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.502 --> 00:07:29.303]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:32.065]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:35.748]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:36.549]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.549 --> 00:07:40.693]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:45.457]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:49.898]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.898 --> 00:07:51.679]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:53.940]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:02.043]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:08.685]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:11.666]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:15.677]  It is national opt-out day for many.
[00:08:15.677 --> 00:08:17.578]  For many others, it's no-fly day.
[00:08:17.578 --> 00:08:30.205]  AAA Motor Club estimates that there are going to be millions of additional cars on the road than what they saw last year because of surveys they've put out.
[00:08:31.254 --> 00:08:33.997]  To their members who are avoiding aircraft.
[00:08:33.997 --> 00:08:46.409]  So, you've already seen a nine plus billion dollar a year, the Department of Transportation estimates, decrease in tourism to this country, estimated to be 40 billion this year.
[00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:50.473]  Tourism is down by right at a third what it was in 2006.
[00:08:50.473 --> 00:08:51.274]  No one wants to come here.
[00:08:55.387 --> 00:09:12.041]  There may be a large percentage, I don't know if it's half or 40% of the public, but the polls show it's less than half, but still over 100 million people in this country that are wanting to be slaves, who are enjoying tyranny.
[00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:17.320]  But the rest of us are sane and recognize what this is.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.041]  And the rest of the world sees it.
[00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:22.061]  Meanwhile, who watches the watchers?
[00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.522]  The TSA people, the other airport employees.
[00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:28.583]  Why do we have all this just at airports?
[00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.564]  I mean, a terrorist could go in a shopping mall.
[00:09:30.564 --> 00:09:33.205]  A terrorist could go to a school.
[00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:36.566]  A terrorist could go to a hike and bike jogging trail.
[00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:39.066]  A terrorist could go to your church.
[00:09:39.066 --> 00:09:40.687]  Well, the federal government says that's right.
[00:09:42.268 --> 00:09:48.370]  And Big Sis is in the news today saying they do want body scanners basically everywhere.
[00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.950]  Just minimum wage people.
[00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.310]  This is the new economy.
[00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.031]  This is the new service economy.
[00:09:53.031 --> 00:09:59.373]  Prisons, surveillance, face scanning cameras, minimum wage goons.
[00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:01.113]  And I'm not against people that are overweight.
[00:10:01.113 --> 00:10:02.293]  I'm a bit overweight myself.
[00:10:02.293 --> 00:10:07.495]  But is it part of the TSA uniform that you've got to weigh 400 pounds and be pear-shaped?
[00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:13.232]  I mean, is that a rule that you have to look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man?
[00:10:13.232 --> 00:10:22.255]  I mean, if I went and applied and I only weigh 235 pounds, down from 265 a few years ago, I need to be about 200, and they said, sorry, Mr. Jones, you only weigh 235 pounds, you gotta put on about 160 pounds, and then we're gonna make you a commander.
[00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:31.859]  I saw another report I forgot to print.
[00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:35.045]  Will you guys print me the Atlanta Journal-Constitution?
[00:10:35.045 --> 00:10:40.737]  TSA employee kidnaps woman, attempts to commit suicide.
[00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:43.983]  I mean, I see these reports every few days.
[00:10:43.983 --> 00:10:46.584]  They're molesting some child or kidnapping people.
[00:10:46.584 --> 00:10:49.665]  He was a behavior identification specialist.
[00:10:49.665 --> 00:11:07.691]  These guys on power trips looking you in the eye like they've been, you know, given a degree by the federal government out of a Cracker Jack box now, and they're the great Carnac from the fame of the Johnny Carson Late Show, and they can magically tell.
[00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.832]  And I've seen their training manuals, they're public.
[00:11:10.832 --> 00:11:12.393]  Is someone sweating?
[00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:14.053]  Does someone look irritated?
[00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:15.134]  Oh, yes.
[00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:16.934]  You might have heartburn.
[00:11:16.934 --> 00:11:18.975]  You might have been rushing to get to your gate.
[00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:21.156]  You may be thinking you're about to miss your flight.
[00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:23.237]  You may have a crying child with you.
[00:11:23.237 --> 00:11:24.397]  You're sweating.
[00:11:24.397 --> 00:11:25.978]  You look upset.
[00:11:25.978 --> 00:11:28.079]  Oh, now we're gonna pull you out of line.
[00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:34.281]  It's part of this mass absurdist, mass delusion mental illness.
[00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:39.232]  That everyone could be a terrorist.
[00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:40.573]  It's the perfect enemy.
[00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:44.894]  This foggy, shadowy enemy that could never be defeated.
[00:11:44.894 --> 00:11:46.475]  And everyone is suspect.
[00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:51.737]  And total police state is the only thing that can keep you safe.
[00:11:51.737 --> 00:11:53.878]  And then meanwhile, it's the government staging the terror, of course.
[00:11:53.878 --> 00:11:55.898]  You ever think of that?
[00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:56.939]  Who's behind the terror?
[00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:57.959]  Who's taking your rights?
[00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.260]  Who stands to gain from this?
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.041]  And then when you go research it, guess who it is?
[00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:02.461]  Big Brother.
[00:12:03.697 --> 00:12:11.145]  Big Brother staging the events.
[00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:18.133]  And it says that he is a behavior detection officer.
[00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:19.594]  And generally, I've seen these guys.
[00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:21.016]  They're the ones staring at you.
[00:12:21.016 --> 00:12:23.238]  You gotta weigh 600 pounds to be one of those.
[00:12:23.238 --> 00:12:24.359]  It's kind of like a hierarchy.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:37.569]  Uh, they may actually start, like, having giant motorized tanks for these self-propelled stomachs, and perhaps they'll, like, roll in, you know, those folks that can't walk, maybe they weigh 1,400 pounds, and that'll be the head of the TSA.
[00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:39.871]  In fact, I think the head, nationally, shouldn't be pistol.
[00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:40.612]  I don't
[00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.291]  Prodding people, getting off on the power.
[00:13:00.291 --> 00:13:03.913]  I mean, they can't get a job at McDonald's, but now they rule you.
[00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:05.773]  And they don't care if you don't like the radiation.
[00:13:05.773 --> 00:13:07.514]  They don't care if you don't like groping.
[00:13:07.514 --> 00:13:12.436]  You quit, they hire somebody that does like groping.
[00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:22.120]  And I've flown so much and see TSA with their eyes all slit, looking at you, being all serious, shouting at people for, you've got more than three ounces of shampoo.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.881]  You've got a nail clipper.
[00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:25.562]  And I'm like, well, it says I can have a nail clipper.
[00:13:26.684 --> 00:13:30.387]  I mean, they're just there to let you know, hey, they've arrived!
[00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:31.728]  I have power!
[00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.269]  I have power!
[00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.969]  I'm God!
[00:13:33.969 --> 00:13:38.472]  I mean, this is the type of stuff they chant publicly in their mass delusions.
[00:13:38.472 --> 00:13:39.213]  But they're failing!
[00:13:39.213 --> 00:13:51.582]  They tried to intimidate, they tried to scream opt-out, they admit that they grope you to humiliate you, they've pulled off the urology bags, the colostomy bags, the artificial breasts, women who've had mastectomies from breast cancer.
[00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:58.451]  They've stripped the three-year-olds, and I heard local talk radio going, they've only searched about 12 kids just made up.
[00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:03.574]  I saw them search 30, 40, 50 babies when I was in Santa Rosa a month ago.
[00:14:03.574 --> 00:14:05.635]  Excuse me, San Jose.
[00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:09.237]  I was also in Santa Rosa, but I flew out of San Jose.
[00:14:09.237 --> 00:14:13.379]  That's all, all they were searching was women and children.
[00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:14.760]  That's all!
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.441]  Because they know they'll submit.
[00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:18.682]  They're getting their quota of slaves run through.
[00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:26.966]  All right, I'm already ranting, and I got a bunch of guests coming up, and I need to get to the news here.
[00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.346]  Let's just get into the news.
[00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:34.828]  Okay, and more of this is coming up with Joel Scalise and Webster Tarpley, and we have a congressman joining us as well today.
[00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:37.709]  China, Russia quit dollar.
[00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:41.711]  This is out of the China Daily, the big Chinese government mouthpiece.
[00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:41.911]  St.
[00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:45.712]  Petersburg, Russia, China and Russia have decided to renounce the U.S.
[00:14:45.712 --> 00:14:49.113]  dollar and resort to using their own currencies for bilateral trade.
[00:14:49.753 --> 00:15:00.958]  So, they've made the move, they've already been creeping away from the dollar, but to accelerate it, said the Chinese premier and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, announced late last night.
[00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:10.574]  Chinese experts said the move reflected closer relations between Beijing and Moscow and is not aimed at challenging the dollar, but to protect their domestic economies.
[00:15:10.574 --> 00:15:13.515]  Yeah, because the globalists, the fellow observers, are devaluing the dollar.
[00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:15.916]  People think of this as Russia-China against the U.S.
[00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:19.998]  They're certainly, you know, criminal organizations, by and large, as well.
[00:15:19.998 --> 00:15:24.320]  It's that the offshore corporate global government has been using the U.S.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.322]  as its engine and is now devaluing the dollar, which all these countries hold.
[00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:38.581]  And so they're just making the move to start getting away from it, which is a smart move because they're accelerating the monetization of the debt, the devaluation of it.
[00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:42.326]  The last people to figure this out will be American yuppies.
[00:15:42.326 --> 00:15:48.733]  That 6% or whatever in the real polls that are like, I like them sticking their hand down the pants, keep me safe.
[00:15:50.424 --> 00:15:52.985]  Chinese experts said the move reflected closer relations.
[00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:57.886]  The two countries were accustomed to using other currencies, especially the dollar, for bilateral trade.
[00:15:57.886 --> 00:16:04.007]  Since the financial crisis, however, high-ranking officials on both sides began to explore other possibilities.
[00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:10.969]  And so they say they're ditching the dollar for their bilateral trade of natural gas, raw materials, back and forth.
[00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:13.810]  So, big problems there.
[00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:14.950]  But the bankers don't care.
[00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:21.290]  They've got their power, and that's what matters, and they hate America, so this is a big, big enjoyment for them.
[00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.034]  List of problem banks grows despite solid net income.
[00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:25.735]  That's out of CNBC.
[00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.276]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:30.199]  Portugal, Spain hit by investor fears over debt.
[00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:35.625]  Yeah, the bankers are now getting ready to gobble them up, but they'll pose as the savior.
[00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:39.509]  Continuing, an Irish unveiled four-year plan to claw back $20 billion.
[00:16:40.783 --> 00:16:46.166]  Ireland plans to reduce spending by 20 percent, raise taxes, and rescue talks climax.
[00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:54.349]  Now notice, they mean cut spending for services and raise taxes to give everything to the bankers.
[00:16:54.349 --> 00:16:55.890]  They're not going to cut overall spending.
[00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:02.653]  They're going to increase spending, but it's just going to go offshore as government officials admit in Ireland.
[00:17:02.653 --> 00:17:05.694]  They say, oh, we think it's good that we're being taken over by foreign banks.
[00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:08.656]  Remember that Reuters quote yesterday that had me hyperventilating?
[00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:10.764]  This is treason.
[00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:12.786]  This is financial Armageddon.
[00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:14.988]  This is being conquered.
[00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:18.010]  So, that's coming up in the financial news.
[00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.192]  Everything, again, is accelerating.
[00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:21.754]  Now, here's the really big news.
[00:17:21.754 --> 00:17:25.938]  We're talking about this with Joel Skousa when he comes up here in about 15 minutes.
[00:17:25.938 --> 00:17:27.439]  The Washington Times.
[00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:27.739]  U.S.
[00:17:27.739 --> 00:17:31.563]  sends carrier to Yellow Sea for exercises near Korea.
[00:17:31.563 --> 00:17:34.446]  Now, they admit the whole thing that kicked off a day and a half ago
[00:17:36.104 --> 00:17:46.647]  Was US and South Korean forces in areas that North Korea claims, right up on their shore, firing artillery within just a few hundred yards of their shore?
[00:17:47.586 --> 00:18:07.446]  And the North Koreans, I'm not saying they're good, they're paranoid, lunatic, pure evil, but the globalists that are the more organized evil, they know what they're doing, and so they need this political diversion to prop up the dollar, a political diversion internationally, it's more of these proxy wars going on, and now they're going to send
[00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:15.992]  An aircraft carrier in to get right up against disputed areas, just begging North Korea to do something.
[00:18:15.992 --> 00:18:24.058]  And they may pull another Gulf of Tonkin, a 1964 style and claim North Korea attacked and go ahead and start a whole new war.
[00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:30.942]  We lost 56,000 Americans there in just a year and a half, almost as much as we lost in a decade plus in
[00:18:32.202 --> 00:18:33.964]  Vietnam from 64 to 75 or so.
[00:18:53.484 --> 00:18:59.731]  The exercise are likely to anger, which in the past oppressed Washington not to send its aircraft carriers to the sea.
[00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:01.914]  I mean, this could cause World War III.
[00:19:01.914 --> 00:19:04.176]  And I'm not the only one saying it.
[00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:10.564]  China may spurn Obama appeal to rein in North Korea after attack on the South.
[00:19:12.504 --> 00:19:18.586]  Continuing here, analysis, North Korea crisis, latest blow to Obama's nuclear agenda.
[00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:25.188]  Here's the London Telegraph, North Korea attacks, are we skipping towards a nuclear apocalypse?
[00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:28.729]  Pentagon, again to send aircraft carrier strike group to Yellow Sea.
[00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:35.651]  That's a Kurt Nemo story at Infowars.com, it gives you some background.
[00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:37.992]  I mean this is big news here!
[00:19:37.992 --> 00:19:38.792]  This is important!
[00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.231]  Meanwhile, our borders are wide open.
[00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:49.996]  We've got tens of thousands of hired minimum-wage goons fondling our wives and children and your husbands.
[00:19:49.996 --> 00:19:51.837]  Foreign banks have stolen trillions.
[00:19:51.837 --> 00:19:55.699]  Our entire economy is imploding into controlled, designed depression.
[00:19:55.699 --> 00:19:59.341]  The average yuppies watching football and sucking their thumb will be right back.
[00:20:00.891 --> 00:20:02.492]  Looking for the ultimate superfood?
[00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:07.295]  One that will give you lasting energy, improve your sense of well-being, and help you build lean muscle?
[00:20:07.295 --> 00:20:11.197]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder on the market.
[00:20:11.197 --> 00:20:14.418]  Virtually all other whey protein powders on the market are heated.
[00:20:14.418 --> 00:20:19.321]  This damages 15% or more of the proteins, making them unusable to the body.
[00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:23.843]  Fresh raw whey has been used for hundreds of years to alleviate many health problems.
[00:20:23.843 --> 00:20:27.746]  The life-giving properties in raw whey are now available in One World Whey.
[00:20:27.746 --> 00:20:30.147]  Whether you want to build immunity, strength, endurance,
[00:20:30.407 --> 00:20:30.667]  Let's go!
[00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:03.488]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:09.629]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[00:21:09.629 --> 00:21:10.389]  Don't laugh!
[00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:13.330]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:31.375]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:35.938]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.938 --> 00:21:41.742]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.742 --> 00:21:45.384]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.384 --> 00:21:48.106]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:53.169]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:21:53.169 --> 00:21:53.470]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.811]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.294 --> 00:22:05.257]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:06.257]  What have we got?
[00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:08.698]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:08.698 --> 00:22:09.719]  A republic.
[00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:12.360]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.621]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.642]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:16.642 --> 00:22:18.323]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:19.644]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:20.264]  Children?
[00:22:20.264 --> 00:22:21.385]  Our education?
[00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:22.185]  Our money?
[00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:25.867]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:26.227 --> 00:22:31.190]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.211]  We have the facts.
[00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:33.371]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:34.292]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:34.292 --> 00:22:35.172]  We have common law.
[00:22:35.172 --> 00:22:37.694]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:37.694 --> 00:22:41.476]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:41.596 --> 00:22:46.539]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.039]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:49.120]  Don't tread on me.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:23:00.486]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:23:00.486 --> 00:23:01.586]  Pure water.
[00:23:01.586 --> 00:23:04.308]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[00:23:04.308 --> 00:23:08.290]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season than Big Berkey WaterFilters.com?
[00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:13.158]  We're good to go!
[00:23:41.624 --> 00:23:42.444]  I read the news today
[00:24:10.447 --> 00:24:14.291]  We really appreciate DrudgeReport, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:19.336]  He first linked to some of our stories six, seven years ago, but now it's a weekly occurrence, now a daily occurrence.
[00:24:19.336 --> 00:24:23.560]  Because Drudge realizes it's important news.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.907]  Ron Paul, crotch-groped by TSA, calls for boycott of airlines.
[00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:36.377]  And it's got the video and audio link to Ron Paul with my quote.
[00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:39.402]  So to be clear, sir, you have had the enhanced pat-down.
[00:24:39.402 --> 00:24:41.405]  They have touched your crotch.
[00:24:41.405 --> 00:24:45.192]  Yes, absolutely, as I said, and it's disgusting.
[00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:52.075]  Let me go over some of the TSA news.
[00:24:52.075 --> 00:24:54.216]  That report, if you want to read it, still is on the Drudge Report.
[00:24:54.216 --> 00:24:55.637]  It's just moved down the page some.
[00:24:55.637 --> 00:24:58.838]  It's also up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:58.838 --> 00:25:02.961]  We have a great article up at InfoWars.com from Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:07.984]  TSA Gestapo empire that breaks down their total takeover of society.
[00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:15.817]  Because they're announcing they want them in taxis, they want them in bus stations, train stations, malls.
[00:25:15.817 --> 00:25:17.478]  This is the takeover of society.
[00:25:17.478 --> 00:25:19.679]  People are really starting to get it.
[00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:25.041]  Continuing, this is one of the biggest issues going on right now.
[00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:26.121]  Here's just the latest.
[00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:33.024]  LA Times reports on a Zogby poll, 61% oppose new airport security measures.
[00:25:33.024 --> 00:25:34.885]  They're worried about radiation,
[00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:38.823]  They point out our borders are open.
[00:25:38.823 --> 00:25:42.787]  They point out that there's a billion targets.
[00:25:42.787 --> 00:25:53.096]  I mean, if terrorists could just drive out in the middle of the countryside on a Sunday morning, walk into some Baptist church with 300 people in it, and blow the place up.
[00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:54.637]  Or shoot people.
[00:25:54.637 --> 00:25:58.821]  But the globalists really like to stage bombings because that creates fear.
[00:25:58.821 --> 00:25:59.882]  It's something different.
[00:26:00.709 --> 00:26:07.652]  And they've been able to do all this in airplanes because people always had common law for their cars, their homes, their persons.
[00:26:07.652 --> 00:26:09.633]  They would never put up with that on the street.
[00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:11.954]  So they started in the airport.
[00:26:11.954 --> 00:26:14.014]  Oh, because that's something special.
[00:26:14.014 --> 00:26:15.215]  That's flying.
[00:26:17.378 --> 00:26:28.026]  On the eve of one of the nation's busiest travel days, this was last night, a poll has found that 61% of likely voters oppose the newly enhanced security measures at the country's airports.
[00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:34.010]  And that's the Zogby poll of 2,032 likely voters.
[00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.273]  48% said they would seek alternatives to flying because of new measures.
[00:26:38.273 --> 00:26:42.015]  Now, I've seen other polls, again, of 96% out of 60 plus thousand respondents.
[00:26:46.061 --> 00:26:49.242]  I've talked about listening to talk radio to get a gauge of the public.
[00:26:49.242 --> 00:26:53.963]  I listened to probably two and a half hours of local radio this morning.
[00:26:53.963 --> 00:26:56.964]  I listened mainly to one station, listened to some to another.
[00:26:56.964 --> 00:26:58.884]  This was all they were talking about.
[00:26:58.884 --> 00:27:02.886]  I tuned into San Antonio radio, driving into the office, heard the same thing.
[00:27:02.886 --> 00:27:08.727]  Every caller, caller after caller after caller after, you know how mainline talk radio does.
[00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.368]  They'll just give each caller 30 seconds for a quick comment, hang up on them.
[00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:20.011]  Call her, after call her, after call her, and maybe every 10, 15, 20, you would hear somebody say they were for it.
[00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:27.574]  Meanwhile, NBC last night, Brian Williams, says 98% of people on their poll agree with it.
[00:27:27.574 --> 00:27:29.594]  Folks, there's no way that's true.
[00:27:29.594 --> 00:27:32.956]  And that's why mainstream media has lost so much credibility.
[00:27:32.956 --> 00:27:38.758]  They are attempting, with a straight face, to tell you 98% of people agree with this.
[00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:42.969]  But all the scientific polls are above 60%.
[00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:50.558]  And again, they tried to intimidate you.
[00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:52.160]  They tried to imply you were going to help terrorists.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.846]  They tried to yell opt out and admittedly groping you, they told Atlantic Monthly, to
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.060]  Make you go to the naked body scanners.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.662]  They tried to lie and say that scientists said the radiation was safe.
[00:28:04.662 --> 00:28:21.246]  When the entire spectrum of scientists, in government, at John Hopkins, she quoted, Big Sis quoted John Hopkins two weeks ago as saying it was safe, and then the head of the radiation department, the radiology department, came out and said it's not true.
[00:28:21.246 --> 00:28:22.867]  I've written papers saying it's bad.
[00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:27.288]  He was already in the news saying it was bad, so she just came out and lied and said he endorsed it.
[00:28:28.387 --> 00:28:31.069]  Because she thinks you're not going to go look it up.
[00:28:31.069 --> 00:28:35.671]  Remember just three weeks ago when I was the big liar?
[00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:40.254]  Three and a half weeks ago when Michelle was a big liar in my office about him touching her crotch?
[00:28:40.254 --> 00:28:44.476]  Remember TSA putting out press releases saying we don't do that?
[00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:47.338]  And the news was like, well we have all this video of you doing it.
[00:28:47.338 --> 00:28:49.119]  You did that to our reporters.
[00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:52.040]  Now you've got Wall Street Journal, New York Times, ABC News.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.822]  There's hundreds of mainline reporters going, yeah.
[00:28:56.172 --> 00:28:58.173]  They made me take my fake breast out.
[00:28:58.173 --> 00:28:59.273]  I had breast cancer.
[00:28:59.273 --> 00:29:01.154]  Yeah, they touched my crotch.
[00:29:01.154 --> 00:29:06.977]  Hey, they stuck their hand in my pants!
[00:29:06.977 --> 00:29:08.758]  And the Republicans, you gotta love it.
[00:29:08.758 --> 00:29:13.780]  I hear Rush Limbaugh and people trying to say, Mr. President, get your hands off my bag.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.681]  Off my tea bag.
[00:29:15.681 --> 00:29:17.661]  And I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what the media's covering.
[00:29:17.661 --> 00:29:18.942]  That's what Limbaugh's saying, okay?
[00:29:18.942 --> 00:29:20.803]  I'm reporting on him.
[00:29:20.803 --> 00:29:24.364]  And look, this all started decades ago.
[00:29:24.364 --> 00:29:25.425]  This is not partisan.
[00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:28.269]  But yes, it's accelerating under Obama.
[00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:30.230]  They're a bunch of control freaks.
[00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.272]  But, here's another poll.
[00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:37.094]  Majority oppose body scans.
[00:29:37.094 --> 00:29:39.416]  So, we're going to get back into all this and hit all the facets.
[00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:49.762]  And when we start the next hour, we're going to take 30 minutes of your calls quickly with your comments on the economy, on North Korea, on the TSA.
[00:29:49.762 --> 00:29:51.063]  Coming up, Joel Skousen.
[00:29:51.063 --> 00:29:52.444]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.444 --> 00:29:53.965]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.962 --> 00:29:57.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:04.439]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:30:04.439 --> 00:30:08.701]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:30:08.701 --> 00:30:13.523]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:30:13.523 --> 00:30:19.345]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:19.345 --> 00:30:26.388]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:34.666]  I'm looking for America.
[00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.288]  We're American and be proud.
[00:30:36.288 --> 00:30:38.430]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:43.536]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:30:43.536 --> 00:30:47.240]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:30:55.109 --> 00:31:00.513]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.

[00:33:24.026 --> 00:33:26.349]  50,000 unstoppable watts.
[00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:29.273]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:32.737]  Joel Skousen, no stranger to this broadcast.
[00:33:32.737 --> 00:33:34.860]  WorldAffairsBrief.com is coming up in a moment.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:40.226]  I don't normally have a guest on twice in the same week, but he's really been focusing on China, North Korea.
[00:33:41.127 --> 00:33:55.240]  That's what Lindsey Williams source told him a few months ago is where he should be looking that Iran was the distraction and we're going to get his take on this huge escalation and the announcement by China and Russia that they are dumping the dollar.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.482]  That is just huge.
[00:33:56.482 --> 00:33:57.663]  But before I go any further...
[00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:08.878]  A, the information and material covered on this syndicated radio broadcast, TV simulcast, the documentary films, the news websites, is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:08.878 --> 00:34:10.279]  We are reaching the most people.
[00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:15.142]  We are shattering the left-right paradigm, exposing these different globalist power blocks.
[00:34:15.142 --> 00:34:16.623]  We're having a huge effect.
[00:34:16.623 --> 00:34:18.905]  And people are ready to hear the truth now.
[00:34:18.905 --> 00:34:22.728]  We have the best activist-informed audience out there in the world.
[00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:24.830]  We are beginning to set the agenda.
[00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:28.893]  We, together, are beginning to put real issues out there in front of the people.
[00:34:29.653 --> 00:34:32.275]  And now is the time to redouble our efforts.
[00:34:32.275 --> 00:34:34.736]  We do this every holiday season in the last seven years.
[00:34:34.736 --> 00:34:37.177]  This is our seventh year doing this.
[00:34:37.177 --> 00:34:41.819]  Coming up early next year will be seven years of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:41.819 --> 00:34:44.061]  We have added special interviews.
[00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:46.842]  We fly all over the country to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:46.842 --> 00:34:48.543]  Two or three new ones going up a week.
[00:34:48.543 --> 00:34:50.824]  Dr. Blaylock is going up this week.
[00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:52.965]  A bunch of speeches I've given.
[00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:54.466]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, you name it.
[00:34:55.006 --> 00:35:13.134]  The simulcast of the show, the podcast in higher quality, commercial free, my book, Paul Watson's book, expanded extras from all my films, other films that folks call and contact us and want us to post in high quality, like Camp FEMA, Don't Tread on Me, thousands and thousands and thousands of pieces of media.
[00:35:13.134 --> 00:35:17.675]  Every subject out there under the sun at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:17.675 --> 00:35:18.556]  And every Christmas,
[00:35:20.114 --> 00:35:22.256]  You can get five months free right now.
[00:35:22.256 --> 00:35:25.940]  It's actually 5.3 months, is what it comes out to, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.743]  Instead of paying for 12 months, you pay for 6.7 months.
[00:35:29.743 --> 00:35:34.488]  You get 5.3 months free, and you financially support this operation.
[00:35:34.488 --> 00:35:36.930]  So we can continue at the same level and expand.
[00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.432]  We couldn't do any of it without you.
[00:35:38.432 --> 00:35:39.433]  And here's the best part.
[00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:40.854]  Give yourself a membership.
[00:35:40.854 --> 00:35:43.076]  Create a passcode, username, takes about a minute to do.
[00:35:43.757 --> 00:35:48.959]  And then you can have six people logged in at the same time on the same username and passcode.
[00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:56.141]  So you can share it and give it to a few friends and family and say, here's your membership, here's your username, passcode, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:35:56.141 --> 00:35:58.641]  Give it to them in an email or in a card.
[00:35:58.641 --> 00:36:03.243]  And any subject they want to look at, any expert, it is a library.
[00:36:04.048 --> 00:36:05.910]  And they can download it, burn it to disk.
[00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.391]  We've got tools on the site.
[00:36:07.391 --> 00:36:09.273]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:09.273 --> 00:36:11.055]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:11.055 --> 00:36:15.159]  Put fuel in our InfoWar weapon system.
[00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:20.805]  I describe it like a fleet of bombers that you are fueling.
[00:36:21.405 --> 00:36:26.947]  To go out there and expose the globalists and blow holes in their electronic Berlin Wall.
[00:36:26.947 --> 00:36:30.688]  So again, PrisonPlanet.tv, the perfect holiday gift.
[00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:32.029]  Also, we've got a bunch of specials.
[00:36:32.029 --> 00:36:36.610]  The Essential Alex Jones, my five newest and most powerful films, $24.95.
[00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.592]  That's less than $5 a piece, only until Christmas.
[00:36:39.592 --> 00:36:41.092]  InfoWars.com.
[00:36:41.092 --> 00:36:48.515]  If you've already got Police Day 4, Rise of FEMA, Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, Terror Storm, you know, things like that.
[00:36:49.454 --> 00:36:52.444]  Doesn't matter, get it and give it to folks!
[00:36:52.444 --> 00:36:54.390]  You have five powerful films.
[00:36:55.535 --> 00:37:00.138]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:37:00.138 --> 00:37:06.022]  You can also download them all in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv or write to us at P.O.
[00:37:06.022 --> 00:37:10.604]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:37:10.604 --> 00:37:18.529]  Got a bunch of other specials, t-shirts, bumper stickers, pins with Infowars.com on them, pocket knives with Infowars.com on them.
[00:37:18.529 --> 00:37:22.011]  Super inexpensive, it's all about spreading the word.
[00:37:23.092 --> 00:37:28.894]  Infowars.com for the online video bookstore shopping cart or 888-253-3139.
[00:37:28.894 --> 00:37:34.315]  Now we have a congressman coming up next hour who's angry about the TSA.
[00:37:34.315 --> 00:37:39.696]  Then we have Tarpley popping in later to give us his perspective on what's happening on the Korean Peninsula.
[00:37:39.696 --> 00:37:46.678]  But Joel Skousen is editor of World Affairs Brief, political scientist specializing in the philosophy of law and constitutional theory.
[00:37:46.678 --> 00:37:49.279]  He's also a designer of high-tech security residences and retreats.
[00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:50.599]  I don't know.
[00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:24.813]  Yeah, even before we had the works of the insiders admitting and confirming what Cleon Skousen said, like the author of Tragedy and Hope, of course, Bill Clinton's mentor, Carol Quigley, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[00:38:24.813 --> 00:38:28.454]  I wanted to get him on because there have been so many new developments.
[00:38:28.454 --> 00:38:30.055]  Just a recap for those that joined us.
[00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:32.036]  Yeah, Washington Times, U.S.
[00:38:32.036 --> 00:38:36.878]  sends carrier group to Yellow Sea for exercises near Korea.
[00:38:36.878 --> 00:38:38.979]  They're reportedly going to go into areas that are disputed.
[00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:40.600]  Again, a major provocation.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:49.484]  I'm no fan of the lunatic, hermit, hereditary dictatorship controlled by China of North Korea, but this is a provocation.
[00:38:49.484 --> 00:38:53.566]  China may spurn Obama appeal to reign in North Korea after attack on the South.
[00:38:54.306 --> 00:38:54.466]  I think?
[00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:20.244]  We also have the amazing China Daily, which is, you know, pretty much an authorized government front group for the Communist Chinese.
[00:39:20.244 --> 00:39:22.705]  Headline, China-Russia Quit Dollar.
[00:39:22.705 --> 00:39:26.108]  They signed the deal last night to start trading with each other.
[00:39:26.108 --> 00:39:31.651]  Natural gas and oil from Russia for raw materials and rare earth minerals and finished goods from China.
[00:39:31.651 --> 00:39:33.292]  This is a big deal.
[00:39:33.292 --> 00:39:36.534]  And it's right down Joel Skousen's alley with his research.
[00:39:36.534 --> 00:39:39.176]  Joel, we've got about 22 minutes left with you.
[00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.777]  Appreciate you joining us.
[00:39:40.777 --> 00:39:43.319]  Break down what you think this signifies geopolitically.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.421]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:39:45.421 --> 00:39:46.341]  It's good to be with you.
[00:39:46.341 --> 00:39:48.643]  Let me give some perspective to this.
[00:39:48.643 --> 00:39:54.167]  Since the armistice, you know, they're still technically at war, North Korea, South Korea.
[00:39:54.167 --> 00:40:02.353]  Since the armistice, there have been 150 acts of war on the part of the North Koreans versus the South Koreans, or U.S.
[00:40:02.353 --> 00:40:03.474]  Just a brief rundown.
[00:40:03.474 --> 00:40:07.918]  Three assassination attempts on presidents of state.
[00:40:07.918 --> 00:40:09.379]  Dozens of kidnappings.
[00:40:09.379 --> 00:40:11.861]  Three American soldiers killed at the border zone.
[00:40:13.172 --> 00:40:16.774]  Five ships attacked, including the recent patrol boat attack.
[00:40:16.774 --> 00:40:19.194]  Three airliners hijacked.
[00:40:19.194 --> 00:40:22.856]  Three artillery attacks on the South.
[00:40:22.856 --> 00:40:24.616]  Two missiles fired.
[00:40:24.616 --> 00:40:27.818]  Three American reconnaissance aircraft attacked over the years.
[00:40:27.818 --> 00:40:31.999]  These are occurring almost twice a year ever since this has happened.
[00:40:31.999 --> 00:40:34.820]  There have been four bombs planted in South Korea by the North.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.041]  There have been dozens of fishing vessels captured.
[00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:39.822]  The Pueblo!
[00:40:39.822 --> 00:40:40.722]  And then there's the U.S.
[00:40:40.722 --> 00:40:42.664]  Pueblo, which is the last one on my list.
[00:40:42.664 --> 00:40:43.564]  A major U.S.
[00:40:43.564 --> 00:40:47.726]  reconnaissance ship captured, never returned, crew imprisoned.
[00:40:47.726 --> 00:40:49.787]  These are acts of war and the U.S.
[00:40:49.787 --> 00:40:53.489]  has done nothing but pontificate.
[00:40:53.489 --> 00:41:04.535]  Now, this is, I gave his background because I want to say that even though these appear to be huge provocations, it is my analysis they will not amount to anything.
[00:41:05.385 --> 00:41:15.893]  In fact, I think that Lindsey Williams' source has been throwing out disinformation ever since the oil prediction, which was correct.
[00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:21.016]  They often do that, start with something correct and then start to do things which haven't happened or won't happen.
[00:41:21.016 --> 00:41:27.641]  Now, I'm not downplaying the fact that China is the big problem and North Korea is its lackey.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:39.108]  But I believe very strongly, strategically, that North Korea is being saved as a trigger event for World War III, something very big and much further down the line.
[00:41:39.108 --> 00:41:44.653]  In other words, this is, Iran is not a, how should I say, a diversion.
[00:41:44.653 --> 00:41:50.638]  Iran is the next country to be attacked, and you will mark my words, Alex, this will pass
[00:41:51.625 --> 00:41:58.856]  In so many words, and they will continue to placate North Korea for these egregious acts of war, do nothing to them.
[00:41:58.856 --> 00:42:00.278]  No regime change.
[00:42:00.278 --> 00:42:01.119]  No attacks.
[00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:02.801]  No retaliation.
[00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:05.165]  And North Korea will not in fact attack the U.S.
[00:42:05.165 --> 00:42:05.805]  fleet out there.
[00:42:06.437 --> 00:42:09.299]  But we will see a continual attack in the Middle East.
[00:42:09.299 --> 00:42:12.001]  Iran will be targeted sometime this year.
[00:42:12.001 --> 00:42:33.515]  To correct myself, because as I said it, I realized that it wasn't the full spectrum of what William's source, who he's now revealed, had told him, who clearly is an insider, that now Iran is on the map, but after that, to watch China and Russia, because they were the big players.
[00:42:33.515 --> 00:42:35.396]  Do you agree with what William's source said?
[00:42:36.397 --> 00:42:37.659]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:41.783]  As long as he's not saying that this is the immediate source, because it is not.
[00:42:41.783 --> 00:42:48.972]  That's what I'm trying to say, is that there's a pattern of permissiveness with North Korea that is just unexplainable.
[00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:51.835]  Vis-a-vis the way that we treat Iran.
[00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.256]  If Iran, I mean, the U.S.
[00:42:53.256 --> 00:42:56.557]  has been begging Iran to do any one of these things.
[00:42:56.557 --> 00:43:04.761]  Try an assassination attempt in Iraq, kidnap someone, have an artillery attack on Iraq, or a missile attack, or shoot down a U.S.
[00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:05.241]  aircraft.
[00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:06.002]  Could you imagine?
[00:43:06.002 --> 00:43:10.924]  We would be at war attacking Iran within 30 minutes if they did this.
[00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:17.322]  This would be God's gift to Obama, to George Bush, to give them an excuse to attack.
[00:43:17.322 --> 00:43:20.163]  And that just shows the hypocrisy.
[00:43:20.163 --> 00:43:32.206]  Iran is nowhere near the danger that North Korea is to the world with its weapons programs, with its proliferation of weapons, nuclear proliferation, its missile program, and yet we do nothing.
[00:43:32.206 --> 00:43:34.606]  In fact, we guarantee them no regime change.
[00:43:34.606 --> 00:43:36.667]  We guarantee no military interference.
[00:43:38.755 --> 00:43:46.341]  What was the 1988 event at the end of the Iran-Iraq war where, I've seen it reported, it's the biggest U.S.
[00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:54.668]  naval engagement since the end of World War II is how they bill it, where they destroyed a bunch of Iranian battleship.
[00:43:54.668 --> 00:43:56.850]  They called it Operation Praying Mantis.
[00:43:59.321 --> 00:44:03.225]  Yes, and it was very, very serious.
[00:44:03.225 --> 00:44:06.669]  At that time, of course, they didn't have the war on terror going on.
[00:44:06.669 --> 00:44:10.774]  They didn't have the provocations to be able to mount an attack on Iran.
[00:44:10.774 --> 00:44:18.022]  In fact, it was not anything related to the current war or current plans on attacking Iran.
[00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:27.075]  You know, we had the major shoot-down of one of the Iranian airliners at one time, too, which probably was, in fact, a mistake.
[00:44:27.075 --> 00:44:35.741]  But, you know, Iran, it certainly helped to inspire a great deal of hatred towards America.
[00:44:35.741 --> 00:44:40.425]  And I think that's what, in essence, the Iranian attack will become is
[00:44:41.085 --> 00:44:43.327]  Feeling the nail on the coffin of the U.S.
[00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:44.908]  as the bully of the world.
[00:44:44.908 --> 00:44:46.369]  We're going to look very, very bad.
[00:44:46.369 --> 00:44:51.713]  Israel's going to look very, very bad at attacking Iran and destroying a lot of infrastructure there.
[00:44:51.713 --> 00:44:56.757]  But I think we have to be very careful to take this in perspective, what's happening in North Korea.
[00:44:56.757 --> 00:44:59.459]  I mean, look at the wordage of the United States.
[00:44:59.459 --> 00:45:05.924]  You know, we are outraged, they say, and yet we must insist on a measured, unified response to the North Korean attack.
[00:45:05.924 --> 00:45:06.544]  And what do they do?
[00:45:06.544 --> 00:45:10.067]  They go to the Chinese and say, we want you to rein in your little puppet country.
[00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:11.973]  China does nothing.
[00:45:11.973 --> 00:45:14.615]  They never will do anything about China.
[00:45:14.615 --> 00:45:14.975]  The U.S.
[00:45:14.975 --> 00:45:18.276]  will never do anything about China's refusal to do that.
[00:45:18.276 --> 00:45:20.617]  Let me ask you this, Joel.
[00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:38.945]  Back in the mid-1990s, Bill Clinton gets the blame, and he deserves a large portion of it, for allowing Laura Allen Hughes to transfer the ICBM systems, the MERV reentry blueprints, but also the head of ABB, the Swiss company,
[00:45:40.117 --> 00:45:47.242]  Headed up by Rumsfeld, Donald Rumsfeld, transferring the reactor systems to them as well.
[00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:54.027]  So clearly, why did the West allow AQ Khan Laboratories to develop nuclear weapons?
[00:45:54.027 --> 00:46:03.434]  Why did England, the United States, and Israel, to some extent, help give nukes to Pakistan, help give nukes to North Korea, but then freak out over Iran?
[00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:10.344]  Well, as I say, this is our terrorists versus the ones that aren't in our control.
[00:46:10.344 --> 00:46:17.007]  The ones that we want to use for provocations of World War III, and I think there is a very long-term process involved in this.
[00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:21.028]  I mean, we know, for example, that part of the con-nuclear
[00:46:23.732 --> 00:46:37.096]  The spying ring was instrumental in giving Iran their start in their nuclear program, and they in fact gave them, according to the CIA, this may be disinformation, flawed plans that wouldn't work, in fact.
[00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:37.677]  But the U.S.
[00:46:37.677 --> 00:46:43.959]  has very much to do with getting Iranian programs started in nuclear war, of course, with Pakistan as well.
[00:46:43.959 --> 00:46:48.740]  I think we're looking at some very sophisticated levels of conflict creation here.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.641]  The entire Pakistani
[00:46:53.022 --> 00:46:54.204]  I think so.
[00:47:07.486 --> 00:47:11.149]  India was a client state of Russia for many years, and now it's starting to trend.
[00:47:11.149 --> 00:47:16.833]  The West is trying to woo India away from Russia's field of influence.
[00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:20.515]  Pakistan for years was a client state of China, and the U.S.
[00:47:20.515 --> 00:47:25.359]  successfully wooed China away specifically over the nuclear program.
[00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:29.382]  China was not giving nuclear weapons to Pakistan, and the U.S.
[00:47:29.382 --> 00:47:31.083]  came in through a kickoff and did it.
[00:47:31.603 --> 00:47:39.325]  And that's what got all of the Pakistani elite in the ISI and the controllers in the military tied to the U.S.
[00:47:39.325 --> 00:47:41.125]  They've been tied there ever since.
[00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:51.747]  There's still a T2T going on between China trying to woo back Pakistan, but I'm not sure exactly how this is going to play out in the world war.
[00:47:51.747 --> 00:47:56.428]  I know that when it finally launched, China's very, very worried about
[00:47:58.582 --> 00:48:00.164]  India being in his backyard.
[00:48:00.164 --> 00:48:06.690]  I mean, India's got as many potential soldiers as China does and probably capable of better training.
[00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:10.893]  So if that turns on China at some point, they could be in trouble.
[00:48:10.893 --> 00:48:15.418]  So they're very, very interested in keeping hold of India and Pakistan.
[00:48:15.418 --> 00:48:16.358]  They've lost Pakistan.
[00:48:16.358 --> 00:48:17.840]  I don't think that'll ever come back again.
[00:48:19.033 --> 00:48:24.414]  Except as a means of undermining India.
[00:48:24.414 --> 00:48:26.695]  And that's the counterpoint there.
[00:48:26.695 --> 00:48:36.457]  If India, as you know, let me just go back, China is presently allied with Russia in their plans on attacking the West someday.
[00:48:36.457 --> 00:48:45.119]  But China knows very well that they'll have to fight Russia and break their bonds just like Russia and Hitler had to finally fight it out.
[00:48:45.951 --> 00:48:59.363]  So China's very, very worried about Russian influence in India, and that's the reason why they took so much time to try to give arms and munitions and aid to Pakistan so that they could have a counterpoint against India.
[00:48:59.363 --> 00:48:59.904]  The U.S.
[00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:08.311]  has played into this by giving Pakistan nuclear weapons, knowing that Russia had given India nuclear weapons.
[00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:08.732]  The U.S.
[00:49:08.732 --> 00:49:12.095]  gave nuclear weapons to Pakistan in order to help the Chinese.
[00:49:12.715 --> 00:49:18.640]  In their feeling of being able to counter Indian military influence.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:24.305]  So I think this is part of the ploy of the West of playing into China's back pocket.
[00:49:24.305 --> 00:49:34.153]  In other words, we're helping you out, we're transferring technology, we're not trying to do it openly, we're playing like, you know, I mean even the Pentagon every year has this
[00:49:35.663 --> 00:49:42.425]  Well, isn't this just a replay of the West building up Japan and enticing them to expand all over the Pacific before World War II?
[00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:02.341]  Yeah, I think it is.
[00:50:02.341 --> 00:50:04.942]  I think China's going to play that same role in World War III.
[00:50:04.942 --> 00:50:07.063]  They're going to tie up the entire Pacific.
[00:50:07.063 --> 00:50:09.023]  They've got a grudge match with Japan.
[00:50:09.023 --> 00:50:14.445]  They're going to take Japan all the way down to and including Australia and New Zealand.
[00:50:14.445 --> 00:50:18.426]  And that's why I don't recommend... Well, can you imagine, though, what's going to happen?
[00:50:18.426 --> 00:50:21.407]  You want to see terrorism, as they call it.
[00:50:21.407 --> 00:50:22.427]  That's anybody that resists.
[00:50:22.427 --> 00:50:27.709]  Can you imagine what the Japanese are going to do if the Chinese actually try to physically take Japan?
[00:50:30.484 --> 00:50:33.527]  Well, I think they will at least neutralize it.
[00:50:33.527 --> 00:50:36.530]  I mean, you know, the Chinese really don't have a great deal of military.
[00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.012]  They've been dependent on the U.S.
[00:50:38.012 --> 00:50:39.313]  for so many years.
[00:50:39.313 --> 00:50:40.174]  No, no, I understand.
[00:50:40.174 --> 00:50:45.220]  I'm talking about just the asymmetrical on the ground, what the Japanese will do once the Chinese visit.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.222]  But they may just run them through a puppet, too.
[00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:49.971]  Yeah, they could do that too.
[00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:50.811]  All right, Joel, stay there.
[00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:57.214]  I want to shift gears and see where you see this going in the long term, but also looking at what's happening in Afghanistan.
[00:50:57.214 --> 00:50:58.434]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:50:58.434 --> 00:51:01.515]  Afghan violence soars, insurgency expanding.
[00:51:01.515 --> 00:51:06.197]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:06.197 --> 00:51:10.699]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[00:51:59.324 --> 00:52:03.288]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.288 --> 00:52:05.610]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:08.833]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.833 --> 00:52:13.938]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.938 --> 00:52:18.122]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.442 --> 00:52:20.784]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.784 --> 00:52:23.665]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.665 --> 00:52:26.587]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.587 --> 00:52:34.192]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:39.910]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.772]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.772 --> 00:52:46.455]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.455 --> 00:52:47.536]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.536 --> 00:52:48.857]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.721]  Joel Skousen, finishing up.
[00:54:23.721 --> 00:54:27.663]  So what's your time frame on this World War 3 situation?
[00:54:27.663 --> 00:54:29.743]  What do you see unfolding in the interim?
[00:54:29.743 --> 00:54:34.125]  And then, even the CFR last week said, hey,
[00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:38.784]  We better get out of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:54:38.784 --> 00:54:48.351]  And they normally, on policy as you know, publicly call the shots, kind of a lower house of the private corporate government.
[00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:54.976]  But now the military says no, basically we're not leaving Iraq, we're not leaving Central Asia, we're not leaving Afghanistan.
[00:54:54.976 --> 00:54:59.960]  And now headline, Afghan violence soars, insurgency expanding US.
[00:55:01.061 --> 00:55:10.478]  Violence in Afghanistan at an all-time high in recent months as Western troops battled an increasingly sophisticated insurgency expanding across the country, the U.S.
[00:55:10.478 --> 00:55:12.662]  military said yesterday.
[00:55:12.662 --> 00:55:14.064]  So, break it down for us.
[00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.514]  Well, a couple of major problems.
[00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:33.128]  First of all, remember that, and I'm sure you know this, that CFR and other types in the elite will often start, when a position becomes unpopular, they'll start putting some of their advisors out, giving counter positions.
[00:55:33.128 --> 00:55:40.735]  Like Brzezinski came out against all of the Bush years, denouncing that, even though he was all pro-Soviet and everything during the Carter years.
[00:55:41.515 --> 00:55:46.100]  Now we're starting to come out and attack the Afghan war as unwinnable from some of the elite.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:51.024]  They're positioning themselves for the fact that this will become a black mark.
[00:55:51.024 --> 00:55:54.467]  It will become an unpopular war, very unpopular, very soon.
[00:55:54.467 --> 00:56:02.775]  And they're going to be having advisors positioning themselves for the Republican side, who will start to attack the Afghan war as part of the presidential view.
[00:56:04.885 --> 00:56:06.007]  It's not going to get better.
[00:56:06.007 --> 00:56:18.880]  The Afghan police, for example, which is the crown jewel of our release from active combat troops to be able to let Afghan police take over, and they're so corrupt.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.065]  There's so many of the tribal leaders that control the Afghan police that they simply
[00:56:24.139 --> 00:56:24.720]  I don't
[00:56:45.834 --> 00:56:45.934]  Well...
[00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:08.991]  I really think that the Afghan and Iraqi situation is being held over for the Iran more especially.
[00:57:08.991 --> 00:57:14.095]  This is what's going to justify all of those troops being there as they pass.
[00:57:14.095 --> 00:57:22.982]  It's mostly going to be an aerial attack, I think, on Iran, but there will be some troops justified for staying in the region.
[00:57:22.982 --> 00:57:29.507]  Because even if they take out all of the infrastructure, military infrastructure in Iran, it still becomes a seething
[00:57:31.132 --> 00:57:38.415]  A pile of Muslims that are just going to have so much hatred for the West that all of our soldiers are going to be risked in this whole region.
[00:57:38.415 --> 00:57:44.438]  And then we may have real attacks, which the globalists will then use to clamp down on the American people.
[00:57:44.438 --> 00:57:47.659]  So clearly, you're right, they haven't circled Iran for that purpose.
[00:57:47.659 --> 00:57:52.161]  What's the timeframe from your intel on the strike on Iran?
[00:57:52.161 --> 00:57:54.162]  Well, I think it's going to be this year.
[00:57:54.162 --> 00:57:58.544]  They're still looking for a provocation, a justification of it, but I think it's going to be this year.
[00:58:00.166 --> 00:58:11.275]  Relative to your question about what I think about the Third World War and when one of these trigger events is going to go off, I think it's probably going to be an attack of North Korea on South Korea in earnest, to which the U.S.
[00:58:11.275 --> 00:58:14.637]  has to respond probably with tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:58:14.637 --> 00:58:20.462]  They have such an overwhelming majority of troops there that we cannot stop them, and all of our 26,000 U.S.
[00:58:20.462 --> 00:58:21.643]  troops will be at risk.
[00:58:22.123 --> 00:58:33.108]  I think 2005, there's a 50-50 chance, I'm sorry, 2015, 50-50 chance it could happen, but more likely almost toward the end of the decade because China won't be ready till then.
[00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:34.229]  All right, Joel, hold on.
[00:58:34.229 --> 00:58:35.750]  Do five more minutes with me if you can.
[00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:39.111]  I want you to have five minutes to really walk through this scenario slowly.
[00:58:39.111 --> 00:58:39.792]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.792 --> 00:58:45.935]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.836 --> 00:58:55.019]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:55.019 --> 00:59:01.424]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:59:01.424 --> 00:59:08.810]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:13.694]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:22.343 --> 00:59:26.068]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:59:26.584 --> 00:59:33.371]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:59:33.371 --> 00:59:37.254]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:59:37.254 --> 00:59:43.641]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.

[00:59:54.099 --> 00:59:56.485]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.485 --> 00:59:59.232]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:10.727]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.727 --> 01:00:12.329]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:13.870]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:18.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:22.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.421 --> 01:00:33.104]  We've got a surprise congressman popping in in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:33.104 --> 01:00:37.428]  He's very upset about the airline chicanery and slave training going on.
[01:00:37.428 --> 01:00:39.009]  That's backfiring on the system.
[01:00:39.009 --> 01:00:46.036]  We're going to open the phones up in the next two segments for your view on North Korea, the TSA, the opt-out day.
[01:00:46.036 --> 01:00:46.836]  I'm just not flying.
[01:00:47.797 --> 01:00:53.122]  All that's going on.
[01:00:53.122 --> 01:00:53.762]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:53.762 --> 01:00:54.903]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:54.903 --> 01:01:00.167]  We got about four minutes left with Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, if you just joined us.
[01:01:00.167 --> 01:01:06.512]  He was getting into his global strategic worldview from studying the globalists that I think is very accurate from my
[01:01:08.615 --> 01:01:10.177]  I concur with much of what he's saying.
[01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:13.422]  I think that's the general direction that the global power blocks are moving.
[01:01:25.757 --> 01:01:28.878]  Okay, before I get into that, I just want to make a clarification.
[01:01:28.878 --> 01:01:31.198]  When I said, when do I think they're going to attack Iran?
[01:01:31.198 --> 01:01:33.219]  When I said this year, I didn't mean 2010.
[01:01:33.219 --> 01:01:34.739]  I mean in the next 12 months.
[01:01:34.739 --> 01:01:34.919]  Yes.
[01:01:34.919 --> 01:01:38.920]  Because this year is almost through.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:44.862]  Going back to this general scenario, remember that Russia is running this show.
[01:01:45.872 --> 01:01:52.220]  Uh, China is going to be tagging along as the ally to back up Russia in its nuclear attack on the West.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:58.828]  China wants to play the role as not the primary attacker because it wants to position itself to be the Cold War
[01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:04.063]  Opposer of the West after it becomes the ally of the West during the war.
[01:02:04.063 --> 01:02:05.124]  It's like Russia.
[01:02:05.124 --> 01:02:12.892]  Russia comes in and helps the West beat Germany and then becomes the new Cold War enemy and gets all these concessions from the United States in the process.
[01:02:12.892 --> 01:02:14.593]  That's what China is setting itself up to.
[01:02:14.593 --> 01:02:20.119]  So China will be careful not to appear to be too much of the enemy even though they will
[01:02:21.132 --> 01:02:29.436]  Take, I think, when this war starts, the Pacific, in order to guard the rear of Russia.
[01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:35.239]  And then from that position, they'll attack Russia sometime during the war so that the West can win the war against Russia.
[01:02:35.239 --> 01:02:37.260]  Then it will be the West versus China.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.721]  That's the big picture.
[01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:41.142]  Now, in doing so, I don't think that China will
[01:02:41.642 --> 01:02:41.983]  I think so.
[01:02:58.749 --> 01:03:03.732]  We have to watch Russia because Russia is the one that's calling the shots here.
[01:03:03.732 --> 01:03:08.255]  Right now, the West is in the middle of giving everything away to the Russians.
[01:03:08.255 --> 01:03:20.383]  In NATO, for example, doing a joint military missile defense with Russia, Russia says, we'll cover your East, and you take up the missile defense in Western Europe itself.
[01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:25.767]  What they're doing, and this is very, very interesting, they're saying, we'll put our own missile defenses in here,
[01:03:26.627 --> 01:03:30.612]  To guard against Islamic, you know, rogue missile attacks.
[01:03:30.612 --> 01:03:43.429]  But they're taking the prime position to be able to use anti-ballistic missiles to keep Western anti-ballistic missiles from shooting down their own missiles in their boost phase by taking the Near East position.
[01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:46.110]  I don't know if I'm being clear what I'm saying.
[01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.411]  Yes.
[01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:57.936]  But it's very, very important for the West to understand that the French, who are now driving the agenda in NATO, are completely selling out to the Russians.
[01:03:57.936 --> 01:04:00.717]  Why, just for natural gas?
[01:04:00.717 --> 01:04:03.218]  No, no, it seems to be part of the globalist agenda.
[01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:03.618]  Sure, of course.
[01:04:03.618 --> 01:04:10.482]  The natural gas is being driven by the... Well, the EU has been called by Lord Monk and many others properly the new Soviet.
[01:04:11.476 --> 01:04:12.016]  That's right.
[01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:17.441]  It is a new Soviet, and they're basically... It's really a control of who's going to run this new world war.
[01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:18.843]  The Russians want to run it.
[01:04:18.843 --> 01:04:23.367]  The Anglo-American establishment knows that they intend to run it, and they have to eliminate Russia in the process.
[01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:25.849]  But they're in the process of luring Russia in.
[01:04:26.758 --> 01:04:30.099]  And getting it to be confident enough to attack the West.
[01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:33.920]  That's been the West's problem all these years, is trying to get Russia over.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.141]  That's why they disarmed them.
[01:04:35.141 --> 01:04:39.022]  That's why they're taking out our MX missile, even when they reneged on theirs.
[01:04:39.022 --> 01:04:40.563]  You know, Joel, this is too important.
[01:04:40.563 --> 01:04:50.786]  I promise to go to calls, but can you come back on the other side of the quick break for three minutes, put bookends on this, and explain in basics the factions you see, how you see it playing out.
[01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:51.947]  This is so important.
[01:04:51.947 --> 01:04:53.167]  Can you come back for three more minutes?
[01:04:53.447 --> 01:04:54.147]  Yeah, I will do that.
[01:04:54.147 --> 01:04:54.707]  Okay, we will.
[01:04:54.707 --> 01:04:55.808]  And I promise, folks, 800-259-9231.
[01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:59.889]  We're going right to your calls.
[01:04:59.889 --> 01:05:00.769]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.769 --> 01:05:05.310]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.231]  Number one.
[01:05:06.231 --> 01:05:09.652]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:10.132]  Number two.
[01:05:10.512 --> 01:05:15.394]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.394 --> 01:05:16.135]  It's true.
[01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:21.837]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.837 --> 01:05:25.439]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.439 --> 01:05:30.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:30.141 --> 01:05:32.902]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.902 --> 01:05:36.244]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:41.506]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.506 --> 01:05:46.568]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:50.729]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:52.530]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:57.132]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.883 --> 01:06:05.886]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.886 --> 01:06:09.148]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.148 --> 01:06:13.932]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:20.316]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.316 --> 01:06:22.578]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:23.078 --> 01:06:23.398]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.398 --> 01:06:23.919]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:24.599]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.599 --> 01:06:25.880]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.122]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:42.014 --> 01:06:49.281]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:07:02.298 --> 01:07:06.259]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:06.259 --> 01:07:15.121]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:15.121 --> 01:07:19.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:19.762 --> 01:07:30.564]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:31.204 --> 01:07:40.726]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:40.726 --> 01:07:46.148]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:53.629]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:53.629 --> 01:07:56.390]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:16.505]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.505 --> 01:08:23.828]  Going to your phone calls in a moment, Joel Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief, researching the New World Order for decades, of course,
[01:08:25.458 --> 01:08:27.678]  Joining us here, talking about the different power blocs.
[01:08:27.678 --> 01:08:38.141]  The Anglo-American establishment, the Chinese bloc dominating Asia, the Russian bloc, now, from a lot of evidence I've seen, is teamed up with the EU.
[01:08:38.141 --> 01:08:43.582]  You've got the Vatican, strangely enough, being involved in the founding of the EU.
[01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:45.442]  How many different power blocs do you see?
[01:08:45.442 --> 01:08:49.083]  I mean, they're all interconnected, but just briefly, from your view, name the power blocs.
[01:08:53.297 --> 01:08:57.060]  There are three major and only three true power blocs.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.722]  China, Russia, and the U.S.
[01:08:58.722 --> 01:09:02.445]  China, Russia, and the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:09:02.445 --> 01:09:03.526]  It's not just the U.S.
[01:09:03.526 --> 01:09:04.927]  Sure, it's England as well.
[01:09:04.927 --> 01:09:06.388]  Yeah, it's England as well.
[01:09:06.388 --> 01:09:12.233]  They're still locked together to try to control the world in a new world order.
[01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:16.617]  But there are several subgroups underneath those, and it's very difficult to track those.
[01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:18.218]  For example, we have
[01:09:19.597 --> 01:09:25.100]  You know, dozens of organizations, like Committee of 300, the Bilderberg Group, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:34.864]  I think the Trilateral Commission is up there at the very, very top in the Anglo-American establishment, and they essentially control CFR underneath them.
[01:09:34.864 --> 01:09:37.085]  The CFR is more visible.
[01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:46.509]  Bilderberg Group, I view, is more of a leadership conference, where they're bringing in people, bringing them up in the system, testing their ability to interact in these private conferences.
[01:09:46.509 --> 01:09:48.810]  But the big decisions aren't made at Bilderberg.
[01:09:49.815 --> 01:09:52.958]  They're usually made in private meetings before then.
[01:09:52.958 --> 01:09:57.281]  There is a Vatican connection there which is deep deep underground.
[01:09:57.281 --> 01:10:00.944]  It's kept way way underneath the surface.
[01:10:00.944 --> 01:10:02.425]  Is it part of Foundation X?
[01:10:03.527 --> 01:10:04.709]  I think it is.
[01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:16.402]  I think because Foundation X is very, very hypersensitive about nobody knowing who they are, that seems to be the Vatican connection as well in there, and that matches with that.
[01:10:16.402 --> 01:10:22.129]  But as I say, nobody knows what's going on deep inside the Foundation X realm.
[01:10:22.129 --> 01:10:23.370]  These people are hyper-secretive.
[01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:42.363]  Well, I agree with you on the Vatican connection because studying the founding documents of the EU, of the Bilderberg Group, I mean, when you go back to the Treaty of Rome, the Treaty of London in 46, the Treaty of Rome in 59, that's when the EU was really founded.
[01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:46.646]  I mean, that was the Vatican in there really getting that done.
[01:10:46.646 --> 01:10:53.090]  But then we see a lot of the Anglo-American establishment constantly attacking the Vatican, so we do see that fight going on.
[01:10:54.091 --> 01:10:54.612]  That's right.
[01:10:54.612 --> 01:11:03.142]  And you see a lot more of it going on in the Israel interaction with the Mexicans working in Israel trying to co-opt Israel's sovereignty, etc.
[01:11:03.142 --> 01:11:06.186]  And so they're working that angle very, very strongly.
[01:11:06.186 --> 01:11:08.790]  So who are the Rothschilds teamed up with?
[01:11:12.443 --> 01:11:16.389]  As I say, I don't really know what's going on at the very top level.
[01:11:16.389 --> 01:11:19.793]  I know they coordinate and have strong control over the U.S.
[01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:23.839]  faction, the Federal Reserve and things like that, but frankly, I would be a
[01:11:24.671 --> 01:11:28.053]  I'd be lying to say I knew what was going on on the inside, because I'm not an insider.
[01:11:28.053 --> 01:11:28.453]  I don't know.
[01:11:28.453 --> 01:11:29.694]  Okay, so we have these three blocks.
[01:11:29.694 --> 01:11:30.434]  I agree with you there.
[01:11:30.434 --> 01:11:32.836]  The globalists admit this in their own policy reports.
[01:11:32.836 --> 01:11:38.939]  They're very secretive about Foundation X. The Socialist International we've got to talk about.
[01:11:38.939 --> 01:11:43.882]  In Europe, the Socialist International is a Moscow-driven front.
[01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:51.246]  They know very, very well that the Communist Party is still alive and well and calling the shots in Russia through Medvedev and Putin.
[01:11:53.425 --> 01:11:55.186]  And actually working through the oligarchs.
[01:11:55.186 --> 01:12:05.773]  The oligarchs are really the old-line communist leaders who have faked their rejuvenated view of being, you know, mafia, oligarchs, capitalists.
[01:12:05.773 --> 01:12:06.733]  They're no such thing.
[01:12:06.733 --> 01:12:07.874]  They are the communist leaders.
[01:12:09.104 --> 01:12:14.586]  But the Socialist International is still run by those oligarchs, and that's why they are in Europe.
[01:12:14.586 --> 01:12:16.087]  But they're playing a very interesting role.
[01:12:16.087 --> 01:12:20.428]  Tony Blair was very big in the Socialist International, an outright Marxist.
[01:12:20.428 --> 01:12:28.351]  He came over to the globalist side and really ran, carried water for the globalists during the entire Iraq War.
[01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:35.954]  Whether or not he was doing that as an infiltrator from the Socialist International, or whether he was really, truly bought out and converted,
[01:12:36.694 --> 01:12:40.457]  And notice Blackwater converted to Catholicism, Prince, and so did Blair.
[01:12:47.827 --> 01:12:48.688]  That's right.
[01:12:48.688 --> 01:12:54.995]  And that's got to have to do with the major top-level controllers, I think, at the Vatican.
[01:12:54.995 --> 01:13:00.821]  And French President Sarkozy, it's very interesting that the French now are leading the charge.
[01:13:00.821 --> 01:13:09.291]  Instead of the U.S., they're kind of playing up to Russia on part of Europe, trying to snooker Europe into accepting Russia as a full partner in peace.
[01:13:09.955 --> 01:13:15.139]  They're saying the most egregious, stupid, idiotic things about Russia being no threat.
[01:13:15.139 --> 01:13:21.183]  They're fully integrable as into Europe and that's exactly what Europe wants or what Russia wants in terms of
[01:13:22.826 --> 01:13:28.788]  Okay, so to interrupt and finish this, we'll have you back soon.
[01:13:28.788 --> 01:13:46.655]  The three different groups, all infiltrating each other, but the Anglo-American establishment, from my research, is the most powerful, the most wealthy, the most cunning, the most successful, and they are planning to invite this attack, and then destroy their enemies, and then be able to set up the complete fascist world government.
[01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:47.755]  Is that where you see this going?
[01:13:48.459 --> 01:13:48.999]  Absolutely.
[01:13:48.999 --> 01:13:53.542]  The nuclear attack is essential for our leaders coming out of their bunkers and convincing the U.S.
[01:13:53.542 --> 01:14:00.165]  to go into a militarized world order, excluding Russia and China, because they're now the enemy.
[01:14:00.165 --> 01:14:05.108]  And we will be disarmed in the sense of saying, you know, there's no problem.
[01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:08.169]  We don't have any communists as part of this League of Democracy now.
[01:14:08.169 --> 01:14:10.751]  Whatever it's going to take us into this third world war.
[01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:14.873]  And that's how we'll lose our... So that's the original Ram Corporation COG plan.
[01:14:16.141 --> 01:14:16.501]  That's right.
[01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:18.982]  They will not return sovereignty to U.S.
[01:14:18.982 --> 01:14:24.344]  after this war because China will be the new enemy and they'll be so big and so strong that the U.N.
[01:14:24.344 --> 01:14:31.067]  or whatever its name will be will have to say we have to remain armed as an international force to confront this great world power, China.
[01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:31.387]  Yeah.
[01:14:31.387 --> 01:14:32.807]  No, I agree with you.
[01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:36.489]  And you think that within eight years this would have already happened?
[01:14:37.726 --> 01:14:40.748]  Yeah, I'm thinking these things tend to take longer.
[01:14:40.748 --> 01:14:44.911]  It's been taking decades to convince Russia to attack the United States.
[01:14:44.911 --> 01:14:51.195]  They're getting ready, they're planning, but still they're scared to death of what they know we're hiding.
[01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:55.738]  Joe, we're going to have you back up sometime in December if you can do it for two hours to really
[01:14:56.338 --> 01:14:56.838]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:15:21.966 --> 01:15:25.628]  Oh Alex, I praise God that I was able to get on and talk to you again.
[01:15:25.628 --> 01:15:27.528]  I've been trying to call for a few days now.
[01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:38.433]  I spoke to you about a week, ten days ago, and told you that they are telling us that we have to take the flu shot in the Wellmont Hospital System down here in Rogersville, Tennessee.
[01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:43.375]  My little hospital is forcing people to take the shot or get fired.
[01:15:44.435 --> 01:15:51.261]  And it's all color of law, and they tried all this last year, and it came out in court that they cannot force you to do that, or wear a mask.
[01:15:51.261 --> 01:16:03.972]  The message is, the flu, which kills a lot less people than automobiles or anything else, you've got to do this to set the precedent to make the first responders take it, so you will then go along with forcing us to take it.
[01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:11.081]  Yeah, and this is probably a first step, of course, to getting the forced inoculation for the rest of the country.
[01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:13.944]  You start small and you work up.
[01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:22.232]  They're telling us that people are emailing them from the companies, just praising them for having us take this flu shot, and they're all so thrilled!
[01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:24.361]  Well, ma'am, they already tried this last year.
[01:16:24.361 --> 01:16:29.986]  You need to organize with people at work politely and pull out the insert of that can cause Guillain-Barre.
[01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:31.307]  It lowers your immunity.
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:51.682]  Print out the mainstream news articles that seasonal flu shot, H1N1 shot as well, lowers immunity to flu.
[01:16:51.682 --> 01:16:53.883]  You need to just print it out and say no.
[01:16:53.883 --> 01:16:58.325]  And if they start threatening you, you go, look, I don't want to have to sue you.
[01:16:58.325 --> 01:17:02.986]  But they are certainly trying to force this on the population.
[01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:04.727]  So what can I do for you today?
[01:17:04.727 --> 01:17:08.788]  Well, I've got a lawsuit you might want to make reference to.
[01:17:08.788 --> 01:17:13.910]  It's Virginia Mason Hospital versus the Washington State Nurses Association.
[01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:22.977]  Where the Nurses Association was able to litigate this and overcome and say you couldn't force these nurses to take the shot.
[01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:25.298]  Yeah, same thing in Massachusetts, same thing in New York.
[01:17:25.298 --> 01:17:30.462]  They tried to make you take them under, not even state laws, the state just ordered it.
[01:17:30.462 --> 01:17:35.786]  Kind of like, we don't have a law, but minimum wage federal goons are going to stick their hands down your pants.
[01:17:36.286 --> 01:17:37.907]  I mean, it's called tyranny.
[01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:39.248]  They're just doing it.
[01:17:39.248 --> 01:17:41.008]  But I've seen that suit before.
[01:17:41.008 --> 01:17:42.269]  Give me the name of it again.
[01:17:42.269 --> 01:17:52.394]  Not just for myself, but for everybody else listening so they have that case law to show the hospitals being bribed and buffaloed into this.
[01:17:52.394 --> 01:17:53.375]  Give us the name of the case again.
[01:17:54.244 --> 01:17:56.466]  Okay, one more thing after this, please.
[01:17:56.466 --> 01:18:01.209]  Virginia Mason Hospital versus Washington State Nurses Association.
[01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:04.111]  Okay, Virginia Mason's... Ma'am?
[01:18:04.111 --> 01:18:04.471]  Ma'am?
[01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:04.952]  Ma'am?
[01:18:04.952 --> 01:18:05.432]  Ma'am, hold on.
[01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:06.833]  Let me just write it down here.
[01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:10.956]  Virginia Mason Hospital versus who?
[01:18:10.956 --> 01:18:15.199]  Washington State Nurses Association.
[01:18:15.199 --> 01:18:16.120]  Nurses Association.
[01:18:17.188 --> 01:18:21.691]  Our nursing associations are supposed to be there to support us in these kind of things.
[01:18:21.691 --> 01:18:22.212]  I know.
[01:18:22.212 --> 01:18:23.392]  Okay, real fast, what's your other point?
[01:18:23.392 --> 01:18:24.193]  I gotta get to everybody else.
[01:18:24.193 --> 01:18:25.614]  Alright.
[01:18:25.614 --> 01:18:27.535]  I wanted to thank you and your experts.
[01:18:27.535 --> 01:18:30.817]  I started listening to you at the last presidential election.
[01:18:30.817 --> 01:18:32.719]  I put my money into the fixed account.
[01:18:32.719 --> 01:18:36.721]  I wrote out that downturn we had.
[01:18:36.721 --> 01:18:43.586]  I didn't lose a thing and then when I turned 59 and a half, I took the money out and I put it into property and I live in a
[01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:50.118]  I'm blessed with a house on ten and a third acres and all I do is I listen to trees and I'm at peace out here.
[01:18:50.118 --> 01:18:50.899]  Well, God bless you.
[01:18:50.899 --> 01:18:53.141]  You do that in D.C.
[01:18:53.141 --> 01:18:54.082]  Well, I wish I was you.
[01:18:54.082 --> 01:18:57.004]  I wish I could sit out there and sit out in the trees.
[01:18:57.004 --> 01:18:58.666]  It sounds great.
[01:18:58.666 --> 01:18:59.326]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:59.326 --> 01:19:00.688]  Let's start jamming in some more here.
[01:19:00.688 --> 01:19:01.949]  James in Maryland, you're on the air.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:16.327]  I just want to tell you the media out here are talking to like radiologists on the news and they're saying the scan at the airports is like getting up you know hundreds
[01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:24.634]  Yeah, total lies.
[01:19:24.634 --> 01:19:27.538]  They're also on the news saying everyone loves it.
[01:19:27.538 --> 01:19:29.220]  No one's upset.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.745]  CNN and others have been reporting all day that everything's going smoothly.
[01:19:33.745 --> 01:19:36.328]  That's because they already pat down and searched most people.
[01:19:36.829 --> 01:19:36.989]  Yes.
[01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:37.049]  Yes.
[01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:05.415]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.415 --> 01:20:09.936]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.936 --> 01:20:16.077]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:18.518]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.518 --> 01:20:24.499]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:28.020]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.

[01:22:29.762 --> 01:22:31.003]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.003 --> 01:22:35.586]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.586 --> 01:22:41.390]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:45.032]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.032 --> 01:22:47.854]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:02.885 --> 01:23:04.586]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:23:04.586 --> 01:23:07.128]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:23:07.128 --> 01:23:14.694]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:23:14.694 --> 01:23:16.195]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:23:16.195 --> 01:23:18.938]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:23:18.938 --> 01:23:24.262]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:23:24.262 --> 01:23:29.306]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:23:29.486 --> 01:23:34.587]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:47.070]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.

[01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:55.252]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:10.396]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:10.396 --> 01:24:20.302]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:23.003]  Okay, James, finish up the point you were trying to make.
[01:24:23.003 --> 01:24:26.886]  Well, I was just going to bring up another thing going on here in Michigan.
[01:24:26.886 --> 01:24:30.428]  Remember I brought up about a CEO, Baker, that died?
[01:24:31.432 --> 01:24:37.954]  And his wife is on the news yesterday talking about how they, that she knows they're covering it up.
[01:24:37.954 --> 01:24:42.296]  Her name's Ann Woodlack speaks, that's the headline.
[01:24:42.296 --> 01:24:45.217]  And it's on clickondetroit.com.
[01:24:45.217 --> 01:24:47.758]  And she knows it's covered up.
[01:24:47.758 --> 01:24:53.780]  And she's saying that her husband told her that, you know, something might happen to him.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.621]  And it's like nobody's doing nothing here.
[01:24:57.575 --> 01:24:59.255]  And what specifically is going on?
[01:24:59.255 --> 01:25:03.797]  Um, her husband got, her husband got murdered.
[01:25:03.797 --> 01:25:09.618]  And they're at first saying it was unconclusive, saying he basically killed or committed suicide.
[01:25:09.618 --> 01:25:10.879]  So what's the story behind it?
[01:25:10.879 --> 01:25:12.139]  I mean, why do they think they killed him?
[01:25:12.139 --> 01:25:20.901]  I mean, there was a bullet in the back of his head and a bullet in his lung and no one found, or the first court or examiner never found it.
[01:25:20.901 --> 01:25:23.862]  But the second one that the wife hired found all that.
[01:25:24.654 --> 01:25:30.156]  And she's saying that her husband was talking about stuff like, if something happens, you know, I was killed.
[01:25:30.156 --> 01:25:33.677]  Well, I mean, we saw that in Arkansas a lot with Clinton.
[01:25:33.677 --> 01:25:36.338]  People have their heads cut off, they'd be shot in the back of the head.
[01:25:36.338 --> 01:25:41.839]  And Fannie Malick, the medical examiner that he hired, would say that it was suicide or natural causes.
[01:25:41.839 --> 01:25:43.680]  Appreciate your call, James.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:44.760]  Lori in Ohio.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.901]  Lori, you're on the air.
[01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:47.801]  Hi.
[01:25:47.801 --> 01:25:49.242]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:25:49.242 --> 01:25:50.302]  Actually, not very well.
[01:25:50.302 --> 01:25:52.323]  I need help here, Alex.
[01:25:52.323 --> 01:25:52.903]  I'm in trouble.
[01:25:53.809 --> 01:25:59.613]  I'm in an area where anything you can imagine is going on, and I'm by myself.
[01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.214]  I have no backup.
[01:26:01.214 --> 01:26:02.715]  And I'm in deep.
[01:26:02.715 --> 01:26:06.117]  I'm actually not in Ohio, and I would prefer... Okay, okay, fine, ma'am.
[01:26:06.117 --> 01:26:06.397]  Go ahead.
[01:26:06.397 --> 01:26:07.758]  You're on air.
[01:26:07.758 --> 01:26:12.061]  Okay, I don't know exactly what you want me to say as far as which part.
[01:26:12.061 --> 01:26:13.562]  I know of population control.
[01:26:13.562 --> 01:26:16.604]  I landed in a city in the Upper Peninsula in March.
[01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:20.887]  I took a very powerful bottle of pills from the biggest drug dealer in that town to this woman.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.221]  They were at Saraquel.
[01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:25.102]  And these kids aren't taking one pill, Alex.
[01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:26.223]  I watched a girl take two.
[01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:27.744]  Okay, so you're in with some bad people.
[01:26:27.744 --> 01:26:29.425]  I mean, how can I help you there?
[01:26:29.425 --> 01:26:32.646]  Well, I'm trying to find some type of support because I can't.
[01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:33.607]  It's not just that.
[01:26:33.607 --> 01:26:35.248]  They're building bunkers here.
[01:26:35.248 --> 01:26:36.109]  I live in the woods.
[01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.609]  I'm hiding.
[01:26:37.321 --> 01:26:39.522]  Because I have a lot of information.
[01:26:39.522 --> 01:26:43.243]  Okay, well the thing you need to do, ma'am, is you need to send us a letter, then, with specifics.
[01:26:43.243 --> 01:26:44.204]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:44.204 --> 01:26:59.869]  I mean, I get these calls where it's bottles of pills, bunkers in the woods, and we've got limited time here, and I can barely get the light bulbs changed around here, much less, you know, the hundreds of phone calls a day, people having their children taken by the government, where they can quantify what's happened.
[01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:04.731]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:27:04.731 --> 01:27:14.576]  This is Dan Badandi from We Got Change Rhode Island and Truth Radio.
[01:27:14.576 --> 01:27:20.759]  We were just hosting a rally at TF Green Airport in Potts, Rhode Island, and my cameraman got physically assaulted.
[01:27:20.759 --> 01:27:22.180]  We got her on film and everything else.
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.260]  We got physically assaulted.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.381]  They told us to put the signs down, the cameras down.
[01:27:25.381 --> 01:27:26.262]  They kept threatening us.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.061]  And when the mainstream media came over, they quickly dropped, you know, what they were doing and they walked away from us.
[01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:38.383]  And when the mainstream media, after they did an interview with us, right away they come, they physically pushed us off the airport property.
[01:27:38.383 --> 01:27:39.043]  Like, physically.
[01:27:39.043 --> 01:27:42.524]  They pushed us in the back off the airport property.
[01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:49.805]  Okay, so... Yes, so... So there's protests going on all over the country, we know that.
[01:27:49.805 --> 01:27:51.566]  And who was shoving on you?
[01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:52.846]  Who was physically going after you?
[01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:58.954]  Um, not the airport police themselves, but the directors, you know, the head people of the airport police.
[01:27:58.954 --> 01:28:02.097]  Um, you know, the state police were flying, you know, they didn't bother.
[01:28:02.097 --> 01:28:05.600]  Uh, the airport police would stand around like a bunch of, uh, terrorists.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.565]  And the two directors, the two guys, they pushed us, physically pushed us off the airport property.
[01:28:10.565 --> 01:28:13.567]  They're putting their hands on our cameras, telling us we can't film.
[01:28:13.567 --> 01:28:15.329]  And, um, we have a case law right here.
[01:28:15.329 --> 01:28:18.612]  It says freedom of expression on private property.
[01:28:18.612 --> 01:28:21.134]  I get the case laws on our freedomforum.org.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.907]  And it's a free expression on private property.
[01:28:23.907 --> 01:28:28.162]  It's a case law that gives us the right to protest on any property that serves the public.
[01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:35.381]  Well, absolutely, there is case law because it's quasi-public, because taxpayer money was used to build it.
[01:28:35.381 --> 01:28:37.383]  They just say that it's private.
[01:28:37.383 --> 01:28:40.205]  And they do this at community centers, you name it.
[01:28:40.205 --> 01:28:47.231]  Well, get that video up as soon as you can to YouTube, because this is the hottest news story right now.
[01:28:47.231 --> 01:28:48.292]  It's a real issue.
[01:28:48.292 --> 01:28:49.853]  People are concerned.
[01:28:49.853 --> 01:28:53.936]  And so if people wait a week or two to put the video up, it won't have as big an effect.
[01:28:53.936 --> 01:28:56.739]  That video, everybody out there, I know there's protests nationwide.
[01:28:57.379 --> 01:29:01.284]  Of the TSA thuggery, of their attempt to violate your First Amendment.
[01:29:01.284 --> 01:29:03.767]  You need to get that up on the web right now my friend.
[01:29:03.767 --> 01:29:11.396]  It'll be up tomorrow morning and we did manage to reach out to some people and we did make a difference.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.380]  I'm good.
[01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:32.131]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:30:06.418 --> 01:30:10.361]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.361 --> 01:30:12.603]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.603 --> 01:30:18.467]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.467 --> 01:30:24.712]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.112 --> 01:30:31.094]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.094 --> 01:30:35.275]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.275 --> 01:30:39.556]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.556 --> 01:30:45.498]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.498 --> 01:30:49.059]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.059 --> 01:30:51.040]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:51.480]  It's here.

[01:32:10.389 --> 01:32:15.272]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.272 --> 01:32:16.033]  It's true.
[01:32:16.033 --> 01:32:20.896]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.896 --> 01:32:21.716]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.716 --> 01:32:25.299]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.299 --> 01:32:29.001]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:30.002]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.002 --> 01:32:32.765]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.765 --> 01:32:36.449]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.449 --> 01:32:37.250]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:41.395]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.395 --> 01:32:46.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.606]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.606 --> 01:32:52.388]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.388 --> 01:32:54.651]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:54.651 --> 01:32:56.995]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:02.918 --> 01:33:03.498]  We've got it.
[01:33:03.498 --> 01:33:10.023]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:10.023 --> 01:33:14.427]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:14.427 --> 01:33:20.051]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:41.962]  Well, I tell ya, I've always been a supporter and a fan of Representative who's on with us right now, but I had no idea that there in Knoxville, Tennessee, he is a listener to the show, Representative John Duncan, and of course he's made headlines across the country in the last few weeks.
[01:33:42.563 --> 01:33:45.926]  Criticizing the TSA and their activities.
[01:33:45.926 --> 01:33:50.970]  Here's the headline, Duncan Blast TSA Pat Downs Body Scans in Floor Speech.
[01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:57.576]  And then I was just talking to him during the break and he heard Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano on the show yesterday.
[01:33:57.576 --> 01:34:02.480]  So he'll be with us for about 25 minutes, but hopefully the first of many visits.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:10.587]  So we'll give a shout out to WBCR 1470 that we've been on for about a decade there in the Knoxville area.
[01:34:11.027 --> 01:34:12.188]  Well, Alex, thank you very much.
[01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:18.270]  It's a real honor to be on with you, and I always have appreciated the work you've done in trying to fight against the New World Order and big government.
[01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:52.161]  Big government helps only the elitist and the very, very wealthy, and you fight for the people that I... Well, I hate to say the little guy, but you know what I mean.
[01:34:52.161 --> 01:34:55.023]  I appreciate the work that you do.
[01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:55.964]  Well, we appreciate you.
[01:34:55.964 --> 01:34:59.067]  How long have you been tuning in to the show on WBCR?
[01:34:59.067 --> 01:35:02.189]  Oh, for many years.
[01:35:02.189 --> 01:35:04.431]  I know Harry Grothjohn real well.
[01:35:04.431 --> 01:35:07.134]  I've been on with him many times, and I've been on with
[01:35:08.163 --> 01:35:09.204]  He has the power, Aaron.
[01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:14.549]  I've been on with Joyce Riley a couple of times, and I've listened to your show.
[01:35:14.549 --> 01:35:27.240]  I try never to miss a vote, but as soon as we have the last vote of the week, I catch the first plane home, and I actually end up spending just a little bit more time here in my district in Tennessee than
[01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:33.586]  I do in Washington, and so I do listen to several of the other stations.
[01:35:33.586 --> 01:35:45.476]  I don't want to make any of my other friends mad on the other stations, but I listen to WTCR regularly, and I really have enjoyed your program for many years, probably ever since you've been on here.
[01:35:45.933 --> 01:35:46.913]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:35:46.913 --> 01:35:48.134]  Small world.
[01:35:48.134 --> 01:36:00.238]  This TSA situation is really becoming a focal point, not just against the abuse and humiliation, but overall a focal point for people's anger.
[01:36:00.238 --> 01:36:02.339]  Give us your view on that statement.
[01:36:02.819 --> 01:36:05.121]  And the fact that every day we learn more.
[01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:07.523]  Now they stick their hands in the pants.
[01:36:07.523 --> 01:36:15.849]  Now they're removing people's urology bags, colostomy bags, women's artificial breasts from mastectomies.
[01:36:15.849 --> 01:36:19.611]  I mean this is a federal power grab on so many fronts, Congressman.
[01:36:20.512 --> 01:36:23.114]  Tell us why you have powerfully spoken out against it.
[01:36:23.114 --> 01:36:25.677]  I mean, I know that you're on some of the most important committees.
[01:36:25.677 --> 01:36:31.041]  You were previously the House Aviation Subcommittee and top Republican on the House Subcommittee.
[01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:32.763]  You'll probably be getting back in as the chairman.
[01:36:32.763 --> 01:36:35.105]  I mean, you're a leading expert in this area.
[01:36:35.105 --> 01:36:35.866]  Give us your view on it.
[01:36:36.949 --> 01:36:55.639]  Well, I did chair the Aviation Subcommittee for six years a few years ago when Republicans had control of the Congress, and we have a rule on our side that you can only chair a committee or subcommittee for six years, but I have been on the Aviation Subcommittee ever since I've been in Congress, and that's now 22 years.
[01:36:58.793 --> 01:37:01.034]  So it's something I'm very much interested in.
[01:37:01.034 --> 01:37:05.715]  I will continue to serve on that subcommittee, although I won't be chairman.
[01:37:05.715 --> 01:37:10.176]  I'll be chairman in the next Congress of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee.
[01:37:10.176 --> 01:37:17.818]  But I think this body scanner business and these pat-downs, I think it's totally ridiculous.
[01:37:17.818 --> 01:37:18.978]  I think it's excessive.
[01:37:20.297 --> 01:37:30.868]  And I've tried to tell people that if we spend 100% of the federal budget on security, we could not make the country totally, completely, 100% safe.
[01:37:30.868 --> 01:37:33.831]  So we need to have a little balance and common sense.
[01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:36.894]  And I think that we need to come to our senses on this.
[01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:40.258]  I think it's far more about money than it is about security.
[01:37:41.002 --> 01:37:56.415]  Although I do realize that even though there's a nationwide revolt against this and people are really upset about it, as they should be, I do realize that there probably are half the people who will go along with anything as long as it has the word security attached to it.
[01:37:56.415 --> 01:38:03.502]  But I think the TSA has gone too far and I've spoken out on the floor about this.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:11.925]  And of course another thing I've been concerned about, almost all these federal contracts are sweetheart insider type deals.
[01:38:11.925 --> 01:38:13.225]  And I don't like that either.
[01:38:13.225 --> 01:38:16.007]  And I think that's present here too.
[01:38:16.007 --> 01:38:26.673]  Well Chertoff, as you spoke on the floor, Benjamin Chertoff, former head of Homeland Security, and Alphonse D'Amato, and there's also some Democrats involved, but the former Senator, he's been all over TV.
[01:38:26.673 --> 01:38:28.595]  We've played the clips admitting he's making money.
[01:38:29.315 --> 01:38:29.935]  I don't think so.
[01:38:53.464 --> 01:39:08.978]  Well you've hit on something else that I've been very outspoken about on the floor and that is that the defense contractors hire all the retired admirals and generals and then they go back and sign on with these big defense contractors and go back and get the
[01:39:09.702 --> 01:39:14.468]  Just ridiculously excessive and expensive contracts for the Pentagon.
[01:39:14.468 --> 01:39:21.015]  In fact, I've said in speeches and committee hearings that I wonder sometimes if there's any conservatives at the Pentagon.
[01:39:21.015 --> 01:39:27.963]  And I can say that even though I believe that national defense is probably the most legitimate function.
[01:39:28.806 --> 01:39:38.175]  Of the federal government, but I still hate to see all the waste and insider dealing that's going on with the Defense Department.
[01:39:38.175 --> 01:39:55.150]  But going back to Turtoff, there's something funny going on there, in my opinion, because a year ago, November of last year, he was on the Campbell Brown Show on CNN, and he was talking, you know, he was supporting these scanners at that time.
[01:39:55.936 --> 01:40:06.641]  And he didn't mention that he had anything to do with any of the companies until Campbell Brown said, well, in the interest of full disclosure, you represent some of these companies.
[01:40:06.641 --> 01:40:13.104]  And having been caught, then he said, absolutely, that's correct.
[01:40:13.104 --> 01:40:16.165]  In other words, he admitted after she confronted him with it.
[01:40:16.165 --> 01:40:19.607]  And so then there was a story in the Washington Post
[01:40:21.245 --> 01:40:31.848]  At the first of this year, saying that he had this connection, and his firm got some kind of a correction, I think they said, for the headline, but not for the story.
[01:40:31.848 --> 01:40:41.511]  So, there's been some kind of connection with these companies for the Churchoff Group, but now he's claiming that he never made any money off of it.
[01:40:41.511 --> 01:40:47.353]  What he may be trying to say, I don't know, that his group made some money, or some other people in his firm.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.102]  It still looks like an insider type deal to me.
[01:40:58.956 --> 01:41:00.597]  Look, the borders are wide open.
[01:41:00.597 --> 01:41:10.203]  ABC News reported two weeks ago that illegal aliens can walk in and get a TSA waiver and have and get to rent aircraft.
[01:41:10.203 --> 01:41:15.266]  We know that hundreds of boats a week are landing in San Diego and on the island off the coast.
[01:41:15.266 --> 01:41:17.087]  That's Associated Press.
[01:41:17.087 --> 01:41:20.429]  And that the illegal aliens are just pouring in on the fishing boats.
[01:41:20.429 --> 01:41:22.030]  No police, no border patrol.
[01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:24.592]  They could care less.
[01:41:24.592 --> 01:41:26.253]  You're exactly right.
[01:41:26.253 --> 01:41:28.054]  And what I said on that
[01:41:29.131 --> 01:41:34.770]  We've got plenty of security at the airports right now, but there's always companies and people trying to...
[01:41:35.416 --> 01:41:37.697]  Get more and get you to spend more.
[01:41:37.697 --> 01:41:44.360]  But I think now these terrorists would probably do something much more spectacular than bringing down a plane.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:54.865]  They'd probably blow up a mall at Christmas or blow up a major sporting event or poison the water supply or even blow up a big city subway system.
[01:41:54.865 --> 01:41:56.986]  They'd kill a lot more people.
[01:41:56.986 --> 01:42:00.568]  And I think, too, we're very vulnerable in cybersecurity.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.243]  We're so controlled by all the computers and so forth now.
[01:42:05.243 --> 01:42:11.649]  So, you know, we just can't do, we can't go ridiculously overboard at the airport.
[01:42:11.649 --> 01:42:12.870]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:20.217]  I mean, are we going to have minimum wage federal employees that are outside the law and violate due process?
[01:42:20.217 --> 01:42:26.522]  I mean, actually, Big Sis Janet Napolitano is actually in the news.
[01:42:27.603 --> 01:42:34.709]  Now saying, next they want them in malls, trains, boats, buses.
[01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:39.253]  We already have TSA doing warrantless searches in areas like New York and Boston.
[01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:44.457]  I mean, are we going to have 50 million TSA workers to guard every 7-Eleven?
[01:42:44.457 --> 01:42:47.320]  Because, I mean, a real terrorist, I mean, that's just the way it is.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.044]  The only answer is to have an armed, concealed carry population.
[01:42:52.044 --> 01:42:54.766]  You can't put enough police on the streets with machine guns and dogs.
[01:42:55.174 --> 01:42:58.276]  Well, you're exactly right, and I agree with you.
[01:42:58.276 --> 01:43:03.800]  The TSA has become a bloated bureaucracy.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:10.704]  Just a few years ago it had 16,500 employees, now it's got 61,000 employees, and it's top-heavy with administrators and
[01:43:13.866 --> 01:43:14.927]  We're good to go.
[01:43:38.831 --> 01:44:01.421]  I was asked on television just a few weeks ago what was the biggest change I'd seen in my time in office, and I said, without any question, it's that almost everybody who keeps up with this stuff now is more concerned, worried, upset, angry, whatever you want to say, about the financial condition of the federal government and our deficits and our debt.
[01:44:01.421 --> 01:44:07.584]  And I think more and more people are beginning to realize that we can't just go crazy
[01:44:08.366 --> 01:44:10.008]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:44:20.586 --> 01:44:32.439]  That the spending was now far exceeding the threat and that it had become a major profit center and a funding bonanza for federal and state agencies, corporations, non-profit groups, and so forth.
[01:44:32.439 --> 01:44:39.146]  And as I said earlier, this is all more about money and power than it is about any real threat or real security.
[01:44:40.233 --> 01:44:50.758]  Well, if this continues, we'll have to change the American flag to basically an image of a sheep or an ostrich with its head in the sand.
[01:44:50.758 --> 01:44:54.720]  And we'll have to get rid of the American eagle and replace it with an ostrich.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:05.206]  I mean, since when did the land of the free, home of the brave get like this, where we're so afraid of men in caves, we've got a better chance from dying from a bee sting or an automobile accident.
[01:45:05.206 --> 01:45:07.347]  Hundreds die a year from bees and wasp stings.
[01:45:09.488 --> 01:45:14.071]  I mean, it's just so crazy to see the federal government expanding its power.
[01:45:14.071 --> 01:45:15.011]  But you're a congressman.
[01:45:15.011 --> 01:45:16.572]  You study these issues more than I have.
[01:45:16.572 --> 01:45:22.976]  I know that the airlines opt in to have the TSA there.
[01:45:22.976 --> 01:45:26.378]  Some airlines are saying and some airports are saying they don't want them now.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:39.305]  I mean, at the end of the day, where do you see this backlash going, and what are your biggest problems, Congressman, with what the TSA is doing?
[01:45:39.305 --> 01:45:47.469]  And isn't this a Tenth Amendment violation to have them on the streets of America and announcing that they want to expand what they're doing?
[01:45:47.469 --> 01:45:54.973]  Well, we have expanded all of these federal law enforcement agencies far beyond what they should be, far beyond what is necessary.
[01:45:54.973 --> 01:45:58.515]  I mean, the FBI, I mean, I have a...
[01:45:59.179 --> 01:46:01.363]  An uncle whom I love very much, who...
[01:46:02.759 --> 01:46:08.961]  Many, many years ago started his career as an FBI agent, and he was just with them for a few years.
[01:46:08.961 --> 01:46:22.924]  But I'll tell you, we've expanded that agency far beyond what's necessary, and most of the real law enforcement work is done by local law enforcement people in the first place.
[01:46:22.924 --> 01:46:30.146]  And I've even said, for instance, that one agency that we should do away with is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[01:46:31.002 --> 01:46:41.367]  Now they've added on the word explosives to it to try to expand their mission, but everything that they do is done best by state and local law enforcement people.
[01:46:41.367 --> 01:46:45.248]  And one expert told me that they're nothing but paper pushers now.
[01:46:45.248 --> 01:46:50.550]  But I heard you say yesterday that bee sting analogy, and I was very impressed by that.
[01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:56.153]  I have told people that you really are thousands of times, many thousands of times more likely
[01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:58.431]  I don't think so.
[01:47:07.002 --> 01:47:09.824]  The problem we're into is this, Alex.
[01:47:09.824 --> 01:47:18.751]  It's almost impossible to get big brother federal government to ever admit making a mistake or ever go back on anything.
[01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:24.676]  And we've given so much power in this country to unelected bureaucrats.
[01:47:24.676 --> 01:47:33.123]  In fact, I've said many times that today, unfortunately, we have a government up by and for the bureaucrats instead of up by and for the people.
[01:47:33.123 --> 01:47:35.445]  And so it's going to be very hard to get them to
[01:47:36.605 --> 01:47:38.147]  I don't think so.
[01:47:56.936 --> 01:47:57.477]  I think so.
[01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:33.812]  My neck and chest and so forth and this is a full body radiation thing and then I think parents have a legitimate concern about not only the radiation but also having unfamiliar people grope or feel their children in private type places.
[01:48:33.812 --> 01:48:34.573]  I think it's terrible.
[01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:49.968]  Well, I agree with you, Congressman, and I've had radiologists on the show, we've got the New York Times, top scientists, federal bodies, the International Atomic Energy Agency, have said that these things have 50 times what the TSA claimed a year ago.
[01:48:49.968 --> 01:48:53.131]  They've been lying, and if you look at the images TSA has released,
[01:48:53.652 --> 01:49:03.936]  To give you an idea, you can see the hands, and you can see the bones in the hands, and that's exactly what radiologists have told me on and off air, is that they've looked at the calibrations.
[01:49:03.936 --> 01:49:09.518]  It's about like a dental skull x-ray.
[01:49:09.518 --> 01:49:13.439]  It's not approaching a chest x-ray, but it's close.
[01:49:13.439 --> 01:49:19.822]  And it's the repeated exposure, and they've got all these top scientists on record saying bare minimum,
[01:49:20.442 --> 01:49:25.430]  Skin cancers, and that it'll exacerbate people that are already prone to skin cancers.
[01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:28.235]  What about the TSA workers who are around it all day?
[01:49:28.235 --> 01:49:31.720]  They're not hiding behind any lead shielding.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.603]  But, Congressman, what about this issue?
[01:49:34.708 --> 01:49:37.489]  Ron Paul, we had him on yesterday, and you said you heard it.
[01:49:37.489 --> 01:49:37.990]  Right.
[01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:39.991]  But I said, so you've had Enhanced Pat Down.
[01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:40.851]  He said, yes.
[01:49:40.851 --> 01:49:41.932]  I said, they've touched your crotch.
[01:49:41.932 --> 01:49:43.432]  He said, yes, it's disgusting.
[01:49:43.432 --> 01:49:48.295]  That's on the Drudge Report today, the video and audio of that.
[01:49:48.295 --> 01:49:52.557]  But now the TSA told ABC News, maybe that goes too far.
[01:49:52.557 --> 01:49:54.298]  Hand in the pants.
[01:49:54.298 --> 01:49:56.959]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:49:56.959 --> 01:50:00.481]  And now people are stripping down to their underwear as a protest.
[01:50:01.161 --> 01:50:10.250]  The TSA is still rubbing their skin, rubbing their kneecaps where they have metal in them to make sure it's really metal.
[01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:15.375]  I mean, this is like sacrificing our liberty on the altar.
[01:50:16.704 --> 01:50:18.565]  of big government congressmen.
[01:50:18.565 --> 01:50:22.827]  But my issue is that now it's discriminatory.
[01:50:22.827 --> 01:50:29.230]  Because Boehner, you know, it's videoed on the news, he gets to go around the checkpoint.
[01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:33.072]  A lot of other congresspeople, they're not releasing the full list, but it's in the AP.
[01:50:33.072 --> 01:50:36.293]  The White House says they won't release who it is.
[01:50:36.293 --> 01:50:41.676]  But now if you're a bigwig, you get a pass, but the citizens don't.
[01:50:41.676 --> 01:50:45.778]  Here's the headline, TSA, some government officials to skip airport security.
[01:50:46.558 --> 01:50:49.960]  A, do you get to bypass it, and B, what's your view of this?
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.121]  Well, no, I don't get to bypass it, and I saw that in the paper myself.
[01:50:54.121 --> 01:51:11.709]  I hadn't even heard that part until I saw that this morning on the news, and I assume that they're giving a pass to the top cabinet officials and the top administration officials and the leaders of the House and Senate, you know, the top
[01:51:12.822 --> 01:51:17.544]  The top five in the House and the top four in the Senate, I think that that's what it is.
[01:51:17.544 --> 01:51:24.146]  But nobody, if we're going to have it, nobody at the top level should be given a pass.
[01:51:24.146 --> 01:51:28.507]  But there's other concerns that go along with that.
[01:51:28.507 --> 01:51:39.931]  For instance, I understand that already people who say they don't want to go through the scanning, that some TSA people are resentful about having to do that, and so they're being
[01:51:40.837 --> 01:51:45.401]  Almost rude or irritable or hateful in doing these things.
[01:51:45.401 --> 01:51:46.461]  No, they're rough!
[01:51:46.461 --> 01:51:47.322]  They're rough!
[01:51:47.322 --> 01:51:49.083]  They squeeze hard, that's confirmed.
[01:51:49.083 --> 01:51:51.585]  Right, and then I have this concern also.
[01:51:51.585 --> 01:52:02.894]  The plans are right now to purchase 1,800 of these scanners by various departments and agencies by the year 2014.
[01:52:04.535 --> 01:52:23.499]  And what I can see coming is that they'll end up buying several thousand of these things and wanting to put them in all the federal buildings for when you go in, you know, any federal building and all these department agencies, they all want to get all the latest gizmos and so forth.
[01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:41.828]  There is one good thing that may come out of this, hopefully, and it would be that, number one, that more people would begin to realize that just because the word security is mentioned doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it's good or that it's not excessive or intrusive.
[01:52:42.481 --> 01:52:42.561]  Yes.
[01:53:00.101 --> 01:53:09.145]  It's the most elitist, out-of-control federal government now, and it's totally opposite from what our founding fathers thought the way things should be.
[01:53:09.145 --> 01:53:26.872]  They thought that we should solve most of our problems through the private free enterprise system, and then go to government only for a few things, and first to the local government, then to the state governments, and have the federal government, which was meant to be only a government of last resort, with very few and very limited powers.
[01:53:27.692 --> 01:53:37.459]  What we've done in the last few years is turn the federal government into a government of first resort that we run to for almost everything and it's just not working.
[01:53:37.459 --> 01:53:38.020]  Absolutely.
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.162]  Representative John Duncan is our guest.
[01:53:41.162 --> 01:53:42.283]  Amazing.
[01:53:42.283 --> 01:53:45.845]  And he's there from the Knoxville area with his district in Tennessee.
[01:53:45.845 --> 01:53:51.269]  You can go to the House site and of course visit his site and read his writings and ideas.
[01:53:51.269 --> 01:53:53.671]  Are there any other websites, Congressman, that people can visit?
[01:53:55.083 --> 01:54:15.194]  Well no, they can visit my website and I speak out on these things all the time and like I said, I certainly admire and respect the work that you're doing too because it's going to be very difficult to turn this monster around.
[01:54:17.955 --> 01:54:19.736]  But we sure need to do so.
[01:54:19.736 --> 01:54:36.789]  When you're talking about us facing a national debt of over 14 trillion dollars, which is a mind-boggling figure, but what it means is, it's an incomprehensible figure, but it means that it's not going to be long at all before we're not going to be able to pay all of our social security and veterans' pensions, the things we've promised our own people.
[01:54:36.789 --> 01:54:37.429]  Absolutely.
[01:54:37.429 --> 01:54:41.573]  Sir, we're almost out of time, and will you promise to come back in the next few months?
[01:54:41.573 --> 01:54:43.314]  Yes, I'll be glad to.
[01:54:43.314 --> 01:54:47.497]  I'm honored to be on here with you, and I'll keep listening to you every chance I have.
[01:54:47.677 --> 01:54:50.039]  Well, we've got about five minutes left with you, Congressman.
[01:54:50.039 --> 01:54:52.101]  I want to finish up on the eve of Thanksgiving.
[01:54:52.101 --> 01:54:58.286]  We appreciate you joining us and your great record of promoting liberty in the House of Representatives.
[01:54:58.286 --> 01:55:08.294]  Talking about the New World Order, you know, Ron Paul, myself, you and others have been demonized over the years for being informed, reading UN documents, knowing about the CFR.
[01:55:08.294 --> 01:55:08.554]  Now,
[01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:16.199]  It's world government, new global taxes, carbon taxes to be paid to this SDR.
[01:55:16.199 --> 01:55:19.100]  We see the private central banks imploding countries.
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.921]  I do see a really big awakening.
[01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:24.483]  What's your message to the American people about this global government?
[01:55:24.483 --> 01:55:26.745]  And what's your view on where we're going?
[01:55:26.745 --> 01:55:32.148]  I mean, I believe we're starting to turn the corner and that real issues are starting to get on the table.
[01:55:32.912 --> 01:55:41.619]  Well, I'm so glad that you brought that up because, I mean, now we're seeing the bailout that's having to be put together for Ireland.
[01:55:41.619 --> 01:55:46.083]  And earlier, a few months ago, we had to do one for Greece.
[01:55:46.083 --> 01:55:52.208]  And the American taxpayers are paying a lot of this bailout and don't even realize it because
[01:55:53.408 --> 01:55:57.350]  Big portions of these bailouts are being paid through the International Monetary Fund.
[01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:59.991]  Yeah, sometimes we pay more than half as you know, yeah.
[01:55:59.991 --> 01:56:15.716]  We shouldn't even be in in the first place, but we see Greece and Ireland and on the NPR, I listened even to NPR and this morning they were interviewing a couple of people from Portugal because they think they're next, Spain is next.
[01:56:15.716 --> 01:56:20.318]  We look around at the, we see what's happening in California and you can see what
[01:56:21.087 --> 01:56:23.208]  Coming.
[01:56:23.208 --> 01:56:27.249]  You know, it doesn't take a genius to see the problems that we're headed into.
[01:56:27.249 --> 01:56:29.449]  We've got to start saying no to these bankers.
[01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:30.470]  That's right.
[01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:39.012]  And our children and grandchildren are going to face problems that are so severe that we can't even imagine if we don't turn this thing around.
[01:56:39.012 --> 01:56:43.393]  And you talk about the New World Order.
[01:56:43.393 --> 01:56:47.314]  I remember when they found out that I was leaning against the war in Iraq.
[01:56:48.484 --> 01:56:54.269]  They had Condoleezza Rice and George Tenet, the head of the CIA, and John McLaughlin, his deputy director.
[01:56:54.269 --> 01:56:58.972]  They had me and five others down to a little secure room at the White House.
[01:56:58.972 --> 01:57:06.337]  And I told them at that time, I said, there was a front page story in the Washington Post.
[01:57:06.337 --> 01:57:15.804]  Lawrence Lindsey, the president's chief economics advisor, had said that day that a war with Iraq would cost 100 to 200 billion, and they fired him because of it.
[01:57:16.394 --> 01:57:18.255]  And I asked Condoleezza Rice about that.
[01:57:18.255 --> 01:57:24.159]  She said, oh no, it wouldn't cost more than $50 or $60 billion, and we'd get some of that back from our allies.
[01:57:24.159 --> 01:57:26.381]  And how wrong she was about that.
[01:57:26.381 --> 01:57:37.228]  But I asked them that day, I said, if you can get past the traditional conservative position of being against massive foreign aid, and the traditional conservative position of being against huge deficit spending,
[01:57:37.868 --> 01:57:44.010]  And against the traditional conservative position of being the biggest critics of the U.N.
[01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:46.131]  and we were going to war to enforce U.N.
[01:57:46.131 --> 01:57:47.291]  resolutions.
[01:57:47.291 --> 01:57:53.994]  I said, if you get past all those traditional conservative positions, is there any evidence of any imminent threat?
[01:57:53.994 --> 01:57:55.474]  And they didn't have any.
[01:57:55.474 --> 01:58:05.938]  And what I'm trying to get across to you is that these things have been totally opposite or totally against all traditional conservative positions.
[01:58:06.716 --> 01:58:14.783]  And yet, we've had too many Republicans in the Congress, good friends of mine, who've been supporting some of this stuff.
[01:58:14.783 --> 01:58:21.148]  But hopefully, with the Tea Party and the opposition that's popped up here in the last few months,
[01:58:21.855 --> 01:58:31.341]  Maybe and hopefully we've got more people realizing that we've got to do differently than we did when we had control during that 12 years.
[01:58:31.341 --> 01:58:33.283]  Congressman, I know you've got to go.
[01:58:33.283 --> 01:58:35.084]  We've got a one minute break.
[01:58:35.084 --> 01:58:44.910]  Let me just say bye to you during the break or see if we can come back and just have you briefly finish your thought.
[01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:48.713]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.237 --> 01:58:52.898]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.898 --> 01:58:56.261]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:59:56.488 --> 01:59:59.290]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.953 --> 02:00:07.254]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.254 --> 02:00:09.015]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.015 --> 02:00:10.776]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.776 --> 02:00:12.357]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.357 --> 02:00:13.898]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.898 --> 02:00:18.101]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.101 --> 02:00:22.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.656 --> 02:00:30.577]  Well, he hails from the 2nd District of Tennessee.
[02:00:30.577 --> 02:00:31.938]  One of our oldest affiliates.
[02:00:31.938 --> 02:00:35.279]  Might even be 12 years we've been on it.
[02:00:35.279 --> 02:00:39.420]  That's the great station, WBCR.
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:41.441]  And of course, he's Representative John Duncan.
[02:00:41.441 --> 02:00:42.181]  He's gotta go.
[02:00:42.181 --> 02:00:43.521]  He's got a lot of work to do.
[02:00:43.521 --> 02:00:50.944]  He's promised to come back again soon, but you were intriguing me with the last point you were making because that was on my list of questions I hadn't got to.
[02:00:51.624 --> 02:01:00.309]  Well, you know, as somebody who does score with the New American Magazine, who I really respect, with a 99, the second highest in Congress.
[02:01:00.309 --> 02:01:01.730]  Ron Paul has 100.
[02:01:01.730 --> 02:01:03.772]  There's one guy under you with a 95.
[02:01:03.772 --> 02:01:08.014]  But, I mean, you really, I mean, let's see if Rand could even get close to you.
[02:01:08.014 --> 02:01:10.576]  And we're certainly hoping that's the case.
[02:01:10.576 --> 02:01:20.342]  But looking at this new crop of House members and senators and where the Tea Party's going, you know, my point is, Congressman, I see it as a victory regardless.
[02:01:21.434 --> 02:01:39.101]  Because now, issues of world government, issues of mega-corporations wanting socialism, issues of rhino-republicans, all these things they've tried to demonize and make fun of as hokey, that's now the vanguard, at least on the surface, of Sarah Palin and all these people and Glenn Beck.
[02:01:39.101 --> 02:01:41.842]  They've at least got to take on our mantle of real patriots.
[02:01:42.142 --> 02:01:44.804]  That shows we're winning the intellectual battle.
[02:01:44.804 --> 02:01:47.167]  We're now identifying the private fellow reserve.
[02:01:47.167 --> 02:02:02.220]  So I briefly wanted to, just in two or three minutes, get your view, Congressman, in closing on your prognosis of what you see with this new crop of Tea Party people and this fight for the heart and soul of real conservatism that we haven't really seen since the days of Barry Goldwater.
[02:02:03.393 --> 02:02:07.179]  Well, I'm hopeful that we can do a lot more.
[02:02:07.179 --> 02:02:14.251]  The Democrats started the last Congress with an 81-seat majority, and when you have an 81-seat majority on the other side, you lose almost every
[02:02:14.873 --> 02:02:15.453]  Key vote.
[02:02:15.453 --> 02:02:26.219]  But I've been speaking out for years against this big government, big business duopoly that's been running this country that benefited just a very few people at the top.
[02:02:26.219 --> 02:02:33.762]  And in fact, what I've said for years, the only thing extremely big government is good at is slowly wiping out the middle class.
[02:02:33.762 --> 02:02:36.424]  And you can see that all over the world.
[02:02:36.424 --> 02:02:39.285]  And so that's what I'm concerned about.
[02:02:39.285 --> 02:02:42.547]  And I'm especially concerned about the loss of all the
[02:02:43.047 --> 02:02:43.647]  Agenda 21!
[02:02:43.647 --> 02:02:44.508]  How do we fight that?
[02:02:44.508 --> 02:02:44.748]  Yes, sir!
[02:03:13.627 --> 02:03:26.435]  Also, we keep taking property, more and more property off the tax rolls at the same time the schools and the police and so forth are coming to us wanting increased funding and that just, it just doesn't work.
[02:03:26.435 --> 02:03:40.343]  I mean the federal government now owns or controls over 30% of the land in this country and state and local governments and quasi-governmental agencies own another, or control another 20% so you've got half the land in some type of public ownership and that's a
[02:03:41.178 --> 02:03:42.959]  Well, my view is that it's going to be much better.
[02:03:55.396 --> 02:03:56.177]  We're good to go.
[02:04:18.221 --> 02:04:19.883]  Uh, we need to do as much as we can.
[02:04:19.883 --> 02:04:26.008]  And, you know, we had that $862 billion stimulus package that didn't work.
[02:04:26.008 --> 02:04:30.211]  CNN polls said only 7% of the American people felt it had helped them.
[02:04:30.211 --> 02:04:33.974]  But the reason was, almost all of it, first of all, 41 or 42% had to be borrowed.
[02:04:36.136 --> 02:04:36.877]  Absolutely.
[02:04:36.877 --> 02:04:39.139]  Representative John Duncan, have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:04:39.139 --> 02:04:39.680]  God bless you.

[02:07:00.356 --> 02:07:04.197]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.

[02:07:08.458 --> 02:07:13.178]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:07:13.178 --> 02:07:19.099]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:19.099 --> 02:07:22.760]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:26.181]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:28.912 --> 02:07:34.434]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:34.434 --> 02:07:36.374]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:07:36.374 --> 02:07:38.855]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:38.855 --> 02:07:43.276]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:07:43.276 --> 02:07:47.017]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:07:54.853 --> 02:08:01.324]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:08:01.324 --> 02:08:06.733]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.733 --> 02:08:09.016]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:14.608 --> 02:08:20.116]  Well, it's the eve of Thanksgiving, giving thanks for our free republic.
[02:08:20.116 --> 02:08:27.425]  I'm very excited about the TSA situation because it's showing people that they can get together, get angry, and have an effect.
[02:08:27.425 --> 02:08:29.408]  There are record numbers of people not flying.
[02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:32.871]  Triple A reports that's making the system very mad.
[02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:35.393]  So they're running a spin that nobody's angry.
[02:08:35.393 --> 02:08:36.653]  This isn't a story.
[02:08:36.653 --> 02:08:38.475]  We're not putting our hands down your pants.
[02:08:38.475 --> 02:08:40.356]  There is no radiation.
[02:08:40.356 --> 02:08:44.078]  And we've got this latest article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:44.078 --> 02:08:47.081]  I tell you, Paul Watson is just on fire over there.
[02:08:47.081 --> 02:08:51.904]  Big Sis wants behavior scanners at sporting events and malls.
[02:08:54.113 --> 02:08:56.575]  And she's also announced she wants TSA checkpoints.
[02:08:56.575 --> 02:08:57.896]  They've already been beta testing it.
[02:08:57.896 --> 02:08:58.816]  I told you it was coming.
[02:08:58.816 --> 02:09:00.277]  Now it's all over the news.
[02:09:00.277 --> 02:09:07.322]  DHS seeks to read mal-tent at interrogation checkpoints.
[02:09:07.322 --> 02:09:11.745]  Now, they just had one of these behavior experts
[02:09:12.686 --> 02:09:13.026]  I don't
[02:09:28.473 --> 02:09:43.061]  They'll take the people that think they're God or beat on their chest and say, I have power, or a TSA employee based in Atlanta's Hartfield-Jackson International Airport tried to kill himself after allegedly abducting a woman, sexually assaulting her, then giving her a suicide note.
[02:09:43.061 --> 02:09:47.883]  She was in the little outfit that he'd put her in and had the, what do they call it here?
[02:09:47.883 --> 02:09:53.386]  They call it the leopard pattern novelty handcuffs, where the sexual assault occurred.
[02:09:53.386 --> 02:09:55.087]  She escaped to the police department.
[02:09:56.630 --> 02:09:59.180]  With a note from him saying he was going to commit suicide.
[02:10:00.732 --> 02:10:08.939]  And I mean, I'm not kidding, it says a bound woman who was still bound in leopard print novelty handcuffs.
[02:10:08.939 --> 02:10:13.183]  So I guess this guy isn't a god, though, or he'd be getting away with this.
[02:10:13.183 --> 02:10:17.326]  So that's the new behavior controllers we're going to have.
[02:10:17.326 --> 02:10:21.229]  Big Sis wants behavior scanners at sporting events malls.
[02:10:21.229 --> 02:10:26.254]  And of course, they're also rolling out the 500 mobile scanners looking through your walls, and they have the National Guard out
[02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:29.772]  Affecting 2,000 plus arrests in New York State alone.
[02:10:29.772 --> 02:10:30.993]  That's Fox News.
[02:10:30.993 --> 02:10:33.155]  Driving people under scanners while they're in it.
[02:10:33.155 --> 02:10:39.881]  But, you know, the government just waves a magic pixie dust wand like a tooth fairy and says, there's no radiation here.
[02:10:39.881 --> 02:10:41.363]  Everything's fine.
[02:10:41.363 --> 02:10:43.765]  You don't need a parachute to jump out of an airplane now.
[02:10:43.765 --> 02:10:44.345]  We say so.
[02:10:45.146 --> 02:10:47.327]  You don't need water to live in the desert.
[02:10:47.327 --> 02:10:48.167]  You'll live forever.
[02:10:48.167 --> 02:10:48.927]  We're the government.
[02:10:48.927 --> 02:10:49.988]  We say so.
[02:10:49.988 --> 02:10:53.569]  Look, we hired obese goons to stick their hands down your pants.
[02:10:53.569 --> 02:10:54.909]  We say so.
[02:10:54.909 --> 02:11:01.611]  Homeland Security Chief Janet Napolitano admitted yesterday that body scanners would eventually find their way into U.S.
[02:11:01.611 --> 02:11:03.672]  public transport, trains and boats.
[02:11:03.672 --> 02:11:09.714]  Big Sis is already trailing technology that goes even further.
[02:11:11.448 --> 02:11:12.749]  Now I guess that's a British term.
[02:11:12.749 --> 02:11:14.489]  Sometimes he puts British-isms in these articles.
[02:11:14.489 --> 02:11:15.370]  I don't understand.
[02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:17.591]  Big Sister's already trailing technology?
[02:11:17.591 --> 02:11:21.813]  We might want to call Watson and have him change that to testing.
[02:11:21.813 --> 02:11:25.795]  Because, uh, I don't really get it.
[02:11:25.795 --> 02:11:28.636]  You know, Ron Paul is not only an economist.
[02:11:28.636 --> 02:11:30.157]  Ron Paul is not only a doctor.
[02:11:32.054 --> 02:11:40.118]  Ron Paul is not only a baseball player, Ron Paul is also a spell checker and English teacher.
[02:11:40.118 --> 02:11:59.367]  We got a nice email this morning thanking us for the article about Ron Paul being groped, that's on Drudge, because he's very angry about them groping him, but telling us that proper English is rain in, R-E-I-N, or how do you spell it, versus rain with a G, which means raining.
[02:11:59.927 --> 02:12:06.136]  So Ron Paul is now spell-checking or doing the English on our articles as well.
[02:12:06.136 --> 02:12:08.219]  That guy literally works 18 hours a day, folks.
[02:12:08.219 --> 02:12:09.000]  No exaggeration.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:09.821]  He's 75 now, isn't he?
[02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:10.762]  I mean, how does Ron Paul do this?
[02:12:17.967 --> 02:12:18.247]  I don't know.
[02:12:38.183 --> 02:12:40.444]  Over their lives.
[02:12:40.444 --> 02:12:48.307]  By illustrating the absurdity of them naked body scanning you and groping you, it's a lot less absurd to just strip down into your underwear.
[02:12:48.307 --> 02:12:50.968]  And then they still will pat you down even if you insist.
[02:12:50.968 --> 02:12:53.629]  They're so crazy that they're letting people do that.
[02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:54.689]  Oh yeah, strip down.
[02:12:54.689 --> 02:13:04.273]  Yeah, we had the rain, like a reigning king in there, and it's actually R-E-I-N.
[02:13:04.273 --> 02:13:07.214]  His quote, and insist we rain in the TSA.
[02:13:09.486 --> 02:13:14.949]  Oh man, you know it's crazy when Ron Paul's spell-checking our English... He's like our English teacher now.
[02:13:14.949 --> 02:13:18.491]  I just... You gotta admit, that's funny.
[02:13:18.491 --> 02:13:20.812]  Maybe now that Ron Paul has noticed these types... But you know what?
[02:13:20.812 --> 02:13:21.693]  Our writers are awesome.
[02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:25.015]  They're writing so many articles with so much key info, you're gonna have stuff like that in there.
[02:13:26.595 --> 02:13:37.665]  But I don't get Big Sis is already trailing technology that goes even further by forcing Americans to undergo a behavioral interrogation before they're allowed to enter sporting events, rock concerts, and shopping malls.
[02:13:37.665 --> 02:13:49.616]  They've already ordered hundreds of these giant mobile 18-wheeler trailers with brain scanners and body scanners they have met rolling out, and it says to get in a concert or a football game.
[02:13:49.616 --> 02:13:50.817]  Again, this is a joke!
[02:13:52.142 --> 02:13:59.030]  You know, I got invited out to KSCO, a great station out in Santa Cruz, and they said, what kind of security do you want?
[02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:02.874]  I said, one cop.
[02:14:02.874 --> 02:14:08.360]  And then they said, well, the police don't get paid here in Santa Cruz.
[02:14:09.591 --> 02:14:15.174]  Then the police still showed up, the sheriff's department, a bunch of security, and they wanted to do pat-downs for people going in.
[02:14:15.174 --> 02:14:17.515]  They were real nice, but I was like, please don't do this.
[02:14:17.515 --> 02:14:18.416]  They're like, we must do it.
[02:14:18.416 --> 02:14:20.156]  We must do it for your safety.
[02:14:20.156 --> 02:14:21.357]  And you know what?
[02:14:21.357 --> 02:14:23.098]  I was like, no, do not do it.
[02:14:23.098 --> 02:14:23.998]  Do not do it.
[02:14:23.998 --> 02:14:25.859]  I do not want them to be patted down.
[02:14:25.859 --> 02:14:26.360]  I do not!
[02:14:27.301 --> 02:14:30.103]  I want to live free, outside of fear.
[02:14:30.103 --> 02:14:31.604]  You can't protect me.
[02:14:31.604 --> 02:14:41.649]  I had a much better chance of dying driving around on those windy roads from Northern California where I was up there doing an investigation in the days before I gave the speech.
[02:14:41.649 --> 02:14:45.932]  I almost had probably 15 head-on collisions in the rain and the wind, the highway.
[02:14:45.932 --> 02:14:50.474]  We were having bad weather while I was there, driving down these windy roads with cars coming out of their lanes.
[02:14:50.474 --> 02:14:54.877]  I mean, you can have a TSA guy there, you know, standing in the middle of the lane to make sure I don't wreck.
[02:14:54.877 --> 02:14:56.258]  I mean, the world is dangerous.
[02:14:58.376 --> 02:14:59.817]  Anyways, they were great folks, I'm not complaining.
[02:14:59.817 --> 02:15:02.437]  The point is, I'm not complaining about the radio station.
[02:15:02.437 --> 02:15:09.760]  I was complaining about 20 cops to protect me and acting like I was the president and grabbing me and carrying me in, you know, up to the podium each time.
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:11.180]  I was having to hide.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:13.681]  I'd try to go to the bathroom, they'd be following me.
[02:15:13.681 --> 02:15:17.062]  I mean, a lot of them were fans, but it's just crazy.
[02:15:17.062 --> 02:15:18.143]  I want freedom, okay?
[02:15:19.192 --> 02:15:22.154]  I mean, I don't need a TSA person in my pants to keep me safe.
[02:15:22.154 --> 02:15:24.335]  Literally, government in your pants.
[02:15:24.335 --> 02:15:25.616]  But this is an incredible article.
[02:15:25.616 --> 02:15:33.280]  I think the tighter we get on aviation, we have to also be thinking about going on to mass transit or the trains or maritime.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.622]  So that we do need to be doing to strengthen our protections there, said Napolitano.
[02:15:37.622 --> 02:15:40.064]  And Pistol, the head of TSA, said the same thing.
[02:15:40.064 --> 02:15:44.326]  Mobile x-ray scanners have already hit the streets with more than 500 backscatter x-ray scanners.
[02:15:44.326 --> 02:15:45.247]  He just goes through it all.
[02:15:46.718 --> 02:15:55.669]  You think they're going to stop with pulling your colostomy bag off or pulling your artificial breast off from breast cancer or sticking their hands in your sutures or groping your two-year-old?
[02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:57.792]  That's the beginning!
[02:15:57.792 --> 02:16:00.034]  They want to take your blood to get a driver's license.
[02:16:00.034 --> 02:16:01.356]  They want to take your blood at checkpoints.
[02:16:01.356 --> 02:16:03.899]  They take your baby's blood for 39 years at birth.
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:10.904]  I want to come back in the next segment, jam a few calls, and Webster Tarp was coming on about all of this, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up briefly.
[02:16:10.904 --> 02:16:20.409]  Gold's basically holding steady where it was yesterday, going way up, and I just want to encourage people with all that's happening in the economy to get involved in gold and silver today.
[02:16:20.409 --> 02:16:22.450]  Here's the headline out of the China Daily.
[02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:24.631]  That's one of the, basically, government mouthpiece.
[02:16:24.631 --> 02:16:26.552]  China, Russia quit dollar.
[02:16:26.552 --> 02:16:29.294]  All their business with each other is now not going to be in the dollar.
[02:16:29.634 --> 02:16:36.540]  The world is going away from the dollar because the Federal Reserve that runs us is devaluing it and they know and are upset.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:40.263]  Ted, what does this mean to have China and Russia announce they are leaving the dollar now?
[02:16:41.021 --> 02:16:45.844]  Well, what it means is that there's a lot of reserves over in Russia and China that will be leaving those countries.
[02:16:45.844 --> 02:16:47.705]  They'll have to sell away the U.S.
[02:16:47.705 --> 02:16:54.950]  dollar and buy, you know, back a currency that's more hard and something that they can trade with, or their own currencies.
[02:16:54.950 --> 02:17:02.315]  And the only reason why the dollar has been able to last this long is because China and places like China have been buying U.S.
[02:17:02.315 --> 02:17:02.835]  Treasuries
[02:17:03.275 --> 02:17:03.375]  Yes.
[02:17:23.685 --> 02:17:26.426]  You know, it's like it has cancer.
[02:17:26.426 --> 02:17:28.567]  They want to get away from it, bottom line.
[02:17:28.567 --> 02:17:30.288]  They do not want to own the U.S.
[02:17:30.288 --> 02:17:30.888]  dollar.
[02:17:30.888 --> 02:17:40.872]  Unfortunately, us here who have our investments in stocks, bonds, annuities, everything else that is denominated in dollar is going to watch that go into the toilet along with it all.
[02:17:41.212 --> 02:17:46.678]  You know, it makes me just so infuriated when I hear this and I read it.
[02:17:46.678 --> 02:17:48.560]  Because I'm reading the same stuff you are.
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:52.264]  We were the number one superpower in the world and still should be.
[02:17:52.264 --> 02:18:03.035]  But this nation has taken the wrong turn in 1913, went to a fiat printing system in 1971, and the thing has done nothing but go into the toilet.
[02:18:05.197 --> 02:18:05.717]  Absolutely, Ted.
[02:18:29.594 --> 02:18:31.354]  People need to call in at Gold and Silver.
[02:18:31.354 --> 02:18:32.875]  You've got the best deals out there.

[02:19:20.756 --> 02:19:22.437]  We have the Walking Liberty Hefts.
[02:19:22.877 --> 02:19:25.299]  Case anybody looked, silver is up today.
[02:19:25.299 --> 02:19:26.880]  It's been as high as $27.66.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:30.062]  It is going through the roof.
[02:19:30.062 --> 02:19:32.444]  Silver walking liberty halves are at $12.84.
[02:19:32.444 --> 02:19:34.986]  The Lakota Nation coins are still available at $34.
[02:19:34.986 --> 02:19:39.129]  You know, $20 liberties and $10 liberties.
[02:19:39.129 --> 02:19:42.251]  You know, this is the stuff that we stock.
[02:19:42.771 --> 02:19:45.294]  Absolutely, you can't beat these deals folks.
[02:19:45.294 --> 02:19:47.457]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:47.457 --> 02:19:48.758]  Get into Precious Metals today.
[02:19:48.758 --> 02:19:52.783]  And if there was any profit in this, it would support a good cause, the radio network and my show.
[02:19:52.783 --> 02:19:54.866]  But at these deals, it's a lost leader.
[02:19:54.866 --> 02:19:55.226]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:55.226 --> 02:19:59.291]  Ted, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:19:59.291 --> 02:20:00.573]  We'll come back jamming a few calls.
[02:20:03.564 --> 02:20:04.784]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.784 --> 02:20:07.305]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:07.305 --> 02:20:09.186]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.

[02:20:40.156 --> 02:20:40.877]  But listen up.
[02:20:40.877 --> 02:20:47.100]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.941]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:48.941 --> 02:20:51.102]  That's hideyourguns.com.

[02:22:05.461 --> 02:22:08.683]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:08.683 --> 02:22:13.788]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.788 --> 02:22:17.971]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.291 --> 02:22:20.634]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.634 --> 02:22:23.518]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.518 --> 02:22:26.442]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.442 --> 02:22:34.052]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.372 --> 02:22:39.754]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.754 --> 02:22:42.614]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.614 --> 02:22:46.295]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.295 --> 02:22:47.376]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.376 --> 02:22:48.716]  You're everyone else.

[02:24:12.546 --> 02:24:15.688]  We got the Tarbster, Doc Tarb, joining us.
[02:24:15.688 --> 02:24:18.229]  Coming up with key intel in the next segment.
[02:24:18.229 --> 02:24:19.409]  Gamming a few calls as well.
[02:24:19.409 --> 02:24:20.930]  Let's go to your calls now.
[02:24:20.930 --> 02:24:25.472]  Noah in Oklahoma during National No Fly No Grope Day.
[02:24:25.472 --> 02:24:26.993]  Welcome, Noah.
[02:24:26.993 --> 02:24:28.094]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:28.094 --> 02:24:33.356]  I appreciate everything you do for us and thank God for that senator you just had on.
[02:24:33.356 --> 02:24:34.617]  Congressman, yeah, he's a great guy.
[02:24:35.387 --> 02:24:36.968]  Congressman, I'm sorry.
[02:24:36.968 --> 02:24:37.928]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:37.928 --> 02:24:47.353]  I just wanted to give you a quick tip and all your listeners about, you know how you've been talking about the unhygienic-ness of the, you know, they're using the same gloves to check everybody.
[02:24:47.353 --> 02:24:53.557]  Well, my grandma just died of MRSA and people don't realize how serious MRSA is.
[02:24:53.557 --> 02:24:53.977]  That's right.
[02:24:53.977 --> 02:24:59.700]  Much worse than crabs or things like that is flesh-eating bacteria.
[02:25:00.558 --> 02:25:09.103]  Yes, and she, not only that, but my father was actually taking care of her and now he's got it.
[02:25:09.103 --> 02:25:10.364]  It's that contagious.
[02:25:10.364 --> 02:25:12.585]  I mean he's pretty, you know, God take care of him.
[02:25:13.397 --> 02:25:19.979]  No, no, this is a point I've made for months and asked our great writers to do stories on, but WorldNetDaily did it and finally it's getting attention.
[02:25:19.979 --> 02:25:31.802]  But we need a story about MRSA, flesh-eating bacteria, you know it's being spread by the airports, and a story in the same article about taking your shoes off where thousands of people are from all over the world
[02:25:32.202 --> 02:25:35.785]  Picking up all of their bacteria and all of their fungus.
[02:25:35.785 --> 02:25:37.046]  This is disgusting!
[02:25:37.046 --> 02:25:43.331]  And the government who always obsesses during flu season about washing your hands and all this, they're not spraying stuff on the floor.
[02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:46.554]  They're not mopping it every time because they don't care.
[02:25:46.554 --> 02:25:49.576]  It's a disease factory!
[02:25:49.576 --> 02:25:50.497]  Exactly.
[02:25:50.497 --> 02:26:00.265]  And it's so serious that right now my father's trying to find some help that, I mean, even the doctors are, you know, kind of trying to downplay it to not scare the public.
[02:26:00.871 --> 02:26:01.031]  I mean...
[02:26:35.054 --> 02:26:39.237]  It really is.
[02:26:39.237 --> 02:26:46.643]  Well, I just wanted to give people that tip and just be sure that when you go, you better bring some kind of silver or oil of oregano or something.
[02:26:46.643 --> 02:26:53.068]  But the other point I wanted to make was I called last week about having the Infowarriors call into South
[02:26:53.148 --> 02:26:56.810]  There's nothing like having some guy stick his hand down your pants to make you angry.
[02:27:21.653 --> 02:27:22.494]  Exactly!
[02:27:22.494 --> 02:27:28.858]  And so I took my own advice, so I called into a show, and I was able to talk to that guy without being cut off.
[02:27:28.858 --> 02:27:29.918]  No, I agree.
[02:27:29.918 --> 02:27:34.061]  People should hit the regional shows, the specialty shows, and reach millions.
[02:27:34.061 --> 02:27:35.242]  Good points.
[02:27:35.242 --> 02:27:36.943]  Good job there, Noah.
[02:27:36.943 --> 02:27:39.404]  Let's go ahead and go to some more calls here.
[02:27:39.404 --> 02:27:40.945]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:27:40.945 --> 02:27:42.887]  George, you're on the air.
[02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:43.527]  Hi, Alex.
[02:27:43.527 --> 02:27:46.769]  I thought of another way of upping the ante for these characters.
[02:27:46.769 --> 02:27:50.912]  Why not use every opportunity that people have to go to the airport
[02:27:51.337 --> 02:27:51.737]  I'm good.
[02:28:05.953 --> 02:28:11.720]  But also to the actual TSA guys and say, look guys, you're more vulnerable than we are.
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:14.242]  Your hands are all over the place.
[02:28:14.242 --> 02:28:17.146]  Just because you have rubber gloves because you're next to the scanners.
[02:28:17.146 --> 02:28:18.908]  Drive them crazy.
[02:28:18.908 --> 02:28:21.791]  And then one other thing, take it home demonstrations.
[02:28:22.111 --> 02:28:23.853]  Well, the private jets at the airport.
[02:28:23.853 --> 02:28:25.315]  Good example.
[02:28:25.315 --> 02:28:33.444]  Westchester Airport, right on the borderline, where all the Soros and Clinton and all these guys fly out of because it's right on the border.
[02:28:33.444 --> 02:28:34.305]  That's right.
[02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:35.767]  Tardos lives right there, yeah.
[02:28:36.584 --> 02:28:42.826]  Yeah, and they both live in Bedford just above Greenwich, so I mean the Beverly Hills of our area.
[02:28:42.826 --> 02:28:48.028]  Anyway, if you hit that airport and say, look, why is it that we have to go through this crap?
[02:28:48.028 --> 02:28:48.768]  And they do.
[02:28:48.768 --> 02:28:56.271]  Now these Saudi princes who funded this stuff, they could fly in one of their private jets with bombs and everything like that and blow up the whole friggin' airport.
[02:28:58.254 --> 02:28:58.974]  Exactly!
[02:28:58.974 --> 02:29:01.996]  Expose the hypocrisy, expose the fraud.
[02:29:01.996 --> 02:29:03.477]  We beat them on this issue.
[02:29:03.477 --> 02:29:05.598]  We beat them on all the issues.
[02:29:05.598 --> 02:29:09.600]  And if they can sell this absurdity, the sky is the limit.
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:11.080]  Great points.
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:12.401]  I appreciate your call, George.
[02:29:12.401 --> 02:29:19.765]  I want to say this right now about this whole situation and what we have going on with the TSA.
[02:29:22.145 --> 02:29:24.667]  And I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[02:29:24.667 --> 02:29:25.908]  This is the big fight.
[02:29:25.908 --> 02:29:28.370]  This is a lot bigger than just the TSA.
[02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:31.692]  It's about out-of-control federalization.
[02:29:31.692 --> 02:29:33.294]  It's about being radiated.
[02:29:33.294 --> 02:29:35.875]  It's about the government violating your space.
[02:29:35.875 --> 02:29:43.581]  It's about them selling absurdity and creating a pretext to totally take over our society.
[02:29:43.581 --> 02:29:50.066]  And I got a laundry list of other points, but it's a circus out there today and I've got something else key I want to say about TSA when we come back.
[02:29:50.066 --> 02:29:50.467]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.633 --> 02:29:55.565]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.565 --> 02:29:58.254]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.206 --> 02:30:05.749]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.749 --> 02:30:06.669]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.669 --> 02:30:10.092]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.092 --> 02:30:10.952]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.952 --> 02:30:15.835]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.835 --> 02:30:16.596]  It's true.
[02:30:16.596 --> 02:30:21.459]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.459 --> 02:30:22.279]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.279 --> 02:30:25.882]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.882 --> 02:30:29.564]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.764 --> 02:30:30.565]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.565 --> 02:30:33.328]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.328 --> 02:30:37.012]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.012 --> 02:30:37.813]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.813 --> 02:30:41.958]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.958 --> 02:30:46.723]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.003 --> 02:30:51.169]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.169 --> 02:30:52.951]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.951 --> 02:30:55.214]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:55.214 --> 02:30:57.558]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.854 --> 02:31:17.331]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.331 --> 02:31:21.015]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:22.014 --> 02:31:34.786]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.786 --> 02:31:42.053]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:42.734 --> 02:31:53.117]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:53.117 --> 02:31:57.039]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:57.039 --> 02:32:00.140]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:32:00.851 --> 02:32:05.034]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:05.034 --> 02:32:11.459]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:11.459 --> 02:32:18.845]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.845 --> 02:32:23.708]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:23.708 --> 02:32:25.850]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:28.652 --> 02:32:32.380]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:36.107]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:36.618 --> 02:32:43.401]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:43.401 --> 02:32:47.282]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:47.282 --> 02:32:53.024]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:53.024 --> 02:32:53.264]  Thank you.
[02:33:02.065 --> 02:33:07.119]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:31.144 --> 02:33:35.202]  It looks like a little angel came popping on the floor.
[02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:42.584]  Webster Griffin Tarbley is going to be riding shotgun with us for the rest of this hour at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:42.584 --> 02:34:03.818]  You better believe the circus that is the TSA molestation as they try to impart this mass mental illness of paranoia that there are all these terrorists wanting to get us so they can then set the precedent to put TSA into every airport, every bus terminal, every train station, every highway, every mall, every school.
[02:34:03.818 --> 02:34:04.879]  It's all being announced.
[02:34:04.879 --> 02:34:05.980]  They're going to be everywhere.
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:10.543]  As we warned you, Big Sis is now laying it out.
[02:34:10.543 --> 02:34:13.825]  But I wanted to make this point before we go to Tarpley.
[02:34:13.825 --> 02:34:16.326]  There's all these articles out today.
[02:34:16.326 --> 02:34:20.209]  Airport security moving smoothly despite opt-out day.
[02:34:20.209 --> 02:34:22.470]  And the message is you failed.
[02:34:22.470 --> 02:34:25.212]  People aren't trying to slow down the airports.
[02:34:25.212 --> 02:34:26.633]  Some have said that's their goal.
[02:34:26.633 --> 02:34:29.215]  The goal is to say no and not use your machines.
[02:34:30.148 --> 02:34:31.509]  But it's not just opt-out.
[02:34:31.509 --> 02:34:34.231]  We're saying don't put your hands on our genitals.
[02:34:34.231 --> 02:34:37.313]  Then it's, oh, we'll try to charge you $11,000.
[02:34:37.313 --> 02:34:39.354]  That's if you leave the area.
[02:34:39.354 --> 02:34:40.915]  So you sit there and you argue with them.
[02:34:40.915 --> 02:34:42.496]  You come two hours early.
[02:34:42.496 --> 02:34:43.357]  You educate them.
[02:34:43.357 --> 02:34:44.898]  You resist.
[02:34:44.898 --> 02:34:47.740]  Fox News, all of them are like, oh, go ahead and submit.
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:49.761]  Don't slow down the airports.
[02:34:49.761 --> 02:34:52.323]  NBC says 98% in the poll.
[02:34:52.323 --> 02:34:52.863]  Love it.
[02:34:52.863 --> 02:34:54.865]  But other polls that are scientific show 61, 72, 96% against.
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.041]  On the street, it's got to be 90% against it, what I'm seeing.
[02:35:02.041 --> 02:35:06.562]  So there's this hoax, because they know if they can make you submit to this, they can do anything.
[02:35:06.562 --> 02:35:14.865]  Now, already, in El Paso a few months ago, they said everyone will be put to the naked body scanners.
[02:35:14.865 --> 02:35:18.366]  The TSA admits to the Chicago Tribune, they plan on making everyone do it.
[02:35:20.376 --> 02:35:27.819]  And so, yes, during big peak times, they always open up the regular lanes and don't put everybody through the scanners.
[02:35:27.819 --> 02:35:29.679]  Most of the airports don't have them yet.
[02:35:29.679 --> 02:35:31.220]  Austin gets theirs next month.
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:34.861]  And I ain't going through, and nobody's putting their hands on my genitals.
[02:35:34.861 --> 02:35:38.002]  Got it?
[02:35:38.002 --> 02:35:38.883]  I'm not a terrorist.
[02:35:38.883 --> 02:35:42.144]  Your bosses that run this country staged the terror attacks.
[02:35:42.144 --> 02:35:43.724]  I've got the evidence.
[02:35:43.724 --> 02:35:45.265]  And you're funding the other extremists.
[02:35:46.257 --> 02:35:48.779]  The government's on record protecting the underwear bomber.
[02:35:48.779 --> 02:35:52.861]  And we're all a lockies hanging out at the Pentagon.
[02:35:52.861 --> 02:35:55.663]  Now, that's what they're doing.
[02:35:55.663 --> 02:35:56.544]  Number one, they lie.
[02:35:56.544 --> 02:35:58.985]  They say, you know, we're not putting our hands in your pants.
[02:35:58.985 --> 02:35:59.766]  They admit they are.
[02:35:59.766 --> 02:36:01.006]  There's no radiation danger.
[02:36:01.006 --> 02:36:02.787]  Liars, liars, liars, liars.
[02:36:02.787 --> 02:36:05.149]  So them saying it isn't slowing it down.
[02:36:05.149 --> 02:36:08.111]  Then I've got other reports that the airports are locked up all over the country.
[02:36:08.111 --> 02:36:09.772]  A lot of it winter storms.
[02:36:09.772 --> 02:36:10.953]  They're just a pack of liars.
[02:36:11.593 --> 02:36:13.274]  So they can do whatever they want.
[02:36:13.274 --> 02:36:15.635]  It's not about security, it's about making you submit.
[02:36:15.635 --> 02:36:16.996]  We're going to Tarpley here in a moment.
[02:36:16.996 --> 02:36:21.019]  I first want to tell you about Diamond Gusset Jeans made in America.
[02:36:21.019 --> 02:36:22.940]  Our great sponsor, Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:37:01.482 --> 02:37:04.085]  Continuing, I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com.
[02:37:04.085 --> 02:37:08.049]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com.

[02:39:10.848 --> 02:39:13.649]  Let's get Tarpley's view on this and then the TSA.
[02:39:13.649 --> 02:39:14.769]  Webster, good to have you here with us.
[02:39:37.816 --> 02:39:38.638]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:39:38.638 --> 02:39:48.196]  Maybe I could just say first, concerning this circus, as you say, in the airports, just two facts to remember that might have gotten lost after all these months.
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:40:09.136]  You remember, a couple of days after Muttalab was nabbed on Christmas Day, we had this guy, Richard Wolff, this effete British fellow who talks to Olbermann on MSNBC, and he came out and said, my sources in the White House tell me that this incident was deliberately created.
[02:40:09.136 --> 02:40:15.060]  And then he said, we think to make Obama look bad, but the heart of the analysis was correct.
[02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:15.821]  The incident was
[02:40:16.281 --> 02:40:24.648]  Deliberately created, and that was on MSNBC cable news within a week or ten days after the incident had occurred.
[02:40:24.648 --> 02:40:26.469]  And then, of course, it was covered up.
[02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:33.275]  But there was a moment where even the Obama White House realized that the rogue network had created this.
[02:40:33.275 --> 02:40:43.423]  The second thing is, in actual hearings in front of a House committee, Patrick Kennedy, the Deputy Secretary of State for Consular Affairs for visas,
[02:40:44.319 --> 02:40:44.539]  I'm good.
[02:40:56.371 --> 02:41:02.558]  Because he's now in Yemen and he's going to different terror camps and so forth.
[02:41:02.558 --> 02:41:04.780]  So we want to take the visa away.
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:12.669]  And the answer came from an unnamed agency, still unnamed as far as I know, saying, no, no, don't touch him.
[02:41:12.669 --> 02:41:14.331]  We've got eyes on him.
[02:41:14.331 --> 02:41:15.432]  We're following him.
[02:41:15.432 --> 02:41:16.433]  He's a little fish.
[02:41:16.793 --> 02:41:18.674]  He'll lead us to the big fish.
[02:41:18.674 --> 02:41:20.855]  It's essential that you not take his visa away.
[02:41:20.855 --> 02:41:36.622]  Of course, if you took the guy's visa away, he couldn't get on the plane, and therefore no incident, no circus, no hysteria, and no opportunity for Chertoff to go on television and say, now it's time for these full-body scanners and so forth.
[02:41:36.622 --> 02:41:39.663]  So, this was a manufactured incident.
[02:41:40.403 --> 02:41:45.488]  Uh, and people should remember this, that there was, there's no basis for what they're doing.
[02:41:45.488 --> 02:41:47.650]  We don't need body scanners.
[02:41:47.650 --> 02:41:49.411]  We need mold detectors.
[02:41:49.411 --> 02:41:59.079]  We've got to have mold detectors installed at the FBI and the National Security Agency and the National Security Council and throughout the government, right?
[02:41:59.079 --> 02:42:00.841]  Mold detectors to know if people
[02:42:01.441 --> 02:42:03.904]  Well, Webster, where do you see all of this going?
[02:42:26.255 --> 02:42:31.599]  Well, again, look back to the 1930s.
[02:42:31.599 --> 02:42:35.982]  You can see this three-phase process, right?
[02:42:35.982 --> 02:42:42.267]  Depression, economic depression, followed by dictatorship, followed by world war.
[02:42:42.267 --> 02:42:48.332]  And the big problem we have right now is we're in the depression phase, but we can see the dictatorship elements.
[02:42:49.449 --> 02:42:50.569]  We're good to go.
[02:43:11.574 --> 02:43:16.839]  I think the ultimate thing is, the only way to fight this is you've got to get out of the depression.
[02:43:16.839 --> 02:43:25.866]  You've got to have a broad-based economic recovery, a return to full employment, a return to prosperity, a return to expanding standards of living.
[02:43:25.866 --> 02:43:32.151]  Because if you don't do that, the forces in the society pushing towards police states become overwhelming.
[02:43:32.151 --> 02:43:35.494]  Just one example, we've got this fraud closure crisis going on.
[02:43:37.213 --> 02:43:39.435]  Talk about the sanctity of private property.
[02:43:39.435 --> 02:43:40.896]  Yeah, there should be that.
[02:43:40.896 --> 02:43:42.618]  And there should be the rule of law.
[02:43:42.618 --> 02:43:53.187]  But right now we have a zombie banker who can come with fake paperwork and essentially steal your house with the help of a robo-judge and a robo-signer and a bunch of corrupt people.
[02:43:53.187 --> 02:44:01.293]  I mean, that's the issue, is that there's almost, in history, in these cycles, a time when the ruling class just goes insane, hires secret police.
[02:44:02.034 --> 02:44:02.234]  Just
[02:44:19.716 --> 02:44:21.037]  Look at Ireland.
[02:44:21.037 --> 02:44:25.059]  They're now openly saying, we want foreign banks to run Ireland.
[02:44:25.059 --> 02:44:25.960]  That's the best way.
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:30.462]  So the banks that have engineered their collapse are now being praised as the solution.
[02:44:30.462 --> 02:44:35.825]  Economic conquest is sold as if it's some type of wonderful thing.
[02:44:35.825 --> 02:44:38.987]  And no one stops the crazy elites.
[02:44:38.987 --> 02:44:46.851]  And then they're just going to drive us into a chutzpah or arrogance or bravado-filled World War III.
[02:44:46.851 --> 02:44:47.592]  I mean, I guess that's it.
[02:44:48.598 --> 02:45:02.806]  Certainly in the case of Ireland, if you have a government that comes forward with an austerity plan that consciously and deliberately says they're going to destroy 12% of the gross national product of Ireland in the year 2011.
[02:45:02.806 --> 02:45:07.289]  Yeah, yeah, just to be clear, they say we're going into receivership to foreign banks.
[02:45:07.289 --> 02:45:12.311]  That was in Reuters with government officials saying we believe foreign banks should run us.
[02:45:12.311 --> 02:45:14.513]  I mean, this is now just brazen.
[02:45:14.513 --> 02:45:15.513]  We are sellouts.
[02:45:15.513 --> 02:45:16.374]  We are tyrants.
[02:45:17.054 --> 02:45:20.236]  And the banks that are taking over are the ones that engineered it.
[02:45:20.236 --> 02:45:30.304]  I mean, that's why they were brought into the EU, so they could do this raping, and next is Portugal, next is Spain, then England, then France, then Germany.
[02:45:30.304 --> 02:45:31.385]  Correct, Webster?
[02:45:31.385 --> 02:45:31.985]  Yes, certainly.
[02:45:31.985 --> 02:45:36.849]  And the thing, though, is that the forces that resist this need a program.
[02:45:36.849 --> 02:45:38.310]  For example, today in Portugal,
[02:45:39.102 --> 02:45:51.549]  We have reportedly the biggest labor action, the biggest general strike in 20 years in Portugal against the idea that a Greek or Irish-style austerity plan will come to them.
[02:45:51.549 --> 02:45:57.432]  The problem is that the people who lead this are the forces of the Second International, the Socialist International.
[02:45:57.432 --> 02:46:00.073]  That means Papandreou in Greece, socialist.
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:07.004]  Socrates in Portugal and other so-called socialists, and then Zapatero in Spain.
[02:46:07.004 --> 02:46:11.306]  And the demands that they make are absolutely inadequate.
[02:46:11.306 --> 02:46:14.288]  You look at the Irish austerity plan.
[02:46:14.288 --> 02:46:18.930]  They want to have the minimum wage reduced for the average person.
[02:46:18.930 --> 02:46:23.013]  They want to have the sales tax go from 21 to 23 percent.
[02:46:23.013 --> 02:46:24.974]  Where's the tax on the banks?
[02:46:24.974 --> 02:46:26.835]  Where's the Wall Street sales tax?
[02:46:26.835 --> 02:46:28.776]  Where's the Tobin tax, the turnover tax?
[02:46:29.336 --> 02:46:36.202]  So Webster, Webster, I want to get back into North Korea, I want to get back into TSA, I want to get back into all this, but specifically
[02:46:53.777 --> 02:46:54.898]  Where do you see this going?
[02:46:54.898 --> 02:47:05.987]  I mean, this is clearly an acceleration of the degeneration towards total global depression as the banks that control the U.S.
[02:47:05.987 --> 02:47:11.511]  continue devaluing the currency, then blaming China and Russia for getting concerned.
[02:47:11.511 --> 02:47:20.458]  And now China and Russia say, when we sell oil or gas to each other, when we sell rare minerals from China that they mine worldwide, Australia and Africa, that they have the biggest
[02:47:21.118 --> 02:47:34.062]  90 plus percent of the production of now, that was a good strategic move, that when they sell finished goods to Russia, it's going to be in their own currencies now, or it's going to be in gold, or it's going to be in SDRs.
[02:47:34.062 --> 02:47:43.064]  I mean, is this not a big signpost we just passed that Putin and the Chinese premier just signed this deal yesterday?
[02:47:43.561 --> 02:47:51.624]  Certainly, the idea that the dollar is indispensable for transfers between China and Russia is just absurd, right?
[02:47:51.624 --> 02:47:59.687]  You'd also wonder, if Russia is selling oil to the European Union, why does the dollar get into that one either?
[02:47:59.687 --> 02:48:13.173]  This stuff is all obsolete and it's absurd, but where it goes is, if you don't stop the Depression, there's no civil liberties argument or, how can I say, anti-dictatorship argument that works.
[02:48:13.673 --> 02:48:17.255]  As long as you have a depression and mass unemployment going on.
[02:48:17.255 --> 02:48:21.997]  You need to have programmatic fight against this kind of... No, I know, Webster.
[02:48:21.997 --> 02:48:26.260]  Every time you come on, no matter what issue it is, and we always appreciate it, you go back to solutions.
[02:48:26.260 --> 02:48:26.880]  We've covered them.
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:28.881]  I mean, we know your ideas to fix this.
[02:48:28.881 --> 02:48:32.003]  I mean, the thing is, you're saying don't drive the bus off the cliff.
[02:48:32.003 --> 02:48:33.724]  The bus has already gone off the cliff.
[02:48:33.724 --> 02:48:35.184]  They're not listening to you.
[02:48:35.184 --> 02:48:39.146]  In fact, they're accelerating what is going to cause the destruction.
[02:48:39.146 --> 02:48:40.227]  So what do we do about that?
[02:48:40.567 --> 02:48:50.571]  I mean, we demonize the bankers because they deserve it, and we expose them in the court of public opinion so people know who is the author of our ruin.
[02:48:50.571 --> 02:48:53.452]  I think that's the most important thing to do.
[02:48:53.452 --> 02:48:58.894]  Certainly, but you've got to have a program to get out of it, and then people have to become politically aware.
[02:48:58.894 --> 02:49:01.315]  So you like Obama's idea of a national train?
[02:49:02.668 --> 02:49:07.070]  Well, no, I mean, he wants this coast-to-coast, you know, speed bullet train.
[02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:19.643]  600 billion dollars.
[02:49:19.643 --> 02:49:26.046]  I say, commandeer that money, and that's your down payment on 100,000 miles of fast rail and maglev.
[02:49:26.046 --> 02:49:28.947]  And this has got nothing to do with Obama.
[02:49:28.947 --> 02:49:30.128]  Obama's a big faker.
[02:49:30.128 --> 02:49:33.430]  Obama brings this up when he can't do it anymore, right?
[02:49:33.430 --> 02:49:37.292]  If he was going to do it, why didn't he do it in the first couple of weeks?
[02:49:37.292 --> 02:49:42.855]  If you started to build 100,000 miles of maglev and fast rail, you'd have an economic recovery.
[02:49:42.855 --> 02:49:45.516]  And people would be able to point to that in their communities all over.
[02:49:45.976 --> 02:49:46.256]  No, I know.
[02:49:46.256 --> 02:49:47.096]  That's why I raised the point.
[02:49:47.096 --> 02:49:49.157]  But they're not doing that from that, you know, classical
[02:50:05.222 --> 02:50:06.643]  I don't think so.
[02:50:22.270 --> 02:50:25.512]  Alright, now this is, I think this is pretty obvious.
[02:50:25.512 --> 02:50:28.715]  This is the kind of circus we've seen again and again and again.
[02:50:28.715 --> 02:50:35.940]  The occasion for this is this maneuver which is held periodically called Hooghook.
[02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:36.701]  H-O-G-U-K.
[02:50:37.361 --> 02:50:38.101]  All right, stay there.
[02:50:38.101 --> 02:50:38.741]  Final segment.
[02:50:38.741 --> 02:50:41.402]  Come back and get into North Korea, because now they're sending a U.S.
[02:50:41.402 --> 02:50:42.342]  carrier.
[02:50:42.342 --> 02:50:50.944]  They're saying they're going to do drills, basically, in the same area, trying to get a provocation from the lunatics in North Korea, proxies for the chi-coms.
[02:50:50.944 --> 02:50:52.824]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest.
[02:50:52.824 --> 02:50:53.805]  It's national.
[02:50:53.805 --> 02:50:55.085]  No fly.
[02:50:55.085 --> 02:50:56.285]  We're not your slaves.
[02:50:56.285 --> 02:50:58.406]  You're not sticking your hand down our pants today.
[02:50:58.406 --> 02:51:01.726]  We'll have all the developments at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:51:01.726 --> 02:51:04.987]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.464 --> 02:51:10.325]  Eighteen years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.325 --> 02:51:16.487]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.487 --> 02:51:18.908]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.908 --> 02:51:25.010]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.010 --> 02:51:28.411]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.411 --> 02:51:30.291]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.291 --> 02:51:32.292]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.472 --> 02:51:38.155]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.
[02:51:38.155 --> 02:51:42.458]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.458 --> 02:51:47.281]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.

[02:51:48.442 --> 02:51:49.142]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:52:05.524 --> 02:52:06.786]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:06.786 --> 02:52:10.650]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.650 --> 02:52:12.953]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:12.953 --> 02:52:18.840]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:25.067]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.487 --> 02:52:31.472]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.472 --> 02:52:35.655]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.655 --> 02:52:39.939]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:39.939 --> 02:52:45.884]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:45.884 --> 02:52:49.447]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.447 --> 02:52:51.408]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.408 --> 02:52:51.849]  It's here.

[02:53:00.455 --> 02:53:00.975]  Fact.
[02:53:00.975 --> 02:53:08.081]  Wood-burning stoves, factory smokestacks, smog, and chemical fumes in the home are all sources of air contamination that can make you sick.
[02:53:08.081 --> 02:53:15.606]  Your exposure to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds every day may be the cause of fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[02:53:15.606 --> 02:53:19.089]  These are bad conditions for the very young, older, and the chemically sensitive.

[02:54:03.809 --> 02:54:22.764]  I just want to say before I go back to Tarpley on this eve of Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks for what's been great about this country and people that have fought and stood up for liberty and freedom and human dignity so that our national flag not be an image of a sheep or an image of an ostrich with its
[02:54:24.145 --> 02:54:25.326]  Head in the sand.
[02:54:25.326 --> 02:54:31.151]  Phil, one of our graphics people, put together what I guess Homeland Security wants to be our new symbol.
[02:54:31.151 --> 02:54:36.936]  In the Stars and Stripes blue area, where the stars would be, we have the ostrich and the sheep as one flag.
[02:54:36.936 --> 02:54:44.782]  And then we also have just the sheep alternate with sheep for the stars.
[02:54:44.782 --> 02:54:48.865]  But I want to commend everybody standing up to Big Brother sticking their hands down their pants.
[02:54:48.865 --> 02:54:50.286]  This has finally broken the trance.
[02:54:51.534 --> 02:54:53.595]  And we're going to have victory against this.
[02:54:53.595 --> 02:54:55.837]  Webster, briefly, because I want to get back into North Korea.
[02:54:55.837 --> 02:54:58.758]  Do you agree that this is a bridge too far?
[02:54:58.758 --> 02:55:05.242]  The system tried to go too far with this social conditioning for the federal takeover by minimum wage gropers?
[02:55:05.242 --> 02:55:11.286]  I think it's certainly a very important backlash, finally, against this.
[02:55:11.286 --> 02:55:13.347]  People are saying it's enough already.
[02:55:13.347 --> 02:55:14.448]  It's too much.
[02:55:14.448 --> 02:55:15.928]  It's a form of strike.
[02:55:15.928 --> 02:55:18.270]  It's Americans finally getting in the streets, in a way.
[02:55:18.850 --> 02:55:23.692]  And notice the unfailing totalitarian instinct of Obama, right?
[02:55:23.692 --> 02:55:31.654]  Immediately, Obama could have said, well, you know, this is some bureaucrat going out on his own, and they went too far, and we've had enough of this, right?
[02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:38.877]  Obama is killing himself politically in order to serve these Wall Street masters, and on this issue, he's doing the same thing.
[02:55:39.797 --> 02:55:49.580]  I hope that this becomes a voting issue, and that people can, you know, these new Republicans, let's put them to the test.
[02:55:49.580 --> 02:55:55.882]  Let them bring in a bill immediately in the first week of January to put a stop to this stuff, and let's vote on it.
[02:55:55.882 --> 02:55:57.902]  And let's see if these people are worth anything, right?
[02:55:57.902 --> 02:56:00.903]  They claim to be populist, all right, let's find out.
[02:56:02.216 --> 02:56:02.836]  Very well said.
[02:56:02.836 --> 02:56:04.077]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[02:56:04.077 --> 02:56:11.161]  And again, folks, we'll continue to cover this throughout Thanksgiving and Friday and into Sunday at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:11.161 --> 02:56:17.504]  I also want to give thanks to the Drudge Report, really pushing this out into the national debate.
[02:56:17.504 --> 02:56:18.945]  That's why they want to censor the Internet.
[02:56:18.945 --> 02:56:20.446]  The White House is announcing that.
[02:56:20.446 --> 02:56:21.687]  Finishing up with North Korea.
[02:56:21.687 --> 02:56:23.308]  I mean, this is pretty scary.
[02:56:23.308 --> 02:56:29.411]  And now we've got more ships going in, more provocations with the lunatic North.
[02:56:29.411 --> 02:56:30.812]  Again, where do you see this going?
[02:56:31.132 --> 02:56:33.414]  Well, the problem is you've now got two lunatics, right?
[02:56:33.414 --> 02:56:41.340]  You have this Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un, and this is, of course, a communist police state, and it's a horrendous situation.
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:51.008]  But you've also got this President Lee of South Korea, who is a warmonger and an oppressor in his own right, and he's... Remember, the dynamic of this is
[02:56:51.548 --> 02:56:59.055]  When the United States wants to increase its control over South Korea and Japan, they gin up a crisis with North Korea.
[02:56:59.055 --> 02:57:03.238]  And North Korea is very predictable, very manipulable.
[02:57:03.238 --> 02:57:08.002]  In this case, it's the HOKUK maneuver, right, which happens periodically.
[02:57:08.002 --> 02:57:11.545]  There have already been shooting incidents as a result of HOKUK in 1999, 2002, and 2009.
[02:57:11.545 --> 02:57:12.486]  It's an area of the...
[02:57:16.289 --> 02:57:27.358]  The western side of the peninsula, it's the Yellow Sea, it's a very ragged border, there are lots of islands, peninsulas, promontories, and of course the line is where the fighting ended in 1953.
[02:57:27.358 --> 02:57:44.591]  So, in the morning yesterday, the North Koreans had sent a fax message saying, don't you guys do your live fire artillery exercise, we consider that to be our territory, don't you fire into our sovereign territory, or we'll shoot back the way we always do.
[02:57:45.951 --> 02:57:51.493]  And then the South Koreans went ahead and started shooting, and then the North began replying.
[02:57:51.493 --> 02:57:56.454]  And in the middle of it all, the North sent a fax to South Korea saying, is this a war?
[02:57:56.454 --> 02:57:57.455]  Are you attacking us?
