[00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:06.131]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.912]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:09.673]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:11.273]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:27.479]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:28.980]  It's Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:44.119]  And the information that I have discovered was so sickening and so shocking that it gave me flashbacks.
[00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:50.562]  Flashbacks to all my research into 9-11, before it happened and then after.
[00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:56.525]  Yesterday, I began to read an article when I got off air
[00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:06.065]  that had just come out from foxnews.com on April 22nd, titled, Shame on Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:12.848]  And I didn't finish reading the story.
[00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:24.973]  And then I got home yesterday evening, put the children to bed, went in and saw somebody had posted a link to it on my Facebook account, or one of our Facebook accounts.
[00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.534]  So I said, I'll go ahead and read that.
[00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.194]  How they're coming after the governor.
[00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:46.688]  And when I got to the second page, I involuntarily started crying.
[00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:49.291]  And my wife has caught this a few times.
[00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.194]  I don't sob and wretch when I cry.
[00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.341]  In fact, I won't even be aware of it if something is particularly upsetting to me, and I'm even focused.
[00:01:57.341 --> 00:02:00.783]  I'm not even in an emotional state, really.
[00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:07.826]  I'm calm and focused, but a certain area of my brain is so upset by it, tears start coming out from the corners of my eyes.
[00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:14.469]  Doesn't happen often.
[00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.070]  But a lot of tears came out.
[00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.791]  A lot of tears.
[00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:27.076]  And I tried to go to bed, and I woke up at 2.30 in the morning, and I couldn't go back to sleep, even though I was exhausted.
[00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:37.203]  I tried to lay on the couch, I tried to go get in the bed.
[00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:40.025]  Couldn't go to sleep.
[00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:44.948]  And so many issues came up with this.
[00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:45.929]  What am I talking about?
[00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:59.789]  It's just another mainstream news reporter admitting that the police and firemen were told that the government was going to blow up Building 7 that day.
[00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:09.031]  Look, I was driving to get a pizza listening to ABC News.
[00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:15.053]  Back then, 590 AM, our local affiliate had ABC.
[00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:15.833]  They have Fox now.
[00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:28.075]  And I heard them just calmly reporting at about 4.15 my time, 5.15 Eastern, that, oh yes, Building 7's so damaged they're going to go ahead and have a controlled demolition of it.
[00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:34.060]  And I was distracted by Tower 1 and 2 that imploded hours before.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.141]  But I thought, that's strange.
[00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:40.385]  It takes weeks or months to wire a building.
[00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:44.449]  And we did point out that day, because I did more than 12 hours of broadcast on Genesis that day,
[00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:53.379]  From about 9 in the morning until past midnight, off and on.
[00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.221]  On different shows.
[00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:10.269]  And we did talk about the strange collapse of 7, but... Then we got the CNN videos of police saying, get back, they're gonna blow it up, and you can hear the bombs going off, and it falls, and see the squibs.
[00:04:12.097 --> 00:04:27.022]  And then we'd always talked about how it was all over TV and radio and folks dug up BBC and CNN saying it was going to fall before it fell.
[00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:33.624]  And then Silverstein, I guess, trying to cover his tracks.
[00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:35.405]  Two years after the attacks went on.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.200]  P.B.S.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.401]  and said, yeah, we made the decision to pull it, gave the order, watch it come down.
[00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:46.422]  And then he changed his story.
[00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:53.525]  And then to just see Fox News having one of their pundits go, yeah, we were talking about blowing it up.
[00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.506]  Man, they all love being part of this.
[00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:57.346]  It's so evil.
[00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:58.447]  So evil.
[00:04:58.447 --> 00:04:58.807]  You people.
[00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:01.414]  What's your home worth?
[00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:03.536]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.578]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:05:06.578 --> 00:05:14.284]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:06.414]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.414 --> 00:06:10.155]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.155 --> 00:06:12.575]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:18.437]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:24.658]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:31.053]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:35.275]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.275 --> 00:06:39.558]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:45.501]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.383]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:49.044 --> 00:06:51.028]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:52.150]  It's here.

[00:07:00.782 --> 00:07:06.423]  Hi, I'm Sarah Atkins, inventor of Better Than Rocks, the one-of-a-kind solution to planter drainage.
[00:07:06.423 --> 00:07:11.885]  A few years ago, I searched for a lightweight product to put in the bottom of my containers to help with drainage.
[00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:16.586]  I found there was nothing on the market, so I decided to develop something myself.
[00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:18.626]  The result is Better Than Rocks.
[00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:26.868]  It keeps soil in, lets excess water out, and helps oxygen reach the plant's roots by creating an air pocket in the bottom of the planter.
[00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:28.182]  Better Than Rocks!
[00:07:58.058 --> 00:08:02.683]  It is Friday, the 23rd day of April 2010.
[00:08:20.413 --> 00:08:32.116]  Everyone who exposed the swine flu, H1N1 hysteria, as a fraud has been vindicated in spades, in triplicate.
[00:08:32.116 --> 00:08:47.940]  It is now all over the mainstream media, Wall Street Journal, you name it, that the whole thing was a fraud, that the big pharma companies paid off the European Union, the US government, the British government, the Canadian government to lie and say it was deadly and that the vaccine itself was dangerous.
[00:08:49.588 --> 00:08:53.611]  So in two hours we have Dr. Russell Blaylock, top brain surgeon.
[00:08:53.611 --> 00:09:02.258]  He's invented many of the most popularly or most commonly used brain surgeries out there.
[00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:05.901]  Exposes how they're putting toxins in the food by design.
[00:09:05.901 --> 00:09:10.144]  And he's also created a compendium of those government documents.
[00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:15.829]  And there's a new EPA report out where they admit that they're allowing hundreds of toxic chemicals to be put in the water on purpose.
[00:09:17.318 --> 00:09:26.480]  So we're going to have him on about that and the whole flu situation in hindsight ahead of the next PSYOP that they launch.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:40.502]  Also, cities all over the United States simultaneously yesterday, including the town where I live, passed taxes, roughly doubling the taxes overall.
[00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:45.103]  Not just energy taxes, but this dwarfs all taxes combined.
[00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:51.169]  And they're openly all over the news calling for one-child policy in the US.
[00:09:51.169 --> 00:09:53.851]  And I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to go over it today.
[00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:58.414]  Austin Renewable Energy Plan sails easily through council on Earth Day last night.
[00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:00.756]  Unanimous vote.
[00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:09.882]  And we have caught the head of elections in Travis County, and it's even been in the Statesman, that
[00:10:11.598 --> 00:10:15.199]  We basically don't have elections here and that's why this is going on.
[00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:21.401]  That's why it doesn't matter how many people are angry or what happens.
[00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:31.725]  Even a state board has admitted to Capital Metro, the bus agency, just steals hundreds of millions of dollars and no one knows where it goes and they won't say.
[00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:35.046]  This is only the beginning.
[00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:37.207]  This is only the beginning because
[00:10:38.243 --> 00:10:44.927]  The people know the government's corrupt and out of control, but they have no idea how bad it really is.
[00:10:44.927 --> 00:10:57.954]  And the criminals have had decades to move into every position of power, and they have handbooks on how they run their scams and how they deceive people, and how they distract.
[00:10:57.954 --> 00:11:00.235]  And when I say the sky's the limit, I mean it is the limit.
[00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:14.516]  The tyranny that is now going to come to full fruition in the Western world is going to dwarf anything ever seen in human history.
[00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:17.618]  But I don't say that lightly.
[00:11:17.618 --> 00:11:29.428]  So we'll go over that also, the latest takeover of the economy through the value-added financial tax, the environmental value-added taxes, all of it.
[00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:30.849]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:43.947]  Today, Greece welcomes its new IMF overlords with day of rioting and national strikes.
[00:11:43.947 --> 00:11:49.370]  That's from Mark Faber, top financial analyst.
[00:11:49.370 --> 00:12:01.879]  And Mr. Black, one of the top former federal regulators, gave testimony earlier in the week before Congress, and he... I'm going to play it later.
[00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:09.029]  And he just said, look, I've been here all day hearing other testimony.
[00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:11.750]  He said, no one's talking about the real issue.
[00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.454]  All of these brokerage firms and big banks are completely criminal and know they're criminal.
[00:12:16.454 --> 00:12:18.355]  And this is designed to destroy the economy.
[00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:22.438]  And this will destroy everything and consolidate power for them.
[00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:23.739]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:12:28.993 --> 00:12:41.600]  And the chairman of the committee for the last two minutes of his testimony starts banging the gavel, you know, tapping it to distract what he's saying, a new tactic we've seen the last few years from these people.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:57.530]  And watching Mr. Black, Professor Black, who by the way is in Fall of the Republic, it just brings it home even more that anybody who's clear thinking looks at this and understands it's a worldwide kleptocracy.
[00:12:58.755 --> 00:13:05.360]  Or a government run by criminals, thieves, kleptomaniacs.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.401]  And they enjoy it.
[00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:08.682]  They have fun doing it.
[00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:18.169]  They compete with each other for who can twist things the best, who can lie the best, who can kill the most people.
[00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:23.193]  And because America had so much liberty, it produced more wealth in the entire world combined.
[00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:28.846]  In the last 80 years.
[00:13:28.846 --> 00:13:33.750]  And we've gone from the richest to now the most in debt.
[00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.774]  And it's accelerating rapidly.
[00:13:38.774 --> 00:13:41.496]  Because the average American has had it so good.
[00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:45.939]  I mean, even if you're poor in this country, you've got it a lot better than people.
[00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:49.602]  I mean, 15 million children starve to death, the UN's own numbers a year.
[00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:53.525]  Another 10 million adults, so 25 million people starve to death.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:07.525]  So, even our poor have had it the best, but the system is designed to make us all poor and all dependent.
[00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:18.310]  And so, because we've had it so good and had so much entertainment and so much bread and circus, fundamentally, people can't take things seriously.
[00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.771]  And that's what Professor Black was saying.
[00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:21.372]  He says, don't you understand?
[00:14:21.372 --> 00:14:23.713]  It's all over.
[00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:26.815]  The world is going into a global depression
[00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:30.844]  And it's not going to stop and nothing has been fixed.
[00:14:30.844 --> 00:14:32.445]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:14:32.445 --> 00:14:38.851]  And that's exactly what's going on on every other front.
[00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:50.661]  And those of us that are continually upset and are trying to do something about this, we're the people that have good instincts.
[00:14:51.618 --> 00:15:07.812]  I mean, as a man, I'm supposed to not be able to sleep when we have absolute, 100% incontrovertible proof that the federal government involved with other foreign intelligence agencies and private merc groups carried out 9-11.
[00:15:10.572 --> 00:15:11.713]  To even say that.
[00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:15.636]  I mean, I could spend 500 hours and never exhaust all the evidence.
[00:15:15.636 --> 00:15:18.759]  It's ridiculous on every front.
[00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:22.142]  100% inside job.
[00:15:22.142 --> 00:15:22.782]  100%.
[00:15:22.782 --> 00:15:24.944]  We've got government planning documents.
[00:15:24.944 --> 00:15:28.047]  We've got every facet of the attacks being a complete lie.
[00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:31.890]  Then when you find out what really happened, 100%.
[00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.892]  I mean, how can any of you even sleep?
[00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:38.366]  Oh, you choose not to believe it.
[00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:41.507]  You choose not to look into what I'm saying.
[00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:47.649]  You choose to not believe that the global warming fraud is a complete takeover of society.
[00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:54.992]  You choose to not believe that sodium fluoride is a sterilant and a cancer-causing agent of the highest magnitude.
[00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:59.073]  You choose to believe everything's going to be alright in the economy.
[00:15:59.073 --> 00:16:02.114]  You choose to believe Iraq had WMDs.
[00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:04.355]  You choose, willfully,
[00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:09.252]  To be fools.
[00:16:09.252 --> 00:16:11.854]  Willful idiocy.
[00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:13.536]  And I'm not talking to our regular listeners.
[00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:25.685]  I'm talking to the tens of thousands of new listeners that tune across the AM and FM, XM dial, shortwave dial, internet dial.
[00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:34.852]  I mean, this is so intense and so real for me because I've lived research for 16 years and on air for almost 15.
[00:16:34.852 --> 00:16:36.193]  This knowledge is so
[00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:41.100]  Overwhelming.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.328]  That more and more, I'm not even sure if I can continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.883]  But then I know I can't stop either because I can't get it out of my head.
[00:16:49.883 --> 00:16:51.063]  I can't stop thinking about it.
[00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:52.464]  I can't stop learning.
[00:16:52.464 --> 00:16:57.888]  I can't stop developing a clearer and clearer picture of who runs the planet.
[00:16:57.888 --> 00:17:12.059]  I mean, if you knew what I knew, okay, if you would have done the research, I'm not even that smart, if you would have gone out and studied history and learned the tricks of elites and learned what they're currently doing, you would be horrified.
[00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:14.626]  You would have chills through your body.
[00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:20.208]  I've got chills right now.
[00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:23.548]  You think I want to go on air and say 9-11's an inside job?
[00:17:23.548 --> 00:17:26.889]  You think I liked doing that eight and a half years ago?
[00:17:26.889 --> 00:17:32.350]  You think it's fun?
[00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.771]  You think I just get up here and say this stuff for attention?
[00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.407]  Heaven help us.
[00:17:42.407 --> 00:17:48.708]  Heaven help us.
[00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:51.549]  Why have I been able to say the things I say?
[00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:54.790]  Why have I been able to get on so many AM and FM stations?
[00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.331]  Why have I been able to do this?
[00:17:56.331 --> 00:18:02.993]  Because no matter how wild the things I talk about are, truth is wild.
[00:18:02.993 --> 00:18:04.553]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:18:04.553 --> 00:18:06.174]  The world's a crazy place.
[00:18:06.174 --> 00:18:09.995]  History is out of control and dangerous and amazing.
[00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:14.041]  And beautiful and ugly and everything in between.
[00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:17.622]  And it's because we have predicted many events accurately.
[00:18:17.622 --> 00:18:25.486]  We've talked about so many things that were in government documents that months or years or a decade later become mainstream media.
[00:18:25.486 --> 00:18:27.808]  That's why we're getting on so many stations.
[00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:29.909]  That's why this show is growing so fast.
[00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:34.171]  Because finally station managers and radio executives and the population
[00:18:35.643 --> 00:18:44.228]  The listeners who heard me as a guest in the thousands and thousands, I've probably done more than 5,000 radio interviews the last 15 years.
[00:18:44.228 --> 00:18:50.071]  I was doing radio interviews before I had a radio show.
[00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:57.896]  Because most people, once or twice, have heard me or seen videos I've produced.
[00:18:57.896 --> 00:19:03.059]  And they would laugh at it at the time or say, look at this nut, and then years later they'd see it in their face admitted.
[00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:07.711]  And I go back to a parallel to this.
[00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:14.754]  Back in the 1950s, you can pull up the actual date when LaCosa Nostra and the hearings were admitted in Congress.
[00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:21.217]  But, you know, you have this FBI director who's in there for 20-something years, up until the 50s.
[00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:23.297]  He'd been there, what, since the 30s?
[00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:27.980]  J. Edgar Hoover, or even earlier.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:33.062]  And he would go around saying it's a conspiracy theory that LaCosa Nostra exists.
[00:19:34.517 --> 00:19:37.818]  Because he was being paid off by La Cosa Nostra.
[00:19:37.818 --> 00:19:39.698]  Now everybody knows the mafia is real now.
[00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:40.938]  The Italian mob.
[00:19:40.938 --> 00:19:43.279]  And that's how stupid all of this is.
[00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:45.399]  Everything I'm talking about is completely real.
[00:19:45.399 --> 00:19:46.199]  It's there.
[00:19:46.199 --> 00:19:48.360]  You can't just deny it and make it go away.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.201]  Just like in the 50s if they said the mob didn't exist.
[00:19:53.201 --> 00:19:55.541]  Now that sounds silly, doesn't it?
[00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:58.342]  Well, 9-11's an inside job.
[00:19:58.342 --> 00:20:00.002]  Now I'm gonna go over and when we come back, stay with us.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:09.187]  Are you considering taking herbal supplements instead of overpriced and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical drugs, but just not sure where to start?
[00:20:09.187 --> 00:20:12.430]  Are you confused by the thousands of products and brands?

[00:21:00.629 --> 00:21:03.010]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.331]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:08.552]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.552 --> 00:21:13.654]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.654 --> 00:21:17.835]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.155 --> 00:21:20.618]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.618 --> 00:21:23.401]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:26.304]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.304 --> 00:21:33.893]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.244 --> 00:21:39.645]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:41.946]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:46.166]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:47.247]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.247 --> 00:21:48.587]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.587 --> 00:21:50.087]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.907 --> 00:22:09.935]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:16.360]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:25.227]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.587 --> 00:22:34.772]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.772 --> 00:22:39.634]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:39.634 --> 00:22:41.175]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.175 --> 00:22:43.676]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:03.422]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.422 --> 00:23:05.722]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:05.722 --> 00:23:06.582]  Don't!
[00:23:06.582 --> 00:23:10.023]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.023 --> 00:23:17.144]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:17.124 --> 00:23:19.105]  's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:23.185]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:23.185 --> 00:23:25.886]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:33.690]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.871]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:38.093]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.093 --> 00:23:39.534]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.534 --> 00:23:40.794]  Stop the calls now.
[00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:42.815]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:23:42.815 --> 00:23:46.037]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:23:46.037 --> 00:23:46.718]  Call 800-822-1291.
[00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:47.138]  That's 800-822-1291.
[00:23:54.923 --> 00:24:09.753]  800-822-1291 Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go live in the second third and fourth hour today at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:32.118]  And the entire second hour, I'm going to devote to building 7, the key to unlocking 9-11.
[00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:35.919]  Oh, you have all the other sectors and areas of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:38.899]  Every one of them proves total inside job.
[00:24:38.899 --> 00:24:42.440]  And the official story, of course, makes no sense, has been proven to be a lie.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.301]  Six of the 10 commissioners say it's a lie, a cover-up.
[00:24:45.301 --> 00:24:46.741]  That's only in the back of the newspaper.
[00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:57.812]  The head lawyer, Farmer, says it was a criminal cover-up by the Pentagon.
[00:24:57.812 --> 00:25:05.480]  And their official story makes no sense, but then once you realize how they really carried it out, then it all fits together perfectly and you can see how they did it.
[00:25:12.836 --> 00:25:13.257]  I don't know.
[00:25:28.848 --> 00:25:34.231]  The Under Secretary of State, Mr. Kennedy, said, well, yes, we were ordered by an unnamed U.S.
[00:25:34.231 --> 00:25:38.934]  intelligence agency to give him a visa and help him get on the plane.
[00:25:38.934 --> 00:25:43.997]  The FBI had said the witnesses at the airport and the Haskells were lying.
[00:25:43.997 --> 00:25:53.743]  And, of course, they weren't lying when they saw the government get him on the airplane with no passport and no ID.
[00:25:53.743 --> 00:25:56.165]  And they were videotaping the whole thing on board the craft.
[00:25:57.697 --> 00:26:01.620]  And the young moron Patsy thought it was a drill.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.001]  Same thing on 9-11.
[00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:05.603]  We know Mohammed Adda and others were trained at U.S.
[00:26:05.603 --> 00:26:06.544]  military bases.
[00:26:06.544 --> 00:26:13.549]  AP Newsweek, San Jose Mercury News.
[00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:14.550]  And it's even on record.
[00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.493]  Yeah, it's weird they were trained at bases, but we're not going to have a big discussion about that.
[00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:23.417]  And yeah, the government was running live-action drills, seeing if they could insert Arabs on planes.
[00:26:27.594 --> 00:26:42.305]  And yeah, we've got the recordings where there were real air phone calls made, not the magic cell phones that couldn't work at 30,000 feet, with the stewardesses saying, I can't breathe, there's something in the air.
[00:26:42.305 --> 00:26:47.990]  The planes take off, they think it's a drill, they nerve gas, remote control the aircraft and the buildings.
[00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:54.054]  That's what happened, okay?
[00:26:54.054 --> 00:26:56.236]  But see, I can back up every
[00:27:02.546 --> 00:27:04.126]  Millimeter of what I just said.
[00:27:04.126 --> 00:27:08.847]  And that whole area of the hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:27:08.847 --> 00:27:16.308]  bases, that's only, conservatively, one one-thousandth of the issues.
[00:27:16.308 --> 00:27:18.889]  I mean, no exaggeration.
[00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:25.630]  Within one month of 9-11, I had done a two-hour Road to Tyranny film.
[00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.950]  The first version.
[00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.171]  That only offered for a few months, and I made the official version and released it in February.
[00:27:31.032 --> 00:27:45.804]  A few months later of 2002, where I went over more than 500 mainstream news articles, disproving the official story.
[00:27:45.804 --> 00:27:48.947]  You know, that's what's sick about this.
[00:27:48.947 --> 00:27:51.069]  The truth really comes out.
[00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:56.873]  And then if anyone looks at the raw reporting and all the information and points it out, they say, oh, that doesn't exist.
[00:27:56.873 --> 00:27:57.374]  You're insane.
[00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:05.632]  That's what I'm going to talk about in the next hour, just with Building 7, and the new information that's come out.
[00:28:05.632 --> 00:28:08.392]  Is that it's not even new information.
[00:28:08.392 --> 00:28:17.015]  It's just another national reporter going, yeah, I was there, and yeah, they were going to blow up Building 7, what's the big deal?
[00:28:17.015 --> 00:28:19.115]  What's the big deal with blowing up Building 7?
[00:28:19.115 --> 00:28:26.217]  After Silverstein has said they didn't blow up Building 7, after he went on TV and said we blew up Building 7.
[00:28:27.847 --> 00:28:42.352]  And then, it's not just that, I have all this video of CNN, Fox, you name it, of firefighters and police saying, get back, and you hear the explosions going off, and they say that building's about to completely blow up, and then 10 seconds later, it does.
[00:28:42.352 --> 00:28:56.597]  I mean, I heard them on the news, on ABC Radio, saying they were going to blow it up, 15 minutes before they did, and then I go on air, and I say, here they are saying they were going to blow it up, and they say, shut up, you un-American piece of trash, nobody blew that up.
[00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:02.740]  Shut up, you un-American piece of trash!
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.160]  The hijackers weren't trained at U.S.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.180]  military bases.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:17.364]  It doesn't matter if at the Defense Language School, the Dean, Colonel Stephen Butler, went public and said, this is a government operation in a letter to the San Jose Mercury News.
[00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:19.704]  These people were trained at our base.
[00:29:19.704 --> 00:29:25.646]  I don't know exactly what happened, but Adda sat in my classroom.
[00:29:25.646 --> 00:29:25.906]  Okay?
[00:29:28.973 --> 00:29:34.194]  I'll tell you what this new information pertains to and why it's so upsetting to me.
[00:29:34.194 --> 00:29:37.075]  Because every time we get proven right, it doesn't make me happy.
[00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.776]  It makes me sick.
[00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.076]  But let me tell you something.
[00:29:40.076 --> 00:29:47.778]  If we don't own up to who's running our country and how bad it is, 9-11 is nothing compared to what these murderers are gonna do.
[00:29:47.778 --> 00:29:48.798]  And you are the target.
[00:29:48.798 --> 00:29:50.859]  You remember that.
[00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:52.259]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.259 --> 00:29:54.780]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.461]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:02.536]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:04.878]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:08.081]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:30:08.081 --> 00:30:13.186]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:17.710]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.172]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:30:20.172 --> 00:30:22.935]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:30:22.935 --> 00:30:25.457]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:30:25.837 --> 00:30:33.787]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:30:33.787 --> 00:30:39.174]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:30:39.174 --> 00:30:41.276]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:30:42.017 --> 00:30:45.702]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:30:45.702 --> 00:30:46.783]  And I got news for you.
[00:30:46.783 --> 00:30:48.105]  You're everyone else.
[00:30:48.105 --> 00:30:49.607]  Invisible Empire.

[00:31:00.114 --> 00:31:01.415]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.415 --> 00:31:06.999]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:12.022]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.022 --> 00:31:17.066]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:17.586 --> 00:31:22.810]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.131]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:31:25.131 --> 00:31:29.934]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:29.934 --> 00:31:31.055]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:34.137]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:34.137 --> 00:31:37.740]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.942]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:43.163]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:51.950]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:56.773]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:56.773 --> 00:32:01.637]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:32:52.692 --> 00:32:52.912]  You see...
[00:33:10.848 --> 00:33:25.115]  I can't make a conscious decision like most people do to lie to myself and say 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:33:25.115 --> 00:33:29.978]  I can't do it.
[00:33:29.978 --> 00:33:33.500]  I can't lie to myself.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:41.346]  Just because the truth is scary, I can't rationalize what's going on.
[00:33:41.346 --> 00:33:46.573]  And that's why I'm so disgusted about the new information that I'm going to cover in detail in the next hour.
[00:33:53.436 --> 00:34:00.499]  I understand the psychology of the controllers more and more, and the more I get in their mind, the more disgusting it is.
[00:34:00.499 --> 00:34:04.820]  It's like I'm locked in a cell with these people, psychologically.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.742]  You can't help but just get the dirt on you, psychically.
[00:34:10.316 --> 00:34:14.379]  You dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you.
[00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:16.360]  Just the knowledge of it.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:33.673]  I always wondered why when they had disinfo operatives in the media and disinfo operatives on the ground in the last eight plus years at Ground Zero who demonize and come up and get in the face of 9-11 truthers, why they'd always march up and say, so you're saying firemen and police were involved in the attacks?
[00:34:34.892 --> 00:34:40.253]  We'd say no, but they are on video saying, get back, they're going to bring down, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[00:34:40.253 --> 00:34:43.674]  They're going to bring it down, they're going to pull it, they're going to blow it up.
[00:34:43.674 --> 00:34:48.054]  Those are all quotes on TV.
[00:34:48.054 --> 00:34:51.035]  And I wondered why they always invoke that in the newspapers.
[00:34:51.035 --> 00:34:57.056]  And it's meant so that firemen and police hear that and get angry and say, well, I'm not involved.
[00:34:57.056 --> 00:35:01.657]  Sure, I heard they were going to blow it up, but that was just because, you know, they didn't want
[00:35:03.049 --> 00:35:16.505]  Building 7 to damage anything, and that's psychologically involving the police and the firemen, many of which died in Tower 1 and 2, in the crime, when they're not involved in the crime.
[00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:19.609]  But then after the fact, they do become involved in the crime.
[00:35:21.516 --> 00:35:38.241]  Because all these thousands of police and firemen and medical workers and federal agents and others who were all down there in lower Manhattan, all around Building 7, and heard the countdown that multiple police are on record saying happened.
[00:35:38.241 --> 00:35:42.663]  You can see the media and the police start running and the cops say, get back, they're about to blow it up.
[00:35:42.663 --> 00:35:44.603]  That building's coming down, they're bringing it down.
[00:35:44.603 --> 00:35:46.984]  We're going to play that audio and video coming up.
[00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.397]  We've got dozens of them and time constraints.
[00:35:51.397 --> 00:35:51.697]  I don't know.
[00:35:51.697 --> 00:35:55.138]  I guess I'll play five, six clips.
[00:35:55.138 --> 00:35:56.219]  I mean, that's another issue.
[00:35:56.219 --> 00:35:57.579]  There's just so much evidence.
[00:35:57.579 --> 00:36:00.880]  It's disgusting.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:09.023]  And then I read this Fox News contributor, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro.
[00:36:09.023 --> 00:36:15.105]  And he's like, oh, shame on Jesse Ventura.
[00:36:15.105 --> 00:36:16.526]  He's discredited, he says.
[00:36:17.898 --> 00:36:26.281]  Because he's going on national TV and saying the government blew up Building 7 as a pretext for war.
[00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:28.942]  And, you know, there's really no big deal with Building 7.
[00:36:28.942 --> 00:36:43.247]  I was there that day, he says, and, you know, I talked to the city officials, I talked to the power company, and yeah, Larry Silverstein got on the phone and called the insurance company and said, we need to have a controlled demolition of 7 so it doesn't damage other buildings.
[00:36:46.857 --> 00:36:53.080]  And he just throws it out there like it's no big deal.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:09.326]  When Silverstein went on PBS in, what, 2003, in a documentary about the demolition of the other towers that happened weeks after, six and others, and about the attacks, and he says, yeah, we made the decision to pull it, and we gave the order, and watched the building come down.
[00:37:09.326 --> 00:37:15.929]  And then they cut to another clip of them demolishing Building 6 months later, and they say, we're getting ready to pull Building 6, and they blow it up.
[00:37:17.725 --> 00:37:20.026]  They demolish it.
[00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:21.686]  And that's the demolition definition.
[00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:25.527]  So the mainstream media came out and said, no, that's not the definition.
[00:37:25.527 --> 00:37:26.467]  That's not what he meant.
[00:37:26.467 --> 00:37:28.668]  And then Silverstein wouldn't talk about it for a few years.
[00:37:28.668 --> 00:37:41.031]  And finally, the New York Times said, yes, I meant let's pull the firefighters out at five o'clock because there's been such a loss of life and I don't want any firefighters dying battling a blaze.
[00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:48.887]  The problem is the firefighters were pulled out before noon out of Building 7, and it was small fires.
[00:37:48.887 --> 00:38:05.837]  And Barry Jennings, the Deputy Head of Emergency Management in the city, before he mysteriously died after we aired audio on the show, said, yeah, you know, before the other towers even fell, there were big explosions in the lobby, dead people everywhere.
[00:38:05.837 --> 00:38:09.359]  The firemen came in with the police and said, don't look at the dead bodies, we're bringing you out.
[00:38:13.735 --> 00:38:16.797]  And that they made the decision then to pull the building?
[00:38:16.797 --> 00:38:19.719]  Well, he died real fast.
[00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:24.182]  But we've been to the neighbors' houses and they won't talk.
[00:38:24.182 --> 00:38:33.829]  And it looks like he's maybe in the witness protection program.
[00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:37.812]  They said suddenly the family was just gone, moved out, and they heard he was dead.
[00:38:37.812 --> 00:38:41.714]  And the hospital's been very secretive about it.
[00:38:41.714 --> 00:38:42.655]  So have his co-workers.
[00:38:44.577 --> 00:38:46.619]  But side issue.
[00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:49.022]  Again, the evidence just goes on and on.
[00:38:49.022 --> 00:38:57.611]  I mean, we ended up getting in contact with the police that are on the CNN and Fox and Democracy Now!
[00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:00.755]  It was a year before she got the show, but she had her local show in New York.
[00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.937]  She's there, Amy Goodman.
[00:39:02.937 --> 00:39:04.299]  And there's all this footage.
[00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:05.723]  I don't
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.702]  And as I said, I was going to get a pizza.
[00:39:27.702 --> 00:39:30.464]  I've been on air since it happened on 9-11.
[00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:36.708]  I was driving over to the local pizza place, listening to NewsRadio 590, ABC News.
[00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:41.472]  And they said, well, they're looking at a controlled demolition of Building 7 for everyone's safety.
[00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:45.126]  And then they changed their story.
[00:39:45.126 --> 00:39:48.229]  Once they blew it up, they said, no, we're just going to say fires did it.
[00:39:48.229 --> 00:39:58.958]  And they had all these suspicious characters, very well spoken on all the major news channels, as men on the street, wearing Harley Davidson shirts and ball caps, you know, acting like average schmoes, intelligence operatives.
[00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:04.523]  We played these videos, reading a script, explaining why it fell.
[00:40:04.523 --> 00:40:06.545]  Within seconds, they're there.
[00:40:06.545 --> 00:40:07.766]  And then, of course, we have BBC.
[00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:24.083]  25 minutes before on two channels, BBC World, BBC 24, reporting live from Manhattan, simultaneously off the teleprompters, the exact same message.
[00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:31.845]  And I went and researched where they get their pre-feeds from, and I discovered Reuters is their main supplier.
[00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:38.986]  And so I predicted, I said, that was a Reuters false start with the official story that went out early.
[00:40:41.104 --> 00:40:49.226]  Then we found out CNN had actually gone an hour before, and Aaron Brown, an hour before, 61 minutes before, but he lived in New York.
[00:40:49.226 --> 00:40:53.207]  Building 7 has fallen from fires in its own footprint, a complete collapse.
[00:40:53.207 --> 00:41:01.349]  He's on a rooftop and he turns around, you know, the Brits didn't know what Building 7 was, and he looks and he says, but I don't know if this report is right.
[00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:03.429]  Exact same report.
[00:41:03.429 --> 00:41:09.631]  Before it fell, just like before they'd even captured Lee Harvey Oswald, before it was even in the news in Dallas in 63.
[00:41:11.377 --> 00:41:21.680]  They got their time zones off by two hours in New Zealand, in Thailand, in Australia, and several other nations, and had his name and the whole story printed.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:27.262]  Because, you know, back in the 60s, they still had afternoon editions and multiple editions.
[00:41:27.262 --> 00:41:29.183]  Certain newspapers were published at certain times.
[00:41:29.183 --> 00:41:31.984]  That was the Internet of the day, so it was always coming out at different times.
[00:41:34.471 --> 00:41:38.274]  And so they already, again, that's the exact same thing that happened here.
[00:41:38.274 --> 00:41:39.775]  They already had their official script.
[00:41:39.775 --> 00:41:44.579]  When you run something like this, and it's an inside job, you've got to have the official script.
[00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:47.542]  And it just goes on and on, just with Building 7.
[00:41:47.542 --> 00:41:52.106]  And I'm going to go back over all of this in detail in the next hour.
[00:41:52.106 --> 00:41:55.348]  But why am I so upset?
[00:41:55.348 --> 00:41:59.692]  I have seen so many reporters go, yeah, okay, we were talking about blowing it up.
[00:42:03.863 --> 00:42:13.809]  After all these years of them denying it and saying no one ever discussed blowing it up, but now all these news, live news feeds have been discovered and posted on the internet.
[00:42:13.809 --> 00:42:16.010]  There's new ones all the time.
[00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:20.793]  So many that now when they come out, people don't even really pay attention to it.
[00:42:20.793 --> 00:42:21.893]  9-11 Truth really doesn't.
[00:42:21.893 --> 00:42:25.876]  It's just like, yeah, we already know they blew up 7, you know, the dumb public won't wake up.
[00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.917]  Well, you've got to keep bringing the info to the public.
[00:42:29.261 --> 00:42:33.346]  We can't sit there and talk to 20 million people through the mainstream media at one pop.
[00:42:33.346 --> 00:42:38.451]  We have to do it through alternative media over and over again, continually reaching more people.
[00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:43.477]  Because if we don't, the same crew that carried out 9-11 is going to have their way with this society.
[00:42:44.923 --> 00:42:46.904]  You think they're going to stop there with wars?
[00:42:46.904 --> 00:42:48.845]  No, they're going to take your pension funds.
[00:42:48.845 --> 00:42:50.746]  They're going to jack up all your taxes.
[00:42:50.746 --> 00:42:52.287]  They're doing it now.
[00:42:52.287 --> 00:42:56.930]  They're going to set up domestic police, secret police networks that have already been set up.
[00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:57.950]  They're going to use them.
[00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.251]  They're going to arrest anybody that criticizes the government.
[00:43:00.251 --> 00:43:02.493]  They're now promoting it everywhere.
[00:43:02.493 --> 00:43:03.813]  They're going with it.
[00:43:03.813 --> 00:43:10.457]  They're trying to really convert us to an incredibly horrible despotism.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:29.296]  Now if you want to get the full picture, there's an article, and I IM'd Paul Watson and wrote some of the points I wanted in the article at 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock in the morning.
[00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:32.079]  He got it out by 7 a.m.
[00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:32.960]  because he's in England.
[00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:36.686]  Six hours earlier than us.
[00:43:36.686 --> 00:43:37.446]  Bombshell!
[00:43:37.446 --> 00:43:40.807]  Silverstein wanted to demolish Building 7 on 9-11.
[00:43:40.807 --> 00:43:47.210]  Fox News hit piece against 9-11 truth and Jesse Ventura inadvertently reveals a shocking truth for the millionth time.
[00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:53.452]  WTC leaseholder was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they could authorize the controlled demolition of the building.
[00:43:57.056 --> 00:44:03.941]  And there's a preface to the article from Alex Jones, it says, to truly grasp the magnitude of this story, you really have to read the entire article.
[00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:12.728]  Immediately after the Pulit controversy with Silverstein, debunkers claimed that there was no plan to conduct a controlled demolition of the building.
[00:44:12.728 --> 00:44:17.612]  Now the facts that officials were considering blowing up the building as established.
[00:44:17.612 --> 00:44:22.856]  Silverstein, consistent denial that this took place is a huge smoking gun.
[00:44:24.042 --> 00:44:36.928]  How did Silverstein expect to demolish the building safely when such a process takes weeks or even months to properly set up, even without the additional chaos surrounding WTC7 on 9-11?
[00:44:36.928 --> 00:44:47.013]  How could explosives have been correctly placed on such short notice inside a burning building that had already been evacuated, unless the explosives were already in place?
[00:44:47.013 --> 00:44:51.535]  This new revelation is astounding and it needs to be investigated immediately.
[00:44:52.705 --> 00:45:01.958]  And then we go into all the evidence in the videos and the eyewitness reports and Silverstein saying they blew it up and then saying he didn't say that when he did.
[00:45:01.958 --> 00:45:04.922]  But it's the sickeningness
[00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:23.173]  Of cowards like Jeffrey Scott Shapiro attacking Jesse Ventura as un-American and then going, well yeah, we were discussing and I did talk to city officials and Silverstein was trying to get permission to blow up the building.
[00:45:26.437 --> 00:45:28.298]  See, something went wrong on 9-11.
[00:45:28.298 --> 00:45:33.582]  Flight 93, the more I look at it, was probably not meant for the Capitol because it could have gone either places.
[00:45:33.582 --> 00:45:34.923]  It was meant for 7.
[00:45:34.923 --> 00:45:36.465]  They already had it wired.
[00:45:36.465 --> 00:45:38.526]  The CIA was based in the building.
[00:45:38.526 --> 00:45:41.108]  The state and city emergency system was based.
[00:45:41.108 --> 00:45:43.170]  They were running a tripod 2 drill.
[00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.671]  Other buildings being attacked that day.
[00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:45.731]  That's now declassified.
[00:45:45.731 --> 00:45:50.695]  Giuliani denied it for 5 years and now it's been declassified.
[00:45:50.695 --> 00:45:53.197]  Tripod 2.
[00:45:53.197 --> 00:45:54.138]  Congressional testimony.
[00:45:54.138 --> 00:45:55.479]  9-11 Commission.
[00:45:57.233 --> 00:45:58.073]  That was their cover.
[00:45:58.073 --> 00:45:59.174]  What's all this stuff going on?
[00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:00.034]  Why are all these people here?
[00:46:00.034 --> 00:46:03.076]  Oh, it's just a drill, officers.
[00:46:03.076 --> 00:46:04.176]  You'll see later.
[00:46:04.176 --> 00:46:06.577]  Going up the building, we need to have some martyrs.
[00:46:06.577 --> 00:46:17.102]  Going up near the top with the firemen.
[00:46:17.102 --> 00:46:22.324]  And you've got Silverstein then frantically on the phone, because he just got the building six months before.
[00:46:22.324 --> 00:46:24.745]  He'd taken out six-plus billion dollars in insurance.
[00:46:26.395 --> 00:46:38.683]  500 plus million just on Building 7 and it's going to be obvious if they blow this thing up, people are going to know it's a controlled demolition.
[00:46:38.683 --> 00:46:39.524]  What are we going to do?
[00:46:39.524 --> 00:46:43.306]  We've got to get rid of the evidence.
[00:46:43.306 --> 00:46:48.990]  And the black ops come in and say, don't worry, we'll float the story that we're going to have a controlled
[00:46:49.775 --> 00:46:51.296]  Demolition to save other buildings.
[00:46:51.296 --> 00:46:54.999]  But wait, people know you can't wire a building that fast, especially when it's got fires in it.
[00:46:54.999 --> 00:46:58.521]  Don't worry, they'll buy anything.
[00:46:58.521 --> 00:47:03.744]  Believe me, we've gotten reports back, our psych warfare experts say they'll buy it.
[00:47:03.744 --> 00:47:05.045]  Just say we wired it.
[00:47:05.045 --> 00:47:14.232]  And then somebody changed that, I guess when he couldn't get the insurance money, just an added little thing in this whole system, and so they said, we'll just blow the thing and say that it fell on its own.
[00:47:14.992 --> 00:47:16.093]  And that's what they did.
[00:47:16.093 --> 00:47:18.716]  And it's admitted they did that.
[00:47:18.716 --> 00:47:23.421]  And then the way PSYOPs and Black Ops work is they go, well, a lot of cops and firemen know this.
[00:47:23.421 --> 00:47:24.683]  People are talking.
[00:47:24.683 --> 00:47:27.806]  These 9-11 truthers are talking to them.
[00:47:27.806 --> 00:47:34.153]  What you do is, on one or two programs, you just mention that you gave the order to Pullett to save life.
[00:47:34.153 --> 00:47:36.216]  But then on the insurance settlement, it says that he didn't.
[00:47:38.752 --> 00:47:41.614]  And then that way you're covered, just like we use drills.
[00:47:41.614 --> 00:47:43.135]  This is them talking to Silverstein.
[00:47:43.135 --> 00:47:45.837]  Just like we use drills, sir.
[00:47:45.837 --> 00:47:47.558]  So that we can have plausible deniability.
[00:47:47.558 --> 00:47:52.322]  The public doesn't want to believe these type of things, so they'll buy the lie, no matter how ridiculous.
[00:47:52.322 --> 00:47:53.903]  Are you sure about that?
[00:47:53.903 --> 00:47:55.144]  Yes, sir, we are.
[00:47:55.144 --> 00:47:56.385]  Thanks for working with us on this.
[00:47:56.385 --> 00:47:58.346]  It's better for America and Israel.
[00:47:58.346 --> 00:48:01.769]  This is going to let us set up the empire and continue things.
[00:48:01.769 --> 00:48:04.671]  This is a pawn sacrifice for America.
[00:48:04.671 --> 00:48:05.972]  We appreciate your patriotism.
[00:48:11.468 --> 00:48:13.670]  You really think they're going to buy it?
[00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:18.033]  You mean we're going to blow this thing up right in front of everybody?
[00:48:18.033 --> 00:48:19.954]  Sir, it's better if you don't know all the details.
[00:48:19.954 --> 00:48:21.055]  You saw Tower 1 and 2.
[00:48:21.055 --> 00:48:22.957]  They bought that, didn't they?
[00:48:22.957 --> 00:48:24.858]  Alright, alright.
[00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:27.100]  The deal was I let you do this to my buildings.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.843]  I get the six billion.
[00:48:31.843 --> 00:48:35.086]  Sir, you're involved in the local
[00:48:36.494 --> 00:48:37.655]  Underworld.
[00:48:37.655 --> 00:48:38.695]  Mafia in New York.
[00:48:38.695 --> 00:48:39.756]  You understand how this works.
[00:48:39.756 --> 00:48:41.616]  I mean, I've been working with you for a long time.
[00:48:41.616 --> 00:48:46.078]  And I have to sit there and I have to look at these people.
[00:48:46.078 --> 00:48:47.959]  I mean, they think we're so stupid.
[00:48:47.959 --> 00:48:49.740]  They blow up all three of the buildings.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.762]  They admit they blew up seven and then say they never said it when they said it on TV.
[00:48:53.762 --> 00:48:56.923]  And you got all the cops saying, get back, they're blowing it up.
[00:48:56.923 --> 00:49:02.626]  And then you have a Fox News person come out and say, well, yeah, I mean, we were going to blow it up that day.
[00:49:03.942 --> 00:49:10.484]  Silverstein tried to get permission, but he couldn't, so it fell anyways, perfectly in its own footprint, and didn't damage nearby buildings.
[00:49:10.484 --> 00:49:16.807]  Which is the reason he wanted to blow it up, was supposedly not to damage other buildings.
[00:49:16.807 --> 00:49:20.068]  And then you talk to the general public, they can't even grasp this elementary thing.
[00:49:20.068 --> 00:49:25.450]  A lot of times they'll switch into Crimestopper, Doublethink, and say, well, the government had to blow it up!
[00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.470]  You go, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.651]  The government's denying they blew it up.
[00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:32.863]  But I thought you said Silverstein admitted they blew it up.
[00:49:32.863 --> 00:49:34.945]  See, they know how to confuse people.
[00:49:34.945 --> 00:49:36.186]  Well, no, they've said both.
[00:49:36.186 --> 00:49:39.448]  That's the reason there's a cover up here.
[00:49:39.448 --> 00:49:48.796]  We know from the evidence they blew it up, from the seismograph, from the witnesses, from the video, from the cops and firemen saying, get back, from Silverstein admitting they blew it up.
[00:49:48.796 --> 00:49:54.660]  From it being on the news, you know, they went with the story, we're going to blow up Building 7 to protect you.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.745]  And then they shift and say, no, we didn't do that, we never said that, you heard it all over radio and TV.
[00:50:01.741 --> 00:50:12.347]  And so an hour before they shift from, we're gonna blow it up, to, oh no, it's fallen in its own footprint and the building's still standing there.
[00:50:12.347 --> 00:50:18.770]  I mean, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off because something didn't go right with Building 7.
[00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:23.753]  They're out in the open.
[00:50:23.753 --> 00:50:28.776]  And grown adults, many of them can grasp it, many others can't.
[00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:46.123]  But then it just brings it all home, how in your face this is, how out in the open this is, to have Fox News come out and say, it is true, we were looking at blowing it up, but it fell on its own perfectly, so we didn't have to.
[00:50:46.123 --> 00:50:57.506]  When all these years they've denied that there was, that they were promoting blowing up Building 7, but they knew that that wouldn't sail with engineers around the country and demolition experts.
[00:50:57.506 --> 00:50:58.946]  Oh man, they really think we're stupid.
[00:51:00.714 --> 00:51:02.015]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.015 --> 00:51:07.599]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:12.622]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.622 --> 00:51:18.206]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:22.889]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.407 --> 00:51:30.530]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.650]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:38.333]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:38.333 --> 00:51:41.534]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:41.534 --> 00:51:44.695]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:44.695 --> 00:51:44.875]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:53.479 --> 00:52:02.981]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.981 --> 00:52:05.281]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.281 --> 00:52:08.502]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.502 --> 00:52:13.603]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.603 --> 00:52:17.784]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.124 --> 00:52:20.467]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.467 --> 00:52:23.351]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.351 --> 00:52:26.255]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.255 --> 00:52:33.865]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.185 --> 00:52:39.587]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.587 --> 00:52:42.448]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.448 --> 00:52:46.129]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.189]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.189 --> 00:52:48.550]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.030]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:00.175 --> 00:53:01.916]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:53:01.916 --> 00:53:03.857]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:53:03.857 --> 00:53:04.677]  Sinus pressure.
[00:53:04.677 --> 00:53:06.438]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:53:06.438 --> 00:53:07.699]  You've struggled for years.
[00:53:07.699 --> 00:53:13.541]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:53:13.541 --> 00:53:14.302]  Sound familiar?
[00:53:14.302 --> 00:53:15.362]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:53:15.362 --> 00:53:19.004]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:53:19.004 --> 00:53:24.046]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:53:24.046 --> 00:53:26.687]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor-recommended.
[00:53:26.687 --> 00:53:28.268]  Sinofresh Homeopathic Antiseptic.
[00:53:30.745 --> 00:53:31.065]  I think so.
[00:54:01.897 --> 00:54:07.723]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.723 --> 00:54:10.006]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:18.135 --> 00:54:19.256]  We are back live.
[00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:23.779]  I'm going to go live at 8 after at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:23.779 --> 00:54:35.066]  The last two hours and 52 minutes of this radio broadcast for people who want to be able to see the videos, not just hear the audio, and see all the government documents and articles.
[00:54:35.066 --> 00:54:40.130]  And I'll read over what Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, Fox News said about the day he was on 9-11.
[00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.452]  This is his eyewitness account.
[00:54:43.452 --> 00:54:46.074]  And he's just completely bought into the mass delusion.
[00:54:47.375 --> 00:55:07.886]  As a reporter, Silverstein wanted to blow up Building 7 while it was on fire, but Silverstein has said they never wanted to blow up Building 7, that they didn't blow up Building 7, and that Pullett meant that he had said, get the firefighters out at 4.30 in the afternoon, when the firefighters had been pulled out at around noon.
[00:55:08.993 --> 00:55:11.375]  See, everything he says is a lie.
[00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:13.976]  But the FBI's not going to do anything.
[00:55:13.976 --> 00:55:16.018]  The Justice Department's not going to do anything.
[00:55:16.018 --> 00:55:18.279]  The Pentagon's not going to do anything.
[00:55:18.279 --> 00:55:20.281]  The local police aren't going to do anything.
[00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:22.782]  And so, of course the bankers are going to take all your pension funds.
[00:55:22.782 --> 00:55:25.104]  Of course they're going to double your local power bill.
[00:55:25.104 --> 00:55:26.905]  Of course they're going to take everything you've got.
[00:55:26.905 --> 00:55:36.712]  Because they can blow Kennedy's head off in front of everyone and have 50-something witnesses that saw the man behind the bushes shoot the gun and blow his head off.
[00:55:37.552 --> 00:55:40.054]  And, you know, they tell you you didn't see that, so what?
[00:55:40.054 --> 00:55:42.756]  They kill a few witnesses, everybody shuts up.
[00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:47.299]  Doesn't matter if you've got people in the train control station 50 yards away that saw it all happen.
[00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:49.301]  Men get off a green pickup and shoot Kennedy.
[00:55:49.301 --> 00:55:51.102]  They just killed him.
[00:55:51.102 --> 00:55:52.824]  He wouldn't change his story, so they killed him.
[00:55:52.824 --> 00:55:54.144]  They'll just kill whoever they want.
[00:55:54.144 --> 00:55:55.686]  They'll kill a million Iraqis.
[00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:57.307]  They'll kill 3,000 Americans.
[00:55:57.307 --> 00:55:58.628]  They'll take everything we've got.
[00:55:58.628 --> 00:56:00.129]  They'll poison our water.
[00:56:00.129 --> 00:56:03.331]  They'll sterilize us through the vaccines.
[00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:05.193]  It's real funny to these people.
[00:56:05.193 --> 00:56:05.973]  They're killers.
[00:56:05.973 --> 00:56:06.714]  You understand that?
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.461]  Kill us all and let God sort us out.
[00:56:13.461 --> 00:56:15.422]  We're all weeds to the new world order.
[00:56:15.422 --> 00:56:21.505]  There's six and a half billion of us and they want the world's resources and they don't need us anymore with robotics and technology.
[00:56:21.505 --> 00:56:27.187]  And they made the decision 50 years ago to set up a total world government and just slaughter every stinking one of us.
[00:56:27.187 --> 00:56:32.570]  And you're sitting there with your thumb crammed in your mouth, sucking on it right now, going, listen to this nut, honey.
[00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.231]  Or you're a cop sitting in your car laughing.
[00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:35.971]  Listen to me.
[00:56:35.971 --> 00:56:37.252]  This isn't funny.
[00:56:37.252 --> 00:56:37.532]  Okay?
[00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:41.202]  Get past your deep-seated cowardice.
[00:56:41.202 --> 00:56:43.103]  Deep down, you're scared deep down.
[00:56:43.103 --> 00:56:45.204]  Deep down, you know this is the truth.
[00:56:45.204 --> 00:56:51.567]  Deep down, you remember hearing them on the radio and TV saying they were going to blow up 7 and then saying they never blew it up.
[00:56:51.567 --> 00:56:55.269]  Deep down, you know the truth.
[00:56:55.269 --> 00:56:56.890]  And so, like cowards,
[00:57:00.902 --> 00:57:03.643]  Like cowards, you're going to rationalize it.
[00:57:03.643 --> 00:57:05.224]  Look, it doesn't matter though.
[00:57:05.224 --> 00:57:08.006]  A lot of you were cowards, support the system, that's fine.
[00:57:08.006 --> 00:57:16.990]  Those of us that aren't cowards, and understand we've got to save this species from your clutches, are going to stand up and tell the truth to the end.
[00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:24.014]  And just like the FBI, until the 50s, said the mafia didn't exist because they were paid off by them, and said it was a conspiracy theory,
[00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:30.532]  It's gonna come out the environmentalists are a bunch of eugenics murdering criminals.
[00:57:30.532 --> 00:57:35.314]  And it is coming out.
[00:57:35.314 --> 00:57:39.637]  It's going to come out that the banks are engineering the collapse.
[00:57:39.637 --> 00:57:40.877]  It now is coming out.
[00:57:40.877 --> 00:57:45.360]  It's gonna come out 9-11 was an inside job, just like Gulf of Tonkin was an inside job.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:51.103]  Every stinking bit of it is coming out and more is gonna come out.
[00:57:51.103 --> 00:57:52.784]  And I don't care if you kill me.
[00:57:53.064 --> 00:57:54.925]  I don't care if you destroy my name.
[00:57:54.925 --> 00:57:56.066]  I don't care what you do to me.
[00:57:56.066 --> 00:57:58.788]  You understand you're going to be brought to justice in the end.
[00:57:58.788 --> 00:58:00.649]  Even if it's after you're in the ground.
[00:58:00.649 --> 00:58:03.331]  Even if it's after you've died of old age.
[00:58:03.331 --> 00:58:08.195]  Everybody's going to know you were a pack of murdering terrorist scum.
[00:58:08.195 --> 00:58:13.618]  And no doubt your families that you teach the family trade to, they're all going to be carrying out crimes.
[00:58:13.618 --> 00:58:18.282]  And your progeny are going to be brought to justice.
[00:58:18.282 --> 00:58:20.563]  You understand that?
[00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:21.364]  You understand that?
[00:58:23.086 --> 00:58:26.949]  Because a lot of us are willing to sell our lives for justice.
[00:58:26.949 --> 00:58:27.710]  You understand that?
[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:31.132]  A lot of us are committed.
[00:58:31.132 --> 00:58:33.394]  And so, we're on the front line.
[00:58:33.394 --> 00:58:36.617]  We're not backing down murderers, psychopathic killers.
[00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:39.299]  We know who you are, and we're coming for justice.
[00:58:39.299 --> 00:58:45.444]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:58.532 --> 00:59:03.015]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:59:24.508 --> 00:59:26.370]  This film needs to be seen.

[00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.391]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.154 --> 01:00:09.997]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:11.578]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.578 --> 01:00:13.119]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:17.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:22.625]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:28.889]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is going to be on with us in the next hour.
[01:00:28.889 --> 01:00:29.470]  Doug Stanhope.
[01:00:30.956 --> 01:00:33.918]  Top comedian, TV host.
[01:00:33.918 --> 01:00:35.019]  I've known him for a long time.
[01:00:35.019 --> 01:00:36.381]  I don't agree with a lot of his politics.
[01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:37.181]  I agree with some of it.
[01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:38.062]  But he's an interesting fellow.
[01:00:38.062 --> 01:00:39.043]  He's in Austin.
[01:00:39.043 --> 01:00:42.766]  We're going to have him in to discuss 9-11, a host of issues.
[01:00:42.766 --> 01:00:46.729]  It should be like the last half hour of the last hour.
[01:00:46.729 --> 01:00:47.850]  So it'll be good to see Doug.
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.731]  I haven't seen him in person in about seven years.
[01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:52.914]  I don't know, six years.
[01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:54.816]  Former host of The Man Show.
[01:00:54.816 --> 01:00:57.098]  Got a new TV show in England and in Canada.
[01:00:57.098 --> 01:00:58.539]  And I think one coming up in the U.S., right?
[01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:03.157]  Uh, that's coming up too.
[01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:06.677]  But, you know, I can't joke around while he's here or have any fun, though I like to have fun.
[01:01:06.677 --> 01:01:07.518]  I like to joke around.
[01:01:07.518 --> 01:01:08.658]  I like to go to movies.
[01:01:08.658 --> 01:01:10.238]  I like to go to hear music.
[01:01:10.238 --> 01:01:12.719]  I like to screw around with my buddies.
[01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:14.179]  I don't ever really do that anymore.
[01:01:14.179 --> 01:01:14.639]  I can't.
[01:01:14.639 --> 01:01:16.359]  I mean, all I do is think about the New World Order.
[01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:17.680]  I mean, how could you not?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.821]  People are like, oh, lighten up, relax, everything's gonna be fine.
[01:01:23.821 --> 01:01:26.461]  Okay, they carried out 9-11.
[01:01:26.461 --> 01:01:27.502]  But lighten up.
[01:01:27.502 --> 01:01:29.182]  You know, governments are always bad.
[01:01:31.778 --> 01:01:33.359]  I'm doing alright in the New World Order.
[01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:34.640]  I got emails like that.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.622]  I don't care if we kill all the Iraqis.
[01:01:36.622 --> 01:01:38.604]  Oh, you think you're safe?
[01:01:38.604 --> 01:01:48.151]  Once you let somebody else's rights be violated, once you let somebody else be cornered by wolves and have their guts torn out, you're next, or your kids are next, you fools!
[01:01:48.151 --> 01:01:50.553]  The same predatory system will eat you.
[01:01:50.553 --> 01:01:54.316]  It'll eat its own people.
[01:01:54.316 --> 01:01:56.238]  But that's the blind spot of the psychopaths.
[01:01:57.244 --> 01:01:58.865]  They're like bacteria in a petri dish.
[01:01:58.865 --> 01:02:03.108]  You put a few bacteria in, a few hundred bacteria, it'll be a few million in a week.
[01:02:03.108 --> 01:02:10.053]  And they'll eat the cuter, they'll eat the growth medium, they'll defecate on each other, and all die.
[01:02:10.053 --> 01:02:14.896]  That's what psychopaths and their sociopath servants, their workhorses, do.
[01:02:14.896 --> 01:02:24.283]  They think it's cute, they think it's funny, they hate everyone, they're always bestial, they're always just into feeding their pleasure centers.
[01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:26.965]  I have almost gotten to the point where I don't
[01:02:31.812 --> 01:02:32.312]  It's weird.
[01:02:32.312 --> 01:02:36.695]  I don't even desire earthly pleasures like I used to.
[01:02:36.695 --> 01:02:39.357]  I'm just completely dedicated to fighting this.
[01:02:39.357 --> 01:02:54.746]  But then I'll just see the beauty of a sunset or clouds and birds and the grass and the smell of nature and my wonderful children and just the blessing that is life and it just overwhelms me.
[01:02:54.746 --> 01:02:57.468]  I see beauty like I never saw it before.
[01:02:58.444 --> 01:03:00.365]  Right now, I see an incredibly beautiful woman.
[01:03:00.365 --> 01:03:04.747]  I don't start lusting and wanting to have sex with them.
[01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:13.370]  I just admire God's creation and I think about their grandparents and their ancestors and I want to protect the genetic information.
[01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:14.291]  I want to protect them.
[01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:20.053]  And I understand that is maturity, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:20.053 --> 01:03:22.174]  That's what men are supposed to be like, not a bunch of
[01:03:24.853 --> 01:03:31.882]  Arrested development, buck-toothed, you know, 40-year-old teenagers acting stupid, giggling and gibbering at everything.
[01:03:31.882 --> 01:03:39.172]  How many full-grown men and even positions of power have I warned about things and they'll just laugh and gibber like monkeys or something?
[01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:50.412]  And they've done that through archetypal model images where they always show the cool guy that gets the girls who's a moron on the sitcom.
[01:03:50.412 --> 01:03:53.393]  And then people act like morons and wonder why they don't have the women.
[01:03:53.393 --> 01:03:56.294]  Which is a fundamental first level for a male.
[01:03:56.294 --> 01:03:59.475]  Is to start your own hut, get your mate, start having kids.
[01:03:59.475 --> 01:04:02.516]  And that's just one level of programming.
[01:04:02.516 --> 01:04:03.777]  They've got it all figured out.
[01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:05.538]  They're just screwing everybody over.
[01:04:05.538 --> 01:04:06.438]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.587]  I can just see everything they're doing.
[01:04:11.587 --> 01:04:20.971]  I know word for word what they're doing just by watching them and then years later I'll get a white paper they've written and it's as if I wrote it but with their evil view that it's good.
[01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:26.713]  I mean it's so frustrating to be completely in their brains.
[01:04:26.713 --> 01:04:27.454]  Completely.
[01:04:27.454 --> 01:04:31.415]  I can step right into who they are and I can't stand it.
[01:04:31.415 --> 01:04:36.178]  I want away from them.
[01:04:36.178 --> 01:04:36.958]  You know they say that's the
[01:04:39.312 --> 01:04:40.553]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[01:05:04.031 --> 01:05:05.453]  Now what am I gonna do?
[01:05:05.453 --> 01:05:07.615]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[01:05:07.615 --> 01:05:08.496]  Okay.
[01:05:08.496 --> 01:05:09.577]  Here's a site.

[01:05:13.982 --> 01:05:16.805]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[01:05:16.805 --> 01:05:18.527]  Thanks, Max.
[01:05:18.527 --> 01:05:19.368]  Wow!
[01:05:19.368 --> 01:05:20.770]  They have my original remote!
[01:05:21.454 --> 01:05:24.057]  And an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:03.942]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.942 --> 01:06:09.269]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:11.311]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.311 --> 01:06:16.317]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:17.498]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.498 --> 01:06:18.239]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:20.499]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.499 --> 01:06:21.580]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.780]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.101]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.101 --> 01:06:26.641]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.641 --> 01:06:31.902]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.902 --> 01:06:35.483]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.483 --> 01:06:38.944]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:40.525]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.525 --> 01:06:41.426]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.426 --> 01:06:42.546]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.546 --> 01:06:43.467]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:44.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:47.610]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:07:22.698 --> 01:07:23.899]  We all know that gardens

[01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:12.041]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:13.582]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.582 --> 01:08:17.786]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.786 --> 01:08:21.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:37.057]  I'm going to spend the balance of this second hour now detailing the controlled demolition of the third tower, the 47-story skyscraper that fell after 5 p.m.
[01:08:37.057 --> 01:08:39.880]  on 9-11 eight and a half years ago.
[01:08:42.079 --> 01:08:43.620]  Why am I now going to do that?
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:09:06.176]  Because it not only gives evidence of government-sponsored terrorism, it shows how they put out a story that's ridiculous, but because the FBI, the police, the firemen can't believe the government's this evil, the government could say, we're going to blow this up, get everyone back, and tell hundreds of police this on video.
[01:09:08.726 --> 01:09:14.211]  And it was all over radio and TV, and then they came out and said, no, we didn't blow up Building 7.
[01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:24.640]  And then Larry Silverstein went on PBS a year and a half after the event and said, yes, we did give the order to pull or demolish Building 7.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:33.608]  Then he got caught lying and saying, well, I meant getting firemen out, but firemen had been out for five hours.
[01:09:33.608 --> 01:09:36.170]  He said, we gave the order to pull it and then watch the building come down.
[01:09:38.737 --> 01:09:45.401]  And we have all these police videos, all these interviews, all these newscasts where they said they were going to bring down Building 7.
[01:09:45.401 --> 01:09:51.964]  Then they changed the story and said, no, it's fallen on its own, perfectly in its own footprint.
[01:09:51.964 --> 01:09:53.285]  And then they did that early.
[01:09:53.285 --> 01:10:03.991]  They screwed up in the internal press release that was put out to CNN and BBC, and Building 7 was still standing for another hour after the CNN, 25 minutes after BBC.
[01:10:07.176 --> 01:10:18.435]  Then you hear the explosions, you see the blast, the building falls, there's police saying get back, they're getting ready to bring down the building, they're about to blow it up, boom, it blows up and falls.
[01:10:18.435 --> 01:10:20.639]  And then they come out and tell the public.
[01:10:23.339 --> 01:10:25.201]  That no, we never said we were going to blow it up.
[01:10:25.201 --> 01:10:26.642]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:26.642 --> 01:10:37.713]  And then years later, they come back out and say, OK, we were talking about blowing it up that day as if they could plant explosives in a building when it was on fire.
[01:10:37.713 --> 01:10:38.454]  Limited fires.
[01:10:38.454 --> 01:10:45.040]  But there's so many facets to this.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.321]  So what I'm going to do now is
[01:10:48.254 --> 01:10:52.638]  Go over the article that spurred me to cover this today.
[01:10:52.638 --> 01:11:12.374]  Because this is another mainstream admission by media that was there that day that yes, indeed, Silverstein was calling the insurance company discussing the controlled demolition of Building 7.
[01:11:12.374 --> 01:11:14.695]  And it's just from another source.
[01:11:15.697 --> 01:11:17.460]  There are hundreds of sources.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:28.538]  I have not just played the CNN and Fox and local news clips of the firemen and police saying, get back, they said they're going to blow it up, they're going to bring it down, and those clips are coming up.
[01:11:28.538 --> 01:11:29.139]  It is too
[01:11:32.543 --> 01:11:48.291]  No, that these reporters and the police and the firemen who weren't part of this would willfully then be told a ridiculous cover story and then play along with it for the last eight years saying that no one ever talked about blowing it up or they didn't blow it up.
[01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:53.353]  The official 9-11 Commission report and the NIST report is it fell from fire.
[01:11:53.353 --> 01:11:56.375]  Not hit by a plane, small fires on three to four floors.
[01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:00.901]  And they say it fell.
[01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:05.685]  And they've given six different reasons and changed it each time for why it fell.
[01:12:05.685 --> 01:12:14.771]  It had the CIA, FBI, IRS, Defense Intelligence, Emergency Management for the state, the county, and the city in that building.
[01:12:14.771 --> 01:12:26.060]  They were running tripod to drill, not in Building 7 that day, they'd moved a mobile command post the night before, and the Deputy Director of FEMA, Mr. Kennedy,
[01:12:28.632 --> 01:12:33.815]  Told ABC News that morning, well, we arrived last night for a terror drill.
[01:12:33.815 --> 01:12:35.976]  And then people said, what do you mean for a terror drill?
[01:12:35.976 --> 01:12:38.577]  Then he said, oh, I was mistaken.
[01:12:38.577 --> 01:12:42.980]  And then it came out in congressional testimony they were running Tripod 2, Abu Towers being attacked.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:47.082]  So they moved out of 7 because they were running a simulated attack on 7.
[01:12:49.386 --> 01:12:52.368]  And then Giuliani, that day, admitted they were running drills.
[01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:59.053]  Then he said, oh, I never said that, despite the fact we have CBS, ABC, Fox, radio, TV.
[01:12:59.053 --> 01:13:01.475]  I mean, just incredible amounts of interviews.
[01:13:01.475 --> 01:13:08.820]  I think, what is it, seven different interviews he did that day, saying, yes, luckily we were out of Building 7 because we were running a drill that day.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.741]  So again, they lie on every front.
[01:13:10.741 --> 01:13:11.702]  That's a whole other issue.
[01:13:14.847 --> 01:13:21.013]  I literally had flashbacks last night of all my research, of all these video clips, of the police officers.
[01:13:21.013 --> 01:13:26.237]  We didn't just watch the videos of the cops saying, get back, they're blowing up Building 7.
[01:13:26.237 --> 01:13:30.882]  We then went out and found, 9-11 Truth went out and found police officers.
[01:13:30.882 --> 01:13:33.224]  I've interviewed five of them.
[01:13:34.687 --> 01:13:38.650]  Who were there and heard the countdown, or were told to get back, they were going to blow it up.
[01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:48.197]  When you're in Manhattan, people walk up, when you're holding up 9-11 truth signs, businessmen and women, firemen come over and pat you on the back and say, we know the truth but we're too scared to speak up.
[01:13:48.197 --> 01:13:50.238]  You know, we heard them say they were going to blow it up.
[01:13:50.238 --> 01:13:54.061]  I mean, I was going to the pizza place at 4.30 in the afternoon.
[01:13:56.457 --> 01:14:14.841]  I have been on Genesis all day on other shows, continued coverage, back at the time, eight and a half years ago, and I heard ABC News on the local news affiliate, 590, the station we're on, saying, oh, they're looking at demolishing Building 7 so it doesn't damage other buildings.
[01:14:14.841 --> 01:14:20.442]  I mean, you heard it, you saw it, how many videos and audio is there of this?
[01:14:20.442 --> 01:14:25.163]  Then it's a clear control demolition, and Silverstein comes out and says, we didn't blow it up.
[01:14:26.357 --> 01:14:30.280]  But previously said they did blow it up.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.484]  And then you get a Fox News reporter going, look, I was there.
[01:14:34.484 --> 01:14:35.785]  I was with the city officials.
[01:14:35.785 --> 01:14:38.268]  I was with the power company and the Port Authority.
[01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:44.333]  And yes, Silverstein called the insurance company and wanted to demolish it.
[01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:46.094]  But we decided not to.
[01:14:46.094 --> 01:14:53.181]  But then it just magically fell and they magically put a internal press release out that the building had already fallen because they had their coordination off.
[01:14:54.235 --> 01:14:55.276]  An hour before it falls.
[01:14:55.276 --> 01:14:57.358]  I mean, we just absolutely open and shut.
[01:14:57.358 --> 01:15:05.425]  This is like catching a serial killer in the act of chopping up a little girl and you go dig in their backyard and find 20 bodies.
[01:15:08.123 --> 01:15:10.705]  And then you find videotapes of them dismembering people.
[01:15:10.705 --> 01:15:14.567]  I mean, it's absolutely open and shut.
[01:15:14.567 --> 01:15:16.128]  And what does it say about the FBI?
[01:15:16.128 --> 01:15:17.789]  What does it say about the Defense Department?
[01:15:17.789 --> 01:15:19.631]  What does it say about the NYPD?
[01:15:19.631 --> 01:15:22.252]  What does it say about all of these people?
[01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:34.881]  And how cowardly the average American is that these cops and firemen would know they blew up Building 7, and the majority of them have kept their mouth shut about it, knowing it killed their colleagues in Tower 1 and 2.
[01:15:39.847 --> 01:15:47.272]  I mean how mega evil is this?
[01:15:47.272 --> 01:15:50.275]  How much worse can it get?
[01:15:50.275 --> 01:15:53.697]  What are we expected to accept next?
[01:15:53.697 --> 01:16:02.143]  And so when we wrote this big article for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the early morning hours, I couldn't sleep after I read this.
[01:16:02.143 --> 01:16:03.945]  I've been fully up since 2.30 in the morning.
[01:16:04.758 --> 01:16:18.127]  And I saw this, I guess, at about 10 at night, Fox News, because it literally caused flashbacks and an epiphany of further understanding that this is the system we live under.
[01:16:18.127 --> 01:16:32.277]  This is the new world order control grid that they can steal our pension funds, they can steal 28 trillion the last year and a half, they can lie about WMDs, they can launch new wars, they can lie about the Gulf of Tonkin, they can do
[01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:40.079]  Whatever they want, because the public will not face up to evil.
[01:16:40.079 --> 01:16:44.101]  They are just ready to buy into any asinine fraud.
[01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:54.367]  And again, just covering Building 7, which is the biggest smoking gun, is only one of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of points that all prove this thing was a complete inside job.
[01:16:54.367 --> 01:17:00.330]  From government documents where they were calling for staging attacks to blame it on foreign enemies, where they did it in many cases, declassified.
[01:17:02.372 --> 01:17:03.713]  The hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:17:03.713 --> 01:17:11.616]  military bases, the list goes on and on and on.
[01:17:11.616 --> 01:17:17.839]  There are just countless examples of this, how the entire story is a fraud.
[01:17:17.839 --> 01:17:29.424]  But what got me so upset was seeing another big high-powered reporter just wade into the PSYOP and just take part in this.
[01:17:29.424 --> 01:17:30.525]  It's thoroughly disgusting.
[01:17:31.633 --> 01:17:33.755]  This is Jeffrey Scott Shapiro.
[01:17:33.755 --> 01:17:35.436]  Shame on Jesse Ventura.
[01:17:35.436 --> 01:17:40.800]  The former Minnesota governor has discredited himself and dishonored and defamed his country.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.742]  Our country is run by offshore banks.
[01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:46.144]  It's always the terrorists, always the bankers.
[01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:49.187]  They always invoke, oh, you're not patriotic.
[01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:58.513]  The former Minnesota governor has discredited himself and dishonored and defamed his country by promoting the mistaken view that our government was involved in the September 11th attacks.
[01:17:58.513 --> 01:18:00.673]  Jesse Ventura should be ashamed of himself and embarrassed.
[01:18:00.673 --> 01:18:04.134]  No, we should be proud of his courage.
[01:18:04.134 --> 01:18:16.376]  The former Minnesota governor recently lent his political credentials to the discredited 9-11 Truth or Movement by aligning and by alleging that the September 11th attacks were either planned or permitted by the United States government.
[01:18:18.612 --> 01:18:27.336]  During a March 10th interview with Barbara Walters on The View, Ventura implied that Bush-Cheney administration used 9-11 as a pretext to start the Iraq War under false pretenses.
[01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:29.417]  Well, we know they used it for that.
[01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:35.160]  We have the memos of Rumsfeld five minutes after saying, go major, go massive, say Iraq did it.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:40.223]  I mean, Ventura apparently developed a theory after former
[01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:49.968]  Kennedy Johnson advisor Robert McNamara visited him at Harvard and allegedly admitted to him that the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which escalated the Vietnam War, never really happened.
[01:18:49.968 --> 01:18:52.989]  That's been declassified for four years.
[01:18:52.989 --> 01:19:02.351]  Ventura was at Harvard four and a half years ago when this got declassified, so McNamara admitted it.
[01:19:02.351 --> 01:19:05.492]  Ventura alleges that McNamara admitted this.
[01:19:05.492 --> 01:19:10.454]  It was declassified at that time, when Ventura was a professor at Harvard.
[01:19:11.536 --> 01:19:13.057]  A visiting professor.
[01:19:13.057 --> 01:19:16.520]  A visiting scholar.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.502]  See how they work?
[01:19:19.502 --> 01:19:19.702]  See?
[01:19:19.702 --> 01:19:22.184]  I mean, just everything's a lie.
[01:19:22.184 --> 01:19:25.546]  Oh, Ventura claims the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:19:25.546 --> 01:19:27.587]  No, Ventura doesn't claim that.
[01:19:27.587 --> 01:19:29.489]  What, next you're going to say that's a lie?
[01:19:29.489 --> 01:19:31.390]  Well, you did, basically.
[01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:40.937]  Perhaps what Ventura is missing is there is probably more controversial evidence and more witnesses who have already established what happened on September 11th than most major historical events.
[01:19:43.004 --> 01:19:47.928]  Oh, so he says we have the majority of paid-off media that agrees with us.
[01:19:47.928 --> 01:19:54.013]  To dispute the conventional historical account is intellectually dishonest and nonsensical.
[01:19:54.013 --> 01:19:55.834]  So he's saying Ventura's dishonest.
[01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:58.696]  This guy just implied Gulf of Tonkin wasn't staged.
[01:19:58.696 --> 01:19:59.237]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.553 --> 01:20:06.154]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[01:21:56.903 --> 01:21:57.484]  I don't know.
[01:22:17.447 --> 01:22:26.669]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:35.852]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.852 --> 01:22:40.453]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.453 --> 01:22:42.253]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.253 --> 01:22:44.754]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:23:02.264 --> 01:23:04.286]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:23:04.286 --> 01:23:06.827]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:23:06.827 --> 01:23:08.908]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[01:23:08.908 --> 01:23:10.009]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:19.341]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:23:19.341 --> 01:23:23.166]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:24.448]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.695]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:23:27.695 --> 01:23:30.998]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:23:30.998 --> 01:23:39.444]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:23:39.444 --> 01:23:44.128]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:23:44.128 --> 01:23:48.151]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:24:04.643 --> 01:24:06.484]  We don't need any thought control.
[01:24:06.484 --> 01:24:13.228]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[01:24:13.228 --> 01:24:16.110]  So, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro continues.
[01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:17.431]  Then I'm going to get into all the evidence.
[01:24:17.431 --> 01:24:18.972]  The most important info is coming up.
[01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.331]  He says that you cannot dispute the historical account.
[01:24:26.331 --> 01:24:29.213]  It is intellectually dishonest and nonsensical.
[01:24:29.213 --> 01:24:38.801]  And then his proof that it's dishonest is to confirm what we saw on television and heard on the radio and what the police were told.
[01:24:38.801 --> 01:24:40.222]  We're not saying the police were involved.
[01:24:40.222 --> 01:24:44.526]  They were told, oh, we're going to blow it up.
[01:24:44.526 --> 01:24:45.927]  We're going to blow up Building 7.
[01:24:45.927 --> 01:24:48.809]  And then they deny they ever said this when it's on record.
[01:24:48.809 --> 01:24:49.390]  That's coming up.
[01:24:50.523 --> 01:24:59.216]  He says, I know this because I was working as a journalist for Garnet News at Ground Zero that day and I remember very clearly what I saw and heard.
[01:24:59.216 --> 01:25:02.981]  And then what he saw and heard confirms what we're saying, but they turn it around.
[01:25:04.025 --> 01:25:25.205]  By the way, I've confirmed from the transcript that two days ago Limbaugh basically covered our, and he's covered our PrisonPlanet.com articles before with credit, he didn't give credit, where he pointed out that they've killed the number one and two guys in Al-Qaeda five times each and never retracted the last time they supposedly killed them in Iraq, and Limbaugh just said, folks, the media is lying to you.
[01:25:25.205 --> 01:25:26.566]  Why are they saying they've killed
[01:25:27.575 --> 01:25:33.718]  Certain leaders, in one case 14 times, and they never retract the last time they said they killed him.
[01:25:33.718 --> 01:25:37.859]  They do that to just practice the lie, just test the media.
[01:25:37.859 --> 01:25:44.402]  It's kind of like Fox News said Monday, Osama Bin Laden had a Facebook account.
[01:25:44.402 --> 01:25:47.103]  And then the next line said, or someone posing as him.
[01:25:47.103 --> 01:25:48.444]  And then they admitted it wasn't him.
[01:25:48.444 --> 01:25:49.584]  They knew it wasn't him.
[01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:52.225]  They usually say, Osama admits he did 9-11.
[01:25:52.225 --> 01:25:53.326]  Look, it was in an email.
[01:25:54.514 --> 01:25:56.955]  Oh look, there's an audio tape and it turns out it's fake.
[01:25:56.955 --> 01:25:58.695]  They do voice brand, it's not him.
[01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:00.296]  They just lie.
[01:26:00.296 --> 01:26:06.058]  So here's this guy's evidence that we're making it up that they blew up Building 7.
[01:26:06.058 --> 01:26:14.980]  And his evidence is they had a big discussion in front of him about blowing it up.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.021]  That's like saying, oh, you're discredited.
[01:26:17.021 --> 01:26:21.662]  No one saw men at the Grassy Knolls shooting at Kennedy.
[01:26:21.662 --> 01:26:23.443]  There were only 50 plus of them that said it.
[01:26:26.852 --> 01:26:29.313]  You got all the witnesses going, yeah, there were men right there.
[01:26:29.313 --> 01:26:31.174]  The motorcycle cop, everybody said, yeah.
[01:26:31.174 --> 01:26:32.215]  But they were told to shut up.
[01:26:32.215 --> 01:26:35.997]  And then, oh, our proof is that we saw.
[01:26:35.997 --> 01:26:39.539]  I mean, he's basically saying, I saw the man at the Grassy Knolls shoot, too.
[01:26:39.539 --> 01:26:40.559]  That disproves it.
[01:26:40.559 --> 01:26:44.261]  I mean, this is the equivalent.
[01:26:44.261 --> 01:26:50.905]  He says, although I arrived at ground zero shortly after the Twin Towers fell, I was in the danger zone created by Building 7.
[01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.426]  Oh, he was in danger.
[01:26:52.426 --> 01:26:54.087]  From the moment it collapsed in the afternoon,
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:59.544]  And the event is one of the key cornerstones of the 9-11 conspiracy theory.
[01:26:59.544 --> 01:27:05.149]  Governor Ventura and many 9-11 truthers allege that government explosives caused the afternoon collapse of Building 7.
[01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:06.010]  This is false!
[01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:07.972]  Oh, he just said so.
[01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:14.458]  I know this because I remember watching all 47 stories of Building 7 suddenly and silently crumble before my eyes.
[01:27:14.458 --> 01:27:16.540]  We've got all the police tapes, videos, you can hear
[01:27:21.024 --> 01:27:24.046]  And in fact, I want Watson, he only put two videos of that up.
[01:27:24.046 --> 01:27:31.010]  I want to add, there's a bunch of audio tapes off the police radios and CBS radio and others where people were saying, boom, boom.
[01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:32.651]  And I've interviewed the witnesses.
[01:27:32.651 --> 01:27:34.912]  They were like, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:27:34.912 --> 01:27:41.516]  But these camera views are about 400 yards back and you hear them.
[01:27:41.516 --> 01:27:43.677]  And then it's, oh, it's amazing.
[01:27:43.677 --> 01:27:45.639]  But he says it was silent.
[01:27:45.639 --> 01:27:48.520]  Building 7 silently fell.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.441]  It was silent.
[01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.822]  He says this is false.
[01:27:54.822 --> 01:28:00.845]  I know this because I remember watching all 47 stories of Building 7 suddenly and silently crumble before my eyes.
[01:28:00.845 --> 01:28:02.106]  Talk about somebody who's delusional.
[01:28:03.157 --> 01:28:23.112]  Shortly before the building collapsed, several NYPD officers and Con Edison, that's the power company, workers told me that Larry Silverstein, the property developer of One World Financial Center, was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they could authorize the controlled demolition of the building since its foundation was already unstable and expected to fall.
[01:28:23.112 --> 01:28:23.873]  So there's the lie.
[01:28:23.873 --> 01:28:26.475]  No modern steel building fallen from fire.
[01:28:26.475 --> 01:28:27.476]  Three do it that day.
[01:28:27.476 --> 01:28:29.157]  Building seven not hit by an aircraft.
[01:28:30.967 --> 01:28:45.135]  So he just weaves disinfo in together here and just calmly slips in Silverstein's on the phone as if they could go into a supposedly terminal building and wire it.
[01:28:45.135 --> 01:28:50.599]  And then we have Silverstein separately saying, we went and wired it and blew it up and gave the order and watched it come down.
[01:28:50.599 --> 01:28:53.040]  And then he said, well, that's not what I meant by that.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:59.284]  But here's another witness saying, oh, I talked to cops and the power company that was based right there and everybody about
[01:29:00.307 --> 01:29:02.368]  Bringing it down.
[01:29:02.368 --> 01:29:06.328]  That's how he discredits us saying they were talking about blowing it up, and clearly did.
[01:29:06.328 --> 01:29:09.789]  He is admitting it.
[01:29:09.789 --> 01:29:16.331]  A controlled demolition would have minimized the damage caused by the building's imminent collapse, which it fell perfectly in its own footprint.
[01:29:16.331 --> 01:29:17.851]  A beautiful controlled demolition.
[01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:19.172]  And potentially save lives.
[01:29:19.172 --> 01:29:20.272]  See the same Silverstein line.
[01:29:21.465 --> 01:29:22.806]  Why, he says he did pull it.
[01:29:22.806 --> 01:29:26.950]  Many law enforcement personnel, firefighters, other journalists were aware of this possible option.
[01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:30.012]  Well, yeah, it was on the news, but then you said we never heard that.
[01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:31.454]  There was no secret.
[01:29:31.454 --> 01:29:34.816]  There was no conspiracy, because it was right out in the open.
[01:29:34.816 --> 01:29:36.638]  But how do you wire a building?
[01:29:36.638 --> 01:29:39.040]  And then why do you now lie and say it wasn't wired?
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.421]  Why does Silverstein do that?
[01:29:40.421 --> 01:29:44.325]  We'll come back, finish up with this, then get into our key article.
[01:29:44.325 --> 01:29:47.647]  Bombshell Silverstein wanted to demolish building on 9-11.
[01:29:47.647 --> 01:29:48.028]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.075 --> 01:29:54.998]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.998 --> 01:30:00.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.503 --> 01:30:01.804]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.804 --> 01:30:07.389]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.389 --> 01:30:12.413]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.413 --> 01:30:17.438]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:17.958 --> 01:30:23.182]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.182 --> 01:30:25.503]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:30.306]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.306 --> 01:30:31.427]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:34.489]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:30:34.489 --> 01:30:38.112]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.112 --> 01:30:41.314]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:41.314 --> 01:30:43.535]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:43.535 --> 01:30:44.456]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:48.178 --> 01:30:52.321]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:52.321 --> 01:30:57.145]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.145 --> 01:30:59.547]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:02.045 --> 01:31:06.008]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.008 --> 01:31:14.875]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:19.499]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.499 --> 01:31:30.328]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:30.948 --> 01:31:40.451]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.451 --> 01:31:45.893]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:45.893 --> 01:31:53.376]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.376 --> 01:31:56.117]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:04.206 --> 01:32:05.467]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.467 --> 01:32:09.350]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:11.632]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.632 --> 01:32:17.517]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.517 --> 01:32:23.742]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.162 --> 01:32:30.124]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.124 --> 01:32:34.325]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.325 --> 01:32:38.606]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.606 --> 01:32:44.548]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.548 --> 01:32:48.109]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:50.090]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.530]  It's here.
[01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:58.009]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:12.091 --> 01:33:18.835]  So, you look at this PSYOP piece by Fox News, and they say there's no secret.
[01:33:18.835 --> 01:33:26.039]  The power company, the police knew that it was being discussed whether we should have a controlled demolition of Building 7.
[01:33:26.039 --> 01:33:30.401]  But it fell perfectly in its own footprint, so we didn't need to.
[01:33:30.401 --> 01:33:32.402]  Not hit by an aircraft, small fires in it.
[01:33:37.958 --> 01:33:48.228]  And for pointing out the obvious, he calls Jesse Ventura a intellectual fraud, a intellectually dishonest person.
[01:33:48.228 --> 01:33:49.689]  No, you're intellectually dishonest.
[01:33:50.563 --> 01:34:00.070]  Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, and if you're a useful idiot, you're one of the most gullible, self-deluded people I've ever run into.
[01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:13.119]  And so you've got all these top police and firemen and military and FBI there, and they blow up Building 7, and Silverstein comes out and says they pulled it, and then later they say, no, we never pulled it.
[01:34:13.119 --> 01:34:14.900]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:19.904]  And then now they're saying, how dare you ever question it, when they admit it was being discussed, whether or not
[01:34:20.799 --> 01:34:21.239]  To pull it.
[01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:24.620]  I mean, do you understand how fundamental this is?
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:34.023]  Now, I want to play some video clips, but first, I'm going to read here on air Paul Joseph Watson's article that we wrote together.
[01:34:34.023 --> 01:34:34.863]  Bombshell.
[01:34:34.863 --> 01:34:38.904]  Silverstein wanted to demolish Building 7 on 9-11.
[01:34:38.904 --> 01:34:48.767]  And the bombshell is, here's another witness, a senior Fox News contributor and reporter, who was there that day
[01:34:51.209 --> 01:34:55.250]  Working for another media outlet, confirming what we all heard and saw on TV.
[01:34:55.250 --> 01:35:10.233]  And then don't forget, one hour before, CNN and BBC, they've now admitted, they wouldn't for three years admit, I predicted it correctly because I looked at who feeds them, Reuters, was told Building 7 had fallen in its own footprint from natural causes.
[01:35:10.233 --> 01:35:17.614]  This is put out at the time that Silverstein's running around telling the police, oh, we can wire that up in five minutes.
[01:35:17.614 --> 01:35:20.035]  I mean, they wire buildings sometimes for a month.
[01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:24.992]  A good percentage of the time, the whole building doesn't collapse properly.
[01:35:24.992 --> 01:35:26.073]  It's very hard to do.
[01:35:26.073 --> 01:35:34.057]  But no, they were just going to wire it and, you know, just very quickly, while four floors are on fire, and no big deal.
[01:35:34.057 --> 01:35:37.019]  They were just going to do this.
[01:35:37.019 --> 01:35:38.940]  So you had to be pre-wired.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:43.722]  It's asinine to say they were looking at a controlled demolition.
[01:35:43.722 --> 01:35:44.883]  If it wasn't pre-set,
[01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:54.573]  And then you have them putting out the story it fell on its own before it fell.
[01:35:54.573 --> 01:36:10.662]  And when we first found the BBC video on a major news archive site and blew the story wide open here, it's covered in my film Terror Storm, the second edition.
[01:36:10.662 --> 01:36:15.685]  It's chronicled in about ten minutes of the two-hour plus film in that section on government-sponsored terror.
[01:36:15.685 --> 01:36:17.927]  It's Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:36:18.953 --> 01:36:20.794]  You should get that film at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:20.794 --> 01:36:21.314]  Make copies.
[01:36:21.314 --> 01:36:22.494]  Give it to everyone you know.
[01:36:22.494 --> 01:36:24.675]  Because, see, they can't just kill Ventura.
[01:36:24.675 --> 01:36:26.556]  They can't just kill me.
[01:36:26.556 --> 01:36:28.077]  They can't claim we committed suicide.
[01:36:28.077 --> 01:36:30.558]  We're on record saying we're not because there's too many.
[01:36:30.558 --> 01:36:35.960]  The number two person in the Japanese government coming out and national news stories attacking him now.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.122]  The guy under the president, the head of the Diet, their Congress, their speaker.
[01:36:41.119 --> 01:36:46.906]  You've got the former German head of intelligence and the former head of their Ministry of Defense saying inside job.
[01:36:46.906 --> 01:36:51.632]  You've got all these physicists and scientists and all these firefighters and police that have gone public.
[01:36:51.632 --> 01:36:52.913]  And you can't get us all.
[01:36:52.913 --> 01:36:56.297]  You kill one of us, it'll only make our information more prominent.
[01:36:56.297 --> 01:36:58.139]  That's what they can't stand.
[01:36:58.139 --> 01:37:00.923]  That's why Larry Silverstein had thugs and it's covered in Truth Rising.
[01:37:01.909 --> 01:37:11.914]  Come up to Luke Rodowski when they were having their weekly protest outside the New Building 7, and they said, we're gonna say your backpack's a bomb, your camera's a gun, we know it isn't, but we're gonna put you in prison for terrorism.
[01:37:11.914 --> 01:37:15.436]  They call the uniformed cops over, and the cops go, that's right, this camera's a gun.
[01:37:16.536 --> 01:37:17.697]  It's all on video.
[01:37:17.697 --> 01:37:21.838]  They would frame someone on video and say they're framing you.
[01:37:21.838 --> 01:37:25.460]  That's how corrupt his security goons are.
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:31.702]  And believe me, this mafia would just love to string Luke up and they do call him death threat his family and his mother and him and...
[01:37:33.223 --> 01:37:36.284]  Other people, just like they do me, and they can't stand it.
[01:37:36.284 --> 01:37:37.945]  They want their police state in.
[01:37:37.945 --> 01:37:44.547]  That's why the ADL and others are calling for Patriot's arrest and law enforcement action against us yesterday, because they can't stand it.
[01:37:44.547 --> 01:37:48.188]  They need to have it out in the open, just like they tried to sell torture as a good thing.
[01:37:48.188 --> 01:37:51.569]  They need to get you to accept it, so it can be made legal and lawful.
[01:37:51.569 --> 01:37:57.892]  All right, let me just read the article here.
[01:37:57.892 --> 01:37:58.632]  We're running out of time.
[01:37:59.656 --> 01:38:00.296]  Bombshell!
[01:38:00.296 --> 01:38:02.957]  Silverstein wanted to demolish Building 7 on 9-11.
[01:38:02.957 --> 01:38:10.818]  Fox News hit piece against 9-11 truth and Jesse Ventura inadvertently reveals a shocking truth.
[01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:13.318]  For the umpteenth time, but here it is again!
[01:38:13.318 --> 01:38:17.899]  And it just brings back how ridiculous it is that this is out in the open!
[01:38:17.899 --> 01:38:25.901]  WTC leaseholder was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they would authorize the controlled demolition of the building.
[01:38:25.901 --> 01:38:28.221]  Then they got the story ready to the media that it fell on its own.
[01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:31.211]  Preface from Alex Jones.
[01:38:31.211 --> 01:38:36.233]  To truly grasp the magnitude of this story, you really have to read the entire article.
[01:38:36.233 --> 01:38:41.655]  Immediately after the Pulit controversy, debunkers claimed there was no plan to conduct a controlled demolition of the building.
[01:38:41.655 --> 01:38:43.075]  And that's all over the news.
[01:38:43.075 --> 01:38:46.496]  See, they've always denied knowing it was on record they were talking about it.
[01:38:46.496 --> 01:38:47.917]  They lied about that.
[01:38:47.917 --> 01:38:51.318]  Now the fact that officials were considering blowing up the building is established.
[01:38:51.698 --> 01:38:55.681]  Silverstein's consistent denial that this took place is a huge smoking gun.
[01:38:55.681 --> 01:39:05.547]  How did Silverstein expect to demolish the building safely when such a process takes weeks or even months to properly set up even without the additional chaos surrounding WTC7 on 9-11?
[01:39:05.547 --> 01:39:15.314]  How could explosives have been correctly placed on such a short notice inside a burning building that had already been evacuated five hours before unless the explosives were already in place?
[01:39:15.314 --> 01:39:18.996]  This new revelation is astounding and it needs to be investigated immediately.
[01:39:18.996 --> 01:39:21.438]  We can talk about how should this be investigated.
[01:39:24.259 --> 01:39:29.281]  As Fox News hit piece against Jesse Ventura in the 9-11 Truth Movement, written by former Washington, D.C.
[01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:48.489]  professor Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, inadvertently reveals the shocking truth that World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein, who collected nearly $500 million, $6 billion total, but $500 million on Building 7, in insurance as a result of the collapse of Building 7, a 47-story structure that was not hit by a plane, but collapsed within seven seconds at free-fall speed on September 11th.
[01:39:49.793 --> 01:39:56.298]  ...was on the phone to his insurance carrier attempting to convince them that the building should be brought down via controlled demolition.
[01:39:56.298 --> 01:40:01.562]  And for six years of the eight and a half, NIST denied it fell at freefall.
[01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:07.066]  But now with the recordings and the peer-reviewed studies, they said, okay, it did fall at freefall.
[01:40:07.066 --> 01:40:09.547]  Not pancaking!
[01:40:09.547 --> 01:40:11.269]  All the math shows it would slow down.
[01:40:11.269 --> 01:40:12.450]  And it fell perfectly.
[01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:14.051]  The central column is blown, it falls in.
[01:40:15.765 --> 01:40:23.209]  Writing for Fox News, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro states, I was working as a journalist for Gannett News at Ground Zero that day and I remember very clearly what we heard.
[01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:26.431]  And he goes on to talk about NYPD officers, Con Edison workers.
[01:40:26.431 --> 01:40:28.812]  We're talking about Silverstein wanting to blow it up.
[01:40:28.812 --> 01:40:37.057]  In February of 2002, Silverstein Properties won $861 million from industrial risk insurers to rebuild on the site of WTC 7.
[01:40:37.057 --> 01:40:40.178]  Silverstein Properties estimated investment in the WTC was $386 million.
[01:40:41.539 --> 01:40:50.108]  The building collapse alone resulted in a payout of $500 million on that one building, based on the contention that it was an unforeseen accident.
[01:40:50.108 --> 01:40:58.357]  And then we have the report saying a controlled demolition would have minimized the damage caused by the building's imminent collapse, is what Shapiro said.
[01:41:00.117 --> 01:41:01.317]  And potentially save lives.
[01:41:01.317 --> 01:41:04.939]  Many law enforcement and firefighters and other journalists were aware of the possible option.
[01:41:04.939 --> 01:41:05.879]  This was no secret.
[01:41:05.879 --> 01:41:07.740]  Yet now they're not denying it was all over the news.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:10.641]  I mean, they denied what was on the news for years.
[01:41:10.641 --> 01:41:12.282]  This was no conspiracy, writes Shapiro.
[01:41:12.282 --> 01:41:13.902]  Well, because the cops weren't involved.
[01:41:13.902 --> 01:41:15.023]  They had to give them a story.
[01:41:15.023 --> 01:41:17.364]  Oh, we're going to wire that up, kind of like you make a hamburger.
[01:41:17.364 --> 01:41:18.404]  Takes five minutes.
[01:41:18.404 --> 01:41:20.085]  Or a ham sandwich.
[01:41:20.085 --> 01:41:27.528]  However, obviously aware of how it would impact his insurance claims, Silverstein has consistently denied that there was ever a plan to intentionally demolish Building 7.
[01:41:28.717 --> 01:41:30.097]  The insurance companies don't.
[01:41:30.097 --> 01:41:31.838]  They're owned by the big banks that are involved in all this.
[01:41:31.838 --> 01:41:32.458]  They go along.
[01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:34.039]  They get big bailouts.
[01:41:34.039 --> 01:41:44.102]  In June of 2005, Silverstein told New York Post journalist Sam Smith that his famous pullet comment, which has been cited as proof of Silverstein's plan to take down the building with explosives, meant something else.
[01:41:44.102 --> 01:41:46.143]  In January 2006, Silverstein's spokesman
[01:41:47.023 --> 01:41:49.184]  Dara McQuillan told the U.S.
[01:41:49.184 --> 01:41:58.448]  Senate Department that the Pullitt comment meant to withdraw firefighters from the building despite the fact that there were no firefighters inside Building 7, as we shall cover later.
[01:41:58.448 --> 01:42:02.670]  There was no mention whatsoever of any plan to demolish the building before it fell.
[01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:16.337]  Shapiro's foxpaw was unwittingly let the cat out of the bag on the fact that Silverstein was aggressively pushing for the building to be intentionally demolished, a claim that he has always verifiously denied, presumably to safeguard against
[01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:22.164]  Putting in doubt the massive insurance payout he received on the basis of the collapse was accidental.
[01:42:22.164 --> 01:42:32.558]  And of course, then every engineer or demolition expert would say, how did you wire a burning building in a few minutes and do it so perfectly?
[01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:49.090]  For over five years since the infamous PBS documentary was aired in which Silverstein states that the decision was made to pull the building, a construction term for controlled demolition, debunkers have attempted to perform all kinds of mental gymnastics in fudging the meaning behind the WTC leaseholder comments.
[01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:57.232]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, this is a quote, we're going to play it in a moment, the video, telling me that they were not sure that they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.804]  And I said, we've had such a terrible loss of lives, maybe the smartest thing to do is just pull it.
[01:43:02.804 --> 01:43:06.066]  And we made that decision to pull it, and we watched the building collapse.
[01:43:06.066 --> 01:43:07.907]  That's plain English.
[01:43:07.907 --> 01:43:10.770]  We made the decision to pull it, and watched it collapse.
[01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:19.536]  Debunkers attempted to claim that Silverstein meant to pull the firefighters from the building due to the danger of the structure it was in, and the explanation was also later claimed by Silverstein's spokesman.
[01:43:19.536 --> 01:43:26.401]  However, both FEMA reported, and the New York Times, even Popular Mechanics reported, that there were no firefighters' actions taken inside Building 7.
[01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:32.151]  Let's go ahead and play Silverstein now.
[01:43:32.151 --> 01:43:36.214]  Let's go ahead and play the audio and video of the text I just read to you.
[01:43:36.214 --> 01:43:38.795]  Here it is.
[01:43:38.795 --> 01:43:45.079]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[01:43:45.079 --> 01:43:51.262]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site.
[01:43:51.262 --> 01:43:52.883]  And there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:43:56.977 --> 01:43:59.558]  Pelted by debris when the North Tower collapsed.
[01:43:59.558 --> 01:44:00.399]  Not true.
[01:44:00.399 --> 01:44:06.743]  Seven burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:44:06.743 --> 01:44:14.587]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:44:14.587 --> 01:44:17.609]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:44:17.609 --> 01:44:20.931]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:44:20.931 --> 01:44:25.233]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[01:44:27.734 --> 01:44:29.417]  What does pull it mean?
[01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:36.990]  In the encyclopedia, in demolition dictionaries, it means to pull it with explosives or cables but to bring a building down in a controlled fashion.
[01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:39.254]  Now on that same PBS documentary,
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:49.903]  They then cut to a month later demolishing building 6 and using the exact same term, pull it, in the same documentary.
[01:44:49.903 --> 01:44:52.163]  As if it isn't clear enough what that means.
[01:44:52.163 --> 01:44:55.244]  The makers of the film sure knew, because this is the next clip in the film.
[01:44:55.244 --> 01:44:56.245]  Here it is.
[01:44:56.245 --> 01:45:02.807]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:45:02.807 --> 01:45:08.388]  Hello?
[01:45:08.388 --> 01:45:09.689]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building 6.
[01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:15.272]  We had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[01:45:15.272 --> 01:45:24.579]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:45:24.579 --> 01:45:34.367]  There's a certain excitement in the air about bringing the last structure down at the World Trade Center.
[01:45:34.367 --> 01:45:41.233]  Okay, so over and over again, they're talking about controlled demolition using the term pullet.
[01:45:43.339 --> 01:45:45.740]  But they said, we never, you didn't hear that on the news.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:46.781]  That's been in newspapers.
[01:45:46.781 --> 01:45:47.781]  I'm a liar.
[01:45:47.781 --> 01:45:49.142]  And I go, but here's the CNN clip.
[01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:49.943]  Here's the Fox clip.
[01:45:49.943 --> 01:45:51.744]  Here's the local CBS clip.
[01:45:51.744 --> 01:45:53.485]  Here's the local Democracy Now!
[01:45:53.485 --> 01:45:55.546]  clip, when she just had a local show.
[01:45:55.546 --> 01:45:57.927]  We went and interviewed the police and said, well, what did you hear?
[01:45:57.927 --> 01:45:58.627]  There was a countdown.
[01:45:58.627 --> 01:45:59.488]  They said they were going to blow it up.
[01:45:59.488 --> 01:46:00.048]  They said, get back.
[01:46:00.048 --> 01:46:05.651]  And they said, you crazy conspiracy theorists, that's not what those cops meant.
[01:46:05.651 --> 01:46:09.053]  And firefighters on tape from the other towers going, there was molten metal.
[01:46:09.053 --> 01:46:10.014]  Jet fuel couldn't do that.
[01:46:10.014 --> 01:46:11.174]  It was like a foundry.
[01:46:11.174 --> 01:46:11.755]  It was like lava.
[01:46:13.641 --> 01:46:14.662]  Something's going on.
[01:46:14.662 --> 01:46:16.763]  You know, jet fuel doesn't do this.
[01:46:16.763 --> 01:46:17.964]  Those fires are almost down.
[01:46:17.964 --> 01:46:20.745]  We have the firefighter tapes they didn't release for two years.
[01:46:20.745 --> 01:46:22.627]  Where they're going, the fires are almost down.
[01:46:22.627 --> 01:46:24.107]  People are in buildings waving.
[01:46:24.107 --> 01:46:26.269]  Suddenly, those columns shatter.
[01:46:26.269 --> 01:46:28.590]  The buildings are turned into ash, into powder.
[01:46:28.590 --> 01:46:29.851]  Blown from top down.
[01:46:29.851 --> 01:46:31.552]  Building 7 blown from the bottom.
[01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:33.173]  A classical controlled demolition.
[01:46:37.469 --> 01:46:38.989]  Now let's go ahead and play clip three.
[01:46:38.989 --> 01:46:46.211]  This is one of many from CNN and other channels where the police are saying, get back, get back, they're gonna bring it down, they're gonna blow it up.
[01:46:46.211 --> 01:46:49.091]  Here's that clip.
[01:46:49.091 --> 01:46:49.291]  CNN.
[01:46:49.291 --> 01:46:56.853]  You know what, start it over.
[01:46:56.853 --> 01:46:58.613]  Back it up, back it up.
[01:46:58.613 --> 01:47:03.754]  You hear those explosions?
[01:47:03.754 --> 01:47:05.275]  And then it goes down.
[01:47:05.275 --> 01:47:06.715]  Okay, now this was re-aired on CNN.
[01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:11.202]  Play it again, listen to this, and then the cops are talking.
[01:47:11.202 --> 01:47:11.422]  Listen.
[01:47:38.891 --> 01:47:45.378]  Just in the last few seconds, another building... So Fox News says the building silently fell.
[01:47:45.378 --> 01:47:46.640]  But we have clip after clip.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.482]  In fact, I want Watson who's listening now.
[01:47:48.482 --> 01:47:51.785]  There's even better clips off the radio and TV.
[01:47:51.785 --> 01:47:54.849]  And there's, let's add to the video the clip of the...
[01:47:57.210 --> 01:48:00.331]  Now here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:00.992]  Describe that.
[01:48:00.992 --> 01:48:02.532]  Now we're going to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:48:27.503 --> 01:48:41.147]  Now, last Friday, Willie Nelson was on with Larry King, and he said, well, I questioned 9-11 because building 7 wasn't hit by a plane and fell, and King goes, no, they were all hit by planes.
[01:48:56.434 --> 01:48:57.075]  End of story.
[01:48:57.075 --> 01:48:57.916]  No.
[01:48:57.916 --> 01:48:58.997]  No.
[01:48:58.997 --> 01:48:59.859]  It was hit by a plane.
[01:48:59.859 --> 01:49:00.359]  No, it wasn't.
[01:49:00.359 --> 01:49:01.040]  They admit it wasn't.
[01:49:01.837 --> 01:49:04.940]  Now let's play another clip here.
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:10.404]  This is BBC reporting Building 7 collapse 20 plus minutes before it fell.
[01:49:10.404 --> 01:49:16.589]  And then for two weeks BBC denied this was real video and said that we were faking it.
[01:49:16.589 --> 01:49:20.973]  Then years later they said no, Reuters gave it to us, it's true.
[01:49:20.973 --> 01:49:25.977]  And for that two-year period they said they lost their archive tapes and that we were liars.
[01:49:25.977 --> 01:49:28.880]  And then, oh wait, it is Jane Graham
[01:49:30.023 --> 01:49:34.569]  It is our reporter, and oh, it was on another BBC channel, and it was on CNN.
[01:49:34.569 --> 01:49:41.898]  So they put the story out at Fallon of natural causes on its own, in its own footprint, and right behind her, through the window, is Building 7.
[01:49:41.898 --> 01:49:42.219]  Here it is.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:51.642]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[01:49:51.642 --> 01:49:56.524]  You might have heard a few moments ago I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[01:49:56.524 --> 01:49:57.425]  And indeed it has.
[01:49:57.425 --> 01:50:02.887]  Apparently that's only a few hundred yards away from where the World Trade Center towers were.
[01:50:02.887 --> 01:50:05.969]  And it seems that this was not a result of a new attack.
[01:50:05.969 --> 01:50:08.150]  It was because the building had been weakened.
[01:50:08.991 --> 01:50:10.554]  During this morning's attacks.
[01:50:10.554 --> 01:50:14.881]  We'll probably find out more now about that from our correspondent Jane Stanley.
[01:50:14.881 --> 01:50:18.588]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.721]  Well, only really what you already know.
[01:50:22.721 --> 01:50:24.382]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[01:50:24.382 --> 01:50:36.169]  There's almost a sense downtown in New York behind me, down by the World Trade Center, of just an area completely closed off as the rescue workers try to do their job.
[01:50:36.169 --> 01:50:39.971]  But this isn't the first building that has suffered as a result.
[01:50:39.971 --> 01:50:40.451]  Stay there!
[01:50:41.926 --> 01:50:42.926]  Back it up about 10 seconds.
[01:50:42.926 --> 01:50:45.407]  When we come back after this quick break, I'm going to finish the clip.
[01:50:45.407 --> 01:50:50.509]  And then we have Aaron Brown, 40 minutes before this, saying it had fallen, reading a script.
[01:50:50.509 --> 01:50:53.170]  And he looks behind him because he's from New York.
[01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:55.311]  And it's going, it's right there.
[01:50:55.311 --> 01:50:56.931]  See, all scripted.
[01:50:56.931 --> 01:51:00.752]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:00.752 --> 01:51:04.654]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:04.654 --> 01:51:08.475]  My name is Spam and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:51:08.857 --> 01:51:13.601]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:15.682]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:17.404]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:21.847]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:51:21.847 --> 01:51:22.928]  Nothing did anything.
[01:51:22.928 --> 01:51:26.911]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:51:26.911 --> 01:51:31.034]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:31.034 --> 01:51:33.676]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:51:34.116 --> 01:51:39.119]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:41.920]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:46.722]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[01:52:00.509 --> 01:52:01.830]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:07.413]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.413 --> 01:52:12.415]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.415 --> 01:52:17.998]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.998 --> 01:52:23.241]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.241 --> 01:52:25.102]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.529 --> 01:52:30.333]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.333 --> 01:52:31.454]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.454 --> 01:52:34.236]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.236 --> 01:52:38.139]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.139 --> 01:52:41.342]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.342 --> 01:52:43.563]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:44.905 --> 01:52:45.825]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:52:54.639 --> 01:52:57.190]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.190 --> 01:52:59.580]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:04.668 --> 01:54:09.752]  But the bigger issue here is, we've been telling the truth from the beginning, that it was all over the news, they were gonna blow up 7.
[01:54:09.752 --> 01:54:10.672]  Then they...
[01:54:11.772 --> 01:54:15.035]  Demolished it and then said, we never said that.
[01:54:15.035 --> 01:54:18.177]  And then Silverstein came out and said, no, we did have a controlled demolition.
[01:54:18.177 --> 01:54:20.519]  Then he said, oh, I didn't mean that.
[01:54:20.519 --> 01:54:25.604]  And now the media just shift gears again and said, OK, we were talking about blowing it up.
[01:54:25.604 --> 01:54:27.825]  It would have been easy to wire it up, but we didn't.
[01:54:27.825 --> 01:54:29.547]  It magically fell on its own.
[01:54:29.547 --> 01:54:36.132]  When every independent demolition expert that looks at it on record says, my God, that's a beautiful controlled demolition.
[01:54:36.132 --> 01:54:37.794]  Only, you know, top experts can do that.
[01:54:37.794 --> 01:54:39.015]  Only a handful of companies.
[01:54:40.282 --> 01:54:43.523]  They tried to blow up the Intel building here in Austin that they built.
[01:54:43.523 --> 01:54:46.165]  The skeleton of it that Intel pulled out of Austin.
[01:54:46.165 --> 01:54:49.026]  When they blew it up a few years ago, it failed.
[01:54:49.026 --> 01:54:50.266]  A top firm.
[01:54:50.266 --> 01:54:50.947]  It failed.
[01:54:50.947 --> 01:54:51.967]  What was that building?
[01:54:51.967 --> 01:54:52.347]  15 stories?
[01:54:52.347 --> 01:54:56.489]  They couldn't even blow it up?
[01:54:56.489 --> 01:55:08.614]  Continuing, let's go back to BBC reporting Building 7 has fallen the exact way it did fall with the whole script before it fell.
[01:55:08.614 --> 01:55:09.195]  And then
[01:55:10.319 --> 01:55:17.361]  When we are change, England confronted the BBC reporter that's talking to Jane Stanley.
[01:55:17.361 --> 01:55:20.162]  I said Jane Graham because we had her on earlier in the week.
[01:55:20.162 --> 01:55:22.523]  He said, I don't remember that.
[01:55:22.523 --> 01:55:24.763]  I was taking my son to football that day.
[01:55:24.763 --> 01:55:26.344]  I wasn't at work on 9-11.
[01:55:26.344 --> 01:55:28.284]  And they said, excuse me?
[01:55:28.284 --> 01:55:30.125]  And then he got real slick and went, oh.
[01:55:31.169 --> 01:55:32.709]  Okay, I was there.
[01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:33.610]  Clear operative.
[01:55:33.610 --> 01:55:37.450]  I mean, most of these guys, big national level, are intelligence ops.
[01:55:37.450 --> 01:55:40.951]  And he suddenly looks at the crowd and goes, it is quite curious, isn't it?
[01:55:40.951 --> 01:55:41.891]  You little people.
[01:55:41.891 --> 01:55:43.092]  He didn't add that last part.
[01:55:43.092 --> 01:55:44.332]  It is quite curious.
[01:55:44.332 --> 01:55:47.113]  Actually, I was reporting that day, all day.
[01:55:47.113 --> 01:55:48.133]  Now I remember.
[01:55:48.133 --> 01:55:49.693]  Thank you for reminding me.
[01:55:49.693 --> 01:55:52.214]  Hmm.
[01:55:52.214 --> 01:55:57.675]  I mean, you know, it is so sick because all that matters is his house, his family, his money.
[01:55:59.451 --> 01:56:02.233]  And it's a bunch of political prostitutes.
[01:56:02.233 --> 01:56:02.953]  Let's finish the clip.
[01:56:24.436 --> 01:56:32.403]  The reason I knew it was a transcript is BBC 24, this is BBC World, almost had the exact same words, and so did CNN.
[01:56:32.403 --> 01:56:40.450]  See, they were all given a script, and it was confirmed, Reuters, internal news feed, right through the Pentagon, to them.
[01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:46.816]  See, I'm not a genius, folks, but I work in the media, and I knew it was the same script, same time.
[01:56:46.816 --> 01:56:48.077]  This was scripted.
[01:56:48.077 --> 01:56:49.398]  They were given this info.
[01:56:49.398 --> 01:56:50.158]  They screwed up.
[01:56:50.865 --> 01:56:52.106]  They said, get the press release ready.
[01:56:52.106 --> 01:56:53.166]  We're getting ready to blow this thing.
[01:56:53.166 --> 01:56:54.267]  Tell them it fell on its own.
[01:56:54.267 --> 01:56:55.407]  We're going with a new plan.
[01:56:55.407 --> 01:56:56.468]  We're not saying we're blowing it.
[01:56:56.468 --> 01:56:57.888]  That's too suspicious.
[01:56:57.888 --> 01:57:01.010]  You know, no one can wire a building, you know, in a few minutes.
[01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.550]  They'll catch us.
[01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:02.971]  We're just going to say it fell on its own.
[01:57:02.971 --> 01:57:03.771]  We're going with that.
[01:57:03.771 --> 01:57:06.273]  We're going with that.
[01:57:06.273 --> 01:57:08.434]  And then they got the release out.
[01:57:08.434 --> 01:57:10.735]  Watch, you don't... It's so incredible.
[01:57:10.735 --> 01:57:12.095]  I can just go into their minds.
[01:57:12.095 --> 01:57:13.136]  Let's finish the clip.
[01:57:13.462 --> 01:57:20.828]  Down by the World Trade Center, just an area completely closed off as the rescue workers try to do their job.
[01:57:20.828 --> 01:57:24.691]  But this isn't the first building that has suffered as a result.
[01:57:24.691 --> 01:57:38.702]  We know that part of the Marriott Hotel next to the World Trade Center also collapsed as a result of this huge amount of falling debris from 110 floors of the two twin towers of the World Trade Center.
[01:57:39.142 --> 01:57:43.786]  As you can see behind me, the Trade Center appears to be still burning.
[01:57:43.786 --> 01:57:46.748]  We see these huge clouds of smoke and ash.
[01:57:46.748 --> 01:57:47.689]  And there's Seven.
[01:57:47.689 --> 01:57:54.174]  We know that behind that, there's an empty piece of what was a very familiar New York skyline.
[01:57:54.174 --> 01:57:54.915]  And there's the building.
[01:57:54.915 --> 01:57:58.057]  A symbol of the financial prosperity.
[01:57:58.057 --> 01:58:03.061]  And the disinfo ops came out and said, we lied, that wasn't real video.
[01:58:03.061 --> 01:58:06.064]  And said that Seven had fallen in the video.
[01:58:07.219 --> 01:58:11.581]  But now because we've proven it to the public, they're going, OK, we were talking about blowing it up.
[01:58:11.581 --> 01:58:13.222]  Nothing to see here.
[01:58:13.222 --> 01:58:15.303]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[01:58:15.303 --> 01:58:16.163]  Move along.
[01:58:16.163 --> 01:58:17.444]  Move along.
[01:58:17.444 --> 01:58:20.486]  Little Jedi mind trick on the public.
[01:58:20.486 --> 01:58:22.326]  OK?
[01:58:22.326 --> 01:58:25.868]  So we have another reporter from Fox News saying, yeah, we were there.
[01:58:25.868 --> 01:58:27.609]  They were talking about blowing it up.
[01:58:27.609 --> 01:58:29.550]  What's the big deal?
[01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:31.211]  But we didn't blow it up.
[01:58:31.211 --> 01:58:33.352]  And Silverstein never said they were going to blow it up.
[01:58:35.458 --> 01:58:36.760]  I mean, think about this.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.522]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:37.522 --> 01:58:42.510]  Stay with us with more.

[01:59:02.879 --> 01:59:11.602]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.602 --> 01:59:15.664]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:24.692]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.

[01:59:28.514 --> 01:59:29.755]  Others don't.
[01:59:29.755 --> 01:59:31.896]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:59:48.266 --> 01:59:48.766]  Others don't.
[01:59:53.726 --> 02:00:02.252]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network Big Brother
[02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:08.451]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.451 --> 02:00:10.212]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.212 --> 02:00:11.793]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.793 --> 02:00:13.333]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.333 --> 02:00:17.535]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.535 --> 02:00:22.338]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.338 --> 02:00:30.462]  In 1938, Joseph Goebbels, who came to power with Hitler as propaganda minister, firebombing their own capital, another stage to that,
[02:00:31.892 --> 02:00:33.854]  You can pull up his quotes.
[02:00:33.854 --> 02:00:35.375]  I've read many of the papers he wrote.
[02:00:35.375 --> 02:00:41.539]  He gave speeches saying, you know, to his propaganda corps, lies don't have to be good.
[02:00:41.539 --> 02:00:45.062]  They have to speak to people's laziness and their fear.
[02:00:45.062 --> 02:00:47.524]  And so make it simple.
[02:00:47.524 --> 02:00:48.445]  And so that's what they do.
[02:00:48.445 --> 02:00:51.507]  I mean, they blow the building up in front of you.
[02:00:51.507 --> 02:00:53.188]  They've got different stories going.
[02:00:53.188 --> 02:00:59.213]  First, they were going to announce it, then they weren't.
[02:00:59.213 --> 02:00:59.353]  And
[02:01:00.796 --> 02:01:10.362]  This article by Watson, great job by Paul Watson, goes on and on and on through all the other eyewitnesses and Greg Bartmer and police officers and people.
[02:01:10.362 --> 02:01:19.128]  You know, not just the videos from CNN cops saying they're bringing it down, get back, that building's about to blow up, boom, boom, boom, it falls.
[02:01:19.128 --> 02:01:22.731]  But just all these other witnesses and all the other facets and the points
[02:01:24.107 --> 02:01:29.213]  We're not safe as a society unless we start facing up to evil.
[02:01:29.213 --> 02:01:36.622]  But people think if they play the mind game, the mental mind game of denying something's going on, it makes it go away.
[02:01:37.668 --> 02:01:39.549]  It doesn't make it go away.
[02:01:39.549 --> 02:01:41.551]  It only gets worse.
[02:01:41.551 --> 02:02:00.964]  And now you've got Limbaugh and Michael Savage and others coming out and saying, especially Savage, that he believes Obama's gonna stage terror attacks to blame it on us, and Clinton's out there saying there's about to be bombings, it's gonna be your fault, you better shut up and do what we say, and the ADL's saying arrest people that criticize Obamacare, basically, and the rhetoric's really getting bad.
[02:02:00.964 --> 02:02:01.844]  Well, yeah.
[02:02:01.844 --> 02:02:03.725]  I mean, of course the government did Oklahoma City.
[02:02:03.725 --> 02:02:06.307]  That evidence is even more voluminous than 9-11.
[02:02:06.307 --> 02:02:07.408]  Absolutely red-handed.
[02:02:07.808 --> 02:02:12.489]  On every front.
[02:02:12.489 --> 02:02:13.709]  Politicians come and go.
[02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:16.890]  Bill Clinton, George Bush, all these people.
[02:02:16.890 --> 02:02:24.712]  When you understand the military mind, you understand the Pentagon mind, 99.99% of them aren't involved in these things.
[02:02:24.712 --> 02:02:33.873]  But over and over again, the Pentagon stages terror attacks, even on their own forces, that's in Northwoods, to kill our own troops, to get them angry at a foreign enemy.
[02:02:33.873 --> 02:02:35.474]  But it's even worse than that.
[02:02:35.474 --> 02:02:36.414]  It is stated
[02:02:37.506 --> 02:02:44.489]  West Point, an Army War College doctrine of collateral damage and acceptable losses.
[02:02:44.489 --> 02:02:48.990]  It goes back to chess invented in Persia 4,000 years ago.
[02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:53.092]  You sacrifice a pawn.
[02:02:53.092 --> 02:02:54.032]  It's called a gambit.
[02:02:56.025 --> 02:03:16.838]  And it's taught 101 in field officer, captain and above, that hey, you got a thousand people under you, you're a colonel, you're taking orders from a general, don't tell your men this, but go ahead and send 10 or 15 of them into an area, knowing they're gonna get killed, but it'll draw out the enemy, and then you'll be able to kill the enemy and save more of your force.
[02:03:16.838 --> 02:03:24.423]  Because if you send your whole force in, you'll end up losing 10, 20, 30 times potentially what you'll lose if you just sacrifice 10 men.
[02:03:25.993 --> 02:03:29.035]  And once you buy into that, America's got to get tough.
[02:03:29.035 --> 02:03:31.997]  It's not going to fight the Islam threat unless we do this.
[02:03:31.997 --> 02:03:35.919]  That's why we're doing this.
[02:03:35.919 --> 02:03:37.420]  That's the argument.
[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:39.001]  That's what they say in Northwoods.
[02:03:39.001 --> 02:03:47.787]  Well, our country won't face the communist threat and we need to do it, so we're going to stage terror attacks, bomb DC, bomb Miami, kill US troops at bases, and blame it on the commies.
[02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:49.308]  We're going to have nuclear war with them.
[02:03:51.826 --> 02:03:54.186]  And Kennedy said, no, I'm firing L.L.
[02:03:54.186 --> 02:04:00.508]  Lehmann, sir, and Curtis LeMay, and all the rest of you, and they said, no, we're firing you, dead!
[02:04:00.508 --> 02:04:15.550]  And then it was declassified two months ago by the State Department, this is mainstream news, that Bobby Kennedy disagreed with his brother, and that he was for staging events, but he wanted to do it in Latin America.
[02:04:15.550 --> 02:04:19.031]  I mean, that's how standard this is.
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:27.545]  2004, they declassified the manual being used up until this date.
[02:04:27.545 --> 02:04:35.631]  Well, we don't know past this date, past 2004, but it was the current manual, where they teach army captains in black ops, you can go read it, how to stage false flags.
[02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:45.419]  You're outnumbered by a force in a guerrilla situation, to stage a false flag against the people you're trying to protect, to motivate them to get behind what you're doing for the greater good.
[02:04:45.419 --> 02:04:47.041]  That's how we win.
[02:04:47.041 --> 02:04:48.282]  Yeah, that's how you win, isn't it?
[02:04:49.244 --> 02:04:52.248]  What's your home worth?
[02:04:52.248 --> 02:04:54.551]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:04:54.551 --> 02:04:57.075]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[02:06:00.967 --> 02:06:03.971]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:03.971 --> 02:06:09.318]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.318 --> 02:06:11.361]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.361 --> 02:06:16.367]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.367 --> 02:06:17.549]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:18.290]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.650 --> 02:06:20.552]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.552 --> 02:06:21.613]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.613 --> 02:06:23.814]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.814 --> 02:06:25.156]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.156 --> 02:06:26.677]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.677 --> 02:06:31.961]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:31.961 --> 02:06:35.084]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.524 --> 02:06:39.347]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.347 --> 02:06:40.588]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.588 --> 02:06:41.489]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.489 --> 02:06:42.590]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.590 --> 02:06:43.511]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.511 --> 02:06:44.612]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.612 --> 02:06:47.674]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.674 --> 02:06:49.436]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.436 --> 02:06:50.356]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.066 --> 02:07:01.367]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.367 --> 02:07:06.972]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:06.972 --> 02:07:11.976]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:07:11.976 --> 02:07:17.021]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:07:17.541 --> 02:07:22.765]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:22.765 --> 02:07:25.086]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:07:25.086 --> 02:07:29.889]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:29.889 --> 02:07:31.010]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:34.072]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:07:34.072 --> 02:07:37.695]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:37.695 --> 02:07:40.897]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:40.897 --> 02:07:43.118]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:43.118 --> 02:07:44.039]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:49.042 --> 02:07:51.904]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:51.904 --> 02:07:56.727]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:56.727 --> 02:08:02.751]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:08:02.751 --> 02:08:09.376]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.376 --> 02:08:12.358]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.905 --> 02:08:16.826]  That's right, and it's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:16.826 --> 02:08:21.086]  And the American people and the people of the world are waking up to carry on every front.
[02:08:21.086 --> 02:08:26.268]  Coming up the next hour, I'm going to get into Earth Day they had yesterday.
[02:08:26.268 --> 02:08:33.969]  Austin's announced $2.6 billion in new taxes over the next three years to be paid into the large banks just where I live.
[02:08:33.969 --> 02:08:37.770]  We're going to get into CNN calling for one-child policy.
[02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:40.751]  It says don't be so keen on having babies.
[02:08:40.751 --> 02:08:43.933]  How about adopting a child instead or implementing a one-child policy?
[02:08:43.933 --> 02:08:57.179]  We're going to be talking about that and the financial looting legislation that supposedly is going to get the big banks, believe in the Texas Banking Association saying it's a fraud takeover and another bailout to the big central banks.
[02:08:57.179 --> 02:08:57.859]  That's coming up.
[02:08:57.859 --> 02:08:59.080]  Now I spent the last hour
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:09.564]  On Fox News admitting that the government and Larry Silverstein were looking at the controlled demolition of Building 7 and they're now admitting that they were considering blowing it up.
[02:09:09.564 --> 02:09:11.385]  That's another big admission.
[02:09:11.385 --> 02:09:12.565]  The article's bombshell.
[02:09:12.565 --> 02:09:14.646]  Silverstein wanted to demolish Building 7 on 9-11.
[02:09:16.207 --> 02:09:24.494]  And the Fox News article is called Shame on Jesse Ventura, and that's where they admitted that their reporter was there, and oh, it's no big deal that we were going to blow it up.
[02:09:24.494 --> 02:09:30.278]  So all these years later, all the video of cops saying, get back, the government's going to blow it up, they ignored all that.
[02:09:30.278 --> 02:09:32.140]  Here's another admission.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:32.881]  It is a big deal.
[02:09:32.881 --> 02:09:37.945]  All right, shifting gears for the balance of the hour, we really appreciate his time.
[02:09:37.945 --> 02:09:43.929]  He's one of the most prestigious authors and lecturers and newsletter writers for Newsmax out there.
[02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:51.711]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is a prestigious brain surgeon and expert on the brain.
[02:09:51.711 --> 02:09:57.193]  RussellBlaylockMD.com is one of the websites you can visit.
[02:09:57.193 --> 02:09:59.753]  He's a board-certified neurosurgeon, author, and lecturer.
[02:09:59.753 --> 02:10:08.775]  He attended LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans and completed his general surgical internship and neurosurgical residency at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.
[02:10:09.395 --> 02:10:14.740]  During his residency, he ran the neurology program for one year and did a fellowship in neurosurgery after his residency.
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:19.744]  For the past 25 plus years, he's participated in neurosurgery in addition to having a nutritional practice.
[02:10:19.744 --> 02:10:24.768]  He recently retired from both practices to devote full-time to nutritional studies and research.
[02:10:24.768 --> 02:10:32.075]  During his residency training, he worked with the eminent neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Kempe, together they developed the Trans
[02:10:33.977 --> 02:10:35.218]  It's all scientific terms.
[02:10:35.218 --> 02:10:41.020]  Removal of intervascular tumors, which is one of the most widely used systems today.
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:45.541]  He has presented their cases, utilizing the technique to the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
[02:10:45.541 --> 02:10:47.962]  Look, it's a long bio, multi-pages.
[02:10:47.962 --> 02:10:49.863]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:10:49.863 --> 02:10:58.526]  And of course, we've had many other medical doctors and brain surgeons and endocrinologists and just on, backing up what he's saying.
[02:10:58.526 --> 02:10:59.826]  But he has all the studies.
[02:10:59.826 --> 02:11:00.927]  This stuff is not secret.
[02:11:02.228 --> 02:11:07.151]  And we're going to be discussing it with him today, but he was very critical of the H1N1.
[02:11:07.151 --> 02:11:10.654]  He pointed out that it popped up in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year.
[02:11:10.654 --> 02:11:14.897]  Many other scientists, virologists said it was engineered in a lab.
[02:11:14.897 --> 02:11:15.437]  We know that
[02:11:16.914 --> 02:11:19.775]  Other big companies with the bird flu killed a bunch of people.
[02:11:19.775 --> 02:11:20.856]  That was the London Telegraph.
[02:11:20.856 --> 02:11:24.618]  In fact, Google homeless die and bird flu vaccine trial.
[02:11:24.618 --> 02:11:26.678]  That got covered up.
[02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:33.081]  And then, what, three months ago, we had Wolfgang Wudrig, a medical doctor from Germany on who ran the EU 47 nation board.
[02:11:36.843 --> 02:11:47.632]  Prefacing this before we go to him, 47 nation board that found that the UN and others were paid off by Big Pharma to lie and create this hoax.
[02:11:47.632 --> 02:11:49.493]  And now we have all this mainstream news.
[02:11:49.493 --> 02:11:54.657]  New Canadian study suggests seasonal flu shot increased H1N1 risk.
[02:11:54.657 --> 02:11:55.298]  Here's another one.
[02:11:57.958 --> 02:11:58.038]  It's
[02:12:15.884 --> 02:12:20.468]  So again, Dr. Blaylock and others got attacked by the mainstream media for even questioning this.
[02:12:20.468 --> 02:12:22.610]  Well, here they are, vindicated yet again.
[02:12:22.610 --> 02:12:27.253]  So we're going to talk about the flu in hindsight and then other toxins in our food and water.
[02:12:27.253 --> 02:12:29.135]  Dr. Blaylock, thanks for joining us.
[02:12:29.135 --> 02:12:30.316]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:30.316 --> 02:12:31.016]  Good to have you here.
[02:12:31.016 --> 02:12:31.997]  Well, you've got the floor.
[02:12:31.997 --> 02:12:41.184]  Let's talk about vaccines, mercury, the studies that you've looked at about the increases of Alzheimer's, brain damage.
[02:12:41.184 --> 02:12:42.365]  Explain what's really going on here.
[02:12:43.618 --> 02:12:55.165]  Well, you know, I think just a brief review of this whole fiasco of H1N1 is very telling and we need to remember this next year because this is going to be revisited.
[02:12:55.165 --> 02:12:57.826]  We're going to go through the same thing all over again.
[02:12:57.826 --> 02:13:09.633]  And remember the major government organizations, CDC, the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, all of them were just sending the same message out
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:11.981]  This is going to be a killer virus.
[02:13:11.981 --> 02:13:15.283]  It's going to target pregnant women.
[02:13:15.283 --> 02:13:17.123]  It's going to target young people.
[02:13:17.123 --> 02:13:20.705]  It's going to be the most devastating thing we've ever seen.
[02:13:20.705 --> 02:13:25.087]  World Health Organization, of course, started this nonsense.
[02:13:25.087 --> 02:13:34.172]  Yet, when you actually got into the journals, the real high-tech journals that were discussing this, it didn't match what the government was saying.
[02:13:35.053 --> 02:13:43.476]  And we talked about our government as well as the international bodies at the UN World Health Organization.
[02:13:43.476 --> 02:13:59.701]  What the science was actually saying is that this virus is difficult to transmit, more difficult than the seasonal flu, that it is not that pathogenic, and they didn't expect it to cause that much death.
[02:13:59.701 --> 02:14:04.382]  All of this science reported in the best of the science journals was ignored.
[02:14:05.896 --> 02:14:14.159]  Even the CDC was secretly doing studies which found that this virus is very difficult to transmit.
[02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:20.281]  Yet when you turned on your television, here's the news media saying, oh, this is so easy to transmit.
[02:14:20.281 --> 02:14:22.361]  It's just going to spread all over the world.
[02:14:22.361 --> 02:14:28.764]  We're expecting the ICU intensive care units to be overwhelmed.
[02:14:28.764 --> 02:14:32.285]  We're not going to have enough respirators for all the people that's going to need them.
[02:14:33.604 --> 02:14:37.387]  Young women are going to die that are pregnant in mass numbers.
[02:14:37.387 --> 02:14:44.153]  They were putting out figures of 90,000 expected to die, on and on and on.
[02:14:44.153 --> 02:14:49.057]  Yet, the science the whole time was saying, none of that's true.
[02:14:49.057 --> 02:15:00.446]  When you actually got on the CDC site, you found out, well, your whole basis for this mass vaccination and threat of forced vaccination
[02:15:00.956 --> 02:15:04.379]  That's no foundation whatsoever from your own data.
[02:15:04.379 --> 02:15:16.407]  When it soon became obvious that the number of infections by H1N1 was nowhere near what the government was saying.
[02:15:16.407 --> 02:15:20.931]  And that the death rate was far less than one hundredth of one percent.
[02:15:20.931 --> 02:15:26.535]  So that meant your chances of being seriously ill or dying from this flu
[02:15:27.578 --> 02:15:29.179]  Uh, was less than 99.9%.
[02:15:29.179 --> 02:15:38.225]  Uh, so, uh, it was less dangerous than the regular seasonal flu.
[02:15:38.225 --> 02:15:44.249]  Uh, and then when the actual flu came through its first big wave, that's exactly what we saw.
[02:15:44.249 --> 02:15:49.372]  The death rate for the entire world was astronomically low.
[02:15:49.372 --> 02:15:51.473]  Incredibly low.
[02:15:51.473 --> 02:15:53.415]  Uh, well, then their next, uh, uh, uh,
[02:15:54.735 --> 02:15:58.576]  The method of scaring the public was, oh, we're watching the Southern Hemisphere.
[02:15:58.576 --> 02:16:01.157]  We're expecting millions to die.
[02:16:01.157 --> 02:16:06.679]  Well, the flu went through the Southern Hemisphere in both of its ways.
[02:16:06.679 --> 02:16:12.141]  It had one of the lowest death rates of any flu season that's ever been recorded.
[02:16:12.141 --> 02:16:13.762]  And that includes young children.
[02:16:13.762 --> 02:16:15.963]  That includes pregnant women.
[02:16:15.963 --> 02:16:21.045]  That includes young, all of these so-called targeted age groups.
[02:16:21.045 --> 02:16:24.166]  And then I started looking at the New England Journal of Medicine.
[02:16:24.867 --> 02:16:29.969]  Which was doing the largest studies on the flu in the southern and northern hemisphere.
[02:16:29.969 --> 02:16:35.050]  And ironically, they left out one of the most important factors in the people that were dying.
[02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:39.332]  And asked that they were obese and that they were smoking.
[02:16:39.332 --> 02:16:43.793]  Well, they did mention the obese connection, but it would never enter the media.
[02:16:44.765 --> 02:16:57.670]  Well, doctor, most of the deaths we saw were people who were 75 years old, had double the amputations from diabetes, had lung problems, and then I would see a month later that, oh, this fella in Austin really didn't die.
[02:16:57.670 --> 02:17:00.731]  It was a false positive H1N1.
[02:17:00.731 --> 02:17:02.692]  They died of complications from something else.
[02:17:02.692 --> 02:17:06.313]  So there was also lots of hyping people who hadn't died from it.
[02:17:06.834 --> 02:17:09.755]  Well, everything they said about it ended up a lie.
[02:17:09.755 --> 02:17:20.380]  In other words, they were saying, well, the people were dying from bacterial pneumonia after they got the flu, and that it was pneumococcal pneumonia, and therefore they need a pneumococcal vaccine as well.
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:29.004]  Well, when you look at the autopsy report, it says, well, most of the pneumonias were not pneumococcal, and there was no vaccine to protect anybody from
[02:17:29.631 --> 02:17:33.552]  And as you said, most of these people have serious illnesses.
[02:17:33.552 --> 02:17:40.215]  Diabetes, autoimmune diseases, immune deficiency diseases, cancers.
[02:17:40.215 --> 02:17:43.436]  So even in the children that were dying, they were sick children.
[02:17:43.436 --> 02:17:45.897]  They were not normal, healthy children.
[02:17:45.897 --> 02:17:54.840]  But if they could find a so-called healthy person that died from it or became seriously ill, that's the one they plastered all over the news.
[02:17:55.370 --> 02:18:01.615]  So they would tell the public, oh, you're a healthy teenager, you're at horrendous risk, look, here's a case.
[02:18:01.615 --> 02:18:04.837]  They had to search high and low to find the case.
[02:18:04.837 --> 02:18:08.360]  Most of the cases were from sick children.
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:11.322]  Well, it's even worse than that!
[02:18:11.322 --> 02:18:15.946]  You had very few cases of anyone else dying from this flu.
[02:18:15.946 --> 02:18:23.291]  It was all concocted from A to Z, and this is what's so upsetting about the government.
[02:18:24.548 --> 02:18:25.629]  They knew all of this.
[02:18:25.629 --> 02:18:30.032]  They had access to the same information I did.
[02:18:30.032 --> 02:18:35.736]  So they knew from the very beginning and all throughout that this was a lie.
[02:18:35.736 --> 02:18:45.363]  This was all nothing but a concocted epidemic to sell vaccines and to do damage to large numbers of people in this country.
[02:18:45.363 --> 02:18:49.126]  Now you remember when I first talked to you about this, when all this started,
[02:18:49.736 --> 02:18:59.179]  I said Guillain-Barré is going to be a big danger of this vaccine, particularly in the countries where they're using the MS-59 azure.
[02:18:59.179 --> 02:19:00.080]  Well, let me interrupt you.
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.400]  Let me interrupt you, doctor.
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:11.564]  I know a whole bunch of people, talk show hosts that are 42 years old, you name it, that went and got the shot and their hands and feet are still numb and they got Guillain-Barré.
[02:19:11.564 --> 02:19:14.385]  And I know people that are in the hospital dying right now.
[02:19:14.385 --> 02:19:18.386]  I know a whole bunch of people in Austin that took it and are in deep trouble.
[02:19:19.124 --> 02:19:27.950]  Well, my point being is when they first started this, they said, oh, we're carefully tracking Gillian Beret because of the risk factors.
[02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:31.252]  Have you heard any major network do a follow-up?
[02:19:31.252 --> 02:19:31.493]  No.
[02:19:31.493 --> 02:19:34.995]  Have you seen in any newspaper a follow-up of what they found?
[02:19:34.995 --> 02:19:43.741]  But what you're saying is exactly true, because I get emails from all over the world and all over the country of people telling me the same story.
[02:19:46.063 --> 02:19:46.883]  Doc, stay there.
[02:19:46.883 --> 02:19:47.624]  Doc, sorry to interrupt.
[02:19:47.624 --> 02:19:48.144]  We got a break.
[02:19:48.144 --> 02:19:50.166]  Come back and tell us that story on the other side.
[02:19:50.166 --> 02:19:53.208]  I've got a list of questions for you.
[02:19:53.208 --> 02:19:54.449]  What was really in the vaccine?
[02:19:54.449 --> 02:19:58.132]  Well, we have the insert, but you can tell us what these ingredients mean.
[02:19:58.132 --> 02:19:58.632]  Stay with us.
[02:19:58.632 --> 02:19:59.553]  Dr. Russell Blaylock.

[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:32.081]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:32.081 --> 02:21:36.623]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.623 --> 02:21:42.466]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.466 --> 02:21:46.108]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:46.108 --> 02:21:48.929]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.929 --> 02:21:53.872]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:54.172]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.733 --> 02:21:58.334]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:58.334 --> 02:22:03.557]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.557 --> 02:22:05.878]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:05.878 --> 02:22:09.079]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.079 --> 02:22:14.182]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.182 --> 02:22:18.384]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.704 --> 02:22:21.048]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.048 --> 02:22:23.932]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.932 --> 02:22:26.856]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.856 --> 02:22:34.448]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.768 --> 02:22:40.172]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.172 --> 02:22:43.034]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.034 --> 02:22:46.717]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.717 --> 02:22:47.798]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.798 --> 02:22:49.119]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.119 --> 02:22:50.620]  Invisible Empire.

[02:24:06.826 --> 02:24:08.767]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest.
[02:24:08.767 --> 02:24:11.789]  You can find out a lot more information at his website.
[02:24:11.789 --> 02:24:14.410]  We'll give you those several times before he leaves us.
[02:24:14.410 --> 02:24:19.974]  But while you were talking, doctor, you were trying to finish up a story about the reports you're getting.
[02:24:19.974 --> 02:24:22.335]  But, I mean, I have family friends.
[02:24:22.335 --> 02:24:27.458]  My dad has scores of patients that he knows that have gone to the hospital.
[02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:28.859]  Many of them have recovered, thank God.
[02:24:28.859 --> 02:24:30.260]  And the doctors are even telling him.
[02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:38.044]  And I've seen this a few places in the news, but it's not a big news story like you were saying, that yes, you have Guillain-Barre, and we believe the vaccine caused it.
[02:24:38.044 --> 02:24:48.711]  In fact, talking to Dale Dudley, who has the number one talk show in the morning on 93.7, it's the sister station to 590, our local affiliate, the AM.
[02:24:48.711 --> 02:24:56.496]  I mean, he has numb fingers and numb toes, and he went to the doctor and they said, the vaccine did this to you, but that was the seasonal shot he took.
[02:24:56.496 --> 02:24:56.856]  Go ahead.
[02:24:58.312 --> 02:24:58.752]  Right.
[02:24:58.752 --> 02:25:10.237]  You know, I got an email from a man who said he felt so bad because he had encouraged his father to get the H1N1 vaccine.
[02:25:10.237 --> 02:25:14.919]  And he got it, and his father ended up with a severe case of Guillain-Barre.
[02:25:14.919 --> 02:25:18.221]  Ended up on a respirator for three months.
[02:25:18.221 --> 02:25:20.562]  And had just gotten out of the hospital.
[02:25:20.562 --> 02:25:23.043]  He's still severely weak.
[02:25:23.043 --> 02:25:27.465]  While they were in the hospital, they saw a 10-year-old child
[02:25:28.069 --> 02:25:35.872]  Who ended up with Gideon Bray, ended up on a respirator for over a month and is still on the respirator.
[02:25:35.872 --> 02:25:49.616]  I've gotten over a list of 200 women who've lost their babies because they believe the government hype that women needed to get the H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy.
[02:25:49.616 --> 02:25:57.059]  And I warned people of that, that you would have a tremendous number of spontaneous abortions
[02:25:58.396 --> 02:26:13.361]  And the big risk, the really big thing, is it's shown that if you over-stimulate immunity during mid-pregnancy, you increase the incidence of schizophrenia and autism as much as tenfold.
[02:26:13.361 --> 02:26:26.785]  So we still have to wait and see what is going to be the full impact of this, because it's going to take a good ten years before we know just how many people's babies have been ruined by this vaccine.
[02:26:27.455 --> 02:26:32.736]  This isn't like that tranquilizer in the 40s and 50s where they came out deformed and you saw it right away.
[02:26:32.736 --> 02:26:38.717]  But again, you're a medical doctor and brain surgeon, but let's talk about why this does that to the brain.
[02:26:38.717 --> 02:26:45.719]  But I remember just reading in the inserts of vaccines, period, they had always said don't give them to pregnant women.
[02:26:45.719 --> 02:26:51.560]  And now, sickeningly, they were on the news saying pregnant women particularly need this.
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.860]  I mean, this is diabolical.
[02:26:53.686 --> 02:27:14.221]  Well, they were doing that at the time there was convincing evidence from our research in neuroscience that if you stimulate the immune system of a pregnant woman mid-term, uh, you know, in mid-pregnancy, uh, you produce this high incidence of autism and schizophrenia.
[02:27:14.221 --> 02:27:21.046]  Well, uh, I don't think I would trade having my child have autism or schizophrenia
[02:27:21.812 --> 02:27:29.736]  Well, there's a false idea they were going to protect them during pregnancy because there's no evidence the vaccine had any protection whatsoever of anybody.
[02:27:29.736 --> 02:27:31.457]  But what about the autoimmune response?
[02:27:31.457 --> 02:27:33.138]  What about the autoimmune response?
[02:27:33.138 --> 02:27:43.283]  From the medical stuff I read, correct me if I'm wrong, the miscarriages, though, throughout the pregnancy, the body gets overstimulated and then sees the fetus as an outsider.
[02:27:43.283 --> 02:27:45.984]  Yeah, you know, that's part of it.
[02:27:45.984 --> 02:27:50.887]  It interferes during the baby's development.
[02:27:51.839 --> 02:28:00.526]  With the placenta, so that the oxygen and blood supply to the baby is damaged, and you have a spontaneous abortion.
[02:28:00.526 --> 02:28:06.090]  And this was occurring in women who were almost near term.
[02:28:06.090 --> 02:28:10.914]  So here they were almost ready to have their baby, and they lost it.
[02:28:10.914 --> 02:28:14.917]  Well, if you look at the scientific literature, you're not surprised by that.
[02:28:16.227 --> 02:28:25.194]  But the media played a big role in getting these women to go take this ridiculous vaccine.
[02:28:25.194 --> 02:28:42.790]  And, you know, as I say, there's just compelling research that if you vaccinate with these powerful vaccines, because they contain aluminum or mercury, it produces abnormal development of the brain and produces long-term
[02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:53.115]  There are changes in the brain that makes that child at high risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's for the rest of their life.
[02:28:53.115 --> 02:29:01.100]  They become hypersensitive to environmental toxins like pesticides and herbicides for the rest of their life.
[02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:04.322]  This has been shown repeatedly in the laboratory.
[02:29:04.322 --> 02:29:11.686]  Yet, here we have a government policy because of payoffs from big pharmaceutical companies.
[02:29:12.909 --> 02:29:14.110]  I don't think so.
[02:29:28.366 --> 02:29:30.827]  And these are the type of things that concern me.
[02:29:30.827 --> 02:29:33.727]  The other thing that concerns me about... Dr. Blaylock, gotta break.
[02:29:33.727 --> 02:29:34.688]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:34.688 --> 02:29:37.709]  It won't interrupt you for 18 minutes when we return.
[02:29:37.709 --> 02:29:40.289]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest.
[02:29:40.289 --> 02:29:43.310]  The website is russellblaylockmd.com.
[02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:46.191]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[02:29:46.191 --> 02:29:48.571]  We're gonna get into other toxins in the environment.
[02:29:48.571 --> 02:29:49.632]  Why are they doing it?
[02:29:49.632 --> 02:29:51.412]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.412 --> 02:29:52.813]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.813 --> 02:29:54.313]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.322 --> 02:30:00.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.846 --> 02:30:03.227]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:30:03.227 --> 02:30:05.449]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:30:05.449 --> 02:30:08.751]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:30:08.751 --> 02:30:13.854]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:30:13.854 --> 02:30:18.057]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:30:18.357 --> 02:30:20.818]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:30:20.818 --> 02:30:23.260]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:26.522]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:30:26.522 --> 02:30:34.106]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:30:34.446 --> 02:30:39.849]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:30:39.849 --> 02:30:42.691]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:30:42.691 --> 02:30:46.373]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:30:46.373 --> 02:30:47.454]  And I got news for you.
[02:30:47.454 --> 02:30:48.794]  You're everyone else.
[02:30:48.794 --> 02:30:50.295]  Invisible Empire.

[02:32:06.045 --> 02:32:08.806]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:32:08.806 --> 02:32:13.308]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:32:14.144 --> 02:32:18.608]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[02:33:04.077 --> 02:33:20.889]  By the way, folks, I named a radio talk show host in Austin who took the seasonal, got Guillain-Barré for months, was getting numb all over.
[02:33:20.889 --> 02:33:22.210]  Thank God most of it's gone away.
[02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:23.871]  His toes are still numb.
[02:33:23.871 --> 02:33:26.473]  And the medical doctors in Austin told him it was the vaccine.
[02:33:27.333 --> 02:33:38.924]  Now, this is in the inserts, and they put out these fake fact sheets at the pharmacies and at the colleges and government buildings saying, there's no mercury, can't cause neurological disorders.
[02:33:38.924 --> 02:33:44.188]  But then you get the actual insert, which we have up on screen, and we're going to be going over that with Dr. Blaylock.
[02:33:44.188 --> 02:33:51.094]  Now, that's what's so frustrating about this, because there were big mainstream articles I read attacking Dr. Blaylock and others, when he was simply trying to save lives.
[02:33:51.835 --> 02:33:56.983]  I mean, you know, I mean, he's a multi-degree, you know, top doctor, somebody who's researched all this.
[02:33:56.983 --> 02:33:59.386]  He's got all the peer-reviewed mainline studies.
[02:33:59.386 --> 02:34:01.409]  As he said, this is not secret.
[02:34:01.409 --> 02:34:03.853]  They know what they're doing, and I'll ask him why.
[02:34:03.853 --> 02:34:05.636]  We're going back to him here in just a moment.
[02:34:07.978 --> 02:34:12.523]  Before we do that, I want to encourage listeners to support this radio broadcast.
[02:34:12.523 --> 02:34:15.386]  That means supporting our local sponsors on AM and FM.
[02:34:15.386 --> 02:34:20.492]  That means spreading the word about, say, the free iPhone app, giving us five-star rating.
[02:34:20.492 --> 02:34:21.893]  Be sure and rate it when you get it.
[02:34:21.893 --> 02:34:23.675]  Listen to the show whenever you want, however you want.
[02:34:23.675 --> 02:34:27.839]  If you have friends and family that have iPhones or iPads, send them the link.
[02:34:27.839 --> 02:34:28.760]  It works on the iPad.
[02:34:30.322 --> 02:34:30.683]  I don't
[02:34:52.904 --> 02:34:53.884]  Both got behind.
[02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:58.105]  We spent a year and a half on Invisible Empire, a year on Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:34:58.105 --> 02:35:01.066]  They exposed this entire agenda, why they're doing it.
[02:35:01.066 --> 02:35:03.587]  It wakes people up so they understand.
[02:35:03.587 --> 02:35:08.028]  And your purchase of the high-quality DVDs also supports this radio broadcast.
[02:35:08.028 --> 02:35:16.051]  So please get Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, now shipping, now available, and Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, now shipping, now available, getting rave reviews.
[02:35:16.051 --> 02:35:18.831]  I want to thank folks out there for their support with the film.
[02:35:18.831 --> 02:35:20.332]  Or you can download all my films
[02:35:21.132 --> 02:35:26.675]  The live TV show, the radio show, podcast in higher quality by becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[02:35:26.675 --> 02:35:28.956]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:35:28.956 --> 02:35:30.616]  Again, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:35:30.616 --> 02:35:36.819]  You can also call toll-free to get the books and videos and materials that we have on the website, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:35:36.819 --> 02:35:40.081]  And we've also added four new books to the catalog yesterday.
[02:35:48.204 --> 02:35:58.811]  Uh, The Secret Team by Fletcher Prouty, Jesse Ventura's Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, and several other books, and for a limited time, because when Terror Storm runs out, the price will go back up and I've got to reprint.
[02:35:58.811 --> 02:36:05.896]  The premiere film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, is free with the books right now.
[02:36:05.896 --> 02:36:06.617]  Free.
[02:36:06.617 --> 02:36:08.578]  One of my top films, free.
[02:36:08.578 --> 02:36:13.341]  That's how important it is this film get out to everybody, so that new special is up there on the website.
[02:36:13.341 --> 02:36:15.703]  We couldn't do this without your financial support, so I want to thank you.
[02:36:16.643 --> 02:36:19.785]  Speaking of support, be sure and support Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[02:36:19.785 --> 02:36:26.790]  He has several websites, but what's the best website, doctor, for people to visit?
[02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:31.233]  Go to www.blaylockwellnesscenter.com.
[02:36:36.138 --> 02:36:38.520]  That's BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:43.865]  Okay, so I was ranting there about the fact that they know.
[02:36:43.865 --> 02:36:57.557]  I mean, on the insert that really came with the H1N1 and the seasonal, it says, can cause neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre, can reduce fertility, can cause cancer, and we've shown that over and over again, and I believe, and I want you to talk about this,
[02:36:58.317 --> 02:37:08.406]  That not only do we have a record low flu season worldwide, both seasonal and H1N1, but the Wall Street Journal had to admit a month ago, and we covered this several times here on air if anybody wants to pull it up,
[02:37:09.622 --> 02:37:29.969]  That it was record low for people taking vaccines and now Canadian studies show, they have four different studies, I'm sure you've seen them, but it's in mainstream news, even MSNBC, that people that had taken the seasonal flu shot were upwards of four times more likely to contract and actually have a problem with the H1N1.
[02:37:29.969 --> 02:37:33.090]  So can you speak to that and what's in these vaccines?
[02:37:34.056 --> 02:37:41.318]  Yeah, that Canadian study came out right in the middle of all of this when they were still screaming that you need to get the vaccine.
[02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:49.221]  The Canadian study showed that if you took the vaccine, it at least doubled your risk of contracting H1N1.
[02:37:49.221 --> 02:37:53.542]  An Indian study out of India found the same thing.
[02:37:53.542 --> 02:37:56.523]  Yet it had no impact on the U.S.
[02:37:56.523 --> 02:37:57.043]  policy.
[02:37:57.043 --> 02:37:59.404]  It did the Canadian policy.
[02:37:59.404 --> 02:38:03.905]  A lot of my material was going to a friend of mine in the Czech Republic.
[02:38:04.591 --> 02:38:10.554]  And she was translating into Czech, and they were going throughout the media.
[02:38:10.554 --> 02:38:20.298]  Well, interestingly, the Secretary of Health for the Czech Republic was encouraging everyone to get the vaccine, and she took it.
[02:38:20.298 --> 02:38:25.900]  The President of the Czech Republic said he wouldn't take it, he was scared of the vaccine.
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:28.822]  Well, guess who got the infection?
[02:38:28.822 --> 02:38:30.843]  The Secretary of Health, rather than get H1N1.
[02:38:32.421 --> 02:38:36.763]  They had 1 million doses of the vaccine ordered for the Czech Republic.
[02:38:36.763 --> 02:38:39.805]  They have 800,000 doses that are sitting.
[02:38:39.805 --> 02:38:41.446]  No one will take it.
[02:38:41.446 --> 02:38:47.529]  So, the vast majority of people listened to the advice and didn't take the vaccine.
[02:38:47.529 --> 02:38:50.751]  Now, the thing is, people need to understand about vaccines.
[02:38:50.751 --> 02:38:54.693]  And this is not just the H1N1, but all vaccines.
[02:38:54.693 --> 02:38:59.576]  The big secret in the vaccine manufacturing is that they're all contaminated.
[02:38:59.576 --> 02:39:01.777]  And they admit they don't know how to get
[02:39:02.290 --> 02:39:07.111]  Contaminating viruses and microplasma out of these vaccines.
[02:39:07.111 --> 02:39:09.512]  It's impossible.
[02:39:09.512 --> 02:39:12.313]  Their top experts have admitted that.
[02:39:12.313 --> 02:39:18.274]  The other thing is almost all the vaccines are now manufactured in China.
[02:39:18.274 --> 02:39:26.356]  The United States FDA is not allowed to enter any plant that manufactures vaccines in China.
[02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:29.277]  They're allowed to come once every 12 years.
[02:39:30.197 --> 02:39:38.759]  And they can look at the record that the Chinese Communist officials give them, and that's how they make the determination that it's safe.
[02:39:39.147 --> 02:39:40.107]  Let's say that again.
[02:39:40.107 --> 02:39:59.891]  The Communist Chinese, who have a eugenics policy, one-child policy, that meshes with the people that run our government, they're making, in some numbers I've seen, upwards of 90% of the vaccines that we take in Europe and the United States, but more so in the U.S., are being made by China.
[02:39:59.891 --> 02:40:02.012]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:40:02.412 --> 02:40:11.656]  Well, these are the Chinese that contaminated a cough syrup that's estimated to have killed at least 10,000 people worldwide.
[02:40:11.656 --> 02:40:15.878]  They contaminated baby food.
[02:40:15.878 --> 02:40:22.141]  You know, they've been involved in numerous scandals of contaminating products all over the world.
[02:40:22.141 --> 02:40:29.024]  And yet we turn over something like vaccinations to the Chinese government, and we're not even allowed to look inside their factories.
[02:40:30.189 --> 02:40:35.790]  We just take these millions of doses of vaccine that come from these Chinese plants.
[02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:40.592]  They're not even examined once they're manufactured by the FDA.
[02:40:40.592 --> 02:40:44.613]  But even in the best of cases, you cannot sterilize them.
[02:40:44.613 --> 02:40:49.874]  Now, the viruses that are in there, they admit there may be dozens of viruses that cause cancer.
[02:40:50.441 --> 02:41:10.017]  Well, just two weeks ago, doctor, it was in the news that millions of vaccines have this pig cancer virus in it, and I've read the government reports declassified in the 70s that over 100 million Americans were given the polio vaccine that had a, what is it, SV40, which gives people cancer.
[02:41:10.017 --> 02:41:18.363]  Yeah, and they've proven that the really scary thing of this SV40, the polio vaccine, is that it's vertically transmitted.
[02:41:18.363 --> 02:41:19.084]  Communicable.
[02:41:19.591 --> 02:41:19.731]  Yeah.
[02:41:47.788 --> 02:41:50.178]  Showing that it's still being transmitted.
[02:41:56.014 --> 02:42:18.966]  Well, more than that, I saw an Indian study, and correct me if I'm wrong, this was years ago, that was in the major Indian papers, that 100% of their municipal sewer systems were filled with SV40 from the vaccines, and not only is it intergenerational, passed on from parent to parent, from parents to children, their offspring, but that it is transmittable from person to person.
[02:42:20.188 --> 02:42:26.190]  Yeah, and this is a big worry because this is a major carcinogenic virus.
[02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:35.873]  You know, and the government scientists have just gone bent over backwards to try to make the case that this is not a dangerous virus.
[02:42:35.873 --> 02:42:44.776]  Forever, they denied it was even a carcinogenic virus until it was absolutely proven in an NIH lab.
[02:42:44.776 --> 02:42:49.738]  Since then, they said, well, we'll do epidemiologic studies in the United States
[02:42:50.262 --> 02:42:54.604]  And see if there's any increased cancer since we've given the polio vaccine.
[02:42:54.604 --> 02:42:58.726]  And so they came out with a big denial, well, we didn't see any increased cancer, right?
[02:42:58.726 --> 02:43:05.589]  Well, the people that know about epidemiology studies said, well, the study was fixed, so it wouldn't show it.
[02:43:05.589 --> 02:43:16.734]  And so, you know, now that they've actually typed the virus from the tumors themselves, there's no denying it's not a contaminant, it is decausation.
[02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:17.731]  I think?
[02:43:36.309 --> 02:43:52.632]  Newspapers and then we see, I mean I've talked to other medical doctors, I want to ask you if this is true, but that 30, 40, 50 years ago when they were in residency finishing up their medical degree that they would take them into the ward and show them a 10 year old with cancer and it was like finding a four leaf clover.
[02:43:52.932 --> 02:43:54.573]  Well, it is true about the incidence of these cancers.
[02:44:20.943 --> 02:44:34.367]  And all of us older guys talk about that, how these cancers we're seeing now were so rare, you were lucky to see one or two cases in medical school and in your residency training.
[02:44:34.367 --> 02:44:37.628]  Now, we're just seeing them everywhere.
[02:44:37.628 --> 02:44:41.410]  Things like pancreatic cancer used to be extremely rare.
[02:44:41.410 --> 02:44:45.351]  Lymphoma was nowhere near the incidence that it is now.
[02:44:45.351 --> 02:44:47.752]  Now it is the number one malignancy in 30-year-olds.
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:52.302]  Uh, and rising all the time.
[02:44:52.302 --> 02:44:56.665]  Uh, so we're seeing a great number of diseases, and even things like asthma.
[02:44:56.665 --> 02:45:06.532]  Asthma has increased, uh, over tenfold in the last couple of decades, and it's estimated that it's the vaccine program that's producing it.
[02:45:06.532 --> 02:45:10.034]  Why is it causing a heightened over-autoimmune response?
[02:45:10.034 --> 02:45:15.878]  Yeah, it's an auto, uh, autoimmune response from the, uh, component in the vaccine.
[02:45:16.579 --> 02:45:21.101]  And we also know that type 1 diabetes, juvenile diabetes, is related to vaccines.
[02:45:21.101 --> 02:45:26.443]  There's a new study that just came out and made a very strong case for it.
[02:45:26.443 --> 02:45:41.029]  Yet their attitude is, well, it's more important that we vaccinate everybody than we worry about a couple of hundred thousand kids who are crippled every year and thousands who will die from complications of these vaccines.
[02:45:41.029 --> 02:45:46.271]  And you're talking about contaminating the whole population with these viruses that are contaminated.
[02:45:46.881 --> 02:45:50.322]  Let me stop you again because there's so many points I want to cover with you.
[02:45:50.322 --> 02:45:51.042]  This is incredible.
[02:45:51.042 --> 02:45:52.583]  I'll have to do a part two.
[02:45:52.583 --> 02:45:54.303]  You're so gracious to spend this time with us.
[02:46:03.646 --> 02:46:17.631]  Going back, and I just had the article up on screen, mainstream news reported, and this was going on in April and May and June of last year, that last year's seasonal flu and this year's seasonal flu
[02:46:18.996 --> 02:46:37.617]  Some of the major companies were putting an H1N1 simulant and then I had medical doctors on that explained that viral simulant was really an attenuated virus and so now that's why they're saying you take the seasonal flu then you get H1N1 which is what four different studies out of Canada and you mentioned one out of India have shown.
[02:46:39.713 --> 02:46:48.797]  So please speak to that, but then overall, second question, is it the good news that we're having record numbers of people refuse vaccines because people are finally getting wise to this?
[02:46:48.797 --> 02:46:50.337]  Go ahead.
[02:46:50.337 --> 02:46:59.441]  Well, you know, it's true that they're manipulating these vaccines all the time, and they're not telling the public what they're doing.
[02:46:59.441 --> 02:47:08.324]  You know, they're putting viruses in, they're putting antibiotics in these vaccines, and no one's telling the public what they added to these vaccines.
[02:47:10.371 --> 02:47:22.058]  Now, your second observation, what's happening is, secretly, since we've had this disaster with H1N1, we should have been the learning lesson.
[02:47:22.058 --> 02:47:34.246]  Right at that time, Merck Pharmaceutical was secretly going to the state legislature to get them to overturn exemption law so that you couldn't refuse the vaccine.
[02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:42.506]  Because they were so upset that so many people have refused the vaccine in this season.
[02:47:42.506 --> 02:47:47.730]  And right here in my own state, I know of this action taking place.
[02:47:47.730 --> 02:48:01.100]  And in your state, you know, Governor Perry was getting the Gardasil of the mandatory vaccine because he was getting money from Merck Pharmaceuticals.
[02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:03.242]  So our state politicians
[02:48:04.153 --> 02:48:12.698]  Uh, are people we need to keep an eye on because they're going to override exemptions to these vaccines and force people to do it.
[02:48:12.698 --> 02:48:23.123]  Uh, the other thing, this new healthcare bill that was passed, if anybody bothers to read it, inside it said all vaccines recommended by the CDC will be made available.
[02:48:23.123 --> 02:48:25.304]  Well, that doesn't just mean made available.
[02:48:25.304 --> 02:48:26.345]  It means you will take them.
[02:48:27.290 --> 02:48:29.632]  Or you cannot get healthcare in the United States.
[02:48:47.423 --> 02:48:50.165]  Well, it's a worthless vaccine and there's a new study out that shows that
[02:49:14.082 --> 02:49:21.123]  Just, uh, increasing certain nutrients in your diet reduces cervical cancer by 85 percent.
[02:49:21.123 --> 02:49:23.844]  Well, that vaccine is nowhere near that effective.
[02:49:23.844 --> 02:49:32.645]  So if you truly wanted to prevent cervical cancer, uh, in young girls, all you need to do is give them a couple of nutrient supplements.
[02:49:32.645 --> 02:49:36.206]  Uh, but of course, they would never do that because there's no big profit for the vaccine.
[02:49:36.206 --> 02:49:38.606]  Or not let them have sex with people.
[02:49:38.606 --> 02:49:42.747]  Sure, I mean, you could, uh, do something really drastic and that'd re-establish
[02:49:44.246 --> 02:49:51.991]  A moral principle in which you're not having sex with everybody you meet in the shopping mall.
[02:49:51.991 --> 02:50:06.140]  But, you know, that's so drastic according to the collectivist's left-wing viewpoint, we can't dare turn back the clock because that would just violate the laws of the universe, according to their way of thinking.
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:10.523]  But, you know, we've got to re-establish the foundation of morality.
[02:50:11.127 --> 02:50:27.654]  We've got to reestablish these things and just tell the far left and the extreme social engineers we're no longer going to listen to their nonsense because everything they've engineered in the last 70 years is about disaster.
[02:50:27.654 --> 02:50:30.695]  I mean, the whole sex education thing was their idea.
[02:50:30.695 --> 02:50:33.977]  It was going to stop teenage pregnancies.
[02:50:33.977 --> 02:50:36.298]  It was going to stop the spread of venereal disease.
[02:50:39.279 --> 02:50:45.321]  Well, they're brilliant eugenics plan.
[02:50:45.321 --> 02:50:45.841]  Absolutely.
[02:50:45.841 --> 02:50:46.661]  We got to break again.

[02:52:03.261 --> 02:52:05.583]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.583 --> 02:52:08.786]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.786 --> 02:52:13.890]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.890 --> 02:52:18.094]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.394 --> 02:52:20.857]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.857 --> 02:52:23.641]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.641 --> 02:52:26.545]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.545 --> 02:52:34.155]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.475 --> 02:52:39.758]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.758 --> 02:52:42.720]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:46.402]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.402 --> 02:52:47.483]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.483 --> 02:52:48.824]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:09.066 --> 02:54:12.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll put it up on screen for folks.
[02:54:12.750 --> 02:54:15.513]  BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[02:54:15.513 --> 02:54:19.257]  Dr. Blaylock with us five minutes to the next hour and a bunch of other important news coming up.
[02:54:19.257 --> 02:54:22.200]  But look, I didn't just read stuff on the internet.
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:24.582]  I sent off to universities, to the UN.
[02:54:24.582 --> 02:54:27.125]  I got the actual biological diversity assessments.
[02:54:28.854 --> 02:54:38.284]  We have over a hundred books written by top scientists, the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, the head of the UN, all of them.
[02:54:38.284 --> 02:54:44.071]  All they talk about is putting things in your food, water, and your vaccines to sterilize you and dumb you down.
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.043]  I know that sounds horrible and hard to believe, but I mean, here's the Times of London.
[02:54:50.043 --> 02:54:51.444]  It was also on ABC News.
[02:54:51.444 --> 02:54:54.527]  Billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[02:54:54.527 --> 02:54:58.190]  And it says, America's richest people met in secret at Rockefeller University.
[02:54:58.190 --> 02:55:02.154]  And at the end it says, for a world government to carry out population reduction.
[02:55:03.109 --> 02:55:07.453]  And I've got CNN here yesterday calling for a one-child policy.
[02:55:07.453 --> 02:55:15.341]  Listen, there's a reason China is at the heart of this New World Order, and they're making your shots, and it makes you have miscarriages and get cancer.
[02:55:15.341 --> 02:55:16.823]  I mean, this is a fact.
[02:55:16.823 --> 02:55:18.645]  Dr. Blaylock getting down to that point.
[02:55:19.045 --> 02:55:22.866]  I mean, you're a medical doctor, brain surgeon, scientist, but we've talked before.
[02:55:22.866 --> 02:55:27.467]  You've been criticized by the media for your courage, but you're just reading... I mean, you've read the same documents I've read.
[02:55:27.467 --> 02:55:34.169]  I mean, am I joking around when I say the elite are saying they want to do this to us, and then 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[02:55:34.169 --> 02:55:36.049]  It's happening?
[02:55:36.049 --> 02:55:41.411]  Well, there's been a great number of books written about population control.
[02:55:41.411 --> 02:55:47.172]  Which, if you're really interested, if you have any questions about this, you can get on government.
[02:55:48.031 --> 02:55:49.873]  Uh, uh, websites.
[02:55:49.873 --> 02:55:51.574]  You can get on foundations.
[02:55:51.574 --> 02:56:01.562]  There's a number of powerful foundations that are supplying billions of dollars for this purpose, world population control.
[02:56:01.562 --> 02:56:05.865]  And if you read the literature, I mean, these are some of the most powerful people in the world.
[02:56:05.865 --> 02:56:16.634]  If you read their literature, they openly talk about how we've got to drastically reduce the population of the world and how everybody that survives this population control
[02:56:17.373 --> 02:56:17.853]  I don't know.
[02:56:38.209 --> 02:56:44.493]  And the doctor's lounge will tell you, well I think that the population needs to be drastically reduced.
[02:56:59.192 --> 02:57:01.093]  These physicians aren't elitist either.
[02:57:01.093 --> 02:57:02.453]  Their kids are taking this stuff.
[02:57:02.453 --> 02:57:07.276]  See, the average yuppie doctor, and I want to get your comment on this, they think they're immune for this.
[02:57:07.276 --> 02:57:11.517]  You know, it's fine to, yeah, we're spiking those black people shots in Africa.
[02:57:11.517 --> 02:57:17.260]  What these immoral people, control freaks on power trips don't get is this is being done to everybody, isn't it?
[02:57:17.260 --> 02:57:18.580]  Well, you're exactly right.
[02:57:18.580 --> 02:57:25.443]  And it's the delusion that somehow they're going to be in the group that's going to be spared.
[02:57:25.443 --> 02:57:28.885]  And when you look at the history of this collectivist movement,
[02:57:30.178 --> 02:57:35.121]  Those are the people that are going to be included in the ones to be removed.
[02:57:35.121 --> 02:57:45.269]  You know, I spoke on your program one time about Dr. Lilly, who wrote the Molecular Visions of Life, which was the history of molecular biology in America.
[02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:51.794]  Well, she is a very highly regarded historian of molecular science, and that's what the book's about.
[02:57:51.794 --> 02:57:56.197]  But she goes in great detail, showing how the Rockefeller family
[02:57:57.001 --> 02:58:08.583]  Uh, had engineered with all of their friends, these multi-millionaires, particularly through the foundation, a program to cause drastic reductions in human population.
[02:58:08.583 --> 02:58:10.863]  He was absolutely obsessed with it.
[02:58:10.863 --> 02:58:14.724]  Now, this is one of the wealthiest men in the entire world.
[02:58:14.724 --> 02:58:20.545]  Uh, owns tens of thousands of corporations, either directly or indirectly.
[02:58:20.545 --> 02:58:25.426]  Uh, one of the major forces that created the Council on Foreign Relations Trilateral Commission.
[02:58:26.058 --> 02:58:28.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:29.841]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.581 --> 02:58:54.602]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.602 --> 02:58:59.924]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.924 --> 02:59:01.965]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.965 --> 02:59:06.966]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.966 --> 02:59:08.147]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.147 --> 02:59:08.887]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.267 --> 02:59:11.147]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.147 --> 02:59:12.228]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.228 --> 02:59:14.428]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.428 --> 02:59:15.769]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.769 --> 02:59:17.309]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.309 --> 02:59:22.570]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.570 --> 02:59:26.151]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.151 --> 02:59:29.612]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.972 --> 02:59:31.192]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.192 --> 02:59:32.093]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.093 --> 02:59:33.213]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.213 --> 02:59:34.133]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.133 --> 02:59:35.213]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.213 --> 02:59:38.274]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.274 --> 02:59:38.794]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.794 --> 02:59:40.474]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.474 --> 02:59:41.495]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.495 --> 02:59:42.695]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.695 --> 02:59:44.515]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:04.878 --> 03:00:07.580]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest for another five minutes.
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:09.801]  We've got a news blitz coming up with another guest in studio.
[03:00:09.801 --> 03:00:20.368]  He was finishing up with the government documents and reports he's read about how they want to use medical tyranny to carry out population reduction through the vaccines, through the food, through the water.
[03:00:20.368 --> 03:00:22.189]  We're going to have him back up in the near future.
[03:00:22.189 --> 03:00:24.890]  I was showing you the Times of London where they're talking about this.
[03:00:24.890 --> 03:00:26.852]  My film Endgame covers it.
[03:00:26.852 --> 03:00:28.092]  And now with government health care,
[03:00:29.113 --> 03:00:34.577]  Ron Paul has said this is a medical tyranny, and he's a medical doctor.
[03:00:34.577 --> 03:00:35.838]  OBGYN.
[03:00:35.838 --> 03:00:37.720]  We've got about four minutes left.
[03:00:37.720 --> 03:00:39.942]  Dr. Blaylock, you've got the floor.
[03:00:39.942 --> 03:00:45.726]  Well, you know, what people need to understand, look at what happened during this fiasco with the vaccine.
[03:00:45.726 --> 03:00:48.368]  Now there were lives packed on top of lives.
[03:00:48.368 --> 03:00:57.235]  All these people are damaged and ruined and dead from this operation by the government, and they want to take over the entire healthcare system?
[03:00:57.765 --> 03:01:03.466]  They're going to run everything that happens to you medically and you trust them.
[03:01:03.466 --> 03:01:06.447]  We couldn't trust them with one event.
[03:01:06.447 --> 03:01:15.369]  So how are we going to trust them with taking care of millions of health care events that take place every day?
[03:01:15.369 --> 03:01:16.330]  I mean, it's ludicrous.
[03:01:16.330 --> 03:01:17.690]  It's terrifying.
[03:01:17.690 --> 03:01:23.111]  And I think, as I told Alex, I think that we're in the endgame here.
[03:01:23.111 --> 03:01:25.952]  These people think they're so close to winning.
[03:01:26.499 --> 03:01:29.401]  They're no longer hiding their agenda.
[03:01:29.401 --> 03:01:39.587]  When I was looking at this stuff 40 years ago, most of this you couldn't find anywhere unless you really did some digging.
[03:01:39.587 --> 03:01:41.908]  Now, they're openly talking about it.
[03:01:41.908 --> 03:01:48.372]  You have presidents of countries that are openly calling for new constitutions, world constitutions.
[03:01:48.372 --> 03:01:52.895]  You have people talking about dissolving the sovereignty of countries, openly.
[03:01:53.599 --> 03:01:57.941]  They're no longer hiding this because they think they're so close to winning.
[03:01:57.941 --> 03:02:00.602]  They don't have to hide it any longer.
[03:02:00.602 --> 03:02:08.846]  You can find population reduction documents very easily off the internet, in which they're openly talking about how we want to do this.
[03:02:08.846 --> 03:02:15.309]  You look at people like Rahm Emanuel's brother, who's a physician, and the Hastings Institute.
[03:02:15.309 --> 03:02:18.391]  They openly talk about killing off the old people.
[03:02:20.041 --> 03:02:24.803]  You know, terms that say, well, we've got to evaluate whether your life is worth living.
[03:02:24.803 --> 03:02:27.943]  We no longer can just provide you with unlimited health care.
[03:02:27.943 --> 03:02:42.308]  And under Comparative Care, Tom Daschle and all of them say that's the plan, and they sold raising taxes, cutting benefits, and having the government tell physicians what to do, and it's so nightmarish, the average person just can't believe it.
[03:02:42.308 --> 03:02:45.989]  And according to this bill, the physician will have no power whatsoever.
[03:02:46.536 --> 03:02:50.337]  He will be told everything he will or will not do.
[03:02:50.337 --> 03:02:54.258]  And if he doesn't do it, he'll lose his license or he'll go to jail.
[03:02:54.258 --> 03:02:56.899]  That's specifically outlined.
[03:02:56.899 --> 03:03:00.679]  And if people think that's not going to happen, they're deluding themselves.
[03:03:00.679 --> 03:03:04.260]  I've been warning physicians for over 30 years.
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:06.981]  They've refused to listen all along.
[03:03:06.981 --> 03:03:09.382]  And here we are at the very endgame.
[03:03:09.382 --> 03:03:11.382]  Everything I said was going to happen, happens.
[03:03:12.112 --> 03:03:17.576]  Uh, but they were so hard-headed, so convinced that they could control it and stop it.
[03:03:17.576 --> 03:03:23.900]  Uh, and now that what I hear from my physician friends, they want to quit, retire, and get out of medicine.
[03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:26.181]  Uh, they're sick of it.
[03:03:26.181 --> 03:03:37.289]  And now medicine will be carried out by government-trained kind of technicians, and they're openly saying somebody over 60 won't get a knee surgery, you'll get a shot of cortisone.
[03:03:37.289 --> 03:03:38.950]  Or they'll give them a cane.
[03:03:40.233 --> 03:03:47.378]  People who have cataracts will just be given a stick with a red tip on it, and that's going to be your treatment.
[03:03:47.378 --> 03:03:51.441]  Now, if you think that's not true, you're deluding yourself.
[03:03:51.441 --> 03:03:55.023]  We see this in socialist countries all over the world.
[03:03:55.023 --> 03:03:58.525]  The idea is that you're not worth the expenditure.
[03:03:58.525 --> 03:04:01.367]  Everything's based on public expenditure.
[03:04:01.367 --> 03:04:05.290]  I've got you in video where they say that.
[03:04:05.290 --> 03:04:07.311]  That's the socialist collectivist system.
[03:04:07.776 --> 03:04:10.998]  Well, you get on the Hastings Institute website, they'll tell you that.
[03:04:10.998 --> 03:04:18.001]  There's numerous papers written by Rahm Emanuel's brother in which he openly calls for that.
[03:04:18.001 --> 03:04:29.746]  So now we have a government in power who you can find their words directly on these websites and these foundations calling for that very thing.
[03:04:29.746 --> 03:04:32.528]  And, you know, people need to wake up.
[03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:34.949]  There's not a lot of time left to stop this.
[03:04:35.478 --> 03:04:37.179]  BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[03:04:37.179 --> 03:04:41.442]  Doctor, will you join us again in a month for a part two to discuss, go through the bill itself?
[03:04:41.442 --> 03:04:43.323]  I'd be glad to.
[03:04:43.323 --> 03:04:44.324]  That's now law.
[03:04:44.324 --> 03:04:46.686]  God bless you, sir, and God bless you for your courage.
[03:04:46.686 --> 03:04:49.447]  It's always buoying to talk to you.
[03:04:49.447 --> 03:04:50.648]  We're going to beat this thing together.
[03:04:50.648 --> 03:04:51.209]  Take care.
[03:04:51.209 --> 03:04:51.829]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:51.829 --> 03:04:52.750]  God bless you.
[03:04:52.750 --> 03:04:53.970]  Have a great weekend.
[03:04:53.970 --> 03:04:57.953]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the one-child policy here in the U.S.
[03:04:57.953 --> 03:04:58.834]  being promoted by CNN.
[03:05:02.213 --> 03:05:10.697]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[03:05:10.697 --> 03:05:21.583]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[03:05:21.583 --> 03:05:27.006]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[03:05:27.566 --> 03:05:32.469]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:41.535]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[03:05:41.535 --> 03:05:51.642]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[03:05:51.642 --> 03:05:56.325]  That's www.SilverLungs.com SilverLungs.com
[03:06:00.970 --> 03:06:02.270]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.270 --> 03:06:07.852]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:06:07.852 --> 03:06:12.874]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:06:12.874 --> 03:06:17.916]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:06:18.436 --> 03:06:23.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:25.981]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:06:25.981 --> 03:06:30.784]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:06:30.784 --> 03:06:31.905]  And here's the best part.
[03:06:31.905 --> 03:06:34.687]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:06:34.687 --> 03:06:38.610]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:06:38.610 --> 03:06:41.792]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:06:41.792 --> 03:06:44.013]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:06:44.013 --> 03:06:44.934]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:06:48.576 --> 03:06:51.537]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:06:51.537 --> 03:06:57.639]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:06:57.639 --> 03:07:01.081]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:01.081 --> 03:07:07.723]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:07:07.723 --> 03:07:12.865]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:07:12.865 --> 03:07:14.346]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[03:07:16.926 --> 03:07:27.814]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[03:07:30.083 --> 03:07:34.664]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:07:34.664 --> 03:07:38.505]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[03:07:38.505 --> 03:07:39.745]  Others don't.
[03:07:39.745 --> 03:07:41.886]  We turn jeans inside out.
[03:07:41.886 --> 03:07:43.666]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[03:07:43.666 --> 03:07:46.567]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:07:46.567 --> 03:07:53.188]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[03:07:53.188 --> 03:07:55.889]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[03:07:55.889 --> 03:07:58.250]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.750]  Others don't.
[03:08:01.939 --> 03:08:04.709]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.709 --> 03:08:07.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.763 --> 03:08:16.648]  Under the New World Order, you are a human resource to be used up and then exterminated.
[03:08:16.648 --> 03:08:31.520]  You just heard Dr. Russell Blaylock, top brain surgeon, giving you chapter and verse of government and foundation documents where they said they want to poison your food and water and your vaccines to sterilize you and your family, that more than 90% of the vaccines in the U.S.
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:35.863]  are made in China, that they are killing people en masse, and they know this.
[03:08:36.644 --> 03:08:38.105]  They know this.
[03:08:38.105 --> 03:08:42.526]  I mean, there are people all over my neighborhood, people my dad works with, talk show hosts.
[03:08:42.526 --> 03:08:44.487]  I know in Austin, two different ones.
[03:08:44.487 --> 03:08:50.489]  One person's a news person, the other is a number one talk show host in the morning.
[03:08:50.489 --> 03:08:53.571]  Dale Dudley went and got the shot, and the doctors told him, no, you got Guillain-Barré.
[03:08:54.491 --> 03:08:58.093]  But thankfully, it was a mild case from the vaccine.
[03:08:58.093 --> 03:09:02.876]  And then, you sit here and you try to tell the public this, and the mainstream media ridicules you.
[03:09:02.876 --> 03:09:09.079]  There was a big newspaper article last year attacking Blaylock and myself, saying we're a bunch of nuts.
[03:09:09.079 --> 03:09:09.880]  Am I a nut?
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:13.562]  I've got Population, Resources, and Environment.
[03:09:13.562 --> 03:09:16.644]  This thing is written by the White House Science Czar.
[03:09:16.644 --> 03:09:23.548]  It is 1,050-plus pages long, and I've read most of this, and so has Aaron Dykes.
[03:09:24.946 --> 03:09:29.107]  Let me tell you something, Aaron Dykes graduated from UT five years ago and came to work for us.
[03:09:29.107 --> 03:09:34.649]  And I don't hire people that are true believers or just believe what I'm saying.
[03:09:34.649 --> 03:09:37.010]  I randomly hire folks, you know, out of ads.
[03:09:37.010 --> 03:09:38.930]  They don't know where they're coming to be interviewed.
[03:09:38.930 --> 03:09:44.112]  And I hire people, almost every person that's hired here doesn't believe it when they take the job and they're laughing at me.
[03:09:44.112 --> 03:09:46.553]  But let me tell you something, they're not laughing later.
[03:09:47.473 --> 03:09:48.913]  It's not a joke later.
[03:09:48.913 --> 03:09:57.335]  See, I know I can hire anybody, if they're not a government agent, and I can bring them in here and they're going to see everything I see, and they're going to know the truth.
[03:09:57.335 --> 03:10:03.937]  This is the White House science czar saying, poison your water and your medicine to sterilize your butt.
[03:10:03.937 --> 03:10:07.038]  Ecoscience, population, resources, and environment.
[03:10:07.038 --> 03:10:10.378]  Government policy book.
[03:10:10.378 --> 03:10:13.039]  By the way, that's been in the Associated Press when that broke a year ago.
[03:10:16.411 --> 03:10:17.832]  I mean, look at this one.
[03:10:17.832 --> 03:10:19.173]  This is out of CBS News.
[03:10:19.173 --> 03:10:21.894]  Mutant poliovirus spreads in Nigeria.
[03:10:21.894 --> 03:10:27.737]  Children affected this year by paralyzing disease believed to be caused by the same vaccine that used to fight it.
[03:10:27.737 --> 03:10:32.300]  Then the AP reported this is going on all over the world.
[03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:34.401]  It's got live cancer viruses in it.
[03:10:34.401 --> 03:10:36.342]  You heard Dr. Blaylock talk about it.
[03:10:36.342 --> 03:10:39.864]  And it's passed on genetically when you have children.
[03:10:39.864 --> 03:10:41.025]  And you wonder, I mean, folks,
[03:10:42.932 --> 03:10:47.416]  Cancer in people under 30, 50 years ago, was unheard of.
[03:10:47.416 --> 03:10:49.679]  Little kids never got it.
[03:10:49.679 --> 03:11:03.312]  I've had so many retired and older, about to retire, medical doctors, surgeons, brain surgeons, cancer doctors on this show, that when they were in residency or they were in medical school, it was unheard of.
[03:11:03.312 --> 03:11:06.154]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:11:07.153 --> 03:11:13.875]  I don't know, there's 16 people in this office, I've got another 4 or 5 employees, a couple of them are contractors outside of the office.
[03:11:13.875 --> 03:11:32.541]  And every week or two, oh yeah, my brother who's 22 has got cancer, oh yeah, my cousin who was 27 just died of cancer, my neighbor who was 30 just died of cancer, yeah, the neighborhood kid who's 5 just died of cancer, Rob Dues, one of his bandmates, 30-something years old, just died of cancer.
[03:11:34.594 --> 03:11:40.818]  One of my shipping guys' girlfriend, 23 years old, for two years has been fighting for her life against cancer.
[03:11:40.818 --> 03:11:45.141]  I mean, just cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer everywhere!
[03:11:45.141 --> 03:11:49.864]  And we've got all the studies, it's the vaccines and what they're adding to the water.
[03:11:49.864 --> 03:11:50.024]  I mean...
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:57.365]  But the good news is record low numbers, generally 45 to 50% of America.
[03:11:57.365 --> 03:12:01.848]  It's the same numbers in Europe and Canada take the vaccines every year.
[03:12:01.848 --> 03:12:05.711]  It was below 20% this year and dropping.
[03:12:05.711 --> 03:12:06.712]  Some counties lower than 5%.
[03:12:07.873 --> 03:12:17.017]  There are some highly educated counties in New York and in the Bay Area and and north of that in Santa Rosa were almost 80 percent.
[03:12:17.017 --> 03:12:24.921]  In fact, you know, it's like headlines like doctors or health departments scared upwards of 80 percent of parents not vaccinating kids in this county.
[03:12:24.921 --> 03:12:28.443]  And you go find out it's one of the most educated counties in the country because
[03:12:30.017 --> 03:12:34.978]  In fact, the counties that you find are some of the most liberal and socialist, but these are people that woke up.
[03:12:34.978 --> 03:12:42.460]  They're like, wow, when I went to college, they taught us we were gonna kill everybody, but now I found out that this is me too, I'm not taking it.
[03:12:42.460 --> 03:12:45.961]  Let me tell you something, folks, this isn't a joke or a game.
[03:12:45.961 --> 03:12:56.383]  And it's so horrific, it's so horrible, that the average person cannot believe this is really going on, that this is really happening.
[03:12:56.383 --> 03:12:58.004]  Here's another example of literally hundreds.
[03:12:59.108 --> 03:13:05.432]  Aspartame in the mid-1960s was discovered in... I mean, just Google the history of aspartame.
[03:13:05.432 --> 03:13:08.934]  Google the aspartame manufacturing process.
[03:13:08.934 --> 03:13:13.597]  It won't be Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com telling you what we think.
[03:13:13.597 --> 03:13:18.060]  You will be on university websites bragging about it.
[03:13:18.060 --> 03:13:27.466]  They were working in genetic engineering for a chemical weapon, and they genetically engineered E. coli bacteria that can eat toxic waste.
[03:13:28.342 --> 03:13:33.085]  They're also doing studies of bacteria that can eat oil slicks and things.
[03:13:33.085 --> 03:13:35.166]  And now you've all heard about how they have those.
[03:13:35.166 --> 03:13:47.233]  And these E. coli eat these toxic substances they feed them and then they defecate aspartame that's 61 times per gram sweeter than sugar and is an addictive neurotoxin.
[03:13:47.233 --> 03:13:49.495]  And I could have Dr. Blalock talk about that.
[03:13:49.495 --> 03:13:54.277]  Rumsfeld comes along as the head of Monsanto when they bought Searle in the 70s.
[03:13:55.874 --> 03:13:59.136]  And the federal government wouldn't authorize it, saying it's deadly poison.
[03:13:59.136 --> 03:14:01.157]  But they said, look, this is addictive.
[03:14:01.157 --> 03:14:04.839]  We'll put this in drinks, and they will be completely addicted.
[03:14:04.839 --> 03:14:11.363]  And it also eats holes in your brains and causes diabetes, and we've had Blaylock on and other doctors to go over that.
[03:14:11.363 --> 03:14:16.747]  Now, in the last four years, it went from being in the sugarless gum and the sugarless candy
[03:14:17.714 --> 03:14:20.015]  You next time, and everybody's in denial.
[03:14:20.015 --> 03:14:27.439]  You know, my great cousin, smart guy, he was in town visiting us last weekend to see his sister's new baby.
[03:14:27.439 --> 03:14:36.984]  And we're out at my parents' house, and we're swimming around in my parents' pool, and he gets out, goes to his shirt, and gets some breath mints out.
[03:14:36.984 --> 03:14:38.965]  And I said, those have got aspartame in them.
[03:14:38.965 --> 03:14:40.866]  He said, no, they don't, I don't ever eat aspartame.
[03:14:40.866 --> 03:14:42.207]  And I said, give me the package.
[03:14:42.207 --> 03:14:43.908]  I said, aspartame!
[03:14:43.908 --> 03:14:45.869]  He said, my gosh, this isn't even sugarless.
[03:14:48.206 --> 03:14:50.028]  And I said, I know!
[03:14:50.028 --> 03:14:51.068]  It's in 99%.
[03:14:51.068 --> 03:14:53.791]  I mean, I go to H-E-B.
[03:14:53.791 --> 03:14:55.852]  And I go into the candy and gum aisle.
[03:14:55.852 --> 03:14:59.395]  Because, I mean, I'm not a big candy or gum cheerer, but sometimes I want some.
[03:14:59.395 --> 03:15:03.819]  When I'm at the grocery store, sometimes my wife sends me off to get something, I'll go down the candy aisle.
[03:15:03.819 --> 03:15:06.241]  And only the chocolate doesn't have it.
[03:15:06.241 --> 03:15:10.705]  Everything else, just... They may have 40 different types of bubble gum.
[03:15:10.705 --> 03:15:12.966]  And my kids will beg, oh, get me some bubble gum!
[03:15:12.966 --> 03:15:14.968]  And I want to give them a treat.
[03:15:14.968 --> 03:15:16.810]  It's not that it's bad enough.
[03:15:17.694 --> 03:15:20.675]  That corn syrup is linked to diabetes and all these problems.
[03:15:20.675 --> 03:15:22.436]  In fact, pull up the Washington Post.
[03:15:22.436 --> 03:15:25.537]  Half of corn syrup has mercury in it.
[03:15:25.537 --> 03:15:26.157]  Just Google that.
[03:15:26.157 --> 03:15:26.597]  It'll come up.
[03:15:26.597 --> 03:15:27.717]  I want to show people.
[03:15:27.717 --> 03:15:28.898]  That's not bad enough.
[03:15:28.898 --> 03:15:35.520]  It has aspartame that is bacteria chemical weapon feces.
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:38.601]  And I was with my kids at the gas station.
[03:15:38.601 --> 03:15:40.922]  I told this story about a month ago.
[03:15:40.922 --> 03:15:42.262]  We'd gone on a hike on the Greenbelt.
[03:15:42.262 --> 03:15:42.603]  There it is.
[03:15:42.603 --> 03:15:44.923]  Study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[03:15:44.923 --> 03:15:45.524]  Washington Post.
[03:15:47.878 --> 03:15:49.058]  See, everything I say is documented.
[03:15:49.058 --> 03:15:50.419]  This is not my opinion.
[03:15:50.419 --> 03:15:53.580]  And I walk in, and it's a big, nice gas station in my neighborhood.
[03:15:53.580 --> 03:15:55.120]  And I'm looking around, and they say, can I help you?
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:16:01.902]  And I say, I just want to get them some bubble gum, but none of this, you know, it all has aspartame.
[03:16:01.902 --> 03:16:03.383]  And some guy goes, oh, so what?
[03:16:04.685 --> 03:16:06.226]  And then there's some yuppies getting mad.
[03:16:06.226 --> 03:16:07.786]  And I said, that's it, I'm preaching.
[03:16:07.786 --> 03:16:12.048]  It's a chemical weapon, the defecation of bacteria created by the Pentagon.
[03:16:12.048 --> 03:16:15.630]  It's highly addictive and causes brain damage and attacks every organ.
[03:16:15.630 --> 03:16:16.590]  And I just started preaching.
[03:16:16.590 --> 03:16:17.390]  I just started preaching.
[03:16:17.390 --> 03:16:18.251]  I started preaching.
[03:16:18.251 --> 03:16:20.732]  And I told my children, we're supposed to stand up for humanity.
[03:16:20.732 --> 03:16:21.992]  We're not supposed to be sheep.
[03:16:21.992 --> 03:16:27.755]  But all these people in here laughing at us, they're too scared to even speak out or talk to their neighbor.
[03:16:27.755 --> 03:16:29.916]  They gotta run home and watch their television sets.
[03:16:30.828 --> 03:16:35.889]  And my kids have learned to be confident, and they're like, that's right, Daddy, you tell them, New World Order brainwashing.
[03:16:35.889 --> 03:16:59.756]  And I walk out into the sun, and it's a, I think they got 10 pumps, and there's cars everywhere, and I'd seen all these brainwashed, three or four people inside the store, and it's Alex Jones, we love you, that's the New World Order, and just all these cars and people pumping gas, so there was the dumbed down people, and I was getting depressed, but then I walked outside, and it was just almost every car, every group, I could barely get out of there, shaking hands with people,
[03:17:00.868 --> 03:17:01.768]  They were awake.
[03:17:01.768 --> 03:17:03.209]  They saw the documentation.
[03:17:03.209 --> 03:17:10.072]  And as Dr. Blaylock said, the government's moving to force you to take these vaccines and force you to take these drugs.
[03:17:10.072 --> 03:17:14.013]  That's what government health care is about, number one.
[03:17:14.013 --> 03:17:18.475]  And so that's the good news is we're waking people up and we're not going to stop.
[03:17:18.475 --> 03:17:20.796]  And folks, we're saving millions of people.
[03:17:20.796 --> 03:17:22.676]  So I'm not worried if the globalists kill me.
[03:17:22.676 --> 03:17:23.477]  I want to keep living.
[03:17:23.477 --> 03:17:26.418]  I don't want to die, but I'm not worried about it.
[03:17:26.418 --> 03:17:29.079]  It is a natural, good, wholesome human instinct
[03:17:30.131 --> 03:17:32.432]  Don't wanna warn people.
[03:17:32.432 --> 03:17:36.353]  And I was just quietly telling my kids, sorry, you can't have that, it's got aspartame.
[03:17:36.353 --> 03:17:38.494]  Sorry, you can't have that, it's some yuppie.
[03:17:38.494 --> 03:17:42.095]  He got in a brand new BMW when he went outside.
[03:17:42.095 --> 03:17:47.376]  He saw that, knew who I was, said something smart to me, and I just gave it to him.
[03:17:47.376 --> 03:17:52.938]  Not in a mean way, I just stood up, stuck my chest out, and said, I'm now going to warn all of you.
[03:17:52.938 --> 03:17:54.538]  This guy thinks it's funny.
[03:17:54.538 --> 03:17:59.660]  I'm now gonna, I went on a five minute talk right there in that gas station.
[03:18:00.956 --> 03:18:07.781]  And that's what it's going to take to stop these people getting through your comfort zone, standing up and declaring the truth.
[03:18:07.781 --> 03:18:10.143]  And it's that spirit that's going to crush the enemy.
[03:18:10.143 --> 03:18:12.064]  You stand up, you have the truth.
[03:18:12.064 --> 03:18:18.869]  As the founder of the Texas Rangers said, a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a coming.
[03:18:18.869 --> 03:18:20.511]  And I am going to keep on a coming.
[03:18:20.511 --> 03:18:22.432]  And we got to stop drinking fluoride water.
[03:18:22.432 --> 03:18:24.854]  We got to purify the water coming that we take baths in.
[03:18:25.174 --> 03:18:34.057]  We've got to stop eating GMO, we've got to stop eating aspartame, we've got to start reading labels, we've got to start getting informed, we've got to take action, and we've got to warn everybody we know.
[03:18:34.057 --> 03:18:38.579]  Now I just went on that rant, when I come back, how green is your love life?
[03:18:38.579 --> 03:18:40.140]  This is what they had on Earth Day yesterday.
[03:18:41.584 --> 03:18:43.666]  Don't be so keen on having babies.
[03:18:43.666 --> 03:18:46.748]  How about adopting a child instead or implementing a one-child policy?
[03:18:46.748 --> 03:18:50.711]  And then I want to go into how they're taking over all our cities.
[03:18:50.711 --> 03:18:53.794]  The big banks get most of the money that your city raises in taxes.
[03:18:53.794 --> 03:18:55.375]  They invest it.
[03:18:55.375 --> 03:18:57.196]  And they passed it last night.
[03:18:57.196 --> 03:18:58.117]  I've been warning you about this.
[03:18:58.117 --> 03:18:59.638]  It's happening all over the country.
[03:18:59.638 --> 03:19:03.841]  Many cities did it on Death Day, World Government Slavery Day, known as Earth Day.
[03:19:04.822 --> 03:19:12.475]  And on Slave Day yesterday, on Eugenics, Death Cult Day, Austin Renewable Energy Plans sails easily through council.
[03:19:12.475 --> 03:19:13.697]  Unanimously they vote.
[03:19:14.605 --> 03:19:30.788]  For a $2.6 billion tax in the next three years on gas and power, and I was listening to the head of the city energy program on the radio this morning going, well, it will be a 35 to 50% increase in your power, but it's for the earth.
[03:19:30.788 --> 03:19:38.130]  No, it's for these bastards sucking everybody dry and running our lives and carrying out a eugenics program.
[03:19:38.130 --> 03:19:39.950]  That's what this is all about.
[03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:41.931]  That's why all this is going on.
[03:19:41.931 --> 03:19:43.231]  That's why this is happening.
[03:19:43.911 --> 03:19:48.474]  And they've trained the yuppies and everybody else that it's cool to think we're overpopulated.
[03:19:48.474 --> 03:19:52.057]  What the yuppies don't get is they're being chemically attacked right now.
[03:19:52.057 --> 03:19:53.958]  So I guess in a sick way, it's cute.
[03:19:53.958 --> 03:19:58.181]  The yuppies like kind of being in on the secret that, oh, we're killing all the third world people.
[03:19:58.181 --> 03:19:59.862]  They're killing your dumb ass as well.
[03:20:01.533 --> 03:20:03.655]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, FoodStrike.
[03:20:03.655 --> 03:20:09.080]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[03:20:09.080 --> 03:20:10.401]  Congratulations!
[03:20:10.401 --> 03:20:16.847]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[03:20:16.847 --> 03:20:21.911]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:20:21.911 --> 03:20:22.712]  Now something fun!
[03:20:23.012 --> 03:20:23.973]  It's springtime.
[03:20:23.973 --> 03:20:31.901]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[03:20:31.901 --> 03:20:32.802]  Here's the plan.
[03:20:32.802 --> 03:20:41.711]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[03:20:41.711 --> 03:20:44.034]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[03:20:44.034 --> 03:20:44.214]  Call 800-409-5662.
[03:20:55.178 --> 03:21:04.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:10.281]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:21:10.281 --> 03:21:11.101]  That's right.
[03:21:11.101 --> 03:21:13.942]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:21:13.942 --> 03:21:20.863]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:21:21.423 --> 03:21:29.572]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:29.572 --> 03:21:35.059]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:21:35.059 --> 03:21:38.082]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:40.845 --> 03:21:45.370]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:21:45.370 --> 03:21:45.630]  Call 800-686-2237.

[03:21:47.953 --> 03:21:48.513]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:01.274 --> 03:22:05.317]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:22:05.317 --> 03:22:06.578]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:06.578 --> 03:22:10.441]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:10.441 --> 03:22:12.743]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.743 --> 03:22:18.607]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:18.607 --> 03:22:25.272]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.272 --> 03:22:30.796]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state
[03:22:31.246 --> 03:22:35.427]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:22:35.427 --> 03:22:39.708]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:22:39.708 --> 03:22:45.650]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:45.650 --> 03:22:49.211]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:49.211 --> 03:22:51.172]  The Police State isn't coming.
[03:22:51.172 --> 03:22:52.312]  It's here.

[03:23:00.376 --> 03:23:03.738]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:23:03.738 --> 03:23:07.660]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:23:07.660 --> 03:23:11.382]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:23:11.382 --> 03:23:17.265]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous
[03:23:21.837 --> 03:23:22.117]  I think so.
[03:23:32.708 --> 03:23:37.830]  You'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.

[03:23:52.878 --> 03:23:53.518]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[03:24:03.299 --> 03:24:08.104]  Coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show, then we're going into overdrive.
[03:24:08.104 --> 03:24:12.309]  International sensation Doug Stanhope, comedian, is going to be in here with us.
[03:24:12.309 --> 03:24:13.951]  Known Doug for, I don't know, eight, nine years.
[03:24:13.951 --> 03:24:15.492]  It's longer.
[03:24:15.492 --> 03:24:16.533]  A really interesting fellow.
[03:24:16.533 --> 03:24:17.935]  I haven't seen him in years.
[03:24:17.935 --> 03:24:19.597]  He is here, and we're going to have him in studio.
[03:24:21.553 --> 03:24:27.218]  Look, there are real environmental issues, and they know that humans are concerned about their environment.
[03:24:27.218 --> 03:24:31.322]  And they've been caught red-handed lying about global warming, fear-mongering people.
[03:24:31.322 --> 03:24:33.204]  It's come out in their own emails from the UN.
[03:24:33.204 --> 03:24:34.565]  It's all premeditated.
[03:24:34.565 --> 03:24:35.326]  It's all lies.
[03:24:36.807 --> 03:24:45.274]  The big central banks are the ones financing it, and all over the country and all over the world, they're coming in and saying, oh, it's green energy.
[03:24:45.274 --> 03:24:47.416]  We're going to double your energy prices.
[03:24:47.416 --> 03:24:48.957]  And all this is is another tax.
[03:24:48.957 --> 03:24:54.802]  They're taking over health care as a new tax and cutting the amount of care you get.
[03:24:54.802 --> 03:24:57.164]  And I've been telling you about this the last few months.
[03:24:57.164 --> 03:24:59.446]  They did it with really no public discussion.
[03:25:01.343 --> 03:25:04.406]  Austin Renewable Energy Plan sails easily through.
[03:25:04.406 --> 03:25:09.310]  Austin American Statesman Program would make city among the nation's greenest, but cost concerns persist.
[03:25:09.310 --> 03:25:14.434]  Green means taking over your society, raping you financially.
[03:25:14.434 --> 03:25:19.418]  Here's another report from Austin Energy that has a monopoly over people's power.
[03:25:19.958 --> 03:25:27.980]  And of course, that's why they'd come in and buy up private power companies and shut them off in the last decade, was to then now set up the gouging you're about to enjoy.
[03:25:27.980 --> 03:25:29.861]  And again, this is happening all over the country.
[03:25:29.861 --> 03:25:42.185]  Austin's Energy Carbon Reduction Plan calls for CO2 emissions, which plants breathe, to be reduced by a greater amount than what the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 calls for, also known as the Cap-and-Trade Bill.
[03:25:42.785 --> 03:25:48.308]  And it says it will increase prices and cost $2.6 billion.
[03:25:48.308 --> 03:25:57.193]  Says Austin Energy customers should expect to see slight rate increases, $2.6 billion, more than all taxes combined each year.
[03:25:57.193 --> 03:25:58.734]  So that's what's going on.
[03:25:58.734 --> 03:26:04.717]  Meanwhile, Gore takes cash from water campaign from chemical firm.
[03:26:04.717 --> 03:26:09.580]  They're making water artificially scarce, shutting off the water, training you to pay more for it.
[03:26:10.200 --> 03:26:17.390]  Environmentalists condemn former Vice President for letting controversial company fund Life Earth.
[03:26:17.390 --> 03:26:23.438]  And then I've got another report here where they're talking about putting a big tax on all British
[03:26:24.534 --> 03:26:30.577]  Fruits, flowers, anything shipped in because it's sucking water out of the planet.
[03:26:30.577 --> 03:26:36.179]  UK relies on virtual water from drought-prone countries, says report.
[03:26:36.179 --> 03:26:42.962]  And what's one of the only industries in Kenya other than safaris and nature tours?
[03:26:42.962 --> 03:26:49.045]  Water embedded in imported goods puts severe pressure on areas already short of water.
[03:26:50.618 --> 03:26:53.919]  One of Kenya's main exports is roses.
[03:26:53.919 --> 03:26:55.840]  Sorry, you're not going to have jobs.
[03:26:55.840 --> 03:27:03.063]  And that's why the Third World had been promised all this money from the West under the cap and trade when they got the Copenhagen Treaty back in December.
[03:27:03.063 --> 03:27:04.844]  Remember this on the news?
[03:27:04.844 --> 03:27:12.147]  The Third World said no because it right at, not quite double, but right at doubled the amount of taxes they've got to pay.
[03:27:12.147 --> 03:27:15.208]  And what's in the White House Science Czar's own textbook?
[03:27:16.078 --> 03:27:18.239]  What does the Times of London report?
[03:27:18.239 --> 03:27:20.840]  Billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation?
[03:27:20.840 --> 03:27:26.663]  They say we can't let the third world become industrialized, we've got to forcibly reduce their population.
[03:27:26.663 --> 03:27:30.664]  But once a nation industrializes, the population drops.
[03:27:30.664 --> 03:27:36.947]  Europe only has a 1.3, the US only has a 1.3 population replacement rate of original population.
[03:27:36.947 --> 03:27:38.488]  Third world populations replace us.
[03:27:39.781 --> 03:27:48.703]  So, actually industrializing would make them not have as many kids, but they just want to kill them, and then not let them have industry.
[03:27:48.703 --> 03:27:57.045]  This is all about control, and that's in the Royal Commission on Population report, when they first set up this plan in 1949, and that's been declassified.
[03:27:57.045 --> 03:27:58.146]  We have State Department memorandum 200.
[03:28:00.285 --> 03:28:09.949]  Where Henry Kissinger said, we'll start wars, we'll start famines, and we'll secretly fund third world countries to cut their population by 50% or they won't get IMF World Bank money.
[03:28:09.949 --> 03:28:15.531]  And now the US is going under IMF World Bank control.
[03:28:15.531 --> 03:28:20.553]  Before we go to break here and come back with Doug Stanhope in studio, I want to
[03:28:21.872 --> 03:28:26.581]  Thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[03:28:26.581 --> 03:28:30.909]  We'll actually do that when we come back from break because I don't have my folder.
[03:28:32.516 --> 03:28:33.997]  here with me.
[03:28:33.997 --> 03:28:37.539]  It has gone sayonara for sponsors that I was going to plug.
[03:28:37.539 --> 03:28:38.279]  Oh, here.
[03:28:38.279 --> 03:28:39.560]  Now I have it.
[03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:39.960]  Good.
[03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:41.101]  Underneath the book.
[03:28:41.101 --> 03:28:43.362]  Underneath the eco-science book.
[03:28:43.362 --> 03:28:44.523]  I want to tell you about Ecolablue.
[03:28:44.523 --> 03:28:47.684]  I mean, you might as well just trust the government and drink the sodium fluoride and all the chemicals.
[03:28:47.684 --> 03:28:48.905]  I mean, here's the headline today.
[03:28:48.905 --> 03:28:52.387]  Millions drink toxic water in USA, but EPA says it's approved.
[03:28:52.387 --> 03:28:53.628]  Go ahead and kill yourself, folks.
[03:28:53.628 --> 03:28:56.709]  You know, it's the right thing to do for the elites so the bankers have all your money.
[03:28:56.709 --> 03:28:59.871]  Don't go to Ecolablue.com and get an atmospheric water generator that grabs water
[03:29:00.251 --> 03:29:02.453]  out of the atmosphere and puts it through 12 filters.
[03:29:02.453 --> 03:29:03.833]  Don't do that, okay?
[03:29:03.833 --> 03:29:04.574]  It's for the earth.
[03:29:04.574 --> 03:29:05.575]  Kill your children.
[03:29:05.575 --> 03:29:06.615]  Kill them.
[03:29:06.615 --> 03:29:07.716]  Give them the government water.
[03:29:07.716 --> 03:29:08.817]  Give them all the shots.
[03:29:08.817 --> 03:29:10.378]  They'll sit there drooling in the corner.
[03:29:10.378 --> 03:29:12.259]  It's the cool, trendy thing to do, okay?
[03:29:12.259 --> 03:29:14.760]  All of you that are for population reduction, fine.
[03:29:14.760 --> 03:29:15.941]  Kill yourselves, okay?
[03:29:15.941 --> 03:29:18.443]  As for me, I'm drinking a Cola Blue water, okay?
[03:29:18.443 --> 03:29:19.744]  A Cola Blue dot com.
[03:29:19.744 --> 03:29:20.664]  A Cola Blue dot com.
[03:29:20.664 --> 03:29:20.724]  800-691-6043.
[03:29:20.724 --> 03:29:20.784]  800-691-6043.
[03:29:20.784 --> 03:29:21.985]  A Cola Blue dot com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:21.985 --> 03:29:22.565]  All right.
[03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:36.152]  I got two new films out in the last two weeks, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, and Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[03:29:36.152 --> 03:29:39.812]  Both expose the absolute tyranny being set up in our society.
[03:29:39.812 --> 03:29:44.814]  Get the films at Infowars.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:29:44.814 --> 03:29:46.334]  Doug Stanhope coming up in studio.
[03:29:46.334 --> 03:29:51.755]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[03:29:51.755 --> 03:29:53.156]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.156 --> 03:29:55.696]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.696 --> 03:29:58.377]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:05.195 --> 03:30:06.456]  Tyranny is here.
[03:30:06.456 --> 03:30:10.339]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:30:10.339 --> 03:30:12.620]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:18.505]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:30:18.505 --> 03:30:24.729]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:30:25.149 --> 03:30:31.133]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:30:31.133 --> 03:30:35.316]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:30:35.316 --> 03:30:39.599]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:30:39.599 --> 03:30:45.543]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:30:45.543 --> 03:30:49.106]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:30:49.106 --> 03:30:51.087]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:30:51.087 --> 03:30:51.528]  It's here.

[03:31:01.494 --> 03:31:04.516]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:04.516 --> 03:31:09.839]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:31:09.839 --> 03:31:11.881]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:31:11.881 --> 03:31:16.884]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:31:16.884 --> 03:31:18.064]  How much do you want?
[03:31:18.064 --> 03:31:18.805]  When do you want it?
[03:31:19.185 --> 03:31:21.067]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:21.067 --> 03:31:22.148]  When will you need it?
[03:31:22.148 --> 03:31:24.351]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:31:24.351 --> 03:31:25.692]  Will there be any food?
[03:31:25.692 --> 03:31:27.214]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:31:27.214 --> 03:31:32.479]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:31:32.479 --> 03:31:36.063]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:31:36.063 --> 03:31:39.547]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:31:39.887 --> 03:31:41.108]  How much will you need?
[03:31:41.108 --> 03:31:42.008]  We don't know.
[03:31:42.008 --> 03:31:43.108]  How much do you want?
[03:31:43.108 --> 03:31:44.029]  All you can get.
[03:31:44.029 --> 03:31:45.129]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:45.129 --> 03:31:48.190]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:31:48.190 --> 03:31:51.031]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:51.031 --> 03:31:51.832]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:02.722 --> 03:32:04.725]  Remain in your houses.
[03:32:04.725 --> 03:32:10.493]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:32:10.493 --> 03:32:11.854]  Will they do it?
[03:32:11.854 --> 03:32:14.458]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:32:14.458 --> 03:32:20.406]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:32:20.845 --> 03:32:23.106]  You think it can't happen here?
[03:32:23.106 --> 03:32:27.389]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:32:27.389 --> 03:32:32.272]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:32:32.272 --> 03:32:37.176]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:32:37.176 --> 03:32:41.999]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:32:42.919 --> 03:32:51.351]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:32:51.351 --> 03:32:53.854]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:32:53.854 --> 03:32:56.919]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:32:56.919 --> 03:32:59.843]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:33:13.519 --> 03:33:16.781]  Doug Stanhope has been in stand-up comics since 1990.
[03:33:16.781 --> 03:33:20.524]  He's hosted his own television show, The Man Show, and many other programs.
[03:33:20.524 --> 03:33:23.506]  He's got TV shows in the U.S., England, Canada currently.
[03:33:23.506 --> 03:33:24.947]  We'll talk about some of those.
[03:33:24.947 --> 03:33:26.608]  DougStanhope.com.
[03:33:26.608 --> 03:33:32.612]  You know, I met Joe Rogan, I guess it's got to be 12 years ago now, 9, 10 years ago I had a chance to meet Stanhope.
[03:33:32.612 --> 03:33:33.832]  His comedy certainly changed.
[03:33:33.832 --> 03:33:35.113]  A lot of stuff you do is really funny.
[03:33:35.113 --> 03:33:36.594]  I think you're a talented guy.
[03:33:36.594 --> 03:33:38.616]  I disagree with about 50% of what you say.
[03:33:38.616 --> 03:33:42.138]  Then it gets confusing because I agree with part of the other half.
[03:33:42.278 --> 03:33:47.901]  Before we get into a big argument and a big debate, because I didn't want to get in a fight with you, and you've come ready.
[03:33:47.901 --> 03:33:48.861]  You're all amped up.
[03:33:48.861 --> 03:33:49.401]  No, no, no.
[03:33:49.401 --> 03:33:49.801]  No, no, no.
[03:33:49.801 --> 03:33:51.222]  Hey, hey, that's great.
[03:33:51.222 --> 03:33:51.822]  Say whatever you want.
[03:33:51.822 --> 03:33:52.743]  Do whatever you want.
[03:33:52.743 --> 03:33:54.023]  You said you want to talk about eugenics.
[03:33:54.023 --> 03:33:55.084]  You disagree with me.
[03:33:55.084 --> 03:33:58.325]  So we're going to discuss it all coming up here.
[03:33:58.325 --> 03:34:00.787]  And you were even saying you don't even like Ventura Show that I'm part of.
[03:34:00.787 --> 03:34:02.627]  You can talk about that, whatever you want.
[03:34:02.627 --> 03:34:05.889]  But first off, tell us about what you've been doing lately and about some of the TV shows and stuff.
[03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:08.010]  All I've been doing is stand-up.
[03:34:08.010 --> 03:34:10.572]  Yeah, we did a show for the BBC.
[03:34:10.572 --> 03:34:14.395]  I had a segment in a, it was called News Wipe.
[03:34:14.395 --> 03:34:16.416]  But really, I'm just doing stand-up.
[03:34:16.416 --> 03:34:31.847]  I moved to a small town in Bisbee, Arizona, right on the Mexican border, so I'm right by the fire exit when the whole endgame, when the whole country falls apart, I'm right by the Mexican border, so I'm at the fire exit to get the hell out of here.
[03:34:31.847 --> 03:34:33.969]  I watch your videos, they scare the hell out of me.
[03:34:36.207 --> 03:34:38.168]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:34:38.168 --> 03:34:40.770]  Early on, you didn't think 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:34:40.770 --> 03:34:42.711]  I think over the years, you've changed that stance some.
[03:34:42.711 --> 03:34:45.592]  I've talked about the banks are going to implode things by design.
[03:34:45.592 --> 03:34:46.313]  Now that's happened.
[03:34:46.313 --> 03:34:48.534]  So why am I wrong then about other stuff?
[03:34:48.534 --> 03:34:49.494]  I didn't say you were wrong.
[03:34:49.494 --> 03:34:52.816]  I didn't say you were wrong at all.
[03:34:52.816 --> 03:34:56.958]  I've always preached incentive-based eugenics.
[03:34:56.958 --> 03:34:59.460]  I don't see where there's anything wrong with a plan.
[03:35:01.260 --> 03:35:08.004]  When you take the force out of it, if you made it an incentive-based program, and there are programs out there paying... It's called industrialization.
[03:35:08.004 --> 03:35:10.385]  Alright.
[03:35:10.385 --> 03:35:16.188]  As long as... Well, every country that's industrialized goes from an average of 3.7 children globally to 1.3.
[03:35:16.188 --> 03:35:17.429]  Alright.
[03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:19.750]  And so... 1.3 is still too many.
[03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:22.452]  When you live in a finite... No, no, when you have two parents, 1.3 isn't even replacement.
[03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:29.421]  If people only had 1.3 forever, our population would go extinct.
[03:35:29.421 --> 03:35:34.583]  And then traffic would be good, and I wouldn't have to worry about getting from here to KLBJ.
[03:35:34.583 --> 03:35:36.304]  But everybody's got a right to exist.
[03:35:36.304 --> 03:35:39.645]  I tell people that really believe in eugenics, they should kill themselves.
[03:35:39.645 --> 03:35:43.266]  Well, I'm not planning on breeding, and that's changed me a lot, Alex.
[03:35:43.266 --> 03:35:44.987]  No, you gotta go further, Doug.
[03:35:44.987 --> 03:35:45.787]  You gotta go further.
[03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:48.942]  Okay, because you're still taking up resources.
[03:35:48.942 --> 03:35:50.143]  You took a jet airplane ride here.
[03:35:50.143 --> 03:35:55.647]  If you believe in all this... Yeah, yeah, and one child increases your carbon footprint 40 times.
[03:35:55.647 --> 03:35:57.549]  So you believe carbon dioxide's bad?
[03:35:57.549 --> 03:35:58.430]  I have no idea.
[03:35:58.430 --> 03:36:00.752]  I don't think about this stuff.
[03:36:00.752 --> 03:36:01.833]  I have a fun life.
[03:36:01.833 --> 03:36:04.955]  Listen, I'm going to let you roll, because you were nice to come in.
[03:36:04.955 --> 03:36:09.159]  We're going 30 minutes into Overdrive 2, or 20 minutes or so, then you're going to 93.7 to be on with them.
[03:36:11.761 --> 03:36:13.062]  I mean, there's so much to talk about.
[03:36:13.062 --> 03:36:20.749]  Give me your view on eugenics, because there's the public eugenics, positive and negative, is within that, the public system of eugenics.
[03:36:20.749 --> 03:36:27.396]  But there's a real overlay, elite eugenics, of social Darwinism, where they want to basically kill, in their internal documents, 99.9%, publicly 80%.
[03:36:30.118 --> 03:36:33.219]  All right, well, again, you have all these facts and figures.
[03:36:33.219 --> 03:36:34.380]  I have no idea.
[03:36:34.380 --> 03:36:35.980]  I have the White House signs, Zarsburg.
[03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:37.121]  You are like the Internet.
[03:36:37.121 --> 03:36:38.041]  But I mean, do you like him?
[03:36:38.041 --> 03:36:42.923]  Such a barrage of information that you just can't take it all in.
[03:36:42.923 --> 03:36:49.986]  It's like when you go on Wikipedia and you click a link and that takes you to a page and you click another link and then you go, I don't even know why I went on the Internet to begin with.
[03:36:50.786 --> 03:36:53.168]  You're just such a barrage of information.
[03:36:53.168 --> 03:36:56.850]  I think yes, I think that people are basically dumb.
[03:36:56.850 --> 03:36:58.011]  I'm an elitist.
[03:36:58.011 --> 03:37:00.312]  I'm a drunk.
[03:37:00.312 --> 03:37:10.038]  I'm not educated and I believe I'm probably in the top 5% of the smartest people on this planet, which is really scary because I'm not bright at all.
[03:37:10.038 --> 03:37:13.741]  And yeah, I'm somewhat of an elitist and I think eugenics
[03:37:14.301 --> 03:37:21.947]  Before you ask for the people to rise up and take what's theirs, meet the people, because they're really, really buffooned.
[03:37:21.947 --> 03:37:27.871]  But that's the modern decadent society, and there's always been slobs out there, and it is a lot worse now.
[03:37:27.871 --> 03:37:35.597]  The problem is the elite are using the slobs and putting them in police uniforms to destroy the middle class, which the elite say is their genetic enemy.
[03:37:35.597 --> 03:37:40.140]  The elite obsess over people like me or other people that are smart.
[03:37:40.140 --> 03:37:41.081]  They want me dead.
[03:37:41.081 --> 03:37:42.122]  I'm their real enemy.
[03:37:42.122 --> 03:37:43.263]  Eugenics is targeting me.
[03:37:45.136 --> 03:37:46.237]  I don't like that.
[03:37:46.237 --> 03:37:50.461]  I know, and that's why I want a job application from the New World Order.
[03:37:50.461 --> 03:37:52.823]  I want to be on that side.
[03:37:52.823 --> 03:38:03.954]  That's what sucks is when you're in the middle, where you go, alright, I'm aware of this power elite that's manipulating me and people not being aware of it, but I also see people not wanting to...
[03:38:05.175 --> 03:38:06.096]  They want to be led.
[03:38:06.096 --> 03:38:09.559]  As long as you want to be led, you're going to have leaders that are corrupt.
[03:38:09.559 --> 03:38:11.040]  And that's going to just go on.
[03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:12.582]  It's going to be cyclical.
[03:38:12.582 --> 03:38:18.467]  And I think... Well, I mean, clearly, humans do do toxic things to the planet, but so do volcanoes and asteroids.
[03:38:18.467 --> 03:38:20.569]  And I'm all for cleaning things up.
[03:38:20.569 --> 03:38:22.530]  My issue is, this isn't cleaning it up.
[03:38:22.530 --> 03:38:24.812]  This is the banks cleaning up their competition.
[03:38:24.812 --> 03:38:26.193]  So, I mean, what would you do then?
[03:38:27.314 --> 03:38:28.015]  You know what I did?
[03:38:28.015 --> 03:38:33.797]  I bought a little house on the border in a small town, and I'm just whittling away my days trying to enjoy myself.
[03:38:33.797 --> 03:38:36.479]  Because I'm not leaving anyone behind on this planet.
[03:38:36.479 --> 03:38:37.399]  That's your problem.
[03:38:37.399 --> 03:38:38.340]  You're a father.
[03:38:38.340 --> 03:38:39.380]  You're not going to have children.
[03:38:39.380 --> 03:38:39.680]  No.
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:41.361]  Get a vasectomy.
[03:38:41.361 --> 03:38:42.522]  I'm tied up.
[03:38:42.522 --> 03:38:44.423]  If I wanted a kid, I would adopt one.
[03:38:44.963 --> 03:38:50.164]  There's plenty of pre-made people on this planet that are unwanted and waiting for you to come.
[03:38:50.164 --> 03:39:02.208]  So the hundreds of thousands of years of your genetic line and all the struggling and fighting cave bears and other tribes and everything that brought you to this point, you want that to leave the solar system?
[03:39:02.668 --> 03:39:03.128]  Not me.
[03:39:03.128 --> 03:39:05.409]  I want my genetics going to Alpha Centauri.
[03:39:05.409 --> 03:39:06.089]  And it is.
[03:39:06.089 --> 03:39:07.170]  We're going to defeat these people.
[03:39:07.170 --> 03:39:10.791]  We're going to spill out in giant hordes and colonize space.
[03:39:10.791 --> 03:39:13.372]  And we're going to turn into something unbelievably powerful.
[03:39:13.372 --> 03:39:15.512]  And then people will ruin space.
[03:39:15.512 --> 03:39:18.473]  You'll have East space versus West space.
[03:39:18.473 --> 03:39:20.694]  We'll ruin space!
[03:39:20.694 --> 03:39:25.136]  Hundreds of billions of galaxies with trillions and trillions of stars.
[03:39:25.136 --> 03:39:28.377]  No, I'm saying... Thousands of habitable planets already discovered.
[03:39:28.817 --> 03:39:31.078]  I appreciate your passion, and I wish I had it, and I wish I had hope.
[03:39:47.222 --> 03:39:57.167]  But I deal with people every day, and the more you look at how tragically awful human beings are at their core... Well, I will say this.
[03:39:57.167 --> 03:39:58.888]  I thought everybody was like my parents.
[03:39:58.888 --> 03:40:03.450]  Really good, loving, intelligent, compassionate, people that enjoyed beauty and were honorable.
[03:40:03.450 --> 03:40:06.191]  And sure, but I've had elitists tell me this.
[03:40:06.191 --> 03:40:08.732]  They said, Alex, the public scum, you need to just join us.
[03:40:08.732 --> 03:40:13.634]  You know, let's say off record, and I've had meetings with people, quite a few CEOs, globalists.
[03:40:13.634 --> 03:40:14.215]  Drop my name.
[03:40:15.558 --> 03:40:16.158]  Well, no.
[03:40:16.158 --> 03:40:17.019]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[03:40:17.019 --> 03:40:17.860]  I've been taking it up on the man.
[03:40:17.860 --> 03:40:22.183]  But the thing is, once you give in to that, that they're all scum, then the sky's the limit.
[03:40:22.183 --> 03:40:23.704]  I mean, then we do destroy society.
[03:40:23.704 --> 03:40:24.705]  See, that's a spell.
[03:40:24.705 --> 03:40:25.565]  That's a delusion.
[03:40:25.565 --> 03:40:27.226]  It's like a mind virus.
[03:40:27.226 --> 03:40:32.270]  Well, I think you constantly have to fight the powers that be on some level.
[03:40:32.270 --> 03:40:36.413]  Again, you're trying to fight everybody at once, and you're amazing.
[03:40:36.413 --> 03:40:38.034]  I am not amazing.
[03:40:38.034 --> 03:40:39.375]  Doug, stand up, though.
[03:40:39.375 --> 03:40:40.176]  You're a great comic.
[03:40:40.736 --> 03:40:41.837]  And that's what throws me.
[03:40:41.837 --> 03:40:43.577]  It's so much what you say I totally agree with.
[03:40:43.577 --> 03:40:46.478]  And then there's so many other things I see and I find it very disturbing.
[03:40:46.478 --> 03:40:48.319]  But I guess at least it gets me thinking.
[03:40:48.319 --> 03:40:50.360]  DougStanhope.com is the website.
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:50.860]  We've got a link.
[03:40:50.860 --> 03:40:54.802]  All my fans are waiting for you to call me a degenerate atheist.
[03:40:54.802 --> 03:40:58.383]  Say it's only a matter of time before he refers to you as a degenerate atheist.
[03:40:58.723 --> 03:41:01.684]  Well, I did refer to you that when you were nice enough to have me introduce you on stage.
[03:41:01.684 --> 03:41:12.806]  Yes, and I... But that's because even though I like you at certain levels, I can't be dishonest about... At the same time... You can call me a degenerate guy that believes in fairy tale gods.
[03:41:12.806 --> 03:41:19.447]  And I would say that if you were... The problem is I am directly energized by the spirit of the universe.
[03:41:19.447 --> 03:41:20.107]  I can feel it.
[03:41:20.107 --> 03:41:20.667]  It guides me.
[03:41:20.667 --> 03:41:21.727]  I know it's there.
[03:41:21.727 --> 03:41:23.648]  I've seen things that I wouldn't even tell people on air.
[03:41:23.648 --> 03:41:23.928]  Sure.
[03:41:23.928 --> 03:41:24.848]  I've had experiences.
[03:41:24.848 --> 03:41:25.408]  It's real.
[03:41:25.948 --> 03:41:27.149]  We're only in a very thin dimension here.
[03:41:27.149 --> 03:41:27.869]  A very small part.
[03:41:27.869 --> 03:41:29.691]  You've got senses other than your eyes, your touch, your smell.
[03:41:38.928 --> 03:41:45.536]  I would love to just have one clip of Alex Jones scratching his head going, you know, I really don't know.
[03:41:45.536 --> 03:41:48.279]  Joe Rogan believes in God now.
[03:41:48.279 --> 03:41:48.579]  Does he?
[03:41:48.579 --> 03:41:49.520]  Oh yeah.
[03:41:49.520 --> 03:41:50.642]  He bred, too.
[03:41:50.642 --> 03:41:51.242]  He has a kid.
[03:41:51.242 --> 03:41:53.525]  Yeah, as soon as you do that, you believe in God.
[03:41:53.525 --> 03:41:54.166]  He believes in God.
[03:41:54.166 --> 03:41:56.949]  Because once you have children, it triggers mechanisms in you.
[03:41:59.386 --> 03:42:03.571]  Yeah, it triggers probably horrible things in you.
[03:42:03.571 --> 03:42:06.234]  That whole ape-like need to protect.
[03:42:06.234 --> 03:42:07.636]  It deludes logic.
[03:42:11.424 --> 03:42:11.865]  I believe.
[03:42:11.865 --> 03:42:14.066]  I never thought clear until I had children.
[03:42:14.066 --> 03:42:14.447]  Really?
[03:42:14.447 --> 03:42:18.169]  I only wish my wife would give me more.
[03:42:18.169 --> 03:42:24.114]  Sex and children are the two things that delude logic the most in this society.
[03:42:24.114 --> 03:42:34.142]  Where everyone's trying to get laid, or once you have kids you have to protect them, and it brings out all that animal instinct in you that makes you ignore the rational, logical part of your brain.
[03:42:34.722 --> 03:42:35.182]  No, no, no.
[03:42:35.182 --> 03:42:43.885]  From an intellectual, and historical, and from the view of anthropology, and sociology, and psychology, our whole design is to breed.
[03:42:43.885 --> 03:42:45.905]  Yeah, and that's the problem.
[03:42:45.905 --> 03:42:51.227]  As they keep breeding and breeding, and we live in a finite space, and that's why... No, we've got to go off-world.
[03:42:51.227 --> 03:42:52.927]  Off-world, okay.
[03:42:52.927 --> 03:42:56.908]  Yeah, once that plan is in effect, then start humping out the kids.
[03:42:56.908 --> 03:42:59.409]  Don't bring the product before you've built the shelves.
[03:42:59.409 --> 03:43:01.750]  But here's the problem, and they talk about this in the movie Idiocracy.
[03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:02.450]  You've seen Mike Judge?
[03:43:02.450 --> 03:43:02.610]  Yeah.
[03:43:02.850 --> 03:43:05.272]  Where it shows the really smart yuppies or whatever.
[03:43:05.272 --> 03:43:07.414]  They're like, oh, we're not going to have kids for the earth.
[03:43:07.414 --> 03:43:09.836]  Then it shows the football player going with the cheerleaders.
[03:43:09.836 --> 03:43:11.718]  I'm going to have babies with all of you!
[03:43:11.718 --> 03:43:12.158]  Sure.
[03:43:12.158 --> 03:43:13.520]  So you see that problem?
[03:43:13.520 --> 03:43:15.602]  Shouldn't smart people have children?
[03:43:15.602 --> 03:43:21.407]  If you want to continue fighting the hordes of retards that make up this planet, sure.
[03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.949]  I see.
[03:43:23.949 --> 03:43:28.113]  I go, no, alright, I have no babies.
[03:43:28.113 --> 03:43:29.694]  I'll leave no problems behind.
[03:43:29.694 --> 03:43:33.058]  I agree with you.
[03:43:33.058 --> 03:43:37.622]  I'm not against your theories about eugenics.
[03:43:37.622 --> 03:43:39.964]  And I'm not saying there's no new world order.
[03:43:39.964 --> 03:43:43.407]  It would be retarded to think there wasn't some kind of new world order.
[03:43:43.407 --> 03:43:48.392]  On every social, you guys, you have people out here, you control
[03:43:48.752 --> 03:43:55.195]  You know, that guy's gonna get to work at 2.30 and he kisses your ass more, so he's gonna get a better job than him.
[03:43:55.195 --> 03:43:58.737]  Not really, not really, not really.
[03:43:58.737 --> 03:44:05.581]  Whatever level of society, so it would be, well whoever does the best job gets paid more out there.
[03:44:07.162 --> 03:44:10.106]  And also, I kind of let them do their own thing as long as they get the job done.
[03:44:10.106 --> 03:44:15.011]  Sure, but I'm saying there's engineering... Well, no, the bigger a group gets, you have to do that, yeah.
[03:44:15.011 --> 03:44:22.660]  Yeah, so it would be illogical to think there aren't people at the top deciding... Well, here's Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:44:22.660 --> 03:44:25.523]  Secret meetings with the Rockefellers to bring in world government.
[03:44:25.523 --> 03:44:26.685]  I mean, that's Times of London.
[03:44:28.331 --> 03:44:28.871]  All right.
[03:44:28.871 --> 03:44:30.532]  Proving what you're saying.
[03:44:30.532 --> 03:44:31.992]  You are well documented.
[03:44:31.992 --> 03:44:35.234]  I don't disagree with... Here's another one.
[03:44:35.234 --> 03:44:37.755]  They gave the homeless people shots and 30% of them died.
[03:44:37.755 --> 03:44:38.255]  That was done.
[03:44:38.255 --> 03:44:40.476]  That's a London Telegraph.
[03:44:40.476 --> 03:44:41.016]  Here's another one.
[03:44:41.016 --> 03:44:47.318]  They give the little black kids the polio and it was a weaponized polio to kill them.
[03:44:47.318 --> 03:44:48.579]  That's CBS News.
[03:44:48.579 --> 03:44:49.019]  All right.
[03:44:49.019 --> 03:44:51.040]  I don't get inoculated.
[03:44:51.040 --> 03:44:52.300]  I don't trust them.
[03:44:52.300 --> 03:44:53.520]  I'm saying sure.
[03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:57.422]  So why don't you get into the New World Order and start making differences that are decent.
[03:44:58.422 --> 03:45:04.246]  Well, no, because they won't let you in the New World Order if you agree with them.
[03:45:04.246 --> 03:45:06.107]  What's the answer?
[03:45:06.107 --> 03:45:10.990]  Well, I agree that, I mean, Larry Silverstein said he blew up Building 7, then he said he didn't say it.
[03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:14.853]  Now Fox News goes, OK, they were going to blow it up, but then we didn't.
[03:45:14.853 --> 03:45:20.557]  And then all the evidence is there they did it, and then the public doesn't get angry about that.
[03:45:20.557 --> 03:45:22.598]  And so the elite says, well, see, we're going to kill them.
[03:45:22.598 --> 03:45:25.060]  And that brings me back to the point that people suck.
[03:45:25.954 --> 03:45:32.298]  If I had to put money on whether or not 9-11 was an inside job, I'd bet money on yes.
[03:45:32.298 --> 03:45:34.660]  But it doesn't affect my life.
[03:45:34.660 --> 03:45:43.306]  There's a lot of tragedies that occur every day that I choose not to just sit around and go, this is wrong, the police state, and they're trying to do this.
[03:45:43.306 --> 03:45:47.789]  You make up your own, you know, you learn how to live under.
[03:45:47.789 --> 03:45:49.290]  But Doug, you're saying you've given up.
[03:45:50.236 --> 03:45:51.337]  To an extent, yeah.
[03:45:51.337 --> 03:45:53.498]  I've given up making myself crazy.
[03:45:53.498 --> 03:45:55.839]  I used to watch your stuff all the time and go mad.
[03:45:55.839 --> 03:46:04.104]  And not just your stuff, but I'd follow links and I would just realize how awful my life became because of all of these things that I'm impotent to do.
[03:46:04.104 --> 03:46:05.725]  Because of the responsibility.
[03:46:05.725 --> 03:46:07.426]  I don't think you're impotent, though.
[03:46:07.426 --> 03:46:09.327]  You're just not going to get instant results.
[03:46:09.327 --> 03:46:12.749]  Sure, and you make small differences where you can.
[03:46:12.749 --> 03:46:13.430]  You act locally.
[03:46:13.430 --> 03:46:17.252]  Because the world's always had problems, but if people don't stand up for what's better, it's going to get a lot worse.
[03:46:17.312 --> 03:46:18.332]  I know, and that's what I said.
[03:46:18.332 --> 03:46:19.413]  It's a cycle.
[03:46:19.413 --> 03:46:20.874]  But then there's a debate about what's better.
[03:46:20.874 --> 03:46:24.255]  The elite believe they're killing us, and most people are getting cancer now.
[03:46:24.255 --> 03:46:25.556]  Everybody's dying around us.
[03:46:25.556 --> 03:46:27.396]  They believe they're helping.
[03:46:27.396 --> 03:46:30.698]  And I believe they're not.
[03:46:30.698 --> 03:46:35.680]  Well, yeah, you believe you're helping by, you know, what do you call it?
[03:46:35.680 --> 03:46:36.880]  Making babies.
[03:46:36.880 --> 03:46:38.161]  I lost the big word there.
[03:46:38.161 --> 03:46:38.881]  But procreating.
[03:46:38.881 --> 03:46:39.541]  Breeding.
[03:46:39.541 --> 03:46:40.682]  Yeah, procreating.
[03:46:40.682 --> 03:46:41.882]  And I think you're wrong.
[03:46:44.977 --> 03:46:45.978]  So what do we do, Den?
[03:46:45.978 --> 03:46:46.518]  Dead air.
[03:46:46.518 --> 03:46:47.078]  How about that?
[03:46:47.078 --> 03:46:49.679]  No, I'm just here listening to you.
[03:46:49.679 --> 03:46:52.401]  Let's move on to something else that we agree on.
[03:46:52.401 --> 03:46:55.122]  Okay, let's talk about the fear-mongering.
[03:46:55.122 --> 03:46:58.344]  You talk a lot about that with the media.
[03:46:58.344 --> 03:47:03.126]  You have to smile a little bit every time you say someone else's fear-mongering.
[03:47:04.667 --> 03:47:06.008]  Come on!
[03:47:06.008 --> 03:47:07.489]  What is this whole show about?
[03:47:07.489 --> 03:47:10.090]  It is about... I'm raising the alarm.
[03:47:10.090 --> 03:47:11.391]  This stuff does concern me.
[03:47:11.391 --> 03:47:14.133]  All right, but anyway, yeah, the fear-mongering, sure.
[03:47:14.133 --> 03:47:16.934]  Yes, people are entertained by it.
[03:47:16.934 --> 03:47:18.975]  Not just you, Fox News, CNN, whatever.
[03:47:18.975 --> 03:47:21.377]  But let's be clear, I fear-monger about real stuff.
[03:47:21.377 --> 03:47:26.560]  You know, I said, hey, this flu shot is dangerous and the flu isn't going to be bad.
[03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:27.440]  I was right.
[03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:28.901]  They fear-mongered and said the opposite.
[03:47:29.905 --> 03:47:32.326]  Alright, so who died from the flu?
[03:47:51.557 --> 03:47:55.162]  All right, if you're... They use fear that's based on lies.
[03:47:55.162 --> 03:47:57.005]  I use fear that's based on truth.
[03:47:57.005 --> 03:47:59.127]  They use fear that's based on nothing.
[03:47:59.127 --> 03:48:01.070]  It's just silliness.
[03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:03.874]  Something to distract you in your day.
[03:48:03.874 --> 03:48:05.456]  I'm trying to think of an example, but...
[03:48:06.777 --> 03:48:14.643]  Whatever, the stupid hybrid car where your gas pedal is gonna stick and you're gonna go careening into a wall and people are all about the Toyota.
[03:48:14.643 --> 03:48:15.923]  You don't even own a Toyota!
[03:48:15.923 --> 03:48:17.084]  What do you care for?
[03:48:17.084 --> 03:48:18.525]  People like to be distracted.
[03:48:18.525 --> 03:48:28.612]  They want to be afraid because they don't want to face the awful reality that probably nothing of any significance will ever happen to you in your entire life.
[03:48:28.612 --> 03:48:30.033]  Well I want a life of substance!
[03:48:30.553 --> 03:48:49.322]  Yeah, but I'm saying most people will go through life, they're not going to be on American Idol, they won't win the lottery, they won't be caught in gang warfare, they'll just have their hump job in a cubicle, and they'll get a gold watch when they're 60, and they'll die of something, and that's going to be their whole life.
[03:48:49.322 --> 03:48:55.225]  Unless we had goals for our main moon base, and to create an atmosphere on the moon, which can be done, and then to move on to Mars.
[03:48:56.263 --> 03:49:02.065]  Unless we had a race consciousness of humanity to survive as a species and work together.
[03:49:02.065 --> 03:49:10.288]  Yeah, that's easy to talk about, but again... Well, why do I have a deep, over... I mean, almost possessed desire for the species to make it?
[03:49:10.288 --> 03:49:10.728]  I have no idea.
[03:49:10.728 --> 03:49:12.649]  I'm in love with humanity.
[03:49:12.649 --> 03:49:14.249]  I'm in love with all... Phantom Man!
[03:49:14.249 --> 03:49:14.709]  Yeah.
[03:49:14.709 --> 03:49:17.850]  That was Al Pacino as the devil and devil's advocate.
[03:49:17.850 --> 03:49:21.112]  Yeah, well, the devil's actually... and that's another lie of the devil media.
[03:49:21.112 --> 03:49:22.332]  The devil is not a Phantom Man.
[03:49:22.332 --> 03:49:23.872]  The devil comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[03:49:23.872 --> 03:49:24.973]  He wants to destroy man.
[03:49:26.156 --> 03:49:27.717]  He says, I'm a phantom man!
[03:49:27.717 --> 03:49:28.217]  That's right.
[03:49:28.217 --> 03:49:30.578]  That's what you remind me of.
[03:49:30.578 --> 03:49:33.518]  Not the devil, but that kind of passion.
[03:49:33.518 --> 03:49:44.742]  I wish I felt it, Alex, but again, I don't know if it's because I've chosen not to breed or leave people behind, but yeah, I kind of, at some point, do you, don't you want to enjoy your day?
[03:49:44.742 --> 03:49:46.183]  Do you ever take a day off?
[03:49:46.183 --> 03:49:47.043]  That's what I want to know.
[03:49:47.043 --> 03:49:49.044]  Do you ever just go, you know what?
[03:49:49.044 --> 03:49:49.424]  Screw it.
[03:49:49.424 --> 03:49:50.164]  I'm going to the pool.
[03:49:50.504 --> 03:49:51.347]  I do do that.
[03:49:51.347 --> 03:49:52.070]  I do do that.
[03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:53.895]  Alright, enough of the New World Order.
[03:49:53.895 --> 03:49:55.842]  I know it's out there, but take a day off.
[03:49:56.738 --> 03:50:00.601]  Yeah, but then I see chemtrails, I see billboards, propaganda.
[03:50:00.601 --> 03:50:02.062]  I can't imagine being you.
[03:50:02.062 --> 03:50:07.666]  Like, I went through a period of my life where I was that, just insane with it all.
[03:50:07.666 --> 03:50:16.732]  And I'd just love to see you, just one day, sitting by a pool at a Holiday Inn, with Bermuda shorts on, and a big lobster sunburn.
[03:50:16.732 --> 03:50:18.714]  Soaking in sodium fluoride.
[03:50:18.714 --> 03:50:20.275]  Exactly.
[03:50:20.275 --> 03:50:25.659]  At what point do you, I guess... Eating GMO muffins, designed to sterilize me.
[03:50:27.628 --> 03:50:28.869]  How many kids are you gonna have?
[03:50:28.869 --> 03:50:31.751]  I don't like somebody sterilizing me.
[03:50:31.751 --> 03:50:37.996]  Yeah, no, I don't like it either, but... Yeah, beer does the same thing.
[03:50:37.996 --> 03:50:41.418]  It lowers your sperm count, but I like to drink.
[03:50:44.611 --> 03:50:46.813]  Alright, Doug Stanhope, we're going to break.
[03:50:46.813 --> 03:50:49.816]  We've got a lot of other news to cover here on The Other Side.
[03:50:49.816 --> 03:50:54.260]  We're going to talk about the economy, talk about 9-11, individual freedoms, whatever.
[03:50:54.260 --> 03:50:59.445]  And I want to hear one good story from Alex Jones about a nice vacation.
[03:50:59.445 --> 03:51:00.426]  Alright, alright, we're going to break.
[03:51:00.426 --> 03:51:00.886]  We're going to break.
[03:51:00.886 --> 03:51:01.187]  We'll do it.
[03:51:02.412 --> 03:51:09.420]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[03:51:09.420 --> 03:51:18.029]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[03:51:18.029 --> 03:51:22.775]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.
[03:51:23.155 --> 03:51:23.516]  I think so.
[03:51:41.073 --> 03:51:49.921]  Our products are manufactured by a company that's been around 80 years, produces 20 billion herbal pills every year, and is still family-owned.
[03:51:49.921 --> 03:51:55.587]  Call 1-800-973-1486 or go to ResearchedHerbs.com.
[03:51:55.587 --> 03:51:58.129]  ResearchedHerbs.com supplements.
[03:51:58.129 --> 03:52:00.832]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[03:52:03.696 --> 03:52:06.158]  And you're subject to public police action.
[03:52:06.158 --> 03:52:07.419]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.419 --> 03:52:11.221]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:11.221 --> 03:52:13.582]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.582 --> 03:52:19.006]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.446 --> 03:52:26.109]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:26.109 --> 03:52:32.091]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:32.091 --> 03:52:36.273]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:36.273 --> 03:52:40.555]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.555 --> 03:52:43.336]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[03:52:43.856 --> 03:52:44.737]  Don't answer it!
[03:53:03.729 --> 03:53:11.834]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:53:11.834 --> 03:53:13.315]  800-477-9256.
[03:53:13.315 --> 03:53:19.658]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:53:19.658 --> 03:53:23.941]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:53:23.941 --> 03:53:28.904]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan.
[03:53:29.184 --> 03:53:29.604]  I think so.
[03:53:54.858 --> 03:53:55.038]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:54:12.955 --> 03:54:18.061]  We're about to go off all the AM and FM stations, Global Shortwave Satellite and XM here in just a moment.
[03:54:18.061 --> 03:54:21.466]  But we're gonna do a special 30 minute or 20 minutes or so.
[03:54:21.466 --> 03:54:22.827]  LBJ's picking him up.
[03:54:22.827 --> 03:54:23.929]  Overdrive.
[03:54:23.929 --> 03:54:27.153]  It'll be on the audio streams at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:28.514 --> 03:54:36.840]  And you'll also be able to watch the video stream at PrisonPlanet.tv for another 25 minutes or so after the show ends officially here in about five minutes.
[03:54:36.840 --> 03:54:45.365]  Doug Stanhope, we were getting into a nice little debate out there just a moment ago, but tell us about your show coming up in Austin.
[03:54:45.365 --> 03:54:47.927]  Oh, I'll be up Saturday night at Red 7.
[03:54:47.927 --> 03:54:51.390]  It's Red River and 7th, 9 o'clock show, and
[03:54:52.937 --> 03:54:59.381]  You'll hear all... It'll be all the stuff I can't say on the radio, which is most everything I say on stage.
[03:54:59.381 --> 03:55:00.922]  So are you doing one show in Austin?
[03:55:00.922 --> 03:55:02.463]  Just one show, yeah.
[03:55:02.463 --> 03:55:03.784]  Red 7 when again?
[03:55:03.784 --> 03:55:05.745]  Saturday night at 7 o'clock.
[03:55:05.745 --> 03:55:06.045]  Red 7 at 7?
[03:55:06.045 --> 03:55:06.646]  Red 7 at 9.
[03:55:06.646 --> 03:55:07.366]  At 9?
[03:55:07.366 --> 03:55:07.587]  Yeah.
[03:55:07.587 --> 03:55:07.947]  Red 7 at 9.
[03:55:07.947 --> 03:55:08.867]  I don't know.
[03:55:11.229 --> 03:55:12.130]  Something like that.
[03:55:12.130 --> 03:55:12.830]  Ask around.
[03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:14.311]  Google it, lady!
[03:55:14.311 --> 03:55:18.153]  And there's a whole list of tour dates up at DougStanhopeEugenics.com.
[03:55:18.153 --> 03:55:19.294]  All over the world, yes.
[03:55:19.294 --> 03:55:20.995]  DougStanhopeEugenics.com.
[03:55:20.995 --> 03:55:28.540]  Incentive-based, where you offer up some white trash prizes in return for someone... so people willingly sterilize themselves.
[03:55:28.540 --> 03:55:31.662]  Hey, you want to go crossbow hunting with Ted Nugent?
[03:55:32.362 --> 03:55:39.623]  Here's your chance, and people can, you know, through philanthropy, offer up some, hey, a free lifetime supply of Sunny Delight.
[03:55:39.623 --> 03:55:40.984]  You want that, lady?
[03:55:40.984 --> 03:55:44.344]  All you have to do is putty up the front hole.
[03:55:44.344 --> 03:55:45.784]  Oh my gosh.
[03:55:45.784 --> 03:55:46.465]  That's evil.
[03:55:46.465 --> 03:55:47.205]  Stop, stop.
[03:55:47.205 --> 03:55:47.765]  Why?
[03:55:47.765 --> 03:55:48.645]  Why is that evil?
[03:55:48.645 --> 03:55:51.105]  If someone's like... Listen, stop, stop, stop.
[03:55:51.105 --> 03:55:53.686]  No, I'm saying it's a family show here, Doug.
[03:55:53.686 --> 03:55:59.507]  Doug Stanhope, I mean, we have here in the laboratory right now a very interesting specimen.
[03:56:01.742 --> 03:56:04.525]  Some of these other points, individual freedoms, I mean, where are you on that front?
[03:56:04.525 --> 03:56:05.265]  Do you like the police?
[03:56:05.265 --> 03:56:09.089]  No, I'm a libertarian at heart.
[03:56:09.089 --> 03:56:22.140]  I have doubts logically that it could work, because again, it does rely on a faith in humankind, and it's really tough to keep that belief going, that human beings are inherently good.
[03:56:22.140 --> 03:56:27.705]  It's really hard for me to believe that when you see daily what people are like.
[03:56:28.969 --> 03:56:30.750]  Uh, yeah, no, I'm pro-drugs.
[03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:32.390]  I think every drug should be legal.
[03:56:32.390 --> 03:56:34.031]  It's a private property issue.
[03:56:34.031 --> 03:56:35.491]  You own your own body.
[03:56:35.491 --> 03:56:42.013]  If you stop believing that, then you completely own your body and you should be able to do whatever you want with it.
[03:56:42.013 --> 03:56:43.293]  Snort Clorox?
[03:56:43.293 --> 03:56:44.314]  It's yours.
[03:56:44.314 --> 03:56:45.054]  It's your property.
[03:56:45.054 --> 03:56:51.616]  If you find something living inside of you, rent-free, squatting, homesteading in your uterus, you should be able to evict it.
[03:56:51.616 --> 03:56:52.236]  I believe that.
[03:56:55.618 --> 03:56:58.379]  I'm a drug user.
[03:56:58.379 --> 03:57:00.501]  Recreationally, occasional drug user.
[03:57:00.501 --> 03:57:01.901]  Never had a problem with it.
[03:57:01.901 --> 03:57:05.984]  Only thing I've ever had problems with are cigarettes.
[03:57:05.984 --> 03:57:09.246]  Well, I mean, ending the show here on the abortion issue.
[03:57:11.807 --> 03:57:18.650]  I mean, this is, people use it as a contraceptive, and it doubles a woman's chance of different types of cancer.
[03:57:18.650 --> 03:57:20.691]  I mean, because you're terminating something unnatural.
[03:57:20.691 --> 03:57:25.013]  Oh, yeah, I'm not, yeah, no, believe me, I promote sodomy as an alternative.
[03:57:25.013 --> 03:57:28.535]  I'm not saying you should have an abortion, you shouldn't get pregnant.
[03:57:28.535 --> 03:57:31.616]  Oh, I tell you, you are just, the New World Order should love you.
[03:57:31.616 --> 03:57:36.539]  I'm looking for a job app, I'm telling you.
[03:57:36.539 --> 03:57:39.040]  That's because that's everything they promote, and they say that's the reason.
[03:57:40.230 --> 03:57:42.412]  I mean, they say that's why they promote homosexuality.
[03:57:42.412 --> 03:57:43.732]  It's because they don't want people having families.
[03:57:43.732 --> 03:57:51.638]  I think homosexuality is probably a natural occurrence to overpopulation because the planet will weed itself out if it has a problem.
[03:57:51.638 --> 03:57:54.260]  Well, I don't hate those people.
[03:57:54.260 --> 03:57:59.023]  I just know it's statistically a very destructive lifestyle for those people.
[03:57:59.023 --> 03:58:00.064]  It can be pretty painful.
[03:58:00.064 --> 03:58:01.225]  I've tried some of it.
[03:58:01.225 --> 03:58:02.345]  Stop, stop, stop.
[03:58:02.345 --> 03:58:02.746]  Seriously.
[03:58:03.226 --> 03:58:09.578]  Well, Doug Stanhope, I haven't seen you in a long time and you have definitely increased your degenerate atheist...
[03:58:12.249 --> 03:58:13.470]  I'm sorry to have to say that.
[03:58:13.470 --> 03:58:18.694]  I know you don't care, but it's like you're moral, but it's twisted.
[03:58:18.694 --> 03:58:22.357]  You think it's moral what you believe in.
[03:58:22.357 --> 03:58:27.922]  We're going to break for one minute, coming back in overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[03:58:27.922 --> 03:58:31.144]  I think this has been an illustration for people about the enemy we face.
[03:58:31.144 --> 03:58:33.266]  Doug Stanhope, you are the enemy.
[03:58:33.266 --> 03:58:34.127]  You are my enemy.
[03:58:34.127 --> 03:58:34.987]  I just want you to know that.
[03:58:34.987 --> 03:58:36.188]  We'll be right back with the enemy.
[03:58:36.188 --> 03:58:36.649]  Stay with us.

[04:00:12.441 --> 04:00:13.401]  Cyrus Jones!
[04:00:13.401 --> 04:00:15.362]  And 103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[04:00:15.362 --> 04:00:16.402]  Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[04:00:16.402 --> 04:00:20.483]  And we see our whole society going into the gutter.
[04:00:20.483 --> 04:00:21.643]  The collapse of civilization.
[04:00:38.373 --> 04:01:00.700]  Great liberty brings decadence and then societies fall and Doug Stanhope, I mean you say, I mean I can see your world view and I, you believe it's moral at some point, it's almost twisted, well it's more than twisted and I guess you see, you can see my world view I guess is twisted from my perspective because I think I'm doing good and I guess you think you're doing good.
[04:01:01.420 --> 04:01:08.764]  Yeah, I don't, no, I think we're both just, what's another word for peeing into the wind?
[04:01:08.764 --> 04:01:17.428]  Yeah, I think we're probably both wasting a lot of time where we should be enjoying our girlfriends or your children and taking days at the beach.
[04:01:17.428 --> 04:01:27.633]  I think if you took that kind of passion that you have and the intelligence that you have and you just had one focus, just, here, let's change just one thing.
[04:01:29.535 --> 04:01:31.318]  I am trying to change one thing.
[04:01:31.318 --> 04:01:40.973]  I'm trying to get people to have faith again, and to clean ourselves up, and I'm on some high horse, myself included, and try to work together and have a positive attitude.
[04:01:41.644 --> 04:01:45.705]  I mean, just look at the paperwork that you have here.
[04:01:45.705 --> 04:01:46.985]  This is just today.
[04:01:46.985 --> 04:01:48.465]  Let's get a document cam shot.
[04:01:48.465 --> 04:02:00.928]  The economy here, and FEMA camps there, and it's so difficult mentally to try to take what you say and move forward with any of it, because you go, there's too much.
[04:02:00.928 --> 04:02:01.488]  We're screwed.
[04:02:01.488 --> 04:02:02.648]  We're definitely screwed.
[04:02:02.648 --> 04:02:03.408]  We're powerless.
[04:02:03.408 --> 04:02:07.529]  I think if you took that passion and went, okay, let's, whatever, legalize marijuana.
[04:02:07.529 --> 04:02:08.249]  Well, I've done that.
[04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:15.321]  I mean, I do believe in drug decriminalization because I know they bring most of the drugs in as a pretext to control our lives.
[04:02:15.321 --> 04:02:16.523]  I mean, that's on record.
[04:02:16.523 --> 04:02:19.389]  Alright, well, a lot of people... Whatever the new rule is for, I'm against it.
[04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:21.212]  It's real easy.
[04:02:21.212 --> 04:02:21.453]  Right.
[04:02:22.648 --> 04:02:25.869]  So tell me about the last time you took a day off.
[04:02:25.869 --> 04:02:28.610]  It's No Fear Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:02:28.610 --> 04:02:34.811]  Just one day, I want all Alex Jones listeners to... Okay, okay, I'm taking off tomorrow.
[04:02:34.811 --> 04:02:36.452]  Alright.
[04:02:36.452 --> 04:02:43.914]  And I'm going to take my kids swimming, get up, eat breakfast with them, go swimming, go hike around on the Greenbelt.
[04:02:44.534 --> 04:02:44.934]  I think so.
[04:03:05.093 --> 04:03:10.895]  There is a point where you have to say, alright, there is joy in life.
[04:03:10.895 --> 04:03:20.539]  I'll drive through the checkpoints and the cops searching people's cars and the billboards, training people to spy on their neighbors, and then I'll get out to the woods and I'll feel that stillness and that quietness.
[04:03:20.539 --> 04:03:23.840]  And then you'll say, hey wait, I'm in Bohemian Grove.
[04:03:23.840 --> 04:03:24.961]  Damn it, I can't win!
[04:03:26.315 --> 04:03:27.456]  Oh, man.
[04:03:27.456 --> 04:03:29.417]  Doug Stanhope.
[04:03:29.417 --> 04:03:30.478]  Doug Stanhope.
[04:03:30.478 --> 04:03:32.719]  I mean, what else is ticking you off?
[04:03:32.719 --> 04:03:34.220]  I mean, I mean, I believe me.
[04:03:34.220 --> 04:03:38.563]  I am just as enraged as you are when I have to I fly every week.
[04:03:38.563 --> 04:03:39.904]  I have to go through security.
[04:03:39.904 --> 04:03:40.785]  I mutter.
[04:03:40.785 --> 04:03:42.086]  I watch all that.
[04:03:42.086 --> 04:03:43.407]  The pointlessness.
[04:03:43.407 --> 04:03:44.507]  I live by the border.
[04:03:44.507 --> 04:03:47.629]  So every time I drive to the airport, I got to stop by the border patrol.
[04:03:47.629 --> 04:03:51.672]  They have a 50 mile swath that is their domain.
[04:03:51.672 --> 04:03:52.533]  And I have to stop.
[04:03:52.533 --> 04:03:54.034]  And yes, it makes me angry.
[04:03:54.034 --> 04:03:55.595]  But at some point you go.
[04:03:55.595 --> 04:03:55.855]  All right.
[04:03:56.555 --> 04:04:06.897]  Wouldn't I be better off focusing all of my anger at one thing, to try to change one thing, rather than just... The barrage of information.
[04:04:06.897 --> 04:04:07.718]  Your head.
[04:04:07.718 --> 04:04:10.158]  I'd love to see the inside of your brain.
[04:04:10.158 --> 04:04:15.819]  It's gonna be like a pinball machine of synapses firing, and then another synapse stepping on that.
[04:04:15.819 --> 04:04:16.100]  It's baffling.
[04:04:19.068 --> 04:04:30.902]  No, I mean, once you study this stuff, you start understanding it, and then you later, a decade later, read a globalist white paper, and it's word-for-word what you'd already seen and thought, but then it's from their perspective in a bad way.
[04:04:30.902 --> 04:04:32.764]  I mean, they're for it, I'm against it.
[04:04:33.930 --> 04:04:34.531]  I'm just saying.
[04:04:34.531 --> 04:04:45.158]  Look, I know it's slave training to make people take their shoes off and not have water and next go through a naked body scanner and next the cops want to take your DNA and next they want to x-ray women's breasts because they may have bombs.
[04:04:45.158 --> 04:04:53.644]  Look, schools are for us to train you to sit in one place for eight hours and not talk back and sit at your desk and do your hump job and your turn the crank.
[04:04:53.644 --> 04:04:55.145]  Yeah, sure.
[04:04:55.145 --> 04:04:55.966]  I don't like that.
[04:04:55.966 --> 04:04:57.127]  Labor force.
[04:04:57.127 --> 04:04:59.368]  We all can't be president.
[04:04:59.368 --> 04:05:00.149]  We all can't.
[04:05:00.149 --> 04:05:02.250]  The world needs ditch diggers too.
[04:05:02.250 --> 04:05:02.731]  Exactly.
[04:05:05.873 --> 04:05:09.737]  So, how would you like to drop my litter and mow my lawn?
[04:05:09.737 --> 04:05:11.858]  You know who that is?
[04:05:11.858 --> 04:05:12.659]  It's Ted Knight.
[04:05:12.659 --> 04:05:15.922]  How are we going to build things on the moon if someone's not out there welding girt?
[04:05:15.922 --> 04:05:19.805]  Yeah, but Judge Smales is an idiot.
[04:05:19.805 --> 04:05:22.047]  Judge... Judge Smales?
[04:05:22.047 --> 04:05:23.468]  It's okay, it's a candy bar.
[04:05:23.468 --> 04:05:24.930]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[04:05:24.930 --> 04:05:27.332]  Caddy Shack.
[04:05:27.332 --> 04:05:28.473]  Cinderella Story.
[04:05:28.473 --> 04:05:29.794]  Pond Pool.
[04:05:29.794 --> 04:05:30.274]  Pool Pond.
[04:05:32.020 --> 04:05:33.081]  See?
[04:05:33.081 --> 04:05:36.542]  Alex Jones just smiled, thinking about Caddyshack.
[04:05:36.542 --> 04:05:44.305]  Hey, I've been told, what you said at the time, but it's very popular on the internet, about that night, the Iraq War had just started, and I got in their face.
[04:05:44.305 --> 04:05:45.546]  You liked that story.
[04:05:45.546 --> 04:05:46.426]  Oh, what?
[04:05:46.426 --> 04:05:47.447]  With you and me in Austin?
[04:05:47.447 --> 04:05:47.587]  Yeah.
[04:05:47.847 --> 04:05:53.112]  Yeah, it's my favorite piece of video I've ever... It's the only thing I'll watch of myself.
[04:05:53.112 --> 04:05:54.753]  Alex is going to introduce me.
[04:05:54.753 --> 04:05:59.177]  He's down there with Kevin Booth, you might know as Yoko Hicks.
[04:05:59.177 --> 04:06:02.861]  He's down there, and I go, hey, do you want to introduce me?
[04:06:02.861 --> 04:06:04.522]  And Alex says, yeah, yeah, sure.
[04:06:04.522 --> 04:06:05.763]  I'm not a comedian, though.
[04:06:05.763 --> 04:06:07.365]  I don't know what to say.
[04:06:07.365 --> 04:06:08.826]  I go, say whatever you want.
[04:06:08.826 --> 04:06:12.209]  Alex goes on a ten minute rant, trying to cram every
[04:06:13.310 --> 04:06:19.817]  Peace of knowledge he's ever learned in his entire career into a drunken late-night Friday audience.
[04:06:19.817 --> 04:06:22.660]  It's all the same from Pol Pot to Saddam Hussein.
[04:06:22.660 --> 04:06:26.503]  We prop these guys up and he's just barrage and half these people are drunk.
[04:06:26.503 --> 04:06:28.565]  Half the people know Alex so they're clapping.
[04:06:29.406 --> 04:06:33.649]  The other half are waiting for the jokes and they're yelling, you're killing my buzz!
[04:06:33.649 --> 04:06:37.332]  And Alex almost gets into a fist fight with a drunk guy in the front row.
[04:06:37.332 --> 04:06:47.220]  And then as this comes to a crescendo of people yelling at each other in the audience and fights are about to break out, he goes, all right, here's Doug Stanhofer.
[04:06:47.220 --> 04:06:50.162]  I went up into this melee and it was one of the most fun nights.
[04:06:50.162 --> 04:06:51.883]  I love chaos like that.
[04:06:51.883 --> 04:06:52.964]  That's what live shows are about.
[04:06:52.964 --> 04:06:56.567]  Well, what happened was I was criticizing the Iraq war and they're like, shut up, call me.
[04:06:59.786 --> 04:07:02.207]  Some of them were for you and some of them had no idea.
[04:07:02.207 --> 04:07:15.893]  Oh no, I mean it was a minority of people, but they thought, like they were butchering the Dixie Chicks at that point, and they thought I was going to shut up, and that just because they went, I'll kick your butt, I was going to urinate down my leg, and so I meant it.
[04:07:15.893 --> 04:07:17.714]  I told those troops, I said, come on up here.
[04:07:18.594 --> 04:07:25.717]  I really meant it, but you noticed they weren't in a Cobra gunship a mile away killing kids.
[04:07:25.717 --> 04:07:30.619]  At the point I said, come on up here all three of you, I'm going to beat the hell out of you, and I meant it.
[04:07:30.619 --> 04:07:32.600]  They may have gotten me, but I was going to try like hell.
[04:07:32.600 --> 04:07:33.720]  I mean, I was ready.
[04:07:33.720 --> 04:07:34.901]  I mean, that was real.
[04:07:34.901 --> 04:07:39.403]  There were some people, because it was in a comedy club, that assumed you were a comedian.
[04:07:40.843 --> 04:07:42.724]  Well, there were no punchlines.
[04:07:42.724 --> 04:07:45.266]  They were getting it, going, well, this guy's not funny.
[04:07:45.266 --> 04:07:46.986]  He's not supposed to be funny.
[04:07:46.986 --> 04:07:49.508]  He's just up here talking to you.
[04:07:49.508 --> 04:07:55.911]  If you want to see this, just Google search the Austin incident and Doug Stanhope or Alex Jones.
[04:07:55.911 --> 04:07:57.792]  And yeah, it's out there all over the place.
[04:07:57.792 --> 04:07:58.673]  Yeah, we're playing it right now.
[04:08:01.857 --> 04:08:02.737]  Don't fade it up.
[04:08:02.737 --> 04:08:04.458]  There may be some profanity from the crowd.
[04:08:04.458 --> 04:08:06.278]  Certainly not from me.
[04:08:06.278 --> 04:08:09.159]  I'm a white lily of decency.
[04:08:09.159 --> 04:08:13.720]  Yeah, no, I was a bit... I actually came up on stage at one point.
[04:08:13.720 --> 04:08:16.101]  I was profane, so yeah, you might want to kill me.
[04:08:16.101 --> 04:08:17.041]  Very evil.
[04:08:17.041 --> 04:08:22.142]  But seriously, Doug, I mean, maybe Iraq War was a good thing from the elite perspective.
[04:08:22.142 --> 04:08:23.123]  It killed over a million people.
[04:08:25.942 --> 04:08:27.444]  It never affected my day.
[04:08:27.444 --> 04:08:30.587]  I was never at risk of going.
[04:08:30.587 --> 04:08:31.768]  I'm against all war.
[04:08:31.768 --> 04:08:34.070]  And you're not having kids, so they can't get them.
[04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:36.252]  Nope, no kids.
[04:08:36.252 --> 04:08:45.101]  I'm just gonna drift off into the sunset, yelling and hopefully maybe make a difference in my own little tiny town of 6,000 people.
[04:08:45.101 --> 04:08:46.502]  But yeah, I don't...
[04:08:47.623 --> 04:08:52.530]  I guess at one point I thought I would change the world doing stand-up comedy and yelling into a microphone.
[04:08:52.530 --> 04:08:57.898]  I've spent 20 years just stomping on everything that stupid people find joy in.
[04:08:57.898 --> 04:08:59.000]  That's what I do for a living.
[04:08:59.000 --> 04:09:00.341]  Why did you pick the town you're in?
[04:09:01.363 --> 04:09:03.604]  I'd say it's kind of a hippie town.
[04:09:03.604 --> 04:09:04.945]  It's just a town I found.
[04:09:04.945 --> 04:09:06.045]  I had to get out of L.A.
[04:09:06.045 --> 04:09:07.526]  It's called Commie Town?
[04:09:07.526 --> 04:09:11.088]  It's a, well, no, it's half hippie, half Minuteman.
[04:09:11.088 --> 04:09:14.249]  It's got a nice mix, keeps everyone in check.
[04:09:14.249 --> 04:09:20.852]  You know, you've got enough, you've got people wearing, you know, sidearms walking into the grocery store with a six-shooter on their hip.
[04:09:20.852 --> 04:09:22.533]  So it sounds like a Wild West.
[04:09:22.853 --> 04:09:24.494]  But yeah, and you have the hippie element.
[04:09:24.494 --> 04:09:25.255]  It's a mining town.
[04:09:25.255 --> 04:09:34.482]  The mine went bust, so all the property values dropped in the 70s, and people, hippies, artists were buying, you know, houses for $2,500 and whatnot.
[04:09:34.482 --> 04:09:37.405]  So it's got a good, good eclectic mix.
[04:09:37.405 --> 04:09:39.987]  What's the name of the town?
[04:09:39.987 --> 04:09:40.467]  Bisbee.
[04:09:40.467 --> 04:09:41.368]  Bisbee, Arizona.
[04:09:41.368 --> 04:09:42.829]  Uh-oh.
[04:09:43.977 --> 04:09:47.540]  I forgot to turn my phone off, sorry.
[04:09:47.540 --> 04:09:50.462]  It's a text from the Bilderberg Group.
[04:09:50.462 --> 04:09:53.024]  You're pushing your luck, buddy!
[04:09:53.024 --> 04:09:54.045]  Stop texting me!
[04:09:55.546 --> 04:09:58.388]  I think it's actually somebody with your friend Jesse Ventura.
[04:09:58.388 --> 04:10:08.976]  So, so, so, uh, if you were one of the six, uh, major families, there's secretly control the, if you were born into one of those families, what would you do?
[04:10:08.976 --> 04:10:12.138]  What would you do different if you were born into the new world order?
[04:10:12.138 --> 04:10:18.823]  I would try to convince them to not be so predatory and see humanity as scum and trash because it's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[04:10:18.823 --> 04:10:19.103]  All right.
[04:10:19.523 --> 04:10:32.049]  And I would try to work from within to change things, but a lot of this is genetic, and so they've been intermarrying with predatory psychopaths and sociopath genetic types, and most of that is nature, not nurture, and so I probably wouldn't be able to do that.
[04:10:33.341 --> 04:10:45.266]  How do you, how do you change, because the power structure will always, as long as we desire leadership, you're always going to have power mongers trying to get those positions.
[04:10:45.266 --> 04:10:51.848]  If you want people to... That's why you got to have a small government so power mongers can never have a mechanism to be able to carry out their operation.
[04:10:52.128 --> 04:10:52.930]  Yeah, no, certainly.
[04:10:52.930 --> 04:11:01.285]  So that's why big banks will fund both sides of a war because it's actually building their power up through the crisis that allows a bigger state to be grown.
[04:11:01.285 --> 04:11:03.288]  So are you an anarchist?
[04:11:04.562 --> 04:11:05.782]  Not completely.
[04:11:05.782 --> 04:11:10.824]  I mean, the real political spectrum is no government on one end, total government on the other, not left-right.
[04:11:10.824 --> 04:11:13.424]  Because, you know, the right brings you big government, the left brings you big government.
[04:11:13.424 --> 04:11:15.825]  It's a false dichotomy, only about 100 years old.
[04:11:15.825 --> 04:11:20.326]  Before that, left-right dealt with mysticism, the left-hand path, the right-hand path.
[04:11:20.326 --> 04:11:24.647]  One was supposedly female, one male, or one deceptive, devilish, one, you know,
[04:11:25.247 --> 04:11:32.111]  See, this is what I was talking about, the inside of your brain, where you had me for a minute, and then mysticism, and then one synapse in your head.
[04:11:32.111 --> 04:11:36.072]  No, but I was saying, until about a hundred years ago, the left-right paradigm was not taught.
[04:11:36.072 --> 04:11:41.655]  It was liberty versus tyranny, and there was a debate about what is liberty, what is tyranny, and so you could have a real debate.
[04:11:41.655 --> 04:11:45.177]  But once they created the left-right paradigm, it's all within tyranny's orbit.
[04:11:45.937 --> 04:11:50.660]  Uh, and so it's a false choice, uh, question.
[04:11:50.660 --> 04:11:53.302]  Uh, and so that's what's going on.
[04:11:53.302 --> 04:12:06.451]  And so I want to think a hundred years ago when you had a town crier and we have one local newspaper and you know, most people knew again, it comes down to overpopulation when humanity is just like any other commodity where the more you have, the less the value.
[04:12:06.451 --> 04:12:07.391]  I believe that.
[04:12:07.391 --> 04:12:15.397]  And I think the more people when you're trying to talk about, you know, uh, government, what 300 million people we have in this country.
[04:12:16.217 --> 04:12:17.798]  You can't judge that.
[04:12:17.798 --> 04:12:21.020]  You can't rule that like it's a community.
[04:12:21.020 --> 04:12:28.505]  So yeah, you should have... But I mean, they admit Homeland Security helped produce 24, teach people torture, secret arrest is good.
[04:12:28.505 --> 04:12:34.188]  I mean, the globalists admit they want us to be immoral, and you can judge, well, what's immoral?
[04:12:34.188 --> 04:12:39.251]  You know, some people say, well, this kind of sex isn't immoral, but torture is.
[04:12:39.251 --> 04:12:41.852]  And then they'll say, well, no, you're not allowed to make a moral judgment.
[04:12:41.852 --> 04:12:44.494]  But they're coming from their own sickening moral perspective.
[04:12:44.634 --> 04:12:48.057]  Alright, but you're acting like people don't want to watch that naturally.
[04:12:48.057 --> 04:12:49.959]  24 and torture and stuff.
[04:12:49.959 --> 04:12:50.639]  We were kids.
[04:12:50.639 --> 04:12:53.602]  We watched Faces of Death when that video came out.
[04:12:53.602 --> 04:12:59.287]  It was the most, you know, that was the biggest thing to do as a 13-year-old kid was get that copy of Faces of Death.
[04:12:59.287 --> 04:13:00.588]  I remember, but I didn't like it.
[04:13:00.588 --> 04:13:02.509]  Yeah, but no one was pushing that on you.
[04:13:02.509 --> 04:13:04.051]  Of course, you didn't like it, but you looked.
[04:13:04.651 --> 04:13:09.852]  Yes, there's an... What, in Saudi Arabia when they're chopping heads off?
[04:13:09.852 --> 04:13:10.272]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:13:10.272 --> 04:13:11.972]  And car wrecks.
[04:13:11.972 --> 04:13:14.253]  You can't act... Alligators eating people.
[04:13:14.253 --> 04:13:16.453]  They're putting 24 on to teach you torture.
[04:13:16.453 --> 04:13:18.174]  Well, people want to see that, regardless.
[04:13:18.174 --> 04:13:21.774]  Yeah, but it took the torture but made it good.
[04:13:21.774 --> 04:13:24.795]  Before they'd always said it was bad, but you'd still watch the torture.
[04:13:24.795 --> 04:13:26.035]  Now they're saying, no, it's good.
[04:13:26.035 --> 04:13:27.615]  See, people 50 years ago weren't wimps.
[04:13:32.003 --> 04:13:36.065]  But when they saw torture violence, it became upsetting because they associated it with real things.
[04:13:36.065 --> 04:13:45.309]  Now we see humans being killed, we can't get upset, but Marines throw a puppy off a cliff, everybody goes into, you know, heart attack mode, because we haven't dehumanized the puppy yet.
[04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:54.832]  You know, it's the same thing, I killed an iPad two weeks ago, and it got like 300,000 views or something, and people were freaking out over the iPad, because it had more value to them than their fellow humans.
[04:13:54.832 --> 04:14:00.375]  Well, again, yes, you've... But my whole point is that when they give up... You've flooded the market with humans.
[04:14:01.235 --> 04:14:02.816]  iPads are new.
[04:14:02.816 --> 04:14:09.218]  Yeah, but when we don't have value for other humans, we lose our value.
[04:14:09.218 --> 04:14:15.541]  And then people stop valuing themselves and stop having larger and better goals, and so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[04:14:15.541 --> 04:14:15.741]  Sure.
[04:14:16.840 --> 04:14:28.949]  I mean, my God, listen, you say you've given up on a lot of things, but then, and you're telling people not to breed, but, and I don't think you should commit suicide, you and your girlfriend, and your neighbor you brought with you, but, I mean, that's the logical extension.
[04:14:28.949 --> 04:14:32.011]  And there actually are some families that are killing themselves now in the news.
[04:14:32.011 --> 04:14:35.134]  I'm sure you've seen that.
[04:14:35.134 --> 04:14:36.495]  For the Earth, for the Earth.
[04:14:36.495 --> 04:14:39.737]  I have, yeah, no, I have... They're killing their babies.
[04:14:39.737 --> 04:14:41.618]  That is a door that's... The U.N.
[04:14:41.618 --> 04:14:43.860]  says... Well, a lot of U.N.
[04:14:43.860 --> 04:14:46.242]  officials say they want to start killing babies after they're born.
[04:14:48.137 --> 04:14:49.979]  Alright, come on, break that down for me.
[04:14:49.979 --> 04:14:57.846]  No, no, I mean Peter Singer and a lot of these top globalists say they want to be able to kill old people and they also want to be able to let people kill their kids up until about age two.
[04:15:00.148 --> 04:15:01.228]  Just randomly?
[04:15:01.228 --> 04:15:05.629]  Well, for the earth, I mean, if you want to kill your... Yeah, no, suicide is definitely an option for me.
[04:15:05.629 --> 04:15:12.311]  It's something I consider... Well, they actually have, I forget the name of the group we've had them on, they actually have an organization that recommends people commit suicide.
[04:15:12.311 --> 04:15:14.131]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:15:14.131 --> 04:15:18.052]  I think it's a cute website to send people to, but... Oh, you've seen it?
[04:15:18.052 --> 04:15:21.693]  Yeah, oh yeah, come on, with my... But you're not going to commit suicide?
[04:15:21.693 --> 04:15:28.514]  Not at this point, but yeah, when things get ugly, I'm not going to be someone on life support, you know,
[04:15:29.724 --> 04:15:31.604]  Fighting for my last breath.
[04:15:31.604 --> 04:15:32.525]  Life's not that good.
[04:15:32.525 --> 04:15:33.925]  It's pretty boring after a while.
[04:15:33.925 --> 04:15:37.906]  You get to a point where you go, all right, I've done all the drugs.
[04:15:37.906 --> 04:15:39.146]  See, I don't need drugs.
[04:15:39.146 --> 04:15:41.447]  I mean, I drink coffee and stuff, but I don't need drugs.
[04:15:41.447 --> 04:15:43.687]  I mean, some days it's just so beautiful.
[04:15:43.687 --> 04:15:53.869]  Just, just the, I mean, what is it about the human psyche and engineering that we know a sunset's beautiful, that we see an ocean is beautiful, that we see birds nesting, you know, in the eve of your house.
[04:15:53.869 --> 04:15:56.330]  I got Alex Jones saying positive things.
[04:15:56.630 --> 04:16:01.794]  No, but I talk about it all the time with, you know, their beautiful blue feathers and little silver gold chest of these swallows.
[04:16:01.794 --> 04:16:07.799]  And I, and, and, you know, three or four generations at my house now know me and they like me almost land on my shoulder.
[04:16:07.799 --> 04:16:10.481]  You know, I mean, they're seeing the beauty in the world.
[04:16:10.481 --> 04:16:11.422]  I see the beauty in the world.
[04:16:11.422 --> 04:16:13.123]  I don't think there's too many swallows.
[04:16:13.123 --> 04:16:14.965]  I mean, it's, it's, there's a whole bunch of them.
[04:16:14.965 --> 04:16:17.047]  I probably got 50 of them at my house.
[04:16:17.047 --> 04:16:21.771]  I just pictured Alex Jones as Dr. Doolittle with birds landing on his shoulders.
[04:16:21.771 --> 04:16:23.132]  It was a pretty, pretty vision.
[04:16:24.431 --> 04:16:32.115]  And I come out at night and there's a little lamp post there, and I see the fat little geckos, their little pink bellies eating bugs.
[04:16:32.115 --> 04:16:34.156]  I mean, I like life.
[04:16:34.156 --> 04:16:35.317]  I like human life.
[04:16:35.317 --> 04:16:36.398]  Yeah, I'm not against it.
[04:16:36.398 --> 04:16:40.000]  I'm just saying it gets kind of boring after a while.
[04:16:40.000 --> 04:16:44.202]  Watching fat pink geckos never gets boring.
[04:16:45.097 --> 04:16:49.821]  My dad's got a big telescope and you can, like, 300 yards away look at your neighbor's lamp.
[04:16:49.821 --> 04:16:52.583]  And I'm not trying to look at a naked lady.
[04:16:52.583 --> 04:16:53.323]  We don't want to see that.
[04:16:53.323 --> 04:16:59.408]  We want to see geckos hunting, not knowing they're being watched.
[04:16:59.408 --> 04:16:59.968]  Sounds pretty.
[04:16:59.968 --> 04:17:01.530]  You see how cute they are?
[04:17:01.530 --> 04:17:01.970]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:17:01.970 --> 04:17:04.272]  I've seen little geckos with their little pink feet.
[04:17:04.272 --> 04:17:05.873]  We have like the albino ones around here.
[04:17:05.873 --> 04:17:07.514]  Our cats eat them all the time.
[04:17:07.514 --> 04:17:08.055]  Yeah.
[04:17:08.055 --> 04:17:11.257]  We have to save them because animals are awful.
[04:17:11.257 --> 04:17:12.018]  They kill for fun.
[04:17:13.212 --> 04:17:15.233]  I know I'm boring you talking about pink-bellied geckos.
[04:17:15.233 --> 04:17:16.454]  No, I think it's beautiful.
[04:17:16.454 --> 04:17:17.734]  That's what I wanted to hear.
[04:17:17.734 --> 04:17:20.036]  I wanted to hear joyous Alex Jones stories.
[04:17:20.036 --> 04:17:31.361]  But see, good environmentalism, not killing elephants, not killing whales, not killing creatures that are, you know, higher on the order similar to us, that's why we recognize them and know it's important not to do that.
[04:17:31.361 --> 04:17:34.503]  Educating people and saying no to that and with our choices is important.
[04:17:35.584 --> 04:17:39.368]  And that's all the good stuff they tag on to environmentalism.
[04:17:39.368 --> 04:17:45.855]  What the engine pulling at is cold-hearted banks that want to train us to have all our resources cut off.
[04:17:45.855 --> 04:17:51.602]  So let's just quit, go to Costa Rica and start a banana farm and enough of all this.
[04:17:52.662 --> 04:17:54.523]  Yeah, life of luxury we have.
[04:18:22.902 --> 04:18:26.043]  Started unplugging from, quote, conspiracies and research.
[04:18:26.043 --> 04:18:29.143]  I mean, did it wind down your anxiety level, your concern?
[04:18:29.143 --> 04:18:30.364]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:18:30.364 --> 04:18:32.544]  It definitely did.
[04:18:32.544 --> 04:18:36.225]  Yeah, I live fat and happy most days.
[04:18:36.225 --> 04:18:39.145]  I'm not all that concerned.
[04:18:39.145 --> 04:18:43.066]  Now, I mean, eight years ago, you were doubting me on 9-11 and other things, a little bit more skeptic.
[04:18:43.066 --> 04:18:44.827]  But then I did hear and see some of your videos.
[04:18:44.827 --> 04:18:48.687]  You got, in the last four or five years, a little more, you know, into the conspiracy stuff.
[04:18:48.687 --> 04:18:49.888]  But now you're saying you're getting out of it.
[04:18:49.888 --> 04:18:51.848]  I mean, what woke you up to start looking into it more?
[04:18:52.409 --> 04:19:12.538]  I think the first thing I remember, I don't know if it was Lies My Teacher Taught Me by Lowen, or the Disinfo book you were being lied to, was just mind-blowing to me, with Oklahoma City, the Brigadier General who testified that there was no way an Anfo bomb could create that kind of... The head of Air Force Weapons Development, Ben Parton.
[04:19:12.538 --> 04:19:19.061]  Yeah, and stuff like that was mind-blowing, and then I went from there, and I'd read other books, and I'd watch other videos, and I, you know,
[04:19:20.069 --> 04:19:24.511]  Go to websites and at some point you go, this really has nothing to do with me.
[04:19:24.511 --> 04:19:28.933]  I'm so upset about all these things that I'm not enjoying my life at all.
[04:19:28.933 --> 04:19:31.454]  And a lot of the things that I believe are true.
[04:19:31.454 --> 04:19:38.897]  Once you, Operation Northwoods, again, once you read a document like that, you go, this is, you know, an open declassified document.
[04:19:38.897 --> 04:19:40.497]  Yes, anything's possible.
[04:19:40.497 --> 04:19:47.540]  Anything else you say, I have to give some credibility to that could be true because I've seen enough things that are true.
[04:19:47.540 --> 04:19:48.281]  And, but you go,
[04:19:49.201 --> 04:19:50.181]  You know, I don't care.
[04:19:50.181 --> 04:19:52.562]  Honestly, Alex, I don't care.
[04:19:52.562 --> 04:19:55.543]  It's not affecting me.
[04:19:55.543 --> 04:20:00.405]  But once more people get the attitude, because a lot of people do get into this stuff, and then they pull out.
[04:20:00.405 --> 04:20:01.446]  It overwhelms them.
[04:20:01.446 --> 04:20:01.866]  Yes.
[04:20:01.866 --> 04:20:05.527]  And they kind of get learned helplessness, and they just pull back.
[04:20:05.527 --> 04:20:06.027]  Right.
[04:20:06.027 --> 04:20:07.908]  And a lot of people don't get learned helplessness.
[04:20:07.908 --> 04:20:12.550]  They charge forward and have success, and then it can become destructive because they get too much into it.
[04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:13.810]  I'm working on a book right now.
[04:20:16.511 --> 04:20:18.214]  Well, you haven't given up then!
[04:20:32.654 --> 04:20:35.556]  No, I've given up what you do.
[04:20:35.556 --> 04:20:42.280]  It's like raging against the world, and I've tried to find smaller ways that I can actually make a difference.
[04:20:42.280 --> 04:20:44.102]  When is Armchair Revolutionary coming out?
[04:20:44.102 --> 04:20:45.623]  As soon as I write this stupid thing.
[04:20:45.623 --> 04:20:47.524]  That's a great name, all we've got on the website.
[04:20:47.524 --> 04:20:54.028]  Yeah, well you get to a point where you're, hey, I'm fat and 43, and I'm not gonna go get tear gassed at a WTO, right?
[04:20:54.028 --> 04:20:57.110]  I don't have the nuts that you have.
[04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.971]  Well, I don't always go.
[04:20:58.331 --> 04:21:04.077]  Well, no, but you're out there with your face in it and the bullhorn in the faces of the powers that be.
[04:21:04.077 --> 04:21:06.059]  And most people aren't going to do that.
[04:21:06.059 --> 04:21:12.205]  But there's other ways and other... Well, but I mean, if we do just give up, though, they're going to win for sure.
[04:21:12.205 --> 04:21:15.568]  But I'm glad to hear that you're going to be doing, you know, some things against this.
[04:21:15.568 --> 04:21:21.454]  But the problem is, I think on a lot of fronts, you're going to be the way you see to rebel is actually going to empower the system.
[04:21:21.954 --> 04:21:32.256]  Yeah, that's the problem I find with doing stand-up comedy, is a lot of the bombast that you use to antagonize people or actually divides people.
[04:21:32.256 --> 04:21:37.898]  You know, religious issues, where, you know, screw them, retard, Christian, blah, blah, blah.
[04:21:37.898 --> 04:21:43.519]  And it excites my audience, but there's no communication being made between parties there.
[04:21:44.019 --> 04:21:53.107]  So, I find that... Well, my whole issue is, with the Christianity is, I'm a Christian, I know the real teachings of Christ, versus these corrupt churches.
[04:21:53.107 --> 04:21:55.389]  And so if you see that, I'm not one of those Christians.
[04:21:55.389 --> 04:22:00.453]  I've never heard a Christian say, you know, I'm not a real Christian, I'm one of those Christians.
[04:22:00.453 --> 04:22:02.675]  Everyone thinks they're the real Muslim or the real...
[04:22:03.095 --> 04:22:13.552]  No, but I mean I'm not, but well, I mean there are a lot of real Christians that ended slavery and then there were also fake Christians who bought into African slavery and Arab slavery that was already going on.
[04:22:13.552 --> 04:22:15.315]  So you know the history, but I mean I see
[04:22:16.741 --> 04:22:23.627]  In the balance, I mean, there are a lot of really great Christian people that really see what's going on and have discernment and are fighting evil.
[04:22:23.627 --> 04:22:27.270]  And I think, like Saul of Tarsus, you're going to be knocked off your horse.
[04:22:27.270 --> 04:22:34.617]  And I believe, within the next three years, you are going to have a spiritual awakening and conversion to the fight against the New World Order.
[04:22:34.617 --> 04:22:36.639]  And I want everybody to pray for you, Doug.
[04:22:36.639 --> 04:22:43.525]  I want my listeners and people watching out there to pray that God will show you just how real this universe is and that there's
[04:22:44.105 --> 04:22:47.066]  A lot bigger things out there, and that this life is a test.
[04:22:47.066 --> 04:22:48.186]  Of course it's horrible.
[04:22:48.186 --> 04:22:56.968]  Of course there's bad things going on, but there is a test that God has in store for you, and you're going to step up to the challenge of that test, because I overall think you're a good person in your heart.
[04:22:56.968 --> 04:22:59.868]  I would concur.
[04:22:59.868 --> 04:23:01.889]  I'm definitely a good person.
[04:23:01.889 --> 04:23:04.510]  Say to God, if you're real, show it to me.
[04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:08.210]  Hey, God, leave me alone.
[04:23:08.210 --> 04:23:10.791]  Now see, God, you have to open the door.
[04:23:11.824 --> 04:23:12.985]  Yeah, no, I don't need any.
[04:23:12.985 --> 04:23:21.211]  Okay, if there is, if there is a all-powerful force in the universe, God, don't you, I mean, don't you want to know if it's real?
[04:23:21.211 --> 04:23:22.932]  No, actually I don't.
[04:23:22.932 --> 04:23:28.116]  If there's a, whatever the meaning of this life is, I don't want, that's why I smoked DMT one time.
[04:23:28.116 --> 04:23:30.098]  You don't want to know the secrets of the universe.
[04:23:30.718 --> 04:23:33.040]  Eventually, but I don't want to know them ahead of time.
[04:23:33.040 --> 04:23:36.383]  I don't want to be having to sit in this life knowing what happens afterwards.
[04:23:36.383 --> 04:23:39.205]  If you don't want it now, you're never going to get it, Doug.
[04:23:39.205 --> 04:23:44.329]  If there were a heaven, I wouldn't want to know until I was dead because I wouldn't want to have to sit...
[04:23:46.897 --> 04:23:50.339]  I wouldn't want to have to sit on this planet waiting to get to heaven.
[04:23:50.339 --> 04:23:58.884]  Again, it's a joke I used to do, but if you really believe in such an eternal bliss in the afterlife, why are you still wearing a seatbelt?
[04:23:58.884 --> 04:24:00.265]  Wouldn't you be in a hurry to get there?
[04:24:00.265 --> 04:24:02.886]  Well, no, it's the journey here in this life.
[04:24:02.886 --> 04:24:04.828]  If it's better, why would you want to be here?
[04:24:04.828 --> 04:24:10.611]  Doug Stanhope, it's good seeing you after all these years, and I still want people to pray for you.
[04:24:10.611 --> 04:24:11.812]  There's still hope for you yet.
[04:24:13.206 --> 04:24:14.006]  I'll wait.
[04:24:14.006 --> 04:24:16.009]  You think that's patronizing?
[04:24:16.009 --> 04:24:18.612]  No, no, I think it's... I'm concerned about you, Doug.
[04:24:18.612 --> 04:24:22.636]  I feel pretty good.
[04:24:22.636 --> 04:24:25.339]  I love you and I care about you and God loves you.
[04:24:25.339 --> 04:24:29.664]  I love your fight, I love your passion, I love your intellect, and I love your show.
[04:24:30.310 --> 04:24:31.771]  Well, we appreciate you coming in.
[04:24:31.771 --> 04:24:32.511]  It was good seeing you.
[04:24:32.511 --> 04:24:34.412]  We'll see you next time you orbit through town.
[04:24:34.412 --> 04:24:35.333]  God bless.
[04:24:35.333 --> 04:24:36.053]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:24:36.053 --> 04:24:37.274]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[04:24:37.274 --> 04:24:39.034]  and back Monday, 11 a.m.
[04:24:39.034 --> 04:24:40.875]  We now rejoin Retransmission.
[04:24:40.875 --> 04:24:42.396]  Infowars.com.
[04:24:42.396 --> 04:24:45.218]  Pure evidence of the controlled demolition of Building 7.
[04:24:45.218 --> 04:24:46.178]  Stay with us.
[04:24:58.155 --> 04:25:01.884]  She came on like a diva, I had to touch her visa...
