[00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:05.223]  We live in a surveillance society.
[00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:07.523]  Why do I have to come down?
[00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:11.404]  Monitor every human being on the planet.
[00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:14.965]  I don't know how they knew all about us.
[00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:20.027]  A big government will take more and more of their rights away from them.
[00:00:21.827 --> 00:00:23.528]  Are you aware, yes or no?
[00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:30.829]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.570]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.294]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:40.695]  We are warned of such a global system.
[00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:45.098]  The great experiment that was once America has been prostituted by special interests.
[00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:50.381]  All they're thinking about is, oh, government, do something, protect me, save us from all of this.
[00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:53.784]  We are living in the last days.
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:01.015]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:51.233]  I don't know.
[00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:09.257]  For all intents and purposes, that's what this is.
[00:03:09.817 --> 00:03:16.938]  Total control, where they can even predict human activity before it happens by tracking your previous activities.
[00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:22.500]  Not just individuals, but groups of people, and it's covered in the film Shadow Government.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.881]  So I want to thank Andre Van Heerden and Jeffrey Grant, or Grant Jeffries, for joining us here today.
[00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.202]  Gentlemen, good to have you on with us.
[00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:32.162]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:32.982]  Thank you.
[00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:35.077]  Where do we start?
[00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.659]  I mean, you wrote the book, Grant Jeffrey.
[00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:46.768]  Break down what the shadow government is, why you have that title, and in a nutshell, what's being built, and then let's go through the film and break down the information in it.
[00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:55.616]  Well, I believe, as a result of twenty-some years of research, that we are very, very close to the imposition of a global government
[00:03:56.207 --> 00:04:00.710]  That none of the citizens of the Western world, in terms of a majority, want.
[00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:12.356]  Every time people have been asked if they want global government, the vast majority love their nation, their history, their culture, language, and they want to keep their things as they are.
[00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:19.800]  The global elitists that desire global government, they know that the only way to introduce this is by stealth.
[00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:23.664]  And they have found that they can go around the U.S.
[00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:26.727]  Constitution, which is one of the major impediments.
[00:04:27.247 --> 00:04:28.228]  The founders of the U.S.
[00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:39.876]  Constitution were brilliant men that were very afraid that America needed to stay out of European entanglements and wars, and they made the Constitution very hard to change.
[00:04:40.517 --> 00:04:43.719]  But the lawyers in Congress found that there was a loophole.
[00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:53.591]  That according to the Constitution, if there is an international treaty signed by the President and 67-plus Senators, that takes precedence over the U.S.
[00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:56.151]  Constitution if there is a conflict.
[00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:10.554]  And so they began using treaties like the World Trade Organization in 95 signed by Clinton, a 2,000-page treaty that effectively robbed the United States of its economic independence and trade policies.
[00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:15.654]  Only one senator out of a hundred, Alex, actually read the treaty.
[00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:20.122]  Most of them have a one, eight and a half by eleven page summary.
[00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:28.201]  And based on that, the vast majority of them voted for this, which effectively put America's hands in handcuffs.
[00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:34.786]  Economically, they cannot respond to unfair trade practices, for example, from China.
[00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:37.608]  Otherwise, all the other nations will retaliate.
[00:05:38.128 --> 00:05:43.692]  America, though it's the leading economy in the world, has the same voting power as Haiti or Uganda.
[00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:44.413]  One vote.
[00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:48.036]  So we're outnumbered by people who do not share our
[00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:53.629]  Free enterprise policies are pluralism of religion and politics, etc.
[00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.737]  The next thing is these global elitists.
[00:05:57.635 --> 00:05:59.615]  Think of themselves as global citizens.
[00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:03.416]  They no longer think of themselves as Americans or French or German.
[00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:21.780]  They, I'm not suggesting that they're all evil individuals, but rather they believe that in a world with 200 plus sovereign nations and weapons of mass destruction that are widely available, inevitably they will be used and there will be a third world war and genocide.
[00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.139]  The only solution they can think of is a global government that would eliminate nations and their ability to go to war.
[00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:38.892]  Which just so happens to be authoritarian and I was playing in the background for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers a short clip of a census worker coming up and marking your GPS point
[00:06:39.392 --> 00:06:48.774]  Yes, I think that we were able to convey with Andre's help and direction the real truth that what is happening behind the scenes is our politicians are ceding our national independence, our constitutional independence,
[00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:14.032]  These people believe that global government is the solution to avoid a third world war as one of their motives.
[00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:24.938]  You and I both know that the history of the planet shows that civil wars are by far the worst type of war, whether the American Civil War, whether we look at the Russian Civil War.
[00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:28.499]  And there's going to be civil wars against this global government because it's authoritarian.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.182]  Even in the words of the Financial Times of London, they endorse an authoritarian system.
[00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:38.184]  Meanwhile, the globalists always hand out weapons to other countries and actually stir up the conflicts.
[00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:44.865]  And internal memorandums like State Department memorandum 200, they talk about starting wars to reduce population.
[00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.406]  So I, at the top, they're pure evil.
[00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:55.508]  I agree they have a lot of useful idiots that support them at the governmental and academic and corporate level, believing in the propaganda.
[00:07:55.968 --> 00:08:01.689]  Right, and what I point out in both the documentary and the book, with very ample source citation,
[00:08:02.527 --> 00:08:04.150]  There are three major groups.
[00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.775]  The Bilderberger group, who call themselves internally the Alliance.
[00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:11.861]  Primarily European, royal, as well as multinational leaders.
[00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:16.248]  Incredibly wealthy people who want world government.
[00:08:16.903 --> 00:08:22.888]  Then you've got the group, the Council of Foreign Relations, that is primarily American, with about 3,000 members.
[00:08:23.388 --> 00:08:38.821]  And then you have a trilateral commission that was formed by Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski, his security advisor, back in the 70s, which basically has representatives from both Asia and from Europe and from North America.
[00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:40.062]  All three groups.
[00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:47.730]  Absolutely are aiming toward global government by stealth, by international treaties, and by other means.
[00:08:48.290 --> 00:09:01.938]  These individuals have set an agenda which they know the public does not support, and so they're introducing it step by step without people being fully aware that we're ceding our national independence and our representative government.
[00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:05.600]  I really point out that the European Union, with 27 nations,
[00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:26.057]  Is really an executive commission of appointed individuals who make decisions behind locked doors and the so-called European Parliament is nothing more than a high school debating society because all the power is exercised by 27 appointed people and there's no remedy.
[00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.159]  There's nothing an individual can do.
[00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:29.040]  Well they admit that.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.801]  I mean when Obama became the first U.S.
[00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.003]  president to be president and the head of the U.N.
[00:09:33.023 --> 00:09:34.624]  Security Council, CNN said
[00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:38.629]  This is the ultimate level of power in the global government.
[00:09:38.989 --> 00:09:41.352]  This is the only group that has any power in the UN.
[00:09:41.772 --> 00:09:47.239]  And all of those individuals are Bilderberg Group members or members of the regional roundtable groups.
[00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.541]  And Carol Quigley, as you know, wrote a whole book about this.
[00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:50.362]  He worked for them.
[00:09:51.183 --> 00:09:51.604]  900 pages.
[00:09:51.664 --> 00:09:52.444]  Tragedy and Hope.
[00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:53.786]  Breaking it all down.
[00:09:54.827 --> 00:10:05.370]  My listeners are aware of this true global architecture, and of course the film covers that, but you also break down how they plan to implement their control and surveillance over the population.
[00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:11.352]  We're going to go to break in a moment, but I want to go to Andre Van Heerden, the director and producer for a moment.
[00:10:12.552 --> 00:10:16.794]  What do you think is most important in the film Shadow Government, the masterpiece that you've produced?
[00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:23.916]  I have to say right off the top that when I approached this topic and was talking to Grant, I was approaching it as a skeptic.
[00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:27.127]  I was looking at a lot of the stuff about the conspiracy theory.
[00:10:27.187 --> 00:10:28.627]  I didn't believe a lot of it was true.
[00:10:28.647 --> 00:10:31.088]  I thought there was nuggets of truth maybe buried within it.
[00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:52.855]  But as I started doing the research and working with Grant and looking at his book and started interviewing the various people you mentioned, some Dr. Kasson Albrecht, Daniel Estulin, Richard Griffin, Edward G. Griffin, sorry, the information that was coming out and the evidence, the support evidence for all this, the documentation for all this, made it
[00:10:53.604 --> 00:10:55.705]  No, implicitly clear that this was true.
[00:10:56.226 --> 00:10:58.027]  Yeah, this is an open conspiracy.
[00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:08.753]  That's what's so frustrating is they're announcing world government on the nightly news and then next they cut to the Southern Poverty Law Center saying these Tea Party people are dangerous, they're delusional, they believe in a global government.
[00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:20.402]  And what you just said is the most striking thing about the documentary is that if you don't believe in it, suddenly you look at the headlines of your newspaper and exactly what the documentary is talking about is right there.
[00:11:20.422 --> 00:11:21.663]  It's all right in front of you.
[00:11:22.003 --> 00:11:24.364]  And I think people are really getting the sense that it is there.
[00:11:24.424 --> 00:11:29.247]  Even if they think it's a conspiracy theory, they can look in the world around them and say, yeah, you know what?
[00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:30.168]  I know I'm being correct.
[00:11:30.268 --> 00:11:30.488]  Yes?
[00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:35.158]  I know all my financial transactions are being tracked and monitored.
[00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.419]  I know this is all happening.
[00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:38.360]  That's what makes it so scary and so true.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.123]  And then you look at the research of the terror attacks in the U.S.
[00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:51.029]  and other countries, and you find out the NSA, every time, bare minimum, knew exactly what was happening, and let it take place, like the case of the underwear bomber.
[00:11:51.729 --> 00:11:53.671]  Again, this surveillance cuts two ways.
[00:11:54.031 --> 00:11:57.654]  We'll be right back with the makers of the film Shadow Government.

[00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:03.560]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:09.108]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:14:09.288 --> 00:14:09.708]  I get it.
[00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:19.201]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:20.603]  That's not what's happening.
[00:14:20.863 --> 00:14:29.110]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.593]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:14:32.713 --> 00:14:36.797]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:14:36.997 --> 00:14:38.558]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:41.841]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:46.165]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:47.066]  You should too.
[00:14:47.247 --> 00:14:48.228]  Find out what they know.
[00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:51.293]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:51.694]  Free.
[00:14:51.714 --> 00:14:51.754]  800-686-2237.
[00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:52.075]  800-686-2237.
[00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:52.295]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:07.967]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:15:08.067 --> 00:15:13.109]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:15.951]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:21.913]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:30.983]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:38.771]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.
[00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:39.511]  We're good to go.
[00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:14.060]  Grant Jeffrey is our guest.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.741]  He's the writer of the book, Shadow Government, made into the documentary film by Andre Van Heerden.
[00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:21.202]  Both of them are with us.
[00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:29.484]  Again, the film covers so much and consciously gets people to realize how everything we're doing is being tracked and traced.
[00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:34.626]  Continue breaking down other key parts of the film that people need to be made aware of.
[00:16:34.946 --> 00:16:35.506]  Mr. Jeffrey.
[00:16:35.826 --> 00:16:39.527]  Well, one of the aspects that makes Shadow Government a reality
[00:16:40.117 --> 00:17:05.828]  Is that not only do you have this very deeply held agenda by these globalist groups, which, by the way, as an example, the Bilderberg Group, during the 2008 election, back last summer, a year and a half ago, they invited both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to their secret meeting in Virginia, just north of Washington.
[00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:20.147]  And in knowing that one of them, within seven months, would be taking their inauguration as President of the United States, taking an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, domestic and foreign.
[00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:25.921]  And yet, they were invited to attend a secret meeting which they don't talk about.
[00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:40.076]  Part of the rules of the Bilderberger and the other two groups are what's called Chatham House Rules, which mean that no one who goes there by invitation only is allowed to quote anything that is said or identify who said it.
[00:17:40.723 --> 00:17:52.439]  And they were invited to go to this secret meeting, and the planners of that meeting definitely want to bring America down in both its economy, its military, and politically.
[00:17:55.523 --> 00:18:12.669]  You can't publicly say that, and China is the new model where they give tax incentives and everything else to move all our industry over there, and we've got all the phony environmentalists calling for a global government run by the very banks that meet at Bilderberg Group meetings, saying that we will pay our taxes directly to them.
[00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:22.112]  From your research, Mr. Jeffrey, there's no doubt, certainly in my mind, but I want to know from your research, that we are now entering the final phase of open world government.
[00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:27.145]  Absolutely, and I found an interesting document that you might find interesting, Alex.
[00:18:27.826 --> 00:18:39.655]  This document was written by the Council of the Club of Rome, and it was published in 1993 in a booklet called The First Global Revolution, and in fact is on the Internet.
[00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:41.456]  Someone can look it up if they want.
[00:18:41.797 --> 00:18:42.517]  Here's a quote.
[00:18:43.298 --> 00:18:48.802]  It says, quote, In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, meaning the globalists,
[00:18:49.372 --> 00:18:56.615]  We came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming and water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill.
[00:18:57.256 --> 00:19:05.059]  In their totality and their interactions, these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.742]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention and natural processes.
[00:19:10.162 --> 00:19:13.904]  It's only through changed attitudes and behaviors that they can be overcome.
[00:19:14.284 --> 00:19:17.425]  The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.
[00:19:18.146 --> 00:19:19.026]  Now that's chilling.
[00:19:19.474 --> 00:19:48.622]  Because that means that back in 1993, the globalists identified man's natural love of Earth and the environment as a way to achieve their real goal, which is an incredible socialistic control of nations, companies, and individual activity, and to also achieve it on a global level and do it by stealth, appealing to something which they would emphasize and exaggerate so that people would
[00:19:49.224 --> 00:19:55.008]  We're willing to take any type of restriction whatsoever and taxes to achieve saving of the planet.
[00:19:55.209 --> 00:20:05.156]  And this is the underlying real motive that I have found in the research that I have been doing that is pushing the exaggerated danger of global warming.
[00:20:05.678 --> 00:20:10.901]  And they chose carbon dioxide, the life-giving gas, because that's what humans exhale.
[00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:21.167]  And now we have video from just two weeks ago of Bill Gates saying, here are humans, they put out carbon dioxide, we have to get rid of at least half of them.
[00:20:21.507 --> 00:20:23.389]  The UN in their document says 80%.
[00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:32.234]  Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the head climatologist at NASA says the global taxes are meant to destroy our industrial economy.
[00:20:32.854 --> 00:20:40.438]  I mean, this is a very dangerous group who have control of the issuance of currency and credit, and they don't want a free market.
[00:20:40.478 --> 00:20:41.839]  They don't want us living well.
[00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:49.163]  They want us poor and under their control, and they proposed three months ago at Copenhagen a global one-child policy.
[00:20:49.663 --> 00:20:55.847]  And that's why shadow government is so important, because it shows we are under a global shadow government, now coming out of the shadows.
[00:20:56.627 --> 00:21:14.334]  Through the G20, announcing that later this year, early next year, they're going to set up a global constitution of the banks, the private central banks, setting up a global government publicly, even above the UN, that we will pay our carbon taxes to, and it's here!
[00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:18.955]  And we have to warn people, and that's why the film Shadow Government is so important.
[00:21:18.975 --> 00:21:21.436]  We've got a long segment coming up, so we won't have these interruptions.
[00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:22.797]  When we come back, I want to get
[00:21:24.017 --> 00:21:35.880]  The director and producer's take on what we're discussing, Andre Van Heerden, and of course we've got Grant Jeffrey on the line with us, the writer of the book that this became a film, also the host of Shadow Government.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, you may be awake out there.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.241]  A lot of you more awake than I am.
[00:21:43.381 --> 00:21:51.043]  The point is, the public's now ready to be awakened, and films like Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, and Shadow Government are the tools to get out to the people.
[00:21:52.389 --> 00:21:53.349]  We're on the march.
[00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:55.390]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.091]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.432 --> 00:22:05.673]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:05.973 --> 00:22:06.593]  Number one.
[00:22:06.893 --> 00:22:10.054]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:10.315 --> 00:22:10.875]  Number two.
[00:22:11.175 --> 00:22:15.736]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:16.056 --> 00:22:16.516]  It's true.
[00:22:16.817 --> 00:22:21.358]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:21.678 --> 00:22:22.219]  Number 3.
[00:22:22.499 --> 00:22:25.782]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:26.082 --> 00:22:29.785]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:30.005 --> 00:22:30.546]  Number 4.
[00:22:30.806 --> 00:22:33.168]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:33.568 --> 00:22:36.951]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:37.452]  Number 5.
[00:22:38.012 --> 00:22:41.934]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:42.154 --> 00:22:46.937]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:47.217 --> 00:22:51.259]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:25:05.874 --> 00:25:07.816]  Who is watching The Watchers?
[00:25:08.237 --> 00:25:12.341]  That's the question they ask in the film Shadow Government.
[00:25:12.781 --> 00:25:15.244]  And more importantly, who are The Watchers?
[00:25:15.504 --> 00:25:16.365]  What are they building?
[00:25:17.406 --> 00:25:19.088]  What type of society do they want?
[00:25:19.969 --> 00:25:24.493]  Their program is public, but it is horrifying once you research it.
[00:25:25.606 --> 00:25:29.388]  But we have a responsibility to face this and stand up against it.
[00:25:29.408 --> 00:25:32.630]  The film also has a Spanish language option.
[00:25:33.751 --> 00:25:35.732]  It's available again at Infowars.com.
[00:25:35.792 --> 00:25:36.733]  Shadow government.
[00:25:37.782 --> 00:25:43.566]  It's available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:46.488]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:50.791]  The best place to show this is to your churches.
[00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.893]  We need to get the churches in America awake to this Big Brother grid.
[00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:57.275]  I mean, they're saying they want to implant us with microchips.
[00:25:57.295 --> 00:25:59.477]  They're putting RFID in most of the products now.
[00:25:59.817 --> 00:26:01.018]  They're tracking everything.
[00:26:01.478 --> 00:26:07.602]  I mean, this is literally what was envisioned on the Isle of Patmos, but most churches aren't discussing it.
[00:26:07.922 --> 00:26:14.707]  And you got Pat Robertson saying, biometrics, thumb printing is fine, naked body scanners are good, Obama's of the Lord.
[00:26:15.768 --> 00:26:18.009]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is sick.
[00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.911]  And the great delusion is upon the people right now.
[00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:22.893]  Shadow government exposes it.
[00:26:23.273 --> 00:26:27.656]  Okay, going back to Andre Van Heerden and of course Grant Jeffery.
[00:26:28.617 --> 00:26:32.379]  Andre, again, I've heard this story a million times.
[00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:34.961]  I mean literally, just callers, emails.
[00:26:35.402 --> 00:26:37.183]  People think we're making this stuff up.
[00:26:38.783 --> 00:26:50.053]  They think that Catherine Albrecht's making it up, or G. Edward Griffin, or Daniel Esselstyn in your film, until they actually look at the statements and publications of the government, of the elites, and what's being built.
[00:26:50.073 --> 00:26:52.155]  I mean, what was the process like for you?
[00:26:52.315 --> 00:26:55.538]  You get approached, because you're already a successful filmmaker in your own right,
[00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:07.965]  The author of the book that this film is based on, Grant R. Jeffrey, and, I mean, what was the process like?
[00:27:08.205 --> 00:27:10.065]  You thought it was conspiracy theory at first.
[00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:13.727]  How long did it take you to have a crash course in reality?
[00:27:14.477 --> 00:27:17.399]  Actually, it's a bit of a backward scenario for us.
[00:27:17.619 --> 00:27:25.906]  We had worked with Grant Jeffery 15 years ago on a documentary called Final Warning, which looked at a lot of the same things in Shadow Government.
[00:27:25.986 --> 00:27:39.075]  Now, very tellingly, 15 years ago, when we produced Final Warning, and we were talking to the cast and the crew, and when we were marketing it, we kept being told, well, you know, this stuff isn't really true, and so what if someone's watching me?
[00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:40.076]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:42.358]  That happened time after time after time.
[00:27:43.322 --> 00:27:48.704]  Suddenly, 15 years later, the same sort of material, you look at it, and say, you know what?
[00:27:49.284 --> 00:27:50.105]  We were dead on.
[00:27:50.165 --> 00:27:56.247]  Everything that we had said was going to happen in Final Warning has already happened, faster than we thought was going to happen.
[00:27:56.607 --> 00:27:59.809]  And now, when we're producing Shadow Government, everyone's paying attention.
[00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:04.410]  So, we were aware of Grant's book, Shadow Government, and thought, you know what?
[00:28:04.751 --> 00:28:13.094]  We're a feature film company, we're best known for producing the Left Behind series of films, but we wanted to get back to our roots of doing a documentary, particularly because
[00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:14.402]  I don't know.
[00:28:30.174 --> 00:28:31.575]  Um, we could verify.
[00:28:32.175 --> 00:28:33.755]  And, you know, that's a big thing.
[00:28:33.815 --> 00:28:37.316]  I'm a former journalist, and so I'm always looking for background sources.
[00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:40.537]  So, you know, backup sources so I can say, yes, no, this is true.
[00:28:40.937 --> 00:28:44.899]  Now, the very best source of information is what you call an antagonistic witness.
[00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:52.201]  Someone who is not on your political side, someone who doesn't really like where you're going with the information, yet they will confirm what you're saying.
[00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:58.643]  Well, you go to the UN documents, you go to the Council on Foreign Relations documents, you go to the very source,
[00:28:59.202 --> 00:29:00.543]  Well, let's cut to the chase.
[00:29:00.563 --> 00:29:01.484]  We know this is real.
[00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:02.405]  We've researched it.
[00:29:02.425 --> 00:29:03.586]  We've got to educate the public.
[00:29:03.606 --> 00:29:05.828]  The public is now ready to receive this information because
[00:29:20.546 --> 00:29:30.171]  We're so deep in this system now, but imagine what Hitler or Stalin or Mao or Pol Pot would have done with a cashless society.
[00:29:30.591 --> 00:29:41.196]  The power it gives the system to track everything you do, to be able to turn your card off, to turn your biometric scan off, to record your naked body in the body scanners and have a 360 biometric scan.
[00:29:43.027 --> 00:29:55.175]  Let's break down from your research what a totalitarian system can do once they fully get us on a cashless system, which they're now moving towards demonizing cash.
[00:29:55.195 --> 00:29:56.556]  A lot of places won't accept cash.
[00:29:56.896 --> 00:30:00.359]  Even if you go buy food, they still want to see an ID card in many places.
[00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:02.000]  We're being indoctrinated.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.401]  They're shutting down the family farms and ranches.
[00:30:04.922 --> 00:30:06.323]  Grant, Jeffrey, get into that.
[00:30:07.003 --> 00:30:12.707]  Well, we're already about 98% cashless, and there are some northern European countries where cash
[00:30:13.123 --> 00:30:15.178]  It is really seen as an anachronism.
[00:30:16.618 --> 00:30:20.941]  For example, I have a computer ring called an iRing.
[00:30:21.442 --> 00:30:40.016]  It has a computer chip inside it with a credit, and you rather than pay for a subway, a train, a bus, you just simply touch that iRing that you wear as a ring, or you can have like a key fob on a child's book pack, and you just touch it to the screen, and instantly they withdraw the amount of money.
[00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:44.740]  But now there's a complete computer record of how long you were on that subway,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.161]  Who else was in that subway car with you?
[00:30:47.702 --> 00:30:52.905]  And the tracking technology that comes with this type of technology is phenomenal.
[00:30:53.525 --> 00:31:06.533]  For example, after 1948, the English-speaking victors of World War II, Britain, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, decided to do something that had never been done before in intelligence.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.221]  Well, they still have the James Bond cloak and dagger spies.
[00:31:10.761 --> 00:31:29.308]  They created a new type of system which would be an electronic vacuum cleaner that would listen and record on hard drives every single radio and telephone conversation, every fax, then with the introduction of personal computers, every email, and now all of your internet surfing.
[00:31:29.986 --> 00:31:40.417]  Because it's so vast, there's obviously not enough human listeners to monitor this stuff, and frankly, they're not interested in your conversation discussing, you know, yesterday's movie.
[00:31:40.877 --> 00:31:45.602]  But what they do is they use the tremendous computer technology
[00:31:46.062 --> 00:31:47.283]  We're good to go.
[00:32:07.524 --> 00:32:11.867]  And that's 25 years old with the Echelon keyword, but it's a lot worse than that.
[00:32:12.087 --> 00:32:36.361]  They now admit that they're able to predict off your cell phone travel where you move, patterns you have, up to 93%, it's actually much worse, and to literally begin to predict mass movements of society and predict the future and test their propaganda on the media and see if people are buying it in their private emails, phone calls, and it's all crunched into giant graphs and data.
[00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:42.866]  And then if they want to zoom in and say, have your recorded voice, they then have computer programs that can copy your voice.
[00:32:43.607 --> 00:32:46.950]  Now, most of the toll roads, you don't pay with a swipe or even a tracker chip.
[00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.571]  They read your license plates.
[00:32:48.631 --> 00:32:51.174]  They track you in real time on the roads.
[00:32:51.854 --> 00:32:57.419]  The public schools and the government are dialing in, watching people over their laptops, even at home.
[00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:58.380]  That's now admitted.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.201]  And in states like California,
[00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:10.748]  Over a million government bureaucrats, police and others are exempt from the license plate camera tickets and things and are literally above the law.
[00:33:11.028 --> 00:33:18.213]  So we also, as one of the Rockefellers told Aaron Russo, we cover this in my film Reflections and Warnings, they said, look, we're all going to have a chip.
[00:33:18.693 --> 00:33:22.277]  And my chip will say, basically, I'm above the law because I'm an elitist.
[00:33:22.597 --> 00:33:23.238]  And that's the thing.
[00:33:23.258 --> 00:33:27.963]  These private globalists are building this private corporate world government and they are exempt.
[00:33:28.003 --> 00:33:28.984]  It's like in the EU.
[00:33:29.265 --> 00:33:33.449]  The EU bureaucrats, the rest of the EU is paying over 50% income tax.
[00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:34.110]  They pay 17%.
[00:33:35.231 --> 00:33:39.155]  I mean, it's just, it's an absolute class system.
[00:33:39.963 --> 00:33:49.227]  Well, you're right, Alex, and one of the things the natural person who's an innocent, law-abiding, Christian, church-going person would say, well, look, I live an honest life.
[00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:56.110]  I do not break the law if you don't count speeding, and therefore, why should I really be worried, even if what you're saying is true?
[00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.311]  You're who they don't like!
[00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:58.451]  You're who they don't like!
[00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:03.834]  They want to track you, understand you, they want to raise the taxes until you rebel and bring a police state in.
[00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:04.194]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:04.434 --> 00:34:13.342]  That's not only that, but let's say, while they're recording all this stuff, and, you know, no one's really personally listening to this, it's all going into the computers.
[00:34:13.722 --> 00:34:18.426]  But let's say your son applies for a high security position with the military, the government, a bank.
[00:34:19.027 --> 00:34:27.554]  Then, and at that point, they then go back and look at his family and friends and associates, and they do an instantaneous search of all the communications.
[00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:29.419]  Including your internet surfing.
[00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:37.745]  Well, Alex, if I know all of your phone calls and your emails, and I know all of your internet surfing, I know more about you than your spouse or your parents.
[00:34:38.205 --> 00:34:49.774]  Because by our internet surfing, we reveal our religious, political, sexual preferences, we reveal our... the books we read, the magazines we're interested in, we reveal our whole life.
[00:34:50.314 --> 00:35:02.491]  When we expose our internet surfing, I talk about these social networking sites, the sites that are out there, Facebook and Twitter, and I point out that young people especially
[00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:22.789]  You know, a girl, for example, I used the illustration, a 16-year-old girl tells her 57 best friends on Facebook about this wonderful Christmas romance with a 22-year-old college senior, and they had underage sex and underage drinking, perhaps some illegal substances, and she thinks nothing of it.
[00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:26.632]  Six years later, she's going for the dream job of her life.
[00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:34.295]  And all of a sudden, they don't call her back anymore because as a final thing, Human Resources went back and did a check.
[00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:40.837]  And once you put something on the internet, or in an email, or in a phone call, it cannot be erased.
[00:35:40.917 --> 00:35:44.699]  It's a computer data shadow that will follow you the rest of your life.
[00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:47.600]  And let's expand on that, because you're now hitting at the very heart of it.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.621]  And that's what shadow government covers and why it's so important.
[00:35:51.465 --> 00:35:52.646]  Take three years ago.
[00:35:52.826 --> 00:36:06.213]  The air marshals, the head of their union in Colorado came out and said we're ordered every month with a quota to put innocent people on a list to create the illusion of security threats to get more funding.
[00:36:06.693 --> 00:36:16.058]  If a five-year-old takes a photo with their camera or an old woman does it or you order a vegetarian meal there's over a million, two hundred thousand people on the no-fly list.
[00:36:16.338 --> 00:36:17.399]  No judge, no jury.
[00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:19.260]  They're now saying they want to put
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.061]  You can't buy a gun.
[00:36:21.561 --> 00:36:24.883]  If you're on the no-fly list, they have these criminal databases.
[00:36:25.123 --> 00:36:26.964]  There's all sorts of corruption of the data.
[00:36:27.204 --> 00:36:30.586]  They've been caught putting fake data into the systems.
[00:36:31.107 --> 00:36:33.388]  And there's no judge, no jury, no review.
[00:36:33.628 --> 00:36:35.489]  You can't find out why you're on the list.
[00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:38.411]  This is an incredible discriminatory system.
[00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:52.137]  But, oh, they've got you all worried about, let's not profile people with turbines to then sell everyone being violated and discriminated against whenever they want because the corporate Borg beast machine says so.
[00:36:52.978 --> 00:36:57.220]  And then meanwhile, the NSA can also track when good cops, good military, good police
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.565]  Are aware of government drug dealing, child trafficking, sex trafficking, money laundering.
[00:37:04.005 --> 00:37:09.850]  It comes out they use NSA to actually block real investigations of the Global Corporate Crime Syndicate.
[00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:18.738]  So this is the criminal's surveillance network to make sure they stay safe and no one gets on to them or no journalist ever gets on to them.
[00:37:18.998 --> 00:37:19.939]  They can shut them down.
[00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:43.771]  One of the most amazing things that's happened in the last few months, Alex, is that on December 17th, the President of the United States signed an executive order which has the force of law, which immunizes Interpol, the international police organization representing 157 nations, including such wonderful supporters of law such as Russia,
[00:37:44.546 --> 00:37:58.577]  And this organization can now operate inside the borders of the United States to arrest people, to do rendition or anything else, and it is no longer subject to congressional oversight.
[00:37:59.395 --> 00:38:00.196]  We're good to go.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.826]  Yeah, they're giving diplomatic immunity, and under diplomatic immunity, all these groups have been caught.
[00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:26.549]  Narcotics, child kidnapping, snuff films.
[00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:29.912]  I mean, this is, the global government is run by criminals.
[00:38:30.533 --> 00:38:41.163]  And, I mean, do you get my point, that this is actually their, it's not just to surveil us, it's to protect themselves, and to find out who's good in government and who's bad, so they can promote the bad people.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:56.369]  Well, I'll point out that even in a dangerous world in which obviously our governments would be remiss in their responsibilities if they did not try to use technology to find the terrorists and find the criminals, etc.
[00:38:56.849 --> 00:39:10.497]  However, such incredible power, unprecedented in human history, a population surveillance system that Hitler or Stalin would have given their left arm for, cannot be able to operate with impunity and immunity
[00:39:11.207 --> 00:39:19.194]  And the watchers need to be watched by a genuine democratic oversight, but that, in fact, is not happening.
[00:39:19.355 --> 00:39:21.897]  And now they're expanding it with a cyber security takeover.
[00:39:22.938 --> 00:39:26.161]  Run through the film, going to the director and producer.
[00:39:26.561 --> 00:39:33.708]  Run through the film in somewhat of a chronological order, just the basics that people will discover and learn in it.
[00:39:34.554 --> 00:39:39.055]  There are four main sections, and it's great the way they all kind of interrelate.
[00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:46.476]  The first section is really looking at surveillance technologies, new surveillance technologies, how you're being monitored, how you're being tracked.
[00:39:47.057 --> 00:39:53.918]  And we give lots of examples of what's currently in place, what is just on the drawing board, what is coming down the line towards us.
[00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:58.899]  And it gives great evidence, great examples of all that sort of technology and what's
[00:39:59.324 --> 00:40:08.246]  Around today, we asked a few of the people, if you want to live off the grid, if you wanted no one to be able to track, monitor things that you're doing today, what would you have to do?
[00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:11.908]  And every single one basically answered, you'd have to live naked in the forest.
[00:40:12.128 --> 00:40:13.388]  It's literally to that extent.
[00:40:14.068 --> 00:40:17.669]  The next section, that's the first section, surveillance and tracking capabilities.
[00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:20.850]  The next section is looking at how those technologies
[00:40:21.343 --> 00:40:22.684]  Effective rights and freedom.
[00:40:22.844 --> 00:40:24.744]  What is happening to our right to privacy?
[00:40:24.844 --> 00:40:27.905]  What is happening to our freedom of speech, freedom of free expression?
[00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:28.946]  Those sorts of things.
[00:40:29.046 --> 00:40:29.946]  The double standard.
[00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:35.808]  If you happen to be a Christian or a Jew, what is happening to your right to freedom?
[00:40:36.228 --> 00:40:38.609]  What has already happened with your right to privacy?
[00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:40.790]  Basically already out the window.
[00:40:41.724 --> 00:40:46.126]  We then look at, okay, you have your technologies that are monitoring and tracking you.
[00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:49.568]  You have your erosions of rights and freedom.
[00:40:49.628 --> 00:40:50.709]  Who's behind all this?
[00:40:50.849 --> 00:40:55.831]  And we really look at the global government, the institutions that are already in place.
[00:40:55.931 --> 00:41:03.015]  You mentioned some of the people with all the money and all the power from the media that are controlling all this.
[00:41:03.075 --> 00:41:06.757]  You have the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:41:07.418 --> 00:41:08.078]  I don't
[00:41:21.718 --> 00:41:22.519]  I'm a Christian.
[00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:22.979]  You're a Christian.
[00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:56.591]  But the issue here is if we can get this message to Christians, who are the majority of this nation, that will be a powerful force to say no to this big brother that's bad for everybody.
[00:41:57.152 --> 00:42:06.978]  And even if you don't believe in God in all this, and some people are deceived and foolish, no one can disagree that all this surveillance is being used to hurt people and to control
[00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:17.749]  And we know now that the establishment's coming out with all the surveillance and admitting more of it because they've already gone way down the road past what we even know they're currently doing.
[00:42:18.757 --> 00:42:25.860]  And so the Federal Circuit Court, 9th Circuit, two weeks ago ruled police can search your house without a warrant or probable cause.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.221]  There's all these other rulings against freedom.
[00:42:28.721 --> 00:42:32.702]  They now want to come out with all the surveillance and openly use it in court.
[00:42:33.163 --> 00:42:37.004]  And so that's why they're having rulings for warrantless wiretapping of citizens.
[00:42:37.424 --> 00:42:38.465]  The list goes on and on.
[00:42:38.525 --> 00:42:40.325]  Gentlemen, stay there.
[00:42:41.006 --> 00:42:44.267]  It is so important that we expose this for what it is.
[00:42:44.827 --> 00:42:45.707]  That we reveal it.
[00:42:47.853 --> 00:42:51.196]  Let people know just how dangerous it is and point out it's wrong.
[00:42:51.756 --> 00:42:52.717]  This is America.
[00:42:53.778 --> 00:42:56.800]  And worldwide, we know this is tyranny.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.422]  The film is Shadow Government.

[00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:16.247]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:43:16.588 --> 00:43:17.188]  There is!

[00:44:56.354 --> 00:44:57.195]  Wow.
[00:44:57.535 --> 00:44:58.136]  Maxfit.
[00:44:58.576 --> 00:44:59.257]  Make sure.
[00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:03.670]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:09.076]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:45:09.317 --> 00:45:13.942]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:45:14.342 --> 00:45:14.743]  It's true.
[00:45:14.823 --> 00:45:19.368]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:45:19.907 --> 00:45:24.591]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:27.053]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:32.056]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:45:32.237 --> 00:45:33.137]  And here's the best part.
[00:45:33.357 --> 00:45:36.140]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.742]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:45:40.043 --> 00:45:42.905]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:45:43.245 --> 00:45:45.126]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:45:45.467 --> 00:45:46.387]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.812]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:45:52.993 --> 00:45:58.778]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:45:59.078 --> 00:46:01.400]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:46:15.831 --> 00:46:23.578]  We're going to continue exposing the control grid with Declan McCullough of CNET News breaking down the cyber security bill.
[00:46:23.638 --> 00:46:27.821]  Jason Burmas is going to be in studio with us a little bit going through point after point in the bill.
[00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:33.806]  We're going to look at all the calls for internet censorship because they've gotten the grid in place now.
[00:46:34.207 --> 00:46:37.510]  The whole economy shifted over to wireless and internet and the web.
[00:46:38.897 --> 00:46:41.738]  Now they're coming in with the censorship and the control.
[00:46:42.058 --> 00:46:47.061]  So part two of this whole discussion coming up at the five after when our guests leave us.
[00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:50.262]  We've got about five minutes now and five minutes in the next segment, gentlemen.
[00:46:51.623 --> 00:46:53.964]  Other important points you want to make about shadow government?
[00:46:54.304 --> 00:46:55.844]  How important this message is?
[00:46:56.565 --> 00:46:59.406]  Other parts of the film people should be made aware of and why they need to get it?
[00:47:01.447 --> 00:47:04.248]  Well, I was just saying off air to you, Alex, that
[00:47:05.174 --> 00:47:07.395]  We had some people come over to our house.
[00:47:07.435 --> 00:47:11.057]  They were parents of some of the friends of my daughter.
[00:47:11.717 --> 00:47:17.460]  And they were interested in, you know, my work and things like that, and mentioned that we'd done this documentary called Shadow Government.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.282]  And they were immediately interested because they can see it, as I said, in the headlines.
[00:47:21.302 --> 00:47:22.943]  They can see it all around in their daily lives.
[00:47:22.963 --> 00:47:27.345]  They know they're being monitored and tracked and are obviously interested in how that affects their lives.
[00:47:28.225 --> 00:47:33.129]  But, you know, at the same time, they didn't know that the part of the theme was Bible prophecy.
[00:47:33.169 --> 00:47:39.033]  And oftentimes, when you're talking about Bible prophecy, people will kind of look at you a little differently than they had before.
[00:47:39.713 --> 00:47:44.637]  And so we started playing it, and it got through the opening, which is very gripping.
[00:47:44.657 --> 00:47:51.722]  It immediately dives right into it, and there's this dramatization that shows, you know, this everyday guy going through his life and what's happening to him.
[00:47:52.402 --> 00:47:57.830]  And so then I stopped it, and they all turned to me, and there was about eight of them, all said, don't know, we want to see more, we want to keep going.
[00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.432]  And it was like, this is at a dinner party.
[00:47:59.452 --> 00:48:00.733]  I was like, okay, keep going.
[00:48:01.134 --> 00:48:10.346]  And they were fascinated, and suddenly they were asking questions, which is a wonderful opportunity to share just about anything, because now they're interested in that information.
[00:48:12.082 --> 00:48:13.462]  That's how you wake somebody up.
[00:48:13.502 --> 00:48:17.343]  That's how you unlock their mind to see the wider world.
[00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:22.805]  And as the Bible says over and over again, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:48:24.105 --> 00:48:27.366]  And if we can give people the knowledge, they know something's wrong.
[00:48:27.866 --> 00:48:33.427]  But when they see shadow government, they really start understanding just how serious this is.
[00:48:34.527 --> 00:48:36.728]  Comments from Grant Jeffrey on that point.
[00:48:37.335 --> 00:49:02.912]  Well, one of the things that I point out in my book, my book, and refer to it in the documentary, is in addition to the rather secret but also partly an open conspiracy plan by the global groups to achieve global government and destroy the constitution of free countries like Canada, the United States, there's another aspect and that is the practical preparation for what is called continuity of government.
[00:49:04.356 --> 00:49:16.059]  In this world in which there are weapons of mass destruction and the dangers from both terrorists as well as nation states, any government that does not prepare for the worst would be very, very irresponsible and foolish.
[00:49:16.479 --> 00:49:22.781]  For example, during the inauguration a year ago, one member of the Cabinet, the Defense Secretary,
[00:49:23.562 --> 00:49:24.123]  Robert Gates.
[00:49:24.404 --> 00:49:38.185]  He was in an underground city north of Washington, in Mount Weather, where he was designated to take over the presidency of the United States if the worst happened and the Capitol disappeared with the Supreme Court and Congress and the President.
[00:49:38.857 --> 00:50:00.571]  And governments have to prepare and think this way in such a world, and so one of the things that we noticed as a Canadian observer watching the 2005 Katrina disaster was the absolute appalling lack of organization and preparation by FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has now become part of Homeland Security.
[00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:21.077]  And what I discovered and documented in the book, Shadow Government, is that 96% of the entire $30 billion budget of FEMA was in fact used not for natural disaster relief efforts like Katrina, but was designed for continuity of government with secret bases scattered throughout the United States,
[00:50:21.597 --> 00:50:23.198]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:56.847 --> 00:50:59.592]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:50:59.632 --> 00:51:03.940]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:51:04.949 --> 00:51:09.391]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:40.586]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, final segment with our guest, the Declan McCullough of CNET News, former head of CBS, person for the CBS News website, formerly Washington's top correspondent for Wired Magazine.
[00:52:41.086 --> 00:52:46.550]  He'll be breaking down the control grid coming up with us in the latest on cyber security.

[00:52:49.272 --> 00:52:50.573]  It officially comes out

[00:53:13.248 --> 00:53:15.690]  American Conspiracies with Jesse Ventura.
[00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.852]  He's joining us next week live.

[00:53:21.796 --> 00:53:24.979]  I recommend you get both of them today or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:53:29.867 --> 00:53:37.350]  Now, you were trying to finish up, Grant Jeffrey, with the point about shadow government.
[00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:38.830]  The issue is this.
[00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:48.914]  Throughout the world, dictatorships and tyrannies use their continual government system to circumvent the Congress or the Parliament or the legislative system.
[00:53:49.654 --> 00:53:52.135]  And as you see in the film Valkyrie, a true story about
[00:53:53.035 --> 00:53:53.255]  I don't
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.963]  Uh, saying terrorists did it, and then bringing in the world government.
[00:54:13.243 --> 00:54:20.328]  This is a very dangerous system, and Congress back in the 80s had hearings about how this could be used to take over the legitimate government.
[00:54:20.648 --> 00:54:24.030]  So there's an amazing danger here, and we know what they're doing with all the surveillance.
[00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:24.991]  It's illegal.
[00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:26.752]  It's targeting the American people.
[00:54:26.772 --> 00:54:34.497]  We have the internal homeland security documents that the main focus is Christians, conservatives, libertarians, patriots, returning veterans, gun owners.
[00:54:34.837 --> 00:54:36.539]  This whole system's pointed at us.
[00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:38.440]  We're the number one enemies of the globalists.
[00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:43.131]  Absolutely, Alex, and I think most Americans
[00:54:43.749 --> 00:54:46.930]  ...are woefully ignorant of the fact that under the U.S.
[00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:53.753]  situation, the Constitution never even had a mention of something called executive orders.
[00:54:54.233 --> 00:55:08.438]  Yet executive orders now have been published, and some of them are still secret, that have the force of congressional law, and few Americans realize that the President, by the stroke of a pen, can suspend Congress.
[00:55:08.798 --> 00:55:11.219]  They cannot even vote on it for six months.
[00:55:11.699 --> 00:55:22.208]  And the President can seize all transportation, all civilian labor, all weapons, all energy, in fact, all financial institutions.
[00:55:22.709 --> 00:55:27.433]  And what we're seeing in the takeover of the one-fifth of the U.S.
[00:55:27.473 --> 00:55:33.438]  economy and the health care system after the takeover and control of Wall Street and the bankers and General Motors,
[00:55:33.985 --> 00:56:02.889]  Is that increasingly the government is manifesting a desire to not move in a free enterprise, capitalistic way, but in a managed society with central planning, so that they will, using a variety of pretexts, including the environment, global warming, etc., are literally moving toward a point where they'll tell you what kind of car you can drive, what kind of car will be available, what the thermostat must be set at, and they are creating a propaganda base
[00:56:03.484 --> 00:56:08.290]  Where people are willing to accept these unbelievable restrictions on our freedom.
[00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:10.173]  They're turning us into a prison planet.
[00:56:10.193 --> 00:56:10.894]  We're out of time.
[00:56:10.954 --> 00:56:12.275]  I'm very impressed with the film.
[00:56:12.656 --> 00:56:18.283]  I'm just as impressed with Andre Van Heerden and Grant Jeffrey here on the show with us today.
[00:56:18.644 --> 00:56:20.045]  Gentlemen, I want to invite you back.
[00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:21.066]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:42.915 --> 00:56:46.538]  And next time they're on, we'll talk more about other work that they've done together.
[00:56:46.858 --> 00:56:48.760]  Declan McCullough coming up.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.881]  We only scratched the surface.
[00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:52.523]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:56:52.623 --> 00:56:53.444]  Shadow Government.
[00:56:53.684 --> 00:56:55.445]  Show it to everybody you know.
[00:56:55.805 --> 00:56:56.986]  It's dynamite info.
[00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:58.648]  It's vital to the future of humanity.
[00:57:01.479 --> 00:57:05.721]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:06.642]  Number one.
[00:57:06.942 --> 00:57:10.104]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:10.924]  Number two.
[00:57:11.224 --> 00:57:15.787]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:16.127 --> 00:57:16.567]  It's true.
[00:57:16.867 --> 00:57:21.410]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.271]  Number 3.
[00:57:22.551 --> 00:57:25.854]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:26.135 --> 00:57:29.899]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:30.059 --> 00:57:30.599]  Number 4.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.222]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:33.623 --> 00:57:37.006]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:37.306 --> 00:57:37.507]  Number 5.
[00:57:38.067 --> 00:57:41.988]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:46.990]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:00:22.779 --> 01:00:25.161]  He's one of the head guys over at CNET News.
[01:00:25.601 --> 01:00:29.084]  He's written for Wired Magazine as their Washington bureau chief.
[01:00:30.205 --> 01:00:31.206]  He, of course,
[01:00:33.815 --> 01:00:38.797]  Also has written articles for the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.
[01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:44.099]  He just goes on and on, Playboy Magazine, you name it.
[01:00:44.659 --> 01:00:55.643]  And he's one of the leading experts on the full spectrum of what's happening with the Internet, surveillance, cybersecurity, shutdowns of websites like Cryptome, all these calls for censorship that are going on.
[01:00:55.683 --> 01:00:56.504]  He's been fighting it.
[01:00:56.824 --> 01:00:59.425]  So we're really honored to have him with us for the next 40 minutes or so.
[01:00:59.445 --> 01:01:02.666]  We're going to have Jason Burmess at the 33 After pop in briefly.
[01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:11.829]  With the actual cybersecurity house bill that passed to go over some of the subsections with Declan McCullough for all the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers and of course the radio listeners.
[01:01:12.189 --> 01:01:13.530]  Declan, it's great to have you here with us.
[01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.191]  Hey, it's my pleasure.
[01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:17.972]  Well, a lot's going on obviously.
[01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:20.192]  What should we get into first?
[01:01:20.252 --> 01:01:24.054]  I mean, it looks like they're making their move to start clamping down on the internet.
[01:01:25.267 --> 01:01:35.095]  Well, let's start with what's happening this week, which is probably the largest Internet computer security conference in the world.
[01:01:35.615 --> 01:01:38.818]  It's taking place about a block from where I am here in San Francisco.
[01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:39.738]  It's called RSA.
[01:01:39.758 --> 01:01:42.861]  It's a computer security company with the same name.
[01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:51.347]  And yesterday, you had a White House advisor, Obama's cybersecurity coordinator, called Howard Schmit, speak there about
[01:01:52.468 --> 01:01:56.850]  And you've been at some of these meetings recently?
[01:02:15.851 --> 01:02:20.894]  The background is that two years ago, President Bush signed a secret cybersecurity directive.
[01:02:20.954 --> 01:02:27.337]  It's known as NSPD 54, or National Security Presidential Directive 54.
[01:02:27.457 --> 01:02:30.318]  It's never been released.
[01:02:30.338 --> 01:02:36.541]  The government acknowledged that it exists, but the text has never been made public.
[01:02:36.741 --> 01:02:42.103]  You had Michael Chertoff want to call it a Manhattan Project for the Internet.
[01:02:44.216 --> 01:02:50.780]  It's a multi-billion dollar fund for it as part of a classified intelligence budget.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.503]  I've heard numbers like 30 or 40 billion, which is huge.
[01:02:56.363 --> 01:03:12.973]  And also, one component of it is a network monitoring component called Einstein, which is aimed at monitoring people who go to federal government websites, but there have been concerns about how far that monitoring by the Einstein program goes, and also whether that would be expanded to
[01:03:15.205 --> 01:03:17.526]  Well, remember the Cash for Clunkers program?
[01:03:17.887 --> 01:03:23.550]  You would go to the Cash for Clunkers program and there'd be a message, the federal government has taken over your computer.
[01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:25.491]  It is now owned by them.
[01:03:25.811 --> 01:03:27.652]  We are tracking everything you're doing.
[01:03:27.712 --> 01:03:29.073]  I mean, that really freaked people out.
[01:03:29.674 --> 01:03:31.435]  You do have a good memory for that.
[01:03:32.095 --> 01:03:35.417]  I hadn't even come to mind this time around.
[01:03:35.457 --> 01:03:39.399]  But yeah, what happened is that the government said,
[01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:42.071]  Well, this is a problem.
[01:03:42.111 --> 01:03:43.772]  We won't do this again.
[01:03:44.913 --> 01:03:48.616]  But there's an interesting thing about this.
[01:03:48.896 --> 01:04:01.586]  Yesterday, if you go to whitehouse.gov slash cybersecurity, you'll see a three-page or five-page summary of this secret Bush-era directive.
[01:04:01.686 --> 01:04:09.832]  And the summary says that Obama basically supports what President Bush is doing on cybersecurity, so this is not something that's
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.141]  And that's not a surprise.
[01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:15.283]  He's basically continued everything Bush has done.
[01:04:15.303 --> 01:04:22.030]  There's not a whole lot of bay light between them on many, many, many issues.
[01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:26.354]  There's bailout terrorism and so on.
[01:04:26.374 --> 01:04:30.419]  But on cybersecurity, the interesting thing is that at one point says that
[01:04:34.555 --> 01:04:39.876]  We want to expand the Feinstein program to involve the National Security Agency.
[01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:46.818]  And of course, this is the same NSA that was engaged in warrantless surveillance and might still be engaged in warrantless surveillance.
[01:04:47.558 --> 01:04:56.360]  And the second point is that Homeland Security wants to, quote, extend its cybersecurity into critical infrastructure.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.321]  And that basically means the Internet, because nowadays the government uses the Internet
[01:05:01.844 --> 01:05:25.134]  Yeah, I mean, I have the bill and coming up in 15 minutes we're going to go over it with you, but it talks about going into all of the internet service providers that they have to have a licensed person that's federally approved, that they're going to track what everybody's doing, that you have to basically have their software initiatives in middle school, high school, college, creating an army of cyber security warriors.
[01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.615]  We know the government's surveilling people without warrants.
[01:05:27.635 --> 01:05:28.216]  They're tracking
[01:05:32.699 --> 01:05:39.763]  Well, we can talk about cell phone tracking if you want to change topics.
[01:05:39.963 --> 01:05:40.324]  No, no, no.
[01:05:40.344 --> 01:05:41.585]  Continue with cyber security.
[01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:42.005]  Continue.
[01:05:42.645 --> 01:05:43.946]  Well, we should talk about this.
[01:05:43.966 --> 01:05:46.928]  This is actually probably more interesting than cyber security, but let's continue.
[01:05:52.052 --> 01:06:01.174]  The cyber security plan is the potential for NSA monitoring or Homeland Security slash NSA monitoring of the private sector.
[01:06:01.394 --> 01:06:12.376]  And you had, when this was Bush, and when this was the Bush administration running things at DHS, you had a lot of complaints from members of Congress.
[01:06:12.476 --> 01:06:21.178]  This is probably a partisan issue, but you had folks like, let's see,
[01:06:23.044 --> 01:06:30.628]  You had Barack Obama running around screaming bloody murder about the Patriot Act and warrantless surveillance, and then now that he's in power, he's reauthorized it.
[01:06:32.408 --> 01:06:36.970]  I won't dig into my notes, but let me just state this as facts from memory.
[01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:40.232]  You're listening to Prove Me Wrong.
[01:06:40.272 --> 01:06:48.576]  Back when the Bush folks were doing this, the Democratic Congress was yelling about, you know, there's not enough information about the secret directive.
[01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:49.942]  I don't think so.
[01:07:06.218 --> 01:07:17.306]  And actually, even saying nice things about Bush in this document that the White House posted on the White House website about cybersecurity yesterday, you do not hear any gowing from the Democrats in Congress.
[01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.728]  Maybe it'll happen, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
[01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:27.193]  Anyway, we'll see more about this.
[01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:29.375]  Hold on just a minute, though, so people understand this.
[01:07:30.582 --> 01:07:36.105]  I saw a bunch of headlines today saying White House press release doesn't explain anything.
[01:07:36.725 --> 01:07:38.226]  What are the secret directives?
[01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:51.252]  But then if you read the bill they've passed in the House that's now in the Senate, I mean it's incredibly draconian and you've had cyber security people come out and say it's the Pentagon and Air Force and NSA.
[01:07:51.972 --> 01:08:00.457]  Basically overtaking the internet and putting in the type of snooping hubs they put into the telecommunications systems after the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
[01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:04.800]  So we do know quite a bit of what's going on.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.362]  But do we have any idea of what the secret directive is?
[01:08:09.943 --> 01:08:11.424]  The answer is no.
[01:08:12.105 --> 01:08:17.068]  We only have a few hints from administration members both
[01:08:18.044 --> 01:08:25.889]  Bush and Obama saying that this is the single largest request for funds in last year's classified intelligence budget, for instance.
[01:08:25.929 --> 01:08:26.469]  Now, think of it.
[01:08:26.649 --> 01:08:34.274]  The single largest request for funds in the NSA and the CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency and all these other black organizations
[01:08:35.261 --> 01:08:37.963]  The single largest request funds, this is a lot of money, folks.
[01:08:38.223 --> 01:08:41.024]  And we know virtually nothing about it.
[01:08:41.064 --> 01:08:48.568]  All we have is a very vague summary, and we don't even know if the summary adequately represents what's in the entire document.
[01:08:48.588 --> 01:08:55.751]  I mean, it only might cover 10% of the secret NFPD 54 directive, for instance.
[01:08:55.771 --> 01:09:01.614]  And so, basically, we have a little bit of, we have a tidbit or two from the White House, but we don't have very much information to go on.
[01:09:01.894 --> 01:09:03.515]  Most of it is still secret and classified.
[01:09:04.022 --> 01:09:05.663]  Well, let's expand on that, though.
[01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:12.269]  You know, the biggest classified funding request they put out in the last year.
[01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:21.297]  But separately, we saw congressional hearings two years ago about censoring conspiracy theories and other criticisms of the government on the web.
[01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:32.826]  We see Cass Sunstein, the regulations are, writing public papers saying basically, you know, restrict criticism, restrict global warming conspiracy theories, that it isn't man-made.
[01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:36.433]  Climate Gates, a conspiracy theory, even when it's admitted.
[01:09:37.433 --> 01:09:46.439]  And he talks about cyber armies out posing as alternative media to cause infighting, COINTELPRO type stuff.
[01:09:46.459 --> 01:09:54.425]  So I'm, I mean, we know they've got CENTCOM and others out blogging and writing their own reports and countering quote disinformation on the web.
[01:09:54.905 --> 01:10:00.569]  So I think a lot of evidence points towards this is massive funding, not just for the snooping and control grid,
[01:10:01.629 --> 01:10:09.412]  But also as a way to put more boots on the ground in cyberspace, pushing the establishment line.
[01:10:10.613 --> 01:10:11.273]  It could be.
[01:10:11.293 --> 01:10:12.414]  And this is the problem.
[01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:24.379]  I mean, look, if you're going to defend the federal government network, I mean, what this means is it's the same thing that, say, you know, Google.com or Yahoo.com have to deal with all the time.
[01:10:25.059 --> 01:10:29.521]  People trying to break into the servers and read your Gmail or Yahoo mail.
[01:10:30.117 --> 01:10:35.280]  And you don't need to make how you defend against that secret.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.881]  It doesn't have to be classified.
[01:10:37.381 --> 01:10:42.163]  It doesn't have to be the single largest request for funds in last year's classified intelligence budget.
[01:10:43.929 --> 01:10:51.794]  It's a bit of a mystery about where exactly these tens of billions of dollars are being spent on.
[01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:56.618]  I mean, NASA's budget by comparison is only about $6 billion a year, and that's a lot.
[01:11:02.073 --> 01:11:15.318]  Separately, I mean we have the secret copyright treaty that was leaked a few months ago, and in that they're talking about using all these snooping systems, like John McCain said five years ago, to go in and basically kill your computer.
[01:11:17.178 --> 01:11:28.043]  And this was actually, your memory is good, I think this was actually, it was a bill introduced by Senator Hollings, and maybe McCain was a co-sponsor,
[01:11:29.096 --> 01:11:30.077]  We're good to go.
[01:11:42.972 --> 01:11:44.914]  No judge, no jury, no proof.
[01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:45.575]  They just do it.
[01:11:46.496 --> 01:11:48.538]  Declan McCullough is our amazing guest.
[01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:52.162]  We're going to see if we can get a better connection on his phone and come back.
[01:11:52.422 --> 01:11:53.623]  He writes for CNET News.
[01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.664]  We'll give you that website.
[01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:59.329]  And he's a tireless fighter for freedom and transparency in government.

[01:12:51.526 --> 01:12:53.488]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:12:53.508 --> 01:12:54.729]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:15.028]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:15.788 --> 01:13:21.249]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:21.409 --> 01:13:26.430]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:26.951 --> 01:13:36.573]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.815]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:39.055 --> 01:13:40.376]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:40.636 --> 01:13:42.898]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:43.098 --> 01:13:44.939]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:50.023]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:14:54.286 --> 01:14:54.526]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:54.546 --> 01:14:55.927]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:15:01.613 --> 01:15:04.815]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:15:05.175 --> 01:15:07.016]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:15:07.457 --> 01:15:07.877]  Don't!
[01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.359]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:15:11.779 --> 01:15:18.903]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:15:18.883 --> 01:15:20.544]  's number one debt secret.
[01:15:20.865 --> 01:15:24.527]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:15:24.927 --> 01:15:27.648]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:15:28.068 --> 01:15:35.091]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:36.432]  Herb K was right.
[01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:39.693]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:15:39.813 --> 01:15:40.813]  What have you got to lose?
[01:15:41.153 --> 01:15:44.355]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:48.536]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:15:48.816 --> 01:15:49.096]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:15:53.238 --> 01:15:53.538]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.641]  Declan McCullough is our guest.
[01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:29.402]  We're going to have Jason Bermas in the studio in a moment for about five minutes to go over some of the cybersecurity subsections.
[01:16:29.442 --> 01:16:34.284]  But let's shift gears now, Declan, into all these calls for Internet censorship.
[01:16:34.304 --> 01:16:37.045]  Then we'll get into cell phone tracking that you've been reporting on.
[01:16:37.065 --> 01:16:48.988]  I mean, we're seeing the New York Times call for a kinder, gentler, gate-kept Internet, phasing things over to Internet 2, making you have a license to get online, WebID, worse than Communist China.
[01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:52.851]  Well, we'll see.
[01:16:53.892 --> 01:16:55.153]  Let's put this in perspective.
[01:16:55.573 --> 01:17:00.798]  There have been calls for something akin to an internet driver's license for as long as I can remember.
[01:17:00.818 --> 01:17:15.269]  I remember sitting in a, I think it was a House of Representatives Rayburn building steering room in 1998 when Louis Freeh said, you know, it would be something, it would be nice to be able to attract people online and we could do
[01:17:16.584 --> 01:17:23.346]  Do something like this that might also deter fraud, and more authentication, and security, and all these wonderful words.
[01:17:23.966 --> 01:17:27.828]  But what it amounts to is more surveillance and limiting anonymity.
[01:17:27.848 --> 01:17:44.974]  And we know from even the Supreme Court, which is not always a great protector of civil liberties, that acknowledged in the McIntyre case, I think that was a 1994 case, that Americans do have a right to remain anonymous.
[01:17:47.036 --> 01:17:54.660]  How do you reconcile the right to remain anonymous with the idea for an internet tracking system or driver's license system?
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:06.525]  We heard another mention of this curb on anonymity yesterday here in San Francisco when the White House of Cyber Security's Howard Schmitz said it would be nice to do something like that.
[01:18:07.285 --> 01:18:09.166]  So we've heard this call for a while.
[01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:12.948]  I don't think it's really going to go anywhere just because of the tremendous technical difficulties.
[01:18:13.504 --> 01:18:22.427]  If the government could have controlled the way the Internet developed from early on, it would have been pretty easy for them to do.
[01:18:22.987 --> 01:18:30.809]  But unfortunately for them, folks thought online, millions of people were using it before they came up with this great idea of an Internet driver's license.
[01:18:30.889 --> 01:18:33.450]  I think, technically speaking, it's not going to work.
[01:18:35.854 --> 01:18:37.694]  The point is, though, they're proposing it.
[01:18:37.794 --> 01:18:43.956]  Are you familiar with Cass Sunstein's calls to censor the internet and put taxes on people that criticize the government?
[01:18:44.576 --> 01:18:48.757]  I've read some pieces that he wrote a few years ago.
[01:18:49.017 --> 01:18:57.499]  He seems to be someone who... Let me back up.
[01:18:58.239 --> 01:19:00.399]  I'm not a fan of what he wrote.
[01:19:00.799 --> 01:19:02.480]  I think that he would...
[01:19:03.653 --> 01:19:03.873]  I think?
[01:19:26.425 --> 01:19:30.467]  Bottom line, we've seen Australia call for Chinese style net censorship.
[01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:36.470]  We've seen Italy calling for licenses to get online, passing a bill to do it or to upload video.
[01:19:37.031 --> 01:19:38.592]  Why do we see governments
[01:19:39.639 --> 01:19:41.500]  I don't know if you agree with this, but I clearly see it.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:54.886]  Calling for more and more controls over the internet, is it because mainstream media and government mouthpieces are being more and more challenged by the growing power of the internet and alternative news?
[01:19:54.926 --> 01:20:02.590]  I've seen reports in the last week that we finally passed that number where there's more people getting their news from the web than from traditional news sources.
[01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:14.591]  I should say that my employer, Sina.com, is owned by CBS Corporation, and I've spent over a year writing for CBSNews.com.
[01:20:14.651 --> 01:20:31.785]  This is a challenge for the mainstream media, and I guess I'm sort of at the fringes of it here, because unless we adapt and remain relevant to try to actually publish stories that are free from bias and that are true, honest, and accurate, our readers are going to flee to the Internet.
[01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.951]  No, I don't.
[01:20:46.955 --> 01:20:50.837]  People are doing things that are unlicensed.
[01:20:50.937 --> 01:20:54.359]  I think that the bureaucrats that inhabit Washington, D.C.
[01:20:54.379 --> 01:21:02.383]  would be pleased to license every single person for any reason in any occupation, including journalists and radio broadcasters, if they could get away with it.
[01:21:03.283 --> 01:21:13.948]  And of course, once you're licensed, and your license comes up for renewal, if you piss off the relevant government entity, then, well, you may not have a job anymore.
[01:21:13.988 --> 01:21:15.469]  You're likely to be at an end.
[01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:20.845]  I think this is just the dislike of things that they can't control and regulate them.
[01:21:20.905 --> 01:21:23.427]  And we're seeing it in more and more disturbing ways.
[01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:26.249]  It's more like this ration effect.
[01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:28.091]  Things are getting worse, they rarely get better.
[01:21:28.996 --> 01:21:35.700]  We're going to get briefly back into the cyber security bill and whether or not, what form it will pass, the House or Senate version.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.541]  The Senate, it appears, is even worse.
[01:21:37.921 --> 01:21:47.987]  Then we're going to shift gears into other surveillance that most concerns you and the latest developments on cell phones and things like Google's Buzz as well.
[01:21:48.388 --> 01:21:51.149]  We'll be right back with Declan McCullough of CNET News.
[01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:53.151]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.631 --> 01:21:55.132]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:56.147 --> 01:21:58.930]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.592 --> 01:22:04.315]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:10.361]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:10.641 --> 01:22:18.489]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[01:22:18.889 --> 01:22:25.014]  For example, with each pre-production order of three 7-Day Responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[01:22:25.255 --> 01:22:27.216]  That's Buy 3, Get 1 Free.
[01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:30.139]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:37.886]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this Buy 3, Get 1 Free program.
[01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:41.187]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[01:22:41.567 --> 01:22:42.408]  Another example?
[01:22:42.628 --> 01:22:45.669]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[01:22:45.809 --> 01:22:50.952]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[01:22:50.972 --> 01:22:51.712]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[01:22:51.772 --> 01:22:53.153]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:23:01.732 --> 01:23:07.074]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:23:08.335 --> 01:23:13.097]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:23:13.457 --> 01:23:20.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.361]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:28.203]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:23:30.543 --> 01:23:34.586]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:23:35.287 --> 01:23:38.469]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:39.931]  Others don't.
[01:23:40.351 --> 01:23:42.232]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:23:42.493 --> 01:23:43.994]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:23:44.274 --> 01:23:46.856]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:53.421]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:23:53.802 --> 01:23:55.984]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:23:56.504 --> 01:23:58.546]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:23:58.866 --> 01:23:59.747]  Others don't.
[01:24:02.429 --> 01:24:06.033]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:24:06.053 --> 01:24:09.456]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:24:09.676 --> 01:24:14.461]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:24:14.481 --> 01:24:20.747]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:24:20.887 --> 01:24:23.130]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:23.930]  Tim Geithner?
[01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:24.371]  Bernanke?
[01:24:24.451 --> 01:24:25.111]  They're arsonists!
[01:24:25.131 --> 01:24:26.392]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:24:26.412 --> 01:24:28.654]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:24:42.543 --> 01:24:44.364]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:24:44.385 --> 01:24:49.529]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:24:49.829 --> 01:24:58.936]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:11.464]  Next hour, I'm going to break down the demonization of the Tea Parties.
[01:25:11.484 --> 01:25:14.545]  The media is saying that they're terrorists about to strike.
[01:25:15.265 --> 01:25:22.148]  Meanwhile, Rick Perry was swept back into office, an unprecedented third term, by posing as a Tea Party person.
[01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:29.936]  So you have the Republican leadership in some areas mimicking it, other Republican leadership attacking it, the Democrats attacking it.
[01:25:29.956 --> 01:25:33.299]  We're going to decode all this in the next hour.
[01:25:33.359 --> 01:25:44.427]  Declan McCullough, writer and editor over at CNET News, one of the preeminent news websites out there covering all things technology and internet.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:26:10.677]  I mean, there's so many other things I want to cover with you, but briefly, I wanted to get Jason Bermas, who's been here with us the last year, working on his new film that's going to be out April 15th, and of course that is Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, but Jason has gone over the cybersecurity bill, and I wanted Jason Bermas to just briefly read over some of the subsections to Declan McCullough and get his take on it, then we're going to cover the latest
[01:26:11.698 --> 01:26:13.799]  Other things that Declan's most concerned with.
[01:26:13.819 --> 01:26:14.679]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:26:14.899 --> 01:26:29.606]  Well, one of the most alarming things in this bill, outside of the FCC takeover, outside of the non-profit organizations they will prop up as front groups, is Section 12, Federal Cyber Scholarship for Service Program.
[01:26:30.026 --> 01:26:32.607]  Now, earlier you were talking about all high school and college students.
[01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:33.528]  It's much worse than that.
[01:26:33.668 --> 01:26:37.050]  Yeah, we know Obama has city year and wants national compulsory service.
[01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:38.090]  He's on record.
[01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:39.771]  Now, this is grabbing the kids out of schools.
[01:26:40.191 --> 01:26:41.772]  Absolutely grabbing the kids out of school.
[01:26:42.092 --> 01:26:53.218]  Subsection 4 shall provide a procedure for identifying promising K-12 students for participation in summer work and internship programs that would lead to certification for what?
[01:26:53.558 --> 01:26:57.020]  Federal Information Technology Workforce Standards.
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:02.443]  And it says that anybody later in there that's going to work with any IT related stuff has to have this government certification.
[01:27:02.463 --> 01:27:03.263]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[01:27:03.504 --> 01:27:05.124]  What's your take on this, Declan McCullough?
[01:27:06.065 --> 01:27:07.426]  It's unnecessary.
[01:27:08.446 --> 01:27:16.011]  Out of the realm of things to get worried about, I'll be more worried about active surveillance and tracking and monitoring.
[01:27:16.551 --> 01:27:21.274]  I don't get as alarmed about this bill, but this is an area where reasonable people can
[01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:30.674]  But I think this is where they're coming in and engineering the society and creating the industry of surveillance and control.
[01:27:31.615 --> 01:27:37.097]  They're spending a lot of money, hundreds of billions of dollars on surveillance and control.
[01:27:37.257 --> 01:27:44.480]  And yet another example, I don't see why we need the federal government to spend this much money.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.281]  I think it's something like
[01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.570]  I think so.
[01:28:07.578 --> 01:28:08.680]  I totally agree with you.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:15.287]  I mean, I think biotech is the real danger because of the incredible disasters that can take place from it.
[01:28:15.507 --> 01:28:17.990]  Jason, go over some more subsections for him and get his take on it.
[01:28:18.330 --> 01:28:19.291]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:28:19.692 --> 01:28:26.379]  What really alarms me about the K-12 students is that in order to get these scholarships, you have to work for the government.
[01:28:26.679 --> 01:28:29.582]  You have to work for the federal government.
[01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:35.668]  And when you see an economy that's totally faltering, totally falling down, of course you're going to take these scholarships, Alex.
[01:28:35.928 --> 01:28:37.750]  And these are young, impressionable minds.
[01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:42.195]  They're going to be the ones that are trained to watch the CCTV cameras and the drones.
[01:28:42.375 --> 01:28:43.876]  Let's get into some other sections for him.
[01:28:43.936 --> 01:28:44.417]  Absolutely.
[01:28:45.718 --> 01:28:50.384]  Let's move into how they're creating a cybersecurity advisory panel.
[01:28:50.424 --> 01:28:55.270]  They'll have real-time cybersecurity dashboards where everything will be watched and monitored.
[01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:57.713]  They want to do this regionally as well.
[01:28:57.733 --> 01:29:02.579]  They want to make sure that the infrastructure is not only federalized, Alex, but it's in your local and state government.
[01:29:02.619 --> 01:29:07.820]  And they say they give it, sections of it, to private corporations and then you have all these sweetheart deals.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:13.442]  It's like Chertoff, you know, making the order for the body scanners and then he gets money from it.
[01:29:13.702 --> 01:29:22.364]  I mean, isn't this also a big boon to the military industrial surveillance grid where they get to make all these big profits off cyber security?
[01:29:22.384 --> 01:29:24.965]  Declan McCullough?
[01:29:25.889 --> 01:29:26.090]  Right.
[01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:28.352]  It's along the same vein.
[01:29:28.392 --> 01:29:31.795]  I mean, there are lots of problems with this.
[01:29:31.855 --> 01:29:33.437]  I mean, the verses were in the Constitution.
[01:29:33.517 --> 01:29:37.200]  It gives the government explicit authority to do this.
[01:29:37.881 --> 01:29:38.642]  I haven't found it.
[01:29:38.682 --> 01:29:41.805]  I mean, maybe eventually we'll be on Earth.
[01:29:42.906 --> 01:29:45.949]  There's also the secondary question of
[01:29:46.345 --> 01:29:48.368]  Can you speak up for us, Declan?
[01:29:58.952 --> 01:30:07.238]  Sure, there's the folks who are running the, or monitoring the dashboards, I'm not familiar with the bill as Jason is, I've skimmed it but I haven't actually written about it.
[01:30:07.258 --> 01:30:18.225]  If we could, these people were paragons of virtue, the platonic ideal of civil servants that could be trusted perfectly, then maybe it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[01:30:18.785 --> 01:30:28.572]  But the problem is that civil servants, bureaucrats, are human, they have flaws, the surveillance programs are abused, and who's going to watch the watchers?
[01:30:29.392 --> 01:30:29.853]  Exactly.
[01:30:29.893 --> 01:30:31.294]  Let's get into some more subsections.
[01:30:31.354 --> 01:30:31.714]  Jason?
[01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:36.678]  Well, you talked a lot about standardizing software, so I want to read that subsection as well.
[01:30:36.718 --> 01:30:44.203]  This is section 6, and we're putting this all under NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, that we both know have been corrupt in the past.
[01:30:44.403 --> 01:30:45.224]  This is subsection 5.
[01:30:46.045 --> 01:30:47.746]  Standard software configuration.
[01:30:47.786 --> 01:30:53.290]  The institute shall establish standard configurations consisting of security settings
[01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.690]  I think?
[01:31:11.753 --> 01:31:12.193]  That's right.
[01:31:12.254 --> 01:31:25.524]  In fact, they have special, they will, this is in subsection 6, right here, make loans on a selective short-term basis of items of advanced cybersecurity countermeasures to small businesses with less than 100 employees.
[01:31:25.744 --> 01:31:29.828]  They're going after everybody, big and small, to get this grid into place, Alex.
[01:31:30.407 --> 01:31:31.148]  I'll tell you what I want to do.
[01:31:31.168 --> 01:31:33.730]  I want to finish up with Declan McCullough from CNET News.
[01:31:34.271 --> 01:31:41.818]  Let's have you back in the last 15-20 minutes of the show to go through that subsection by subsection because I've covered it a few months ago, you covered it a few weeks ago.
[01:31:42.158 --> 01:31:45.221]  We need to go back over this because this is getting ready to probably pass the Congress.
[01:31:45.521 --> 01:31:47.923]  Declan McCullough, any word on when this could pass?
[01:31:48.324 --> 01:31:49.245]  It's passed the House.
[01:31:50.049 --> 01:31:52.450]  I think it passed the House in early February.
[01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:54.951]  But, you know, a lot of things pass the House and die in the Senate.
[01:31:55.512 --> 01:32:10.018]  I wouldn't say the odds are very good it will not become law this year, but in part that also depends on whether this becomes a controversial piece of legislation that people are actually calling their Senators about or not.
[01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:11.139]  I don't know whether that's going to happen.
[01:32:11.879 --> 01:32:13.920]  Okay, we've got about eight minutes left with you.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.601]  Declan McCullough, CNET News.
[01:32:15.961 --> 01:32:17.242]  Fire out the website for CNET.
[01:32:21.684 --> 01:32:27.066]  Tell folks the best place to go on the CNET website and read your articles.
[01:32:27.346 --> 01:32:29.987]  The best place to go is news.com.
[01:32:30.007 --> 01:32:31.247]  That's N-E-W-S dot com.
[01:32:31.287 --> 01:32:32.488]  Pretty easy to get to.
[01:32:32.508 --> 01:32:36.729]  You can type in my name, B-E-C-L-A-N-E-N-T-O-M-E.
[01:32:37.209 --> 01:32:38.790]  Well, you do write a lot of great articles.
[01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:39.910]  I learn a lot from you.
[01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:43.712]  What are you most concerned about with Big Brother surveillance?
[01:32:45.752 --> 01:32:47.233]  It's actually cell phones right now.
[01:32:47.273 --> 01:32:50.554]  It's what I've spent a lot of time thinking about and writing about in the last month or so.
[01:32:51.595 --> 01:32:53.937]  And there are two aspects.
[01:32:53.957 --> 01:32:57.439]  The first is tracking, and the second is examining them.
[01:32:57.759 --> 01:32:59.240]  Tracking is probably more interesting.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:09.065]  There's an open question about whether or not the federal government can track the location of your cell phone without a warrant.
[01:33:10.086 --> 01:33:11.327]  Courts have split on this.
[01:33:11.347 --> 01:33:13.048]  The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this.
[01:33:13.848 --> 01:33:20.372]  And it depends in part on whether the courts are going to say that the Fourth Amendment applies, that is the Constitution.
[01:33:21.506 --> 01:33:26.544]  A reasonable expectation of privacy and unreasonable purchase of t-shirts applies.
[01:33:27.236 --> 01:33:35.920]  Uh, there's, uh, the Bush administration made the argument that warrantless tracking is perfectly okay, and the Obama administration has made exactly the same argument.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:43.604]  Uh, DOJ is saying that warrantless tracking is permitted because Americans enjoy no reasonable expectation of privacy in their cell phones' wearabouts.
[01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:47.526]  And this is an important issue, because your cell phone is a radio transmitter and a receiver.
[01:33:47.806 --> 01:33:53.609]  Uh, wherever, um, it talks to radio towers, and through triangulation, or through GPS, the radio towers get out of
[01:33:53.889 --> 01:33:54.890]  Pretty good idea of where you are.
[01:34:12.202 --> 01:34:30.472]  You have no privacy in your own home business or your own corporate business and that dovetails now, first it's the borders, now regular airports inside the country are seizing people's laptops, phones, without, and they put a ruling out two days ago on this, without any perception that you've done anything wrong.
[01:34:30.572 --> 01:34:32.593]  No due process, no probable cause.
[01:34:32.993 --> 01:34:37.516]  What an amazing statement that we'll do whatever we want with your cell phones, we don't care.
[01:34:39.411 --> 01:34:40.472]  That's the second half of this.
[01:34:40.512 --> 01:34:52.462]  Let's put tracking aside for the moment and talk about examining your cell phone, which is really more of a privacy threat in some ways because your cell phone knows more about you than maybe your closest friends do.
[01:34:52.522 --> 01:34:54.424]  It knows where you're going to be for your calendar.
[01:34:54.444 --> 01:34:57.086]  It knows where you had dinner.
[01:34:57.106 --> 01:34:59.888]  It knows who you've been emailing with and all that.
[01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:05.053]  It's basically like a diary and probably even more personal than your laptop nowadays.
[01:35:06.094 --> 01:35:09.636]  And so this is another unresolved legal issue.
[01:35:10.477 --> 01:35:24.407]  When police arrest you, and maybe you're not charged with crime, maybe you're just detained, maybe you're at a protest and you're arrested and released an hour later without any charges being filed, can they look at your cell phone?
[01:35:24.487 --> 01:35:28.190]  Can they plug it into their police computer and copy over all the content?
[01:35:29.082 --> 01:35:30.063]  I don't think so.
[01:35:48.126 --> 01:35:50.947]  And the judge said, yep, not a problem.
[01:35:51.007 --> 01:35:51.907]  Warrantless search.
[01:35:51.927 --> 01:35:53.227]  That's perfectly acceptable.
[01:35:53.247 --> 01:36:00.029]  Well, I saw that in the Ninth Circuit two weeks ago and the dissenting judge was the Chief Justice of the Ninth Circuit.
[01:36:00.069 --> 01:36:01.829]  He said there's no more Fourth Amendment.
[01:36:02.129 --> 01:36:07.271]  The police went in this guy's house with no expectation or no idea he committed any crime.
[01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:13.332]  I mean, it's just they're blasting past the Fourth Amendment and I think people are just too calmly accepting this.
[01:36:13.652 --> 01:36:17.273]  This presses hedge of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:36:17.853 --> 01:36:19.374]  Well, you know, is there for a reason?
[01:36:19.735 --> 01:36:23.318]  And every time governments go over that edge, they slide all the way to the bottom.
[01:36:25.139 --> 01:36:35.187]  The courts have, um, it's almost like the Bill of Rights has become, uh, the word lawyer has become untethered, um, from its actual language.
[01:36:35.468 --> 01:36:39.511]  Court interpretations don't really track what the Constitution says, in many cases.
[01:36:40.412 --> 01:36:41.913]  There are exceptions.
[01:36:42.614 --> 01:36:42.974]  There are
[01:36:43.849 --> 01:36:49.614]  I mean, you had the Supreme Court yesterday in the Second Amendment case, the McDonald's case.
[01:36:49.774 --> 01:37:04.046]  Unfortunately, it wasn't there, but I read the transcript in its entirety, and you had all the blocks of liberal justices saying, well, we may have to extend the Second Amendment to the states.
[01:37:04.126 --> 01:37:12.173]  Both states can't infringe your right to keep and bear arms, but we'll make it a really weak right that can be infringed on any time the state government
[01:37:12.433 --> 01:37:13.213]  Exactly!
[01:37:13.233 --> 01:37:28.818]  This is being billed as a pro-gun ruling, the one a year and a half ago, and now the new one, because we haven't seen the ruling yet, but they're making noises from the court watcher's perspective, and they're saying, you got a right, and the right is, we can take your guns.
[01:37:30.497 --> 01:37:35.159]  The bad thing is that, you know, you have a right, but it's a really weak right.
[01:37:35.199 --> 01:37:45.824]  Maybe you can keep a single, or maybe a 12-gauge single-shot shotgun in your house, but you can't actually ever leave the house.
[01:37:45.844 --> 01:37:50.567]  I mean, you can imagine, you have the right, but the right is so small, it may as well not even exist.
[01:37:50.627 --> 01:37:52.568]  And he didn't have any justice, unfortunately.
[01:37:52.608 --> 01:37:59.571]  Not even, say, Justice Scalia, talking about the actual text of the Second Amendment, which is, it shall not be infringed.
[01:38:00.185 --> 01:38:01.133]  Sounds pretty clear to me.
[01:38:02.759 --> 01:38:08.462]  Well, we know what the founders said, we know what the state constitutions say, we know what the common law practice of the second amendment is.
[01:38:08.522 --> 01:38:20.109]  It's Vermont style, open carry, and they started out in the sixties, oh, let's stop felons, and all that did was make the felons safe to rob and rape the public in Chicago and New York.
[01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:30.856]  And, yeah, I've been reading the text of what the Supreme Court justices were saying in these arguments in the last few days, and it's very clear they're going to rule yes, states,
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:37.986]  You do have to extend some right, but as you said, that's a right for us to basically restrict your Second Amendment.
[01:38:38.327 --> 01:38:40.609]  So you have a right, but we have a right to restrict it.
[01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:44.012]  And so they're saying, oh, for the first time the Supreme Court's going to say you have a right.
[01:38:44.433 --> 01:38:44.713]  No!
[01:38:45.074 --> 01:38:50.439]  For the first time they're saying you don't have a total right, and it's just unbelievably evil.
[01:38:50.919 --> 01:38:53.022]  We've got Larry Pratt on about that tomorrow.
[01:38:53.322 --> 01:38:55.164]  In the last minute and a half, Declan McCullough
[01:38:55.544 --> 01:39:01.829]  Other areas, other areas of surveillance and tyranny and corruption that you're reporting on that people should be made aware of?
[01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:07.213]  Here's one that actually combines the internet and the phone, right?
[01:39:08.234 --> 01:39:11.417]  So, Palo Alto is a city where Stanford University is.
[01:39:11.437 --> 01:39:14.319]  It's about maybe 40 miles south of San Francisco.
[01:39:14.899 --> 01:39:17.662]  And you may have actually covered this.
[01:39:17.682 --> 01:39:21.765]  There was one of the police detectives in East Palo Alto
[01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:28.435]  Uh, apparently posted a note on Facebook threatening to kill anyone if he found openly carrying a handgun.
[01:39:28.475 --> 01:39:32.478]  Even if that person's carrying it perfectly legally, this is open carry.
[01:39:32.918 --> 01:39:34.780]  And, uh, I wrote about that.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:36.421]  It's an interesting story.
[01:39:36.441 --> 01:39:37.182]  You can find it on news.com.
[01:39:40.192 --> 01:39:43.293]  Even under California law, Sacramento hasn't gotten around to restricting this yet.
[01:39:43.333 --> 01:39:47.955]  It's generally legal for California residents to carry handguns openly as long as they're unloaded.
[01:39:48.815 --> 01:40:05.062]  But this fellow Rod Toulassan, who is a detective, said, well, if someone doing that would have pulled the AR out and thrown them all out, and if one of them made a furtive movement two weeks off, which is a reference to two weeks of death duty, if an officer discharges a weapon.
[01:40:05.302 --> 01:40:08.303]  And so I talked to the Palo Alto police captain about the Facebook.
[01:40:08.903 --> 01:40:09.684]  I don't think so.
[01:40:19.542 --> 01:40:35.046]  But it shows their attitude, and now we have the ATF seizing 30 plus thousand dollars of not even BB guns, rubber pellet toy guns, and then now I have news articles today where they're defending it, saying we want the federal government to pass laws restricting toy guns.
[01:40:35.126 --> 01:40:39.247]  I mean, they're arresting kids who draw a picture of a gun at school now.
[01:40:39.267 --> 01:40:45.149]  I mean, they're acting like guns in the hands of common slaves is like the ultimate evil.
[01:40:45.209 --> 01:40:46.509]  It's worse than child porn.
[01:40:47.533 --> 01:40:50.614]  Well, I mean, we're going down the path that Great Britain has already taken.
[01:40:50.654 --> 01:40:53.915]  I mean, we should ban even toy guns because that might give people the idea that guns are okay.
[01:40:53.935 --> 01:40:54.835]  It's perfectly clear.
[01:40:56.095 --> 01:40:59.336]  And there's no real lobby to support toy guns, so they may get away with it.
[01:40:59.796 --> 01:41:01.797]  Declan McCullough, amazing information.
[01:41:01.837 --> 01:41:04.377]  Thank you for spending the last 45 minutes with us.
[01:41:04.697 --> 01:41:06.098]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[01:41:06.138 --> 01:41:10.039]  Folks can read your great work at the CNET News website or news.com, as you said.
[01:41:10.079 --> 01:41:10.459]  Take care.
[01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:11.519]  Thank you much.
[01:41:12.319 --> 01:41:13.780]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.560]  We're going to come back.
[01:41:15.728 --> 01:41:17.009]  Get into some financial news.
[01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:19.229]  Next hour is going to be completely jam-packed.
[01:41:19.309 --> 01:41:22.431]  I'm covering all this news and the cybersecurity bill.
[01:41:22.491 --> 01:41:24.312]  I mean, it's on every subject.
[01:41:24.392 --> 01:41:25.152]  It's all coming up.
[01:41:25.492 --> 01:41:29.654]  Before we go to break, I want to thank some of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:41:29.814 --> 01:41:31.675]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:41:32.115 --> 01:41:39.018]  The highest quality, best price, newly made food, non-GMO, non-hybrid, all grown,
[01:41:40.208 --> 01:41:41.068]  Right here in the U.S.
[01:41:41.088 --> 01:41:41.949]  except for the bananas.
[01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:45.750]  And they've got ready-to-eat meals, prepared gourmet meals, raw meals.
[01:41:46.091 --> 01:41:47.431]  They've got it for special diets.
[01:41:47.551 --> 01:41:48.812]  They are the big kahuna.
[01:41:48.852 --> 01:41:51.873]  They're number one because they're the best and it's who I buy my storable foods from.
[01:41:51.893 --> 01:41:53.814]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:41:53.854 --> 01:41:56.415]  These uncertain times don't count on the government.
[01:41:56.855 --> 01:41:59.116]  Look what happens in disasters and financial crises.
[01:41:59.376 --> 01:42:02.858]  You need to have a year's supply of food or a six-month, a month, whatever.
[01:42:03.078 --> 01:42:04.559]  This stuff lasts for more than ten years.
[01:42:04.919 --> 01:42:06.981]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[01:42:07.001 --> 01:42:09.682]  Also want to thank the great folks at Front Sight Firearms Training.
[01:42:09.702 --> 01:42:12.423]  You can get five days of firearms training, world-class.
[01:42:20.928 --> 01:42:27.432]  Five days world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:42:27.713 --> 01:42:33.777]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory HD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:42:34.177 --> 01:42:39.460]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.322]  No drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[01:42:41.602 --> 01:42:46.085]  Find out more, plus there's a lot of cool free stuff and newsletters, at FrontSight.com.
[01:42:46.325 --> 01:42:48.426]  That's FrontSight.com.
[01:42:48.466 --> 01:42:49.107]  It's not enough!
[01:42:49.667 --> 01:42:52.931]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:42:52.951 --> 01:42:55.453]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:42:55.673 --> 01:42:57.275]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:43:12.432 --> 01:43:15.114]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:43:15.855 --> 01:43:21.319]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:26.524]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:43:27.044 --> 01:43:36.672]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:43:36.792 --> 01:43:38.893]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:43:39.133 --> 01:43:40.474]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:43:40.734 --> 01:43:42.995]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:45.015]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:43:45.035 --> 01:43:50.078]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:45:04.193 --> 01:45:09.860]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[01:45:10.501 --> 01:45:12.324]  The world is changing fast.
[01:45:12.704 --> 01:45:14.146]  Are you fully prepared?
[01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:17.612]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?

[01:45:45.053 --> 01:45:49.337]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[01:45:49.657 --> 01:45:52.019]  Food insurance, just in case.
[01:45:52.619 --> 01:45:57.223]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:46:04.944 --> 01:46:08.065]  Folks, the news is so important in the next hour.
[01:46:08.705 --> 01:46:11.266]  I mean, just all of this is so key.
[01:46:11.787 --> 01:46:14.888]  We know where the future of this country is going and the globalists have their way.
[01:46:15.388 --> 01:46:17.309]  I wanted to get some into the economy right now.
[01:46:17.369 --> 01:46:25.852]  I keep hearing the media out of one side of their mouth say it's gotten great, out of the other side saying it's fallen apart with record joblessness, factories shutting down, government growing.
[01:46:26.152 --> 01:46:31.214]  I have articles like USA Today, New Ghost Towns, industrial communities teeter on the edge.
[01:46:31.934 --> 01:46:35.755]  Gold hits six-and-a-half-week high, went up to $1,141.70.
[01:46:37.555 --> 01:46:39.916]  It's even higher.
[01:46:39.956 --> 01:46:44.937]  It's at the highest level it's ever been in Europe, because the euro is in so much trouble.
[01:46:44.997 --> 01:46:46.637]  The dollar is in trouble.
[01:46:46.697 --> 01:46:49.758]  We know what's going to happen with what these banks are doing.
[01:46:49.898 --> 01:46:55.479]  Anglo Gold plans to scour ocean floor as gold reserves dwindle.
[01:46:55.819 --> 01:47:00.100]  So you have this gold rush going, and the mines can't find enough gold
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.321]  It just goes on and on.
[01:47:02.381 --> 01:47:09.164]  So I briefly wanted to get Ted Anderson up for the next three or four minutes to talk about the same offer he gave yesterday.
[01:47:09.204 --> 01:47:14.847]  He can still give you the same offer from when he bought gold at $1,065 an ounce with it $1,141.
[01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:22.051]  So he passes on all those savings and the free International Forecaster newsletter.
[01:47:22.331 --> 01:47:25.953]  It's 45 to 50 pages that comes out twice a week.
[01:47:25.973 --> 01:47:29.375]  You can get a hard copy or the digital when you call them by one
[01:47:29.815 --> 01:47:32.617]  Fifth of an ounce European gold franc coin.
[01:47:33.218 --> 01:47:36.680]  That's like buying gold at $500 an ounce with that deal.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:37.781]  He has a bunch of other deals.
[01:47:38.142 --> 01:47:43.286]  Ted, give people today's important offer so they can protect themselves from currency devaluation.
[01:47:44.006 --> 01:47:44.306]  Yeah.
[01:47:44.426 --> 01:47:46.948]  Presently, right now, the franc is at $261.61.
[01:47:47.949 --> 01:47:58.998]  And if you do buy that one coin, you will get a full year subscription to the International Forecaster, which will give you the information you need to make sense of this crazy environment that we're in, of course.
[01:47:59.691 --> 01:48:00.231]  I don't
[01:48:19.315 --> 01:48:21.436]  You know, rarely do I get that opportunity.
[01:48:21.516 --> 01:48:24.377]  Of course, I did buy those at $1,053.
[01:48:24.757 --> 01:48:32.021]  We did hit the resistance point of $1,146.20 today, and that is a resistance level.
[01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:32.581]  The next one is $1,160.
[01:48:33.101 --> 01:48:36.663]  And that's what Bloomberg and others are saying.
[01:48:36.703 --> 01:48:39.844]  They're saying it's probably going to go to $1,160.
[01:48:40.184 --> 01:48:43.326]  If it goes past that, they're saying the sky could be the limit.
[01:48:43.786 --> 01:48:46.007]  Yeah, that's when you get past your $1,220, $1,240 like we did last time around.
[01:48:48.587 --> 01:48:55.232]  And of course, the only thing standing in the way of that is that the dollar is closer to 80 than it is to 70.
[01:48:55.712 --> 01:49:03.778]  The euro has already taken the dip, and they've already seen the market peak out to a level that it's never seen before in Europe and also Britain.
[01:49:03.858 --> 01:49:06.860]  So, what's the case here with the United States?
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:12.164]  I think that the United States dollar is in as much trouble as the euro, and I'm sure that gold will reflect that.
[01:49:13.985 --> 01:49:25.293]  And that's because all these currencies are being lowered and valued in a coordinated fashion by the G20, and they're now Economist, ABC News, another financial crisis on the way.
[01:49:25.754 --> 01:49:34.780]  But don't worry, the Nobel Prize winning group calls for stronger financial reforms, higher taxes, more money to the bankers, or we'll end up like Greece.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:40.644]  We saw the leader of the Democratic Senate talking about that yesterday.
[01:49:41.005 --> 01:49:42.265]  They're holding us hostage.
[01:49:43.306 --> 01:49:44.627]  We've got to expose these people.
[01:49:44.647 --> 01:49:50.871]  That's one way to politically stop them, to point out they are the harbingers and the people creating all of this to get more power.
[01:49:50.931 --> 01:49:54.534]  But individually, on the micro level, people need to get into gold and silver.
[01:49:54.774 --> 01:50:02.159]  Ted, give people some of the gold coins, some of the silver coin specific offers, so people understand how good of a deal this is.
[01:50:02.599 --> 01:50:03.360]  Sure, of course.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.240]  Well, let's take a look.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.722]  First of all, that Montana Silver Round is at $18.73.
[01:50:08.263 --> 01:50:11.145]  Silver right now is just approaching $17 an ounce.
[01:50:11.545 --> 01:50:12.966]  That thing usually trades at about
[01:50:13.499 --> 01:50:14.740]  Two dollars over spot.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.620]  You know, the Lakotas right now are low.
[01:50:16.801 --> 01:50:18.962]  There's a lot of things that I have that are real low at this point.
[01:50:19.002 --> 01:50:20.742]  The point is, we're out of time.
[01:50:20.782 --> 01:50:25.805]  People need to call the brokers, tell them it's the Alex Jones Special, to get these huge discounts or to get the free newsletter.
[01:50:25.825 --> 01:50:26.565]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:26.585 --> 01:50:26.625]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:26.645 --> 01:50:31.528]  They've got Franks, they've got Sovereigns, they've got Eagles, they've got a bunch of great silver coins.
[01:50:31.548 --> 01:50:31.588]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:31.608 --> 01:50:32.308]  Protect yourselves.
[01:50:43.914 --> 01:50:45.418]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:46.381 --> 01:50:48.707]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:53.186 --> 01:50:56.807]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:50:57.147 --> 01:51:05.288]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:51:06.008 --> 01:51:10.049]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:21.451]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:51:22.091 --> 01:51:31.093]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:51:31.613 --> 01:51:36.654]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:51:37.035 --> 01:51:44.236]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:51:44.516 --> 01:51:47.257]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:51:54.483 --> 01:51:56.386]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:56.867 --> 01:51:59.630]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:09.864 --> 01:52:22.852]  We will take some calls in this hour, but it needs to be quick and to the point because I must cover all of this news and information, but I also enjoy hearing what you have to say and the different unexpected directions that callers take us in.
[01:52:22.872 --> 01:52:23.213]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:23.393 --> 01:52:24.934]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:52:24.954 --> 01:52:27.235]  We're live here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:52:27.636 --> 01:52:27.916]  to 3 p.m.
[01:52:27.956 --> 01:52:29.617]  Central Standard Time, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:52:29.637 --> 01:52:29.857]  Eastern.
[01:52:36.241 --> 01:52:40.183]  And we're very excited to have all of you tuning in today.
[01:52:43.645 --> 01:52:52.009]  I want to tell you about some of the new stations that are picking up the show, as well as XM weeknights coming up in the next segment, so be ready for that information.
[01:52:52.469 --> 01:52:54.991]  Here is what's coming up in the hour.
[01:52:55.151 --> 01:53:01.434]  The most important news, after I cover some other information, that I'm going to really spend the lion's share of the time on is,
[01:53:02.694 --> 01:53:16.148]  The ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, they are demonizing Bachman of Minnesota, Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, myself, but really a lot of mainline conservatives.
[01:53:17.489 --> 01:53:22.395]  And implying that we're dangerous terrorists, that we're going to strike, that we're going to attack.
[01:53:23.584 --> 01:53:30.453]  And Paul Watson has written an article detailing how the FBI, the Southern Poverty Law Center and others were involved with McVeigh.
[01:53:30.714 --> 01:53:32.156]  This came out in court documents.
[01:53:32.536 --> 01:53:38.745]  They're using crises, staged crises in many cases, to demonize their opposition.
[01:53:40.006 --> 01:53:40.928]  And they're trying to
[01:53:43.976 --> 01:53:49.199]  demonize the only real opposition to their new world order program and that is what is known as the Tea Party Movement.
[01:53:49.659 --> 01:53:52.161]  And they're worried about it growing, becoming more mainstream.
[01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:54.422]  So they're trying to label it as bad.
[01:53:54.722 --> 01:53:58.265]  But you saw Rick Perry come to office, back into office,
[01:54:00.046 --> 01:54:08.150]  Well, to get the Republican nomination, he'll probably beat the Democrat easily in this Republican state by posing as one of these supposed radical Tea Party people.
[01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:18.236]  So we're going to be going over all the Democratic and Republican gatekeeping as they try to demonize the Patriot movement in this country, but they can't have it both ways.
[01:54:18.656 --> 01:54:19.477]  Republican leadership
[01:54:20.456 --> 01:54:23.939]  Acting like they're patriots, but at the same time demonizing patriots.
[01:54:24.659 --> 01:54:25.340]  That is coming up.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:41.653]  Also, you heard Declan McCullough of CBS News, CNET News, explaining to you, and I agree with him, we've got Larry Pratt of Gunners of America coming on tomorrow, that this Supreme Court ruling they're set to make, and they've basically told the world what they're going to do in their arguments,
[01:54:42.902 --> 01:54:44.042]  Is anti-gun.
[01:54:44.102 --> 01:54:47.783]  They're saying, yes, you have a right to have a gun, but we have a right to restrict your right to a gun.
[01:54:48.223 --> 01:54:51.244]  This is very, very serious news.
[01:54:51.584 --> 01:54:56.945]  So we need to girt ourselves for this coming down the road.
[01:54:56.965 --> 01:55:00.166]  I also want to get into the fact they're going after replica guns.
[01:55:00.186 --> 01:55:05.647]  We covered that some yesterday, but more on that coming up in the broadcast.
[01:55:05.687 --> 01:55:07.828]  Also talk about the Chilean quake.
[01:55:09.756 --> 01:55:15.339]  May have shortened the day, may have changed how fast the earth rotated.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.682]  That's out of CBC, Canadian Broadcasting News.
[01:55:20.162 --> 01:55:25.305]  And I'm getting a lot of emails and calls a week into this saying, well, Alex,
[01:55:28.413 --> 01:55:30.396]  Or less than a week into it, or four or five days into it.
[01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.740]  You know, Alex, is this an earthquake weapon?
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:38.906]  Well, the government says, Secretary of Defense Cohen told the Army Times they have earthquake weapons in 97.
[01:55:39.006 --> 01:55:40.488]  I don't know.
[01:55:40.508 --> 01:55:43.992]  It's been reported that that's some of the things HAARP can do.
[01:55:46.789 --> 01:55:50.911]  And we continue to see big cities being hit by unusual earthquakes.
[01:55:50.931 --> 01:55:53.612]  But I mean, it's natural though to have a lot of earthquakes, so I don't know.
[01:55:53.993 --> 01:55:55.533]  I know the government says they have this.
[01:55:56.334 --> 01:56:01.356]  I know in countries that have these earthquakes, they say the sky lights up before it happens.
[01:56:01.736 --> 01:56:02.997]  That's never been seen before.
[01:56:03.077 --> 01:56:05.778]  That was talked about on CNN and MSNBC.
[01:56:06.099 --> 01:56:11.941]  We'll be playing that clip coming up, because that kind of gets into conspiracy theory area, and I don't cover that much.
[01:56:12.262 --> 01:56:14.503]  But when the government admits they have these systems,
[01:56:15.498 --> 01:56:18.059]  It's just like they declassified chemtrails to a certain extent.
[01:56:18.139 --> 01:56:19.720]  Oh yes, we're doing weather modification.
[01:56:20.081 --> 01:56:23.002]  Yes, we're spraying you to save you from global warming.
[01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:28.305]  We're geoengineering, as the White House science czar John P. Holdren has been saying.
[01:56:28.385 --> 01:56:40.392]  So, we're going to get into the Second Amendment issue, then we're going to get into the demonization of true Americans, and how I believe they're going to stage a false flag terror attack very soon to be blamed on us.
[01:56:41.548 --> 01:56:43.049]  The whole stack thing could have even been that.
[01:56:43.069 --> 01:56:46.790]  A lot of evidence points towards that being a false flag inside stage provocation.
[01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:53.692]  Jason Burmas will join us for about 10 minutes towards the end of the show to go over the Cybersecurity Act because even Declan McCullough wasn't aware of what was in it.
[01:56:54.192 --> 01:56:58.974]  So we've got a job to do to let everybody know what's really in this bill and just how bad it is.
[01:56:59.454 --> 01:57:00.194]  Yeah, we're weirdos.
[01:57:00.274 --> 01:57:00.994]  We read the bills.
[01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:05.556]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:05.856 --> 01:57:06.436]  Number one.
[01:57:06.756 --> 01:57:10.758]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:11.038 --> 01:57:15.601]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:15.941 --> 01:57:16.401]  It's true.
[01:57:16.681 --> 01:57:21.223]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:22.364 --> 01:57:25.667]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:57:25.948 --> 01:57:30.432]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:57:30.672 --> 01:57:33.034]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:57:33.435 --> 01:57:36.758]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:37.899 --> 01:57:41.822]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:57:42.043 --> 01:57:46.806]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:59:52.997 --> 01:59:53.338]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.859 --> 02:00:08.900]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.621 --> 02:00:10.722]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.383 --> 02:00:12.183]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.984 --> 02:00:13.945]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.526 --> 02:00:18.209]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:22.754]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.553 --> 02:00:45.459]  Okay, we don't know exactly what the Supreme Court ruling will be in the next few months when they release it, but in the last week they've been hearing arguments on it, and court watchers from the Associated Press, anti-gun groups, pro-Second Amendment groups, all agree that it's bad news.
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:49.501]  Some of the media is billing it as pro-Second Amendment.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:01:09.956]  But if you read what the justices were saying, including Scalia and others, they are saying that states have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations, said Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was among the majority.
[02:01:13.536 --> 02:01:26.405]  And they talk about other previous rulings, and it appeared that all of the justices agreed, and this may be some type of unanimous decision when it comes out, that, oh yeah, you've got a right to keep and bear arms.
[02:01:26.465 --> 02:01:27.506]  It is an individual right.
[02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:33.249]  But if we want to locally or federally totally restrict it down to almost nothing, we can do that.
[02:01:33.269 --> 02:01:37.793]  And that's why the Violence Policy Center, Handgun Control Incorporated,
[02:01:38.873 --> 02:01:44.176]  And others have now come out and said, oh, we kind of like this ruling.
[02:01:44.996 --> 02:01:52.400]  You see, there were never had to be rulings at the federal level about the Second Amendment because everyone knew what it meant.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.943]  And so when they say there's never been a ruling on the Second Amendment until a year and a half ago with the D.C.
[02:01:57.963 --> 02:02:00.604]  versus Heller, and in that case, you know,
[02:02:01.857 --> 02:02:16.761]  People's own homes, their businesses, they would be robbed, raped, killed at gunpoint because D.C., New York City, and Chicago all have the highest crime rates in the country because they have absolute gun bans in place for the citizens.
[02:02:17.322 --> 02:02:18.842]  And the criminals don't follow the law.
[02:02:19.642 --> 02:02:20.543]  And they understand that.
[02:02:23.530 --> 02:02:24.250]  Look, it's simple.
[02:02:24.611 --> 02:02:26.572]  They want you to be their slaves.
[02:02:26.732 --> 02:02:28.252]  They don't want you armed.
[02:02:28.653 --> 02:02:30.133]  It's the same all over the world.
[02:02:30.273 --> 02:02:36.817]  Every country in the world has banned or is moving to ban and restrict people's right to self-defense.
[02:02:37.237 --> 02:02:47.882]  And the police will tell you, all the federal and state courts have ruled over and over again, police have no responsibility to protect you from the commission of a crime.
[02:02:48.042 --> 02:02:51.404]  Rape, robbery, murder, torture, any of it.
[02:02:52.461 --> 02:02:55.785]  They are there to respond after laws have been violated.
[02:02:56.766 --> 02:03:05.756]  And that's why in court cases, people sue saying the cops didn't show up for 20 minutes to my 911 call, and you know, my daughter got killed, and they say, well, they have no responsibility to.
[02:03:06.476 --> 02:03:13.184]  We have a responsibility to defend ourselves, and they want us domesticated as a society.
[02:03:15.379 --> 02:03:30.832]  So, we've gone from, if you looked at polls 30-40 years ago, people kind of got brainwashed about guns for a while, it became trendy to be anti-gun, until people saw how crime went up when they started restricting guns, and the polls were pretty much 50-50.
[02:03:30.893 --> 02:03:37.899]  Now the polls are in the mid-70s, and it's growing every year, where the vast majority of Americans
[02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:42.533]  They know the Second Amendment is good and want no laws.
[02:03:42.573 --> 02:03:47.538]  They don't even want felons barred because they know felons will still have guns regardless.
[02:03:47.638 --> 02:03:49.100]  They don't want their rights touched.
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:52.263]  They want their right to defend themselves back.
[02:03:52.824 --> 02:03:57.109]  And they are going to fight in the courts and in the court of public opinion to defend it.
[02:03:58.348 --> 02:04:19.056]  And so the government's kind of shut up on the surface about going after guns, but is using the ATF to restrict legal importation of firearms, to harass gun dealers, gun manufacturers, to go after states like Montana and Tennessee and others that are passing laws or have passed laws saying they can manufacture their own guns in their state outside of federal control.
[02:04:19.337 --> 02:04:24.959]  Then the feds try to use the Commerce Clause to come in and shut that down and not allow that.
[02:04:27.003 --> 02:04:28.966]  So the fight is on for the Second Amendment.
[02:04:28.986 --> 02:04:29.927]  The American people know this.
[02:04:29.947 --> 02:04:33.451]  That's why, what is it, 16 million guns the last year and three months?
[02:04:34.335 --> 02:04:43.159]  Since Obama got into office, he got into office 13 and a half months ago, but after he got elected back in November, it's about 15 months, 16 months.
[02:04:43.959 --> 02:04:50.582]  Since then, you've seen a million guns a month being sold.
[02:04:51.043 --> 02:04:56.125]  You've got over 200 million guns in the country, over 150 million gun owners, and they've got a big problem.
[02:04:56.485 --> 02:05:00.687]  Now, anywhere they can, though, where there's not a lobby or anybody to protect the Second Amendment,
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:08.564]  They're going after it, like the case in Oregon where the guy for years has been importing to their toy store airsoft BB guns.
[02:05:08.584 --> 02:05:09.784]  They don't even shoot real BBs.
[02:05:10.125 --> 02:05:12.246]  The ATF has no regulatory authority over BB guns.
[02:05:12.786 --> 02:05:17.269]  They've now grabbed toy guns that shoot plastic pellets and say there's no law, no judge, no jury.
[02:05:17.709 --> 02:05:18.969]  We're just doing what we want.
[02:05:18.989 --> 02:05:26.193]  And I played the ATF officer basically saying, well this gun's scary, it looks like a real gun, so I'm gonna ban it because I'm God.
[02:05:26.213 --> 02:05:30.356]  Kind of like the Austin police chief with the ATF shutting down an 18-year-old gun show.
[02:05:30.976 --> 02:05:33.418]  With no law, just saying, I feel like it had shut down.
[02:05:34.399 --> 02:05:35.360]  But look at Canada.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.661]  This is from the CBC.
[02:05:37.261 --> 02:05:40.263]  Replica guns should be licensed, safety council says.
[02:05:40.724 --> 02:05:45.588]  Replica guns should be licensed and registered, just like the real thing, says safety advocates and police.
[02:05:46.328 --> 02:05:48.570]  That's the government that thinks we're their slaves.
[02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:53.534]  In recent years, police officers across the country have shot and killed several people holding guns they later turned out to be replicas.
[02:05:54.034 --> 02:05:57.217]  Well, I mean, so take everybody's rights, because somebody might be hurt.
[02:05:59.710 --> 02:06:00.771]  Again, that's how they do it.
[02:06:01.511 --> 02:06:03.772]  So we see these deceptive headlines about U.S.
[02:06:03.792 --> 02:06:07.394]  Supreme Court set to extend gun rights.
[02:06:07.774 --> 02:06:13.838]  But then you read deeper into the AP and ABC News articles, it says, oh, but they're allowed to restrict your right.
[02:06:13.898 --> 02:06:15.879]  You have a right to turn your guns in.
[02:06:16.439 --> 02:06:18.020]  You have a right to be disarmed.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:25.204]  You have a right to have a disassembled gun locked in a safe that you can never use and you can't take it out and shoot it.
[02:06:26.725 --> 02:06:28.126]  Basically what's happening in D.C.
[02:06:28.166 --> 02:06:28.286]  now.
[02:06:30.377 --> 02:06:35.619]  In other scary news, New York Times, EU clears biotech potato for cultivation.
[02:06:35.639 --> 02:06:49.524]  The European Commission began a new push Tuesday to allow farmers in Europe to grow more biotech crops, clearing a genetically modified potato for cultivation despite persistent public opposition to the technology.
[02:06:51.485 --> 02:06:57.407]  And folks, every one of these tomatoes, potatoes, corn, you name it, in every study,
[02:06:58.587 --> 02:07:05.171]  In every study, reduces fertility or outright sterilizes rodents, guinea pigs, rats, mice that it's fed to.
[02:07:06.492 --> 02:07:12.976]  There's massive studies about honeybees eating the pollen from GMO Monsanto corn and dying.
[02:07:14.197 --> 02:07:15.197]  Just one example.
[02:07:15.598 --> 02:07:24.123]  That corn grows in it a natural pesticide that kills bugs that eat it.
[02:07:25.171 --> 02:07:28.654]  But then you, a human, it's supposedly safe, they're saying, for you to eat that.
[02:07:29.154 --> 02:07:44.345]  When every major director or sub-director of the FDA in the last few decades has been a former Monsanto executive, and Obama just appointed a new one, over all the regulatory affairs, who will decide?
[02:07:44.745 --> 02:07:46.646]  I mean, this is a disaster.
[02:07:47.367 --> 02:07:48.568]  And you have the globalist
[02:07:50.134 --> 02:07:58.985]  Deceiving the public saying, look, GMO, cross-species, you know, where they put insect genes in corn or human genes in salmon.
[02:07:59.025 --> 02:08:00.066]  I mean, it's wild.
[02:08:00.466 --> 02:08:06.494]  Sometimes they stack hundreds of different animals and insects into one plant and all these genetic traits.
[02:08:08.905 --> 02:08:11.847]  What fake conservatives do is they say, oh, that's all a liberal thing.
[02:08:11.867 --> 02:08:13.708]  You know, they're lying, they're deeming, I don't know.
[02:08:14.628 --> 02:08:16.049]  Obama's supporting all of this.
[02:08:16.670 --> 02:08:19.912]  Europe, the people don't want it, but their governments are forcing it on them.
[02:08:19.932 --> 02:08:21.333]  It's a non-partisan issue.
[02:08:21.993 --> 02:08:31.339]  And what Limbaugh and others will do, I've heard them do it over and over again, they'll say, look, George Washington Carver crossed different types of sweet potatoes and different types of varieties of wheat.
[02:08:32.299 --> 02:08:40.864]  And different varieties of watermelons, and different varieties of squash, and different varieties of soybeans.
[02:08:41.785 --> 02:08:49.630]  And, well, yeah, I mean, if you take two different varieties of plant and mix them naturally through pollinization, that's completely normal.
[02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:51.010]  That's natural.
[02:08:51.851 --> 02:08:52.952]  That's like dog breeding.
[02:08:52.992 --> 02:08:55.713]  You take different dogs and breed them together to get a new type of breed.
[02:08:56.454 --> 02:09:01.537]  You're still dealing with the original genetics of canine familiaris, the dog.
[02:09:03.271 --> 02:09:10.336]  When you breed different types of cows with cows, other cows, you're still dealing with the original water buffalo.
[02:09:10.616 --> 02:09:14.019]  You're still dealing with the original bovine species.
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:29.870]  But when you take spider genes and put them into goats, so the udders, the breast of the goat, produce body armor, and the goat is now part spider, or you make pigs part human, so you can take their hearts and transplant them in humans.
[02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:30.991]  That was done 20 years ago.
[02:09:32.151 --> 02:09:34.256]  And it causes new viruses.
[02:09:34.937 --> 02:09:39.286]  It allows cross-species, different diseases and viruses to spread.
[02:09:39.747 --> 02:09:41.771]  And this is the real threat.
[02:09:42.739 --> 02:09:43.500]  Societally.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.722]  And you're worried about terrorism or nuclear weapons?
[02:09:46.762 --> 02:09:51.866]  That is nothing compared to genetic engineering, nanotech, and the globalists could care less.
[02:09:51.886 --> 02:10:00.793]  They're just running headlong with all of this and every major GMO crop they bring out, for some reason, happens to reduce fertility in all mammal species.
[02:10:01.313 --> 02:10:08.739]  And you got these big Fortune 100 companies always having conferences about how they want to forcibly put stuff in the water to reduce world population.
[02:10:08.759 --> 02:10:12.322]  The White House science czar writing 1,200-page books about it.
[02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:17.640]  Proposing doing it, they're already doing it through the food.
[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:20.441]  This is being done by design.
[02:10:22.882 --> 02:10:27.304]  Now when we come back, I'm going to get into today's top news.
[02:10:28.425 --> 02:10:37.208]  I believe the establishment is getting ready to stage false flag events, false terror in America, to blame it on conservative libertarian patriot movement.
[02:10:37.714 --> 02:10:41.576]  And again, even Michael Savage has figured this out, and he's talking about this almost every day.
[02:10:41.756 --> 02:10:42.957]  People send me the audio clips.
[02:10:43.657 --> 02:10:53.583]  And if we can get the public to wake up to this tried-and-trusted tool, the czars in Russia a hundred years ago would blow up a building, blame it on their enemies, round up thousands.
[02:10:54.143 --> 02:10:56.084]  The communists did it after the czars left.
[02:10:56.464 --> 02:10:57.105]  Hitler did it.
[02:10:57.805 --> 02:11:01.608]  The Reichstag to launch the war against Poland at Gleiwitz.
[02:11:02.208 --> 02:11:08.993]  Our government has declassified that they do this and they demonize anybody that ever brings up government-sponsored terror.
[02:11:09.594 --> 02:11:16.019]  Anybody who ever brings up the fact that this is possible, that governments have done this in the past and that they have a motive
[02:11:16.519 --> 02:11:21.202]  to stage crises, to scare populations into submission.
[02:11:21.602 --> 02:11:29.007]  But people better wake up to false flag terror and realize it's part of history, it's real, and it goes on.
[02:11:30.108 --> 02:11:33.490]  And if we have a full awakening to this, they won't be able to do this anymore.
[02:11:34.091 --> 02:11:41.255]  That's why they hate 9-11 Truth so much, because it's damaged this program of control that they are engaging in.
[02:11:41.275 --> 02:11:43.217]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:11:44.312 --> 02:11:46.034]  This is the GCN Radio Network.

[02:12:39.282 --> 02:12:39.763]  We're good.
[02:13:03.209 --> 02:13:06.834]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:13:07.235 --> 02:13:10.239]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:11.882]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:15.261]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:13:15.281 --> 02:13:21.463]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:13:21.663 --> 02:13:26.705]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:13:26.725 --> 02:13:36.829]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:13:36.949 --> 02:13:39.050]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:40.630]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:13:40.890 --> 02:13:43.151]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:45.172]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:13:45.192 --> 02:13:50.254]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:13:50.634 --> 02:13:55.396]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:14:01.806 --> 02:14:03.948]  Good day, Peter Krashnebel from Midas Resources.
[02:14:03.989 --> 02:14:04.950]  Today is March 3rd, 2010.
[02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:06.992]  Gold opened this morning at $11.4230.
[02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:11.858]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.7331, $5.8665 for a half ounce, and $2.9333 for a quarter ounce.
[02:14:11.878 --> 02:14:12.338]  $11.7331, $5.8665, and $2.9333.
[02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:35.599]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:14:35.679 --> 02:14:36.660]  Is this capitalism?
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:44.206]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, the central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:14:44.466 --> 02:14:45.387]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:14:45.507 --> 02:14:49.651]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:50.852]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:50.932 --> 02:14:52.113]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:14:52.173 --> 02:14:52.933]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:14:52.994 --> 02:14:53.294]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:15:03.067 --> 02:15:12.414]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[02:15:12.974 --> 02:15:14.636]  If so, you are not alone.
[02:15:15.016 --> 02:15:18.258]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[02:15:18.619 --> 02:15:31.168]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll
[02:15:31.368 --> 02:15:31.708]  I think so.
[02:16:16.412 --> 02:16:17.913]  So the American people are angry.
[02:16:19.174 --> 02:16:23.117]  They know private offshore banks engineered the housing collapse.
[02:16:23.638 --> 02:16:25.979]  Stole tens of trillions of bailout money.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:27.300]  It's not 700 million.
[02:16:29.226 --> 02:16:32.168]  They're discovering that they're being robbed by design.
[02:16:32.188 --> 02:16:33.369]  This is a global move.
[02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:35.590]  World government's being openly announced.
[02:16:35.630 --> 02:16:39.913]  The head of the IMF calls for a new global currency that the banks run and control.
[02:16:41.514 --> 02:16:42.675]  Giving them even more power.
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:46.582]  And what is the system going to do?
[02:16:46.702 --> 02:16:56.793]  When we got the internal homeland security documents, when we got army documents, they're spying on Ron Paul, the tea parties, they've got police with sound cannons and microwave guns out at the events.
[02:16:57.214 --> 02:17:02.259]  Anybody tries to peacefully protest the G20, police dogs are used on old women.
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:06.344]  That's coming up in our film Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:17:08.297 --> 02:17:09.498]  We are the American people.
[02:17:09.558 --> 02:17:10.939]  It's our right to run our government.
[02:17:10.959 --> 02:17:12.720]  It's our right to kick the foreign bankers out.
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:15.462]  It's our right, like Iceland, to say we're not paying back this money.
[02:17:15.502 --> 02:17:16.123]  We don't owe it.
[02:17:17.484 --> 02:17:19.705]  Will we go like Iceland, who's starting to say no?
[02:17:19.825 --> 02:17:27.351]  Or like Greece, openly run by Goldman Sachs, that set them up in the financial derivatives that have now destroyed them?
[02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:39.814]  And so the Republican and Democratic parties are all putting out public statements that we've got to keep extremists out of our parties, these anti-banker people, these anti-Federal Reserve people.
[02:17:40.534 --> 02:17:45.216]  And we've got to do something about them, and they're evil, and the Oath Keepers are bad, and Sheriff Mack is bad.
[02:17:45.536 --> 02:17:48.957]  Why he's going around to sheriffs explaining to them they don't have to go under federal control.
[02:17:50.009 --> 02:17:59.955]  And we've got FEMA and NORTHCOM and Homeland Security and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and PD51 that states the federal government's going to come in and suppress the states.
[02:18:00.735 --> 02:18:15.744]  Because they know the number one move against the New World Order is by the 50 states, one by one, they're starting to do it, to say no to the federal government, no to their high taxes, no to their carbon taxes, no to their unconstitutional regulations.
[02:18:17.369 --> 02:18:19.130]  And so people are waking up.
[02:18:19.731 --> 02:18:21.212]  People are getting angry.
[02:18:22.633 --> 02:18:24.475]  So they're doing a double game here.
[02:18:24.955 --> 02:18:28.838]  You've got, I've heard Pelosi now saying she likes the Tea Party and some of the people in it.
[02:18:28.918 --> 02:18:29.919]  She knows why you're mad.
[02:18:30.199 --> 02:18:31.601]  You're no longer AstroTurf.
[02:18:35.836 --> 02:18:42.899]  You've got, and she said what I meant by that was it's not real grass, it's not real grassroots, not that I'm walking on you.
[02:18:43.559 --> 02:18:47.260]  And we've got Rick Perry saying let's secede, which isn't Tenth Amendment.
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:51.542]  I mean, you could under the Tenth, we're just saying have the states say no to tyranny.
[02:18:52.002 --> 02:18:58.685]  But he's saying secession, fight the New World Order, fight the Bilderberg Group, fight the Trans-Texas Corridor, which he's the author of.
[02:19:00.458 --> 02:19:07.222]  So simultaneously, he got the Republican nomination yesterday by posing as a patriot when he's a consummate insider.
[02:19:08.003 --> 02:19:12.466]  Separately, I heard Kay Bailey Hutchinson's capitulation speech last night.
[02:19:12.506 --> 02:19:15.928]  She thanked George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush.
[02:19:16.268 --> 02:19:19.030]  She thanked Henry Kissinger for all endorsing her.
[02:19:20.111 --> 02:19:21.952]  That does say something for Perry, actually.
[02:19:22.352 --> 02:19:23.133]  But he's bad news.
[02:19:23.173 --> 02:19:29.037]  The point is, he ran with an anti-Washington bent, knowing it was the only way he could win.
[02:19:30.450 --> 02:19:30.831]  Okay.
[02:19:31.952 --> 02:19:34.715]  And so Republicans are kind of this double game.
[02:19:34.855 --> 02:19:44.225]  Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, Governor Perry, and you watch, Perry and Palin are both running for President, guaranteed, in 2012.
[02:19:44.285 --> 02:19:47.268]  They'll announce it in the next year and a half to two years.
[02:19:49.312 --> 02:19:50.632]  They're being positioned right now.
[02:19:51.633 --> 02:20:00.036]  Out of one side of their mouth, they say they lead the Tea Party so they can demonize the birthers and other people they don't like, when that's the majority of the Republican Party's been polled.
[02:20:00.336 --> 02:20:01.816]  They're saying the majority of their party's bad.
[02:20:02.137 --> 02:20:03.477]  They're there as the gatekeepers.
[02:20:04.397 --> 02:20:05.598]  And evidenced, uh...
[02:20:06.687 --> 02:20:14.291]  The evidence of this is, here's a headline, London Guardian, Republican right-wing activists help secure Texas for Rick Perry.
[02:20:15.132 --> 02:20:22.235]  Moderate Republicans face being displaced by candidates backed by Tea Party and other grassroots right-wingers.
[02:20:23.916 --> 02:20:25.537]  What we really are is constitutionalists.
[02:20:25.597 --> 02:20:31.941]  So, the establishment, the New York Times, London Guardian, everywhere is freaking out saying, oh my gosh,
[02:20:33.103 --> 02:20:37.026]  These right-wingers, that's a label to make it left-right and divide and conquer people, no.
[02:20:37.367 --> 02:20:43.392]  We're patriots who are against the foreign corporate takeover known as the New World Order against our country.
[02:20:44.172 --> 02:20:45.373]  Here's a Politico article.
[02:20:45.814 --> 02:20:47.876]  Give me a document can for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:20:48.196 --> 02:20:50.518]  Conservatives target their own fringe.
[02:20:51.218 --> 02:20:58.565]  And this goes on to demonize mainline people like Tom Tancredo, former Republican Congressman
[02:21:00.484 --> 02:21:03.625]  And they're demonizing Ron Paul in these reports.
[02:21:03.685 --> 02:21:04.406]  But here's the deal.
[02:21:04.726 --> 02:21:08.548]  Ron Paul got a record for Texas Republicans.
[02:21:10.048 --> 02:21:21.894]  80% of the vote in the primary with three Republican Party-funded neocons posing as Tea Partiers, showing the public can differentiate a real constitutionalist versus a phony one.
[02:21:22.934 --> 02:21:23.314]  Okay?
[02:21:26.316 --> 02:21:29.037]  When we get back, I want to go over the setup here.
[02:21:29.986 --> 02:21:38.329]  See, the Republicans know that their grassroots is constitutionalist and wants to really take the party over and fix America.
[02:21:38.709 --> 02:21:45.272]  They're there acting enough like us to keep control so they can also demonize through constitutionalists.
[02:21:45.332 --> 02:21:49.774]  Now, they want to set us up, and that'll be with a staged terror attack blamed on the Tea Parties.
[02:21:51.854 --> 02:21:52.775]  We're on the march.
[02:21:53.255 --> 02:21:54.855]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:55.776 --> 02:21:58.457]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:01.369 --> 02:22:06.596]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:22:06.616 --> 02:22:09.400]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:13.806]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:22:16.169 --> 02:22:19.212]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:22:35.286 --> 02:22:36.987]  This film needs to be seen.
[02:22:37.267 --> 02:22:38.168]  Everybody needs to get it.

[02:23:01.158 --> 02:23:05.379]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:06.300]  Number one.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:09.761]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:23:10.041 --> 02:23:10.601]  Number two.
[02:23:10.881 --> 02:23:15.443]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:23:15.783 --> 02:23:16.243]  It's true.
[02:23:16.523 --> 02:23:21.065]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:23:21.385 --> 02:23:21.946]  Number 3.
[02:23:22.206 --> 02:23:25.509]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:23:25.809 --> 02:23:29.513]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:23:29.733 --> 02:23:30.273]  Number 4.
[02:23:30.514 --> 02:23:32.896]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:23:33.276 --> 02:23:36.679]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:37.180]  Number 5.
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:41.684]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:23:41.884 --> 02:23:46.669]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:23:46.949 --> 02:23:50.953]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:24:01.752 --> 02:24:08.594]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:24:08.734 --> 02:24:10.694]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:24:10.834 --> 02:24:12.955]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:24:13.055 --> 02:24:14.575]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:24:14.716 --> 02:24:19.037]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:24:45.569 --> 02:24:49.291]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:24:49.311 --> 02:24:49.511]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:25:06.103 --> 02:25:18.093]  So they've had Republican Party spokesman Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, and everybody else demonize the birthers because they're really worried about more than half Republicans in polls questioning his birth certificate.
[02:25:18.914 --> 02:25:19.954]  At the same time,
[02:25:24.292 --> 02:25:29.976]  They're not having success demonizing the American people and folks that are identifying the new world order.
[02:25:30.196 --> 02:25:39.042]  They're openly announcing world government, but then calling it a conspiracy theory if we don't like it and don't want an unelected, tyrannical world government ruling our lives.
[02:25:40.483 --> 02:25:47.707]  And so if you go back to Oklahoma City and other events, the government clearly orchestrated and provocateured that event.
[02:25:47.887 --> 02:25:52.851]  Paul Watson has an article that breaks all of this down.
[02:25:54.226 --> 02:25:58.848]  That is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:58.908 --> 02:26:01.789]  It's titled, Southern Poverty Law Center Report.
[02:26:02.269 --> 02:26:04.229]  Heavy on smear, thin on facts.
[02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:09.771]  And it goes into the government documents and mainstream news articles about the FBI being in Oklahoma City.
[02:26:10.532 --> 02:26:14.133]  Sworn federal affidavits that they were running McVeigh, that he was a federal officer.
[02:26:14.813 --> 02:26:15.613]  It's all in here.
[02:26:15.693 --> 02:26:17.194]  So I can tell you politically
[02:26:18.476 --> 02:26:34.154]  That I am seeing the media put out the talking point through right wing and left wing establishment news channels, predominantly cable news, and we have Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations czar, saying we can provocateur events, criminal events,
[02:26:35.171 --> 02:26:37.892]  And blame it on our political opposition.
[02:26:38.352 --> 02:26:52.338]  And there's no way they're going to be able to make everybody feel sorry for the government and have the pretext for the police state and to openly roll out homeland security against conservatives and libertarians and gun owners that their internal reports say they're really set up for.
[02:26:52.398 --> 02:26:53.218]  That's their main mission.
[02:26:54.568 --> 02:27:09.460]  There's no way they're going to get away with this without staging events in this country against IRS buildings, against government buildings, against capitals, state capitals, federal capital in DC, against the military.
[02:27:10.276 --> 02:27:16.660]  So the government can feel sorry for itself and believe there's a real threat out there, and then demonize the Patriot movement.
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:24.826]  Because the Patriot movement that's been around for decades has been right about the world government, did their research, understand the threat we're facing.
[02:27:25.466 --> 02:27:29.829]  And folks, there's all these neocon publications that are attacking me.
[02:27:32.526 --> 02:27:35.849]  I mean, the big GOP news site did it.
[02:27:36.509 --> 02:27:43.435]  Cliff Kincaid, who by the way, I want to get on and debate this guy, demonizing oath keepers as extremists when they're milquetoast.
[02:27:43.475 --> 02:27:45.517]  I mean, they just call for following their oath.
[02:27:49.082 --> 02:27:52.124]  It's incredible, and you see top Republican strategists.
[02:27:52.144 --> 02:27:53.465]  In fact, here's the Politico headline.
[02:27:53.745 --> 02:27:55.446]  Conservatives target their own fringe.
[02:27:55.806 --> 02:28:02.811]  So you've got Glenn Beck and Chris Matthews on some shows we've played clips of here, mirroring the exact talking points.
[02:28:02.851 --> 02:28:06.894]  Because the Republicans and Democrats work for the same big establishment.
[02:28:07.354 --> 02:28:11.057]  And it's their job to create the illusion of choice and to manage the public.
[02:28:11.477 --> 02:28:17.141]  Now, I want to play a few minutes of this MSNBC report with Potok of the Southern Slime Center.
[02:28:18.121 --> 02:28:23.524]  Uh, demonizing people, and in the report, again, mainline Republican congressmen are demonized.
[02:28:24.104 --> 02:28:25.404]  Mainline Americans.
[02:28:25.605 --> 02:28:26.725]  Just mainline.
[02:28:26.765 --> 02:28:30.827]  You criticize anything the government's doing, you may be a dangerous terrorist.
[02:28:31.487 --> 02:28:33.008]  Uh, so let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:28:34.382 --> 02:28:44.515]  Right-wing extremist groups have gained even more support in the USA over the last year, fueled in part by anger over the troubled economy, the nation's first black president, and immigration issues.
[02:28:44.535 --> 02:28:53.205]  It's raising concerns over a potential rise in anti-government violence, like that deadly attack on an IRS building in Texas last week.
[02:28:53.686 --> 02:28:59.555]  I'm joined by Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the author of the annual report, Rage on the Right.
[02:28:59.916 --> 02:29:07.347]  What stands out to you this year in terms of these groups who are truly angry at the way they see the government acting?
[02:29:09.699 --> 02:29:12.802]  Really, what stands out the most is just the scope of the thing.
[02:29:13.062 --> 02:29:18.747]  I mean, there has been an enormous growth in groups on the radical right of all kinds in the last year.
[02:29:18.767 --> 02:29:27.835]  You know, when we look at the whole picture, though, the most astounding growth has come in the so-called Patriot groups, the militias that all of us remember from the 1990s.
[02:29:29.096 --> 02:29:33.398]  You know, these groups have very largely, if not disappeared, at least gone quiescent.
[02:29:33.958 --> 02:29:38.241]  But what we found was 363 new groups in the last year.
[02:29:38.261 --> 02:29:39.241]  That's a 244% increase.
[02:29:39.441 --> 02:29:39.881]  Oh no!
[02:29:40.142 --> 02:29:42.203]  In a single year.
[02:29:42.303 --> 02:29:46.485]  And at the same time, we saw a lot of growth in other types of groups.
[02:29:46.525 --> 02:29:47.845]  Americans are getting upset!
[02:29:47.905 --> 02:29:49.066]  How dare they?
[02:29:49.166 --> 02:29:49.866]  Patriot groups.
[02:29:49.926 --> 02:29:50.887]  I mean, are these just...
[02:29:51.107 --> 02:29:52.688]  As they show a smoking IRS building.
[02:29:52.728 --> 02:29:56.890]  What is it about them that concerns you in terms of the threat they represent against America?
[02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:59.231]  Because he's high up on the mountain and he tells us what to do.
[02:29:59.691 --> 02:30:06.654]  Well, the self-named Patriot Movement is really the movement of which the paramilitary wing was the malicious.
[02:30:07.275 --> 02:30:15.359]  So, you know, basically the Patriot Movement is a movement that sees the federal government as its primary enemy and believes that the government is involved in all that.
[02:30:15.379 --> 02:30:16.379]  By the way, our whole country is going bankrupt.
[02:30:16.399 --> 02:30:17.640]  There's 30 million illegal aliens.
[02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:22.864]  He says you're able if you don't want open borders, but Mexico will arrest you for no reason.
[02:30:34.512 --> 02:30:36.834]  The Southern Robbery Law Center's and federal documents part of.
[02:30:52.762 --> 02:30:54.263]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[02:30:54.303 --> 02:30:55.644]  We built our whole country without it.
[02:30:56.044 --> 02:30:58.246]  Most Americans didn't pay it until the 1950s.
[02:30:58.406 --> 02:31:02.449]  It goes to offshore banks on interest on imaginary debt.
[02:31:03.210 --> 02:31:06.812]  For our country to create money, debt is created to private banks.
[02:31:08.593 --> 02:31:09.554]  And that's all this guy is.
[02:31:09.614 --> 02:31:11.115]  Oh, you don't want foreign banks ruling you?
[02:31:11.335 --> 02:31:12.316]  You're an extremist.
[02:31:12.916 --> 02:31:13.377]  Continue.
[02:31:15.589 --> 02:31:17.329]  The investigators produced a lot of havoc.
[02:31:17.409 --> 02:31:21.870]  You know, the investigators in that case, Mark, characterized that as criminal activity.
[02:31:22.851 --> 02:31:30.632]  But what we saw in the 1990s with Timothy McVeigh and what happened in Oklahoma City at the Murrah Federal Building was very similar.
[02:31:30.672 --> 02:31:37.414]  A vehicle being used to attack a government building because of anti-government extremism.
[02:31:37.514 --> 02:31:40.094]  Are you concerned about domestic terrorism?
[02:31:40.134 --> 02:31:42.935]  And are you concerned that the reluctance on the part of investigators
[02:31:43.475 --> 02:31:54.124]  Well, look, in the Joseph Stack case, one could argue about it, because there's certainly evidence in both directions.
[02:31:55.024 --> 02:32:06.213]  Joseph Stack was a man, according to his kind of suicide note, who was angry at a lot of things, the Catholic Church, unions, corporations, and so on, but he kept circling back to the idea of
[02:32:06.653 --> 02:32:09.635]  It was the IRS and the government was the enemy.
[02:32:10.035 --> 02:32:10.936]  So am I concerned?
[02:32:11.016 --> 02:32:12.057]  Yes, I am concerned.
[02:32:12.077 --> 02:32:15.499]  We've seen a great deal of at least attempted domestic terrorism.
[02:32:16.239 --> 02:32:19.241]  I think an obvious rise over the last 12 to 18 months.
[02:32:19.282 --> 02:32:25.185]  A lot of that has been connected to the essentially the rise to the White House of a black man.
[02:32:25.225 --> 02:32:34.091]  There are many people who are angry about that and also angry about the demographic change that definitely is occurring in this country.
[02:32:34.191 --> 02:32:34.912]  Immigration.
[02:32:34.952 --> 02:32:36.373]  Yes, I worry about that.
[02:32:36.533 --> 02:32:37.293]  So there you go.
[02:32:37.874 --> 02:32:41.675]  You don't like paying for 30 million illegal aliens, basically all on welfare.
[02:32:42.035 --> 02:32:44.336]  All the studies show sucking more money than they put in.
[02:32:45.096 --> 02:32:46.457]  You don't like the police state.
[02:32:46.497 --> 02:32:48.157]  You don't like banks stealing trillions.
[02:32:48.438 --> 02:32:49.638]  You don't like losing your job.
[02:32:49.718 --> 02:32:51.139]  It's all because Obama's black.
[02:32:51.179 --> 02:32:51.859]  You're a racist.
[02:32:52.259 --> 02:32:54.280]  Meanwhile, the left never tells you that they fund...
[02:32:55.160 --> 02:32:57.302]  The abortions of more than half of the black people.
[02:32:57.862 --> 02:33:00.244]  Less than half the blacks that are conceived are born.
[02:33:00.584 --> 02:33:03.186]  But let's not talk about 16 million black people killed.
[02:33:03.426 --> 02:33:05.627]  Let's just say, oh, you don't like the banks raping you?
[02:33:05.948 --> 02:33:07.128]  You don't like black people.
[02:33:07.168 --> 02:33:08.349]  This is a poverty pimp.
[02:33:08.690 --> 02:33:09.770]  This is a race baiter.
[02:33:10.050 --> 02:33:11.231]  This is what they do.
[02:33:11.672 --> 02:33:12.812]  This is how they operate.
[02:33:12.852 --> 02:33:14.814]  These people are sickening.
[02:33:16.590 --> 02:33:17.931]  And they're going to stage events.
[02:33:17.991 --> 02:33:22.572]  The establishment is going to stage events so they can play the part of the good guys and demonize everybody.
[02:33:22.592 --> 02:33:25.213]  So that's why we need to be non-violent, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:25.994 --> 02:33:31.076]  But if the CPS is dragging your kids away for no reason, or they're rape rooms, you defend yourself, it's called terrorism.
[02:33:31.676 --> 02:33:37.279]  You tell a census worker you're not going to answer all their questions about your Fifth Amendment, you're a terrorist.
[02:33:37.879 --> 02:33:40.360]  You don't like the Federal Reserve raping you, you're a terrorist.
[02:33:41.161 --> 02:33:43.662]  You don't like being a slave, you're a terrorist.
[02:33:44.082 --> 02:33:49.405]  You don't like the government ignoring the Constitution and warrantless wiretaps of the Patriot Act, you're an evil terrorist.
[02:33:50.185 --> 02:33:53.527]  You don't like the IRS taking your property without due process, you're a terrorist.
[02:33:53.807 --> 02:33:56.268]  You don't submit to everything they're saying and doing, you're a terrorist.
[02:33:56.809 --> 02:33:58.489]  And you know, this ties together.
[02:33:59.810 --> 02:34:09.067]  I've seen a few mainstream news articles misquoting me, saying Jones says the Haiti earthquake was a government weather weapon.
[02:34:09.753 --> 02:34:11.535]  I mean, that's the type of stuff they're throwing at me.
[02:34:12.136 --> 02:34:16.441]  So I thought that I would talk a little bit about this today.
[02:34:16.481 --> 02:34:21.707]  In fact, I'm going to play one of the caller questions that we had come in.
[02:34:22.147 --> 02:34:24.049]  The first one was from Cheryl.
[02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:30.116]  The caller asked if Alex believes the sudden onset of earthquakes may be related to HAARP.
[02:34:30.757 --> 02:34:39.645]  Now it was Hugo Chavez reportedly said he thought that could be a weather weapon and the reason I talk about this sometimes is Secretary of Defense Cohen told Army Times in 97 they have these weapons.
[02:34:40.842 --> 02:34:41.322]  I don't know.
[02:34:41.942 --> 02:34:48.144]  Other people have been pointing out that you keep seeing lights in the skies over places that are hit, but you've got giant tectonic plates.
[02:34:48.764 --> 02:34:51.865]  When you walk across the floor and there's static electricity, you can shock yourself.
[02:34:52.405 --> 02:34:54.226]  Well, imagine giant plates are moving.
[02:34:54.846 --> 02:35:00.467]  The Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere is caused by the magnetic field from the mass of the Earth.
[02:35:00.887 --> 02:35:04.749]  So, of course, you're going to see an aurora, and this has been reported for more than a hundred years.
[02:35:04.809 --> 02:35:09.130]  So, just because they're seeing lights in the sky over Haiti or over Chile,
[02:35:10.850 --> 02:35:12.511]  Doesn't mean that these are weather weapons.
[02:35:12.591 --> 02:35:13.751]  And there, I've said it again.
[02:35:14.052 --> 02:35:16.473]  The news will say that I'm saying it was a weather weapon.
[02:35:16.953 --> 02:35:18.874]  But let's go ahead and play this lady's question.
[02:35:18.934 --> 02:35:19.214]  Here it is.
[02:35:19.234 --> 02:35:21.115]  Hi, my name is Cheryl.
[02:35:22.255 --> 02:35:31.299]  And after this flurry of earthquakes, I became very concerned because I find it very unusual, the size and the frequency.
[02:35:32.759 --> 02:35:38.842]  So I looked it up on the Internet about any possible cause man-made.
[02:35:39.403 --> 02:35:50.687]  And I came across the HARPS project and read about some of the Jesse Ventura comments on it.
[02:35:51.448 --> 02:35:56.330]  Anyway, I wanted to find out if you believe in HARPS as contributing to the recent earthquakes.
[02:35:56.490 --> 02:35:56.810]  Thank you.
[02:35:57.828 --> 02:36:01.130]  Okay, we know that the government says they have this power.
[02:36:01.411 --> 02:36:02.972]  That's on record, over and over again.
[02:36:03.252 --> 02:36:06.274]  We know they now admit they're chemtrailing geoengineering the planet.
[02:36:06.594 --> 02:36:10.217]  Just go to YouTube, type in geoengineering John P. Holdren.
[02:36:10.237 --> 02:36:11.798]  You'll see White House press conferences.
[02:36:12.459 --> 02:36:15.621]  But no, we don't know if this is man-made or not.
[02:36:15.681 --> 02:36:16.722]  It's probably natural.
[02:36:17.984 --> 02:36:23.188]  The bigger issue is, notice the government can't and won't protect you, whether it's Katrina or any of these events.
[02:36:23.548 --> 02:36:25.389]  You've got to be ready to take care of yourself.
[02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:37.558]  But I do want to play this MSNBC clip where one of the witnesses did see these bizarre lights in the sky, and a lot of people reported this before the Chilean mega 8.0 plus earthquake.
[02:36:37.578 --> 02:36:37.939]  Here it is.
[02:36:38.968 --> 02:36:43.791]  Joining us now live from Santiago, Chile via Skype is freelance journalist Cecilia Lagos.
[02:36:43.811 --> 02:36:45.272]  Cecilia, good morning to you.
[02:36:45.292 --> 02:36:46.853]  Let's get the very latest from your vantage point.
[02:36:46.873 --> 02:36:49.294]  What are you seeing and what did you feel earlier today?
[02:36:50.595 --> 02:36:51.936]  Well, good afternoon here.
[02:36:51.956 --> 02:36:54.137]  It's 1.10 p.m.
[02:36:54.197 --> 02:37:01.022]  here in Chile and this whole thing happened at our time was 3.30 a.m.
[02:37:01.442 --> 02:37:02.002]  in the morning.
[02:37:02.282 --> 02:37:06.085]  I was sleeping as most of us, of course, here in the country.
[02:37:07.045 --> 02:37:21.972]  And all of a sudden I started feeling this tremor, and since we're really used to tremors, because this is a land of earthquakes, just as the Central America is a land of hurricanes and tornadoes, for example, this is a land of earthquakes and tremors.
[02:37:22.032 --> 02:37:26.514]  So I just said to myself, OK, I'm not going to do anything until it gets really serious.
[02:37:26.954 --> 02:37:30.916]  And well, it did get serious, but I still was laying in bed.
[02:37:30.936 --> 02:37:34.518]  I was just so shocked, because I was totally paralyzed.
[02:37:35.298 --> 02:37:46.246]  I didn't really know what to do because I was expecting all of a sudden, you know, you see my neighbor maybe getting through from the roof to my floor or whatever.
[02:37:46.826 --> 02:37:55.072]  It was so, so intense and I was seeing the sky changing colors and it was really sort of apocalypse now thing.
[02:37:55.912 --> 02:38:04.218]  So Cecilia, that sounds pretty frightening, but was it a sharp jolt or did it just sort of build and how long did this last?
[02:38:05.418 --> 02:38:29.471]  Well, I've been discussing the duration, the lasting of the earthquake, because for me it was sort of short, maybe no more than 40 seconds or so, especially the intense, the more intense part, probably half a minute, as I said, no more than 40 seconds, but the whole thing, which starts really...
[02:38:30.091 --> 02:38:33.592]  You can watch the whole clip where she talks about lights in the sky.
[02:38:34.032 --> 02:38:36.113]  The point is, we don't know if that's the case.
[02:38:37.654 --> 02:38:40.935]  Let's go ahead and play another clip from a caller from Quebec, Canada.
[02:38:41.475 --> 02:38:47.377]  Caller asks if the Copenhagen tax is passing in a form of gas tax in Quebec.
[02:38:47.738 --> 02:38:48.938]  Let's go ahead and play that question.
[02:38:48.978 --> 02:38:49.358]  Here it is.
[02:38:50.138 --> 02:38:50.939]  Greetings, Mr. Jones.
[02:38:50.999 --> 02:38:54.300]  I just wanted to inform you on the globalist agenda here in Quebec.
[02:38:55.472 --> 02:38:56.253]  Quebec just passed.
[02:38:56.293 --> 02:38:58.553]  Quebec is in the eastern part of Canada.
[02:38:58.573 --> 02:39:07.557]  They just passed regulation, even though the rest of Canada and Quebec on a local level passed regulation that's going to increase gas prices by 12 cents.
[02:39:07.597 --> 02:39:09.757]  That's the Copenhagen tax.
[02:39:09.778 --> 02:39:10.618]  So, thank you for your time.
[02:39:10.658 --> 02:39:10.858]  Bye.
[02:39:12.353 --> 02:39:13.054]  Absolutely.
[02:39:13.194 --> 02:39:14.355]  Hundreds of taxes.
[02:39:14.475 --> 02:39:17.277]  Cities, counties, states here are doing it outside the law.
[02:39:17.297 --> 02:39:20.960]  Obama's using the EPA without any law to just do it.
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:25.243]  Incidentally, I'm going to have Burma sit in for about 20 minutes on the cybersecurity bill tomorrow.
[02:39:26.003 --> 02:39:28.205]  I want to be able to go to some actual phone callers here in a minute.
[02:39:28.505 --> 02:39:33.849]  But we do, from time to time, play calls from the comment line, which is 512-646-4444.
[02:39:36.851 --> 02:39:40.834]  Now, let's go ahead and play one final comment or question from Robert.
[02:39:41.235 --> 02:39:43.977]  He asks if governments can call the National Guard troops home.
[02:39:44.037 --> 02:39:44.437]  Here it is.
[02:39:45.017 --> 02:39:47.259]  Alex Jones, this is Robert from Utah.
[02:39:48.039 --> 02:39:50.421]  I have one major request, hopefully.
[02:39:51.102 --> 02:39:52.643]  It can be done by somebody that might listen.
[02:39:54.104 --> 02:39:56.365]  Can the governors call our troops home?
[02:39:56.746 --> 02:39:58.667]  Can the governor call our National Guard troops home?
[02:39:58.947 --> 02:40:02.030]  I mean, I believe we're on the verge of a civil war.
[02:40:02.390 --> 02:40:03.871]  Can we get our Utah troops home?
[02:40:06.829 --> 02:40:23.092]  Now, to answer that question, yes, until they put in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act in 2007, that they've reauthorized since then, saying that the President and the Congress can remove governors and appoint governors and controls the National Guard.
[02:40:23.512 --> 02:40:26.533]  This is the total illegal federalization of everything.
[02:40:26.933 --> 02:40:28.493]  Now let's go to live phone calls.
[02:40:28.833 --> 02:40:30.814]  Let's talk to Ray in Texas.
[02:40:31.234 --> 02:40:32.174]  Ray, you're on the air.
[02:40:32.234 --> 02:40:32.874]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:34.034 --> 02:40:35.254]  Thank you very much, sir.
[02:40:35.515 --> 02:40:42.837]  I voted for Deborah Medina yesterday, and like a lot of the other info warriors out there, I was pretty discouraged.
[02:40:42.877 --> 02:40:46.498]  You know, we understand the hit piece that was played on there by Glenn Beck.
[02:40:47.499 --> 02:40:55.441]  But that being said, I want to know, can we be sure that Glenn Beck is an actual, I guess, a conscious tool for the globalists?
[02:40:56.142 --> 02:41:00.143]  Or is it possible that he sincerely believes the things he's saying, however disillusioned he may be?
[02:41:01.598 --> 02:41:03.899]  Well, your phone is really bad, Ray.
[02:41:03.939 --> 02:41:06.299]  Specifically, are you saying... What are you saying?
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:14.781]  I want to know if Glenn Beck is actually a tool for the globalists... Alright, alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:15.161 --> 02:41:16.742]  It's nice to get a prank call.
[02:41:18.622 --> 02:41:20.283]  Whatever that does, sir.
[02:41:21.883 --> 02:41:25.144]  Look, Glenn Beck
[02:41:26.547 --> 02:41:26.727]  Hi Alex.
[02:41:26.847 --> 02:41:27.988]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that
[02:41:54.099 --> 02:42:07.170]  We need to really, like you've said, be pretty wary when they start to really push the Iran thing and start to really, you know, make a lot of mentions of Iran and stirring up that whole pot.
[02:42:08.491 --> 02:42:13.755]  Yeah, seven years ago we heard all about the WMDs and here we are again hearing about WMDs.
[02:42:14.656 --> 02:42:17.458]  Right, yeah, and somehow people just don't get it.
[02:42:18.059 --> 02:42:20.681]  Oh, that thing again, well maybe this time it's true.
[02:42:21.794 --> 02:42:45.929]  Uh, but yeah, I think they'll probably, you know, my guess is they're going to try to push some sort of staged event that ultimately they're going to be able to try and blame on Iran and somehow tie in with the mythical domestic terrorists so that they can get more enforcement here at home on top of whatever they would normally do and then
[02:42:46.658 --> 02:42:49.260]  And then push their illegal war with Iran.
[02:43:02.082 --> 02:43:02.843]  We're good to go.
[02:43:18.677 --> 02:43:19.057]  I think so.
[02:43:44.568 --> 02:43:47.690]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:43:47.730 --> 02:43:50.152]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:43:50.192 --> 02:43:52.013]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:44:12.210 --> 02:44:14.851]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:14.871 --> 02:44:21.134]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:21.275 --> 02:44:26.297]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:26.637 --> 02:44:36.422]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:36.562 --> 02:44:38.664]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:44:38.904 --> 02:44:40.245]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:40.506 --> 02:44:42.768]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:42.948 --> 02:44:44.789]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:45.090 --> 02:44:49.894]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:50.234 --> 02:44:54.998]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:45:30.851 --> 02:45:40.137]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:45:40.177 --> 02:45:40.898]  This capitalism?
[02:45:40.958 --> 02:45:47.102]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:45:47.242 --> 02:45:48.063]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:45:48.103 --> 02:45:51.205]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:45:51.365 --> 02:45:52.145]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:45:52.165 --> 02:45:53.226]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:45:53.366 --> 02:45:53.846]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:45:53.886 --> 02:45:54.167]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:46:04.334 --> 02:46:09.658]  Look at who the Southern Poverty Law Center demonizes as if they're terrorists and says they may go after people.
[02:46:10.399 --> 02:46:13.121]  The Constitution Party, they list each state.
[02:46:13.521 --> 02:46:16.944]  The John Birch Society, Oath Keepers, We the People.
[02:46:18.513 --> 02:46:21.996]  I mean, most of these are just completely... I mean, I wish they were more radical.
[02:46:23.317 --> 02:46:26.740]  I mean, all they're doing is exposing the private IRS, the private Federal Reserve.
[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:32.645]  They list We Are Change, which is an anti-globalist group, completely peaceful, alternative media.
[02:46:33.165 --> 02:46:36.828]  I mean, look, they want you to sit down and shut up, or they're going to call you names.
[02:46:37.289 --> 02:46:40.792]  But the good news is, nobody listens to POTOC and all these people anymore.
[02:46:41.072 --> 02:46:41.953]  They're discredited.
[02:46:42.213 --> 02:46:44.475]  The American people are learning who their real enemies are.
[02:46:44.815 --> 02:46:47.517]  So go ahead and stage terror attacks, feds, on yourselves.
[02:46:47.957 --> 02:46:52.700]  And of course, you'll always get the warning to be out of the building, and other feds will notice that.
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.201]  Or the husbands and wives of people you kill.
[02:46:55.442 --> 02:46:58.724]  We wish you wouldn't do it, but we just know how you are and what you're going to do.
[02:46:59.164 --> 02:47:00.865]  And the word's out on you, scum!
[02:47:02.886 --> 02:47:04.307]  Alright, let's go to Nick and Mask.
[02:47:04.387 --> 02:47:05.108]  Nick, you're on the air.
[02:47:05.148 --> 02:47:05.468]  Welcome.
[02:47:06.263 --> 02:47:07.584]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:47:07.944 --> 02:47:10.005]  I just want to cover two things quickly.
[02:47:10.205 --> 02:47:15.648]  One, about the terrorist event that you're speaking of, and also about the earthquakes.
[02:47:16.289 --> 02:47:18.570]  This is Nick from lookupandwakeup.org.
[02:47:18.930 --> 02:47:20.991]  It's about the terrorist attack.
[02:47:21.111 --> 02:47:25.314]  I know they like numerology, like the Illuminati and the elites.
[02:47:25.774 --> 02:47:26.514]  I want to just give you a date.
[02:47:26.534 --> 02:47:26.574]  3-8-2010.
[02:47:26.594 --> 02:47:26.854]  3-8 is 11.
[02:47:26.894 --> 02:47:27.435]  3-8-2010 is 23.
[02:47:27.495 --> 02:47:28.415]  And about the earthquakes,
[02:47:35.785 --> 02:47:45.827]  I've been looking at the earthquake.usgs.gov government site and, you know, reading about earthquakes in Japan, Chile, Philippines, yadda yadda.
[02:47:46.148 --> 02:47:48.888]  But I've been seeing a lot of recent activity in California.
[02:47:49.248 --> 02:47:54.630]  In the Haiti earthquakes, the epicenter, the depth of the epicenter was about 10 kilometers, they list.
[02:47:55.270 --> 02:47:58.350]  And the one in Chile was 30 kilometers deep.
[02:47:58.971 --> 02:48:01.851]  Now, obviously there were 8.8 and 7.0, whatever it was.
[02:48:02.351 --> 02:48:04.712]  But the California epicenters, the depth,
[02:48:05.504 --> 02:48:19.078]  of their earthquakes are 1.9 kilometers deep, 2.5, .9, 2.2, 2.5, even though their earthquakes are pretty small, if there is a chance of a large earthquake in California
[02:48:20.912 --> 02:48:25.794]  The epicenter doesn't look like it's going to be too deep, so I think... Alright, I've got a job, I've got to get to other callers, but I appreciate your call.
[02:48:26.194 --> 02:48:28.695]  Look, the Earth has natural earthquakes, is all I'm saying.
[02:48:28.975 --> 02:48:30.396]  Everything doesn't have to be a conspiracy.
[02:48:30.956 --> 02:48:34.377]  But it is true, the government admits they have these weapons, so it could be, I don't know.
[02:48:34.998 --> 02:48:35.658]  We're watching it.
[02:48:35.978 --> 02:48:36.518]  Thank you, Nick.
[02:48:37.239 --> 02:48:38.959]  Tim in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:40.940]  Hey Alex, how's it going today?
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:41.600]  Good.
[02:48:42.581 --> 02:48:46.062]  Good, well, my question is, I've been listening to your show a lot lately, and
[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:55.408]  I know it's a key point you and along with Bob and Webster and a couple other guys make on the air is going through this revolution against, you know, these criminals.
[02:48:56.288 --> 02:48:58.070]  We need to go about this in a peaceful manner.
[02:48:58.230 --> 02:49:08.399]  My question is, how far are we going to let these guys, you know, go and get away with stuff before the violence, you know, it really needs to start taking effect?
[02:49:08.439 --> 02:49:10.161]  I mean, it's just a matter of time.
[02:49:10.441 --> 02:49:11.262]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:49:11.282 --> 02:49:13.083]  We're defeating their Copenhagen Treaty.
[02:49:13.103 --> 02:49:15.085]  We're defeating their swine flu fraud.
[02:49:15.385 --> 02:49:17.787]  We're defeating all their hoaxes, their health care.
[02:49:18.127 --> 02:49:24.773]  So if we're holding them back peacefully and starting to have traction, and they're going, oh, they're going to be violent, oh, they're going to be violent.
[02:49:24.793 --> 02:49:27.134]  We know the feds always stage attacks against themselves.
[02:49:27.355 --> 02:49:28.736]  They've been caught over and over again.
[02:49:29.256 --> 02:49:31.558]  It isn't smart strategically to start violence.
[02:49:31.798 --> 02:49:32.098]  And plus,
[02:49:32.839 --> 02:49:34.159]  I mean, who do you target?
[02:49:34.459 --> 02:49:36.720]  Most of the people in government are idiots like the general public.
[02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:45.502]  We have to reach out and wake people up peacefully, but also defend ourselves from tyranny and expose tyranny so people know how to recognize it.
[02:49:45.522 --> 02:49:46.422]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:47.203 --> 02:49:50.643]  We should have a whole show sometime debating this and opening the phones up about it.
[02:49:51.224 --> 02:49:54.004]  Spirit of 1776, last caller we have time for.
[02:49:54.064 --> 02:49:54.424]  Go ahead.
[02:49:55.145 --> 02:50:01.006]  Hey Alex, this is the Spirit of 1776 and thank you so much for inspiring us and our movement on Long Island.
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:11.127]  I just wanted to say that this Dylan Rattigan piece that you have on PrisonPlanet.com exposing another shill who's demonizing the Tea Party movement.
[02:50:11.187 --> 02:50:16.371]  I just wanted to thank you for all your efforts, and may the spirit of liberty and freedom live on forever.
[02:50:17.172 --> 02:50:18.293]  All right, God bless you, my friend.
[02:50:18.313 --> 02:50:20.334]  We'll be back tomorrow, live, 11 a.m.
[02:50:20.354 --> 02:50:20.855]  to 3 p.m.
[02:50:20.895 --> 02:50:21.375]  Central.
[02:50:22.076 --> 02:50:27.220]  That is, what, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:27.700]  Eastern.
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:29.381]  And I meant to plug, we're now on
[02:50:31.537 --> 02:50:33.840]  XM Radio weeknights for one hour.
[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:37.145]  We hope they expand it on channel 158 8 p.m.
[02:50:37.205 --> 02:50:37.585]  Central.
[02:50:38.086 --> 02:50:38.867]  Great job crew.
[02:50:38.887 --> 02:50:41.010]  Free transmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:41.811 --> 02:50:46.217]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over
[02:50:51.286 --> 02:50:55.292]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
