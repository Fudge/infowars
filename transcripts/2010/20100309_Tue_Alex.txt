[00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.702]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:11.304]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:12.225]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:17.049]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:21.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:33.321]  It's Tuesday, ladies and gentlemen, the ninth day of March 2010.
[00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:37.985]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:46.632]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer of Able Danger with new information on government prior knowledge and involvement in 9-11.
[00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:51.836]  Joining us coming up in an hour and a half, Chris Pinto with his new film.
[00:00:53.493 --> 00:01:17.959]  We'll be coming on the broadcast, coming up in the third hour, and then Birgitta Jones-Dottir, member of the Icelandic Parliament, fresh off their victory against the bankers, sending shockwaves politically and economically across the world, will be joining us from Iceland via video uplink in the last hour of this broadcast today.
[00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:28.408]  We're going to cover a ton of important news in the first hour and a half before Anthony Schaefer joins us, Colonel Schaefer.
[00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:33.310]  And we're going to also have open phones on any issue you wish to discuss.
[00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:48.538]  You know, they've got a bill to arrest citizens for any reason the president deems with no due process or no evidence of a crime to secretly be held and, quote, interrogated with enhanced interrogation techniques, i.e.
[00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:48.918]  torture.
[00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:53.915]  I would hope that callers would want to call in and give me their take on that.
[00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:59.200]  They're also back with new amnesty, open border legislation, and a lot more.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.381]  Here is the toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.673]  But don't get mad when I cut you off after a minute because I want to get more people involved on air.
[00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:18.098]  I'm doing a bit of a better job in the last year actually going to more calls and when I do go to calls moving through them as quickly as possible.
[00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:18.158]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.481]  Okay, where to start?
[00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:31.004]  Coming up, ID card for workers is at center of immigration plan, Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:39.750]  Now, three years ago, with the last amnesty plan, that's what this was, a hemispheric North American Union SPP ID card.
[00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:47.115]  Which legalizes the illegal aliens and then makes citizens have a federally issued ID card to be able to have jobs.
[00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:55.838]  And then if you haven't paid your taxes or aren't in good graces with the lordships that run our country, then they turn your card off.
[00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:59.520]  And Kurt Nemo's written a key article.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.062]  Schumer Graham used immigration to push national biometric ID card.
[00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:06.243]  InfoWars.com.
[00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:16.482]  And I dug into the archives to pull up this article from 2006 from Human Events, just to show you it's the same system they've been pushing all along.
[00:03:16.482 --> 00:03:20.383]  Are you ready for your North American Union ID card?
[00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:34.547]  And the last year they're running TV ads where don't just get a passport, get your new North American Union ID card that the Mexican, federal, here in this country, and the federal government in Canada are all issuing.
[00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.112]  So we're going to break that down today.
[00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:41.733]  Also another key article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:49.637]  CNN lavishes Coffee Party with favorable coverage after a year of Tea Party demonization.
[00:03:49.637 --> 00:03:56.860]  It is openly run by a former New York Times PR operative and Obama operative.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.361]  And I watched videos of it last night from CNN.
[00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:02.072]  It's a bunch of illegal aliens.
[00:04:02.072 --> 00:04:04.534]  Remember all the illegal aliens by the millions protesting?
[00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:06.056]  That's who she's organizing.
[00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:17.126]  They bring in a foreign group, a foreign force, give them all this free welfare, let them vote illegally all over the country, and now they're organizing them into an army to counter the American people.
[00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:20.063]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:22.484]  Also on health care, ABC News gets it right.
[00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:24.604]  A complicated enemy is the headline.
[00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:29.445]  Obama seeks to vilify health insurers, gives them $336 billion check.
[00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:32.265]  The insurance companies wrote the legislation.
[00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:36.166]  So when Obama comes out and attacks them, that's to give it fake populist cover.
[00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.686]  Like, let's get those rich, greedy insurance companies.
[00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:44.887]  Let's give them more money of your tax dollars, make you buy it, and then cut the benefits you get and cut your Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:04:44.887 --> 00:04:47.788]  That'll get them as the stock market, the stocks for
[00:04:48.408 --> 00:04:50.550]  Health insurance companies explode.
[00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.151]  Look, we're really getting them.
[00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.675]  Their stock's exploding because they know they're getting all your money.
[00:04:56.675 --> 00:05:00.158]  They're also, the feds are moving to ban angling, fishing.
[00:05:00.158 --> 00:05:03.200]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.225]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:17.072]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[00:05:17.472 --> 00:05:23.838]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:26.000]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.902]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:05:28.902 --> 00:05:36.469]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.752]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[00:05:39.752 --> 00:05:41.213]  Another example?
[00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:44.396]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:49.561]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:50.362]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:50.362 --> 00:05:51.423]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:06.107]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.107 --> 00:06:09.350]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.772]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:14.158]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:20.539]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.901]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:35.702]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.822 --> 00:06:38.163]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.764]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:42.225]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:44.346]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.346 --> 00:06:49.488]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.488 --> 00:06:58.612]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:03.957]  This is not a drill.
[00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.479]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.381]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:15.607]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:19.991]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:30.300]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.121]  Under any circumstance.
[00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:39.343]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:40.003]  But listen up.
[00:07:40.003 --> 00:07:46.285]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:48.126]  Go to HideYourGuns.com.
[00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:50.306]  That's HideYourGuns.com.
[00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:51.547]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:07:51.547 --> 00:07:55.828]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:58.089]  HideYourGuns.com right now.
[00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:08.313]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:23.705]  We've got Birgitta Jones-Dottier leading the charge against the banker Takeover successfully, saying, no, we're not paying you all this derivatives money from your scam that you designed to bring down Iceland.
[00:08:24.707 --> 00:08:38.237]  That even came out in government documents, just like it came out in the clashing newspapers, that Goldman Sachs and others engineered the housing bubble while betting against it as a way to destroy their competition, make huge profits on the way up, and in the bailout on the way down.
[00:08:38.237 --> 00:08:44.882]  All the major banks recording record profits, record bonuses, two years into the banking takeover.
[00:08:46.451 --> 00:09:10.476]  Meanwhile, I was on CBC Radio today, and the host had some author on who's saying there's no such thing as, you know, any government conspiracies, and the guy that came on to counter me just said, no, the banks are not engineering this, and there's no world government, and there's no evidence Diana was killed, and just countered everything I said by stating it's just not true.
[00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.810]  Doesn't matter if we have all the facts.
[00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.191]  Herman Van Rompuy is not calling for world government at the EU.
[00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:19.151]  Gordon Brown in England isn't calling for it.
[00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:20.392]  Al Gore isn't calling for it.
[00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:23.072]  Ban Ki-moon isn't calling for it.
[00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:26.733]  I am just basically a complete and total liar.
[00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:32.754]  And I told the talk show host and his cohort, I said, go ahead, just keep stonewalling.
[00:09:32.754 --> 00:09:38.095]  Just keep denying, because your listeners are going to hear you say there's no world government being formed by the banks.
[00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:46.279]  And that they're not getting power out of this and then they're going to read the newspaper separately admitting the banks are getting total power and setting up a world government.
[00:09:48.373 --> 00:09:58.624]  So we've got Jones, Dr. Year joining us in the last hour, Chris Pinto, and of course, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer of Able Danger with key 9-11 information coming up today.
[00:09:58.624 --> 00:10:07.072]  On Friday, we got Jesse Ventura for a full hour talking about his new book that's now shipping from InfoWars.com in hardcover.
[00:10:07.072 --> 00:10:11.076]  Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, American Conspiracies.
[00:10:12.057 --> 00:10:25.580]  And it is a powerful book that has gotten rave reviews from Playboy, Boston Herald, ESPN, Donnie Deutsch, Maxim, Fox Business News, The Daily Beast, and many others.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:32.062]  And it covers everything from the assassination of Kennedy to Malcolm X to government narcotics trafficking to the banks.
[00:10:32.822 --> 00:11:00.584]  uh... imploding our society in chapter thirteen the wall street conspiracy the book is available for nineteen ninety five it retails for twenty four ninety five and no one is giving anybody a deal this good you can get a free film your choice of loose change final cut when you get the book for nineteen ninety five or the erin russo reflections and warnings my final interview with him before he died i made a documentary out of it it's excellent information get one of these two films free with the book a forty four

[00:11:09.978 --> 00:11:13.785]  And I also want to thank one of our great sponsors today.
[00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:17.383]  Here on the show that's going to make this hour possible.
[00:11:17.383 --> 00:11:21.425]  Before I get into all the news and your phone calls, MySolarBackup.com.
[00:11:21.425 --> 00:11:25.628]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?

[00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:34.413]  Here's how.
[00:11:34.413 --> 00:11:37.575]  Plug and play solar generators available from Solutions from Science.
[00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:42.859]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever and
[00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:44.760]  Wherever you need it.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.540]  Producing electricity directly from the sun.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.742]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run directly from the sun and emit no fumes.
[00:11:51.742 --> 00:11:55.644]  It's like having your own electrical power supply and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[00:11:55.644 --> 00:12:00.746]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.

[00:12:05.688 --> 00:12:05.728]  877-327-0365.
[00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:32.493]  Okay, I'm going to do this because I promised to get to calls early in the broadcast today, so I started mentioning some of the news, but let me just read headlines to you, then we'll take calls for 30 minutes or so, or actually for the rest of the broadcast, 45 minutes or so.
[00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:45.808]  In this hour, and then in the next hour, I'll do a news blitz in detail on these before Anthony Schaefer joins us coming up.
[00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:48.730]  US sales taxes hit record high.
[00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.190]  Forbes.
[00:12:50.089 --> 00:13:01.212]  Not only is the federal government trying to pass all these taxes and increasing taxes, but it reports that record level of sales tax increases at state, county, and city level.
[00:13:01.212 --> 00:13:08.795]  And of course, now all these states are passing food taxes on all the food you buy, hitting the poorest people.
[00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:11.716]  Just absolutely amazing on that front.
[00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:16.577]  Iowan kindergartner suspended for making a gun with their hand.
[00:13:16.577 --> 00:13:19.298]  The schools are prisons designed
[00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:29.168]  To get your children into the criminal or psychiatric or welfare system for doing things that aren't illegal or aren't even uncivil.
[00:13:29.168 --> 00:13:30.489]  All kids do this.
[00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:32.951]  You're not allowed to run, play dodgeball.
[00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:35.353]  You're not allowed to shake hands.
[00:13:35.353 --> 00:13:38.375]  They're taught how to be searched, how to have no rights.
[00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.717]  They're thumb scanned to get their school lunches.
[00:13:40.717 --> 00:13:42.378]  They write reports on their parents.
[00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:45.361]  The school laptops, watch them at home.
[00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:47.943]  If you have your children in public school, you are totally insane.
[00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:50.753]  But see, they're bankrupting everybody.
[00:13:50.753 --> 00:13:54.294]  People are so poor, working so many jobs, most people can't help it.
[00:13:54.294 --> 00:13:59.637]  They take your property tax money and then use it to totally turn your children against you.
[00:13:59.637 --> 00:14:03.599]  To the little boy's mother, it was just a six-year-old playing around.
[00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:09.802]  But Mason Jammer, the kindergarten student at Jefferson Elementary in IONIA,
[00:14:12.594 --> 00:14:16.938]  Curled his fist into the shape of a gun Wednesday and pointed at another student.
[00:14:16.938 --> 00:14:19.760]  School officials said it was no laughing matter.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.261]  You are a prisoner.
[00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:31.150]  They suspended Mason until Friday, saying the behavior made other students uncomfortable, said Aaron Jammer, Mason's mother.
[00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.233]  School officials, not servants, officials, authorities.
[00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:39.677]  School officials allege Mason had displayed this kind of behavior for several months, despite numerous warnings.
[00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:47.668]  I do think it's too harsh for a six-year-old, said Jammer, who was previously warned that if Mason continued the practice, he would be suspended.
[00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:48.448]  He's six.
[00:14:48.448 --> 00:14:49.849]  He just likes to play.
[00:14:49.849 --> 00:14:53.551]  So see, the video games, the TV, the culture, it's all violence.
[00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:58.233]  There's that message, and police tasering and killing people and troops slaughtering.
[00:14:58.233 --> 00:14:59.394]  That's all good.
[00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:03.295]  But then you draw a picture of a gun or bring a two-inch G.I.
[00:15:03.295 --> 00:15:04.396]  Joe gun in your pocket.
[00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:05.657]  You get suspended.
[00:15:05.657 --> 00:15:06.458]  You get arrested.
[00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.500]  It's total mind control.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.062]  And soon it'll be like England where you'll be arrested.
[00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:14.785]  If you get mugged and you actually fight back, they throw the book at you.
[00:15:14.785 --> 00:15:18.048]  You're not allowed to defend yourself.
[00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:21.011]  You're not allowed to have burglar bars on your house in Oklahoma.
[00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:22.272]  You are prisoners.
[00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:29.018]  The government and the criminals that work with them want you disarmed and ready for them to have their way with you.
[00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:33.904]  Travelers file complaints over TSA body scanners.
[00:15:33.904 --> 00:15:42.667]  Documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center shows complaints have been lodged with the Transportation Security Administration over the use of whole body scanners at U.S.
[00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:43.608]  airports.
[00:15:43.608 --> 00:15:48.690]  Many foreign travelers are now avoiding the U.S., not wanting their naked body recorded.
[00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:49.991]  But the government doesn't care.
[00:15:50.993 --> 00:16:09.784]  They're announcing that they're hiring a former general to run the TSA and they're now moving mobile TSA brain scanner and body scanner trucks out to be randomly used on highways and at sporting events to indoctrinate you and baptize you into total slavery.
[00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:13.166]  Continuing on financial news, we'll talk about this with the parliament member from
[00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:15.949]  Iceland coming up.
[00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:28.775]  Greece braces for more strikes and protests as their pension funds are grabbed, as their social security is cut, as they lose their jobs, and as all the tax money they're now reporting has to go to the bankers.
[00:16:28.775 --> 00:16:34.458]  They may have to even give up their national treasures, their national parks, their islands.
[00:16:34.458 --> 00:16:39.421]  Everything must go to the private bankers who loan them fiat money backed up by the West.
[00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:46.150]  And continuing along that line, Fed to keep bank oversight.
[00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:53.754]  The Federal Reserve has beaten a move by Senator Chris Dodd to let the Senate have some oversight.
[00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:54.854]  That's in the Constitution.
[00:16:54.854 --> 00:16:57.655]  The Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:16:57.655 --> 00:16:58.656]  But no, no, no.
[00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:04.359]  The Federal Reserve has won its battle to maintain singular regulatory oversight of America's major financial institutions.
[00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:10.682]  The Financial Times reported Sunday night Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd gave up the fight for a new super regulator.
[00:17:11.582 --> 00:17:22.388]  Over the weekend, Apple proposed financial reforms this week that leave the Fed in control of big banks and the rest of the major Wall Street players, sources told FT.
[00:17:22.388 --> 00:17:31.674]  And the Federal Reserve openly gives itself trillions of our dollars, and it's all secret and they won't say where it goes, but then it comes out that it's going to them as bonuses.
[00:17:31.674 --> 00:17:35.156]  And it's totally illegal, and that's just the way it is, because they're lawless crooks.
[00:17:36.192 --> 00:17:43.731]  And they're going to watch your kids on the government laptops, and they're going to train your kids to spy on you, and they're going to arrest your kids for no reason, and this is just how it is!
[00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:45.535]  Because they also own the private prisons!
[00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:51.969]  And the IMF is in AP saying you will pay your taxes to us.
[00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:56.190]  The new carbon taxes will be paid to us and we don't care if your Congress won't ratify it.
[00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:03.291]  The BBC reports in a European-wide poll almost four in five people around the world believe that access to the Internet is a fundamental right.
[00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:12.713]  A poll by the BBC World Service suggests the survey of 27,000 adults across 26 countries found strong support for net access on both sides of the digital divide.
[00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:16.769]  A continued support of net neutrality and against censorship.
[00:18:16.769 --> 00:18:18.310]  Of course, the government doesn't care.
[00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:24.035]  Worldwide, they're moving to censor the Internet.
[00:18:24.035 --> 00:18:27.618]  Continuing here with the news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:29.156 --> 00:18:36.738]  CNN lavishes Coffee Party with favorable coverage after a year of Tea Party demonization.
[00:18:36.738 --> 00:18:40.318]  This woman openly works for Obama.
[00:18:40.318 --> 00:18:43.959]  Before that, worked in public relations for the New York Times.
[00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.500]  That's who first wrote a big front page story about her.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:54.021]  And they say she's an independent person who wants to fight government corruption by supporting the government and supporting amnesty.
[00:18:54.021 --> 00:18:57.222]  And she's now having rallies with the bus standing legal aliens.
[00:18:58.188 --> 00:19:01.409]  And we've got those videos posted up on InfoWars.com in this article.
[00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:06.772]  So, Obama openly organizing the illegal aliens against us, calling it the Coffee Party.
[00:19:06.772 --> 00:19:11.433]  We are launching the Real Coffee Party website tomorrow.
[00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:14.215]  RealCoffeeParty.com.
[00:19:14.215 --> 00:19:15.655]  It's not up yet.
[00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:19.137]  It'll be InfoWars.com forward slash Real Coffee Party.
[00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:20.537]  As well as
[00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:43.514]  Over a month ago.
[00:19:43.514 --> 00:19:48.155]  I even knew they'd have fake coffee parties, so we said real coffee party.
[00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:58.580]  And so we're launching it to try to take over the tea parties, recapture them, and to try to defeat the fake, devilish, illegal alien coffee party.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.120]  We'll be right back.

[00:20:58.732 --> 00:20:59.852]  We love you!
[00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:03.134]  Hi, this is Peter Krochnovel with Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.134 --> 00:21:07.917]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:14.520]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.021]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.643]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[00:21:19.643 --> 00:21:24.765]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market, or any other related paper asset, is a lose-lose proposition.
[00:21:24.765 --> 00:21:26.126]  Lose on your capital investment,
[00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:29.647]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[00:21:29.647 --> 00:21:36.009]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:40.091]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:44.572]  Call me today, Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:44.572 --> 00:21:49.694]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:21:49.694 --> 00:21:50.114]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:53.035 --> 00:21:55.556]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:57.217]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:57.217 --> 00:21:58.738]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:14.774]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:14.774 --> 00:22:20.795]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.795 --> 00:22:26.336]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:35.978]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:36.098 --> 00:22:38.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.041]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:42.502]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:42.502 --> 00:22:44.623]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:44.623 --> 00:22:49.767]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:54.790]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.892]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:04.380]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.661]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:07.541]  Don't!
[00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:10.982]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.982 --> 00:23:20.064]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:23.725]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:27.267]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:27.267 --> 00:23:34.653]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:34.653 --> 00:23:35.833]  Herb K. was right.
[00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:39.016]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:40.377]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:44.079]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:44.740]  Get Herb K.'
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.022]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:23:48.022 --> 00:23:48.322]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:53.185]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:23:53.185 --> 00:23:53.726]  888-352-7726.
[00:23:53.726 --> 00:24:15.155]  Alright, coming up in the next hour, CNN lavishes Coffee Party with favorable coverage after a year of Tea Party demonization.
[00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:17.636]  It's really the illegal alien party.
[00:24:17.636 --> 00:24:19.617]  The Obama Party.
[00:24:21.189 --> 00:24:24.150]  We're going to be breaking that down and warning the people.
[00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.891]  Also, ID card for workers is at center of immigration plan.
[00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:32.372]  A hemispheric North American Union ID card for the American people.
[00:24:32.372 --> 00:24:34.933]  Totally legal alien legalization.
[00:24:34.933 --> 00:24:37.393]  That's coming up.
[00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:38.734]  Another important report here.
[00:24:38.734 --> 00:24:45.356]  This is from ESPN by Robert Montgomery, their outdoors reporter.
[00:24:45.356 --> 00:24:46.636]  The Obama administration
[00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:52.334]  We'll accept no more public input for a federal strategy that could prohibit U.S.
[00:24:52.334 --> 00:24:57.415]  citizens from fishing in nations' oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters.
[00:24:57.415 --> 00:25:08.878]  But the big mass fishing trawlers from Japan and everywhere else, they can sit 12 miles offshore, and they're the ones that are overfishing in many areas, but you can't go out with your grandson and fish.
[00:25:08.878 --> 00:25:10.378]  You gotta get a special federal license.
[00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:12.919]  They want you to have a passport to go out on a boat.
[00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:14.679]  I mean, this is total U.N.
[00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.480]  control of the waterways.
[00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:22.584]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:25:22.584 --> 00:25:29.308]  We will also get into all the latest police state news.
[00:25:29.308 --> 00:25:38.072]  The report of the new bill that we've been covering in detail, dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:25:38.072 --> 00:25:42.215]  This is unspeakably hardcore and tyrannical.
[00:25:42.215 --> 00:25:45.016]  But right now, for the rest of the hour, let's start going to your phone calls.
[00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:46.497]  Burt in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.151]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:49.132]  Pretty good.
[00:25:49.132 --> 00:25:51.754]  I'm calling about last June 14th.
[00:25:51.754 --> 00:25:55.177]  My daughter passed away from swine flu up in Chicago.
[00:25:55.177 --> 00:25:56.578]  Well, we were up in Wisconsin.
[00:25:56.578 --> 00:25:59.880]  She got sick, took her to the hospital there.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.203]  They supposedly took a swine flu test, came back negative.
[00:26:03.203 --> 00:26:10.289]  That night, they transported her from Chicago, I mean, from Wisconsin to the University of Chicago in downtown.
[00:26:11.368 --> 00:26:24.851]  Within 12 hours she was on a respirator and I never got a chance to speak to her again, but the point I'm getting to is when we arrived in Chicago at that hospital they were supposedly taking a swine flu test, but they dropped the ball.
[00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:33.552]  Five days later I'm sitting in that room hugging all my daughter, kissing all my daughter, and they run in there and they tell me to get out, get out, she has swine flu.
[00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:36.833]  And I'm like, well it's a little late for this, but the point I'm getting at is
[00:26:37.631 --> 00:26:42.054]  She had an underlying condition of sarcoidosis, okay?
[00:26:42.054 --> 00:26:49.639]  And when they got her there, after the fifth day, they put her on 72 bottles of Perpadol in 72 hours.
[00:26:49.639 --> 00:26:51.120]  A bottle an hour.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.803]  And after that, her organs shut down and she didn't make it.
[00:26:54.803 --> 00:27:02.588]  I believe wholeheartedly that they used her as a... And, um, the Perpadol really is what killed my daughter.
[00:27:02.588 --> 00:27:04.389]  Well, your phone cut out for a moment.
[00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:06.770]  Did you say they used her as a guinea pig?
[00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:07.371]  Yeah, that's what I...
[00:27:09.147 --> 00:27:13.650]  Because I don't think you could give anybody 72 bottles of Perpigal.
[00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.551]  That's what killed Michael Jackson in 72 hours.
[00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:21.274]  And even the nurses started looking at me like, we don't know what's going on here, Mr. Campbell.
[00:27:22.342 --> 00:27:27.467]  And as a matter of fact, I talked to the head doctor there and he was an Obama supporter.
[00:27:27.467 --> 00:27:32.472]  So, you know, I don't, I don't, with my daughter, I didn't pay attention to that.
[00:27:32.472 --> 00:27:33.713]  Well, Bert, let me just say this.
[00:27:33.713 --> 00:27:41.961]  We're very sorry for your loss and I have children and it causes me great pain and anxiety just to hear about a father losing a precious daughter.
[00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:43.022]  But let me just say this.
[00:27:44.423 --> 00:27:50.026]  Over 300,000 Americans, according to the federal government, die from bad drug interactions every year.
[00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:53.488]  Another 200 plus thousand die of hospital infections.
[00:27:53.488 --> 00:27:56.209]  And my father is an oral surgeon and a dentist.
[00:27:56.209 --> 00:28:01.072]  And he has told me my entire life, don't go to the hospital unless you absolutely have to.
[00:28:01.072 --> 00:28:03.453]  They are full of deadly bugs.
[00:28:03.453 --> 00:28:05.614]  The malpractice is incredible.
[00:28:05.614 --> 00:28:06.975]  They're understaffed.
[00:28:06.975 --> 00:28:08.976]  A lot of the nurses don't know what they're doing.
[00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:12.839]  And we hear these horror stories all the time.
[00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:21.445]  We know that this swine flu, well we had a record low overall seasonal flu last year and this year.
[00:28:21.445 --> 00:28:25.188]  That's been reported by even the Associated Press and Wall Street Journal.
[00:28:25.188 --> 00:28:28.150]  Record low number deaths from the swine flu.
[00:28:29.247 --> 00:28:29.447]  It's
[00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:59.176]  Similar to hemorrhagic fever and caused the lungs to flood and and then they have to go on a respirator and they a lot of times die.
[00:28:59.176 --> 00:29:06.482]  The Tamiflu and other things that they know did nothing against the H1N1 but they still pushed it.
[00:29:06.482 --> 00:29:06.662]  And so
[00:29:09.143 --> 00:29:13.727]  It's just horrible to hear that she died from this.
[00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:17.690]  And they told you she hadn't died from it, and they told you she had died from it.
[00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.472]  Who knows what the hospital did?
[00:29:19.472 --> 00:29:22.134]  They may have given her a swine flu shot without telling you.
[00:29:22.134 --> 00:29:29.860]  I mean, they, all over the country, gave elementary school students, secretly, the flu shot because they thought they couldn't explain it to their parents.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.402]  And, Burt, I'm just really sad to hear this happen.
[00:29:33.175 --> 00:29:34.496]  One more thing here.
[00:29:34.496 --> 00:29:43.239]  If there's any lawyer out there that wants to look into it, I think this would be a good case to show that it was a fraud on the American people.
[00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:46.521]  How do people contact you?
[00:29:46.521 --> 00:29:48.402]  Burt Campbell, Ambassador of Louisiana here.
[00:29:48.402 --> 00:29:50.002]  Alright, buddy.
[00:29:50.002 --> 00:29:51.223]  God bless you.
[00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:52.604]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:55.145]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.145 --> 00:29:57.826]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.183 --> 00:30:05.527]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:30:05.527 --> 00:30:08.310]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:13.634]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:30:13.634 --> 00:30:18.117]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:30:34.264 --> 00:30:36.105]  This film needs to be seen.

[00:30:48.064 --> 00:30:49.465]  Shadow Government.

[00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:06.950]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.191]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:10.191 --> 00:31:11.612]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.011]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:21.373]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:21.373 --> 00:31:26.935]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.935 --> 00:31:36.538]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:36.678 --> 00:31:39.020]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.621]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:40.621 --> 00:31:43.082]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:43.082 --> 00:31:44.944]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:50.347]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:50.347 --> 00:31:59.473]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:05.381]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:11.406]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:11.406 --> 00:32:19.254]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[00:32:19.674 --> 00:32:26.040]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.202]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:31.105]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:32:31.105 --> 00:32:37.551]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free.
[00:32:37.591 --> 00:32:37.931]  I think so.
[00:33:14.904 --> 00:33:16.485]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:16.485 --> 00:33:17.165]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:17.165 --> 00:33:17.585]  Central.
[00:33:17.585 --> 00:33:24.187]  We're here live, just trying to get people to wake up and look around them and witness the corruption going on.
[00:33:24.187 --> 00:33:27.348]  Corruption going to seed.
[00:33:27.348 --> 00:33:35.450]  All the parasitic people in government and private corporations using the power of government to rob and loot and steal from the rest of us.
[00:33:36.584 --> 00:33:43.146]  And it's not going to get any better until we take our counties and cities and states and the federal government back from the New World Order.
[00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:44.846]  And that's what Iceland's doing.
[00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:50.587]  Coming up in about an hour and a half, we're going to have folks on from Iceland, actually in the last hour, come up in about two and a half hours.
[00:33:50.587 --> 00:34:04.811]  We're going to have Birgitta Jones-Dottirer, one of the leaders of the parliament who led the move to say no to Goldman Sachs and others that came in and designed the implosion of their economy.
[00:34:06.198 --> 00:34:08.360]  So, that is coming up.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:18.548]  On the subject of hospitals killing people, hey, if you got a broken leg, or you got a gunshot wound, or you get run over by a car, the hospital's great.
[00:34:18.548 --> 00:34:21.970]  And the miracles of modern medicine are incredible.
[00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:31.398]  But, I have had two friends, close friends, who went in to have minor surgeries.
[00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:40.029]  In fact, I start thinking about it, it's more than two close friends.
[00:34:40.029 --> 00:34:47.953]  And they get an infection in the hospital and they die.
[00:34:47.953 --> 00:34:56.318]  The hospital is a very dangerous place to be.
[00:34:56.318 --> 00:34:56.458]  And
[00:34:58.433 --> 00:34:59.855]  It's getting a lot worse.
[00:34:59.855 --> 00:35:01.958]  We should do a whole show on that sometime.
[00:35:01.958 --> 00:35:05.102]  300 plus thousand deaths a year just from drug interactions.
[00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:08.226]  I watch these drug ads and some of them are a minute long.
[00:35:08.226 --> 00:35:13.994]  They'll have 20 seconds showing happy people walking through a field because they're taking the drug and then there'll be 40 seconds of...
[00:35:15.075 --> 00:35:27.886]  Some died during trials of the drug, others have heart attacks, kidney failure, liver failure, may cause mania, may cause schizophrenia, may cause obsessive gambling, may cause... And you hear these ads, it's like a joke!
[00:35:27.886 --> 00:35:33.491]  I mean, they know the Gardasil shot has killed masses of people that took it.
[00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:40.817]  The live cancer virus shot to supposedly protect you from cervical cancer that only kills a few thousand people a day.
[00:35:40.817 --> 00:35:42.559]  A few thousand people a year, excuse me.
[00:35:46.536 --> 00:35:50.058]  And it's way down the line for cancers that kill people.
[00:35:50.058 --> 00:35:54.981]  Things like bone cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, that are big killers.
[00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:57.402]  And they say, no, we have this shot.
[00:35:57.402 --> 00:36:07.268]  And then they admit on the drug insert that it doesn't even protect you from the human papillomavirus.
[00:36:09.158 --> 00:36:12.520]  And they say, you must take it, all schoolgirls must take it.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.220]  Governor Perry says so.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:27.207]  Then it turns out he just told the health department, the state health department, to make it be on the list of compulsory shots to attend school, which itself isn't a law, and by law they're ordered to give you a waiver, but they don't.
[00:36:27.207 --> 00:36:29.088]  They lie to you and say it's the law.
[00:36:29.088 --> 00:36:34.830]  And then other states adopted it and said, you must take the shot, it's the law, when it was not the law.
[00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:35.651]  The same governments,
[00:36:36.531 --> 00:36:44.233]  Around the world using government-issued laptops to watch pupils at home in their bedrooms.
[00:36:44.233 --> 00:36:54.475]  The same government worldwide that's been taking blood for 37 years in a secret UN program from all children at birth, now declassified.
[00:36:54.475 --> 00:36:57.756]  Just a lawless group that does whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:36:57.756 --> 00:37:05.158]  I'm gonna go back to Guy, Dan, Chris, and others here in just a moment.
[00:37:07.028 --> 00:37:09.989]  We've got a lot of key news coming up the next hour before Lt.
[00:37:09.989 --> 00:37:10.310]  Col.
[00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.991]  Anthony Schaffer joins us.
[00:37:13.991 --> 00:37:17.753]  But for the next five minutes, I wanted to bring a great sponsor on the air with us.
[00:37:17.753 --> 00:37:19.154]  He joins us once a month.
[00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:20.715]  He's Marty Schachter.
[00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:33.181]  He has the best and lowest price, and when I say that, it's 85% off supermarket prices for the dangerous detergents and petrochemical byproducts that they tell the public is soap.
[00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:36.600]  You walk down the aisle, your eyes start watering.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.021]  It's 85% off that.
[00:37:38.021 --> 00:37:44.564]  Normally, organic soaps are more than the toxic garbage, but because you get it factory direct, you get 85% off.
[00:37:44.564 --> 00:37:47.225]  They've been around since 1947.
[00:37:47.225 --> 00:37:53.688]  That is the longest continually operating organic, true soap company in the nation.
[00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:59.671]  And so I wanted Marty Schachter to give you his basic product line, give you his toll-free number and website.
[00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:01.092]  Marty, good to have you on with us.
[00:38:01.092 --> 00:38:01.992]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:38:01.992 --> 00:38:03.213]  A pleasure talking to you.
[00:38:03.895 --> 00:38:12.981]  And your listeners, I've always got so much information to share, what I need is an hour, but I know in five minutes we'll try to condense it down.
[00:38:12.981 --> 00:38:20.947]  What you didn't discuss, or didn't mention, was corruption in the chemical industry, in the so-called soap industry.
[00:38:20.947 --> 00:38:32.735]  Now they're using the word soap, but they also eliminated the word before soap, and that word is synthetic, artificial, false, fake, ain't real.
[00:38:33.348 --> 00:38:34.789]  Not natural.
[00:38:34.789 --> 00:38:38.973]  And all those terms were eliminated because of bad PR.
[00:38:38.973 --> 00:38:41.855]  But when they say soap, they don't mean real soap.
[00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:44.497]  They don't mean coconut oils and vegetable oils.
[00:38:44.497 --> 00:38:53.725]  They mean synthetic chemicals that are toxic, that outgas you, that you gotta wear a respirator when you go to the supermarket, from all the fumes!
[00:38:54.245 --> 00:39:07.509]  Massive, for those that don't know, massive studies have been linked to the huge upswing in asthma from the type of chemicals that are in hair care and lotions and different detergent-based soaps.
[00:39:07.509 --> 00:39:10.910]  I mean, we are just bathing in the chemical waste.
[00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.811]  But separately, I mean, we know their stuff's bad.
[00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:15.992]  Marty, tell folks about your products.
[00:39:15.992 --> 00:39:18.233]  Well, we don't out first.
[00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:19.493]  We don't pyramid.
[00:39:20.017 --> 00:39:22.018]  We don't, uh, what's the other word?
[00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:23.379]  Multi-level.
[00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:25.180]  We are factory direct.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.221]  The products are all American.
[00:39:27.221 --> 00:39:29.142]  We only hire Americans here.
[00:39:29.142 --> 00:39:30.783]  We're an American company.
[00:39:30.783 --> 00:39:36.006]  Started in 1947, my father and I, and we're doing very well.
[00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:37.546]  We have no complaints.
[00:39:37.546 --> 00:39:45.111]  We've got a lot of happy customers that not only use our products, not only like our products, but love them.
[00:39:45.111 --> 00:39:49.673]  We create love affairs with every user of Pure Soaps.
[00:39:50.203 --> 00:39:52.465]  All natural, pure soaps.
[00:39:52.465 --> 00:39:53.946]  Factory direct.
[00:39:53.946 --> 00:39:54.987]  No middleman.
[00:39:54.987 --> 00:39:56.288]  No wholesaler.
[00:39:56.288 --> 00:39:59.010]  No shipping clerks.
[00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.471]  No commissions.
[00:40:00.471 --> 00:40:02.973]  None of the things that mark up the product.
[00:40:02.973 --> 00:40:04.794]  We sell it direct.
[00:40:04.794 --> 00:40:06.896]  We're not talking about a hundred items here.
[00:40:06.896 --> 00:40:10.538]  We're talking about four basic soaps.
[00:40:10.538 --> 00:40:15.462]  Shampoo, bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[00:40:15.462 --> 00:40:16.763]  And they'll do a hundred jobs.
[00:40:17.287 --> 00:40:32.680]  Don't need all the wall wipe cleaners and floor cleaners and window cleaners and pre-soaks and woolen cleaners and all these chemicals and solvents and pastes that are impregnating all these chemicals.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.681]  Don't need them.
[00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:35.222]  We've eliminated them.
[00:40:35.222 --> 00:40:41.887]  All we've got is happy, usable materials that clean perfectly.
[00:40:41.887 --> 00:40:44.950]  And then we're happy to share all this information with you.
[00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.151]  You can call us.
[00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:47.434]  1-800-340-7091.

[00:40:53.137 --> 00:40:55.979]  I have detailed everything that we've got.
[00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:57.961]  You can see us on the web.
[00:40:57.961 --> 00:41:00.142]  5starsoap.com.
[00:41:00.142 --> 00:41:01.623]  That's 5starsoap.
[00:41:01.623 --> 00:41:04.805]  Either the letter 5 or the number 5.
[00:41:04.805 --> 00:41:07.107]  It's there.
[00:41:07.107 --> 00:41:08.768]  Call us for a free catalog.
[00:41:08.768 --> 00:41:10.569]  My whole family works here.
[00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:11.810]  My son answers the phone.
[00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.351]  My daughter answers the phone.
[00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:14.412]  I answer the phone.
[00:41:14.412 --> 00:41:15.773]  We're here to please you.

[00:41:20.857 --> 00:41:23.259]  We've been doing it for a long, long time.
[00:41:23.259 --> 00:41:26.300]  Well, Marty, Americans say they want U.S.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:26.821]  jobs.
[00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:31.703]  That's why we have, like, Diamond Gusset, super high-quality jeans made right here in the U.S.
[00:41:31.703 --> 00:41:32.824]  in Tennessee.

[00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:08.022]  Get all the information.

[00:42:09.625 --> 00:42:10.707]  We've got long...
[00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:25.196]  Yeah, I think people should bypass even getting the catalog.
[00:42:25.196 --> 00:42:27.418]  They can look at it all at 5starsoap.com.
[00:42:27.418 --> 00:42:33.803]  Everybody should just buy the tote bag, the sampler bag that's a month's supply for a couple people.
[00:42:33.803 --> 00:42:36.545]  It actually lasts longer than that in my household.
[00:42:36.545 --> 00:42:38.287]  Tell folks about the sampler tote bag.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.081]  Oh, it's a six pound package.
[00:42:41.081 --> 00:42:44.903]  It's got four bars of our pure soap, nothing like it.
[00:42:44.903 --> 00:42:58.829]  It's got a pint, 16 ounces, and a dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo, a 16 ounce dispenser of our liquid cream soap for pots and pans, utensils, pans, windows, floors.
[00:42:58.829 --> 00:43:03.131]  It's got 18 ounces and a little jar with a little tiny scoop
[00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:05.720]  Of a granulated laundry soap.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.284]  It's got a book of instructions covering all the products and all the other uses of the product.
[00:43:11.284 --> 00:43:15.446]  It's got a large nylon scarring pad to eliminate Ajax.
[00:43:15.446 --> 00:43:16.547]  And it comes in a tote bag.
[00:43:16.547 --> 00:43:21.330]  But even better, you guys also, another product, you have great lotion that my wife just loves.
[00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.533]  Marty, one more time the number and give us the Limerick for the day.
[00:43:25.533 --> 00:43:26.153]  The number is 1-800-340-7091.
[00:43:32.116 --> 00:43:32.256]  800-340-7091.
[00:43:32.256 --> 00:43:38.618]  A free call to change your life.
[00:43:38.618 --> 00:43:49.582]  And a limerick for today is... A limerick packs laughs anatomical into space that is quite economical.
[00:43:49.582 --> 00:43:53.964]  But the good ones I've seen so seldom are clean.
[00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:57.245]  And the clean ones so seldom are comical.
[00:43:57.245 --> 00:43:59.846]  For Alex, every line has been clean
[00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:11.610]  Not a word that's profane or obscene or spelled in four letters that might pay our debtors or snafu if you know what we mean.
[00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.532]  Thank you Alex.
[00:44:13.532 --> 00:44:14.793]  Talk to you later in a month.
[00:44:14.793 --> 00:44:15.714]  Bye now.
[00:44:15.714 --> 00:44:17.055]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:34.595]  Alright, I wanted to bring everyone's attention to this article out of True Slant.
[00:44:34.595 --> 00:44:40.399]  I suggest everyone go to Google right now and type in, normalizing the police state, and go to the first article.
[00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:52.909]  Now, in the article it brings up several examples of, you know, all this police state news, such as old women getting tasered, you know, kids getting tasered for, you know, throwing on the desk and things like that.
[00:44:52.909 --> 00:44:59.154]  But I want to bring to your attention that you brought up in the past about this advanced ride control agents.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:05.385]  Now, you talk about, uh... Microwave guns, sound cannons, everything.
[00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:05.886]  Correct.
[00:45:05.886 --> 00:45:12.452]  And this article, it brings up, uh, out of the Penn State College, uh, medical research.
[00:45:12.452 --> 00:45:17.818]  They bring up, you know, dispersion in the air, like, uh, Valium and, uh...
[00:45:18.547 --> 00:45:24.069]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the government's talking in the U.S.
[00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:33.672]  and Japan about putting lithium, an anti-psychotic that's toxic, in the water because it doesn't break down for a long time and actually gets delivered to the nervous system.
[00:45:33.672 --> 00:45:40.594]  And yes, I am aware the government's been doing studies of spraying Valium or other drugs into the air.
[00:45:40.594 --> 00:45:42.395]  I didn't know that was in an article.
[00:45:42.395 --> 00:45:43.555]  What's the title of the article?
[00:45:43.555 --> 00:45:45.535]  Normalizing the Police State?
[00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:45.996]  Correct.
[00:45:45.996 --> 00:45:47.056]  And that's out of Troosland.
[00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:55.668]  And I just wanted to bring up at the very, it's probably the middle of the page, it talks about how they would disperse it in the air.
[00:45:55.668 --> 00:45:57.870]  And it would be that... Are they saying it's good?
[00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:06.275]  Because in my experience, true slant attacks yours truly about every week is an absolute George Soros type operation.
[00:46:06.275 --> 00:46:06.996]  Actually, no.
[00:46:06.996 --> 00:46:14.080]  Whoever wrote this, I'm not sure who the woman is exactly, but it's very against it.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.181]  So what are they saying?
[00:46:16.301 --> 00:46:21.843]  Uh, you know, they just bring up all, you know, some of the examples about the police saying how it's growing in America.
[00:46:21.843 --> 00:46:24.243]  But I just want to bring up how they would disperse it.
[00:46:24.243 --> 00:46:27.664]  Would be through artillery shells.
[00:46:27.664 --> 00:46:34.486]  It would disperse over, you know, it could scatter up to 152 canisters over a 100,000 square foot area.
[00:46:34.486 --> 00:46:38.607]  Dispersing chemicals and parachuting it down.
[00:46:38.607 --> 00:46:41.668]  So this is literally would be... Yeah, I see the report.
[00:46:41.668 --> 00:46:43.809]  I see the report and I'm glad you called, Guy.
[00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:44.569]  Excellent points.
[00:46:45.652 --> 00:46:58.662]  Look, three years ago, the head of the Air Force, the civilian head, the Secretary of the Air Force, came out and said, under international law, we can't use microwave guns and sound cannons in war theaters.
[00:46:58.662 --> 00:47:04.986]  But if we start using it on our citizens, then we can argue in international court that it's not a tool of warfare.
[00:47:04.986 --> 00:47:05.346]  And yes,
[00:47:06.274 --> 00:47:11.679]  They've got taser drones, they've got nerve gas drones, they've got knockout gas drones.
[00:47:11.679 --> 00:47:23.470]  They're taking all our tax money and organizing the government in an offensive, predatory posture against the people.
[00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:26.553]  And it's just absolutely horrible that this is going on.
[00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:30.337]  But yes, I do have the article now and I do see the link to the university study on it.
[00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:33.818]  And this is all part of the Darth Vader uniforms.
[00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:36.361]  I told people ten years ago that was about intimidation.
[00:47:36.361 --> 00:47:46.714]  And then five years ago they had a law enforcement symposium and a bunch of police chiefs, what the Maryland police chief was one of them, said, yeah, we wear the black uniforms and masks to intimidate people and hide our identity.
[00:47:46.714 --> 00:47:48.096]  We're here to intimidate the people.
[00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:51.748]  You've got a lawless government robbing everyone.
[00:47:51.748 --> 00:47:56.150]  In every case in history, they hire a bunch of thugs and get them all hyped up that the people are the enemy.
[00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:02.634]  And then the government stages terror attacks against itself to make all the cops go into psychosis and feel sorry for themselves.
[00:48:02.634 --> 00:48:08.476]  And now they're out tasering old ladies and thumbprinting people to roller skate or skateboard and beating people up.
[00:48:08.476 --> 00:48:11.038]  And it's just, it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:48:11.838 --> 00:48:13.941]  And they're going to take your pension funds too, cops.
[00:48:13.941 --> 00:48:15.283]  I know smart cops know that.
[00:48:15.283 --> 00:48:17.466]  And we're turning into a third world country.
[00:48:17.466 --> 00:48:20.710]  From the richest, freest nation to the most enslaved overnight.
[00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.614]  And now CNN praises Mao Zedong and says he's great.
[00:48:23.614 --> 00:48:25.236]  The biggest mass murderer in history.
[00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:26.879]  Dan in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:48:28.632 --> 00:48:29.492]  Hello, Alex?
[00:48:29.492 --> 00:48:30.312]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:30.312 --> 00:48:35.374]  Yes, this is about the aspartame and the gum and everything that you've been talking about.
[00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:47.057]  Yeah, every grocery store I go, everywhere I go, I mean, literally, I cannot find gum, sugar gum, without aspartame added, which is a chemical weapon.
[00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:49.357]  Hold on, check this out, okay?
[00:48:49.357 --> 00:48:54.758]  Go and check out, I don't want to do a placement of any gum kind, but... No, I don't care, go ahead.
[00:48:54.758 --> 00:48:56.979]  Yeah, Bubblicious Burst.
[00:48:58.089 --> 00:49:03.634]  That has, that's okay, because I personally don't chew gum, but my wife does, so we really have researched this.
[00:49:03.634 --> 00:49:12.063]  Then also, bubble yum bubble gum, okay, doesn't have aspartame in it, and also Tic Tacs.
[00:49:13.877 --> 00:49:21.024]  Yes, we get Tic Tacs for our children, kind of like rewards when we're out shopping or something when they're good.
[00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:25.588]  It's like trained seals.
[00:49:25.588 --> 00:49:32.815]  But Tic Tacs don't have aspartame, at least they say they don't, but you try to get Trident gum, you try to get, I mean literally,
[00:49:34.108 --> 00:49:38.071]  I cannot find it at the store without it, but I'm glad you found some.
[00:49:38.071 --> 00:49:44.956]  I was in a toy store last week buying my children some board games, and I noticed they had an end cap of Beeman's Gum.
[00:49:44.956 --> 00:49:47.077]  That's like a hundred-year-old gum company.
[00:49:47.077 --> 00:49:51.180]  And it didn't have any aspartame in it, and I thought it was delicious.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.762]  But I appreciate your call, Dan.
[00:49:53.762 --> 00:49:56.964]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:49:56.964 --> 00:49:58.165]  He just dropped.
[00:49:58.165 --> 00:49:59.686]  Kyoto in Virginia, go ahead.
[00:50:00.854 --> 00:50:03.796]  I have a question about Iceland.
[00:50:03.796 --> 00:50:06.817]  What do you think is going to be the consequence of them not paying the banks?
[00:50:06.817 --> 00:50:13.121]  Because I heard that they're not going to be able to borrow any more money and not join the European Union.
[00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:18.444]  The globalists will probably stage terror attacks there, or they'll probably poison or assassinate leaders.
[00:50:18.444 --> 00:50:30.090]  But the problem is the country is so awake and so angry, they're now openly talking about the New World Order and they have the documents that Goldman Sachs engineered it, so when everybody wakes up, you can't just kill and intimidate people anymore.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:31.860]  Right.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.644]  So how do we get that kind of movement going on over here?
[00:50:36.644 --> 00:50:42.968]  Well, Icelanders are known for being really smart, involved, professional, cool people.
[00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:45.930]  Americans were once known as that.
[00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:49.833]  But Americans are played off by the left-right paradigm.
[00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:50.233]  Stay there.
[00:50:50.233 --> 00:50:51.334]  I'm going to try to break this down.
[00:50:51.334 --> 00:50:52.215]  Kyoto on the other side.
[00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:55.897]  Then we'll go to Jim, James, and others.
[00:50:55.897 --> 00:50:59.500]  And then at the 8 after in the next hour, I'm going to start getting into all the news.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:01.321]  Hello.
[00:51:01.321 --> 00:51:06.086]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.

[00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:15.696]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:51:16.056 --> 00:51:20.138]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:51:20.138 --> 00:51:24.180]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.981]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:28.002]  It was empowering.
[00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:31.984]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:51:31.984 --> 00:51:34.825]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:37.666]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:51:37.666 --> 00:51:38.647]  Thank you so much.
[00:51:38.647 --> 00:51:41.488]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:51:41.488 --> 00:51:42.249]  Thanks again.
[00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:44.870]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:51:45.623 --> 00:51:49.045]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:52:01.973 --> 00:52:05.976]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.976 --> 00:52:09.238]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.238 --> 00:52:10.639]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:14.644]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.644 --> 00:52:17.870]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[00:52:18.524 --> 00:52:20.385]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.385 --> 00:52:25.609]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:35.716]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.716 --> 00:52:38.057]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.057 --> 00:52:39.659]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.659 --> 00:52:42.100]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.242]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.242 --> 00:52:45.763]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:49.368]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:48.647 --> 00:53:49.367]  Sale ends March 15th.
[00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:30.097]  The last two hours and 52 minutes of this four-hour radio broadcast will be simulcast at PrisonPlanet.TV for all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:54:30.097 --> 00:54:33.399]  If you don't have a membership, you fund this operation with your support.
[00:54:33.399 --> 00:54:37.081]  Plus, you get my book, Paul Watson's book, all my films in super high quality.
[00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:40.984]  We're premiering next month two new films.
[00:54:40.984 --> 00:54:42.985]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:54:42.985 --> 00:54:46.107]  I haven't done a Police State film in nine years.
[00:54:47.307 --> 00:54:57.053]  And this is powerful, a year in the making, and Jason Berman's is a new documentary film that is just unbelievably powerful.
[00:54:57.053 --> 00:55:03.376]  In fact, I saw a mainstream news article doing a review of it, calling it New World Order on Trial.
[00:55:03.376 --> 00:55:11.781]  That's a great way to put it, but it's a very, very important documentary titled Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:55:11.781 --> 00:55:15.263]  That will premiere Tax Day, April 15th at Prison Planet,
[00:55:17.987 --> 00:55:22.248]  But I want to go back to your calls.
[00:55:22.248 --> 00:55:26.530]  Was it Jim I was talking to, John?
[00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:30.510]  Yeah, because I was going to go back to Bert, and I see that his call's been taken off the list.
[00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.171]  He dropped off.
[00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:32.911]  Okay, I pulled him to hold there.
[00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:35.212]  I wanted to try to answer his question.
[00:55:35.212 --> 00:55:38.112]  He was saying, how do we get a movement like that going here?
[00:55:38.112 --> 00:55:44.314]  What, you got 400,000 people, roughly, just shy of that living in Iceland, okay?
[00:55:46.964 --> 00:56:00.933]  And they're highly educated on average, one of the lowest crime rates in the world, and the banks came in and set up a derivative scheme with their government and basically leveraged them ten times their GDP a year.
[00:56:00.933 --> 00:56:02.814]  That's a conservative estimate.
[00:56:02.814 --> 00:56:05.456]  To get control of the nation's resources.
[00:56:05.456 --> 00:56:12.661]  They come in with fiat derivatives, instruments they know are going to implode in value, they make money selling it to them,
[00:56:14.096 --> 00:56:18.040]  And then when the country collapses, the banks come in and say, we own you.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:26.350]  And a year and a half ago, they were seizing Icelanders' bank accounts because the big banks there are Dutch, British, and U.S.
[00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:26.790]  owned.
[00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:27.451]  The three dominant.
[00:56:28.652 --> 00:56:34.374]  You can search engine the term anti-terror laws or terror laws used against Iceland.
[00:56:34.374 --> 00:56:43.898]  And the British government would seize people's bank accounts and would seize government resources and tried to block food being imported into the country.
[00:56:43.898 --> 00:56:45.819]  Well that made the public mad.
[00:56:45.819 --> 00:56:51.321]  For over a year they demonstrated and rioted in some cases and took over banks and protested.
[00:56:52.612 --> 00:56:55.254]  And then the banks threatened to totally shut the country down.
[00:56:55.254 --> 00:56:58.196]  They said, fine, we don't owe you this money.
[00:56:58.196 --> 00:57:01.798]  And this weekend they passed a referendum saying they're not going to pay him the money.
[00:57:01.798 --> 00:57:03.159]  It's not owed.
[00:57:03.159 --> 00:57:04.420]  And that the bank should be arrested.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.523]  They're a bunch of made-offs types.
[00:57:09.523 --> 00:57:16.028]  This is a major Western country saying no, identifying the criminality.
[00:57:16.028 --> 00:57:20.351]  Instead of paving the streets with gold for the corrupt oligarchs,
[00:57:21.912 --> 00:57:25.113]  The people are saying no to them, and the banks have now backed off.
[00:57:25.113 --> 00:57:27.695]  They said, okay, fine, fine.
[00:57:27.695 --> 00:57:32.357]  We already own enough assets in Iceland to pay this off.
[00:57:32.357 --> 00:57:33.897]  Turned out it was all a fraud.
[00:57:33.897 --> 00:57:36.398]  The banks didn't even need it.
[00:57:36.398 --> 00:57:50.725]  When I was on CBC Radio today, nationwide, it was actually taped, it's airing tomorrow morning, they say, I made the point to them that the banks are getting more power, record bonuses, bragging that they engineered the crisis.
[00:57:51.505 --> 00:57:59.410]  And then they cut to the other guest they had on who just said, I wasn't telling the truth, that the banks would never want to hurt the economy and that this isn't true.
[00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:12.098]  Well, it doesn't matter if the establishment sits up there and tells you the banks are loving and good and sweet and don't worry, they've got a plan for a world government to fix the global economic collapse.
[00:58:12.098 --> 00:58:14.700]  The people know who the enemy is.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.941]  We've identified the banks.
[00:58:16.941 --> 00:58:20.484]  But in America, we're not as awake as Iceland because people are still
[00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:23.409]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:23.409 --> 00:58:24.149]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.151 --> 00:58:54.693]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.693 --> 00:58:55.614]  Number one.
[00:58:55.614 --> 00:58:59.036]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.036 --> 00:58:59.896]  Number two.
[00:58:59.896 --> 00:59:04.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.779 --> 00:59:05.539]  It's true.
[00:59:05.539 --> 00:59:10.082]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.402 --> 00:59:11.223]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.223 --> 00:59:14.806]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.806 --> 00:59:18.729]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.729 --> 00:59:19.509]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.509 --> 00:59:22.271]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.271 --> 00:59:25.954]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.954 --> 00:59:26.755]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.755 --> 00:59:30.898]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.898 --> 00:59:35.662]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.942 --> 00:59:40.105]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.105 --> 00:59:41.887]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.351]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.351 --> 00:59:48.632]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:48.632 --> 00:59:48.952]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.261]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.002]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:11.583]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.164]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.164 --> 01:00:17.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:21.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.974 --> 01:00:33.716]  I was just talking to Tyrell Ventura there in the break.
[01:00:33.716 --> 01:00:35.337]  Exciting stuff going on.
[01:00:35.337 --> 01:00:39.019]  We'll be talking about with Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:39.019 --> 01:00:41.641]  Coming up, his father on Friday here.
[01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:43.822]  Alright, let's continue with some phone calls.
[01:00:43.822 --> 01:00:47.464]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in about seven minutes.
[01:00:47.464 --> 01:00:53.548]  And I want to go through a bunch of news and we'll continue with your calls and three very informative guests coming up.
[01:00:53.548 --> 01:00:55.329]  Let's talk to Jim in Illinois.
[01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:56.190]  You're on the air, Jim.
[01:00:57.499 --> 01:01:04.739]  Hey Alex, I was wondering if Friday when you talk to Bob you could have him go into specifics on how they're going to take the pension funds.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.541]  Because I've been trying to tell people that they won't listen.
[01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.381]  A lot of companies are already doing it.
[01:01:09.381 --> 01:01:20.244]  I mean, a lot of companies move their assets out, then the company goes belly up, and the bankers and shareholders, the dominant shareholders, pre-position themselves and actually take your pension funds.
[01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:21.605]  It's already going on.
[01:01:21.605 --> 01:01:30.107]  The federal government's announced they may take government and private pension funds to, quote, protect them, take part of the money, tax it, and then dole it out to you.
[01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.041]  Yeah, and then one other thing.
[01:01:33.041 --> 01:01:35.922]  I was wondering, I don't know, maybe this might make your job a little easier.
[01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:51.205]  If, like, maybe you could set up, like, a website where you could have, like, all your ghosts, your guests, like Chapman and Tarpley and all those regulars, where they could have, like, a weekly update, and then we can go down there and download it, because I make copies of all your movies and pass them out.
[01:01:51.205 --> 01:01:58.386]  Because sometimes when they, you know, you guys got to cover so much, when I hand this stuff to people, they think it's crazy, but where they could go into specifics,
[01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:01.547]  And then we could go every week and download it.
[01:02:01.547 --> 01:02:02.808]  Do you know what I mean, or no?
[01:02:02.808 --> 01:02:12.336]  Yeah, but that's like... I mean, it's hard enough to get guests on the air and run my radio show and make films and do everything else we're doing.
[01:02:12.336 --> 01:02:21.324]  I mean, look, if the public wants to be slaves and they want to be bankrupt and they want to be... I mean, it's not going to be like a Happy Meal given to them through the window in ten seconds.
[01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:25.466]  We do archive all the interviews at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:28.607]  We have free versions and lower audio quality at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:28.607 --> 01:02:29.488]  We have the podcast.
[01:02:29.488 --> 01:02:32.269]  We have the free Apple iPhone app.
[01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:34.550]  I mean, I put my films out for free.
[01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.411]  I don't know what else I can do.
[01:02:36.411 --> 01:02:40.913]  I mean, I can't educate your friends that think you're crazy in 10 seconds.
[01:02:40.913 --> 01:02:42.673]  Knowledge takes time and investment.
[01:02:42.673 --> 01:02:45.795]  I mean, take TerrorStorm, Endgame, Fall of the Republic.
[01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:56.079]  I mean, they'll get a four-year level education in the real way the world works, watching two or three of these seminal films, but I can't watch them for them.
[01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:57.119]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[01:02:57.119 --> 01:02:59.480]  I just can't do it.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.781]  Updates from each of my guests, boiling things down, making it simple.
[01:03:02.781 --> 01:03:04.582]  What, like a Reader's Digest?
[01:03:04.582 --> 01:03:13.465]  We do that every day with big boil-down articles, where we analyze, okay, here's a bill for national ID cards to have a job.
[01:03:14.497 --> 01:03:22.286]  We already have national ID cards, and they're going to make the illegals legal, and in one fell swoop make everyone have to have these to have a job.
[01:03:22.286 --> 01:03:24.188]  And then just legalize the illegals.
[01:03:24.188 --> 01:03:26.130]  That's in the Wall Street Journal today.
[01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:32.277]  And there's an article by Kurt Nemo, Schumer, Graham use immigration to push national biometric ID card for American citizens.
[01:03:34.326 --> 01:03:51.668]  I'm not mad at you, Jim, and I like listener ideas, but it does become somewhat of a pet peeve, not with you, but with the people you're trying to wake up, that you say you send them, say, an interview with Bob Chapman or Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or Max Keiser or any of these other brokers or economists or Ron Paul,
[01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:56.230]  And, you know, then they say, well, this is too long.
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:10.554]  OK, well, listen, it's not too long for you to watch Lost or House or Dancing with the Stars or The State of the Union or to play 10 hours a day of video games.
[01:04:10.554 --> 01:04:12.294]  And so that's what you want.
[01:04:12.294 --> 01:04:18.436]  You know, those people that won't listen to you, Jim, when you lovingly try to wake them up, they don't want to be informed.
[01:04:19.196 --> 01:04:30.565]  They want to go watch on average four and a half hours of TV a day and two hours of video games and text message their friends and look at porno all day and they want to get drunk and be lazy so they're going to get robbed.
[01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:36.430]  When you get lazy and ignorant and stupid, corrupt parasites, predators move in and rape the hell out of you.
[01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:41.193]  And so they're getting hit hard and they're going to get hit a lot worse because
[01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:43.583]  They don't care.
[01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:46.286]  They don't care about a million dead Iraqis and a fake war?
[01:04:46.286 --> 01:04:49.088]  Well, the police state doesn't care about them here either.
[01:04:49.088 --> 01:04:53.452]  And so they're gonna, you know, what the globalists will do to other countries, they want to do to us.
[01:04:53.452 --> 01:04:54.773]  They just can't get our guns.
[01:04:54.773 --> 01:04:59.418]  That's the one thing holding them back from an absolute just murder spree.
[01:05:00.748 --> 01:05:01.909]  What's your home worth?
[01:05:01.909 --> 01:05:04.030]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:07.071]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:17.243]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[01:06:17.663 --> 01:06:24.030]  For example, with each pre-production order of three 7-Day Responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:26.192]  That's Buy 3, Get 1 Free.
[01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:29.095]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.

[01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:07.888]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:07:07.888 --> 01:07:14.291]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.

[01:07:53.516 --> 01:07:54.456]  I am a shotgun rider.
[01:08:09.745 --> 01:08:14.306]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[01:08:14.306 --> 01:08:18.988]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[01:08:18.988 --> 01:08:28.690]  I was riding on the folk coast and everything was fine, until we took a shorter road to save some time.
[01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:33.692]  Bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:38.253]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[01:08:41.773 --> 01:08:47.414]  Cause I'll ride again.
[01:08:47.414 --> 01:08:49.495]  I am a river gambler.
[01:08:49.495 --> 01:08:51.915]  I make a living dealing cards.
[01:08:51.915 --> 01:08:54.216]  My clothes are smooth and honest.
[01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:56.156]  My heart is cold and hard.
[01:08:56.156 --> 01:09:01.497]  I was shuffling force and delta boys on a boat for New Orleans.
[01:09:01.497 --> 01:09:06.058]  I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen.
[01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:10.319]  But the captain bumped a sandbar and a lace fell from my sleeve.
[01:09:11.343 --> 01:09:14.649]  They threw me overboard and I swore I didn't cheat
[01:09:17.739 --> 01:09:19.461]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:21.842]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:21.842 --> 01:09:32.170]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer with key 9-11 information and the latest on Pakistan claiming they captured Adam Gadahn, then reporting they hadn't captured him.
[01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:35.533]  That's coming up in about 25 minutes from now.
[01:09:35.533 --> 01:09:44.719]  Chris Pinto, documentary filmmaker and then member of the Icelandic Parliament, Birgitta Jones-Dottier, will be joining us on that key fight in the last hour.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:53.343]  She'll be joining us also, not just on the radio, but at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv, getting a lot of new members.
[01:09:53.343 --> 01:09:59.525]  We're excited so many of you are joining us over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:59.525 --> 01:10:05.067]  Okay, let me get into the most important news that we're facing and dealing with, and it all ties together.
[01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:07.988]  In fact, give me a document cam shot, boys.
[01:10:07.988 --> 01:10:08.868]  Thank you.
[01:10:08.868 --> 01:10:10.489]  Wall Street Journal today.
[01:10:11.622 --> 01:10:16.730]  ID card for workers is at center of immigration plan.
[01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:22.579]  This is a complete retread of what the CFR report said six years ago.
[01:10:22.579 --> 01:10:26.525]  They write many of the big homeland security policies, then it gets passed as law.
[01:10:28.772 --> 01:10:29.072]  I think?
[01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:51.841]  By the third time they were failing, they said, we're going to make the amnesty plan secret.
[01:10:51.841 --> 01:10:53.323]  That was the headlines.
[01:10:53.323 --> 01:10:59.008]  Senate keeps details of immigrant plans secret.
[01:10:59.008 --> 01:11:00.209]  You can pull those articles up.
[01:11:00.209 --> 01:11:03.212]  In fact, we did pull them up.
[01:11:03.212 --> 01:11:07.656]  And this is the deception of government.
[01:11:07.656 --> 01:11:11.579]  And then Senator Sessions, to his credit, would not go along with it.
[01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:12.320]  And he leaked it.
[01:11:13.459 --> 01:11:21.162]  He had the 20 smoking guns piece that he wrote, giving the subsections of the bill.
[01:11:21.162 --> 01:11:30.767]  Not only complete total amnesty, but all illegal aliens would be legalized, including felons, aggravated felons, rapists, arsonists, armed robbers.
[01:11:30.767 --> 01:11:31.407]  This is in the bill.
[01:11:33.147 --> 01:11:38.629]  And they would swear to not do it again and be completely legalized.
[01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:45.411]  And for six years, it was sunsetted out after six years, they could bring unlimited family members into the United States.
[01:11:45.411 --> 01:11:53.654]  So you think it's bad with 30 million illegals driving down wages, bankrupting the welfare system, hundreds of millions of people wanting to come here.
[01:11:53.654 --> 01:11:57.635]  Imagine what this would do, allowing them to bring in massive amounts of family.
[01:11:58.993 --> 01:12:00.353]  It was a total amnesty plan.
[01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:01.494]  It was more than that.
[01:12:01.494 --> 01:12:11.437]  It was a complete and total, well, the equivalent of a gubernatorial presidential pardon for criminals.
[01:12:11.437 --> 01:12:21.961]  Now, in that plan, and remember, this was written up by the Security and Prosperity Partnership at their Banff Canada meeting in 2006, and Judicial Watch sued and got the documents.
[01:12:23.248 --> 01:12:27.511]  It stated, we're going to sell legalization in the name of legalizing the immigrants.
[01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:29.272]  We'll make them completely legal.
[01:12:29.272 --> 01:12:32.834]  We'll give them a work ID card they'll have to have.
[01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:38.558]  But then citizens will have to have this to have a job, not just your federalized driver's license.
[01:12:38.558 --> 01:12:42.181]  And to back that up, I pulled up human events from 7-17-2006.
[01:12:48.513 --> 01:12:52.374]  And it says, are you ready for the North American Union ID card?
[01:12:52.374 --> 01:12:56.136]  And then it goes in to the SPP internal documents.
[01:12:56.136 --> 01:12:58.697]  So that's Human Events Newspaper.
[01:12:58.697 --> 01:13:01.178]  And of course, Lou Dobbs covered it at the time.
[01:13:01.178 --> 01:13:04.399]  This new legislation is identical.
[01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:06.320]  And it's public, but they're selling it.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.401]  Oh, we're gonna criminalize the illegals.
[01:13:09.401 --> 01:13:11.662]  Well, yeah, because the illegals won't be illegal anymore.
[01:13:11.662 --> 01:13:13.363]  It's a lawyer mind trick.
[01:13:13.363 --> 01:13:16.524]  It's like Clinton saying, well, it depends on what the definition of is is.
[01:13:18.243 --> 01:13:21.926]  It's saying, we don't want global government, we want global governance.
[01:13:21.926 --> 01:13:25.109]  Governance means government, and in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:37.279]  So they play these little games, and Kurt Nimmo has written a boil-down, he links to this article, in a key story he wrote this morning, Schumer-Graham use immigration to push national biometric ID card.
[01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:41.683]  Now, as usual, before they can even pass this, they're already implementing it.
[01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:48.400]  Five states already put taxes, carbon taxes, on cars that they claim use too much fuel.
[01:13:50.373 --> 01:13:52.394]  They've passed no laws federally to do this.
[01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.055]  They're just doing it.
[01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:54.656]  In fact, here's an example.
[01:13:54.656 --> 01:13:57.938]  New cars in California must display global warming score.
[01:13:57.938 --> 01:14:02.121]  And there's a tax that's assessed on the auto dealer that's passed on to the customer.
[01:14:02.121 --> 01:14:03.582]  In fact, here's that article.
[01:14:03.582 --> 01:14:07.504]  New cars in California must display global warming score.
[01:14:07.504 --> 01:14:09.906]  And here's an actual photo of one.
[01:14:09.906 --> 01:14:12.067]  One of our California listeners sent us.
[01:14:12.067 --> 01:14:13.749]  Global warming score.
[01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:14.769]  Smog score.
[01:14:14.769 --> 01:14:16.390]  Made up global warming.
[01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:17.471]  Not scientific.
[01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:18.672]  A fraud.
[01:14:18.672 --> 01:14:19.833]  But they're going to tax you.
[01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:28.339]  And the Senate announced that they're going to go ahead and try to pass a bill to just put taxes on all fuel at the refinery.
[01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:30.981]  And this is what the oil companies are asking for.
[01:14:30.981 --> 01:14:33.523]  That was in the New York Times Sunday.
[01:14:33.523 --> 01:14:35.225]  Oil companies request
[01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:44.256]  ExxonMobil, Dutch Royal Shell, all of them requesting the taxes because they're owned and run by the big central banks.
[01:14:44.256 --> 01:14:45.557]  That came out two years ago.
[01:14:45.557 --> 01:14:48.340]  David Rockefeller went to a Dutch Royal Shell meeting.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.001]  He went to an ExxonMobil meeting.
[01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:51.643]  He owned a bunch of stock in ExxonMobil.
[01:14:51.643 --> 01:14:55.406]  He said, I'm going to fire you, Rex Tillerson, if you don't do this.
[01:14:55.406 --> 01:14:56.887]  And so they said, okay, we got religion.
[01:14:56.887 --> 01:14:58.729]  It's real.
[01:14:58.729 --> 01:15:00.330]  We'll just pass the tax on.
[01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:00.991]  Go ahead and hit us.
[01:15:03.737 --> 01:15:24.863]  Now, the reason, in fact, here's another Wall Street Journal article about it, Economics Creating Environmental Capital, and it's the head of Dutch Royal Shell, Peter Vosser, you know, all the heads of the big oil companies, right here, saying that they want these taxes.
[01:15:24.863 --> 01:15:27.524]  This is in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:35.026]  So every time you hear, oh, you work for the oil companies, you don't want all these taxes, you're saying global warming isn't real.
[01:15:35.026 --> 01:15:40.749]  The oil companies, especially Dutch Rochelle, BP and others, for 20 years have been pushing this.
[01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:42.370]  This is run by them.
[01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:49.394]  Just like the healthcare takeover was written by the insurance companies, and every time it looks like it's about to pass, their stock shoots up.
[01:15:49.394 --> 01:15:54.336]  They gave four times the money to Obama they did McCain, because he promised to ram this through.
[01:15:54.336 --> 01:15:55.917]  Doesn't matter, McCain's supporting it as well.
[01:15:57.816 --> 01:16:01.820]  So Schumer-Graham used immigration to push a National Biometric ID Card.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:10.648]  Now, again, before they can even pass this law, the government offers it to the slaves.
[01:16:10.648 --> 01:16:12.350]  Oh, you travel from the U.S.
[01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:14.272]  to Mexico or from Mexico to the U.S.
[01:16:14.272 --> 01:16:14.832]  or from the U.S.
[01:16:14.832 --> 01:16:15.553]  to Canada?
[01:16:15.553 --> 01:16:19.797]  Well, they don't tell you in the Canadian TV ads that are produced exactly the same.
[01:16:21.049 --> 01:16:23.511]  In fact, we've shown them side-by-side, only have time to show the U.S.
[01:16:23.511 --> 01:16:24.072]  version.
[01:16:24.072 --> 01:16:25.433]  It's almost identical.
[01:16:25.433 --> 01:16:28.716]  The Mexican one, in Spanish, is almost identical.
[01:16:28.716 --> 01:16:31.498]  Same video, same production.
[01:16:31.498 --> 01:16:36.643]  They don't tell you that under this agreement, the Mexicans can come in here with it.
[01:16:36.643 --> 01:16:47.172]  Or the Canadians can come in here with it, and now they're just gonna say, free open travel, the UNSPP, North American Union Plan, it's a free-for-all now, if you have this card.
[01:16:48.973 --> 01:16:53.886]  And then you can come in and once you have a baby here, then you get all the welfare, the anchor babies, all of it.
[01:16:56.192 --> 01:16:59.873]  Now, you tie that in with this next report.
[01:16:59.873 --> 01:17:05.154]  CNN lavishes coffee party with favorable coverage after a year of Tea Party demonization.
[01:17:05.154 --> 01:17:15.536]  Two months ago, I announced that if I have the time or that somebody else should do it, we should start a coffee party stronger than tea to take over the tea parties that we started from the Republicans.
[01:17:15.536 --> 01:17:17.477]  Well, the globalists are worse than that.
[01:17:17.477 --> 01:17:22.818]  They now have an open Obama operative setting up the coffee party and every time I turn the TV on,
[01:17:23.198 --> 01:17:24.379]  We've got it on in the coffee room.
[01:17:24.379 --> 01:17:26.561]  I'm not even watching more than 20 minutes a day.
[01:17:26.561 --> 01:17:27.842]  It's the tea party.
[01:17:27.842 --> 01:17:30.745]  I mean, the coffee party on there.
[01:17:30.745 --> 01:17:33.767]  And then I watch videos from MSNBC and CNN.
[01:17:33.767 --> 01:17:38.131]  We have these linked in the article that Watson wrote today at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:38.131 --> 01:17:44.817]  The illegal aliens, the ones you've seen by the millions protesting, waving Mexican flags, that's who's at these coffee parties.
[01:17:44.817 --> 01:17:50.582]  So, I knew this was coming and told my IT guy, you better get real CoffeeParty.com.
[01:17:52.196 --> 01:17:53.817]  Which we're launching tomorrow.
[01:17:53.817 --> 01:17:55.899]  Is it the real coffee party or real coffee party?
[01:17:55.899 --> 01:17:57.580]  Or we have both, don't we?
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:12.632]  The point is, is that we've got to fend off the Republicans trying to take over the Tea Parties and castrate them, geld them with a real code of constitutional systems and populism for freedom.
[01:18:12.632 --> 01:18:20.158]  And we've got to fend off the Obama takeover because the system wants to come in and take over the resistance to this globalist takeover.
[01:18:22.421 --> 01:18:33.530]  So we're going to get more into that, but I want to play, going out to break, the Hemispheric ID card ad that's been running for more than a year all over TV, and they have a radio version of this as well.
[01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:39.195]  So this is your North American Union ID card, but under this bill, you will need this to have a job.
[01:18:39.195 --> 01:18:44.579]  And the Canadians and Mexicans can come here, and we can go there, vice versa, and have jobs with this.
[01:18:44.579 --> 01:18:46.541]  But of course, it'll be selectively enforced.
[01:18:46.541 --> 01:18:47.282]  Only the U.S.
[01:18:47.282 --> 01:18:48.343]  is going to allow this.
[01:18:48.343 --> 01:18:50.644]  Canada and Mexico never honor their agreements.
[01:18:50.644 --> 01:18:50.985]  Here it is.
[01:18:52.469 --> 01:18:59.855]  From painted deserts set ablaze to snow-capped mountain peaks, our travels last for only days, but our spirits soar for weeks.
[01:18:59.855 --> 01:19:03.938]  The salty air, a comfy chair, a place we can unwind.
[01:19:03.938 --> 01:19:08.101]  But what it is we really miss is the home we left behind.
[01:19:08.101 --> 01:19:16.327]  On June 1st, 2009, new document requirements will make getting home from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean by land or sea more efficient.
[01:19:16.327 --> 01:19:19.810]  Learn more about the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative at GetUHome.gov.
[01:19:21.812 --> 01:19:32.122]  Okay, so what they do is they show you driver's license, and then show them transform and turn, if you look, into North American travel passes.
[01:19:32.122 --> 01:19:41.271]  And so they're saying in the bill, we're going to give these to all the illegal aliens, because we've got to know what they're doing, and just legalize them.
[01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:44.615]  So this will fix illegal immigration, because it will just make it all legal.
[01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:48.524]  This is the UN plan.
[01:19:48.524 --> 01:19:49.825]  This is what they're doing to Europe.
[01:19:49.825 --> 01:19:55.009]  It's come out that in England and in Europe, they have secret deals to let in unlimited illegal aliens.
[01:19:55.009 --> 01:19:58.772]  Then they organize them into a political force to be used on the indigenous people.
[01:19:58.772 --> 01:19:59.433]  The Coffee Party.
[01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:06.109]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:22:01.205 --> 01:22:07.869]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.869 --> 01:22:10.551]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[01:22:12.222 --> 01:22:17.666]  ...of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:25.851]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:25.851 --> 01:22:30.835]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:36.379]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:36.379 --> 01:22:40.743]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:40.743 --> 01:22:41.823]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:23:04.076 --> 01:23:05.717]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[01:23:05.717 --> 01:23:17.160]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.121]  There is!
[01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:21.862]  It's called Sinophresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.
[01:23:22.202 --> 01:23:22.483]  I think so.

[01:24:01.377 --> 01:24:05.021]  Putting the structure of power, as we know it, on trial.
[01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:15.351]  There's a new film that seeks to do just that, looking at the history of political power, scandal, and the vision of some of the most well-known leaders in the world, and how they shaped it.
[01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:21.017]  Jason Burmess is a radio host and filmmaker, and is behind a new movie that we're talking about right now.
[01:24:21.017 --> 01:24:24.120]  It's called The Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[01:24:24.981 --> 01:24:31.125]  Hey there Jason, I just checked out the trailer for your film and it looks like you've strung together a lot of historical footage.
[01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:36.067]  Many of it former US presidents talking about the need for a new world order.
[01:24:36.067 --> 01:24:38.229]  Talk about this concept and what it means to you.
[01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:48.059]  Well, throughout history, men of power have seeked to bring together the world under one government.
[01:24:48.059 --> 01:24:51.019]  And they've called this the New World Order.
[01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:58.881]  Whether it be Hitler during World War II or George Bush after the Gulf War, they all seem to use this terminology.
[01:24:58.881 --> 01:25:05.163]  So I decided to explore that and see what a New World Order really was and try to define that term.
[01:25:05.163 --> 01:25:06.363]  And what did you find?
[01:25:08.735 --> 01:25:24.742]  Well, I found that through organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, and many others, they have consolidated power on a mass level and are moving towards a world government.
[01:25:24.742 --> 01:25:32.906]  You're seeing this more and more with events like the G20 calling for a world currency and SDR units as the new reserve currency.
[01:25:32.906 --> 01:25:37.188]  So I'm really out to expose this agenda to not only the American people, but the world.
[01:25:38.277 --> 01:25:50.155]  I understand that you did also some work on the film Loose Change 9-11, which challenges what the authorities have said about 9-11 and identifies some of the main points of what's now becoming the 9-11 truth movement.
[01:25:50.155 --> 01:25:53.159]  Does the Invisible Empire deal with this issue at all?
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.960]  Well, absolutely.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:02.942]  Actually, my last film, Fabled Enemies, exposed the international intelligence organization surrounding 9-11.
[01:26:02.942 --> 01:26:18.726]  Instead of focusing on the anomalies at the World Trade Center, at WTC7, or Shanksville, we expose the Saudi Arabian, the Pakistani, the Israeli, and shadow government connections, and are now taking this a step further with Invisible Empire, a new world order to find.
[01:26:18.726 --> 01:26:24.168]  And this will be premiering at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, April 15th, for the world to see.
[01:26:25.023 --> 01:26:29.230]  And as you just mentioned, you're releasing it on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:36.561]  Did you try at all to get this released on the big screen or to get some investors to back you so it can become more well-known by the public?
[01:26:38.615 --> 01:26:43.958]  Well, to be honest with you, I've tried to go that route before, and it can be an extremely difficult process.
[01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:49.382]  And with my films being seen by tens of millions of people online for free, that gets the message out.
[01:26:49.382 --> 01:26:54.665]  And we encourage people to take our films, make copies, and hand them out, because this is not about money.
[01:26:54.665 --> 01:27:00.628]  This is about getting the information to the public, so that we can try to restore the Constitution and Bill of Rights in this country.
[01:27:00.628 --> 01:27:03.070]  This is to oppose tyranny, not to make a profit.
[01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:06.931]  I'm curious about Invisible Empire itself.
[01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:11.379]  Give me some of the specifics, the premise, and what you hope your viewers will get out of it.
[01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:20.273]  Well, a lot of times when people use the term New World Order, you're already into the conspiracy arena.
[01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:25.377]  And I literally have over 200 prominent people discussing that very term.
[01:27:25.377 --> 01:27:33.384]  So I want to shatter the image of what a New World Order means, and really put out the facts, the truth about this agenda.
[01:27:33.384 --> 01:27:35.045]  And that's what I've done in this film.
[01:27:35.045 --> 01:27:41.170]  Not only going over their organizations, but also their modes of control, such as assassination and false flag terror.
[01:27:41.747 --> 01:27:46.712]  You were contrasting, I noticed, especially in the trailer, some leaders.
[01:27:46.712 --> 01:27:48.654]  For example, you had Hitler in there.
[01:27:48.654 --> 01:27:52.698]  You also had, you know, President Kennedy, President Bush.
[01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:58.044]  Talk a little bit about, I mean, you seem to be arguing that there's sort of a congruent message between these leaders.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.162]  Well, I don't think that I put Kennedy in a negative light.
[01:28:03.162 --> 01:28:13.530]  Kennedy warned us that secret societies and backdoor dealings were a major problem during his presidency, and we know where that led to, his assassination.
[01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:20.935]  So, when we have a person like George Bush espousing a New World Order under the United Nations and global governance,
[01:28:21.255 --> 01:28:28.977]  And then on the other side of the supposed spectrum, we have people like Al Gore calling for the same exact thing and Bill Clinton calling for the same exact thing.
[01:28:28.977 --> 01:28:32.958]  In this film, you'll see Bill Clinton talk about a new world order not once but twice.
[01:28:32.958 --> 01:28:37.839]  So really, I want to expose this, like you said, congruent agenda for world government.
[01:28:37.839 --> 01:28:41.599]  All right, Jason Bermas, thanks so much for giving us that inside look on your upcoming film.
[01:28:41.599 --> 01:28:44.080]  Comes out, Invisible Empire, comes out April 15th.
[01:28:59.308 --> 01:29:13.896]  I wanted to play Jason on RT yesterday doing a great job in the pre-build-up to the new film Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, but I like the term they used, The New World Order on Trial.
[01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:15.757]  In fact, we're finishing the back cover right now.
[01:29:15.757 --> 01:29:17.358]  The film is now officially done.
[01:29:17.358 --> 01:29:19.559]  Perhaps that should be the thing on the back.
[01:29:19.559 --> 01:29:21.240]  A New World Order on Trial.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:31.602]  Because we've been debating the catch line on the back of the film, or their greatest secrets revealed, or the secrets, you know, secrets exposed.
[01:29:31.602 --> 01:29:33.602]  I'm not sure, but I wanted to play that.
[01:29:33.602 --> 01:29:39.603]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer coming up, and your phone calls and a lot more.
[01:29:39.603 --> 01:29:48.685]  We'll continue to break down all the incredible news, legislation now in the Congress to secretly arrest and torture American citizens for any reason the Pentagon wishes.
[01:29:51.502 --> 01:29:54.504]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.504 --> 01:30:00.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.848 --> 01:30:07.512]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.512 --> 01:30:12.636]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.636 --> 01:30:18.880]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:27.582]  They sow pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they feel
[01:30:29.864 --> 01:30:34.447]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:34.447 --> 01:30:39.509]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:30:39.509 --> 01:30:41.670]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:43.451]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.451 --> 01:30:46.333]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.333 --> 01:30:52.956]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:52.956 --> 01:30:55.678]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:55.678 --> 01:30:58.900]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[01:31:01.573 --> 01:31:05.237]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.237 --> 01:31:08.841]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.841 --> 01:31:13.647]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.647 --> 01:31:20.034]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.034 --> 01:31:22.277]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.797 --> 01:31:23.097]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.097 --> 01:31:23.618]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.618 --> 01:31:24.258]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.258 --> 01:31:24.939]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:24.939 --> 01:31:27.060]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.710 --> 01:31:43.551]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:43.551 --> 01:31:48.975]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:48.975 --> 01:31:58.100]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:02.571]  George Washington said,
[01:32:18.888 --> 01:32:19.228]  I think so.
[01:32:36.169 --> 01:32:36.730]  We're good to go.
[01:33:19.491 --> 01:33:23.619]  We are live ladies and gentlemen one hour and 33 minutes into this transmission.
[01:33:26.496 --> 01:33:30.058]  We're launching the coffee party, as I announced two months ago we were going to do.
[01:33:30.058 --> 01:33:34.019]  Now Obama has launched a fake coffee party, and we've analyzed it.
[01:33:34.019 --> 01:33:35.940]  It's run by one of his former operatives.
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.901]  It's an illegal alien party.
[01:33:37.901 --> 01:33:42.283]  And you talk about treason, bringing illegal aliens in and then using them as a political weapon.
[01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.043]  This is amazing.
[01:33:43.043 --> 01:33:46.485]  We're going to be covering this more coming up in the rest of the broadcast.
[01:33:46.485 --> 01:33:53.508]  But for the next 25 minutes, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, highly decorated veteran, they had
[01:33:55.245 --> 01:33:56.185]  Al Qaeda targeted.
[01:33:56.185 --> 01:33:59.746]  They had Osama Bin Laden targeted in the months before 9-11.
[01:33:59.746 --> 01:34:00.766]  We're not allowed to go in.
[01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:02.947]  A lot of that's been declassified.
[01:34:02.947 --> 01:34:03.987]  Quite a bit of it isn't.
[01:34:03.987 --> 01:34:09.008]  His new book coming out in a few months is going to detail, but it's going through the review process with the Pentagon.
[01:34:09.008 --> 01:34:18.910]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shavers, a Bronze Star recipient, more than 25 years of experience in the intelligence community, including directing the Defense Intelligence Agency Task Force, Stratus Ivy.
[01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:34.159]  Under the lead, Stratis IV conducted some of the most daring and innovative human intelligence collection and information operation ever undertaken by the Department of Defense, as well as providing information to support the SOCOM program, Able Danger.
[01:34:34.159 --> 01:34:41.323]  And he is currently a senior fellow with the External Communications Director of Special Lecture at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, Washington, D.C.
[01:34:41.323 --> 01:34:46.106]  He instructs classes in psychology of terrorism and intelligence analyst.
[01:34:46.106 --> 01:34:48.027]  And we're honored to have him on with us.
[01:34:48.027 --> 01:34:48.608]  Good to have you here.
[01:34:49.244 --> 01:34:49.825]  Good to be on.
[01:34:49.825 --> 01:34:50.645]  Thank you again, Alex.
[01:34:50.645 --> 01:34:51.246]  Have a good weekend.
[01:34:51.246 --> 01:34:54.228]  I'll be back.
[01:34:54.228 --> 01:35:10.263]  I want to recap your story, get into the latest developments, but you had said off-air to me you saw my piece on Geraldo Saturday, and I thought it suspicious that within an hour and five minutes the media was already knowing this guy was supposedly a 9-11 truther.
[01:35:11.604 --> 01:35:15.568]  Well, I think, obviously, there are people looking for
[01:35:32.538 --> 01:35:36.759]  Rationale and reasons for actions that clearly are random.
[01:35:36.759 --> 01:35:44.221]  In some cases, I think you mentioned, we talked about how there's kooks out there, who simply get well off the beaten path.
[01:35:44.221 --> 01:35:48.782]  They adapt whatever view they think is closest to their view of the world.
[01:35:48.782 --> 01:35:52.663]  And I think in this case, the individual just lost it.
[01:35:52.663 --> 01:36:00.425]  And I'm the anti-terrorism officer of the division I'm in right now, too, and this is something the Army's actually looking at, is how individuals
[01:36:01.368 --> 01:36:03.590]  Can become unstable.
[01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:06.932]  And it's an issue which happens all across society.
[01:36:06.932 --> 01:36:14.397]  As a matter of fact, I recall hearing today, somewhere else, one of the individuals went bonkers and started shooting people again in a workplace.
[01:36:14.397 --> 01:36:22.803]  So, you know, to try to equivocate a coup's attack on the Pentagon, and try to lump it into a larger organization,
[01:36:23.503 --> 01:36:27.567]  Simply doesn't make sense, especially when you're talking about doing it within hours of the event.
[01:36:27.567 --> 01:36:32.832]  I mean, you and I both know to do a thorough investigation, even do a triage investigation, it would take days.
[01:36:32.832 --> 01:36:41.601]  So, you know, for anyone to jump within hours and say, this guy is associated, you've got to wonder what the agenda is, because clearly someone's not being objective.
[01:36:41.601 --> 01:36:46.606]  And it's funny, because if, and I'm going to say this is probably politically correct, if the guy was Muslim,
[01:36:47.066 --> 01:36:52.612]  They would have taken hours and days to try to push away the fact that he was of Muslim descent.
[01:36:52.612 --> 01:36:56.035]  Because, you know, there's a complete opposite take.
[01:36:56.035 --> 01:37:05.946]  If someone with a certain background, for example, the Major Hassan, it took him nearly five hours to disclose that he had a Middle Eastern name.
[01:37:06.506 --> 01:37:10.769]  So there's a real problem with perception going on in the press right now.
[01:37:10.769 --> 01:37:13.691]  They're ready to jump one way, but they will not jump another.
[01:37:13.691 --> 01:37:19.035]  And this to me tells of the fact that there's a real problem with objective reporting.
[01:37:19.035 --> 01:37:21.257]  Okay, well take the Fort Hood shooting.
[01:37:21.257 --> 01:37:22.578]  It turned out for two years.
[01:37:23.118 --> 01:37:25.879]  He was walking around praising suicide bombers.
[01:37:25.879 --> 01:37:29.360]  He was communicating with these Al-Qaeda operatives who are well-known.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.602]  And the CIA has declared national security and won't give Congress those emails.
[01:37:34.602 --> 01:37:41.564]  With the shooter at the Pentagon, his family warned months before and weeks before about it.
[01:37:41.564 --> 01:37:42.665]  Nothing was done.
[01:37:42.665 --> 01:37:43.745]  We have the underwear bomber.
[01:37:43.745 --> 01:37:46.766]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but it even came out in Detroit News.
[01:37:46.766 --> 01:37:51.047]  The undersecretary of the State Department said, we were ordered by an unnamed U.S.
[01:37:51.047 --> 01:37:52.148]  intelligence agency
[01:37:52.748 --> 01:37:55.989]  Sounds just like what happened to you and Stratus Ivy.
[01:37:55.989 --> 01:38:12.277]  We were told to let him have his visa and help him get on the plane, and we have the witnesses, Kurt Haskell and others on the plane, saying a sharp-dressed man without ID, without passport, got him through security in Amsterdam, passed the scanners, onto the plane.
[01:38:12.277 --> 01:38:15.058]  The FBI said that wasn't true at first, now said, okay,
[01:38:15.678 --> 01:38:16.619]  It is true.
[01:38:16.619 --> 01:38:19.342]  It looks like something more is going on.
[01:38:19.342 --> 01:38:23.067]  I mean, at bare minimum, they're leaving the door open for these people.
[01:38:24.141 --> 01:38:30.306]  Well, there's a real risk versus gain, and let me divert just a bit here, but I think it's still on topic.
[01:38:30.306 --> 01:38:32.748]  I believe the Bahtadar arrest was something similar.
[01:38:32.748 --> 01:38:40.735]  I think we were, frankly, getting a lot of intel take out of Bahtadar while he was still in, and Bahtadar, for those of you who are listening to this, may not understand who he is.
[01:38:40.735 --> 01:38:47.121]  He was the number two guy, number two Taliban guy in Pakistan, wrapped up in Karachi a while back, just a few weeks ago.
[01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:56.144]  I'm hearing, and I got this both from British sources and American sources, he was kind of neutralized where he was at.
[01:38:56.144 --> 01:38:57.524]  He was being monitored.
[01:38:57.524 --> 01:39:01.566]  And Alex, that's one of the things that the television community does do.
[01:39:01.566 --> 01:39:03.587]  They will target someone and let them sit.
[01:39:03.587 --> 01:39:10.749]  They will know everything he's doing because the simple fact of their existence and their actions allows us to track back who they're talking to.
[01:39:10.749 --> 01:39:12.290]  And again, this goes back to Able Danger.
[01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:13.350]  That was what we were doing.
[01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:15.252]  We had a few known contacts.
[01:39:15.252 --> 01:39:16.152]  We wanted them to exist.
[01:39:16.152 --> 01:39:19.255]  We wanted to see who they were talking to and figure out where the cells were.
[01:39:19.255 --> 01:39:20.276]  I mean, it's all linked together.
[01:39:20.276 --> 01:39:21.457]  It's one big happy family.
[01:39:21.457 --> 01:39:22.738]  It's a social network.
[01:39:22.738 --> 01:39:31.525]  So I think when you look at the underwear bomber, it's very possible they were allowing him to do something and they may have thought this was a dry run.
[01:39:31.525 --> 01:39:32.546]  No, they've now said that.
[01:39:32.546 --> 01:39:33.367]  They've now admitted that.
[01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:34.348]  The State Department's admitted that.
[01:39:34.997 --> 01:39:41.784]  Yeah, frankly, we know that the Al-Qaeda, and especially when they're doing a major attack, will do rehearsals.
[01:39:41.784 --> 01:39:47.649]  James Woods, the actor James Woods, actually witnessed one of the rehearsals when he flew out of Boston right before 9-11.
[01:39:47.649 --> 01:39:50.292]  He actually reported it to the FBI and it kind of blew him off.
[01:39:50.292 --> 01:39:53.955]  So frankly, you know, that may have been what's been going on here, but it doesn't make it right.
[01:39:53.955 --> 01:39:58.520]  Because clearly the pieces were all there, there were indications this guy had been radicalized, he had been trained.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:07.565]  And going towards the idea of Badr Dar, I think Badr Dar was not arrested because we wanted to get more intelligence out of him.
[01:40:07.565 --> 01:40:16.450]  I think in some ways he was arrested to neutralize him because one of the things we have to remember, Alex, is Badr Dar was the main contact between the Taliban and the Pakistani ISI.
[01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:25.757]  So, you know, I think the last thing in the world the Pakistani ISI wants is a Taliban guy talking about who in the ISI, the Pakistani ISI is bad.
[01:40:25.757 --> 01:40:29.380]  So, you know, I preach this on the air every time I go on.
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.721]  You've got to look deeper in a story.
[01:40:30.721 --> 01:40:34.164]  You cannot take things at face value because there's always more.
[01:40:34.164 --> 01:40:40.409]  And frankly, there's multiple competing agendas and it's very tough, as you know, to get past the agendas and get to the truth.
[01:40:41.121 --> 01:40:45.202]  Well, let me expand on that because we know about the airlift of evil.
[01:40:45.202 --> 01:40:47.223]  Here's the MSNBC article.
[01:40:47.223 --> 01:40:50.824]  Why did we let Pakistan pull volunteers out of Kunduz?
[01:40:50.824 --> 01:40:56.565]  And over and over again, Special Forces commanders would capture top Taliban, Al Qaeda, and thousands of fighters.
[01:40:56.565 --> 01:40:59.266]  They were ordered, let them go, send them to Pakistan.
[01:41:00.126 --> 01:41:03.768]  And we know time and time again, you know, it's like this Adam Gadahn thing.
[01:41:03.768 --> 01:41:07.831]  They say Pakistan captured him, and then we hear, oh no, he wasn't captured.
[01:41:07.831 --> 01:41:08.852]  You know, was he pulled in?
[01:41:08.852 --> 01:41:16.877]  You know, he's the grandson of one of the ADL founders, this super anti-Muslim guy, then now he's the voice of Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:16.877 --> 01:41:17.837]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:41:17.837 --> 01:41:25.822]  We know there's all these double and triple agents out there, so we hear somebody gets captured over and over again, and we know about these airlifts of evil.
[01:41:25.822 --> 01:41:26.683]  What's your take on that?
[01:41:27.475 --> 01:41:29.176]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:41:29.176 --> 01:41:33.179]  I mean, that's one of the issues we have to look at here is, what is the real story?
[01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:37.702]  And let's talk about the Ghaddan thing or Pakistan in general.
[01:41:37.702 --> 01:41:44.847]  Frankly, one of the things that's been seen several times lately is the Pakistanis trying to maintain control of the Taliban.
[01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:51.271]  And in many ways, they see the Taliban as Iran sees Hezbollah.
[01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:57.175]  They do view it as a separate but capable component of their national strength.
[01:41:57.802 --> 01:42:06.927]  Therefore, when you start looking at how it works, who's involved, you've really got to question what their motives are, what the Pakistani motives are, when they do anything.
[01:42:06.927 --> 01:42:08.808]  And to underscore your point, absolutely.
[01:42:08.808 --> 01:42:20.874]  Back in 2003 was one of the first indicators that we knew, and I briefed General Labardo, the commander of forces on it, that Taliban ISI elements were not only participating, they were captured.
[01:42:20.874 --> 01:42:23.776]  There was an ISI female operative captured.
[01:42:24.296 --> 01:42:24.637]  I think so.
[01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:39.533]  We're good.
[01:42:55.402 --> 01:43:07.005]  To re-insinuate themselves into the negotiations with us, the Taliban, because they know if the Taliban breaks off, you know, from them and negotiates with us, the Pakistanis lose.
[01:43:07.005 --> 01:43:08.025]  They lose control.
[01:43:08.025 --> 01:43:17.208]  So I think you need to look at everything that goes on here as a big chessboard and figure out that sometimes sacrificing a pawn is a good thing if that means you can protect your queen.
[01:43:19.168 --> 01:43:20.529]  And I think that's what we're doing here.
[01:43:20.529 --> 01:43:21.569]  That's what's going on here.
[01:43:21.569 --> 01:43:27.713]  Every time a move is made, you've got to look at the chessboard and figure out, okay, what's going on over here on the other side of the chessboard?
[01:43:27.713 --> 01:43:29.614]  What did we not see?
[01:43:29.614 --> 01:43:34.357]  And for example, the Marja campaign.
[01:43:34.357 --> 01:43:37.859]  You know, again, that's been something that's been going on for a while.
[01:43:37.859 --> 01:43:43.582]  We have yet to understand what, if any, effect that's going to have on long-term winning of the war.
[01:43:43.582 --> 01:43:48.645]  And winning, again, I think you and I talked about this, but we have to redefine our definition of victory, of winning.
[01:43:49.309 --> 01:43:55.792]  So, you know, we've got to look at this, we've got to look at Pakistan and Afghanistan as a whole, and we cannot win Afghanistan.
[01:43:55.792 --> 01:44:03.336]  Whatever measure, whatever definition you use to define winning or victory, we cannot win in Afghanistan unless we win in Pakistan.
[01:44:03.336 --> 01:44:08.679]  And right now, I think the picture is too muddled to make a good judgment if we're making progress in Pakistan or not.
[01:44:08.679 --> 01:44:10.540]  Well, let's expand on that, though.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:11.761]  I mean, you go back to...
[01:44:13.103 --> 01:44:20.508]  1993, it came out in the New York Times and CBS News, and we now have the FBI tapes, they were declassified last year, that were in the trial.
[01:44:20.508 --> 01:44:28.273]  The FBI goes in, hires Ahmad Salam, an Egyptian intelligence officer, tells them we're going to set up local Muslim radicals.
[01:44:28.273 --> 01:44:30.895]  Both guys were borderline morons.
[01:44:30.895 --> 01:44:35.618]  They cook the bomb, they train the driver, and then they say, we're not going to do the sting, we're going to let it go ahead.
[01:44:35.618 --> 01:44:37.460]  Ahmad Salam starts recording them.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:49.562]  Telling him that yes, you were hired, you were told to build a dummy bomb, then we changed it to a real bomb, now we're letting it go ahead, clearly as a way to get more funding, crack down a police state.
[01:44:49.562 --> 01:44:58.124]  We have the Homeland Security MYAC report documents that came out last year where most of Homeland Security is now for gun owners, veterans, libertarians, conservatives.
[01:44:58.124 --> 01:45:04.745]  This whole anti-terror apparatus is really being used as a cashless society taxing and control grid.
[01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:20.085]  Uh, we have Sybil Edmonds saying now, until the day of 9-11, that the US elements of it, uh, involved with the Turks and involved with the Pakistanis and CIA and Mossad and British MI6 were all, in her words,
[01:45:21.881 --> 01:45:27.444]  Running Al-Qaeda or elements of it on the day of 9-11 and she's gagged.
[01:45:27.444 --> 01:45:30.065]  Now, A, is she a liar in your view?
[01:45:30.065 --> 01:45:31.445]  Or why is she saying this?
[01:45:31.445 --> 01:45:32.846]  Because the evidence backs her up.
[01:45:32.846 --> 01:45:34.267]  I mean, who are the players?
[01:45:34.267 --> 01:45:38.629]  Because I look at this from a Hegelian dialectic of problem-reaction-solution.
[01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:48.193]  Or from some of the Army field manuals that talk about false flag to, again, allow this to happen bare minimum as a pretext to launch new wars.
[01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:51.458]  Well, let me cover the question in two parts.
[01:45:51.458 --> 01:45:57.564]  First off, I know Sabella, I respect her, I think she's a wonderful woman, and I admire her work.
[01:45:57.564 --> 01:46:05.512]  She is very well spoken, and look, I gotta tell you, I've always been fascinated about the fact that they've been trying to gag her.
[01:46:05.512 --> 01:46:08.114]  I mean, to me, it's loathing.
[01:46:08.114 --> 01:46:09.916]  The more they try to shut her up, the more...
[01:46:12.326 --> 01:46:13.427]  Uh, credibility they give her.
[01:46:13.427 --> 01:46:14.849]  So I think I give her that right there.
[01:46:14.849 --> 01:46:20.133]  It's like, man, the more they try to sit on you, you know... And all the FBI agents that were gagged who tried to stop it.
[01:46:20.683 --> 01:46:22.905]  Well, and then there's some of her other associates.
[01:46:22.905 --> 01:46:33.876]  I know one of them was on the FAA red team and, you know, there was a recent thing on Facebook I was watching kind of go where Condoleezza Rice talked about no one could imagine aircraft being used as weapons.
[01:46:33.876 --> 01:46:38.500]  Well, I don't see the FAA was training against that scenario for years before 9-11.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:44.086]  So, and that's all, you know, again, what one of Sabato's... The Pentagon ran a drill the year before of it happening.
[01:46:45.691 --> 01:46:56.800]  I think, you know, this is one of those things where I think everybody can speculate all day, and I think Sabel has given some extraordinarily clear clues to follow up.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.043]  The problem is always to get someone to investigate.
[01:47:01.043 --> 01:47:06.267]  And this is one of the things I've talked about both with my issue, with the 9-11 issue, with some of these other things.
[01:47:07.428 --> 01:47:19.285]  There's got to be a way of establishing a credible investigative body to sort through this because otherwise, and this is where I think I do take exception with the Obama administration talking about trying to go after radical groups.
[01:47:19.285 --> 01:47:22.470]  You know, frankly, I think by the fact you won't address
[01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:23.871]  Let's stop there.
[01:47:23.871 --> 01:47:26.875]  Let's stop there because we're running out of time.
[01:47:26.875 --> 01:47:29.038]  And this is so important.
[01:47:29.038 --> 01:47:32.722]  For people that don't know your case, maybe crystallize that in a...
[01:47:40.552 --> 01:48:01.687]  I mean, how you were stopped from doing your job and stopping 9-11, and then at every point the doors were opened, the embassies gave them their visas, and were told this is part of national security, they work for us, you have ATTA and others popping up at US military bases, I mean, this stinks to high heaven, but pulling back from that,
[01:48:03.288 --> 01:48:22.054]  We have this overall demonization of anybody who calls for a new investigation and you have Deborah Medina getting in trouble for it, a gubernatorial candidate, you have all these talk show hosts saying you're the devil if you question anything in or around 9-11 when we have six of the ten 9-11 commissioners coming out and saying we need a new investigation.
[01:48:22.054 --> 01:48:22.314]  Go ahead.
[01:48:22.995 --> 01:48:27.098]  Well, I'm with you on that, and I think that's right there should be the beginning and end of it.
[01:48:27.098 --> 01:48:38.304]  If the 9-11 Commission themselves, and I heard this on the news today talking about something, you know, there's apparently a belief now by the 9-11 Commissioners that the report is speculative at best.
[01:48:38.304 --> 01:48:43.067]  So if you're putting out speculation as policy, then there's something dreadfully wrong.
[01:48:43.067 --> 01:48:44.929]  I mean, come on, Alex, that's what is wrong.
[01:48:44.929 --> 01:48:47.290]  So I think that should be the beginning and end of it right there.
[01:48:47.290 --> 01:48:52.073]  That should be the place where everything starts and ends regarding the justification for a new investigation.
[01:48:52.214 --> 01:48:54.370]  So it's not wrong to call for an investigation.
[01:48:54.975 --> 01:49:02.078]  Not at all, and especially since the investigators themselves, the commissioners have said that, you know, we didn't go as far as we probably could or should have.
[01:49:02.078 --> 01:49:11.881]  Now, with that said, I think, you know, if you want to talk about Able Danger, there's a book out, and it's one of those things I rail at when people say, well, you know, the IG report doesn't say anything about Able Danger.
[01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:18.824]  The IG report talks about the fact that a car name was found in a database, but people don't bother to read the report.
[01:49:18.824 --> 01:49:22.425]  They read the summary and say there's no evidence, but they don't bother to read the body where they say, well,
[01:49:22.865 --> 01:49:24.506]  Yeah, we actually did find a top name.
[01:49:24.506 --> 01:49:25.726]  It was an Army database.
[01:49:25.726 --> 01:49:29.847]  So how is that when people say, well, you know, the Able Danger Report refuted what Schaefer said?
[01:49:29.847 --> 01:49:31.588]  No, it did the opposite.
[01:49:31.588 --> 01:49:33.209]  It's just people never covered it.
[01:49:33.209 --> 01:49:35.629]  And I cite for you, Alex, something that everybody can pick up.
[01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:37.850]  They can go to Amazon, pick it up right now.
[01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:40.071]  And I don't have any investment.
[01:49:40.071 --> 01:49:41.572]  I don't know the guy who wrote it.
[01:49:41.572 --> 01:49:43.852]  Doug Stanton wrote a book called Horse Soldiers.
[01:49:43.852 --> 01:49:47.634]  And on page 24 of that book, and your listeners can go look at it right now.
[01:49:47.634 --> 01:49:48.374]  Go on Amazon.
[01:49:49.174 --> 01:49:59.119]  There's a page about Jeffrey Lambert, Major General Jeffrey Lambert, who by the way was the operations officer at SOCOM when I was involved with AbleDanger.
[01:49:59.119 --> 01:50:08.564]  Major General Lambert admits on the day of 9-11, his thinking was, oh my god, I know who did this, it was Al-Qaeda, and I know the guy who did it.
[01:50:08.564 --> 01:50:11.485]  I know it, Tom, because I was briefed on him a year before.
[01:50:11.485 --> 01:50:12.626]  And that's in the book!
[01:50:12.626 --> 01:50:14.487]  So, you know, you gotta ask yourself,
[01:50:15.007 --> 01:50:24.576]  How is it that DOD IG failed to interview Major General Jeffrey Lambert, and now here he is years later, the book came out, I guess, January of last year.
[01:50:24.576 --> 01:50:27.098]  How is it now he's admitting this?
[01:50:27.098 --> 01:50:30.281]  Did he not get the memo to keep his mouth shut?
[01:50:30.281 --> 01:50:32.923]  Did he just not get contacted by the IG?
[01:50:32.923 --> 01:50:38.648]  So with that fact alone, Alex, I think that justifies a new investigation of able danger.
[01:50:38.648 --> 01:50:39.769]  Would you not agree with me on that?
[01:50:41.032 --> 01:50:41.873]  Absolutely.
[01:50:41.873 --> 01:50:46.316]  Okay, so you've got a major figure in Able Danger now admitting, yeah, we knew about it, Tom.
[01:50:46.316 --> 01:50:49.498]  It was part of a special project doing data mining.
[01:50:49.498 --> 01:50:58.085]  So, to me, this is patently obvious that someone either missed a clue, or in my judgment, they purposely avoided getting the clue.
[01:50:58.085 --> 01:51:03.309]  I mean, you're not going to hunt for zebras in the Antarctic, and that's what they were doing on the Able Danger investigation.
[01:51:03.309 --> 01:51:06.651]  Anywhere we told them to look, they'd look somewhere else or change the questioning.
[01:51:06.651 --> 01:51:08.633]  So, if they did that with my issue, Alex,
[01:51:09.073 --> 01:51:10.694]  What have they done in other areas?
[01:51:10.694 --> 01:51:12.716]  You gotta ask that question.
[01:51:12.716 --> 01:51:20.482]  Well, I mean, at a certain point, it's clear that this is not just screw-ups, and you've chalked some of it up to turf battles.
[01:51:20.482 --> 01:51:25.386]  The CIA wanted its own private merc armies, Blackwater and others.
[01:51:25.386 --> 01:51:27.508]  They didn't want the army shining.
[01:51:27.508 --> 01:51:30.850]  They wanted to move to this more mercenary model, but it's more than that.
[01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:33.112]  I mean, they got their police state, they got their new wars.
[01:51:34.153 --> 01:51:36.234]  They got their naked body scanners.
[01:51:36.234 --> 01:51:39.996]  They got their Patriot Act, which they now use against the general public.
[01:51:39.996 --> 01:51:46.280]  They've now got bills introduced, dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents, U.S.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:46.881]  citizens.
[01:51:46.881 --> 01:51:48.742]  I have the bill here.
[01:51:48.742 --> 01:51:54.025]  It says, for any intelligence gathering or such other matters as the president considers appropriate,
[01:51:54.685 --> 01:52:09.970]  I mean, they're killing America on the altar of the Al-Qaeda boogeyman when this thing grew out of what the CIA set up in 1979 to the 1980s in the Mujahideen, and it's just every door open to the terrorists, every door they're protected.
[01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:14.751]  I mean, bottom line here, this looks like a staged event to me.
[01:52:14.751 --> 01:52:17.852]  Then we can debate, well, how much of it's staged, or to what extent.
[01:52:18.564 --> 01:52:26.469]  Well, I think, Alex, your listeners need to take a hard look at what's going on, and they need to put off the pressure of the representatives, because this is the one question I would ask them to think about.
[01:52:26.469 --> 01:52:28.970]  If we've... And as you said, these things are not new.
[01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:30.871]  These have been in the process of being implemented.
[01:52:30.871 --> 01:52:32.032]  People have had time to get used to them.
[01:52:32.032 --> 01:52:35.434]  The law enforcement intelligence community has these tools available to them.
[01:52:35.434 --> 01:52:39.897]  How is it, then, that the underwear bomber got so close to blotching, as a matter of fact, had he not
[01:52:40.586 --> 01:52:43.690]  Technically failed to ignite the weapon.
[01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.212]  It would have been a touchdown.
[01:52:45.212 --> 01:52:50.358]  So you gotta ask yourself, with all these new laws, how is it we had a near miss?
[01:52:50.358 --> 01:52:50.919]  How is it?
[01:52:50.919 --> 01:52:51.980]  I mean, think about it.
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:54.563]  The intelligence community has got everything it can.
[01:52:54.563 --> 01:53:00.130]  And for example, Mr. Brennan, the special advisor to the president regarding terrorism.
[01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:01.191]  We're good to go.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:24.083]  What are we doing as a government with these enhanced laws, with these enhanced abilities of the intelligence community?
[01:53:24.083 --> 01:53:29.004]  Because to me, if you're having your misses after all these enhancements, something's wrong.
[01:53:29.004 --> 01:53:38.468]  And you gotta, again, if you've been given everything you want and you still aren't producing, that means, like you pointed out, somewhere we missed something in the early investigations.
[01:53:38.468 --> 01:53:43.770]  I argue the 9-11 Commission not only got it wrong, they didn't get to the nub of what was really wrong at all.
[01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:48.831]  And this is where I think all, you know, we've got to go back to that fundamental beginning.
[01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:55.013]  The 9-11 attacks, to look at that, and then make an assessment of what actually went wrong because they never placed blame.
[01:53:55.013 --> 01:53:58.053]  And I think, Alex, they need to go back and place blame.
[01:53:58.053 --> 01:54:06.175]  And frankly, I do some of that blame because I didn't scream as much as I should have regarding the fact we identified these guys and we're trying to get the FBI the information.
[01:54:06.175 --> 01:54:13.097]  And I testify to that fact that I feel horrible about the fact that I was not, you know, out of all the things I've made, you know, decisions about in my life, that
[01:54:13.537 --> 01:54:13.918]  I don't
[01:54:32.213 --> 01:54:35.977]  And the agents that blocked them got record cash bonuses.
[01:54:35.977 --> 01:54:37.759]  Here's DetroitNews.com.
[01:54:37.759 --> 01:54:41.444]  Terror suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation.
[01:54:41.444 --> 01:54:43.286]  So we know they were tracking him.
[01:54:43.286 --> 01:54:45.208]  We know his father warned them.
[01:54:45.208 --> 01:54:46.830]  We know all this was going on.
[01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:58.154]  I mean, this is just absolutely staged out in the open, and we know that this threat of terror is being used to clamp down on the American people.
[01:54:58.154 --> 01:55:01.935]  And so you are calling for a new 9-11 investigation here, and that's good.
[01:55:01.935 --> 01:55:03.795]  I mean, who would investigate it?
[01:55:03.795 --> 01:55:11.898]  Because it's the same corrupt politicians every time that have an incentive to want to cover up what the system's done in the past.
[01:55:11.898 --> 01:55:12.978]  I mean, who investigates it?
[01:55:12.978 --> 01:55:13.979]  State grand juries?
[01:55:13.979 --> 01:55:14.139]  Who?
[01:55:14.921 --> 01:55:18.645]  Well, I think you've got to find someone getting out of the politics and doing it.
[01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:28.754]  Now, frankly, the 9-11 Commission was made up of people who all had background and agendas almost contrary to the good interest of the country trying to get to the bottom.
[01:55:28.754 --> 01:55:31.197]  So, you've got to find people who have two things.
[01:55:31.197 --> 01:55:34.059]  First off, the skill set to understand what they're looking at.
[01:55:34.059 --> 01:55:38.523]  I argue half the 9-11 staff did not understand the importance of certain things that were brought to them.
[01:55:38.523 --> 01:55:39.925]  And I would cite Able Danger as one.
[01:55:40.385 --> 01:55:43.867]  Secondly, you gotta have people who do not have political agendas.
[01:55:43.867 --> 01:55:47.130]  And frankly, it's hard to find but not impossible.
[01:55:47.130 --> 01:55:55.775]  This is where one of those things, if there is a will to have someone allow a selection process to go through, a vetting process to go through, you could find the right people.
[01:55:55.775 --> 01:55:59.398]  I mean, you could find people who would do a credible job of telling the truth.
[01:55:59.398 --> 01:56:02.900]  But that process itself would be painful.
[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:06.162]  It'd probably take about, you know, probably a year to get the right people selected.
[01:56:06.162 --> 01:56:07.984]  But simply because it's tough to do,
[01:56:10.145 --> 01:56:11.847]  There's no reason to not do it.
[01:56:11.847 --> 01:56:16.071]  So we need the people to continue investigating and lawsuits and other things.
[01:56:16.071 --> 01:56:23.479]  In closing, Colonel Schaffer, we appreciate your time here and your courage to come on and talk about these issues.
[01:56:23.479 --> 01:56:26.782]  They're vetting your book right now in national security.
[01:56:26.782 --> 01:56:28.964]  It's coming out, I guess, in the next few months, hopefully.
[01:56:28.964 --> 01:56:31.066]  The date is 31 August.
[01:56:31.066 --> 01:56:32.488]  We get the published date is 31 August.
[01:56:33.112 --> 01:56:35.876]  Okay, so coming up in August, we'll have you back then.
[01:56:35.876 --> 01:56:37.598]  We appreciate your time.
[01:56:37.598 --> 01:56:42.104]  How much are they going to allow you to put in there that the public hasn't known so far?
[01:56:42.104 --> 01:56:46.370]  Can you give us any tidbits of stuff that's been vetted and that you're allowed to release?
[01:56:46.943 --> 01:56:57.286]  Well, I guess the one thing I can talk about in good detail is the fact that there's an entire chapter devoted to my initial conversations with Philip Zelikow at Bagram.
[01:56:57.286 --> 01:57:05.869]  This is not something I was able to go into for any number of reasons when I testified, and I pretty much go through the entire, you know, verbatim, what happened.
[01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:08.991]  Uh, and so, you know, it is from my recollection.
[01:57:08.991 --> 01:57:09.711]  You have to remember that.
[01:57:09.711 --> 01:57:13.033]  Uh, and I go through and provide the detail.
[01:57:13.033 --> 01:57:17.095]  The other thing I think is going to be notable about the book is it was, you know, it wasn't just me talking.
[01:57:17.095 --> 01:57:21.338]  We had collaboration and support from other members who were deployed with me.
[01:57:21.338 --> 01:57:29.863]  So when you read the book, you'll have to understand it's been bettered not only by, you know, a security review, but the folks who are actually there with me have participated in helping write the book.
[01:57:31.275 --> 01:57:38.051]  And we're going to get a bird's eye view into how you were specifically blocked from taking out Al Qaeda before the attacks.
[01:57:38.815 --> 01:57:40.896]  Don't forget, this is only the introduction of Abel Danger.
[01:57:40.896 --> 01:57:49.778]  It's not going to be a teaser, but this covers my deployment to Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004 and where the disclosure made it.
[01:57:49.778 --> 01:58:01.700]  Basically, the thing that came after in 2005 and 2006 is an entirely different story, but this actually talks about in great detail my protected disclosure to Phil Zelikow and what happened to me when they tried to shut me up.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.001]  And it covers Stratis Ivey, correct?
[01:58:04.779 --> 01:58:06.360]  It touches upon that a little bit.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:09.782]  As a matter of fact, Stratos Ivy is brought up in greater detail.
[01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:10.823]  As a matter of fact, it's one of the new things.
[01:58:10.823 --> 01:58:15.566]  There's a little bit more detail on Stratos Ivy that looks like they'll be able to read about in the book.
[01:58:15.566 --> 01:58:21.810]  But bottom line, Colonel Schaefer, the establishment gets more power out of these terror attacks, and I find that very suspicious.
[01:58:23.177 --> 01:58:32.239]  I find it, the fact that we've given the intelligence community a lot more authority, a lot more money, a lot more resources, and we're still having problems, to be something terribly wrong.
[01:58:32.239 --> 01:58:37.760]  And again, your listeners should really question, where is the money going and what are we spending it for?
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.380]  Because they're getting a lot of money.
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.721]  Colonel Schaefer, thank you.
[01:58:42.721 --> 01:58:45.321]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:21.992 --> 02:00:38.262]  Birgitta Jones-Dottier is going to be joining us coming up in the final hour.
[02:00:38.262 --> 02:00:41.885]  Big victory against the banks trying to plunder.
[02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:56.303]  And continue their plundering of Iceland, sending shockwaves around the world in a national referendum over the weekend saying no to the bankers taking over and running their society.
[02:00:56.303 --> 02:01:04.668]  Coming up in the next 50 minutes of the broadcast, a lamp in the dark by the documentary filmmaker
[02:01:05.762 --> 02:01:18.208]  Who made Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., and of course, the first in the series, America's Secret Beginnings, The New Atlantis.

[02:01:25.231 --> 02:01:32.354]  We'll be playing some clips of this off the DVD in the background when he joins us today.
[02:01:36.556 --> 02:01:43.666]  I may let him go about 40 minutes into the interview though because I've got news here I've absolutely got to hit on.
[02:01:43.666 --> 02:01:51.055]  There is just so much going on that we need to cover that we haven't even gotten into yet today.
[02:01:52.682 --> 02:02:03.967]  In my stacks of news, the legislative front, the open borders, the amnesty, the gun grabbing, the naked body scanners, the police state, secret arrest and torture of citizens being prepared.
[02:02:03.967 --> 02:02:07.888]  I mean, it is just an all-out power grab going on.
[02:02:07.888 --> 02:02:16.372]  Before I go any further and go to our guest, I want to thank some of our sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[02:02:16.372 --> 02:02:17.913]  Supernatural Silver.

[02:02:49.730 --> 02:02:54.154]  The big issue here, and I know you as listeners know this, but our mission is to get this out to the general public.
[02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:27.843]  That there is a world government, there's no longer any denial, it is run by the banks like all the old timers warned us it was, it's been in control for a long time, now it's out in the open because it's really starting to clamp down on every facet of our lives.
[02:03:27.843 --> 02:03:36.851]  Like this article I have here in my stack, I'm looking for it, I meant to get to it, I mentioned it earlier, from
[02:03:39.685 --> 02:03:45.049]  Of all places, this is from ESPN.
[02:03:45.049 --> 02:04:02.624]  And we actually covered this months ago, but now it's getting attention because it's on ESPN, and that's good news, that under the Law of the Sea Treaty and separate environmental rules they're trying to pass, because Obama can't get that ratified, they're talking about seizing all inland waterways, lakes, ponds, streams, standing water,
[02:04:05.868 --> 02:04:13.434]  It's worse than the Wetlands Act we saw 15 years ago that failed, where if you had rainwater, the feds could come in and not let you use your land or build on it.
[02:04:13.434 --> 02:04:16.897]  This is even below water.
[02:04:16.897 --> 02:04:20.360]  They have this new fake Clean Water Act they're trying to ram through.
[02:04:25.686 --> 02:04:26.767]  It's so diabolical.
[02:04:26.767 --> 02:04:36.816]  They want control of every facet of your life, and so they tell you, oh, we're taking your land, we're taking your property, we're raising taxes on you to save the earth, and you're going to pay your taxes to these private banks.
[02:04:36.816 --> 02:04:38.558]  It's totally transparent.
[02:04:38.558 --> 02:04:43.682]  Open world dictatorship being set up by private banks in everyone's face.
[02:04:43.682 --> 02:04:44.763]  And guys, I can't find it.
[02:04:44.763 --> 02:04:45.644]  Will you reprint me?
[02:04:46.705 --> 02:04:47.726]  It's up on Drudge too.
[02:04:47.726 --> 02:04:50.307]  I know it's on Infowars and Prison Planet.
[02:04:50.307 --> 02:04:54.109]  The ESPN article about phishing.
[02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:55.990]  Phishing to be banned.
[02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:57.991]  They can't go angling now if they have their way.
[02:04:57.991 --> 02:04:58.951]  I mean, total control.
[02:04:58.951 --> 02:05:00.032]  Talk about a dictatorship.
[02:05:00.643 --> 02:05:05.206]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.206 --> 02:05:06.106]  Number one.
[02:05:06.106 --> 02:05:09.529]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.529 --> 02:05:10.389]  Number two.
[02:05:10.389 --> 02:05:15.292]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.292 --> 02:05:16.033]  It's true.
[02:05:16.033 --> 02:05:20.896]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.896 --> 02:05:21.356]  Number three.
[02:05:21.716 --> 02:05:25.299]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.299 --> 02:05:30.022]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:32.784]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.784 --> 02:05:37.247]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:37.247 --> 02:05:41.390]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:46.154]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.434 --> 02:05:50.616]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.616 --> 02:05:52.397]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:05.823 --> 02:07:08.605]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:07:08.605 --> 02:07:13.929]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:07:13.929 --> 02:07:18.412]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:08:10.658 --> 02:08:12.238]  You want answers?

[02:08:22.881 --> 02:08:25.522]  Eight minutes into hour number three.
[02:08:25.522 --> 02:08:32.063]  We'll talk to the leader of the Icelandic Parliament, who's one of the main people leading the charge against the bankers.
[02:08:32.063 --> 02:08:33.504]  Very exciting information.
[02:08:33.504 --> 02:08:34.784]  You want solutions?
[02:08:34.784 --> 02:08:37.925]  They're coming up, going right at the head of the beast, the heart of the system.
[02:08:38.425 --> 02:08:40.466]  Next hour.
[02:08:40.466 --> 02:08:43.667]  In a moment we're going to Chris Pinto, an amazing documentary filmmaker.
[02:08:43.667 --> 02:08:58.251]  We're going to be talking to him and also you guys are welcome to get some of the DVDs of the films that we have at Infowars.com in there and show a few short clips of video behind Chris Pinto for presentplanet.tv viewers to see the quality of these films.
[02:08:58.251 --> 02:08:59.951]  But I mentioned this is the first of the show.
[02:08:59.951 --> 02:09:01.432]  I want to cover it briefly now.
[02:09:02.472 --> 02:09:07.578]  This is an article out of ESPN.com today, called out by Robert Montgomery.
[02:09:07.578 --> 02:09:09.200]  I want to get him on.
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:18.970]  And it says, when the World Wildlife Fund, a bunch of eugenicists, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare completed their successful campaign in Ontario, they were able to ban many types of hunting.
[02:09:19.847 --> 02:09:23.011]  And now they're saying it's mean to fish.
[02:09:23.011 --> 02:09:27.437]  Now there's big trawlers out there in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific that are overfishing.
[02:09:27.437 --> 02:09:28.198]  There are some problems.
[02:09:28.198 --> 02:09:30.261]  This is waterways.
[02:09:30.261 --> 02:09:34.026]  This is lakes, ponds, streams, rivers.
[02:09:34.807 --> 02:09:49.962]  And it goes on to say, now we see NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the administration planning the future of recreational fishing access to America based on a similar agenda of these same groups and other big green anti-use organizations.
[02:09:49.962 --> 02:09:54.486]  They can train you what type of light bulb you can have, what type of toilet, what type of car, they can do anything.
[02:09:54.486 --> 02:09:58.230]  Home inspections through an executive order by President Obama.
[02:09:59.315 --> 02:10:00.016]  The current U.S.
[02:10:00.016 --> 02:10:03.298]  direction of fishing is direct parallel to what happened in Canada with hunting.
[02:10:03.298 --> 02:10:08.621]  The negative economic impacts on hard-working American families and small businesses are being ignored.
[02:10:08.621 --> 02:10:20.790]  And it goes into the announcements of this unelected panel, run by World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife, Pew Environment Group, and others, produced a document entitled, Transition Green.
[02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:24.192]  And it breaks down what they're going to be doing.
[02:10:24.192 --> 02:10:26.294]  It says, our lakes,
[02:10:27.689 --> 02:10:33.153]  Everything and clearly most US lakes are full of fish and it can always be restocked.
[02:10:33.153 --> 02:10:37.497]  But this is about total control, federal licensing to be able to fish.
[02:10:37.497 --> 02:10:42.380]  This is about domesticating us and getting full control over our lives.
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:44.102]  Okay, shifting gears now.
[02:10:46.357 --> 02:10:51.443]  I only carry the best documentary films and books in our online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:51.443 --> 02:10:52.984]  If you don't have a computer, that's fine.
[02:10:52.984 --> 02:10:56.068]  Everybody can call the toll-free number, 888-253-3139, or write to us at P.O.
[02:10:56.068 --> 02:10:56.929]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:10:56.929 --> 02:10:57.409]  Again, P.O.
[02:10:57.409 --> 02:10:58.130]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:11:08.493 --> 02:11:14.017]  But these are among some of the best documentary films with documents, interviews.
[02:11:14.017 --> 02:11:16.699]  They also hire professional actors.
[02:11:16.699 --> 02:11:23.604]  And again, we're going to show you some clips of that from each of the films in the background while Chris Pinto is talking.
[02:11:23.604 --> 02:11:28.207]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis.
[02:11:28.207 --> 02:11:32.770]  Who these people are, how they tick, their own documents, who the Illuminists are.
[02:11:32.770 --> 02:11:36.352]  Then Part 2, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[02:11:37.273 --> 02:11:40.235]  Part two of Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings.
[02:11:40.235 --> 02:11:44.297]  Part three, Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill, all the occultism.
[02:11:44.297 --> 02:11:50.240]  In fact, we'll get a document cam shot of this and we'll show the viewers of what's on the cover here.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:57.945]  And then now, it's intriguing because he goes into a whole separate area, but it ties into all this.
[02:11:57.945 --> 02:12:03.508]  And I just finished reading a thick encyclopedic level book, A Dark History of the Vatican.
[02:12:04.710 --> 02:12:04.810]  Yes.
[02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:22.252]  Again, I'm not a Catholic, but I'm not here bashing Catholics.
[02:12:22.252 --> 02:12:27.975]  We've got Pat Robertson saying forced abortion in China is good and socialism is of God and of Obama.
[02:12:27.975 --> 02:12:30.117]  We have the clergy response teams today.
[02:12:30.117 --> 02:12:37.661]  Tens of thousands of preachers recruited to tell their flocks, Romans 13, submit to government, turn your guns in, take shots, go to FEMA camps when you're told.
[02:12:37.661 --> 02:12:42.805]  We broke that four years ago here on Genesis with Pastor Butch Paul with the secret documents and now it's mainstream news.
[02:12:43.485 --> 02:12:50.229]  But we're going to get into this today because A Lamp in the Dark is stunning information.
[02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:59.835]  So we now go to writer-director Christian J. Pinto, who produced the award-winning documentaries that we just mentioned, and he joins us today.
[02:12:59.835 --> 02:13:01.376]  Chris, thanks for coming on.
[02:13:01.376 --> 02:13:03.678]  Hey Alex, it's good to talk to you again.
[02:13:03.678 --> 02:13:05.739]  So much is happening.
[02:13:05.739 --> 02:13:08.881]  Again, I'm intrigued because I know it all ties together, but how does this film
[02:13:12.498 --> 02:13:16.900]  Well, I think they dovetail because the whole concept of a New World Order is really Rome's original concept.
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:18.920]  You can trace it back to 1494 when Pope Alexander
[02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:52.659]  Uh, the Sixth drew a line, literally drew a line down the center of the world map, gave half the world to Spain and the other half to Portugal, and told them to go out and conquer everything.
[02:13:52.659 --> 02:14:03.529]  Um, the claims of the papacy for more than a thousand years have been that the Pope holds the place of Christ and God upon the Earth.
[02:14:04.036 --> 02:14:12.481]  And so he has the power over the world, over all kings and princes and rulers and governors and so on.
[02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:17.644]  They're all supposed to submit to his authority, whether they know about him or not.
[02:14:17.644 --> 02:14:27.029]  Some people might remember the film years ago with Richard Chamberlain, Shogun, the big, long six-hour series that was based on a book by James Clavell.
[02:14:27.029 --> 02:14:31.532]  Well, at one point, you know, the storyline basically is this English sailor
[02:14:32.079 --> 02:14:37.821]  Who's stranded on the Isle of Japan, and he learns the ways of their culture and so on.
[02:14:37.821 --> 02:14:42.563]  And there's all of these Jesuit priests that are there in Japan.
[02:14:42.563 --> 02:14:49.326]  And they're working, of course, to try and take over the Shoguns and their empire and so on there in Japan.
[02:14:49.326 --> 02:14:51.607]  But the Shoguns don't realize this.
[02:14:51.607 --> 02:14:56.689]  And Richard Chamberlain, at one point, is trying to warn them about what these guys are doing.
[02:14:56.689 --> 02:15:01.751]  And he informs them at some point that the Pope had given their land
[02:15:02.892 --> 02:15:05.354]  Over to the Portuguese.
[02:15:05.354 --> 02:15:08.095]  And they're looking at him and saying, well, this is not possible.
[02:15:08.095 --> 02:15:09.516]  How is this possible?
[02:15:09.516 --> 02:15:15.039]  Of course, they had no idea that the papacy and the Vatican had made these claims for centuries.
[02:15:15.039 --> 02:15:16.780]  And they had the Portuguese runners.
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:23.384]  That was the big secret was that the Vatican had the good maps of the seaways that nobody else had globally.
[02:15:23.384 --> 02:15:23.865]  Right.
[02:15:23.865 --> 02:15:27.607]  And from what I understand, the Jesuits actually counterfeited some of the maps.
[02:15:28.394 --> 02:15:36.036]  And showed them to the showguns to deceive them about the land masses and the waterways and all that kind of stuff.
[02:15:36.036 --> 02:15:38.037]  Well, let's fast forward for a moment.
[02:15:38.037 --> 02:15:51.741]  In my research for Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, we discovered that the Bilderberg Group, with some key people from the Vatican, actually in the early 50s, and this has now been declassified,
[02:15:52.541 --> 02:15:55.402]  Yeah, the EU is said to be a total... It is said to be a total Vatican project by...
[02:16:22.697 --> 02:16:35.472]  Oh, in the book, The Power and the Principality of Europe, that was set forth by an English Conservative Party member, Anthony... Oh, I can't remember his last name.
[02:16:35.472 --> 02:16:37.635]  Why did the Vatican then go after the Templars?
[02:16:39.366 --> 02:16:49.750]  That's an interesting, that is really said to be the Templars, the suffering of the Templars was said to be more through the King of France, at least from what I've studied of it.
[02:16:49.750 --> 02:17:08.097]  And the Templars were bringing in, this is in the 1200s now, they had been over in the Middle East, they were in Jerusalem, they're dealing with these different groups, like the Yitzhaki, they're dealing with the Muslims and the Jews and so on, and they were creating a kind of amalgamated religious system.
[02:17:08.635 --> 02:17:11.898]  Where they were blending in all of these different world religions.
[02:17:11.898 --> 02:17:12.639]  And that's the key.
[02:17:12.639 --> 02:17:24.791]  That's kind of part of, you know, a lot of the research that I do is showing how the New World Order, the way that they're trying to unite the nations is by breaking down all the boundaries that separate men.
[02:17:25.256 --> 02:17:29.139]  World politics is one of them, but world religion is another.
[02:17:29.139 --> 02:17:43.088]  And we see the UN pushing this, Maureen Strong pushing it, but separately we see the last couple Popes getting up and having these big conclaves of all the religious leaders there in Vatican City praying together.
[02:17:43.088 --> 02:17:44.649]  Right, as they did back in 1986 and again.
[02:17:46.686 --> 02:17:47.767]  After the year 2000.
[02:17:47.767 --> 02:17:58.412]  And then the United Nations, of course, having their big Millennium Summit, where they get all the different leaders of the world religions, you know, who claim that they're all praying to the same God.
[02:17:58.412 --> 02:18:09.837]  But that's all part of this move to create a one-world religion, or a world religious belief system, that will go hand-in-glove with a world political system.
[02:18:10.063 --> 02:18:18.025]  But from the beginning, Rome was using Christianity as a political tool once Christians were able to become dominant.
[02:18:18.025 --> 02:18:19.706]  So I'm going to try to shut up now.
[02:18:19.706 --> 02:18:26.028]  We're about to go to break, but let's go through the chronological order of what the film covers, because it's key information.
[02:18:26.926 --> 02:18:36.208]  Well, we try to cover... we do this through the history of the Bible, starting in the first century, showing how the Gospels were set forth, and then how there are a lot of warnings.
[02:18:36.208 --> 02:18:52.491]  I mean, of course, I'm a Christian, so, you know, I believe the teachings of the Bible, and we show how Jesus and all of the apostles had warned of grievous wolves that would enter into the church, and that would misuse the Christian faith for their own selfish designs.
[02:18:53.238 --> 02:19:05.852]  Uh, and so those warnings begin, and then we move up forward, uh, into the early centuries, and, uh, ultimately the conflict, really, in Rome between Christianity and Paganism.
[02:19:05.852 --> 02:19:10.958]  And that conflict came to, or what seemed like it came to an end, with Constantine the Great in 313 AD.
[02:19:12.794 --> 02:19:15.915]  And Constantine was the, you know, the famous general.
[02:19:15.915 --> 02:19:17.316]  Rome was a tetrarchy.
[02:19:17.316 --> 02:19:19.817]  It was governed by four emperors.
[02:19:19.817 --> 02:19:30.821]  And then Constantine sees this vision where he sees supposedly a cross emblazoned on the sun, and he hears a voice tell him, in this sign, conquer.
[02:19:30.821 --> 02:19:34.102]  And so he then adopts the sign of the cross.
[02:19:34.102 --> 02:19:36.643]  He believes the vision is from Christos, or Christ.
[02:19:37.788 --> 02:19:45.354]  And he uses this symbol, goes into battle, defeats his enemies, and Rome becomes a single system under a single emperor.
[02:19:45.354 --> 02:19:46.275]  All right, stay there.
[02:19:46.275 --> 02:19:47.416]  We're coming back.
[02:19:47.416 --> 02:19:51.199]  We're going to roll through this history with Chris Pinto.
[02:19:51.199 --> 02:19:59.907]  The new film, the fourth in the series, A Lamp in the Dark, The Untold History of the Bible, available on DVD at m4wars.com.
[02:20:01.738 --> 02:20:03.058]  Who is Sam Andy?
[02:20:03.058 --> 02:20:05.579]  Sam Andy Foods is life insurance in a can.

[02:20:48.277 --> 02:20:50.459]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:50.459 --> 02:20:52.841]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:52.841 --> 02:20:57.845]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:20:57.845 --> 02:20:59.386]  I have tremendous influence.
[02:21:17.156 --> 02:21:20.239]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:20.239 --> 02:21:21.580]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:22.580]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:25.022]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:25.022 --> 02:21:25.843]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:25.843 --> 02:21:26.844]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:50.063]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:50.063 --> 02:21:59.174]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:22:01.781 --> 02:22:12.171]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:12.171 --> 02:22:18.617]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:18.617 --> 02:22:27.465]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:27.845 --> 02:22:37.029]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:37.029 --> 02:22:41.890]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:41.890 --> 02:22:43.431]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:43.431 --> 02:22:45.932]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[02:23:01.929 --> 02:23:10.634]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:23:10.634 --> 02:23:16.638]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.

[02:23:27.126 --> 02:23:29.568]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:24:03.274 --> 02:24:05.615]  Okay, let's go right back to Chris Pinto.
[02:24:05.615 --> 02:24:10.358]  So you were getting into Constantine right before the fall of the Roman Empire 100 years later.
[02:24:10.358 --> 02:24:10.778]  Continue.
[02:24:12.028 --> 02:24:19.729]  Constantine was the first to legalize Christianity there in Rome, with the Edict of Milan in 313 A.D.
[02:24:19.729 --> 02:24:31.532]  So he legalizes Christianity, and then Christianity is over time merged with the pagan ideas or the pagan belief system of Rome.
[02:24:31.532 --> 02:24:38.693]  And Constantine, it's said, if you read different historians, that he confused Christos with the god Mithras.
[02:24:39.338 --> 02:24:41.839]  Okay, the sun god of the ancient world.
[02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:50.263]  And there are some, like when you see these big statues of Constantine, there's a very famous head and his arm and leg and this kind of thing.
[02:24:50.263 --> 02:24:58.487]  These were gigantic statues that he had set up around his empire with him dressed up like Saul Invictus, the sun god.
[02:24:58.487 --> 02:25:01.969]  Okay, and he believed he was the manifestation of Saul Invictus.
[02:25:01.969 --> 02:25:07.732]  Well, it's said that Constantine took to himself as Caesar, he became the sole emperor of Rome,
[02:25:08.399 --> 02:25:11.220]  He had the title Pontifex Maximus.
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:13.680]  That's the title for the Caesar.
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:18.082]  That meant he was the head of the Pontifical College, the head of the pagan priesthood.
[02:25:18.082 --> 02:25:31.405]  So he adopted another title as the head of the Christian Church, and he called himself Vicarius Christi, meaning another Christ or the substitute for Christ, one who stands in the place of Christ.
[02:25:31.405 --> 02:25:35.546]  And so he would govern the pagans and he would govern the Christians with these two titles.
[02:25:36.597 --> 02:25:41.300]  And then in time, of course, he leaves Rome because of all the politics involved.
[02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:47.603]  He goes and he founds Constantinople, and then Rome falls to the barbarian tribes and this kind of thing.
[02:25:47.603 --> 02:26:01.851]  And in the aftermath, the popes arise as the bishops of Rome, and they claim these two titles of Constantine, the vicar of Christ, Vicarius Christi, and Pontifex Maximus, which they hold to this day.
[02:26:01.851 --> 02:26:03.472]  That's why the pope is called the Pontiff.
[02:26:05.245 --> 02:26:27.994]  But anyway, so then from there, this system now, you know, because Constantine had set forth the edict against heretics, and so now heretics, before, if you read the New Testament, if somebody's guilty of heresy, you know, they would ask them to depart from the Church, or, as in the case of, you know, when the Apostle Paul was at the school of Tyrannus,
[02:26:28.502 --> 02:26:31.944]  He just separates the disciples from the unbelievers.
[02:26:31.944 --> 02:26:35.386]  You know, they would separate themselves from people who disagreed.
[02:26:35.386 --> 02:26:51.535]  But now Constantine, you know, the state steps in, and Constantine is passing laws that people who disagree on certain doctrinal issues have to be hunted down, arrested, in some cases killed, and so on, for heresy.
[02:26:51.535 --> 02:26:57.318]  And if you can, to this day, go online and read Constantine's different writings against the heretics,
[02:26:57.990 --> 02:27:00.172]  And, uh, you know, he's very aggressive.
[02:27:00.172 --> 02:27:03.554]  You know, you can see the violence in his words.
[02:27:03.554 --> 02:27:09.538]  Uh, and there are some who believe that that was really the beginning of what would become the Dark Ages.
[02:27:09.538 --> 02:27:18.805]  Uh, when the, uh, the Roman Church now would begin to persecute everyone who disagreed with the official, uh, state doctrine and so on.
[02:27:18.805 --> 02:27:25.790]  Um, and so we, we take it up, but what we show is that with the formation of the Roman Catholic system,
[02:27:26.345 --> 02:27:32.467]  There were still believers, Bible believers, who were never a part of the Roman system.
[02:27:32.467 --> 02:27:49.992]  And from the histories that we have, many of these groups fled into the north of Italy and the south of France, and they became known as the Apollokans, they were known as the Donatists in some cases, the Waldenses, the Albigenses, they've been given different names.
[02:27:51.522 --> 02:27:56.143]  But probably the Waldenses and the Albigenses are the two most famous.
[02:27:56.143 --> 02:28:10.408]  And from reading the history from the beginning, the so-called Christian Roman Emperors, they would particularly persecute other Christian sects that they didn't control and ignore the pagans, but then later they started going after everybody?
[02:28:10.408 --> 02:28:11.008]  Or how did that work?
[02:28:11.857 --> 02:28:15.538]  That's how, just what you said is what seems to have happened.
[02:28:15.538 --> 02:28:17.338]  Mainly, the Inquisitions began.
[02:28:17.338 --> 02:28:30.222]  We kind of fast forward because those, from the 5th century up until about the 10th, 11th century, it's difficult to find the records of what happened, you know, fully and completely, and there's a lot of disagreement.
[02:28:30.222 --> 02:28:34.983]  But the Inquisition begins now with a guy named Dominic Goodsman, who's called St.
[02:28:34.983 --> 02:28:35.383]  Dominic.
[02:28:36.130 --> 02:28:47.000]  Uh, at about 1207 AD, and there were a series of theological debates that were going on between these non-Catholic believers and the Catholic priesthood.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:53.165]  And they had debates, like public debates, in their towns and so on, in the town of Albi in France.
[02:28:53.165 --> 02:28:58.190]  And, uh, and there were sharp disagreements, but the one thing that the
[02:28:59.148 --> 02:29:04.350]  The Albagenses were known for was that they paid strict attention to the Bible.
[02:29:04.350 --> 02:29:06.671]  They just believed what the Bible said.
[02:29:06.671 --> 02:29:15.873]  Whereas the Catholic priesthood would come in with the traditions and the official declarations of the Holy See of Rome and so on and the Popes and whatnot.
[02:29:15.873 --> 02:29:26.657]  And so in the final debate, Dominic, it was said he'd lost the debate, or so it's said, and he became so enraged that he swore slavery and death.
[02:29:27.498 --> 02:29:28.499]  We're on the march.
[02:29:28.499 --> 02:29:30.560]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.567 --> 02:30:00.672]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.672 --> 02:30:05.216]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.216 --> 02:30:06.137]  Number one.
[02:30:06.137 --> 02:30:09.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:10.421]  Number two.
[02:30:10.421 --> 02:30:15.306]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:16.047]  It's true.
[02:30:16.047 --> 02:30:20.611]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:21.732]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.732 --> 02:30:25.315]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.315 --> 02:30:29.239]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.239 --> 02:30:30.039]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.039 --> 02:30:32.802]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.802 --> 02:30:36.485]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.485 --> 02:30:37.266]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.266 --> 02:30:41.410]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.410 --> 02:30:46.174]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:44.765 --> 02:32:49.927]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[02:32:49.927 --> 02:32:50.727]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:50.727 --> 02:32:51.787]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[02:33:10.336 --> 02:33:12.257]  Now I want to be clear.
[02:33:12.257 --> 02:33:16.801]  The globalists use balkanization to play us off against each other.
[02:33:16.801 --> 02:33:23.246]  So I don't get up on my radio show and bash Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Catholics, Protestants.
[02:33:23.246 --> 02:33:28.489]  You know, my family on both sides were Protestant activists that came into Texas.
[02:33:28.489 --> 02:33:31.472]  My mother's side, the heirs family that raised Colonel Travis's son.
[02:33:33.533 --> 02:33:43.560]  They, of course, brought in Bibles in, what, 1825 in a famous case into Galveston.
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:51.086]  And they actually had the Jesuit group ran them out of town and tried to burn their wagons full of Protestant Bibles.
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:58.507]  Uh, and I know that big government, big churches, big state-run religion has always been a tool of oppression.
[02:33:58.507 --> 02:34:06.797]  Separately, I've had groups connected to the Israeli lobby over the years, uh, using bizarre psychology.
[02:34:06.797 --> 02:34:13.044]  You know, if we have a Pat Buchanan on who's Catholic, I must work for the secret Catholic takeover, or, you know, any other guest.
[02:34:13.664 --> 02:34:22.770]  I know a lot of Catholics, they're great, hardworking, good people that are anti-abortion, and I know a lot of conservative Catholics that criticize the Pope's calling for New World Order.
[02:34:22.770 --> 02:34:33.638]  I'm not here to get people fighting with each other, but I have studied quite a bit of history, and we know there was a lot of really bad stuff throughout the Dark Ages and Middle Ages, and through that, that happened.
[02:34:33.638 --> 02:34:39.682]  I know in the Netherlands and other places, once the Protestants got in control, they did a lot of the persecution back to Catholics.
[02:34:39.682 --> 02:34:41.564]  Now, you look at the modern day,
[02:34:42.759 --> 02:34:59.472]  This ecumenical, merging the religions, not just different groups of Christians together, this call for world government, this is happening from the Protestants, it's happening from the Catholics, but the Catholic Church is at the center of the call for a new world order, a global government, in their own documents, with the Euro.
[02:35:00.416 --> 02:35:05.079]  And so, the establishment wants to play people off against each other.
[02:35:05.079 --> 02:35:07.240]  And, you know, I don't have a religious broadcast.
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:09.521]  I have a news and history show.
[02:35:09.521 --> 02:35:13.543]  And I watched Lamp in the Dark before we carried it, when they asked us to carry it.
[02:35:13.543 --> 02:35:17.785]  And I found it to be very accurate for my research, so we carry it.
[02:35:17.785 --> 02:35:23.789]  At the same time, though, I have seen kind of the Christian Zionist arm that's also a luminist.
[02:35:25.330 --> 02:35:25.550]  I don't
[02:35:42.745 --> 02:35:44.006]  Yeah, that's the whole point.
[02:35:44.006 --> 02:35:44.907]  That's becoming the new Inquisition.
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:18.643]  There's that case over in England of the Christian couple who witnessed to a Muslim woman.
[02:36:18.643 --> 02:36:23.264]  And the Muslim woman talked about her faith and the Christians talked about their faith.
[02:36:23.264 --> 02:36:29.367]  But now the Muslim woman felt like she was being oppressed because the Christians were criticizing Islam.
[02:36:29.367 --> 02:36:33.829]  And then they ended up suffering a certain amount of persecution over there in England.
[02:36:33.829 --> 02:36:37.751]  Yeah, they're trying to make it illegal in Canada to read certain Bible verses.
[02:36:39.448 --> 02:36:44.730]  There's all these calls for censorship that are going on, that once you censor one group, you censor everybody.
[02:36:44.730 --> 02:36:51.192]  But getting up into the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, when we start seeing the real persecution.
[02:36:51.192 --> 02:36:52.192]  Right.
[02:36:52.192 --> 02:36:57.774]  It really began over the reading of the Bible and the preaching of what's written in the Bible.
[02:36:57.774 --> 02:36:59.935]  That began the Inquisition.
[02:36:59.935 --> 02:37:01.015]  A lot of people don't know that.
[02:37:01.015 --> 02:37:04.476]  That's one of the reasons why I want to give the history and lamp.
[02:37:04.476 --> 02:37:06.797]  But that's what led to two things.
[02:37:06.797 --> 02:37:07.157]  One, the
[02:37:08.338 --> 02:37:11.120]  Really, it was the establishment of the first police state.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:13.922]  If you read some historian, that's what they'll say.
[02:37:13.922 --> 02:37:21.346]  That the Inquisition, where you developed a system of informants, you developed a police system that was intercontinental.
[02:37:21.346 --> 02:37:23.087]  There were no boundaries for the Inquisition.
[02:37:23.087 --> 02:37:27.610]  They could go to any country in Europe and hold people accountable.
[02:37:27.610 --> 02:37:31.432]  They were kind of like Interpol or the Feds.
[02:37:31.432 --> 02:37:32.613]  They could cross any border.
[02:37:33.408 --> 02:37:40.076]  And that's when they began to outlaw the Bible, and that's why they outlawed the Bible.
[02:37:40.076 --> 02:37:44.362]  The Bible became a forbidden book, as it's called in one of the documentaries.
[02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:53.436]  And then we saw things like when they wanted to build the new Vatican building, indulgences, get your family out of purgatory, pay all this gold.
[02:37:53.436 --> 02:38:04.804]  And similarly, we see the UN and the EU selling, and Al Gore admits it, a global religion of Gaia where they go out and persecute everyone and have a new Inquisition.
[02:38:04.804 --> 02:38:09.487]  I think it's the same spirit, the same principles involved, ultimately.
[02:38:12.338 --> 02:38:31.501]  You know, it's been going on for centuries and centuries and centuries, and as we show it in our film, we show the Bible, really, and the Word of God and those who believe it as the center of controversy and the oppression that came against them to forbid anyone from having another opinion.
[02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:38.752]  And if you follow that history, it brings you up through, you know, the 19th century into modern times.
[02:38:38.752 --> 02:38:45.795]  I believe this has everything to do with why they've kicked the Bible out of our school system, along with prayer and a lot of other things.
[02:38:45.795 --> 02:38:47.836]  Okay, but explain this to me.
[02:38:47.836 --> 02:38:56.140]  Explain to me how the Illuminati starts forming, secret societies, masons, groups that don't like the dominance of the Catholic Church,
[02:38:57.034 --> 02:39:02.978]  But then, we today see the Catholic Church selling the same things that the Illuminati was selling.
[02:39:02.978 --> 02:39:05.620]  So, how does that intertwine?
[02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:07.642]  It's a complicated history.
[02:39:07.642 --> 02:39:09.103]  You have different people.
[02:39:09.103 --> 02:39:14.587]  You have people who believe that the Illuminati was actually formed by the Jesuit order.
[02:39:15.214 --> 02:39:17.775]  Which was when the Reformation got underway.
[02:39:17.775 --> 02:39:26.837]  You have these Bible believers, they're preaching, and then they start, the printing press comes along, and they start, you know, manufacturing Bibles faster than they can be destroyed.
[02:39:26.837 --> 02:39:32.139]  So as a way to control opposition, the Jesuit priest, Adam Weishaupt, sets it up.
[02:39:32.139 --> 02:39:41.101]  Well, you have the Jesuits were founded to destroy the Reformation, to destroy the Reformers, and those who were opposing Rome.
[02:39:41.101 --> 02:39:43.302]  Okay, so they launched a counter-Reformation.
[02:39:44.228 --> 02:39:55.892]  And they started getting into academics and they tried to do it that way, but what was happening was they weren't having success in persuading people to come back to Rome.
[02:39:55.892 --> 02:40:03.594]  And a lot of countries were being converted to, they were becoming Protestant countries, and they were casting off the authority of the Pope.
[02:40:03.594 --> 02:40:06.235]  See, because the Pope was a very political figure.
[02:40:06.235 --> 02:40:06.995]  If the Pope told
[02:40:07.635 --> 02:40:10.996]  Uh, a king or a queen or whoever what to do, they were supposed to do it.
[02:40:10.996 --> 02:40:17.598]  And the Pope was telling people, go and invade that other country and you kill those people over there and I give you the command.
[02:40:17.598 --> 02:40:21.339]  And if you don't obey me, I'll excommunicate you and your soul will be in hell.
[02:40:21.339 --> 02:40:24.060]  This is what was going on during the Dark Ages.
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:27.781]  So more and more countries were saying, no, we don't believe this anymore.
[02:40:27.781 --> 02:40:30.541]  We don't believe the Pope has the authority to do that.
[02:40:30.541 --> 02:40:35.603]  And they were listening to men like Martin Luther and William Tyndale and Calvin and others.
[02:40:35.603 --> 02:40:36.483]  And, uh, so...
[02:40:37.633 --> 02:40:46.780]  The Jesuits had to come up with a plan to somehow or other do something about all of these Protestant kings and queens that were opposing them.
[02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:48.341]  Now, there's two different views.
[02:40:48.341 --> 02:40:58.869]  There are some who believe that the infidels, that infidelity, which is really what the revolutionaries were about, getting rid of God altogether, just rose up in the midst of all this.
[02:40:59.907 --> 02:41:08.554]  And decided to get rid of Roman Catholicism, get rid of Protestantism, get rid of all of it, and that that's what the Illuminati was about.
[02:41:08.554 --> 02:41:19.123]  But then there are others, Alex, who believe because the Illuminati was founded at the University of Ingolstadt by a Jesuit named Adam Weishaupt.
[02:41:19.123 --> 02:41:20.724]  And he was a Jesuit priest.
[02:41:20.724 --> 02:41:28.210]  And he openly stated that he was going to use the methods of revolution and infiltration and information
[02:41:28.903 --> 02:41:37.327]  warfare that the Jesuits had been perfecting from Sun Tzu's The Art of War that they brought from China and translated and so on.
[02:41:37.327 --> 02:41:49.413]  And if you read authors like F. Tupper Saucy, who wrote the book Rulers of Evil, Saucy believes that the Illuminati is really a front organization for the Jesuit order.
[02:41:49.413 --> 02:41:56.597]  And that the Illuminati, because the Jesuits became so nefarious, they were kicked out of 40 countries throughout Europe, they were kicked out of Japan,
[02:41:58.029 --> 02:42:01.270]  The name Jesuit was synonymous with Nazi.
[02:42:01.270 --> 02:42:11.472]  You know, everybody thought, you know, if you met or knew a Jesuit, you immediately suspected him as a deceiver and a spy or something like that.
[02:42:11.472 --> 02:42:13.972]  So they had to do something.
[02:42:13.972 --> 02:42:16.293]  And so they developed two mottos.
[02:42:16.293 --> 02:42:21.153]  One, above all else, not too much zeal, to be more subtle.
[02:42:21.153 --> 02:42:23.554]  And they said, let us shun too much light.
[02:42:24.454 --> 02:42:27.816]  Let's not put ourselves out there so that anybody will know who we are.
[02:42:27.816 --> 02:42:30.257]  We need to go back into the shadows here.
[02:42:30.257 --> 02:42:53.848]  And there are some who believe that WISOPT was an instrument of the Jesuit Order who set up the Illuminati as a front organization that could then infiltrate these secret societies like the Freemasons and others and begin to manipulate them to carry out Rome's thousand-year-old agenda of world domination.
[02:42:55.073 --> 02:43:07.838]  When the Jesuits take their oath, for example, they swear in their oath with the Jesuit general, and the general tells them, go into all the world and claim all lands in the name of the Pope.
[02:43:07.838 --> 02:43:13.180]  He who will not accept him as Christ by his region on earth, let him be accursed and exterminated.
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:21.023]  And this is why it is said you find Jesuits in every corner of the world with schools and universities and colleges and so on.
[02:43:21.023 --> 02:43:23.264]  This is why they have gone into all the world.
[02:43:24.088 --> 02:43:29.251]  is to dominate the world for the Pope.
[02:43:29.251 --> 02:43:33.314]  And that's covered in a lamp in the dark, continue.
[02:43:33.314 --> 02:43:48.744]  Yeah, so, and what's interesting is you have all of these secret organizations that will admit, like the Illuminati openly admitted, that they adopted their methodology from the Jesuit order, that they studied what the Jesuits did and how they did it.
[02:43:48.744 --> 02:43:50.645]  The Rockefellers,
[02:43:51.272 --> 02:44:01.274]  There's a book written on the life of John D. Rockefeller, how he developed his whole Rockefeller organization around the discipline of the Jesuit order.
[02:44:01.274 --> 02:44:15.718]  My wife works for an accounting firm, and when she was going through college, she remembers these big accounting firms talking about how they study the Jesuit order to develop their systems for finance and so on.
[02:44:15.718 --> 02:44:20.139]  There was a guy, Alberto Izaga, like a year and a half ago.
[02:44:20.936 --> 02:44:25.958]  Who went nuts suddenly over in London and killed his two-year-old daughter.
[02:44:25.958 --> 02:44:33.441]  And it was a bizarre case, but he was like a millionaire finance guy and worked for some powerful company.
[02:44:33.441 --> 02:44:42.425]  And when they arrested him, while he was on trial, he was muttering that he was part of an international conspiracy to take over the financial world.
[02:44:43.092 --> 02:44:51.919]  And he was working with a secret group of financiers who were using the methods of the Jesuit order to take over the financial world.
[02:44:51.919 --> 02:45:01.467]  Well, I read Heinz Hobel's Order of the Deathshead and I had the Nazi documents where Hitler modeled the Gestapo and his secret police SS off of the Jesuits.
[02:45:01.467 --> 02:45:02.748]  Absolutely.
[02:45:02.748 --> 02:45:04.510]  There's a number of books written about that.
[02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:08.702]  And we talk about that in The Lamp in the Dark as well.
[02:45:08.702 --> 02:45:20.507]  And that whole relationship, a lot of people are shocked when they learn about, you know, the idea that the Vatican was working with Hitler, and that they had a concordat with Germany and so on.
[02:45:20.507 --> 02:45:29.291]  But Adrian Hilton, in his book, The Principle and the Power of Europe, the guy who's talking about the European Union, he says the way to understand that
[02:45:30.015 --> 02:45:35.417]  is to go back and look at the relationship of the Vatican with Charlemagne.
[02:45:35.417 --> 02:45:40.538]  Charlemagne, who was the first Holy Roman Emperor, he reigned over Germany.
[02:45:40.538 --> 02:45:41.178]  Okay?
[02:45:41.178 --> 02:45:49.861]  So all the way back, 8th century A.D., the Pope crowned Charlemagne as, you know, the first Holy Roman Emperor.
[02:45:49.861 --> 02:45:58.503]  And from then on, so many of these European families, if you get the National Geographic documentary, Inside the Vatican,
[02:45:59.196 --> 02:46:02.278]  And it's during the time of Pope John Paul II.
[02:46:02.278 --> 02:46:12.365]  You see all of these royal members of the European families and so on, who go to the Vatican and they all bow down and they kiss the Pope's ring.
[02:46:13.092 --> 02:46:16.734]  You know, and they venerate him like he's a god.
[02:46:16.734 --> 02:46:21.377]  Well, let's expand on that, because I want to, again, from your research, understand something.
[02:46:21.377 --> 02:46:28.482]  We know that the King of England, Eber the VIII, was a Nazi, a fan of Hitler, had to escape Germany once the war started.
[02:46:28.482 --> 02:46:29.843]  He was from a German family.
[02:46:29.843 --> 02:46:33.826]  The House of Windsor is really the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[02:46:33.826 --> 02:46:34.926]  For those that don't know,
[02:46:36.147 --> 02:46:44.774]  Why then, if the Vatican was so powerful and setting up this Continental Empire through Germany and through Mussolini, why then did England and the U.S.
[02:46:44.774 --> 02:46:48.897]  turn against them when we know the Illuminists were involved, as your films show?
[02:46:49.969 --> 02:47:04.592]  In a lot of the formation of the United States and the Freemasons, if that's all controlled by the Vatican, then why, and we know there was a secret peace treaty now declassified between England and Germany, so why then was Hitler rebuffed?
[02:47:04.592 --> 02:47:07.793]  Because it does appear there are some power shifts here.
[02:47:07.793 --> 02:47:16.435]  Clearly Bilderberg is dominated by the papacy, but then it interlocks with the United States, and so do these groups fight sometimes, or what's going on?
[02:47:17.299 --> 02:47:21.580]  It seems, you know, there are different theories that I've read, because that's a great question.
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:25.981]  It's the one that, you know, sort of drives the research, so much of it.
[02:47:25.981 --> 02:47:31.022]  But, from the arguments that I've heard, it's kind of like the ordo ob chaos.
[02:47:31.022 --> 02:47:39.743]  Order out of chaos, you create the chaos, and from that, you know, through the chaos that you've created, you establish your world order.
[02:47:39.743 --> 02:47:42.544]  And there are some people who believe that Germany
[02:47:43.217 --> 02:47:44.278]  was being used.
[02:47:44.278 --> 02:47:53.745]  There are some who even think that Germany was used specifically because it was Martin Luther, who was a German, who from Germany launched the Protestant Reformation.
[02:47:53.745 --> 02:48:12.359]  Well, it was... We actually know from the Lord Milner group that right after World War I, these are public documents, they said, we're going to finance a war leader, we're going to build Germany up, and then we're going to destroy them, just like World War I. And so it was a repeat of that.
[02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:30.431]  That concurs with the research that I've been getting and the theories that people believe that the reason Rome and the Jesuits wanted revenge on Germany, that they wanted to use Germany, if you will, as this kind of instrument of destruction,
[02:48:31.067 --> 02:48:39.469]  Was partly revenge for the Reformation, because it was from Germany that the reform was launched, you know?
[02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:45.531]  But I mean, why do that when Germany was pretty much a Catholic country at that time?
[02:48:45.531 --> 02:48:51.613]  And through the World Council of Churches the Rockefellers set up, most of the Protestant churches are New World Order now.
[02:48:51.613 --> 02:48:54.714]  I mean, because you're going back to the Jesuit stealth mode.
[02:48:55.805 --> 02:49:00.506]  Right, now that's a very good question, and I wish I had a more detailed answer for you.
[02:49:00.506 --> 02:49:04.207]  I think there's something to the doctrine.
[02:49:04.207 --> 02:49:15.369]  If you study the Jesuits in history, they were always known for their revenge, and that they would not stop until they got vengeance on whoever it was that had opposed them.
[02:49:15.369 --> 02:49:24.971]  And this is why John Adams says in his quote, he says that all the monarchs of Europe trembled in fear over the idea of Jesuit assassination.
[02:49:25.635 --> 02:49:29.356]  Because if you cross these guys, they didn't care how long it took.
[02:49:29.356 --> 02:49:31.997]  It could take a year, five years, ten years.
[02:49:31.997 --> 02:49:33.917]  They would come after you.
[02:49:33.917 --> 02:49:36.498]  And they would find a way to get you.
[02:49:36.498 --> 02:49:44.840]  One of the popes that suppressed them signed a bull, you know, of eternal excommunication for the Jesuits.
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:46.041]  Yeah, that's another issue.
[02:49:46.041 --> 02:49:48.902]  Why did the Catholic Church go after the Jesuits?
[02:49:48.902 --> 02:49:51.742]  So are you saying it's more the Jesuits than just the Catholics?
[02:49:51.742 --> 02:49:53.343]  I mean, it's so complex.
[02:49:54.071 --> 02:49:55.152]  It is.
[02:49:55.152 --> 02:50:06.879]  The way that I see it, there's a medal that they, like a medal that they strike in Rome, or at least in the 19th century, where you have the Pope sitting up on a high altar in St.
[02:50:06.879 --> 02:50:09.961]  Peter's, and all these cardinals kneeling down in front of him.
[02:50:09.961 --> 02:50:16.766]  And there's a Latin phrase that says, Whom they create, they adore.
[02:50:16.766 --> 02:50:18.907]  Okay?
[02:50:18.907 --> 02:50:20.248]  Crem Criant Adorant.
[02:50:20.248 --> 02:50:21.669]  Who they create, they adore.
[02:50:22.242 --> 02:50:27.844]  The Jesuits, if you read their writings, they believe the Pope is kind of like their idol.
[02:50:27.844 --> 02:50:36.827]  Okay, just as a man would take a, you know, a chisel and carve out an idol from stone and then set it up on an altar, that's what the Pope is for them.
[02:50:36.827 --> 02:50:42.729]  They create him, they put him up on an altar, and he's got to be the Pope that they want him to be.
[02:50:43.214 --> 02:50:45.255]  So it's a figurehead.
[02:50:45.255 --> 02:50:47.316]  It's an organizational structure.
[02:50:47.316 --> 02:50:48.096]  Exactly.
[02:50:48.096 --> 02:50:51.837]  Around which the power behind the throne builds its system.
[02:50:51.837 --> 02:50:56.539]  Well, there's no doubt that Rome is deeply behind the EU.
[02:50:56.539 --> 02:50:58.160]  No doubt it's calling for a new world order.
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:00.420]  And just hardcore info.
[02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:01.261]  Stay with us, Chris Pinto.
[02:51:01.261 --> 02:51:04.802]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:04.802 --> 02:51:07.082]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:07.082 --> 02:51:07.963]  Don't!
[02:51:07.963 --> 02:51:11.384]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[02:51:39.435 --> 02:51:40.795]  What have you got to lose?

[02:51:53.362 --> 02:51:56.224]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:56.224 --> 02:51:58.785]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:58.785 --> 02:52:02.707]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.852 --> 02:52:14.533]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.533 --> 02:52:20.914]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.914 --> 02:52:26.456]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.456 --> 02:52:36.078]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.198 --> 02:52:38.559]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.559 --> 02:52:40.139]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.139 --> 02:52:42.600]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:44.720]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:49.862]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:02.358 --> 02:53:05.741]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:53:05.741 --> 02:53:13.928]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:53:13.928 --> 02:53:19.253]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:53:19.253 --> 02:53:22.236]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[02:53:26.119 --> 02:53:29.324]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com!
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:42.221]  Well, this is a huge subject.
[02:54:08.434 --> 02:54:11.076]  And the globalists love to divide and conquer.
[02:54:11.076 --> 02:54:16.880]  You know, they have camps that say the Catholics are the center of all evil, or Masons are, or Jews.
[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:21.123]  And what I've found from my research is that humans are all humans, people are people.
[02:54:21.123 --> 02:54:24.145]  You got good people, you got bad people from all groups.
[02:54:24.145 --> 02:54:30.409]  But there were systems developed in Europe in the last 2,000 years of manipulation, of control.
[02:54:30.409 --> 02:54:33.911]  A lot of it borrowed from the Roman Empire and their 500 years of managing an empire, 500 plus years.
[02:54:37.046 --> 02:54:38.207]  I'm glad that Chris
[02:54:58.820 --> 02:55:03.303]  Well, one point that I wanted to make, just to address something that you've been saying, Alex, we try to make the point in the film
[02:55:23.502 --> 02:55:32.030]  That most all of your major reformers through the Middle Ages and the Dark Ages were Catholic priests.
[02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:42.781]  Guys like John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, Jan Hus, Jerome of Prague, all of these were Catholic priests who began reading the Bible.
[02:55:42.781 --> 02:55:46.745]  And they just fell in love with the Word of God and they began to speak out.
[02:55:47.425 --> 02:55:48.766]  Uh, on behalf of the truth.
[02:55:48.766 --> 02:55:52.348]  Uh, and some of them never actually even left the Catholic priesthood.
[02:55:52.348 --> 02:55:55.110]  They were defrocked, like Tyndale and so on.
[02:55:55.110 --> 02:56:03.676]  Uh, even in the 19th century, uh, Charles Chinoquy, uh, who, you know, wrote the book, 50 Years in the Church of Rome, where he's trying to warn America.
[02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:09.913]  About really Rome's infiltration of the United States and their plan to take over the country.
[02:56:09.913 --> 02:56:13.516]  Well, I know one thing, and this is what I really don't like.
[02:56:13.516 --> 02:56:22.781]  The Catholic Church is promoting breaking down our borders, not just in Europe, but with Mexico and bankrupting our nation and making us a third world police state like Latin America.
[02:56:22.781 --> 02:56:25.883]  That's something you can definitely nail on the Vatican's door.
[02:56:26.792 --> 02:56:38.294]  Well, they believe, those who research that from what I'm reading, they believe that the influx of the Irish immigrants, the Italian immigrants, these are all Catholics coming in.
[02:56:38.294 --> 02:56:43.655]  And that the Popes, for over a hundred years, have wanted to flood this country with Roman Catholics.
[02:56:43.655 --> 02:56:51.477]  And they believe that's the reason why they want all of the Mexicans to come in, through the border, to build up the Catholic population, so they'll vote
[02:56:52.197 --> 02:56:55.039]  According to the commandments of the papacy.
[02:56:55.039 --> 02:57:11.191]  But separately, we have the immigrants voting for abortion and things, and supporting Obama with this new fake coffee party, stealing our idea to actually help the Tea Party be more constitutional and take it back away from the Republicans.
[02:57:11.191 --> 02:57:14.653]  Again, I'm trying to figure all this out, Chris.
[02:57:14.653 --> 02:57:18.456]  Well, with Roma, here's a picture I would give, Alex, very quickly.
[02:57:18.456 --> 02:57:19.897]  When the Pope came to America,
[02:57:20.709 --> 02:57:25.891]  George Bush, the conservative Republican president, came and met him, right, and honored him greatly.
[02:57:25.891 --> 02:57:32.554]  And with him was Nancy Pelosi, the ultimate left-wing liberal, who came and bowed down and kissed his ring.
[02:57:32.554 --> 02:57:38.256]  People often think of Rome as being conservative, but they forget the liberal side of Rome.
[02:57:38.256 --> 02:57:45.319]  The Kennedy family is very Roman Catholic, and they're very pro-abortion, very liberal, and so on.
[02:57:45.319 --> 02:57:48.520]  It was Notre Dame that brought Obama in and gave him
[02:57:49.711 --> 02:57:57.113]  But as you said, just as it was 500 years ago, there are a lot of Catholics worldwide who are very conservative and are upset about what's happening.
[02:58:12.708 --> 02:58:14.049]  Absolutely.
[02:58:14.049 --> 02:58:20.273]  And it's often said that if Catholics in America knew fully what the Vatican was up to, they would be outraged.
[02:58:20.273 --> 02:58:21.253]  All right.
[02:58:21.253 --> 02:58:23.054]  Well, Chris Pinto, amazing film.
[02:58:23.054 --> 02:58:25.216]  People should watch it and make up their mind for themselves.
[02:58:25.216 --> 02:58:26.256]  Do more research.
[02:58:26.256 --> 02:58:31.800]  A Lamp in the Dark, The Untold History of the Bible, available at Infowars.com.
[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:34.501]  Chris, we eagerly await your next release.
[02:58:34.501 --> 02:58:36.223]  We'll talk to you again soon in the future.
[02:58:36.223 --> 02:58:37.123]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:58:37.123 --> 02:58:37.743]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:58:37.743 --> 02:58:38.204]  Take care.
[02:58:38.204 --> 02:58:38.844]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:38.844 --> 02:58:40.005]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:43.516 --> 02:58:45.998]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:03.050 --> 02:59:09.495]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:11.769 --> 02:59:12.592]  We're good to go.
[02:59:20.131 --> 02:59:24.853]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:59:24.853 --> 02:59:28.674]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:59:28.674 --> 02:59:29.914]  Others don't.
[02:59:29.914 --> 02:59:32.075]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:32.075 --> 02:59:33.856]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:33.856 --> 02:59:36.737]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:59:46.060 --> 02:59:48.441]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:59:48.441 --> 02:59:49.301]  Others don't.
[02:59:53.985 --> 02:59:56.386]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.386 --> 03:00:08.428]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.428 --> 03:00:16.050]  The entire world is watching what's just happened in Iceland.
[03:00:16.050 --> 03:00:17.630]  Goldman Sachs and others.
[03:00:20.788 --> 03:00:27.770]  Went in in the last five years, got the country deep in debt in derivatives, knowing they were going to implode the derivatives.
[03:00:27.770 --> 03:00:35.452]  This is just the wealth they get with all this fiat financial made-off Ponzi scheme garbage.
[03:00:35.452 --> 03:00:44.734]  It's that once it implodes, the banks come in and loan more money to the government, literally indenturing the people as slaves.
[03:00:47.045 --> 03:00:51.577]  And the whole world is watching because Greece, the people are revolting.
[03:00:51.577 --> 03:00:55.387]  Ten years ago, Goldman Sachs went in, set up a system, got them deep in debt.
[03:00:56.434 --> 03:00:57.955]  The banks got rich off of it.
[03:00:57.955 --> 03:01:05.141]  Now they're saying the roads, the infrastructure, the famous places, the islands must be given to the private bankers.
[03:01:05.141 --> 03:01:09.604]  Top Democratic and Republican lawmakers are saying the same thing is now going to happen here.
[03:01:09.604 --> 03:01:12.146]  We're a year and a half into the banker takeover of October 2008.
[03:01:12.146 --> 03:01:17.730]  The financial terrorism, where they said, give us unlimited trillions or we'll have a depression.
[03:01:17.730 --> 03:01:19.892]  We're going to use it to unfreeze the mortgage market.
[03:01:19.892 --> 03:01:26.117]  Then they clamped down on the mortgage market even more, hoarded the money, and they won't say where the money went.
[03:01:28.086 --> 03:01:32.411]  So here's the headline, Iceland Votes No to Debt Deal for Collapsed Bank.
[03:01:32.411 --> 03:01:42.703]  Now, a year ago they declared anti-terror powers on Iceland, froze people's bank accounts, wouldn't let them get their own money out, saying your money is ours for the Dutch, British and US banks.
[03:01:43.939 --> 03:01:45.239]  Well, thanks for having me.
[03:02:12.884 --> 03:02:14.304]  It's good to have you here.
[03:02:14.304 --> 03:02:25.927]  We're about to go to break, but this is huge what happened, because if the rest of the world takes what you've done as an example, we could end up actually routing this group of criminals.
[03:02:25.927 --> 03:02:26.687]  Absolutely.
[03:02:26.687 --> 03:02:38.449]  I mean, I hope that what we did by forcing the government to allow the nation to vote on this will be an inspiration for other people, and it was actually
[03:02:39.181 --> 03:02:44.523]  More than 60%, almost 63% of the nation showed up to the polls.
[03:02:44.523 --> 03:02:47.244]  And it was a 93% no.
[03:02:47.244 --> 03:02:51.125]  93% said no?
[03:02:51.125 --> 03:02:53.906]  93% said no to what?
[03:02:53.906 --> 03:02:56.187]  Tell folks specifically what happened.
[03:02:56.187 --> 03:03:02.609]  They basically were saying no of privatization or socialization of private debt.
[03:03:02.609 --> 03:03:04.730]  Or in other words, to pay lots of taxes.
[03:03:05.848 --> 03:03:14.255]  The socialization of private debt, or the bankers come in, sell a bunch of derivatives, and then claim the people owe it.
[03:03:14.255 --> 03:03:29.829]  Well, the thing is, we had some of the Atlantic bankers decided to branch out because of EU regulations, branch out to Europe, open internet bank accounts there, and then when these accounts collapsed,
[03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:40.216]  The president of the government claims that the Icelandic nation should fork out the space guarantee for this.
[03:03:40.216 --> 03:03:49.782]  And you have to bear in mind there are like 317,000 people living in Iceland and the accounts in Holland and Britain were around 320,000.
[03:03:49.782 --> 03:03:53.425]  So each Icelander should have shouldered around 20,000 euros per person.
[03:03:56.007 --> 03:04:01.830]  And to add insult to injury, they use anti-terror laws to try to take people's money.
[03:04:01.830 --> 03:04:20.318]  Yeah, what they did just shortly after the collapse, Mr. Darling, the UK finance minister decided to, and Mr. Brown, a minister of the UK, decided to put terrorist acts on Iceland, which classified us among other
[03:04:21.323 --> 03:04:28.104]  Well, let's break down the history of what happened, what it's led to, where you go from here.
[03:04:28.104 --> 03:04:28.924]  This is so exciting.
[03:04:49.938 --> 03:04:53.764]  90 plus percent of the country saying no to the jackals.
[03:04:53.764 --> 03:04:56.309]  The Icelanders know who their enemy is.
[03:04:56.309 --> 03:04:57.891]  They know who the criminals are.
[03:04:57.891 --> 03:04:59.114]  Will we follow their example?
[03:05:02.358 --> 03:05:06.359]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:05:06.359 --> 03:05:09.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:14.401]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:05:14.401 --> 03:05:20.803]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:05:20.803 --> 03:05:23.044]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:05:23.584 --> 03:05:23.884]  Tim Geithner?
[03:05:23.884 --> 03:05:24.385]  Bernanke?
[03:05:24.385 --> 03:05:25.005]  They're arsonists!
[03:05:25.005 --> 03:05:25.725]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:05:25.725 --> 03:05:27.847]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:05:42.475 --> 03:05:46.859]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[03:05:46.859 --> 03:05:49.761]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:08:02.825 --> 03:08:09.481]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.481 --> 03:08:12.467]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.895 --> 03:08:21.218]  Parliament member from Iceland, Birgitta Jones-Dottir is our guest, one of the main leaders, the leader of her party.
[03:08:21.218 --> 03:08:29.361]  90 plus percent voting over the weekend to say no to the private bank heist, the banking tyranny.
[03:08:29.361 --> 03:08:33.222]  You have found it, folks, the tip of the spear in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:08:33.222 --> 03:08:34.603]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:08:34.603 --> 03:08:35.743]  to 3 p.m.
[03:08:35.743 --> 03:08:41.986]  Central, the most listened to alternative patriot radio show on AM and FM, Global Shortwave Satellite and Internet.
[03:08:42.686 --> 03:08:44.367]  Going back to Birgitta.
[03:08:44.367 --> 03:08:56.995]  Continuing, recap what the banks did, the fraud, the year of protest, the terrorism act used, the threats by the banks to shut your country down, food shortages, and the people standing strong.
[03:08:59.022 --> 03:09:06.947]  Well, I guess it all began, well, I'm sure many of you listeners have seen the film about Enron.
[03:09:06.947 --> 03:09:10.709]  And Enron was about the same size as the population in Iceland.
[03:09:10.709 --> 03:09:22.977]  So, very many, when we watched Enron on the national TV in Iceland, very many people felt that we had, were like the regular staff of Enron, not knowing what the tops were up to.
[03:09:22.977 --> 03:09:25.559]  And when everything collapsed in August 2008,
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:32.621]  Most people in Iceland had no idea what was going on, so it came as a complete shock to the nation.
[03:09:32.621 --> 03:09:44.924]  So what had happened five years prior, the banks were privatized with a little help from the Independence Party in Iceland and Progressive Party.
[03:09:44.924 --> 03:09:52.506]  They basically donated the banks at really very good prices, wholesale prices to their friends and allies.
[03:09:54.626 --> 03:10:07.270]  And because we are like 80% of our regulations around banks are based on the EU regulations, they managed to start to rent out to other countries.
[03:10:07.270 --> 03:10:13.513]  And they were basically, like very many of the bankers, high on world domination.
[03:10:15.197 --> 03:10:31.903]  I don't know, fantasies and they wanted to take over the banks, the bank sector in the UK and in Europe and I guess they didn't make a lot of friends and you know in general they were quite naive and they had no understanding about how the system worked in general.
[03:10:31.903 --> 03:10:36.605]  So it was like school children running amok with a lot of you know virtual money.
[03:10:37.862 --> 03:10:46.249]  Which they sort of sucked out of regular bank or, you know, people that save their money in banks and so forth.
[03:10:46.249 --> 03:10:57.637]  And they actually conned people into moving their savings into these unsaved accounts and it especially targeted the elderly people and immigrants and so forth.
[03:10:57.637 --> 03:11:01.020]  But that was during the last year of this insanity.
[03:11:01.020 --> 03:11:05.944]  So people in general thought that we were going through this incredible big boom.
[03:11:07.074 --> 03:11:10.517]  Which I guess was largely just an illusion.
[03:11:10.517 --> 03:11:14.140]  So people took loans.
[03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:20.305]  They offered 100% loans on mortgages and so forth and foreign currency loans on cars.
[03:11:20.305 --> 03:11:24.128]  And right now, very many people are facing foreclosures.
[03:11:24.128 --> 03:11:25.989]  They are facing foreclosures because of
[03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:32.875]  And to be clear, the banks have done this in Argentina, in Greece, in Spain, in the US.
[03:11:32.875 --> 03:11:33.075]  They make
[03:11:50.811 --> 03:11:54.754]  This fiat derivatives bubble, it's just made-up crud paper.
[03:11:54.754 --> 03:11:57.496]  They certify it as AAA gold-rated.
[03:11:57.496 --> 03:11:58.757]  They sell it to governments.
[03:11:58.757 --> 03:11:59.938]  They sell it to citizens.
[03:11:59.938 --> 03:12:01.279]  They get all the wealth.
[03:12:01.279 --> 03:12:13.388]  And then it came out that Goldman Sachs and others, by design, Mainstream News, McClatchy Newspapers and others, they then blow it out at the time of their choosing and use the implosion to then come in and buy everything up.
[03:12:13.388 --> 03:12:18.011]  And Iceland is the only modern country to be put through this scam to say no.
[03:12:18.011 --> 03:12:18.412]  Continue.
[03:12:20.097 --> 03:12:23.678]  Yeah, well, that was a long way to get to that now, I tell you.
[03:12:23.678 --> 03:12:26.439]  A lot of fight.
[03:12:26.439 --> 03:12:48.264]  But in general, what happened, you know, as I'm sure that most of the listeners to this show understand how the IMF works, so what happened after the Terrorist Act was placed on Iceland, the UK and the Netherlands government said, with a little help from our Nordic friends, said, OK, if you want to be
[03:12:49.744 --> 03:12:54.687]  Get any loans or the loan lines open, you're going to have to go into an IMF program.
[03:12:54.687 --> 03:13:04.333]  And in order for you to go into the IMF program, you're going to have to solve this ISAF dispute, which is this dispute about the banks that were in the UK and Holland.
[03:13:04.753 --> 03:13:06.415]  And so let me just stop you for a moment.
[03:13:06.415 --> 03:13:22.632]  Going back a year ago, the food's not being shipped in, everything's falling apart, they're saying we've got to sell all the government assets, take citizens' tax money, all for these banks, and the BBC reported Iceland, Britain's unlikely new enemy, this is from a year ago,
[03:13:23.212 --> 03:13:27.695]  And it says, until a few days ago, Britain was admired and respected by the average Icelander.
[03:13:27.695 --> 03:13:34.841]  But the UK's move to seize the assets of this isolated European state have provoked a backlash, a feeling of escalating resentment.
[03:13:34.841 --> 03:13:45.389]  They, quote, treated us like terrorists, grabbing the government accounts, grabbing people's bank accounts, saying, we're going to take your money under terror laws and give it to the bankers.
[03:13:45.389 --> 03:13:45.809]  Continue.
[03:13:47.281 --> 03:13:49.102]  Well, it was maybe not that extreme.
[03:13:49.102 --> 03:13:54.566]  It was, they took over an Icelandic bank called the Heritable Bank in London.
[03:13:54.566 --> 03:14:08.014]  But what it did, it dried up the credit lines to Iceland, the loan lines, so everybody had to fork up cash during time of complete financial... But that's what it said, that in some cases people couldn't even get their money out for a while, though.
[03:14:08.154 --> 03:14:11.336]  Yeah, everything was blocked.
[03:14:11.336 --> 03:14:23.864]  Students and people from Iceland living abroad could not get money out of their internet banks and so forth, so they had to either starve or rely on friends and family if they had any in the area.
[03:14:23.864 --> 03:14:24.784]  But it also created
[03:14:27.484 --> 03:14:38.550]  A very difficult paradox because the Social Democratic Party that is in power now in Iceland have just one dream and that is to join the European Union.
[03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:41.112]  So within all of this turmoil
[03:14:42.032 --> 03:14:46.538]  They decided let's apply for an application or to join the UA.
[03:14:46.538 --> 03:14:48.260]  Yeah, that's key.
[03:14:48.260 --> 03:14:56.150]  Just like Greece 10 years ago, you've got to go into debt and sign the deals with these bankers as part of their rules to get into the EU.
[03:14:58.217 --> 03:15:01.559]  Well, also how they basically used it.
[03:15:01.559 --> 03:15:07.702]  The UK and the Netherlands governments basically blackmailed us with the EU application as well.
[03:15:07.702 --> 03:15:18.568]  They said we will not support your EU application unless you decide to go to court over ISAFE.
[03:15:18.568 --> 03:15:21.609]  Unless you just choose to
[03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:33.659]  You're going to have to either choose to become isolated, become, you know, North Cuba or Cuba of the North, or do as we tell you.
[03:15:33.659 --> 03:15:44.909]  And that is, they actually, they went even so far as wanting to make a hell of a lot of money out of us by giving us, forcing us to pay huge interest on this.
[03:15:45.589 --> 03:16:04.539]  So, but we managed to stop that and right now I am in a committee of the leadership working on finding a solution to this and I find it completely unacceptable that the Icelandic nation will take on any burden from this ordeal.
[03:16:08.081 --> 03:16:10.683]  A member of the Icelandic Parliament continuing.
[03:16:10.683 --> 03:16:12.605]  So let's move up to the referendum.
[03:16:12.605 --> 03:16:13.966]  What did the referendum state?
[03:16:13.966 --> 03:16:16.088]  It passed by over 90%.
[03:16:16.088 --> 03:16:32.382]  As you just told us, this is completely freaking the bankers out, because if countries realize this has been done by fraud, and that it's a made-off scheme, and that the money's not owed, the next step is talking about prosecuting the bankers that Ron Paul and others are talking about in this country.
[03:16:34.977 --> 03:16:45.528]  Well, the interesting thing and really disturbing thing about the bankers in Iceland, or the Icelandic bankers, is that none of their assets have been frozen.
[03:16:45.528 --> 03:16:52.975]  Most of them are living in London, and as many people know, London is ranked among the fifth best tax havens in the world.
[03:16:56.639 --> 03:16:59.081]  They're actually getting back their companies.
[03:16:59.081 --> 03:17:04.225]  They're getting back their power and a lot of write-offs and that is making a lot of people very upset and angry.
[03:17:04.225 --> 03:17:06.727]  Okay, to be clear, flesh that out.
[03:17:06.727 --> 03:17:15.795]  The bankers that sold you out in your own country, most of them don't even live in your country and the banks know that they're their minions, so they're staying in power.
[03:17:17.199 --> 03:17:20.984]  Yeah, I mean they lost the banks, but they haven't lost their companies.
[03:17:20.984 --> 03:17:29.795]  So, I mean, one of the oligarchs, the Icelandic oligarchs, he owns the biggest independent media outlet in Iceland.
[03:17:29.795 --> 03:17:33.059]  So you can imagine what sort of news you're getting from that outlet.
[03:17:33.459 --> 03:17:37.102]  But the good news is 90 plus percent vote against him.
[03:17:37.102 --> 03:17:38.203]  It shows it's not working.
[03:17:38.203 --> 03:17:40.224]  But that's what they always have brokerage firms.
[03:17:40.224 --> 03:17:41.785]  They separately run banks.
[03:17:41.785 --> 03:17:43.466]  They get the taxpayers money.
[03:17:43.466 --> 03:17:45.788]  They move the money out into their own accounts.
[03:17:45.788 --> 03:17:48.470]  Then they implode it and try to take over the nation.
[03:17:48.470 --> 03:17:49.711]  But you've checkmated them.
[03:17:51.141 --> 03:17:54.143]  Well, for now, yes, definitely.
[03:17:54.143 --> 03:18:03.127]  And I guess, I don't know, it actually surprised me that the President of Iceland decided to listen to the nation, but there was a huge petition.
[03:18:03.127 --> 03:18:10.031]  More than 60,000 Icelanders called on him to allow us to have this national referendum.
[03:18:10.031 --> 03:18:14.593]  And it was interesting, there was actually some documents leaked
[03:18:16.074 --> 03:18:16.815]  from the U.S.
[03:18:16.815 --> 03:18:28.181]  Embassy in Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, and I found it on vilkiligs.org, and it was interesting how the British and the U.S.
[03:18:28.181 --> 03:18:32.344]  Treasury were very much interested in doing everything in their power to stop
[03:18:32.884 --> 03:18:34.484]  The National Referendum.
[03:18:34.484 --> 03:18:55.590]  And then the same thing applied to, I got some information that, I don't know if you're familiar with the Paris Club, but they were very keen on stopping this National Referendum because, especially in Europe, they're very much afraid that, like Greece and Ireland, the people there will demand to have a National Referendum about the situation in their countries.
[03:18:56.266 --> 03:18:57.107]  Oh, this is big.
[03:18:57.107 --> 03:18:58.490]  This is huge.
[03:18:58.490 --> 03:18:59.852]  I mean, the magnitude of this.
[03:18:59.852 --> 03:19:02.135]  Sending the message that this is fraud.
[03:19:02.135 --> 03:19:03.357]  We're not paying it.
[03:19:03.357 --> 03:19:09.607]  We're about to go to break, but start telling us about the documents and the Paris Club and how the banks don't like what's happened in Iceland.
[03:19:14.186 --> 03:19:17.968]  And the Paris Club Cartel is a very interesting club.
[03:19:17.968 --> 03:19:30.855]  It is sort of a secret club run out of Paris with some of the most powerful nations in the world and they determine the interest rates on nations that have debt moratorium.
[03:19:30.855 --> 03:19:32.196]  And apparently it is
[03:19:33.997 --> 03:19:38.459]  The case of Iceland and that national referendum has been discussed in that club.
[03:19:38.459 --> 03:19:46.784]  I did a research trying to figure out who is in the club, who attended the meetings, and it is impossible to find any information, at least on the internet.
[03:19:46.784 --> 03:19:54.008]  So I would actually call on, if anybody that's listening to this has any information about the Paris Club, please provide me with that information.
[03:19:54.008 --> 03:19:56.049]  We'll give your email out before you leave.
[03:19:56.049 --> 03:20:00.451]  A lot more coming up with a member of the Icelandic Parliament.
[03:20:04.506 --> 03:20:10.810]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[03:20:10.810 --> 03:20:13.012]  The world is changing fast.
[03:20:13.012 --> 03:20:14.453]  Are you fully prepared?
[03:20:15.254 --> 03:20:18.436]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[03:20:18.436 --> 03:20:29.184]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and 6 varieties of canned meat for half price.
[03:20:29.184 --> 03:20:38.870]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[03:20:40.518 --> 03:20:45.382]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[03:20:45.382 --> 03:20:49.985]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[03:20:49.985 --> 03:20:52.927]  Food insurance, just in case.
[03:20:52.927 --> 03:20:57.551]  Owned by me, Big John Lipstam, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[03:21:02.541 --> 03:21:06.568]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.568 --> 03:21:09.813]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.813 --> 03:21:11.236]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:11.934 --> 03:21:15.355]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:15.355 --> 03:21:20.976]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.976 --> 03:21:26.538]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.538 --> 03:21:36.160]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.280 --> 03:21:38.642]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.642 --> 03:21:40.223]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.223 --> 03:21:42.685]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.685 --> 03:21:44.806]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.806 --> 03:21:49.950]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:59.077]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:12.943]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:22:12.943 --> 03:22:19.385]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:22:19.385 --> 03:22:28.247]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:22:28.627 --> 03:22:37.814]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:22:37.814 --> 03:22:42.677]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:22:42.677 --> 03:22:44.218]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:44.218 --> 03:22:46.720]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[03:22:55.784 --> 03:23:00.807]  Lose one to two pounds a day the healthy way and keep it off with the help of the entire Real HCG Diet with an average weight
[03:23:12.073 --> 03:23:12.333]  I'm good.

[03:23:33.162 --> 03:23:34.483]  No doctor visit required.
[03:23:34.483 --> 03:23:35.724]  No painful injections.

[03:23:52.575 --> 03:23:53.736]  Again, that's 877-748-2709 at YourHCG.com.
[03:24:03.502 --> 03:24:05.223]  It's a mind game.
[03:24:05.223 --> 03:24:15.731]  Can the Ken Lay, Bernie Madoff types that are running the international banking scam take over the planet, set up a bank of the world that you pay all your carbon taxes to?
[03:24:15.731 --> 03:24:17.632]  That's being announced.
[03:24:17.632 --> 03:24:31.702]  Can they make Spain, the US, England, Iceland, Argentina, Nigeria pay 30 plus percent compounded interest on fraudulent crud they created and sold to governments?
[03:24:33.112 --> 03:24:34.773]  Why aren't they going bankrupt?
[03:24:34.773 --> 03:24:37.134]  Why aren't they being arrested for the fraud?
[03:24:37.134 --> 03:24:41.277]  Why aren't countries saying, no, we're not going to give in to your financial terrorism?
[03:24:41.277 --> 03:24:44.739]  Are they told Iceland they would destroy them in the last year?
[03:24:45.763 --> 03:24:51.326]  If they didn't capitulate and basically become debt slaves of these people in perpetuity.
[03:24:51.326 --> 03:24:58.270]  Iceland had a referendum, 93% said no over the weekend.
[03:24:58.270 --> 03:25:08.175]  And one of the ladies who came from nowhere, just like you can do as citizens around the world, with the truth, founded a party, is the leader of it, one of the main groups that got this done.
[03:25:08.975 --> 03:25:20.619]  Is Birgitta Jones-Dottir joining us from Iceland, and we'll give you her email and website before she leaves us later in the hour, so that you can send her any intel, because we're all working together on this.
[03:25:20.619 --> 03:25:24.860]  We'll talk about some other initiatives in Iceland, it being a beacon, a hub of freedom.
[03:25:24.860 --> 03:25:31.162]  So tell us about the threats, what led up to the referendum, what the referendum states, and now where you go from here.
[03:25:34.486 --> 03:25:54.722]  Well, what led to the referendum was that basically we had a contract made between the nations last summer and it was so bad that the parliament actually had to spend two or three months making amendments to it in order for it to be safe for us to pass it.
[03:25:55.462 --> 03:26:08.771]  And it still has that incredibly high interest and so forth, but we did put some roof on the payment in accordance with GDP, so if there was no growth in Iceland then we wouldn't pay anything during those years.
[03:26:08.771 --> 03:26:13.174]  However, it was extremely bad and we're still paying 5.5% interest.
[03:26:13.174 --> 03:26:13.675]  Which compounds?
[03:26:19.031 --> 03:26:19.631]  5.5% interest on it.
[03:26:19.631 --> 03:26:26.775]  So just paying the interest would have, they're like, okay, so 317,000 people in Iceland, 80,000 Icelandic taxpayers would be paying only the interest of this ISAFE deal.
[03:26:37.201 --> 03:26:37.662]  Exactly.
[03:26:53.962 --> 03:26:55.663]  Go ahead.
[03:26:55.663 --> 03:27:09.567]  And the thing is that the IMF, which is supposed to be, you know, supposed to be an institute, you know, something that all nations that are part of it pay into every year, and is supposed not to be interfering in
[03:27:11.047 --> 03:27:13.050]  Between states or between countries.
[03:27:13.050 --> 03:27:20.799]  But the British and they are a big shareholder in it and they have been using it as, you know, to blackmail us into submission.
[03:27:20.799 --> 03:27:27.847]  And that upset Icelanders tremendously because most Icelanders are not very happy or keen to be in an IMF program to begin with.
[03:27:28.388 --> 03:27:38.094]  Because being an IMF program means that there is a complete erosion of everything that we know as a welfare system.
[03:27:38.094 --> 03:27:48.360]  And before all of this, we had a very good educational system, very good health care, everybody had the same access to health care, would get the same doctor as the president without paying anything.
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:54.683]  So we feel that all of that is going to be lost if we don't stand up to these forces we're dealing with.
[03:27:56.662 --> 03:28:04.907]  And I actually put a proposal in Parliament last week about finding a plan B to get rid of the IMF.
[03:28:04.907 --> 03:28:21.216]  Because there's a lot of fantastic experts, economists like Joseph Stiglitz and many more who have offered to help us find a solution that would be different than... And he said the banks are engaging in criminal activity and the Federal Reserve is destroying America.
[03:28:21.216 --> 03:28:22.837]  He's a Nobel Prize winner for those who don't know.
[03:28:24.039 --> 03:28:24.719]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:28:24.719 --> 03:28:30.181]  I actually had the privilege of meeting him last year and also John Perkins.
[03:28:30.181 --> 03:28:38.343]  And John Perkins said that we should form an alliance with countries that are facing similar situations as we are in.
[03:28:38.343 --> 03:28:40.243]  And I think that is actually a very good idea.
[03:28:40.243 --> 03:28:45.285]  And I've been trying to encourage this government, which is a left-wing government,
[03:28:46.605 --> 03:28:56.673]  We should actually be fighting very much against having an IMF program in Iceland, which the IMF program goes very much into privatization of everything.
[03:28:56.673 --> 03:28:58.574]  But we'll see what happens.
[03:28:58.574 --> 03:29:06.139]  You know, really the spirit in Iceland right now, having only like 1.3% of the nation saying yes to this ISAEF deal,
[03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:09.483]  And 93% saying no.
[03:29:09.483 --> 03:29:27.701]  There is really a spirit of or demand from the general public that the parties move beyond party politics and start to work for us, not I and I and I. It's really a time for parties and people to start to focus on joint solutions beyond party politics.
[03:29:27.841 --> 03:29:29.983]  You've got to circle the wagons against the bankers.
[03:29:29.983 --> 03:29:30.363]  Stay there.
[03:29:30.363 --> 03:29:34.165]  We're going to come back and take calls for Birgitta Jones-Dottir.
[03:29:34.165 --> 03:29:35.386]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:35.386 --> 03:29:38.589]  Calls only for her on the banking cartel.
[03:29:38.589 --> 03:29:43.312]  We'll also talk about, are the people of Iceland excited that they've had this big victory?
[03:29:43.312 --> 03:29:45.613]  How will the banking empire strike back?
[03:29:45.613 --> 03:29:45.694]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:45.694 --> 03:29:46.114]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:46.114 --> 03:29:46.954]  We're on the march.
[03:29:46.954 --> 03:29:48.075]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.598 --> 03:30:00.939]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.939 --> 03:30:05.480]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:30:05.480 --> 03:30:06.401]  Number one.
[03:30:06.401 --> 03:30:09.821]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:09.821 --> 03:30:10.682]  Number two.
[03:30:10.682 --> 03:30:15.583]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:15.583 --> 03:30:16.323]  It's true.
[03:30:16.323 --> 03:30:20.864]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:21.184 --> 03:30:22.005]  Number 3.
[03:30:22.005 --> 03:30:25.608]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:30:25.608 --> 03:30:29.511]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:30:29.511 --> 03:30:30.311]  Number 4.
[03:30:30.311 --> 03:30:33.073]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:30:33.073 --> 03:30:36.756]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:36.756 --> 03:30:37.557]  Number 5.
[03:30:37.557 --> 03:30:41.700]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:46.464]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:30:46.744 --> 03:30:50.907]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:50.907 --> 03:30:52.688]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:52.688 --> 03:30:54.949]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[03:31:02.874 --> 03:31:06.897]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.897 --> 03:31:10.139]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.139 --> 03:31:11.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.259 --> 03:31:14.940]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.940 --> 03:31:21.322]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.322 --> 03:31:26.864]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.864 --> 03:31:36.487]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.607 --> 03:31:38.948]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:38.948 --> 03:31:40.549]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.549 --> 03:31:43.011]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.011 --> 03:31:45.132]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.132 --> 03:31:50.274]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.274 --> 03:31:59.399]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:01.485 --> 03:32:02.286]  Hi, everyone.
[03:32:02.286 --> 03:32:03.347]  Andy Anderson here.
[03:32:03.347 --> 03:32:07.773]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:07.773 --> 03:32:13.560]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.560 --> 03:32:17.905]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.905 --> 03:32:19.607]  No more protection until you use it again.
[03:32:19.747 --> 03:32:21.087]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:32:21.087 --> 03:32:25.488]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:32:25.488 --> 03:32:27.669]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:32:27.669 --> 03:32:40.752]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, molds, and fungus, too.
[03:32:40.752 --> 03:32:42.312]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[03:32:42.392 --> 03:32:45.575]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[03:32:45.575 --> 03:32:46.736]  No more dry skin.
[03:32:46.736 --> 03:32:51.340]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ free hours later.
[03:32:51.340 --> 03:32:58.527]  Call now toll free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[03:32:58.527 --> 03:32:58.807]  That's 888-245-0300.
[03:33:06.158 --> 03:33:07.319]  We are back live.
[03:33:07.319 --> 03:33:14.385]  I've got a bunch of Twitter questions that came in on the Twitter account, the radio show Twitter account.
[03:33:14.385 --> 03:33:22.771]  We've also got callers like Rick and Herman and others for our guest, Birgitta Jones-Dottir, member of the Icelandic Parliament.
[03:33:22.771 --> 03:33:24.413]  And that is coming up in one moment.
[03:33:24.413 --> 03:33:34.121]  Joining us via video, Skype from Iceland for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, adding another dimension to the radio slash TV multimedia broadcast transmission.
[03:33:34.781 --> 03:33:38.225]  I want to thank Acolabloo.com for being great sponsors, also having a great product.
[03:33:38.225 --> 03:33:39.006]  I use it in my home.
[03:33:39.006 --> 03:33:41.189]  It's an atmospheric water generation system.
[03:33:41.189 --> 03:33:47.197]  They have smaller units that make seven and a half gallons a day and then send it to reverse osmosis carbon filter systems.
[03:33:47.197 --> 03:33:50.061]  They have bigger units that can supply hundreds or even thousands of people.
[03:33:50.661 --> 03:34:08.389]  Check it out at acolablue.com, that's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, or call them and get a free information packet, or learn more by calling 800-691-6043, that's 800-691-6043, the best, purest, cleanest water you're going to find.
[03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:12.751]  This didn't come out of a sewage system, it didn't come out of a water system, it didn't
[03:34:13.931 --> 03:34:19.333]  Come out of, you know, any government system with fluoride and all the toxins and chemicals, it's out of the air.
[03:34:19.333 --> 03:34:21.594]  The clouds are rainwater.
[03:34:21.594 --> 03:34:22.954]  And that's what you get there.
[03:34:22.954 --> 03:34:29.256]  Also, I want to plug the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[03:34:29.256 --> 03:34:32.637]  Your purchase of the videos and books makes this radio show possible.
[03:34:32.637 --> 03:34:36.619]  Plus, you get more informed and you get videos and books that'll wake your friends and family up.
[03:34:36.619 --> 03:34:39.019]  People are really ready to be awakened now.
[03:34:39.019 --> 03:34:40.280]  In my film, Fall of the Republic,
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:45.363]  Identifies who the real enemy of our country is, the private banking cartel.
[03:34:45.363 --> 03:34:50.986]  I got a lot of questions from Twitter and emails and callers that want to talk to Ms.
[03:34:50.986 --> 03:34:52.287]  Jones-Dottir.
[03:34:52.287 --> 03:34:58.331]  Going back to the member of the Icelandic Parliament, one of the main leaders, successfully getting this referendum through.
[03:34:58.331 --> 03:35:01.272]  How excited are the people about this referendum?
[03:35:01.272 --> 03:35:05.155]  And how is the establishment, the banking cartel, striking back?
[03:35:06.872 --> 03:35:08.632]  Well, people are very happy.
[03:35:08.632 --> 03:35:11.273]  It was our first national referendum.
[03:35:11.273 --> 03:35:23.596]  It was a historical day and we had a little get-together on the Saturday night and the mood was fantastic.
[03:35:23.596 --> 03:35:31.878]  In general, I really hope that we can keep the spirit of the nation joining together and we need to move that ambience into Parliament.
[03:35:33.806 --> 03:35:34.146]  I think so.
[03:35:51.964 --> 03:35:52.765]  In their favor.
[03:35:52.765 --> 03:36:04.276]  And it was a bit sad that our democratically elected Prime Minister decided to sit home sulking instead of participating in this historical moment.
[03:36:04.276 --> 03:36:13.084]  And despite her doing that, and thus giving a strong message to the biggest party in Iceland, people decided to go out and vote anyway.
[03:36:15.620 --> 03:36:36.353]  But there are very many exciting things happening in Iceland, such as we just spoke for a proposal which we call the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, which has gained worldwide attention, where we're suggesting that Iceland will take the lead in the freedom of speech, freedom of information and
[03:36:38.314 --> 03:36:55.743]  Freedom of expression by actually modernizing and pulling together the best possible legislation to protect sources, journalists, whistleblowers, publishers, and ISP hosts in order to get that information out to the general public.
[03:36:56.949 --> 03:37:04.614]  In fact, I have the article right here, Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, saying the West is moving in Europe, England, the U.S.
[03:37:04.614 --> 03:37:09.897]  and Canada and Australia to censor the Internet, to shut down free speech.
[03:37:09.897 --> 03:37:14.700]  Wired Magazine last week had the headline, Cybersecurity, the end of the open Internet.
[03:37:14.700 --> 03:37:15.681]  This is really happening.
[03:37:15.681 --> 03:37:19.844]  And so now, you guys are moving to say, look, we'll allow WikiLeaks to be here.
[03:37:19.844 --> 03:37:21.705]  We'll allow independent journalism.
[03:37:21.705 --> 03:37:24.827]  We want people to move here and come here and put their servers here.
[03:37:25.527 --> 03:37:31.796]  Really, as an information revolution, the people are finding the power they have to say no to the banks, and this is really growing.
[03:37:33.288 --> 03:37:46.097]  Yeah, and I really hope that it... I mean, for some reason Icelanders are right now a bit shy about placing themselves as doing anything that would be considered the best.
[03:37:46.097 --> 03:37:48.598]  They don't want to fall in the same pit.
[03:37:48.598 --> 03:37:54.082]  So I guess the most sceptical people about this proposal are Icelanders.
[03:37:54.082 --> 03:38:01.487]  We, however, managed to get all the parties in Iceland on this, and three party chair leaders.
[03:38:03.388 --> 03:38:06.750]  So I'm actually quite optimistic that we can pass this through the parliament.
[03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:16.975]  We're basically proposing or tasking the government to take on this challenge because it requires a lot of legislative changes.
[03:38:16.975 --> 03:38:23.058]  But, you know, in general it's been overwhelming the support we've got from all over the world.
[03:38:23.598 --> 03:38:28.122]  And now Greece and Spain and countless others are going to try to follow your example.
[03:38:28.122 --> 03:38:34.768]  This is a true revolution against the global banking dictatorship attempting to establish open world government and tyranny.
[03:38:34.768 --> 03:38:43.896]  I've got some questions here from our Twitter page and again it is a repeat of some of the things I've been asking about.
[03:38:43.896 --> 03:38:47.459]  What are the consequences of not conforming to
[03:38:49.042 --> 03:38:51.284]  We just dropped our video connection to her.
[03:38:51.284 --> 03:38:51.985]  We'll get her back.
[03:38:51.985 --> 03:38:58.372]  And we're going to go through some of these questions for her and your phone calls as soon as we get her back up.
[03:38:58.372 --> 03:39:02.757]  We try to bring you a lot of the guests via video connection, plus it has better audio connection on Skype.
[03:39:02.757 --> 03:39:07.402]  But there are some problems when they're on an island in the middle of the Atlantic, obviously.
[03:39:08.376 --> 03:39:11.097]  But we're going to get into some of that.
[03:39:11.097 --> 03:39:14.738]  What are the consequences of not conforming to EU demands?
[03:39:14.738 --> 03:39:21.280]  Finance Minister Stein Groomer, a no vote does not mean we are refusing to pay.
[03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:23.001]  What are her thoughts on his statements?
[03:39:23.001 --> 03:39:27.262]  We'll find out if that statement's true and what her take on that is.
[03:39:27.262 --> 03:39:34.545]  Also, what could anti-war and anti-debt slavery movements learn from the success of the movement party in Iceland?
[03:39:35.685 --> 03:39:36.966]  And so those are some of the questions.
[03:39:36.966 --> 03:39:40.708]  We'll also go to live questions from listeners.
[03:39:40.708 --> 03:39:49.212]  Don't forget that you can't not only just listen to us on AM and FM dial, a lot of new affiliates picking us up, several new affiliates each week, the show's exploding.
[03:39:49.212 --> 03:39:56.816]  You can also listen via the free podcast that has a link up at the top of InfoWars.com on the Radio Listen page and the free iPhone app.
[03:39:56.816 --> 03:40:00.078]  Five-star rating, over 400 ratings now, five-star ratings.
[03:40:00.618 --> 03:40:03.339]  Even if you don't have an iPhone, your friends and family probably do.
[03:40:03.339 --> 03:40:04.579]  Go to infowars.com.
[03:40:04.579 --> 03:40:10.040]  Front page, there's a banner that gives you the sub link on the iPhone store to the free download link.
[03:40:10.040 --> 03:40:11.680]  Please send that to your friends and family.
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:23.883]  That's another great way for us to reach new people with the news and information we cover, the guests we bring on, the callers, all the information using this radio slash TV show as a platform of awakening and resistance to this tyranny.
[03:40:23.883 --> 03:40:24.143]  Okay.
[03:40:25.578 --> 03:40:30.740]  Birgitta, going back to you, here's a Twitter question from E9Adam.
[03:40:30.740 --> 03:40:35.901]  What's the consequences of not conforming to EU demands?
[03:40:35.901 --> 03:40:44.564]  Well, there's been a lot of consequences, you know, scenarios told to the nation.
[03:40:46.254 --> 03:41:13.921]  I seriously have a feeling because of this very strong signal from the Icelandic nation and actually a very little interest among the nation to join the EU, that there was actually a statement made by the chief of the EU application procedure saying that the UK, Netherlands and Iceland should not be, you know, the application should not be interfered with.
[03:41:16.862 --> 03:41:19.783]  So first, they were threatening to not let you in.
[03:41:19.783 --> 03:41:22.805]  Now that you don't want in, they're saying, oh no, go ahead and come in.
[03:41:22.805 --> 03:41:24.486]  We want to rob you like Greece.
[03:41:24.486 --> 03:41:27.507]  Here's another question.
[03:41:27.507 --> 03:41:28.507]  Have you heard this statement?
[03:41:28.507 --> 03:41:29.428]  Is it accurate?
[03:41:29.428 --> 03:41:36.651]  Finance Minister Steingroomer, if I'm pronouncing that right, said a no vote does not mean we are refusing to pay.
[03:41:36.651 --> 03:41:38.452]  What are your thoughts on his statements?
[03:41:42.051 --> 03:41:44.834]  Sometimes it really surprises me what he says.
[03:41:44.834 --> 03:41:50.540]  It is as if he is working for the British and the Dutch, not us.
[03:41:50.540 --> 03:41:51.481]  So he did say that?
[03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:55.433]  Well, he did say that.
[03:41:55.433 --> 03:42:05.683]  However, let us not forget that the bank in question actually has a sustainable amount of assets that can be recovered.
[03:42:05.683 --> 03:42:11.849]  And so far, what the British and the Dutch can claim in it will actually be recovered by at least 88%.
[03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:14.531]  Yeah, that was in the Times of London.
[03:42:14.531 --> 03:42:20.757]  They claimed that you all owed them 20 plus thousand dollars, every individual, and they had to take over all your infrastructure.
[03:42:20.757 --> 03:42:21.838]  Now they go, guess what?
[03:42:21.838 --> 03:42:23.219]  We don't even need that money.
[03:42:23.219 --> 03:42:24.480]  We already had the assets.
[03:42:24.480 --> 03:42:32.727]  So it was a giant, just like the banks here that have robbed us, are all recording record profits, the same banks that are trying to rob you.
[03:42:32.727 --> 03:42:37.411]  I mean, that is such a key point that it turns out that they had the assets to begin with.
[03:42:38.564 --> 03:42:59.385]  Yeah, and the thing is that they actually decided, or Darling, the financial minister of the UK, he decided to move money within his own ministry and then earmark some of it, you know, 700 billion Icelandic to the Icelandic nation and then expect us to pay full interest, really high interest of that.
[03:42:59.385 --> 03:42:59.905]  I mean, it is...
[03:43:00.866 --> 03:43:03.851]  Brilliant scheme, but we will not do it.
[03:43:03.851 --> 03:43:14.970]  Well, that's another exactly you're wise to it Americans should get wise as well the collapse of Iceland was a private matter Why do they want the people to pay it is a question from resist archipelago?
[03:43:16.877 --> 03:43:35.737]  Well, I mean, in general, like every time you look at how the IMF functions, and I was actually reading a secret document leaked to Wikileaks, which is a brilliant source if you want to sort of dig deeper into the real conspiracies of our world, and it was a manual from the
[03:43:37.375 --> 03:43:39.917]  the military sector in the U.S.
[03:43:39.917 --> 03:43:54.266]  talking about unconventional warfare and in the unconventional warfare the section about financial warfare they talk about the IMF as one of their choice weapons.
[03:43:54.266 --> 03:43:55.307]  So, you know,
[03:43:56.087 --> 03:43:59.149]  I encourage people to study how the IMF functions.
[03:43:59.149 --> 03:44:05.774]  Exactly, it's a private consortium for blowing out countries and the banks are attacking America.
[03:44:05.774 --> 03:44:07.075]  This is a criminal group.
[03:44:07.075 --> 03:44:08.596]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[03:44:08.596 --> 03:44:15.400]  Rick in Arizona, you're on the air with Birgitta Jones-Dottier, one of the main leaders in Parliament, defeating the scumbag banks.
[03:44:15.400 --> 03:44:17.121]  Go ahead, Rick.
[03:44:17.121 --> 03:44:19.563]  Yes, thank both of you for fighting for freedom.
[03:44:19.563 --> 03:44:20.844]  I appreciate it.
[03:44:20.844 --> 03:44:25.087]  I have a question that has to do with one of your Twitter questions.
[03:44:25.698 --> 03:44:30.099]  About, uh, I don't know if you have, is it a president that runs Iceland?
[03:44:30.099 --> 03:44:33.941]  It's the leader of Iceland, are they calling him a president, or?
[03:44:33.941 --> 03:44:47.365]  Well, we have a president, and then we have a, which is, doesn't really have a lot of power, but the main power lies with the Prime Minister of Iceland, and the finance minister, they sort of co-share their power.
[03:44:47.365 --> 03:44:50.726]  Okay, well here's the subject that I have here is,
[03:44:51.901 --> 03:45:08.593]  For Alex also, I don't know if your staff that watched the whole Benedict Beck last night, at the end of his show he was discussing the 93% voted no to pay it back and the 1% voted for it.
[03:45:08.593 --> 03:45:16.419]  And then at the end of that part of his segment he did mention that the leader of Iceland said that they will repay it.
[03:45:16.419 --> 03:45:19.401]  Was he saying this is good because he supported the banker bailout?
[03:45:20.598 --> 03:45:24.399]  Yeah, I don't know if that... But I mean, he always flip-flops.
[03:45:24.399 --> 03:45:28.900]  I mean, he's calling for new taxes to pay the bankers, value-added VAT.
[03:45:28.900 --> 03:45:33.061]  I mean, did Beck imply it was bad that Iceland said no?
[03:45:33.061 --> 03:45:38.743]  No, he did not imply that, but he did mention that the leader of Iceland said that they will pay it anyway.
[03:45:38.743 --> 03:45:43.704]  And he was just kind of, you know... And so I don't know if he was doing a flip-flop like... So was he supportive of Iceland?
[03:45:44.471 --> 03:45:46.292]  He was supportive of their vote, yes.
[03:45:46.292 --> 03:45:47.572]  Well, good for him!
[03:45:47.572 --> 03:45:48.373]  Good for him!
[03:45:48.373 --> 03:45:50.553]  I saw him do some good work last Friday.
[03:45:50.553 --> 03:45:51.954]  I mean, I want to like Glenn Beck.
[03:45:51.954 --> 03:45:54.215]  It's just that I appreciate your call.
[03:45:54.215 --> 03:45:57.256]  Herman and New York, you're on the air with Miss Jones.
[03:45:57.256 --> 03:46:01.057]  Do you hear me?
[03:46:01.057 --> 03:46:03.018]  Yes, sir.
[03:46:03.018 --> 03:46:05.679]  I have a question and a comment.
[03:46:05.679 --> 03:46:07.740]  I'm going to go with my comment first.
[03:46:07.740 --> 03:46:12.462]  Did you see the article about how the state might not be returning
[03:46:13.705 --> 03:46:23.594]  Some of the illegal tax money that the US citizens are paying to the bankers, that they may actually hold it due to their state deficits.
[03:46:23.594 --> 03:46:30.440]  Absolutely, and now they're saying, oh, that tax return that Obama was going to give you, now most of you won't get it.
[03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:34.324]  But I'm going to let you go, Herman, because these are questions for our guest here.
[03:46:34.324 --> 03:46:36.446]  She's here especially for this.
[03:46:36.446 --> 03:46:38.488]  Cody in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:46:39.651 --> 03:46:45.639]  I just want to say I love Iceland by the way, the music, the culture, the people and everything.
[03:46:45.639 --> 03:46:55.551]  My question is, what would you suggest, if you could, that we as citizens could do who were born into this corrupt system?
[03:46:56.289 --> 03:47:06.380]  What can we do to make a change like you guys are in Iceland, you know, to stand up to our, you know... Well, they got involved, they got educated, they took action.
[03:47:06.380 --> 03:47:07.922]  Birgitta comments on what he just said.
[03:47:07.922 --> 03:47:10.505]  How do we mimic and learn from your success?
[03:47:12.758 --> 03:47:15.021]  Exactly like I said, just go and do it.
[03:47:15.021 --> 03:47:30.779]  I mean, we had eight weeks before election, we had no money, but we used the internet, we used all the resources we possibly could do, and we went and talked to people everywhere, and basically because people were hungry for change,
[03:47:32.020 --> 03:47:39.242]  You could involve so many people and what we decided to do was not to hang our agenda on left or right politics.
[03:47:39.242 --> 03:47:49.365]  We decided to have an agenda, a checklist, a sort of a hit and run movement that would go inside, for example, the Parliament and try to implement real changes there.
[03:47:49.365 --> 03:47:52.206]  It's simple, you didn't know the money and you're not going to pay it.
[03:47:53.917 --> 03:47:54.657]  Exactly.
[03:47:54.657 --> 03:47:57.798]  We never got any of this money when it comes to ISAFE.
[03:47:57.798 --> 03:47:58.979]  Why should we pay it?
[03:47:58.979 --> 03:48:01.919]  And so why are the American people giving $28 trillion to the banks?
[03:48:01.919 --> 03:48:02.900]  Cody, thanks.
[03:48:02.900 --> 03:48:04.180]  Andy in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:48:04.180 --> 03:48:07.381]  Hi.
[03:48:07.381 --> 03:48:09.722]  Well, ICAN was always the home to Figaro.
[03:48:09.722 --> 03:48:12.162]  Now it seems to be the home to freedom.
[03:48:12.162 --> 03:48:20.705]  And I just want to say that I've known a lot of Icelandic people and I think that we as people who travel, we should visit ICAN and help support it.
[03:48:20.705 --> 03:48:21.305]  I'm just wondering
[03:48:21.846 --> 03:48:25.589]  If we go there, I know there were issues with our credit cards being honored in Iceland.
[03:48:25.589 --> 03:48:30.734]  I'm just wondering, what are the day-to-day effects that Icelanders are feeling from this whole situation?
[03:48:30.734 --> 03:48:33.556]  Yeah, tell folks what the... I mean, there was food shortages, everything.
[03:48:33.556 --> 03:48:34.037]  Break it down.
[03:48:35.526 --> 03:48:48.492]  Well, we have all the credit lines opened again, and because it's a relatively small system, we could quite quickly recover or get back on track.
[03:48:48.492 --> 03:48:55.975]  There are no problems with any cards now or anything like that, so you can easily use your American credit card in Iceland, or any credit card.
[03:48:58.217 --> 03:49:05.405]  The big problem we're facing now is that, you know, before the collapse we had like 1% unemployment.
[03:49:05.405 --> 03:49:11.272]  In one month it shot up to 10% and now we're dealing with something around 14%.
[03:49:11.272 --> 03:49:16.798]  And people are, you know, facing foreclosures and the government isn't really
[03:49:17.819 --> 03:49:35.089]  are capable of dealing with these problems because we're within this IMF program and they're keeping the interest rates really high, which is a total fail in a situation like this where the interest rate should be similar as your interest rates, almost zero.
[03:49:35.089 --> 03:49:36.730]  So we are
[03:49:39.571 --> 03:49:48.857]  You know, before, like in 2007, we were ranked, according to the UN standard, as the most developed nation in the world.
[03:49:48.857 --> 03:49:51.898]  There is, like, one of the richest nations in the world.
[03:49:51.898 --> 03:49:55.400]  So this is a huge leap in a really short period of time.
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:49:57.301]  And there is a massive exodus.
[03:49:57.301 --> 03:50:01.704]  There's a lot of people moving away from Iceland because they see no hope being here.
[03:50:01.704 --> 03:50:08.848]  And I think it is critical to stop that exodus and to try to find a common vision among the Icelandic people.
[03:50:08.948 --> 03:50:09.609]  Absolutely.
[03:50:09.609 --> 03:50:12.631]  I mean, we see how the banks destroy societies.
[03:50:12.631 --> 03:50:18.536]  First World, the only First World country in Latin America, Argentina has been destroyed by them.
[03:50:18.536 --> 03:50:28.203]  And we see them holding you hostage, cutting off the credit cards, cutting off the trade, trying to force you into submission, but you said no.
[03:50:28.203 --> 03:50:30.925]  So it is important for people to support what you're doing.
[03:50:30.925 --> 03:50:34.188]  We're going to come back in a final segment with our guest.
[03:50:34.188 --> 03:50:36.210]  Earlier this morning, I got a call from
[03:50:38.059 --> 03:50:40.641]  Tyrell Ventura wanted to talk to me and I was on a break.
[03:50:40.641 --> 03:50:42.143]  I had to go.
[03:50:42.143 --> 03:50:43.984]  And I think it had to do with this.
[03:50:43.984 --> 03:50:45.025]  We just got this.
[03:50:45.025 --> 03:50:47.347]  Jesse Ventura had an article up on Huffington Post
[03:50:49.417 --> 03:50:52.680]  They offered me to write an article once and I didn't even do it because I knew they would censor.
[03:50:52.680 --> 03:50:57.664]  And they sent him an email back after they posted it saying, we're not going to have your conspiracy theories up here.
[03:50:57.664 --> 03:51:01.508]  So we'll get Ventura's take on that in the next few days here.
[03:51:01.508 --> 03:51:03.289]  Great news for pure water lovers.
[03:51:03.289 --> 03:51:06.152]  The Big Berkey Water Filter is available once again.
[03:51:06.152 --> 03:51:09.695]  And stay tuned to hear about a valuable offer from Berkey Water Filters.
[03:51:09.695 --> 03:51:12.878]  Choosing the right water purification system can be a daunting task.
[03:51:13.098 --> 03:51:17.579]  That's why BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com shows you a cost and benefit comparison.
[03:51:17.579 --> 03:51:22.601]  The Berkey Water Filter is economical, with a single set of filters that can last for 5 to 10 years.
[03:51:22.601 --> 03:51:26.802]  Berkey Water Filters are healthy and far superior to other filtration systems.
[03:51:26.802 --> 03:51:31.944]  They remove harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy chemicals like chlorine.
[03:51:31.944 --> 03:51:38.126]  And Berkey Water Filter systems are powerful enough to purify both treated and untreated water, like stagnant ponds.
[03:51:38.346 --> 03:51:42.349]  Get the gold standard in water filters at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:48.414]  For a limited time, choose a free shower filter, fluoride filters, or two Sport Berkey bottles with every system purchased.
[03:51:48.414 --> 03:51:51.697]  And GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[03:51:51.697 --> 03:51:54.199]  Details at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:51:54.199 --> 03:51:54.959]  That's 1-877-99-BER-KEY.
[03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:06.980]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.980 --> 03:52:10.228]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.228 --> 03:52:11.652]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.344 --> 03:52:15.025]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.025 --> 03:52:21.407]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.407 --> 03:52:26.929]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:36.573]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.693 --> 03:52:39.034]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.034 --> 03:52:40.635]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.635 --> 03:52:43.096]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.096 --> 03:52:45.217]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.217 --> 03:52:50.360]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.360 --> 03:52:55.382]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:55.382 --> 03:52:59.484]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.514 --> 03:53:04.116]  Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate?
[03:53:04.116 --> 03:53:09.841]  Recently, New Vitality Health Products gave away thousands of free bottles of the supplement Beta Prostate.
[03:53:09.841 --> 03:53:15.947]  Due to incredible demand, they're giving away more free bottles of Beta Prostate to any new customers who call now.
[03:53:15.947 --> 03:53:19.850]  Beta Prostate is packed with plant sterols that support your prostate health.
[03:53:19.850 --> 03:53:25.415]  Remember, your prostate affects urine flow, sleeping habits, intimacy, and overall quality of life.
[03:53:25.660 --> 03:53:34.202]  Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules in order to get the same natural plant sterols as one Beta Prostate.
[03:53:34.202 --> 03:53:38.723]  And if you haven't tried Beta Prostate yet, you can call right now for a free bottle.
[03:53:38.723 --> 03:53:40.363]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[03:53:40.363 --> 03:53:42.163]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[03:53:42.163 --> 03:53:46.584]  This offer is limited to one free bottle per household.
[03:53:46.584 --> 03:53:49.025]  Give your body nutrition that targets the prostate.
[03:53:49.025 --> 03:53:51.905]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[03:53:51.905 --> 03:53:52.225]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[03:53:54.966 --> 03:53:55.267]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[03:53:55.267 --> 03:53:55.327]  1-800-360-8306.
[03:54:03.931 --> 03:54:05.732]  Yeah, I've now read the whole email.
[03:54:05.732 --> 03:54:14.574]  It's Dick Russell sent us this, the co-author with Jesse Ventura of American Conspiracies that we're selling out of the gates discounted at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:14.574 --> 03:54:21.456]  Five dollars off the book, get a free film of your choice, DVD, at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:21.456 --> 03:54:25.397]  And this is, hello, I'm the co-author of the book American Conspiracies with Jesse Ventura.
[03:54:25.397 --> 03:54:26.858]  I wanted you to know about this.
[03:54:26.858 --> 03:54:30.179]  He sent this to our office and the Huffington Post
[03:54:31.175 --> 03:54:32.816]  Did an earlier review of the book.
[03:54:32.816 --> 03:54:44.342]  This review was just a part of a chapter, and they said, Huffington Post editorial policy laid out in blogger guidelines prohibits the promotion of promulgation of conspiracy theories, including those about 9-11.
[03:54:44.342 --> 03:54:46.543]  And we have removed the Post.
[03:54:46.543 --> 03:54:48.704]  So we'll talk about this censorship.
[03:54:48.704 --> 03:54:52.206]  They invited Ventura to do this, and then when they saw it, took it down.
[03:54:52.206 --> 03:54:53.806]  That's why this material is important.
[03:54:53.806 --> 03:54:56.408]  That's why Iceland moving for freedom is important.
[03:54:57.108 --> 03:55:01.671]  Birgitta Jones Docteur, I cannot describe how wonderful this success is.
[03:55:01.671 --> 03:55:09.875]  I know you've got another hard road ahead of you, but the success you've had is a beacon of liberty and resistance worldwide to the parasitic banks.
[03:55:09.875 --> 03:55:10.616]  We salute you.
[03:55:12.346 --> 03:55:30.766]  Well thank you, I really hope that it will be an inspiration for others and I really, I carry on my call for support and that people will follow what will be happening in Iceland because I think it has, you know, all the support we've felt from around the world, from, you know, general public,
[03:55:31.818 --> 03:55:45.591]  Supporting the Icelandic general public is extremely meaningful and we set up this website, Save the People of Iceland, and we read some of the quotes from there.
[03:55:45.591 --> 03:55:50.456]  It was an official petition, a support petition, and it was amazing to hear.
[03:55:50.456 --> 03:55:52.197]  We had a big rally, a protest.
[03:55:53.496 --> 03:55:54.158]  Oh, not me.
[03:55:54.158 --> 03:55:56.823]  I wasn't organizing it.
[03:55:56.823 --> 03:55:58.165]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[03:55:58.165 --> 03:56:01.732]  Give us the website so people can support what you guys are doing.
[03:56:01.732 --> 03:56:04.136]  Give us your email for people that want to send you intel.
[03:56:08.697 --> 03:56:10.338]  Did we lose her again?
[03:56:10.338 --> 03:56:12.460]  Okay, let's get her back on the phone.
[03:56:12.460 --> 03:56:14.241]  That happened once before, but that's okay.
[03:56:14.241 --> 03:56:18.084]  Because here at the end of the show, I wanted to give out some of the websites.
[03:56:18.084 --> 03:56:20.786]  But again, this Ventura thing is outrageous.
[03:56:20.786 --> 03:56:26.370]  We're double-triple confirming it right now, with his book being censored, the material being censored.
[03:56:26.370 --> 03:56:28.972]  Because people own a website, they can do what they want with it.
[03:56:29.252 --> 03:56:35.055]  But when you invite something, put it up, and then take it down and just say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, that's wrong.
[03:56:35.055 --> 03:56:37.416]  This book and hardcover is very well written.
[03:56:37.416 --> 03:56:39.397]  For those that still read, you need to get it.
[03:56:39.397 --> 03:56:40.378]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:56:40.378 --> 03:56:42.279]  For the price of the book, you get a free DVD.
[03:56:42.279 --> 03:56:44.500]  So you're basically just buying the DVD and getting a free book.
[03:56:44.500 --> 03:56:45.360]  Look at it either way.
[03:56:45.360 --> 03:56:47.061]  Infowars.com.
[03:56:47.061 --> 03:56:50.563]  Jesse Ventura on with us for a full hour this Friday.
[03:56:51.463 --> 03:56:54.104]  And I've been wanting to get the co-author of the book on as well.
[03:56:54.104 --> 03:57:05.728]  We'll try to get him on tomorrow or the next day or maybe even on with Ventura briefly on Friday to talk about this censorship that is going on.
[03:57:05.728 --> 03:57:06.049]  And again...
[03:57:13.956 --> 03:57:29.371]  Retransmission's about to start in a minute on the internet streams at InfoWars.com with Anthony Schaeffer, Lieutenant Colonel Abel Danger, of course, the A Lamp in the Dark documentary film, Looking at History, and a lot more.
[03:57:29.371 --> 03:57:34.776]  So that's coming up in retransmission, and we just salute Birgitta Jones-Dottier for all that she's done.
[03:57:34.776 --> 03:57:35.377]  Do we have her again?
[03:57:37.344 --> 03:57:42.067]  Okay, well, we'll just have to say bye to her right now, then.
[03:57:42.067 --> 03:57:48.291]  But we do salute her, and we salute all the people of Iceland and what they've done.
[03:57:48.291 --> 03:57:49.171]  And it's a testament.
[03:57:49.171 --> 03:57:55.035]  If Americans stop caring about football and their favorite sitcom as much, you might have a financial future.
[03:57:55.035 --> 03:57:59.918]  If not, you're going to be bankrupted and totally enslaved by these bankers.
[03:58:00.498 --> 03:58:05.520]  You can Google Birgitta Jones Dotier, find all her sites, other material, save the people of Iceland.
[03:58:05.520 --> 03:58:09.582]  You can find those sites with a simple web search as well.
[03:58:09.582 --> 03:58:27.191]  And again, we'll continue to have her pop in with reports for us from Iceland, the front lines in the fight against the global banking dictatorship, openly announcing world government that we are resisting here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:27.191 --> 03:58:28.952]  So, as I said, great job to the crew.
[03:58:30.782 --> 03:58:32.564]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:58:32.564 --> 03:58:36.148]  As long as we expose these criminal bankers, we have a chance of saving society.
[03:58:36.148 --> 03:58:37.870]  They are the main enemy of humanity.
[03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:39.191]  They must be defeated.
[03:58:39.191 --> 03:58:40.312]  End the Fed.
[03:58:40.312 --> 03:58:40.813]  God bless.
[03:58:40.813 --> 03:58:41.714]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:41.714 --> 03:58:47.320]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:47.320 --> 03:58:50.524]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:51.385 --> 03:58:54.408]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[03:59:08.701 --> 03:59:15.068]  For example, with each pre-production order of three 7-Day Responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[03:59:15.068 --> 03:59:17.230]  That's Buy 3, Get 1 Free.
[03:59:17.230 --> 03:59:20.133]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[03:59:20.133 --> 03:59:27.701]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this Buy 3, Get 1 Free program.
[03:59:28.101 --> 03:59:31.002]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
